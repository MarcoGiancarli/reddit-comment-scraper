tmobile,3e4ib4,anothercookie90,2,Tue Jul 21 22:12:34 2015 UTC,"True. However I will note a certain change I've noticed. In the past even if I already had an unactivated SIM and tried to activate with Care and AAL, they told me they couldn't do it and that I must buy the $15 SIM. Ie. $15 activation fee.   However, I did an AAL for two lines within he past two months and called care and asked again, and they said sure, and just asked me for the SIM card number, and didn't charge me the $15 ""SIM Card fee"".   So at least they have that going for them. Not sure if you can get away with that in store.   But yeah...it looks like at&t is just copying and pasting T-Mobile on this, but actually calling it an activation fee, lol."
tmobile,3e4ib4,Inspirasion,2,Tue Jul 21 22:30:58 2015 UTC,Or you can pay the $15 SIM fee and get a $50-120 new line sign up bonus from some cashback websites  Highest I see at the moment is $100 from Topcashback.
tmobile,3e4ib4,anothercookie90,2,Tue Jul 21 22:39:01 2015 UTC,True. The Slickdeals AAL deal happened literally after I added my last line. Ugh.

tmobile,3e2scu,wwtectmo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:29 2015 UTC,I think the WeBoost is worth getting because you don't have to worry about having an indoor signal unlike with Cel-Fi you need indoor signal to boost.

tmobile,3e2scu,Cjaiceman,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:20 2015 UTC,"WeBoost (Wilson Electronics) amplifiers vs the T-Mobile Cell-Fi is kind of like comparing a simple ""point and shoot"" digital camera to a prosumer DSLR. The WeBoost will take a little longer to install, requires a bit of research, etc... but the outcome is generally better. The T-Mobile Cell-Fi is designed to be as easy as possible so the general public can install it.   This guy has a great example of what an install would look like, while the model numbers are different, the general install process is about the same: https://youtu.be/VKdZmC1XwZo"

tmobile,3e2scu,djmixman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:36 2015 UTC,"That is correct, the documentation says you are ""supposed"" to send notice to the FCC about it's location. Do people do it? I would suspect that a very large majority don't, and if you aren't causing interference, then the FCC will probably never be knocking on your door.   It's just like those bubble pack 2-way radios you can get at Target/Wal-Mart, etc... You are supposed to get a GMRS license to use the upper, full power channels, but I would guess that 99% of people don't, and use those channels anyways. Again, the FCC doesn't really enforce it either, unless you are consistently causing interference."

tmobile,3e34jb,dedbeats,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a good plan in my opinion. I would add, if you have a spare junk smartphone lying around trade that in to get the $10 Jump on Demand iPhone 6 special that's going on for $15 per month. Then trade up to the iPhone 6s in Sep/Oct. I'm not sure if they'll have another promo but if not you're looking at the standard price which will be ~$27 per month and a $0-200 upfront payment depending on which model you choose.  Jump on Demand is really no different from standard EIP other than you have the choice to return it at the 18 month mark or keep it and pay off the remainder of the balance. Either way you're paying the full retail price of the device."
tmobile,3e34jb,Visvism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:51 2015 UTC,"Good info, thanks. I didn't see that special lease price on their site anywhere, where did you find that info?"
tmobile,3e34jb,lebodano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"The great thing about the Jump on Demand is the ability to do the multiple upgrades. When you sign up, trade in the worst phone you have in order to take advantage of the $15/month iphone 6 lease payment. After the 6s comes out, you can jump again but your monthly payment I am sure will be >$25/month. Nothing wrong in your plan, just be aware."
tmobile,3e34jb,Visvism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:56 2015 UTC,Interesting. The 6 is currently ~$27/mo so the 6S would probably be around there as well. Really good to know about the reduced iPhone 6 lease payment.
tmobile,3e34jb,say592,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'll also note the only problem you may face is the availability of the iPhone 6s when it is released. Jump on Demand requires one to go to their local T-Mobile store in order to do swaps, upgrades, etc. So your chance of swapping out for the later iPhone will be dependent upon how many units and what types of units stores around you receive."
tmobile,3e34jb,Schnazzy88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"Good point. I'd be in no rush to get the new phone anyway, I usually wait for reviews to makes sure the device is solid and is a justifiable upgrade, which the iPhone S devices tend to be."

The Radio Works’ country “US-95” KUSQ, Worthington, MN and CHR sister “Party 104.1” KZTP, Sibley, IA were knocked off the air when at least 300 feet of their shared 500-foot tower was brought down by ice yesterday.  According to Radio Works General Manager Chad Cummings, the tower had more than two inches of ice built up on it.  He said trees were down everywhere and the devastation had been massive.  Radio Works has hired a tower contractor to assess and remove the damaged structure.  Gov.

Dayton said the storms were taxing the resources of local and county governments and that conditions were expected to worsen. He issued an executive order activating the guard.    EDIT: Formatting"

tmobile,3e1o1v,dallas75252,5,Tue Jul 21 19:44:19 2015 UTC,It's active pretty much across all of DFW and it has made my experience with T-mobile infinitely better. Coverage is almost on par here with VZW and AT&T but with faster speeds most of the time. Building penetration was a huge problem prior to B12 deployment and when I tried T-mobile last year I could not stick with them because of this. Gave them another shot starting back in May and I'm not going anywhere now.   T-mobile really needs to change the Test Drive to include a band 12 device so potential customers can get a more accurate picture of the coverage they can expect.
tmobile,3e1o1v,Visvism,6,Tue Jul 21 11:27:57 2015 UTC,I concur that DFW coverage is pretty solid after B12 deployment.  It is rare if I see HSPA or EDGE these days in DFW area.  My friend has an iPhone 6+ and he complains about T-Mobile coverage in certain areas in Dallas.  He was at a T-Mobile retail store a month ago and his iPhone picked up weak HSPA signal.  I told him to go to check out the display Note 4 in the store.  He was surprised that it has full bars of LTE.  I told him it was probably B12 that is was picking up and his iPhone can't.
tmobile,3e1o1v,bkosh84,3,Tue Jul 21 14:11:30 2015 UTC,This is absolutely what I needed to hear! My significant other lives in the DFW area and I really want to bring her over to my T-Mobile account so I can close my Verizon account completely. The only thing slowing that step is that she has an iPhone 6 and needs to use her phone for work so coverage and reliability are of extreme importance. I knew that band 12 was active but to see customers say it's a huge improvement is great news. Now the ball is in Apple's hands.
tmobile,3e1o1v,Hilbe,5,Tue Jul 21 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"In the Cleveland Ohio area the difference is very noticable.. My wife has a G4 and I have an iPhone 6+ and where I get 4G HSPA+, she is getting 4G LTE.   We go to church in an old 1930's theater and I don't get a usable signal at all but she gets 4G LTE in the building."
tmobile,3e1o1v,bkosh84,3,Tue Jul 21 12:59:15 2015 UTC,"I believe also from Columbus, OH to Cleveland, OH on 71 now you get reception as well thanks to B12.  Filling in some gaps on the interstate is always welcomed."
tmobile,3e1o1v,hiromasaki,3,Tue Jul 21 13:21:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we travel the Ohio Turnpike between the Cleveland/Toledo area quite often and when we both had iPhone 6's we had dead spots along the turnpike, it'll be interesting to see how coverage along the 'pike has improved as we travel down it this weekend."

(From about where 145 crosses I-71 to Columbus, the Band 12 license belongs to not-T-Mobile.)"
tmobile,3e1o1v,krispykracker1,5,Tue Jul 21 22:44:57 2015 UTC,Its the difference between having LTE and VoLTE and no coverage at all. Many regions of South Jersey would simply have no coverage if they didn't deploy 700mhz. It is an absolute necessity and T-Mobile needs more low band spectrum.

tmobile,3e1o1v,passantino,3,Tue Jul 21 18:36:15 2015 UTC,I can't wait for it to deploy in the Bay Area. Going into buildings is never a good experience.
tmobile,3e1o1v,OtherAlan,6,Tue Jul 21 07:32:58 2015 UTC,"In my experience band 12 has boosted reception by 10-20 dbm over band 4. It is a big difference, especially when you're on the fringe of the coverage area or inside a building. The signal travels much farther, even in city environments."
tmobile,3e1o1v,Visvism,2,Tue Jul 21 08:54:13 2015 UTC,How about your speeds? Are they similar to before on band 4. I read that on band 12 speeds decrease a bit.
tmobile,3e1o1v,mattcofer,5,Tue Jul 21 09:08:12 2015 UTC,"Speeds on band 12 will typically be lower than band 4 due to the smaller bandwidth Tmo owns (5x5). In testing, I usually get north of 5 Mbps down. With carrier aggregation though it will be faster."
tmobile,3e1o1v,WindAeris,2,Tue Jul 21 09:21:56 2015 UTC,It must feel great to not be the only guy in the room with no service.  It must make you feel proud to have T-Mobile. Great coverage and unlimited data. Screw AT&T and Verizon.

tmobile,3e1o1v,grundhog,4,Tue Jul 21 17:02:28 2015 UTC,"I went from having to walk outside of my house to make phone calls to now having good Band 12 LTE signal throughout my house.    In other words, I went from always thinking about signal (when expecting an important call I had to leave my phone in a certain spot of the house) to never thinking about signal again."
tmobile,3e1o1v,4skhole,4,Tue Jul 21 14:27:57 2015 UTC,"Active all over here,  definetely worth the upgrade. Seems to work very fast because the network only uses it as a result of no other bands available, also I am now the only carrier with LTE at work ;)"
tmobile,3e1o1v,NexusPhan,4,Tue Jul 21 16:27:01 2015 UTC,When I first joined Tmobile I had The LgG3 (not band 12) and I couldn't get signal anywhere in my area. I was really upset. I did some research and saw that I was covered by band 12 and called Tmobile up explained the situation and they got me a LgG4 and told me to return the G3 since I was still in the trial period. Now I get service almost everywhere in my area. A few places are spotty but it's 90% better than what it used to be.
tmobile,3e1o1v,4skhole,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:04 2015 UTC,Anyone have experience with Band 12 in Philadelphia?
tmobile,3e1o1v,OtherAlan,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:26 2015 UTC,I'm still waiting for B12 deployment in Eastern Mass.
tmobile,3e1o1v,4skhole,3,Tue Jul 21 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"It is a big improvement.  Minneapolis/St Paul has solid band 4 coverage, but with band 12, the coverage is suburb. I can't remember the last time I didn't have a good LTE signal in the metro area, and the building penetration is where it really steps up the game - specifically in the bathroom at my work."
tmobile,3e1o1v,TerryYockey,3,Tue Jul 21 18:42:42 2015 UTC,"I have band 12 in my local area, and it is great.  I am closest to it at my sister-in-laws house, and it is needless to say data speed is quick.  Enough for me to not log on to her WiFi.  I can drive about nearly 2 miles and still be connected to that tower and have a little bit slower data speed, but still perfectly usable.  So yeah band 12 is great, just wish I had a band 12 tower at near my house."
tmobile,3e1o1v,lukotheboss,2,Tue Jul 21 08:02:14 2015 UTC,Any idea how to search for towers? Other than the obvious driving around..?
tmobile,3e1o1v,TerryYockey,4,Tue Jul 21 08:08:27 2015 UTC,cell mapper is actually surprisingly accurate.  There are filters by band on the right side.  T-Mobile is 310 260  https://www.cellmapper.net/map
tmobile,3e1o1v,lukotheboss,3,Tue Jul 21 10:55:18 2015 UTC,"I installed LTE discovery app and that how I found out which kind of band and tower I was using.  When you use that app you can log your towers and it records the gps coordinate so you can search on google maps for the locations.  You still have to drive around, but you can look back when you are at home and pin point them out conveniently.  I hope this helps."
tmobile,3e1o1v,egcthree,8,Tue Jul 21 08:11:33 2015 UTC,"LTE discovery is still considered unreliable in how it picks up b12. There were a lot of false positives in the past, and I'm not sure if it can ever be fixed due to how a tmobile B12 antenna should report itself vs what's being reported real world."
tmobile,3e1o1v,dsulli37,3,Tue Jul 21 08:23:07 2015 UTC,"I am unaware of that and since I cannot confirm or deny you are right I will that when the app shows the tower or connection I have I test it.  The best way I can on my phone and using speed test, and that in itself is unreliable as well with buffer bloats whatever the term is.  My point is my ""real world"" speeds tests have have correlated to the indicator that LTE discovery is showing me.  I have not reason to doubt it yet, but I have only tested it in my relative location.  However, you maybe right, but are all limited when testing or researching on our phones.  We can only use what we have at that time. Thank you for your input because I will re-verify the date that LTE discovery gives me.  Any other tools that you use for tower discovery and info,  PC or otherwise?"

Rootmetrics' data looks a bit outdated, because it's only showing 2G, which is what it was like a year ago.  If someone went out and did a test or two on RootMetrics, that would probably be the most-conclusive answer I could get.

tmobile,3e32jq,mitten_mike,4,Tue Jul 21 20:50:13 2015 UTC,"initially, Sprint only had a 5x5 swath of LTE (1900mhz), then from Nextel they got another 5x5 of LTE (800mhz) that they still aren't finished rolling out, and then of course their massive 40-120mhz swath of 2.5ghz which isn't great with propagation.  they DO have a TON of LTE coverage but since it's only 5x5 in a lot of areas still and Sprint has site density issues all over the country; 1 tower serving tons of people with only 5x5 = congestion city.  as a current Sprint customer, I'll admit their non-Spark data is nearly unusable in major cities, but, I've never had problems getting a signal. ive never actually dropped coverage that I can remember; I always have at least EVDO (3g with a max speed of 3.1mbps) or 1XRTT (like T-Mobile's EDGE, used for voice, sms, and slow data).  also remember most carriers don't just map LTE coverage, they map everything."
tmobile,3e32jq,mitten_mike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"Good point, that makes sense. Would a 5X5 block and congestion be a reason people would say that the signal sucks even though they ""should"" be getting solid LTE signal or could there also be additional variables"
tmobile,3e32jq,anothercookie90,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"most people who say 'my signal sucks' are probably trying to say 'my data isn't very usable' or 'my phone is slow'. congestion is pretty much the primary problem, with site density coming in 2nd. Sprint has a lot of legacy customers on old phones not capable of using their new 2.5ghz spectrum, so they can't be 'offloaded' their 5x5 bands when they're near a B41 tower. also, sites were built with the intention of using 1900mhz, not 2.5ghz, so between 2 sites, you'll drop to 800mhz to maintain a consistent signal. you get a ton of people sitting on 800mhz though, and it becomes congested. it's basically a perfect storm of hiccups. Sprint's 'densification plan' is an attempt to address these issues. the more people on 2.5ghz = fewer on 800 and 1900 = less congestion on those bands = faster speeds between 2.5ghz sites.  also, Sprint phones, at least the Android ones, grossly underestimate signal strength. on a Nexus 6 (non-Sprint version) the signal might say 3-4 bars, but on a Sprint phone with the same dbm, it'll say 1 bar. 100dbm is an 'average' signal, but my phone says it's 'below average'. it's some thing they never got around to fixing -_-"
tmobile,3e32jq,Ascertion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:27 2015 UTC,5x5 and congestion is usually the reason people see really slow speeds on Sprint. They do have some backhaul problems though even where they do have band 41.
tmobile,3e32jq,Ascertion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:46 2015 UTC,"Well, 5x5 is only 10Mhz of spectrum to begin with, so it's more prone to noise as there's less sub-channels to drown the noise out.  T-Mobile's massive 40Mhz of wideband helps tremendously with the signal to noise ratio, thus causing a better user experience on T-Mobile."
tmobile,3e32jq,ruben3232,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"Sprint has low band advantage while T-Mobile has more towers.  Since both cover similar ground, T-Mobile has more towers per city while Sprint utilizes their lower band spectrum to cover more with less towers.  As a result, in the areas both service, T-Mobile often performs better than Sprint due to better capacity."
tmobile,3e32jq,Schnazzy88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"ile Sprint utilizes their lower band spectrum to cover more with less towers. A   But with the lower band spectrum, they can cover more ground than T-Mobile even though it may not be as reliable, correct? And this would be why the LTE coverage on a Sprint map is so much greater than LTE coverage on a T-Mobile map?"
tmobile,3e32jq,dsatrbs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:26 2015 UTC,Exactly that.
tmobile,3e32jq,Schnazzy88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile actually has had a coverage perception problem for many years, but they have been making great strides at improving their coverage.  Their coverage is in fact better than even Verizon's in some locations.  The coverage maps and marketing by the big two carriers are a big part of the perception problem.  Their maps are far from accurate...they are simply a marketing tool.  T-Mobile exaggerates their coverage a bit on their map as well, but not as much as the other guys."
tmobile,3e32jq,dsatrbs,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile exaggerates their coverage a bit on their map as well, but not as much as the other guys.   Especially the newest map, I feel like they didn't add towers but they just made the modeling algorithm more loose with what is considered usable coverage, because coverage looks broader, but I doubt they increased towers in many areas."
tmobile,3e32jq,flpete3,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:10 2015 UTC,"While they probably didn't add a bunch of towers all at once to increase coverage, they may have deployed longer range 700mhz (band 12) spectrum.  In a rural area I drive through occasionally, I've verified new LTE coverage exists and is consistent with the coverage map.  However,  my Nexus 6 wasn't getting LTE in all of the locations along my route where the map says it should be there.  Maybe that's why those spots don't also say ""verified by customer data""...hmm."
tmobile,3e32jq,traveljack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:49 2015 UTC,"Oh they definitely added Band 12, the gaping hole over south jersey which is the middle of nowhere (the pine barrens) is pink with LTE now, all Band 12.

Switching carriers is something that takes time, and can be a very bumpy process.  The mere fact you switched carriers - and tried traveling abroad within 36 hours of doing so - is stupid.  You admitted you had months to do this, so why didn't you?   How is all of the issues T-Mobile's fault, when a lot of this could have been prevented had you and your sister been proactive on switching carriers?  When I switched from AT&T to T-Mobile, the process took over a week due to issues porting numbers (and I'm now a happy customer for 1.5 years).

tmobile,3e0yc8,CMChor17,13,Tue Jul 21 02:53:48 2015 UTC,"I will say, that while disappointing, assuming that your map is oriented to north, you are likely in between the alpha and beta sector.  The alpha sector is the first sector found when starting at 0 degrees azimuth and moving clockwise if you are looking too down. The alpha sector is typically near 0 degrees azimuth, placing bets at ~120 degrees. And you are somewhere around 60 degrees just eye balling it which places you squarely in the middle of my two surmised azimuth.  If you take a quick google spin and look into radiation patterns and beam forms for traditional panel antennas, you will see that being off angle is clearly disadvantageous as opposed to being directly head on with the beam.  It's unfortunate and this is when you hope the network is dense enough to pick up the slack, but apparently it is not in this case.  TL;DR the antennas are likely oriented in a fashion that does not favor your location."
tmobile,3e0yc8,reedacus25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:57:25 2015 UTC,Yes the map is N-S orientation. Thanks for your technological explanation. I was thinking it had something to do with an unfortunate placement of the panels. I notice when I am driving perpendicular to this cell site I get a better signal even though I could be farther away as the crow flies. A few blocks to the east of my last point on the map you begin to increase signal strength tremendously as you begin picking up a signal from across our bay front. It seems I am located in a very narrow corridor which happens to also be made of several old coquina (stone mined from the seabed) buildings.

But tbh, I have a tower that is shared by all 4 carriers less than a mile from me. AT&T and Verizon get 2-4 bars of LTE inside my house thanks to their low band spectrum while Sprint and Tmobile get 1 bar of LTE inside (if I'm lucky) or else it's 2-3 bars of 3G for Sprint or 1-2 bars of ""4G"" for tmobile. Sprint had awful data speeds and horrible voice quality so I ditched them and even with only 1-2 bars of 4G on T-Mobile, it's still a hell of a lot better.

Without it you have to get a replacement from insurance first. Did you get a replacement and/or was the original device recovered and damaged? On your itemized receipt you'll see your deductible, sales tax for your new iPhone 6, and an eip balance payment for $100 for your iPhone 5. If you have an EIP agreement your iphone is $27.08/month assuming you're prime credit. Your eip statement that you signed will say what your monthly payment, down payment, and sales tax was. I know of no way to bill an entire phone that option is long gone from retail systems. Granted if you only owed $100 on the phone it would have been better to just pay it off and save the $75 but that is how jump works. You need to return the phone in good working order or pay the deductible and we pay off the remaining balance and you start again. I'm also not sure how they billed your credit card $325 without you giving them the number. Unless you have auto pay and if that's the case you paid for 1/2 the iPhone. If you got an iPhone 6 and then a $350 credit I'd quit while I was ahead if I were you OP. You are essentially getting an iPhone 6 for $325 it sounds like you are working towards getting the phone and the old one paid off for $210 and sadly if you signed the paperwork you agreed that is not the case."

tmobile,3e181e,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:08:44 2015 UTC,"so the post was too long for me to completely go over BUT I have been dealing with an issue as well where I wanted to go on Jump on Demand but I had an EIP balance. a rep ordered something for me to use as a jump, told me to sign the form, and he will be able to get me to jump on demand if i just pay it off. He did a ship to fulfillment phone. Long story short, i lost my upgrade and didn't get my new phone or jump. I was able to (after about 3 weeks and numerous calls/tweets to T force support) to get them to give me a $20 bill credit, and pay off $287 of my EIP to get me to a $0 balance on my current phone so I can go to Jump on Demand. It was a pain but it worked. I just kept saying the rep tried working the system which technically he was and they were there to resolve eventually."

tmobile,3e181e,IntoTheMirror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:48 2015 UTC,If you did jump on a stolen phone it would not have been an insurance claim it would have been an upgrade.  So you would pay the deductible on the phone in this case 175$ and the original EIP would have been cleared out then you would have paid the taxes and down-payment if required and started a new EIP which is what happened.  To file a insurance claim the T mobile store can't help you with that.  That would go to the insurance company assurant and you would have just paid the 175$ deductible.
tmobile,3dznkw,T-Mo-SideKick,8,Mon Jul 20 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"BTW your count is slightly off.   Right after John announced on Periscope that ""We have cleared or will clear 187 million POPs of the 190 million we own of low band spectrum"" T-Mobile submitted applications and revealed which stations signed agreements.   KDTV-DT (San Francisco, CA) app KTFN (El Paso, TX) app   That leaves us with only one major exclusion zone: WTAE-TV (Pittsburgh, PA).

tmobile,3e1is8,PerformanceGM,2,Tue Jul 21 06:16:43 2015 UTC,"For landlines, the deal is usually that the person placing the call pays, unless you do a collect call. You wouldn't pay because you have SCNA, so the call is treated like a regular call on both ends. For cell phones, you use airtime when you answer a call, but there wouldn't be any additional charges to answer an international call, only to place one.  In that scenario, the call you're placing is a domestic call because you're calling a domestic number. The other person would pay the roaming rates of 20¢ per minute with a Simple Choice plan.  Yes, you can activate and remove the feature when you like.  Nobody really knows."
tmobile,3e1is8,blaziecat1103,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:16 2015 UTC,"Logically thinking, As long as you pay for it, they will not be able to take it away. Like pretty much all grandfathered plans/services. If they phase out the option for it, and you got it 'active', you will have to keep it on your plan or lose it forever. I think the exception here might be the sidekick features but.... eh.  Like how they got the Jump v1 for some people still, or yourself with your grandfathered in plan. You keep it as long as you pay for it. If they decide to remove it, they will have to compensate you."

tmobile,3e0fjb,this_guy55,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:31 2015 UTC,T-Mobile needs to hurry up and make LTE coverage continuous between Austin and Houston.

tmobile,3e0fjb,atyppo,2,Tue Jul 21 01:45:51 2015 UTC,"So two different sets of 10x10 then? Why not make it 20x20 or is it not possibke because it's not continuous?   The post I saw said it would be 10x10 and 5x5 after the shutdown, is this not correct then?"
tmobile,3e0fjb,atyppo,3,Tue Jul 21 01:49:58 2015 UTC,"You already have 10x10 AWS, 5x5 AWS and 5x5 700A according to your screenshots.

tmobile,3e0fjb,50atomic,2,Tue Jul 21 02:25:26 2015 UTC,"Ah OK, this makes sense now. Didn't realize the 5x5 was in a different block. So Austin will be in a great situation then, probably better than Houston when you adjust for the subscriber differences."
tmobile,3e0fjb,nk1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:35:07 2015 UTC,Austin will run a 10+10 configuration. Not the same as a 20x20 setup as in Houston as the spectrum is not contiguous.
tmobile,3e0fjb,sometymes,2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:02 2015 UTC,It will be two 10x10 AWS carriers aggregated with 5x5 700A. It looks like T-Mobile has no hope to swap AWS spectrum with other carriers to make a continuous 20x20 AWS block in Austin. The network probably will be slightly less efficient compared to 20x20 but with carrier aggregation it will be close to that.

tmobile,3dzlfb,anwserman,8,Mon Jul 20 20:32:30 2015 UTC,"Or is there a limit on how many towers you can have in an area, due to broadcast collision?   No limit but it gets increasingly difficult to manage interference between sites. A more serious bottleneck is money. First of all the equipment is very costly. Even if you replace it once in seven years which is considered the average replacement cycle in the industry it is still expensive. In the breakdown below the cost of equipment is annualized capex (capital expenditures). Here are costs for a typical metropolitan rooftop in Western Europe (I believe the poster was working for T-Mobile UK in 2012, I'm converting to 2012 US dollars at 1:1.2 rate):   annualized capex: $15,000  site lease: $12,600 backhaul: $10,800 power: $3,600 operations: $9,000 total: $51,000 a year or $4,250 a month   I wouldn't be surprised if site leases and backhaul are significantly more expensive in the US compared to UK. So increasing network capacity using macro sites (towers and rooftops) is not sustainable. Microcells are the answer (read the whole post for details) but afaik the US market is not that good for microcell deployments right now. Backhaul is still expensive."
tmobile,3dzlfb,danrant,5,Mon Jul 20 21:29:44 2015 UTC,"You got the gist. Don't forget that more towers cost more $$$.   The point here is that if you know the cost of the phone company and the amount of capital expenditure avoided you can work out the value of the spectrum to a phone company. The phone company can either buy more spectrum or build more towers. [To work this out accurately you would need a map of the US, demographic and phone usage data by small region and try to work out how you would serve them.]   source"
tmobile,3dzlfb,50atomic,4,Mon Jul 20 20:45:45 2015 UTC,"Spectrum: More contiguous spectrum, the faster the speed that any tower servicing that signal can push data   Correct, with caveat.  If there's 15MHz available, it may not all be LTE.  It may be 10MHz LTE, 5MHz UMTS/HSPA+.   (up to the frequency max. Eg, 700mhz will be slower than 1900mhz)   Apparently this is a misconception?  The frequency itself supposedly has very little effect on the throughput.   So, if my logic is correct - if you're spectrum constrained, you cannot offer the fastest transmission speeds but could alleviate this, by building more towers (reducing users on each, making sure each tower is servicing data up to the spectrum limit). On the flip side, you could have a lot of spectrum but no towers, thus no speed - as your towers will be overloaded.   Correct.  You can offset towers with spectrum and vice-versa, until the right balance is struck.   Would the 'real' bottleneck really would be the towers? If all you could get was 5mbps in a area with a small block of spectrum, and each tower was pumping that out almost guarenteed - it'd be great. Or is there a limit on how many towers you can have in an area, due to broadcast collision?   I'm not really sure what you're asking here.  Of course number of towers is a bottleneck.  Not only are they expensive and time-consuming to erect, but they have recurring costs.  Bandwidth is a super-expensive up-front cost, but once purchased and deployed it is continuous ROI.  You can put multiple towers in very small spaces - stadiums have mini cells (DAS nodes) all over within the structure.  But doing that to cover a suburb would be prohibitively expensive."

tmobile,3dyk1h,xxdmnxosxx,3,Mon Jul 20 16:47:53 2015 UTC,"That is one of the Paxfire landing pages.  Paxfire filed bankruptcy years ago.  T-Mobile is now implementing the same sort of thing Paxfire used to do (down to duplicating the page layout).  The proper link for the opt-out is now:  http://lookup.t-mobile.com/prefs.php  Note this doesn't mean you get NX domains.  It just means you get an ""error"" in the web browser instead of search results (see a comment deeper in this thread for more detail)."
tmobile,3dyk1h,cowens,2,Mon Jul 20 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"Note: In order for opt-out to work properly, you need to accept a ""cookie"" indicating that you have opted out of this service. If you use a program that removes cookies, you will have to repeat this opt-out process when the cookie is deleted. The cookie placed on your computer will contain the site name: ""http://tmob.search-help.net"".   Wait how would they be able to read the cookie if they're returning a legitimate NXDOMAIN?  Thx for the link, BTW"
tmobile,3dyk1h,cowens,4,Mon Jul 20 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"They can't.  That was Paxfire (who paid companies like T-Mobile to put hardware into their networks).  There were four opt-out solutions available (and the ISP made the decision which one to use):   cookie based opt-out provide clean DNS servers (client had to reconfigure their machine) blacklist certain IP address on the redirection device so an NX domain would not be captured for that IP address MAC address filtering   In general ISPs chose the first option.  The user was still redirected to the search page, but a cookie was placed on the target machine that caused the search pages to display a mock error page that looked like the proper error page for the browser being used.  If you were doing anything other than HTTP you were pretty much screwed (as I was constantly when I typoed a domain name in ssh: ""why is it just hanging?"").  Option 2 required the ISP to have a separate set of clean DNS servers (ie without the redirection device in front of it).  This would have required more work for the sysadmins.  Option 3 was nice, but maintaining the blacklist was not trivial.  Option 4 was only implemented by Frontier, IIRC, and never really worked right.  I have no knowledge of what sinful thing T-Mobile is currently doing, but it isn't Paxfire (even though the pages look and behave the same way).  Paxfire did not use PHP and the new T-Mobile search pages use PHP.  Most likely T-Mobile decided to whip up a quick replacement for Paxfire when they declared bankruptcy."

This still doesn't get you NX record, but at least you don't have to look at the advertising.  What market are you in? I am on the east coast and my DNS seems clean. You may be able to complain to T-Mobile and get them to pull the device they have in front of your DNS server.  You should also check and see if the IP address it returns for Google is valid (ie it matches the ones Google returns when you query 8.8.8.8). One way to test this is to query it and if only one IP returns, then T-Mobile is proxying your traffic to Google (a valid answer has like ten IP addresses). If that is the case, you have an even stronger case for getting them to stop.  If you are on windows, you can use nslookup to query the DNS server directly. If you are on Linux or OS X, you probably have dig available."
tmobile,3dyk1h,Anand999,5,Mon Jul 20 17:21:49 2015 UTC,"If you do a DNS query for a Google-owned hostname to T-Mobile's DNS servers, you'll usually get an IP address back that belongs to T-Mobile's range.  This is because Google maintains several caching servers within T-Mobile's network (see https://peering.google.com/about/ggc.html).  These servers live in T-Mobile's data center and have public IPs in T-Mobile's IP space, but are otherwise completely owned and operated by Google."

The best things tmobile can do now is button everything down and try to make sure they got a good enough infrastructure to support manageable growth.  We already see a side affect of this unlimited plan and it's temporary throttling for heavy users at congested towers. If they offer unlimited again, it will make it worse."

tmobile,3e0m98,Opuz,3,Tue Jul 21 01:48:48 2015 UTC,I have a feeling based on what T-Mobile has done lately that unlimited data up until now has been more as a test bed to determine what high speed data buckets to offer.  It's no accident that they now have the 21gb soft cap on unlimited plans and the maximum data bucket you can get on the promo family plan is 20gb.  I have a feeling that after the two year unlimited guarantee they will go to larger bucket plans that while not unlimited will be a steal compared to the other carriers. If unlimited sticks around it will probably be positioned at a price point to make most of us think twice about whether or not we really need it.

tmobile,3e094o,WhatWhatTech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:47:56 2015 UTC,I just bought off 2 phones on contract with AT&T a few days ago. I was able to unlock them that night. I just finished porting them over. While there where a lot of steps in the complete process it was relatively painless. No technical issues at all. It was a 6plus and a 5S btw.
tmobile,3e08ky,Knightan,2,Mon Jul 20 23:22:56 2015 UTC,"Yes it's still available. I would still consider JUMP! On Demand though as it doesn't cost an extra monthly fee, you can upgrade whenever you want (up to three times a year) without paying off an existing phone balance, and you can still keep the phone by just paying the difference between what you've paid and the full cost of the phone. It's basically a leasing plan that doesn't penalize you extra money beyond retail cost if you want to keep the device."
tmobile,3e08ky,BioMatt64,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:07:48 2015 UTC,Yeah but if you plan on upgrading yearly go for JUMP on demand it is at least $24 cheaper per year if you want insurance if not its $120 cheaper

tmobile,3dvx7l,nicothetechguy,7,Mon Jul 20 02:44:45 2015 UTC,T-Mobile's main network vendors are Ericsson and NSN (Nokia). Each are doing LTE B12 deployments in their respective service areas. About all of California is Ericsson territory.

tmobile,3dw5c6,hiromasaki,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:42 2015 UTC,"Whoever ""corrected"" you was mistaken! :)  T-Mobile uses it themselves on their blog. And in their presentation about acquiring MetroPCS, they use 5x5 and 10x10.   Of course, AT&T wrote in a recent filing to the FCC   While Leap has deployed LTE in a handful of metro areas, those deployments have been in small block 3x3 MHz or 5x5 MHz configurations that generally support throughput speeds on par with AT&T’s HSPA+ network and lower than AT&T’s more robust LTE network, which typically deploys 10x10 MHz configurations   And, there's always Ericsson who uses the ""x"" to discuss the paired bandwidth options in their LTE white paper."

They only use "" x "" twice.   Case in point, our personal LTE smartphone operates in a 2 x 10 MHz channel in most cities in the United States, including where we live. However, when we visited the Windy City (Chicago) last year it automatically reverted to 2 x 5 MHz since at the time our operator had less spectrum resources for its initial LTE deployment in that market.   Ericsson is using it for [number of channels] x [channel width], not [download width] x [upload width].  So all we've really proven is that nobody really knows which is right."

T-Mobile was a major player in the bid to get more spectrum in the Milwaukee area in the recent AWS auction, but got outbid in the final rounds on a number of licenses. If they don't get a hefty amount of spectrum in the 600 MHz auction, or start to really pioneer the use of small cells, things will only get worse in Milwaukee."

tmobile,3dw5c6,Kidney_Thief1988,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:49 2015 UTC,"Basically, there are always going to be places where people are simply going to overwhelm the local cell networks. Times Square on New Years Eve, or stadiums, for example. With small cells, each node would be serving a small part of that larger crowd.   Ordinarily, distributed antenna systems, or DAS, would take care of this, but even they can get bogged down if the crowd is big enough. Small cells would only cast a signal out 10 meters or so, which dramatically increases your bandwidth per user, making large crowds easier to handle, while providing a much better experience for the end user.  Another benefit is that small cells are low-cost, don't require as many permits (if any) to install, and the installation is easier in general, resulting in a much faster roll out. The problem is the technology isn't mature enough for primetime."

tmobile,3dwjfe,anothercookie90,2,Mon Jul 20 04:32:21 2015 UTC,It is fine for me except for inside certain stores like Costco. Some band 12 tours have been spotted in the area. Not much LTE or even service a little past Auburn up 80.
tmobile,3dwjfe,drmacinyasha,2,Mon Jul 20 04:14:43 2015 UTC,T-mobile works better for me in Costco than AT&T ever did. I was lucky to get EDGE at Costco.
tmobile,3dwjfe,drmacinyasha,2,Mon Jul 20 04:36:59 2015 UTC,"Yo. I drive around Sacramento a lot, live in Rancho/Mather. Occasionally I'll pop up Sunrise to Roseville to go to Vernonside (Riverside/Vernon, it's a major Ingress farm). From my experience, T-Mobile has been very solid in the city, and along the 50 corridor. Once you start getting out towards Folsom, you'll be OK in developed areas, but there are some spots in Folsom and EDH where I've found LTE to be non-existent. However there's also places I've found LTE where it was completely unexpected, like pretty much the entire southern shoreline of the lake.  Building penetration has been so-so. Band 12 helps, but everything feels a lot slower as of late where I need it. B12 has only shown up a handful of times in Folsom for me, and been painfully slow since it's on the edge of its range, and for whatever reason my phone wouldn't drop down to a much faster B4 signal. At work, I'm literally across the street from a tower, with one of the cells pointed straight at my building. I'm lucky to get 2 Mbps on real-world usage of the downstream (trying to stream Google Play Music or Plex) even though Ookla Speed Test (to a T-Mobile server in West Sacramento, of course) says I should be getting 10 Mbps. YMMV, as the tower one mile away delivers 50-60 Mbps at all times.  From my usage of building penetration, unless you're inside Walmart/Costco/WinCo or a dungeon, you're probably going to be fine. Even then, B12 and strong HSPA+ have you covered, and B12 should make things better when there's more of it deployed in the area."

My mom was moving out to He met (North of San Diego) from Ohio. If you are going through the San Bernardino mountains you'll have very little coverage.  Up until you reach California T Mobile's signal does fairly well. I didn't do many speed tests along the trip, but I do remember route 40 being pretty good until I reached Highway 95, to interstate 10. So you will have complete signal loss through parts of the mountains and some of the desserts. AT&T didn't do much better (mom's boyfriend was using them), and mom have Verizon at the time, where all of us at times lossed signal.

If you do not you get a reconditioned unit shipped 7-10 days with a $20 processing fee. Assuming the phone is less than a year old.   You can also call LG if the phone is less than a year old and go directly through them. However they will replace with reconditioned units as well.

I'd pay off the phone and get a G4. With some form of insurance this time.   EDIT: Sorry I think in worst case scenarios and got up way too early this morning.

We have no Band 12 deployed here until later in the year.  One caveat I have found:  There are separate TACs for Band 4 and Band 2, EXCEPT there are some sites that UMTS layers existing that received B2 LTE and it got the Band 4 TAC. And then I have found some GSM -> B4 sites that don't have UMTS layers that have B2 TACs. On top of that, there are 2 B4 sites in that category that have B2 GCIs, meaning end in 11,12,13 but are actually B4.  And finally, due to some limitations with the B2 gear, if it requires a 4th sector, it gets a completely separate GCI with 14 sector identifier.  All that to say, GCI is your most reliable method, but there are discrepancies in both the GCI and TAC that make both of them fallible."

This also extends the I-12 corridor through Hammond, Covington, and part of Slidell.  Within the last 6 months I noticed that the 33643 TAC boundary had moved from Hammond eastward absorbing most of Covington and parts of Slidell north of I-12 mostly. These sites were originally 33641.  Now most of the Band 2 sites have been 33525 in this region, including the Band 4 with no UMTS, and the Band 4 with Band 2 GCIs.  Now somewhat dispersed in there somewhat haphazardly are 33527.  Band 12 will be deployed in 33642 and in 33525 and 33527 I believe.  As far as PCI goes, 33641 saw a huge PCI deal overnight one night. They changed PCIs of 1 sector on each site with no rhyme or reason.

The Good: - m9 is far less laggy - m9 sounds quality is much easier to hear the details and what the person is saying. And the s4 was a step up from verizon with an s3. Mainly on phone calls, but also on the speakerphone.   The Bad: - m9's reception is worse. I have 3 m9's, 2 of them are 4-5 dbm worse, 1 of them is 2-3 dbm worse. My s4 never dropped to hspa+ in my apt, my m9 does on a regular basis, and I've occassionally seen it lose signal completely. :-( - The s4's screen is better. It's more colorful, more pleasing, and more accurate. The m9's screen has a weirdly blue backlight, and certain shades of red (like the magenta in on the tmobile page) are way off. - The camera on the m9 is exceedingly mediocre. I'm pretty sure it's actually worse than the s4. - While the new coating makes the phone grippier, the s4 was still better for being able to hold one handed. - I have had some issues (I think related to VoLte) where in the middle of the call suddenly one side can't hear anything. Don't think I ever had that problem with the s4. - Battery life seems about the same, not really better or worse. The s4 comes with a quickcharge charger (only works with samsung), you'll have to buy one seperately on the m9 if you want fast charge times.  Didn't Change - The one thing I don't like about tmobile is that I feel like their voice quality is - while clear - flat and mechanical a lot of the time. It lacks warmth, it's like Ultron, very clear but mechanical. I'm not sure if another carrier would do better - verizon was warmer, but also very muddy (like Bane lol).  So...wish you luck. :-/ It's somewhat of a disappointing phone frankly, I've thought of getting an lg g4 even though I feel like the phone is to big for my hand.

Which leaves implies always been using it, but leaves open the door to later say ""Oh we meant we used it as soon as it was available, but early models used the older version"".  Either way, whether it's a different physical processor or updated firmware, I know my latest m9 runs significantly cooler and doesn't obviously run any slower. I mean cooler than both my original m9 and also the Samsung Galaxy s6 Edge I had before, both of which got rather warm when performing the initial software updates, the new one does the same updates without getting anywhere near as warm."

Of note, AB License Co holds the 700A license for:  San Diego, CA Las Vegas, NV Phoenix, AZ Tucson, AZ Fayetteville, AR Baton Rouge, LA New Orleans, LA Pensacola/Destin, FL Macon, GA Norfolk, VA  The precedent thus far is that holding companies such as this want to sell everything at once. They can't cherry pick those markets to their liking, though nothing technically prevents that from occurring.  But due to the markets this covers, including San Diego, Vegas, Phoenix and NO/BR I expect that the asking price is higher than Tmo wants to pay at this point, and therefore will wait for the price to come down.

I don't think they will be able to help you though if you need to switch tommorow, takes about 24-48 hours to get the unlock codes.  However, if you've been with at&t for more than 2 years they should provide you with an unlock code or at least they used to provide it.  I switched my iphone 4s and used it perfectly well for 6 months in late 2013 so I think you should be fine with using it in 2015.

tmobile,3duhxz,zakats,5,Sun Jul 19 16:38:12 2015 UTC,"With the new plan you'd be looking at $140 with five lines. Each person would then have 10GB of data and data stash to save the unused portion for up to 12 months. For those on our plan that don't use much data, you could always have them turn on mobile hotspot and help deplete the built-up data when away from Wi-Fi. Say for example on a family trip."
tmobile,3duhxz,pwastage,2,Sun Jul 19 17:25:27 2015 UTC,So you're currently paying $150 before taxes and fees because 4/5 lines have additional data. Your bill will go down to $140 with the new plan.   Call 611 and get your plan updated.

tmobile,3dven1,brontide,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:00:56 2015 UTC,Not updating means loosing out on any potential bug fixes that come with 5.1 or later releases.

tmobile,3dven1,brontide,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:10:44 2015 UTC,But the problem is you will likely not get poor or no voice services since the propagation of 700a is a lot different than band 4.

tmobile,3dugy8,goblue101,2,Mon Jul 20 01:05:49 2015 UTC,Yep the Michigan expansion has been pretty spectacular. I used to get around 20mbps outside and around 5-10 indoors. Now i'm regularly hitting 50+. Some days even 80Mbps.
tmobile,3dugy8,mitten_mike,2,Sun Jul 19 17:44:56 2015 UTC,SE Michigan has seen considerable improvement but unfortunately in my area it's still really hit or miss. Here's to the rest of Michigan getting coverage!

Sprint has horrible speeds at voice quality in most of Michigan.

tmobile,3dv7ar,nobody65535,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:58:45 2015 UTC,tmobile isn't going to unlock it because one of the requirements is that it has to be used on there service for 40 days consecutively. Even if you bought the phone outright.
tmobile,3dv7ar,itwasquiteawhileago,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:45:26 2015 UTC,Tmobile and AT&T's policies are different.

If not, that sucks.  Couldn't hurt to try, though. If it doesn't meet the requirements, they'll at least tell you what it fails to meet. Otherwise, 3rd party may be the only way to go."
tmobile,3dv7ar,blaziecat1103,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:05:38 2015 UTC,"Right.  It isn't explicitly stated there, but the general feeling I've gotten from this sub and from news articles around the time of the policy rollouts in the US is that T-mobile was only taking requests from the original owners.  (That would be covered under the ""may request proof of purchase or additional information in its discretion and certain other exceptions may apply"" clause)  I wasn't saying don't try it, but ""just because it was really easy and no hassle for an AT&T phone doesn't mean the same will apply for a T-mobile"""

tmobile,3dv1nh,celestisdiabolus,5,Sun Jul 19 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but usually when your T-Mobile phone looses coverage or signal, and AT&T is avialbe, it latches on and says emergency only. There are agreements that allow T-Mobile phones pretty much anywhere to roam on other networks only to place 911 emergency calls. I think that AT&T's band 17 is the strongest signal available and your phone's just connecting to it in order to make sure you have access to 911 service which is required by the federal government."
tmobile,3dv1nh,atade15,2,Sun Jul 19 20:00:20 2015 UTC,It's not a roaming agreement thing. You could have a phone with no SIM card and it'll still make 911 calls. More than likely he's lost T-Mobile signal and the phone is registering to the nearest tower it can IN CASE it has to make a 911 call.

tmobile,3dv1nh,saynotopulp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:22:11 2015 UTC,you can't roam on prepaid so you're out of range and connected to at&t in case you need to dial 911. Your phone should say something like Emergency Use Only somehwere
tmobile,3duzvt,Pixileyes,2,Sun Jul 19 19:05:57 2015 UTC,Yes. For me they have been getting bad since March. I really hope its because if infrastructure upgrades. I work near Carowinds and haven't got above 2Mbps for months and often below 1. The one exception is parts of Gastonia. Still getting 35 down there on a regular basis.
tmobile,3duzvt,cadams7701,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:04 2015 UTC,I wonder if they added more people than anticipated for our area in a short amount of time bogging down the towers.
tmobile,3duzvt,GinDaHood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"Congestion sounds likely. Perhaps T-Mobile will shutdown HSPA+ on the AWS band in the medium-term future, allowing expansion of LTE to 15+15."
tmobile,3duzvt,jaminmc,2,Mon Jul 20 02:27:49 2015 UTC,"I think that most towers in Charlotte have terrible back haul for their towers. I have never seen it go above 40 Mbps down, which should be very doable for 10x10.   When LTE was only 5x5, I would always have to use HSPA, as LTE was much slower.  Now, it feels like those days again. Especially around uptown. Theoretically we are getting an additional 10 MHz of PCS spectrum at the end of the month from US Cellular. We'll see if T-Mobile puts another 10x10 LTE on it. That's what I would do. That and kill HSPA on AWS. Imagine 15x15 on Band 4 with CA of 10x10 on band 2. That would be amazing!  Especially since there is no Band 12 in the Carolinas.    T-Mobile should have shut down AWS HDPA here as soon as they reframed it to PCS. As they haven't been here for 7 years, when they bought Suncom. So I bet there aren't too many phones here that have AWS only HSPA."
tmobile,3duvfl,Xtraordinair,11,Sun Jul 19 18:28:04 2015 UTC,Its a roaming agreement so the service will be as good as the partners coverage in that area. They partner with Movistar and some others I think?

Softbank is dead serious on helping Sprint's network improve though and worst yet, they still have another 20+20 chunk they could tie in to that.  Here's an example of how fast this thing is. But this may not be representative of how fast things will be in the future if the other block is unused.  Though we are starting to see carrier aggregation on T-Mobile with band 12 and 4. We will have to wait and see. If Sprint can densify their network T-Mobile will really need to start thinking about doing CA on bands 2 and 4 or doing something like Sprint and tie in 12, 2, and 4."

tmobile,3dtjk4,E90alex,3,Sun Jul 19 15:31:48 2015 UTC,Possible network congestion and/or poor in building signal. What phones are you using? Do you actually show a strong LTE signal? Try outside and see what speeds you get.
tmobile,3dtjk4,cheezenub,2,Sun Jul 19 18:19:15 2015 UTC,Its random. Internet works sometimes. Speed test showed 1.52 mbps down and 9mbps up. We are on the 8th floor 4 bars LTE on s6 and htc one m7. Outside it works fine. Getting about 3mbps.
tmobile,3dtjk4,digitalpirate44,2,Sun Jul 19 09:26:59 2015 UTC,1 down and 9 up is a dead indicator of an overloaded sector on a tower.

Hopefully with the way features of T-Mobile are getting Amped, we'll see an update to the iOS app.  On a side note, the iOS T-Mobile app that's in use for the Netherlands looks incredible compared to the one in the US.

But this only works within the 14 days. But since you are just over the 14 days, this would not work for you. The only chance you would have of T-Mobile price matching would be to call customer care at 611 and see if they will do a bill credit. Otherwise, if you bought it with a credit card then see if your credit card company has price protection."

Since I'm just a couple of days out of that 14 day period they couldn't really do anything for me.

Let's start out with the positive. When reception is good, speeds are fan-fucking-tastic. It's almost on par with my home wi-fi, and my speeds at home are top-tier. Call quality, network speed, etc., they're all great on the Z3C. What's better is that the Z3C has built-in hotspot without needing to pay extra or having to use a 3rd party app, so when I tether to it on my laptop, I can play FFXIV with little to no lag.  On to the negative. There are so many more places where I get low connection speed, places that I used to get decent speed with on Verizon. I'm talking EDGE speed, and at 1 bar too. I can still make calls and whatnot, I haven't had any issues with dropped calls yet, but it's a point of concern for me. Who knows when it'll happen.   Do note that the Z3C is my first and only phone experience on T-Mobile. I don't know if it's better or worse on an official T-Mobile branded phone.

tmobile,3dtaep,tacosalpastor,2,Sun Jul 19 06:21:38 2015 UTC,You should upgrade to the new family plan. It is $20 more for you. This plan just gives the 4th line free. Thats the only downside for you but it would give all 3 lines 10x the amount of data
tmobile,3dtaep,kylemaguire,2,Sun Jul 19 06:37:12 2015 UTC,"With the new family plan that T-Mobile introduced, you can get 3 lines with 10 GB of high-speed data each for $120. It's still a good deal even if you don't have a fourth line to get for free. If you find yourself or others on the account using more than 1 GB of data, it might be more beneficial to switch.  I'm assuming the $100 price you're paying now includes the taxes because the site shows the family plan for three lines with 1 GB of high-speed data each for $90. Either way, I believe that's the best price you're going to get for now with three lines on T-Mobile, assuming you're looking for a cheaper bill."

tmobile,3dqia8,JoeCat3,5,Sat Jul 18 13:51:28 2015 UTC,"Yup. Same thing has been recently happening to me. Several posts over the past few days from various devices and places across the country.  T-Mobile engineering fucked up a software update, I'm sure. My guess from what I've seen is that it's flagging devices at random for depriortization...something to do with tower congestion as obviously only limited reports are coming in and it isn't affecting devices/users on sites that haven't reached their threshold for congestion. When you shut you radio off back/on and reconnect to the tower, it'll re-register your device (maybe at an account level? No idea what they're doing), and restore your speeds.  No idea how this will be fixed. There has to be a way to report this..."
tmobile,3dqia8,Inspirasion,2,Sat Jul 18 16:20:27 2015 UTC,If it was accidentally deprioritizing people you wouldn't see the E or 4G signals in the status bar. The phone doesn't know you've been throttled so it displays LTE even while your speeds remain slow.
tmobile,3dqia8,repens,2,Sat Jul 18 21:05:37 2015 UTC,I was referring to later in his post when he mentioned slow speeds over LTE as that's what is happening with me and several other people.
tmobile,3dqia8,Inspirasion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:18:29 2015 UTC,Ah gotcha yea that seems plausible. Odd that his phone was displaying edge though. Hopefully we see a fix soon because it does seem to be reoccurring
tmobile,3dqia8,repens,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:40:44 2015 UTC,also joecat3 is on a iphone 6+ so its missing the 700mhz a block Band 12 also and that would help take congestion off if there is any for that area. and thats why it jumps from 4G lte to 4G hspa+ then sometimes to edge.

At my workplace I was used to 20 - 35 down and lately i'll be lucky if the speed test doesn't time out and on rare occasion i can get 0.5 down.

Toggiling airplane mode is the only thing that seems to fix it and I agree its very annoying but that seems to be the only fix so far.
tmobile,3dqia8,AimanF,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:49:15 2015 UTC,Having this issue as well in San Francisco for the last few months. Haven't figured out what causes it but an easier way than toggling airplane mode completely is just toggling radio mode from LTE preferred to HSPA and back really quickly.
tmobile,3dqia8,Scarfacemario,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks all for the replies. I guess I'm relieved that I'm not the only one seeing this strange behavior, but also disheartened that it's happening all over - not good to hear that T-Mobile has some weird network issue going on.  I'm not so concerned that the network switches between LTE/4G/E and then to AT&T, that's just a function of not being in a major urban city I guess. The problem with having to toggle Airplane mode just to get service or fix ultra-low speeds with a strong connection is the issue - it's a hassle, and while I can sort of resign myself to it, it'll be a pain point for the family."
tmobile,3dqia8,Thundertime88,2,Sun Jul 19 02:15:51 2015 UTC,"The thing is we never had this problem until the Network Deprioritization started happening. So it might be a bug that will most likely be fixed. Im talking about network airplane toggle. Another thing is the iPhone has terrible terrible radios so the phone switches to LTE,4G,E in places where i never had issues before on my S4. On my S4 i never saw the stupid E i saw LTE almost all the time. Hopefully the iphone6s has better radios."
tmobile,3dqia8,subredditChecker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:13:38 2015 UTC,Also you can add the iPhone 6+ not having band 12. Which is bad.  Since tmobile does own and may even have 700mhz a block deployed in that area. If I was you JoeCat3 I would buy a cheap walmart family mobile 4G lte phone like Alcatel one touch pop. And do a test with that phone and a tmobile sim card in it to see a more stead coverage and to see if 700mhz is deployed yet for that area.you can always resell phone one ebay.

My very first speed test was ~0.5Mbs; toggled airplane mode and it jumped to >20Mbs - same old, same old :).   I drove ~20 miles away (through Hartford and into Manchester for those in the CT area), doing occasional speed tests along the way and watching the LTE Discovery app. No Band 12 anywhere; stayed with Band 4 the entire time. Speeds were pretty awesome for the most part though; and RSSI showed good signal too.  I'm disappointed there's no Band 12 in the area, I thought for sure there would be especially since the map shows deployment in Torrington and Newington, as well as Springfield MA.  I'll continue to play with this phone and see what kind of results I get. It should certainly be capable of providing the best T-Mobile LTE results for the area.

EDIT: The above is only true if the price in store is different than the price online. As of yesterday, the price in store is now the same as online ($479). Since the price is now the same, you should be able to return to the store you bought it at. They should then return your phone, but then sell you your same phone back to you at rhe discounted price. This is how we handle this sort of scenario in our store. We did the same thing with the S6 when the 64gb version went on sale and everyone with 64gb S6s came in to get the lower price."

tmobile,3dr4uj,ramalama-ding-dong,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:25:28 2015 UTC,"Because if you bought it in store and the price later goes down online only and you return it to buy the reduced one online, then we lose money on both device sales and the store gets a higher return rate which equals less commission and less hours and less stock replenishment.

Teeeechnically it can be up to 14 days, though I don't think I've ever seen it actually take that long. I would double check your spam/junk/promotion folders to make sure its not stuck in there, and then have them verify the email address they sent it to."
tmobile,3dsjd0,Zheonic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:17:41 2015 UTC,"I called back, they said it meets all the requirements to be unlocked and on t-mobile's end the request went through. I was told that the e-mail with the code should be sent in the next day or two, however it is unlocked on their end. I'm on an iphone so I don't receive a code, just an e-mail with some instructions. They said they will send the email again. They then sent it to both my gmail and outlook account and was told to check periodically and if I don't receive it tomorrow to call back.  I haven't received it, yet, but from what I remember the easiest way to check and make sure if it's unlocked is to restore the iphone so it will ping the apple servers and then activate it. At least that's how it works on my old iphone.  I'm actually planning on restoring it anyway since I need to update it with the current iOS (every major updates I do a restore).  Should I restore it now?"
tmobile,3dsjd0,Zheonic,2,Sun Jul 19 03:50:00 2015 UTC,"Usually there isn't a confirmation email that the request was submitted, only the one saying it can be unlocked with the instructions. With an iPhone, those are a little bit trickier because of the lack of an actual code, like you mentioned. You can try it now if you want to, worst case is its just not unlocked yet. I would plan on having to do a restore anyway because it usually comes down to it. Just full backup to iTunes, then Erase All Content and Settings on the device, and when you're on the Hello screen, just plug it in and don't touch it for a minute or two. If it works, you'll see that message in iTunes showing you're good to go."

After you pay 1/2 the phone cost you can trade in the phone for a new one.   JoD you lease the phone for 1/24 the phone cost per month for 18 months. At the end of the lease you can either return the phone, or pay the remaining 6/24 of the phone and keep it.  You can also trade in the phone up to 3 times a year which restarts the 18 month lease. It does not include insurance, but you can add it for $8 a month.   Personally I think JoD is a better deal than jump.   There is also the original jump program which is not offered anymore, but some people are grandfathered into it."

tmobile,3dpleb,Ivanovee,9,Sat Jul 18 06:02:32 2015 UTC,"While that's probably true, it's also kinda ridiculous. ""Hey, we're making a lot more money now, how about you make sure we continue making more money?"" ""Nah, why would we want to keep making money off of a company we own?"".  That being said, perhaps waiting for spectrum licenses to get near their expiration date is the way to go. I can only imagine the kind of people who bought them with the purpose of reselling them at hugely marked up values are going to be trying to gouge on the price as much as possible, but panic when the ""use it or lose it"" date gets nearer."
tmobile,3dpleb,RedPill115,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:15:26 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't buying more spectrum, add to the valuation?  It seems l like, done correctly, they could get that money back. If not more."

tmobile,3dpleb,OtherAlan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:20:54 2015 UTC,"It's not simply about spending and then hoping to get it back. It would be an investment.  If they had the spectrum they needed, a future owner could feel confident they're buying the next Verizon, but with far better customer service and PR.  I'm not saying they'll do this. But leaving their investment hobbled and stuck in 3rd place won't fetch the same price.  And if they don't sell, then over the longer term it pays off, too, I'd think. It depends on the prices...  But maybe?"
tmobile,3dpleb,CuriouslyInept,5,Sat Jul 18 20:42:30 2015 UTC,DT is busy cleaning up their Euro operations which are a mess on their own and they also want to buy British Telecom which will cost them probably up to $50 billion if not more than that
tmobile,3dpleb,saynotopulp,11,Sat Jul 18 06:16:34 2015 UTC,"They don't care.  They're looking to sell off, and have been for years.  This isn't a surprise to anyone."
tmobile,3dpleb,entropism,2,Sat Jul 18 07:13:54 2015 UTC,Without a permaroam deal with us cellular and cspire I don't think it's worthwhile to pursue too heavily into band 12. They really need to focus on the upcoming 600mhz auction.
tmobile,3dpleb,skyxsteel,-2,Sat Jul 18 12:57:42 2015 UTC,"DT hasn't invested in TMUS in years. And they probably won't for quite a while. They still have a for sale sign up for T-Mobile, but the price keeps rising."
tmobile,3dpleb,istealthbro,12,Sat Jul 18 13:17:14 2015 UTC,"Can not express how wrong your statements are. DT has continually invested in TMUS. They hired and made John a high paid CEO. They let us keep the vast majority of our profits to invest back into the network.   DT is owned by shareholders. Any board has a duty to review buyout offers to see if it benefits the shareholders. Don't take this as a ""For Sale""  sign. When AT&T offered to buy us at almost twice the going rate, it made clear sense. If someone offered $60 a share for us today they would take it...  The shares are at $38. They are perfectly happy to continue letting our network and price improve."
tmobile,3dpleb,Logvin,6,Sat Jul 18 13:35:12 2015 UTC,"He said invested. There is a difference between letting TMo do their thing and be self sufficient vs DT throwing money at TMo for spectrum investments and network expansion. DT didn't help for AWS3, any 700A and won't for 600. TMobile having to front the cash and debt which they have little of. In the end, without investment from DT, when and if DT sells TMo, TMo is going to be in worse spectrum shape then they are now. :-("

T-Mobile's network here in Los Angeles is superior to Verizon in every way speed, cell density, call quality, and more. In places where Verizon only has 3G EV-DO, I now have LTE mostly band 4 and some band 12 (when needed). All my band 4 trouble spots were fixed by band 12."
tmobile,3drv2w,nicothetechguy,2,Sun Jul 19 02:28:06 2015 UTC,"Do you need service for data or phone? If you're thinking about just the Simple Global international data, its going to be 2G speeds so hardly usable for anything besides messaging apps. If you're going to need it to look up attractions, transportation schedules, maps, etc then 2G isn't really going to cut it unless you want to spend half your trip staring at your phone waiting for it to load and time out. Better than nothing, sure. But if having data is going to be essential for your trip planning then I would recommend just buying a prepaid sim in each country."
tmobile,3drv2w,E90alex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:17:45 2015 UTC,"Name the countries you're going to and which country you're starting your trip in. There may be something you can buy on arrival and use across your whole trip.  Also, consider going with T-Mobile on arrival. In most of the European countries they've set up shop in (except Germany) they hand out data like candy. I paid 15 euro for 10GB of LTE data in Austria. The one thing I don't like is that unlike in America, here they speed-cap prepaid users at 10M up/4M down but hey, it's cheaper than America (oh, and when I accidentally broke my SIM they replaced it for free, just like that. I'm still bitter about the couple of times I've had to pay $15 at home)."

tmobile,3drv2w,jamar030303,3,Sat Jul 18 22:59:49 2015 UTC,"It's not worth the hassle to go T-Mobile now if you're going to be using it overseas straight off. The poster below is right, $50-$100 for low-speed data overseas isn't worth it. But I also find the idea of paying Verizon $25 for 100MB absolutely repulsive, so here's another idea.  If you're starting in Italy (I'm assuming you listed the countries in the order you're visiting them? If you're not, tell me and I can find other recommendations based on where you're actually starting from), all the providers there offer cheap EU roaming add-ons. All are cheaper than Verizon's $25/100MB and should get you through your whole trip with one SIM.  If you go with 3 (ask for the EasyPass add-on), it's only 2 euro a week + 30 cents per call or per 6 hours online for 200 minutes and 500MB anywhere else in the EU (and in America if you haven't used up your credit by the end of your trip).  If you go with Wind (Ask for the Smart Travel or Web Travel Weekly Europe+US) it's 2.5 Euro for 100MB a day, or 15 Euro for 500MB a week.   If you go with TIM (Ask for the In Viaggio Pass), it's 20 Euro per 10 days for 250 minutes outgoing, 250 minutes incoming, 500 texts, and 500MB.  And if you choose Vodafone (Ask for the Europe/Canada/USA Smart Passport add-on), it's 50 minutes, 50 texts, and 500MB for 3 Euro a day."
tmobile,3drv2w,jamar030303,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:37:27 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I needed, thanks. Any suggestions between the three carriers?"
tmobile,3drv2w,jamar030303,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:48:56 2015 UTC,"4 carriers, actually (you are starting in Italy, right? Otherwise we're on the wrong track entirely because options are different in every country), and it depends on how much data you want to use and whether you want to talk and text within Europe.  Vodafone's Smart Passport is nice if you really really like your data. 3 Euro a day for 500MB data alone is worth it if you use that much. The voice minutes and texts are handy if you need to get in touch with locals, whatever the reason.   If you're not so heavy on the data then you can consider 3 EasyPass or TIM In Viaggio Pass.   The In Viaggio Pass is 20 Euro a week, no connection charge.  EasyPass is 2 Euro a week but with a 30 cent connection charge per call or 6 hours of data usage.  You'd have to be charged the connection charge 60 times a week (let's assume you need no more than the 200 minutes a week the EasyPass provides) to make the In Viaggio Pass worth it. Data would cost 8.40 Euro with EasyPass if you have it going 24/7. You can probably save 30 cents a day by turning off data before going to bed and turning it on again when you wake up. You'd have to make 32 phone calls a week to even out with the In Viaggio Pass.   Wind is not worth considering for the weekly pass if you do the math (3 EasyPass is 2 Eur+8.40 Eur = 10.40 Eur for 500MB a week vs 15 Euro for 500MB a week) but if you want to do the 100MB/day Smart Travel pass, it might be worth it (total 700MB/week for 15 Euro).  TL;DR:  Up to 500MB daily: Vodafone Smart Passport  Up to 100MB daily: Wind Smart Travel  Up to 500MB weekly: 3 EasyPass  Up to 500MB weekly and lots of phone calls: TIM In Viaggio Pass"
tmobile,3drv2w,jamar030303,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:19:48 2015 UTC,Hah I feel bad asking but I start in Italy but I'm only there for the day I land into the next day. Then I head to UK. I may or may not be able to stop somewhere in Milan.
tmobile,3drv2w,jamar030303,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about asking. I find looking up these things to be quite fun. Other people don't, so I help out when I can. I get something fun to do, they get the info they need.  Since you're only in Milan for one night, you might just have to get whatever you can get your hands on. Anything purchased in Italy will be cheaper than the UK for a one-SIM solution covering your whole trip.  For example, 500MB of EU roaming data will cost you £25 from EE (a provider formed when T-Mobile UK merged with another local provider). That's over 10 Euro more than TIM's roaming pass, and doesn't even come with free minutes and texts. Pricey.   Vodafone UK wants £3 for 100MB a day, which is about 1.20 Euro more expensive than Wind's daily roaming pass.  Three is free, but only in countries they operate in, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Norway. You'll still have to get local SIMs  (or at least another SIM) for Germany, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Greece."

Your options for buying phones are to pay full price from the get-go, or to use T-Mobile's Equipment Installation Plan(AKA the F-word, financing). EIP lets you get a phone with no down payment if you have reasonable credit, and a down payment if your credit is bad enough. You can also choose to make a down payment above what you're eligible for to lower your monthly payments.

tmobile,3drh8c,Visvism,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:35:35 2015 UTC,I also signed up for JOD when it first came out and of course the store representative told me everything under the sun would count towards a $250 fee upon return to convince me to signup for insurance. Still passed. I'll use a cheap $10 case and be fine.  I can foresee a lot of customers being upset with T-Mobile when they go to trade in leased phones and store reps are left in charge of determining fees. Just seems like they're opening themselves up for bad publicity when a store rep in the middle of nowhere wants to charge a customer for a slight scrape but a store in a completely different area accepts a lease return with multiple dings at no charge.

I missed the SIM card promo, when should I expect for another?    No idea.   *1.1 Is there any real difference between postpaid and prepaid SIM cards or they're all the same until you activate them?    They're the same.   *1.1.1 I used to be a postpaid T-Mo customer a couple months ago, but after meeting unemployment, I couldn't keep up with the family plan bill, and the question is:   Could I get my old number back on a prepaid plan?   I'm 99% sure the answer is no.   *2.2 What if I, for one reason or another, can't afford the $30, do I get downgraded  (assuming I have funds, of course) to the $3 plan?   No.  You just wouldn't have any service, unless you changed manually to the $3 plan.   *2.2.1  And what if I add $30 on said month, do I get bumped back to the 100min/LTE plan on that same month or it'll happen on the next month only?   No.  The $30 plan is for new activations only.  You change away from it, it's gone for good.   *2.2.2  On another scenario: what happens if my 30 minutes and/or texts run out on the $3 plan? Adding $3 more will get me going again or my only salvation will be the $10/week passes?   $0.10 per minute or message.  No cash balance = no calling/no texting.    *2.3 What if I need more minutes on the 100 min/5GB LTE plan?   $0.10 per minute or message.  No cash balance = no calling/no texting.    *2.4 This plan includes Tethering?   I think it's 100 MB/month tethering.  Not sure if that's a hard cap or soft now a days.   *2.4.1 If I go over the 5GB, do I get downgraded to 3G or 2G speeds?   2G   *2.5 The unlimited international texting is for ALL and every country listed or is there some exceptions that I should know?    I assume you're refering to the Simple Choice North America plan?   I don't know if that's compatible with either of these plans.   *2.5.1 Can I stack the Stateside International Talk on top of this prepaid plan or that's only for Simple Choice customers?   Dunno.   *2.6 What if I need to travel abroad, do I get the same benefits/coverage of a postpaid plan or I'd better find a local carrier SIM card wherever I go?   No roaming, international or domestic on pre-paid plans.   *2.7 Am I eligible for a Cellspot router (AKA dat ASUS beast router) on this plan?   No.  Post paid only.   *2.7.1 Is this plan eligible for Wi-Fi calling or that's only for the unlimited (talk) ones?   Yes, but it will count against your minutes.   *2.8 (and last of the item #2!) Toll-free (1-800) numbers will consume my minutes?   Yes.  They're calls.   *3. What if I become so poor but so poor that I can't even afford the $3 plan in a month?  Will I get suspended (as in, ""pay again and enjoy our services again (next month or next day?)"") or canceled (as in, ""didn't have even $3 this month? Fine! Now buy our $15 SIM card,  PLUS AIRTIME CARD and try again bwahahahaha!"")   I believe suspended."

Could I get my old number back on a prepaid plan?   Are you talking about transferring your number? If so, then yes, call 611 for help.   That $30 prepaid plan with 100 minutes and 5GB LTE data is only obtainable         through walmart and t-mobile.com, but how? Buying a specific SIM for that plan or         through activation on these places?   Order a sim, when you go to activate it, make a new account, and choose that plan. It's only available for new users.   Can I buy cards to refill this plan anywhere or only at Walmart/T-Mo website?   You can just add money into an account via debt/credit. If you really want a card, just get a T-Mobile prepaid gift card.   What if I, for one reason or another, can't afford the $30, do I get downgraded         (assuming I have funds, of course) to the $3 plan?   Your account becomes inactive until you refill it again. Service won't work. That answers your next two questions.   2.3 What if I need more minutes on the 100 min/5GB LTE plan?   Add extra money into your account, and it'll take out 10c/minute.   This plan includes Tethering?   Yes, 100mb, then throttled to 2G speeds. (128kpbs)   If I go over the 5GB, do I get downgraded to 3G or 2G speeds?   2G   The unlimited international texting is for ALL and every country listed or is                there some exceptions that I should know?    You can text to all the countries they have agreements with as listed on the international section of their website.   Can I stack the Stateside International Talk on top of this prepaid                         plan or that's only for Simple Choice customers?   Just look, no.   What if I need to travel abroad, do I get the same benefits/coverage of a                postpaid plan or I'd better find a local carrier SIM card wherever I go?   Better find a local sim. No international benefits on prepaid.   Am I eligible for a Cellspot router (AKA dat ASUS beast router) on this plan?   Post paid only, nope.   Is this plan eligible for Wi-Fi calling or that's only for the unlimited (talk) ones   Yes, just have to have a compatible phone.   (and last of the item #2!) Toll-free (1-800) numbers will consume my minutes?   Nope.   What if I become so poor but so poor that I can't even afford the $3 plan in a month?

I've seen other engineers on here comment on how good the G4's radio/antennas are with getting and keeping a good signal.  How would the Note 4 compare to the G4 in that regard?  My current G2 has been really hit or miss when it comes to holding onto an LTE signal.  When I'm in my car I'll often have a Nexus 5 in ""LTE only"" mode doing some Sensorly mapping.  It's pretty common for my Nexus 5 to show an LTE signal in the -95 to -110 range and my G2 will be clinging onto HSPA or EDGE instead.  I'd really love to avoid that with my next phone."

Or buy a Quick Circle case, with Qi charging built in."
tmobile,3dndcw,5iSix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:15:39 2015 UTC,I highly doubt it.
tmobile,3dndcw,t_newt1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:35:52 2015 UTC,"You highly doubt what? LG has always offered Quick Circle cases with options of Qi or PMA builtin. I haven't seen the ones for the LG G4 yet, but the contacts to connect to it are there in the phone.  The sticker AlexusN was talking about is also available (I haven't tried it):  http://www.amazon.com/NeWisdom%C2%AE-Wireless-charging-Cellular-T-mobile/dp/B00YU08SOG"
tmobile,3dndcw,5iSix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:00:26 2015 UTC,"My reply is clearly in response to the person above, Gbcue. That it wouldn't void the warranty. Unless of course you are doing some crazy modding to the phone to get the sticker or case or cover to fit."
tmobile,3dndcw,dumbelts,-5,Tue Jul 21 02:58:43 2015 UTC,"LG has gotten to the point where Samsung was 2 years ago.  Gimmicks. It's all about gimmicks.  However when you advertise a feature I had on the 3GS and OG Droid (manual camera mode in the form of apps) as new and groudbreaking, you show you're running out of gimmicks."
tmobile,3dndcw,RedPill115,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:12:13 2015 UTC,"To be fair, no high priced smart phones seem to be selling that well. The s6 sounds like it's below expectations, the m9 is worse."
tmobile,3dndcw,Interdimension,2,Fri Jul 17 21:44:28 2015 UTC,"The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are. But in the current market, that's the only smartphone I've seen actually grow. Likely because of the updated screen size.  Will be interesting to see if growth continues with the iPhone 6s, or stagnates."
tmobile,3dndcw,RedPill115,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would imagine the bump in screen size would increase sales, but other than T-Mobile and band 12 - how much progress forward could there be in the next model?"
tmobile,3dndcw,sithrebel15,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:10:24 2015 UTC,"The usual shit. A slightly better camera, a modest bump in specs and for this one a display that can tell how hard you press."
tmobile,3dndcw,eneka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:50:34 2015 UTC,I really wanted to buy it when it was released but after being spoiled with Nexus phone prices I couldn't justify the price tag but this is so tempting now...I've been trying to wait for the rumored updated Nexus 5 too..
tmobile,3dndcw,pegleglounge,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:03:16 2015 UTC,"It's no wonder. There's a new flagship coming out every couple of months. The market is flooded with options, and most people don't upgrade their phones at the same rate all these flagships are being released. I don't have $500-600 or more to plop down on every great new phone. I'm upgrading every 2-3 years."
tmobile,3dndcw,rdaex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:54:49 2015 UTC,"Which is the fault of crappy sales reps who it want to clerk phones to people. ""I want an s6"" ""ok""  G4 is the better phone in multiple aspects and people just don't know it.   My store sold 30 of them in two weeks (it's how I won one. Lol)"
tmobile,3dndcw,gamepro86x,10,Sat Jul 18 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"OMG, OMG, OMG!! Thank you for bringing this to my attention :D  I've been ogling the G4, but wasn't willing to spend $600 for it."
tmobile,3dndcw,gamepro86x,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:00:37 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll keep ogling... I still owe $224 on my G2.... and the digitizer has a dead zone, so my resale value is probably crap, and I'd have to get wife a new phone to same issue, one M8 with like $300+ left on it dead stripe on digitizer, meh."
tmobile,3dndcw,velocitaseradico114,2,Fri Jul 17 21:21:57 2015 UTC,Ouch. I just bought my G2 new for $190 so you wouldn't get much for a broken digitizer one..
tmobile,3dndcw,gamepro86x,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:21 2015 UTC,"Yea :( It's one horizontal stripe on the upper half of the screen on mine. Fixing it is silly ~($100) since as you just said it can be replaced for a few more $$... I'll just live with it a while longer.  My wife's is actually much more annoying her dead stripe is vertical so part of the virtual keyboard is a pain in the arse to use (i.e. if you try to type an s it likes to put an a with it), and she can't use back buttons or menus that appear in the top left corner either (thankfully the back button on the menu bar is a workaround)."
tmobile,3dndcw,ricky1030,2,Fri Jul 17 21:34:56 2015 UTC,Does t-mobile not replace those g2 with the digitizer issues at no cost? Sprint's service and repair had that marked as a known issue and will exchange it even if the customer doesn't pay for protection.   Have you tried calling t-mobile tech support?
tmobile,3dndcw,gamepro86x,2,Sat Jul 18 00:10:46 2015 UTC,It's past the 1yr warranty and the water indicator is red so I'm assuming I'm very screwed as far as warranty goes.
tmobile,3dndcw,eneka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:41:02 2015 UTC,Same here...been holding onto my Nexus 5 and didn't want to spend double the price but this is so tempting now...ugh.
tmobile,3dndcw,clintswift,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:03:51 2015 UTC,I just did the same upgrade tonight! My N5 power button has been going out causing unstoppable boot loops. It's a different experience from stock. But the google keyboard and the google now launcher make it feel more at home.
tmobile,3dndcw,eneka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:10:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, my power button did the same but I managed to take my phone apart and fix it....dont want to give up the Nexus experience either.."
tmobile,3dndcw,clintswift,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:17:10 2015 UTC,I plan on repairing the button and either hanging onto it or handing it down. I wanted a NOW solution and I've been itching for something new. Although it really is too good of a deal to pass up! Especially with the free leather cover and battery promo going on.
tmobile,3dndcw,sithrebel15,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:28:44 2015 UTC,I'm feeling the pain especially in the battery. I'm gonna try to hold out for the next set of devices in October/November.
tmobile,3dndcw,qwazzy92,7,Sat Jul 18 07:53:21 2015 UTC,A 20% price drop on a flagship so soon after launch is insane.
tmobile,3dndcw,juiceyb,6,Fri Jul 17 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"Holy shit that's a hell of a deal. Especially since LG is giving away a free battery and leather back if you buy before 7/31.  My guess would be that LG really wants people to buy the the phone before the new note comes out. Maybe the nexus line but there really hasn't been hard enough evidence like the note that it's going to come out in the next two months. Also, this is great for LG even with the whole jump on demand because it makes people check out the G4 who would get a note or iPhone. This is also around the time that the mobile has announced the new north America plan so it should bring in a bunch of people in from other carriers. It's low price point is good since people are getting multiple devices."
tmobile,3dndcw,kinkhunter,6,Fri Jul 17 19:19:10 2015 UTC,This phone supports all of TMobile's LTE bands?

tmobile,3dndcw,a_jaded_triangle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:18 2015 UTC,They won't because he'd have to pay a restocking fee.

tmobile,3dndcw,gamepro86x,4,Sun Jul 19 02:33:28 2015 UTC,Went in tonight and picked up one of these babies. Will be retiring my Nexus 5 with a janky power button.   The rep was even suprised the G4 was already on sale. Paid for it in full in ~20 mins. He also upgraded my 4/$100 2.5GB family plan to the new 4/$120 10GB ea plan with no problem!   EDIT!  New buyers don't forget this promotion is still running until July 31st!   http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/g4/cover-promo
tmobile,3dndcw,BigBlackBert,2,Sat Jul 18 04:08:42 2015 UTC,What is the price for Jump on Demand?  Assuming cheaper than the $19.99 for EIP over 24 months.
tmobile,3dndcw,sithrebel15,3,Fri Jul 17 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"It was 24 prior to the price drop,  so I'm assuming 19 is correct."
tmobile,3dndcw,khaosnmt,3,Fri Jul 17 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"The awesome iPhone deal of $15/mo made me assume the lease option would be cheaper... but it's not. iPhone promo aside, lease payment is the exact same amount as EIP payments, key differences being your allowed to trade back in as long as phones in good condition, and on the downside if you want to keep it after 18 months you have to cough up the last 6 months of payments at once, plus tax."
tmobile,3dndcw,000Destruct0,3,Fri Jul 17 21:24:28 2015 UTC,"This is correct. I did a ton of research and went with jump on demand for the iPhone 6 because they actually only charge me the $15 per month, but pay $27.50 per month toward the phone."
tmobile,3dndcw,acrolos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:20:10 2015 UTC,Lease is good if you like to upgrade at least twice a year.
tmobile,3dndcw,TurboClag,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:55:44 2015 UTC,Damn it! I just got the g4 two weeks ago with jump on demand. Think if I call I can get them to reduce my monthly payment for it (and maybe the extra goodies)?

In fairness,  I was already working with Executive Customer Relations and just  reached out to my contact...so he may have had more flexibility than some."

tmobile,3dndcw,IntoTheMirror,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:24:19 2015 UTC,I ended up getting $60 credit I called 1 more time figured couldn't hurt. She said she couldn't do it since it's past 30 days but for being a customer for 9+ years with basically not account adjustments could offer that so not bad and was happy with that atleast it paid for my taxes on the phone.  Plus the one's who bought early where able to get the 128GB SD card so that has a value as well but that and the battery promo was the only reason I bought it early otherwise I would waited for a drop like this.  Then we find LG to run a new promo in July.
tmobile,3dndcw,angrysnarf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:21:12 2015 UTC,Just picked up 2 G4's plus TMobile's new 2-line family plan with 10GB data on each line for $100 (upgrading from a flip-phone). Been eyeing the G4 for a while due to needing a smartphone for work. Good thing I waited a few weeks!

tmobile,3dndcw,BDestroyer8418,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:57:35 2015 UTC,I bought mine in store.  I spoke with a manager because I talked to one rep and my call dropped  so I called back again and this rep gave me a different answer. I talked to the manager and he gave me the credit.  Their policy for price matching is stupid because he said he shouldn't be doing this but did because I was a 13+ year customer. I had to fight to get the discount

I'm past 30 days at 32 days but I called in last few days waiting for my 1st LG G4 to be cleared from my account since it has to be on EIP to get the credit.  Told me to go get the tablet and manually adding $100 credit to my account.  So my next month bill will be free.

tmobile,3dp11y,GinDaHood,3,Sat Jul 18 07:57:04 2015 UTC,Highly!   It's a gorgeous phone. There are I would say 3 shortcomings that make it slightly weaker than a flag ship phone:  1) BATTERY - for most people without rooted optimization it is drained very quickly. This is primarily and issue with version 5.0 (and we know that 5.1 is coming soon). I'm rooted and my battery easily gets me through the day with 18 hours of standby and 5 SOT.  2)Speaker: its not quite as strong (but hey its loud enough to wake me up)  3) vibrate: its kinda weak sauce. It's a fantastic touch feedback vibration system. But in your pocket you can barely feel it.  But are those things with an extra 459$ no IMO. Very happy with my purchase.
tmobile,3dp11y,FR4NOx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:54:10 2015 UTC,A fourth shortcoming would be its lack of band 12 LTE.
tmobile,3dp11y,Knightan,3,Sat Jul 18 14:22:24 2015 UTC,True. However I'm not in an area where that is a problem (as you can see from post ;) )
tmobile,3dp11y,Knightan,2,Sat Jul 18 15:40:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what's keeping me from it, especially since my market just got approved for band 12"

tmobile,3dqik7,Knightan,3,Sat Jul 18 13:58:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Where do I find out if DC has band 12, and if the iPhone 6s or 7 supports band 12 for T-Mobile?"
tmobile,3dqik7,icepick_,9,Sat Jul 18 14:10:30 2015 UTC,DC does have Band 12.  The new iPhone is  ** assumed ** to support it.
tmobile,3dqik7,areallytallguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:13:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. What can I look for whenever the technical specs are published for the new iPhones to verify?
tmobile,3dqik7,999mal,10,Sat Jul 18 14:37:30 2015 UTC,Apple will list the bands supported right on their site.
tmobile,3dqik7,Cjaiceman,2,Sat Jul 18 14:56:22 2015 UTC,Someone will likely post it to this subreddit as soon as it comes out.
tmobile,3dqik7,PerformanceGM,2,Sat Jul 18 18:30:12 2015 UTC,Apple should update this link whenever the new specs are announced: https://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/
tmobile,3dqik7,MBHockey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:58:19 2015 UTC,Look to see if LTE Band 12 is supported. If so then you're indoor coverage should dramatically improve in areas where deployed.
tmobile,3dqik7,PerformanceGM,6,Sat Jul 18 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"not directly answering your question but I recently switched to Verizon for the rural coverage even though I live in NYC. I was expecting Verizon to be a lot better indoors in the city as an added perk, but it's about the same. some indoor places it's worse, some it's better. I think this whole indoor coverage thing with T-Mobile is overblown. and I was someone who would think about switching every time I had no service inside a bar. but it happens just about as often with Verizon."
tmobile,3dqik7,therealgariac,4,Sat Jul 18 13:58:23 2015 UTC,"In our case, both I and my wife have colleagues with Verizon and ATT who get good LTE coverage within our offices. I get 1-2 bars of 4G, which dips to no coverage when I'm in the middle of our office floor. My wife gets consistently zero coverage.  Not to dispute your findings -- these cellular reception issues are so dependent on geography, building structure and phone model."
tmobile,3dqik7,Ravenstown6,6,Sat Jul 18 14:09:45 2015 UTC,Alot of this is the iPhone radio itself. I can't count the number of times my brother gets kicked to HSPA inside buildings while I stay on Band 4 LTE on my Moto Nexus
tmobile,3dqik7,jonginator,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:24:38 2015 UTC,"The problem with the iphone is the metal case. As long as a metal case is perceived to be of value, the radio will always be poor. The iphone is simply not a device for fringe reception.   I hike a lot and have done three rescues of people getting lost and dealing with no cellular reception. I use my BlackBerry to contact their parents/friends, then guide them out."
tmobile,3dqik7,StarManta,2,Sun Jul 19 15:02:47 2015 UTC,It varies definitely.  Tmobile in my area is super inconsistent and forced me to switch :/
tmobile,3dqik7,FR4NOx,2,Sat Jul 18 14:22:04 2015 UTC,"Perhaps ever so slightly overblown...   The thing is that T Mobile is very network dense and they haven't slacked on density of their Band 12 rollout in areas where they have the license to do so.   So those two things combined give arise to the strong potential for very very good building penetration, probably even better than Verizon and AT&T."
tmobile,3dqik7,therealgariac,2,Sat Jul 18 15:19:47 2015 UTC,"We won't know if the 6S will support band 12 until Apple announces it in September-ish. Since Apple has been very friendly with T-Mobile lately, I'd be surprised if it didn't, but it's also possible that it's not logistically feasible to add it until the 7."
tmobile,3dqik7,therealgariac,5,Sat Jul 18 14:20:50 2015 UTC,"Why do you say that? The 5s supported a ton more LTE bands than the 5, and the 6 had even more than the 5s. I'm confident Apple will add Band 12, especially since they currently brag about the 6 supporting the most LTE bands."
tmobile,3dqik7,RedPill115,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:40:11 2015 UTC,How deep are you in the Apple eco system? Iphones generally have poor radios.

tmobile,3dqik7,blaziecat1103,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"Radio quality has never been a priority with Apple. Basically you have to live with the reception problem. Regarding working, does random reboots count as working?   You may want to consider becoming a Verizon customer if you want to stick with the iphone. They have the most towers and very thing is low band. Of course your phone bill with double. ;-)  Dis Android al you want. I'm running QNX."
tmobile,3dqik7,angrysnarf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:54:31 2015 UTC,"It's definitely possible, but no one can say for sure unless it's working or not working.  Band 12 covers around 4x the area that band 4 does. Thing is, if you're right next to a band 12 tower, then it really penetrates into the building better. But if you're not - and if you're further away from a band 12 tower than you would be a band 4 tower - it doesn't really help at all."

AWS-4 can be used as 20x20 paired or two 20 MHz downlinks. In 2015 25x25 MHz AWS-3 spectrum auction raised $44.9 billion. Talk about striking gold.

I know it's a little better in the surrounding area can hit 30 down but usually I get max 5 down by me.  It works but I also have Wifi at the house so I just use that but would be nice to see if improved since my Wifi doesn't reach far outside of the house.  I'm not sure if where I live if my Tower get's hit by alot of Tmobile users or what.  Since I'm so close to the Airport not sure if that is the same tower or what?

They will most likely deploy it first in rural places far away from major populated areas where there is no OTA TV. Like Stone Lake, WI. It won't happen that fast though. Because the equipment manufacturers don't know how much spectrum will be freed until the auction ends that will delay the development of the standard, network equipment and compatible phones.

tmobile,3dnmch,googlecacheguy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:27:24 2015 UTC,"That's Charlie Ergen for you. In my opinion he doesn't know how to finish a deal. He failed with Clearwire, with Sprint--I think there were other deals too. It seems he's so insistent on getting the greatest deal, he doesn't even realize the downsides for Dish if he doesn't get any deal at all, then it all falls apart and he ends up much worse off than if he gave a few concessions.  I've heard he thinks of himself as this great poker player. He doesn't seem to realize that he's not playing poker against TMobile, he's playing with TMobile against Verizon and AT&T, and they are beating him hand after hand because his ego keeps getting in the way of seeing the big picture. I might be wrong, but that's what it looks like to someone looking from the outside.  In my opinion, the FCC will force him to sell off his spectrum in a fire sale (there's a deadline he has to meet to actually use it--sometime next year) and he's going to end up losing billions of dollars. It will serve him right."

tmobile,3dnelr,danrant,5,Fri Jul 17 19:16:23 2015 UTC,There is an upper boundary: beginning of the auction (Q1 2016) + duration of the auction (3-6 months) + auction post-processing (about 3 months) + relocation of all stations (up to 39 months) = first half of 2020. Probably not what OP wanted to hear :)  I expect a) T-Mobile to sign concurrent operations agreements with all remaining stations b) in the unlikely case they can't do that T-Mobile and other A block license holders to push the FCC to schedule ch.51 station relocations to be first in line (that may still require some other stations to move first) so many relocations may complete in the first half of 2017.

tmobile,3dnelr,jaminmc,2,Sat Jul 18 04:47:07 2015 UTC,"HSPA+ and LTE are tuned not to overlap too much because otherwise the adjacent cells would interfere with each other too much in the middle. All cells broadcast on the same frequencies.   EDGE channels are not broadcast on the same frequencies so the cell coverage can overlap heavily, the signal can be stronger and overall coverage is more uniform and seamless. The downside of that EDGE wastes at least 75% of spectrum if not more (a cell has at least three neighboring cells)."
tmobile,3dnelr,Mcnst,2,Sat Jul 18 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"Not only that, phones are programmed to drop down to the older technology when the signal is weak. LTE weak, switch to HSPA. HSPA weak, switch to Edge.   With my iPhone 6, when I go into Food Lion, it works in the front of the store. If on LTE, it drops to edge, then the further I go back in the store the worse the signal till it drops.  If I lock the phone in LTE only, it stays on LTE, and drops in about the same spot.   I use Lock4gLTE to lock my phone in LTE mode. I even have Only3G which allows me to be in HSPA/UMTS only."

tmobile,3dmlv8,50atomic,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:33 2015 UTC,"Good thought, but that's the exact reason I haven't upgraded my iPhone to the latest iOS.

My understanding is that I can upgrade to iOS 8.4, and continue to use ""iTunes Radio"" (NOT ""Apple Music""), but I'm not 100% sure of that.    That's why I'm holding off on the iOS upgrade (hopefully, T-mobile will eventually officially support ""Apple Music"" on Music Freedom - then it will be safe to upgrade).

tmobile,3dmlv8,OffhandOnion,4,Fri Jul 17 14:52:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you stream music for hours at a time, you'll pull more album art/etc, which will increase your data usage.

tmobile,3dmlv8,goaliemn,2,Fri Jul 17 15:14:17 2015 UTC,"An additional note: the usage amounts I listed were for 3 days at the start of the month.  I have a 1 hour 10 minute commute to/from work each day.    I listen to iTunes Radio for most of that.  So, that's 2 hours 20 minutes each day max.  Yes, that'll pull down more album art/text than listening for (for example) 1 hour a day.  But, it's the AMOUNT of data being counted as ""non-music"" that is the problem: T-mobile has said that non-music data (such as album art) accounts for approx 1-4% of the data usage.    The Music app is using 261MB of data.  1-4% of that would be 2.61MB-10.44MB.  T-mobile seems to be counting 96MB of the 261MB (37%) as 'non-music' data.  It really seems that there's a 'bug' in T-mobile's system that decides whether a piece of data is 'music' or 'non-music'."
tmobile,3dmlv8,ed2417,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:19:52 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, and I guess I should say this is not an official statement, the way music freedom works is through an agreement with the provider, not through packet sniffing. My understanding was that we agree to whitelist certain IP addresses when counting your data. This means that if Apple changes their system and doesn't notify T-Mobile (or it takes T-Mobile a while to add that address) then that data will count against your allotment."
tmobile,3dmlv8,angrysnarf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"That is a reasonable theory.    But, even if true (agreed-upon list of iTunes Radio IP addresses to 'whitelist'), it's still (IMO) T-mobile's responsibility to continually get updated IP address lists from Apple (if, in fact, they are changing them).    T-mobile advertises today that iTunes Radio is part of Music Freedom.  It's not up to me to track IP addresses used - as a customer of T-mobile, I expect that they are doing whatever is required to make sure that all iTunes Radio music data is 'free' (regardless of which IP address(es) it comes from).  This brings me to a question: is it possible to get T-mobile to give me a list of IP addresses/amount of data pulled from that IP on a given day?  If I go to ""my t-mobile"", and access my ""data usage"", it only shows ""Date"" and ""Usage"" (in megabytes) (it doesn't even narrow it down to ""Date/Time"" - just a bunch of separate entries for the same Date.  This is true even in the "".csv"" downloadable usage file.  Not enough information there to analyze.  Is there an email address/contact at T-mobile with knowledgeable people on the subject who can address this?  I've tried ""tech support"" (on the phone) and ""online chat"" - they were useless (and seemed pretty clueless on the entire subject)."

tmobile,3dnpss,Domini384,2,Fri Jul 17 19:33:16 2015 UTC,Not necessarily.  iOS doesn't support band 12 so he won't see any benefits from towers using it.

tmobile,3dnpss,DudeThatsErin,3,Fri Jul 17 20:32:59 2015 UTC,It appears AT&T disabled band 12 in LG G4. Compare that with SGS6. I expected them to do that :(

Even with only an LG G3 and no band 12 my coverage is much better and faster than it ever was with Sprint. If you get a phone which supports B12 you should receive especially good service. If you need reliable coverage when traveling everywhere in state and nationally though, they may not be the best choice. But, since their phones can be unlocked, you can for instance also use other networks like Cricket which uses AT&T in a pinch."

Since they said you can use a Voice line Sim card that has data in a tablet, but you can't use a Tablet Sim card in a phone even if your just trying to use data.  Atleast from what I've been told.

Started stuttering for no reason. Had to swipe away all the apps in the background for it to stop.  Probably would have been fine with stock Android.

Phonearena is reporting it has SIM card slot but not sure if it can use any of Tmobile Bands or if it really does have sim card or not.

I believe I saw a way at xda for root will have to read through that thread.  Wonder if any custom rom's are in the works.  Basically for $160 after the credit it should be comparable to the Nook HD+ that as well had 1GB of Ram.  Didn't find much of an issue on that tablet for what I use it for.    You can try installing NoChrome http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-nochromo-wild-browser-appears-t3130776   I have it on my G4 and been great.

Is this because of the 1GB of ram which is not really available in full 1GB to us after the OS they maybe really should of went with 1.5 min not sure why they didn't just use 2GB is it that much more for an extra 1GB.    So far it's not bad will test it more but from what the store said $75 restocking fee if returned ?   Netflix ran fine on it and Wifi is fast with my 5G wifi. I found that it  is getting a stronger 5G signal then the G4 phone.  G Tab 150 Mbps link speed compared to G4 117 Mbps.  LTE signal is the same 3 bars which is better than my Note II only could get 1 mar or none in the house if in basement always had wifi calling on.

Yeah I got 2. One for my dad as well. He's older and probably only does one thing at a time and hasn't had a Lollipop device before so I think he likes it. For what the cost is (ie free), with just the mobile tablet data match plan price, I'm not angry at it, but annoyed that I can't use it for my day to day activities since I hop back/fourth into one other app quite often. I would be super pissed if I actually had to pay for it though.  And yeah it's the RAM with LG's crap running on top. Android Lollipop CAN run fine and not do this with 1GB of RAM (I have a Moto E 2015 and I can switch several apps before it having to redraw like this).  If there was a way to put stock Android on this, I'd be 100% happy with it. LG isn't stupid, they knew how this would perform, and put 1GB of RAM with their UI on this on their low-end (F series is low to mid-range) tablet. Their G Pad series has 2GB.  I've had mine for a few weeks and it might not annoy most people but when I have my $30 Moto E running practically stock Android not pull this crap, I get incredibly annoyed using it, just knowing that it's LG's garbage UI that makes this unusable for me.  I would really like a custom ROM to get it functioning, but since the bootloader is locked I doubt this will happen anytime soon. :/  And yeah. $75 restocking fee.

tmobile,3dl89u,goaliemn,6,Fri Jul 17 18:59:08 2015 UTC,Minnesota (particularly the Twin Cities) is a overall a pretty decent T-Mobile market.   The Twin Cities is one of the best T-Mobile markets in the US in terms of quality of coverage. The tower density here is fantastic and as a result speeds haven't changed since T-Mobile first deployed the original 10x10 LTE in 2013. Plus the Band 12 overlay is nearly complete in the metro so building penetration issues aren't really a thing anymore either. Frankly all 4 carriers are quite competitive here but T-Mobile is a notch ahead of everyone now that Band 12 LTE is live across most of the metro.   They do have a lot of work to do on rural coverage here. They've been much slower here in upgrading towers to LTE compared to other states but I imagine there are issues getting backhaul that are slowing down the upgrades. Southwest Minnesota is also not upgraded yet. I-94 is mostly done though through and I-35 to Duluth is also mostly complete.

tmobile,3dnq6l,zakats,5,Fri Jul 17 19:53:27 2015 UTC,"Sometimes employees are able to provide vague reassurances.   Is this area regular ol 3g or are your peak download speeds closer to T-Mobile's ""4g"" hspa+ 14, 21, or 42?  My reason for asking is that you might come to find that your speeds have improved significantly while still on a 3g which would indicate LTE arriving shortly thereafter. It's just something to keep in mind."
tmobile,3dnq6l,zakats,2,Fri Jul 17 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"I actually was contacted by a eng who wont be named or mentioned about general status. I wont mention what was said for his privacy.  I will say, my current 3g is pretty much old 3g.  Sprint level 3g bad, too.  In my whole time being on tmobile I have never seen speeds above 12 or so down/up even on LTE. The 3g speeds are about 0.5 down and .25 up,  which struggle to load emails most of the time.  Ive found myself able to get used to the 12/mb speeds in my hometown, as I used to be on sprint which was similar. I came over, though, because of the people who would have 100mb down tests and such"
tmobile,3dnq6l,atade15,3,Fri Jul 17 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you might have already gotten the rundown in that case. You might have a HSPA 14(mbps) carrier which probably won't last.  Your area is probably limited by backhaul and old equipment. I imagine that you should expect LTE upgrades by the end of the year.   In addition to what Danrant said below; Cookeville has 10(x10) mhz of AWS (band 4) and 10mhz of PCS (band 2) spectrum available. The PCS spectrum will probably be refarmed to add a faster 3G tech to the existing 2G. In this case, all of the AWS would be used in a 10mhz LTE carrier that would give you speeds closer to >50mbps as long as the backhaul (local internet provider) can support it.  On the other hand, if tmo were to determine that there isn't enough need for that sort of capacity, they may just speed up the current AWS 3g with better backhaul and install a new ground unit for the 2g antenna which would allow concurrent 2G/LTE on the same antenna. The result would be 80% of the benefit of the above but at a much lower cost... and your peak LTE speeds would be in the neighborhood of 35mbps.  Edit: I live in a college town that was in a similar situation a few years ago. I think we have 5mhz AWS LTE and my speeds are, at their lowest, around 12mbps but usually upwards of 20. I hope they do some rearranging in the near future, I used to be able to say that it dipped to around 25 at its lowest."
tmobile,3dnq6l,danrant,4,Fri Jul 17 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"Exactally, you shouldn't be paying for a service that doesn't work for you. That's probably you best move. You could try Cricket or some other pre-paid service and that's what I would do if I were in your shoes. Once T-Mobile does have LTE in your area, you can test drive it and see how it works, but I wouldn't keep paying for sub-par service especially If sprint's solid in your area."
tmobile,3dnq6l,dumbelts,2,Fri Jul 17 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of pre-paid.  Having a nexus does have advantages (especially a nexus thats from google play store).  I will have to give it a look.  I stream lots of music, So i just need to find something unlimited since I wont have music freedom wherever swap to.   Thanks for the idea! Ill be looking into it. I was wanting to port my number over to google voice anyways to get VoIP with my tablets."

tmobile,3dirfl,wwtectmo,17,Thu Jul 16 16:38:45 2015 UTC,It's across the street from a B41 tower. I didn't see more than 10-15mbps from their in store units.   T-Mobile is averaging around 40 Mbps during lunch time. AT&T is slightly higher at around 50-60 Mbps. Verizon was in the same ballpark.   All four carriers have stores in this area. Sprint blows.
tmobile,3dirfl,evan1123,13,Thu Jul 16 16:45:48 2015 UTC,10-15Mbps is very respectable. 40Mbps+ isn't gonna make any difference for the majority of smartphone tasks.

tmobile,3dlko2,PerformanceGM,2,Fri Jul 17 08:10:40 2015 UTC,For the most part sounds good but the M7 will be trash on T-Mobile as it doesn't support any of the LTE bands.  Also you can trade in literally any non broken phone for the ETF reimbursement. It's the EIP reimbursement that requires the IMEI tied to the EIP  Make sure you reactivate your phone you plan to trade in on the VZW iPhone line before you trade it in just to be safe.   Not sure about the feature phones for the 3rd line. Also can't imagine they'd be able to get leave the 4th with no IMEI assigned.

tmobile,3do91e,FR4NOx,2,Fri Jul 17 23:23:14 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't be a big deal. I used a Verizon Note 4 that didn't fully support AWS HSPA+ (just the 2100MHz frequency) and it flip-flopped between that and 1900MHz 3G for uploading/downloading. It was the weirdest thing, but didn't affect usability.   I think LTE band 2,4,12 support is much more important."

tmobile,3dm7u2,hipst,10,Fri Jul 17 12:10:52 2015 UTC,"the unlimited plan is pretty clearly identified as on network. The speed is limited to the network you're roaming on, you won't get anything faster than HSDPA+ since there's no LTE roaming agreements in the US. Not sure what to tell you, but rural coverage is not a strength of T-Mobile"

I don't know how the technology works but I would hope that the system isn't implemented in such an inferior way in this day and age where it uses a static position instead of something like a GPS.  I would hope that it would fall back to that data if it wasn't possible to get your location another way (GPS, cell towers).  But like I said, I know as much as you.  I would just hope the technology were designed better."
tmobile,3djyo3,Clutch_22,3,Fri Jul 17 02:19:06 2015 UTC,Per the link in the OP: Your location is one of a number of methods which may be used to route your 9-1-1 call and provide your location to the designated 9-1-1 Communications Center.  It sounds like GPS should be one of the methods but OP wanted authoritative answer so I didn't bother to point that out.

tmobile,3djyo3,DarkyPoo,-1,Fri Jul 17 07:42:15 2015 UTC,"You have to update the E911 address regularly when you travel to different counties, states, and countries for the correct emergency dispatch centers to be contacted, if needed. Updating it is quite easy for both iOS and Android devices. Here's a link on how to do that.  https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-3255  For iOS devices, simply open Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calls > Update Emergency Address and then simply enter in the address at which you're located and tap ""Save"" on the bottom right-hand corner of the page."
tmobile,3djyo3,joe012594_official,3,Thu Jul 16 23:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm well aware of how to update the location. But do you have to do that every single time you connect to a wifi network in a different PSAP coverage area? That's crazy, not really documented as a requirement, and I don't expect that anyone actually does that. I wouldn't be surprised if T-Mobile's 911 location accuracy is decreasing as wifi calling usage increases."
tmobile,3djyo3,joe012594_official,0,Fri Jul 17 00:08:44 2015 UTC,"No. You don't have to update it. You'll just be rerouted through dispatch to the right area if you ever need emergency services. I would change it if you're traveling outside of the USA, though."
tmobile,3djyo3,joe012594_official,2,Fri Jul 17 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"So if you do want to have the correct location, you have to update it. Otherwise just hope that you eventually get transferred to the correct dispatcher and that they can find you? That's not a good solution, wastes valuable time in an emergency, and is not compliant with E911 standards."
tmobile,3djyo3,dsulli37,0,Fri Jul 17 00:23:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's a bit of a hassle. I think a better way they could set things up is to incorporate E911 into the Wi-Fi Location Service (Settings > Privacy > Location Services > System Services > Wi-Fi Networking). GPS still works on Wi-Fi networks, even without cell service, so it would make sense to do that and have it auto update every so often, which would make things less complicated and more convenient. Downside to it might be battery life though."

tmobile,3djglj,5pixelguy,4,Fri Jul 17 01:17:27 2015 UTC,the 4 for $100 promo was the last one that allows a government discount... they got wise and decided if you take a promo plan you can't stack discounts (first one like this was the 2 for $100 unlimited plan).  This means switching from the 4 for $100 2.5GB promo w/ govt. discount to the 4 for $120 10GB promo will cause your bill to go up $35 ($85 disc. price for old plan to $120 on new plan).

tmobile,3dkvzx,iProcreate,3,Fri Jul 17 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"Was a RSA for 3.5 years before I was promoted to RAM.   They're pretty flexible however managers tend to like those with open availability to have the freedom to schedule. But I've worked with a lot of people who also went to school and it was never much of an issue.   Hours are based solely on you. You earn your hours, so to speak. The harder you work and show your value, the likelihood of more hours increases. Usually part timers start at a minimum of 20 hours and full timers at 30.   As far as training? You'll have training at a training store for the first two weeks. You take a lot of online classes revolving around TMobile and then shadow/practice on the floor. However your training really never ends. The company constantly changes so you'll be learning all the time. However when you first start out, making sure you listen to your peers and take your training seriously is important.   Quota is different per store. It depends on whether you're in a low volume or high volume store and your quota would be adjusted then as a part timer and how many other employees there are. However from what I've seen in my market, lower volume quotas range anywhere from 17-25 acts per rep and high volume anywhere from 38-60. Again this does depend on the store and the region you're in."
tmobile,3dkvzx,Dinobiscuit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:24:00 2015 UTC,Yeah the hiring manager/store manager I spoke to said at times there's month long training programs and mandatory meetings roughly every two weeks. How long did it take them to offer the job to you after your interviews? I'm taking summer classes and have ~3 weeks left and I'd hate to choose finals over mandatory training.
tmobile,3dkvzx,Dinobiscuit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:28:57 2015 UTC,"Well I was hired over 4 years ago so my memory is a bit foggy. I do remember it taking a bit of time though. I applied and passed the preliminary test. Waited a couple days then called and had an interview with the store manager. He liked me and wanted me to have an interview with a training store manager so I did. A couple days after my second interview I called and he offered me the job. So probably a week and a half-two weeks total until I got my offer letter.  The training I went through was completely different than what employees do now but my training was done at my home store. It lasted a week and then I was put out on the floor to shadow for a week and then practice and help the following two weeks. My second month on I was on ramp up.   As far as month long trainings? I've never heard of that. There may be times where we have extensive training on one thing or another (eg Jump on Demand) but they never last a month. Mandatory meetings are definitely region and district based. Our store meets twice a month, for example. Management and leadership go through much more trainings than reps do. However reps are required to complete trainings via our training website when they launch."

I've never added jump without a customers permission but it doesn't surprise me it happens. Sales is stressful and fleeting.

tmobile,3dkurr,OffhandOnion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:36:12 2015 UTC,"Higher capacity for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus require a down payment. They do this partly so that there's pretty much one price per model. iPhone 6s cost $27.08 per month regardless of the capacity. The 6 Plus costs $31.25 per month regardless of capacity. I think we'd all like it if you could take that down payment and put it on the bill, but I have to imagine that they have some reason for that."

We currently are focusing on covering our 2G areas with LTE, and expanding where we can. One year ago, if you left Buffalo on the 90, you'd drop to 2G when you hit Hamburg. Now you an make it all the way past Dunkirk (with a small exception @ Silver Creek).  We've also added coverage in Olean, Gowanda, Springville, and other smaller cities south of Buffalo.

tmobile,3djg0l,OtherAlan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:44 2015 UTC,There is also no 'unlimited' data option. All you get is 10 dollars buys you another 10GB.
tmobile,3djg0l,anothercookie90,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:48:07 2015 UTC,You are better off with the $10 monthly fee to add it on
tmobile,3djg0l,wwtectmo,0,Thu Jul 16 22:46:36 2015 UTC,You also get Free Music Streaming on the 10GB Plan  This is a good plan if you need more data and $30 per line for 10GB is pretty decent comparing to $20 per line for 2.5GB of data  You can also double your data for additional $10
tmobile,3djg0l,wwtectmo,2,Thu Jul 16 19:55:02 2015 UTC,I thought my current plan also got Music Freedom.

tmobile,3djg0l,freddudek,0,Thu Jul 16 21:40:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the discount should still work. I thought T-Mobile pretty much grandfathered those on the discount. Just they would need to verify every year. New customers can't add corporate discounts, only government employees can."
tmobile,3djg0l,toxicbrew,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"Did you actually confirm this with Tmobile or are you just guessing (your phrasing ""should still work"" indicates you're not really sure) ?

If I can keep my 15% discount due to it be grandfathered in, then I'll switch in a heartbeat."
tmobile,3djg0l,MrBamHam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing. When T-Mobile originally announced they are getting rid off corporate discounts, there was a huge backlash from current users. So they send out a card yearly to renew it if you were already receiving them. I received a card back in March or April to renew and I'm on the promo 4/$100/2.5gb.   I'm not switching my plan anytime yet so I can't actually confirm it."

I am currently in Canada in Victoria and Vancouver, both of which are listed on the T-Mobile site as having 4G LTE. I automatically connect and it never gives me the 4G LTE. It connects usually to Telus with a 3G signal. So I manually connect and I can detect Rogers, Telus, and Bell all with LTE but I can only connect to Bell LTE and it says 4G LTE as my signal when I do, but never have I once had actual 4G LTE or anything close to it. I am basicall getting the exact same speed I would normally be getting on the global throttle roaming. I called yesterday and they tried to help me but kept saying that they can't gauranee the network speed or quality since it's not heir network....totally ridiculous if you offer a service it should be provided. I understand maybe it's not blazing like T-Mobile LTE, but it should at least be 4G or at minimum 3G not 2G. They are giving me the run around. Any help? Possible APN settings change?

I'm personally sticking to the 4 lines for $100 as it allows gov discount still... the switching cost for me isn't just $20 ($120 vs $100) it's $35 ($120 vs $85), and I'm in the same boat all lines have 2.5GB and it's enough. In fact with my discount to get to $120/mo I'd have to bump all 4 lines up to 4.5GB to hit that (won't happen parents don't use much).  That's why I caveated the above comment saying if you need more data or the Canada/mexico thing it may be worthwhile since he's already paying $130/mo."

Two of us have 4.5 gb from a promo when we signed up a couple of months ago. The other four people have 2 gb. I am asking about the new Simple Choice North America Plan: Unlimited Talk + Text.  Edit: I did some looking around on their website. Would it just be better to add the North America Family Feature to my current plan for $10?"
tmobile,3dimef,mu5ic92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"Oh I misread that so 6 lines... current plan should be $140 then due to the 4.5GB bump on the 2 lines. the new promo plan would run you $160 for 6 lines (10GB ea). If you just went the non-promo standard simple choice plan you could get 6 lines as low as $120 they would all have 1GB and no data stash. If you bump 2 lines up to 3GB you would be sitting at the same as you have now just with less data (1GB vs. 2.5GB, and 3GB vs 4.5GB). The 3GB lines would have data stash, all lines would have Canada and mexico coverage."

When nTelos doesn't consider the efforts significant, you know it's basically token coverage. nTelos does a pretty bad job with their own network.  http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/ntelos-adds-8000-subs-q1-migrates-50000-subs-sprints-network/2015-05-01"
tmobile,3der6l,evan1123,2,Thu Jul 16 04:48:05 2015 UTC,Probably for this license expiring in 2017. Another explanation for their lack of interest in North WV could be because they have ridiculously small amount of midband spectrum there (20 MHz total). In Charleston they have at least 40 MHz so it's as bad as in Milwaukee.

With such a variety of devices it would be a HUGE help especially for the BYOD and unlocked crowd (but even applicable to T-Mobile's own offerings), to be able to see just Band 2 and Band 4 coverage, or if you have a One M8, Galaxy Light, OPO, etc., filter to just Band 4 and see where you have coverage and where the gaps are.

You all have done awesome stuff in the past and aren't stopping, that's great. I really appreciate the work you all have done, and I hope it continues. Now for some criticism and what made me slightly upset. I purchased this back in I'd say February or March. In April, I got my iPhone factory unlocked. This was back when iOS 8.1.2 was the latest firmware which could be jailbroken. I was told that to use another SIM I just had to pop it in and I was done. That wasn't the case, and so it was just in a ""searching"" loop. It continued doing that and when I popped my T-Mobile one back in it  continued the searching loop. I decided to reboot my phone, and so I was met with the red screen of death and a boot loop. I essentially lost my jailbreak with that. Not a problem, I could wait for a few weeks. After restoring with iTunes my unlock was properly completed too. Fast forward to now when I have had a jailbreak for almost a month, and I want the CarrierCrack again. I go back in the email, try installing the .deb and lo and behold I get an error 256 because iOS 8.1.2 is the highest supported firmware. I see I have an older version want to get a newer .deb file for my phone so I can use the CarrierCrack again. I emailed you guys but I got no response to this date. Here's what can be worked on - Communication with customers, and notifications of an update for customers who opt in. In an unrelated note, LTE only mode made the short dialer codes (like #WEB# or #MSG#) not functional, calling 311 had issues, and MMS also had some slight issues.  All in all I do support the cause and I am impressed by the work you all have done but if you could fix this so the $3.99 I spent wouldnt have gone to waste I would really appreciate everything. Thanks :)"
tmobile,3dkima,Alex_Maxwell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:55:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about the troubles you had on 8.1.2. Rest assured, it wasn't due to the CarrierCracks. I experience this issue myself and have had to restore as well due to this ""Searching..."" loop issue. The underlying cause of this is CommCenter Patch never being fully implemented into CommCenter. It was half-assed, to say the least, and ONLY patched a select few signature checks in the carrier files. There were many things and cool features that I wanted to bring to the table, but CommCenter behaving the way it was on iOS 8, it wouldn't allow me to do so. I've got a really talented/smart developer on the case right now of updating CommCenter Patch properly and we will be releasing this to everyone to ensure things run smoothly this time around. When we have the new CarrierCracks available for 8.4, you'll be the first to receive one. For your other ideas, reach out to /u/djenglish2014 at dennis@itweakios.com and he'll take down your recommendations/ideas. Thanks! :-)"

tmobile,3df3nz,nymax12,6,Wed Jul 15 20:15:25 2015 UTC,that's a lot of sites O_o
tmobile,3df3nz,anothercookie90,5,Wed Jul 15 20:22:34 2015 UTC,I love that they are putting them on buildings and not like on an actual tower. I think its really cool that they want to go in deeper into the city and put up sites throughout the city. This is neat! Can I get one of those put on the telephone pole right outside my window?
tmobile,3df3nz,JimmithyWeav,14,Wed Jul 15 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"In dense urban markets like NYC you most likely won't ever see tower like structures as that wouldn't be very effective in terms of coverage and capacity.  They all opt for rooftop mount or side building mount, and in NYC T-Mobile specifically has extremely dense grid that they've been building for decades due to the lack of low band spectrum.  Now they can enjoy fruits of their labor, having the most deployed LTE capacity per subscriber here."
tmobile,3df3nz,JimmithyWeav,3,Wed Jul 15 21:31:49 2015 UTC,being from little ol Wayne County Ohio I am not used to this lol. I hardly go to large cities so I always look out for towers rather than just the equipment! So this is really cool to me!
tmobile,3df3nz,nk1,11,Wed Jul 15 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"I absolutely understand that. It's typical for operators to have tower structures throughout the U.S. as it's easier to cover large area. Except in dense urban where tall buildings make towers very ineffective. They wouldn't be able to cover large areas in NYC, nor provide optimal street level coverage. This is why rooftops of 2-4 story buildings make more sense here.  But going forward I think the ideal solution for dense urban will be low & dense utility (light) pole small cells, operating under the macro umbrella. I think next year we'll see much more aggressive Small Cell deployment around the globe as the interference cancellation techniques get better."
tmobile,3df3nz,imc225,6,Wed Jul 15 21:47:33 2015 UTC,How do they manage interference between small and macro cells currently?
tmobile,3df3nz,JimmithyWeav,8,Thu Jul 16 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"Operators use Inter Cell Interference Cancellation, basically doing the best to avoid each other.   Vendors should begin including the enhanced version (eICIC) in their products next year, as a core LTE-Advanced technology.  As of right now T-Mobile doesn't (need to) have a large scale Small Cell deployment, but with LAA this could change starting next year. By 2020 hyper dense outdoor small cell networks will hopefully become the reality in the U.S."

tmobile,3df3nz,B3astofthe3ast,5,Wed Jul 15 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"They're upgrading the entire NYC area. Check the pics from my OP so you can be on the lookout.  Typical sites would have two or three thin square antennas per sector (APX-16). The L700 capable antennas they're adding in NYC are the same exact height, just rounder and slightly thicker.   They're either 4 or 6 port antennas."

tmobile,3df3nz,GinDaHood,3,Thu Jul 16 01:59:21 2015 UTC,"I really hope this is the explanation as to why my service has sucked since first switching from AT&T back in April.    When I first switched the speeds were GREAT.  I always had LTE on my iPhone 6+ in the beginning and couldn't understand why people would associate TMO with horrible service to justify the low cost.  I pushed friends and relatives to jump (no pun intended) on the #UNCARRIER stuff and switch from AT&T.    That was then, this is now.  Fast forward to roughly the past month or so and my service feels like it has DRASTICALLY declined.  If I am out and about (it seems that) all I see is 3G/4G when I look at my status bar.  When I was on AT&T I literally saw LTE everywhere and up until this started with TMO recently I could have sworn that is all I saw was LTE too.    Don't get me wrong, I don't mind things ""getting worse before they can get better"" but if this L700 progress or whatever isn't the reason why my service has declined then I am going to be feeling some serious regret and frustration with my decision."

tmobile,3df3nz,ShowerBeer-,3,Thu Jul 16 14:30:29 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that the issue you're having has nothing to do with L700 deployment as the process started on June 16 and they have 80 sites scattered around NYC that aren't even transmitting yet.  I live in Astoria and work in Manhattan and I don't have issues similar to yours, which suggests that your device may be the problem.

tmobile,3dgaz1,BarFighter,4,Thu Jul 16 04:00:08 2015 UTC,"Just a warning, this works for T-mobile but sometimes it doesn't work for other online stores. Even if the package was delivered, you can take it right back to your local UPS store and say you refuse the delivery. They will write REFUSED with a permanent marker and give it to the delivery driver when they pick up packages that are waiting to be picked up for the day. Some stores may not do this (I've been turned down once, but was able to hand it to the driver at the store because it was the end of the day)."

I was also told by a rep on the phone to accept the package, open it, and put the return slip on the package for a quicker process. While it did process quickly, there was obviously a lack of communication between warehouse and customer service, something about a memo should have been placed in our customer account and it wasn't...and our account was suspended rather than canceled. Hence the payments. This is totally a lack of communication thing."

tmobile,3dgaz1,musicisme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after this settles I'll be writing a formal complaint to John and to the company as a whole. My family felt really bad - we kept our sales person well past closing time, as she was dealing with customer service too and trying to resolve it - even she knew it was BS. And she totally understood why we weren't going to switch at this time. We wrote a letter to the store manager to let him know how great of a job she did...so hopefully she will be commended or given a raise or something.  I'm glad to know that we aren't the only ones (or one of the unlucky rare ones) to have this happen to. Honestly, I think it's their tracking - the fact that they didn't cancel the account outright shows how little communication there is between all the working pieces of this company.  Believe me guys, I WANT to switch (despite a guy in the comments saying you don't want my families 5 lines of business) - but this whole thing has been very stressful and not exactly the way I'd want to start the relationship."
tmobile,3dgaz1,sryguys,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:09 2015 UTC,"UPDATE...  I wrote to John Legere on Friday, and on Monday evening received a call from the Executive Response team. I'm so glad I followed some peoples advice here and contacted him personally - he (or someone else handling his email) made sure that this was taken care of.  We got the entire situation solved, and reassurances that this was a one-off bad situation. The person who worked for the team said that there was probably a disconnect between the warehouse and the account management team, which is what I assumed at first. And she said customer care really should have escalated the response to executive response once they realized there was an issue.  Anyway, I'm just glad my family won't be charged for services we didn't use, and we're also grandfathered in for the 4/$100 line plan for 60 days, should we decide to join T-Mobile (which I think we will now). I just want to thank you all again for being super supportive and helping me work through this, and letting me vent my anger :) Me and my family will hopefully be breaking free from AT&T very soon!"
tmobile,3dgaz1,musicisme,-7,Tue Jul 21 20:26:57 2015 UTC,Not to be a dick but if you returned the phones because it didn't come with an envelope to send your old phones in then you fully deserve it. This would of took one call to get fixed. You sound like the biggest dick in the world honestly. Please stick to your current carrier we don't need people like you.

If it is a feature you plan on using moving forward it might be best just to move to the $80 plan to guarantee it'll work and of course you'll also get more hotspot 7 GB vs 5 GB is that matters to you. If you just plan on using it temporarily than its perfect the way you did it. :)

I might rile up some of the Tmobile employees by saying this, but they know it's true. I used to work for At&t customer service and Sprint customer service. At neither place did they hire the brightest bulbs in the shed. They can't because they pay low wages. In fact a significant number of workers would give out just plain wrong advice and I'd cringe. Add to the fact that this is a new program, this is to be expected.   And then there are the offshore agents. Many of them think that New Mexico is not in the US and that Baja California is just another name for Southern California.  They have no idea what the cell market is like in the US and they try to fit it into their own cell market of the Philippines. I know I lived there for 3 years.   I say get your info on new plans here because more than likely the Tmobile employees on this sub are actually bright bulbs and mostly know what they are doing."

But even adding the $10 kicker to 20gb that gives me 4 lines at $110 vs 4 lines at $180. The other 3 lines don't use that much data.
tmobile,3dgctd,sirrenitee,2,Thu Jul 16 01:41:05 2015 UTC,Are you positive you changed to a 4 line family plan? My understanding is that the $100 here only covers the price of 2 lines only. Any additional lines will cost $20 each which will total to $140 for 4 lines with 10GB each. And then there is a new promo that brings the $140 down to $120 (4 lines for price of 3 promo).

Cotangent(angle to top of tower) times distance to center of tower equals height difference between tower and sextant. Add height of sextant, you have the height of the tower.

I don't want them walking about the door with something that will inevitably end up bringing them back into the store for trouble shooting.   EDIT: Forgot to mention that the HTC Desire with 16gigs internal is satisfactory.
tmobile,3df6ef,Inspirasion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:25:20 2015 UTC,The T-mobile variant only comes with 8GB storage since it is the 626s.   Looks like T-mobile raised the RAM on their Grand Prime to 1.5 so it's the same resolution as the Avant just slightly bigger screen.
tmobile,3df6ef,50atomic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:20:18 2015 UTC,"Considering the Avant already has a garbage screen I don't really want to know what a ""worse screen"" is."
tmobile,3df6ef,Inspirasion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:42:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's garbage it's not great, especially if you put Google Now launcher on it.  It looks much nicer with nova launcher in my opinion.  Google Now Launcher looks fuzzy as hell at least on the home screens"
tmobile,3df6ef,50atomic,3,Wed Jul 15 23:30:53 2015 UTC,"Desire 626s - 1GB of RAM  Samsung Galaxy Core Prime - 1GB of RAM  Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime - 1GB of RAM  No, no, no. Dealing with a 2015 Moto E with Lollipop and 1GB of RAM on what is basically stock Android, you do not want an Android device with the manufacturer's skins (HTC Sense, Samsung TouchWiz, etc.) running on top of it. You can barely run two apps at once without it having to reload apps.  Good example: LG G Pad F 8.0 offered for Father's Day. Lots of tech packed but because of the 1GB of RAM and LG's UI running on top, apps are constantly killed and I get redraws all the time from the stock launcher (home screen crashing and reloading apps). It is annoying as crap. Random lag and glitches due to the limited amount of RAM.   The Moto E I can deal with it a bit as it isn't redrawing the home launcher all the time and because Motorola was smart and didn't heavily skin the UI, it's not a terrible experience for a low-end device. But not for any other manufacturer that decides to overlay all kinds of garbage on a low-end device.  I'd stay away. Android can run with 1GB of RAM, but not when manufacturer's add their skins on top of it, heavily bogging it down."

So reading all those posts back in December about how they called the Refer-a-Friend line and nothing was working and their credits would never come through and T-Mobile royally fucked up implementing the promotion and... here I am with my working plan because of one simple call to care.  With that said, when it came to the question of whether or not I would lose said credit switching to Simple Choice North America: corporate had absolutely no clue. They just said ""That's a great question, let me do some digging and I'll get back to you in 48 hours."" Fingers crossed for an email today."

There was nothing to indicate that T-Mobile was subsidizing the cost of the phone. At least with ATT/Verizon the fact that the carrier is subsidizing it is fairly obvious, given the 2 year contract. Since I knew all of T-Mobiles iPhones came unlocked and unsubsidized, I assumed this was true for all of their phones. Also, I specifically told the rep in the store what I wanted to do with the phone and he never told me that it was locked (of course he wasn't under any obligation to, it just would've been nice to know).

tmobile,3dfhau,zakats,2,Wed Jul 15 22:39:47 2015 UTC,try this   turn it off and on again dial * # * # 4636 # * # * tap phone information tap the first drop down menu and find an option that either says LTE/GSM auto (PRL) or LTE/WCDMA/GSM auto (PRL) or similar as long as it includes those things. You might try LTE only or GSM only just to try something different and then switching back to one of the options mentioned earlier.   This is almost the same as going through the settings menu but is a bit more of a precise way of tinkering.

Most convenient too - stop by any Wal-Mart or Target and you can purchase what you need, all pre-paid.  In addition, Straight Talk can bounce from many different towers, so you might get the best reception out of the bunch.  I had no issues with my hotspot that I use on occasion."

tmobile,3ddpd8,icepick_,3,Wed Jul 15 14:12:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the lack of detail. I've only just starting to test out everything.    The hotpot is the ZTE Z915. My phone is an iPhone 6 plus.  I opened up the hotspot here at the office so I haven't tested it anywhere else. It shows five bars and the configuration screen reports a -90 to -100 signal strength.  Using speedtest.net, I'm averaging around 1.5mbps down on the hotspot with a latency around 30. On the phone here at work, tests have ranged from 1.5mbps down to about 3 mbps down. Interestingly, the ping on the phone is much worse - around 140. The phone works fine elsewhere in Metro Detroit (not the LTE speeds I was used to on VZW, but okay -- the highest I saw this morning was around 15mbps down). Given where I'm located, I would highly doubt it is network congestion. For those of you who know Detroit, I'm right across the street from the Fisher Building. For those of you who aren't familiar, this isn't right downtown and is not a particularly densely populated area."

And you only get slower data speeds if you used 21gb or more and you are in a congested area. Once congestion goes down you should be back to normal. It could be your device.

tmobile,3deucl,jaminmc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:06:16 2015 UTC,I believe this is no longer the case after the FCC settlement.
tmobile,3deu8a,rchiariello,3,Wed Jul 15 18:44:22 2015 UTC,The $80 one only gives you 1GB High Speed data on each line and then unlimited data at speeds up to 128 kpbs afterwards.  The old promo gave unlimited High Speed data on each line.  There is also a new 2/$100 plan that give 10gb High Speed data on each line.
tmobile,3deu8a,sirrenitee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for clarifying. How bad are the regular data speeds? Also, I'm only seeing the 10GB plan for 4 lines minimum."
tmobile,3deu8a,sirrenitee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:33:44 2015 UTC,I actually don't know since I never use up the High Speed data. The 4 lines one is an extension to the new 2/$100 promo for $120 that gives each line 10GB for the price of 3 (ie. 2/$100 +$20 per line).
tmobile,3deu8a,hiromasaki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm only seeing the 10GB plan for 4 lines minimum.   It's available for 2+ lines.  4th line is free (via bill credit) if you sign up for 4+ lines before Labor day.  It's also only via phone for right now."
tmobile,3deu8a,anothercookie90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:10:05 2015 UTC,2 lines for 100 got unlimited data without a throttle cap  2 lines for 80 got 1 GB throttle caps.   The new 2 lines for 100 gives users 10 GB each before throttling
tmobile,3deu8a,Vivicurl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:39:11 2015 UTC,I think that depending on whether or not you will be getting new phones you won't be saving much money with T-mobile.  I tried the 2/$100 for a couple of months and with my husband's EIP it was still $140 a month since I couldn't use my gov't employee discount.

tmobile,3det7p,DudeThatsErin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:28:51 2015 UTC,Yeah
tmobile,3det7p,hiromasaki,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:51:38 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile doesn't do ""upgrades"".  You just walk in and buy a new phone, then switch your SIM over.  If you don't want to pay everything up-front, they offer 0% 24-month financing.  They have JUMP! which guarantees trade-in value of a financed phone will cover the balance, max 50% of original value ($10/mo, includes the $8/mo insurance).  Then the new Jump!-on-Demand is a lease that you can return early up to 3 times a year."
tmobile,3dennc,ShedtheLight,2,Wed Jul 15 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to presume, as the other commenters did, that you plan on stiffing T-Mobile on the balance, but rather that you're talking about carrier lock.  If that is the case, the Note 4 should have an unlock app on it.  Here are the requirements for performing an unlock.  Getting a SIM lock removed no longer requires ""magic"", just a phone call or some patience.  Your phones will work on AT&T or Cricket, but getting Verizon to activate them (if they're even compatible, I'm too lazy to check right now) will be a chore."
tmobile,3dennc,hiromasaki,2,Wed Jul 15 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"The remaining balance on the phones becomes immediately due. As romuo stated, if you don't pay the balance, the amount will be sent to collections and your IMEI will be blacklisted in the National IMEI database, so you won't be able to use it on another carrier, until the balance has been paid off and T-Mobile removes the IMEI from the database.  No unlocking involved. Have fun with collections."
tmobile,3dennc,Inspirasion,2,Wed Jul 15 18:23:59 2015 UTC,They can blacklist the imei number so you  can't use with other providers and they will send you to collections. You  essentially owe them the full retail price for phones. However if you switch to some carriers they may have a way that they can pay off your debt to tmobile if you trade in the phone.
tmobile,3dennc,romuo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:47 2015 UTC,"Plus, as I have recently found out, T-mobile will not unlock your phones until you've paid at least half of the phone off."
tmobile,3dehfd,Jaramie3,4,Wed Jul 15 17:16:21 2015 UTC,That's correct. No discounts on promo plans.
tmobile,3dehfd,aduckbilledplatypus,3,Wed Jul 15 17:35:23 2015 UTC,"That is correct, promo accounts are already a discount so corporate discounts are not allowed.  Only on the base plans are they allowed"
tmobile,3dehfd,Domini384,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"Similar experience. Third party store told us we could keep it on the 2/$100 plan. And we were able to keep it. Then one month it was just gone. Rep on the phone told me as such that the corp discount isn't supposed to work on those plans.  I did the math on switching back to a regular plan where we would have different amounts of data. Even with the discount, the 2/$100 plan was cheaper with us having 4 lines."
tmobile,3dehfd,bickman2k,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"Same here.  I tried the 2/$100 when it first came out and had 2-3 different T-mo employees tell me I could use my discount.  When I got the $140+ bill on the next cycle, I found out I was wrong.  It took calling yet again to put my plan back to the way it was for an employee to finally tell me that I couldn't use the discount on the promotional plans."

Keep in mind that if you need to use your phone for data, while free the speeds are crippling. You may want to grab a prepaid sim from one of the English carriers to use for data/calling and then swap in your T-Mo sim if you get a phone that supports T-Mobiles WiFi calling.   Pretty sure the Nexus 4 doesn't have T-Mobiles WiFi calling though so you may want to investigate a prepaid sim or other voip options.  http://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phones/wi-fi-calling.html  (I'm not 100% sure how good their site is at filtering features of phones but that should give you an idea)"

tmobile,3ddn3o,RedPill115,2,Wed Jul 15 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"They're both really good phones, the only reason to switch is if the g4 is physically to big for you (it's to big for my preferences but other people like it). In my experience the earpeace sound quality is better on the g4, and the cameras seem to be about the same, I'd stick with the g4 if you like the size."
tmobile,3ddn3o,Noirof,2,Wed Jul 15 15:28:36 2015 UTC,"Im an employee. I have the G4. Most of the employees at my store have the G4. The two employees who did get the S6 both ended up returning it because of screen and battery issues. Ive had no issues with my G4. Camera on it blows away the already impressive one on the S6.   Also, to me, using the touch wiz operating system on Samsung devices feels much like using a fisher price toy (like those things babies sit in with all the buttons that make funny noises). The LG operating system feels much more sleek and professional."

I had an xperia z1s on JUMP 1, but some insurance messup wouldnt allow me to file a claim and i couldnt jump with that phone.  I purchased the Nexus 6 on EIP and later was able to jump to something else a few months later.  The only difference here is that is when i look on my Tmobile account, both of the phones show my number attached on the EIP. This may be the thing that stops you."
tmobile,3d8zx1,rfn17,17,Tue Jul 14 13:06:16 2015 UTC,Wouldn't this be worse for people on 2 people unlimited for 100?
tmobile,3d8zx1,DaPenguinThief,19,Tue Jul 14 13:13:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it is a little better than the 4/100 deal"
tmobile,3d8zx1,FR4NOx,13,Tue Jul 14 13:31:53 2015 UTC,Assuming people want to spend an extra $20 every month. Or even more per month if they have 5-10 lines since every line is $20 minimum instead of $10.
tmobile,3d8zx1,anothercookie90,5,Tue Jul 14 13:37:03 2015 UTC,"I'm debating this right now, especially as I still have the corporate discount. I pay $136 for 7 lines, 5 at 2.5GB, 2 at 4.5GB, and the $10 CAN/MEX add-on. It would be $180 for us to go to the new plan, or around $8/month/person on average to upgrade."

tmobile,3d8zx1,ohjacobk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:57:08 2015 UTC,"Similar boat with corporate discount and 9 lines all at 2.5GB for $170. No one uses all the data, but I know we all had unlimited on Sprint previously and didn't have to worry about going over.  New plan with 9 lines and the 4th being free would be $220 a month before taxes/fees. Would go from $19 a line to around $26 a line after taxes/fees. Not a huge jump, but losing the corp discount and the legacy 2.5GB plan makes it tough."
tmobile,3d8zx1,g_schrage52,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:18:58 2015 UTC,You can't use a corporate discount on these new plans?
tmobile,3d8zx1,Re-toast,3,Tue Jul 14 19:54:25 2015 UTC,Nope... :(  4/$100 -> 4/$120 will really cost you ~$35-40 more factoring the loss of discounts.

And I know that this offer has been extended for life for those that have it. I just wanted to ask if you got a corporate discount on top of this promotion? No one told me that I could get a corporate discount too. I just assumed since this plan was special that I couldn't get a corporate discount.
tmobile,3d8zx1,WhatWhatTech,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:26:17 2015 UTC,Here is from the latest bill.  Corporate Volume Discount ($18.00)

tmobile,3d8zx1,swg0101,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:17:53 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly.  I have four lines. Two that use a lot of data and two that barely use anything... Not sure if it's worth $20/month extra. I did get excited when they said the first two 10GB.. etc.
tmobile,3d8zx1,TheMokaPot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have a chat w/ my parents tonight about whether we want to switch to this. It'd be $30 more for 5 lines than our current 5 lines plan with 2.5GB each. That's not bad, and the Canada/Mexico thing is a nice bonus, but how often are we really gonna hit 2.5GB? It's nice 'cause with Data Stash this will turn our plans, effectively, into unlimited plans. Most months we use ~1.5GB each, so we'll stash a shitton.  The biggest problem we've had is just shitty reception in certain locations and running out of the paltry amount of roaming data you get without even knowing that you'd started using it. If anything, I'd rather have 2.5GB that can also be used on T-Mo or AT&T than 10GB that can only be used on T-Mo, but that's obviously not gonna happen.  This is a tough call."
tmobile,3d8zx1,dark_roast,2,Tue Jul 14 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't switch if you don't use more than 2.5GB regularly.   It's $30 extra a month and in my case, that's an extra $20/month, which equates to $360 and $240 a year respectively.  It would be cheaper to just buy extra data passes on those months you really need extra data and MWB on months you plan on traveling."
tmobile,3d8zx1,TheMokaPot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:18 2015 UTC,It's an extra $5

tmobile,3d8zx1,angrysnarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:13:03 2015 UTC,dividing it by 4 doesn't mean it's not $20 more. It's $5 increase per line but that's still a big increase.
tmobile,3d8zx1,anothercookie90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:19:58 2015 UTC,When spread across the number of lines its only $5 per line more for 7.5gb that's nothing
tmobile,3d8zx1,angrysnarf,3,Wed Jul 15 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"Depends on their needs. For me, definitely would be worse.  For people that only ever use 5-7gbs and call/go to Mexico or Canada a lot, this would be great since it will include the new international business."
tmobile,3d8zx1,tom1226,3,Tue Jul 14 13:18:40 2015 UTC,"Actually it wouldn't be better, its only $10 to add that on the 2/$100 plan. So you save $10 even if you dont use more than 10gbs"
tmobile,3d8zx1,Domini384,2,Tue Jul 14 14:07:46 2015 UTC,The $120 is for 4 lines. It's only $100 for 2 lines.

For me, im sticking with the 4/$100 offer and dropping my $5 stateside promo and adding the without borders option tomorrow for $10 which will raise my bill another $5 a month.   This new promo would cost me $10 more a month for alot more data but if I break 1GB a month now Im using alot, I just dont have a need for more data.   On a side note, anyone know if changes made online will take effect immediately or are they set for your bill end date? Id like to immediately add the without borders option tomorrow when it's available."

tmobile,3d8zx1,turn-down-for-what,9,Tue Jul 14 15:59:53 2015 UTC,I consider myself a fairly heavy data user...  I actually went back and checked my data usage for the last year and myself and my g/f have only ever gotten within a few GB of 10GB one or two months out of the year. Usually we hover between 3GB & 5GB.  So while Unlimited is arguably better... 10GB + Data Stash + no overages isn't a bad deal at all especially for users like us who want the freedom to get above 5GB when we need to but usually hover lower than that and would end up racking up rollover data.
tmobile,3d8zx1,benpike,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:03 2015 UTC,Would this new plan qualify for corporate discount?

If you go to a spot with congestion T-Mobile postpaid gets dibs first, then T-Mobile prepaid, then you know those other guys like Family Mobile who's using the network..."

tmobile,3d8zx1,Ducktart,9,Tue Jul 14 14:24:29 2015 UTC,"Unlimited data is the only way to do it in todays world. You don't see people flocking to t mobile a sprint for 10gb no they do it because thre one of the few left with unlimited.

tmobile,3d8zx1,bradley129,16,Tue Jul 14 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"But ISPs can provide unlimited data much more easily than wireless carriers can.  With wireless, available spectrum is limited and costly.

tmobile,3d8zx1,nk1,0,Tue Jul 14 15:29:17 2015 UTC,Capacity is in high demand and the 1# from what we seen is to put a cap on that capacity.
tmobile,3d8zx1,bradley129,7,Tue Jul 14 16:10:45 2015 UTC,T-Mobile is not capping they are increasing price from $100 to $140. That's how the market works. If a limited resource is in high demand the price increases.

Hmm  Wonder if roll over applies to this as well as the employee discount. But I digress.  T-Mobile does need to be more competitive and needs to upgrade their basic limit plans to 5, 10, 15 or something like that."

tmobile,3d8zx1,Freak4Dell,0,Tue Jul 14 20:18:16 2015 UTC,"It's just a marketing move for better comparison with Verizon etc.  You gotta give it to Mr. Legere, though -- he keeps increasing the prices ($120 in place of $100 for 4 lines) and reducing the value (10GB+10GB for $100/2 in place of Unlimited+Unlimited), yet still gets the whole crowd excited about all of this.  I mean, people might not know that Unlimited 4G is really Unlimited 4G at T-Mo, so, an explicit 40GB does actually sound impressive (although implicitly, Unlimited 4G is still currently pretty-much guaranteed to 21GB, but 10GB is still pretty good for at attracting attention of customers familiar with AT&T and Verizon).  It's frankly amazing how he does it.  He's one piece of the CEO. :-)"
tmobile,3d8zx1,Mcnst,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"This is replacing the other 4/100 deal, not 2/100 unlimited. Both are still offered."

tmobile,3d8zx1,_FluX23,4,Tue Jul 14 15:00:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, similar boat here.  Two lines with smallish data buckets, one of which is never more than 50% used, the other hits its cap most months.  I suppose this plan will benefit some people, I'm just not one of them.  I'd really like an inexpensive, modestly sized pooled data plan.  EDIT: I'd guess that asymmetric data usage is pretty common in families.  I'm kind of surprised that ""family"" plans don't try to target it more."
tmobile,3d8zx1,ralusp,3,Tue Jul 14 15:05:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think the $20 increase is worth it for us because we'd never be using 10GB anyways. Two use around ~100 MB a month and I use about 700 MB. But there is one who always hits the 2.5 GB within the first two weeks because the person doesn't have WiFi. If that person could use the remaining 7 GB in our bucket that would be awesome.
tmobile,3d8zx1,_FluX23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:08:00 2015 UTC,"I originally thought this was what they were going to do actually, the ability to distribute the amount any way you want is a plus.

tmobile,3d8zx1,swg0101,2,Tue Jul 14 15:20:15 2015 UTC,"They need a ""gift"" your unused data option - like you can send them a text or something ""gifted"" your extra 1gig or something - so that the data hogs on your account can't use it all but you can give them your extra if you know you won't use it."

tmobile,3d8zx1,_FluX23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:26:46 2015 UTC,"But it's the whole deal why so much could be offered -- that it's all averaged out.  If you think about it, however, normally, $20 extra per month would only give you an extra 4GB; with this new deal, you'd instead be getting 7,5GB extra, and not just for one line, but for all 4 lines.  If you did need more than 2GB extra on any 2.5GB line of 100/4, then this 120/4 is really a great deal for you!"

tmobile,3d8zx1,dark_roast,3,Tue Jul 14 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"The previous promos were taking their competitors offerings and doing similar for way less (i.e. AT&T's $160 for 4 lines T-mobile did for $100), now their raising the pricing back up toward competitor level and just offering more. (i.e. $140 for 4 lines (once 4th line free promo goes away for 40GB $140 on T-mobile vs 10GB $160 on AT&T).  If you really use that much data it's a great deal, if you don't the 4 lines for $100 is better.

Your comment makes no sense -- individual plans already have a difference of 2GB per each $10 increase in price, so, if this somehow was a-la-carte, you'd pay $20 to upgrade from 2.5GB to 6.5GB of a single line.

If you want to switch to 4 lines 10GB each, that'll be $120 if you switch soon, so if it's worth $20 more for more data / Mexico+Canada / data stash you should do it. If not, keep on keepin' on."
tmobile,3d8zx1,dark_roast,2,Tue Jul 14 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"7.5 GB more on each line, plus Mexico+Canada + data stash for just $20 more is a really good deal. I'm really tempted to switch now."
tmobile,3d8zx1,WorkReddit98,2,Tue Jul 14 18:27:26 2015 UTC,Wait a minute.  I thought those 2/100 and 4/100 lines fell under 'Simple choice' plans but with some sort of promotional pricing? things are starting to get complicated again plan wise for tmobile...
tmobile,3d8zx1,OtherAlan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"Those are the current plans, but they go away tomorrow and there are entirely new plans in their place. It's a bit confusing when looking at it 4th dimensionally, but in terms of what is offered at any one time, I think it'll be pretty simple."
tmobile,3d8zx1,dark_roast,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"No, I do understand them perfectly and start/end dates for them.  I feel that these 'special' plans they are offering like 2/100 unlimited or 4/100 2.5gb are misleading because they should be based off the simple choice plans, and all the amped stuff get added on to simple choice plans without complications; But they don't.  Adding lines to these plans also have a different cost compared to adding to a simple choice account. They dont get uncarrier amped '1.5' which is free Canada + Mexico without ponying up another 10 dollars. I would start to suspect they aren't going to get any other future uncarrier amp bonuses unless they pay more as an add-on service like the Canada+Mexico feature.  I also just looked at some semi fine print. This is going to be a promotional plan, and there is some future expiration date."
tmobile,3d8zx1,OtherAlan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"They've announced that the promo data allotments are permanent as long as you continue with the plan, but I agree that the whole idea of promotional plans has really made shit more complicated than it has to be.  All I'm saying is that, once the ""old"" simple choice plans go away, the ""new"" simple choice plans shouldn't be all that complex. The only wrinkle we know of right now is ""4th line free"". It's all the grandfathering, $10 add-ons, and things like that which make it a clusterfuck.  I'd be happier if they just came out with a new streamlined plan that was priced the same or less than the old plans, wasn't inferior in any way, and just switched everyone over to that plan. That'd be un-carrier as fuck. But it doesn't seem to be how they're going with this."
tmobile,3d8zx1,dark_roast,2,Tue Jul 14 23:52:17 2015 UTC,"I just see it as them digging themselves back into the mountains of grandfather plans again. There was the whole forced migration that they are still trying to do from my understanding. My plan isnt too 'old'.  Still on the simple select plan, which I think is one generation before uncarrier 1.0 simple choice."
tmobile,3d8zx1,OtherAlan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:58:27 2015 UTC,Now I'm confused.  Two (out of 4) lines on my Simple Choice family plan have $10 fees for unlimited data (bringing it to $120).   Would switching actually just move all 4 lines to unlimited data for the same price?
tmobile,3d8zx1,sisko4,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:39:35 2015 UTC,"These plans aren't for unlimited data, and unless you're on some super secret plan, $10 isn't getting your current lines unlimited, either. $10 gets you 3GB or 4.5GB, depending on the plan."

For example, 2.5 GB -> 5GB for the same price or something. That would be more in the spirit of uncarrier. This is just upselling data most users won't need.  Sprint tactics on T-Mo basically. Confusing plans and screwing over older customers. Not very uncarrier, not at all.  Worst of all is that older customers that switched to T-Mo and joined the legacy 2.5GB 4/100 are left out of all the new uncarrier perks although I joined this plan 3 months ago.

tmobile,3d9e6l,fgebike,2,Tue Jul 14 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"locked in last week! keeping this plan for sure, and then tacking on the $10 mex/can deal whenever i travel down to baja. easy enough! unlimited everything is too good to give up."
tmobile,3d9e6l,tweave,2,Tue Jul 14 23:27:21 2015 UTC,I almost think the new plans are a better deal  edit: I guess it really depends on your use case...
tmobile,3d9e6l,R10T,3,Tue Jul 14 17:27:30 2015 UTC,Yea I think some families can benefit from the 4 for $120 10 GB plan.
tmobile,3d9e6l,R10T,2,Tue Jul 14 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"10 GB per line... I think that's going to be hard for a lot of people to hit, what with Music Freedom included as well."
tmobile,3d9e6l,venezian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:33:57 2015 UTC,I think i'll benefit from this. Currently 3 lines unlimited everything for $140. I have an older 5S I can add as the 4th line and use that to tether with the new plan. Will this new plan have Data-Stash?
tmobile,3d9e6l,kylemaguire,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:57 2015 UTC,Yes it does have data stash
tmobile,3d9e6l,skyxsteel,2,Tue Jul 14 19:05:29 2015 UTC,"See this is the deal maker for me. $120 for 4 lines, +10 for me so I have 20. And with data stash, it's almost making me want to give up my 2 for $100 plan since I'm having 2 more of my family members come to T-Mo.  And don't forget increased roaming limits. 10GB gets 100MB and 20GB gets 200MB."
tmobile,3d9e6l,kylemaguire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:55:21 2015 UTC,You can have the two others come on with unlimited LTE for $40 each line per month if they want to pay for it
tmobile,3d9e6l,sithrebel15,3,Wed Jul 15 20:23:19 2015 UTC,Its ten now but you have to call to do more than 5 iirc.

tmobile,3d9e6l,choff5507,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:38:21 2015 UTC,Anyone know if you can have 2 lines on unlimited and add a third with just a normal amount of data? Whats the extra cost involved?
tmobile,3d9e6l,choff5507,2,Wed Jul 15 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can do that, I think you need to pay the $40 for another line that will also be UNL."
tmobile,3d9e6l,Hilbe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, yeah then there's no point in that for me, guess Im going to stay on my 4/$100 plan."
tmobile,3d9e6l,publicenemy92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:27:30 2015 UTC,You can mix/match.  You just pay the upcharge.  So $30 more on each line.  So if you're on the 4 for $100 and decide 2 lines need to be unlimited it's another $60 on top.
tmobile,3d9e6l,Choreboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:35 2015 UTC,I already asked this and yea 3rd line has to be 40
tmobile,3d9e6l,The_Spectator,2,Tue Jul 14 17:55:25 2015 UTC,"I have that plan, you can't do that. Each additional line is $40/unlimited."
tmobile,3d9e6l,dmclone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:32:03 2015 UTC,40$ plus tax
tmobile,3d9e6l,Tyrannosaurus-WRX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:39:56 2015 UTC,I think he meant adding a regular line like 1GB.
tmobile,3d9e6l,FR4NOx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"Trying to decide if I should switch, probably not.  Currently have 2/$100 unlimited  Go to Mexico once a year for a week.

tmobile,3d9e6l,88cavalierz24,3,Tue Jul 14 17:27:13 2015 UTC,"If you go once a year, you can add the international calling and data plan for 10 bucks a month for the month you are in Mexico, and then remove it from your plan the next month. I'd stick with the unlimited personally just so I don't even have to think about it"
tmobile,3d9e6l,MikeInCali,2,Tue Jul 14 18:33:17 2015 UTC,I think the peace of mind of not having to worry about how much data you're using is worth keeping unlimited.
tmobile,3d9e6l,88cavalierz24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:15:12 2015 UTC,So tempting. Been wanting this for awhile. Wife is on StraightTalk with a moto x 2013. Have my nexus 6 on the 30/walmart plan.  I've been pretty much going over my 5gb the past few months and throttle to 64k sucks. Also been going over my minutes.  If I go to stt I get the mins but same data For 90/month. Estimate the tmobile would be about 112 after taxes for us and we both get unlimited data. She's never gone over her 5gb on stt. Plus could use the 7gb Hotspot for my son for Netflix while on the road. Decisions decisions....
tmobile,3d9e6l,BDestroyer8418,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"If it were me, I'd go to it...the deal is amazing and is extremely unlikely to return again."
tmobile,3d9e6l,disenchanted_psycho,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:37:15 2015 UTC,Just ordered it. Yay lol. Don't think the service will be any better then the 30/walmart plan besides unlimited everything. Where I live and work is a great area for tmobile. Tmobile is the only service at my job for lte in the building.
tmobile,3d9e6l,BDestroyer8418,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"What is the after tax cost of this plan for people in the Chicago, IL area.  The chat rep can't tell me but said it should be about $110 maybe $115 max and then I've read elsewhere people said $125ish ???    Do they do a hard credit pull if adding a 2nd line."
tmobile,3d9e6l,disenchanted_psycho,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:56:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure what the price will be, but they definitely do a hard credit pull, which is fine with me, it showed me my credit monitoring apps are working because I instantly got 2 alerts after signing up for this plan."
tmobile,3d9e6l,disenchanted_psycho,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:10:36 2015 UTC,I called and they said they don't if your adding a 2nd line.  Did you just add a line from a single line or sign up for 2 lines ?
tmobile,3d9e6l,traveljack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:38:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry I misread your comment, I added two lines since I switched from AT&T today."

tmobile,3d9e6l,madden0823,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:58:16 2015 UTC,It's a wash for us.   I am curious if the match your data for $10 means I can get 10gb on my Ipad with that plan?
tmobile,3d9e6l,DudeThatsErin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:13:23 2015 UTC,"No, match is limited to 5GB."
tmobile,3d9e6l,madden0823,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:17:39 2015 UTC,Do you know if the single line $80 unlimited data will be leaving too?
tmobile,3d9e6l,garfield1979,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:10:05 2015 UTC,That's staying until at least 2016. Then the executive team will reevaluate the sustainability of unlimited data.
tmobile,3d9e6l,mistame,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:28 2015 UTC,By that you mean December 2016 or January 2016?

tmobile,3d9e6l,Witty_Allusion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:34:23 2015 UTC,I switched my plan over to the $100 unlimited family today. after realizing I've been overpaying (by $30 / month with add on data) and this has been available since Dec '14 !?..   Oh well...  Can someone tell me how they handle tethering on these plans ?
tmobile,3d9e6l,fubka,3,Tue Jul 14 23:21:46 2015 UTC,On the unlimited high speed data plans you get 7GB tethering data and then tethering speeds are throttled. On the other data plans you share your high speed data bucket between your phone and tethering.
tmobile,3d9e6l,SitDownCreepa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:52:53 2015 UTC,Excellent thanks for that reply.
tmobile,3d9e6l,SitDownCreepa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:35:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for this post. I just made the swap for my wife and I. We had been paying the same for two lines with 3GB of LTE / month... No brainer swap.

tmobile,3d9e6l,tonywunyc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:12:15 2015 UTC,It's gone today in favor of the new plans. But all of the lines have to be unlimited anyways so you weren't missing out on much.

tmobile,3d9e6l,nicothetechguy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:55:42 2015 UTC,Are you on a promo plan? Doesn't look like you are so you get it automatically starting today. Don't even have to pay $10.
tmobile,3d9e6l,tmobile_user,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:39:04 2015 UTC,I don't think we have a promo.  So it looks like the only change is that we will pay $160 instead?
tmobile,3d8zyu,strabbit,17,Tue Jul 14 13:06:44 2015 UTC,"I don't like it for me. I mean, I don't really ever use over 10gigs on my unlimited line, but at least I have the option to.  For other people? Great plan. Especially for families, really great deal."
tmobile,3d8zyu,dsatrbs,2,Tue Jul 14 13:08:26 2015 UTC,"The good news as always with tmobile is that if you go over you don't get stuck with fees, and you don't get totally cut off from data. You just get throttled to a speed that works for email, voip calls, facebook, google maps, etc, but is to slow for things like video. (Plus there's data stash if you are usually under the data limit to make up for exception times).  I just wish they had an option of which kind of line you want to add - $10 for a 1gb line, $20 for a 10gb line would be better for me."
tmobile,3d8zyu,RedPill115,2,Tue Jul 14 19:55:07 2015 UTC,Have you ever been throttled? You get similar speeds when abroad and the phone is nearly unusable. Even Google Maps is a shit show.
tmobile,3d8zyu,NoShftShck16,2,Wed Jul 15 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have been throttled in the US and my experience was like above. Reddit was surprisingly fine. So was google maps, email, facebook (except pics).  Downloading a data intensive app was hell, so is trying to watch youtube, but basic stuff - I almost didn't even notice.  Maybe when you're abroad it's something else."
tmobile,3d8zyu,RedPill115,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:28:50 2015 UTC,"That reflects my experiences abroad. All those services worked fine, Facebook pictures loaded slowly. Forget about YouTube and Netflix. It actually took me two hours to download a 3MB song!  That's one reason I'm clinging onto my unlimited data plan with dear life. To me, unlimited isn't a golden ticket to have Netflix streaming parties and use up 100GB a month. Instead, unlimited is the safety net that saves me from throttling."
tmobile,3d8zyu,AlbinoAlex,10,Wed Jul 15 03:19:42 2015 UTC,I think I'll pass on this one and keep my 4 for $100 until they come up with a better plan later in the year. Would have been better if it was 5gb per line for the same price.
tmobile,3d8zyu,stfsu,6,Tue Jul 14 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"$20 more to add 7.5gb to each line isnt bad though, plus you get data stash"
tmobile,3d8zyu,Domini384,2,Tue Jul 14 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"More data is great, but we're 5 lines, so having the bill jump another $20 gets us closer to a $200 bill including an EIP on one line."
tmobile,3d8zyu,stfsu,2,Tue Jul 14 14:02:04 2015 UTC,"I have six lines (2 tablets  5 phones) on a family plan. One tablet has 1gb with data stash, one has matched 5gb.  Three phones are at 2.5, one at 5, and one at unlimited.  120 is the base price, then 10 per tablet, 10 for then 5gb line, and 30(?) for the unlimited line."
tmobile,3d8zyu,craya1982,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"Same here... my bill is $285 for four lines, all with EIP... I'm in no rush to add even just $20 more... but it certainly isn't a bad deal if you use a lot of data (only my son does, 2.5Gb seems to usually be enough for everyone else)."
tmobile,3d8zyu,fzammetti,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:13:13 2015 UTC,In your case it would be a 22 to 28 dollars per line jump in price.  Depending on your users and how the bill is split it could make sense. If Dad pays the whole bill then probably not.

tmobile,3d8zyu,gamepro86x,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:14:28 2015 UTC,What if I have 5 lines?
tmobile,3d8zyu,gamepro86x,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"The 4th line is still free, but you would pay an extra 20 for the 5th, so $140 for 5 10GB lines."
tmobile,3d8zyu,gamepro86x,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:39:13 2015 UTC,"Well, consider how much data you actually use per month. Do you actually go above 10GB every month? If so, it's not worth it. However, if you only occasionally go over 10GB, this is the better deal thanks to Data Stash."
tmobile,3d8zyu,krazymunky,2,Wed Jul 15 12:00:13 2015 UTC,"I currently have the 4 lines for $100 (2.5gb/ea) deal, which also allows the 15% gov. discount. Will this new promo family plan also allow the 15% discount?  I heard the 2 lines for $100 unlimited data did not allow 15% off, not sure how this one will work. Thanks"
tmobile,3d8zyu,hectorartm,2,Tue Jul 14 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"Upon further analysis I'd only consider it if 1) the 15% discount still applied, 2) I get to keep the $5 unlimited international talk and text promo on the account. Making the cost ~$20 more/mo if the above is true... and even then I'm on the fence. 2.5GB/ea is usually enough for us."
tmobile,3d8zyu,stigga,2,Tue Jul 14 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"And I've confirmed no discounts allowed on the $120 plan (via chat support)... so at a minimum it raises my bill $35-40 - makes my decision easy, no thanks!"
tmobile,3d8zyu,MrBamHam,2,Tue Jul 14 18:00:32 2015 UTC,Does it say anywhere about Tethering included in the plan?
tmobile,3d8zyu,stigga,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:31:27 2015 UTC,You can use all 10gb for tethering.
tmobile,3d8zyu,MrBamHam,4,Tue Jul 14 17:44:22 2015 UTC,I think behind these amps is the switch from the great plans to more standard cell phone plans
tmobile,3d8zyu,saynotopulp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:18:10 2015 UTC,What's your problem with this plan?
tmobile,3d8zyu,TheTwoOneFive,2,Tue Jul 14 14:46:08 2015 UTC,I think it is worse for 2 people then the 2 - $100 unlimited.
tmobile,3d8zyu,Domini384,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"While true, that was always going to expire at some point. At least they're offering a permanent plan which is almost as good in its place."
tmobile,3d8zyu,ohjacobk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:20:10 2015 UTC,"no  they're enticing multi-line accounts to T-Mobile because that's where the money is, the cost to support such customers are lower and churn is lower too"
tmobile,3d8zyu,cadams7701,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:58:00 2015 UTC,"Is this an 'all or nothing', i.e. do we have to move all lines over to the new plan or can we select which ones we want to transfer?"
tmobile,3d8zyu,TheTwoOneFive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:03:37 2015 UTC,You should be able to select
tmobile,3d8zyu,RedPill115,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:50:13 2015 UTC,You will be able to select.  Has tmo ever done an 'all or none' type offering?
tmobile,3d8zyu,anothercookie90,2,Tue Jul 14 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, the 2 for $100 unlimited deal requires all lines be unlimited on the account.  If there was a way to have two unlimited and 2 base lines all for $120 I'd be all over that and save $60 a month."
tmobile,3d8zyu,dmplus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:30 2015 UTC,"Does the current (well, for today...) 2/$100 plan allow for a 3rd line to be added at the base data rate for $10? Everything I saw was that you could only add unlimited lines to that at $40/each, although that may just be T-Mo trying to push more revenue per line by neglecting to mention cheaper options are available."
tmobile,3d8zyu,TheTwoOneFive,2,Tue Jul 14 14:10:16 2015 UTC,The catch with the unlimited plan was that additional lines had to also have unlimited data for $40/line.
tmobile,3d8zyu,dmplus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:08:29 2015 UTC,On this new account every line after the first 2 excluding line 4 (Which is free if you sign up before labor day) is $20 per line
tmobile,3d8zyu,TheTwoOneFive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:11:06 2015 UTC,You can move two (or more) of your lines to it and pay 100 dollars. Is that what you are suggesting?  Although technically you'll have two accounts at that point as this plan is a new base account type.
tmobile,3d8zyu,dmplus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:34:52 2015 UTC,"I mean something like this:  First two lines at 10GB data: $100 Third line at 10GB: +$20 Fourth line at 10GB: +$0 (currently free through Labor Day) Fifth through seventh lines at 2.5GB: +$10 each  The way the prices/lines stack may not be exact, but I mean maintain one family plan with 'best of both worlds pricing'. I understand that lines 5-7 would not have Simple Global."
tmobile,3d8zyu,TheTwoOneFive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:08:23 2015 UTC,"Nope, cannot do what you suggested. A 7 line account would require all to be 10GB (or 20).    However there is some pricing to consider.  The base line 7 lines would be 180 (25 per line) dollars vs the hybrid that you'd like would be 150 (21 per line).  Not really a huge per line difference (if you are splitting the bill financially down the middle.  You could also ask the 4 that want the 10GB to pay 33 per month and the 3 that didn't want it to pay 18 per month (even though they would get 10GB) as that would be cheaper per month for the 4 than putting them on the unlimited plan."
tmobile,3d8zyu,dmplus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"I get a 15% corporate discount still (one of the lucky few), so it is more around $21/line for 5 lines, $31ish for 6 and 7 (one has 4.5GB and one will pay for the $10 MWB add-on as he is the only person who wants it)."
tmobile,3d8zyu,TheTwoOneFive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:31:32 2015 UTC,The BFD discount is much larger than the 15% corp discount usually. Do you qualify for that one?
tmobile,3d8zyu,dmplus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"Nope, BYOD."
tmobile,3d8zyu,hamsterfishpony,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:16:25 2015 UTC,You can still get the BFD (business family discount) with BYOD.
tmobile,3d8zyu,TheTwoOneFive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:11:32 2015 UTC,How? I have exactly one phone line (personal) and my company has zero T-Mobile lines as they don't purchase phones (we get a stipend for our phone every month).
tmobile,3d8zyu,blzr409,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"So your on a single user plan? I thought you were on a 7 line plan.  In any case the BFD is a 30 dollar discount on a single line plan, and a 40 dollar discount on a multi line plan, which is usually much larger than a 15% discount.  It's interesting that your company provides a discount with T-Mobile, but doesn't do business with them.  At least your stipend can kind-of act like a discount (assuming it's fairly generous)."
tmobile,3d8zyu,saynotopulp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:42:07 2015 UTC,If they do let you pick which lines I wonder how much they will be. I have 6 lines but only one really uses any significant amount of data...the rest have 2.5gig but barely use 1.
tmobile,3d8zyu,dmplus,3,Tue Jul 14 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat - 4 users who regularly come near their caps, and 3 users who use 300MB-1GB per month."
tmobile,3d8zyu,anothercookie90,3,Tue Jul 14 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling this is extremely common. Legere likes to promote not having shared data as a benefit, but I'm pretty sure it actually just leads to a lot more unused data. I have my line where I'll use a ton of data, one that might use 1 GB, one that might use a couple hundred MB, one that might hit 100 MB, and one that actually uses none. I'd much rather they offer 10 (or in this case 12.5) GB shared."

For some of us it's great, I've blow past my data limit when not realizing I'm not on WiFi My brother in law is very absent minded, he's cost my in-laws $200 in data overages in a single month two or three times, so there are many of us who like the idea of not sharing data"
tmobile,3d8zyu,saynotopulp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:19:46 2015 UTC,"They do not, this is a base plan, not a data add feature.  All 6 lines would need to be on the new plan with 10GB each at the cost of 160 dollars.  Here's where things get creative.  If you have one users who is willing to pay for unlimited (30 more dollars) it almost makes sense to move the whole account to the 10GB assuming your one user normally uses 10GB or less, since you will get the mobile without borders at that point (if you wanted it).  Edit*  And data stash on all lines."
tmobile,3d8zyu,anothercookie90,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:01:23 2015 UTC,"Yes this is an all or nothing plan.   All lines get 10 GB of data, $10 more for 20 GB.  Each line after the first 4 costs $20 per line. No $10 lines with 1 GB on this plan."

tmobile,3d8zyu,Domini384,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:56:40 2015 UTC,Verizon doesnt offer any unlimited plans so I have no idea what point you're trying to make.
tmobile,3d8zyu,FR4NOx,2,Tue Jul 14 13:25:49 2015 UTC,I thought parent poster mean they are offering less data then their previous 2 for $100 promo. Re-reading it I'm still fairly confident of that. They're calling it a Verizon-level move.
tmobile,3d8zyu,acrolos,3,Tue Jul 14 13:35:58 2015 UTC,"No one is talking about Verizon.  We're talking about t-mobile.    The price difference between Verizon and t-mobile is not up for debate.  The issue is that this plan lowers what t-mobile is offering (2 lines w/unlimited data  to 2 lines w/10gb each) for the same cost.  Rather than being an improvement,  it's lowering what they are offering.    Don't get me wrong,  it's still a good deal for someone moving from Verizon or elsewhere... But it's not an improvement for t-mobile (at least on two lines)."
tmobile,3d8zyu,FR4NOx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:39:18 2015 UTC,"i agree its not an improvement, but i would not have expected an improvement on what was already an absurd deal.  this change probably affects such a small number of 2/$100 people who were using more than 10gb a piece, while improving the deal for families.  i see this as a net positive and a push for 99% of previous 2/$100 customers."
tmobile,3d8zyu,acrolos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:41:31 2015 UTC,The difference here is that these were promotional offers. Carriers change plans and pricing all the time. Its no surprise
tmobile,3d8zyu,cadams7701,2,Tue Jul 14 13:46:43 2015 UTC,he's basically offering 40GB for $140 vs 10GB for $140 on Verizon
tmobile,3d8zyu,traveljack,-3,Tue Jul 14 14:03:41 2015 UTC,Their prices are better than Verizon.  That's not what I'm saying.   I'm saying that for two people they lowered the data from unlimited to 10gb and he's selling it as a positive.
tmobile,3d8zyu,FR4NOx,4,Tue Jul 14 13:28:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's his job. ;) It's not as good as the 2/100 deal, but I can see it really helping out families."
tmobile,3d8zyu,acrolos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:36:22 2015 UTC,"That's my point though.  He's selling it as this fantastic thing that goes against the way Verizon does business... And while it's a better deal that Verizon,  it's very much in line with the practices they use.  Giving less for the same cost.   For families of 4 it's much better,  but for 2, which was part of his announcement,  it's not better at all."
tmobile,3d8zyu,sparkpar44,2,Tue Jul 14 13:38:08 2015 UTC,But overall it's another option no one is forcing you to move into.  If you like the current 4 for $100 or 2 for $100 keep it but you just need to add the $10 for MWB.  I guess at that point if you are OK with $110 then just another $10 gets you 4 times the data and data stash.  Pobably a good deal.  For the unlimited though nothing beats that and this isn't a competition or replacement to that plan.
tmobile,3d8zyu,acrolos,0,Tue Jul 14 13:43:35 2015 UTC,If you like your plan keep it. Seems like I heard that before :)
tmobile,3d8zyu,sparkpar44,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:47:14 2015 UTC,"Right, he's selling it (Edit: as fantastic) because he's literally selling a product. T-Mobile is still a business and Legere is still earning his paycheck. :)  It's like Verizon's ""Ten GIGANTIC Gigs"". Gotta make it sound good to sell good."
tmobile,3d8zyu,acrolos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:53 2015 UTC,Exactly.  He's selling like Verizon sells things.  Less for the same cost.  That's my point.    He claims to be better.
tmobile,3d8zyu,saynotopulp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"As always, it depends on a person's needs. For example, if someone doesn't use more than 10 gb per line but needs coverage in Canada/Mexico than this is $10 cheaper. If people need more than 2 lines and don't use more than 10 gb per line than this is cheaper. If you're already on 2 for $100 and neither of those scenarios affect you than you can stay on that plan. I fail to see the issue here."
tmobile,3d8zyu,nymax12,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:28:15 2015 UTC,"No real issue.. Just making a point that it's similar to what Verizon has done over the years.   They take away a plan and lessen it,  then sell it as a benefit.    I'm on my unlimited plan and will keep it,  even though I probably will never use more than 10gb a month because of music freedom."
tmobile,3d8zyu,TheMokaPot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"But my point is that for some people this is actually giving them more. For instance if a family of 3 was on the 2 for $100 promo and called Mexico regularly they'd be at $150 per month  ($100 for the first 2 lines + $40 for the 3rd line + $10 for mobile without borders). If this hypothetical family averaged about 8 GB per line per month, this new plan would save them $30 month. It would also allow them to stash that unused data for higher usage months down the road.   Verizon would offer less for the same amount with the extras like Mobile Without Borders or Data Stash at the same price point which is very different than this. It may not benefit you personally, but that doesn't mean others can't benefit from it which is the difference between T-Mobile and Verizon.  Lastly it was common knowledge the 2 for $100 promo is ending. The ""Verizon"" way of doing things would be to go back to business as usual (2 lines for $140 with unlimited data), and not offer a new plan that is also very competitive in the marketplace. Again, just because it doesn't work for you doesn't mean it's not beneficial for a good number of people, and as mentioned above depending on the situation could actually be a better deal."
tmobile,3d8zyu,gamepro86x,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"Never said it didn't benefit some.  He specifically brought up the two line aspect of it however,  selling how great it was.. When in fact,  it's not as good as what it's replacing."
tmobile,3d8zyu,MrBamHam,2,Tue Jul 14 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"2/$100 Unlimited was a promo plan for a limited time, not a permanent plan, that already got renewed twice after it was supposed to expire.   Versus Verizon you're still getting more and unlike the $40 add a line fee on 2/$100, this one is $20 aal and is more geared toward users who aren't huge data users"
tmobile,3d8zyu,TheMokaPot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"Very true, plus if I'm not mistaken Tmobile is still going to offer unlimited but only at the normal pricing."
tmobile,3d8zyu,MrBamHam,0,Tue Jul 14 15:08:39 2015 UTC,Please correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the title slightly misleading?  You get the first two for $100. But the other two lines must also be 10GB/20GB. So you end up spending $120 before taxes...  I was excited since I thought I could do:   Line 1: 10GB Line 2: 10GB Line 3: 2GB (or whatever is the lowest tier) Line 4: 2GB   And still pay $100 :/

tmobile,3daq6e,zakats,8,Tue Jul 14 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"No mention of VoLTE/Advnaced LTE and I know they have not released the patch for other ZTE phones yet, so I would be very hesitant.  EDIT: It's on the page below, so I'll presume it does have VoLTE, but for $450 it seems like a costly option from a second tier manufacturer.  http://www.spectrumgateway.com/compatible-phones"
tmobile,3daq6e,brontide,7,Tue Jul 14 20:56:45 2015 UTC,"According to the FCC filing the phone does support VoLTE. On page 6 of ""Test report_HAC RF"" they specifically wrote: ""This device supports VoLTE function"". Whether VoLTE works on T-Mobile network is another question though."
tmobile,3daq6e,danrant,3,Tue Jul 14 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"Do you know if T-mobile has to whitelist phones for VoLTE to function? I know the Japanese Xperia Z2 uses VoLTE, but on T-mobile it won't."
tmobile,3daq6e,DesertFlyer,4,Tue Jul 14 21:42:48 2015 UTC,I'm not sure about the whitelist but I know many if not all T-Mobile Android phones have hardcoded VoLTE parameters baked into OS image. Only when VoLTE was added to Nexus 6 I saw new code added to AOSP that is trying to pull some VoLTE settings from the network. So I think an unlocked/international phone needs to run Android 5.1 before we even talk about the whitelist.
tmobile,3daq6e,danrant,6,Tue Jul 14 21:59:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not keen on a $450 ZTE myself; even if it has flagship specs.  They're historically terrible about updates and are not very dev-friendly."

I know this is high-end compared to either of those two (the ZF2 is upper-mid though), but paying $450 to ZTE doesn't sound like a good idea to me."
tmobile,3daq6e,productfred,3,Tue Jul 14 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"B12 is useless without VoLTE   I wouldn't go so far as to say it's useless. Among the times I've been on band 12 and 4/2 on LTE/3G couldn't penetrate, I did have usable 2g signal."
tmobile,3daq6e,stevehobbes,2,Tue Jul 14 22:17:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, that was a bold statement. But I meant that without VoLTE it's data only. Motorola actually updated the Moto E and disabled Band 12 support because the phone doesn't support VoLTE."
tmobile,3daq6e,manleynotboyley,2,Tue Jul 14 22:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for a lot of people it's a major hassle.  For me, it's not such a big deal since I'm an atypical, geeky user.

tmobile,3daq6e,DesertFlyer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:33:55 2015 UTC,T-Mobile has an obligation to pass all 911 calls through anytime they show service - that's almost certainly the reason that Band 12 was disabled.  Still great for mobile hotspot though.

Keep in mind that even if you get a T-Mobile phone that's CDMA ready for Verizon and Sprint, they won't activate them anyway. Verizon and Sprint's policies dictate that all phones used on their network must have been sold as Verizon or Sprint phones. The only way around that is to pop in an already activated Sprint or Verizon sim, but even then you'll only get coverage where there's LTE.  If you end up buying a T-Mobile phone that's locked, you can unlock it by either waiting until you've paid off the phone or buying the phone at full price. Either way, you have to wait 40 days before T-Mobile will unlock it."

It's probable that there is band 12 service but the network won't let you on it on that tower just yet.  From what I've seen here in NEPA with complete band 12 (devices automatically switch to it with no forcing), it provides coverage equal to or, in some cases, better than 1900 MHz EDGE."

Majority of the deaf people switched to Verizon and ATT. And they are having issue and they want to come back to T-Mobile since it is far more reliable than other carriers. Anyway I been with them for 9 years and loving the perks they gave me.   Your best bet to get around those issue is to get data-based messengers. I understand that people don't like using few apps to handle the messages. But that point is crapshoot since everyone have Facebook in their phone and whine about having to use data based messengers while Facebook is in their phone.

tmobile,3d97wa,RedPill115,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"I hope I don't get buried because I have a possible solution. We had similar issues with missed, severely delayed, or 4x duplicating texts. I tried everything from disabling wifi calling, disabling IPv6, to changing APN settings.  Nothing seemed to help and we lived with the issue for about 5 months until FINALLY I tried unplugging the T-Mobile signal booster. Guess what? That fixed all issues and texts send/receive lightning quick.  If you have a booster or a cell-fi, try turning it off. Wifi calling, in our experience, never caused real issues so we turned this feature back on.  Hope this helps!"
tmobile,3d97wa,ruben3232,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:23:07 2015 UTC,"I actually use a huge amount of different ways to connect, haha. When I am at home, I use Textra and an independent signal booster (Wilson), which I purchased because I did not get service inside my apartment and wasn't eligible for the T-Mo one (prepaid). Then at work, I am in a basement-level floor and get no signal, so I use WiFi Calling and the stock LG Messaging app (because only first-party MMS works with WiFi Calling). Both give me issues, as well as just regular, non-boosted LTE in open air.   I'm at a loss, haha!"

tmobile,3dct3k,PersontheTraveler,3,Wed Jul 15 07:01:14 2015 UTC,"I came from AT&T four years ago.  These have been the best four years of my cellular life.    If I did have a complaint, I'd say we have to ""circumvent the in store personnel"" by asking people here on /r/tmobile what to do when issues arise.  Our local rep moved on shortly after setting up our business and the new rep hasn't returned one call in over a year.  We've had issues with our reception at our home office and the store personnel (at least our local store personnel) aren't as well equipped to assist with business lines and support.  Right now we have a Cel-Fi Coverage Unit that is probably doing absolutely nothing to increase our cell phone/LTE/4G reception.  The stores don't know what to do with it and I have no idea how to upgrade.  Perhaps if T-Mobile B2B made it easier to connect to regional or territory reps (or just have local reps return calls) that would be the only thing I'd improve.   Other than that, you're doing an exemplary job and have made these last 4 years unbelievably pain free."
tmobile,3dct3k,DoublePlusGoodGames,3,Wed Jul 15 07:26:16 2015 UTC,"i'm glad you had a great experience! while it's true that there is a turnover rate, this is something that we are currently addressing. i've heard in the past about a rep who no longer works for us spoke to a customer that didn't sign up upon the initial visit but all of a sudden wants the service but can't get in touch with the rep. If they call the customer support number that we leave them, they can reach out to the regional manager who will send out help from someone else. things have changed a bit now, but i imagine this is how things will remain."
tmobile,3dct3k,hiromasaki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:21:46 2015 UTC,Why does our M2M rep at work keep trying to use Music Freedom as a selling point for our remote monitoring equipment?  I'm not sure why he would think a monitoring device on a rooftop would listen to music...
tmobile,3dct3k,hiromasaki,3,Wed Jul 15 16:06:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure what M2M means. Either way, it's quite possible for you to run into reps that are out on the field for their very first time. some account managers start off entry-level and have had 0 sales experience (like me). and the training varies as well. some are amazing trainers, others: not so good. trying to sell you on a pain point that you don't have seems like the issue here is the former. if he sticks through with it, he'll catch on!"
tmobile,3dcsl4,HouseOfBork,8,Wed Jul 15 06:54:45 2015 UTC,"A whole lot of factors play into why signal sucks in that specific location, but in general t-mobile signal has had fewer bars in more places simply because they have lacked the low band spectrum licenses and equipment to fill in the gaps where their band 4 and 2 don't reach.  This is changing really super fast, though. I'm not sure if they already have band 12 deployed in your area, but (if and when) you will need a cell phone with a compatible radio chipset to tap into it. No current iPhones are compatible with band 12.  Tldr: growing pains."
tmobile,3dcsl4,TheNocturnalTexan,3,Wed Jul 15 07:13:07 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, thanks for the reply!"
tmobile,3dcsl4,B1GEast,3,Wed Jul 15 15:33:42 2015 UTC,T-Mobile doesn't own a lot of low-band spectrum (sub-1ghz) like ATT and Verizon. Low band spectrum provides wide area coverage indoors and rural. T-Mobile currently doesn't have any low-band spectrum in Virginia. Does your gym have WiFi? You can use WiFi calling.
tmobile,3dcsl4,tom1226,2,Wed Jul 15 11:47:56 2015 UTC,"They have some band 12 deployed in/around Winchester, VA. My wife's family lives there and last time I visited I went from a bar of edge in their basement to full LTE. Have an S6 so I checked the service menu."

tmobile,3de6jo,_gst_,0,Wed Jul 15 16:08:18 2015 UTC,So it's not possible for marketing companies in Mexico to purchase T-Mobile phones and plans and call people in the US with no international charges?  I just find it a very odd coincidence that I got a marketing call from Mexico the day T-Mobile starts this.
tmobile,3de6jo,otterhouse5,6,Wed Jul 15 17:09:30 2015 UTC,"It seems much more plausible that Mexican telemarketers are using cheap landlines or VoIP services or prepaid cells from Mexican telecoms rather than faking a US address, falsifying an identity with a ss# that can pass a credit check to get a tmobile plan that qualifies for north american roaming, shipping a Sim card back to mexico, and paying $65 a month so they can violate the service plan until tmo cancels the plan in three months and they have to repeat the process, and that they were preparing to do this on day one of t-mobile's rollout. So yeah this is a coincidence."

Outright end the lease by purchasing the phone from T-Mobile, the total of payments due + the final set amount.  Return the lease and pay just the remaining payments due."

Just turn in the Note 4 for the Note 5. Use what JOD is meant for. No way I can see coming out you ahead with that $200 promo since you have JOD.

Most elderly people I know adopted smartphones fairly easily once they realized that it was in their best interest to get on board. Best wishes.

If you don't want to spend lots of time on tech support and your dad isn't all that tech savvy or into it, he probably won't be all that motivated to use it, may not be happy about it (what do you mean people expect me to reply to texts/emails right away?) and will need lots of training.  And so you should just get him another feature phone.  That's basically the tactics I've taken with my mother and grandmother before.  If you want a low cost way to gauge interest, lend them your handmedown phone, show them how to use it and what you think the ""killer"" app for them might be ""while you shop for a new one"""

tmobile,3day1p,angrysnarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:08:53 2015 UTC,"This is a common scenario with a lot of different variabilities, hence the confusion. I'll try to help.   You didn't mention if you had a cellphone with T-Mobile or not. So here's two possible scenarios you could be in:  A. If you DO have a cellphone on the same account then you should be getting a $10 discount for the OnDemand plan, essentially making it free. If you're not getting the credit, call Care to have them fix it.    If you DO NOT have a cellphone on the same account, then you will NOT get the $10 credit. What you'll want to do in this case is cancel your postpaid account and activate a prepaid account instead. On a prepaid account you can have the 200MB pass for free without any other plan requirements. You may need to get a new SIM to have this accomplished.    Edit: to learn more about free data for life, go here: https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-9700"

It should, and that should zero out your iPad line.  Note that you will not automatically get a discount for the prorated charges for this month, you can usually call 611 and they'll credit that back too."
tmobile,3dboj8,AJJ18,5,Wed Jul 15 00:50:05 2015 UTC,What you're probably seeing is the result of abuse of unlimited. In the real world 20 gigs of data for $100 seems like a winner.
tmobile,3dboj8,tale-85,-5,Wed Jul 15 02:31:55 2015 UTC,What you're probably seeing is the result of abuse of unlimited.   I love this response. So you're telling me I'm abusing unlimited if I use say 40gb? But I'm pating for what is supposed to be unlimited high speed. So how am I abusing it? It shouldn't be called unlimited then.
tmobile,3dboj8,tale-85,2,Wed Jul 15 02:37:42 2015 UTC,"I just think that with all the discussion about ""Throttling"" what you may be seeing is an adjustment. If you bought Unlimited, that's what you expect, 40G is probably reasonable. But I think Truly Unlimited isn't realistic for Tmo untill they get more work on the system. You're gonna have the few who try and use it all."
tmobile,3dboj8,brandiniman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:51:56 2015 UTC,"Abusing, no. Expecting to get the same priority of every single packet as someone that uses even 2 times less each month is silly on your part though.    Netflix did it with DVDs, those that use it the least get priority service, it's fair.   If you use 40GB a month you're likely in need of a bit more wifi searching or a lot more settings-tweaking to reduce data usage. (maybe turn HD video for youtube off unless on wifi, seriosuly re-examine sync settings for all apps [new google photos especially], facebook hd video autoplay to off as well)"
tmobile,3dboj8,PerformanceGM,6,Wed Jul 15 19:49:32 2015 UTC,You do realize the 2/100 was a promo plan right? All promo plans end. To think they could sustain that and make it permanent is idiotic.   Try Sprint if you really want something to complain about.  Also if you think T-Mobile is the one doing the copying then you are delusional. Nearly every promo from the carriers today is modeled after T-Mobile promos
tmobile,3dboj8,PerformanceGM,-5,Wed Jul 15 00:53:39 2015 UTC,You do realize so is this plan? And so was sprints. They're being hypocritical and if you can't realize that then I'm sorry.

tmobile,3das34,icepick_,3,Tue Jul 14 21:10:56 2015 UTC,"Last time I was in SD in the Black hills/rapid city area it was ATT roaming.  It was union all the way through wyoming until the last hour or so before the SD border.  Oddly enough the motorola phones worked perfectly on 3G union, while the samsung phones would only get data if it was on EDGE.  If the samsungs were on union's hspa they didnt get data (looking at the engineering screens seemed to flash an auth error for a second, then just no data connection).    While in SD on AT&T the motorola's ran out of 50mb roaming data practically immediately and thus had no data connection, while the samsungs had 4G(hspa+) and no data limit.   So really, I don't know what kind of experience you are going to have :-/  If you have B12 device, T-Mobile promises SD will have fairly comprehensive coverage within the next few months.

The more antennas the more capacity network has.   Here is a press release from the past:   As the official wireless sponsor of Major League Baseball, T-Mobile has also enhanced the fan experience in and around the All-Star Game’s host stadium, Target Field, with an upgraded network on the [Minneapolis] ballpark’s Distributed Antenna System (DAS). In the past year, T-Mobile has upgraded its blazing-fast network at a number of Major League Baseball ballparks, including those in Arlington, Texas, Miami, New York, Seattle and Washington D.C. as well as Minneapolis – with more planned in the future."

Trouble is our neighborhood is situated in a valley, which afaik can disrupt signal. (im not an expert by any means though)  In regards to the phone itself, its a test drive iphone 5s. If we were to switch, my family would be running iphone 6 most likely, but I would use an LG G4. My issue with that is how would we know if the phones would make a difference without commiting."
tmobile,3d9zo2,Thundertime88,6,Tue Jul 14 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"You have a couple of options. If you get a signal outside your home (at an upstairs window or such), T-Mobile will give you a signal booster. Not an elegant solution, but an option.  The better option is that your area is a T-Mobile band 12 area.  I don't know for sure if your home is covered by band 12 service yet.  It may be, they have been working in New Haven and surrounding areas for the last 6 months.  Iphones don't support band 12 but most other devices do (like the G4).  All things equal, band 12 should give you a decent signal in your home/area.  So, how can you test without committing?  One option is to find someone (family/friend/co-worker) who has a band 12 device and invite them over for dinner.  You could also buy something like the Galaxy Avant used off Ebay/swappa/craigslist for 80-100 dollars, put a prepaid T-mobile sim in it (doesn't have to be activated) and force the device to band 12.  See what kind of signal you get, then sell it for roughly what you bought it for.  If your family is set on iphones you may need to wait 60 days before switching as we are hoping the new iphone supports band 12 (it should)."

tmobile,3d9wob,pawsforbear,4,Tue Jul 14 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"Probably not a good insurance option as much as there is a planning/saving model that may work.  Insurance is around 10 dollars a month and around 200 dollar deductible. Also if you have a certain amount of claims within a certain period of time your policy is cancelled. So i'm not sure you'll find an answer in the world of insurance.  Usually in cases where someone goes through phones quickly I suggest these ideas.   Require the phone to be wrapped in strong, waterproof cases for drop protection and water issues. Tell you wife you are going to budget 50 dollars a month into a phone savings plan, once it's funded to a certain level (300+ dollars) you stop putting into it until she needs a new phone, then you rinse/repeat Stop buying phones that are expensive and break easily (iphones) and instead get phones that are durable but inexpensive, something like the moto G line, or Galaxy Avant, etc... Some credit cards will insure phones purchased under them for a certain period of time, you can check with your insurance company for the details. Remember that paying monthly CC finance charges on a phone is pretty stupid, so I only recommend this if you don't carry a CC balance."

tmobile,3d9wob,brontide,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:22:27 2015 UTC,"PArt of the problem is that I am buying older phones.  For example, a $200 iPhone today would be the 5c maybe the 5s.  So that's a 2 year old phone, with a 2 year old batter.  The other problem for 2 of the phones has been inadvertent glass breaks.  One from just putting a case in (literally it cracked the screen and lifted it from the shell) and another was a slight drop.   Android is nice because most phones have better build quality and most allow a new battery."

Here is a list of devices with full band 12+VoLTE support and many are tmobile branded and therefore should have wifi calling as well.  http://www.spectrumgateway.com/compatible-phones  l have beaten iPhones up over the years, they are not fragile in the least so I'm presuming the one that cracked probably had a poor replacement screen, yes a direct drop onto a hard surface like concrete will often crack the glass.  I think you are vastly overstating the build quality of other devices.  That said if she doesn't need an iPhone you will get a much wider range of values out of the Android ecosystem."

tmobile,3d9gkj,say592,2,Tue Jul 14 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"All of it, as long as you trade in a phone and buy a new one."
tmobile,3d9gkj,icepick_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:50:38 2015 UTC,"Nothing. For ETF pay off you have to trade in any phone (doesnt have to be the phone on the contract...). For Edge payoff, you have to trade in the exact phone on the Edge agreement. You trade in the phones to T-Mobile, and they will let you do it in store, however I recommend you ask for a deferred trade, so that if T-Mobile doesnt work for you, you still have your phones when you go back to VZW.   You should also definitely do a Test Drive. Free iPhone 5S to try on T-Mobile for a week. That is what convinced me."
tmobile,3d9gkj,icepick_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:51:45 2015 UTC,Alright so I'm not on an edge plan so no worries there. So If i just trade in some $30 smartphones i find on craigslist T-mobile will pay all the ETF for my iPhones i currently have on verizon? Even if it is like over $500 in ETFs?
tmobile,3d9gkj,blaziecat1103,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, we did exactly this on one of our lines. Oh, you also have to purchase T-Mobile phones, I believe. You can get a $30 phone though. Just be open to a rep about what you want to do (keep your phones, have an ETF payoff) and they will make sure everything is in order."

tmobile,3d9gkj,stevehobbes,2,Tue Jul 14 15:43:46 2015 UTC,T Mobile.
tmobile,3d9gkj,icepick_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:44:17 2015 UTC,alright I will see if I can get this setup tonight. So excited for better prices and no data overage charges. Thank you so much for your help. Your amazing.
tmobile,3d9gkj,icepick_,4,Tue Jul 14 15:46:10 2015 UTC,Happy to help.
tmobile,3d9gkj,sparkpar44,2,Tue Jul 14 15:49:56 2015 UTC,"Yep. Because you have iPhones, you're in a prime position to keep your phones. What you need to do is scrounge up two working phones to trade in to T-Mobile. They don't have to be smartphones or even from Verizon. They just have to turn on and not be completely destroyed(for smartphones, this means no cracked screens). When you're ready to make the switch, trade in the two sacrificial phones and buy the cheapest possible phone to start service on your T-Mobile account. Once you have your service on whatever phone you buy, get yourself two T-Mobile nano SIM cards, prepaid or postpaid(I recommend getting them from Best Buy for $5 each). Transfer each line's service to its new SIM at the T-Mobile site or by calling Customer Care. Your Verizon iPhones are fully compatible with T-Mobile service, including LTE and Wi-Fi calling, and they're already unlocked, so you can insert your activated SIM and go. For the ETF promo, I suggest starting service online because you can buy refurbished phones to start your service. Two $30 Lumia 530s or LG 450s will do the trick and make good backup phones."
tmobile,3d9gkj,dmplus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:57:48 2015 UTC,Thank you for detailed response. I think this will be my plan. The only problem is the time it takes for the ETF to come back to me.  Tell me if this is a good plan. Put the ETF on my Discover card. Wait for the reimbursement to come and pay back the ETF with the Visa Gift Card T-mobile gives me.
tmobile,3d9gkj,stevehobbes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:49:12 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Discover doesn't accept other cards to pay your Discover bill. You would have to use the ETF card for some other thing. Otherwise, you're good to go."
tmobile,3d9gkj,stevehobbes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:30 2015 UTC,"IF the phones have ETFs and NOT payment plans, you can buy cheap smartphones ($30 for anything working and used) and turn those in instead, and sell (or use - they'll work just as well on TMO!) your iPhone 6s still.  Should save you a bunch of money.  But this only works if you paid the $299/$399 for 2 years NOT EDGE plans."
tmobile,3d9gkj,stevehobbes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"Ok So I'm going to make a scenario and tell me if this would work.   I go buy 2 $30 smartphones from craigslist. Then I go into T-mobile, trade them in, port over my numbers from verizon. T-mobile covers the ETFs for the contract ending early for both iPhone 6s.  Then I just buy sims for my  iPhone 6s. Then I live a happy life with T-mobile."
tmobile,3d9gkj,atyppo,2,Tue Jul 14 16:08:26 2015 UTC,Yes.. As long as you buy 2 new phones as well.
tmobile,3d9gkj,stevehobbes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:54:17 2015 UTC,I'm not planning on buying new phones from them. I want to trade in some random phones. and use my iPhone 6s that I already have. Will they not pay the ETFs if I don't buy a new phone from them?
tmobile,3d9gkj,GinDaHood,2,Tue Jul 14 17:00:05 2015 UTC,Then you're on your own for the EFT.   You can buy any phone.  You don't have to use it.
tmobile,3d9gkj,saynotopulp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:02:16 2015 UTC,So if I buy 2 $30 Nokia Lumia 530 pre-owned from T-mobile. Then will they pay for ETF. Then I just buy sim cards form my 2 iPhone 6's and switch it over to the iPhones?
tmobile,3d9gkj,saynotopulp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:08:26 2015 UTC,"You have to buy phones too. You don't have to use the phones you buy. 2 $30 phones purchased from T-Mobile  will qualify you. Trade-in any cheap working phones, purchase any cheap phones that you'll end up putting in a junk drawer, and T-Mobile will cover your ETF while up use your current iPhones with T-Mobile."
tmobile,3d9gkj,icepick_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:39 2015 UTC,Alright so I think I have this figured out. Tell me if I'm wrong. I will go buy some cheap phones (do they need to be smart phones) trade them in.   Then buy 2 $30 phones from tmobile. Not even activate them.  Then I get sims for my 2 iPhones. And use them.  Then the ETF gets paid by T-mobile for sure.
tmobile,3d9gkj,icepick_,2,Tue Jul 14 17:15:26 2015 UTC,T-Mobile does not pay ETF's.  You submit your bill showing the ETF's and the numbers associated with the ETF's need to match the number(s) ported to T-Mobile.  After you do that you pay verizon the ETF bill and then wait a couple months and T-Mobile will give you a gift card for the ETF balance you paid.
tmobile,3d9gkj,dmplus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:46:44 2015 UTC,But what if I just wait for the bill to come with the ETFs and then pay it with the gift card T-mobile gives me?
tmobile,3d9gkj,icepick_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"Bingo. Your iPhones from Verizon are already unlocked. Everything will ""just work"". If you're getting the 2 unlimited lines for $100 plan, today is the last day."
tmobile,3d9gkj,krispykracker1,0,Tue Jul 14 16:12:05 2015 UTC,I would love to do the $100 unlimited plan but I need a cheaper plan and 2gb for both of us is just fine. So I'm going to pass on it for now. Thanks for letting me know.
tmobile,3d9gkj,Kidney_Thief1988,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"To be completely clear, it's 1GB for each of you.  Data isn't pooled at T-Mobile.  So if you're thinking she'll use 500MB and you get 1.5GB it doesn't work that way.  You also get 7GB worth of hotspot data on the unlimited plans - it very well might be worth the extra $20/mo."
tmobile,3d9gkj,Kidney_Thief1988,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:17:00 2015 UTC,I may do it if I can get this all figured out today and pay the minimal amount as possible.

tmobile,3d9ah0,cornerstorewhore,3,Tue Jul 14 20:08:51 2015 UTC,You're not on jump 1 if this is the case. The 50% payoff is jump 2
tmobile,3d9ah0,hearingnone,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:49:13 2015 UTC,The 50% payoff apply to jump 1. I just upgrade my phone two months ago after paying off 50% of my LG G3. Unless you mean jump 2 is revision of jump 1 before JOD?
tmobile,3d9ah0,cornerstorewhore,2,Tue Jul 14 21:20:44 2015 UTC,"You're misinformed. Jump 1 allows customers to upgrade twice in a 12 month window regardless of what is owed on devices. Jump 2 allows customers to upgrade after 50% of the device is paid off, 12 months between upgrades on O.A.C. Jump on demand is part of the new uncarrier moves. They should have just called it Jump 3. You have jump 2"

tmobile,3d7uie,icepick_,9,Tue Jul 14 04:51:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to commit a sin and call upon /u/icepick_ for a network management perspective.   Usually you have to say the demon's name three times to summon them properly.  There's two schools of thought on Band 12...set it so that you only get on it when The other bands are so weak that it's your last resort, or set it so that it's treated equally, and you'll hand back and forth as strength dictates.    Also ice, reference the speed test challenge T-Mobile has going on right now at the all star game, they have to have something temporarily deployed there to handle the congestion AND outperform right? Maybe a mobile site?   I would assume a DAS. Probably a temp site or two as well.  I've been curious to see what they've done, as I know that Cincinnati is very spectrum constrained.  And we hosted the All Star game last year, so I know what it takes to pull it off successfully."
tmobile,3d7uie,nk1,2,Tue Jul 14 11:48:35 2015 UTC,"set it so that it's treated equally, and you'll hand back and forth as strength dictates.   What are the advantages to this? Why would you want users in range of decent band 4 coverage to be on the stronger (by signal) band 12 layer?   Unless, of course, band 4 is also 5+5 and you are just load-balancing between the two."
tmobile,3d7uie,icepick_,2,Tue Jul 14 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"Unless, of course, band 4 is also 5+5 and you are just load-balancing between the two.   Exactly.   Even if  Band 4 is 10x10, in some cases it may be congested.   Offloading band 12 users help them,  and reduces the load for band 4 users too."
tmobile,3d7uie,SWOLEGASM,2,Tue Jul 14 16:52:30 2015 UTC,I feel like this may be going on. Some of my friends on B4 only phones have reported an uptick in speed on previously congested towers.

tmobile,3d7uie,stevehobbes,5,Tue Jul 14 20:37:33 2015 UTC,I'm nearly 100% sure they have a DAS installation at Great American Ballpark.
tmobile,3d7uie,danrant,2,Tue Jul 14 05:39:33 2015 UTC,Would it be able to handle that much traffic and still outperform every other carrier? Damn
tmobile,3d7uie,nicothetechguy,2,Tue Jul 14 05:55:45 2015 UTC,"We don't know if T-Mobile is actually outperforming other carriers at the all star game festivities.  A DAS can support more users, but it's not magic.  Spectrum limitation is still an issue."
tmobile,3d7uie,danrant,2,Tue Jul 14 06:02:46 2015 UTC,"I see. I would just assume that since T-Mobile is doing the challenge and there's a lot of picture there are posting on twitter of victories, that they are outperforming.  At any rate good on T-Mobile to even be able to do this"
tmobile,3d7uie,nicothetechguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:37:34 2015 UTC,"As AT&T and Verizon are happy to point out, T-Mobile has more spectrum per subscriber than either of them (simply because they have substantially more subscribers.......)  So basically, in a specific area where T-Mobile has spectrum and towers/DAS, it's pretty easy for T-Mobile to win by just ensuring the backhaul is there (and that their users don't show up in higher % numbers than the population as a whole)."
tmobile,3d7uie,HelghastSoldier,3,Tue Jul 14 12:35:17 2015 UTC,That looks normal to me. Clients should be distributed among two carriers propotional to bandwidth. Currently AWS LTE carrier  in Los Angeles area has 15 MHz while 700 MHz carrier has 5 so the ratio of clients should be 3:1 regardless of radio conditions. Due to the limited availability of B12 handsets and 2-3 year upgrade cycle the current ratio is probably something like 10:1 so the scheduler is trying to load up L700 carrier regardless of radio conditions. In the future the more B12 phones appear in the network the more influence radio conditions will start to play in carrier selection.
tmobile,3d7uie,angrysnarf,3,Tue Jul 14 17:38:16 2015 UTC,Los Angeles is getting 20 x 20 next week on the 22nd after the AWS HSPA shutdown. PCS HSPA + has been Dual Carrier for awhile and band 12 fixes 2 trouble spots I have with band 4.
tmobile,3d7uie,RedPill115,2,Tue Jul 14 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. My point still stands. It's will take iPhone 6S release and 6-9 months to exceed 4:1 ratio of non-B12 phones vs B12 phones."
tmobile,3d7uie,angrysnarf,2,Tue Jul 14 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, I'm just hoping 20 x 20 will help with the load here, mostly in downtown  (Staples Center). Also in Santa Monica CA I haven't seen to much band 12."
tmobile,3d7uie,RedPill115,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:56:57 2015 UTC,Same with me. At home I get great band 4 signal. Thats one thing that impressed me about T-mobile when I first switched from Verizon was that I went from having 1 to 2 bars with vzw to 4 to 5 bars with Tmo. Even with such a great signal I am still always on band 12. Doesn't bother me at all. I'm just worried about congestion as more phones start to support band 12.
tmobile,3d7uie,thisischuck01,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:44:37 2015 UTC,Maybe your phone is set at b12 priority  Samsung phones have the ability to change that

Even if I'm outdoors (and I got plenty of band 4 signal standing there with my old phone), it wants to jump to band 12.

tmobile,3d4scd,Hilbe,6,Mon Jul 13 15:15:58 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming it will be something similar; right now 1GB for $50 matches AT&T's price and is $5 more than Verizon w/Edge (EIP). While there are some other benefits that T-Mo has over the competition (Simple Global, streaming music), as long as T-Mo has a disadvantage to the big 2 in coverage, their non-promotional plan offer is simply not competitive in the marketplace today."
tmobile,3d4scd,uswr,3,Mon Jul 13 15:21:40 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they already did make 2.5 GB permanent. I got a message a couple months ago that my plan is now locked in and won't change. I changed up to the 2.5 GB plan from 1GB last year.

tmobile,3d4scd,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:22:50 2015 UTC,Right but why wouldn't the 5GB plan also be bumped up to 7.5GB? T-Mobile charges $10 more per line for 500mb data. That's a bit insane.
tmobile,3d4scd,SWOLEGASM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"The promotion was really just 2.5gb base for free. If you think about it, getting 4.5gb for ten dollars was icing on the cake. The 5gb exists because that's the normal pricing, and even when you're on the promotion you can see the 1gb and 3gb data tiers as normal pricing options too."
tmobile,3d4scd,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:33:35 2015 UTC,Yeah but why wouldn't the 5GB tier get the 2.5GB for free like the 3GB tier did? I'm sure T-Mobile would be making more money because more people would want to upgrade to get a bonus 3GB instead of 500mb.
tmobile,3d4scd,SWOLEGASM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:12:43 2015 UTC,Neither got the 2.5gb for free. It wasn't promoted as an additional amount of data on top of the existing data tiers. It was only promoted as get 2.5gb for free instead of only 1gb when you get  family plan of four.

I just feel like we're being overly specific and know what each other is saying.  My point is that the 2.5GB plan should extend to all tiers which would benefit not only customers (better value) but it would also help T-Mobile because more people would be willing to pay $10 more.
tmobile,3d4scd,SWOLEGASM,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of comments because you asked ""Right but why wouldn't the 5GB plan also be bumped up to 7.5GB?

Where you live, AT&T hasn't touched their network since 2013 and despite AT&T's complete lack of investment, Sprint's latest 2015 official ""Spark"" deployment is only 0.1mbps faster than AT&T in average speeds.  Sprint also has the highest dropped call rate, and lowest data reliability of all carriers, where you live.  Since you previously complained that ""T-Mobile data roaming doesn't work"" while using a prepaid SIM that explicitly doesn't allow data roaming, I'm guessing your Cricket experience also involves you doing something weird/wrong.

LTE coverage =/= ALL coverage. you T-Mobilers seem to think LTE is the only thing that matters. I can't even get B12 in my work, but Sprint and Verizon's EVDO data works fine, which means voice and sms works fine too. speed testing in the same spot I get 1-2mbps on Sprint, 5-10kbps on MetroPCS and Cricket.

It's not a network deployment issue, it's a VoLTE software issue. Nevertheless, they should fix it, because it causes problems for customers. I've never claimed otherwise.  Similarly, I didn't bring up Sprint's LTE outage, which has lasted for over three weeks straight now,  across the entire state of Michigan for all LG G3 users.

In most rural areas I've gotten an average of about 9Mbps, this all depends on the spectrum, backhaul and other factors. For your area since it is a newly upgraded edge to LTE market will most likely not have 3G.   2) You could always get a $30 Walmart plan, this comes with 5Gb of data + unlimited texts and 100 minutes. This would give you plenty of data to do speedtest and test the network!   3) speeds can vary as well depending on where you are located, most roaming data is limited to 50Mb of data with unlimited calling and texting.   4) Yes all of the promotional plans that are in effect will be kept.  It would greatly help if you could share a zip code or general town/city name! I hope that clears some things up."

They told me if I wanted a bigger one to call Care and order it. 3) purchased said 16gb version cause I wanted to walk out of the store with one and I wanted JoD so I had to add the JoD in store 4) for the $12/month trade-in credit I had to turn in any smartphone so I purchased a $50 prepaid phone from them to trade-in for the credit 5) went home after the rep was asking her supervisor about doing a deferred trade-in instead of an instant one or whatever... 6) not enough space on it so I called care to order the 64gb version instead 7) they said they couldn't order it since I had JoD added to my account.  8) hung up and tried to order online later. Didn't seem like the order went through as the submit button didn't do anything nor did the page after I electronically signed the form and clicked submit 9) called back and the rep said that it did go through but there was no electronic signature and I had nothing to sign in the account holder's email 10) she cancelled that order and that's when she said she couldn't order it under my line but she could do it under my sister's line. 11) she did it and refunded me my overnight shipping to the account 12) went back to the store to move the EIP to my line after returning my 16gb iPhone 6+ 13) store said I had to do a transfer of responsibility on the EIP where my sister had to call with me to transfer it... Is this true? Can my mom call to transfer this for us?  Question is: (besides the one above) Do I still have JoD on my line or am I SOL since I couldn't even order the 64gb in the store ? They specifically told me that I had to order it online. :/

tmobile,3d7710,icepick_,6,Tue Jul 14 03:07:50 2015 UTC,It really depends what needs to be done. Sometimes it can take 6 months to get upgraded backhaul. Sometimes you have to go through zoning and permitting to change out antennas and it takes 10 months. Sometimes you send a crew out and they spend 4 hours on site and you are upgraded in a week. Way too many variables.
tmobile,3d7710,Logvin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:34:55 2015 UTC,"Ill concur with this post. I reported a tower issue near where i live, close to DownTown Dallas. After 3 weeks of going back and forth with TMO they told me they needed more back haul. Im on month 2 of waiting for them to get that fixed. At least they follow up with me every few weeks to ask me if speeds are better."
tmobile,3d7710,IAmSixNine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:43:03 2015 UTC,Yah sometimes you gotta call up AT&T or Verizon who is the local backhaul provider. They are not exactly speedy to help us out.
tmobile,3d7710,Logvin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:57:29 2015 UTC,They told me it was Time Warner Cable holding up the process.  On a side note TWC told me last month when i purchased my own modem that they had planned upgrades in my area in October and since i purchased a modem that was compliant with upgrades my service would go from 15 down and 1 up to 50 down and 5 up for the same price. So my guess is TMO is also waiting on the same upgrade since im about a half mile from the tower.  Even though its been an ongoing issue im still glad the TMO reps contact me every few weeks to ask me if i have noticed a difference. That lets me know they have not forgotten about me or my issue. Im just surprised that a tower in that location has gone so long with out being upgraded.

I'd just like to understand the bill I  am being given a bit more.  but part of these taxes are also not mandated by the state or federal gov, but by tmobile themselves which is about about 5 dollars of the 7.75 being collected on taxes."
tmobile,3d74g7,freddudek,3,Tue Jul 14 01:42:51 2015 UTC,"The way your bill breaks down is that you have an account level charge. So let's say if your on 2 for $100, your account level charge is $100. That account level charge is taxed. Now by default on this plan, the two lines are each ""billed"" $0, plus any additional features (JUMP, international calling, etc). There are fees associated with the line, such as the Federal Universal Service Fund fee, and then any applicable sales tax on features if there are any.   Again, taxes are a government issue not a T-Mobile one."
tmobile,3d74g7,robondes,0,Tue Jul 14 01:52:21 2015 UTC,"again, thanks for explaining taxes are done by the government.  but part of the fee's (not taxes) listed in that section are not by the government and are solely determined by tmobile themselves.  the ones done by the government are clearly listed and separated as such.

Your Account (plan) is taxed and feed. Then each line is taxed and feed. Under account you will have FUSF and State/Local Tax. Each line will have FUSF, RPF, State/Local Tax, and 911. Your bill also has the following statement... T-Mobile fees and charges include (i) a Regulatory Programs Fee (which helps to recover some of our costs incurred complying with local, state and federal governmental mandates and programs, including, but not limited to, E911, local number portability and number pooling); (ii) state and federal universal service fund charges (to recovery charges imposed on us by the government to support universal service); (iii) other governmental assessments on us including, without limitation, gross receipt and excise taxes.

They are sacrificing older technology to make that happen and i believe Chicago has had a lot of network upgrades.   So what i think is happening is your having trouble connecting reliably because a lot of what is around you has been converted to LTE. Try a different / newer phone and i bet that will help a lot.

If you are on ETF and not Edge, you can trade in any old phone (even buy one from Best Buy...) then purchase a new T-Mobile phone. Again, it can be a junk phone if you would like to continue using your iPhone.   When me and my wife ported two weeks ago, she opted to keep her iPhone as a backup and just purchased a new iPhone on the Jump on Demand plan. That way she can now get a iPhone 6S when it comes out, and if she ever needs it, she still has her VZW iPhone. We happened to have an old phone that T-Mobile happily took in trade to get the ETF payback.   I highly recommend doing this in a corporate T-Mobile store. The employee new exactly what to do, and we were in and out in about an hour. It a very positive experience."

You get 3 months for free.  For the ETF issue, it's a reimbursement and not a pay off. That means you have to spend money out of your own pocket but you would eventually get a prepaid credit with the value. T-Mobile also doesn't cover taxes. You also need to trade in any phone and buy any phone. On the positive side, if you're on a contract you end up getting an iPhone for 1/2 the price of retail."
tmobile,3d61tr,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:44:27 2015 UTC,All of your options require you to go out of pocket at least some amount.  To qualify for the ETF reimbursement you must: - Trade in a phone - Buy a phone - Port a number - Submit paperwork showing ETF charges incurred - Wait a couple months for a gift card equivalent to the ETF amount (paying the ETF on your own in the meantime).

The iPhone 6 is identical for tmobile and verizon (though it can be a hassle to active it if you were going the other way). Verizon phones are unlocked, so if you pay it off you can bring it with you and use it on tmobile and it will be exactly the same as if you bought it from tmobile (you even get wifi calling).

I suppose I'm not the person to ask, because not including Spotify, I only use about 7GB a month.  As for the speedtest bit, I'm pretty sure Speedtest.net takes up data. I used it a ton the first month I had TMo because I was shocked at how much faster they were than Sprint.   About two weeks ago I got a defective refib from TMo and I had the speedtest.net app on there and they still had me test on a DSLreports.com HTML page to get my transfer rate. If they had a deal Ookla they probably would have had me use the app.  As for the phone, I brought it into a store, they checked it out and had a new one overnighted to me at no charge which was nice."

tmobile,3d39fp,Quaternions_FTW,11,Mon Jul 13 04:19:04 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, I live in the Milwaukee suburbs and I switched from Verizon last year. Here are some very important things about T-Mobile in this area:     T-Mobile has a small amount of spectrum in both the Milwaukee and Madison metro areas. This means speeds will be poor. About 5-10 megabits is normal, lower during events and higher in some suburbs. T-Mobile will likely move some spectrum from 3G to LTE in Milwaukee soon, but that will only buy time. It will be many years before T-Mobile could possibly acquire more spectrum and get it online and until then speeds will drop. T-Mobile has no low-band spectrum in Milwaukee or Madison and won't get any in the near future. This means poor coverage in buildings and rural areas, in addition to spotty service overall. Totally different experience than Verizon. It will be several years before T-Mobile could possibly acquire and activate low band spectrum in Wisconsin. Most of the state is not covered. T-Mobile mainly covers a corridor from Illinois to Green Bay, and a corridor from the Milwaukee metro to the Madison metro to Minneapolis. Everything else is either roaming, of which you have a very small allotment, or nothing. Very little retail presence. Verizon has tons of retail stores here, T-Mobile has less than ten in the whole state I think. You'll be interacting with T-Mobile over the phone or online mostly.   Consider the above points very carefully. I would strongly advise trying before you commit with the test drive or prepaid service. While T-Mobile has many great markets, Wisconsin is not one of them."
tmobile,3d39fp,jhulc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:16:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I'm torn, because I brought my sister to Verizon from an unlimited AT&T account (3-6 Mbps usually) and now that its so much faster on Verizon (30+ Mbps) she is chewing up 15 GB is about 25 days.   I think I'm willing to sacrifice the lower speeds of T-Mobile in Milwaukee for not having to pay $60+/month in overages for another 4GB of data.  I'll sleep on it though, and thanks for the info!"
tmobile,3d39fp,jhulc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:26:25 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! Despite the problems, T-Mobile is still an okay option for people with high usage and/or low budgets that are willing to tolerate the worse service. I use more data than I ever dreamed of on Verizon, and I pay less monthly. I do have coverage/service issues but there's usually wifi to be found."
tmobile,3d39fp,anwserman,2,Mon Jul 13 07:40:47 2015 UTC,"That's the funny thing - I'm currently visiting family in the northwoods of Wisconsin where T-Mobile has no native coverage.  I've been roaming on AT&T for the last month, with my whopping 50MB of data.  But the funny thing is... is that AT&T has bad coverage up here as well.  I posted in another thread that there's a tower about a mile from my house, perfect line-of-sight and my coverage drops to 1 bar sometimes.  My friends who live in this area hate AT&T.  Guess when they want to upgrade the towers up here to LTE?  In 2017.  It's a trade-off basically.  I'm happy with T-Mobile, because where I have T-Mobile coverage, it'll be great for the price.  If not, I get to roam on AT&T where the coverage would be horrid if I was their customer, or just roaming on their network ;)"
tmobile,3d39fp,jhulc,2,Mon Jul 13 09:50:27 2015 UTC,"Actually Verizon was the only national carrier to build out a decent network in rural Wisconsin. A bit unusual since AT&T usually mirrors them.

Are the spectrum issues caused by the presence of U.S. Cellular? I am in SE WI and just ported to TMo. The reception in my new job building in the Waukesha area sucks, despite 3-4 bars of LTE outside."
tmobile,3d39fp,jhulc,2,Mon Jul 13 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"No, I'm just an infrastructure/ rf geek ;) Cell carriers aren't usually crazy open about rollouts. Don't expect a ""we upgraded these 5 towers this week, here are the 6 planned for next week"" type of thing. T-Mobile puts out press releases for big milestones/ launches and will put out general projections and updates a few times a year.    As far as Wisconsin goes, the LTE rollout is nearly done. Almost every EDGE-only tower has been upgraded. That information is gleaned from this sub, sensorly, and T-Mobile press releases and investor calls.    There is only so much spectrum to go around. In Wisconsin there's five carriers jockeying for space, while only four exist in many other markets. T-Mobile has really tried to get spectrum here but hasn't been successful. They placed bids on everything available in the recent AWS-3 auction but were outbid, and Dish Network's bidding up of everything didn't help. It's still possible that a spectrum swap with another carrier could happen, or T-Mobile could do a deal with Dish to get access to their assets, but don't hold your breath. Any theoretical fix to our capacity situation is years away from hitting consumers. Both AWS-3 and the Dish spectrum would require new infrastructure and devices. In the short term, capacity will be a big problem for T-Mo here.    The low-band spectrum which T-Mobile has been acquiring and deploying around the country was long ago purchased and deployed by US Cellular here. In the 700 MHz auction that followed the digital TV transition, here's what happened: Verizon busted out their wallet to get 12x12 MHz nationwide in band 13. In band 12 (the upper two-thirds makes up the overlapping band 17), AT&T got either the upper 12x12 or 6x6 nationwide. The remainder of 6x6 or 12x12 was purchased by smaller carriers or various entities (cable companies, investment firms, etc). T-Mobile has bought up the lower 6x6 of band 12 from the non-carrier entities that never found a buyer, in addition to a big unused chunk in a trade from Verizon, and those licenses cover about two thirds of the US population. US Cellular and AT&T have all of band 12 already deployed here, so there is no chance of T-Mo getting it. Another 12 MHz of standalone spectrum was auctioned off, with the intended use being mobile TV. This spectrum was mostly split between AT&T and Qualcomm, with Dish getting small sections. Qualcomm deployed their MediaFLO service with it, and AT&T bought that spectrum when FLO shut down. Theoretically this spectrum could also be used for additional LTE downlink capacity, and AT&T will try that soon. The remaining 700 MHz spectrum was designated for first responder usage. So T-mobile won't have a short term coverage solution here either.    There's other low-band spectrum in the 850 MHz band that was basically given away by the FCC when cell phones first started to exist. AT&T, Verizon, and regionals (including US Cell) have ~all of it. Nearly all of this spectrum is currently tied up with 2G and 3G, but LTE will be here in the future. Sprint got some oddball 800 MHz spectrum from Nextel, which they have deployed. T-Mobile is left out, and is now the only major carrier in many markets without low-band spectrum. This means that rural deployments are impractical and coverage will be bad in those markets.    Next year, spectrum in the 600 MHz band will be auctioned off. TV stations will need to cooperate and further pack their signals together for this to work. While the FCC has set rules favorable for small carriers, that's no guarantee that T-Mo will get anything. Bidding will be fierce. It'll be 2018-2020 until this spectrum is usable by consumers, after TV stations move, equipment is deployed, and devices include it. This is T-Mobile's big chance to get competitive coverage in the long term.    US Cellular is a weird case. They're family run, and their decision making is not normal for a cell carrier. They haven't been much of a competitor lately. My theory is that US Cellular sees themselves being acquired by AT&T or Verizon sometime between now and 2020, and is just trying to pay the bills until then. AT&T and Verizon have been scooping up spectrum as capacity demands have skyrocketed, and US Cellular is a logical next step. Ask /u/magentasoul for more about US Cellular.    T-Mobile's lack of a retail presence in Wisconsin is concerning. Many stores closed several years ago. Now there's less than ten left, scattered around the Milwaukee metro. Nothing at all in Madison, Green Bay, Appleton, FDL, etc bar some resellers. Verizon seems to have stores everywhere.    In Wisconsin, T-Mobile has fought a great battle but is losing. Verizon dominates this state in every way. AT&T picks up second, and Sprint continues to exist.    Wow, that was long. I hope you learned a lot from that."
tmobile,3d39fp,magentasoul,2,Tue Jul 14 04:09:51 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm here for the requested USCC info.  Their owned by the TDS Telecom family. Basically the tldr is that they are too proud of their child to sell it right now, and think its worth more than it is. It was really loosing customers for a while due to a billing system error but they are gaining a few thousand a quarter now.   The way I would describe them is the speeds of Sprint with the coverage of AT&T. Although they may be proud of places like Wisconsin, Verizon actually has more (and better quality and capacity) LTE in Wisconsin that. USCC. They are now just starting to say they are going to try VoLTE in some markets on some phones sometime soon.   Their network is nothing to brag about, and they sit on all the spectrum T Mobile uses (700A, PCS, AWS).  They need to be eliminated.   Feel free to circle jerk about their existence at /r/tmobilecirclejerk"
tmobile,3d39fp,piere212,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:40:35 2015 UTC,Maybe we should all email Legere and beg him to buy USCC! That definitely solves the Wisconsin problem once and for all.
tmobile,3d39fp,magentasoul,2,Tue Jul 14 04:44:52 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, it would be billions of dollars for just some spectrum in Wisconsin and a few other states. Also like 5ish million customers. Not worth it, it could be much better invested in the 600 MHz auction."
tmobile,3d39fp,piere212,2,Tue Jul 14 05:30:50 2015 UTC,"I did! So let me ask you. If the prognosis is grave, why do you stick with them? What other solutions could I do to boost my signal? What happens if a Dish/TMo merger happens? Do you see TMo making a move for USC themselves? What about the small companies like Cellcom?"
tmobile,3d39fp,jhulc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:40:45 2015 UTC,"I'm with T-Mo because they are the best fit for my situation right now. I'm on the $30 prepaid plan, which is an incredible value. The limited minutes on that plan don't matter to me because I don't talk on the phone much and I use hangouts/ Google voice. Because of health issues, I don't usually get out much or use a lot of data. I wanted a cheap plan that fits my usage pattern and T-Mo fit the bill. The service issues are usually at least tolerable. Most of the locations where I have no service have wifi. However I do see myself switching away within 1-2 years if I still live in Wisconsin.    I would suggest using wifi calling as much as possible. With native Android support becoming reality, nearly all smartphones should have the capability either now or soon. If that isn't an option, a signal booster can do the job for your home but not really for other locations like work.    I have mixed feelings about a Dish/T-Mo deal. Sure, it would bring tons of spectrum everywhere. Unfortunately Dish has loads of debt which could hurt deployment financing, and they have some unsavory business practices (unlike the progressive attitude of late at T-Mo). Maybe it could work out, maybe it won't.    I see Verizon and AT&T as being the only carriers with the cash to make a move on US Cellular. T-Mobile is financially strung out right now between network upgrades and promotions. I have no clue where T-Mo plans on getting the money for the 600 MHz auction.    As far as small companies, there's no one answer. Some with bleak prospects or owners that want out will sell to Verizon or AT&T, or maybe US Cellular. I don't see T-Mobile or Sprint making lots of acquisitions, for the reasons in the last paragraph (Sprint is in the same financial boat as T-mobile). Other operators that have good spectrum, networks, and customers will continue on in their niche. Many small companies have deals through Verizon's LTE in Rural America or other carrier's similar programs that give them access to spectrum and nationwide coverage. In those areas, the big carriers don't have much of a presence."

tmobile,3d39fp,jhulc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:30:01 2015 UTC,"According to Sensorly and T-Mobile's maps, about 80% of the drive from Madison to La Crosse has LTE. This is confirmed by other user reports on this sub.  The immediate area around La Crosse only has HSPA+ ""4G"" due to a spectrum limitation.    Does your phone have band 2 LTE? Without that, you'll be seeing only EDGE on the upgraded rural towers."

tmobile,3d39fp,jhulc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:43:54 2015 UTC,T-Mobile's own maps show a lot more. Additionally the T-Mobile signal is weak due to tower spacing so Sensorly shows very faint colors.
tmobile,3d39fp,homestar92,4,Tue Jul 14 22:17:13 2015 UTC,"I have family in that area (Muskego, specifically) and I've found that in Milwaukee proper, I get great service, but in any of the surrounding suburbs, I barely get 2G. Go a bit farther north, and you're roaming on Bug Tussle Wireless (yes, that's a thing, and apparently it's a proper network and not someone's MVNO).  Definitely do test drive. That region is very finicky on T-Mobile. You'll want to make sure it works well in the places that you frequent."
tmobile,3d39fp,anwserman,3,Mon Jul 13 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"I had excellent service in Madison with T-Mobile (visiting), and same for Milwaukee as well - however, you might have poor indoor reception because of the lack of Band12.  Anything above the cities and you're SOL.  However, once T-Mobile gets the Edge-to-LTE program finished, you'd have excellent coverage all from Milwaukee to the Twin Cities along I-94.  This is especially true in River Falls/Eau Claire, where they have rights to Band 12 spectrum, IIRC.  I just drove up from Illinois to Madison through the northwoods, and I had good T-Mobile coverage until about 30 minutes north of Madison.  Otherwise, everything else was fast and zippy.  Granted, you're in Milwaukee - different licensing - but I didn't have any issues, besides indoor reception in some places."

Not anymore. T-Mobile will pay off your remaining phone payments from your old carrier. Just trade in your devices and we’ll cover your remaining phone payments with a trade-in credit and Visa Prepaid Card when you switch to the Un-carrier.   I was told by T-Mobile rep: $350/line on phone contract ETF and $300/line on phone payment plan ETF.  So, I would think that this applies to EDGE, no?"

I'm sure it'll be more common once they start using carrier aggregation with band 2 + 4 band 12 +2."

The repeater is only good if you get some signal in one part of the house and NO signal in the other part, if you get even 1-2 bars of LTE, the repeater won't help. The WiFi router is exactly that, a WiFi router which works in conjunction with WiFi calling but I think it offers a better experience in most cases."

My coworker on Verizon was planning on going overseas and wanted to get a local SIM with Nexus 6 working. I told he was already ready to go and to prove it, threw my TMo SIM in his phone. Nexus 6 connected to TMo network right away and LTE was working great. When we put his Verizon SIM back in, it reconnected back to Verizon network."
tmobile,3d2fwz,rabbit994,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true.   Original deal with FCC for LTE was to have it factory unlocked for non-USA network providers.

tmobile,3czp0c,VernDozier,2,Sun Jul 12 16:42:32 2015 UTC,It depends on what market you're in. The panels could potentially look nothing like that if you are in a NSN market.
tmobile,3czp0c,atyppo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:04 2015 UTC,"Usually, the company who built the tower is the highest on the tower.  If there is additional antenna array, it's because a leading agreement was signed.  Also, when it comes to the business of leasing, generally, a position higher on the tower (called ""centerline"") costs more per month in rent.  Higher antennas means those specific signals travel further.  So generally speaking, if there's three arrays, and it's ""known"" that t-mobile is the closest to the bottom, it generally means it's a PCS/AWS tower (cellular signals travel further requiring fewer antennas) and t-mobile, to save money, didn't build the antennas until customers started to complain."

Sure I completely love the 2 for $100 deal. But didn't know I had to pay more from when I did the promotion. I do understand that no other major carriers offers anything, but that is not a reason valid to why I should pay more because they introduced 2 for $100 saying it's 2 for $100! NOT 2 for $100 and pay $10 for every future amp'd feature that will come. That is unacceptable. I didn't join T-Mobile or become a T-Mobile customer to be nickel and dime'd."

The original deal was 2 Lines, unlimited Talk/Text/Data (with some throttling at certain point) in United States with Unlimited Texting/2G Data and .20c a minute most countries internationally. They are still honoring that deal. They are offering you option for 10 bucks to get new feature you have because you don't qualify for it.   TMobile is a business. This UnCarrier AMP isn't non-profit trying to change the world, it's a business with slick marketing at end of day and they want to make money. My guess is margins on 2/100 are so tight that giving you this feature would cause them to lose money. This is known as BAD THING to business people.  Now you have a choice, you can continue to fork over money to TMobile and let them provide the service they originally agreed to or you can pay them a little extra and get additional service you want/need.

tmobile,3d4t7v,ehooper733,-18,Mon Jul 13 15:09:55 2015 UTC,That doesn't make any sense. Why would I do that if I have two lines that will just increase the cost and make the promotion irreverent in according to my post about the amp'd feature -.-

I can see that it would normally cost well over $100. Sure so I saved if I was to get two separate lines. But if I got the promotion I wouldn't be saving because I would pay the price of the promotion. I would save if actually did pay more in that case I didn't. But to be stripped of an upgraded feature everyone is getting and the only way to get it if only I paid $10 more? Bogus. You keep thinking like a small minded individual and you will end up following small minded results. I don't care what you accomplish, although I can expect you to come back with being okay and ordinary as the average next joe to the next to ""rebuttal this discussion as a complaint""."

My add-on data plan only gave me 2GB of data, not 3GB like Simple Choice customers, and it counted against everything even speed tests.  But I knew why that was and I was okay with not having certain features - I paid $50 for 2 lines with unlimited minutes and could add and remove data at will.   You wanted cheap unlimited data plan, you got it, you're not entitled to anything else that isn't in your original agreement with T-Mobile.

Because paying would be after with discounts. You are out of your mind for being so ignorant.

I've used a few WinPhone devices, and this one is really the best overall package I've seen in the Lumia line on T-Mo.  It really does come down to that for it's price, it performs incredibly well. Way better than a $100 phone should. So you're right on one hand, but on the other, it's truly one of the most pleasant phone experiences I've had.

It appears that the AT&T Lumia 1520 supports LTE on Bands 2 & 4, which are two of the three bands that T-Mobile uses for LTE coverage.  It looks like the only real advantage you'll have with the 640 over your 1520 is that the 640 supports LTE on Band 12.    Do you know if you're in a Band 12 coverage area?  You can find out using the ""Spectrum Gateway"" link over on the sidebar.  Band 12 (or 700 MHz) will help with building penetration."

Then rested at an intersection next to a tower i always get 50mbps + down and 20Mbps up. I was still getting less than 1mbps down and up until i toggled airplane mode and it magically jumped to 50mbps down and 20 mbps up go figure. This happens every now and then. Im in Los Angeles.

tmobile,3d2akz,PerformanceGM,2,Mon Jul 13 05:31:42 2015 UTC,80/month for 1 phone unlimited isn't a promo plan.

tmobile,3d2akz,CMChor17,2,Mon Jul 13 00:10:26 2015 UTC,Go in store or call them and ask them to add it on
tmobile,3d2akz,Logvin,11,Mon Jul 13 00:34:57 2015 UTC,That's the normal international throttle. Actually quite worse. You have been able to roam on telcel LTE for a while. Full speeds won't kick in until the 15th when you opt-in to new plan
tmobile,3d2akz,alex_villa,-4,Sun Jul 12 23:22:04 2015 UTC,"this is my first time roaming on Telcel LTE I've had Tmobile for a year and a half and it always been 3G, I hope the speed changes on the 15th as you said."
tmobile,3d2akz,ilikebrownbananas,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"So in the past we had a 3G roaming agreement with Telcel. We upgraded that agreement a month ago to LTE. This normally would only affect people who purchased an additional international ""speed pass"" when they were there. Your phone is connecting to LTE, but being throttled to slow speeds. This is 100% expected until the 15th when the new stuff kicks in."
tmobile,3d2akz,Logvin,-2,Mon Jul 13 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"that's the thing thou, everyone keeps saying that T-mobile had an agreement with Telcel, but for the past year and a half when I was in roaming in Mexico my phone would say moviestar.    Anyways, I'll wait for the 15th for the full speed."
tmobile,3d2akz,istealthbro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:29:54 2015 UTC,I was in Mexico last year and I had service with Telcel.

tmobile,3d2akz,sparkpar44,6,Mon Jul 13 15:53:15 2015 UTC,"You do realize it goes live on the 15th? And you're just using the ""unlimited edge"" speeds we've had for months?"
tmobile,3d2akz,dtsm888,-10,Sun Jul 12 23:35:29 2015 UTC,4GLTE =/= EDGE.   I've had 3G roaming with moviestar in Mexico before today.
tmobile,3d2akz,Ivanovee,9,Mon Jul 13 00:11:07 2015 UTC,4GLTE with a software throttle to EDGE speeds = exactly what you are supposed to get.
tmobile,3d2akz,dsulli37,7,Mon Jul 13 03:13:50 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how you can blame T-Mobile for a network they don't own or maintain.... But OK!
tmobile,3d2akz,dylan5567,-9,Sun Jul 12 23:59:35 2015 UTC,Because I'm certain there was a contract and money exchange in order for T-mobile users to use Telcel network.   I have a Telcel SIM card and their native speeds are much faster.
tmobile,3d2akz,ruben3232,12,Mon Jul 13 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"As you've already figured out, that new agreement doesn't start until the 15. Not to mention the usage you describes breaks T-Mobile's TOS"
tmobile,3czoys,Inspirasion,9,Sun Jul 12 06:20:28 2015 UTC,"I'm being deprioritized    I feel like this is the new go-to accusation for every problem T-Mobile has. T-Mobile only deprioritizes people on unlimited plans after using 21GB on congested towers.   If you can, try restarting the phone/switching phone temporarily/switching sim card."
tmobile,3czoys,Deceptiveideas,-1,Sun Jul 12 06:54:50 2015 UTC,"Re-read please. I'm well aware of how they deprioritize...I just said ""it looks like.."" Not that I actually am. I know what it's like as my main phone is on an unlimited data line and I know what it's like once I've hit that threshold. I usually am not deprioritized at all (even when i surpass the so called ""limit"") when I'm at my home tower, as it's not congested.   I've observed this happening on this secondary line that isn't an unlimited data line, which is why it's odd."
tmobile,3czoys,Deceptiveideas,3,Sun Jul 12 07:17:09 2015 UTC,"I just reread it. ""It looks like I'm being deproiortized"". I don't see anything about feeling and the use of ""looks like"" is often used when you're saying something is happening.  I mean you can give 611 a call about it. Could be something more on their end and they could confirm issues."
tmobile,3czoys,somedatapacket,3,Sun Jul 12 07:19:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry...mistyped. It's late. I'm experiencing the same issue as this user.. https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/3cyg7s/lte_extremely_slow_until_airplane_mode_toggle/  It happens randomly and I'm presuming it may be an IMEI mismatch issue or something along those lines as Android reports that the number associated with this sim is with my primary line, which is odd. I doubt tier 1 would help me. I'm already dealing with another issue with 611 that I'm still waiting to hear back on."
tmobile,3czoys,expertzero,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:27:08 2015 UTC,I think it's very helpful to take the new transparency around prioritization thresholds into account so that network or device issues like this can be addressed productively.
tmobile,3cxr1g,thisisclaytonk,40,Sat Jul 11 18:53:02 2015 UTC,"Well three things. First, they arent merged as one company, DT just owns the majority of the shares, as tmobile is currently a public company.  Second off, they run independent of DT.  Third, they have about half the market cap of Verizon."
tmobile,3cxr1g,TheElement115,4,Sat Jul 11 19:00:10 2015 UTC,"Being a public company means nothing. As you stated, they're majority owned by DT. Regardless of the smaller shareholders, DT approves their funding, budgets and roadmap."

tmobile,3cxr1g,medikit,3,Sat Jul 11 22:59:33 2015 UTC,"well, legere and the management team is the company (since they make decisions that affect company day-to-day). Legere &co have to answer to the board of directors  board of directors answer to shareholders (aka DT)  so if legere disappears (move to another company, or forced out by DT), then you might support or hate the new guy in charge.."
tmobile,3cxr1g,pwastage,16,Sat Jul 11 23:18:22 2015 UTC,"It's easy to overlook. If anything I take comfort that DT is allowing them to do this. John is qouted as saying Tim Hottges has told him before ""Don't you think you're doing too much?""  But we still get uncarrier moves.   Bottom line, I'd like to see T-Mobile get big enough to buy itself back from DT. Hell given the options I'd rather have Dish own T-Mobile over DT. At least then we are 'Murican."
tmobile,3cxr1g,PerformanceGM,4,Sat Jul 11 19:00:34 2015 UTC,I'd rather have Dish own T-Mobile over DT   That makes one of us! I'd prefer TmoUS to buy Dish but I doubt that'd happen. It'd be great if Tmo had the big chunk of spectrum that Dish has so as to be on par for the future against Sprint's BRS 2.5ghz and ATT's 2.3ghz WCS... but Dish's culture seems like it'd mix with the uncarrier's like oil and water.  There I go again ranting the same old rant again.
tmobile,3cxr1g,zakats,5,Sun Jul 12 01:39:38 2015 UTC,TMUs isn't going to buy anyone. DT wants to unload them as fast as possible for as much as possible

tmobile,3cxr1g,zakats,4,Sun Jul 12 02:17:48 2015 UTC,"Being part of a big corporation isn't necessarily a bad thing. Google, Apple and Microsoft are big corporations, and the likelihood is high that one of them had a hand in the development of the phone you're using to access whatever carrier you use. Yet most of us are unlikely to take issue with that and ditch whatever phone we have, switching to, say, a Meizu MX4 running Ubuntu or a Cherry Mobile Ace running Firefox OS.  As for being foreign, I'm not sure why that's a problem, either.  Many people buy foreign cars (even my Chevy has German and Korean parts in it).  There isn't a single cell phone being made today in the US. And unless you're using a Mac Pro, your computer wasn't made in the US, either.  The issue is less about ""big corporations"" or ""foreign corporations,"" and more about what those corporations do. Bottom line: AT&T and Verizon are charging customers higher prices, and allowing them less data for their money.  They give you coverage in less populated places, sure, but if you aren't traveling to those places much at all, then the higher price isn't so justified.  Then there's the outright nasty things they do.  AT&T and Verizon are on a mission to gut landline service.. They've refused to repair landlines after storms, and won't upgrade them to fiber. Why? Because they'd like to force landline users to pay more for dedicated wireless service instead. Why let residential internet customers pay $40 a month for unlimited Fiber or DSL internet, when you can take that option away and instead charge them $40 for just 2GB?  Anyway, that's why i prefer to support T-Mobile.  For me, T-Mobile gives me a lot more data for less money, and the money I'm paying for my service isn't rewarding bad corporate behavior. I'm glad that they're part of a larger company, because it gives them some resources to compete. And so far, I've yet to read anything that indicates DT is nearly as greedy towards their customers as the de facto duopoly is here."
tmobile,3cxr1g,tubezninja,4,Sun Jul 12 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"I don't delude myself into thinking tmobile is doing this out of the goodness of their heart, they're doing it because it caused people to sign up for tmobile and leave other carriers for tmobile, increasing tmobile's profits.  Since the company they're owned by seems to either be happy or apathetic to what they're doing, I don't see it as a big deal.  Unfortunately cell service (without some sort of regulatory changes like in Europe) seems to require huge outlays of cash to be competitive. Buy spectrum at huge prices, then put up a vast network of towers at huge prices.  I think tmobile is doing the best we can possibly get in this situation."
tmobile,3cxr1g,RedPill115,3,Sat Jul 11 22:21:11 2015 UTC,"I was listening to the 'Daily Tech News Show' podcast the other day and someone brought up an interesting point saying the longer T-Mobile stays with DT, the harder it is for DT to sell.  T-Mobile is going to keep growing because of Uncarrier and their sheer momentum. The more successful T-Mobile gets, it could be argued that there are less parties who could buy T-Mobile and have it pass through the DOJ, FCC, etc. T-Mobile was garbage when ATT wanted to buy them and even the DOJ fought back. I think at this point, either DT will continue failing at trying to sell T-Mobile or T-Mobile will buy themselves out.  tl;dr: As TMO grows bigger, it becomes harder for DT to sell them with the DOJ and FCC even complaining about the last ATT merger."
tmobile,3cxr1g,mwidjaja1,4,Sat Jul 11 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"Isn't DT done giving TmoUS money? If that's the case, DT owning TmoUS is pretty irrelevant.  They're on their own."

tmobile,3cxr1g,expertzero,2,Sun Jul 12 00:20:23 2015 UTC,"To me the issue isn't size, its the actions. T-Mobile treats me like a customer should be.  I don't need more than that.

tmobile,3cxr1g,thetinguy,4,Sat Jul 11 23:20:16 2015 UTC,I 100% support this. I am anti ATT and Verizon because of the massive amount of tracking that they do.
tmobile,3cxr1g,zakats,-1,Sun Jul 12 03:55:00 2015 UTC,How is purchasing service from a slightly smaller corporation more ethical?
tmobile,3cxr1g,thetinguy,2,Sat Jul 11 23:21:43 2015 UTC,"Not because it's smaller, but because their business practices are more consumer friendly: If ATT/Verizon spend millions on lobbying against net neutrality, that ends up better for us as customers who benefit from free internet; Comcast/Time Warner are usually referred to as terrible options because of their business practices which result in higher prices, slower speed, and so forth. Business practices manifest into big differences for us as customers."
tmobile,3cxr1g,zakats,-2,Sun Jul 12 05:38:31 2015 UTC,"You think T-Mobile cares about network neutrality? They are the only network who is breaking it so blatantly.

tmobile,3czn9d,Starks,3,Sun Jul 12 05:57:41 2015 UTC,JOD plus insurance is $2 cheaper per month and there is no 50% minimum to pay off
tmobile,3czn9d,anothercookie90,2,Sun Jul 12 13:17:15 2015 UTC,"Not counting the iPhone promotion, you pay the exact same amount for the phone monthly, and your insurance without JUMP/Lookout protection is $2 cheaper a month with JoD.  If you plan to upgrade more often than once a year, JoD saves you out-of-pocket payments to do so.  If you plan to upgrade less often than every 18 months, JUMP saves you the out-of-pocket lease-buyout charge to wipe off the phone payments.  Different upgrade programs meant for different kinds of people."
tmobile,3czn9d,TheSilenceOfNoOne,2,Sun Jul 12 07:07:09 2015 UTC,"For me it went like this: $27.50 - a month for the Galaxy S5 $10 - a month for Jump $37.50 total a month for the phone. Now JOD $29.60 - A month For the Note 4 $8.60 - A month For the  insurance $38.20 - total a month for the phone. These figures are off by pennies but very close to the exact numbers I was paying per month. Without the upfront taxes on the device out the door,I say this is a great deal!"
tmobile,3czn9d,Dabutchera,2,Sun Jul 12 08:14:29 2015 UTC,Also insurance is a rip-off so I plan on changing to JoD when I pay off half my current phone.  Save $10 every month and get to jump 3 times a year.
tmobile,3czn9d,Crime-WoW,2,Sun Jul 12 13:53:31 2015 UTC,Are you able to switch to JOD after paying off half of the phone? I thought it had to be fully paid off.
tmobile,3czn9d,bf9792,2,Sun Jul 12 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"No, if your current phone falls under one of the older JUMP rules (whether v1 or v2), those rules apply and you can switch to JOD during the upgrade process."

tmobile,3czn9d,mfact50,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:53:17 2015 UTC,Had to deal with a guy who had squaretrade. Thought he was gaming the system but the phone IMEIs don't match and so we couldn't upgrade him.
tmobile,3czn9d,robondes,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't think it is fair saying he was trying to game the system. Their plans are great and they are easy to work with. But yeah, when you don't ""own"" your device things can be messy. For regular Jump, your guy should have had T-Mo/ Assurion deal with it and gotten reimbursed by SquareTrade."
tmobile,3czn9d,mfact50,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"If you're eligible for a jump now, jump to the cheapest phone they'll allow you to jump to. I think it's an Alcatel it something. Then pay that one off immediately, in store. Then you are good for JOD. Should cost about $80, much less than what you probably owe now."
tmobile,3czn9d,JelliedHam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:10:35 2015 UTC,They're for different people. Jump Lease seems like its for the super frequent jumpers. I'm sure it would be more expensive after adding in insurance.
tmobile,3czn9d,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll have no reason to Jump that much.  JOD doesn't seem to make sense for people looking to hop on the Nexus train this year and upgrade 1 year later for the next one."
tmobile,3czn9d,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:50:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the promotion is still going on for the iPhone 6, but I recall someone saying you save around $150 by going on the JoD using the promotional price. $150 off retail is a pretty good deal for a brand new phone. In this scenario you're not upgrading, just using the promotional credit and paying off the phone.  For yearly, JUMP is probably the best choice since the upgrade is at 50% (which is basically 12 months/once a year)"
tmobile,3czn9d,dumbelts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:52:28 2015 UTC,"I did JOD just because I could get the iPhone I had already for less than on Verizon, and then when the next one comes out I'll be ready immediately."

tmobile,3cxhkq,wwtectmo,9,Sat Jul 11 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"LTE is data only; so VoLTE supports high quality audio from the start.  Though, based on the fact that they're refarming certain bands of 3G for LTE—the answer would most likely be no. But it's not just going to be removed entirely the way EDGE is soon said to be."
tmobile,3cxhkq,brian_acalderon,3,Sat Jul 11 17:53:38 2015 UTC,"are they actually removing EDGE? I thought they were just upgrading everywhere that was EDGE to LTE. I can't imagine they would remove their voice fallback, I would be SoL with voice at my work then."
tmobile,3cxhkq,mitten_mike,0,Sun Jul 12 01:31:21 2015 UTC,Yes. EDGE is not the voice fallback; calls can be made over HSPA/HSPA+ and now LTE with VoLTE. Making calls possible on all of T-Mobile's technologies.  If your device does not support 3.9G LTE—then you need to upgrade. This will allow you to place calls on VoLTE where only 3.9G LTE is available and wifi calling where there is no service at all.
tmobile,3cxhkq,brian_acalderon,2,Sun Jul 12 10:23:02 2015 UTC,EDGE is the voice fallback in EDGE+LTE conversion areas. They will have to keep EDGE for longer because of M2M and because it's the only fallback outside of metros. I could see EDGE refarming occurring quicker in metro areas though.
tmobile,3cxhkq,evan1123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:31:39 2015 UTC,No. If a device doesn't have LTE and they remove EDGE—the voice fallback would be 3G services. They didn't say they're decommissioning Slow-G entirely.
tmobile,3cxhkq,brian_acalderon,3,Sun Jul 12 17:45:14 2015 UTC,There is no WCDMA/HSPA+ in EDGE+LTE  conversion areas
tmobile,3cxhkq,evan1123,0,Sun Jul 12 17:51:30 2015 UTC,That means there is no fallback with only 2 options.
tmobile,3cxhkq,brian_acalderon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:56:42 2015 UTC,???? EDGE is the fallback for LTE in those areas.
tmobile,3cxhkq,evan1123,0,Sun Jul 12 17:59:36 2015 UTC,???? There can't be a fallback if there's only 2 options.
tmobile,3cxhkq,brian_acalderon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"Uhhh yes, the fallback for LTE is EDGE. Non LTE devices (few and far between) are the only ones without a fallback in those areas."
tmobile,3cxhkq,evan1123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:26:36 2015 UTC,Seems kind of foolish to remove edge.
tmobile,3cxhkq,mitten_mike,5,Sun Jul 12 10:48:01 2015 UTC,"Seems like no to me, due to the fact that they are actively shutting down HSPA. I don't see it happening. But I'm not an employee nor an engineer."
tmobile,3cxhkq,TheElement115,3,Sat Jul 11 17:48:55 2015 UTC,So eventually it will be all LTE?
tmobile,3cxhkq,TheElement115,5,Sat Jul 11 17:50:14 2015 UTC,"That's my guess. Most modern phones hitting the market have VoLTE, but there's obviously TONS of non-volte phones out there so EDGE will be around for a while, but I don't see the need to waste spectrum on HSPA."
tmobile,3cxhkq,atyppo,4,Sat Jul 11 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile is not actively shutting down PCS HSPA, only AWS HSPA. Eventually will it happen? Probably. Right now? No."
tmobile,3cxhkq,krispykracker1,8,Sat Jul 11 18:28:50 2015 UTC,Next year they'll start refarming some PCS HSPA and aggregating it.
tmobile,3cxhkq,icepick_,11,Sat Jul 11 18:32:15 2015 UTC,I doubt it.  Next year will start putting out lte on pcs in Metro areas.   HSPA is dead /dying.

tmobile,3cxhkq,krispykracker1,4,Sun Jul 12 00:48:37 2015 UTC,Aren't we saying the same thing?
tmobile,3cxhkq,RedPill115,4,Sat Jul 11 22:05:09 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say for sure though. My phone can often connect to 4g (hspa+) when it cannot connect to 4g lte, I don't have a way of knowing if that's because hspa+ is on a better band or something.  They might keep hspa+ around for slightly better building penetration, just keep it on a narrow slice of spectrum that phones only connect to if lte doesn't penetrate far enough."
tmobile,3cxhkq,OtherAlan,3,Sat Jul 11 22:23:09 2015 UTC,"I don't see it happening either. Not everyone's going to have a new phone every two or so years. I know a lot of people that still are on 3g phones, or HSDPA devices. It works, and they don't need the fanciest stuff so they are going to stick with it.   This is really where the market is now. EDGE is getting replaced because it's a much older technology. The only support I see them dropping is really old feature phones. Even the newer onescan pick up a 4g signal these days."
tmobile,3cxhkq,michieru695,2,Sat Jul 11 20:50:01 2015 UTC,Spectral efficiency is higher on LTE than on HSPA HSPA will most likely maintain and patch the HSPA network but won't upgrade and if they do it's because they are moving it to LTE so that performance and reliability does not degrade to useless. HSPA is still required for the non VoLTE consumer base. As given users in an area upgrade to capable handsets they will refarm spectrum and allocate more to LTE. HSPA should still exist on cellphones for roaming and fallback purposes.
tmobile,3cxhkq,kinkhunter,2,Sat Jul 11 21:26:45 2015 UTC,HSPA is still required for the non VoLTE consumer base. As given users in an area upgrade to capable handsets they will refarm spectrum and allocate more to LTE. HSPA should still exist on cellphones for roaming and fallback purposes.    This. My carrier at the moment is a Canadian one called Wind Mobile and we have a roaming agreement with T-Mobile. The devices that Wind offers don't have LTE (all the time) so that's probably why HSPA will be around for awhile to come.
tmobile,3cxhkq,nauticalfiesta,2,Sun Jul 12 11:21:03 2015 UTC,"I think we'll see a small percentage of the network reserved for GSM/EDGE (there's a need for it since AT&T will be sunsetting their 2G network fairly soon, P2P devices would only need a SIM card swap, rather than a hardware update. There's a huge potential for growth here.)  And within the next 5 years we'll see a huge growth in LTE devices, everything, likely including ""feature phones"" will have VoTLE and/or WiFi calling on it (or some sort of VOIP).   As much as we hate to admit it, decommissioning the EDGE network would cost more than it would save, at least in the short term. AMPS stuck around for much longer than it should have for this very reason (well, and the FCC mandated it, but still.)"

tmobile,3cyymw,50atomic,2,Sun Jul 12 01:45:29 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that PCs usually can't differentiate between a terrestrial internet connection and a mobile hotspot connection. Therefore, applications and websites will run their services with less restriction than on an equivalent mobile app on your phone or tablet. For example, YouTube will restrict the quality of your video over cellular on the mobile app yet you can stream 4K video on a computer over a mobile hotspot. Not just that though, your computer could be running background tasks that are constantly gathering data over the network, especially if there's an update available for your OS.  So to answer your question, yes. 5 GB used in a hour of constant video streaming is a strong possibility.  If you're going to tether a mobile connection to your computer, I would personally make sure non-essential applications are off, turn off automatic updates, and in general don't use video streaming services. If you want to use video streaming services anyway, make sure there's an option to downgrade the quality to avoid heavy data usage."

tmobile,3cxdpc,FR4NOx,3,Sat Jul 11 17:13:49 2015 UTC,"I should clarify that I never changed it, it seems like it was changed automatically due to inactivity?"
tmobile,3cxdpc,OffhandOnion,7,Sat Jul 11 18:43:36 2015 UTC,That is correct. It will change to that plan due to inactivity.
tmobile,3cxdpc,OffhandOnion,3,Sat Jul 11 18:48:45 2015 UTC,"Mmm so 90 days of inactivity leads to a dead account.  That is annoying and doesn't match what I was told by T-Mobile when I signed up for pre-paid service.  Is that specific to the $30 plan?  It isn't the end of the world, I was using it pretty rarely now that AT&T had improved some coverage dead spots when I was traveling to Dallas or Oregon.  I was just planning on activating it for my Daughter to use during our vacation next week.     In the end  it isn't a huge deal since the SIM's are .99 via Amazon and I don't care about the number so I will just order a new Sim and never keep a credit on the account going forward."
tmobile,3cxdpc,ruben3232,4,Sat Jul 11 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"Usually it isn't a dead account. It only is in your case because the T-Mo employees will lack the ability to change it to that $30 plan.   It is not specific to the $30 plan, but the other plans you'd be able to just switch back in a store as long as you add the required funds."

The situation is this: the further north you get in Idaho, the worse the service gets for now. In Boise, I consistently expirenced 30mbps and above, with the highest speed test I had being at the airport, about 95mbps. There's LOTS of 2G even in southern idaho, but as you all know that's all getting upgraded. They are also building new towers, infact my town of 3000 people is getting a new tower. By the end of the year, coverage here will be solid. There's also one place between my town and idaho falls where I get better coverage than Verizon. Also, in Stanley idaho, tmobile is getting lte, making them the first carrier to have native lte. (Verizon has roaming, att has Hspa).  Like I said. Very solid."

I saw that everyone outside the states had it, and was heavily weighing my options of importing one without a warranty. I contacted Sony several times throughout the month, and they only said something along the lines of ""it will be coming out soon/eventually"" but never gave specifics.  Strangely enough, roughly one month after tmobile released the phone, the Sony store was selling the unlocked version......   What lends me to further believe this ""one month"" wait time, is that ... when the ORIGINAL Xperia Z came out, Sony had the unlocked one out for roughly one month also before T-Mobile had it. I only remember all of these details, as I was the ONLY kid on the block with a Xperia Z and even had the phone before Maxim mag did an expose on it !

If it's only $2.50 - I would definitely just buy a new sim, it's the safer way to go, and it seems pointless to spend money on a sim card cutter you're going to use once.  You just throw out the old sim, and they transfer your # to the new sim.  I have bought this sim adapter kit and used it: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CF5ETH8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage  But I wouldn't bother spending money on it unless I knew for sure I was going to use the old phone."

tmobile,3cy5up,michieru695,3,Sat Jul 18 00:22:42 2015 UTC,Call T-mobile and enable SMS shortcodes. This is blocked by default to prevent spam and charges on your line. I am assuming you transferred your phone line correct?  If not you will need your old line to receive the SMS since that's the one that's registered on your iCloud account.

tmobile,3cy5up,ruben3232,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:08:42 2015 UTC,I will call T-mobile again and verify that the block is off. Another thing I would do as a sanity check is to head over to the store and place the SIM on a standard phone and see if the verification SMS comes through. This eliminates the iPhone from being the culprit. You should get every attempt you made thus far come in all at once. If you still did not get the SMS then it's a T-mobile and network issue or your port was not completed successfully.  The reason I mention this block is due to the longest time I was attempting to use a PIN for Paypal and I got a error code saying not authorized. It took 24 hours until the function started to work correctly.
tmobile,3cy5up,ruben3232,2,Sun Jul 12 05:50:44 2015 UTC,Call apple and talk to iCloud people. They will verify your device with a special system and you will need to authorize the iCloud Keychain from that other device. This will also make it so your account won't need a phone number to verify your identity.   Once all that is done and you login on your phone to iCloud it will ask you again to set up the whole phone number verification process (like you did it the first time)

Usually we suggest doing the Test Drive to find out: http://explore.t-mobile.com/test-drive-free-trial  I did it and found tmobile had better indoor coverage in my area than verizon did (minneapolis, mn). But it definitely varies based on where you are.  I've been happy I switched. I get better coverage, better prices, and verizon isn't constantly working hard to find a way to screw me out of my unlimited plan. Data speeds are much much better than they were with Verizon.  It really depends on where you live though. Some people have switched and found tmobile had shitty service in their area and regretted it."
tmobile,3cw2y3,RedPill115,2,Sat Jul 11 17:50:58 2015 UTC,Remember T-Mobile is a contract free provider.  You can try the service out and cancel/sell the phones if you're not happy.
tmobile,3cw2y3,Hilbe,2,Sat Jul 11 10:30:25 2015 UTC,There is a grace period to switch back to your old VZW plan right? Because you don't have time to test out the network so I'd say try them for a month and if you don't like it switch back to Verizon.
tmobile,3cw2y3,_FluX23,2,Sat Jul 11 12:56:21 2015 UTC,"I switched from Verizon a little over a year ago. I was also grandfathered into the unlimited, but the cost was just too much. We don't get the coverage that we used to (Verizon is one of the few companies that has coverage up at my grandfather's house in BFE), but the service is still pretty good and speedy, and we saved about sixty bucks a month. Just decided to upgrade our phones (husband finally joining the rest of the world in smartphone use), and even with the additional 16.66/mo for monthly payments on both phones, we're still saving quite a bit over Verizon.   I see a lot of people talking about customer service, I have no complaints on either Verizon or T-Mobile, though. They've both always been excellent for me, when I've had to deal with them. I would check out the coverage maps, especially paying attention to the hexagons where they're showing what they've gotten from customer data, and go from there. If they have good coverage where you are usually, it's not a bad switch.   And of course, you can upgrade whenever you want, and either pay upfront or pay monthly and you don't have to worry about any data overage charges, if you happened to go over whatever amount you paid for. So those may be some big pluses over Verizon. (Especially if they are going to be kicking everyone off of the grandfathered plans.)"

And T-mobile may think that the good price they want is a little to high. so they start a long few months of negotiations to try to haggle the price down. This is if tmobile thinks they can talk the price down to a reasonable offer. And in my thinking since John has answered 700mhz coming to phoenix soon questions on periscope I think that tmobile and ab licences co is getting close to a deal for their licences.

tmobile,3ctpsy,B1GEast,8,Fri Jul 10 19:57:41 2015 UTC,When T-Mobile started to press on the FCC to reserve low band spectrum they provided an economic study that shows if they deploy LTE in high cost areas in 15 states they will need $132 million for 700 MHz or $500 million for 1900 MHz network in annual subsidy (meaning the revenue from rural subscribers won't cover all operating expenses).

I doubt that it effects the property values, though I can only speak for the bits in the quiet zone that are already in BFE, people already tend to have satellite, since cable doesn't run that far, and they're quite a bit away from antenna being very useful (though Grandpa had one up on a large pole for a while before he got Satellite, and could usually pick up stations from Roanoke. He lives near WVa border). People around in that area tend to like the quiet and peacefulness, anyway, so likely aren't going to be bothered much by lack of strong signals like that. It's very peaceful up there...  Now wiki mentions the cities that are in the quiet zone, and it includes Staunton (Stan-ton, for those of you not from VA. Not as it looks like it should be pronounced ;P), Harrisonburg (where JMU is) and Charlottesville (UVA). I don't wander often up to Harrisonburg, nor to Charlottesville, but used to go up by Staunton on a regular basis, and never noticed any issues around the actual towns with service on my cell. The interstate on the way up is covered for the most part, but there are a few spotty areas. So, I wouldn't see it really effecting the property values there, either, but I could be totally wrong."
tmobile,3ctpsy,PuppleKao,2,Sat Jul 11 17:06:28 2015 UTC,RE: /u/danrant's comments. It's all about economics for tmobile; or any carrier. They get the best profits from dense population centers and the state you list dont have the people needed for a build out. They aren't going to build out into areas where they will consistently lose money every month.  ATT/verizon have coverage here because they got 850mhz low band which is much farther reaching than tmobiles 1900mhz.
tmobile,3ctpsy,OtherAlan,4,Fri Jul 10 23:55:10 2015 UTC,"Sensorly doesn't cover roaming onto another carrier, and I think this is only the LTE map as well - so it doesn't show 2g coverage at all.  Some of those states (Iowa) are covered by iWireless where they still have Edge between towns, but hspa+ in towns, and tmobile roams with unlimited data (limited to your plan of course).  Other states (like Montana) I believe tmobile roams onto at&t, with limitless text and calling, but extremely limited data (10mb/50mb depending on plan).  If the entire state is missing, TMobile usually has a roaming agreement there."

T-Mobile is only talking about and measuring PoPs. But just because no one lives there, doesn't mean people don't drive through there - or vacation there.   This is partly because T-Mobile has always been an urban carrier - but if they really want to go toe to toe with ATT and VZW they need to start comparing on square miles of coverage too."

I'm excited to see where they will be in another 2 years, they might actually have a good rural network that could compete with AT&T & VZW. I don't leave the metro area often, and when I do, I usually fly to another metro area, so rural coverage isn't a huge thing for me, but if they can get good rural coverage, it could seriously be ""game on"" for the rest of the industry. I think they are reaching a size where they might have to decide if it's more cost effective to buy a couple of small regional carriers, or build out their network with what they have now."
tmobile,3csw2e,Cjaiceman,3,Fri Jul 10 18:06:48 2015 UTC,Oh I completely agree. But they're still a long ways a way from VZWs footprint. And can't match it without more low band spectrum.

If you're anywhere else - which is 99% of the places I am (within an hour of a major city, or near a major highway) - I can definitely say that tmobile has been no worse than Verizon. I got real tired of Verizon's ""best network"" leaving me with ""almost usable"" signal. Inside of Minneapolis tmobile is better, outside of Minneapolis it very much depends on where you are. TMobile was great in Orlando, Fl, great in Fort Lauderdale, Fl, mediocre in Sarasota, Fl, mediocre to bad in Fort Meyers Fl. Verizon didn't work in my hotel room in Fort Lauderdale, I don't remember the other details but it was not magic.  I had Verizon for 10 years until around 9 months ago, got real tired of my phone periodically not working on the supposedly ""best"" network. I don't care how much money they spent on advertising, I make a lot of money and would use whatever carrier worked best for me, and that's actually been tmobile. (Of course as I've said that can vary dramatically depending on where you live).   And yes - I came from VZW.

My constant T-mobile issues: SMS and MMS not working from time to time, the My-Tmobile site is flaky at the best of times (down again today), and the spotty coverage.. (example from yesterday at a relatives house; parts of the house have zero service while others have 4g coverage)  I drive about 40-50k miles year as a field engineer and figure that I get to see a lot more of T-mobile's faults and coverage gaps due to that travel as compared to others that only need coverage in their local area.

TMobile is supposed to have all their Edge coverage upgraded to LTE by the end of the year, so if you had Edge you should be good by next year.  I drove from Minnesota to Florida and back several times in the last 2 years and it worked fine for me. Always had call coverage. For maps I used Nokia HERE, which lets you download the map files to your device, so I'd have a map when I didn't have coverage.  I mean if it's the same price - understandable you would switch.

tmobile,3csw2e,thegadgeteur,5,Fri Jul 10 16:01:26 2015 UTC,"In Houston, and all the major carriers are good, but to me T-Mobile is the least reliable because it drops to 2g more than the other carriers (indoors).  I actually like Sprint's network over T-Mobile in my use because of that.  Keep in mind I haven't upgraded to a phone with Band 12 yet so there's a possibility those areas have been rectified.  The other thing about living in Texas is making the drive from Houston to Dallas or Austin, T-Mobile drops to 2g for significant portions of the drive where the other carriers don't.  They have expanded their LTE but I would like to see the entire drive between those cities covered."
tmobile,3csw2e,this_guy55,3,Fri Jul 10 17:41:47 2015 UTC,Eventually they will get to that point. They will be more of a competition when they build out rural areas. Band 12 has filled a few gaps but its very minuscule.
tmobile,3csw2e,Domini384,3,Fri Jul 10 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"In many metropolitan areas T-Mobile is competitive, but in rural areas T-Mobile's network has huge gaps, even in places where their maps show excellent coverage.  Rural coverage is so bad that when I drive cross country I buy an AT&T prepaid SIM for emergencies and pop it into one of our phones.  That SIM has allowed me to directly compare T-Mobile and AT&T coverage.    Most everywhere I've gone outside of metropolitan areas, AT&T has both voice and data coverage, while T-Mobile has almost no data coverage and spotty voice coverage.  The vast majority of rural T-Mobile locations have no data connectivity at all, despite showing Edge coverage.

tmobile,3csw2e,acrolos,3,Fri Jul 10 18:53:32 2015 UTC,The sim will fit but 1) the device must be owned for 40 days before its unlockable and 2) he T-Mobile variant and att lgg4 have completely different LTE radio band profiles. If will work but your experience will really be vary.

tmobile,3csw2e,acrolos,2,Fri Jul 10 20:53:32 2015 UTC,They aren't like that everywhere. From my experience in rural areas or where T-Mobile considers an area rural they just don't have great enough site density and space them out just a little bit too far apart from each other.

I guess that is still ""spotty"" on a national level but Sprint, for example, which has at least historically been better in raw area covered was (and I think still is) much more hit or miss in major cities particularly with usable data. Which is better depends on use case but considering where I live and travel, I'd consider Sprint ""spotier"".   Can Tmobile's network truly compete now with Verizon and AT&T nationally?

tmobile,3csw2e,mfact50,3,Fri Jul 10 17:44:15 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem in my market (OKC) is that there are a lot of EDGE only sites still, even in the city. I've seen them getting upgraded to fully modernized setups, mostly. That said, there is still a lot left in the OKC metro. This results in poor signal penetration anywhere near these sites that are still EDGE only. We don't have any 700mhz in OKC either, so T-Mobile really needs to take advantage of their good cell density in this region and get it all upgraded.   To their credit, they've done a great job turning up LTE in rural OK. It's the urban/suburban core that hasn't gotten much upgrade love until recently.

Along the front range (Fort Collins to Colorado Springs), and they have solid LTE coverage. You go east and it falls into roaming, and if you go west on I-70 into the mountains, it's hit or miss for LTE, but I don't know of anywhere that doesn't have service until you venture off the beaten path and go into the very small mountain towns. If you stay north of I-70, you are on Union Wireless, which has unlimited roaming with T-Mobile, but USA- Commnet and 'Cell One of NE CO', aka Viaero Wireless do hit your roaming cap."

tmobile,3cq9hc,anwserman,7,Fri Jul 10 05:52:21 2015 UTC,I switched to T-Mobile just a few months ago when I bought my iPhone 6. I was on sprint before and hated them but honestly o haven't been super impressed with T-Mobile in my area (Miami). Lots of congestion so I think my speeds might actually be worse than what I had with sprint. But oh well I stopped caring since it hasn't prevented me from doing anything I want with my phone.
tmobile,3cq9hc,MartOut,4,Fri Jul 10 02:36:28 2015 UTC,"Really? I'm in the Miami area and I've been very happy with the service. I have a Nexus 6 with Band 12 though, so I don't know if that's the main difference."
tmobile,3cq9hc,Runningflame570,8,Fri Jul 10 11:48:06 2015 UTC,"They have low-band spectrum in the Miami area.  It's not the fastest spectrum, but once you upgrade to a new phone it'll help relieve congestion across the mid-band frequencies you're using now - improving speeds for everyone"
tmobile,3cq9hc,PushKatel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:32:21 2015 UTC,"I like T-Mobile but I feel like they're growing a little too quickly. Finding a balance in budgeting for expansion and service quality is their biggest challenge, and I feel like it's been leaning slightly toward expansion.   They're doing a lot of great things for customers though, which is why I'm still on the fence of joining my sister's ATT plan on sticking with my parents Tmo plan. The two text outages in the past 3-4 months really made me struggle with work and the gf"
tmobile,3cq9hc,mitten_mike,10,Fri Jul 10 01:09:49 2015 UTC,"I could see the outages becoming grating, since there really have been quite a few, but I don't think T-Mobile really has any choice at this point except to grow as quickly as possible.  The story they're selling is them leading a revolutionary movement, if they take their foot off the gas for a moment they could lose momentum and with it a lot of the efficacy of that narrative.  The failure of the AT&T merger gave them a window of opportunity and the MetroPCS gave them a bigger one, but Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint all have more spectrum and the first two have more coming. If they slow down deployment they risk winding up in a situation where they can't match coverage, spectrum, or a density (which is where they have an advantage now)."

She and her boyfriend (who lives in the US) where planning to switch to T-Mobile since her boyfriend's contract with Verizon is going to end soon. He wasn't so sure if he wanted to switch to T-Mobile because their coverage in Utah (where his parents live) is not good (or at least that's what he told her).  What I don't understand (nor her) is how prepaid monthly plans work. In Mexico prepaid means pay as you go. I visited T-Mobile website and you can configure a prepaid plan pretty much the same way that I wanted to configure a postpaid plan ($50 per month with 2 additional lines for $40). I'm supposed to refill all 3 lines at the same time or something like that?  I plan to visit a T-Mobile shop on July the 15th anyway. That's when they are supposed to launch their ""free"" roaming program for calls to Mexico and Canada.  My sister is interested because she spends a lot of time in the US due to her boyfriend. I'm interested due to the unlimited data, but I do a lot of shopping in the US on the weekends and we have pretty much all our uncles and cousins living in the US."
tmobile,3ctls1,_Dreams_In_Digital_,3,Fri Jul 10 20:17:16 2015 UTC,You can have multiple lines on one prepaid account. Just make sure you have enough money in the account before the end of the month so you don't risk losing service. :)

Any trade in under 210? Becomes $0 for the G4 you should be able to verify the trade in amount over the phone and that one should be the full trade in value. Just verify with customer care and have them notate the account as a precaution.
tmobile,3csmpi,speedfreakphotos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"Upvote for correct.   Anything less than 216 dollars in trade rounds to 0, anything more becomes down payment to lower your monthly eip charge."

T-Mobile already made that a pretty seamless experience, but now as John Legere mentions, that should now feel like just going to another state, more or less.  I'm going on a vacation to Southeast Asia in a couple weeks, though - I was really hoping that he was going to announce doubling international roaming data speeds. I appreciate the free data, but it is SLOOOOOOW!"
tmobile,3co2co,hungarianhc,6,Thu Jul 9 12:22:49 2015 UTC,Yeah when I was in the Philippines the EDGE data was so slow and KILLED my battery life.
tmobile,3co2co,hipstermike,7,Thu Jul 9 14:08:28 2015 UTC,I noticed the battery life thing in Europe recently too. I think the throttled data keeps the phone's CPU working longer so your battery really suffers.
tmobile,3co2co,unagirap,6,Thu Jul 9 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yea it's on 3G and since the data is slow, your phone stays on for quite a while to download data."
tmobile,3co2co,dcdttu,3,Thu Jul 9 15:16:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should tell the radio to keep it 2G only. This way the radio won't actively look for 3/4G. I have the same issue with G1. 3G just came out during that time, so it not everywhere yet. So actively looking for 3G in edge market will consume battery. Disabling 3G will keep the battery longer."
tmobile,3co2co,hearingnone,2,Thu Jul 9 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that would have helped since I actually was on 3G or LTE most of the time when I was in Europe. The throttling takes place via T-Mobile's APN which all data passes through when you are roaming abroad, so even if your phone shows LTE your data will be horribly slow."

tmobile,3co2co,hearingnone,2,Thu Jul 9 20:49:30 2015 UTC,That apn doesn't even exist. It's fast.t-mobile.com  What s/he meant was that the data passes through T-Mobile as a proxy while abroad and they artificially throttle it even when the network the phone is on is actually capable of faster speeds. This is what they do on Simply Prepaid to cap the speeds at 8mbps just like Cricket.

tmobile,3co2co,B1GEast,2,Fri Jul 10 01:01:02 2015 UTC,When in Canada T-Mobile users have already been able to roam on LTE networks for a while now. The speeds however are capped at 128kbps even though you're connected to LTE.  Do we actually have a confirmation that after 7/15 T-Mobile roamers in CA/MX will be getting full speed on LTE? So far I haven't been able to find much about it.
tmobile,3co2co,milan03,5,Thu Jul 9 12:48:32 2015 UTC,Mike Sievert said in the Periscope something to the effect that you get the full speed of the partner network. I didnt see anything in the terms that suggest a 2G throttle like before.
tmobile,3co2co,B1GEast,2,Thu Jul 9 21:23:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. No throttle. Full speed available from that carrier in the area you're in. He said most major cities are on LTE.

tmobile,3co2co,milan03,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:19:15 2015 UTC,"Good question. Might have tweet them for confirmation. If it wasn't full speed, then this new plan only eliminated the $0.20/min calling."

tmobile,3co2co,nick125,12,Thu Jul 9 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"Well..he said it. at 3:48 in (for those of you that maybe can't watch). ""When you're in Canada or Mexico, you'll get LTE high-speed data automatically..."":  ...I wonder how he worked this magic. at&t bought Iusacell and also Nextel Mexico, which albeit is in a very far third place (about 8 million subscribers total..half as many as the second place carrier, Movistar, and way behind the #1 Telcel with 61 million subscribers). So most likely a deal with Movistar or Telcel.  And Canada..I have no idea. I think Wind is the only network that has some kind of parity agreement with T-Mobile (free roaming on their network for us, free roaming back in the US etc.). Anyone who has been to Canada though outside of major metropolitan areas, knows their coverage is pretty terrible (they're a small, new company), and the rest of Canada is dominated by Robellus (Rogers, Bell, Telus...think of them as Verizon, at&t and...uh...another  Verizon lol), so unless he also made a deal with the devil with one of them as well, this doesn't change too much."
tmobile,3co2co,Inspirasion,6,Thu Jul 9 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like they would have had to partner with one of the Big 3 in Canada, since Wind doesn't even have LTE.  Their network is also AWS so it should offer the most compatibility with roaming voice/3G."
tmobile,3co2co,FUS_ROALD_DAHL,3,Thu Jul 9 12:44:38 2015 UTC,"When I was in the Yucatan, I was ""roaming"" on T-Mobile with Movistar.

I would assume they partnered with Movistar, Telcel, or possibly even both."
tmobile,3co2co,dickdarlington,2,Thu Jul 9 14:26:28 2015 UTC,"Spot on, partnering. Though he wouldn't explicitly mention which of the ""one or two"" carriers T-Mobile partnered with, other than that it was the largest in the country.

Having a US post office box lets me order from amazon.com (where prices are sometimes [but not always] better), and from other online retailers.  Most US retailers will ship to Canada, but the costs are significantly larger.  For example, one piece of amateur radio equipment I recently purchased cost $15 to ship to the US and $90 to ship to Canada.  You can guess which I chose.  As a bonus, having a US address has let me get a real US credit card, and having a real US credit card has allowed me to have a postpaid T-Mobile data subscription.  (Nice way to bring it back on topic, huh?)  I'm in the US enough that having US data is a useful thing.  (My Canadian plan includes US voice and text but not data.)"

tmobile,3co2co,NewMexic0,4,Thu Jul 9 19:08:45 2015 UTC,"As an aside...  It is interesting to me that it has taken so long for any carrier to do this (at least Canada) again.  Years and years ago, I had a Cingular plan (remember them?) with a $20 add-on that provided unlimited calling to, and coverage in, Canada.  Not to be confused with an add-on that gave you discounted calling, they were the only ones that offered something like this.  AT&T announced they were merging with Cingular about when it was time to renew my contract, and I made sure to do it before the merger because, despite all assurances from the folks at the Cingular store that ATT would keep a similar plan around, I didn't believe them.  Sure enough, the merger completed, we were on AT&T... and that old plan?  Not available anymore, I was grandfathered in.  I kept those phone numbers for a very long time, before finally giving them up....data (broadband, mobile) eventually made it expendable."
tmobile,3co2co,dalanchong,5,Thu Jul 9 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"I think the bottom line is just money. Why make it free when you can charge someone and make an obscene profit? I think Legere's figure was that either AT&T or the entire industry rakes in $6 billion in international roaming call charges, at 90% profit. Same thing with overages: Why get rid of something that makes you money?  AT&T and Verizon are also the complete opposite of T-Mobile. AT&T controls the network on most cruise ships and as we know, bought two Mexican carriers. You would think with all that control, they'd toss their customers a bone with reduced or free roaming, calling, etc. Nope, you just get gouged like everyone else.  I really really hope the CEO of AT&T is shitting his pants right now."

tmobile,3co2co,toxicbrew,6,Thu Jul 9 14:26:12 2015 UTC,"The fine print I am interested in is how ""Current Simple Choice customers can simply opt-in online, by phone, or in-store by switching to our latest plans for free.""  Based on that and the current '2 unltd line for $100' & '4 lines 10GB total for $100' rates ending on July 14th, in order to get the 'free' 3 country plan, you cannot have the two listed plans AND the new 3 country benefit. In addition, I'm assuming $70 unlimited users, people with existing Advantage discounts, and those on the 'simple select' or whatever they call grandfathered plans will not be allowed to join it either."

I've never thought that T-Mobile would take away unlimited data, but rather, just make it so that new features aren't offered on plans with unlimited data.

tmobile,3co2co,jamar030303,4,Thu Jul 9 14:24:14 2015 UTC,Mike on the Periscope feed touched on this really quick. He said that you will at least need half of your plan usage based in the US in a three month period for you to continue to qualify for mobile without borders.
tmobile,3co2co,techjunkie452,3,Thu Jul 9 14:32:32 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot.  Totally makes sense.  I was just trying to hold on to a slim sliver of hope that I wouldn't have to switch to a Canadian carrier.  The telecom situation up north is terrible.
tmobile,3co2co,FUS_ROALD_DAHL,2,Thu Jul 9 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"If you're living somewhere with good WIND coverage, use them and add their unlimited US roaming bundle ($15/month) (or choose one of their plans that includes it).  If not, choose Rogers which will charge you $5/day (max. $50/month) for US roaming.  All US use comes out of your Canadian bundles, so if you have unlimited data or unlimited voice minutes at certain times of the day, US use would be unlimited too.  All prices in $CDN."
tmobile,3co2co,PhotoJim99,2,Thu Jul 9 15:02:43 2015 UTC,Does anybody know why T-Mobile doesn't make international long distance from the U.S. as cheap as VOIP services do? Not as simple as this roaming upgrade though.
tmobile,3co2co,chrispmorgan,2,Thu Jul 9 17:42:44 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take a shot in the dark and guess that maybe VOIP services like Skype and Google Voice have contracts/agreements with some carriers?  It was pointed out to me that when you make an international call, the receiving party and receiving carrier/service provider bears the cost of the call. So it's tricky to make agreements for each and every country, which is why they didn't even try with Europe.  Subsidizing free calls to Mexico and Canada stateside and to the U.S. from Mexico and Canada would cost T-Mobile a fortune. But it's easily affordable when you make an agreement with the carriers :)"

tmobile,3co2co,Crzypdilly,2,Thu Jul 9 19:49:08 2015 UTC,I'm always curious to how T-Mobile can offer services like these and continue to make money. Does international roaming cost a lot for carriers to be able to provide? Domestic data roaming sure does cost a lot
tmobile,3co2co,elmo1182,4,Thu Jul 9 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile made a reciprocal agreement with one or two of the largest carriers in both countries that allow each carrier cheap access to the other's network.  So I suppose this means Telcel and Rogers customers will someday have unlimited talk, text, and limited data when coming here (and roaming on T-Mobile). They didn't specify what the reciprocal agreement meant to the other carriers or what they gained from such an agreement, but that's how T-Mobile can do it without it costing them a fortune."
tmobile,3co2co,AlbinoAlex,2,Thu Jul 9 15:16:12 2015 UTC,"Tmobile could easily offer something like this in many countries, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Austria all have Tmobile, they could offer this in those countries also.   Hell, when I was in Poland a month ago or so I bought a 1GB starter sim for Tmobile for 5zloty or something like $1.33.   The companies in these countries providing the roaming don't make a boatload of money, it's that your carrier that you're on is making a killing on markup.   In this case though, it seems like it's a mutually beneficial agreement with the carriers in those countries."

tmobile,3co2co,matthewmspace,2,Thu Jul 9 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"As stoked as I am about expanded international coverage, can we please see domestic data roaming changed/lifted as well? I know AT&T are massive assholes, but seriously - trade off access to some of your city spectrum to AT&T, and I wager they'll cut a better deal to TMo in rural areas for data access, even if it's not unlimited.  50MB a month doesn't even last me a day when visiting the folks in WV, or crossing PA. Absolutely terrible."

Traveling in certain places in the Midwest, you're roaming off of T-Mobile's network, and they only allow 50MB of high-speed data before being cut off. They claim it's due to agreements with roaming partners (which I don't doubt), but I find it frustrating they're able to hammer out these details internationally, but can't do it in the US, where their customers live."
tmobile,3co2co,bassmadrigal,2,Thu Jul 9 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"Domestic roaming hasn't changed.  One reason domestic roaming is hard to negotiate is because far more people stay in the country than go out of it.

tmobile,3co2co,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:24:22 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about what T-Mobile calls Domestic Roaming, which most certainly is not unlimited. Highest amount you can get is 200MB, if you're on an 11GB - 21GB plan, which does not cover the unlimited plan.  https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-3299"
tmobile,3co2co,bassmadrigal,2,Thu Jul 9 20:05:08 2015 UTC,Roaming on AT&T is still capped at 50 mb/month.  Roaming on other carriers usually doesn't have a cap.
tmobile,3co2co,icepick_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:33:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the follow-up.
tmobile,3co2co,bassmadrigal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:23:58 2015 UTC,I am aware of what you're talking about but that does not change my point. T-Mobile has partnered with multiple carriers around the US and some of these are good partnerships. There are certain states where T-Mobile has partnered with a local carrier and you can roam unlimited on them.   AT&T is the main one where it actually deducts from your roaming amount. That is because they charge T-Mobile too much money for such little data (I believe it was like... $12 for 50mb?) and T-Mobile would rather lose you as a customer than to lose money in places of AT&T service.
tmobile,3co2co,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:31:46 2015 UTC,Can you not see that T-Mobile refers to domestic roaming as roaming that is limited to 50MB? It's right on the site I linked to.  It isn't talking about roaming with carriers where the agreements have led to no restrictions.  I was specifically asking about the limited domestic roaming.
tmobile,3co2co,bassmadrigal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"Right, but you made a blanket statement referring to ""carriers"" in the Midwest. The only one with limited roaming is AT&T. There are other carriers covering roaming in the Midwest with no limit.   AT&T will be shit, that won't change."
tmobile,3co2co,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:11:53 2015 UTC,I specifically stated:   does anyone know if they've changed their 50MB domestic roaming limit yet?   Any further discussion was based on that limitation...

tmobile,3csmpz,laxfan91,2,Fri Jul 10 18:33:36 2015 UTC,FYI: B29 cannot be easily aggregated with B12 because there is no duplex gap between B12 uplink and B29 downlink. Currently 3GPP does not have B12+B29 CA specifications. B29 maybe aggregated with 850 MHz or 600 MHz bands but there other technical issues. It is also possible full duplex technology may allow B12+B29 aggregation in the future.

[emphasis mine]   So, my guess is that since the new rate plan (which looks to be the same price as current rate plans) will be available 2015-07-15, the day after the 2 and 4 for 100 promos expire, then those plans are ineligible for the new Mobile without Borders."

Surely we can justify $10 right?"

tmobile,3co3te,bassmadrigal,4,Fri Jul 10 12:05:33 2015 UTC,Any word if they've managed to change their domestic roaming 50MB limit?  I was amazed they were able to work out unlimited data (albeit at a restricted speed) with over 100 international companies yet can't offer more than 50MB of domestic roaming to their unlimited customers within the US. Now they've added high speed data to Canada and Mexico and I'm guessing domestic roaming hasn't changed a bit...

tmobile,3cpikp,sherifhanna,12,Thu Jul 9 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"Great article but like many CA articles it gives impression that two aggregated carriers provide twice the capacity:  You can't even stream a medium quality 5 Mbps YouTube video at that speed. But what if instead of being connected to a single LTE carrier network, you were connected to one that aggregated two LTE carriers (with a compatible phone of course!), then you would get 6 Mbps instead of 3 Mbps.  Actually that shouldn't happen. Basestation should bounce users between the carriers to balance the load even without carrier aggregation. The main difference is that CA allows instanteous load balancing. That increases median user speed but CA does not double it."
tmobile,3cpikp,danrant,3,Thu Jul 9 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on how the operator is configuring their scheduler. Load balancing is much more flexible with carrier aggregation, but the operator could certainly setup their scheduler to dedicate resource blocks on both carriers simultaneously. Real-world tests bear this conclusion. Specifically, see the LG U+ test report I linked to at the end of the post."

tmobile,3csbt1,ShowerBeer-,4,Fri Jul 10 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"Still a shitty analogy. Look at it this way:  It's an all you can eat buffet where everyone goes straight up to fill their plate.  Until you've eaten 21 plates of food. Once you've eaten 21 plates of food, you have to wait until there's no one at the buffet before you're allowed to go back up.   But only at times when they can serve less food per hour than there are people at the buffet."
tmobile,3csbt1,stevehobbes,2,Fri Jul 10 13:47:52 2015 UTC,"And when you get back up, you don't get any more plates. You can only bring back what fits on your spoon. You forgot that part."
tmobile,3csbt1,ShowerBeer-,3,Fri Jul 10 14:02:14 2015 UTC,Nope. It's a plate - you just get one very infrequently. It averages across time into spoon like bites :)
tmobile,3csbt1,stevehobbes,-2,Fri Jul 10 14:04:38 2015 UTC,"Tldr: 13.5 hours between plates (generous estimate), if you want to run with this. Still stupid.  Ok, I actually like the direction this has taken now. What's the consensus de prioritized speed? Like 128 Kbps? Meanwhile let's call it 20 Mbps normal speed (it's probably faster). That's 1/160th the speed.  So if normal buffet refill frequency is a plate every 5 min, if you're de prioritized, you'd have to wait over 13 hours between plates. Utterly ridiculous. And that's being generous.  What we're trying to say is - for a giant corporation that is always advertising ""truly unlimited"" and ""uncarrier"", the 1) deprioritization itself and 2) the de prioritized speeds are just crazy.

I personally wouldn't have minded it at all if it advertised that all of this was for $10. All of these Uncarrier events have been ""for the people,"" and this one is no different. If you look at the newsroom article posted here: http://newsroom.t-mobile.com/media-kits/mobile-without-borders.htm  The title of the article is named: T-Mobile Introduces ‘Mobile without Borders’: Extends Coverage & Calling Across North America at No Extra Charge  and subheader:  Next in its series of Un-carrier Amped announcements, T-Mobile unveils a massive expansion of Simple Choice — adds calling, texting and 4G LTE data throughout Mexico & Canada  Now, the first feeling I got from this is - wow, T-Mobile is doing it for the people again, and free! Finally I can start calling my contacts again without worrying about forgetting to use Google Voice for my Canadian contacts and risk paying 49c/min (which is outrageous considering GV doesn't charge for this).  Note how T-Mobile reused the name Simple Choice (expansion of Simple Choice) in its address to the public. I can't wait to tell my friends all about it (which I did, and coincidentally all of them are on the 4/$100 10GB plan). Look at what T-Mobile is doing again, for free! Did you see!?  Now it's not until I read the fact sheet that our Simple Choice plans are not eligible because they are considered ""promotional"" in nature. Based on the fact, I had to tell all of my friends ""Wait, a minute! It's actually not free because we are considered promotional and you need to pay for some add-on for that.""  That goes against exactly what the title of the article just said regarding ""no extra charge"" and just made me felt special (in a bad way) that now I own their inferior plan that needs an upgrade to become ""current."" Although I plan to keep my ""promotional"" plan, it begs the question whether or not I am ""grandfathered"" and whether T-Mobile will become just another ""dumb and dumber"" and use different forms of pressure to get you to switch out of it (i.e. as Simple Choice 'expands', we won't care about you anymore, unless you switch). This sounds like a stark contrast as to what Uncarrier 9.0 ""Un-contract"" is doing:  With the Un-contract, T-Mobile is putting an end to price uncertainty − and flipping the very idea of the carrier contract on its head. Now, we sign the contract, you get the freedom.  “We’re the Un-carrier. Everything the carriers do, we un-do,” said John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile. “The other guys have been throwing out all kinds of desperate, short-term promotions to suck you in and lock you down − only to jack up rates later. We’re not playing that game. The Un-contract is our promise to individuals, families and businesses of all sizes,  that − while your price may go down − it won’t go up.”  Now, if you think about it, the $4/100 10 GB plan's original end date hasn't ended yet (til 2016). Although T-Mobile is letting you stay in this plan after this date now, it's only July and T-Mobile is already ""throwing out all kinds of desperate, short-term promotions to suck you in and lock you down − only to jack up rates later."" The circumstances are slightly different here, although you can also apply it the same way.  A: Do you like having 2.5 GB per line for your account? B: Yes, of course! A: Do you want extend your coverage to Canada and Mexico for free? B: Of course, this is awesome! A: Oh wait a minute, your plan actually doesn't qualify because you are on an old plan that is no longer offered. B: WHAT!? I just got this 6 months ago! A: Well, that's just policy... Tell you what, you can always just pay $10 more for it if you want this feature...  If you don't call this ""short-term promotions"" and to ""jack up rates later"" I don't know what you want to call it.  Just my 2 cents, no news here for me..."
tmobile,3coj53,swg0101,3,Fri Jul 10 01:20:23 2015 UTC,Well said!
tmobile,3coj53,nymax12,2,Fri Jul 10 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"I agree! And, here is your upvote for the comment...  It did just occur to me though that this isn't all that different from the data stash event. correct me if I'm wrong, but I think in both cases it only applies to accounts that have [data / plans] that isn't [free / promotional].   To me it is mostly about the way it was pitched... I had the exact same reaction to the announcement. I was shocked to read the fine print."
tmobile,3coj53,jnux,2,Fri Jul 10 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I watched the announcement and when he said all Simple choice plans are getting it, I thought ""that's me! My trip to Mexico is going to be even better now!."" I told my girlfriend about this and how T-Mobile keeps making things better for us and how they treat existing customers just as good as new ones.   Then I see this thread, and it feels like it goes in the face of everything uncarrier stands for. I don't care about the fee. Especially if I can add it and then remove it without affecting the rest of my account. But for them to say ALL simple choice plans and then to have an asterisk that basically says ""well, not all lol."" just feels dirty. I really liked how upfront T-Mobile has been. And this just seems like it could be the beginning of the end of that.   I'm disgruntled a bit, but it's not like I'm going to jump ship. I might tweet Legere about how I think they shouldn't claim its all simple choice plans when it clearly isn't. But that's all. I just hope this doesn't become a trend."

tmobile,3coj53,TweetsInCommentsBot,4,Fri Jul 10 03:01:46 2015 UTC,I don't mind this at all. I have the 4 for $100 plus another line with two lines with calls to Mexico which currently it comes to an extra $30 since I have calls to cell phones too. That's if you don't include the taxes. So if I add this I will save $20 a month plus I don't have to buy a new sim card for every phone I take to Mexico and I get 4g data. This will save me about $400 a year since Mexican Cell Phone Companies charge an outrageous amount just calling to other phones and calling back to the US is difficult without a WiFi spot. Another great thing about this is that everybody can now call to Mexico and everybody can call each other in Mexico which could save us even way more than that.     edit- This potentially saves me $65 a month plus the hundreds I spend in sim cards and calling cards in Mexico.

So my current plan isn't a promotional plan - question is whether it's a legacy plan.  It's definitely a Simple Choice plan.    I guess I'l wait till 7/15 and see what happens."

But I can't shake the feeling that its a CARRIER thing to do in that they would not include 2 of the best plans out right now and probably what motivated people to switch(myself included). BUT I understand T-mobile is a business and is in business to make money. I also think future AMPED or UNCARRIER moves will probably exclude promo plans such as these.
tmobile,3coj53,swg0101,2,Fri Jul 10 01:32:48 2015 UTC,"I hope you are wrong... But I tend to agree with you, so far the Amped events either is nothing exciting or is not applicable. Let's just hope this doesn't continue on..."

tmobile,3coj53,Prison_Suitcase,0,Fri Jul 10 13:08:20 2015 UTC,I believe the reason the 2/100 and 4/100 plans are not included is because they are promo plans and are expiring on the 14th. The new plan starts on the 15th.

tmobile,3coj53,anwserman,7,Thu Jul 9 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"What's the alternative?  Switching to AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint and paying more for less features - and then, still have to pay $30 a month additional for international calling?  I understand that it's nice to get something for free, but this is pretty much complaining that you got a free slice of cake that wasn't big enough to your liking :("
tmobile,3coj53,Garbageman99,2,Thu Jul 9 23:01:49 2015 UTC,"Love the analogy. I have the same as the parent commenter, but I practically live on the border and both sides. $10 extra a month is nothing compared to other companies' rates and/or services, not to mention dealing with Mexican companies (although Movistar is not bad when it comes to pricing and all).   If I hadn't yet, for any stupid reason, switched to T-Mobile, this would have me going to a T-mo store and switching today."
tmobile,3coj53,anwserman,2,Thu Jul 9 23:47:53 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I don't travel that much to Mexico or Canada... so this really isn't a huge draw for me... at this moment.  However, it's awesome knowing that if I decide to take a trip - all I have to do is plunk $10 over and get to use my number, my phone, my services.  No need to hassle to some store to make sure my phone is compatible, or buying refill cards at a shady convenience store because I underestimated my usage needs.  It's a steal, because even if you buy a local SIM, it's going to cost a heck of a lot more than $10.  I'd even wager $10 stating that the majority of the people complaining about this not being included have no reason to call Canada or Mexico, let alone know someone with such a number.  If they did, they'd understand how much it currently costs and that $10/mo is a nothing compared to current, competing services."
tmobile,3coj53,Garbageman99,2,Fri Jul 10 00:16:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah; basically, everyone complaining knows not how real the struggle is... I can't blame them though, T-Mobile has gotten us used to the ubiquity of the Un-Carrier movement throughout every plan with (little to no) restrictions.   Regardless, the moment I'll start demanding cheaper and even better is when other carriers beat this and the other offers (unlikely)."

tmobile,3coj53,anwserman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:28:51 2015 UTC,I am confused. On my plan now we are technically 4 for 100 but two of the lines are upgraded to Unlimited (for +30 each?) So how would we get the benefits of this package?? Migrate down to the 1 GB plan for the two not unlimited lines? Or only 1 GB of data can be used abroad?? How much would we pay for all unlimited lines on North America Plan?
tmobile,3coj53,CMChor17,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:40:50 2015 UTC,You would add the $10 addon.  All lines unlimited would be $180 until the 14th when the promo ends
tmobile,3coj53,anwserman,0,Thu Jul 9 23:10:19 2015 UTC,"Instead of the 4/$100/2.5GB plan, you'd switch your service to the 2/$100/unlimited plan and pay $40/each additional line.  The offer is valid through July 14, 2015 and are guaranteed to keep that price for 2 years.  Once July 15 hits, you could then add the $10 North America calling option, bringing up your monthly service to $190 for unlimited data throughout Canada, United States, and Mexico :)"
tmobile,3coj53,CMChor17,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:21:50 2015 UTC,So to take advantage of the North America plan we should just upgrade all lines to unlimited for 180 because otherwise we will be paying more for way less when promo ends?  EDIT: would my two unlimited lines that I have today also need the $10 ad-on?
tmobile,3coj53,anwserman,0,Fri Jul 10 00:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not a T-Mobile employee, so I cannot answer specifics.  However, if I understand correctly, you're currently doing:  4/$100 with 2 unlimited data upgrades at $30 each, the rest at 2.5GB = $160, or switch to  2/$100 with 2 additional lines at $40 each, all with unlimited data = $180  With all of the commotion going on, it appears that neither the 4/$100 promo or the 2/$100 promo qualifies for this North America benefit, you'd have to add it yourself.  However, it'd be smart to switch your 4/$100 plan over anyway.  For $20 more a month, you get unlimited data for each line, a Rhapsody unRadio account for each line, plus each line gets allotted 7GB of tethered data.  So if you're going on vacation where T-Mobile has service, you can use the tethered data on those additional lines.  Two already have unlimited data, so you're doubling the amount you can tether... from 14GB to 28GB.  That's what I would do - because once the 2/$100 promotion ends, it's going to cost $30 each to upgrade the data on those remaining two lines.... or bite the bullet now, and just pay $20 and get both upgraded :)"
tmobile,3coj53,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:16:39 2015 UTC,I know I am just 20 off from unlimited for everyone...except for those other lines one never uses more than 300 MB and the other (me) is good with 2.5 GB since work and home have wifi. For 20 bucks more it's literally for nothing. However!!! It's ONLY 20 bucks!! Taxes are a bitch too as you get expensive plans.  But soon if I need more data might as well get all unlimited...
tmobile,3coj53,abrahamisaninja,0,Fri Jul 10 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"That's the crappy thing - however, think of it this way.  Upgrade your data now, you get the other line upgraded for ""free"".  Do it later, and it's not only going to cost more but the other line doesn't get the upgrade.   Just because they're not using the data now doesn't mean they won't use it in the future.  For myself personally, I have the 3 unlimited line promotion... I have three phones!  One is work, one is personal, and the other I keep on me when I go for long-distance runs in case I need to call for help or get mapped directions, etc.  To be honest, in more than one occasion have I burnt through my tethering data on all three lines due to demand from work, even though I have home wi-fi! :)"

I think extending it to prepaid is super Un-Carrier. :)"

Verizon charges you $10/GB for anything over your limit when in the U.S.  International calling is $1-$3 per min  International data is $2/MB  International text is 5 cents to 50 cents per text, PER TEXT!

tmobile,3cozpg,Stanzilla28,6,Thu Jul 9 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"Here's a copy of the article text, minus the auto-playing, auto-unmuting video and pop-up giveaway ads:   T-Mobile's outspoken CEO John Legere addressed Project Fi, Google's first experiment with entering the wireless carrier market, during a public question-and-answer session livestreamed on Periscope on Thursday. Although it might appear at first glance as if Project Fi would turn T-Mobile and Google into competitors, Google is heavily relying on T-Mobile's network, and Legere sounded genuinely enthusiastic about being Google's partner.   When asked a question about how many subscribers T-Mobile has added thanks to the Project Fi program, Legere mentioned that he didn't have numbers yet, but went on to add:  Google is going slowly, learning from the trial. We're really proud to be a part of it, fascinating to be partnering with them on something that's highly profitable for us. We're not usually in things for the good of our heart.   This is perhaps the best spin that T-Mobile can put on Project Fi, which calls into question the current carrier paradigm in the United States. Although Google insists that its wireless service is an experiment, it does things very differently from plans one can purchase from carriers like T-Mobile.  Project Fi is carrier agnostic, using the best Internet connection available, whether that's signal from T-Mobile, Sprint, or a Wi-Fi network, and does not come with data allotments. Instead, Google charges $10 for 1GB of data and refunds customers down to the cent for data they don't use. It's not hard to see the way Project Fi -- if it becomes a model for future wireless plans -- might eventually cannibalize the demand for T-Mobile plans.  But Google doesn't own its own wireless network, so it's purchasing wireless from T-Mobile and Sprint to resell, and according to Legere, selling its service to Google is profitable. The question about Project Fi also gave Legere an opportunity to slam rival Sprint, which he rarely passes up. (Last week, he got in a public Twitter spat with Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure.)  ""I've heard a number of people say, who are on the trial, they've never seen their phone go to Sprint. And I had predicted that, because it goes on strength of signal, 80 to 90 percent of the time you leave Wi-Fi it'll probably go to T-Mobile, and that's what I've been seeing as well,"" Legere said.   Currently, signups for Project Fi are invite-only, and the service requires customers to purchase a $500 phone, the Nexus 6, either at full price or through an installment plan. So it's safe to say that there aren't a lot of Project Fi subscribers yet.   T-Mobile held its Periscope conference to announce free 4G LTE roaming to Mexico and Canada for some of its wireless plans. Legere mentioned that T-Mobile previously allowed customers to roam in those countries, but they were often throttled to lower data speeds, meaning that 50 percent of smartphone owners turned their devices off when they crossed the border into those countries. T-Mobile will partner with the ""No.1 and No.2 carriers in both Mexico and Canada"" to enable its new roaming feature, which becomes available on July 15.   https://youtu.be/L0aV_lqkYuM   During the freewheeling one-hour press conference livestreamed on Periscope, Legere touched on several aspects of T-Mobile's business. He briefly shared second quarter preliminary results, saying that T-Mobile added 2.1 million net customers during the quarter, although over half were on less-profitable pre-paid plans. He also mentioned his public spat with Claure, and revealed that he watched the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight over an illegal Periscope lstream."
tmobile,3cozpg,brodie7838,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"With the standardization on LTE as a protocol and the push for VoLTE as the voice layer I see MNVO's like Project Fi becoming bigger and carriers doing more reselling.  With VoLTE+WiFi calling the MNVO just places their APN and telcom equipment in strategic locations and the wireless carrier is just responsible for ""the last mile"" link.  The N6 is the device today, but only because it support the necessary bands and it's only a matter of time before that kind of support becomes more common.  In fact with Google's Project Fi I expect that some manufacturers will expand into thise new market.  I would also say that with Sprint offering LTE on 800 Mhz it will be more important in those areas where T-Mobile has not deployed band 12."
tmobile,3co1pg,CullenDM,17,Thu Jul 9 12:03:30 2015 UTC,Without a doubt T-Mobile took third place now and it'll help with the spectrum auction coming up. More customers = more cash = more breathing room to bid.

tmobile,3co1pg,Silencer87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:37:53 2015 UTC,"One metric we don't see, but exists and the carriers probably have it internally, is a cost to acquire each user. Ads are rolled into this cost, but so is the cost of stores, someone to activate your phone (if you went into a store) and the commission they get paid, the cost to pay off your ETF or payment plan from another carrier, credit check costs, that sort of thing.  If you got referred by someone, that's a cost too, since they and you get a credit for signing up.  Sometimes it takes a few months to a year before a customer becomes profitable."

First: Customers need to agree to new terms and conditions covering this. Second, it's an opportunity to exclude the 2/100 and 4/100 promo people as they won't be able to upgrade to it.  Just call 611 on July 15th (or wait a few days and avoid the long wait times). It's a seamless process to get moved over, but it's not done automatically for reasons outlined above."

I mean, $10/mo over 2 years is $240, and high-end phones have $250 deductibles. Compare that to a $99 one time fee for 2-year coverage and $75 deductibles.

JUMP also provides Lookout Mobile Security Premium for free, which includes antivirus protection, find my phone, remote data wipe, and 100 gb of cloud storage.   Squaretrade covers damage, but it doesn't cover lost or stolen phones. If your phone is lost or stolen with them then you're SOL.  Bottom line, JUMP gives you a higher level of coverage, more features, and more flexibility with early upgrades but it comes at a higher cost. One has to decide if they value these extras enough to pay the higher cost."

tmobile,3cq2v3,atyndie,7,Thu Jul 9 21:31:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think handset insurance through mobile carriers is never a good idea. Coverage with AppleCare+ (for iPhones) or SquareTrade (for almost everything else) costs more upfront, but has drastically lower repair deductibles and will be cheaper over the 2-year life of the coverage. The main difference between carrier insurance and the others is that carriers will replace lost/stolen phones; others will not.  If you're the kind of person who keeps their phones for 2+ years, then you'll need carrier insurance after that, obviously."

If you are on the original Jump plan you can swap your phone out 2 times per 12 month period. That is a pretty cool feature of the jump program. If you like to stay up with the newest devices I would keep it. If you are not a frequent upgrader you can always just get regular PHP for 8 bucks.

After reading lots of posts here I am not sure, in general, if it is a good deal. As many have posted, you can pay off the phone, then sell it, and then buy the new phone, and you may come out ahead since you haven't been paying $10/month. And there is cheaper insurance available.   Of course, then you have the hassle of selling the phone yourself, which many people don't have the time or motivation to do.   But then my phone got stolen, so it ended up being a really good deal."

The trade in value is what you get right away and you get a prepaid card with the rest of the payments. The trade in credit isn't extra. By the way, the Nexus 6 does work perfectly on T-Mobile so unless you're unable to make the payment I would honestly take it over.  For the LG G2, she would get $55 to put down for a new phone and an ETF credit for the $130. She would need to trade in the LG G2 and buy a new phone from T-Mobile for the promotion. Don't know... but honestly I heard their shipments are kind of wonky sometimes even when you order overnight. You can do all of this in store by the way. For me I never had downtime. What happens is you get a temporary number until the porting process complete which isn't very long. I never had any issues with service during this time. We are not sure yet. If you're on a promotional plan such as 2 for $100 people are assuming you may need to add it for $10."

tmobile,3cpmyr,Deceptiveideas,2,Thu Jul 9 20:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it is $10 per a line, I think it might just be $10 to add it as a feature to the entire account.  And yes, you can get JUMP on a family plan."
tmobile,3cpmyr,easyxtarget,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"I just did a comparison between a Family Plan and the Simple Choice Plan I outlined above, and it looks like the cost difference isn't that significant. However, if I bring over my Nexus 6 then I can't add Jump or get device insurance since it'll be paid off. We don't use that much data, so having unlimited data isn't exactly that big of a draw:    Feature Simple Choice Family Plan    Plan $80 $100   Line 1 Finance $49.16 $0   Line 2 Finance $42.99 $32.99   Monthly Total $172.15 $132.99   Yearly Subtotal $2065.80 $1595.88   Nexus 6 Payoff $0 $409.79   International $0 $120   Total Year 1 $2065.80 $2125.67      I want Jump specifically to have the option to upgrade every year, so when I upgrade my Nexus 6 next year (and assuming a similar cost for my wife's upgrade), the Family Plan ends up being even more expensive (especially if the Canada/Mexico feature ends up being $10 per line, then it's an extra $120):    Feature Simple Choice Family Plan    Plan $80 $100   Line 1 Finance $49.16 $39.16   Line 2 Finance $42.99 $32.99   Monthly Total $172.15 $172.15   Yearly Subtotal $2065.80 $2065.80   International $0 $120   Total Year 2 $2065.80 $2185.80   2 Year Total $4131.60 $4311.47      I know that these prices don't include taxes and fees, but I imagine the difference will be relatively negligible    By going with Simple Choice I can skip a large up front payment, I'll get insurance and Jump on both devices, I won't have to pay extra for the Canada/Mexico feature, and I'll get an instant upgrade of my Nexus 6 from 32GB to 64GB. It looks like the only reason to go with the Family Plan is for the unlimited data."
tmobile,3cpmyr,easyxtarget,2,Thu Jul 9 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"First off, the 2 lines for $100 plan is a Simple Choice Plan and includes all the benefits of one except this new roaming thing. You can add that roaming thing to your plan whenever you want (so if you are going to Canada or Mexico, like a few days before you leave and remove the feature when you get back). This way you are probably like paying $10-$20 a year for that feature (unless you are constantly going to one of those countries). If I were you I would hold on to the Nexus 6 until you want to upgrade it and then just sell it on Swappa, assuming you can get a conservative $250 for it that saves you a lot of money). Also I am confused as to why the finance prices are different for the unlimited plan and 3GB plan in your chart, the devices would be the same cost each month and if you want JUMP they would both be $10 a month more.    tl;dr Both plans are Simple Choice plans, one is 3GB per line and the other is Unlimited, each would be $100/month for service with the only difference being that when you want to travel to Mexico or Canada you would need to pay an extra $10 for that bill to get free calling and high-speed data."
tmobile,3cpmyr,anwserman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:20:55 2015 UTC,Thanks. I decided to go with the Unlimited Family Plan and I'll just add in the Canada/Mexico feature before each trip for $10.

Looks like you're being charged for the full price but a credit is showing up. So when you go up to pay, will this credit automatically deduct?

tmobile,3cqczr,Deceptiveideas,2,Fri Jul 10 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"Any other preferences? It's generally best to go with a T-Mobile branded device for VoLTE, WiFi calling, and hardware/software optimizations but I've had good experiences with unlocked devices as well.   The LG Stylo is just outside of your price range for now at $290. ZTE ZMAX sells for $150 at Walmart (Walmart Family Mobile box/branded, same as TMo). I've owned a couple of them before giving them to family and generally enjoy the experience. It's big and a little heavy but the battery life is outstanding and the experience is good. I had the Idol 3 briefly and enjoyed it but I was so impressed with my cheapo... ... $65 (@Walmart/Walmart Family Mobile box/branded) Alcatel Pop Astro. It has limitations that won't hold well compared to the midrange devices you mentioned but it's quite good for the price and I'm pretty happy with it as a 'power user' thus far. It's got full LTE support as well as VoLTE. The Zenfone 2 lacks LTE band 12 which is a significant drawback in my book even though I don't live in a band 12 market. I visit band 12 markets or drive through them occasionally and have found that the extra signal is very valuable. Samsung Galaxy Avant sells for $125-150 in the Walmart box and has a pretty nice list of specs and gizmos... except for the fact that it carries Samsung Touchwiz. Some people don't mind it but I find it almost as displeasing as iOS. YMMV but it is a good offering at its price point. The LG Leon is on sale at Best Buy right now for ~$70. It's got most of the same drawbacks as the Astro but is a bit better in the on-board storage department though it's not as aesthetically pleasing, physically, IMO."

Forward calls to your GV number to your carrier number and install the Google Voice app. The integration with hangouts is great IMO. Then you can choose which number you want to dial from.

I don't see sprint gaining 1.8MM subscribers.  And the inactive MVNO numbers will cause further drops as well, in the next few quarters ..

This is an ongoing issue, and it seems like T-mobile knows about it, but it hasn't been corrected. I spoke with customer care and they sent me out a new SIM card, but that didn't solve the problem. A few answers that you might received on here are, that this was fixed a while ago.  You may also be told that you should switch to using Google Hangouts.  Oh, and that MMS is crappy technology and that it doesn't work on any carrier. Try using the search function for the sub and you will find some similar posts.

They helped me switch out my SIM card with 3 different SIMS.  One of the SIMS we put in a Nexus 6 and still experienced the same problem.   It's a network problem, not a device issue for me.

tmobile,3cmoj8,Logvin,5,Thu Jul 9 02:50:47 2015 UTC,"Craig Moffett has been spouting off about the doom of Sprint for ages and yet Sprint still stands. Back in 2012 he caused a 4.5% drop in the stock when he said they were at a ""very legitimate risk"" of bankruptcy, primarily due to their deal with Apple and their debt maturities in 2014/2015. Later that year Sprint retired the majority of the debt coming due in 2014/2015. No other analysts were putting Sprint at any significant risk of bankruptcy at the time.  Anything Moffett says about Sprint should be taken with a load of salt. He is the most negative analyst towards Sprint."
tmobile,3cmoj8,evan1123,2,Thu Jul 9 04:28:14 2015 UTC,"I think the only reason Sprint is around is because Softbank swept in with deep pockets and bought them. Their new CEO came in and started laying people off like crazy... upwards of 3K employees. I'm sure much of that was fat that needed trimming... and in the short term it makes the books look good because you look more profitable. At the end of the quarter though, their only adds are uber cheap M2M and tablet plans.... not very profitable.  I think the RadioShack deal was a huge mistake too. The #1 product RadioShack sold was Sprint phones already... and it lost money. So now Sprint is somehow going to do better with a co-brand? I think that Sprint knew it couldn't afford to loose it's #1 TPR partner and the retail presence it gave them, so they had little choice but to buy up. Just because you have more stores, doesn't mean they will sell more. They still need to improve their offerings to drive people into the doors."
tmobile,3cmoj8,Logvin,2,Thu Jul 9 05:03:18 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say what would have happened had the Softbank buyout never occurred. Sprint was certainly in no danger of going under in the near term back in 2012 according to every analyst besides Moffett.  Sprint has slowly been moving closer and closer to net positive postpaid phone adds since Marcelo took over. Last quarter their churn dropped significantly to under 2%, which is definitely a good sign of improvement, and we will see how much improvement there has been since when Q2 results are reported. Obviously postpaid phone net adds is the #1 thing Sprint needs right now, and it is also Marcelo's #1 goal.  Sprint picked up those Radio Shack, now ""Sprint Shack,"" locations for dirt cheap and more than doubled their retail presence very quickly. Keep in mind that Sprint had the fewest retail locations of all providers in the US prior to the Radio Shack deal. Marcelo has also stated that there has been increased traffic to Sprint stores as a result of their promotions, so I don't think increasing retail presence will hurt them. It's still a little early to tell how good of a deal this was for Sprint, but I would imagine we'll hear some preliminary results in the Q2 earnings report."
tmobile,3cmoj8,Thundertime88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:02:14 2015 UTC,I think they are over-leveraging themselves with too much retail. The cost of labor and running those stores is going to be a much bigger drain than what they will get.
tmobile,3cmoj8,evan1123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:39:15 2015 UTC,what hurts sprint the most is this COVERAGE.
tmobile,3cmoj8,Thundertime88,3,Thu Jul 9 07:49:25 2015 UTC,Quality coverage? Probably. Coverage area? Not a chance. T-Mobile has clearly proven that low coverage area doesn't hurt that much.

tmobile,3cmoj8,mitten_mike,2,Thu Jul 9 13:25:16 2015 UTC,"Well yah see that's a funny statement, because back when USCC exited the Chicago and STL markets Sprint bought their PCS spectrum and tower leases, and are now actively converting the old USCC sites to Sprint sites.

And a carrier can also get Apple to make a carrier file for iPhones if they are added without having to release a new version of iOS.   This area here is where Apple kills Android.

tmobile,3cld0j,scarysc2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:52:58 2015 UTC,I still think there are ways to go when it comes to SMB. Even if it's something as simple as more SMHS. I don't think it would become a major hog on the network seeing that we're still a drop in the bucket when it comes to SMB/Gov vs Individual/Family accounts compared to Verizon & AT&T.
tmobile,3cld0j,_jefff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:00:17 2015 UTC,oh sorry what i actually meant by business was actually t-mobiles revenue. with the recent changes to our pay im sure they want to increase the amount they make per customer.

tmobile,3cqpy4,sammyboy405,0,Fri Jul 10 02:02:29 2015 UTC,I've got similar issues. I ordered an iPhone 6 Jump upgrade for my wife on Monday. Got it ordered then once I paid and the order was complete it then tells me it's back Ordered. So I contact TForce they tell me there's 6 in stock and not to worry it'd make it before the weekend because I paid the $25 for expedited shipping. Ok cool. It's Friday and its still backordered so I asked to cancel it and I'd just goto the store and get it local. I was then told it takes 3 Business Days to Cancel and 7 days to be refunded after the Cancelation..  And they have no idea when stock will be in or when it will ship now. What the Crap! Up until now I've had Superior Customer service!!  So my first Jump upgrade for my wife's phone has been a complete flop.  Hope they find your tablet.
tmobile,3cqpy4,rodalorn,2,Fri Jul 10 16:01:18 2015 UTC,"If you call care a via 611 a coach can cancel back orders and you don't have to wait on a refund, since the order doesn't charge till it ships."

Regardless, the cellphone tower you are on might be serving a swath of people a 5-10 square miles wide, which is a huge area.  Just because it's quiet where you are it doesn't mean the tower isn't busy.  (I will agree, it's more likely to not be congested but not guarenteed.)  Call customer service or tweet T-Force on twitter.  And as someone else pointed out on here, a 21GB plan elsewhere is a few hundred dollars expensive. Not ideal, but $80 for unlimited data that can be slow is a lot better than losing a few hundred bucks monthy."

For DC-HSPA+, it is 42Mbit.  The DC-HSPA combinds 2 separate 5+5 (10+10Mhz total) blocks to achieve double the data rate. This is all using 64-QAM and no MIMO.  There are no networks in the USA using dual cell+mimo, most likely never will be because everyone has moved to LTE. That graph will help explain the different combinations available for HSPA.  Currently in the USA, AT&T is using HSPA+21.  AT&T never went to DC-HSPA+42, only T-Mobile.  For LTE, T-Mobile is not using 4+2 MIMO in all areas, but a lot of them.  The 4+2 does already help coverage at the edge of the cell and also helps keep the speeds stay more consistent. Eventually I suspect every site will be upgraded to it, because once handsets come out that have 4 transmit antennas T-Mobile can double the available data capacity with the same amount of spectrum.  (In good signal conditions, mind you)"
tmobile,3cn1k5,nanyo,2,Thu Jul 9 05:06:28 2015 UTC,"Section 6. Dual-Cell of article  High-Speed Downlink Packet Access:       Dual Cell HSDPA (DC-HSDPA), known also as Dual Carrier, is the natural evolution of HSPA by means of carrier aggregation in the downlink.  UMTS licenses are often issued as 5, 10, or 20 MHz paired spectrum allocations. The basic idea of the multicarrier feature is to achieve better resource utilization and spectrum efficiency by means of joint resource allocation and load balancing across the downlink carriers.  An advanced HSPA network can theoretically support up to 28 Mbit/s and 42.2 Mbit/s with a single 5 MHz carrier for Rel7 (MIMO with 16QAM) and Rel8 (64-QAM + MIMO), in good channel conditions with low correlation between transmit antennas. An alternative method to double the data rates is to double the bandwidth to 10 MHz (i.e. 2×5 MHz) by using DC-HSDPA. Additionally, some diversity and joint scheduling gains can also be expected  with improved QoS for end users in poor environment conditions where existing techniques such as MIMO spatial multiplexing cannot be used to increase data rates. In 3GPP a study item was completed in June 2008. The outcome can be found in technical report 25.825.  New HSDPA User Equipment categories 21-24 have been introduced that support DC-HSDPA. DC-HSDPA can support up to 42.2 Mbit/s, but unlike HSPA, it does not need to rely on MIMO transmission.  From Release 9 onwards it will be possible to use DC-HSDPA in combination with MIMO used on both carriers.  This will allow theoretical speed of up to 84.4 Mbit/s.

tmobile,3cn1k5,TheElement115,3,Thu Jul 9 05:02:21 2015 UTC,the antennas work together to get a better and more accurate signal as well as more capacity and speed by creating more channels between the tower and the device
tmobile,3cn1k5,magentafullsoul,3,Thu Jul 9 05:46:56 2015 UTC,"No, it was designed to increase capacity so Verizon can serve and charge twice the number of customers using the same network /s  Seriously, 2x2 MIMO was simply designed to double network capacity using the same amount of spectrum. Two antennas broadcast different signal over the same spectrum and your phone is able to receive twice the number of bits per second.  4x2 MIMO was designed to increase signal-to-noise ratio.

When you port your phone number to T-Mobile it will automatically cancel your Sprint service, you don't have to do anything. You'll initially be responsible for paying the ETF out of your own pocket.

This also requires you to trade in your current phone and by a new one from T-Mobile.

If there is data, you can see what the experience/coverage might be. If there isn't data, who knows(no one tested it versus zero signal)... Then, you use the test drive to confirm the coverage and building penetration before switching over  One line unlimited* T-Mobile service costs $80+tax/fees(10-20%). If you are getting a new phone, youll need to pay addition(eg $649 iPhone 6 16GB? Divide $649 by 24 months=$27, pay $27/month more for 24 months, then you own the phone ).  *if you use more than 21GB on unlimited, T-Mobile may deprioritize your connection if the cell tower is congested. This deprioritization will go away if you move to an uncongested tower, or reset at the start of your cycle"

tmobile,3ck1q3,nk1,4,Wed Jul 8 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"It was a weird time before the notion of truly nationwide coverage.  T-Mobile roamed on the old Cingular orange network in SoCal and Cingular roamed on the T-Mobile built network in New York City.  Eventually I think T-Mobile ended up picking up most of the sites from Cingular orange as a result of Cingular picking up the ATT blue network in SoCal during that merger.  But yes, they used to network share in the two biggest markets in the U.S.  The cellular landscape, and America as a whole, was far less catty back then. Regional networks were still around and thriving, and data networks were just getting off the ground."
tmobile,3ck1q3,Mcnst,10,Thu Jul 9 04:27:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. They got an HSPA (""4G"") agreement when AT&T failed to merge with them. Only postpaid customers are allowed to roam with data. Prepaid is limited to voice/SMS only."

tmobile,3ck1q3,danrant,3,Wed Jul 8 16:32:14 2015 UTC,It is limited because AT&T charges a ridiculous amount per MB (something like $2.)

And what does this have to do with how much VIAERO or Union charges?  Clearly T-Mobile has enough power to make sure Viaero and Union don't charge it more than what T-Mobile itself charges for domestic roaming on its nationwide network.
tmobile,3ck1q3,Mcnst,8,Wed Jul 8 16:53:51 2015 UTC,"The price was revealed in T-Mobile's FCC petition to regulate domestic roaming rates. While they didn't specifically name AT&T they wrote something like ""carriers that charge us per MB on average charge"" and then provided a historical graph that shows about $0.27/MB in 2014. Since AT&T is the major roaming partner it's obvious that's what they charge T-Mobile. It's not $2/MB but still 50MB cost $13.5. If a customer needs more than that it's better to let them go and switch to AT&T otherwise such customers are unprofitable for T-Mobile.  Not sure about Viaero but I believe Union Wireless and T-Mobile have a reciprocal flat rate roaming agreement. They don't charge each other per MB but rather charge fixed amount per period no matter how much roaming data is used.  EDIT: Viaero's ToS dated Jan 2015 state that Subscriber’s Roaming Usage allowance is equal to the lesser of (a) 51,200 kilobytes or 20% of the kilobytes included with selected data plan; so they don't have nationwide unlimited data roaming on T-Mobile network."

I've never heard of this, and it's not mentioned anywhere within the aforementioned doc, either.   I have several sources, the main one being personal, first hand experience in roaming on both networks. When I go east, and roam on Viaero Wireless, my usage shows up as 'X MB of 50 MB Domestic Roaming', however the counter doesn't go up when I roam on Union Wireless to the north and north west of the metro area.   There are others who experience this as well  1) http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1864878-Roaming-on-Union-Wireless-for-extended-periods-of-time  2) http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1853907-Official-rural-roaming-partner-thread  Both threads clearly state that Union Wireless does not count against your domestic roaming cap, however you are correct that there is no official document from T-Mobile stating this, so it's possible (but unlikely) that it could change at any moment.    When I was driving through WY, I recall that at certain times I was roaming on AT&T, others it was Union. Since you claim Union is not really roaming at all, why is AT&T still provided as an option in the same area?   Most likely for the same reason why you can roam on AT&T when there is native T-Mobile coverage, they have roaming areas, and sometimes those areas overlap. In theory, your and all T-Mobile phones should prefer Union Wireless over AT&T, but if Union has a gap in coverage, and AT&T has service there, it might jump to AT&T."

E.g., if there's just a building or two in an area where T-Mo has no in-building coverage at all, but AT&T has 5 bars, you won't roam."
tmobile,3ck1q3,DrewFlyBoy,2,Wed Jul 8 16:36:16 2015 UTC,"This is not exactly true.  I live in an area of Pennsylvania (16801) that has advertised LTE coverage, and I'll roam onto AT&T (with data!) in areas where there are T-Mobile deadspots.   Unless T-Mobile decided to make an exception to overlay AT&T roaming over native coverage because of how absolutely hilly the region of the state is - and how unfriendly that is to T-Mobile's midband frequency.  Within a half mile of my house, I get T-Mobile LTE, T-Mobile Edge, T-Mobile HPSA+, and AT&T 4G.  Though to be fair, there's a good dead spot for all four carriers about 1.5 miles from my house."

Walk another block or two, I get AT&T 4G with data.  Walk another block or two, I get T-Mobile Edge.  Continue walking, it's back to T-Mobile 4G.  This whole time, I can use data services etc, even when roaming on AT&T.  This is contrary to what most people say, that you can only roam in areas that T-Mobile doesn't have native coverage (e.g., I'm currently in Northern WI where there is no T-Mobile service, and I've been roaming on ATT for the last month).  Nope, I roam daily whenever I'm out and about or taking public metro in State College, PA :)  Yet, I've had similar experiences to you as well - I've tried forcing an AT&T connection myself via the network list when I was in a big building with 0 T-Mobile bars, to no avail.

tmobile,3clx4v,Interdimension,2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Though the wording is that you should turn in your current carrier phone, you can actually just purchase a cheap AT&T branded phone and turn that in as your current phone. And keep your iPhone 6, of course.  Keep it and request the unlock code from AT&T after your ETFs are paid for (which you'll be required to do before switching to T-Mobile to terminate your existing contract)."

You're suggesting that I buy the cheapest phone available through AT&T and turn that in as my current phone. That'll allow me to keep my soon to be unlocked iPhone 6 Plus and use it with T-Mobile. Unfortunately, the cheapest phone I see on AT&T is $100 without an annual contract.  If I switch from AT&T to T-Mobile, I'll have to pay the ETF in full. After making the switch, T-Mobile will reimburse me for the ETF.  Does that sound correct?"
tmobile,3clx4v,Interdimension,2,Thu Jul 9 00:54:07 2015 UTC,Actually when you do the ETF reimbursement you can trade in ANY phone as long as it's in working condition with no damage. Does not have to specifically be an AT&T phone.

tmobile,3clx4v,purplemountain01,2,Thu Jul 9 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"Regarding the ETF payoff, correct. T-Mobile will reimburse you after you switch. AT&T will send a bill asking for ETF payments about a month after you terminate service with them, which you will need to show to T-Mobile to get reimbursed.  However, for sake of getting unlock codes, you'll be paying the ETFs to AT&T in advance. Nothing complicated, nothing changes. Just that you'll pay early to get the unlock codes.  As for the AT&T branded phone part... maybe I was wrong. Might want to take /u/Alchemic_Psycho's advice."

tmobile,3clx4v,kylesuo,3,Thu Jul 9 00:55:19 2015 UTC,"We were never heavy data users. We were on the 1 GB Mobile Share Value Plan with four smartphone users. It ended up about $210 monthly (since one line used contracts to upgrade) after taxes.  We like to save money where and when possible. At the time, AT&T was the best balance between price and coverage. Yes, the 1 GB data allotment is very stingy on AT&T's part, but it sufficed for us. Of course, we wouldn't have minded more data.  What prompted the switch? The 4 lines (2.5 GB each) for $100 promotion. That was the tipping point.  Although I knew AT&T's network was beyond comparison to T-Mobile's, I just couldn't justify paying $90 extra monthly just for better coverage. Not to mention I live in a suburb and rarely enter rural areas.  While T-Mobile's lackluster network does have me annoyed at times during cross-country roadtrips, it's nothing I can't forgive at $120 monthly (after taxes). It's $90 cheaper than AT&T's, and that alone can excuse T-Mobile's shortcomings (for me, anyway).  And after the recent JUMP! On Demand promotion, in which you could snag an iPhone 6/6 Plus for $216 off retail, as well as other perks like Music Freedom, I have absolutely zero regrets for switching. None.

I unlocked my iPhone for use on T-Mobile's network in less than 24 hours, but I was off-contract. Since you are still on-contract, you'll have to call AT&T customer support and tell them you want to buy out your contract, but that becomes problematic because, if you close your account before porting, you may lose your number. Buying a cheap scapegoat phone to surrender so you can secure ETF reimbursement in the sign-up process might be your best bet. Good luck!"

tmobile,3cmk9y,Ashinjuka,2,Thu Jul 9 02:18:07 2015 UTC,S6 Edge.
tmobile,3cmk9y,Ashinjuka,3,Thu Jul 9 02:20:49 2015 UTC,FWIW the S6 Edge will probably get Android M fairly quickly once it's ready.
tmobile,3cmk9y,tom1226,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:39:28 2015 UTC,Hopefully. I've heard nothing but bad about how updates are done on Android. The only reason I haven't looked into flashing a ROM or rooting is because of Samsung pay.
tmobile,3cmk9y,muertex,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:41:40 2015 UTC,how long are we looking to wait for it to come after its released?   On its own it took 9 months for my 2013 X to get Lollipop. I don't expect it will ever see M unless I take matters into my own hands... but I actually plan to get rid of this thing as soon as I can now that it's been pretty much ruined by Lollipop. I never thought I would consider a Windows phone but I'm thinking about possibly getting one once 10 comes out. I preferred Android until the Lollipop fiasco. Now I have no confidence in their ability to deliver a good phone OS.

The router does not act as a booster, it is only a home internet router that gives you dual band, prioritizes Wi-Fi calls over everything else as well as it may booster your Wi-Fi's range.  Side note: The best way to get answers for questions such as yours where you would like to know if you can get one Cel-Fi and one router is to call 611(customer support). It can't hurt to ask!   Hopefully I was able to help some!"

tmobile,3clku7,DurantTheGOAT,2,Wed Jul 8 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile has a 2 for $100 plan. Both of you would get unlimited everything. It's a pretty good value and would bump up your 3GB and 1GB to infinite use for only $10 more a month.   On the topic of T-Mobile paying to switch, you would need to trade in your phone that's being leased from AT&amp;T and buy a phone from T-Mobile for them to pay it off.   For your lease, you would need to pay it entirely to get rid of it as I'm pretty sure the lower price would start a new lease. I'm not sure how the process works for T-Mobile to pay it off though."

tmobile,3clku7,krispykracker1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"OK.  T-Mobile has bought new spectrum for improved rural and indoor coverage in certain areas, and your area happens to be one of those. However, only certain phones support it. If you switch to T-Mobile and want good coverage, get a phone on this list (The list that says band 12 officially supported and enabled)   I recently got a galaxy S6 on the AT&T next program. It says I am eligible for an upgrade after 19 more installment payments have been paid which would be 513$. would paying that finish my AT&T contract or would I have to pay the remaining installment balance of 684$?   How did you get 684 from 513?  T-Mobile will reimburse you for your device payment agreement. You go to a T-Mobile store and port your number. This ends your service with Sprint. You then have to trade in the phone on which you have payments. Let's say you owe Sprint 500 bucks. Your S6 is valued at 150 (just a random number). T-Mobile will give you $350 on a prepaid Visa card and the 150 value from your S6 will be applied to your T-Mobile account."
tmobile,3clku7,dashzombie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:59:38 2015 UTC,"Hijacking his thread. I read on the main page that when you transfer over, T-Mobile will refund your remaining balance. Now does that mean your ETF and other charges? I don't have a phone to pay off, only my regular phone bill."
tmobile,3clku7,blaziecat1103,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"If you need to break a contract and pay an early termination fee in order to switch from your current carrier, T-Mobile will reimburse you for the cost of the early termination fee. The fine print is that you need to trade in a working phone and then buy a phone from T-Mobile to be eligible for the offer. The phone that you trade in doesn't have to be the phone you're using, and you can switch away from the phone you bought from T-Mobile. This means that you can trade in a working dumbphone and buy a dumbphone or low-end smartphone from T-Mobile, then get a new SIM card that fits your now unlocked phone from your old carrier(if it's necessary)."

tmobile,3ckb5q,danrant,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"I view this as a deal with a few missing pieces. Dish and T-Mobile would go good together in a spectrum sense but on because they both have mid band spectrum. Dish does own 5 or 10mhz nationwide of 700mhz E-Block, and AWS-1 which from my understanding has not been authorized for LTE usage by the powers that be. Also Dish is fast approaching some early due dates on deployments with that spectrum.   Now let's say Dish and T-Mobile reach an agreement by the end of the month and announce a merger. Great but what to do with Dishs' satellite business, a field John Legere is not familiar with. We in my opinion they should place Junior executive in charge of that side of the company but somebody with a little know how. The bigger question is what type of deal will Dish throw at DT.    We all know that DT wants out of the US market so their looking for a buyout offer that they can capitalize on. Dish doesnt have deep enough pockets to secure a deal that would fit those parameters. They would need to secure a loan is not several loans, doing so however would place a debt ceiling on T-Mobile and with the 600mhz auction looming that isn't a wise move.   The better scenario would be to form a joint venture with another company to secure funding and buyout DT shares, but who would do it. Well how about Centurylink (Google would be a better choice but that not going to happen), their an American based Telecom company with no mobile branch and no TV venture to speak of. Centurylink also owns some fiber that could be used at the tower for better data speeds.  Generally I believe that a deal between Dish and T-Mobile will happen but a third partner with generous funding will also play a part in this deal to bring us closer to a better mobile tomorrow."

If you've sold prepaid a THIS month and the spiff isn't showing up, submit for a correction. Also if your numbers aren't adding up, find out where things are short and again, submit a correction. That's what I suggest to my reps if something doesn't add up. That way you can get a straight answer as to where those spiffs are and why or why not they aren't showing up."

tmobile,3clk1s,TMobGirl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:41:49 2015 UTC,Most times when there is a spiff that is not an ongoing thing it shows up after the month ended. It use to come in email form as a recalculation now it's added into the commission under adjustments. You still get paid on it for the month you sold it. They did say that it wouldn't show on your commission statement when they announced the spiff.

tmobile,3chflb,CYNiK_sXe,12,Wed Jul 8 00:47:21 2015 UTC,"""POPs"" refers to how many people live in T-Mobile's coverage area.  So if T-Mobile covers a geographical area with one million people in it, that's one million POPs.  It doesn't mean all of them customers, it just means they're people that could potentially have good T-Mobile coverage."
tmobile,3chflb,magentasoul,7,Wed Jul 8 01:21:12 2015 UTC,PoPs mean Point of Presence.
tmobile,3chflb,silverwolfe08,3,Wed Jul 8 02:37:39 2015 UTC,History lesson: the term first came of usefulness when the Department of Justices sued to break up AT&T Bell in the 80's. At that time a POP referred to a single terminating location for a phone line.
tmobile,3chflb,dmaxel,3,Wed Jul 8 04:29:22 2015 UTC,"Question: If T-Mobile adds towers a location where no one actually lives, but plenty of people visit, does that help their POPs #s at all? For instance, if they add a ton of coverage to a stretch of highway with zero homes."
tmobile,3chflb,B1GEast,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:16:04 2015 UTC,"No, POPs is calculated by residences. But having such coverage would be beneficial anyways."

tmobile,3chflb,NexusPhan,6,Wed Jul 8 01:09:09 2015 UTC,I wonder if they'll announce roaming. Sprint's coverage maps are now showing 3G roaming on US Cellular so I wonder if they struck a deal with T-Mobile for LTE and Band 12.
tmobile,3chflb,nobody65535,3,Wed Jul 8 03:35:32 2015 UTC,That would be really sweet and makes perfect sense.  If this happens  we're talking about the potential for nationwide low band coverage on T-Mobile.
tmobile,3chflb,NexusPhan,5,Wed Jul 8 11:35:50 2015 UTC,I'd be ecstatic if they cleared Channel 51 in the Bay Area (KDTV-TV/Univision).   I had an email exchange with Mike Sievert but he would't comment. One redditor claimed T-Mobile was installing 700Mhz in prep for an agreement.   /u/icepick_  Do you believe this?
tmobile,3chflb,silverwolfe08,4,Wed Jul 8 05:33:55 2015 UTC,I'd imagine a concurrent operations agreement like T-Mobile has in NYC and LA is more likely that that station relocating.

tmobile,3cjynf,Wilhelm_Wallace,2,Wed Jul 8 14:29:58 2015 UTC,1) Lacking AWS HSPA+ is less important as time goes on since T-Mobile keeps repurposing AWS for LTE. You'll probably be fine. Arguably the more important is that the phone does not support band 12.  2) I believe that is correct but am not 100% sure.
tmobile,3cjynf,GinDaHood,2,Wed Jul 8 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  2013 Moto X on AT&T is the XT1058. It will feature a locked bootloader, so flashing anything other than AT&T branded OTAs will not be easily possible. I may be wrong but I do not believe root is possible on this device - not an issue if you predominantly run stock.  As far as cellular limitations, you will be missing Band 4 on HSPA+, so areas using Band 4 for HSPA+ deployments will be affected - this is becoming less and less of an issue as Band 4 HSPA+ is refarmed for Band 4 LTE, moving HSPA+ on Band 2, which the XT1058 has. With regards to LTE, you will receive signal for Band 2 and 4 LTE without issue.  You should be receiving an OTA for 5.1 soon as ATT models appear to be receiving them recently, and will be up to date."

tmobile,3ciezb,expertzero,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:58:00 2015 UTC,"I'm unclear as to why this is necessary, isn't wifi calling supposed to work in the dingiest darkest basement?  Does the phone need a certain level of cell network strength to make wifi calling work somehow?"
tmobile,3ciezb,peabody,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"because some times your router blocks certain ports for wifi calling to work    plus, since you get coverage outside, not inside, either the 4g lte booster or wifi booster will work for u"

tmobile,3ciezb,RedPill115,2,Wed Jul 8 10:19:37 2015 UTC,"My best guess is that either the update went wrong (you might be able to fix it by resetting to factory settings or taking it to a store), or there's something unreliable about your wifi.  However, if I'm reading your post right, you still can't connect after this happens right? Do you have to reboot your phone to get wifi calling working again?  If so, my guess would be the update to the phone went bad. You might be able to fix it by resetting your phone. Or if that doesn't work, not sure if they can reflash it at a store.  Wifi calling is not dependent on the cell network, I can set my android phone to ""wifi calling only"" and it works."
tmobile,3ciezb,prometaSFW,2,Wed Jul 8 04:03:44 2015 UTC,"Reboot is the most reliable way to get it working again after it does this, yeah.  I am open to trying a phone reset, but I'm just really curious as to how an update going bad would do this.  Any idea where I might start looking or testing to see if the Wifi network is the problem?  Seems pretty reliable on my other Mac and attached wireless clients."

If it's stable it will lose almost no packets, always way less than 1%. If it's not stable it will lose 1% or above. (I did have this happen once, online games wouldn't stay connected, had to replace the modem to fix it).  However, trying to figure out how to do that on an iPhone is way more work than I want to invest in it lol.  Software is very brittle, any 1 tiny piece of it going wrong can fuck over the whole system. If just 1 byte inside the wifi calling code got written wrong, it could cause the whole thing to crash and stop working. Which sounds like it might be what's happening."

I reached out to TForce while on 8.3 and they told me it was very common and their official recommendation is everyone reboot their phones daily (wtf?)"
tmobile,3ciezb,AcousticDouche,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:29:03 2015 UTC,This could be caused by the lack of an E911 address or one that needs updating/reconfirming. Check ma.web2go.com (on your phone via cellular data) and click 911 Address on there to update/confirm and try again.

But I loved that little phone, unfortunately its not as waterproof as they say. (RIP)    I have a Z3 now and I have significantly better reception with band 12 in my area.  I guess the answer is it depends if band 12 is in your area.   I would have gotten the Z3C in a heartbeat if it had band 12.    If you are a fan of small size phones, the Z3 is manageable if you don't use a case.  I have a glass screen cover on the front and back and it works well"

But that won't be for a while as this phone shows no signs of slowing down si cell I got it around release time.   I bought the phone when I was still on at&t and the phone itself is really nice which is why I've stuck with it. There's no band 12 phone of this size and specs, so even on tmo there's no alternative if you want a compact phone without sacrificing performance.

Tmo offers a ""loaner-phone"" program, but only if your local store actually has one in stock (doubtful) and the RMA process takes around 2 weeks.  I picked up a MotoG 2nd gen on a good deal and have been using it as a backup and as far as usability goes it's fine.  Not cutting edge, but functional.

Having the app set to cache songs that are being streamed is one thing, downloading (used to be called pinning) is another.  Music Freedom is designed to allow songs being streamed not to count against your data usage.  With caching enabled, any song previously streamed is cached so naturally listening to those doesn't count against your data usage.  I'm not sure about downloading/pinning through the app though.

If you have high signal strength from the booster but poor signal-to-noise ratio the bars will be low. Since the booster is operating on the same frequencies as the towers around you, the signal from the towers is noise as far as your phone is concerned.  Secondly there is no standard how the bars are displayed. Some devices show signal strength only, some factor signal-to-noise ratio in. The scale is different on different devices, operating systems and even operating system releases."

Even so, there is likely a more optimal location for both units. Test around. I understand they work best furthest from each other, among other things.  With the N6, you can check the engineering screen for useful information like SNR, the higher (20ish?) the better. If it's low (single digits) then there might be too much noise from interference and such at that particular location.  edit: links!"

tmobile,3ci33z,radroachbrz,10,Wed Jul 8 02:06:00 2015 UTC,All the music stuff that doesn't count as data doesn't get throttled either.  I use Spotify like a mad beast.
tmobile,3ci33z,Herdnerfer,6,Wed Jul 8 02:11:44 2015 UTC,"Reddit is mostly text, and would load quickly even on the worst speeds. White listed services like music streaming and speed tests are exempt."
tmobile,3ci33z,Vtrossi,2,Wed Jul 8 02:21:33 2015 UTC,"This is true.  But before there were unlimited plans, (back in 2012) you could still browse and post to reddit even when you ran completely out of data.  Every other site was blocked, reddit however was permitted.   To further the point, pages, ads, and images still load instantaneously, even though some of these assets are over 15KB in size."
tmobile,3ci33z,PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:24:31 2015 UTC,"really? when i was in a diff country for a month and limited to 2G speeds on 3G (only had 3G bands), it would load direct imgur links quickly but not reddit links"
tmobile,3ci33z,jaminmc,4,Wed Jul 8 07:56:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing is throttled on an unlimited high speed data plan. When you go over 21 gigs in a month, you get lower priority when a site gets congested. Normal white listed items like speedtest.net and music freedom are also lumped in the depriorizatiin. After you go over 21 gigs you are only slowed down on overloaded towers. People on those towers that have a higher priority still experience slower speeds too, just not as slow, because they have a higher priority.   So if your soundcloud is working well when your are on a congested tower, it is probably because it has a good buffer, and loads the date in the seconds when the tower is less congested, and it has faster speeds.   Not if you are referring to a plan that has a set amount of high speed, ie 3 gig, and you go over that, white listed sites like speedtest.net and music freedom are white listed, and not throttled. So you can still use Spotify or soundcloud to stream all the Britney Spears, Flow Rida, or whatever people are into these days that you want."

Yes, surely some of that was apps but not all of it.   I don't tether. I rarely use the hotspot. I don't watch Netflix on my phone. I don't download torrents on my phone. I honestly don't know exactly how I used so much data.  I know some of the audio streaming programs aren't supposed to count against data, but I don't know off-hand if Pandora and Google Music do.

There's little reason to be paying for visual voicemail - the only part you'd need to pay for is voicemail to text transcribing, and you get voicemail for free otherwise. Your call obviously, just fyi, you still have voicemail and you still have the visual app (just with no speech to text text).  I don't know for sure if it ended, but if Verizon really would work for you better, I thought it was $80 or $95/month on Verizon for 10gb, and like I said 15gb for $100 or $115. (Before taxes and monthly equipment charges though).  You could download an app onto your phone that should give you a better idea of what app is using the most data (though apps don't know which are counted as free music data and which aren't)."

If your talking coverage, quality, etc. T-Mobile is stepping it up to their competitors level, not bringing down the rest of the industry. If it meant in terms of pricing, profits, etc. I get it... and it's a good thing, AT&T and Verizon are some fat cats, in all my years as a AT&T/Cingular customer they only ever reduced rates or offered specials, because they HAD to, to match competitors.  2) Article mentions how T-mobile is just a wireless carrier as if it's a bad thing - I like that... I'm not a big fan for bundling. Most companies that bundle offer great intro rates then it jumps up later, and these bundles compel you to get crap you don't really need to, because i.e. with the promo rate well it's only $10 more if I tack on a house phone... (goes up to $40/mo more after 12 months), and one day you may wake up and realize why am I paying $40/mo for this I don't even use it I have a freakin' cell phone."

tmobile,3cdqc4,Weakends,6,Tue Jul 7 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"WiFi calling is in AOSP, but it requires proprietary qcom dependencies.  Adding to BYOD phones would be next to impossible because almost all phones have carrier variants."
tmobile,3cdqc4,evan1123,0,Tue Jul 7 05:40:43 2015 UTC,I don't know why this is said. T-Mobile could allow its dependencies to be put into Android or Google could have Android download the dependencies based on SIM.

tmobile,3cdqc4,RedTib,2,Tue Jul 7 17:23:28 2015 UTC,As long as device manufacturers pay for the necessary software from Qualcomm and do the integration it will work.  What you described with downloading software based on SIM card won't work.
tmobile,3cdqc4,evan1123,3,Tue Jul 7 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"That would be great, but that's not something T-Mobile alone can control. I know that Wi-Fi calling was added to Android and at least the nexus 6 supports it, but is it not in AOSP?"

If selling it locally on Craigslist doesn't work out, I'm sure it'd move quickly on Swappa.  Note that in order to sell your phone to someone else, you'll need to pay off the EIP in full. This represents a larger up front cost for you, but I bet you'll be able to recoup almost all of it (or at least a greater percentage) compared to trading it in."

AT&T is switching from TDMA to GSM, and I'm working for a local Mom & Pop PC repair shop that also sells cells on the Mall floor.  Get in early on the GSM and get used to it just in time for the Cingular buyout to be announced.  Having been indoctrinated by all the customer complaints about Cingular (including a good friend of mine actively having issues), I decide I don't want to go anywhere near that.  Switch to our biggest seller, Alltel, and the Moto v60i.  The year is 2008.  Alltel has been purchased by Big Red, and smartphones are now a thing ""for everybody"".  My wife and I are planning our wedding, and merging the cell accounts is high on that list.  She has a Verizon MN number, I still have my AT&T OH number.  Verizon won't let us merge because our numbers are from ""different billing regions"".  AT&T gives the same excuse.  T-Mobile has a deal on a Blackberry Pearl that is making my wife drool, and doesn't care about the area codes in a family plan.  She jumps first, decides she doesn't like the Blackberry, and gets the G1 off eBay.  I finish my contract at VZW, and join her with my own G1 just in time for the wedding.

My brother kept going over our 40 GB plan, so I convinced our parents to put the 2 of us on the 2 for $100 and lower their Verizon plan to 2 GB since they were reluctant to leave. My brother's iPhone 6 works fine my Droid Maxx had problems. I just got a Galaxy S6 last week from #phoneshame (thanks again John Legere!) and band 12 (which is all over here in West Los Angeles) fixes the two places where band 4 didn't work well and Verizon only had 1x in these places. Overall the experience has been awesome and I plan to stay as the network and value is worlds better than Verizon."

To top it off I got behind on my bill by a few hundred when I moved and had trouble getting work. After finding work and getting my first pay check, I called the AT&T rep and told them my situation and that all I had was $100 to pay towards my bill. A hundred bucks was really all that was left over after food, gas, other essentials. The AT&T rep was all like ""No Prob, we understand and thanks for letting us know. I made some note on your account that we have talked and the resolution. Go to the nearest At&t store and use the kiosk to pay what you can."" So I did, I gave AT&T all that I could give and about a week and a half later they still turned my service off. After that I went to T-Mobile with their five favorites.

The only thing you would lose is theft protection.  There are other insurance companies, but typically, third party insurance companies will charge you between $100-150 for a 2 year protection plan that covers everything other than loss or theft, meaning you have to return your old phone to them in exchange for a new one. You normally get 3 or 4 claims per 2 years. Claims are usually transferable if you sell your phone.  For reference, SquareTrade is $100 for 2 years with 3 claims."

I don't know who has been telling you about LTE upgrades or exactly what they told you to expect but the truth is that we expect all or almost all of the 2g to be converted to LTE in the coming months, before the end of the year. It's reasonable to say that, if things go as planned, at least 90% of the 2G spots you're encountering will be covered by that time. Whether or not you stick around to see it is up to you.   There was a decent suggestion below about Cricket... well, do what you gotta do to be happy since being an unhappy customer doesn't do anyone any favors.

tmobile,3cdp10,Deceptiveideas,8,Tue Jul 7 02:43:35 2015 UTC,"It's gonna be the higher end of the 600 spectrum, so it will be very very similar in properties to the 700. You're phone will need new band support in order to support the newest frequency,  but I'm sure those bands will be integrated quickly since there are some big players in the auction. Does that answer both of your questions and do you have any others?   EDIT: As far as coverage goes, you will see a dramatic increase once it's all licensed, and finished, but that won't be until 2017 or even later. So we likely won't see a full speed 600 rollout until late 2017-2018.  EDIT2: speeds might not increase much unless they do carrier aggregation in which they combine two parts of the spectrum so they can have more bandwidth. Lowband isnt the fastest of the spectrum, but the other properties it has makes it worth it."
tmobile,3cdp10,TheElement115,2,Tue Jul 7 02:51:02 2015 UTC,Low frequency spectrum is not inherently slower than higher.   Only when you decide to cover huge areas from a single tower (think AT&T 850 North Dakota and further) does it start to slow down because of the number of people you're serving. Bitrates will also drop slightly if you are going really far (and still have good signal) but that is the case with all spectrum. Blame your phone for not being able to push out a better uplink.
tmobile,3cdp10,nk1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:00:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe what I'm confusing is compacity. High/mid band have a higher compacity correct? Which is why sprints band 41 would have sooo much compacity when aggregated.  Thanks for correcting me on that, and I'll make the edit just now."
tmobile,3cdp10,TheElement115,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:21:27 2015 UTC,In higher frequencies there is more spectrum (500 MHz within 2 GHz to 2.5 GHz versus 100 MHz within 700 MHz to 800 MHz) which allows for higher bandwidth networks (or more networks/companies within the same set of frequencies) and higher capacity.   Carrier aggregation is for providing higher peak speeds but load balancing between all three of those carriers (balancing users between each separate carrier) is what brings higher capacity.
tmobile,3cdp10,nk1,2,Tue Jul 7 17:42:30 2015 UTC,Doesn't the higher frequencies having higher energy have an effect on speeds and capacity?
tmobile,3cdp10,misteryub,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:46:35 2015 UTC,^^^^ that was my understanding
tmobile,3cdp10,TheElement115,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:48:58 2015 UTC,I don't think so. Speed and capacity are determined by the efficiency of the network running on the spectrum. Not the spectrum itself.
tmobile,3cdp10,nk1,2,Tue Jul 7 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"The reason for the 600 MHz auctions is to add MORE low-band spectrum for cellular telephone use.  Yes, technically 600 MHz spectrum will be better than 700 spectrum in terms of range and indoor penetration, but it will only be marginally better.  Data rates will be the same for equal signal strength and equal amounts of bandwidth (5/5 or 10/10 MHz, etc, is transparent to the user without apps or engineering mode on the phone).  The 600 MHz spectrum will also be given new LTE Band numbers (45 or higher?) and new phones with new modems will be required to use them.  My prediction is that the initial rollouts of towers and phones capable of using 600 MHz spectrum will happen in 2017 at the earliest, but my money is on 2019 for anything significant.  EDIT:  I guess I just echoed what others have already said, but I'm going to digress/ramble into a discussion on LTE bands and spectrum in this edit.  The parts of the 600 MHz spectrum they will be adding for cellular telephone use will be adjacent to the 700 MHz spectrum that T-Mobile has the license for.  ""700 MHz spectrum"" is a broad, general term that covers the range starting around 700 MHz and going to around 800 MHz (duh).  Specifically, T-Mobile has licenses for the lower portion of the ""700 a"" portion.  ""700 a"" is the kinda-made-up name for spectrum that covers 729 to 746 MHz for downlink (tower to phone) and 699 to 716 Mhz for uplink (phone to tower).  I think T-Mobile uses 700-705 and 730-735 MHz--that extra 1 MHz on the end acts as a guard buffer.  AT&T has licenses for ""700 b"" spectrum, or 734 to 746 MHz and 704 to 716 MHz (and they use 705-715 and 735-746 MHz, respectively).  Note the overlap between ""700 a"" and ""700 b"".  There are other ""700 MHz spectrum"" bands in existence, but I'm not sure who holds licenses for them.  On the device (cell phones) side they use different nomenclature: LTE Band numbers.  LTE Band 12 covers the ""700 a"" spectrum and LTE Band 17 covers the ""700 b"" spectrum.  A device that is capable of operating on LTE Band 12 should be able to operate on LTE Band 17, but not vice versa in the situation we have with T-Mobile and AT&T.  An LTE Band 12 or 17 phone won't work on other ""700 MHz spectrum"" bands.  Note: These band numbers only refer to LTE use though, not Edge, UMTS, or HSPA.  They just use broad generic terms like ""1700/2100"" or ""1900"" bands, which aren't really specific, but as far as I know haven't caused too much trouble for users.  I'm not really excited about non-LTE so I'm going to stop there.  In the 600 MHz incentive auction, UHF TV stations (TV channels 21-50, sans ch 37 which is reserved for scientific use) have the option to sell their licenses.  After that's all done, the amount of spectrum that has been sold will be auctioned off for cell phone use.  After that's all done, all the TV channels will be aggregated to the lowest end of the spectrum (starting at channel 21), and the highest end of the spectrum will be allocated to the auction winners (in a way that makes sense)."
tmobile,3cdp10,pbr4in,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that T-Mobile is aggressively pushing LTE on these lower bands.  This is probably for the best long term, but phones will have to support VoLTE in order to fully make use of the lower bands.

tmobile,3cdp10,brontide,2,Tue Jul 7 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"600 MHz will require new phones and pretty much all new phones in 2015, and certainly all of them in 2017 when 600MHz is deployed, will support VoLTE."

tmobile,3cci0x,Interdimension,-7,Mon Jul 6 22:28:15 2015 UTC,I assumed this too so according to Wikipedia it will involve something to do with their global service. Perhaps some minutes for free while overseas? Maybe no more $30 phone calls for butt dialing a 10 minute phone call?
tmobile,3cci0x,rodalorn,9,Mon Jul 6 22:39:38 2015 UTC,A 3 minute phone call only costs 60¢ with simple choice roaming
tmobile,3cci0x,mistame,-2,Mon Jul 6 22:57:38 2015 UTC,This is international calling from the USA. The receiving carrier sets the rate. In this case it was like $10 a minute and not on their $0.20 country list. The receiving country taxes international phone calls heavily plus some fuck you pricing from the receiving carrier and whatever piece T-Mobile took which probably wasn't as much.
tmobile,3cci0x,choff5507,3,Mon Jul 6 23:25:21 2015 UTC,"They've got ""stateside international talk"" for that. Sounds like if you're butt dialing to numbers outside the U.S. a lot you could benefit from it."

I think it'll start in the metropolises and megalopolises and spread out. Surely, there will be some mixture of refarming and densification.  when I put my tinfoil hat on, I suggest that Tmo will soon start shutting down PCS 3g in demanding markets where less than 15+15mhz PCS is available"
tmobile,3cc9pn,danrant,3,Mon Jul 6 21:34:11 2015 UTC,There are way too many 3G phones. They can't shutdown PCS 3G anytime soon. They will most likely shutdown 2G first or put it into UMTS guard bands of one 5x5 MHz UMTS carrier.
tmobile,3cc9pn,TheElement115,7,Tue Jul 7 18:26:18 2015 UTC,"Density, Density, Density. The same way they handle it in New York City traffic. Carrier Aggregation will help too, but as OtherAlan said, your phone has to support it (most phones after 2013 do) and it can take a while for T-Mobile to be able to deploy it.   In a webcast a while back, it became known to us that T-Mobile has 12k DAS nodes that they are going to deploy to help with congestion."
tmobile,3cc9pn,nk1,3,Mon Jul 6 20:29:48 2015 UTC,Oh we've known since the MetroPCS merger that they were getting those. About half are T-Mobile's and the other half are Metro's. MetroPCS had extensive DAS systems already going in most major cities which will give T-Mobile a big jumpstart when they redeploy them.   NYC especially. Metro has them on every light post in high traffic areas. They had to get really creative because they were only running 3+3 and 5+5 LTE.
tmobile,3cc9pn,OtherAlan,3,Tue Jul 7 04:37:55 2015 UTC,Your phone will have to support the band to CA across it. More deprioritization. LAA to 'borrow' spectrum Maybe space tower sites closer together? Can cause interference between them though I think.

My bill just arrived and I notice there is an 8$ charge for insurance and warranty on my new iPhone 6 as part of the new jump on demand program.   This is the 2nd time that I have been billed for services that I neither requested nor want.   It is a waste of time at the least and fraud at the worst !
tmobile,3ch8kb,kapyrna,2,Tue Jul 7 22:05:22 2015 UTC,Might be either policy or practice to put JOD on a phone that has EIP remaining on it?  Just like a car insurance company requiring fill coverage on a vehicle with remaining balance on its purchase.

It's pretty much illegal to discriminate someone based on their disability: http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/practices/  An employer must make reasonable accommodations to allow an employee to work.  Would the stool be the only issue?  To me, it would be minor to get equipment to allow an employee to perform their duty at a tall station.  You don't know unless you try!  Follow proper employment application procedure - apply for the job, call in for the status of the application a few days after you applied, and if you're lucky enough for an interview - bring up how your disability has made you a stronger, more empathetic human being.  Turn it into an asset onto why you should be part of the team, and display how much of a people person you really are.  Physical capability to do a job is one thing, actually being a good match for a job is another. :)  Prove that you are a great match, and your boss will gladly help make accommodations to let you work best as possible."

I don't doubt they'll eventually get there, but their 'proposed LTE coverage by the end of 2015' looks more like they just laid their 700mhz spectrum holdings map over their existing coverage map and said 'well build ALL of it out by the end of the year', which is crazy."

tmobile,3ccoer,Alchemic_Psycho,7,Tue Jul 7 05:57:40 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. Postpaid and prepaid use the same network, yes. But at the EDC festival, it was essentially a HUGE traffic jam on a congested freeway and your friend was further up in line to get out of the traffic jam because he/she was postpaid and you were forced to the back because you're prepaid.  Outside of roaming, all T-Mobile customers use the same network but postpaid is given first dibs at network resources, then prepaid and then MNVO's. So at a large event if T-Mobile's network is under strain, you have the best shot of getting something if you're postpaid."

tmobile,3ccoer,Cjaiceman,8,Mon Jul 6 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"Verizon, AT&T and Sprint all had COWs deployed inside the Las Vegas Speedway (5 for Verizon, AT&T had a ""Super COW"", which has 22 antenna sectors on it, and Sprint had 3), T-Mobile had 1 COW outside the speedway, and the cell site on the speedway. These were no where near enough to handle the traffic that shows of this size produce. Also considering Las Vegas, and southern California are big markets for T-Mobile, a lot of the attending population has T-Mobile.   Verizon even published a news update about their network at EDC: http://www.verizonwireless.com/news/article/2015/06/music-fans-hit-high-note-of-data-usage-at-las-vegas-electric-daisy-carnival.html   After having access to at least 1 phone on all 4 networks, I can say that the other 3 networks held up reasonably well, texting and low bandwidth apps (iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook Chat, etc) all worked without any real issues. T-Mobile's network buckled under the strain, and sent a very large majority of them into No Service because the tower simply couldn't handle any more connections.   Insomniac Productions and Pasquale Rotella both publicly confirmed, that at the peak of each night, there were over 165,000 people inside the Las Vegas Speedway, considering the research I've done on the population of T-Mobile users, it's estimated that about 23-24% of the attending population has T-Mobile, so that means at the peak of each night, that poor cell site was trying to manage just about 40,000 phones."
tmobile,3ccoer,DoctorSteve,4,Mon Jul 6 23:04:05 2015 UTC,T-Mobile does need to get on that. They're always lacking for deployment in arenas and the like. And Casinos!
tmobile,3ccoer,Cjaiceman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:43:02 2015 UTC,"I never really had any issues inside the casinos, other than the Linq, but they don't have a DAS, and all the carriers have a dead zone in there. Luckily Wi-Fi calling worked great on their network once you got through the authentication page, and it's free Wi-Fi, so it was good enough I didn't drop calls going through there while all my friends would drop as soon as you stepped foot inside the casino/lobby area.   All the other hotels on the strip I went in had great service inside, and while the network was pretty loaded most of the time, it never felt sluggish or congested."
tmobile,3ccoer,DoctorSteve,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:31:36 2015 UTC,Atlantic City over here. Not much LTE in the rural New Jersey area last Summer (it picked up in AC to solid speeds) but there was no building penetration. And there should be.
tmobile,3ccoer,Cjaiceman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:36:51 2015 UTC,"That could be the combination of a few things, depending on if the casino has a DAS in it or not, and if T-Mobile is on that DAS, etc... The other part is, depending on when you were there, they may not have had Band 12 700 MHz up yet, and if your phone doesn't support Band 12, you wouldn't have seen it then. It does look like it's up and running now, and if you have a Band 12 phone, you should see better indoor coverage. Las Vegas doesn't have any 700 MHz spectrum, so they are using DAS's to cover casinos, and small cells outside to cover the gaps on the strip.   AWS doesn't penetrate buildings well at all, it's good for already having your signal inside a building, but the Band 12 signal should have a much better chance of getting through the thick exterior walls."
tmobile,3cdcf0,TheAsios,3,Tue Jul 7 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"Doubt t-mobile will update it. If you can, flash one of the international roms. Lollipop is much better than kitkat on S4."

tmobile,3ccvny,Nerdballer2,0,Mon Jul 6 22:51:43 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile's story to the FCC regarding the 600 auction is 'we don't have low band spectrum.  Please reserve enough so we can compete.'  Making a deal on all the available 700a doesn't help make their case, at least in the short term.  I would suspect there are two strategies for the 700a:   Wait until the 600 rules are out and go big for what they can get during the auction.  Don't tie up cash on the 700a or complicate the underdog position with the FCC before/during the auction. Once they have what they need with the 600, go back and target the 700a at a lower price.  Because of the 600 winnings they have less need so they are in the drivers seat.  Continuum, AB, and Cavalier can't hold on to it forever and stand to loose their investment eventually.  T-Mobile is the only carrier who makes sense for the 700a and they pick it up for steal. Furiously roll out the 700a while waiting for the 600 to clear.   The second strategy is a contingency strategy if the 600 auction goes bad.   if they can't secure the needed 600 t-Mobile goes all out on the 700a.  Probably pay top dollar as they would be completely desperate."
tmobile,3ccvny,bordelais,3,Tue Jul 7 01:22:55 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile will buy every drop of 700a that it can. Now, later, doesnt matter. They know that 6Mhz is not enough, and it wouldnt make an impact on the 600MHz auction at all. Plus... 600 Auction is Q1 2016, but it wont be deployed for a year and a half at best. T-Mobile can not afford to wait 2 years with the growth they have going on. They need to do something NOW, and the answer is to buy up as much 700 as they can."
tmobile,3ccvny,Logvin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:39:47 2015 UTC,It would certainly be nice if they bought everything as soon as possible and continued the aggressive rollout efforts.  Any speculation on who they buy out first?  And what areas they target for deployment?

I won't be at work for a while so I can't get you the number but there's a specific department you have to call which is opened mon-fri 9-5p pacific time if I remember correctly.

If he's on a plan with a data allotment, then if he goes over that the speeds will be to slow for non-buffered video.  If he's on an unlimited plan then things are different, and that's the only place where ""lowered priority"" comes into play. If he goes above a certain amount of data (I think it's 23gb), and also his phone is connecting to a tower that has a ton of traffic, then he might not be able to watch video.  From your description it doesn't really matter though, because no one else has a plan that would cover 23gb of data for a remotely reasonable cost, and you would not want to put him on a plan where going over his data racked up charges (whereas no matter what he does with tmobile he can't get extra charges for using to much data)."
tmobile,3cb2nc,RedPill115,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"You mentioned an allotment, do you mean that you've got a soft-capped plan?  If you want to be proactive about minimizing your data usage, you might manually set the video quality to 480p. It'll still look decent and it'll use less data than full HD."
tmobile,3cb2nc,zakats,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, we have a soft cap. I actually want to reduce that cap if the de-prioritized speeds prove to be usable for my brother. Unfortunately though, I'm not with him to ensure videos are streamed at standard definition and I can't explain to him that he should do it himself.   Edit: I wish YouTube's mobile interface or native apps allowed you to globally set videos to SD. that would solve this problem."
tmobile,3cb2nc,zakats,3,Mon Jul 6 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"Soft cap (tiered data) plans don't get deprioritized though, that only applies to those on the unlimited data plan.  It seemed to me that once you set your app to a certain setting, it stayed at that setting unless the resolution weren't available- in which case, it defaults to the nearest setting available. I could be wrong but it's worked that way for me.  Edit: did you mean to use the word 'throttled' as in the case of running out of your data allotment and then being stuck on the slower, constant speed? If that's the case, you'll be stuck on unusable speeds for video."
tmobile,3cb2nc,Marshall_St,3,Mon Jul 6 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"You're right, I did mean ""throttled."" Thanks for the correction.   I'll have to play with the settings on my brother's iPad to see if I can get it to stream SD consistently."

Also, my statement was based on my experience with Android so I'm not as confident pertaining to ios apps. Also, upon googling, I'm not finding evidence to support my claim though I'm also not finding any recent evidence to refute it either. Give it a try, I hope it works out.   While this is by far not an ideal solution, you might try dropping down to 3g mode to reduce your device speeds. If it gave you a reliable, slower speed of around 1-4mbps, the YouTube app would automatically reduce the quality. Again this isn't likely to be the most reliable or ideal solution, rather it's likely to be a very crappy solution, but there's a chance that it would work well much of the time."
tmobile,3cb2nc,mitten_mike,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:05:20 2015 UTC,"wow. T-Mobilers laughed at Sprint when they wanted to impose a 600kbps video streaming cap, and now here we are, talking about limiting our own video streaming quality, ironically to 480p, which is about 600kbps."

An automatic default to something like 4-6mbps that can be changed at the user's will would be fine. Or tower load-dependent video throttling (which could be disabled by the user) would be plenty fair IMO.   I get your point and agree but I was never against Sprint for the idea...

tmobile,3cb2nc,Domini384,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:08:43 2015 UTC,I liked what they did with Boost where you can limit the quality of video streaming to either save data or improve video quality. That's a great idea for limited data buckets.

tmobile,3cb817,dmplus,3,Mon Jul 6 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"Hspda is often as fast as LTE.  No HSPDA? Also, the 5 is a great phone but reception is not one of its strenghts."
tmobile,3cb817,dmplus,2,Mon Jul 6 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"Just Edge, and unacceptable Edge at that."
tmobile,3cb817,dsulli37,2,Mon Jul 6 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"No band 12 yet, but it depends on what they are doing with your tower.  If they are just going to do EDGE to LTE pcs conversion it will be done as soon as centurylink gets backhaul to the site.  If they plan on deploying band 12 on your tower you'd likely get the full suite (Bands 4 and 12 LTE, Band(s) 4 (and/or 2) HSPA, and EDGE on 1900)"
tmobile,3cb817,dsulli37,2,Mon Jul 6 17:01:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, fantastic information.    Clearly someone somewhere knows what the current plans are for each tower.  It'd be great to know if they are currently waiting on the backhaul, no plans, etc.  I realize they keep this close to their chest, but who doesn't like data?"
tmobile,3cbxnh,Lazurixx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"You could be connecting to a DAS or booster rather than the tower itself. This is a shot in the dark guess and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Honestly, I'm not sure this would even be legal. Edit: this is assuming that the DAS/booster is allowing voice/text service but no data.  You might try forcing your phone to connect to a different tower, if possible."
tmobile,3cbxnh,zakats,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:08:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, ill see what I can do, maybe restrict the type of connection to (back down to 2g) another signal type and see if I can get anything."

tmobile,3ccisi,jesslynh,7,Mon Jul 6 21:08:21 2015 UTC,I deal with shipping and shipping things safely a lot in my line of work and unfortunately it's 100% the shippers fault if something arrives damaged. It is very cheap to buy one-off shipping insurance to prevent this sort of thing.
tmobile,3ccisi,turn-down-for-what,4,Mon Jul 6 21:13:27 2015 UTC,"Their label actually had ""No Special Services!"" (exclamation point included) in bold, all caps at the top so that it was sure to be noticed.  I kept a copy."
tmobile,3ccisi,turn-down-for-what,6,Mon Jul 6 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"Huh. I haven't seen that before. I'm assuming it meant no ASR, DDO, etc. It's a bummer that happened but it sounds like your best option is the $175 to make it go away. I wouldn't blame T-Mo for the damage.  For future shipping reference:   Wrap your phone in bubble wrap. Place bubble-wrapped phone in box with packing peanuts for filler. Place box inside of another, slightly larger box and fill any empty space with packing paper. Wrap the entire box on all sides and corners with tape. Preferably gum tape but packing tape works too. Get third-party insurance. You can get insurance regardless of who generated the label. Ship and Insure is great for one-off shipments. BONUS: If you're extra paranoid, have a friend film you turning the phone on and proving it works, then safely packing the phone and applying the label to the top all in one continuous shot. This will help your case should you have to make an insurance claim. Also great advice for eBay sales.   Edit: I just realized Ship and Insure only insures rare and collectible items. Regardless, there are plenty of third-party private insurers out there."

I have two phones back to T-Mobile and with the horror stories i've read I wanted to, but nobody seems to be able to do it. Is it something I can force, or are they all telling me a bunch of BS?"
tmobile,3ccisi,turn-down-for-what,3,Mon Jul 6 23:07:56 2015 UTC,"It's very possible (and likely, even) that you can't add a carrier's own insurance to a pre-paid label as it's.. already pre-paid, haha.

If they didn't, it's their loss.  Try speaking to supervisors in CS, and if that doesn't go anywhere, try contacting T-Force on Twitter (I think it's @TMobileHelp)."

If T-Mobile shipped you a phone and it arrived damaged you'd expect them to eat the cost and send a new one.  Same with you
tmobile,3ccisi,rodalorn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:57:41 2015 UTC,"T-Mo came thru in the end.  I took the offer to pay the insurance deductible and was advised it would be on my account w/in 48 hours.  After receiving a letter from the insurance company saying my 'claim' had been suspended (WTH?), I tweeted T-Force again.    That agent apologized for even more confusion and wiped the entire EIP cost off my account.    As mad as I got thru this whole process, I can honestly say they tried to help me and in the end gave great CS."
tmobile,3ccisi,Logvin,0,Tue Jul 14 17:03:31 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what I should have done, I followed their instructions.  This situation has turned me into 'that guy'.  I'm taking it to court.

tmobile,3ccisi,atyppo,5,Mon Jul 6 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"First of all if your taking them to court, what proof would you have that your phone is pristine? That is your ENTIRE case."
tmobile,3ccisi,Logvin,3,Mon Jul 6 21:51:31 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that if the package was damaged when received damaged device fees are not charged.  The sender is responsible for securely packaging a device to ensure that it does not get damaged.  In every case I recommend packing the phone in the original box and then placing the box into the provided envelope before sending it back.

tmobile,3ccisi,CrUz_clan,0,Tue Jul 7 08:59:13 2015 UTC,"I don't feel that T-Mo owes me anything and I did speak to T-Force.  I actually spoke to a supervisor in CS that told me not to worry about the charges and to take the phone into the store on future jumps--I couldn't do that this time because the phone I wanted was only available online. Unfortunately, what he told me on and what he noted in my account were 2 different things so I'm back where I started.  Bleh--with hubby looking over my shoulder, we've decided that life is too short and that I've wasted too much time on when I could out enjoying anything but conflict.  I've spent hours on the phone and too much time dealing w this online.  I'll take the $175 hit, but I'll never look at T-Mobile the same.  I won't be the one posting my great speeds or good plan to my buddies anymore, and goodness knows I won't be initiating any more accounts for my company but I'm sure they could care less."
tmobile,3ccfgc,longeystyleRX,6,Mon Jul 6 20:44:21 2015 UTC,I don't believe so. T-Mobile checks the IMEI of devices to verify if they're phones or hotspots/tablets. So you wouldn't be able to use the unlimited data of a phone plan in a hotspot.
tmobile,3ccfgc,oquinones87,4,Mon Jul 6 20:52:17 2015 UTC,"We check the TAC code of the device, not the IMEI, but close enough :)"
tmobile,3ccfgc,Logvin,3,Tue Jul 7 02:40:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. ;-)
tmobile,3ccfgc,oquinones87,3,Tue Jul 7 03:05:29 2015 UTC,Will not work. T-Mobile will not the IMEI of the hotspot as not being a phone and prevent it from being used. If they didn't do this those with unlimited data on their phone would use their hotspot for all their internet. Just imagine the effects on T-Mobile's network if that were to be allowed.
tmobile,3ccfgc,cheezenub,2,Mon Jul 6 21:50:32 2015 UTC,Does OP mean hotspot as in a mifi? And if so does this also apply to the prepaid plan? I believe i was told you could use a prepaid sim card and it would work in a mifi for the data.

tmobile,3c9s7o,purplemountain01,23,Mon Jul 6 06:58:30 2015 UTC,"This is a fan sub, not an official sub. We can't really do anything about misleading coverage claims.  I want to stress that T-Mobile offers a test drive to test coverage. You should never rely on coverage maps from any carrier.  As Krispy pointed out, I also thought it was Band 12 coverage.

The map says Band 4, which the iPhone supports. They shouldn't claim coverage there then if you can't even get a signal outside in a ""Satisfactory"" area."
tmobile,3c9s7o,zakats,6,Mon Jul 6 05:55:00 2015 UTC,"I found some 700A rolled out nearby. I'm not sure if this is enough to dismiss the map as having poor mechanics but it's enough to make me want to ask if OP knows anyone with a confirmed band 12 device for their experiences.  Also, there's always BestBuy's LG Leon sale and Walmart's Alcatel Astro that sells for $65 if OP were willing to go out on a short limb. I say short limb because both stores have good return policies."
tmobile,3c9s7o,FR4NOx,2,Mon Jul 6 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"It's rolled out in California but it doesn't look like they've done much (yet) in Nevada. I just googled ""band 12 T-Mobile in Carson City NV"" and the first result was T-Mobile support forums where someone with a Galaxy Avant complaining about 2G data in parts of town and another user complaining about generally poor service in zip code 89706. And these posts were from June 2015.  It just seems like T-Mobile sucks in Carson City. And there is no Band 12. Sad reality."

tmobile,3c9s7o,kevinyeaux,5,Mon Jul 6 11:26:05 2015 UTC,"An outage seems to make sense because there is plenty of confirmed signal and coverage, perhaps it's an issue with the specific location within the city."
tmobile,3c9s7o,mitten_mike,3,Mon Jul 6 07:27:43 2015 UTC,"Is this just in the specific area around that screenshot, or are you having no service all over the city?  Looking at both our map and Sensorly, it looks like that area is a bit of a dead zone. T-Mobile's map lists it as ""satisfactory connectivity in some homes,"" which means you'll likely have issues indoors, and possibly outdoors depending on large buildings and obstacles."
tmobile,3c9s7o,krispykracker1,2,Mon Jul 6 07:34:16 2015 UTC,essentially there is no coverage west of 580 on any of those major roads shown or any area surrounding those roads. (mid to north/west Carson City)

If there is no prompt and just says 4G LTE and talks about HD voice etc then it's a band 4 area."
tmobile,3c9s7o,FR4NOx,5,Mon Jul 6 06:21:13 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile coverage maps are never always accurate, and most of SGT's sightings are in urban areas, not rural areas, meaning it does not have all of them.  For a coverage map to say you'll have 4G and you get nothing at all means there's a disconnect somewhere. Lack of a band 12 phone is the disconnect."
tmobile,3c9s7o,_FluX23,2,Mon Jul 6 06:38:18 2015 UTC,For the coverage map to say 4G and to get nothing at all is simply called an inaccurate map. It happens. Just because T-Mobile owns the spectrum does not mean they've automatically deployed 700A. There's no evidence of Band 12 in or around Carson City.
tmobile,3c9s7o,FR4NOx,2,Mon Jul 6 07:10:27 2015 UTC,"Dang, thanks for the tip. I wonder if that would actually make a difference.

It's more than enough for authorizations, assuming that it'll use the same amount of data as it would on dial up.   The problem is that you'd need to use something like a Square card reader attached to your phone to make proper use of this solution. Tethering stops when you run out of high speed data unless you're on an unlimited plan."

Connect it to your credit card machine using ethernet. Pay for a separate SIM line and a mobile internet plan. If you have a voice line, adding a 1GB/mo mobile internet plan is only $10/mo. It will be much better in the long run and will be fully supported by T-Mobile."

tmobile,3cbt96,T3hUb3rK1tten,2,Thu Jul 9 22:51:33 2015 UTC,"Sure! I don't have all the information about your business but I assume it's a brick and mortar store with a POS and separate card terminal. I also assume the card terminal is not a smartphone version like Square.   Phones are not designed for permanent hotspot installations. They lack security features like firewalls, and are not guaranteed for stability over a long period of time. You talk about using the phone to receive calls which adds even more complication into the mix. Who will fix it when things break because it's a ""smart""phone? Could you afford to lose the ability to accept credit cards for an hour because your phone decided it needed to update? What if the phone gets malware, which can happen if people are using it? Will you train employees to open up the phone and fiddle with settings when things don't work? If so, there are security implications to untrained personnel fiddling with network equipment for PCI. You would likely be in violation of PCI DSS requirements, see page 14 of this document. For one thing, using the phone for WiFi means you don't have a proper firewall or proper segmentation of networks. WiFi leaves you vulnerable to all sorts of attacks. Normally WiFi used for PCI is using special hardware that protects from it. Phones don't provide that. I could sit outside your shop with a laptop, send some packets that cause your phone to crash, and then set up my own AP that the terminal connects to. The cost of a ""travel"" router w/ Ethernet + usb LTE stick can easily be <$100. That's cheaper than most phones. Like I said, a mobile internet plan is only $10/mo for 1GB if you have a voice line on T-Mobile, and I'm pretty sure that would be plenty of data. Then you can use the phone as your business phone or whatever you want.   I'm not saying it won't work to tether it off a phone, support is right, they can do it. It's just not a good idea for a business."

Plus, you would use very little data. Many places use T-Mobile as a backup/failover situation. T-Mobile is very friendly to 3rd party OEM's due to the low requirements for non-branded hardware."

tmobile,3cbmt0,entropism,3,Mon Jul 6 17:54:02 2015 UTC,Nope. I'd keep searching. Doesn't have any tmobile lte bands. It says it supports sprint but doesn't even have all any of the sprint bands.  Looks a little sketchy too.
tmobile,3cbmt0,TheElement115,4,Mon Jul 6 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"Well,  B3/B7/B20 is going to have ZERO support in the U.S.   It does however support UMTS BC I, II, and VII.  So in areas with U1900 deployed, it will function on that layer.  And it also supports quad-band GSM, so GSM will function.  So it will function on T-Mobile (not at all on Sprint as you said), just not on LTE in any fashion."

The Samsung Galaxy Avant is also a good option [for people who can tolerate Samsung's Touchwiz BS] at $150 in your local Walmart as well.  /u/Bemo98 should consider these as more optimal solutions to their needs."

tmobile,3c76v4,mrshoppingcart,22,Sun Jul 5 17:06:21 2015 UTC,I'm wondering how much of this LTE will be inaccessible to me because of Band 12. But kudos to T-Mobile for expansion. We've come a long way.
tmobile,3c76v4,Interdimension,3,Sun Jul 5 15:55:21 2015 UTC,"Pardon my ignorance, but why would it be inaccessible because of band 12?"
tmobile,3c76v4,Jespy,9,Sun Jul 5 23:05:35 2015 UTC,/u/interdimension probably doesn't have a compatible phone.
tmobile,3c76v4,evan1123,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:21:11 2015 UTC,All band 12 is being deployed along with band4/2 so that shouldn't be an issue.
tmobile,3c76v4,TheElement115,4,Mon Jul 6 00:48:52 2015 UTC,"Have we seen proof of that though? For all we know, new native expansion will be band 12 only for now.  Even if they do deploy band 2/4 alongside 12 with the new expansion, the towers are likely going to be spaced for band 12 as a cost saving measure."
tmobile,3c76v4,evan1123,2,Mon Jul 6 00:56:37 2015 UTC,/u/icepick_ said for now all expansions are paired with 4/2  especially since 12 doesn't currently have the compacity it needs for larger cities.
tmobile,3c76v4,TheElement115,4,Mon Jul 6 01:10:14 2015 UTC,Except that band 4/2 will propagate about half as far as band 12........
tmobile,3c76v4,stevehobbes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"It might be too far for high band to reach, however."
tmobile,3c76v4,atyppo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:43:57 2015 UTC,Midband* and since  density in cities is relatively high they already overlap so it won't really matter.
tmobile,3c76v4,TheElement115,4,Mon Jul 6 03:12:53 2015 UTC,"The whole point of using 700a block to expand is so they don't have to build as many towers initially to provide coverage. They will likely space everything for band 12 coverage initially, which will lead to gaps in midband deployment. Only when they start seeing the need for extra capacity in these new markets will they increase density to improve midband coverage."
tmobile,3c76v4,evan1123,4,Mon Jul 6 05:49:25 2015 UTC,"If they deploy on band 4/2 simultaneously, that actually reduces some of the load on the 700a sectors since band 4/2 can handle any traffic closest to the tower itself..."
tmobile,3c76v4,reuthermonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:19:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely, but midband will likely have gaps due to spacing.  Capacity is not the issue, coverage for people without band 12 phones is."
tmobile,3c76v4,evan1123,2,Mon Jul 6 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I feel like maybe some travelling coverage will be reduced but as far as staying it one city, Itll probably remain usable. The city Im gonna be in with band 12 is Missoula, a relatively large city, so I hope I get decent service with mid band."
tmobile,3c76v4,TheElement115,3,Mon Jul 6 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"Personal example: I live in Mississippi. All that coverage on these LTE expansion maps in Mississippi are for bands 2/4 only because currently all the available 700Mhz spectrum is already licensed & taken up in the state. So unless our regional CDMA carrier decides to sell/share some of that, Mississippi will not see T-Mobile band 12 coverage.  http://www.spectrumgateway.com/t-mobile-700a-spectrum  The problem? Being in a somewhat rural area, bands 2/4 just were not cutting it for me. Despite the maps showing solid LTE coverage in my area with no break in coverage for miles upon miles around, I was getting constant dropped signal, constant LTE handoffs, and virtually no indoor LTE coverage because of bands 2/4 being on such high frequencies(less penetration). Legacy bands weren't doing so hot either.  I had to reluctantly go back to Verizon. Maybe some day in the future when the 600Mhz auction plays out and that spectrum gets used... Maybe I can try T-Mobile again."
tmobile,3c76v4,meatwad75892,2,Mon Jul 6 19:11:09 2015 UTC,Depending on where you live you may not be able to access band 12 anyway considering T-Mobile will likely never be able to obtain enough band 12 for a nationwide footprint. which is why they're fighting so hard for rule changes to the 600mhz auction.
tmobile,3c76v4,MastarPete,15,Mon Jul 6 12:10:57 2015 UTC,I wish Maine would get an upgrade. It does not change in any significant way between both pictures.
tmobile,3c76v4,silenthatch,6,Sun Jul 5 16:26:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, we've got it better than Montana, Iowa, and West Virginia. That's gotta be something right?   The fastest way to get coverage fixed would be to have T-Mobile get a good roaming agreement with U.S. Cellular. Something along the lines of what they have with iWireless. So roam like home can happen, coupled with an LTE roaming agreement, things would be just fine. But knowing AT&T, they have their agreement written as such that they'll always have best rates, and since the GSM network was built essentially for them, it will be a long time coming."
tmobile,3c76v4,nauticalfiesta,3,Sun Jul 5 19:01:42 2015 UTC,"No one lives out there anyhow... /s   Yes, I know, I just get excited every time I see updates or plans like this."
tmobile,3c76v4,silenthatch,3,Sun Jul 5 20:12:32 2015 UTC,T-Mobile has great coverage in Iowa. They simply let i-wireless manage it for them.
tmobile,3c76v4,reuthermonkey,2,Mon Jul 6 12:22:04 2015 UTC,That's my point. There's little native coverage there.
tmobile,3c76v4,nauticalfiesta,2,Mon Jul 6 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, the only issue in Iowa is that iWireless is almost entirely 2G with spotty 3G. But their rural build is seriously impressive, for a mid-band carrier."
tmobile,3c76v4,kevinyeaux,4,Mon Jul 6 16:39:04 2015 UTC,Seems like the problem in Maine is that they have little native coverage there to begin with.
tmobile,3c76v4,GinDaHood,6,Sun Jul 5 18:23:39 2015 UTC,We just need to figure out how to put towers on trees. We have many trees.
tmobile,3c76v4,silenthatch,9,Sun Jul 5 18:25:25 2015 UTC,That or low-band spectrum. Too bad US Cellular owns 700 Mhz A block in Maine.
tmobile,3c76v4,GinDaHood,4,Sun Jul 5 18:28:07 2015 UTC,They need an LTE roaming agreement with them if not a merger.
tmobile,3c76v4,memtiger,3,Mon Jul 6 01:30:53 2015 UTC,What's the alternative to that... building all new towers in different spectrum?
tmobile,3c76v4,silenthatch,6,Sun Jul 5 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"The 600 MHz auction is probably the best bet. Assuming T-Mobile does have mid-band spectrum in Maine, it's still not cost effective to build towers at the density needed."
tmobile,3c76v4,GinDaHood,2,Sun Jul 5 18:45:29 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Thanks for the explanation.
tmobile,3c76v4,silenthatch,4,Sun Jul 5 18:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah and with Maine's terrain, that becomes expensive very quickly using AWS and PCS."

tmobile,3c76v4,silenthatch,3,Sun Jul 5 18:55:16 2015 UTC,Is this not possible for some reason?
tmobile,3c76v4,Boron17,2,Mon Jul 6 01:23:56 2015 UTC,It's more about the undulating terrain that makes it difficult since you have to go higher to transmit farther.. and then there's the issue of getting power to where you need it.    Though I have no idea if towers on trees would even work.  I want to believe!!
tmobile,3c76v4,silenthatch,2,Mon Jul 6 01:58:45 2015 UTC,This would be a great solution for uppity neighborhoods that are pro service and anti towers if it is possible

There are 3 counties in the Upper Peninsula that T-Mobile only owns 5 MHz of spectrum in, and it looks like they're all supposed to get LTE(in some parts of those counties) by the end of this year. They could run a single 5 MHz LTE carrier and kick voice calls to roaming(like Verizon in Alaska), but somehow I don't see that happening. I don't see this whole thing all happening by the end of this year."
tmobile,3c76v4,blaziecat1103,4,Mon Jul 6 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"I would think that 3 sparsely populated counties should be ok with a single 5mhz channel.

tmobile,3c76v4,zakats,4,Mon Jul 6 05:19:38 2015 UTC,me thinks they just took their current (at the time) coverage map and overlayed a map of all the 700mhz spectrum they bought.

tmobile,3c76v4,xi_mezmerize_ix,3,Mon Jul 6 00:18:43 2015 UTC,"Uh, yeah they have. It's called low band spectrum. Which they're deploying in all areas where they have the licenses for. It's largely what this expansion will consist of."
tmobile,3c76v4,areallytallguy,4,Mon Jul 6 02:24:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to pretend like understand all of this radio stuff, but I currently have AT&T and I can hardly get a signal inside grocery stores. If I can connect at all in the one near me, it's unusable. Isn't AT&T running on prime low band spectrum?"
tmobile,3c76v4,CommitteeOfTheHole,5,Mon Jul 6 02:56:59 2015 UTC,"Some grocery stores are built with a ton of metal. This makes it extremely difficult for radio waves to penetrate it, regardless of it's low or high band spectrum."

tmobile,3c76v4,600mhz,3,Mon Jul 6 09:02:37 2015 UTC,there's 0 coverage right now up north. it would be nothing short of a miracle if they were able to add dozens of completely new sites all the way up to and into the UP in the next 5 months.
tmobile,3c76v4,mitten_mike,5,Mon Jul 6 14:03:04 2015 UTC,I'm still trying to figure out why they have Kent island and Eastern Shore Maryland listed as LTE but you only get edge when there.
tmobile,3c76v4,crazifyngers,3,Mon Jul 6 12:27:59 2015 UTC,seriously.  as soon as i cross that bridge i only have hspa.  then less than a mile in i am on edge.
tmobile,3c76v4,m1kehuntertz,4,Mon Jul 6 21:09:17 2015 UTC,Tmo's coverage maps mean nothing.
tmobile,3c76v4,rekirk82,8,Mon Jul 6 13:50:12 2015 UTC,Sure will be nice to get rid of all the Edge networks surrounding my new house... I'm fighting for signal between Edge and LTE all the time... If they can't get it fixed then I might have to go to VZ because my neighbor has excellent service.. 😕
tmobile,3c76v4,m1kehuntertz,2,Sun Jul 5 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"Don't get your hopes up. Most of the areas around me that were Edge a year ago are now LTE but the speeds still average 0.03Mbps (or completely unusable). The coverage maps have listed these areas as ""Excellent LTE Coverage"" for at least 3 years. AT&T and Verizon have had 4Mbps (40Mbps+ now) in all of these places since 2008. These ""coverage maps"" (which are and always have been outright lies) makes it impossible to go anywhere new and expect to get any work done. I fully understand that building out a network takes time but tmo needs to stop with their coverage inaccuracies and lies."

tmobile,3c76v4,Thundertime88,9,Sun Jul 5 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"The maps are correct. John and his staff showed both of these maps when they went to DT investor meeting earlier in the year in Germany. But I think tmobile needs to buy ab lisencse co, cavalier,  and C700. Which are all squatters on 700mhz a block spectrum. To make sure that coverage is more reliable in rural areas and in the city's. it would also help tmobile cover more ground than 1.6 million Sq miles if they buy out the squatters. If they can get the spectrum without over paying too much.   EDIT: tmobile could buy/ trade license with cspire wireless 700mhz b block which is 7 license that have build out deadlines of 12/13/16. these license cover areas in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee. then they also buy out Ab license co, C700, and Cavalier. so they could serve more rural areas and give more choice. then go buy 5x5 to 10x10 600mhz nationwide spectrum in the 600mhz auction."

tmobile,3c76v4,whitetigergrowl,2,Mon Jul 6 18:57:31 2015 UTC,They still have a lot of ground to cover in the Dakotas if they plan on meeting this and that much coverage in those states as their year end goal. Zero expansion that I have seen has started to take place in them yet.   It's still possible to pull it off. But I dunno. I'm kinda having my doubts. I think some of this will be pushed into summer 2016. Could be wrong though.   And I know some have said about how fast they have been moving. But when expanding into new and not existing territories the rules change.   We will see I guess.
tmobile,3c76v4,mrshoppingcart,2,Mon Jul 6 00:28:18 2015 UTC,"It probably takes time to achieve licenses on the tower per tower basis. Maybe in Q4 they will it off, a lot of this expansion is happening in the second half of the year."
tmobile,3c76v4,whitetigergrowl,3,Mon Jul 6 01:51:50 2015 UTC,Maybe. But I have some doubts it (the network expansion) will be pulled off like the map shows with the time left. They are still trying to expand their current LTE footprint and convert Edge areas to LTE. Plus that is a lot of area to try and cover.  Heck their online map they said would be updated every 2 weeks with real time data...yeah that has been far from happening.  I'll be happy if they do pull it off. But I'm having my doubts at this point. I'm guessing at least some of it will be pushed into early to mid 2016.
tmobile,3c76v4,mrshoppingcart,2,Mon Jul 6 02:50:26 2015 UTC,"Every 2 weeks, source?  That is by far false. Looks the same since the new map was introduced."
tmobile,3c76v4,whitetigergrowl,3,Mon Jul 6 02:55:30 2015 UTC,TMobile was the source. They publicly announced it back around March that every 2 weeks it would be updated with user provided info using customer cellphones and without customers having to do anything. It would measure data speeds and signal strength compared to other TMobile customers to come out to the average speeds and signal strength. As well as show any new coverage.  Google it.   The map was updated once that I have seen since it was introduced. But that's about it.
tmobile,3c76v4,mrshoppingcart,2,Mon Jul 6 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"I messaged T-Mobile on Facebook earlier today, here was their response"
tmobile,3c76v4,brontide,2,Mon Jul 6 04:06:36 2015 UTC,LTE coverage doesn't mean a lot on a device without VoLTE support presuming you still run a phone company.

Up until 6 months ago there was no T-Mobile coverage in Vermont, except for a tiny bit of 2G in the main city. Virtually nobody here considered T-Mobile an option and they largely still don't since they're all already locked in with Verizon/AT&T."
tmobile,3c76v4,GinDaHood,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:46:42 2015 UTC,"Most of T-Mobile's upgrades are improving existing covered areas to LTE. If a region doesn't have native coverage now, it's unlikely that it will improve in the near future.  As to why there's no native coverage there to begin with, it has to do with the nature of T-Mobile's spectrum assets and cost-effectiveness of building sites in sparsely populated areas."

tmobile,3c76v4,nk1,15,Sun Jul 5 17:46:34 2015 UTC,There's no point in using a now obsolete technology like HSPA. LTE is way more efficient with resources. You're gonna have to use LTE whether you like it or not.

tmobile,3c76v4,areallytallguy,3,Mon Jul 6 01:42:48 2015 UTC,Except LTE is actually more battery efficient now. Faster data = less time the CPU has to stay ramped up and can return to idle quicker. LTE modems now use way less power than the older ones did.

In places like Houston and a Cleveland where populations are dense and/or limited on spectrum, LTE makes a huge difference given its higher speeds and larger capacities before bogging down.

It's never actually been deployed in the wild that way, but it is technically possible.  Also, T-Mobile is all LTE-A equipment, so they actually are 4G LTE.

tmobile,3caphz,marsrover001,8,Mon Jul 6 13:06:51 2015 UTC,That is the cost of the phone.   Minors can't enter contracts so you can't do loans or payment plans without an adult co-signer.   Also its the same price either way if you pop the money up front or pay 20-30 a month in payments.    if you have postpaid now you must have a Parrent on account with you perhaps they will let your do payments..
tmobile,3caphz,say592,2,Mon Jul 6 13:11:51 2015 UTC,Well shit. My mom is probably going to say no lol
tmobile,3caphz,Smartinie,3,Mon Jul 6 13:12:34 2015 UTC,"That is the whole cost of the phone. You can't do monthly payments as a minor. Either save for a year and start, or save for a year and pay it all."
tmobile,3caphz,misteryub,2,Mon Jul 6 13:12:57 2015 UTC,"Prepaid is when you pay your bill before service begins. So, you would pay your August bill by the end of July, and your September bill before the end of August.   Postpaid is the opposite. You use the service, and they bill you at the end of the month. This is essentially extending you credit for that month of service, which they cant do since you arent old enough to enter into such an agreement. In the same example as above, they would bill you at the end of July for your July service, and at the end of August for your August service.   Prepaid requires payments up front for everything. Service, phone, everything. Postpaid will allow you to be billed later for things, like device payment plans, Jump on Demand, etc."
tmobile,3caphz,arpstorm,2,Mon Jul 6 13:06:02 2015 UTC,Buy a used (unlocked) phone and sign up for a prepaid plan. That's your best (and cheapest) option in my opinion.
tmobile,3caphz,misteryub,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:50:21 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that you are looking to stay on your parent's plan on T-Mobile?   If so, you will not be able to. However, what you can do, is have your mom go and buy the Note 4 on EIP (Equipment Installment Plan), for the $29.16+tax/month. Then you can just give her the $30 bucks or whatever each month for the phone.  You, as a minor, aren't allowed to enter into contracts, the EIP. You, as not an authorized user, aren't allowed to make changes to the account, and as you are a minor, you can't become one. You are allowed to buy the phone for full price, but the store might not sell it to you not attached to an account (someone correct me on this if I'm wrong)."
tmobile,3caphz,misteryub,2,Mon Jul 6 13:36:09 2015 UTC,Can I put it on my credit card?
tmobile,3caphz,misteryub,2,Mon Jul 6 14:07:18 2015 UTC,"You can, but it's the most expensive way to buy it.  Assuming an 18% interest rate you'll end up paying $200 - $300 in interest on that phone if you buy it with a credit card and just make the minimum monthly payments.    I can't speak for you, but a Note 4 isn't worth $1000 to me."
tmobile,3caphz,nobody65535,2,Mon Jul 6 16:55:20 2015 UTC,Am I allowed to buy it off the Internet?
tmobile,3caphz,misteryub,2,Mon Jul 6 14:12:47 2015 UTC,"YOU can't but your MOM can. In actuality, if your mom gives you her login and you put the full $700 on your credit card, you'll be fine."
tmobile,3caphz,nobody65535,2,Mon Jul 6 14:21:26 2015 UTC,Oh well I know the login!! Hahaha
tmobile,3caphz,anothercookie90,3,Mon Jul 6 14:24:13 2015 UTC,"Well, make sure you talk to your mom first. I know my mom would be pissed if I spent $700 bucks on something on her behalf."

tmobile,3cc13z,jgangeles,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"#2. If you get the ""Truly Unlimited"" plan, and you use more than 21GB of data during your bill cycle, your device is given a lower priority on the network if the tower you are connected to is congested. You may not even notice it at all if your area is good... but most folks agree the amounts that your data is slowed to is usually pretty drastically slowed compared to non-prioritized users on the same tower. Note that this affects less than 3% of T-Mobile subscribers, as 21GB is a LOT of data for most people (network average is 2.5GB)."
tmobile,3cc13z,Logvin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"In my area where it's not all too congested, I slow down from somewhere near 30mb/s to 10ish. Its not too bad. I do definitely see a difference, but I can live with it.   Its much better than what I was seeing when the prioritization first started with speeds as low as .05 mb/s."
tmobile,3cc13z,sirithaeariel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:16:51 2015 UTC,/u/Logvin Thanks for your reply! 21gbs is a lot of data that seems tough to reach. Is that 21gbs between the both of us?

tmobile,3cc13z,CrUz_clan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:13:16 2015 UTC,Unless you plan on switching out phones before you pay off your phones don't worry about jump then it would be just an extra 20 bucks each bill

tmobile,3cb5fb,vizor004,3,Mon Jul 6 15:15:03 2015 UTC,Taxes on prepaid will vary by state.   You can get the router on prepaid for $99 but not the signal booster.   Yes wifi calling is possible and it does count against your 100 minutes.   Do you own your own business? Check out Harbor Mobile they are postpaid T-mobile plans.  Taxes and fees are a flat $3. Plans start at $33 a month for 2.5 GB  https://www.harbormobile.com/plans/  Occasionally another company called netontherun also resells T-mobile accounts. They have $45 flat for 5 GB and usually $50 back amazon after two months of service.

If taxes and 911 fees are being added on top. In that case post paid itself would be good? Just that I'll have to give up some data.  But wifi calling will be counted against unlimited talk and router can be loaned for free?  Postpaid :  80/month family plan + VA taxes + others Prepaid  :  (40+30)/month + VA taxes + 911 charges  If the difference between above is somewhere around 5$, then probably I can go for the postpaid itself to avoid the hassles of monthly renewal etc?    Can someone from VA post how much i should expect on top of monthly cost from post paid plans?"
tmobile,3cb5fb,Lixx_xy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:00:23 2015 UTC,here in PA we have 7% tax along with various other fees on postpaid service. I usually estimate about 15-20% for taxes and fees. Could be completely different in VA though.
tmobile,3cb5fb,FR4NOx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:11:45 2015 UTC,About WiFi Calling: Yes it counts against minutes. Treat it like a cell tower in your home.   Router: yes it's loaned free of charge but remember to return it if you decide to leave T-Mobile. Only free for postpaid. Prepaid can buy for $99. Still a good deal since the ASUS OEM version is $200.

tmobile,3ca0cj,tplee,2,Mon Jul 6 07:08:17 2015 UTC,"So about 6 months ago I started to notice I wasn't receiving text messages from people randomly and vice versa. It happens rarely but nowadays since this is a major way to communicate it's a big nuisance especially because I conduct business this way.    So I thought I try a clean install of lolipop to fix. Just start over. Well that didn't work and now on top of not getting the messages I now receive ghost messages when someone try to text me. Again it's not all text messages but it is very random. Some are from iPhone and some are from android phones.    I talked to tmobile already and they gave me a new Sim card and refreshed the signal but that hasn't worked.    Does someone have a solution to this problem?  I'm trying to stay with tmobile because of the price and I like what they do in terms of business decisions as a company, but I think it might be time for me to move to one of the big guys if I can't get this fixed.

If there's a tmobile store in your area, you can even do it without spending any money. Go into the store, run a speed test on your phone, then run a speed test on one of the demo phones in the store that has LTE (nearly all of them).  0.19mbps is the speed my phone gets if I force it to Edge, where with LTE I get 15mbps. Good chance that your phone isn't even working with hspa+ where you are, and is connecting to edge.  The LG Leon costs $150 from tmobile and has both LTE and band 12. I read somewhere on here you could buy it from Best Buy for $50-$80 as well, if you want something cheap.  hspa+ is an old tech that tmobile is phasing out using most places, there's a lot of places where you can only get either Edge (for backwards compatibility) or LTE, hspa+ at all."

The OP lives in the Los Angeles area and wrote:   It is so bad here I couldn't even do a speed test to post   That correlates to the new trend of drastically reduced data performance. I personally just pulled 1.7 Mbps down and 4.9Mbps up. Will moving to 20x20 help that? Yes, absolutely. Is that going to be a long-term fix? Absolutely not.  The capacity gain from that will be shortly exhausted, if the trend continues.  Six months ago, I was getting 20Mbps in the same spot. I'm thrilled T-Mobile is adding customers like crazy, but it's foolish to deny that the gains are quite costly in performance for existing users. And it's even more foolish to present a false front of ideality."

I've seen the progress that team has made, and it is awesome. I'm not at liberty to say what T-Mobile's plans are for the area, but there are large portions of LA already on 20x20.   And it's even more foolish to present a false front of ideality.   I think you read into my post a bit too much. Look at other markets, like Las Vegas and Phoenix, who do not have the spectrum to do what LA is doing.... LA is doing pretty good, it does not mean it is perfect."

tmobile,3c82n7,Logvin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:23:21 2015 UTC,Well of course resources are going to the most active area first... but residentials are not being left out. Sometimes it is harder to get backhaul to a tower in a residential area.

tmobile,3c86pk,niftydl,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"According to this: http://www.worldtimezone.com/gsm.html  France uses 800/1800/2600Mhz for 4G LTE and 900/2100 for 3G WCDMA.   For full compatibility, you need a device which can access LTE on bands 3,7 and 20. For 3G WCDMA voice/data you need band 1 and band 8.  It looks like a lot of Asia also uses LTE on 3 and 7: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LTE_networks#Asia  A lot of Android devices still do not have global network compatibility, unlike the iPhone. The closest global and T-Mobile compatible Android device currently is the Nexus 6, but the phone is huge and absolutely isn't for everyone. The Samsung Galaxy S6 seems to have a lot more networks bands as well, just not as inclusive as the Nexus."
tmobile,3c86pk,Conan_Kudo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:27:10 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Galaxy S6 series and the Nexus 6 are very similar, though the S6 supports LTE band 20 (CEPT 800) and LTE band 28 (APT 700) which are being used throughout Europe and Asia respectively. The US model of the Nexus 6 does not. The Galaxy S6 series also has the highest RF performance I've ever seen on a device."

tmobile,3c86pk,skyxsteel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:38:46 2015 UTC,"From my experience traveling overseas, honestly I would recommend the iPhone. No other phone supports a crazy amount of frequency bands like it does. Connection isn't limited to just LTE bands, but also UMTS and GSM bands. If a phone doesn't support LTE bands in a given country, it will fall back to UMTS, then GSM.   Other factors apply, if the band supports one carrier but t-mobile uses another partner that doesn't support the band, she may not get LTE.  Check this wikipedia table out. but like I said it can get convoluted and turn into needless work when the iPhone may be able to cover most major international networks.  Android devices vary greatly, but if she must have an android phone I think the Galaxy S5/S6 or Nexus 6 will do."
tmobile,3c86pk,zakats,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:22:04 2015 UTC,"As mentioned already, you need band 1 for 3G (I'm assuming this is the most ubiquitous coverage north of 2g) and bands 3, 7, and 20 for LTE.  Well, you can buy a very expensive flagship phone, a second phone for use in Europe, or you can just buy a ZTE ZMAX which has band 1 3G as well as band 7 LTE for the more dense areas where she'd need the LTE most. I think that going with the ZMAX, you get the very best value.   It's important to note that the parameters by which we judge coverage and cell technology might not lead to the same kind of experience as one would have in another country... Imagine that T-Mo had HSPA 21 or 42 everywhere outside the cities, where population densities were very low; we probably wouldn't care very much about LTE expansions since our data experience wouldn't suffer. This might not be a good example for urban France but that sort of depends on where you go and what you do.  I've owned the ZMAX and was very happy with it before handing it down; I highly recommend it. I just wish ZTE would get their act together and release the update for band 12/VoLTE."
tmobile,3c9gwl,velcro19,2,Mon Jul 6 03:27:11 2015 UTC,"Are you in a stand alone house or apartment / town house? You should manually set the WiFi channels for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks. The automatic setting almost never picks the least busy channels. If you have an Android phone, download WiFi Analyzer from the play store and see what other channels are being used around you. On 2.4 GHz the only non overlapping channels are 1,6 and 11. Find one that has the least number of other access points on it and manually switch the router to that. For 5 GHz you should try the first 5 low numbered channels. See if that helps."
tmobile,3c9gwl,niftydl,2,Mon Jul 6 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"So... it's more interfering traffic that's important than the number of SSIDs being broadcast on those channels.  So if there are active networks (traffic, not SSIDS) on 2-5 you want 11 and if there are active networks on 7-10 you want 1.  802.11 will share relatively nicely with others on the same channel, but the overlapping channels look more like random noise and cannot coordinate/cooperate."

Im with TimeWarnerCable, with their supplied router i had mine set up independently using DMZ port and setting up the CellSpot with its own network.

If your existing equipment also has router capabilities it may be conflicting i.e. if your provider gave you a modem/router all in one. What ends up happening is both the routers are assigning IPs across your network (2 routers trying to take charge at the same time, devices get confused, everything grinds to a halt like you threw a fork into a gear assembly).  In my setup I have a Surboard DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem (just a modem, no extras), and it's hooked into the cell spot router - works great. When I had DSL AT&T gave me a DSL modem/router w/ wireless G (crappy device honestly), I had to do what was listed above, turn off DHCP and NAT in my good router (and wireless in the modem), letting the AT&T router do the DHCP issuing."

tmobile,3c681j,BurstStream,16,Sun Jul 5 05:34:19 2015 UTC,Just a reminder that the 5.1 update removed band 12 support for this phone.

tmobile,3c681j,ignition386,8,Sun Jul 5 07:16:21 2015 UTC,"It's not a T-Mobile phone, so it doesn't support T-Mobile's VoLTE.  It's possible that someone could have a B12 LTE (700mhz) signal, but not the EDGE/HSPA signal (1900, 1700/2100) to make/receive calls.  Phones display the strongest signal they connect to, so someone could see that they have a signal, but it would only be for data, not talk."
tmobile,3c681j,johnmudd,5,Sun Jul 5 08:08:58 2015 UTC,But I only need data to make calls using Google Voice.

tmobile,3c84in,tentonbricks,2,Sun Jul 5 20:08:30 2015 UTC,"One well-known trick is to simply purchase any cheap Sprint-branded phone to turn as ""your current phone"" to T-Mobile for the ETF payoff promotion. That way, you can keep your current phone (the GS6 you won from John Legere).  I have no clue whether the free phones John sent out last week were unlocked or not. Perhaps someone else who already received their free phone can answer you. There were a few people who posted here to announce their jackpot.  If you truly wish to switch to T-Mobile, here's my suggestion:   Take advantage of the ETF payoff T-Mobile offers by doing what I wrote above: turn in a cheap Sprint-branded smartphone. Buy a smartphone from T-Mobile. Yes, you'll have to pay up. But hang on... Whatever phone you choose to buy, sell it. You'll preferably choose the cheapest phone from T-Mobile.   Will you end up with temporary losses? Yes. T-Mobile will cover your ETFs, and you can keep your new GS6. The losses will come from you buying the new phone from T-Mobile (required to get ETFs covered).  It's up to you. Given T-Mobile's highly competitive prices, you might end up saving money by switching. So those short-term losses might end up as long-term profits over the course of a few months.  Good luck!"
tmobile,3c84in,Interdimension,3,Sun Jul 5 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"The phone OP won was a T-Mobile phone, so OP just has to go through the process and buy the cheapest Tmo phone that they permit in the trade-in offer, then just sell that phone. Then OP can use the new phone from John Legere on T-Mobile just fine on T-Mobile's network."

tmobile,3c82q2,Archa3opt3ryx,3,Sun Jul 5 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"When you tell your T-Mobile sales representative that you wish to switch to T-Mobile, they'll handle the switching over. T-Mobile will alert AT&T and Verizon that you're switching carriers, and all parties will act accordingly to deactivate service. You won't have to do anything yourself, other than pay any ETFs you'll have afterwards (which will be billed to you from AT&T and Verizon). When you activate service with T-Mobile, they'll immediately port your numbers from your old carrier. When I switched from AT&T, I had everything working within one hour. Porting numbers is, from my experience, instantaneous. What takes time is requesting unlock codes for your phones. AT&T is usually quick with phone unlock requests (mine came within 15 minutes for four lines; I just had to pay the ETFs the same day). No comment on Verizon. Once those unlock codes are received from AT&T/Verizon, you're ready to go. Pop your T-Mobile SIMs in, and enjoy service.   When I switched from AT&T a couple months back, I was in a similar situation to you. Not as complicated, but one of my family members was in Illinois, while the rest of us were in Georgia. Tell your T-Mobile sales rep about this, and they'll get it handled.  What they did for me is activate service for three of us (in Georgia) right then and there in-store. So we walked out with service. As for the one member in Illinois, he was instructed to visit the local T-Mobile store in that area and let them know about the switch. The reps in that store handed him a SIM card and he also walked out with service that same day.  So, from my experience, the T-Mobile stores are well connected and can handle separated family members quite easily. Just let them know about your situation.  As for your questions about going overseas and military service... I don't know. But if you can somehow explain your somewhat complicated situation to the T-Mobile reps in store (as well as to AT&T), then I'm sure you can get answers.  Good luck! And welcome to Team Magenta!"
tmobile,3c82q2,Interdimension,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:07:40 2015 UTC,"Your can have the devices purchased with temporary numbers and send the phones. Once the phones arrive, you can then port the numbers over. As far as the ETF reimbursement, you can trade in the phones as point of sale. Keep in mind that you will have to submit the bill from your old carrier to get the reimbursement. Depending on when you port the numbers, you may have to submit 2 bills.  As far as the Military ETF, you would want to speak to the carrier, but I would day just do the trade in to avoid any hassle. One important note is DO NOT cancel any lines that you are transferring. The port process automatically cancels the line. You may want to follow up with the carrier the week after you port to ensure it is all canceled. If you cancel during the port process, you may lose the number altogether."
tmobile,3c82q2,BumWarrior69,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Just wanted to clarify something: the t-mobile folks at the store here said you don't have to trade in your phone, you just have to trade in a phone. We have a couple old flip-phones laying around we can use to trade in, and then we can buy a $30 flip phone from T-Mobile and just sell it on ebay. Meanwhile, we'll all keep our iPhones.  Also, what happens on AT&T's end once we port the numbers? Do they auto-cancel, or do the new T-Mobile numbers get put on our old ATT account? I ask because I want to manually cancel the ATT and verizon accounts and show them my military orders at that time, instead of having T-Mobile cancel them for me, which could get tricky."

Like I said I think the big question is whether tmobile has coverage on the roads going to and from your phone. If they do, it makes sense to switch.

Note: This post was made automatically based on some keywords in your post. If it doesn't apply to you, please carry on and have a nice day!  I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns."
tmobile,3c4b5i,anwserman,2,Sat Jul 4 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"Here's the lowdown with ETF and breaking contracts:  You pay the ETF to AT&T, and get reimbursed by T-Mobile up to the maximum allowed by the offer.  It takes about 60 days.  To qualify for the ETF reimbursement, you have to trade in any AT&T phone.  When I broke out of my ATT contract while on vacation in January 2014, I was 'supposed' to hand in my iPhone4.  After stopping and chatting with a store representative, she said go look for any phone branded by my carrier.. I wandered around San Diego looking for three hours and found an old Samsung flipphone, cracked, no battery, I paid $7 cash for.  Traded it in, got to keep my iPhone 4 and got my ETF paid for.  Long story short:  Trade in the out-of-contract phones to keep your iPhones.  As for your family member, mail the phone to them.  It's a pain, but that's what you need to do.    For delaying payment with ATT, if you're upfront about not having money, you might be able to get a CSR to put you on some sort of payment plan to pay off the ETF.  It might ding your credit, but typically it's only if you're delayed 30-60 days past due on a bill.   Just be forward, honest, and call them - they'll try to work with you.  As for the process of switching, make sure the primary account holder of the new service brings in their driver's license and probably a utility bill to prove your current address.  Back up your phones that you'll be trading in so you can restore them to their new devices.  It'll take an hour or so, but they'll get you squared away.  These offers might interest you: 4 lines/2.5GB data on each/$100, or 2 lines/Unlimited LTE data/$100 + $40 for each additional line.  (It's literally their best deal.)   You could switch your entire family over to T-Mobile, everyone has unlimited highspeed data + 7GB mobile tethering on each line for $220 total (2 lines at base $100, plus 3 lines at $40 each = $220).  Once you sign up, the price is valid for two years, and also includes all Uncarrier benefits such as unRadio, Wi-Fi calling, international data + texting, etc.  EDIT: Only trade in the minimum devices possible to qualify for the ETF reimbursement.  Assuming your iPhones are relatively recent (5 onward), they'll support the T-Mobile network.   Dump the crappiest of your three phones to pay off the ETF, and keep the best of the five."
tmobile,3c4b5i,nobody65535,2,Sat Jul 4 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"The ETF reimbursement will take any phone.  The Next financing payoff will require the exact phone that was being financed.  Since there's no ETF on 2, it might be easier to leave those alone and only deal with the 3 that are on contract first and move those after?  If you want to keep those 2 devices that are on contract (not on next) dig up 2 random phones to turn in."

tmobile,3c4xco,masterof80smetal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:36:03 2015 UTC,That's really unfortunate since if you get the phones that require a down payment you lose money if you don't stay with the whole 18 month lease before upgrading to a new phone at the same level.

Otherwise, from chatting with people on here - you should be good with bringing in a rooted phone, but I would be cautious with rooting a phone on JOD - it's a lease-to-own program, and you technically don't own the device unless you pay the final lump sum on the phone after 18 months."

You will need to have the account number, your phone number, and the billing PIN. That is the only info they needed to do the port. The only thing they checked on the trade in phones were that they powered on and had no major physical damage.   As far as rooting your leased JoD phone, it's probably a non-issue.

tmobile,3c4ztj,PhillyITguy,2,Sat Jul 4 21:21:30 2015 UTC,Making the system give the results you want.  Only LTE test then average = high average speed. Only Edge test then low average speed.
tmobile,3c4ztj,_FluX23,-2,Sat Jul 4 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"I guess this is exactly what I mean then  Since T-Mo uses Ookla as their source for claiming fastest LTE network, if the average is dragged down by low <1mbps tests, average will get dragged down fast."
tmobile,3c4ztj,feurie,8,Sat Jul 4 21:30:21 2015 UTC,"Well guess what, it means that they're not the fastest in all locations. At least they're working to change that."

tmobile,3bzrhk,_FluX23,2,Fri Jul 3 13:58:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that, it's been fairly slow going. This gap has been a very obvious, very open sore for a long time since this is a very frequently traveled area. A likely large majority of the people who live in and visit northwest Arkansas (a very popular area, university of Arkansas is there) take this route and it's about an hour of 2g.   Band 12 has been ready for deployment for 10 months and this, along with what was posted a couple days ago for Little Rock, have been the first reports of band 12 so far. I'm glad it's here, finally.   Tmo only has the license to cover about half of the span with band 12, I hope they'll buy AB's license here too.   Arkansas LTE expansions have been moving but seem to be a bit behind the rest of the country. Almost the whole state has band 12 available but not rolled out and the EOY 15 projection doesn't show much expansion- I understand, it's not a very populous state but this is important to me for when I (frequently) travel around. I tweeted about this issue to tmo a week or two ago, I wonder if someone in charge of the area noticed."
tmobile,3bzrhk,zakats,5,Fri Jul 3 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've noticed some progress on i40 between fort Smith and Oklahoma city. I drive this twice a week and the improvements are certainly welcome and I'm glad to have them, but there's still a few spots that shows 2g where I get absolutely no service at all, and a spot of no service that's on their map. I tried to make a phone call for the duration of this trip and it dropped 6 times before I gave up on it. I completely understand the impossibility of covering the whole nation in LTE but it is egregious that a major highway would have sections without any service whatsoever. It doesn't help either that the LTE to 2G fallback doesn't happen gracefully and I spend plenty of time searching for signal in areas with signal due to this inability to transition. Highway use does not necessitate 100mbps of LTE , but I do want enough to reliably search for gas stations, restaurants, use waze, and God forbid, maybe a phone call or two. The towers are there and att, Verizon,and even sprint has this much figured out.   I'm definitely happy to see these improvements but T-Mobile still has a long way to go before they can be relied upon. I say all this as a mostly happy T-Mobile convert with a new LGG4."

tmobile,3bzrhk,zakats,2,Fri Jul 3 21:37:36 2015 UTC,I have had at&t for about 12 years or so and was really intrigued by the thought of going to tmobile and getting the unlimited plan. I thought a good way to test the network would be to grab the walmart $30 plan for month and get an unlocked phone to test. I live close to Conway and its been pretty rough...mainly 2G where I live but when I get close to Conway I hit LTE. The two devices I used to test did not have Band 12 at all and was wondering if anyone else has had luck in Central Arkansas with a band 12 device?
tmobile,3bzrhk,gohogs4life,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:15 2015 UTC,"There's not a lot of b12 yet but the 2g footprint to LTE should be done by the end of the year.

You can't count on native coverage in the boonies but you'll have roaming on ATT (with limited data).  Edit: WPS"

Texting has seemed to work fine for me, but we did see tmobile have some big issues around a week ago. I used to have Verizon and I missed a few (specifically pic messages) with Verizon to.  Other carriers might do a better job, but the text messaging protocol is inherently flawed compared to what it could be. There's no verification that the message was received, or retrying once it thinks it sent it the first time. You don't know if someone got your text message, or if someone saw it.  If you really want reliable messaging, you have to use a 3rd party app, like WhatsApp or Hangouts (hangouts message though, not mms), or any of the other bazillion apps that do it.  You can find plenty of threads from other carriers having similar issues: https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/321qsz/text_messages_not_sending/ https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxys6/comments/33hio6/not_receiving_text_messages_on_s6_verizon/  Or at&t: https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/33domj/not_getting_phone_calls_and_text_messages_while/ https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/221y0t/texts_from_unknown_with_the_text_message_not_found/ https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/37k2ku/it_would_appear_att_will_censor_text_messages/    Again, tmobile has been doing a crappy job recently, and I don't want to come across as defending that. I don't know if overall they do a crappier job than other carriers. But it's also true that 3rd party apps do a far more reliable job of delivering messages than any carrier does with text messaging."
tmobile,3c17zf,Martin104921,2,Sat Jul 4 00:18:22 2015 UTC,"I realize that third party apps are more reliable, but there is no way I'm getting all the people I know to use one program. People have iPhones and droids, people have data and not, etc. It ain't gonna happen, so SMS/MMS is the only thing that (should) work across the board. Additionally, I never had any issues at all on all the years I was with Verizon. None. And I was with them for I can't even tell you how long (pre SMS, even).  The only other carrier that gave me any issues was RW, and it was more than just SMS/MMS. But this? This has probably been going on for a few days now, I just didn't notice until today, making this the biggest issue I've ever seen from any carrier. My wife on VZW for a few years now has never had a single issue in this time frame. Now, I hate VZW, which is why I left, but they worked and I was never without signal unless everyone was without signal.  Maybe it is just bad timing on my part, but after screwing around with RW for almost a year, I just want shit to work, and T-Mobile failed massively within a few weeks of switching over. This is not a good sign. If I wanted crap to not work, I'd have stuck with RW and saved $30/mo in the process."

tmobile,3c1qbb,robondes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:58:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats what I was thinking. I get the difference is that you cant just buyout the phone whenever you want, it has to be after the 18 months but it is not like I was planning to do that anyways with the regular method. I think I might go with JOD"
tmobile,3c1qbb,gg_2015,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:55:44 2015 UTC,"Yes. Iphone 6 16GB is $650. So with JoD, you are paying $27/mo for it for 18 months. Right now, with the promotion they have, you get a $12/mo discount (as a credit) for up to 18 months, assuming you don't upgrade.  So it's not $15/mo you are paying for the phone, it's $27. So that's $27 applied to the full $650 price. If you upgrade to another phone, you lose the $12/mo discount. You have to stay the full 18 months to get the benefit of the discount (which totals up to $216).  After 18 months, you'd have paid $486 towards the phone ($27x18). Once you go the full 18 months without any changes, then you have a chance to buyout your phone for $164 ($650 - $486).   Hope that clears up any questions. If you are willing to use the phone for the full 18mo, this is a heck of a deal on JoD. If not, just use the regular Jump which includes insurance."

tmobile,3c1qbb,Mastaking,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:54:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I thought the promotion was for all models of i6 and i6+. The only difference is if you don't get the 16GB model, you have to pay the down payment, which I believe is $100 or $200."

tmobile,3bzyhi,dumbelts,3,Fri Jul 3 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"ETF reimbursements: It doesn't the device you trade in, as long as it is not broken and functional.  Device Payoff (Edge, for example): You NEED to trade in the device that you want T-Mobile to payoff.   I believe your situation falls under the 2nd scenario. Unfortunately, because of that T-Mobile would not be able to help you out IF you want to participate with JUMP! On Demand. I took training and it distinctly says in the material that if a customer needs a device payoff and wants the iPhone promo, they can't. It states that the customer should pick one of the promos as both cannot be done. I'm sorry. :("
tmobile,3bzyhi,BioBlueDemon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"OK, just so that I completely understand:  A 2-year phone line (Mine, but my mom's according to Verizon) will NOT require me to turn the phone into T-Mobile.  A phone on a Verizon Edge plan (My mom, but mine according to Verizon) WILL require me to turn the device in.  Since Verizon considers my mom's line to be bought out, and my line on Edge (even though it's the reverse...It's very weird), I should probably get Verizon to sort that out right?  Also, if you do a Device Payoff buy-out, do you then HAVE to get a new phone from T-Mobile (not that it matters), and if you do, does the number of the old line have to be ported to the new line?"
tmobile,3bzyhi,bswim,2,Sat Jul 4 02:21:38 2015 UTC,"Hi! Okay, I'm going to tackle this as best as I possibly can and hopefully the areas that I'm a little unsure on, others can chime in and clarify/correct where necessary.  To answer the 2/100 & JOD & ETF Reimbursement question: From what I understand, you cannot directly qualify for the ETF reimbursement when signing up for JOD. I believe there is a workaround where you can buy a super cheap EIP phone (read: something like 30 bucks from them) and it would qualify. This would also mean trading in a device as well for each of you in order for both line's ETF's to be reimbursed. This area needs clarification from someone else who's handled it.   Now, yes you can use your Verizon iPhone 6 for your mom upon transfer to T-Mobile. The phone will work great on the network, and if im not mistaken, Verizon's model of iPhone comes SIM unlocked already because of an FCC agreement Verizon has for spectrum reasons in the past. So there should be no issues and minimal hassle there for you.  As far as JOD goes (if you can do it and the ETF): In order to get the 64GB model, you would pay the $100 down payment on the device and then get the promo rate (after $12 bill credit) of what I think is roughly 19 bucks/month for the 64GB. The $100 covers the storage capacity jump and is standard for any storage bump on EIP or JOD. No avoiding that.  As far as the 100/Unlimited plan goes: I wouldn't recommend any other plan. It's truly a great deal and yes you can get this plan (between now and July 14th I think when its due to end) with ANY promotion you use. It's simply an available plan at the moment and not contingent upon how you come over to T-mobile's service, if that makes any sense.  In summary, your bullet points of what you want to do I believe are completely possible, provided you purchase a cheap phone on EIP from T-mobile and use that as trade-fodder to become eligible for JOD. Keep in mind, once you Jump using JOD by trading in the 64GB iPhone you get from T-mo, the promo price on your iPhone will end, meaning your bill will go up by that $12 they credit you on your bill.  Hope this helps even somewhat!"
tmobile,3bzyhi,acrolos,2,Fri Jul 3 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"You can definitely do JOD and ETF reimbursement at the same time.  I did it about a week ago, moving from Verizon myself.   We went from paying $175 a month with a 22% discount and one edge plan on the line (and insurance on both phones) to about $150 with two JOD plans (one of which was my wife's iPhone6), plus insurance on both.     We moved from 10 shared gb with Verizon to ""unlimited"" with t-mobile.   All in all not a huge savings per month but that was with leasing an extra phone and getting unlimited data.   They paid off my $120 etf,  my wife's $190 etf,  and gave us a visa gift card for $140 to pay us for both phones.  All in all,  a good deal."

Provided I can do that, I can just get us both unlimited and I can get a 64GB iPhone for like ~$120, which is honestly the best deal I can think of.   EDIT: I see what you're saying on how to make it work with JOD. The only thing is how long would I have to wait to upgrade?

It is true that Band 12 support was removed with the update to Android 5.1. This was a carrier requirement over concerns about Band 12 connections by phones that are not capable of VoLTE. On non-VoLTE phones like the MOTO E, your phone could even show you have a signal, but would be unable to complete a call. At this point, there is no plan to change or address Band 12 support on the Moto E.   Motorola is claiming at least that they removed it because Band 12 requires VoLte for calls, and the Moto E does not support VoLte (at least on tmobile)."

Regardless, it seems like Motorola could have avoided this by just including VoLTE. They're already sucking it up on update speed as it is, so at this point, I'd rather have another delay than lose features."
tmobile,3bw4to,Freak4Dell,3,Thu Jul 2 23:58:00 2015 UTC,"Because Band 12 is a significantly lower frequency than Band 2 and 4, it is generally going to penetrate areas that the EDGE and UMTS networks will not.  So if the phone doesn't support VoLTE, you effectively have signal and data, but no voice.  And anyone not tech-savvy will not understand why they can pull up Google but not call 911..."
tmobile,3bw4to,hiromasaki,2,Fri Jul 3 02:39:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, good point.  So essentially, this is simply a matter of Motorola not bothering to include VoLTE (and actually, possibly actively removing code from the system, since I believe VoLTE is supported on 5.1 out the door)."

I can't image it is terrible complicated to make sure that a phone displays a warning message if it has no phone signal and only LTE data via band 12. T-Mobile should not have any say in what OEMs do to their hardware unless it is being sold by the carriers in-store.  Better yet, don't push out VoLTE until it is ready or universally available within Android. From my Note 4 experiences, it is far from ready for prime-time."

So, according to the store, if even if I went ahead and I paid the EIP, there would be nothing to apply it to.  The steep comment was a personal observation and I apologize if it was taken in a negative manner as that was not the intent.  In my experience, every encounter I've had with T-mobile whether in store or on the phone has taken at minimum 30 minutes to completion; and I'm talking about actual interaction, not waiting on hold, or in line, etc.  When you have 3 different reps telling you 3 different things, it doesn't leave a very good impression."

Or you live with the few BlackBerry apps compared to other app stores.  In the dark ages, I was part of a modem design team. We spent countless man hours tweaking designs to improve reception over marginal phone lines. Much like Nokia is the gold standard of GSM radios, Rockwell was our gold standard. We never beat Rockwell quality, but we didn't quit until we were really close and couldn't do no more.  But getting to my point, we also tested the rest of the competition and it was amazing how much crap there was on the market. Being averse to getting our asses sued, we couldn't publish the results of our testing.   So inside Samsung, LG, BlackBerry, etc. there are people who know which phones have the best radios.

tmobile,3byeye,_Dreams_In_Digital_,4,Fri Jul 3 14:23:12 2015 UTC,"A signal booster isn't an option. It's definitely something I would have grabbed if it were.  Normally the Note 4 is perfectly adequate, signal-wise, but my little Lumia 635 just beats the pants off of it, and I really hope that there's an equivalent Android phone out there.

tmobile,3bwdta,50atomic,13,Thu Jul 2 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"The FUD is strong with these articles!   Let’s be clear. We never understood why the U.S. government needed to provide corporate welfare to two U.S. carriers owned by large, multi-national telecommunications conglomerates. We don’t agree that these companies need an auction preference, particularly when both companies currently have more spectrum per customer than either AT&T or Verizon.   I think that's my favorite part. They absolutely understand: putting in limitations on how much spectrum Verizon and AT&T can purchase will increase competition, which is bad for their business. And they understand that T-Mobile and Sprint both have a very limited portfolio of low-band spectrum, but by lumping all spectrum into one group, it makes their case look better.  Still, Verizon and AT&T do not get it. People who read policy blogs are not the people who are making a stink on twitter. They are not going to get millions of americans on board with stupid long blog posts."
tmobile,3bwdta,Logvin,3,Thu Jul 2 19:13:36 2015 UTC,"It's funny how the only reason Verizon and AT&T are whining about reserving more spectrum for smaller carriers is because they do not want competition. I'm going to copy/paste my post from a few weeks ago, since it is relevant:  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3aszra/tmobile_ceo_john_legere_lives_out_his_fantasy_of/csfwab5   Just to give you guys some ideas of why the FCC should reserve more low band spectrum to smaller carriers, here is a map of low band spectrum owned by Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile: https://i.imgur.com/lKuOwcA.png    Notice how T-Mobile barely has any low band spectrum while the duopoly has a shit load? That is because back in the 80s, the government gave low band spectrum away (for free) to Ma Bell and Bell Atlantic (now AT&T and Verizon). Now all the new smaller carriers have to pay an arm and a leg to get some spectrum.  Without reserving spectrum for smaller carriers, no company will ever come remotely close to Verizon and AT&T. Meanwhile, Verizon is publicly stating they don't care about 'Price Sensitive' customers and that they don't need to compete: https://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20150506/08123630899/verizon-wireless-tells-price-sensitive-customers-it-doesnt-want-them-declares-it-doesnt-need-to-truly-compete.shtml   Without competition, Verizon and AT&T can set the prices at whatever the hell they feel like. Reserving more spectrum for smaller carriers will only benefit customers, hence the reason Verizon and AT&T do not want it to happen. They do not want competition."
tmobile,3bwdta,Morblius,-2,Thu Jul 2 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"I mean i kind of agree with them, it's kind of bullshit that t-mobile keeps asking for special treatment like a handicap kid.

tmobile,3bwdta,PleaseGoOutside,3,Sat Jul 4 00:04:07 2015 UTC,"""In case you’re keeping score that makes three (at least) different proposals by T-Mobile that ask the American taxpayer to subsidize its spectrum buys.""  Didn't AT&T and Verizon (or companies that became AT&T and Verizon) get nationwide low frequency spectrum for free from the federal government?  This auctioning off of airwaves is a relatively new concept.  So they've been given quite a bargain. TMobile isn't asking for free spectrum, or even from preventing them from bidding--only that TMobile and Sprint be given a chance at bidding on a reasonably competitive amount of low frequency spectrum without AT&T and Verizon buying it all up (with money made from their unfair ownership of spectrum).  It seems more than fair to me. To be strictly fair, the government should just give the spectrum to TMobile and Sprint."

tmobile,3buj6v,TheOnlyProfelec,4,Fri Jul 3 02:59:40 2015 UTC,"So, you don't think it's fair that people that use a lot of data get limited when connecting to a tower that's currently being overused?  Even though the rest of the time their speeds are still unlimited? When the tower's maxed out, you gotta slow someone down, or everyone's gonna slow down. The only fair group in that situation is those that have used the most, and it's still not a totally crippling speed. You can still Google and use Maps if you need to; I highly doubt Netflix or YouTube will be necessary in an emergency."
tmobile,3buj6v,Computermaster,2,Thu Jul 2 19:07:44 2015 UTC,"Well, in all fairness, slowing down a few to a crawl isn't going to make up for the rest in all reality. I mean, it's only the top 3% according to t-mobile. So if that's true, only 3% of people on a tower see a bigger slow down. That's not going to make a difference for the other 97% of people on the tower."
tmobile,3buj6v,TheOnlyProfelec,0,Thu Jul 2 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"No, I think it's fair, though I think their approach is bad. I also think what sprint is doing is similarly fair, and similarly a bad approach.   My issue is that sprint and tmobile throttle people regardless of how much of an impact it actually makes on congestion. In Sprints case if you're on an uncongested tower why does it matter how fast you pull video? Likewise in tmobiles case if I'm in the 3% yet all I'm currently doing is browsing reddit while other people, who are not in the 3%, are streaming hd netflix how does it help congestion to throttle me? I think both need to do network management, but I think their approach is flawed at best. What I do take issue with here mostly is people bashing sprint where tmobile is really no different."
tmobile,3buj6v,kryptobs2000,0,Thu Jul 2 19:13:53 2015 UTC,"It makes no sense. I disagree with throttling the top users.   The top users are the ones who actually value the product that you use, they are the ones that spread word of mouth praise on your company. They are the ones that not only notice but actually care.   Why deprioritize the 5% that will care about the depriotitization? Why not do it to the 95% that won't notice or care?  If you have a family plan, and one person on that plan uses 80gb a month, chances are that they are actually the real decision maker about the provider. Why piss them off?"
tmobile,3buj6v,thagthebarbarian,2,Thu Jul 2 22:35:57 2015 UTC,"It's not a hard throttle, it's not necessarily under 600kbps, and if it is far below 600kbps most other people on the tower aren't doing much better than that, soft cap or not."
tmobile,3buj6v,MrBamHam,0,Thu Jul 2 20:56:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was a hard throttle all the time, only on congested towers, and it is necessarily under 600kbps, for me it's well under 600kbps and it happens almost daily, though rarely longer than a couple hours, but often enough that it's annoying and certainly something worth voicing my opinion over. Even more so when other companies do similar things and then all these tmobile fanboys come out and act like it's something entirely different that their company would never consider doing. I get anywhere from 15-200kbps when I get throttled on average, obviously when it's in the lower end of that I can barely even browse the internet, I sure as fuck cannot watch even a 360p video at that rate. 600kbps is broadband compared to 50. Either way my point still stands that this does very little to solve the stated issue of congestion, either on sprint or tmobiles part."

tmobile,3buj6v,Freak4Dell,7,Thu Jul 2 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"Happy customers don't jump ship. T-Mobile wouldn't be picking up as many customers from Sprint if customers there were happy. T-Mobile's pricing is good, but it's not that much better than Sprint. Legere and T-Mobile pretty much have spent the last while figuring out what pisses people off and making it better.   On a personal level, due to switching to T-Mobile, I no longer have to buy SIM Cards and buy data when I travel. My network experience is overall better. I'm satisfied to the point if Verizon or AT&T was to match, or offer a lower rate, I'd tell them no."
tmobile,3buj6v,robondes,3,Thu Jul 2 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. T-Mobile was cheaper than Sprint for a long time when I was on Sprint. But their network wasn't very good, and Sprint's was, so I was happy to stay on Sprint. At some point, that situation turned around, and I realized I was paying Sprint more money for a tenth of the service. The money wasn't the deciding factor, but having better service for less money sure is great."

Sprint is miles ahead of where they were a year ago."

tmobile,3buj6v,mtux96,15,Thu Jul 2 20:38:12 2015 UTC,Honestly don't blame them. They are the worst carrier and it seems the nation knows it. I'd be pissed too.   For God sakes their CEO publicly acknowledges their network is terrible and the only option is price war.
tmobile,3buj6v,rebelx,5,Thu Jul 2 20:39:57 2015 UTC,Network is fantastic in the area where I live. Definitely depends on where you are.
tmobile,3buj6v,EMINEM_4Evah,2,Thu Jul 2 08:24:35 2015 UTC,"Network is fantastic in the area where I live. Definitely depends on where you are.   That can be said about all carriers as each carrier as spots where they are not great. It's the nature of wireless communication. But when you're problems are widespread then it's an issue for many people, especially when these problems are in populated areas."
tmobile,3buj6v,BlockWave,8,Thu Jul 2 13:51:08 2015 UTC,"Satisfaction is very location specific, though. Where I live, it doesn't matter which carrier I have, I'm going to get solid service. Unlimited data and price is thus important to me. Obviously, this doesn't apply to many people, so their experiences will likely be significantly different than mine."

tmobile,3buj6v,Freak4Dell,4,Thu Jul 2 07:24:03 2015 UTC,"I dont know about where I live, but where I work Sprint sucks. When a customer is downloading an app to get their photos off their phone, I know right away that they are on Sprint as they are there for 30 minutes downloading a single app."

tmobile,3buj6v,dsatrbs,3,Thu Jul 2 16:37:58 2015 UTC,Sprint conveniently changed their method of measurement when T-Mobile was dangerously close to beating them. It put T-Mobile behind by a few quarters. I think it will happen in the next couple of quarters.

I bought a phone on Sprint a few years back and couldn't get 4G anywhere in the area. The data just trickled, even though it was ""unlimited"". I have friends in southern Virginia that said the same. I ended up buying out the contract.  I get T-Mobile, and travel to India and get free 2G and 3G throughout the entire country on a variety of carriers at no additional cost.

tmobile,3bx5q7,easyxtarget,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:44:11 2015 UTC,"Since you will definitely need more minutes, I would suggest the $60/month prepaid plan that includes 3GB a month and data stash so if you average 2GB a month, you'll build up a pretty big stash for any months you need to use more. 100 minutes won't cut it for a work phone. Also you'll effectively lower your contribution to $20 a month."
tmobile,3bx5q7,dagaetch,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:48:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm! This is an idea. I don't want to spend additional money if I can, but perhaps I can build up a reserve of T-Mobile credit by staying with the $30 plan but reloading $40 every month. So if anyone calls me and I use up my minutes, it'll just deduct from my additional $10 reserve."
tmobile,3bx5q7,dombow4,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:31:21 2015 UTC,I do worry that even 200 minutes a month won't be enough for work but you can always switch plans mid month if its not working out.

tmobile,3by9ks,Logvin,3,Fri Jul 3 04:01:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought all VoLTE to 3G or VoLTE to VoLTE calls on T-Mobile were HD voice. Weird."

tmobile,3by9ks,pwastage,3,Fri Jul 3 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"HD Voice is simply a higher codec of audio, and that is a requirement of VoLTE. It is not always activated, but my understanding is that if a phone supports VoLTE it has to support HD Voice. You are correct."
tmobile,3by9ks,Logvin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:54:03 2015 UTC,PSTN transcoding doesn't take place until the voice traffic is switched onto POTS lines. The phone will continue to send and receive using AMR.

tmobile,3by9ks,jaminmc,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:01:31 2015 UTC,1)  It is possible it was placed over LTE as I saw the LTE icon during the call (but I do not know if I have any way of knowing for sure if the call was actually a VoLTE call or just a regular telephone call) however I routinely made calls with an LG G-90 which did not have LTE or VoLTE and -always- had an HD Voice call when speaking to other t-mobile users with supported phones.  2) Yes - without any doubt.

tmobile,3bwffc,Deceptiveideas,3,Thu Jul 2 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"From what I read, group messages are pretty terrible across all carriers.

If you have an iPhone, iMessage is 500x superior in getting messages sent out to other who also have an iPhone. On Android, I believe there is an equivalent but I don't have an Android phone so I couldn't tell you.  It's actually one of the reasons why I like iOS. So many people use iPhones so when message problems occur it's less likely to bother me due to my texts going through WiFi and not SMS."

It's worked extremely well!   Edit: I should probably point out that I could easily use Hangouts for both regular and group SMS, but the group SMS that I have on Hangout are all work related, and I like to keep them separate from personal life. Hence using two different apps. I did used to use Hangouts for everything, but due to wanting some separating, took to using Google Messenger. That, and Messenger is just jaw-droppingly gorgeous and simplistic."

tmobile,3bw5i6,50atomic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:39:18 2015 UTC,Interesting. Appreciate the explanation.
tmobile,3bw5i6,Random_Illianer,6,Thu Jul 9 09:44:16 2015 UTC,"So.....  The roaming agreement provision in the breakup was an option. It wasnt a ""T-Mobile gets free roaming"" deal, it was a ""If T-Mobile wants to roam on AT&T's network, they can opt to purchase roaming at a rate of XXX.""  T-Mobile did not choose to exercise that option. The currently-in place roaming agreements that T-Mobile had with AT&t already covered the areas T-Mobile wanted, so they just stuck with that.  So to answer your question.... absolutely nothing, because T-Mobile never did that roaming agreement.  Plus, what /u/50atomic said... T-Mobile's goal is to have native coverage in all of those areas and not have roaming partners if it can avoid it."
tmobile,3bw5i6,reedacus25,4,Thu Jul 2 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"But we can all agree it would have been nice to see some of the existing ATT roaming areas get UMTS roaming in addition to the GSM roaming.  I know I can speak for one stretch of I-55 in south Mississippi that the ATT GSM network has basically been gutted and capacity cut to a minimum. Voice quality is horrid and calls drop constantly. Would love to see UMTS roaming so that I know I'll actually be able to carry a call...  I'm leaving data out of this because that's a whole different discussion. I just would like some usable voice...  And to that end, I know that can't be an edge case. Att has been thinning the GSM network nationwide in anticipation of the sunset and to refarm the spectrum for UMTS and LTE. So I'm sure it impacts plenty of users any lots of areas where att roaming is gsm only."
tmobile,3bw5i6,_FluX23,3,Thu Jul 2 23:49:12 2015 UTC,edge case.    heh
tmobile,3bw5i6,Random_Illianer,2,Fri Jul 3 04:04:46 2015 UTC,"Roaming isn't free. The breakup was for a roaming agreement,  it a free one.  Maybe it just wasn't a good enough deal?"

tmobile,3bvcga,Fdnyc,3,Thu Jul 2 23:26:46 2015 UTC,The data is way too slow to be a reasonable option for a year. Also more expensive than just getting a plan there.
tmobile,3bvcga,easyxtarget,3,Thu Jul 2 15:37:46 2015 UTC,So you want EDGE speed? Getting a local sim will be easier.
tmobile,3bvcga,istealthbro,5,Thu Jul 2 20:38:45 2015 UTC,"My fiancee is living in Japan for a year and went through this. She used her T-Mobile sim for a month before buying a sim card off Amazon.jp for around $90 for 12 gigs of data. She will occasional switch sim cards and 5 months later the T-Mobile sim still works. She just bought another sim because she was out of the 12 gigs of data. Keep in mind that we share a plan with two lines and the majority of activity is seen on my line so that may have helped in keeping her sim active for so long. Also, roaming speeds with the T-Mobile sim in Japan are so slow that it will frustrate you if you enjoy using your phone to browse.  What she learned is that in Japan people don't call very much and use Line (a messaging program) more than anything so she is able to get away with a data only card. She signed up for a Skype Japanese forwarding number which will ring the Skype program on her phone if someone does need to reach her this way.  Total cost for sim cards and Skype subscription would be under $400 for a year. Less if you use less data than she does. This is much cheaper than signing up for a cell phone contract in Japan. Plus, it's common for cell phone contracts to be at minimum 2 years in Japan. It'll be extremely difficult to find a contract for a year if you want a decent smart phone. Just make sure you have an unlocked phone if you want to go this route."
tmobile,3bvcga,pixlick,2,Thu Jul 2 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"Better off on a local sim. I hear Japan has slow LTE, I cannot confirm if it's true however."
tmobile,3bvcga,DarkyPoo,2,Thu Jul 2 15:59:11 2015 UTC,You want T-mobile to buy out your Verizon contract so you can go overseas with it for a year still?  Just get a local Japanese card... it'll be less hassle in the long run.
tmobile,3bvcga,nobody65535,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:30:23 2015 UTC,My friend is doing exactly this on my plan. He has a sum and is in Japan. He only gets edge but it's unlimited and he can call and text too. He doesn't use his phone much so it works for him.

The gentleman enthusiastically told me that that's fine, and I could use my phone abroad as I intend. I also made sure to ask if there's a time limit to how long I can use it abroad and he said no.

tmobile,3bu071,velvenhavi,2,Thu Jul 2 06:12:17 2015 UTC,The reason you know about the leap second is because it actually poses a problem from time to time. So it's quite the possibility considering the timing of it all
tmobile,3bu071,MartOut,2,Thu Jul 2 06:20:51 2015 UTC,"As a developer, I must say, anomalies like this can be very troublesome on code. Most of mine and other developers programs rely on a clock and gather that time from online sources. Since most developing relies on a framework of some sort, if you are using a framework that is outdated or the company hasn't updated the framework(for example .NET) then it may cause any active session of your program to throw and exception and crash. I don't know how this relates to mobile technologies, but I would say a leap second could have been probable if most people hadn't solved that issue years ago, such as reddit."

tmobile,3bubkv,abcgeek,5,Thu Jul 2 05:45:29 2015 UTC,"Like what? I bought the iPhone JOD promo, but I'm not dumb enough to believe that I get to keep this bill credit if I switch in three months to a new phone. I got the promo because I plan to keep the phone and payoff after the lease."
tmobile,3bubkv,Freak4Dell,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:38:47 2015 UTC,"He makes the same good points that anybody could make about any promotion ever. They're valid points, but they're so obvious that actually stating them as a negative thing just makes you look like a fool."
tmobile,3bubkv,abcgeek,2,Thu Jul 2 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, Legere does the same thing basically. It's obvious that AT&T and Verizon are screwing their customers in multiple ways, and Legere points out said ways. But does that necessarily make Legere look like a fool?  I think Marcelo just got fed up with Legere always talking crap about Sprint. I personally think it gets old. We want Sprint to succeed just as much as we want T-mobile to. It's better for all of us. Slamming Sprint doesn't help anybody really. Unless they rightfully deserve to get slammed. (Ahem 600kbps Video cap)"
tmobile,3bubkv,Freak4Dell,2,Thu Jul 2 17:36:04 2015 UTC,"Whoops, replied to the wrong thing.  Can you point me to an example where Legere has pointed out something so stupidly obvious as promo prices go away when you go off the promo? I'm genuinely curious, not trying to be condescending. His stuff with AT&T and Verizon, at least lately, has had to do with things that the average person actually doesn't know, like how they're fighting to have all the spectrum for themselves.  Personally, I couldn't care less about what happens to Sprint. I think T-Mobile is doing just fine whether Sprint is in the picture or not. It's every man for himself, as far as I'm concerned."
tmobile,3bubkv,mitten_mike,2,Thu Jul 2 17:43:04 2015 UTC,what Claure lacks in 'hip cool uncle trying to impress children' he makes up for in 'responsible and mild mannered CEO returning a corporation to profitability'.

tmobile,3bubkv,kevinyeaux,10,Thu Jul 2 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"""You trick people into believing they have a $15 iPhone lease..."" This from the company that said the S6 was ""free"" when they jacked the rates up by the exact amount of the lease cost? (Oh, and it's pretty clear it's a promotion.)  ""You don't tell them the price goes up to $27 when they do."" Pretty sure that's actually my job, and every rep who deals with this explains exactly what upgrades entail - paying the regular fee, just like Sprint.  And let's not forget this is the company that is ""waiving"" line fees on Family Share Pack until 2016 -meaning when you're mid contract or lease, you'll be shelling out more each month and there's nothing you can do about it.   I like Claure, I want him to turn Sprint around. But this screams of some PR guy telling him to get to Legere's level, only without the facts to back him up."

tmobile,3bwwg5,vitaminjay1982,2,Thu Jul 2 20:40:04 2015 UTC,It's probably an error on T-Mobile's part based on the info you provided. If you still have questions then you can still give them a call.

The bigger question for me is... what do the upgrades mean? What are they doing? And will it be like flipping a switch on 8/5 or will the upgrades gradually roll out between now and then? Faster speeds? More coverage beyond the city/county?"
tmobile,3by6bx,garaging,3,Fri Jul 3 03:16:05 2015 UTC,What contract? Why do you owe $900?
tmobile,3by6bx,AlucardZero,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:24:25 2015 UTC,It would be to pay back the price of the phones.

tmobile,3by6bx,Domini384,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:04:18 2015 UTC,"If you have Jump, then jump up to a cheap phone, which will pay for your iPhone.   I have never heard of jump.  So I can switch to a cheaper phone and only owe the price of that phone?  And I would no longer be tied to the price of the iphones?   If I then, paid off the cheaper phones, I can just go to another carrier, no strings attached?"
tmobile,3by6bx,kevinyeaux,2,Fri Jul 3 03:37:54 2015 UTC,Yes but you would also need to pay off the remaining month service
tmobile,3bwnvw,DrHouse92,6,Thu Jul 2 19:36:11 2015 UTC,T-Mobile has said this was a mistake and fixed it. http://imgur.com/ug0KesM speeds are getting back to normal.
tmobile,3bwnvw,pwastage,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:10:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. Deprioritization should be on a per-unlimited-user basis  And its not a strict data cap(like those 1GB high speed plans, throttled to 128kbps always after)"
tmobile,3bwnvw,skyxsteel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:55:53 2015 UTC,The text you got was unreal though. If they hadn't fixed it one could easily mistake for unlimited now being just a 21GB plan.

tmobile,3bwlq7,zorrobyte,4,Thu Jul 2 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"Let us know what happens, that a huge disappointment. Obviously that's a tech glitch that could happen anywhere, so I wouldn't blame T-Mo 100%, but defiantly demand not to pay the restocking fee. While you are there also make them call the corporate office since they have much more power and pull of things that normal employees are not allowed to do."
tmobile,3bwlq7,atade15,2,Thu Jul 2 19:36:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i've Seen it happen a few times. Payment goes through, then there's a rare occurance of a fatal system error when generating the receipt.  BTW, the promotion is still going on. http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/g4/cover-promo?cmpid=lgg4leathercoverpromo.comURL    you should be able to get it waived due to no receipt generating.

tmobile,3bwlq7,expertzero,2,Thu Jul 2 20:55:17 2015 UTC,Damn you're right. I missed that part. Only thing I can think of is having them escalate the issue. The store should contact the lg who's running the promo through email and have them decide if you can use the EIP page (the one you signed in store) as proof of purchase.
tmobile,3bwlq7,Domini384,2,Thu Jul 2 21:12:04 2015 UTC,If they find no record of purchase then is it still on your account?

For me that would be 50% payments, but I didn't finance a phone so I'm good to go on whatever is out then. Come on Nexus 7 (6 2015 version)!"
tmobile,3bwk5o,peethepainaway,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:56:51 2015 UTC,"Ok so none of this applies to me, when we first started our plan we opted out of Jump so we don't have it"
tmobile,3bwhut,SgtDirtyMike,5,Thu Jul 2 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"If you got a text saying you have a cap, you are absolutely not on the unlimited plan.  People who use more than 21GB in a month may be de prioritized on busy towers, but they are not notified via SMS.  I'd highly recommend you call Care, ask what plan you are on, and ask what is going on. They have a quick check when they type your number in that can tell if you are being throttled or prioritized."
tmobile,3bwhut,Logvin,4,Thu Jul 2 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"Not the case apparently, my friend on a truly unlimited plan recently went over just 21GB on his line and every line on the plan got this text message and are being slowed down to less than 1 mbps. He just posted a thread here about it.   https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/3bwnvw/tmobile_throttling_text/  EDIT: Care fixed him, it was an internal error. Speeds are back to normal."
tmobile,3bwhut,mattlgroff,0,Thu Jul 2 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just read online. T-Mobile silently updated their TOS on the unlimited plans with this stipulation on June 25. What a shame. I should take it up with the FCC. When I transferred to T-Mobile, I was told my plan was truly unlimited. And that's what it says on the website. There are no asterisks or extra information."
tmobile,3bwhut,idip31,6,Thu Jul 2 19:47:44 2015 UTC,The website talks about the 21gb soft cap and the TOS has always included a network optimization clause.  You're still getting unlimited data though.
tmobile,3bwhut,ree5,2,Thu Jul 2 21:07:06 2015 UTC,"It really should go to the FCC.  You can't falsify something by publicly say it's ""unlimited 4g lte data"" (which they are still advertising) and have a cap placed on it,  even if it's slipped in the TOS.   It even says the exact terms  ""unlimited 4g lte data on my bill."""
tmobile,3bwhut,Logvin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:51:30 2015 UTC,Right. I'm not sure why I was down voted. My information is accurate.

tmobile,3bwhut,CrUz_clan,11,Thu Jul 2 19:44:43 2015 UTC,"This looks like an error in T-Mobile's system.  I will stress again:   I'd highly recommend you call Care, ask what plan you are on, and ask what is going on."
tmobile,3bwhut,Deceptiveideas,6,Thu Jul 2 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"How did you manage to use 200gb in a month on a mobile device?   Regardless, you will probably just be deprioritized, which is different than being throttled."
tmobile,3bwhut,sedp23,2,Thu Jul 2 19:00:57 2015 UTC,Ikr I was like holy shit I thought my 70 was a lot
tmobile,3bwhut,expertzero,-4,Thu Jul 2 19:51:27 2015 UTC,"We live in an age where 4K video streaming is a thing. I'm not saying I'm doing that on my device, but the point is that companies nowadays think 21GB as ""unlimited"" data is acceptable. Or 10 gigs shared amongst a family should suffice (other carriers.) I feel like people think we're in the 1990s. I travel a decent amount and am a student. I'm on the move a lot a download things to my phone and transfer them to my PC. Or I'll use mobile tethering which is free on my plan. To put it in perspective, on a home connection I've used 5 times that much in a month. So I'm using about 5 times less data on my phone than I am on a dedicated line."
tmobile,3bwhut,TheOnlyProfelec,11,Thu Jul 2 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"Just to clear up some confusion, you are not being throttled or limited at 21GB. What happens is deprioritization after 21GB. This means when your tower is congested, your speeds will be slowed down so other people on the tower can use data. Basically, they're making the big semi truck off to the side to let all the cars pass by. Once the traffic clears up, you get full speed again.  I'm not really here to debate if this is ethical or not, just here to explain what's going on."
tmobile,3bwhut,expertzero,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:10:58 2015 UTC,Best explanation I've read thanks
tmobile,3bwhut,Logvin,-1,Thu Jul 2 23:14:46 2015 UTC,I understand this process and I don't mind if they do it. But they didn't say that in the text. I got a text which should only apply to non-unlimited customers. It was a fluke.
tmobile,3bwhut,expertzero,9,Thu Jul 2 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"Do you torrent? Sounds a lot like it. Tethering is 7 GB also, which doesn't add up to 200 gb!    Like /r/Logvin said, call customer care and let us know what they say!"

tmobile,3bwhut,nauticalfiesta,3,Thu Jul 2 21:41:55 2015 UTC,"No. Torrenting I believe is against the TOS. Anyone in IT will tell you that you don't need to torrent to get that kind of usage. To tell you the truth I don't know how my usage was that high either. Regardless, I'm paying for unlimited so I don't see why it's an issue.   And yes I do tether. After June 2015 T-Mobile no longer blocks users after they reach their tethering cap. They just throttle you. You can still tether."
tmobile,3bwhut,WindAeris,2,Thu Jul 2 21:33:13 2015 UTC,"So after 7 gb at 128 kbps, you're able to still use 200 gb? holy shit lol    have you contacted t-mobile customer care yet?"
tmobile,3bv917,Mastaking,6,Thu Jul 2 12:52:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with your analysis.  It's the only way T-Mobile can have a program like this.  If they allowed every phone they'd lose money and they're in business to make money.  That said, I think having all the major flagships (other than the Nexus 6) cover the needs of a good majority of their customers.  You have to remember that us people here on Reddit are in a tiny minority of T-Mobile's overall customer base.  I think it makes sense and I will absolutely be using it.  And FYI - I hate the old JUMPs and I hate EIP. JoD is perfect for me tho."
tmobile,3bv917,NexusPhan,4,Thu Jul 2 12:58:57 2015 UTC,"""For us"" and ""for T-Mobile"" don't have to be mutually exclusive."
tmobile,3bv917,woowhee,3,Thu Jul 2 14:38:39 2015 UTC,"They are a business of course ;)    They've definitively run the scenarios and figured out what phones make sense for this type of plan, what can they recoup/make money on.  There's also some accounting things going on in the background too which might be part of the reason.  But in the end if they make us, the customer, a little happier or provide the option to be, they'll keep us longer and in the end that's the goal.    Also, the plan won't even be fully utilized by probably more people than you think.  See quote from the last earnings call.     Braxton Carter (EVP and CFO): And on that first question, Paul, one of the things that surprised me is that with the transparency on the true cost and value of that phone, we've actually seen people keeping their phones longer than we had anticipated in the initial business case. And I think that's very, very healthy for the industry."
tmobile,3bv917,tpengz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:01:22 2015 UTC,"I mean it makes sense. I'd attribute that to two factors   Phones have gotten to the point where things can't get that much better year after year. iPhone 2G to iPhone 3GS was a HUGE jump. iPhone 3G to iPhone 4 was a big jump. 4 to 5 was a decent jump. 5 to 6 was a decent jump. A 5 is still mostly serviceable. It'll be getting iOS 9 and it'll work. Which ties into  People have an incentive to keep their phones longer. If I pay 80 a month whether I upgrade or not, might as well upgrade. If I can pay 30 bucks less by not upgrading, I might keep my phone longer."
tmobile,3bv917,misteryub,2,Thu Jul 2 16:55:11 2015 UTC,I like that they aren't allowing ETFs to be paid off by JUMP on demand at least not directly.  The program is for people who already have T-mobile and know for sure that coverage works where they need it to and just want to upgrade every few months.
tmobile,3bv917,anothercookie90,2,Thu Jul 2 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"Just curious.... Lets suppose I sign up for JOD today and get the LG G4. 2 months later, I no longer wish to keep the line and cancel it. What happens then? Do I HAVE to pay the remainder of the phone before I cancel the line? Or do I just return the phone back to T-Mobile without any penalty?"
tmobile,3bv917,Dingo989,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"You have to pay off either the remainder of the 18 month lease and return the phone OR pay off full price and own it.  That's an advantage to Jump1 or 2, to cancel you can just jump to the cheapest phone and pay that off as opposed to clearing your high end phone."
tmobile,3bv917,OtherAlan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:26:47 2015 UTC,The remaining EIP becomes due if you close the account. If you have multiple lines you will still be paying the EIP since you're still an active customer but you'll have two monthly EIP for the remaining lines on your account.  Or really how ever many more you're 'leasing' from TMUS.

Want to return Verizon phone as I'm still within the 14 day window.   Plan on porting number back to tmobile and using the note 4 that is with tmobile in the first place.   I called tmobile and explained it and the customer service told me it  shouldn't be a problem and that all I would have to do is get a new SIM card for my Note 4.   The question I have is do I need to pay off the phone completely before I can do this or can I just continue to pay the monthly payment while using my original tmobile note 4 on tmobiles service?

Out east, they've pretty much covered all the 2G areas out of Denver until you cross into Viaero territory. As far as overlaying their native coverage in Colorado, they are nearly done with all the 2G areas.  We'll have to see what gets done with Gunnison, Durango, and the rest of SW Colorado that got 3G upgrades five years ago, but they really have moved fast, especially considering how slow CenturyLink is for fiber upgrades to their sites."

And small spots in various places. Only 3G in Idaho Springs, Georgetown, and Copper.  I agree with all of your assessments. Pure speculation, but I agree, I think backhaul is the problem.

tmobile,3brlpv,frostycakes,2,Wed Jul 1 23:05:42 2015 UTC,"You may have had issues with your phone then, I've never had a problem getting LTE in Idaho Springs or Georgetown (in fact, I think both of them are B4 LTE). In fact, aside from the tunnel, I've had solid LTE from Denver to Breckenridge for a couple years now. I have noticed my N6 likes to cling to a 3G signal well after it re-enters LTE coverage sometimes, maybe that's what happened with you?  The joys of living in a CenturyLink market. I'm honestly surprised that they haven't been using alternate fiber vendors heavily in the mountain west, seeing as how CL is so damn slow-- I imagine Comcast, Charter, or one of the others could get fiber to some of these sites fairly quickly. I know Sprint had to get a lot of their fiber from Comcast on the Front Range due to how long CL was taking (I have a friend who works for a company that does the fiber and equipment upgrades for cell sites; unfortunately T-Mobile is the one carrier they don't contract with though), and IIRC they used microwave for the 285 build and some of the LTE in Elbert/E Arapahoe counties; maybe we'll see a lot more of that, even as a stopgap until they can get an actual fiber line to the site, in our region."

The nexus 6 does hang on to 3G for a while, even if LTE is available. The new coverage on 285 is great.   Otherwise I agree, it's great coverage for most of the way."

Once backhaul is delivered, LTE will launch very quickly since base station equipment is already upgraded. When Cedar City backhaul was upgraded HSPA+ speeds increased immediately and LTE followed very quickly after since base stations had already been upgraded. I assume the same is true in other parts of the Mountain West that are still waiting on backhaul."

tmobile,3brlpv,mostdope92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:50:33 2015 UTC,"This seems a little revisionist. I was under the impression that the 2G->LTE conversion would be almost done by now, and that the push to 300m would be (nearly) complete by year end."
tmobile,3brlpv,whitetigergrowl,7,Wed Jul 1 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"They said it would be ""substantially complete"" by mid 2015 and totally complete by end of 2015. As the person you are replying to said, they are actually ahead of schedule."
tmobile,3brlpv,stevehobbes,0,Wed Jul 1 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"I'll believe it when I see it. They won't be starting until sometime this fall for expansion.  When winter hits the northern states, and it can as early as Oct, game over for expansion in those areas. They may be able to build the towers, but unless there is pre-existing backhaul in those places, build out will have to wait until spring."
tmobile,3brlpv,whitetigergrowl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:24:56 2015 UTC,That's not true at all. They can trench just fine through most of the winter.
tmobile,3brlpv,dmplus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Through feet and feet of snow, through feet of frozen ground, for hundreds of miles. Through rough terrain. Yeah. No.   I guess that would explain why even ATT and Verizon and others usually wait till Spring when winter hits. Winters in the northern plains can make it usually pretty impossible if they are bad enough.  It's hard to trench through frozen solid ground. Only in the cities may they be able to do anything in the winter. I never see much in the way of trenching during the winters outside of the cities. For good reason.  They aren't gonna move feet and feet of snow and thaw the ground to trench for hundreds of miles in the dead of winter through rural areas. Not gonna happen."
tmobile,3brlpv,Logvin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:59:04 2015 UTC,"The press release said ""substantially complete"".  Legere himself said ""every square inch"" of EDGE would be LTE by now, probably a bit of hyperbole but neither is an accurate description of what the current state is."
tmobile,3brlpv,whitetigergrowl,6,Wed Jul 1 17:59:02 2015 UTC,"Well if you want to keep saying ""substantially complete"", could you define what that is? 75%? 90%? 99%? Maybe it is different for different people.  My original statement stands. T-Mobile has 6 months left on their goal, and they are ahead of schedule."
tmobile,3brlpv,wifiguru,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:25:40 2015 UTC,"So are they on schedule for their major expansion into places like the Dakotas that was also part of their EOY map? The Dakotas can get cold weather and snow as early as Oct that could hinder and slow down any expansion into those areas until Spring. Once the ground freezes, even if the tower is up, there will be no backhaul to those sites until spring.  Yes, they still have some time to pull it off. But once Sept hits the clock starts ticking."
tmobile,3brlpv,Freak4Dell,3,Wed Jul 1 21:32:10 2015 UTC,I think they were supposed to have a certain number of POPs done by mid year.

tmobile,3brlpv,_FluX23,6,Wed Jul 1 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"As far as I was aware, Band 12 is always going to be paired with either Band 4 or Band 2, right?"

tmobile,3brlpv,DBordello,4,Wed Jul 1 23:24:05 2015 UTC,Yes I am pretty sure b12 towers get the full upgrade.
tmobile,3brlpv,Thundertime88,3,Wed Jul 1 18:08:28 2015 UTC,Yeah it will be in bigger cities I believe. Once you get in to more rural areas band 2 and 4 will become more spotty and that's where the band 12 will become more handy. Band 12 is supposed to have batter range and penitrate buildings better.
tmobile,3brlpv,Clutch_22,5,Wed Jul 1 18:57:17 2015 UTC,"Right, but for now (as /u/icepick_ mentioned), they aren't deploying Band 12 solo."

tmobile,3brlpv,mostdope92,3,Wed Jul 1 19:19:54 2015 UTC,That is very interesting.  I just decided against converting my family to T-Mobile when my Nexus 5 had limited LTE in my area.  Any way to determine what band they are using in what areas?
tmobile,3brlpv,mostdope92,2,Wed Jul 1 16:54:05 2015 UTC,the coverage map tells you most of the time.

tmobile,3brlpv,jackskellington6,2,Wed Jul 1 19:10:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess the coverage maps should do. Otherwise if you have access to a t-mobile phone you could download an app called LTE discovery and it will tell you what band. Usually if you're in an area with limited LTE on T-mobile  it will most likely be band 2 area, which I discovered to usually be the weakest signal. It's usually in more rural areas."
tmobile,3brlpv,acrolos,2,Wed Jul 1 17:10:01 2015 UTC,They said end of 2015 is when it was supposed to be completed. Not middle of 2015.

tmobile,3bsg85,mitten_mike,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:23:48 2015 UTC,You realize that once t-mobile actually gains more subscribers then data speeds will plummet down to AT&T levels...
tmobile,3bsg85,PleaseGoOutside,3,Thu Jul 2 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how people aren't getting this either; these super fast speeds are like speeding down an open highway. when cars start getting in your way, the party is over really quick. I used to get 30mbps on 5x5 in my city a year ago, now I get 15mbps, and I don't live in a huge city. T-Mobile has pretty much used up all their spectrum, they won't be going any faster than ~120-140mbps, they have nowhere to go but down, yet all these people are cheering and saying 'and they'll get faster!' as if it's physically possible..it's not, they're going to get slower, and they're going to get stingy with data...pointing that out gets you downvotes because people apparently don't want to face the reality."
tmobile,3bsg85,iwascompromised,2,Thu Jul 2 03:52:37 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree with you and I get down voted quite often, a lot of unintelligent people here just try to brag so much that t-mobile can get these speeds and Verizon and ATT can only hit like 15mb down yet people don't realize Verizon and ATT serve about 120 million people each, so each of them have double the subscribers and still run a workable network, t-mobile is already having congestion issues in some places and they barely have any subscribers in the big picture."
tmobile,3bsg85,PleaseGoOutside,2,Thu Jul 2 04:06:08 2015 UTC,And that this is only in select cities with certain devices? I've only seen over 20Mbps a couple times. Mostly I'm 12 or lower.
tmobile,3bsg85,iwascompromised,2,Thu Jul 2 02:41:59 2015 UTC,"Yea exactly, I mean don't get me wrong, t-mobiles speeds are great but they literally have half the customers that ATT does.

tmobile,3bsg85,PleaseGoOutside,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:23:37 2015 UTC,"I commented on the lack of coverage during a multi-state drive I made the other day.

Then I showed them the map of zero coverage in western PA and western NY. 8 hours driving a truck through part of the country that had little to no tmobile coverage and only limited partner coverage. I would have been really screwed if I had broken down.  I like the uncarrier moves, but I really just want coverage, even if rural coverage is just 3G piggybacking on someone else. I just need to be able to access maps and my phone sometimes."

Like you said I do love the uncarrier moves and the competition that t-mobile is bringing to the market but they're so far behind on any sort of rural coverage that AT&T and Verizon will be unbeatable for years to come."

tmobile,3bsg85,PleaseGoOutside,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:43:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not very good at math, or really anything in life, but I'd assume that as T-Mobile gains more users, they will have more income. More income means more money to pay down debt, and buy more spectrum. But what do I know?"
tmobile,3bsg85,_Dreams_In_Digital_,-2,Thu Jul 2 14:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yea because Verizon or AT&amp;T just decided to not buy spectrum and that's why their speeds are far less.... I swear the intelligence of the average person on this subreddit is barely above Down syndrome. First off, t-mobile is operating at a loss right now so if they gain more subscribers like they are then they will just break even which doesn't leave tons of room for spectrum purchases. Second if t-mobile does gain a substantial amount of customers where they do have money to buy spectrum as you claim then they will no longer be able to cry to the FCC to put aside spectrum for them because they won't be able to say that Verizon and AT&amp;T have an unfair advantage, and if t-mobile ever had to go head to head with the big two in spectrum auction they would walk away with very little because AT&amp;T and Verizon have VERY deep pockets and will easily bully t-mobile out. Now one thing you need to understand is that I am a t-mobile customer and I'm grateful that they are challenging the industry because it's going to let me get a better deal when I switch to AT&amp;T but you need to open your eyes and realize that the only reason data speeds are so damn amazing is because t-mobile has less then 60 million subscribers when both AT&amp;T and Verizon have well over 100 million each.  Edit: Spelling."
tmobile,3bsg85,PleaseGoOutside,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:12:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. Verizon and ATT don't want to spend anymore money. They know that their flock of sheep will stay with them as long as they have a signal in the boonies, regardless of the slow speeds. T-Mobile is actively buying. My market already has speeds of around 30Mbps, but Tmo just bought another 5Mhz or specturm here. They are planning ahead for growth."
tmobile,3bsg85,_Dreams_In_Digital_,0,Thu Jul 2 16:16:28 2015 UTC,Well after that comment its apparent that you're either a troll or fucking brain dead. Verizon and AT&T both aggressively buy spectrum at auctions and are always acquiring spectrum is places they find it.

tmobile,3bsg85,Gunny123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:04:56 2015 UTC,"No, I'm actually quite the opposite. I lift 5 days a week and have pretty large muscles, but it annoys me to no end when people come out making false claims in an arrogant fan boyish way. Do you form any of your own opinions or do you blindly follow horribly wrong information that you see posted on this subreddit? Lets think for a moment, Do you think Verizon or AT&T would really keep customers if they didn't keep improving their services? Do you think Verizon is like, Hmm we are number one in the market but fuck it lets just give up the forward thinking we've ever had and not buy anymore spectrum, fuck our customers we don't care if they get shit on.  One thing you need to realize is Verizon and AT&T are the best for a reason because they know how to develop a mobile network, the best. Like I said before, I'm grateful for what t-mobile is doing because someone needs to shake up the market, but the facts are T-Mobile will never acquire universal band 12 across the United States because the biggest holders of those blocks either will not sell or want to charge T-Mobile a ridiculous price for it. Also, My market for T-Mobile has 60Mbps down in certain areas but all of you focus way too much on speed, What the fuck are you doing on a mobile phone that you need more then 10-15Mbps? If you are then you're an abusive customer and Verizon and AT&T don't want you anyways and you're the kind of customer who will be the death of T-Mobile by destroying the network. People really need to realize that LTE isn't a replacement for a home internet connection. Basically you need to realize that T-Mobile without rural coverage will always be a budget customer. Trust me I was happy with T-Mobile but when I traveled for vacation it hit me that I just want a phone that always works. T-mobile has far too many dead zones to be reliable."

tmobile,3buaqn,rodalorn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:45:23 2015 UTC,No what this means is if we move a line to a new account the eip for that line is only eligible for transfer for the first 60 days after that transfer.  Also eip can only be transfered once and the new customer needs to have a high enough credit limit to accept it.

Glad to see another Arkansawyer here.
tmobile,3bss20,HITLERS_CUM_FARTS,3,Wed Jul 1 23:42:24 2015 UTC,I'm living in fort Smith for the summer... Once I leave city limits I can kiss data goodbye haha
tmobile,3bss20,zakats,2,Thu Jul 2 02:10:06 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I hadn't forgotten. That makes 3 of us so far, maybe 4.  It seems pretty silly that i40 between Eufaula, OK and Conway, AR isn't mostly covered yet. Also, Fort Smith and Van Buren's i40 coverage is pretty over-stated on the tmo map- have you noticed?"
tmobile,3bss20,HITLERS_CUM_FARTS,3,Thu Jul 2 03:07:15 2015 UTC,"Waaay overstated. Im from okc and go home each weekend and I spend bout half of the drive either with 1bar of 2g or with no signal at all. There's plenty of spots where my calls are guaranteed to drop. I knew I'd have problems with high speed data in some spots but not having cell coverage on a major highway seriously concerns me. I will say though that I've noticed the LTE ranges are expanding, though the dead zones are still present and it does not fallback gracefully from LTE to 2g. It drops off entirely then searches for new signal. Very annoying tbh"
tmobile,3bss20,zakats,2,Thu Jul 2 03:21:22 2015 UTC,"Very annoying tbh   Agreed. There have been lots of improvements popping up in OK though, just much not where you and I want them. Did you see the microwave application map that was posted here within the last few weeks? There were microwave applications for at least one place east of the intersection of 40 & 69 so we know that this area is getting an upgrade in the near future. According to Sensorly, the area I had in mind seems to have better LTE than what the Tmo map lets on so it might have already been upgraded."
tmobile,3bss20,musicisme,3,Thu Jul 2 03:33:45 2015 UTC,Omg someone who clearly understands my pain. But have you noticed most of NWA has amazing coverage now.
tmobile,3bss20,zakats,3,Thu Jul 2 10:06:18 2015 UTC,I mapped a lot of it with sensorly :)  But there's still plenty left to be desired.
tmobile,3bss20,danrant,2,Thu Jul 2 14:46:09 2015 UTC,Do you have a phone that can show band/EARFCN? This sighting looks real but I'd like to have a confirmation with engineering mode info.
tmobile,3bss20,zakats,2,Wed Jul 8 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"I have an Alcatel Astro with SignalCheck Pro. In spite of my best efforts to find access to the ""Engineermode"" (the name of the app under Applications in the settings) function, or to get Acatel USA to provide me with the code, I'm not able to get proper info from any such engineering menu. As far as I can deduce from the usual 'must be band 12' indicators, SignalCheck seems to be accurate.  I don't visit Little Rock very often so I'm not sure I'd be able to confirm that anytime soon but I ought to be able to confirm /u/NoMeGustav's claim north of, and possibly in, Fort Smith in the coming weeks."

tmobile,3bsmh1,ProfessorRobinson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:39:53 2015 UTC,Same thing I do except sometimes do a factory reset (+ back up everything) if I feel necessary. Last thing you want is for it to be something small (like a sim card) and then have the same problem with the replacement phone which then creates more frustration.  I would say the key to finding a good rep is if you see they offer to follow-up or give you an email to follow-up on. Even with something as simple as a troubleshoot.
tmobile,3bsmh1,clipsound,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"given her phone is a few weeks old, a factory reset seems pretty extreme.  we've been to hell and back w/tmobile. our Galaxy S5s had massive, massive problems with wifi calling and SMS messages being ""backlogged"", etc -- so we upgraded at the request/suggestion of tmobile exec service and now we just have new problems. it's really frustrating."

tmobile,3bts6u,wwtectmo,4,Thu Jul 2 02:16:00 2015 UTC,I am not sure about I-77 and I-79.  I did drive through West Virginia on 64 in March 2014 using T-Mobile and my Nexus 5. I spent the entire time roaming on AT&T and had no problems with my conversations. I spoke to three different people for a total of around 2 hours. I hope your experience is as good as mine. Edit: Don't plan on using data. My Google Maps ran out real quick with the low data roaming limit.
tmobile,3bts6u,akchicken,3,Thu Jul 2 02:27:16 2015 UTC,"My Google Maps ran out real quick with the low data roaming limit.

tmobile,3bts6u,zakats,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:27:36 2015 UTC,I'd say dont bet your job on T-mobiles coverage in WV. I go skiing there every year and definitely loose all cell service during the drive a few times. We do get off of 77 and hit some 2 lane highways but I think I remember there being holes in coverage on 77 through some parts of WV. Good luck.

I've been a happy T-Mobile customer for about 8 years now, and in just the last few months I've seen more issues than the last 8 years. And actually just as I tried to post this, my cellspot router stopped working. Who knows if it's their network messing with the software, or it's just another piece of junk."

tmobile,3bpdcb,quackerz,11,Wed Jul 1 02:46:31 2015 UTC,"Well I've had TMobile for about 7 months, and the 'sporatic' issues are more than just a nuisance. Texting is pretty much the main method of communication people use nowadays, and for it to be 'down' or not working properly for multiple hours on many occasions is not something that can be brushed off easily. People are rightfully losing their minds over something like this, especially when it seems to be happening at a more frequent rate."
tmobile,3bpdcb,purplemountain01,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"It's literally the least reliable form of communication on any carrier. Use WhatsApp, BBM, fb messenger, hangouts, I message, group me, kik, anything else.. I hate when it doesn't work too, but cellular is an imperfect technology, and I guess I'm more accepting of that overall."
tmobile,3bpdcb,Clutch_22,5,Wed Jul 1 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"All of those things require the person you are communicating to use that platform as well. If I'm texting someone, chances are they're not going to be using KIK nor are they going to take the time out of their day to download the app and open an account just to talk to me.. I've never had any texting issues with any other carrier- one time iMessage went down for about 30 mins and that was it. But on multiple occasions with T-Mobile I will have texts duplicating, arriving 30 minutes later, not going through at all, or coming in/going out out of order.  It's something that T-mobile really needs to improve or come up with a solution."
tmobile,3bpdcb,Lotr1212,6,Wed Jul 1 03:10:03 2015 UTC,"I've had many issues with the duplicate messages, or delayed messages too. People get concerned when they don't hear from you, but you never knew they even sent the message because you get it 2 hours later. Not everyone is in a situation when they can call and check up on you, while texting is generally easier to do."

tmobile,3bpdcb,Lotr1212,5,Wed Jul 1 03:17:32 2015 UTC,When that happens you can't even have a conversation because you don't know if they got your message or you got theirs. And it's especially fun when they arrive out of order so you have to decode what they're saying
tmobile,3bpdcb,Andromina,2,Wed Jul 1 03:25:21 2015 UTC,"I've had all the issues you mentioned and I've been a T-Mobile customer from 7 months as well.

tmobile,3bpdcb,hiromasaki,0,Wed Jul 1 03:08:04 2015 UTC,VoIP and IM's are very reliable. It's why I use GV. All these SMS and MMS problems people have been having over the months I don't get. SMS and MMS in general are just horrible and unreliable.
tmobile,3bpdcb,purplemountain01,2,Wed Jul 1 05:53:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind as much if it were communicated that these issues were happening and what was being done to prevent them from happening in the future.  I also wouldn't mind if my messages were still sent and delivered, but every time this happens I tend to just never see the messages.  SMS and MMS are a shit technology.  Until there's a decent cross-platform messaging services that's drop-in (ie. no contacts list, I just open the app and my contacts are there, I can send them pictures and video larger than 800KB, messages of any length, etc etc), SMS is the best solution.  It pains me to say that but let's be real -  it's the only cross-device messaging service that works out of the box and doesn't depend on others downloading apps and signing up for a service.  Until it's replaced it's all we have, and I'd rather not see SMS/MMS issues once a week."

Like I said, nothing is perfect and every service has the occasional downtime. I understand that, once in a while is not unreasonable. I live in a dead zone so I rely on wifi calling to be able to even use my phone, and that alone has been problematic with all the recent outages and reliability issues concerning it."
tmobile,3bpdcb,Kar98_Byf42,2,Wed Jul 1 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"well to be honest the router is being powered by your home internet so i dont see how that is t-mobiles fault.. its also a damn good router for the price! but yeah but yeahh ive been having text issues as well. got some messages throughout the day from a group message from friday when we were planning a meet up and some messages just got stuck in ""sending"" or whatever for a few minutes. not all that frustrating for me but i can see how that can be an issue for people"
tmobile,3bpdcb,homestar92,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah the router resolved itself after a few power cycles. T-Mobile pushes the firmware updates to it even though it's an Asus, since its has all their QOS settings and such. It was just good timing that it went out as my texting did, since the rest of my network was still up. I guess I was just frustrated and blamed it on them before doing the troubleshooting I should have. Wifi-calling has been spotty at best with texting and MMS messages so sometimes it's tough to tell if the router or their network is the issue, even after a few reboots of all the hardware and phones."

tmobile,3bsj8v,anwserman,2,Wed Jul 1 20:22:07 2015 UTC,"As for WiFi calling, you can get a free enhanced router for free from T-Mobile customer support (as a loan), or buy it at a T-Mobile store for $99.  The router is a really nice ASUS one that retails for $200 bucks.  It prioritizes Wifi calls.  If your router is old, it might not work the best for wifi calling."

tmobile,3bsj8v,anwserman,2,Wed Jul 1 21:41:49 2015 UTC,"-Hawksfire, T-Mobile just launched their newest Band 12 frequency in Denver, and the iPhone 5S doesn't support it - neither does the iPhone 6/6 Plus.   So what you're experiencing now is during your test drive, is actually much worse than what you'd get on a bleeding-edge phone that supports B12.  If you're considering to switch, wait another month or so until the iPhone6S releases.  It's almost guaranteed to have Band 12 support, and you'll have a much more consistent LTE signal.  Otherwise, T-Mobile does currently offer an array of Android phones and tablets, plus the Nokia 640 (Windows), that supports B12.  You could sign up now with one of these devices, and in 4 months Jump-on-Demand to a new iPhone :)"
tmobile,3bsj8v,anothercookie90,3,Wed Jul 1 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"That's great in theory, but the whole point of doing the test drive was to compare it with my current provider. Even if B12 is supposed to be amazing, it's very difficult for me to switch without trying it, especially with how poor the call quality has been so far, which is what I have to assume it will be like when I am not in areas with B12 coverage."
tmobile,3bsj8v,Logvin,5,Wed Jul 1 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  Your mileage may vary.  I switched from ATT to TMo in January 2014, and all I have seen with my travels is rapidly improving service,  I have multiple lines, two tablets.  I work from home mostly, and I am very happy with the 21GB of tethering data that I receive :)"
tmobile,3bsj8v,Logvin,2,Wed Jul 1 22:15:32 2015 UTC,was the call quality poor on wifi calling or in general?   did you get a good enough signal to make calls where you were using wifi calling?
tmobile,3bsj8v,Marshall_St,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:27:41 2015 UTC,"I only tried wifi calling a few times and my call was always disconnected within minutes, so it was difficult for me to gauge the quality. I was mainly referring non-wifi calling. At home, I was always close enough to my router that the signal should have been very strong."
tmobile,3bsj8v,Marshall_St,3,Thu Jul 2 02:53:59 2015 UTC,"What do you define as ""poor call quality""? that is a pretty vague statement."
tmobile,3bsj8v,Logvin,2,Thu Jul 2 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"I have yet to see my signal strength go above -105 dBm and it is usually closer to -120. Non-wifi calls were not disconnecting, but at times it was very difficult to understand what the other person was saying or audio would cut out completely for a few seconds."
tmobile,3bsj8v,Marshall_St,5,Thu Jul 2 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying. Signal Strength means absolutely nothing. Either you have signal, or you do not. That's all.  As far as the audio cutting out, that is a real issue. Was it only happening at your house? If so, T-Mobile will provide a free signal booster that you can put in your house. As others have said, the 5S isnt exactly the best device on our network, even the iPhone 6 does a better job. We should really change out Test Drive device, right?"

tmobile,3bqi8e,acrolos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:22:44 2015 UTC,It's t-mobile's messed up app. I have a unlimited plan but got that message every month even with as little as only 4GB used.   Get that garbage off your phone.
tmobile,3bqi8e,memtiger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:06:08 2015 UTC,"Something is wrong here, it's not throttling or being deprioritized. Your account should never say ""0.0 GB High Speed."" It should have a number or show Unlimited.  OP: call 611, ask specifically what data feature is on your line. If it's the Unlimited + 7 GB Hotspot plan, which you say it should be, ask to be transferred to Tech Care and talk to them about your issue."
tmobile,3bqi8e,NexusPhan,2,Thu Jul 2 02:19:13 2015 UTC,I spoke to one of them. I hardly used the hotspot( i believe i used it to update a few apps on my ipad) i used 27 and change of cell data and less than 1 gig of hotspot... The CSR said I was deprioritized.
tmobile,3bqi8e,memtiger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:25:20 2015 UTC,It says 0.0 high speed data. Are you on a limited plan? Unlimited should just show high speed data without a number
tmobile,3bqi8e,NexusPhan,7,Wed Jul 1 13:45:42 2015 UTC,It also says s/he used 28 GB of data.  I doubt s/he is on a limited plan using 28 GB of data.
tmobile,3bqi8e,memtiger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:48:53 2015 UTC,"I thought that as well, but it is possible.   128kbps = 16KBs  16KBs 24/7 in a 30 day period = around 45GB"
tmobile,3bqi8e,NexusPhan,3,Wed Jul 1 13:59:45 2015 UTC,I am towards the end of the billing cycle if that matters. The first half of the month is when I am getting the best service. It does feel limited after that.
tmobile,3bqi8e,djenglish2014,3,Wed Jul 1 14:45:10 2015 UTC,"In their Terms of Service, you can be throttled at the 21GB mark if the tower you're on is congested.    Protective Measures: To provide the best possible experience for the most possible customers and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we take certain steps to manage our network, including, but not limited to, prioritizing the data usage of Unlimited high-speed data customers who use more than 21 GB of data during a billing cycle below that of other customers in times and locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources for the remainder of their billing cycle. Where the network is lightly loaded in relation to available capacity, a customer whose data is de-prioritized will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority."
tmobile,3bqi8e,shesaidcunt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware of this,  s they claimed full unlimited when I signed up.  Does streaming music still count toward that 21gb?  I looked at my usage and it claims I've used a gig and a half of data,  but nearly all of that has been streaming music on Spotify."
tmobile,3bqi8e,themanwithsomename,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:00:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure on that, but probably. 99.9% of users don't use over 21GB/month, so it's not typically relevant for almost all of their users. That's one reason why they don't being it up."
tmobile,3bqi8e,shesaidcunt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:33:41 2015 UTC,"That's not what they're doing here according to OP.  If it was, it would be a non-issue.  This is nothing but pure (illegal) throttle."
tmobile,3bqi8e,Scarfacemario,3,Wed Jul 1 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that the message sounds like it, but their TOS says otherwise. I'm not sure which is the actual case. This could just be a poorly worded message on the app.  Once you cross the 21GB line, you pretty much will have slower internet than everyone else because of prioritization unless you are one of the few on the tower. He can test this by doing a Speed Test around 5AM."
tmobile,3bqi8e,ThrowAwayNYS,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:48:29 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this is due to the new unlimited hotspot at reduced speeds and the message is only referring to hotspot high speed data?  If this really isn't a throttle, the message is worded horrifically."
tmobile,3bqi8e,nauticalfiesta,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"He said below that he hasn't tethered this month, so who knows. Seems hard to believe that people get up to 30GBs on their phone without tethering or torrenting.  And if he were fully throttled at 21GB to their 2G network, the internet would be so painful, that it wouldn't be worth using for the other 7GB that he's apparently used."
tmobile,3bqi8e,madcadd1e,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:59:45 2015 UTC,Who said it was fully throttled at the 21GB mark?  Could have been de-prioritized at 21GB and throttled at 28GB.  I have a lot more questions than answers right now.
tmobile,3bqi8e,skyxsteel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:06:39 2015 UTC,I've used this much data and do not have this message.  Looks like OP is not on truly unlimited.
tmobile,3bqi8e,MobileThrowawayAcc,3,Wed Jul 1 13:52:01 2015 UTC,His data section suggests he is. Mine reads the exact same way and I am on the unlimited plan..
tmobile,3bqi8e,NexusPhan,3,Wed Jul 1 14:48:17 2015 UTC,I believe it reads that way for everyone. I'm on the 3GB plan and it still reads that way.
tmobile,3bqi8e,McShoggoth,2,Wed Jul 1 15:11:26 2015 UTC,Thanks. I find it odd that I would be throttled. There are two more lines that I added which don't have unlimited data. Perhaps a confusion in the system?
tmobile,3bqi8e,jschubart,3,Wed Jul 1 15:07:08 2015 UTC,Have you called them?
tmobile,3bqi8e,jschubart,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:19:44 2015 UTC,I did. I was deprioritized.

That's usually a few hours of netflix each night on two computers plus an hour or two on the Roku, and I run an internet business off of it too.

tmobile,3bqi8e,Domini384,8,Wed Jul 1 19:11:27 2015 UTC,it's always the ones that abuse the unlimited data that complain the most... I feel no sympathy for him. I am baffled as to how anyone even uses that much data...
tmobile,3bqi8e,shesaidcunt,2,Wed Jul 1 19:25:39 2015 UTC,"But in relation to OP's usage, 28GB I don't think should be considered  abuse territory."

tmobile,3bqi8e,greatcaffeine,-6,Wed Jul 1 19:08:04 2015 UTC,"At least it's not this  I'll take 28GB with generally LTE speeds over 600Kbps max video speed any day.  However, that does suck.  I'm currently at 26 GB + 3.7GB tethering (legit) and last month i used into the 30's or more.  Just hoping not to get hit with slow downs.  You may want to call or chat with them and find out if this is deprioritization or if your plan is not the one you thought it was."
tmobile,3bqi8e,niftydl,7,Wed Jul 1 14:27:06 2015 UTC,Well I pay $20 extra for unlimited data so I'm not sure why T-mobile would do this...

tmobile,3bs8ta,thatSunset,10,Wed Jul 1 18:58:33 2015 UTC,I would recommend Cellmapper and Sensorly.
tmobile,3bs8ta,50atomic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:38:21 2015 UTC,Thanks. I think I will try the cellmapper one. Sensorly feels more commercial.
tmobile,3bs8ta,niftydl,4,Wed Jul 1 21:49:12 2015 UTC,"They are both helping get realistic coverage maps and tower location out in public view. If you are going to be driving and have the phone plugged in, there is no reason you can't run both at the same time."

I would just buy a local sim in that case. I just mean to compete with Project Fi which gives you 256kbps (which uses T-Mobile and Sprint) , would help a lot."
tmobile,3btsg7,Inspirasion,5,Thu Jul 2 07:12:58 2015 UTC,I don't think just adding Apple Music to Music Freedom is enough to qualify as an Amped move. They add new services all of the time with little fanfare.  The only way to Amp Global would be free voice calls and I can't see that.  I think the next logical Amped announcement is a better test drive. Longer duration and/or more devices to choose from.

tmobile,3btsg7,Marshall_St,0,Thu Jul 2 19:21:21 2015 UTC,Officially adding Apple Music to Music Freedom is my guess for part of next Amped.  Prob add a couple more services and maybe another deal like they have with Rhapsody with another service.

tmobile,3bseke,NexusPhan,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:39 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's true.

tmobile,3bseke,Domini384,3,Wed Jul 1 19:46:31 2015 UTC,The bands weren't locked out. It wasn't approved by the FCC in time of release. The next one will for sure have it though.
tmobile,3bseke,stevehobbes,3,Wed Jul 1 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"So, it's not about the modem.  The modem is exactly what it sounds like - it speaks the various protocols (LTE/LTE Advanced, GSM, HSPA, CDMA, etc.) and turns that into TCP data packets for iOS to understand - but it doesn't speak to the towers.  It speaks to to an RF chip, which in turn translates that to and from the antennas as actual RF waves.  That RF chip would need to support band 12, as would the antenna design, and would be a conscious effort by Apple."

If you want to wait out the rest of the service plan call them the day before or two days before and ask them to cancel your service. Normally they will ask why and if you say because of signal issues they will try to troubleshoot it, so simply tell them you want to cancel because you signed up for postpaid that's what I did (though I actually signed up for postpaid.) And no they won't ask about ""your"" postpaid account, since prepaid can't look at postpaid account info anyways."

tmobile,3brgye,Tgwinn,-11,Wed Jul 1 15:46:23 2015 UTC,My goal was to see what others have experienced and too air my disappointment so others might not make the same mistake I did.  Personally a week doesn't seem long enough to fairly evaluate a company's service.  I wanted to give this experiment a genuine chance to succeed.  Unfortunately it's been a miserable failure and I truly regret having switched.
tmobile,3brgye,say592,9,Wed Jul 1 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"If you werent getting reception though, you would see that in the week. Im on my Test Drive right now (about 10 years on VZW as well) and I can already see some spots that suck. However, since Im not seeing dead zones, Im going to proceed. You would have seen dead zones and known not switch.   Your warning isnt not to switch to T-Mobile, it should be to not switch without doing a Test Drive first."
tmobile,3brgye,agn243,2,Wed Jul 1 15:59:31 2015 UTC,Fair enough and good luck.  Would love to hear back from you in a month or so.

tmobile,3brgye,Domini384,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:20:14 2015 UTC,"No complaints over here as well. I just switched to T-Mobile recently after doing the Test Drive, and being a Verizon customer for many years as well. I had decent signal from T-Mobile in all the places that I am regularly at weekly. That was good enough for me to switch, but saving money was the main priority. Like OP said, 1 week for the Test Drive is not a long time to fairly evaluate a company's service, but it's better than none."
tmobile,3brgye,zakats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:34:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a little over a month deep with TMobile (on prepaid no less), and have been to Seattle, Dallas, San Francisco, and all over Southern California.  I still have my Verizon line through work, and I can honestly say that I've not experienced any more issues with my TMobile service than Verizon.  Both have had similar bad areas where I assume no phone really gets service.  Both have had spots where one is better than the other - but I would still say that one is no worse than the other.  The biggest difference to me has been the incredible data speed on TMobile!  It's been much faster than Verizon overall, and more notably, I get data performance in a few areas where my Verizon phone says it has service, but sits dead in the water when you try and use data.  As with any cell service though, it all depends on where you use it."

tmobile,3brgye,Logvin,4,Wed Jul 1 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"being the IT guy in the house this is somehow my fault.   Every little thing that happens to be different... Yes, I can relate.   IPhones tend to have lesser signal quality compared to many other devices but I don't think this is quite the issue you're facing.   I'm sure there are many factors to be considered here but I'll just say that YMMV and tmo is a good carrier for lots of people so there may just be an issue in your locale."

I also have Note 4 and it, of course, is still on the garbage 5.0.2 release and can't reliably use LTE signal even at the same exact location where Galaxy S5 can (Note 4 stays at HSPA and can't even use ""HD Voice"", whereas freshly updated Galaxy S5 stays at LTE in same exact place and can use HD Voice/VoLTE all the time).

All of the 5 users on my account reported a significant drop in network speed and availability right away.  Because of the significant difference in cost I told them you get what you pay for and to deal with it.  However at this point their constant complaining and my frustration is more painful than the hit to my wallet was with Verizon.

tmobile,3brgye,Logvin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile has more infrastructure in the Phoenix area than any other carrier. The problem is a lack of low-band spectrum.

I live in Minneapolis and it's almost flawless here, the last time I was in Phoenix my phone worked ok but I was having trouble streaming music on the freeway without it buffering. And obviously that wasn't a low band problem.  Rootmetrics claims TMobile is the best carrier in Phoenix: http://www.rootmetrics.com/us/rsr/phx-airport/2014/1H#!    Edit: Looks like I was looking at the old report. However, since things changed, it certainly reinforces the idea that tmobile got more subscribers and that caused it to get worse. Here's the most recent one: http://www.rootmetrics.com/us/rsr/phx-airport/2015/1H  Which puts Verizon at 1 with 98.3, and TMobile at 2 with 93.7. Still puzzling that it's #2 though.

Here's what I got:   You bought a ""4g""  HSPA+ phone You had a 1gb plan then your data resets in 3 days? Are you over your cap? You downloaded a single, 30GB app... I'm not aware of any app above a few GBs. OP meant MB.  You downloaded this 30GB MB of stuff on wifi or on cellular and it took a long time? You said you mainly used wifi so it wouldn't seem to go along with your saying something about 1gb of data on your plan If you have a non-LTE phone, it makes sense for you to have an issue with speed... H+ isn't very fast in a lot of places, that's what LTE is for. Tmo is shifting their resources to LTE to provide more speed and capacity. For a better data experience, get an LTE device. What phone did you get? Can you return it? Would you be willing to pay $100 and get a $50 mail-in-rebate back? If so, the LG Leon might be for you. Deprioritization if for those on truly unlimited plans. Your speed issues are due to your phone not having LTE   Pretty still a bit confused here. I think we're still missing some information.

Any cloud services that make automatic copies of things on your computer may be a problem. Close all open apps that you're not using.  It's harder on a Mac because there is no like settings pane to see which apps are using your Internet connection and just how much they're using. Things like iTunes checking for updates or even the system OS checking for updates can run in the background.  However, if you only have like iTunes and Safari open and you're only doing light browsing, you'll be more than okay. Back when I was on AT&T, I had to tether because my home Internet went out. I was so terrified because I only had a 2GB data limit, but after about two hours of browsing Reddit I only managed around 119MB of data usage.

tmobile,3brztw,icepick_,9,Wed Jul 1 17:55:09 2015 UTC,"Uff.   This is a sticky kind of problem, one that there are no easy answers for.  First, the problem:  Tens of thousands of people.   100k+ for something like this.    Packed in a small-ish area.  That area would normally be covered by a sector, or possibly up to 3, from outside the grounds.   All calling/texting/data-ing.   20x20 is good, but in a situation like this, it's still not enough.   That air interface (as the phone-tower link is named) is a limiting factor.  Backhaul to the site is a limitation normal, but not in this situation.   Doesn't matter if we've got a gigabit to the site, when the air interface caps out at 150 mbps.  The site hardware also has a hard cap on the number of simultaneous users.    User 1 to User X all get a slice of what's available.  User X+1 gets told to try again later.  The only solution to situations like this is to split the load between sectors.  Generally, the only effective way of doing that is a DAS.  Instead of the area being covered by a couple of sectors, the area will be covered by a couple of dozen sectors.  Is there DAS at Daytona?  I don't know."

tmobile,3brztw,icepick_,4,Wed Jul 1 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"Do you know of any major sporting events that have that DAS setup?   Individual events never get a DAS.  They'll sometimes get a temporary site set up (a COW, cell on wheels).  Venues, stadiums, race tracks, convention centers, casinos, etc get DAS.   They cost a lot, both to put in, and to lease, but once you have it, you have it for everything that goes on in that space.  We have one in my area, with a couple of more in development."

The bigger question is, is T-Mobile on this DAS? Don't know. I wasn't able to find out if T-Mobile got on this DAS or not, I was able to find information that says Verizon and AT&T are on it, but nothing about T-Mobile or Sprint.

However, they do note they have Wi-Fi deployed throughout the speedway as well, with the DAS, so you should at least have Wi-Fi to use.   EDIT - Based upon this PDF document, on page 30, it looks like only Verizon Wireless and AT&T participated in the DAS system, so Sprint and T-Mobile are not on the DAS, but Wi-Fi should be good.

tmobile,3boa0g,magentafullsoul,3,Tue Jun 30 23:55:49 2015 UTC,Just request the letter. Not much else I can do by having you give me your info haha. You might not be able to track your new phone but just request the letter for future packages. I love my choice. It's very convenient and useful.    Edit: love the downvotes. If you think you have a better solution is love to hear it. Arses.
tmobile,3boa0g,Thundertime88,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:00:51 2015 UTC,"mine is coming in tomorrow. tracking via UPS. if you sign up on UPS my choice or something like that, UPS tells you that you have packages shipping to your house."
tmobile,3boa0g,magentafullsoul,2,Tue Jun 30 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"Mine still says the label hasn't been scanned in yet but says the delivery date is tomorrow? I'm praying the package isn't lost, it fucking blows when that happens :("
tmobile,3boa0g,Thundertime88,3,Wed Jul 1 02:41:48 2015 UTC,i checked the tracking on mine and it says it started in WA and now it's in KY. I'm like wtf?
tmobile,3boa0g,magentafullsoul,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:54:43 2015 UTC,Mine is saying the same thing

tmobile,3boa0g,Thundertime88,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:00:51 2015 UTC,I was won of the first winners and haven't received my phone yet. Nothing in UPS mychoice either.
tmobile,3boa0g,corneliusdevun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:25:54 2015 UTC,Ask for a tracking #. They gave me one yesterday
tmobile,3boa0g,kanka2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm gonna try that. They said that they were shipping the phones out as fast as they could and would keep me updated. I just don't want to miss the package, though I see that its being left without requiring a signature."
tmobile,3boa0g,shesaidcunt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:09:49 2015 UTC,yea I got mines like a couple minutes ago...
