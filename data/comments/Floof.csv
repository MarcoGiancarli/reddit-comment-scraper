Floof,3e3ezk,Shaked_N_Baked,3,Tue Jul 21 17:33:13 2015 UTC,Too cute!!
Floof,3e3ezk,Iabiel,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:26 2015 UTC,Its eyes command you to snuggle it!
Floof,3e3ezk,TextofReason,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:56 2015 UTC,The look in the eyes is the moment I decide to be in/of the floof and get rejected. Every time.
Floof,3e3ezk,smjohns91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:29 2015 UTC,Catnip saucer eyes are the best.
Floof,3e1cd3,earlysong,30,Tue Jul 21 05:03:28 2015 UTC,One-eyed Floof. Amazing.
Floof,3e1cd3,kasukali,7,Tue Jul 21 06:54:44 2015 UTC,He could be called Floofy Wap

Floof,3e1cd3,MedicalCat,19,Tue Jul 21 11:50:12 2015 UTC,I could tame the fuck out of that floof.  By placing my face directly into it.
Floof,3e1cd3,feralstank,13,Tue Jul 21 14:37:55 2015 UTC,I practice this method frequently.
Floof,3e1cd3,feralstank,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I bet your pirate ship of a Catptain says says something like, ""Welcome aboard matey."""
Floof,3e1cd3,Chocobean,18,Tue Jul 21 15:17:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks everyone. Here is a bonus picture of Marten (also referred to as 'le floof') on top of the fridge.   https://i.imgur.com/319DMWX.jpg"
Floof,3e1cd3,Chocobean,6,Tue Jul 21 15:52:22 2015 UTC,What's the story on his permanent wink? :D so cuteeeee
Floof,3e1cd3,Chocobean,11,Tue Jul 21 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"I got him off craigslist! He got very sick as a baby and had to have the eye out, so the breeder put him up for free online. I've had him since he was a teeny tiny floof :)"
Floof,3e1cd3,nbreg,8,Tue Jul 21 16:56:16 2015 UTC,Awwww that's so nice! I'm glad he got someone to adopt him instead of ....culling. :(   So floofy!! Does he run into things cuz he has poor depth perception?
Floof,3e1cd3,hazelnox,4,Tue Jul 21 17:10:02 2015 UTC,No! Everyone asks that haha. He is surprisingly graceful.
Floof,3e1cd3,bobbertmiller,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:20 2015 UTC,Meanwhile perfectly healthy floofys can be silly as heck. :D go figure!!
Floof,3e1cd3,shadow_catt,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"Pics of teeny tiny floof? I hear the floof doesn't assume puff form until a single moment in puberty, like a sudden first boner or period."
Floof,3e1cd3,Foibles5318,5,Tue Jul 21 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"This is the earliest picture I could find, a few weeks after I got him. 3 months old here :) https://i.imgur.com/vaQuXBA.jpg"

Floof,3e1cd3,srslyrenee,8,Tue Jul 21 11:20:08 2015 UTC,What a cutie face! So hairy. So glorious. So....  Winky.
Floof,3e1cd3,tabsmack,7,Tue Jul 21 13:20:08 2015 UTC,Beautiful chunkachunk.
Floof,3e1cd3,blinkisnaked,4,Tue Jul 21 07:03:42 2015 UTC,That is indeed some hardcore floof.
Floof,3e1cd3,hapsly,4,Tue Jul 21 11:01:41 2015 UTC,He is a majestic floofball.
Floof,3e1cd3,hapsly,5,Tue Jul 21 11:10:04 2015 UTC,"OH MY GOD, HE LOOKS LIKE A PRECIOUS KITTY-SHAPED CLOUD & I WANT HIM TO RAIN DOWN CUDDLES UPON ME."
Floof,3e1cd3,SienaBlaze,3,Tue Jul 21 18:34:16 2015 UTC,Glory to the floof
Floof,3e1cd3,jejhewtun,4,Tue Jul 21 14:47:20 2015 UTC,Marten looks like an adorable dusty cotton ball.
Floof,3e3e3a,Flaccid_enchiladas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:18 2015 UTC,Freeze a bottled water and toss it next to a hot floof. Makes them very happy.
Floof,3e0rdd,dinosauru,13,Tue Jul 21 01:55:51 2015 UTC,Alternate view for maximum floof.  She purrs up a storm if you bury your face in her fluffles and blow hot air on her belly.  ....Not that I've ever done such a thing.
Floof,3e0rdd,feralstank,3,Tue Jul 21 02:00:25 2015 UTC,"My god, the fabled floofasaurus rex.  Quickly, more photos!  Video!  Music albums of this rare creature!"
Floof,3e0rdd,feralstank,3,Tue Jul 21 07:54:20 2015 UTC,"More pictures?? Can do!  Here's Beeps high as balls in the incubator at the vet.  Here's Beeps looking like a majestic beast.  Here's Beeps when I had to shave her last summer.  Here's Beeps unabashedly laying on shoes. ಠ_ಠ  Here's Beeps taking a nap like a little princess.  Here's Beeps roaring with bestial vigor.  I seriously need to make a soundcloud of her ridiculous noises... Her real name is Genevieve, but we call her Beeps for a reason. (She's like a pokemon, she can only say her own name. And she does. Constantly.)"
Floof,3e0rdd,PugglePrincess,3,Tue Jul 21 08:58:05 2015 UTC,"You are a generous catgod.  Also, /r/tuckedinkitties would like a word with you about that nap picture :3"
Floof,3e0rdd,SienaBlaze,3,Tue Jul 21 11:57:20 2015 UTC,Ooh.
Floof,3e0rdd,SienaBlaze,3,Tue Jul 21 12:09:48 2015 UTC,"""Yes yes, that's nice. Now put down the camera and go back to petting me. You're wasting precious energy on an activity that isn't cuddles."""
Floof,3e0rdd,TomBosleyExp,5,Tue Jul 21 07:02:56 2015 UTC,It's so true... she cries like I'm literally hurting her if I'm not touching her at all times.
Floof,3e0rdd,mfisch4,3,Tue Jul 21 07:08:59 2015 UTC,What a cute puffy pie! Kitty looks sooo sweet!
Floof,3e0rdd,ukdanae,5,Tue Jul 21 07:47:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks, she is the sweetest! She is EXTREMELY chatty with extensive intonation to her meows, so I'm pretty sure she believes she is holding conversations with me. She especially likes to run into the room and sing along with me when I sing.   She also knows and enthusiastically obeys vocal commands like ""come on"", ""no"", and ""go on"" (we play red-light green-light -- she's really good at it!). Trying to teach her ""roll over"" now, but honestly she already does it constantly without me telling her to.  She also loves to play fetch with little balls I make out of her fur.  Overall, she is pretty much the best, albeit most ridiculous cat."
Floof,3e0rdd,ukdanae,4,Tue Jul 21 08:25:44 2015 UTC,You seem like a very loving parent! Kitty is very lucky to have you! I'm sure you guys are the best of friends. :)))))
Floof,3e0uua,IHeartMustard,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:39 2015 UTC,He's got to be the most laid-back cat ever.
Floof,3e0uua,Snatch_Pastry,2,Tue Jul 21 05:43:31 2015 UTC,She is very chill :)

Floof,3e0nbi,David-Puddy,3,Tue Jul 21 04:37:54 2015 UTC,Now with photographic proof! http://imgur.com/VCFuP2K
Floof,3e0nbi,David-Puddy,2,Tue Jul 21 04:53:30 2015 UTC,"So not quite a 14?  I always thought it was in inches, for American sizes. I'm a size 12 and my feet are just about exactly a foot long"

Floof,3dy2h3,Foibles5318,3,Mon Jul 20 17:45:04 2015 UTC,She didn't get up. That means she wants you to bring it to her.
Floof,3dy2h3,matts2,3,Mon Jul 20 19:54:51 2015 UTC,She actually rolled herself over and took off .5 seconds after my brother snapped this photo. She's chubby but she will always run for food.
