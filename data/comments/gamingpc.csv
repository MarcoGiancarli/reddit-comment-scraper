I've personally used a single normal thickness 140mm rad to cool a GTX580 and i7-4770k, both were OC'd.    A 2x 120mm radiator should be more than capable of cooling an i7 and 980ti  and allow the card to boost still."

gamingpc,3e1w2l,Dr_Nic_T61,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:30:05 2015 UTC,a 240mm radiator should keep a High end GPU and an overclocked CPU Cool while allowing plenty of overclocking headroom.  It wont be breaking any world records but it will allow for an i7 and a GTX980ti to still boost its clocks.
gamingpc,3e1w2l,Supernormalguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"I've used that case before. I don't know how a person would fit multiple radiators in there. You can barely fit a 120 rad, if you have flexible tubing of a small diameter. It basically coils on top of the motherboard, around the pump. And that's with the stock 15mm case fan. It won't work with the standard 25mm. At 4.13 inches, the case simply isn't wide enough to accommodate the motherboard, pump, standard case fan, and radiator stacking on top of each other. And the rad won't fit anywhere else. And the fan definitely has to be oriented to push out, or else you suck a bunch of heat into the case, with no viable exhaust.  The similar looking units from Digital Storm, like the Bolt are an inch and a half wider, specifically because of this. Custom made.  If you want a 240, you'll need a completely different form factor, as far as I know. Like Corsair's 250D or one of the Bitfenix jobs. More cube shaped."
gamingpc,3e1w2l,Ottetal,4,Tue Jul 21 23:54:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's possible to use this to cool two gpus instead of one gpu and one cpu  On second thought, its gonna need to cool REALLY well for me to consider that. I just have no idea where to start for a custom loop"
gamingpc,3e1w2l,Supernormalguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:22 2015 UTC,"So in this can someone explain how this works when the fan is cooling the non RAM components of the card? Generally with these AIO coolers, it comes with some heatsink/bracket to help cool the RAM on the card.. so technically wouldn't this be bad?"
gamingpc,3e1w2l,StellaTerra,4,Tue Jul 21 13:01:16 2015 UTC,"RAM chips will often be just fine without any active cooling, since they often can handle much higher temperatures than the GPU. Its the voltage regulation and mosfets that needs cooling - which the fan takes care of."
gamingpc,3e1w2l,GiantRobotMonkey,2,Tue Jul 21 13:19:41 2015 UTC,You need passive heatsink for vram usually. I don't like it honestly

gamingpc,3e1w2l,savagelaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:14 2015 UTC,"This design for the GPU cooler is very similar to the Kraken G10. One thing to bear in mind is that the VRMs aren't fuaranteed to be on the right side of the CPU. Most 970s have their VRMs towards the PCI bracket side, placing them outside of the range of help from the fan. Note that even if it does blow over your VRMs, you should probably still install a heatsink/heatsinks if your card doesn't come built in with one."

gamingpc,3e1w2l,Makirole,-8,Wed Jul 22 00:06:56 2015 UTC,"My problem is they are sending heater liquid from the CPU to cool the GPU.

gamingpc,3e1w2l,No1Important,11,Tue Jul 21 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't quite work like that with watercooling.  Even on a unit like this, the fluid will be travelling between the components too quickly to heat up considerably.  Obviously it will heat up, but only by a few degrees, which isn't enough to affect the temperature gradient considerably at the waterblocks.  Eventually the systems reaches a sort of temperature equilibrium where no one point in the loop is significantly hotter than another part."

gamingpc,3e0k42,stephenp85,6,Tue Jul 21 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, particularly in the narrow ranges EVGA is advertising here with a $200 price difference. ASIC score and voltage leakage correlate -- assuming an accurate ASIC score, low-ASIC GPUs require more voltage than high-ASIC for the same clock speed. However, that does not necessarily mean a high-ASIC GPU will tolerate higher maximum overclocks, and it does not necessarily mean that you wouldn't reach thermal limits before reaching a max clock tolerance disparity on either the 72 or 80+% ASIC."

gamingpc,3dwvhq,defective,2,Mon Jul 20 14:15:56 2015 UTC,I want to start using three screens in the future for multitasking as well. Can you tell me what monitor stand you're using and if you recommend it?
gamingpc,3dwvhq,TrueNoob101,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"It looks like the stand I use: this stand  It is a pretty good stand. Reasonably priced if that's a concern. One issue, and you can notice it in OP's post if you look closely, the side monitor arms sag a bit. The side monitors will likely be 1/4"" lower than the center monitor. It isn't a huge deal for me, I usually have the side monitors in portrait orientation. If you plan on using this to game across the three this might be an annoyance however.   My brother recently purchased this mount and it seems to solve this issue, though it is more expensive."

So Im sure if I turned it off for a full day or two (or w/e) I would definitely notice more dust.

I had an old model car cabinet in the garden, the glass was triangular in shape so I thought why not do a desk with that shape :) I also like the CBR600RR & sharp looking cars like the Lambos, so they also helped with the ideas. fan idea from the harrier jump jets, also one of my fav planes.

gamingpc,3dobqj,JaStulla,3,Sat Jul 18 22:01:50 2015 UTC,Even though the boiling point is lower than of water the specific heat capacity is almost half of water so even though it is able to heat up rapidly it should cool faster than water. Thermal censors are also inside the boards themselves which doesnt show the true temperature of liquid in the loop so the loop itself should be cooler than whats indicated by the censor by at least 5 degrees. So there wouldnt be any pressure being built up inside the loop and radiator.

gamingpc,3dddhu,cyberjacob,2,Wed Jul 15 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"If you want it to last for future builds, don't get the Enthoo Pro. Pretty crappy build quality compared to say a Fractal Define or NZXT H440."
gamingpc,3dddhu,cuzmonote,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:56:59 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at the Air 240, then there's a something you have to consider if you want ""future-proofing"".  The PCI brackets only go about 20mm past the mounting area.  Meaning that you cannot buy video cards whose PCB boards go past the height of the PCI slot.  If you go any higher than that, then you won't be able to close the side panel.  So your're pretty much stuck with cards like the stock Nvidia cooler, the Gigabyte Windforce, EVGA ACX cooler, or ZOTAC's smaller AMP coolers.  If you're wanting a great mATX case, then take a look at Thermaltake's Core V21.  It supports mATX, but has enough room for anything, and it has the dual chamber design of the Air 240, and 540."

gamingpc,3dddhu,psikeiro,2,Wed Jul 15 21:03:03 2015 UTC,One thing to consider however is that on the box itself you can only connect 3 pin fan headers to it. But it does provide two 3 pin to 4 pin cables so you can connect a few PWM fans to it.
gamingpc,3dddhu,Ottetal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:11:15 2015 UTC,I was sceptical to begin with but went for it and don't regret buying it for a tenner. I have it connected to my CPU header so that I can control all of the fans as a whole and have them running at the same speed. Really small as well so it can fit in the smallest cases.

I didn't know they even had these, but it's a slightly cheaper card with no backplate or led. As far as I can tell the pcb and the cooler is the same.  I actually thought I was getting a G1. I picked it up at Fry's when I was there to grab an MSI 980. This card was $499 with a $20 rebate so I grabbed it on impulse thinking it was a G1 gaming. I didn't realize it wasn't till I was installing and wondering where the hell the back plate was. Its ASIC quality is 83.5% and without any extra voltage it runs at 1520Mhz (I know not the best, but it's still solid) I have never seen it TDP throttle, either. Even with the voltage at +80mV it doesnt seem to like going any higher than 1530. So far I haven't tested above this, but I do know that +300 on the memory is rock stable.  The clocks in GPU-Z for my everyday OC are 1313 base and 1414 boost, but in games and benchmarks it never goes below 1501.  Anyway, long story long, I don't mind that it's not a Gaming because I'm happy with the way it runs. I can force the fans to stay at 50% and it stays around 65c, which is nice, as well.

(haha take what you read on the internet with a grain of salt, right?) After learning more about maxwell oc's and spending today overclocking the right way I've found it to clock to around ~1465 core and so far I'm at 7800 on the memory with no voltage. This is a bit more average, but still pretty solid from what I understand. Still it handles its power really well. Just an example on how ASIC quality doesn't necessarily mean high clocks. I do see the lower temps and power consumption though."

Well no Sir, not at all if you are playing games in the 1080P or 2560x1440 monitor resolution domain as the GTX 970 or 980 is sufficient.

It would only be worth it if we see the power consumption is dramatically less then the 6700k. With every generation of chip I read some where that there is a 50% drop in power consumption for cpu's. But from some internet research it seems this skylake chip is still on the same 14nm process as the broadwell chips so I don't expect to see much improvement in power over those series until the cannonlake chips in 2017 which are supposed to be the 10nm chips according to Wikipedia. Its probably not even worth upgrading if you currently are running a decent Haswell CPU, I'm currently running a Sandy Bridge 2600k (OC 4.3GHz) so I think for me its probably worth the upgrade."

gamingpc,3ctljs,Maniax24,3,Sat Jul 11 10:17:05 2015 UTC,Why did you decide to use the fan on the CPU cooler to blow inside the case?
gamingpc,3ctljs,Valdair,2,Fri Jul 10 22:02:54 2015 UTC,the fan wouldn't go on the other side because of the ram and I assumed looking at the arrows the airflow would go to the left so thats why its positioned like that.
gamingpc,3ctljs,easyghostwriter,2,Fri Jul 10 22:25:08 2015 UTC,"That's a Cooler Master Hyper 212 (or some variant) correct? The fan is just on plastic brackets. You can slide it up a centimeter so that it clears the RAM. It's what I did in my old build and what I did in my girlfriend's computer with the same cooler (although I also got her Cougar Vortexes for a push-pull on the CPU).  If you haven't modified that fan or the brackets it is on in any way, it is definitely competing with that back fan. The arrows do indicate direction of airflow but it would surprise me if, in that configuration, it's actually doing what you want."
gamingpc,3ctljs,skullshark54,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:22:37 2015 UTC,I have the same cooler. It's pushing not pulling I believe.
gamingpc,3ctljs,JaffaCakes6,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:00:43 2015 UTC,The fan on that cooler attaches on the side so the fan is pointing away and towards the back. and towards the other fan.

gamingpc,3cosat,Spawn_Beacon,2,Fri Jul 10 02:04:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it's still just an okay X99 board.   What's okay about it? The advantages of the Godlike board is a 5th PCIEx16 slot, USB 3.1 ports, and a 2nd Ethernet port. The semi-isolated sound PCB is nice too, though it doesn't matter that much.  Beyond that, there are a lot of bells and whistles.  With the Krait, you get all the features to pack a punch, and you don't pay for extra stuff you don't need."
gamingpc,3cosat,subterfug,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:54:43 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what makes it okay.  It has most of the features, but not all.  Just because it won't make difference for most doesn't mean it won't affect some.  For instance, I wouldn't be able to use the X99 Krait in my next build as it doesn't support 4 graphics cards, never mind that + any PCIe based storage."

gamingpc,3cosat,downslayer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:22:51 2015 UTC,If they'd ever make the m2 slot not share resources with stuff you need it might be useful.

It might be kind of cool to have a red themed build and 'breathing' red lights...    If you'd want to put together any other color theme, this'd look stupid - IMO."
gamingpc,3cj9xb,ShuttleXpC,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:09:09 2015 UTC,"from the video, it looks like the red is red paint, and there are rgb led on the board. so basically the feature is pointless for ""customization"" as you will always have it red unless you custom paint it."

gamingpc,3cg7q9,mramazing1992,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:34:39 2015 UTC,You should get an acrylic tube for the top of your reservoir.  You're using the EK Multiport Top but don't have their ~$5 internal tube that screws into the threading on the underside.  This can introduce more air into the loop.  I'd also recommend adding more coolant so the res isn't half full.  Link to EK's short tube:  https://shop.ekwb.com/ek-res-x3-internal-tube-12-16-40mm

I feel that I caught on late and that was in the latter parts of 2012, about the time he started experimenting with crystal link for his Sigularity Beast II build.  The real hardline pioneers were people like B-Neg, TwisterGTX and K.3nny.  Looking back through his builds, none of them really push boundaries.  Cytotoxic was very cool, but nothing particularly special when you think about it.  Some basic mods, hardline tube and a couple loops in a big ol' TJ11."

This is Twister's game changing mod, I linked to the modding update rather than the log as the pictures load better.  K.3nny I just found out used Photobucket as an image host, which means all the photos are now broken :/  This was mine from the same period, never realised how close to the other logs it was.

Its a triple fan design that is only 2 degrees cooler than the blower style reference that has a smaller heatsink and one fan at load. Really bad showing compared to MSI's and Gigabyte's efforts. That said, 1493 on the boost is respectable as an OC, but I can see there being thermal issues when trying to overvolt this card."

gamingpc,3cb0ij,Stormtrooper_OG-420,8,Mon Jul 6 17:49:07 2015 UTC,"Routing that CPU power cable behind the motherboard tray and out at the top would go a long way in making it look neater.   The general rule that I keep to is route cables behind the case immediately from the source, then bring it out again at the destination.   Nice spec though. Why did you go for the 8GB 390?"
gamingpc,3cb0ij,ABigPurpleGoose,4,Mon Jul 6 17:42:01 2015 UTC,"Tried doing that. Sadly, the cable is juuuust a bit too short to go behind the board and reach. The access hole is about 2-3 inches too high."

gamingpc,3cap84,fulthrottlejazzhands,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:11:46 2015 UTC,Should be just around the performance of GTX 980 considering the 20% drop in shaders and ROPs.  TDP and overclocking headroom will be the factors that make or break it vs 980.

While the Fury non-x will be a cut down version of the full Fiji chip, it'll still run at the same clocks as the Fury X. The nano has the same full chip as the Fury X but will have be clocked pretty low to reach that 175W tdp."

I've used Steelseris qck and razor goliathus and this is easily the best one at least out of those.  If you can get past the stupid name and stupid logo you might be in for a surprise.

I ask because your storage options perplex me. You have 8 different storage devices, and none of them are the same (and some aren't that big capacity compared to what's out there).   I don't understand mixing 5400, 5900, and 7200 RPM drives of different capacities.

gamingpc,3bq5jr,Moobyghost,6,Wed Jul 1 12:07:18 2015 UTC,The way it appears to me is a 750ti seems about as powerful as a 660. So each new generation usually the middle number just ticks down one. Seeing as how little the 760 to 960 increase was I don't feel like a 750ti (660ish) upgrade will be much if they make the 950 a low wattage card like they did with the 750(ti). Especially with 2.. You should be good.

gamingpc,3bq5jr,noryork,2,Thu Jul 2 06:35:19 2015 UTC,"Lol, I think we can safely exclude that since not even a single GPU can run that pile of crap."
gamingpc,3bq5jr,Omariscomingyo,2,Thu Jul 2 07:31:22 2015 UTC,"This appears in line with my own purchases across the last decade. I would expect my GTX 470, a GTX 560 Ti, a GTX 650, and the GTX 750 (non-Ti) to all be roughly in step with one another.   The difference being the costs to each of those cards, the amount of new technologies (like GameStream) for those cards, and the TDP or power profile of those cards.  My old machine (an i7 870 with a GTX 470) really required a 600w or higher PSU.  My current ""side rig"" packs a G3258 and a GTX 750 Ti which are just as powerful in gaming, but fits inside of 125w TOTAL power draw, when under load and with all peripheral drives and components active. It literally cannot require any greater electricity. And it cost a fraction of the 2010 machine."
gamingpc,3bq5jr,cardfire,4,Wed Jul 1 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"It depends on a number of factors. 2 660s are obviously going to be limited by their VRAM, which is a shared 2GB between them. In short, those GPUs are going to easily be bottlenecked by the lack of VRAM they have available to draw all those pretty textures you'd otherwise be able to run.  As for whether or not this new card will be an upgrade, I highly doubt it. On the plus side, despite being one of the best selling graphics cards in history, the GTX 660 still sells used for a pretty penny. I might suggest selling both of your cards and opting for the very appealing R9 380 instead, the preliminary tests for which look incredible."
gamingpc,3bq5jr,Oafah,2,Wed Jul 1 15:01:51 2015 UTC,It is starting to feel like two cards are not needed anymore. Maybe i need only the one.
gamingpc,3bq5jr,Moobyghost,2,Wed Jul 1 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't suggest downgrading. Those 660s still scale well now, but they might not in coming months, or years is all."

gamingpc,3bq5jr,Moobyghost,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:51:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, depending on resolution. I also find that SLI is only worth it at the x70 and higher product range, and now only on 1440p+. My experience: SLI 560 was better than single 580 in theory, but the frame pacing and stuttering was terrible and I sold those 560s quickly. I currently have a pair of 970s at 4K with G-Sync and it's amazing with everything I throw at it. If I were at 1080p 60Hz, a single 970 would be more than enough."
gamingpc,3bq5jr,ncook06,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:27:27 2015 UTC,Wait for reviews. I'm assuming its going to be almost as good as a 960 so it would be a marginal upgrade up you unless you have very low VRAM.
gamingpc,3bq5jr,BKachur,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:51:16 2015 UTC,"2GB on each card. I can play everything i have thrown at them on Ultra, so I am not really too concerned, but just going by the numbers, it seems like i am falling behind quick. I do want more VRAM in the future. I want 3-4 on each card eventually."
gamingpc,3bq5jr,Moobyghost,3,Wed Jul 1 11:58:25 2015 UTC,You realize that that VRAM doesn't stack right? So you only have 2GB effectively.
gamingpc,3bq5jr,BKachur,2,Wed Jul 1 12:21:08 2015 UTC,I am now i guess. Why can they not pool it?
gamingpc,3bq5jr,Moobyghost,2,Wed Jul 1 12:36:31 2015 UTC,"I suppose the easiest answer is it takes time to access that extra memory. That time wasted lowers the overall performance of the card, so it ends up not being worth it."
gamingpc,3bq5jr,smoothsensation,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:26:35 2015 UTC,Why do we not see cards with a ton of vram on them? Is it cost only? architecture?
gamingpc,3bq5jr,Moobyghost,2,Wed Jul 1 13:47:55 2015 UTC,"Because it isn't really worth the extra cost. if you put 8GB of a 660 when it was released vs 2gb, it wouldn't increase performance at all. a few years later it would only increase performance on a handful of games at higher resolutions than that card is really even capable of handling. Why would nvidia take a smaller cut, or make a card more expensive only to see the gains for when the card's architecture is being phased out? We now will start seeing more ram on lower end cards (See R7 370 with 4GB and GTX960 with 4GB), since it is feasibly worth it given how much more vram is needed on current games with the trend moving up."
gamingpc,3bq5jr,smoothsensation,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"Will Directx 12 help older cards use both sets of ram on older cards, when SLI'd or is that just something developers will have to work with?"
gamingpc,3bq5jr,Moobyghost,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is one of the things it's supposed to allow developers to do, putting vram in a pool for the game to store and access. We should be able to mix and match video cards too, even across brands, theoretically anyway."
gamingpc,3bq5jr,IsaacM42,2,Thu Jul 2 03:11:05 2015 UTC,"It comes down to how graphics cards work in sli on a fundamental level. They share the data and buffer alternate frames usually. In order to accomplish this they need to pull from an identical pool of memory... hence the shared VRAM.  Apparently in Direct X 12 games they may be able to share VRAM if dev's want to implement that feature.   That said, if your playing at 1080p there are going to be few games that break the 2GB threshold and the only thing you woudl need to do is lower texture quality if it became an issue."
gamingpc,3bq5jr,BKachur,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:33:45 2015 UTC,I have thought about SLIing my old 660 and tried it when it worked it had the same performance as my current 970. I doubt the 950 ti would be worth it for you. Seeing as how a 660 -> 960 is only a 10-15 % in performance.

The ""TI"" label is just branding, and often has nothing to do with the underlying GPU and its association to other cards in the Nvidia catalogue.  For example, the 980 ti isn't a beefed-up 980. It's a cut-down Titan X. On the other hand, the 750 ti is indeed a GM107 GPU, just like it's smaller GTX 750 cousin, but with all of its cores enabled. It really just depends on what Nvidia feels like calling the card based on what they've already put out.  Anyhow, if this is indeed a cut down GM206, it's not very exciting. If it's a refreshed GM107 with similar board power draw and TDP, I'm definitely interested."

gamingpc,3bgiz0,Tactical_Milk_Man,2,Mon Jun 29 07:50:02 2015 UTC,"The problem with imitations is that it takes incredibly less money and effort to take a set of calipers to a part and copy it than is does to go through all of the R&D and produce one.   Its a massive problem in the aftermarket car industry, where a company will spend tens of thousands of dollars into developing something. They then have to include the price of their research into their part to have a chance to recoup their R&D costs. Another company can now buy that part, copy it, and sell one that is functionally identical and even the same quality, but at a drastically lower price.   Of course I'd imagine that the R&D prices for things like computer cases are drastically smaller, but the point still stands."
gamingpc,3bgiz0,thefivetheory,6,Mon Jun 29 16:00:36 2015 UTC,"That doesn't matter to the end-user, though. If I go to the store and buy toothpaste A or toothpaste B, and one is $3 cheaper, do I care that Toothpaste B company just did a chemical analysis of toothpaste A and cloned it? Nope.   What should matter to the end-user is that it means they're getting less ingenuity, less clever products and less good ideas. The PC components industry is rife with this, unfortunately, and I think largely it's the Taiwanese/Chinese mindset. There's no shame in making money - and if Fractal Design sells a shitload of Define R4 cases, then every Taiwanese company (Thermaltake, Cooler Master, etc) will have a knock-off. Hell even some German companies like Nanoxia cloned it. The more American companies, like NZXT, Corsair, etc, will typically try and re-create their own versions or improve upon it, or even better, go in a completely different direction like the H440 or something.   But make no mistake - lack of imagination is bad for the industry at large - both from a corporate and customer standpoint.  Thermaltake should be mocked for their decision to blatantly copy the exteriors of popular other cases. It shows dishonesty and poor ethics - and I don't know that I want to risk my money on a product from a company that may not honor warranties or whatever else. I mean, if they're dishonest on the design side, does that mean they're dishonest on the support side, too?"

These are fantastic fans, the best I've ever used.... I would definitely spend an extra $5-10 for a specific color combo.  If you care about making things fit a color scheme, you'll be willing to pay for it.  It's not like you can paint the fans yourself, too.  If you could, you would definitely waste more money in time spent, including the amount of time fixing your fuckups."

gamingpc,3b446f,billyc74,2,Fri Jun 26 04:50:37 2015 UTC,"The best part is the fact that it's acrylic in my opinion (although they do offer the same model without it and using a aluminum side panel, your aware of right?)  but I'm actually using it to my advantage and I plan on getting a few more sheets of the acrylic laser cut (the little knobs to replace it just unscrew easily) to the same specs, but to also include a custom hole for an additional 140mm fan directly mounted to the window. Mostly because I think it would look super cool, but also because I want to bring my temps down a bit more. (it's a tight build as im sure you can imagine)  Best of luck though regardless man, I really love the case, its super slick and attractive and matches my personal minimalist style. Really the only one aside from the NCASE that did, but they were out of stock when I went to buy and I found this one, which i ended up liking more. (my friend has the NCASE)"
gamingpc,3b446f,ss0889,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:55:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have decided on the UMX1 plus - it is mainly down to if I should get the windowed case or the aluminium side panel one depending on how scratch resistant the window is. I didn't quite gather from your response whether the window is scratching easily or not! ;)   You have got a nice plan with having a fan directly mounted to the window, however for my purpose I don't intend to do any mods. This is probably sacrilege in this forum, but I don't care about displaying the internals -- it just so happens the silver with black window looks nicer to me.  After looking at a whole bunch of cases its really the UMX1 plus's style that matches my taste. Everyone seems to like NCASE -- while its build quality is awesome, to me the shape seems too much like a UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) unit. The Bitfenix pandora is the other one I liked, but it is larger, and the build quality doesn't seem great. Hadron Air was also quite good, although the noisy PSU and fixed drive cage put me off."

I think what I was getting at is, worst case scenerio, not modding, if somehow you did manage to scratch it, you could replace it after doing a few quick measurements and ordering another laser cut one to the exact specs, from a company like ponoko or somthing - you could even do wood, if you were so inclined, and that would be cheap and easy."

Which is very uncool because a common upgrade for stock coolers is better quieter fans (I upgraded my h100i to notura fans)

gamingpc,3b1wx0,buildzoid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:08:27 2015 UTC,The Fury X is based on the same VRM controller as the 290X so software support should be easy unless the card is BIOS locked. If the cards are BIOS locked then there is a problem because AMD has in the past used encrypted BIOSs and those took for ages to mod. Hard modding the Fury X would be pretty easy if the IR gave out proper datasheets for the 3567B but those are only available to people in the industry.

gamingpc,3b1wx0,ElDubardo,0,Thu Jun 25 20:27:12 2015 UTC,My exact thoughts
gamingpc,3b1wx0,Oafah,8,Thu Jun 25 13:25:27 2015 UTC,"The ""just wait for better drivers!"" attitude is akin to people who bought Arkham Knight and cling to hope that the upcoming patch will solve all of their problems; whether or not it works doesn't change the fact that AMD came to the party completely unprepared and undergunned."
gamingpc,3b1wx0,Markbro89,6,Thu Jun 25 14:09:27 2015 UTC,But it is a real possibility. Compare 980ti launch benchmarks with the fury x. 980ti gets beat at nearly every game at 4k. It was the same with the 290x and 780.
gamingpc,3b1wx0,Oafah,3,Thu Jun 25 14:49:26 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt that time equals progress in the driver world. That's always true, and I expect no different in this case. The real issue here is the timing and media hype surrounding the release of the card.  If you recall, back in April, Nvidia released a statement claiming they had the 980ti ""ready to go"" in response to the Fury X. Not only did they deliver, but they actually had it ready for market a whole two weeks ahead of the Fury X, taking a pro-active position against a card that it was meant to rival as a reactionary measure.  In simpler words, Nvidia said ""this is what we're doing"" and they did even better. AMD, on the other hand, said ""Oh yeah? Well this is what we're doing!"" and did markedly worse. Not only did they fail to meet their rival's target, but they also managed to miss their own.  Here's reality: Even if better drivers make the Fury competitive in performance with the 980 ti, the card itself is still just poorly designed with no real intended focus. It's a low-temp, enthusiast grade card with little overclocking potential and locked voltages. It's watercooled, but noisy as all fuck. It's got just 4GB of that lovely HBM, which isn't going to be very relevant for long, and is paired with a GPU that doesn't really seem to require all that added memory bandwidth anyhow.  Long story short, this is an innovative product that was rushed to market and seems conceptually half finished."
gamingpc,3b1wx0,RhombusAcheron,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:03:42 2015 UTC,Why is AMD responsible for the hype? Their actual PR was pretty limited and we can thank the rumor mill and sites like wccftech for drumming up so much excitement.

Also it's worth noting that both cards retail for $650, but the Fury X comes watercooled. Factor in the premium you're paying for that, and the performance per dollar should be about the same or slightly better.  I'm excited to see what's next for them. I imagine 6GB is a must on their future products if they are aiming for the 4K gaming market."
gamingpc,3b1wx0,DoomAxe,0,Thu Jun 25 10:19:34 2015 UTC,How does the fact that it's watercooled change the performance per dollar?  All the reviews I've seen show the Fury X having less overclocking potential than the 980 Ti.
gamingpc,3b1wx0,subterfug,2,Thu Jun 25 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"What is the premium you would have to pay for having a water cooled graphics card?

The card may not beat the 980 Ti flat out, but you are getting a cooler running card which in theory should mean lower case temps and possibly OC potential (PRESUMABLY... don't eat me alive, I haven't looked at temperature benchmarks, but it's a fair expectation)"
gamingpc,3b1wx0,buildzoid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:20:53 2015 UTC,It get's 58C on the core but the fan is very relaxed.

gamingpc,3b1wx0,buildzoid,3,Thu Jun 25 14:07:54 2015 UTC,That's the pump not the fan. The fan is a Nidec Gentle Typhoon
gamingpc,3b1wx0,Oafah,-1,Thu Jun 25 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"Cooler Master makes the waterblock, but not the fan? Also, are you saying the whine is from the pump?"
gamingpc,3b1wx0,buildzoid,3,Thu Jun 25 14:22:04 2015 UTC,Yep the pump is what makes the whine. The fan is from Nidec and is one of the best radiator fans ever made. It's better than the Noctua NF-F12. The only fan that compares to it is the EK Vardar fan and those are based on the Nidec design with some tweaks to static pressure.

gamingpc,3b1wx0,Oafah,2,Thu Jun 25 14:15:17 2015 UTC,It'll take considerable community effort to work around that particular issue if AMD isn't going to patch the vbios themselves. You have to wonder why they'd even make such an obviously counter-intuitive decision in the first place. Why would you release an enthusiast card that overclockers couldn't even tinker with?
gamingpc,3b1wx0,SilverAcez,0,Thu Jun 25 14:19:30 2015 UTC,Your wrong it has a dual bios setup meaning one can be tinkered with and the other is a backup incase it goes wrong.

gamingpc,3b27de,Integrals,3,Thu Jun 25 20:10:49 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting the fact that it's noisy as hell from? The fan itself is supposed to be quiet, and if it's with regards to the pump whine, that's supposedly been fixed with retail units.  And isn't voltage still locked, leading to reduced overclocking capabilities?  AMD definitely fucked up the launch (especially if engineering sent out the wrong driver revisions), but i feel like a lot of the negativity surrounding the card itself is exaggerated."
gamingpc,3b27de,KibblesNKirbs,-3,Thu Jun 25 20:17:22 2015 UTC,"supposedly been fixed with retail units.   Yes ""supposedly"".   And isn't voltage still locked, leading to reduced overclocking capabilities?   The voltage is locked. Which means if you buy this card you are gambling that someone will be able to flash a new bios AND that if/when it is unlocked that it will OC better than the 980ti.  Especially doubtful that it will OC better than the custom PCB 980ti's which costs 20-30$ more.   AMD definitely fucked up the launch (especially if engineering sent out the wrong driver revisions), but i feel like a lot of the negativity surrounding the card itself is exaggerated.   These are minor complaints, but when the cards performance is so similar that's what it comes down to.  I for one see the waterblock as a minus as well, but I know I am in the minority here."
gamingpc,3b27de,Integrals,2,Thu Jun 25 20:32:58 2015 UTC,You're not. AIO is a definite minus for me. If I want water cooking i would rather have it fit with everything else in my loop
gamingpc,3b27de,KrimzonK,2,Fri Jun 26 13:29:16 2015 UTC,"while i agree being forced into an AIO is a bit odd.. it does work well.. Card averages 50 degrees at load where nvidia cards will hit high 70's low 80's.  That being said, its odd that they lock voltage controls on a card that says so cool. But it is also a new technology, so they dont want people melting their cards because they just max out the voltage right away and dont know what they are doing.     The AIO also does not restrict you from buying a custom block for your build.  EK and XSPC already have designs for custom blocks.    I would be more worried about long term reliability.  The AIO's have a shelf life, but i am glad to see the partners for the AIO are decent names in the buisness.  The pump is produced by coolermaster and looks to be decent. I just hope they will produce and sell replacement units in the future.   That being said, air blocks have a shelf life as well.  The fans on air cooled GPU's can die, and they are fairly hard to source the correct matching fan.  If the AIO lasts 4+ years, i would expect it to not be a problem."

Now it's stuck in an extremely awkward position where it's worse than a 980 ti in terms of price for performance, but costs the same.   I think it would have been better if they gave this to their AIB partners, scrapped the water cooling, and dropped the price by $100."

gamingpc,3axyua,the_unusual_suspect,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:42:49 2015 UTC,I think at this point I've seen roughly the same number of sources saying it's a full chip as saying it's a cut down chip.  Won't know til it launches ...

gamingpc,3axyua,Azov237,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"All we have is speculation on how DX12 will actually perform. We don't know how much of a boost we'll get, or whether Nvidia or AMD will come out ahead. People are already trying to give the Fury's 4GB max memory a pass because of the nebulous DX12 combined-memory feature that nobody has seen in action."
gamingpc,3axyua,TrptJim,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:17:27 2015 UTC,My thoughts as well. Being limited to 4GB though is going to remain a bit of a blocker. Might wait for the 2nd generation to come out or see how DX12 goes & consider getting a pair once the price comes down
gamingpc,3axyua,fortalyst,8,Thu Jun 25 10:54:57 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, that was a little bit disappointing.  It's basically  competitive with a 980ti, but at the cost of having to put a radiator somewhere and dealing with things like pump whine.  As important as it is for AMD to have a competitive card, it doesn't scream exciting.  Sure price wars are good, but it would have been great to see AMD get a proper leg up with this gen on the performance front.  If the Fury X were say 10% faster than a 980ti across the board it could have been very interesting indeed."
gamingpc,3axyua,Makirole,4,Wed Jun 24 12:32:34 2015 UTC,"As someone with a ver small case, I do appreciate the minimal size of the overall package. Not sure I'd buy one (yet) but possibly if I upgrade my monitor"
gamingpc,3axyua,slapdashbr,7,Wed Jun 24 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"AMD needs to cut the price immediately   But they don't. The first runs will sell out to people that will buy the card regardless of benchmarks.  It's still a toss up on whether the Fury (non-X) will be a full chip or cut down but I'd bet that card will be the real competitor as it'll be a bit more than the GTX980 and competitive with the 980TI though lacking the small form factor of the Fury X.  Regardless, so long as people will spend $650+ on the card, AMD should absolutely charge $650 for the card. They're not a charity."
gamingpc,3axyua,captain_awesomesauce,2,Wed Jun 24 12:42:55 2015 UTC,"Where did I state that AMD is a charity?   You didn't say this exactly but you did state that AMD should lower the price. But if they sell all inventory, there's no reason to do so. And as of right now, they've sold all inventory (at least that I can find).  It's not a question of it being worth it for the buyer. It doesn't matter which card is better. The price is a business decision based on what people are willing to pay."
gamingpc,3axyua,captain_awesomesauce,3,Wed Jun 24 17:19:20 2015 UTC,"Currently this card does not make me want to buy it   We're not even talking about the same thing anymore ...  I'm saying AMD doesn't need you to buy it because other people that go ""OOO, shiney!"" have bought all available supply. Until those people stop buying things then the current price is the appropriate price."

No doubt it'll also be very expensive for a fair while, cementing it as s niche product for those who want big performance in a smaller package (like ITX).  Personally I never want to run dual GPU cards again, would rather have the individual ones if I can help it."
gamingpc,3axyua,Makirole,3,Wed Jun 24 18:29:09 2015 UTC,"Locked voltages. Limited overclocking headroom despite impressive cooling potential. Only 4GB of that sweet-ass HBM, making it potentially useless for the mid-term future. Not looking good.  As a card-of-today, it doesn't really compete with the 980 ti. As a card-of-tomorrow, it's a total non-factor.  Huge disappointment."

gamingpc,3axyua,pFrancisco,0,Wed Jul 1 07:11:58 2015 UTC,"better wait for the Fury with custom PCBs and better drivers from AMD not to mention DX12, for me it's easy the kind right now is the 980Ti as when overclocked it's a better performance value than the Fury X on the other hand the Fury X is the future it's a card that will only get better as days go on."
gamingpc,3axyua,kurolife,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:33:36 2015 UTC,"I am interested if they will sell an air cooled version of the Fury X.  I don't like the AIO cooling options, as they eventually require maintenance that can only be performed by the manufacturer. You can't replace the thermal grease, without breaking the warranty (probably). Other GPUs have allowed you to remove the fan to conduct maintenance. The rubber lines eventually get cracks in them and the pump could go out. Yes, if the pump goes out you can replace if you are in warranty, if not, who knows.  Plus, they look ugly in a system, especially in tandem with a H100 or Corsair CPU AIO cooling option.   I'd prefer to not spend the extra cash on the AIO option, and rather go with air for now, waiting on EK or someone to make an appropriate faceplate."

I sent it back to the retailer twice, and both times had them send it back to me saying ""no fault found"" because it would work fine for random periods of time before failing. I was unable to give them steps to recreate the problem, so got stuck with it. XFX refused to even look at it. In the end, I traded it into CEX and got less than half it's second hand value back.  I'm pretty sure it was a VRAM issue, but was never able to prove it.  This was my second bad experience with XFX products, and is also why I'll never buy from them again."

I know Broadwell supported 1150 even though it was 14nm.  I'm asking since I have a mini-ITX Z97 Haswell build I was going to purchase late July. Should I just hold off and jump on board with the new socket? Will there only be pricey boards for it this year or anything in the $125-150 range?"
gamingpc,3atj8k,Omen_20,2,Thu Jun 25 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Intel has a two year trend of using sockets, like Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge were both 1155, and Haswell/Broadwell are both 1150, and I think Skylake and whatever after will both be 1151. I think expected performance was around 4-8% better than Haswell, so if you can afford it and want to wait then that's your decision. Prices new for the CPUs will probably be close to the current prices., but mobo prices may be a bit higher."

It is a PITA, you have to delete/move physx related files for every game to get it to make use of the hybrid set up, and even then not all games would work or be super stable. That said, I could simulate 45,000 physx points at 30+ SPS with the 650Ti, and the 6990 would just keep pumping out frames until the cows came home. It was very rewarding when it all worked. Now I just run a high end Nvidia and call it a day."

Had to jump through a few hoops in order to make it bootable but nothing too major. Unfortunately because it's pcie, initialisation takes a little longer than a standard sata drive and you can't use fastboot so power on to usable is around 30-40s."
gamingpc,3ao8ee,Markus_Antonius,2,Mon Jun 22 12:09:03 2015 UTC,"That kind of surprises me, what mainboard are you using? Because the detect cycle is normally a matter of seconds for anything on the PCIe bus. The only thing that takes long is windows finding drivers for them, but the UEFI driver find cycle should be much faster, it should get through the BIOS quicker than detecting SATA disks, not slower."
gamingpc,3ao8ee,Markus_Antonius,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:41:45 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it's because of the lack of fast boot. Bios update in the future to fix it?   Mainboard is rampage V  Keeping in mind this is a gen 1 nvme drive

gamingpc,3aklbo,ktmfinx,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:52:14 2015 UTC,What would you improve?   I'm finding that managing all of the tiny fan cables to be extremely difficult :c
gamingpc,3aklbo,ktmfinx,4,Sun Jun 21 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, extension cables make your system look a lot nicer since colour coordination is aesthetically pleasing. You can get cheap paracord ones from your local PC retailer most likely. Why do you have two floor drive cages installed when you're only using one? Route both PCIe cables together through one grommet. Don't be afraid to route pesky fan cables around or under parts of your motherboard (e.g. heatsink, along an unused PCIe lane, etc). If not, route them along with pre-existing cables. Vectoring is important. Does your case have a vent below your power supply? If so, flip that baby over so it intakes from the bottom.   I can't find much else to fault."
gamingpc,3aklbo,ktmfinx,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:01:09 2015 UTC,"Yea I was going to go for extensions, but the only ones on Amazon are stupid expensive.  I never really thought about the drive cages,  to be honest.  I guess i should just take an hour and route those damn fan cables properly D:  It does have a vent below the power supply. I just figured it might look a bit less aesthetically pleasing upside down. I probably should do it, however, since it has a dust filter on the bottom as well that is completely wasted since there is nothing blowing into it."
gamingpc,3aklbo,ktmfinx,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:18:56 2015 UTC,"since it has a dust filter on the bottom as well that is completely wasted since there is nothing blowing into it.   Wait what? The power supply will be sucking air from below the case into the unit, so the dust filter will be doing its job."
gamingpc,3aklbo,ktmfinx,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:22:39 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean, right now it's gone completely to waste because the fan is on the top!

gamingpc,3aklbo,jHOFER,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:29:28 2015 UTC,Nicely done! Mind taking a picture?   Those extensions should do the trick! Just as long as your GPU is 6+8 pcie power (I can't tell from the pictures).

gamingpc,3afdff,Corsair3820,2,Fri Jun 19 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"Any plans on building an enclosure for the monitor?  Also regarding the Red/Carbon debate. Besides the lights on the fans, do you have any other red elements on the case? The reason I ask is consistency. If you only have the color red represented on the light and mobo (+ red fluid for the loop?) then all the red elements in you build will be from light source and give off a different glow than a flat red. See all the red I can see, is red light paired with a black frame, nowhere do you have black with flat red. For that reason I would opt for Carbon over red. HOWEVER...  What I would recommend if just doing for the same finish on the rings that you have on the rest of your case (looks like black w/ matte finish?), it will look more seamless with the rest of the housing. Perhaps even getting longer bolts on the mounting bracket and installing white LED strip on the inside so they pour out the sides similar to the effect seen on PG 76."

BTW, im going to colour the bolts red or black, depending on if i go for red, black or carbon... but thats another thing im going to have to play with later in the build.. thanks for you feedback! much appreciated :)"

gamingpc,3ab78o,nirad,2,Thu Jun 18 20:14:12 2015 UTC,"It's all thanks to the PLX switches.  They allow near full bandwidth by acting as data multiplexers, switching data transfers between lanes.  So whilst there may be 40 lanes in total connecting to the CPU itself, these can be split up with next to no performance loss in most scenarios."
gamingpc,3ab78o,nirad,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:36:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, I couldn't find anything saying it was using PLX switches. I figured that was probably the case, though.

gamingpc,3ab78o,imajerkdotcom,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"These cards weren't bought, Nvidia sent them directly so the waterblocks all need to be added afterwards.  Besides, EKWB will be sponsoring the waterblocks anyway so it doesn't matter much.  This particular motherboard is very special in that it can handle 4 cards with ease.  There are 40 native lanes, which is enough for 8x on each card, which is good enough anyway.  Add in the PLX chips for the extra lane management and there will be basically no performance losses."

gamingpc,3ab78o,OneDegree,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:06:06 2015 UTC,"A 5960X is going in.  The point is that the physical lanes don't get saturated.  Much of the data transfer is between the GPUs themselves, rather than the CPU and the GPUs.  As such, the PLX chips can efficiently multiplex everything as it's not a solid wall of data simply going to the CPU and back.  Besides, for my main use they could be running in 1x and it wouldn't matter.  CUDA rendering is similar to mining in that regard."

gamingpc,3a9rmb,comakazie,3,Thu Jun 18 14:38:17 2015 UTC,This is hardly conclusive...
gamingpc,3a9rmb,MrPoletski,5,Thu Jun 18 17:14:23 2015 UTC,How so? AMD used to offer Intel Xeons on their SeaMicro lineup before shutting it down this year. AMD uses Intel processors simply because there's no point shooting yourself in the foot just to loyally follow your own brand. People wouldn't even touch these things with an FX CPU.
gamingpc,3a9rmb,TDuffin,-5,Thu Jun 18 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"How? because there isn't a picture of a processor there with the words 'Intel' written across it - nor is there an official statement (or indeed any statement) from AMD saying that it's an Intel processor.  It probably is using an Intel processor, but nothing in this video really makes me much more confident that it is."

gamingpc,3a9rmb,comakazie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:49:57 2015 UTC,your eyes are obviously way better than mine. But I found a much better resolution grab here which is much more informative than the video clip by itself.
gamingpc,3a9rmb,MrPoletski,2,Thu Jun 18 23:28:59 2015 UTC,So the official AMD footage of them using Intel motherboards isn't enough?  Perhaps they're just cutting off the pins on 8320s and puttin them into the sockets.
gamingpc,3a9rmb,TDuffin,12,Fri Jun 19 00:07:24 2015 UTC,"I got downvoted yesterday for even suggesting this.  Here's the cold, hard truth for team red: your CPUs are fucking godawful. The single-threaded performance of an FX 8320 is roughly equal to your 45nm Deneb CPUs from 2009, and it's the reason high-end gamers can't even begin to consider your ""enthusiast"" line as an option.  My personal rigs from 2005 to 2014 have all had an AMD processors in them, barring my current rig, where I finally decided I'd had enough of the same garbage and needed something a little more modern.  I want to see a strong, competitive AMD just as much as anyone else, but reality is, it's not going to happen for at least another year, when Zen promises to finally catch up to Haswell, which will be long replaced by then."
gamingpc,3a9rmb,Oafah,2,Thu Jun 18 17:00:42 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the Haswell being replaced thing as an issue, as the CPUs that're replacing haswell aren't exactly that affordable. AMD just makes a Haswell competitor, undercuts Intel's lineup and makes some money for once in a blue moon."
gamingpc,3a9rmb,TDuffin,3,Thu Jun 18 18:22:35 2015 UTC,also skylake leaks point to a mere 5% performance boost
gamingpc,3a9rmb,buildzoid,2,Fri Jun 19 19:01:12 2015 UTC,"Intel isn't pushing performance now- They're pushing efficiency. Which means while their chips will use less power under load (no chip is at 100% load 24/7 unless you're running simulations), competitors have an easier time catching up as they can just stick to the standard 90-125W TDP boundary and use the extra power to push the CPU  a bit harder."
gamingpc,3a9rmb,TDuffin,2,Sun Jun 21 15:04:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with this. People are forgetting how dominant Intel currently is. While AMD is struggling to even catch up let alone be an ""enthusiast option"" in today's market, Intel is spreading its business and technology to other platforms such as tablets and laptops where AMD are just invisible. Because their new chips are so power efficient while providing much better performance, Intel technology remains viable for everything in their respective fields and AMD is nowhere to be seen. You won't see an AMD chip powering next-gen tablets and new laptops any time soon (that is promising)."
gamingpc,3a9rmb,Aphexes,2,Wed Jun 24 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"APUs are doing okay for laptops, though they're strictly budget systems- AMD's presence at the high-end of laptops is nonexistent. AMD is working on ARM cores for their Opteron lineup (Using HSA to utilise ARM cores for lighter workloads while the Opteron cores do the heavy lifting) but those aren't coming until 2016 at the earliest.  If AMD can come up with a competitive ARM architecture before Intel gets good market share in the mobile market (currently only Asus, Dell, and Microsoft are using Intel CPUs, and even then not extensively) there could be some better competition there. It'd be nice to see ATi work on GCN for mobile, which with superior driver support (you see Qualcomm releasing drivers for their shit?) and experience in graphics, AMD might be able to break into the mobile market that way. HBM on a Fiji/Zen/ARM APU could be pretty competitive."

gamingpc,3a25iz,markrobbo96,3,Tue Jun 16 20:08:59 2015 UTC,It is however at 4K resolution which makes it a little more believable - AMDs cards have always scaled much better at the high end. 50% is a lot though so everyone is obviously still very dubious

I'm able to get 19% OC with no overvolting on my 980 ti reference cooler and still run it at 60 if I set my fans to 70% which is slightly noticeable/not noticeable with headphones.  From my experience with the reference cooler, the only cooling solution worth more money is either a super-overlocked edition, like the KINGPIN cards EVGA makes or a water cooled solution like EVGA hybrid/Asus posiden cards.  Everything else is nice, but not worth the extra cost."

I'm not saying that there's no value in a good aftermarket design - the Direct CUII fiasco with the 290X was a good example of the inverse - but I am saying that there's very little point in using excess english to set yourself apart from your competitors, who have obviously taken exactly the same steps as you to make their cards work."

So that would be a non-dissipation cooler that dissipates the heat of the non-dissipation cooler through dissipation :)  So using the words ""dissipation"" and ""cooler"" is using excess English ;)"
gamingpc,39whff,Markus_Antonius,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:02:19 2015 UTC,"I meant ""multi-directional dissipation"" as opposed to blower coolers, which exhaust hot air in a single direction."
gamingpc,39whff,Oafah,2,Tue Jun 16 11:04:14 2015 UTC,"It's the shroud that determines where the air goes though, you can create coaxial (most aftermarket designs) coolers that still exhaust out the back. Axial fans ('blower style', most reference coolers) merely make it a little easier to design a shroud that exhausts out the back. Plus, multiple fan designs make it harder to exhaust out the back too.  The reference design is usually actually better than the aftermarket designs and it follows the official ATX specification of where the hot air should mainly go. They're not designed to be 'adequate' but rather designed to industry standards. The GPU itself is not going to care if it runs 10C higher or lower, that only comes in to play if you start running things outside their design specifications (overclocking) where higher temperatures influence the electrical characteristics of the chip (a warmer chip affects electrical resistance). Under design conditions that little extra resistance does not matter, it's designed to be able to function at those temperatures on reference clocks.  This is why all the fear mongering around the operating temperature of the R9-290X was complete and utter bullshit. 94C vs 80C does not affect anything. But people get scared because 94C ""sounds hot"". You don't want to touch a GTX anything at 80C either, both will give you burns. But GPUs are not fingers, they can operate at 80C and 90C. In fact, the regular operating temperature of a GTX 560 was in the high 90s. As far as I know, most of those videocards still work fine to this day.  What can happen because of temperature is that solder joints on the videocard PCB can crack after long periods of thermal stress. This happens because of fast heating up and fast cooling down. So it's important that a videocard heats up as gradually as possible and cools down as gradually as possible. This is the reason the R9 cards stayed hot for a while after you took the load of them. It's to prevent thermal stress.  A cooler that's really good and lowers the temperature from 80 to 50C in 3 seconds will kill the videocard much sooner than a cooler that takes longer.   Things like this is why we don't allow people that don't have a technical (scientific/engineering) background to comment in here where it concerns technical matters.  The people that design these cards, including the thermal characteristics and thermal envelope, have college level degrees in what to do and why. I have yet to see a review site that even hints at understanding the reasoning behind videocard design. This is why we also don't allow quoting those unless you have the background required to understand if what you're quoting is even true and why or why not that may be the case."

It's a great idea and I wish someone would improve on it and make one that actually works. I'd be ok with slightly less overclocking headroom to have air not dumped into the case. But with 90% of reference models they get extremely hot and have very little overclocking room. They also sound like space shuttles.

Though with the money they save now, they can put that into a swanky 400 series, such as a 16-20nm node, 8G+ HBM and GCN 1.3 seem to be in order, but that's just as long as they don't bonk anything up, which is certain given their financial situation.

gamingpc,39frlp,lolpandabearz,21,Fri Jun 12 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: So summarizing, all IHVs fully and completely support the DirectX 12 API. No hardware vendor can claim 100% support of all specifications and the differences are usually negligible in nature. That said, if one is deciding by features observable by the end user and gaming experience, the slight advantage and edge goes to Nvidia with its Feature Level 12_1 support. Keep in mind however, that developers usually code for the lowest common denominator, which means Nvidia’s edge depends entirely on how many devs use it."
gamingpc,39frlp,ZachWang,6,Thu Jun 11 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"It's a good writeup but one crucial point the writer missed is that on modern GPU architectures, the drivers dictate what can be supported more than the actual hardware does. This is because increasingly, GPUs are becoming more like traditional CPUs in that they can be programmed very flexibly.  The TL;DR of this is that we're likely to see DirectX 12 support levels increase with new driver releases. Not all of these features need specific hardware support. This is also the reason DirectX 12 is more low level. In the past, with more fixed function hardware this was not possible. But due to the flexible nature of modern GPUs it now is."
gamingpc,39frlp,Markus_Antonius,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"You can only be pretty sure of that if you are intimately familiar with the internal design of all recent GPUs. Unless you work at the engineering departments of NVidia and AMD at the same time, you don't.  Additionally, my comment did not say it would be the case for every feature. It said that increasingly more features depend on driver implementation and do not require specific fixed function hardware.  So it's a bit like me saying ""most water on earth is liquid"" and you saying ""pretty sure ice is not"". Don't do this. It's called derailing a topic and we usually don't respond with a kind explanation like this one."

Do you have any real idea of what is possible in the driver versus hardware?  Incidentally I cited those 2 features because they are often mentioned as ones supported by the latest Maxwell cards but not current GCN cards, and since the rasterizer is still one of the more fixed function areas of the GPU anything which requires new functionality in that area is likely to require new hardware."

The only next-gen console I'm looking forward to is the next Nintendo system. It's apparently supposed to have an AMD processor in it too."
gamingpc,39a1pa,darkjedi1993,5,Sat Jun 13 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"So what's the difference between the regular card and the ""classified"" card? Overclocked? Better cooling?"
gamingpc,39a1pa,danieltobey,12,Wed Jun 10 13:01:10 2015 UTC,"Classified has a custom PCB with higher quality VRMs than the reference design.  They are factory overclocked and come with the ACX 2.0 cooler.    EVGA's cards typically follow this progression:     Reference card - the basic NVidia board   Superclocked card - the basic NVidia board factory OC'd   ACX 2.0 - EVGA's custom cooling on a reference PCB, usually available with either superclocked or stock clocks   Classified - modified ACX cooler and custom PCB with better VRMs, more power conections, higher factory overclocking than Superclocked   K|ngp|n - basically Classified with higher quality components and handpicked chips for the best possible overclocking potential     There are some variations to the above, like versions with a factory backplate and versions with waterblock coolers, but that's pretty much it."
gamingpc,39a1pa,Setitimer,3,Wed Jun 10 14:32:51 2015 UTC,"Does it make sense to purchase the kingpin version solely based on the fact that the components are of higher quality? I am not interested in overclocking. Btw, i am talking about all nvidia cards in general."
gamingpc,39a1pa,starsunited,5,Wed Jun 10 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"No not at all. The kingpin is for ln2 overclocking, on air or water a classified is more than enough and I'd bet most people couldn't properly max out a reference card OC.  I know I can't with my 280x lol, I just fiddle with the sliders until valley runs without a hitch and I feel most people do the same.  And if you aren't overclocking then it's a total waste of money."
gamingpc,39a1pa,TheRealRacker,3,Wed Jun 10 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"If you are not overclocking then it is better to save money and go with one of the reference boards or the regular ACX 2.0.  The higher quality components are for handling higher voltages and temperatures that occur with ""extreme"" overclocking.    As far as whether to go with the reference version or an ACX version, it depends on your PC setup.  The reference fan pulls air into the housing around the card and blows it out the back of the case.  The ACX blows the hot air perpendicular to the PCB, back into the case, so if you don't have a good intake/exhaust setup in your case the ACX may not be a good idea."
gamingpc,39a1pa,Setitimer,4,Wed Jun 10 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or are the EVGA high end cards some of the ugliest out there?  Don't get me wrong. I work in the industry, I know all about EVGA and they are pretty much the best. Still though, I'd never buy an EVGA just because they're ugly. That being said, I never actually see my GPU since it's in a big ass, windowless steel tower, sitting in a corner.  I went for the Asus GTX 970 Strix."
gamingpc,39a1pa,eXXaXion,5,Wed Jun 10 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"I personally like EVGA's styling. It's simplistic and understated, as opposed to the whole 1337 Gamer look most companies seem to go for. Aesthetically I'd much rather have one of these than an Asus or MSI. Gigabyte is better, but they seem to be headed down the same slope as well."

gamingpc,39b4dr,ehqhvm,0,Wed Jun 10 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"It's just equal with the Titan X and 980ti, with less vram, and price rumors don't make these out to be significantly cheaper than the 980ti.  I was hoping for a game changer and from this it looks like it's just pretty meh and falls in line performance wise with other cards for the price.  I guess I'll just wait until 16nm for something cool."
gamingpc,39b4dr,TheRealRacker,3,Wed Jun 10 18:59:51 2015 UTC,"You don't think how the 4gb of VRAM will be implemented in the imminent DX version a game changer? Well, ok."
gamingpc,39b4dr,psikeiro,4,Wed Jun 10 19:41:15 2015 UTC,"I absolutely think HMB will be a game changer, but it's still capped at 4gb now and we will see if 4gb HMB or 6gb GDDR5 will perform better when 4gb+ of vram is being used.  I was saying I think fiji would hold more promise if it was 6 or 8gb, because then it would beat the 980ti in every way vram wise and have more staying power.  Right now I think 4gb will just barely be enough for 1440p in a year or two, which isn't that great for a card rumored to be $800 I believe.  This is all my speculations and personal opinions though, feel free to show me otherwise."
gamingpc,39b4dr,TheRealRacker,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:46:02 2015 UTC,"The reason it's capped at 4gb it's because of how efficient it is. Literally a game changer on how memory is used, and how it will be able to be used with games that are also optimized for the new DX release.  >I was saying I think fiji would hold more promise if it was 6 or 8gb, because then it would beat the 980ti in every way vram wise and have more staying power.  More isn't always better, especially when we're waiting to see what the ""game-chaging"" memory does and how it behaves, but I wouldn't doubt this is where the technology is supposed to move towards, instead of just more vram.  Again, we just don't know how it behaves to make assumptions based on just the vram. I'm still skeptical, but for other reasons."
gamingpc,39b4dr,psikeiro,2,Wed Jun 10 20:01:41 2015 UTC,"I know it's incredibly fast and effiecent, but still what happens if a game needs more than 4gb of vram?  Game textures and such are getting bigger, and the new consoles have much more vram available, so ports are using more too.  That's the performance I want to see tested, when the game wants to use more than 4gb of vram at a high resolution.     There's dozens of pages of discussion on OCN about the 4gb issue, and yeah we won't know until real benchmarks come out.  But I for now am still on the side that 4gb wasn't the greatest decision."

This is the highest memory usage on a given benchmark on a 12gig Titan X on either 1440p @ 4xAA or 4k, whichever was higher.   Some games obviously go nuts, some are conservative.

gamingpc,3959hx,Sharpymarkr,8,Tue Jun 9 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"Well, congrats on awaking from the coma. ;)  Spec wise, for the hmd, it is very similar to the rift.   The big difference is in tracking and input.  Along side the vive is SteamVR and it's  lighthouse base stations and input controllers.  Instead of the ""seated experience"" of oculus, the vive will be up usable up to a 15'x15' space.  The tracking method is essentially flipped inside out and is much more accurate, and computationally more elegant.  It also scales up easily to track additional objects, particularly the new wand like controllers that are essentially the new steam controller (you didn't miss that too did you? ) split in half.   Check out /r/steamvr /r/vive /r/virtualreality or sites like roadtovr.com for all the pics and details"

gamingpc,3959hx,ledfoot07work,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"Yes. 15'x15' is just the upper limit for the 2 lighthouse base stations.  In setting it up, you configure or map out the available space.  It could be 6'x6, 10'x5', 2'x2' etc...  Within that space it has sub millimeter tracking so the only limit on how small of space you utilise (seated, standing in place, reclined...) is how the particular game design makes use of the movement. For example movement wouldn't nesisarily be 1:1. A quarter rotation of your head could translate to 180 degrees in game. Locomotion should always have an option to be relegated back to a WASD like input.   Some games will practically have to be a seated experience, such as the HOTAS cockpits of Elite Dangerous. (At least until they model full ship layouts :D )  Others will beg to be explored in full motion since the immersion that will offer is where vr will shine.  It will be up to the developers (and in their best interest) to adapt the game mechanics and configuration to allow both options."
gamingpc,3959hx,bluuit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yup.  And from the sound of things, the Oculus Rift will also support standing, as their consumer version has a much bigger tracking volume than DK2 did."

Only a few games have had textures stuttering in the distance, but overall I've had great luck. I've read about all the bugs people have had and blamed on crossfire or SLI but I could play the same game without seeing that issue myself, so I'm inclined to think something else is the root cause and multi GPU setups are a scapegoat because of a rocky past (like plasma TVs)."
gamingpc,3917dy,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:38:09 2015 UTC,Its more that they are not supported for months after release or not at all because its not a well known game. I own like 200 games so some simply wont ever have crossfire support
gamingpc,3917dy,TDuffin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:35:30 2015 UTC,RadeonPro really needs a revival. It sucks that the main dev has pretty much abandoned it. From my knowledge it had a lot of unofficial Xfire patches and other features.
gamingpc,3917dy,TDuffin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:26:12 2015 UTC,"The current problem with Xfire and SLI is that they need to be configured for each and every game that's released (hence many games never even get dual-GPU support) in order to reduce microstutter and other problems that arise on  a per-game basis.  If the driver was able to intelligently identify problems and then make the changes that AMD engineers would make in-house, but automatically, it would possibly eliminate the need for constant updates to individual games' driver configs for the dual GPU side of things. In fact, if AMD/nV were to figure out the general tweaks in drivers that improve performance of new titles, they could just make the drivers make the same tweaks automatically while monitoring average fps/overhead to ensure the GPU is being used effectively."

If you wish to do so, you can always go to Pcpartpicker and ""build"" your rig. They offer a great markup tool to show components :)  I would not call the Prodigy ""timeless"". Its already now a outdated case on the ITX market, and while it did spark a ton of attention at its launch and caused a ton of itx builds to show up, I personally no longer find it appealing due to its sheer size.   The fact that me and several others have shoved entire full atx builds in whats supposed to be a mITX shows its size.

That was a mere side effect ;)  And you're right, the Prodigy does sport a ton of cooling options, but that is not necessarily the first thing I look after, when looking at mITX. Instead of rambling on about my thoughts on the Prodigy  for ages I will redirect  you to the review I did about it some time ago.  Silverstone FT03 mini as an example offers just as great air cooling with its simple airflow.

gamingpc,38sm0p,NakedSnakeBurrr,14,Sat Jun 6 16:39:52 2015 UTC,"The panel refreshes faster, making for a more fluid experience.   Take a look at ufotest. If your screen is 60Hz, you will find that the top ufo is at 60fps, and the bottom one is at 30. Notice how choppy the bottom one is compared to the top one? There is a similar correlation between one at 60 and 144.  ""But my monitor is already buttery fluid"". Yes. You might say that. You might even think you cannot see anything above 60fps, because 60fps is already fluid, but it will most certainly feel more fluid. A good monitor overclocking tool is GRU, which is linked in this guide.   Depending on what screen you have, you might experience your current monitor being able to overclock to somewhere inbetween 66Hz and 90Hz. You can see for yourself :)   Please let me know if you have any other questions!"
gamingpc,38sm0p,d_block,3,Sat Jun 6 16:47:17 2015 UTC,So something akin to getting 60 fps in a game vs 30?
gamingpc,38sm0p,NakedSnakeBurrr,5,Sat Jun 6 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"yes, something like that indeed :) A 144Hz screen will be able to actually display 144fps.

gamingpc,38sm0p,famousfornow,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:51:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, you've been very helpful. I have a Shimian 2560x1440 monitor I bought from Korea last year and I actually thought about OC it for some time but never really looked into it in more depth. I've OC GPUs before, any risks with OC a monitor? Is there a menu where I can check my current Hz and the Hz after after the OC?"
gamingpc,38sm0p,bobthetrucker,6,Sat Jun 6 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"You're more than welcome :)  The guide will say the same as I am saying right now, but here is what you need to do.  download and unzip the program. Open the program, and set three new profiles. One with the stock speed, and three with increases in increments of 10 hz.   Save, and restart your machine. If you now rightclick on the desktop, go to screen resolution, and go to advanced. If you did the prior step correctly, you will in the dropdown menu be able to select new refreshrates. If the screen goes black and stays that way, the overclock is not stabile. If there are artefacts, the monitor is not stabile. Lets say you're stabile at 70Hz. Set it then to 80Hz, and check again, and so forth and so forth.   If you're stabile at lets say 80, but not 90, then make new custom settings for 81, 82, 83 and so forth until you've found your max monitor OC.   When something is not stabile, what will usually happen is that the screen goes all black, and is useless. Bue because you set the settings via the windows tool,  you're required to accept your settings  - if you don't do this within 15 seconds, the monitor will revert to its previous settings.   When you found your max oc, go back to the ufo test tool that I linked earlier and test if your oc is indeed valid :)  Your monitor SHOULD be stabile to around 90, but it changes a ton.   good luck!"

Just a suggestion for any future projects you are working on! The paracord gives a higher quality look that normal cable sleeving can not come close to.

gamingpc,38onoi,Rorixrebel,8,Fri Jun 5 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"I can understand drawing inspiration from a company and adopting it to your own design with changes, but almost every single detail on that case is Fractal's brainchild. The only differences i could see were:   bottom fan filters are two separate front and rear instead of one long. front intake fan is a single 200m instead of 2x120-140s.  top fan filter is magnetic (actually a nice feature, i'll give them that) the door cannot be switched to open from either side like the R5. the drive cages are broken into a few more segments than the R5, but optional placement and removability method appears the same.  the ssd mount cages are clipped into the space between front panel and motherboard tray. The R5 has them thumbscrewed to the back of the motherboard tray.   edit: a couple more things"

Competing with Thermaltake shouldn't be a challenge for any company with a decent brand or product behind it. I don't the bloggers are doing case labs any favors trying to get people to sharpen their pitchforks with a lot of comparisons that can be debunked like the licensed water cooling products. Linus points out FD did the same thing to antec by ripping off the p180 by doing it cheaper and better.  I think it comes across as naive to not look at how case labs style is all ubiquitous design. when you remove all the 5.25 and rad cutouts off of either of those cases you are just left with steel and aluminum rectangles. I'm not in the market for either of the cases but the layouts are clearly different and they are even different sizes, thought the photos force a perspective. I actually like the symmetrical design that tt is using, maybe that will end up a feature back in case labs product. Enthusiasts like simple clean designs that are basically un-patentable and every case maker should know it. Usually its the enthusiasts that do the innovation anyways from soundproofing, buiding maker aluminum cases, and its the companies that come in and market their ideas."

gamingpc,38dtlo,BlueSaber80,2,Wed Jun 3 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think that if I can get the same thing but cheaper it's a good thing. I've never managed to get my head around the fact that some cases cost as much as GPUs. I mean FFS it's a metal box there is no way it cost 500$ to make a metal box unless you use unreasonably expensive materials. I find that cases are so expensive that I'm using various ikea products instead. I have have a ""testbench"" from ikea that cost like 10$ which has has all the important functionality of a 100$ test bench. I still haven't found a substitute for the 200+$ test benches but as soon as I do I will not be buying anymore PC cases.   As for Thermaltake's take on making things cheaper. The water block is bad that's for sure but it's not a copy. Same goes for the Radiator fan and fan controllers. The copying of caselabs cases if they do them in steel and charge half price for them then I'm all for it. Though IMO Thermaltake would benefit if their cases were distinguishably even if they copy paste the dimensions and feature set of someone elses. Unless of course they are trying to be the cheaper alternative to everyone in which case good for them.   If all of these products suck and people get burned by buying then I see a problem but assuming that people buy the cheap and potentially crap Thermaltake products while aware of how shit they are, I'm okay with it because cheap shit is great for experimentation and modding."

A few examples:  -I've seen would be the MSI Mini ITX video cards having exactly the same cooling design as the original Asus cards.  -Back in the day Gigabyte introduced their first gaming line with the gun and ammo designs built into the heatsinks and shortly after that MSI introduced a gaming model with bullets for the chipset cooler.   -Asus introduced the onboard audio with the transparent backlit line showing the separated PCB and now basically everyone has that.   -Lots of mice have a similar shape to the deathadder. The same goes for the Intellimouse having a lot of knockoffs and more recently knockoffs of the knockoffs. (SteelSeries Xai/Sensei shared a lot with the Intellimouse and now a lot of mice look like them).   I'm not supporting it, just saying that this happens a lot in the industry. Some companies are really bad about it. They best way to handle it is to offer a better product and to continue to innovate."

gamingpc,3872ny,raddits,3,Tue Jun 2 09:06:04 2015 UTC,"The concept sounds... interesting, I guess? To be honest I can't picture exactly what they mean when they say its modular. From this press release, the only thing I could take from it is that you can adjust and take off the drive cages and 5,25 bays, and switch around the panels and doors... Am I missing something? Switch them with what?  I'd love to see a more in-depth look into this case, and I really hope that it's not just what I got from the press release."
gamingpc,3872ny,msixtwofive,2,Tue Jun 2 11:52:36 2015 UTC,From the pictures you can see one has 3 hard cages the other has 5. You can remove the cages if you aren't using them for better aesthetics inside the cage. Maybe the modules just help declutter the case of features you dont need.

gamingpc,3872ny,Terakahn,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:31:01 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love my FT02, but it limits my choice of AIO coolers to the short width rads (e.g. H80i) unless I mess with the airflow and reverse or pull out a few fans and fit something like the H110 at the bottom of the case - it would be a shame to lose any of the 200mm intake fans.  It's also massive, heavy and unwieldy.  I'd look at grabbing this with something like the H100i (Unless I can get lucky and find a new H110) or the Kraken and some replacement Noctua case fans."
gamingpc,3872ny,dxkillr,2,Tue Jun 2 15:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed and I understand all your points since I saw that case many times. But for me the build quality is something of important sometimes and in CM I have seen only SECC or SGCC and never high-end aluminum panels. Since this is a PR News, I think that if was in aluminum they mentioned it..but since they don't talk about materials I'm not so sure. The shape is good and also the features looks on good level..but quality?   This CM will be available after August"
gamingpc,3872ny,Super_Six,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:35:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm yeah, thanks for the food for thought. The FT is built like a tank (hence the weight).  My other thought was something like the corsair 650d which is big but not too heavy but is a beast with lots of room to play with."

When I play games it is pretty loud, but if that's because ot case material - I honestly can't tell. It has pretty large holes on top of it, so all hoise has good way to escape out.  As for temperatures, it's something like this - 50-55C for CPU (i5 2500K@4,2Ghz 1,28V) and 60-63C for GPU (XFX R9 270X with 50% GPU fan speed) under load while gaming, up to +60C CPU and +70C GPU under Prime95 and Furmark. 40C CPU and ~45C GPU on idle, with only CPU and GPU fans working at minimum speeds and case fans not working."
gamingpc,3842bq,Lavins,5,Mon Jun 1 18:29:24 2015 UTC,is the H5sf a 40.3 mm cooler? I can only get so erect
gamingpc,3842bq,Ottetal,9,Mon Jun 1 18:50:50 2015 UTC,Looks like they gave the job of designing the case to the guy who also made the Gaming logo.  That mini ITX cooler though. Do want

It definitely appeals to anyone looking for that ""aggressive gaming styling"" a la razer, and there are plenty of people like that out there. I think that it looks pretty nice as far as that goes. However, I'd never pick it over something as sleek and minimal as the NCASE M1 or the Bitfenix Phenom."
gamingpc,3842bq,Dstanding,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:19:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. I think they are trying to target mostly the console gamer.  If you are into PC's you already know about the other options such as the M1(as you posted). I don't see any thing wrong with the case but I also would personally go with the M1.

gamingpc,3842bq,Omariscomingyo,6,Tue Jun 2 15:05:29 2015 UTC,"That design is so lame, if they want to break into the living room, they need to have something that looks nice and sleek.  Not something that is ""gamer"" and looks so dang lame.  They need to take a note from Silverstone, or even the consoles themselves on what would look good in a living room.    I do like that living room PC gaming is getting more popular though."
gamingpc,3842bq,msixtwofive,4,Mon Jun 1 23:07:07 2015 UTC,"Why conform to the norm that is Silverstone? There are a dozen and a half of Silverstone's HTPC cases, so why try to look more like that?"

gamingpc,3842bq,mattcoady,6,Tue Jun 2 01:14:07 2015 UTC,Even changing the red to silver would turn it from being immature looking to something abstract and artistic.

gamingpc,3842bq,HingleMcCringle_,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:03:06 2015 UTC,"because htpc's are generally going to a market where a person has enough money to build a separate system for the living room. That demographic generally is going to be older and would be completely turned off by something that looks like this in their living room or in their media rack.  It's a terribly targeted choice. The amount of people willing to put up this type of money for something that looks like this in their living room are basically tiny. You're either single and don't give a fuck that this gamer-tech shit is standing out like a sore thumb in your living room, OR you aren't single and you have a special room for gaming stuff that your significant other doesn't care about all while actually liking crap that looks like this sitting somewhere under your tv."
gamingpc,3842bq,illpoet,3,Tue Jun 2 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"You really honestly can't speak for the entire HTPC crowd just by basing your market statistics off of BuildAPC. Corsair gets a ton of these pseudo-analyst responses when the actuality of it is incredibly wrong. Let me throw down some actual statistics, do you know the Corsair Spec series? It looks weird/ugly/off-putting to you and some of the US market? That's fine, it doesn't cater to the US market, it caters to the EU and that side of the world. It's selling like hot cakes and they sell more of it there than they ever would here. While you think the Bulldog case is ""ugly"" or ""garish,"" it will actually appeal to more people than you would be willing to accept. Not just in the US market, but even more in the EU/ASIA. They love this styling and when it comes down to Corsair as a business, this is what matters. World sales, not just the US.   I used to be like you with the same misinformed analysis of the case market, but spending some time with them and getting to know their ""out of the box"" thinking, it all makes sense.  All in all, for every one person that doesn't like there, there are 3 more that do who don't make a comment about it. And for every 1 that likes it here in the US, there are 10 more in the EU/ASIA willing to make a purchase."

gamingpc,37zevp,TheRealRacker,6,Mon Jun 1 05:23:04 2015 UTC,Because games don't need that much memory even at 4K.
gamingpc,37zevp,atriax,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:25:52 2015 UTC,"But this isn't a game, it's a benchmark program. It should be using all available resources when testing right? Look at the difference between the previous generation of titan z / 780 ti.....huge difference right? This is what should be expected with the numbers from this generation, but as you can see they are ridiculously close...."
gamingpc,37zevp,uberbob102000,2,Mon Jun 1 05:43:04 2015 UTC,"SO you want your Titan X to do better in a situation you're never really going to find it in?   The difference between the Titan Z and the 780 Ti is because there's 2 Titan Black cores in there (which are functionally identical to the 780 Ti's, just without gimped FP64[2880 CUDA cores, 240 TAU, 48 ROP]).   A 780 Ti and a Titan Black, or a single GPU of the Titan Z have basically identical gaming performance as RAM only matters if you run out really, and FP64 is not used in games.   There's actually a BIGGER difference between the 980 Ti and the Titan X than the 780 Ti and Titan Black as they're actually different cores.   The memory on the Titan X is first and foremost for people doing GPU compute stuff. There are a surprisingly large number of people that need shitloads of RAM for non FP64 GPGPU stuff."
gamingpc,37zevp,Terakahn,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:40:19 2015 UTC,Well no issues anymore....I rma'd the Titan X and when I get the refund will be looking at getting two 980 Ti's. ..
gamingpc,37zevp,iwtwe,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"I hope you mean returned cause unless the company was nice enough to do it, ""I didn't research my purchase"" is a terrible reason for an RMA."
gamingpc,37zevp,SadHappyFaceXD,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:49:34 2015 UTC,Well the reason for the performance gap between Titan Z and 780ti is because the Titan Z has 2 GPUs so it doesn't make sense to compare those 2. If you compare the Titan and 780ti you'll see a smaller gap. If they make a similar card with the Titan X that gap will be there again. And your assumption that a benchmark program should be using all available resources is sort of misguided. I imagine 3D Mark doesn't use all the VRAM because 6 and especially 12 gigs of VRAM is a huuuge amount and I would bet that the developers haven't implemented anything that would actually use that much yet. But that's just my guess.

Otherwise, it's got the same base, boost and memory clock, and the missing 6GB of VRAM is completely irrelevant when running current titles with the most demanding textures and at the highest resolutions on a single display.  The only reason you'd buy a Titan X is because you think the extra VRAM is going to be relevant at some point.

gamingpc,37pm11,BKachur,3,Fri May 29 16:58:50 2015 UTC,"AMD has had way better drivers. In 2004 they were really horrible. Right now I'm running 2x-7950s with about 30 games that I have tried from steam and play BF3 and 4 ever day with no problems. The only advice I would give you is, try to get MSI or ASUS as they use better components then others. How ever! If you check Newegg some of the MSI cards are getting shitting reviews due to defects so I'm holding out for a little. DO YOUR RESEARCH, ITS YOUR MONEY!"
gamingpc,37pm11,prlme,2,Fri May 29 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"Good to hear my worries were unfounded. The only other thing I'm considering (besides performance obviously) is the unique features if each card, like txaa and phyix vs tress fx and mantle."

gamingpc,37pm11,VengefulCaptain,1 point,Fri May 29 18:27:37 2015 UTC,"I personally heard more issues about Nvidia cards with the GTA launch than AMD. It ran very well for me with dual 290Xs on a triple screen setup once I updated drivers that were immediately available. Nvidia was the one with memory leaks. It was extremely well optimized, even on crossfire.   The drivers haven't been bad for me so far. The problem isn't AMD, it's Nvidia. AMD provides all the support needed to run their stuff while Nvidia doesn't. They've been pulling a lot of bullshit games lately, look at hairworks for example.   Also, I was dedicated to Nvidia until recently when I realized I could get more out of a 2 year old card that cost less than a brand new one that didn't even have the features it was advertised as having, yet people still bought it. The problem is that people see AMD as ""budget"" and ""second rate"" when it comes to the GPU market, yet they're the ones pushing the tech and pricing despite being nearly bankrupt because people are doing a bad job of spending their money on the better value product."
gamingpc,37pm11,nickert0n,1 point,Fri May 29 15:49:30 2015 UTC,The main difference is that crossfire support often takes much longer to get working.  And crossfire doesn't work if the game is not full screen.  If you are only going to use a single gpu then the drivers are about the same.  Launch week is a little rough on both brands anyway.
gamingpc,37pm11,BKachur,0,Sat May 30 00:01:46 2015 UTC,390x imo
gamingpc,37pm11,nickert0n,3,Sat May 30 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"That's not really fair to say. We haven't seen reviews of either card, how can you possible make that call?"
gamingpc,37pm11,imoblivioustothis,2,Fri May 29 17:43:21 2015 UTC,"I have owned both many amd and nvidia cards the last couple years and the AMD ones (while having to wait around for drivers due to nvidia's business practices with developers) always have a much better price to performance ratio's then nvidia.  Good comparison would be one of my R9 290's vs my buddies 780ti, he paid more for 3 gb not 4 like mine, aswell as a 384 bit bus vs my 512, and ofcourse my card out performs his by a 10-15% margin and I paid $200 less, and because such I could afford to pick up another card a month later and crossfire those bad boys and they STILL run any game on max settings as long as there is a crossfire profile (which is the catch with AMD cards).  EDIT: But you are right we don't know the specs of either card and we should keep an open mind, but if history repeat's itself I would go AMD vs nVidia."

gamingpc,37ic8v,FriedrichNitschke,1 point,Fri May 29 16:13:46 2015 UTC,Nice visualisation. How accurate is this? Surely it's more complicated due to all the parameters of card?
gamingpc,37g8zs,chopfab,25,Wed May 27 12:11:33 2015 UTC,"Remember that since these chips are not yet on the market, this is still a rumor. It even says so on the page you linked.    KitGuru Says: As usual, early benchmark results should be taken with a huge grain of salt. Even if the current test results are correct, it remains to be seen in what type of applications Intel’s new chips can show their maximum performance advantages over predecessors. While mainstream benchmarks do indicate relative benefits, they may not demonstrate certain local breakthroughs, which may be important"
gamingpc,37g8zs,Ottetal,6,Wed May 27 12:42:46 2015 UTC,"Looks like it could be about right. I don't think anyone should expect more than about 15% IPC increase over Haswell, barring them adding a new feature to the ISA that gives a huge speedup in specific tasks. I'm really not that convinced that it even matters (talking about gaming here), with engines getting more multithreaded (FINALLY) and some compute functionality being moved to the GPU.   Still, isn't the FIVR being moved off package with Skylake? That could be interesting for overclocking, assuming Intel continues using soldier for the high end K chips. I'll be interested to see how the 14nm process handles OC'ing in general though, but I don't expect to be particularly impressed."

gamingpc,37g8zs,itsappleseason,11,Wed May 27 14:36:07 2015 UTC,I paid $400 for a dual core Athlon 64.
gamingpc,37g8zs,cnot3,4,Wed May 27 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"Intel chips were always more expensive than AMD, but there was more pressure on them to innovate. A 5% performance improvement for a new generation of CPUs would not have been enough when AMD was still competitive.   Of course, this was also at a time when 64-bit and multi-core CPUs were just becoming available, so there were huge performance increases across generations for a while there. And AMD was the first to bring both technologies to enthusiast-level CPUs. Back then, Intel was pretty much dismissed for gaming the way AMD is now."
gamingpc,37g8zs,BlackFallout,13,Wed May 27 14:57:39 2015 UTC,Are you missing my point? Who cares what AMDs prices would be if they cause Intel's prices to fall by being competitive. Then Intel will have to spend more money on R&D. We all benefit from AMD and Intel battling for performance king. Intel has stagnated.  AMD is not competitive in the high end performance market with intel right now.

Although that article doesn't say its going to be any faster, just says that its going to take up less space and be more power efficient. It actually says    ""HBM’s characteristics are nearly indistinguishable from on-chip integrated RAM""   which means that its may be insignificantly slower now to the on chip offerings but has the potential to be faster when they beef up the power of the cards? Ill have to read up more but thanks for the post."
gamingpc,37388p,uberbob102000,2,Mon May 25 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"You're misinterpreting that sentence, traditional GPUs use off chip RAM chips that are their own ICs, that sentence was referring to RAM as part of something like a multichip module (MCM).   HBM is somewhat of a middle ground between the two. Less tightly integrated than, say, being all under one IHS (think modern CPU, but with RAM under the headspreader as well) but more tightly integrated than having BGA pads -> Impedence controlled traces on the PCB -> Memory.   tl;dr:   Off Chip RAM: What current GPUs/CPUs use for their RAM On Chip RAM: RAM on the package as part of an MCM or similar  HBM: RAM and controller are skyscrapered onto an interposer then connected with very short connections back to the main die.    EDIT: I should also add On chip RAM can be even more integrated than I stated here, and actually be on die in some cases, though as far as I know, this isn't typical for any quantity you'd find in a computer (think microcontrollers and such)"

gamingpc,36x8df,SDMasterYoda,3,Sat May 23 12:36:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know about 4 monitors, but with 2, Windows 8(.1) had the best support. Windows 10 preview is even better."

gamingpc,36x8df,Applegravy,4,Sat May 23 14:25:48 2015 UTC,"as a person who hates the tiles and think it's an absolutely horrible UI, I love Classic Shell.  Windows 8/8.1 with Classic Shell installed acts more like every other PC operating system with a GUI because the start menu exists.  it is also much more like the Windows 10 previews in the sense that both options exist.   from the perspective of an advanced user, I'm very glad that Classic Shell is a thing.  I could not deal with having to only use Metro.  many people hate Windows 8 for that reason, especially since Windows 10 is going to have a start menu again, alongside the tiles that few people like.  the fact that I'm also on Linux Mint most of the time now would mean that it's a much larger hindrance if I didn't have Classic Shell.    every Linux distro I've ever used or seen, and every version of Windows prior to 8 has had some sort of menu where all the programs are organized, rather than a cluttered looking bunch of squares.  I definitely see why some would like it, especially for basic users with touch devices, since Windows 8's new UI is mostly designed for touch.  as an advanced user who prefers a proper menu simply can't use the Windows 8 start screen productively or efficiently.    all that said, I agree with you that I love virtually everything else Windows 8 has done.  easy resets, faster startup time, better file transferring, better built-in driver support for everything, and better searching for drivers of things that aren't plug and play.  there are plenty of other small additions which help productivity, and of course, it's better on resources than Windows 7 (still not less than many Linux distros, but it's still a pretty massive improvement for people that are solely Windows users, or those that need to use Windows for gaming, which I imagine is very common in this subreddit.)    Windows 8.1 with Classic Shell is the best Windows experience I've had yet.  I'm looking forward to what Windows 10 is going to do, mostly because I love my Linux workspaces and I'm curious how Microsoft is going to integrate that feature.  as somebody who loves Linux and loves open source software in general, Windows is something I'm going to need to use, and I can say without a doubt that aside from the new UI, Windows 8.1 is clearly better than 7.  Windows 10 is going to fix that problem for everybody and not just those who use Classic Shell, and there will definitely be fewer Windows users complaining once the UI is integrated back with a start menu.    tl;dr Windows 8.1 is actually a really great version of Windows, even from the perspective of someone who hates the Metro UI and installed Classic Shell.  the people who prefer to stay with 7 instead should be in the minority, because Windows 8 has plenty of great features and there are options that make Windows 8 more usable for those who either don't want to learn or are simply more efficient with a menu.  those people are going to hate Windows 10 much less because the previews have a UI that I can't see anyone complaining about which integrates both a menu and the tiles in a way that many think is very nice."
gamingpc,36x8df,mightbearepost,10,Sat May 23 06:59:35 2015 UTC,"as an advanced user who prefers a proper menu simply can't use the Windows 8 start screen productively or efficiently.   An advanced user looking for productivity and efficiency uses the numerous keyboard shortcuts available, and simply uses the strong search functionality to launch programs with a few keystrokes.  I don't need a clunky old fashioned list of programs to sift through to open what I need, and neither should you. I actually paid for and used StartIsBack for a few months after upgrading to 8, but it didn't take long before I pretty much never touched it."
gamingpc,36x8df,Applegravy,-3,Sat May 23 07:05:44 2015 UTC,"yeah, I also use plenty of keystrokes and the run command a lot of the time.  in fact, I use so many keyboard shortcuts that a lot of my friends and family have no idea how I can do all that I do without a mouse.    that said, sometimes I don't know the program's technical name for the run command, which mostly happens to me with msc programs and other utilities, or it doesn't let the run command find it instantly.  I've had this problem with Skype before, as an example: Win key+R, skype.exe, program not found.  using the run command is less efficient than the Start menu when I have to type the entire directory for the program.  the same thing applies to programs that are not technically ""installed"" on that Windows installation.  things like my emulators are just copied over from the last time I installed Windows.  emulators like VisualBoyAdvance and ZSNES don't even have traditional installers and they simply exist as standalone programs.  once again, I would have to type out the entire path, or I can just put shortcuts in the start menu.  from my experience, it's much easier to scroll through the start menu with the arrow keys than it is to scroll around on the Metro start screen."
gamingpc,36x8df,tinycatsamurai,5,Sat May 23 07:21:41 2015 UTC,"Winkey and start typing.  Its as simple as that to search, you don't even need the ""technical name"".   There's nothing wrong with metro on desktop. People are just lazy."

As some one who worked retail, having to constantly explain to people why their 14 year old son who thinks he's a computer genius is wrong about windows 8 being garbage on a daily basis made me want to blow my brains out.

Hell, you can even use the old outdated popup text menu from windows 7 if you really want to, its been implemented the same exact way in windows 8.1.  The touchscreen aspect of it is very nice as well, I have both a desktop and a surface pro, it works phenomenally well with touch and is jsut as intuitive with a keyboard/mouse.

One of the worst stigmas attached to AMD cards are ""shitty driver support"" and in the past few years AMD has come a long way in erasing this belief...until recently.

Titanfall was the worst and I'm not sure if that has been fixed as nobody plays it anymore :/ The Star Citizen alpha had issues too but those have since been fixed. Occasionally in some games some textures will flash terribly like a strobe and is headache inducing - Arma 3 is one example, the clouds usually start strobing out. Again, windowed mode fixes this but my performance drops since I'm only using one card at that point.  However, other than those three games I personally haven't had any issues in about a hundred other games I've played/play."

gamingpc,36lkra,doyoueventdrift,13,Thu May 21 08:34:21 2015 UTC,They are likely focusing a lot on the DX12 release as well as new hardware. As someone who has 2x7970  I'd really like new drivers since the last few have been pretty terrible.  I've owned cards from  both sides over the years.  Nvidia is much faster at pumping out hardware and software.  But you pay for that with terribly overpriced cards..   AMD has been doing great things in the last few years in really getting their cards out there in a positive light.  The last few months they've been dropping the ball.  I'm hoping they pick it up before it's too late.
gamingpc,36lkra,Jereguy,25,Wed May 20 11:49:11 2015 UTC,"Nvidia is much faster at pumping out hardware and software. But you pay for that with terribly overpriced cards..   That's really not true. Maybe right now AMD has some better deals, but prices fluctuate constantly.  People forget that when the 970 first launched, it was absolutely the best performance/dollar you could buy. It was an incredibly good deal for at least the few months after its' release. Yes, AMD aggressively dropped their prices eventually, and now you can get some better deals with AMD. But again, that's not always the case, and the difference now isn't as massive as you make it sound.   There was also the cryptocurrency mining craze, when the AMD cards were overpriced due to demand, and Nvidia had better deals. I'm sure there are other examples, but I don't keep a close eye on the prices all the time. Point is, Nvidia is not constantly overpriced."
gamingpc,36lkra,MrHeuristic,2,Wed May 20 13:20:45 2015 UTC,"I've been gaming since early 90's, I can tell you AMD has almost always been cheaper. They are also incredibly aggressive at pricing.

gamingpc,36lkra,Holzkohlen,14,Wed May 20 12:42:53 2015 UTC,The 290x was released a full year before the 970

gamingpc,36lkra,Ottetal,-2,Wed May 20 17:40:28 2015 UTC,"Again, how is that actually relevant? Does the GPU magically grow more transistors because it's older? Has it been discontinued?  No to either, it's a older design, sure, but it's still there and it's still competing in the same market, it's still being manufactured even, and consequently, it's perfectly fair to compare it to anything else in the market at the time.  Now, if you told me a GTX 960 shouldn't be compared to a 6870 on the other hand, I'll happily agree, the former is a current-generation card being sold, while the latter is an old discontinued product.

I have a machine that can play any game out right now at 4k with ultra settings(or slightly tweaked ultra settings) at 60+ FPS from two graphics cards that combined cost me $700(which could be had for even cheaper now).  I picked up an XFX 290 and unlocked it to a 290x(which is awesome! this is the second AMD card I have been able to unlock to a higher model... the other being a Sapphire 6950 I had that I unlocked to a 6970) in December 2013 for $399 and a MSI 290x last black friday for $299.  Before I got the MSI 290x I was still gaming at 1080p(picked up a 4k and the second 290x at the same time).  When gaming at 1080p I never had a single issue and again was at 60+fps on ultra settings.  In the last two years I've installed every beta driver when they came out, the only one I had issues with was the one released in I believe it was August '14.  It caused a ton of issues with BF4 for me... then again we all know how ""stable"" BF4 was last summer, so it could have even been BF4 causing the issues.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be an AMD fan boy... I just believe for the money there isn't anything better out there right now.  I equally think my Geforce 750M in my MacBook Pro is a good card... a mobile card that can play BF4 is impressive also. :)"

Especially when you compare the performance of AMD cards to Nvidia's non-Maxwell generation, where the Titan and 780 Ti used to be stronger than their AMD counterparts the latter now outperform them in newer games.  I'm all for keeping manufacturers on their toes and all, but basing quality solely on 1 metric, and putting down some fairly baseless claims about the future viability of AMD in general is in my opinion not really beneficial to anything but pageviews/sensationalist journalism.

A re branded card isn't too interesting especially considering how hard Nvidia are pushing things. I shouldn't suddenly buy AMD because of the bad things Nvidia is doing, i should buy it because it is a better option for my build.They are both just companies and i do not ""support"" either. I buy what is best for me as a consumer.  This factor is multiplied tenfold for someone who can only afford a new card every few years. AMD needs to put in the effort and go the extra mile to get more customers and not rely on their cards being cheaper (Cyrix processors are an example of that downfall and the jump from AMD K6 to K7 processor that gained popularity is a good example of what they should be doing) . Reminds me of Voodoo series, i had 1 ,2 but their refusal to up their game to 32 bit just chased me on over to Riva TNT. If Riva was up to no good back then i'll admit that i would still leave 3dfx as it was a better choice for my money.Luckily this is just a rumor and i hope AMD surprises us with something awesome.  Edit : I do not like nor support what Nvidia is doing but AMD needs to step up their game too and shouldn't be supported by default because of Nvidia.

You should actually buy an AMD card if you disagree with what Nvidia is doing to the pc gaming community. Because by buying AMD you are not giving Nvidia money.

gamingpc,363agj,spock345,3,Fri May 15 21:13:44 2015 UTC,Is there any advantage to a BTX orientation over ATX?
gamingpc,363agj,dexter311,3,Fri May 15 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"The Wikipedia page for BTX summarises it pretty well.  Basically the components on a BTX board have different positions for better thermal performance.  As for using ATX stuff inverted, there's no real difference to normal ATX.  I suppose your graphics card might run slightly hotter due to hot air from the CPU cooler rising to the GPU, but in a case with decent ventilation that shouldn't matter enough to notice.  I mainly like my TJ08-E because I have my case on the left of my desk and I can see in the window!"
gamingpc,363agj,autowikibot,2,Sat May 16 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"BTX (form factor):       BTX (for Balanced Technology eXtended) is a form factor for motherboards, originally intended to be the replacement for the aging ATX motherboard form factor in late 2004 and early 2005.  It was designed to alleviate some of the issues that arose from using newer technologies (which often demand more power and create more heat) on motherboards compliant with the circa-1996 ATX specification. The ATX and BTX standards were both proposed by Intel. However, future development of BTX retail products by Intel was canceled in September 2006 following Intel's decision to refocus on low-power CPUs after suffering scaling and thermal issues with the Pentium 4.  The first company to implement BTX was Gateway Inc, followed by Dell and MPC. Apple's Mac Pro utilizes some elements of the BTX design system as well but is not BTX compliant, rather using a proprietary form factor.

gamingpc,363agj,C4ples,3,Fri May 15 21:16:58 2015 UTC,It's an alternative like in any recent case. But the front cover of the Phenom case is pretty restrictive (only a few holes on the side grill). I can't tell if the heat inside the case will make the PSU fan spin faster and make more noise than flipping it though.

Before that I bought an Sound Blaster X-Fi because my old computers' on board sound was horrid. It was a vast improvement.  Something to also note, many of the newer cards like the Asus Xoner have a port on them for the front speaker port on the case to be plugged into to. So you can use the existing speaker ports with the new sound cards instead of having to reach the back of the case like the olden days."

Tank model was designed from scratch in SketchUp using game footage and reference photos of real tanks.  Case is entirely 3d printed in ABS plastic  The tank is a fully functional RC vehicle.  Treads move and the tank can be driven around with a RC controller.  (left, right, forward, reverse).  Turret moves left/right/up/down and contains the internals of a wifi PTZ camera.  Turret and camera are controlled via an Android tablet.  Hardware Specs:  Intel i7 4770k, G-Skill 8GB DDR3, Asus Mini ITX Motheboard, EVGA Geforce 750 TI, Corsair 250GB SSD,  Cooler Master 550 watt GX II, Cooler Master JetFlo 120mm  LED Fan, and Cooler Master Thermal Fusion 400 Thermal Paste. I have made all the design models available on Thingiverse.com, if you have a 3d printer you can print your own copy of  my case. Note this is challenging case to assemble.    The Build:  I started this case in February 2014.  I didn't post a build log at that time.  I'm now upgrading and changing out hardware to enter this into the Cooler Master CASE MOD World Series.  I previously entered it in the Modders-Inc Casemod contest at Quakecon 2014. It took first place in the fabrication contest and made the September 2014 cover of Computer Power User magazine. The amount of time that was put into this case was astronomical, and I am proud to present this case.  This log will detail its original build and highlight its transformation and upgrades.

The turret controls have been repurposed from a home surveillance camera that allows the tank's turret to rotate almost 360 degrees as well as allowing the barrel to elevate up and down like a real Tiger tank.  source:  I'm OP's friend who lives down the street.

gamingpc,35e2oo,magnetswithweedinem,2,Sat May 9 15:17:14 2015 UTC,Pretty high load temps. Most likely due to the psu blowing it's heat into the cpu heat sink.

gamingpc,35f5v1,skidude9678,2,Sat May 9 19:25:48 2015 UTC,"Bought this NZXT S340 to replace my Corsair 650d. The 650d was a great case, but it was massive for a mid-tower and the design was clunky and looked old. I wanted to downsize to a small mid-tower, so I went with the S340. It's the younger brother of the H440, and IMO is a more well-designed case. Despite its size, it still fits my H110's 280mm radiator with ease, as well as having plenty of room for SLI 780s and four hard drives. It doesn't have any 5.25"" bays, but I don't see myself missing having my DVD drive, as for the amount of times I use it it is no issue to just plug in my external one. The case is very well made, all steel, with an impeccable matte black finish and smart cable management arrangements. The fact that it was $70 shipped is just astounding.  In order to keep the color scheme more uniform, I disassembled my 780s and sanded off the green paint on the ""GeForce GTX"" logo, revealing the clear white underneath. I also removed the blue heatspreaders on my RAM and painted them with a matte black epoxy paint.

gamingpc,35f5v1,dueify,1 point,Sun May 10 08:31:27 2015 UTC,"Temps are virtually the same as my larger Corsair 650d. CPU is between 50 and 55C under load in Prime 95. GPU is between 75 and 80C, which is normal for the GTX 780 with a reference cooler. Creating a custom fan profile in Afterburner or Precision X would lower that for sure."
gamingpc,35f5v1,dueify,1 point,Sun May 10 12:13:10 2015 UTC,"are the temps for the top gpu 75-80? that is really good. one more question, for the radiator in the front, do you have air pulling air into the case? how about the fan at the back and the one on the top, are they pushing air out?"
gamingpc,35f5v1,dueify,1 point,Sun May 10 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah both 140mm fans for the radiator are pulling air in, and both 120mm in the top and back are pushing out. Both GPUs are 75-80C under load. The reference cooler actually works well because it expels the hot air out of the case rather than dumping it back in."
gamingpc,35f5v1,sebastianlecrab,1 point,Sun May 10 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"do you have any issues with thermal throttling? what are your core clocks running at under load? i just got 2 evga 780 sc this week but they have the acx coolers, i also have a s340 case. when i just put them in my case without adjusting them at all the top card would hit 80c and drop to like 950hz causing poor performance and frametime spikes. that was 80c on the top card with the side of the case open. To fix this I placed each card in pc separately to see how hot they would get and one went to 66c at 1084 core clock and the other 72c at 1124 core clock. Next i put them both in with the cooler card in up top and then then downclocked the 2nd hotter card to run at 1084 effective core clock. Then I created a fan profile for the cards to keep the top card from hitting 80c and throttling. That fixed my thermal throttling and performance issues but the fans get a little loud.  also what kind of OC are you getting using that h110? i bought the nzxt kraken x60 for my 3570k and i was able to get it to 4.6ghz. but it was blowing hot air into my case and making my video cards heat up more. i ended up removing the x60 and using an air cooler that's similar to the cooler master hyper 212 evo and i was able to run at 4.2ghz and it doesnt heat up my gpus."

gamingpc,35coft,Laetha,6,Sat May 9 11:52:01 2015 UTC,Yes it is. The naming for 4k is really dumb. Since every other resolution is referred to by the amount of vertical lines (i.e. 1080) you'd assume 4k means it has 4000 vertical lines. Instead it means it is the same as 4 1080 screens put together. 4x would have made more sense.

gamingpc,355rz1,Ottetal,15,Thu May 7 10:06:34 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about the watercooler tbh.  Is it necessary, or just something that'll help keep it cool more easily whilst being a marketable feature?  If it's not strictly necessary then this could be a great card for fans of SFF builds, given the physical PCB dimensions should be nice and small.  That's a big deal, but only if the cooler can also be shrunk also, which is why I'm questioning the watercooling part."
gamingpc,355rz1,Makirole,3,Thu May 7 10:21:11 2015 UTC,"The watercooler version is called R9 390X ""WCE"" (Water-cooled edition) which suggests an Air-cooled edition would exist, otherwise the special naming scheme would be useless."
gamingpc,355rz1,TDuffin,1 point,Fri May 8 00:18:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's not the point of my post.  I'm saying that hopefully the TDP is low enough that they can take advantage of the shorter PCB.  If it's too power hungry, coolers will hang over the edge like they do on many short pcb cards.  Having a WCE at all suggests that the TDP may be high, why bother with that sort of cooling if the card is low power to begin with?"
gamingpc,355rz1,Makirole,2,Fri May 8 06:47:19 2015 UTC,"Rumor in the industry has been that 20nm was not found very suitable for graphics processors because in contrast to CPUs, when a GPU is under load, a much bigger portion of the die is powered up compared to a CPU. This makes it very hard to get rid of the heat because of a much smaller surface area in 20nm dies vs 28nm given the same amount of transistors. So unfortunately the thing to expect for now is larger dies with more transistors on 28nm.  But - also still rumor - apparently AMD and NVidia did actually experiment with 20nm. And AMD joined the game of playing things very close to the vest like NVidia has done for a little longer. So it's indeed possible it will be lower power 20nm, but you're not going to be able to fit Titan X class performance in a small form factor unless you get to 20nm and lower. Never say never but I'd consider it exceedingly unlikely that you're going to have Titan X class performance in SFF for at least another 2 years."
gamingpc,355rz1,Markus_Antonius,1 point,Fri May 8 22:25:16 2015 UTC,"Air cooling is probably sufficient, otherwise the air-cooled card wouldn't exist. ie. the 295X2.  Watercooling can suggest a few things.    The WCE is for overclockers as aircooling may only be sufficient for stock clocks  You be correct, or  It's just a gimmick for people who were going to get a waterblock for it anyway, and is just a means to sell a slightly more expensive 390X.   Also the smaller PCB means they're going to be reworking their cooler design, which might mean a better ref cooler."
gamingpc,355rz1,TDuffin,0,Sat May 9 13:43:10 2015 UTC,"Air cooling is probably sufficient, otherwise the air-cooled card wouldn't exist. ie. the 295X2.   Something is getting lost in translation here.  I'm saying that having a WC version at all hints at a high tdp.  Now air coolers can handle large TDPs fine, but the compromise is that they're bigger.  If you make them smaller the fan noise can become too much.  As such, just because it has a small PCB doesn't mean it will have a small cooler.  Lots of cards nowadays ship with small PCBs and coolers that hang over the end in order to maximise the available area.  What I'm saying here is that despite the physically smaller PCB, there's no guarantee of a SFF version as the tdp may be too high for volume levels to be reasonable (or temperatures possibly too).  There's only so much we can read into a topic like this."

gamingpc,355rz1,darthjammer224,1 point,Fri May 8 01:40:52 2015 UTC,A CLC is not that much more expensive than a good air cooler.
gamingpc,355rz1,Markus_Antonius,1 point,Fri May 8 22:27:12 2015 UTC,I think the water cooled version is to support the short card. If you used a standard heatsink you'll need something longer to adequately cool the card.  EDIT for clairty: The short PCB is too short for the size heatsink needed for a top bin GPU. So you either get a longer card for a bigger heatsink or go to a short card with water cooling.
gamingpc,355rz1,captain_awesomesauce,1 point,Fri May 8 01:35:37 2015 UTC,"For closed loop coolers, do you simply mount the radiator on an appropriate size fan mount, or do you need a case with specific radiator mounts."
gamingpc,355rz1,apocalypserisin,1 point,Fri May 8 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"Fan mounts, although you do have to check that there's suitable clearance as that assembly is much thicker than just a fan."
gamingpc,355rz1,Makirole,0,Fri May 8 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"Its a good question. According to the article, with of course is still all rumors, this is the ""wce"" edition. Does that mean that we will see an aircooled card with the same PCB, but extended fans (like some gtx 670 types), or is it strictly going to be watercooled?   I'm looking forward to seeing its final TDP, and especially how third party versions of it are going to look."
gamingpc,355rz1,Makirole,2,Thu May 7 10:26:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I would be hoping that a smaller PCB would also mean smaller overall dimensions.  But if the power consumption is too high then that might be offset by needing larger coolers to begin with.  Having a stock WC option isn't doing a good job of alleviating those concerns :/  Always seems a little odd to me when manufacturers use small PCBs and then hang large coolers off the end.
gamingpc,355rz1,mactroneng,4,Thu May 7 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"No DVI, interesting. What the difference between DisplayPort and a DVI-D connection?"
gamingpc,355rz1,blotto5,10,Thu May 7 14:04:24 2015 UTC,"DisplayPort supports higher resolutions and framerates. There are many other technical reasons why DisplayPort is better, but those are the major ones that most people will notice. DVI is dead(or at least dying) and HDMI just doesn't have quite the same features as DisplayPort, and it has less bandwidth. Of course you only really run into these differences if you are trying to display 4k or 8k content at 60FPS, so for most people HDMI is fine."
gamingpc,355rz1,damp_monkey,5,Thu May 7 15:39:37 2015 UTC,"You can also run multiple addressable monitors off a single displayport with an active hub. So in reality,  each DP can support 3-4 monitors depending on the resolution and bandwidth required"
gamingpc,355rz1,blotto5,2,Thu May 7 19:21:41 2015 UTC,"Very true, that's why video cards are going DisplayPort and not HDMI. With MST hubs you can get 6 displays going on some cards. Obviously you would need multiple cards if you want to power that many displays to game on, but they make for awesome productivity increases."
gamingpc,355rz1,senorbolsa,2,Thu May 7 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"I require dual link DVI, 1440p Korean IPS, but I guess with the proper active adapters that shouldn't be an issue."

Currently only when you get to 8k does DP pull ahead. 4k@60 requires 17.81Gbps, UHD@60 (Consumer 4k) requires 12.54 or 14.26Gbps. HDMI2.0 supports 18Gbps, and DP supports just under 26Gbps.   Someday when we get 4k@120 DP will be able to support that as well, and HDMI will not."

gamingpc,355rz1,coflropter,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:01:03 2015 UTC,I feel like the smaller form factor will open up all sorts of opportunities for smaller form factor PCs.
gamingpc,355rz1,TDuffin,1 point,Thu May 7 22:08:33 2015 UTC,It'll actually put AMD on top in terms of ATX/MicroATX PCs. The closest small formfactor GPU from nVidia is the 970.
gamingpc,355rz1,TDuffin,1 point,Fri May 8 00:21:43 2015 UTC,"The size:power ratio looks impressive as fuck. If it really is that small, it'll easily trump nVidia's mini 960 and 970, and it'll be a nice overclocker with the HBM since it uses less power and runs on lower clocks by default."

In general a current typical upper mid - lower top end ITX offers 1440p @ 60 decently (still awesome ofc) but I think things are moving beyond that in the next few years with 4k 120hz & high fps VR   have you any more shots of the 804 ? it looks huge in some pics"

gamingpc,34xgap,DonnyChi,2,Tue May 5 11:03:58 2015 UTC,"I question the usefulness of testing this on a X99-based system. Is the TDP specification for this cooler in that range? I suppose it's a worse case scenario but I don't think that's the intended application of this type of cooler. The reason I mention it is the review score is based on performance and, in this case, it's not sufficient for the application."
gamingpc,34xgap,wcg66,3,Tue May 5 15:26:13 2015 UTC,If they make it compatible with the narrow ILM mounts so it could be used with that ASRock ITX X99 board it would be a great fit for SFF cases where the PSU is over the motherboard and there isn't really room for an AIO cooler like the Lian Li TU200B.
gamingpc,34xgap,Suluco,1 point,Tue May 5 21:36:40 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent idea. However, i think the biggest issue is justifying the R&D and additional packaging costs to include an adapter or change the current design to offer compatibility with such a small part of the market.   Maybe if more narrow 2011-3 socket motherboards make it to market this will be something for one of the major cooling companies to consider."

gamingpc,34xgap,fernando_69,2,Tue May 5 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, the height is equal to that of a half-height or 'low-profile' PCIe/expansion card. At 65mm tall (about 2.5""), I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find a case that doesn't support this cooler.   As for performance compared to other L9 coolers, that I can't be certain of but would be willing to reach out to Noctua at some point for some samples to compare. If the demand for such a test exist."

gamingpc,34rubb,CoisasDoFabio,20,Mon May 4 00:46:19 2015 UTC,Congrats with your build.  I feel like building it on a shag carpet was a risky play.
gamingpc,34rubb,sishgupta,6,Mon May 4 04:19:30 2015 UTC,Definitely not ESD compliant. Please build on a hard surface in the future.
gamingpc,34rubb,Lelldorianx,3,Mon May 4 12:39:22 2015 UTC,"Tap the case and you're good to go. Every build I've done has been on either a carpet or a bed, never once even got zapped when touching the case."
gamingpc,34rubb,fenlain,4,Mon May 4 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"I worked in a lab (and still do, though a different one) where ESD compliance was a heavily enforced necessity. Carpet/rug like this will promote static discharge.   Grounding yourself by using a wrist strap connected to a ground pin will mitigate risk of damage, but there can still be latent ESD resultant of a poor build environment (like a rug or cold/dry air, where you can build up a charge pretty easily and without knowing it). Components are built for a volt or less in many cases and ESD is not always something where you feel a 'shock.' Each discharge can be a few volts to a few thousand volts, and causing damage with latent ESD is a real possibility. I've done it many times even after theoretically grounding myself, but I also have worked with thousands of components over the past few years.  Tapping the case can help, but you can't just touch any part of the case and it isn't a guarantee you'll discharge static electricity. It's ideal if you find an unpainted piece of metal that has a direct path to ground, like the ground wire on a power plug where the hot wires are covered for user safety."
gamingpc,34rubb,Lelldorianx,1 point,Mon May 4 16:12:33 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I guess I've never had it actually explained to me before. I'd always heard the reasoning of    Tap the metal to discharge your static buildup, then good to go!   but I'll take a bit more care in the future."
gamingpc,34rubb,fenlain,1 point,Mon May 4 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah -- that's not entirely wrong, but also not entirely safe. For the future / other commenters:  ESD builds for many reasons, which can include certain humidity levels (cold/dry), clothing (some of my sweatshirts, for example, get very 'clingy' and build up a charge), flooring / surface for the component, insulating properties of nearby materials (paper, for instance, should not be under components), etc.  Once a charge has been built, it wants to find a path to ground to discharge. If you are holding the charge, touching something connected to ground or something that is conductive enough (like a large piece of exposed metal) will discharge the static electricity. A CPU that is built to sustain 1.3 volts won't like a 2000 volt discharge.  If no other options are present, finding a nearby metal lamp would probably be my next course of action. Most American outlets also have a ground screw sticking out of them that can be used."

AKG's 701/2 series of open back headphones are great for gaming as well, although I have had quality control issues with that company in past, they are undeniable good headphones. My friend has a pair of Beyerndynamic DT990's which are fantasic, especially for gaming. You need a amplifier to drive if you get the 250 ohm version  Additionally to pair with the headphone, I'd like to reccomend the Modmoc 4. Its a modular mic that attaches to the headphones and sounds loads better than most headphones that come attached to mics."
gamingpc,34pu9a,tindo10,1 point,Mon May 4 07:25:57 2015 UTC,What are the pros/cons of these types of headphones?
gamingpc,34pu9a,200pcd14,2,Wed May 6 18:56:00 2015 UTC,Audio is very subjective so some people might not find it to be vastly different but I feel as though it's definitely noticeable.  I don't listen to much music but I game frequently and I'm happy I ditched the gaming headset.  If you more interested you can check out those youtube videos I posted in this comment thread and they'll get into more detail.    Pros:  They have great positional audio and a huge sound stage so it can sometimes sound as if it's in the room with you.  For gaming this is especially interesting and useful.  The openness of the cup means you can hear and talk to people around you without shouting.  They are very lite and comfortable to wear since very little clamping pressure is needed because the cups are open anyway.    Cons:    The cups are open so if you are in a noisy area it can overpower your headphones if you are listening to them at a safe   volume.  On the flip side if you listen to audio at high volume there's a chance it can disturb someone else in the room (so basically it should be used in appropriate environments).  You will notice less bass then closed cups which is not necessarily a con.

Eh, given you have a 980 now, I would wait and see what the upcoming options will be in a couple months time.  I know there's the whole ""there's always something newer around the corner"" argument, but given you have a perfectly capable GPU already, waiting does seem like a good option.  If AMD does release a great card in June, Nvidia will have a response set up, be it a 980ti or a price drop, bundle etc.  My suggestion would be different were you running a weaker graphics card to begin with."

On a high res panel things really aren't very forgiving.  Fine looking at it on my phone though as I just held it further away.  IMO this has been pushed too far.  The clarity slider can look good on hardware with sharp lines and whatnot, but you can't take it too far to the right else it has an overly strong effect.  This is too far for most people I reckon."

Then I got the Voodoo III and after that, it's kind of a grey area.  I really can't remember what my next card was orwhat I was doing for several years."
gamingpc,34im87,Sardonnicus,2,Fri May 1 15:47:41 2015 UTC,"I held off on the Voodoo I & II - both because I had very little money in those days and also because it seemed awfully complicated having a 2 cards, separate video pass through, etc.  I did get the Voodoo III though, where they combined it all into one card - video + 3D acceleration (as all modern cards are).   So awesome for the time, it came with a big bundle of games that took advantage of the 3DFX Voodoo ""Glide"" API (basically their version of DirectX or OpenGL but it only worked on their cards).  Everything that used ""Glide"" was just screamingly fast. Like 60FPS minimum at amazing (for games at the time) resolutions like 1024x768 - and I had a big old CRT monitor that could do 1024x768 at 100hz or more.  Descent... I think it was 3, came in that bundle and it was just mind blowing.   That whole period of about 1994-2000 where 3D graphics really took off, both on the PC side and with the PlayStation 1 was an amazing leap in tech. I don't think we've had a jump that big since.  The change from 8bit to 16bit consoles was very evolutionary, a clear but fairly small step. The 16bit generation to the PS1/N64 though - HUGE. Then the PS1 to PS2, back to a smaller, evolutionary step, and every generation after that has also been a smaller step.  Have to wonder what the next revolutionary jump will be - possibly moving away from polygons to ray-tracing or some other method of generating 3D graphics."

gamingpc,34g008,Firnex,2,Thu May 7 09:07:39 2015 UTC,"It's great, well worth the money (even if I do think it's a bit over-priced.)  I'll start with a caveat that I've not had an IPS before, so I can't compare like-for-like. I swapped from an old 19"" 16:10 TN panel that I got for £70 a while back.  Some people have reported dead pixels and back light leaking on black screens, but I've not had either of these problems, there might be the tiniest bit of seepage in the bottom right corner near the buttons, but it's not noticeable in practical use (IE, gaming/films etc).  Blacks are dark, colours are rich and the images are crisp and clear. I'm mostly playing BF4 and GTA 5, and there's no lag or grey fade issues.  The build quality is good, the stand feels a bit cheap when rotating the screen, there's a little wobble, but who moves their monitor that much? It holds location fine and there's no flex or droop if you tilt or rotate it.  All in all, I'm really happy with it and I wont be upgrading for a long time, 27"" is plenty of screen size and apart from built-in speakers there's nothing missing from it extra's wise that I miss (some might dislike the display port only connection option.)  As for the power supply, I have no idea to be honest, I can't remember what website it was, might have been part picker or one of the other hundred odd sites that I visited researching my parts, but it said I'd need a 1000 PSU, I think but don't quote me that the actual usage was something like 860 watts so the 1000 PSU gives a little breathing room.

gamingpc,34dg40,PBI325,11,Thu Apr 30 18:11:02 2015 UTC,Is it me or is the video card sagging quite a bit?  Looks nice and tidy!
gamingpc,34dg40,anon-na,4,Thu Apr 30 12:02:08 2015 UTC,"Them I/O Panel connectors are sagging too, under a bit of tension. My case isn't perfect so I'm a hypocrite for pointing shit like this out.   Overall it is damn sexy, love the ROG theme. Mine is similar because of the Corsair fans and the size of the case."
gamingpc,34dg40,purnubdub,2,Thu Apr 30 14:05:08 2015 UTC,Noon question: how would you fix sagging like that?
gamingpc,34dg40,just_wonderjin,8,Thu Apr 30 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"It's not noon yet.  Come back and ask again in 1.5 hours.  Just messin... You could buy a jack like THIS or aftermarket backplate.  You can always hack something together to hang the back corner from the top of the case with a piece of fishing line or something.  In reality, sagging probably won't cause many problems short-term, but over time it could start messing with the seating of GPU die or graphics memory modules."
gamingpc,34dg40,anon-na,3,Thu Apr 30 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"You can run the PCI-E power cables from the ""top""(opposite of OP's pic), and get some tension on them. Usually helps -- did for me anyway."

gamingpc,34bxoi,jtrias21,8,Wed Apr 29 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"I built this as a short time companion for my Mikasa Freedom Wings NCASE build, with plans to give to my brother-in-law this summer. He will use this to replace his aging HP Pavilion desktop from 2008. The 980 is only temporary with this Pentium. When I hand over the build to him, he will pair the Pentium with a GTX 570. He also plans to replace the Pentium with a stronger CPU in the future. The peripherals are mine (monitor, keyboard, mouse, headphones). His criteria and usage for this pc:   $500 max budget tower only (no GPU/peripherals) mini-ITX form factor For light gaming medium/high settings on a 1080p monitor (WoW, D3, StarCraft 2, Minecraft, and Civilization 5) general web browsing & MS Office Plans to overclock space for CD/DVD burner   We decided to go for the 250D because he already has a CD/DVD burner which he will carry-over to the 250D. I've already had experience with the 250D with my Ryuko 250D so the second time around made the build process easier. A second option would have been to go for a smaller mini-ITX case + slim optical drive, but that would have slightly increased our budget.  I feel an i3 would have been a better choice, but we found a great deal on the G3258 and he wanted to overclock so we went with the little Pentium.  He plans on upgrading the CPU in the future.  We went with Windows 7 because he already had a copy, but he plans on upgrading to W8.1 or W10 in the future. Most of the parts were purchased from /r/hardwareswap and /r/buildapcsales, saving us money, so a big shout-out and my sincere appreciation to those who contribute there!

I went with a mATX build (in a Sentey Ss6-2441 case) running pretty well with the temp GTX 770 I have in there (just snagged a GTX 970 to replace so I can SLI 770s main).    Most of the games I play are fine, just bought GTA 5 so well see if I can tweak settings to make it playable (40+ FPS) without stutter; program Throttle Stop might help, also looking up unofficial fixes the community has released (there is one for Dragon Age Inq and Far Cry 4).   Not sure if you move your PC a lot but I bought this   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JCUY6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  and its been surprisingly pretty good to transport my build"

gamingpc,33wn5k,JoeWIthTheGlasses,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:37:56 2015 UTC,"I think that in practical applications, the order isn't going to drastically impact performance, but my thinking has always been res>CPU>GPU is a bit better, since the GPU's usually run hotter than the CPU, so the warmish water coming from the CPU will still be cool enough to effectively cool the GPUs, whereas in a GPU>CPU loop the warmer water coming from a GPU block might be warm enough to degrade cooling on the CPU.  The difference is pretty small though, so I think unless you are completely focused on the theoretical best possible setup, going GPU>CPU tends to be less tubing, and looks cleaner (assuming you have a typical loop layout, like OP."

gamingpc,33u773,AkinasPotato,3,Sun Apr 26 06:41:01 2015 UTC,"Until it physically breaks, becomes a bottleneck, or no longer performs as well as you think a computer could.  I wish I had a number or a better answer for you, but it's just when you need it. Some guys will replace their proc every 3, 4, or 5 years religiously. Some dudes are still rocking a Pentium OC'd to hell and back. It really comes down to how you'd like to spend your money, and IF you can spend that money updating to the newest architecture on every release."

gamingpc,33u773,stormbringer89,1 point,Mon May 4 23:36:26 2015 UTC,Champ of a chip if you ask me. Mine is at 4.8 on air and I got it second hand. Never misses a beat. Not sure when an upgrade will be worth it. Anyone got any comments on its failings in comparison to new chips?
gamingpc,33u773,b0btehninja,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:18:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's just the lack of threads for more intense CPU processes, for programs that make use of multiple threads (video editing comes to mind).  I want to say all P games use 1 or 2 threads at most, so the 2500k won't be ineffectual in that use for a long while if I had to put money on it.  I would think the motherboards will probably become too outdated before the chip would (unless they are making newer boards with that socket?  Haven't checked in a while)."
gamingpc,33u773,mr_duong567,18,Sun Apr 26 01:47:04 2015 UTC,Tbh 2500k overclocked to like 4.5+ is still just fine for gaming.
gamingpc,33u773,Magnaha23,8,Sat Apr 25 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but once the upgrade bug hits, it hits hard.  My mom is using a 3 year old Dell laptop for her work, and it's approaching death.  She takes another laptop with her when she goes to hearings, so a 2500k desktop will work well for her.  There were many different reasons why I upgraded, but one of them was so I could give her my 2500k PC.  It will be a big jump for her."
gamingpc,33u773,lonewolf727,3,Sat Apr 25 19:05:30 2015 UTC,I didn't even need to upgrade from my 2500k after only 2 years but I did anyways. Gave my brother that gaming PC and he uses it extensively as well. It's still a very capable gaming machine.
gamingpc,33u773,Magnaha23,3,Sat Apr 25 21:22:07 2015 UTC,For pretty much every game 4.5 2500k is plenty. GTA V maxes it 100% atm but Im assuming it probably needs a bit more optimization.
gamingpc,33u773,lonewolf727,2,Sat Apr 25 19:21:08 2015 UTC,Gta V maxes my 4670k also. I think it just does a good job of using all four cores. The i7's seem to have some breathing room while playing though.
gamingpc,33u773,Colorfag,2,Sun Apr 26 01:30:29 2015 UTC,Most likely because they are hyper threaded.
gamingpc,33u773,superxero044,2,Sun Apr 26 01:32:44 2015 UTC,Yeah almost certainly. Though I find I have no trouble multitasking on my computer with gta.

gamingpc,33u773,cosmo_polite,2,Sat Apr 25 17:53:26 2015 UTC,You're gonna love the TitanX. I upgraded from SLI 780's as well and couldn't be happier. Every game runs so much smoother.
gamingpc,33u773,KallenStadtfeld_SC,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you that's so good to hear! I was a little worried that it wouldn't be fast enough since the benches had it around even with the 295x2. I was thinking that the 295x2 is somewhat comparable to OC'd 780's. Are your framerates about the same as before? Either way, limiting framedrops will be a welcomed change."
gamingpc,33u773,DarkRyoushii,2,Sat Apr 25 22:11:54 2015 UTC,"It's faster and smoother in every game I've played so far. Check out this benchmark. I couldn't even maintain a steady 60 FPS in Crysis 3 with my 780's. Now I can enable AA and crank everything and the Titan doesnt even get warm. Meanwhile, it's $100 cheaper and uses half as much power. The average frametimes are very noticeable as well."

Fill those expansion slots and saturate all those pci-e lanes you have now, have fun! :D  Also, one thing, please consult your manual to which slots to use for memory installation. For the MSI X99A Krait, I just checked through the online manual, you need to use DIMM 1, 3, 5, and 7 slots for full quad channel installation. You have used 2, 4, 6 and 8. It's nothing too serious but it just means electrically you are using the secondary lines on the PCB there, it'd affect performance less than 1% in your situation but still, I thought I'd point out.  Happy gaming!"
