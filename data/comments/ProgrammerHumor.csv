We have a function P(x,y,t) that returns either true or false, but will take considerable time to do so. Trying all the points is infeasible, but we found a fast function predict(x,y,t) that returns a rough chance of P(x,y,t) being true.  In earlier lines we generated ranges which are interesting to search on (xr,yr,tr), now we generate all tuples (x,y,t,predict(x,y,t)). sum([[],[]],[]) will concatenate a list of lists of lists into a list of lists, and then a list of lists into a list of tuples. Sort the whole thing based on the predictor. In later lines, we will interface with some parallelized C code that will try these in order.  I ended up porting the predict function to C."

ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,cubercaleb,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"Well, in C, or other languages with pointers the first thing you said can be valid in some cases Since you can use array syntax/semantics on pointers, if I have a pointer to the 3rd (index 2 so were on the same page) element in an array of integers, accessing the -1 element is legit. For example:  int arr[7] = { 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 8 }; int *ptr = arr + 2; printf(""%d\n"",ptr[-1]);   will print out 5, since arr is technically a pointer to 4. Creating an int pointer that is arr + 2 will point to 6, the -1 element of that pointer is 5. Granted, I didn't look at the link carefully so I can't determine whether or not its bs. But in C this is valid, but if you access something out of bounds (in my example it isn't) what happens is up in the air. Modifying that data can be even worse as you can mess with variables on the stack/heap. That being out of bounds problems are ones that a good debugger can help you catch, and if you have a an out of bounds problem you'll know when your program does unexpected things or the OS complains for trying to access memory your program doesn't have access to. Either way, out of bounds errors are ones you have to fix by shipping time, no matter the language, which means there is no point in the language bounds checking everything like it does in something like Java."

ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,alderthorn,3,Tue Jul 21 16:04:35 2015 UTC,Wouldn't a PHD be writing stack overflow degree?
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,mrjackspade,3,Mon Jul 20 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"Why do ""iN = -1"" followed by ""++iN"" in stead of ""iN = 0"" followed by ""iN++""?"
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,wanze,4,Mon Jul 20 15:19:26 2015 UTC,"It makes it a little easier to wrap your head around, I think. iN is used in the loop, so effectively ++iN (in the condition) and iN (in the loop) refer to the same number. If they used iN++, then that would be different from iN.  Right now, you can have ++iN < iLength as the loop condition and iN < iLength inside the loop, and they would mean the same thing. You can't do the same with iN++ and iN."
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,mrjackspade,4,Mon Jul 20 14:45:10 2015 UTC,"Good call. I hadn't actually thought of that. I would probably have ended up writing the internal logic differently just to avoid this, out of habit."
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,dfpoetry,-2,Mon Jul 20 14:55:48 2015 UTC,seems like this is something the compiler should be responsible for doing.
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,wanze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:51 2015 UTC,What is it you want the compiler to do?
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,dfpoetry,0,Mon Jul 20 16:29:42 2015 UTC,literally just sub i=0...i++ with i=-1...++i inside the scope where i is defined unless there is an i without a ++ after it.
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,wanze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:06:21 2015 UTC,Come again? I don't follow. Under wnat condition do you want to just suddenly change what i means in a scope?
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,dfpoetry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:41:34 2015 UTC,begin scope i=0 i-1 i++ ... end scope  becomes  begin scope i=-1 ++i i ... end scope  unless the dots contain an i which is not i-1 or i++ in which case do nothing. Pardon me for not writing out the entire regexp.
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,wanze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:59 2015 UTC,"First of all, you can't match it with a regex, since most programming languages aren't regular, so that's pointless.  Either way, you're suggesting that if I come into a huge code block, I'll have to scan it all through to see if there's an i++, because that would change the entire logic. That sounds awful."
ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,amoliski,2,Mon Jul 20 23:38:56 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, ++i can be faster (but never slower) than i++, though in the vast majority of cases, the compiler optimizes it out.  Plus the performance difference is so small that it's better to use the one that is clearer for you.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24886/is-there-a-performance-difference-between-i-and-i-in-c"

ProgrammerHumor,3dxkka,tomit12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:56 2015 UTC,"This has become a habit for me while learning, and I'm not sure how good or bad that is. I usually beat my head against a challenge for a while first, try a few things, and make sure I have a pretty good understanding of the problem itself.  Then the googling starts. This problem needs me to do something with Fibonacci numbers? I don't remember (or never knew) exactly how to get those in code, but I'll bet there's an algorithm on SO I can plug in to get me on my way so I can finish the rest of the problem.  I'm not sure how I'd summon this stuff out of the ether without having been taught or seeing it prior, but I always feel both dumb for hunting up an answer, and like I'm not learning correctly... Like I shouldn't have had to resort to searching for the knowledge I apparently should have already had. That's probably true, but I guess if I'm damned to never be a worthwhile programmer, my ability to effectively Google is getting some training! :/"

ProgrammerHumor,3e1n8y,xowefo,11,Tue Jul 21 09:31:27 2015 UTC,"Who really wants to advertise their mental illness.    Forcing people to not talk about their issues is a huge part of the problem (they have enough problems without their friends leaving them; it makes them consider not seeking help because of the stigma involved; etc.).

ProgrammerHumor,3dyvdx,AgAero,5,Tue Jul 21 01:49:11 2015 UTC,Pretty much every engineer I've ever met uses Matlab all the time. Matlab is awesome at the things you're supposed to use it for.
ProgrammerHumor,3dyvdx,McMalloc,4,Tue Jul 21 02:59:23 2015 UTC,"So is Python+numpy+scipy+matplotlib.  Plus, it's free!  Matlab is a de facto standard because it's the only ""very-high-level"" language most of us ever learn while in college.  When you're doing a project over Hohmann Transfer Orbits or something while you're in school, writing everything in C++ will take you too long to develop, especially if you add in all the interesting gui and plots.    Python has more general purpose capability than Matlab, and I suspect will gain a lot of ground on Matlab's market share in coming years."

ProgrammerHumor,3dyvdx,acwaters,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:59:00 2015 UTC,C♯ is C++ with more safety features so that ordinary civilians can use it. It looks kind of silly but it has most of the same power so long as you stay near gas pumps and auto shops and the comforts of civilization. A well-known heavily muscular intimidator keeps touting it.   Tesla is an electric car with more safety features and range so that ordinary civilians can use it. It looks kind of sleek and awesome but it (also) has most of the same power as a regular ICE vehicle so long as you stay near charging stations and the comforts of civilization.

ProgrammerHumor,3dyvdx,Speicherleck,5,Tue Jul 21 18:41:08 2015 UTC,I'd argue that it is a very bad language for beginners. It is like learning to drive on automated cars with brake assistance and steering assistance and all kind of helpful systems but you are actually preparing to be a truck driver or a professional racing driver.  You totally need to learn on multiparadigm languages or at least combine 2-3 different languages when you learn programming.

As for the filesystem, I also don't see a need for interacting with it as if it was local since I'm going to have an SSH client open to it anyway.

There is one weird bug that when I go from the top of a larger file to the bottom that the line numbers are missing until I move my cursor.  For searching/opening files I have helm + projectile which works but I still didn't find how I can open a file in a vertical split instead of replacing the current file. Splitting (C-x 3) before searching works but I am so used to just being able to split after I found what I want that it's going to be hard to adapt to this workflow.  For running shell commands in vim I would mostly bind them on the fly. map ,a :!run-unit-tests-in %<cr>. I tried M-! to run my unit tests and this is the result I get vs this when I would run it in my shell directly.  I'll keep fiddling with emacs on the weekends until I can find a good workflow."
ProgrammerHumor,3duido,emallson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:13:54 2015 UTC,"Which mode are you using for JSX? web-mode? I've had issues with indentation of JSX in that mode, but I don't know a better mode for JSX editing so I can't make a recommendation on how to fix.  Re: shell command. So is it just that colors are missing? AFAIK shell-command sets TERM=dumb, so many programs will disable colors. Those that don't produce the shell escape sequences for it. There appears to be a simple way to add color support. tbh, I'm not sure why that isn't the default. I actually keep a terminal session around. I don't like how a lot of the emacs terminal emulators work. eterm is the exception I think, but I've already got st+zsh+tmux set up how I like it so I haven't messed with it.  To open a file in the other window in helm (when using helm-find-files at least), C-c o opens in other window, which should be vertical afaik. Pressing tab and filtering for ""Find file"" is how I found it."

What you’re refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/LInux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux."

You should have used alphabet[27] or, even better, just alphabet[]. You can confirm your misunderstanding with printf(""%d\n"", strlen(alphabet));. You should find that it sometimes prints 26, but often does not, and this is because you are not leaving room for a null terminator to automatically be placed at the end of the buffer.  rand() % 25 will give you values from 0 to 24 since 25 % 25 == 0; thus, as /u/TheSlimyDog advised, you will never print 'z'."

I prefer that to a guided walk-through. Documentation is easy to navigate. Tutorials and other such material that mix essential language and library information with stuff that is more stylistic or opinionated can get confusing. The docs look like they have example code, that's really the best you can ask for.   And sometimes you just have to be left to your own devices. That's a lot of what coding is about. Sometimes you are the one who creates stuff that winds up requiring documentation because other people want to use your solutions.   I reddit stalked you and saw your background. You'll get there, I've been where you are at. The way most documentation has somewhat organically arrived at a standardization really is the best way to get your feet wet, eventually you just get so fluent in computer languages that having an organized, intuitive way to navigate the tools of others, is really essential, and has to be universal across technologies."

I know I'll get there but I wish I'd get there faster. I want to be productive.  My goal for this summer was to learn ANTLR and StringTemplate and then post a shitty tutorial for how to get started on them. But I feel like I won't even be able to get use them for what I need to do at my internship. Fingers crossed that it clicks soon.

Setting up a script to automatically commit every ten minutes is not unreasonable.  You can commit to a different branch if you don't want anybody to see the commit (your ten minute autocommit should definitely do that).

It's like it was invented by Terry Pratchett:   Malbolge was specifically designed to be almost impossible to use, via a counter-intuitive 'crazy operation', base-three arithmetic and self-altering code.  Weaknesses in the design have been found that make it possible (though still very difficult) to write useful Malbolge programs.  Malbolge was so difficult to understand when it arrived that it took two years for the first Malbolge program to appear. Indeed, the author himself has never written a single Malbolge program.  The first program was not written by a human being: it was generated by a beam search algorithm designed by Andrew Cooke and implemented in Lisp."

I assumed it would loop the ; kinda like you can do an if statement and give it one line without a scope declared.   After that line without the scope declared it wouldn't evaluate past the last semicolon on the line.  So I'm not crazy, thanks for confirming."

ProgrammerHumor,3dqj35,Soundless_Pr,2,Sun Jul 19 00:46:40 2015 UTC,"A semicolon is a statement, so that's the body of the for loop. It could be rewritten more clearly as:  for(int i = 0; i < length; i++) {     ; }  {     //something that definitely needs to execute length times }   It's still looping. But it's not looping anything useful. Then it does the other block once because there's not a loop there."
