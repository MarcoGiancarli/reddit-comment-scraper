trumpet,3e7by5,OceanicMeerkat,2,Wed Jul 22 14:49:20 2015 UTC,It depends on the style of cornet playing you are doing. Typically in a British style brass band you would want something a bit larger than you would play on a trumpet.   As for buying a 3c look for a used one on eBay or craigslist. They are usually very cheap used.

trumpet,3e4ntt,ratheadx,9,Tue Jul 21 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"theres a certain amount of pressure that has to be there to keep a seal of course.  i know people talk about 0 pressure but of course then the air would blow the trumpet away from the lips.  so whenever people talk about this stuff its in relative terms.  scientific american did a study on trumpet pressure and found that even experts misjudge how much pressure they and those they observe are using.  they found all players use about 50 lbs per 5cm of lip.  which seems really high to me, i would definitely say avoid pressure as much as you can possibly find a way to, you could bruise or blister your lip, its not gonna sound right and its gonna make for rough nights."

trumpet,3e4ntt,kartuli78,2,Wed Jul 22 03:51:19 2015 UTC,well my teacher says it like a check and balance kind of thing where you depend more on the air as you go up and down but balance it with tightening or loosening up along with applying or reducing pressure on the lips with the mouthpiece
trumpet,3e4ntt,phumanchu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:30 2015 UTC,While the exercises are valuable you should take the text with a grain of salt.  Much of it was written before the Civil War.

The exercises are still very interresting but the writtings are outdated.  I always compare Arban to a ""trumpet bible"": very complete, but do not take everything litterally :-)  Of course everybody increases the force between mouthpiece and lips for higher pitch and/or louder playing. The goal is to minimize this growth, that's why we learn to avoid this as much as possible."

Get a good teacher, practice often and smart. That's the simplest answer anybody here can give you right now."
trumpet,3e3nmg,gramson,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"Muscles (they come with practice) and proper pressure.  When you are getting tired, you are tempted to use less air and press the mouthpiece on your lips. This kills the lips.  Instead, you want to press backwards on your lips as little as possible, and move the pressure forward via a thick and steady airstream. Your lips will start vibrating much more freely, they won't get blood-deprived, and your endurance will increase dramatically."

Granted, you may need a teacher to know how to approach many of the excercises to get the most out of them, but it works wonders especailly for double and triple tonguing.  Endurance will come with practice so I insist that you get a good practice routing often and remember to warm down.  Also am I right in assuming you're in Europe? Some brass band pieces can be very challenging depending on which section your band play in."
trumpet,3e3nmg,jaiowners,2,Wed Jul 22 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"I don't recommend someone brand new to the trumpet to pick up the a copy of Arban's conservatory method. Great book and a great read, but it's best used with a teacher to guide you through it. I use it as a supplement for my students' needs. It was created as a pedagogical method book for conservatory musicians in the mid-19th century to learn and develop on the piston cornet.  I actually recommend the ""My First Arban"" by Robert E. Foster before investing in the full volume. That way you can sort of ""try before you buy"" because it has all the core exercises and how to use them and is much more suited for the beginning trumpeter.  At a similar price range as the full Arban method, I would recommend David Hickman's ""100 Progressive Lessons for Trumpet for the Beginning or Comeback Player."" It's pretty self-explanatory what the book entails, and it is much more manageable than the Arban.  As for endurance: proper embouchure placement, pedal tones, stamp exercises, and the Iron's ""27 Book of Exercises"" will all help strengthen your corners and develop the proper muscles for the trumpet embouchure."
trumpet,3e3nmg,themanoctave,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"Great answers here.  I'd also suggest that you are adjusting to the correct embouchure for whichever instrument you're playing on.

Try to pick specific things to improve upon and make recordings of yourself to track your progress. I wouldn't give up on it because it's a wonderfully rewarding instrument but the amount of time that you're putting into it now should be good. I don't know how you break up your time but maybe play trumpet in smaller chunks as you take a break from producing so you can give your chops a break."

trumpet,3e2w9a,ImADirtyBoy69,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:59 2015 UTC,In my experience with teaching students and learning myself. The process becomes infinitely easier when you learn how to read music first. Learning how to read basic rhythms and notes should only take you a few days to learn. Once you learn how to read music then you can learn fingerings and the sort. Since you don't have access to private teachers it's definitely going to be hard developing an embouchure. I take away the mouthpiece from my students for a week and have them free buzz for the time being. I suggest you do this for a couple of days if you're interested because it builds their embouchure. Once they actually play the trumpet their embouchure is a lot stronger and their tone is much better than other beginners. All in all the trumpet is a beautiful hunk of brass. Just stick with it! The rewards of playing are amazing! Good luck!
trumpet,3e2w9a,Elussive,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:58:03 2015 UTC,"Alright, awesome! I'll probably spend a few weeks learning to read music and everything before actually laying hands on a trumpet and then I'll be sure to start without the mouthpiece.   It certainly looks beautiful! And I mentioned to my dad that I wanted to learn and he told me he used to play. I dont know how I never knew that. He doesn't have a trumpet anymore and I know he hasn't played since I've been alive but he said he could help some with the basics so hopefully it won't be quite as bad as blindly jumping in!

If you're willing to seriously invest your time and energy into learning and practicing, then it's definitely feasible. The internet is probably the most amazing invention of humanity in that it allows us to share our collective knowledge, even as we're doing now, so you have that advantage that many of the last few generations haven't had.  With that said, You will have to be your own biggest fan, and your own worst critic. You will want to buy an Arban's book and work your way through it. You will need a metronome and a tuner. You will need to watch hundreds of youtube videos for examples and inspiration. You will need to memorize www.musictheory.net. You will want to intimately familiarize yourself with garageband and irealpro.com  This is something that's most likely going to take 2-5 years before you're even remotely satisfied with your ability.

I will definitely check that stuff out. Where would you recommend starting to gauge my potential ability without buying/renting an instrument? I'd like to learn as much as possible and see if I'm actually musically inclined before I get an instrument. Should I try to learn the basics of reading music first?

trumpet,3dwq3s,squid51,10,Mon Jul 20 04:11:58 2015 UTC,"I'll give you a quicker way to think of scales and I wish more people would.  Oddly enough, despite playing trumpet and piano for a living, it was trying to improve my incredibly hacky guitar skills that caused me to think of scales (especially for improv) differently.  One of the key concepts is that when you're improvising, you shouldn't get too stuck on playing scales with a start and end.  We have a bad habit of playing up and down our scales and starting and stopping at the octave.  This gets you into a very comfortable pattern.  If find that a lot of people, when asked, have trouble playing their C major scale starting on D.  I'm sure someone just read that and sneered about how easy it would be and to them I would say, ""Can you play your F# major scale starting on A#"" and now their brain just start trying to work it out.  Now, bear with me.  I'm gonna start a little more complicated before I make it a lot more simple.  You should practice scale exercises in sequences.  Any exercise you can come up with, you should be able to shift and start the same pattern from any place in the scale.  So let's start with C Major Pentatonic since it's going to be our simplest and most useful starting place.  C D E G A (C)   That's easy enough.  But if you wanted to play scale sequences from it, you might try starting on each of the notes.  C D E G A   D E G A C     E G A C D       G A C D E         A C D E G            C D E G A   You still only have the 5 notes, but you should be able to play them in any sort of combination.  And this is where, once you have this concept and you practice your scales like this, it gets way easier.  While you can think of all of the different scales, it's easier to simplify.  Basically by learning this one scale, you've learned at least one other scale and in a way three more.  So now let's talking about A minor pentatonic and take the same approach in sequences.  A C D E G   C D E G A     D E G A C       E G A C D         G A C D E           A C D E G   Now, if you're paying attention, you'll realize that by playing C Major pentonic in sequence, you've already covered all of this.  So by practicing sequenced scale exercises in A minor pentatonic all over the horn, you've practiced C major pentatonic all over the horn too.   So let's take it a step further.  You can add one note to the A minor pentatonic scale to get the A blues scale.  Just slip a note between D and E.  You can generally think of this as a #4th.  What's a 4th?  If you just count letter names and put numbers to them....  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 A B C D E F G   Granted, in a pentatonic scale, you're not using 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 like you do in a major or minor scale, but it's good to think of the steps this way anyway for the sake of how you would think of chords, but I don't wan to get too deep into that, and honestly, you really don't need to think about all of it too much for using your ear to improvise.  But anyway, you're basically just adding one extra note to that A minor pentatonic scale to make it blues.  The thing is, you don't always need that note.  It's a color note and it's not the only one you can use.  I have a problem with how blues scales often get taught.  You get taught (especially in people coming from the Abersold world).  You basically learn some blues scales and start putting them to a backing track and it's all good... as long as you're following a blues progression.  But then you try using your C blues scale (technically C minor blues) over a tune that's in C because, ""He, I'm in C and this is the only blues scale I know named C"" and suddenly it sounds like shit a lot and you don't really know why.  Well, there's a major blues scale.  So let's go back to our A minor pentatonic.  A C D E G   and let's add that note between the 4th and 5th... the #4  A C D D# E G  Now what happens if you sequence that?  C D D# E G A  What you end up with is a C major pentatonic with a #2.  This is the major blues scale.  It fits a bit better over tunes in C major for chord reasons (mostly the fact that the 3rd being major lines up with the major 3rd in the root chord in this key).  Now, you can still use the b3 and b7.  The way people traditionally think of the blues scale involves that concept, but I think it's a bit too cerebral.  The reality is, you can play the pentatonic scale over virtually anything for the key it should be in and it will sound good and right, though a bit boring.  You can throw in the appropriate blue note, #2 or #4 depending on which scale you're thinking from... and it's the same note in both related keys (#2 in the C major pentatonic is D#... #4 in A minor pentatonic is also D#).  So now that blue note can add color and it's a color you hear aaaaalll the time.    But you can add lots of other colorful notes.  You can fill in the rest of the notes from the major scale (which I didn't touch on) in most scenarios.  In reality, within certain contexts, virtually any note can be a right note or very close to one for theory reasons I won't get into.  But ultimately, by learning one 5 note scale and a single color note and playing them all over the horn, you just learned 4 scales.  The trick is to learn the other 12 keys.  But instead of learning 48 scales as individuals (12 minor penta, 12 major penta, 12 minor blues, 12major blues) you really can learn just 12 and understand how the other 36 work without having to actually think of them all differently.  The best part about the pentatonic scale is that it gives you very few choices and all of them sound really good.  So instead of starting with an abyss of freedom, you can start with an easy limit and then use your ear to explore colors outside of that.  I personally suggest the 2 note solo approach.  Pick two notes from the scale you're working on and force yourself to solo with them.  Then add one more note... then another... then another.  Spend a good while with 2, then 3, then 4, then finally 5 pentatonic notes.  Now start playing with that blue note.  You'll find that along the way you'll feel your ear yearning to go somewhere else as you get bored with just 2 notes.  You'll start hearing the notes that sound good and since you're using so few, it'll really train your ear to respond and you'll be able to play what's in your mind's ear.  Once you've started messing with the blue note... now play with other notes and see what does and doesn't fit.  Your ear will probably already be leading you a bit, but having a basic scaffolding (the pentatonic scale) will give you a home base and you can fall back to it when you find that a note you explored into doesn't work.  Play over some backing tracks.  Starting with C major and A minor pentatonics is a good way to start off.  That means you need backing tracks in Bb major and G minor due the transposition of trumpet.  Try playing over as many different style tracks as you can on Youtube.  I would caution you to not play too much over blues tracks.  They are great and all, but I find that they can kind of lead to a limitedness and crutch-likeness when it comes to being able to find what notes work in other contexts due to the somewhat unique qualities of the blues progression (several dominant 7th chords in a row with less natural voice leading tendencies that most music).  Sure, you can rock a blues scale over one of them all day long, but you might find that you can't make it work in other styles very well.  Here are some tracks I just dug up on the fly for kicks to make it easy on you.  I haven't played over them myself, but they sound decent and simple.  A minor  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aELJZDm6Kw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JKiJ4Dp6QA  C major  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSoPb67MdTw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z83vrZgIgI  Now, I labeled them, but by now you should know that both of those pentatonic scales (and likewise their major and minor scale counterparts FYI) share all of the same notes so it doesn't really even matter.  Here are some exercises I adapted from one of my favorite books into pentatonic exercises.  They are a great way to build technical proficiency all over the horn.  Ultimately, you would want them in all key, but for now I'm just going to post them in the two pentatonics.  Ultimately, if you work on one, you're working on the other.  They just have different starting places, but the same notes.  So when you're done doing 2, 3, 4, 5 note solos over those backing tracks (or any others you look up), try playing some of these exercises over the top of the backing tracks.  This is something I highly recommend in general.  Doing the exercises with a metronome is great if you find sticky spots, but playing with a backing track is great too.  Here's an app to let you set up your own backing tracks (very simply) and play them at any tempo you want if you just want that for practice.  It won't sound quite as good as most backing tracks you can find online, but you can also import damn near any song's chords to play over and play at whatever tempo you need to for yourself.  I know this is a lot to take in, but I think a lot of the approach to teaching improv is wrong headed and as much as I'm one of the biggest theory nerds alive, I think it can get a little too convoluted from a pure theoretical approach.  If you have follow up questions, feel free to ask as I might've presumed knowledge you didn't have.  I'd be happy to explain anything deeper.  And if you want to ultra-deep theory explanation, I can give that too.   I definitely glossed over some important stuff (like how to build pentatonic scales), but I ran out of space.  For now I just want you to go play with these ideas and immediately put them into practice so you can have some informed follow up questions."

trumpet,3dwq3s,pumadude321,4,Mon Jul 20 05:04:59 2015 UTC,"I'll give a quick scale rundown.  It's all about patterns.  Major Scales  The pattern of major scales is like this (W= Whole step; H= Half step):   W - W - W - H - W - W - W - H   Lets take a basic C scale.  Replace the first ""W"" with the C, and then we can use the rest as instructions.  So from C, we got up a whole step to D, up another whole step to E, and so on and so forth up to the eighth step of the scale, C. Below is a side by side comparison.   W - W - W - H - W - W - W - H C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C   You can do this with every other major scale, as long as you follow the pattern above (W-W-W-H-W-W-W-H).    Minor Scales  I'll stick with no flats or sharps, so I'll use the natural minor for C Major, A Minor.  This is the pattern of minor scales:   W - W - H - W - W - H - W - W A - B - C - D - E - F - G - A   Again, this is all about patterns!  Once you get the pattern down, the scales will just come to you when playing.  Just remember your patterns!    Blues Scales  There are 3 different kinds of blues scales, with the major one being the Hexatonic blues scale, so I'll start with that first.  These are still based off of patterns, but they aren't as easy as before.  That's because these scales are broken down into tetrachords, or four notes.    The hexatonic blues scale starting on C is:   C - Eb - F - F# - G - Bb - C   I said before that this is broken down into two chords, and here is that breakdown:   C - D# - F - F# Gb - G - Bb - C   The pattern for this goes as follows, but I'll be using the numbers instead of Ws and Hs:   1 - #2 - 4 - #4 - 5 - 7b - 8   If you were to use F major, where Bb is the only note in the key, the hexatonic blues scale would look like this:   F - #G - Bb - B - C - Eb - F   There's your hexatonic blues scale in F (or Eb Major, if you prefer).    On to heptatonic blues scales.  These are much easier to understand, but aren't played as often.  To figure out heptatonic blues scales, take a major scale and put flats in front of the 3rd, 5th, and 7th notes.  For example:   C - D - Eb - F - Gb - A - Bb - C     Last, but not least, nonatonic blues scales.  A nonatonic blues scale is when you take a minor scale and alternate the 3rd and 7th notes of the scale between flats, like they usually are, and naturals.  For example, if you are playing in C, you could play with Eb and Bb, but also with E and B.  The scale would look like this:   C - D - Eb/E - F - G - A - Bb/B - C   You can choose between the Eb and E or the Bb and B while you're playing.  Hope this helps!"

trumpet,3duq3n,harmanmute,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the links. I'm seriously considering the YTR-8345IIRS Xeno Trumpet for $1600 ($2589.99 new at Musician's Friend) from the Bluecoats. Any thoughts on the reverse tuning slide and large bore? I tried comparing medium and large bores at a music store recently (not this model) and though they were extremely similar, the large bore seemed to have a more ""open"" feel and sound (it's hard to describe). I also compared reverse and standard tuning slides (not this model) and although they were also extremely similar, the standard seemed to ""slot"" notes better. The reverse wasn't bad, though, and to me it looks extremely cool.  I have tried the regular bore, regular tuning slide Xeno (not the Xeno II) and it was the most amazing sounding, easiest playing trumpet I have ever played (and I've tested a lot of them, including a Taylor). Any thoughts on the difference between the Xeno and the Xeno II? I have also compared the Xeno and Xeno II and there wasn't much of a difference other than the Xeno II had a more comfortable angled thumb ring."
trumpet,3duq3n,asdpiojfjiosdfajadfp,2,Mon Jul 20 09:54:18 2015 UTC,"The only reverse tuning slide horn I own is my D/E-flat trumpet, so I have no comparison for B-flat trumpets.  Every one I use/have are standard leadpipes.  I would believe that the standard does slot better as there is a little more resistance.  The point of a reverse leadpipe is to eliminate some of that resistance.  My personal preference is a large bore, standard (8335LA or 8345).  Almost all of my horns are Yamaha's.  To elaborate on what one of the other Redditors said, Yamaha makes a blueprint of what the X335 should be spec-wise.  The 2335 is mostly machine made in China, while the 6335 and 8335 are made more by hand and in Japan.  From the looks of it, you are pursuing a music degree, probably in trumpet.  Personally, I would not spend money on a $200 horn because it can be painted silver and costs almost nothing.  Just keep your eyes and ears open.  Swing by TrumpetHerald and see if anything there catches your fancy.  You can usually find something silver plated in a different brand (King, Holton, etc.) less than a Xeno.  But hey, even Xeno's show up cheap there too.  I snagged one that I suspect was a corps horn because the silver was stripped of the valve casing.  I got it professionally cleaned and put a valve guard on it, and now it works exactly like a Xeno should."
trumpet,3duq3n,harmanmute,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:08:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I am not a music major. Just a former high school/college band member (serious amateur) who's getting back into playing and wants to get something nice. I am a Yamaha fanboy and set on getting a Xeno. I just want to know that the reverse tuning slide/large bore combination is worth the commitment (I did try the Xeno I with regular tuning slide and medium bore, and absolutely loved it, but I'm still unsure about whether I like reverse tuning slides or if large bores make a difference.) I'm not a professional who's extremely picky, but I do want a pro-level horn.  Also, do you think $1600 is a good price for that instrument and level of use? It sounds like a good deal to me.  I did some research on what large bores and reverse tuning slides are supposed to do, and in general, both of those are supposedly associated with less of this mysterious thing called ""resistance"" (whatever that is). I just want a Xeno that sounds great and is easy to play. Could it be that horns with less ""resistance"" are harder to play? Of course, that's subjective, but as I am just an amateur (one who isn't great at high notes), could it be that I should be looking for the standard bore, standard tuning slide instrument? That is the one that I played (standard Xeno I) that I liked so much."
trumpet,3duq3n,asdpiojfjiosdfajadfp,3,Mon Jul 20 13:59:00 2015 UTC,"I play mostly Yamahas not because I'm a Yamaha Artist, but because the consistency from B to C to D/E-flat to A-B-flat piccolo is more similar than playing a Holton B-flat, a Bach C, a Schilke D/E-flat, and your choice of piccolo.  $1600 is fine if you're willing to pay that.  Those horns will have wear and tear, but it's only cosmetic and you won't feel as bad if something happens.  (If my beginning students ask, I'll let them play on my beater Xeno.  One more trick in the bag to inspire them.)  For me, I find the large bore horn great if I need to blow the house down (big band or marching band), but if I need to play smaller (church gigs, some pit orchestras) I find that I fight with the horn because it just needs that extra wind put through it to make it shine.  Regardless of what my girlfriend says, you can never have enough trumpets.  Having a different horn can allow you to play differently.  (Not everyone will agree with that statement as some players believe everything can be done on one horn with one mouthpiece and that all the changes should come from you.  I personally believe in working smarter, not harder, so I have a collection of horns and assortments of mouthpieces, but it's my job, passion, and hobby.)"
trumpet,3duq3n,GbogD,2,Mon Jul 20 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"I found some information about the different Xeno options:  http://chasesanborn.com/2014/10/review-yamaha-xeno-trumpet/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da71wAwb_8Y  It sounds like for me, a serious amateur who is just getting back into trumpet playing and wants a Xeno that sounds good and is easy to play but is unsure about the various options regarding bore size and tuning slides, the best thing to do is probably to get the standard bore, standard tuning slide Xeno and just practice. It sounds like the reverse tuning slide would make slotting notes dependably on pitch more difficult unless I was at the skill level where I knew what to do with it, and the large bore could be harder, not easier, to play. Would you agree?"

trumpet,3dt0vb,dafuzz4345,5,Sun Jul 19 04:18:52 2015 UTC,"There are basically 3 types of oils; petroleum based, petroleum with additives, and synthetic.  Don't mix any of them.  They gunk up when mixed and can be hard to remove.  Take your valves out, take them apart, and soak them in some warm water with dish soap for about 20 mins.  Take your brush and scrub them out, rinse with warm water and wipe with a clean cloth.  Now apply your new oil.  Source:  I'm an instrument repair tech."
trumpet,3dt0vb,NotAlwaysGifs,3,Sun Jul 19 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"Tech to tech I'll let you in on a secret Mr. Hetman once told my boss: there isn't a valve oil on the market that doesn't have some petroleum in it, synthetic included.   Valve oil serves 4 purposes: It lubricates the Pistons to allow smoother use. It provides a sealed vacuum so air doesn't escape through the small gaps causing a horn not to play correctly.  It cleans by keeping dust and dirt from building up and wearing down the metal.  And it protects valves from damage. Although this last one is kind of a given from the previous three.   Now while not every oil is the same, for all intents and purposes it's all the same viscosity which is all that really matters, changing valve oil will not effect anything as long as the viscosity doesn't change.   Best metaphor I can come up with is when you change the oil in your car's engine. Yes you drain the oil pan, but there is still oil with the block when you add the new stuff even if it's different that oil will mix since it's the same viscosity."

This is one of those issues I've seen cripple people.  Unless playing trumpet causes you actual pain, or there's something you physically can't do because of your setup, then it's best to leave it alone and work through it.  That being said, since this is a secondary horn for you and since you've only just started, I will make the suggestion to roll your top lip in a little bit.

You can often pick up old military band cornets from ~1880-1950 for under $200.  The quality of those horns is usually good enough that you can spot any major issues in the pictures.  If it looks good, it will probably play well.  I was just working on an old JW Pepper cornet the other day.  It was compact, maybe just 3-4 inches longer than a pocket trumpet, and played great.  The owner told me he bought it at an antique consignment store for $80."
trumpet,3dmg54,NotAlwaysGifs,3,Fri Jul 17 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"Cornet definitely. Pocket trumpets tend to have a lot of issues. It's more of a novelty instrument, or something for quick practice when you can't carry a larger trumpet around.

trumpet,3degvq,AncientRuler777,6,Wed Jul 15 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"Some people do lip trills, which are just extremely fast lip slurs back and forth between two notes. Personally, I try to lip up to the sharp side of the bottom note, then physically shake the horn, mainly with my right pinky."
trumpet,3degvq,tyerker,2,Wed Jul 15 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"I do the hand shake too, but I'm wondering how to do it while rolling my tongue (flutter tongue)."
trumpet,3degvq,YourBrainOnJazz,4,Wed Jul 15 20:13:56 2015 UTC,"According to Carl Saunders (You know from the world famous Stan Kenton band?!?) The shake can come from 3 different techniques: 1) the horn actually moving in your hand slightly back and forth only enough to ""shake the tone"" (hence the term shake) 2)very quick lip slur or 3) a Valve trill at a wider interval. Now All three of these have their place. Playing classical music? Lip Slur Shake. Playing some Blues at a jazz jam? The actual horn shake method for that nasty but clean shake sound. Your question: for a latin shake with a flair? The flutter tongue with the fast valve shake (generally a 3rd away, but I have seen guys do a shake on an open fifth for extreme gnarleyness) In my experience playing salsa music with Pro Bay Area Salsa bands, that last method is definitely what your looking for. The lip shake will be much to difficult with the flutter tonguing, and the shaking of the horn method with be too inconsistent with the flutter tonguing. Beware with the physically shaking your horn method. Its a totally jazzy way to do your shakes and you can get an excellent sound out of it, but you want to make sure that you never push hard enough to hurt your face... Now there is one more method that is much much more of an advanced method to this process, and that is gonna be the lip/hand shake + multiphonics. You can find this method used in very very old Duke Ellington recordings by trombonist Tricky Sam Nanton who invented a lot of these nuances. He would hum the note lightly in the back of his throat while flutter tounging for a lot of his normal tone(normal plunger mute tone that is), and he would even incorporate  lip trills and shakes into this technique. This is by far the best sounding dirty shake, and by far the most difficult and advanced method of shaking, and it was invented by some unknown black trombone player from the 1920's - Tricky Sam Nanton. That being said: each shake has their positives and negatives, pick the shake best suited to the situation. Since we are talking Trumpet here check out ""Concerto for Cootie"" Cootie Williams would incorporate the multiphonics with the hand shake, and its a beautiful full sound. Check out older jazz recordings and older salsa recordings from the mid 1920's to 1950's. I feel recordings of this era will give you ample examples of various trills for different situations."
trumpet,3degvq,YourBrainOnJazz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:51:26 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!  Although how do I do a valve shake? Do I keep them half open?
trumpet,3degvq,tyerker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"A Valve shake is really just the same as a valve trill, but your doing a larger interval like a minor/major 3rd and bigger.(ex: valve trill: Bb-C Valve shake: Bb-Db or Bb-Eb etc) Also keep in mind that a shake is not just shaking the note as fast as you can. If you listen to pros do shakes, they use different techniques for different tunes. For a lot of commercial(jazz salsa and RNB funk etc) stuff the shake starts off slow and speeds up towards the end. Lastly, regardless of your shake style or intensity, you gotta make sure the shape of your mouth and how wide you jaw is corresponds to the notes. I will use my jaw and tongue to mouth syllables of the shake. aa-ee-aa-ee for like a higher shake, uh-ah-uh-ah for a mid range. If your shake is gonna be really gnarley and your doing like a fifth or an octave shake(which is not as uncommon as you would think when it comes to the highest levels of professionals) the mouth shape would be kinda more of an ooo-ee-ooo-ee."
trumpet,3degvq,DoingItLeft,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"Same way, I would think. Might need to focus your lips a bit more and/or feel like you are blowing harder than usual. The flutter tongue most likely interrupts the air flow in a way that makes the shake harder.    The other option would be to try a throat growl. I've never been able to pull one off properly in mid-song, but it is an alternative to flutter-tonguing."
trumpet,3degvq,nuvistor,0,Wed Jul 15 20:50:55 2015 UTC,"Flutter tongue without a horn, its a gene like rolling your tongue so if you can't do it you may be inable to. easy note + flutter, note you want + flutter, back to easy note, shake, shake + flutter, note you want shake, shake + flutter  Do say 25 of each or until you feel you're good enough."

trumpet,3dbpm0,maestro2005,2,Wed Jul 15 01:11:39 2015 UTC,"Much of the sound you hear is through your own skull.  Some is coming off the outside of the bell as it vibrates, angled back towards you.  Some is coming out the front of the bell and reaching your ears after bouncing around the room.  All of these add up in weird ways that are difficult to predict.  It takes a while, but your brain will learn to compensate for everything and you'll start to hear your true sound better.  One thing that helps is quick feedback via recording--record a short segment, think about how it sounded to you, and then immediately listen to the recording and compare.  Make sure your recording equipment is okay--it doesn't take much, but your computer's built-in mic won't cut it.  Get an omnidirectional USB mic like the Blue Snowball and don't play directly into it, just place it in the room."

I used to be dubious about buzzing a lot, but over the years I've realized it's a really valuable tool and can add a lot to your playing.  Try to work on keeping the air stream up and the pressure down on the mouthpiece, it will translate when you're back on the horn.  I don't suppose you'll be going anywhere that you could rent a horn from a local music store to get some practice in? Just a thought."

I can put on a video before going to bed and buzz along while watching it before going to bed... I find it helps me anyway with two things: (1) any sort of mental block against going up high, because there are no fingerings involved, I don't find myself thinking, ""this is that note with the first two valves that's hard"" etc. (2) It's just not easy to cram the mouthpiece alone into your face as hard as some of you (or I) might cram the whole horn. So I feel it's good for learning to play with less pressure. Lastly, it's just that much more time pushing air."
trumpet,3day63,iamnotschuyler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:53:24 2015 UTC,"Mouthpiece buzzing is a great warmup and practice tool.  I found it to help me a great deal especially in tone production and removing pressure.  If you have a problem with jamming the mouthpiece into your face, try using your non-dominant hand while you buzz to reduce the amount of pressure you may be using.  When you get back on your horn, buzz a note into your mouthpiece and apply the horn with the same note as you insert it.  That reduces a bit of pressure and starts to produce some more honest and less forced air.  Remember that sound and try to replicate it on your horn.  This works for me and I hope it does for you!"

You will get different suggestions for exercises that other people swear by. All of them will actually work, as long as you're challenging your range when playing them.    I just play different scales ascending chromatically until failure, usually on the front end of my practicing for that day (when I have fresh chops).   The key is consistency, and patience. You WILL make gains eventually, but you may not notice any for up to 6 months (happened with me). Also, always try to play musically.    Good luck!"
trumpet,3d9ctb,WhatTheFlyinFudge,2,Wed Jul 15 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"As second chair Senior Trumpet player in a 200 peice  marching band, I have been playing for about seven years. I believe that range is not as important when working on auditions. At my school, district, and all state try outs, we are required to play all major scales, 2 prepared pieces, and sight reading. All are important. Some basic fundamentals to work on would include Tone, Techniques, Air, Vibrato, and finally Musicality.  I'll begin with Tone. Tone is super important because it's the underlying factor behind other fundamentals. If you don't have good Tone, it is increasingly harder to tune, not frack notes, and play higher notes. In order to work on Tone, simply play long tones. Work more on notes you don't feel they sound as good as others. For example, my mid staff C sounds great, but my high staff E doesn't sound as good, maybe alittle closed up. So I keep this in mind and play the E for a long period of time, adjusting in different ways, being sure to use proper breath control and such. Also, a great excercise is the Vincent Excercise Tone Control. If you would like, I can post pictures of the 10 excercises.   Next on the list is Techniques. I use the word very loosely that includes finger placement, speed of forsaid fingers, double and triple tounging, and abilities to recognize rythms. Ways to improve this skill is simply by playing fast pieces accurately. The Abrans book has great Characteristic Studies that help with techniques. If any further questions, feel free to ask.  On to the next subject, I'll include Air, Vibrato, and Musicality under the same category since they can be lined easily together. Be sure to use alot of Air and get in the habit of taking in the most air you can. And do not hold the air in. Have a nice, relaxed release of air. Once your air flow is steady and strong, you should begin to work on Vibrato which then leads into Musicality. Musicality is the ability to make music out of anything including humdrum scales. Crescendos and decrescendos. Virbatos to help with shaping the music. As always feel free to ask any questions you might have!"

I'm pretty decent at sight reading, but I recently quit then came back due to some personal things that went on. I'm asking for help with increasing my range because our requirements for the audition is to play 12 major scales, second octive included, as well as the arpeggios. Thank you for your comment, I'll also be working on air, tone, range, etc. My band director asked us key players to start seeing a private tutor so I'll be finding out about one shortly. Again, thank you for your feedback."
trumpet,3d9ctb,WhatanUnusualname,2,Tue Jul 14 20:50:27 2015 UTC,"A good range excersice (I maybe be miss spelling that word lol) that my band director taught me is start at mid staff G and then go up half a step to a G#, then to the A. Play the notes in a group of three's. Once you've completed the set of three. Go up a half step from the previous starting note and complete another three note set. So it would be G#, A, A#/Bb. So on and so forth. A, A#/Bb, B. Then. A#/Bb, B, C. Then B, C, C#.   Play the sets of notes at a relatively slow pace. Maybe half notes at 60bpm. Ascend to the highest note you can play. This excersice is best to do alone on a day where you don't practice anything else because you want to play almost to the point where your lips will give out. Be careful though because you can cause damage if you try and push too hard. Once you are worn out, stop. Doing this excersice every other day is a good start. Be sure to keep a full strong stream of air. And take a break between each rep.   My friend (the 1st chair player ahead of me) and I both have used this excersice, and he is well able to play a Double G and above. I currently do not have that high of range, but I can play up to a High E on a good day, and consistently hit the High C. Which is a good range for any player."

My band had to tone down our tunes a bit, because normally we're a louder group (3 horns, bass, guitar, drums). It ended up being really cool though; the situation forced us to play more intimately than we were used to for most of these songs. They bounced us a recording of the concert, too. I have yet to listen to it though."

trumpet,3d3paj,Muse96,2,Mon Jul 13 07:20:56 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, whichever you choose, do continue to keep music an active part of your life!!!  In terms of sheer physicality, yes, trombone is ""easier."" I should probably point out that technique is a little more difficult; obviously moving your wrist/arm for the slide requires more effort than pushing down valves with just your fingers.  I wouldn't say that it would be any less bothersome in a dorm setting... both instruments are loud, and you should probably look into finding a practice room in your music or arts building.   In the end, it comes down to which you enjoy more, and what kind of musical setting you want to play in. I might suggest looking into renting or checking out a trombone from your university- usually the music department has a few for technique classes and non-majors.   I honestly would suggest trying out the Euphonium first, and see how you like the low brass feel. Euphonium would be an easier transition than trombone, and if you like it, go ahead and continue to pursue trombone!"
trumpet,3d3paj,chimmeh007,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:11:57 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about high notes on trumpet. I don't consider myself a ""screamer"", but I can play above High C with relative ease. But even with all of the crazy screaming trumpet you've heard or seen, 95%+ of ALL trumpet music is below High C.    Trombone might feel easier because there is less lip tension, but you also need a more powerful air flow, and intonation can be hard to grasp, especially if you are just starting with music.    Keep playing your trumpet in the meantime. Listen to lots of trumpet players. Find someone you want to sound like. Play in a range that is comfortable. The problem with starting music as an adult is you don't want to spend the time playing Hot Cross Buns and Mary Had a Little Lamb. But those annoyingly simple exercises are the first steps to being good and comfortable with the instrument."

The higher stuffiness can be resolved with lip slurs and simply staying relaxed. My guess is you're ""trying too hard,"" and closing your throat, resulting in the stuffy sound. Long tones in the upper register, applied the same way as in the lower register, should also help.  Hope this helps!"

Obviously, without hearing you, it's more difficult to pinpoint the source of the stuffiness. Your aperture might be too big. Your throat might be closed. Maybe there's something inefficient with your embouchure setup. Think ""OH"" no matter where you are on the instrument. Super relaxed, even yawn before taking a breath.

trumpet,3czj2q,Nealium420,2,Sun Jul 12 05:06:50 2015 UTC,"As far as how much top vs. bottom lip to use, most people use around 50/50, but find what works best for you and stick with it. Everyone's anatomy is different.   About lip size/shape, that doesn't matter as much as you may think. I know great players with big lips, and they just use a big mouthpiece. It's all about finding the proper balance between your physiology and the physics of making a trumpet produce sound. Once you find the optimal combination, you'll know it."
trumpet,3czj2q,phen0men0n,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"When I play lower my jaw drops a little bit and my head tilts down.  When I go higher my head tilts back and I unfurl my lips. It works for me and maybe not for someone else. Whatever gives you the best consistent sound, is what works for you.  Also, I look at people who play like Maynard with extremely unfurled puckered lips, and then I see people play with their bottom lip rolled in, and people who don't move their lips at all.  I play a little bit more from my top lip. Maybe about 60/40 or 70/30. To be honest, it works for me and I feel comfortable for my casual playing at home and at my community jazz band.   Play what works for you :)"
trumpet,3cy7mc,ParlieCharker,2,Sat Jul 11 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"Does your placement keep you from making a good sound?  Does it hurt at all when you play?  Have you encountered anything you absolutely can't do because of your mouthpiece placement?  If you answered yes to all three questions, then yes; definitely look into changing your placement.   If you answered no to all three questions, don't bother. Keep chugging away; you'll be fine.   If you answered yes to one or two, it may be something to consider. Before you try anything, though, see if you can't work it out with some dedicated, mindful, focused practice.   Above all, though, your guide should be making a good sound."

If your school lets you I'd suggest getting a Tromba trumpet. It's a plastic horn I know, but I can't say enough good things about them. The best part is you can pick one up for under $200 so if you buy a nice concert horn, you have one for practice your not worried about being tough on."

trumpet,3cx1zt,AncientRuler777,2,Sat Jul 11 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"The Xeno custom models are all quite good but I must recommend you try before you buy. Preferably for a week or two. That's a lot of money to spend on a specialized horn when your tastes, strengths, weaknesses, approach, and even your physiology are very likely to change. Free - blowing is not necessarily better than high resistance. Xenos, imo, are usually quite free blowing while strads are more constrained. So the Xeno offers versatility in exchange for  generally asking a little more physical control from its player. The strad will play more consistently because, since the horn is more resistant it also seems to do more ""work"" than the Xeno. As you go into custom horns like the Xeno LA or Bach strad artisan then those differences are exaggerated or some other aspect of the horn is magnified at the expense of others.  Hence, for college players especially going into their first year I recommend sticking with generalist instruments like the basic Xeno or strad until their own playing has matured enough that they can state explicitly what kind of horn best compliments their approach. This takes a very long time. Longer than you realize."
trumpet,3cx1zt,ScreamerA440,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"So what you are basically saying that I should go with a standard model before delving into custom ones to see what kind of player I develop into? Sounds good, thanks!"

trumpet,3cx1zt,ScreamerA440,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:05:01 2015 UTC,One thing I would watch out for with the LA is that they are very open. A lot of people I know have tried them and they feel great at first but the open blow tires you out pretty quick. If you can push a ton of air easily then it shouldn't be a problem.

trumpet,3cx1zt,Felt_Ninja,2,Sat Jul 11 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"Find a professional store, and dedicate a significant amount of time (I'd suggest at least 3+ hours) playing on the different horns available.

trumpet,3cvqch,Nealium420,10,Sat Jul 11 04:23:04 2015 UTC,"Many advocate for the 3c over the 1 1/2c because that sound you like that you get on the 1 1/2c is attainable on the 3c as well. It doesn't happen as easily, but with the right sound concept in mind you can get it pretty quickly. It's also much easier to play efficiently on a 3c. The decrease in efficiency with a 1 1/2c will greatly affect your endurance and range (both high and low). All in all, the benefits you get from playing a 1 1/2c as opposed to a 3c just aren't great enough to make it worth playing. Keep in mind that I am speaking of my own experiences and those of others I have known. None of this may apply to you, and maybe you should stick with the 1 1/2c. However, I do suggest that you try playing on a 3c for a week or so and see how your playing changes. You might love the new mouthpiece, and if you don't, you can always switch back to a 1 1/2c."

As if players in 3cs have not graduated to the next level. It's really more like shoe sizes: you buy generic shoes as you grow until you find the right fit. After that, you buy different varieties of shoe for different purposes."
trumpet,3cvqch,ScreamerA440,2,Sat Jul 11 12:39:10 2015 UTC,"I too enjoy the sound I get from my 1 1/2 C. The problem I found was a slightly diminished range coupled with the endurance issues caused me problems when playing for hours. 3C just seems to be the sweet spot for me, but to each his own."
trumpet,3cvqch,SquishemQuick,2,Sat Jul 11 05:06:38 2015 UTC,"If it works for you, go for it. I use a 1 1/2 C myself with a little narrower throat to counter the endurance problems and range problems.  In my experience a 3C is a better all-around mouthpiece especially for non-pros. I use a 3C in Brass Quintet and most solos and a 1 1/2 in Orchestra. It all depends on how comfortable each one is."
trumpet,3cvqch,bluePMAknight,3,Sat Jul 11 07:45:05 2015 UTC,"This kind of size is actually the most common in classical. I went from a 3C to a 2, then to a 1, and my performance went better and better. Now I'm in love with my 1 1/2B.  Endurance and range are largely determined by how you play, rather than your mouthpiece size."

No other forums really give a shit either way.  I've never noticed endurance issues at all, and quite frankly, the way some people talk about their endurance problems, I suspect they're due more to poor embouchure or breath control.  You keep doing you.  The only way you know what mouthpieces work for you is to try it for a few hours.  Statistics mean nothing to the individual data point.  Edit: spelling"
trumpet,3cvqch,NotAlwaysGifs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:32:23 2015 UTC,Huh. Been here for awhile and hadn't noticed the 1 1/2C hate. I've played on a 1 1/2 since my freshman year of high school. It's the best fit for me. Now that I'm in college and understand more about mouthpieces I've delved into the custom world and have tweaked my setup. Narrower backbore for my lead stuff along with a slightly shallower cup. Slightly larger backbore for my concert band stuff (which I admittedly don't do as much now) in order to get a richer and darker tone. And it's good for solo stuff like church gigs.

trumpet,3cvqch,AMIGO64,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:43 2015 UTC,"As /u/mprangs stated, certain mouthpieces can definitely make the sounds you want happen a bit easier for others *IF THE MOUTHPIECE IS RIGHT FOR YOU* No 2 people's mouths or lungs are the same, so if something works for you then your playing on the correct equipment. That being said... if MOST trumpeters prefer one over the other, then chances are that it would be beneficial to you to pay attention to that. For me as a jazz trombone player, I was trying to play a 7c like all the other cats, because you know a small mouthpiece is good for lead trombone playing... Or so I thought, then I switched to a way WAY bigger mouthpiece, and because I have bigger Arabic bird lips my range actually increased when I switched to bigger equipment. Play what works for you, but don't ignore what all the other guys are doing."

trumpet,3cw0bq,AsianOnTheLeft,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:18:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there are errors in both of them.  It's nothing you can't take a pencil to, though.  I have plenty books I've done 2-second edits to, and they're fine.  I don't have any experience with the 2nd one, but it appears to have a CD with recordings of the characteristic studies included.  Most people are deterred from even bothering with them since they're afraid to play them without hearing them first.  I that describes you (be honest with yourself - that's all I ask of people in their practicing), buy the one with the CD.  If you're willing to dive in without audio reference first, either is fine.  I don't remember if the 2nd one is spine-bound, or spiral bound.  The biggest issue with the Arban book, is that it's so big, that it's difficult to keep open on a music stand without mangling the thing.  If someone remembers whether the 2nd one has a spiral binding, please chime in.  If so, I'd definitely recommend that one for sheer convenience.  I should warn you beforehand: if you haven't used the Arban book before, I'd suggest also picking up a copy of Eric Bolvin's ""Arban Manual"" book.  The Arban method itself isn't something you'd do in sequence, but have to jump around in.  Because of that, it can be difficult to find exactly what you should be doing in correspondence with other stuff.  This book gives you page numbers and exercises.  Check with Eric as to whether it lines up with newer editions, however.  I think he may have done it based on the old pagination...  http://bolvinmusic.com/product/arban-manual/"

trumpet,3ct7eh,majorkev,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"I personally hate megatons for several reasons.   One is pedagogical, the weight of the mouthpiece allows for a most pronounced attack and a ""darker"" sound. Unfortunately the mouthpiece over-corrects and the player (usually younger students) never develop the ability to do it on a lighter, more standard mouthpiece. Same with sound concept  The other is that in my opinion most people have a dead sound when they use them. It's more of a specialty mouthpiece than a common use mouthpiece. I could see it being used in an orchestra for something like the Mahler post horn solo or an offstage solo to get the right sound, but typically the musicians that are playing music of that caliber don't need the assistance.  Of course this is just... Like... My opinion man."

But, these are incredibly well done!  Gusty Gardens has always been one of my favorites.  It literally brought a tear to my eye.  So now I'm curious about your particular logistical approach.  You mention recording low parts first.  Do you use a click track for the first tracks, or all the tracks?  How many of the other parts are you listening to as you record?  Your intonation across so many tracks makes me think that you're listening to a least some of your parts.    What equipment do you use to record (both audio and video)?  What software to you use to edit?"

(Strive for 2 octaves if you can)  And might I say, it's nice to meet another Theme Park Musician. I played over the summers while I was in college."
trumpet,3cn13e,bannix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:15:35 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with you on the trumpet covers. I remember searching Youtube when I started, and couldn't find anything like what I wanted to do. So I just went with it.  As for how I record, it depends as to whether I use a click track, actual recording, or click track and midi file to play along with. If I'm just playing along with the recording, I'll have a click track count in of around 3 bars. I always start with the lower parts first, and make sure the bass is in tune. From there, it's either continue with some sort of recording or just playing with the lower trumpet parts. If I decide to just play with the parts I've recorded, whatever I've laid down is what I record with. It helps with intonation.  I use Audacity to record my audio. The actual microphone is an H2n Zoom plugged into my usb port. I'll record all the parts in that first. Once I'm happy with that, I'll save each trumpet part to a .wav file, and import them into Reaper. I only use Reaper to add reverb, because Audacity does not use VSTs. Specifically, I use Ambience (Magnus @ Smartelectron:x). It has presets. I'll mess around with the sliders on that till I'm happy. I usually pan the trumpet parts left or right before this.  Video is recorded with a Logitech HD webcam and OBS. All video is done after I've finished the recording. It's kind of like miming along, but I am playing everything. It's hard to record everything I've written in 1 take. Especially by the 10th trumpet part.  And finally, I take those video files and put them together in Blender (a free 3D animation program that has a video editor). I'll record some gameplay footage with OBS as well to put in the center of the frame. Hope that answers your questions!"

trumpet,3cn13e,midairmatthew,5,Thu Jul 9 14:20:00 2015 UTC,"It usually takes me around a month.   Writing/transcribing takes about a 3-4 days Learning and recording is done at the same time. (I'll finger through while I'm writing the piece out or play to make sure I can do it). This takes the longest. I'll usually record all the lower trumpets in 1 day. The upper parts are done as my chops will allow. Editing the recording takes me around 3 days. Making the video is done in one day.   And that's about it. Although, I know I've missed this months video. I've been busy with gigs and some other stuff. Hope that answers your question!"

trumpet,3clluo,plarpco,6,Wed Jul 8 21:26:41 2015 UTC,I think a good idea might be to get him involved with a youth band. If you surround him with people his age who like band and are proficient on their instruments (at or above his level) he'll have a reason to practice. I did this with a youth brass band and it was an amazing experience and put me in a place where I had to practice for the band and I really started to dig the music we made.

But, outside of that, I don't think he'll have time to join another band. Even though he's ""opting in"" to band this year, I know that unless he finds some personal motivation, he'll have trouble sticking with it.   I assume that if he can continue through to high school, options for more specific bands (concert, marching, symphonic, jazz, etc) will open up for him.   He does jam with his brother (violin) occasionally and I'm trying to find stuff that all three of us (I play some guitar) can play together. Thanks!"
trumpet,3clluo,kickbrass,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"I think that an outside of school band is best because you don't really find the kids who have been forced into it. (Even when band is optional there are lots of kids who won't take it seriously and/or have been forced in by their parents) Most Youth Bands tend to rehearse once a week for an hour, but it depends on the organization. Another thing to look into is your high school, depending on your sons grade level and how serious the program is at the high school, they may just let him play with them. Whatever happens, good luck!!"

I think that may have been your biggest downfall - you need the energy to keep moving.  You seem really enveloped in your music. Memorization is a very liberating tool that can help us feel relaxed (believe it or not) and musically free.  What recordings did you listen to of this? Another one of my biggest comments is that you're really missing the Belgian style here. Subtlety is key, especially with different colors and articulations.  Have you studied the etude this piece is based off of? A complete harmonic and structural analysis is crucial with this kind of music.  You're releases, especially in the slow section when you're breathing are abrupt and distracting. Relax, let the sound come and go naturally.  You never once made eye contact with your pianist. Just because you're playing a solo doesn't mean you need to be so far away from your accompanist. There are so many moments in this piece that are chamber music and you need to create it. This becomes even more increasingly important when you being to fall apart and get lost, which happens often in this performance. Eye contact, communication, it's all so incredibly important."

In fact, there are fairly opposite methods of achieving the same results, and any combination of things may work for a given person.  This is why there are different mouthpieces, instruments, microphones, etc."

I'm sure you've been told a million times (assuming someone taught you trumpet) to tighten your embrechure (fuck I hope I spelt that right) and breathe faster air, but that's the best way to get up there. For me when I'm trying to build on my range I just do a chromatic c scale as high as I can over and over, keep a fingering chart out and try and play a little higher each time. Does wonders for your range."

trumpet,3cgcqb,Felt_Ninja,0,Wed Jul 8 06:37:47 2015 UTC,"It's not a big deal really, but I've been in that boat, and I realize it can be annoying.  Some solutions:   Apply some alcohol to a Q-tip, and wipe the thread clean.  There may be some lubrication keeping it movable.  Alcohol will help remove it. Apply a thick grease (like Hetman #9) to the thread, to disable it from moving easily.  Best to do this after the previous method. Buy new stems, if the threads simply don't hold.  I might actually suggest talking to a manufacturer that makes aftermarket stems, and mentioning the issue to them.  Pickett Brass makes such a product for a multitude of manufacturers' instruments, as does Curry Mouthpieces.   Is it a new horn, or did you get it used?"
trumpet,3cec9s,phytoplexus,2,Tue Jul 7 06:32:10 2015 UTC,"The Bach 229/25H Large Bore (Hence the CL, C Tuning, Large Bore) is pretty much the standard C Trumpet for any serious orchestral player. The only real argument would be for the 239 bell, but that's mainly preference of tone.    Check you Serial Number here and see what year it was made: http://bachloyalist.com/serials/serial_trumpet.htm    More or less, if it is actually ""mint"" condition, the year of manufacture will be the deciding factor in the value. People would pay out the nose for one from the Late 50s - Mid 60s in mint condition. And if it's from the mid 60s - 70s, those are still thought of VERY highly as ""player's  horns"". If yours is from around 2005 (which I am guessing from the timeline of your post) that is likely during the Bach Strike era, so it may not fetch as much as other horns in similar condition.    It is a safe bet, if the silver is near-perfect, and there are no dents or dings, to ask $2,000 and have someone talk you down. If there is some light silver wear and a few dings here and there, $1,800 is a good starting point. But again, the year of manufacture has a huge impact on the value of a Bach. A mint condition Mt Vernon Large Bore C could EASILY fetch $5,000."
trumpet,3cec9s,tyerker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:55:23 2015 UTC,Likely a Bach. Is it silver plated? That will also determine the value.   I'm a band teacher and I spent 6 years working at the top music chain in Canada. I can probably help you out a bit

Even if you never touched it after it left the shop, it is still used. And just like a car it did lose a decent chunk of its worth.

They'll teach you how to shoot, don't worry about that.  But, if you're at all serious about joining up, you need to be in shape.  Start running, start doing push-ups, start doing sit-ups.  Today.  Might as well throw in some pull-ups, too, in case you're insane and want to join the Marines."
trumpet,3cdd5i,carlsaganblessyou,2,Tue Jul 7 06:02:28 2015 UTC,"I'll walk you through the typical experience, although it will be specific to the Marine Corps. I was in a Marine band from 2010-2014.  Talk to a recruiter, he'll make sure you're a qualified candidate. This includes being medically sound, and passing a fitness test. If so, you'll sign a contract and enlist. This is not committing to go to boot camp, you just need to enlist before you can audition. You can back out until the day you ship.  You'll take an audition, possibly over the phone and then a second one in person. It will consist of a prepared piece, scales (major, harmonic, melodic, and natural minors) and sight reading.  If you pass that, you're ready to go to boot camp. At this point, you are guaranteed to go to the school of music.  Boot camp(Basic Training): Here's the fun part. You'll spend 13 weeks in San Diego, If you live west of the Mississippi, or Parris Island, SC if you live on the east. It's the same boot camp every Marine goes through. It will suck. You will do a LOT of physical training. You will learn to shoot. You will be punished as a group for other peoples' mistakes. You will be asked questions with no right answer and be punished for getting them wrong. This is part of the process, you'll get used to it, and it's only 3 months of your life. You'll graduate, a band will even be at the ceremony, and you'll go home for 10 days.  Marine Combat Training (MCT): Here, you will learn the basics of fighting as an infantryman. You'll be trained on a variety of weapon systems, such as a few machine guns and the hand grenade. This is only a 4 week course, and is actually pretty fun. You'll be treated better than in bootcamp, but your freedom will still be limited.  Navy School of Music: What you signed up for. You'll start a 6 month course at the Navy School of Music in Virginia Beach. You'll train directly alongside the Navy. The Army and National Guard train their musicians here as well, but they have a completely separate 10 week course. You'll play in a variety of ensembles, learn to march and do band specific drill, and get weekly private lessons.   You will have a lot more freedom with your time, pretty much doing what you want outside of school hours. You will spend a lot of this time in a practice room however, as you will need to take another audition at the halfway stage, and completion of the course, demonstrating improvement.  Field Band:After nearly a year of training, you will graduate the SoM and get sent to a band. There are 3 in southern California, 4 on the east coast, and one in New Orleans, Hawaii, and Okinawa. You will play in ceremonies, at civilian functions, and go on recruiting tours to different cities. You will play both in full band concert and ceremonial settings, as well as in small ensembles such as brass quintets, or big bands. In addition to your musical duties, you will have a logistical job such as working in the band's supply or administration area.  It is a really cool job, but it is a lot of work and isn't for everyone. You will be a Marine first and a musician second. If it sounds like something you'd enjoy, feel free to PM me."

Here's how it is on the Army side of things: A few Drill Sergeants are going to yell at you for no real reason, and some of the ""PT as punishment"" stuff really sucks, but the main thing you'll be annoyed by is how...um...""not bright"" a lot of the other soldiers will be. Expect to be punished quite a bit when other people mess stuff up. Eventually it's over, you're not sure where the time went, and you get to hang out with band geeks in Virginia Beach. (I'm not entirely sure how long AIT is anymore. It was only two weeks when I did it, but I think they've made it longer.)  Generally, band members have way higher ASVAB scores than the other people, so as long as you're in decent shape, basic isn't all that much of a challenge.

trumpet,3cd0d7,RandomHaxor,3,Mon Jul 6 23:20:45 2015 UTC,Nice thorough review! I wouldn't have expected something so decent from Allora. Know anyone with a pTrumpet so you can compare the two?
trumpet,3cd0d7,BandAnd,2,Tue Jul 7 00:16:41 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I do not, but I would have to assume that the pTrumpet is similar in quality. Before I bought the Aere, I did do some research across various internet forums- the general consensus seems to be that the Tiger Trumpet is expensive and low quality (a lot of people seem to have issues with the valves), the Allora usually got decent comments, and I didn't see much about the pTrumpet, although from the video of Alison Balsom playing one I'm sure it holds its own against the Allora.    A couple months ago, when I was first considering purchasing the Aere, I asked someone with many, many years of experience with brass instruments about plastic trumpets, and he said the one he had seen (I think he said it was a couple years ago?) was pretty much completely trash- I'm going to have to assume it was a Tiger or an early model of the Allora/Tromba, as I don't believe the pTrumpet had been released then."

Play a bit of piano to give your chops a break and work on hearing the progression. All the greatest players can play piano to a semi good degree.

That said, this is a wildly outdated method of writing (at least, the example you've shown us), and it generally died off mid-century.  You don't see it too much anymore, unless somebody is getting grants to write art pieces.  The rest of us do what we're told to, in order to obtain money for writing."

It will work, but it will compromise your tone quality and you will have to make sure all three valve slides are pulled out an appropriate amount as well as the main tuning slide. Transposition is a very useful and important tool anyways, so it's best to practice it every chance you get!"
trumpet,3btztq,mprangs,5,Thu Jul 2 04:57:58 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that the tuning from your slides is also in play when using valves.  You'd have to adjust them as well.  This is why multi-key horns have extra sets of slides.
trumpet,3btztq,Yeargdribble,3,Thu Jul 2 04:28:13 2015 UTC,Transpose it. Always. The valve slides are not long enough for you to just pull the tuning slide out and have the instrument be in tune.   Transpose it.

trumpet,3btztq,CeaselessIntoThePast,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:04:16 2015 UTC,You have to change the valve slides as well because their lengths are based on a horn in Bb. It's the same reason that my C and Bb horns have different valve lengths. Pulling the tuning slide out doesn't magically change everything.
trumpet,3btztq,statlinardos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:29:15 2015 UTC,"There is no way that horn will have the same tone quality in both tunings. I am saying this because the physics of the horn simply does not work that way, not because I've never tried it. If you don't change the valve slide lengths as well the valves would no longer be able to change the length of the horn in the same way. Valve lengths are based of percentages of the length of the horn so just pulling out your tuning slide throws off all those numbers greatly. Yes, you might be able to get the correct pitches out of the horn, but the tone quality would change, and suffer, because of that. Also, a handful of other problems would arise when you did this. Just Transpose."
trumpet,3btztq,statlinardos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:36:11 2015 UTC,"No need to be an asshole about it, you guys are both right. Your transposing trumpet probably does play just fine, however there is definitely going to be tonal differences in the A side of the trumpet and in the Bb side of the trumpet. For normal trumpets not designed for this.. It may work, however the intonation will not be very accurate, and your working against the physics of the horn. I play different sized brass instruments and have an old King. Don't try to tell me that intonation is not affected because old King and HN White horns are notorious for intonation problems.   TLDR: No need to get upset, Your both right."
trumpet,3btztq,YourBrainOnJazz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:42:02 2015 UTC,"As to the old King and H.N. White horns being riddled with intonation glitches...  Yes and no.  If they're in proper working order ( which they almost never are, because they've almost all been played to the point where the valves leak and need a major alignment, stuff is loose everywhere, receivers are worn out, etc), they play like a million bucks.  Weekday people don't understand, is that these horns didn't always play like old horns.  At one point, they were brand new.  With most common issues fixed on these things, they actually start to play on par with what you'd expect out of a horn.  The biggest issue comes with having the pistons replated and lapped to fit the instrument again, which is costly and time-consuming.    If you ever get your hands on a time capsule example of these things, try it out.  You might be thoroughly surprised."

Not even in the Stevens, or Kennan, or Rite of Spring, but everything.    Put your metronome on 200 (or even slower, if you want to do it right) and go to town.  Get real familiar with the piano part too.  Know when to listen and feel, and know when to count.  Another tip:  in the 1st movement, in that tricky lick in 3/4 starting on a written F#: in the 3rd bar, finger the four sixteenths on the downbeat 2-0-1-2, taking advantage of the normally out of tune 7th harmonic.  I can't take credit for that, but without namedropping, a player a lot better than myself gave me that one.  PM me if that didn't make sense, I'll be happy to explain it differently."

trumpet,3bq4ph,the_person,12,Wed Jul 1 06:27:59 2015 UTC,"Too much pressure (hurts endurance).  Focusing on tensed up chops (hurts endurance and range).  Over practicing (hurts endurance and stunts getting better).  Not practicing enough (stunts growth and you lose consistency). Using too much air (hurts endurance and you risk lip injury or hernias).  Bad lip placement (use what works but find the position that gives you the best sound and best playability).   Really focus on practicing with less pressure and focus on your air work.  As soon as you start pulling then put the horn down and rest. You're smashing your lip between metal and bone.  A good exercise to do is when practicing, cup the bottom of the trumpet.  It's a lot harder to pull and forces you to use your air better. Tense up enough at the corners of your mouth and focus on leaving what's in the mouthpiece, relaxed.  This is a big air thing, again. Simple, don't practice for hours a day till you work up to it. As soon as you start missing notes during practice and start pulling or straining, rest! But make sure to practice enough so that you notice over time, things get easier.  Overblowing is a huge problem.  You don't need a lot of air to play trumpet.  You need fast efficient air.  A lot of people overblow and while that might help you in a short time, over the long period it will cause damage to your chops and hurt playing consistency. There's a way that's most efficient for you. A lot of people use a certain embouchure because that's what they were taught. But look for a teacher who you'd like to play like, and have him examine your embouchure.  To be fair, just about everything here will be helped by a teacher whom you'd like to be able to play like."

trumpet,3boteh,gramson,5,Sat Jul 4 06:06:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless your a screaming type lead player, be happy if your Eb is a comfortable one. Focus on other things in your playing, ESPECIALLY YOUR SOUND. Range means literally nothing if it's not pleasing to listen to.  If you do some whistling or mouthpiece exercises, you'll notice there is a break in the harmonic between a sounding Do-diez (C#) and a Re (D) or if you're playing on Bb trumpet, Eb and E. It takes time, patience, and consistent development of everything else around that area to work past it.  And, as others have said, completely get rid of the idea of ""pressure"" in general. It's not welcome if you want to effectively and efficiently play this instrument."
trumpet,3boteh,souperawesome,2,Wed Jul 1 15:30:06 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same problem for a long time. I think what helped me most was going up in 5ths (chromatically so start at F in the staff to C, then F# to C#, etc as high as you can go). You might find that it's easier to hit the E when you're not coming from Eb."
trumpet,3boteh,phen0men0n,2,Wed Jul 1 05:09:06 2015 UTC,I will try that for sure. I know that more pressure is never the answer haha but I guess that was my last ditch effort for the note. I just find it to be a strange gap in my range. Thanks for the advice guys!
trumpet,3boteh,htfihn,2,Wed Jul 1 14:35:09 2015 UTC,That same E used to be a gap in my upper register as well. Best advice I can give is to keep working on expanding your range (high and low). Eventually you'll gain the air and embouchure control to find that slot on any horn.

trumpet,3bp9df,jpman117,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:32:26 2015 UTC,"My own personal recommendation is to do lots of buzzing on the mouthpiece and do those high notes, because you'd look/feel rediculous jamming a mouthpiece into your face as hard as you're jamming your trumpet.   Confession: I found myself doing this too, and too a period of a few months just buzzing the mouthpiece, generally for an hour or two (three?) while watching movies each night, because I (a) wanted to get used to not jamming the horn into my face and (b) I wanted to get over the mental barrier, of ""Oh, this note is above  the staff, this is hard"" etc.   I succeeded in those goals.   Where the ""pressure"" needs to be, is in your gut, and it's that plus the shape of the mouth cavity which is shaped by tongue level.

trumpet,3bpbqt,Kinkymoose5,5,Wed Jul 1 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Trumpet's not an easy instrument and can get frustrating when you're first starting out. It's recommended that you get lessons with a teacher to avoid developing bad habits, and you'll make better progress having someone to guide you rather than trying to learn on your own. (some people can learn on their own, but it's very tough and not recommended especially if you don't have prior experience with a wind instrument)    Trumpet requires daily practice to keep your facial muscles in shape, this is the case with brass instruments. Long breaks will leave your muscles out of shape.    It also takes a long time to get good at trumpet, especially in regards to tone.    If you want to try out trumpet, it's best to rent one for a few months and take a few lessons to see if it's something you want to continue doing, otherwise you'll be out quite a bit more money if you buy a horn and give up.    Is your heart set on trumpet? I'd also like to recommend saxophone since it's more forgiving towards beginners, and can also fit into most music styles. No instrument is easy and all take practice to get good at, but sax is better for casual playing and sounds better when a beginner is playing it.    Of course the decision is all up to you, just be aware of what you're getting into before jumping into it."

Use a #2 reed, don't go higher than #2-1/2 for your first year.   Sax was designed to combine the best attributes of the trumpet and the clarinet. The fingering is logical, the sound is bold, and aside from the guitar, it's probably the easiest instrument to starting sounding good soon.   Trumpet is ... well ...

Loads of people get caught up in degree this and masters that, but I have never been called for a gig that asked if I had a college degree. If you want to play for a living, the only thing that matters is CAN YOU PLAY. College can be beneficial, because it's pretty much 4 years of forced practice. But it is not necessary. Loads and loads of musicians graduate with performance degrees every year and do not get jobs because they have spent their last 4 years practicing instead of networking. Then they take out an even bigger loan and go to grad school where the process gets repeated. If you want a symphony job, then maybe a performance degree is the right track because of all the practice and technical focus. Even then, how often do symphony jobs open up? The best ones are taken, and there are a hundred trumpet players better than you that are waiting on them. The symphony is a dying art form, too. There are already too few jobs left, and it's only getting worse.   My advice, if your playing is not developed to the point that you can start getting gigs, maybe try college for a while until you can. But beware of the financial black hole that is college. It's not an easy hole to climb out of, especially for musicians. The best trombone player I have ever played with dropped out of college because he was touring with The Temptations more often than he was going to class. They didn't care that he didn't have a degree, and neither does anyone else."
trumpet,3bn2qt,phen0men0n,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"This is the gospel.  Most people I know who are playing for a living or at least making a serious side job out of playing either didn't go to college or dropped out early to take playing jobs.  Nobody cares what credentials you have.  You just need to show up on time and be prepared to do whatever you're asked to do.  Your reputation wild start networking for you.  Aside from the potential financial debacle of college, there's the problem with the academic music world.  It's teachers teaching students to be teachers mostly.  There also tends to be a major focus toward orchestral focus as a result.  The orchestral world is not only very cutthroat, but it's also probably where the absolute least demand is.  It's cutthroat because so many schools are pushing out people with only that skill set and no others all to compete against one another for literally a handful of available jobs.  And of course, it's just easier (from a teaching perspective) to tell someone to play exactly one way and how to interpret things in a very strictly black and white sense.  It's harder to talk about improv and developing your own sound and things that are more difficult to nail down.  Unless you specifically go down the jazz studies route, you'll be pigeonholed into a type of playing that just isn't marketable enough.  If you want to play, you need to be versatile.  You need to be able to show up to any job you take and do it.  There's a good deal of work out there in all kind of groups... rock bands, jazz groups, studio stuff, musical theatre... but you'd never know about any of that or how to play those styles from what you'll learn in most college trumpet studios.  You'll learn how to play the standard literature very well and maybe some orchestral excerpts on all the keyed horns.  Also, if you want to seriously play for a living, I wouldn't put all your eggs in the trumpet basket.  Pick up a harmony instrument.  I've been piano about 1/3 as long as trumpet and I make vastly more money from piano gigs than from trumpet gigs.  There's work out there for good guitarists and pianists and you can end up picking up work from multiple ends.  But ultimately, I'd say if you want to play for a living... don't.  Find a job that pays well and lets you play seriously on the side.  Go to college for something else you enjoy, but stay engaged in the music program.  Then you can get out, have a great paying job, and gig on the side for fun and pocket money and feel free to turn down gigs you're not into, because if you're playing for a living, you'll be doing a lot of work you don't love.  And if you do go to college for music, be very inquisitive about what they aren't teaching you.  I find musical academia actively tries to breed a sort of elitism.  You're supposed to venerate people like Phil Smith and ignore people like Rashawn Ross because one does the ""proper"" type of music and the other does pop.  Music schools do a good job of literally pretending the last 100 years of musical development just didn't happen.  But hey, who am I to complain?  I'm making bank off of what most degreed musicians never learned and wrote off as a lower form.  I'm using the best of both worlds to my advantage and it makes me sick at how it's taught in college.  Honestly, I don't think anyone should be able to major in performance as an undergrad at all because they are being sold a false bill of goods based largely on misinformation, big dreams, and naivete.  And I don't think the colleges are being malicious about it.  I think they are just ignorant.  It's generations of people who don't make a living playing teaching people how to teach others how to make a living playing.  There's so little first hand going on there."
trumpet,3bn2qt,Yeargdribble,3,Wed Jul 1 08:57:45 2015 UTC,There's a job market for playing trumpet?
trumpet,3bn2qt,AperionProject,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:13:38 2015 UTC,Endless. You can go out busking almost everywhere. People will ask you to play at their party/funeral/wedding/etc. People will ask you for lessons.

trumpet,3bkxp4,A_Cunning_Plan,2,Tue Jun 30 01:46:23 2015 UTC,How are you measuring the pitch? The tuning slide usually faces you so you can pull it out. Play with it until you get the pitch right.
trumpet,3bkxp4,Sir_not_sir,2,Tue Jun 30 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"I'm playing a middle C on an online keyboard.  The slide closest to me doesn't seem to affect the pitch much.  This is probably ridiculous and I should just wait until I start lessons, but thank you for bearing with me."
trumpet,3bkxp4,Dontslip,6,Tue Jun 30 02:03:12 2015 UTC,"If you're playing an open C on your trumpet (a written middle C), then the pitch you need to tune to on a keyboard (or any concert pitch instrument) is B flat."
trumpet,3bkxp4,Sir_not_sir,2,Tue Jun 30 02:48:55 2015 UTC,"Excellent! I was hoping it was just a notation misunderstanding on my part.  So open C on a b flat trumpet is a b flat, and all is right in the world again :)"
trumpet,3bkxp4,The_Amazing_Shlong,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:05:29 2015 UTC,"Try the slide at the other end then. Designs vary, but the tuning slide is always the first or second bend from the mouthpiece.  Also, most trumpets are Bb, so that's what you should tune to."
trumpet,3bkxp4,GalacticShonen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, according to the other responses here, C is b flat.  Coming from piano, that's a little new to me, but I can learn to deal with it :)  Thank you for your help!"

I started in March and have been breathing much deeper and easier since I started cardio. Not to mention it gives you more energy throughout the day and helps you sleep deeper to process all that practicing you've been doing with all your extra energy.  Just start slow. Run 100m at a time until you can run 200m at a time, etc. try to get to a 5k everyday. You'll lose weight, feel better, breathe easier, and be a better trumpet player for it."
trumpet,3bjko6,bluePMAknight,2,Mon Jun 29 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I agree with what you said. At the moment my routine involves running just a mile, and once I am able to keep that in under 8 minutes consistently, I will move onto a mile and a half, etc. all while trying to stay as close to the 8 minute mark as I can."
trumpet,3bjko6,mnokeefe,5,Mon Jun 29 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"Running too fast too early is a classic rookie mistake that everyone makes.  I run quite heavily, including a recent 2:55 marathon (that's 6:40/mile for 26.2miles) and yet I do most of my running at 8min/mile pace or slower.  You'll improve a lot quicker and feel more benefits by just slowing down and running for longer. 8 minutes of exercise really isn't a lot!  On topic: I really do think being fit helps with trumpet playing. A lot of people suggest yoga as well."
trumpet,3bjko6,bluePMAknight,5,Mon Jun 29 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"Dude I've been running everyday for 6 months and I can't even do an 8 minute mile haha.

Plus weather is less of a factor if you have access to an indoor pool via the YMCA or something similar."

trumpet,3bjvia,RocktimusCrime,4,Mon Jun 29 20:57:51 2015 UTC,"lol, as a MuEd major, French horn was the hardest instrument to play. You have to be so delicate and everything has to be perfect or you frack or miss a partial. With trumpet, you think about what you want to play, and how you want to play it, and you use a solid column of air and tell the horn what to do.  Kind of like the difference between fencing and using a broadsword. Either can be incredible efficient, but both have to be approached differently.  To put it in yet another way, I find lip control to be more technical with french horn, whereas air is more of the controller in trumpet."
trumpet,3bjvia,Greflin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:41:56 2015 UTC,"I started out as a trumpet player, then moved to horn for concert and marching while doing jazz trumpet. What the other person here said is spot on. With a horn if you aren't particular you will miss your note and it will sound bad. Trumpet, you tell it what to do, and put the air behind it and the notes come out. I found both to be similar in some ways, you should have no problem. a lot of their fingerings are the same."
trumpet,3bjvia,Massive_bhuna,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:09:16 2015 UTC,"You'll have to adopt a slightly different embouchure for trumpet. With horn, the mouthpiece is angled downwards and relies on using a lot of top lip. For trumpet, you'll want to straighten it out a little bit or your trumpet will be pointing at the floor. Overall, you may want to lower the mouthpiece a little for trumpet to use a bit more bottom lip, but this is a really personal thing, some people use top to bottom lip ratios and tell their students that they must follow the 30:70 top to bottom etc etc, but you should really do what feels most comfortable and allows maximum flexibility.  Most of all, as I'm sure you already know, take it slowly and give your lips a chance to adapt. Lay off the pressure and just focus on the air, don't try and force a buzz. The instrument will take care of the noise."

trumpet,3b9m5g,noobbuster,5,Sat Jun 27 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one... When I played taps for my grandfather's funeral I had prepared for months, probably spent about 10 hours solid practicing nothing but taps. Before that I'd played trumpet for 10+ years and I was still nervous as hell. If you're set on learning it I would highly suggest a few lessons with a private teacher."
trumpet,3b9m5g,msandovalabq,3,Sat Jun 27 03:53:54 2015 UTC,"Well, when I was a beginner, to build any chops, my teacher would pull the mouthpiece out of the trumpet, get a small straw that can go through the mouthpiece. Put it in, blow air, and as you blow air, slowly ease the mouthpiece towards your lips and that should be the familiar position that your lips should be.  Now whether or not you'll be able to play taps so soon, I highly doubt it especially if you can't get your chops such a shape due to the octaves you'll play through at this level despite not using any valves. (unless it's a different variation of taps but I doubt it.)"
trumpet,3b9m5g,SuicidalShoe,2,Sat Jun 27 03:11:50 2015 UTC,"Are you playing it for some kind of ceremony? If so, how long do you have to prepare? If it's any less than several months I would be worried. Taps/last post isn't complicated but it would still be very challenging for a beginner player. I always recommend lessons for anyone getting started. Wind instruments are not like guitar, piano, drums, etc. Teaching yourself is very difficult and can lead to all kinds of bad habits."
trumpet,3b9m5g,OnTheMattack,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:10:55 2015 UTC,"I'm a trumpet player in a U.S. Army band, I consider Taps the most important 24 notes of my career. If you are working toward a solemn ceremony memorializing a death, get a professional. If you are doing it just for the fun of it or to put some people to sleep, push down the first valve, or the first and second valve to make it sound lower. You could do all three but that messes with the tone/intonation. As far as advice for executing Taps, sing it, play it on the mouthpiece, listen to it here a couple thousand times, and play it until your face doesn't work a few times a day. Building trumpet chops is very similar to building any muscle. Getting a lesson wouldn't be a bad idea either."

trumpet,3b9m5g,Valorya,0,Mon Jun 29 23:15:23 2015 UTC,"Playing a trumpet and a bugle are the same, the only difference is that a trumpet can change the size of the overall tubing (the valves direct the air to the other slides) to change how the instrument resonates, thus producing a different note. A bugle only can play notes within harmonic series, the trumpet can play all the same notes as the bugle but has a wide range of other notes. You can play taps on both instruments the same way. I suggest practicing on the trumpet and getting lessons to form your embouchure"

I've heard people try to espouse such things before, personally I think that is never the case unles you have a lip ring or a fully split-in-two-halves lip.  What you're probably experiencing is the difficult nature of playing trumpet. It often has to do with breathing. Your shoulders should never be raised, always relaxed, along with your neck and air passageways. Your gut area should expand with air - and you use those muscles, in your gut, not the ones in your shoulders/neck/face. Lay on the floor and put your hands on your belly - feel & see your hands moving up as your belly expands with air? That's what you want to do while standing & playing the horn.  Your teacher should be teaching you this, and practice daily with proper breathing.   Also, can you buzz on the mouthpiece? Do you play longtones? Those two things will get you where you want to be. They are boring, and tedious but there are no shortcuts as I've found out the hard way before."

trumpet,3b4bom,master4510,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:53:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like my Yamaha piece has a more full sound overall, and I will continue using it for most general playing.    The Parduba sounds a bit thinner in general, and the tone is not nearly as good when playing low. However, up in the high range is where the Parduba shines, and it seems like high notes sound clearer on this piece.   I feel like it (the Parduba) is most suited for a setting such as marching band where tone is not of the utmost importance--I'll definitely use it for marching but I most likely wouldn't use it for solo work or in a concert setting.    One other unexpected observation to note, articulation was fairly difficult with the Parduba. Double tonguing was pretty hard, as was fast single tonguing"
trumpet,3b4bom,master4510,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:20:58 2015 UTC,"That was sort of what I expected, but thank you!

Not something I was used to, or expecting. It also helps you move into an area where you could care less if someone hears you make a mistake.  As someone that took a long break. Don't stop playing. Find a place. Find a community band. Anything. Anyone to play with. An opportunity will come up. Stand on a corner if you have to. I bought a plastic horn for travel, and I'm walking to the park and playing with that as well. It's not ideal, but it keeps me on the horn. If you love playing, Play. It's frustrating. All that time and effort, don't throw it away because the going gets tough. Get creative."

Then they would proceed to ""show me"" by putting on some stupid mexican hiphop that has a trumpet synth in it.  It got so bad I had to leave.

When it's cold, which it is most of the year, I had no place to play. I can brave it down to the mid-20's, but after that it gets difficult to play. Try asking a music store if you can use some space. Churches as well. My brass quintet traded practice space to perform on Sundays for free.   I stopped playing for 17 years because of lack of space. I'm back on the horn, and I  not taking any excuses. I know a saxophone that had to go play near the highway. It's frustrating, but keep at it. Talk to as many people as you can.

trumpet,3b2i8b,lookoutforbears,4,Thu Jun 25 13:10:43 2015 UTC,"It's very hard to learn trumpet on your own, it's easy to develop bad habits without someone there next to you hearing what you sound like and seeing what you're doing right and wrong. Trumpet's pretty unforgiving and takes a long time to sound good. If you can't take lessons, saxophone might be a better option. No instrument is easy, but sax is easier to pick up after you learn the fingerings and more forgiving (you can play it more casually) and you can sound decent on it as a beginner.    As for the piercings, I personally have no idea. I'd be afraid of injury with the kind of embouchure required for trumpet. Your lips get sore after a while of playing which might make the piercing hurt and affect your playing. I only have ear piercings, but quite a few of them including an industrial bar, and even if I slept on that thing wrong I've had it get super sore to the point it started bleeding. Sax might be a lot easier on the piercings as you don't need to fit your whole lip inside of a small mouthpiece. I know in ska and reggae, brass horns like trombone and trumpet are used a lot but I'm pretty sure sax is used too. There might be ways to work around the piercings but like I said, I'd be afraid of irritating the piercing.     Another option is finding a trumpet player to join you.    Either way, good luck!"
trumpet,3b2i8b,PlymouthDuster,2,Thu Jun 25 13:44:27 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to say, but it probably just won't work out.  Trumpet is not friendly to beginners an it would likely take you so long to get a decent sound that it would be pretty unusable in any relatively decent amount of time.  You'd have to have a private teacher to avoid bad habits and even injury.  They would likely give you a ton of grief about piercings too.  I've known people with piercings who play various things.  I don't know of any trumpeters with labrets, but I have knowing clarinet plays who just take them out to play.  So it's an issue of where they are at and if you'd need to take them out while playing, but that's really the least of your concerns for trumpet.  It would just take so much time to develop a decent sound.  It would honestly probably be distracting in a performance even if you were playing very simple stuff.  One of the big hurdles is the amount of upkeep it takes and the amount of pure maintenance practice you'd need to put in.  Imagine playing bass after a month or two off with zero callouses.  It would hurt, you'd sound bad, and you probably wouldn't have the endurance to make the night.  Trumpet it gonna be like that but worse.  It's very unfriendly to you if you just take a few days off.  Definitely gonna go with what /u/PlymouhtDuster said.  Saxophone is a much easier casual instrument if you really want to add a horn, though obviously trumpet might be more suited to your group's sound.    I do a lot of performing with loops, so I totally get where you're coming from.  Maybe you can find something to do with simple keys.  I see a lot of bassists doing this."

My personal favorites are:  Clarke 1 & 2, up an octave from the ink.  The Maggio Exercises  Octave Slurs  Chromatic scale as far as possible  Normal scales over 2 octaves  When you play high stuff, your face will develop muscle memory and it gets easier to play. Even if your tone is absolute shit up there, the more muscle memory you develop, the easier it gets to not focus on your lips and focus on an open throat and airflow etc."
trumpet,3b08r9,SirBrass,3,Wed Jun 24 23:05:40 2015 UTC,"Try cleaning your horn. As weird as it sounds, after several months of not cleaning it, I did it and went from a shaky Eb to a solid E right away, and my friend went from an Eb to a G. Granted, we were able to hit these notes awhile ago and lost them over time so it may be different for you depending on your situation. There are a number of exercises (i prefer Claude Gordon's) that you can find to help train you as well, but I definitely recommend a good cleaning."

trumpet,3az6n8,Checked_Out,2,Wed Jun 24 22:16:45 2015 UTC,"I actually have a really funny story about a situation just like this, you might find it useful.  So, fresh out my first jury during my senior year, I decided it would be a great idea to get my wisdom teeth out. Okay, thinks me, I'll have two weeks before any rehearsals.  So I go in, it happens, and I spend a week off before I try to pick up my horn. No complications or anything, but I heal slowly.  But this same thing that happened to you happened to me-- anything in the upper register made the sockets where the surgery happened hurt.  Okay, so that's just the wounds that haven't finished healing, right? Catch: it didn't go away! I had the surgery in December, and still had pain in February. I was getting pissed off.  Weird coincidence: I went, at my mother's behest, to a chiropractor. I don't really believe in them, but my back WAS hurting and my neck was out of whack.  So I went, and when I was discussing all my various ailments, this trumpet-related pain came up. So the chiropractor asked me to tell him exactly where the pain was, and then brought in this enormous-- absolutely enormous-- book of face and neck skeletal /muscle structures.   Points out a couple of nerves. One goes from the very top vertebrae and wraps right under the cheekbone... Surprisingly close to both of the top molars.  The next nerve comes out in a similar place but extends all the way along the jaw before branching out in the bocal area.   So he essentially put arnica on my scalp and neck, gave me an alignment, and then beat the hell out of the muscles along my temple and neck. I go out thinking 'wow, I feel like playdoh'.  Picked up my horn when I got home, no pain, no sluggish lips. The muscles could, idk, /engage/. They had grip.  TL;DR consider muscle inflammation from the surgery, it could last more than just two week"

Now lift and lower the middle of your tongue, to touch the roof of your mouth, all while keeping the tip in place. That way, the tongue goes ""up"" but that doesn't involve the teeth or the tip of the tongue.

What I do is:    Play 2 octave scales starting with E4maj/min/chromatic and then F, F#, G, G#, etc until my tone thins out.     Let's say I cop out on A6, I will then rest for 1-2 minutes.    Then I will do 1 or 2 short, in-the-staff, soft lyrical studies to remind my lips to be musical and to maximize air column vibration    I will then rest again for ~2 minutes even though it doesn't feel like I need to.    Next Arpeggios, but I like to add a half step after each interval, so it would look like D4-Eb-F#-G-A-Bb-D5-Eb-F#-G-A-Bb-D6-Eb. The half step increase at the top seems to be the most beneficial to me, because it breaks a mental barrier. I would then start over at Eb4 and run the gamut till I finished the G# arpeggio which would leave me on A6, which I hold and try and get a good tone on it, but only the one time.    Then rest again for about 5 minutes (notice every rest is getting longer)    In-the-staff longtones at mp/mf    Octaves with a half step D4-Eb-D5-Eb-D6-Eb until I got up to the A6, which I would again try and refine the sound for as long as possible    Rest 5-7 minutes    Work on a few passages of whatever I'm trying to learn    Rest ~10 minutes    Major scales starting on C5 and ending every scale on my target note, in this case, A6.

Often, the valves will stick unless lapped aftermarket, slides are completely misaligned, and a bunch of things aren't actually soldered on at all. Gapping in tubing is usually a nightmare when it comes to finished product, and half the time, any mouthpiece will wobble badly in the receiver.  If you buy one of these, I hate you.  You can get a lightly used Yamaha or Getzen student-line trumpet for around this price.  Either of those brands are very reputable when it comes to consistency in their work, and exhibit a notion of caring whether the instrument will work once it reaches your hands.  Other people will also recommend: Bach, Besson, Conn, King, etc.  Bach student-line trumpets are common to find, Besson and Conn a little more scarce, and examples of remaining King student-like trumpets are disappearing in recent years.

Foam tends to distort things.  But these just tend to reduce everything without distortion so you can listen accurately for balance and pitch.  I can still hear people talk between sets without removing them so that's great as well.  That said, I wear them mostly for on gigs where I'm playing keys.  I don't know that you can ever get fully away from the weird ""inside your head"" sound that happens wearing plugs.  When I do have to wear them for loud gigs on my horn I've just learned to sort of get used to it.  In-ear monitors are also a potential option and would help you hear yourself outside of your head more, but that's a whole other level of expensive and pain-in-the-ass from a sound perspective.

trumpet,3amrzw,majorkev,3,Sun Jun 21 23:25:29 2015 UTC,I played on a 1C for a while but it was way too narrow and shallow. So I switched to the new Bach ∞ mouthpiece. There are tiny worm holes inside the cup making the width and depth of the cup indefinitely big allowing the max amount of lip in the cup. The backbone is also sealed shut for maximum efficiency. All the top players in the world are using it!
trumpet,3amrzw,kyasprin,2,Mon Jun 22 14:31:04 2015 UTC,I like you.
trumpet,3amrzw,majorkev,3,Mon Jun 22 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Stick to the 7C for a while. You want to focus on building endurance, range, and other good habits rather than experiment with different bore mouthpieces. I'm nearing a decade of playing the trumpet and I still use my 7C that I started playing with pretty often as I feel that in most cases the sound you create is determined by you not your mouthpiece type."
trumpet,3amrzw,Captain_Fordo,3,Sun Jun 21 22:48:46 2015 UTC,"7C is common because  1) People generally start when they are younger (thus having smaller lips and needing a smaller cup)  2) The smaller cup allows the embouchure to form a more focused buzz before allocating yourself to a bigger mouthpiece, which offers a better tone (generally).  If are comfortable in producing a sound on the 7C, perhaps jump to a 1 1/2 C, or even a 1C. We are jumping to the other end of the size spectrum because this way we will know if 1 or 1 1/2C is too big, and then you may potentially move back up the spectrum to see what works, rather then immediately going to the 3C without never knowing if you should actually be on a 1 1/2C.   Make sense?"
trumpet,3amrzw,hbomb101,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:03:19 2015 UTC,"Whatever is most comfortable and gives you the sound that you like! You mention that the 7C is a mouthpiece that sometimes feels too small. Before changing your mouthpiece, consider doing more flexibility exercises -- What you are feeling in ""small"" might be your lips playing ""tightly"".   As far as beginning books, the Arban's Book, Concone, Getchell 1 and 2, Herbert Clarke's Technique book, and the Goldman book are a few of my favorites to work with.  Good luck, enjoy the trumpet! If you ever need help I am always around."
trumpet,3amrzw,zdsmith,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:52:37 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, your mouthpiece selection is fine.  If you're not achieving what you feel to be optimal results out of your gear, the best thing to to would be getting with somebody who can physically be in the same room as you, and assist you with a versed opinion about how something is working.  Don't let people bully/guilt you into anything - either online, or in person.  A lot of people are very pushy with their opinions, and offer nothing to support them.  That said, if you're looking for an inexpensive, progressive book (or books) to work with, I'd recommend the Walter Beeler Method for Cornet books 1 and 2.  They're both about 8 dollars each.  If you look through them, and feel like you'd just be spinning your wheels, send me a PM, and I'll give you a detailed list of books totaling about 65 dollars that'll satisfy a very broad range of skills."
trumpet,3amrzw,Felt_Ninja,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:32:28 2015 UTC,"For me, after trying out several other mouthpieces I settled on 3C.  I found I can hit the note better with 3C.  You really need to try and see which one you like."

trumpet,3amrzw,nuvistor,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:48:41 2015 UTC,"Lots of good advice. Botton line, master the 7c for endurance and range. As you progress ask youself what do you want your trumpet to sound like? Do you want a bright piercing sound or a full bright timbre in all ranges? Playing a lead or a section part? Maynard Ferguson or Art Farmer? The reason I say this is because other than rim size, there is cup depth and bore you need to consider. Shallow cups with small bores are best in high registers but give the trumpet a ""blatty"" sound in the mid and low range. Deeper cups and wider bores give a full rich sound but harder to sustain very high note passages. In any case, master what you have and decide where you want to slot your trumpet playing in. The 7C is the middle of the pack and will do great."
trumpet,3amrzw,Slidetbone,11,Thu Jun 25 14:26:02 2015 UTC,"Seriously... this crap?  The idea that you graduate to bigger mouthpieces is so much BS.  And you decided to sprinkle some sexism into it also.  You use the right tool for the right job.  You don't just go bigger because you're more manly and more developed and play the trumpet player pissing contest of who has the biggest bucket of a mouthpiece.  Different people have different physical builds and play different styles and use different mouthpieces to get different sounds for different styles.  The idea that 7C is the ""beginner"" mouthpiece and that everyone needs to slowly graduate up to 5C/B then 3C then 1.5C just seems so prevalent, particularly among band directors and I wish it would die.  Too many students try changing mouthpieces too often or try moving up to mouthpieces too big for the amount of playing they do because of this misunderstanding.  For what it's worth, the same thing happens with reed strength.  The amount of students my wife gets playing on reeds they shouldn't be due to the pissing contest of harder reeds is frustrating.  And it's because band directors thing harder means better and too many kids grow up and go to college and never learn better and try playing on 4.5s all the damned time when they can't.  I think the ultimate reason for both of these is that band directors wants louder players... not better ones."

trumpet,3amrzw,Keplaffintech,5,Sun Jun 21 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"It's never, ""I bet I can double tongue octaves better than you!"""
trumpet,3amrzw,Felt_Ninja,3,Sun Jun 21 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"I think there are some issues with proportionality and balance of the typical 7C design, but I feel like your assessments are brash and incorrect.  Since you mentioned you were a TA, I'm going to judge this based on experience as a professional musician.   7c is too small for anyone over the age of 12.   ...and...   Only the most petite females in the class were able to use a 7c with any success.   If you're actually looking to teach, this will lose you a job for two reasons.  First, you're insulting people in general while instilling baseless information about a mouthpiece design to people who are impressionable of your teaching.  Remember, most of the people in brass methods classes don't play a brass instrument, which you've mentioned already that you recognize.  This means you're passing on bad information to potential future educators, who will distill it into exponentially worse information to their students.  I get to hear the mutated versions of horrible band director advice every week in my students' lessons, and I don't feel at all remorseful for mentioning that this is a poor method of teaching, and I shun you for it.  Secondly - and this is adding insult to injury for the select group - you're specifically insulting women, given the first remark.  While your experience that females with a smaller facial structure being the only ones who can reap the benefits of the 7C design, most people know somebody who doesn't fit this demographic, yet still achieves incredibly palatable results from it.  I urge you to reassess your statements, and do extensive research about this topic, before offering indefensible and harmful generalizations like this.   I would move up to a 5c so you can still have plenty of support for your developing lip musculature yet have increased size to handle your adult sized body. If that still feels stuffy or just too small, then consider the 3c.   This illustrates a couple issues as well.  The 5C is larger than the 7C in diameter to a negligible degree.  The cup isn't all that different of a shape in most version of it, either.  In fact, the biggest improvement people tend to see in the 5C over the 7C, is the fact that the rim isn't as thin and unsupportive.  The profile of a 5C rim allows for slightly more cushioning, and doesn't feel like a ""cookie cutter"" as much as a 7C will to somebody who's unconcerned about how hard they're pressing an instrument into their face.  The other issue here, is that you're giving people half of the relevant information.  Not every mouthpiece has a ""C"" cup built into the design, and very often, people have success wither either larger of smaller cup volume.  I have many students who have found more clarity in their playing on ""D"" cups, while a good number have also been able to better produce a robust sound on a ""B"" cup.  The issue with Bach's cup designation letters, however, is that it's not consistent.  The 7C has a large bowl-shaped cup, while the 3C has a significantly shallower, almost semi-V shaped cup.  The number only refers to the diameter, which is helpful, but understanding the nature of the rest of the sizing designation is going to answer a lot of questions for people as well.    I realize you were the TA, but material were you given to teach from?  Were you tasked with creating your own syllabus?  If it was the latter, there needs to be more research done on your part as to the actual design of equipment, and also how to deliver information to students without falsely sounding like somebody of knowledge and repute.  Again, your delivery is shameful not just for a TA of a college course, but for a high school section leader in a marching band."

What kind of horn do you play? I find different horns work better with different mouthpieces. My Yamaha Chicago works fantastically with a 15C4 (~2c), yet my Adams A4 works better with one of Trent Austin's heavy weight 1.25C's. The biggest thing is to become comfortable with the piece you pick and stick with it.

trumpet,3agvcl,Paultheidiot,11,Sat Jun 20 01:41:11 2015 UTC,"Think basic.You get better at something by doing it. Start by playing your longtones louder than normal with a tuner or tuning drone to make sure you are not driving your pitch sharp. Then do your longtones as giant crescendos and decrescendos getting as loud as you possibly can or starting as loud as you possibly can. Again, with a tuner to check yourself. It's all about learning to feel comfortable at the extremes.  I like to play Bordogni or Chaccone etudes at fff to see if I can maintain volume through phrases as well as control. It can be done with anything. Those are just my favorites to work on. I like keeping it simple.  Breathing exercises like The Breathing Gym also help to make sure you are giving proper support to this new found power. Good luck and happy practicing!"

Do breathing exercises both with and without the horn, also with and without the mouthpiece in the horn.

Crescendos and decrescendos on long tones will help. But make sure you're just pushing to the edge of a good sound, don't let yourself cross that threshold into a bad sound.  By the way, projection is an important thing to have on or off the field. I can't tell you how many people I've gigged with that cannot for the life of them project their sound more than 10 feet in front of them.  source: I marched 4 years of drum corps."

trumpet,3agvcl,hawcru,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"To learn to play loud, learn to play soft. Same as high notes. Learn low to play high.  Learn to play really soft with a great tone, and never losing your sound. Then, just add air. Learning how to play soft will help you keep your embouchure focused which is imperative as you add more air. A sound that spreads is actually softer (on a decibel rating) than a sound that is focused. (Not to mention the focused sound will be carried better and heard more fully farther away)  Playing loud is something you shouldn't actively try to do. Instead, focus your thinking on allowing as much air to flow through your lungs into the horn. The key is how you think about it. Take a relaxed and full breath (hard to do while marching I know. I learned in corps) and then allow that air to flow unrestricted from your lungs into the instrument."

The guy above me was a 5th year senior.  I was a decent'to-good player, but our band program was still 70 people on a good week.  We had people:   Quit all the time (whether they did it officially, or just stopped showing up) Get suspended/expelled Switch to color guard when they realized they could do less work Go into labor right before we had to go to a competition (yes, this actually happened), and have to leave to go have a baby Randomly appear out of nowhere, transferring from different schools, or just deciding they want to be in band again   When I switched schools my sophomore year, there was a bigger band program (about 150).  I was 3rd or 4th chair in the wind ensemble.  That was still far from the biggest band program in the district.  Had I gone to the largest school (which had a band of about 450), I may have been in a lower band entirely.  Larger schools have  the advantage of having a larger pool of students to draw from increasing the odds of at least some people being pretty decently skilled and/or motivated.  Small schools are definitely at a disadvantage, unless they're audition-based programs (as in, not automatic acceptance).  Small schools aren't all bad, though.

trumpet,3afrj9,TheKoalaSlayer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:39:14 2015 UTC,I've been playing on pardubas since I started playing. What I love about them is how versatile they are. I use it for all the playing I do. They work for lead jazz work. They work for classical and even for mariachi which is what I mainly play. I'd say if you are curious go ahead and get it. I've tried to go back to single cups and I just can't can't get the same type of comfort that I do from pardubas.

trumpet,3acbsk,alaskanaut,6,Sat Jun 20 02:24:19 2015 UTC,"I can! Additionally, my private teacher always talks about the correlation between whistling higher and hitting higher notes when she talks about air speed and tongue placement."
trumpet,3acbsk,ThingsInInk,2,Fri Jun 19 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"It's some of the best advice I've ever received from a trumpet instructor. I believe there's a secondary standing wave in the mouth, just the same as when you whistle or freebuzz, which along with the wave in the instrument tubing informs the vibration of the lips as much or more than they do each resonant cavity."
trumpet,3acbsk,AeoSC,4,Fri Jun 19 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm definitely above average in whistling, range and tone wise. I can also do a vibrato, I think all these signifies tongue control more than embouchure control. Then again, tongue control is very important in brass playing."
trumpet,3acbsk,cyhlalala,3,Fri Jun 19 01:09:16 2015 UTC,I think there is and it has to do more with the tongue shifting to change pitch.

trumpet,3acbsk,WolfDemon,2,Fri Jun 19 01:44:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I believe there is a correlation. Not through the embouchure--causing a pressure wave via buzzing or by pursing your lips to whistle is a completely different mechanism. I believe the connection is in the movement of the tongue to change the frequency of the standing wave.  Whether you're freebuzzing or whistling, the inside of your mouth is the resonant cavity, and I believe the interference with the wave in the air column of the brass instrument is a major part of the way the instrument works, in the same way that the wave in the instrument modifies the vibration of the lips once it's formed--locking into the familiar series of partials."

Now, I can't whistle to save my life (getting better, though!), but I can still get a pitch (though it's not quite the right tone). Turns out, the tongue placement needed to get pitches on the horn correspond pretty well with the placement needed to whistle those notes. Super handy, and helped me tons since I used to have a more closed tone due to having the tongue too low."

trumpet,3a5ubk,metalbeak12,5,Wed Jun 17 13:41:50 2015 UTC,"Some more practice tips that could be added:  Half tempo is your best friend. I also like to swing any of my more technical passages in the classical stuff (Ravel Piano Concerto excerpt, anybody?).  It's okay to practice a piece at one tempo and just slow down for a bar or two that you're having difficulty with. More ""correct"" reps (note, articulation, etc wise) at any tempo are more beneficial and efficient than brute forcing through it.  For lyrical passages, playing a one note version helps a lot for me. Slurring is good practice for some passages, as long as they're precise slurs.  5 Minutes a day on basics can give you very quick improvement- I usually do an hour or so every day of them. Don't neglect the basics and getting down and dirty with the precise details of articulation, note placement, lip slurs, tongue positioning, multiple tonguing, airflow, fingers, etc. Nobody will ever be perfect at any of these, there's always improvement, and it will make you sound SO much better and makes the music easier when you work on these consistently.  Don't always start from the beginning of a piece or section. Start from the middle, the end and work your way back, etc.  Scales and arpeggios will make sightreading 1000x easier.  Don't ever compromise tone and airflow when you practice.   Take breaks, rest for as long as you play.   That's about all I got for now, but those are what's helped me more than anything."

I managed to find a really nice air-less tone when I wasn't focused on the embouchure or air at all, rather I was working on tongue placement to get my articulation sounding and working right, and of course once I got my tongue in the right place, my embouchure knew what to do better than I did!"

The key with the long tones: imagine the sound you want in your head, RELAX, and focus on matching it. Don't ""try"" too hard to match it, just notice the way you sound while you're playing–your body is a wonderful thing and will slowly do what is necessary to get closer to your ideal sound. Also, rest as much as you play when you're doing this, and don't play past your comfortable range. This routine (paired with some breathing exercises) completely transformed the way I played trumpet....back when I played trumpet seriously, anyway.  edit This too, is another magical tool for getting your actual sound closer to the sound you desire: http://www.gregwingtrumpet.com/uploads/2/1/4/0/21407028/chicowitz_flow_studies_expanded_and_modified_by_wing_july_2013.pdf"
trumpet,3a3vb8,Zabrak95,2,Thu Jun 18 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me on this but people I've played with that do this usually use more lip than air, try using faster air instead of more air."
trumpet,3a3vb8,Zabrak95,0,Wed Jun 17 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"It's Kinda difficult to explain but I'll try my best. Air speed determines pitch, which is why your having the problem. The volume of air determines dynamic. So what is happening is that in order to hit higher notes your air needs to be going a certain speed with enough consistent air behind it, because you have the airy sound it just needs to go faster. The best idea I can give to fix this is when you play, make the ""E"" syllable in your mouth while you play, don't ask me why because I have no idea why it works, it just does. If you just trying blowing air out of your mouth with that syllable you will notice an increase in speed as the pitch the air makes will literally rise. Now that you know how it feels to increase air speed try it without that syllable, or don't, I use the technique a lot. Also the more air you push the faster it's gonna come out because your mouth is only so big, this is also why trumpets can be do loud the higher they go, they push more air so it's faster, it also has the great side effect of being louder."
trumpet,3a3vb8,AloneIntheCorner,2,Wed Jun 17 12:29:26 2015 UTC,"don't ask me why because I have no idea why it works, it just does.   What that does is raise your tongue in your mouth, making a narrower space. The narrower space makes fast air a LOT easier."
trumpet,3a3vb8,ortrigger,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:10:12 2015 UTC,"I've never played the low brass but I've played french horn. Trumpet definitely takes a firmer embouchure and more air pressure. Try tightening up your embouchure just a bit and, as /u/Zabrak95 said, use faster air rather than more air. You will find that the trumpet will respond much better to how you control your air rather than how much air you push through it."

We had one gal come in a few years after I started, but I think it was cause her older brother was section leader and pressured her.

I don't see anything terribly amiss about this horn that would require extensive repairs.  Things like this come into my shop all the time.

Play on at least 5, narrow it down to your favorite. Then ask the store to try a few more that are similar to that one. Bring along a teacher or someone who knows enough to comment on your tone. Write a sentence describing what kind of tone you're going for - are you willing to sacrifice depth for sizzle? I use one of 2 slightly different mouthpieces depending on the kind of music. Test with arpeggios and swells, make sure it's consistent across your range and that you can play dynamics. It can be tempting to get a shallow piece that makes your upper registers brilliant but crushes your sound - avoid that.  Repeat this exercise every year at first - As you develop you may sound better on mouthpieces you couldn't play before. Eventually you'll go shopping and end up keeping your original mouthpiece."

Whenever someone tells me they find transposing too hard, I don't buy it.  I have 1st and 2nd year students transposing parts for D and F trumpet, and being able to read it one the first or second try.  C trumpet is the least of anyone's concerns, really.  That should be easy enough to reasonably sightread, pretty much no matter of how far along into development someone is.  So seriously, you can do this.

trumpet,39o4op,balducien,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:13:31 2015 UTC,"Even it it's just 3-5 initial lessons, that's infinitely better and faster than picking it up by yourself. It's really easy to get into a bad habit at the beginning and it takes serious dedication to get rid of those. It's best to avoid a good amount of them by taking some lessons.   Flute/piano/guitar are no comparison since you don't need your lips to be trained. You'll get them to produce a good sound right at the start. I haven't played the sax so I can't speak about that, but from what I've heard it's way faster to get a sax to sound nicely than a trumpet (which can take years even with regular practice).  That being said, feel free to just try it for a few weeks using a cheap (used/plastic) trumpet, and if you get into it as fast as you think that's a definite win!"

Also, it is possible to progress with a limited number of lessons, in the first year of my music degree my tutor probably showed up about 7 times throughout the entire academic year. I was supposed to have weekly lessons! I passed the year with average marks, however, in the subsequent years with regular tuition my marks jumped up considerably.

It's like exercising, you have to do it consistently to see any results. If you take long breaks, your facial muscles are no longer in shape. If you can practice at least 30-60 min a day and get a teacher, you'll be fine. Trying to learn on your own and you can develop bad habits, run into roadblocks and get frustrated. Even pros have bad days, 'cept they'll sound much better on a bad day than a beginner will. But it's just how brass instruments work. I mean, it's not rocket science or anything, but they're more physically demanding. My teacher says trumpet can be an evil bitch sometimes, and yeah it really can be. It's a very fun, rewarding instrument but frustrating too. What kind of sax do you play? Maybe pick up another kind of sax...I think baritone sax sounds awesome."

trumpet,39o4op,maestro2005,0,Tue Jun 16 21:45:51 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest not doing it.  Brass instruments do not lend themselves to casual hobbyist playing.  They require you to maintain a certain amount of fitness with the muscles of your face used to play, much more so than other winds.  If you just pick it up here and there it will sound like shit every single time and you'll get frustrated that you sound like shit and now you will have wasted a great deal of money because even a decent low end horn will be costly.  If you're worried about wasting money on lessons, you should worry more about having wasted so much money on a horn that you will almost certain regret having bought.  Pick another instrument.  I recommend saxophone for those insistent on wind and guitar above all for hobbyist playing (with keyboards a little trailing).  Since you already dabble in those, I'd say stick to that.  Not trying to be a dick.  It's just a reality of the instrument."

trumpet,39m9ap,HobbitJesus,4,Fri Jun 12 18:57:14 2015 UTC,"There are a few things this could be.  First of all: your instrument. All brass instruments have more quirks the higher you go up the overtone series and adjustments must be made via the lips of valves or alternate fingerings to account for the tendencies of your horn. The overtone series naturally gets out of tune the higher you go, some instruments especially student models or cheaper or older instruments have a worse problem with this then some newer higher end instruments. What kind of horn do you have? Because thats not very high up in the range for it to have ridiculously bad intonation.  Secondly, the problem could be you. Brass instruments really don't do much as far as making the notes happen, your lips, your ears, and your mouthpiece are the biggest things that drive brass instruments. Have you ever noticed how professional brass players dont fuss with their tuning slide all the time? Thats because they play what they hear and make sure their lips compensate for any idiosyncrasies of the instrument. I highly recommend practicing your trumpet music with a piano so that you can hear exactly where the pitches are.  It might be a little expensive, but getting the best teacher you can for a private lesson will reveal all the issues your having.   PM if you wanna video chat and show me the problems your having. Would be willing to help you out for free. Trumpet love!  Source: Professional SF Bay Area Jazz/Latin/Commercial Trombonist, composer, arranger, and teacher"

I have a Yamaha trumpet with a shepards crook, I could get the exact model later. I'm pretty sure of the problem being me as I have friends with the exact same horn (without the shepards crook) and they're on pitch. I've been told I'm squeezing. But the director has not told me exactly how to get the pitch down, just to get the pitch down. He taught me to play trumpet and I've been playing for around 2 years now. I don't know what to do to get these pitches down."
trumpet,39m9ap,ortrigger,2,Fri Jun 12 19:40:31 2015 UTC,"I've been told I'm squeezing   That could very well be the main problem. Do you feel like you're having to force the note? If so, take some practice time and work on going up and down the chromatic scale as effortlessly as possible. Be sure to concentrate on your breathing and using your diaphragm to support the note rather than tensing up your chest."
trumpet,39m9ap,ortrigger,2,Fri Jun 12 21:34:17 2015 UTC,Yeah it does feel pressured and difficult to play high. I'll try the chromatics
trumpet,39m9ap,Malachite6,2,Sat Jun 13 01:39:48 2015 UTC,it does feel pressured and difficult to play high   Definitely work on relaxing while you're playing then. You may benefit from deep breathing exercises as well.
trumpet,39m9ap,aviddd,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:06:24 2015 UTC,How do I relax while playing? I've been told that but where do I relax? I try to relax in my torso area but I can't help but get a little pinched in my diaphragm area to produce the note. To get good tone I have to squeeze which goes insanely sharp. So in short how do I relax exactly?
trumpet,39m9ap,yalokinh,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:16:56 2015 UTC,"When you are on a note, try pushing the pitch down but not going to a lower harmonic. Bend it - up to nearly a semitone. Start doing this for lower notes, then work up to doing it on higher ones."
trumpet,39m9ap,aviddd,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:03:03 2015 UTC,"relax your lips. support them with muscles on the side. Don't jam the mouthpiece into them, apply just enough pressure to make a seal. Keep your abdomen slightly engaged, take big full breaths."
trumpet,39lpzf,JaSaw0,3,Fri Jun 12 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"Look up the serial number. Theres a few websites that have information on some of these Legacy king horns. This is definitely an old trumpet, from my research on my King Liberty trombone, King Liberty could be Pre-WWII, however I'm not 100% certain. What gives it away as being that old is the octaganal valve caps, also a smaller bell flair, as well as the ornate bracing. They dont usually have these sorts of flourishes on newer models. This guy looks like he's in pretty rough condition, but even though these pre-WWII horns aren't worth a lot monetarily, if you have one with decent intonation that has been reasonably taken care of, its totally worth overhauling. Good Pre-WWII horns are coveted among brass players for their warm brilliant tones, beautiful workmanship, and excellent metallurgy. This is a very cool horn with potentially a lot of history. I'm just imagining this thing replated with all silver and gold accents, kinda like this... oh man that would be awesome...  http://www.harrelsontrumpets.com/product_p/bach37.htm  take it to the best repair person you know, and they likely can tell you more about it then I can."

Like I said I would like to try and restore it but I want to make sure it is going to be worth the money.

trumpet,39lpzf,ortrigger,2,Fri Jun 12 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that is the exact same model as my band teach had when I was in high school. His was in some type of silver finish, but that's beside the point. I got to play it a few times and it was one of the best sounding trumpets that I have ever had the pleasure of playing.  I'm not sure it would be worth a lot of money whether you restore it or not. However, it is an excellent horn and I even managed to find a bit of info about it. It looks to be a 'No. 2 Liberty Model' and manufacture started between 1931 and 1932. Source  EDIT: If the serial number is an accurate representation, your trumpet was made between 1939 and 1940.

Pay more attention to the physical aspects of your trumpet playing.  Check this guy out Claude Gordon. He helped me get out of a slump/plateau years ago that sounds a lot like yours.   Good luck.
trumpet,39e0nc,pedrohongbao,3,Thu Jun 11 03:51:01 2015 UTC,"The ""Buzzing the Leadpipe"" and ""Long Tones"" parts changed my life when I was 16: https://emedia.leeward.hawaii.edu/minasian/Adam1.pdf  The whole routine is a great thing to incorporate in daily practice, you can get the rest of it here: https://emedia.leeward.hawaii.edu/minasian/adam.html  The 3C will definitely do the trick. Don't mess around with mouthpiece changes unless you have a very good reason, or if you need something to make playing lead a little easier. And, by far the most important thing is to listen to trumpet players whose sound you want to emulate, and always keep that in your head while doing the long tones (and all playing in general). Maurice Andre's sound is always in the back of my mind when I pick up my horn."

Just any old thing, just sheer time-on-mouthpiece without stringent demands.   Been working on lip slurs, bugle calls, stuff like that. And paying more attention to what's physically going on.   Long tones!   Your trumpet is probably the ""best trumpet"" in the hands of Sergei Nakariakov, Tine Thing Helseth, etc. Soooo much of this game is the player."
trumpet,39e0nc,nuvistor,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:32:30 2015 UTC,"David Hickman has an exercise he showed me where you play a long-tone and quickly lower your dynamics to JUST before the point of failure, as in, your tone should be skipping in and out while you try to keep the tone going without increasing your dynamic level at all.  His philosophy behind this is that there's a lot of air that escapes through our embouchure without aiding tone. If you can minimize this in the most difficult scenario, ultra-low dynamics, it will passively increase your tone at more forceful dynamic levels.  It's an easy exercise to do if you let yourself cheat. It's hard as hell if you actually concentrate and try and play at the failure level."
trumpet,39ctyc,punkrawkspence,6,Wed Jun 10 22:17:27 2015 UTC,"First off....breathe. It is going to be ok! I promise. This won't ruin your dreams. If you have plans on going to a good state school for music you will get in to the program even if you bomb the audition, and usually they let you re audition for scholarships yearly, and sometimes every semester.   As for the band camp issue, bring your mouthpiece with you on your trail trips. Get a tuner and practice long tones and scales on your mouthpiece and keep them in tune. Close your eyes and play the note again, after a few seconds, look to see if you kept it in tune. Try and get as pretty a tone from your mouthpiece as possible. You will be amazed how much this helps, your intonation will be out of this world compared to most of the players your age, and your tone quality will get better as well.   Those two things are what is going to set you apart in college at first. No one expects you to be a virtuoso at first, but if you come in with a good ear, and great tone your professors can build you into a heck of a musician."

Buzz pieces, buzz high-up stuff, buzz low, you get the idea."
trumpet,39bn02,UnitedBamboo,11,Wed Jun 10 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"I remember when I got my braces off. I pretty much had to start all over again, and you probably will too. Don't worry, it won't take as long as you think it will. Just go back to doing the basics of the basics: long tones, long tones, and more long tones. Start down low, hold one note for as long as you can with as good of a sound as you can make, then take a breath and go up chromatically. Don't go any higher than you feel comfortable. Once you get as high as you can, rest a few minutes and do the whole thing again.   Just be patient and keep at it every day. You'll get it back soon."
trumpet,39bn02,phen0men0n,2,Wed Jun 10 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like this gives a somewhat different idea of exactly how important long tones are in practice. The only exception (and the only time I've used them) is when recovering from an embouchure change or braces.   In the beginning of recovery, the Caruso methodology is sustained, horn-on-the-face chromatic long tones. However, that was far from the only thing Caruso did. He worked with all kinds of musicians, not just trumpet players, and pulled many people from the brink of quitting. These long tones, in my opinion, are literally to force the musicians back to the very fundamentals of their instrument-- one note.  If you look at any of the things Caruso did AFTER that long tone exercise, it's just lip flexibility and muscle control/airflow control. Schlossberg, Clarke technical studies.  For me, the problem is that people abstract the one very beginning part of Caruso's strategy, and then neglect the rest!"
trumpet,39bn02,Checked_Out,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:13:46 2015 UTC,Thanks! Do you have any recommendation how long each of my practices should be?
trumpet,39bn02,CSNX,3,Wed Jun 10 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"Don't practice longer than your face will let you. If your face is hurting, take a break and come back in half an hour or something. I would guess 20- 30 minute sessions would be generous at this point in your ""recovery"".  Learn to know your body and when it's fatigued."
trumpet,39bn02,ortrigger,3,Fri Jun 12 17:04:20 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I still have scars on the inside of my lips from my time with braces. It won't take long for you to be playing at your normal skill level but you need to be patient and diligent in your practice.  It's already been said but start your practice with chromatic long tones. I would also recommend some scale and arpeggio exercises as well. Start on the first exercise of whichever method book you use and start going forward from there. It will help you re-develop your flexibility and expand your range back to where it was before you got your braces off.
trumpet,39bn02,soccer10chivas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:29:24 2015 UTC,"I've been about 7 years removed from having my braces off, and I think I still have a few scars from when I did have braces."
trumpet,39bn02,CSNX,2,Wed Jun 24 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"It will take much more time than a week, unfortunately. I got my braces off right after graduation and then had three months before college level band camp.   Three months wasn't enough to get back where I was, but I was able to place well in the band camp auditions. By second semester I was doing a lot better, but it wasn't until my second year that was really back to where I was.  Be patient, do yourself a favor and really focus on doing long tones correctly and you will improve your sound a lot. Don't try to force your range, or you'll just set yourself back and/or make new bad habits. If you don't have a private teacher, I'd suggest finding one to help you over the summer or longer.  Patience and dedication are all I can really say. Real, methodical practice, go back to fundamentals, don't worry about much else until you feel comfortable again."
trumpet,39bn02,CSNX,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:02:16 2015 UTC,Did you get an airy sound when you started to practice again? I tried changing my embouchure but I'm still getting that sound.
trumpet,39bn02,sparksparkboom,2,Fri Jun 12 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really remember to be honest, but probably. Do you have a teacher? It'd be great for you to get an in person assessment on how your embouchure is formed. I feel like you should avoid changing your embouchure too much, since it's already undergone a huge change, but at the same time it's a good time since you've already undergone that huge change.   Do you have a smart phone or something, that you can record your face while you play? If you can see yourself and what your face is doing that might also help you. Playing by a mirror might also work.  If you can though, I'd try to get at least one lesson with a private teacher, this time of rebuilding is crucial to getting the right habits made."

I've heard that's especially true from late '60s and on, but the early 60s Fullertons have a better track record.  I'm just repeating what I've heard.  I also have a '61 Fullerton Ambassador, and I think it's great.  I've played 3 other Fullerton Ambassadors, and while I don't know when they were made, mine is definitely nicer."

trumpet,394vfe,cold_dust,18,Tue Jun 9 07:25:03 2015 UTC,"Get lessons, or probably just sell the horn.  The reality is, if you don't already have at least some background in music, it's going to be a ridiculous uphill climb.  A lot of people here want to be very positive and say anyone can do it, and they aren't wrong, but they also aren't being very realistic.  There is a sliver of potential to do it, but there's a lot to keep in mind.  Most instrumentalists who give that sort of advice started young.  They learned so many things slowly and casually that as adults they don't truly appreciate how much of those skills they now take for granted.  Learning how to read music by going to band every day and having a tiny amount of gradual steps put in front of them with a teacher reinforcing concepts for 30 minutes to a hour every single day.  Tuning, tone, and blending concepts picked up gradually over a period of years playing with an ensemble.  The list seriously goes on.   This is a frequent problem in advice given by semi-accomplished adults who started young.  You hear the same from pianists.  ""How should I learn to sightread"" ""Oh... just sit down with some Chopin etudes or Bach two part inventions.""  People who have never taught actively, taught beginners, taught adult beginners, or picked up a secondary instrument later in life just lose the perspective on just how many things they take for granted about their own playing and assume someone else can just jump into.  To make matter worse, you pretty much picked up one of the most demanding instruments for this.  My go-to analogy is that playing trumpet is like training for a marathon, but worse.  It doesn't matter how much you learn about running, if you decide to take 2 weeks off training before the marathon, you won't be in the shape you need to run.  Trumpet requires a lot of just pure maintenance practice.  This is where it really falls apart for casual adult beginners.  If you're not good, and you won't be at the start, it's easy to be frustrated with your lack of progress and inability to do the things you want like just sitting down and jamming with some group.  One day things are just too busy in your adult life and you take a day off of practice.... then another... then a week.  Now, you're out of shape and the next time you pick up your horn, you sound worse than you left off which wasn't good to start with.  Now, if you've got years of experience, you know how to get back in shape fairly quickly, but it won't be instantaneous.  Heck, if I took a month off, it might take me 1-2 weeks or more to get back in shape depending on what I'm being called on to play.  Trumpet is just not very forgiving for people with any sort of normal adult schedule.  You really will have to play diligently almost every single day to grow and maintain.  For people who are adults with busy lives and unlikely to deal with the extremely delayed gratification... it's just not likely to happen.  So my first advice would be to cut your losses... look into the sunk cost fallacy if you find that difficult, and move on.  If you're really insistent and keeping going... I'd still suggest selling the trumpet and getting a sax if you really just want to blow a horn.  Sax isn't nearly as demanding either in terms of maintenance practice or in terms of intuitive playability.  But honestly, the number of those I see for sale on eBay with a beginner practice book tells me a lot.  It's also something I see happen at local music stores a lot... adults buy them, have good intentions, realize they won't be Charlie Parker in a few months and give up.  Trumpet just won't be very friendly to you without a teacher because you of how many bad habits you can pick up and how devastating they can be to development.  Basically without someone who knows what's up watching you play regularly, you'll never be able to self-teach and self-diagnose bad habits.  Now if you just want to play something casually for fun, buy a guitar.  You can learn a handful of chords and accompany yourself singing dozens of songs.  Like jazz?  Learn your minor penatonic like every other guitar hack who likes to sit up at Guitar Center pretending to be awesome while noodling over a single position pentatonic scale on a $4000+ guitar.  You'll be able to get so much more instant gratification from that and on guitar, once you've learned a scale in one key, on a basic level you've learned it in every key.  So now you can sit on Youtube with backing tracks and play stuff that makes you feel awesome.  Another option is always a keyboard.  In a lot of ways it's more intuitive than a guitar and depending on what you get, you might have more bells and whistles to play around with casually.  Look, I'm not trying to be an ass.  I know I'm captain buzzkill, but when people ask these questions, I just give them the serious, no-BS answer based on a lot of experience rather than try to soften the blow or fill them with BS about ""You can do anything you put your mind to!!""  Well... no.  If you don't have legs, you probably won't be playing in the NBA.  Sure, there are exceptions out there who manage to pull off amazing things, but they are the exception, not the rule.    People just have a terrible habit of underestimating the difficulty of instruments (violin, flute, and trumpet being some the most punishing).  Rather than let you throw more money at the problem trying to solve it, I'm just going to tell you that it's unlikely to work out."

trumpet,394vfe,ColbertNation893,4,Tue Jun 9 14:06:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you've got a good point. I think I'll keep the trumpet for now, just in case I get into trouble and I need quick cash. Time for practice definitely worries me, since my schedule isn't very consistent.  I'll save money for lessons, and take them when  have the chance and what happens. I think I'd rather start now and have a couple of hiatuses than start 30 years from now when my impending arthritis renders my fingers useless. I might look into the guitar or keyboard,  just for shits and giggles. I feel that since people like me don't last that long, I might as well start learning new things and trying new stuff.   I have no mind with you being honest with me. In fact, I appreciate it. I'd rather have you be truthful than you lying to me and inflating my hopes with something that isn't going to happen. Obviously,  I'm not going to be the next Louis Armstrong or Miles Davis any time soon.   Thank you for all your help. Namaste."

Get a Boy Scouts bugling book and learn bugle calls, because bugle calls are cool and very few people can do 'em.   Find music that you like! Herb Alpert? Ska? Whatever it is, it's all good.   Keep the horn and play every day or once a week or when you're mad, and who knows you might wake up in 5 years and can kinda play the trumpet.   Instead of being that guy who bought a trumpet then got mad at himself and sold it and can't play the trumpet at all."
trumpet,394vfe,bluePMAknight,6,Wed Jun 10 07:02:33 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of negativity on this post. I think you can do it. There are a plethora of helpful online lessons. Look for people like John Daniels, David Hickman, and David Bilger. All three famous in their own right in our world as either terrific pedagogues, players, or both.  Listen to recordings. Since you want to play jazz listen to Bix Biderbeck, Louis Armstrong, Clifford Brown and Freddie Hubbard. (Those are my favorites anyway, but I play classical) try to mimic their sounds. This will take a long time.  You're going to have to teach yourself, which is totally doable, but adds an extra dimension of difficulty.  As motivation I'll tell you a little story.  The trumpet player for the Dave Mathews Band grew up in the Carribean, he had an old record player and a lot of albums and a trumpet. That's it. He learned to play by listening and mimicing and playing along with the recordings. He never thought he'd be a successful musician.  Then as he was working as a bellman in the states, DMB was playing a show. This guy had no idea who Dave was, he just knew he was a musician. He causally mentioned that he played the trumpet to Dave as he was carrying his bags to his room and Dave said he wanted to hear him play.  Next thing you know, this guy is touring with an international and quite legendary band.  You can do it, but it's going to take a LOT of work."

Maybe try to find someone to give you a few lessons at the beginning. Even a college student should be able to get you started with a correct embouchure, and show you some exercises to work on technique. (And they'll probably do it for cheap.)"
trumpet,394vfe,akinsgre,4,Wed Jun 10 00:29:10 2015 UTC,"If you spend the next two or three months working your ass off and practicing efficiently, you'll probably be sounding like a mediocre fifth grader.  Yeargdribble is telling you truth. The trumpet is demanding as hell. Unless you can honestly say that you're going to be spending at least an hour a day practicing, for the next few years, you're not going to get to the place where you can put the horn on your face and make some noises that resemble music. It's not a ""hobby"" instrument.  I sometimes feel like keeping my chops in good enough shape just to play 2nd and 3rd parts in a jazz band takes more work than my marriage.  All that said, you can definitely learn to play trumpet. Just realize it's going to take years of constant, scheduled, and well-directed practice. If that still sounds appealing to you, turn off your computer, find an instructor, and start putting in the time.  P.S. If you do start practicing/learning, make sure you're spending as much time resting as you are practicing. At first, and always really, you'll get fatigued while playing. If you keep playing through that feeling during practice, you'll start pulling the trumpet into your face and develop all kinds of bad habits. Bad habits and woodwind players need to be your #1 enemies as a beginner."

trumpet,394vfe,RocktimusCrime,3,Tue Jun 9 08:16:17 2015 UTC,"Hey man! Awesome stuff just going out and buying a trumpet!  Now for the hard part. The trumpet is a crazy tough instrument to master, and doing it by yourself is neigh impossible. Which brings me to my (and any musician worth their stuff's) first suggestion: bite the bullet and save up for lessons. Having someone to not only teach you about trumpet playing, but also experienced and willing to collaborate and improve your ability as a musician overall is absolutely IMPERATIVE to your development as a trumpet player and musician. Ultimately, having a quality teacher will be the biggest factor in how efficiently you become proficient.   As you wait, the absolute best thing you can do is LISTEN. Get out there (metaphorically or physically, your call) and find the players that sound how you want to sound and LISTEN. In my own limited experience if I'm conflicted at all about what something should sound like, it'll sound that way when I put it through the horn. The best thing I can compare it to is sports, kids will sit for hours and watch players like LeBron or Messi and spend years studying the way they maneuver with the hope that one day, they'll be able to do it too. I take the same approach to the trumpet, listening to the greats like Miles, Freddie, Pops, Marsalis, Clifford, and even new cats like Adam O'Farrill, Josh Shpak, and Tony Glausi, just like I see my little brother watch Steph Curry and LeBron (In fact I've been watching this the whole time I've been typing this novel).  As far as the youtube videos go, I personally think they are a double edged sword. While many offer great advise and feature experienced teachers and players, everyone is different and what might be a saving grace for one player may lead another to their downfall. Now that being said my tip would be to take specific techniques/etc. that try and teach the mechanics of playing with a grain of salt (example), while maybe searching out masterclasses on music theory/musicality that can help broaden the scope of your playing without necessarily leading to you developing bad habits or even hurting yourself (example).    TL;DR   GET A TEACHER Until you get a teacher (and for as long as you play any instrument) find a player you like, and listen to them UNTIL IT DRIVES YOU FUCKING CRAZY Be very careful with youtube... On one hand don't be afraid to learn about the trumpet and musicality, but also don't go looking for the holy-grail-secret-trick for unlimited range (I know you want to) and one more time... GET A TEACHER!!!   P.S. Also purely out of curiosity, what kind of horn did you get and can you post a pic?"

trumpet,394vfe,ZZZ_YYY_ZZZ,3,Tue Jun 9 14:11:07 2015 UTC,"I just picked up the trumpet a couple of months ago and it's going great.  I play the guitar but never learned to read music. I never advanced very far with it, although I did develop a pretty good sense of tonality and rhythm which have definitely helped with the trumpet.  I practiced at least an hour everyday just using youtube videos and am now able to play the blues along with some backing tracks and sound halfway decent. More importantly, I have fun doing it!  It is a difficult instrument but it's an enjoyable one as well. The feeling you get when you finally get a nice tone and your entire body resonates with the music from the core out is very satisfying.  I highly recommend it. It's going to be hard but in my experience it can be done. You really, really need to stay dedicated and committed and practice everyday.  There are tons of great instructional videos on youtube. Watch them all.   Don't be afraid to experiment with mouthpieces. It's important to find one that fits your lips correctly (don't go nuts though).  The most important thing I did was simply this: Go on youtube and find tuning drones. Just play every note along with a drone until it sounds good. Have confidence that you can reproduce what you're hearing and be PATIENT with your lips. They are very fickle and will do things after being warmed up that you never expect, like actually play a note! Warmup is ESSENTIAL. I've never done anything in my life, no sport or activity of any kind where the warmup was so crucial. Be patient!  And rest your lips constantly! Don't force yourself. In the beginning I would literally play 10 seconds or 20 seconds on, and an equal amount of time resting before putting the horn to my face again. I would just count backwards in my head. It took a lot of self-control but SAVED me SO MUCH FRUSTRATION!  Anyway, if you have any more questions from beginner to beginner let me know. And go for it! Don't let these naysayers talk you out of it. Just be realistic and commit to at least an hour a day and be ready to develop PATIENCE!"

Get a few actual lessons when you can, keep playing, and after you've had a little more experience, reflect on it.  If you're having fun, keep at it.  If not, maybe then you sell it.  Don't sell it before you can really start to get some experience though."

trumpet,394vfe,nuvistor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:25:52 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents worth: You can get the basics from many of the links posted here.  Get the basics.  Write them all down.  Practice them. It's going to feel alien for a while but it'll start to feel natural soon enough.  I think an hour a day is overkill. Halve it and you'll be fine.  Keep buzzing night and day.  Get that lactic acid burn in your chops. It means the muscles are breaking down to become stronger for you tomorrow.  Buzz high. (Smaller aperture) Buzz low. Go from low to high as smoothly as you can. Do the opposite.  Control your buzz, because THATS the sound that is gonna come out the end.   Trumpet playing is actually really easy.. In theory.  Breathe downwards (not into your chest) Compress the air with your abdominal/core muscles Control the airstream with the embouchure as you let the compressed air out.  Push valves.  Now, in practice of course it's hard to refine all that into something that comes naturally, but keep focused on those fundamentals and you should be getting a noise that's controlled.  Practice long notes. On the trumpet. On the mouthpiece.  Buzz long notes.   Long notes that don't wobble, that stay the same volume, and that don't have impurities in them (that's a lot to do with your air pressure and not necessarily air speed)   Now you've done that for a couple of months, go get a teacher!"
trumpet,394vfe,916expat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:51:43 2015 UTC,"If you're very dedicated and get a teacher and keep at it, you can become good. But it's going to be a huge uphill climb and you'll sound bad for a long time most likely. Try not to compare yourself so much to people with more experience and try not to get frustrated. My teacher says trumpet can be an evil bitch sometimes, and you'll have good practice days and bad practice days. Even though he's professional and has been playing for 30 years, he too has bad days. Like others have said, you have to keep ""in shape"" with brass more so than other instruments, so it's not really a casual instrument. Having a teacher to guide you at a pace depending on your level, and to help you fix bad habits, is really important. For example...he gave me flexibility exercises in the lower register to help me get used to having my throat more open in the higher register. I tended to squeeze my throat more blowing the higher notes, so the tone suffered...as well as the clarity of the notes. Whatever you do, it comes out of the trumpet. It's an amplifier.    There might be an adult beginner community band in your area. New Horizons is one that has chapters all over the country. In addition to the private lessons, this will get you playing with a group and make it more fun. It's going to be hard, but if you really want to play, go for it. Just be aware it's gonna take a huge amount of dedication and work and don't get discouraged that your sound is going to be bad for a long time. It can take years to develop good tone and intonation."

Trumpet takes a lot of work, over a lot of time, that you'll not notice if you truly love trumpet.   For starts, a few lessons, even YouTube tutorials at first, and learn to find stuff that sounds good but is very simple. When The Saints Come Marching In, Ave Maria, few things like that.   On  Top Of Old Smokey is boring, so I always play On Top Of Spaghetti, the listening audience can't tell and I have more fun.   Keep with it!

Just don't forget to stay relaxed and to always use good technique. If you focus on good technique, today's squeaks will become tomorrow's notes. Did I mention remembering to use good technique? Because make sure you remember to use good technique.   Nothing will kill your chops and frustrate you like trying to muscle out that one high note that you can't seem to get.

Don't pull the horn or put on too much pressure or you'll cease to vibrate.  And keep in mind that you don't need a lot of air.  You need a lot less than you may think.  Once you learn to hit those high stratosphere notes, it'll seem a lot easier than you thought.    I know there's a lot about mouthpiece conspiracy but don't mess with rims or backbones or throats, but maybe a slightly more shallower one?  I have no idea how you play or what you play on, but if you're on a deeper piece then it highlights the lower tones and if you have a slightly shallower one it might make those high notes pop.    You said you can play the high G? Play that and hold it, then really bring your stomach in towards your spine and up towards your lungs and really focus that air with your tongue so that your air shoots like a compressed co2 tank.  Then aim for a g# and make that lock in.  And so on. Good luck!  To be honest though, if you can play up to that G consistently then you really don't need much more.

I still miss playing with a lot of the guys I played with, but it just wasn't good enough pay.  Especially once a good violinist friend of ours made an off the cuff comment about how much she made per show.  Meanwhile, my wife was frequently doubling on up to 5 instruments a show (some combination of flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, soprano/alto/tenor/bari sax, oboe, recorder, tenor recorder, and penny whistle)... and she was not only not getting doubling pay, but she was making less and was a more long timer veteran of the company than our violinist friend (and could play better in tune for what that's worth).  Good luck to them finding anyone who double with oboe.  In my experience you're all single-reeds plus a little flute, or your a snooty oboist who'd never deign to touch anything else (though many flute players I know are also like this).  We've yet to meet anyone who doubles with oboe (at a professional level).

trumpet,38zefm,SaiyanSquad,4,Mon Jun 8 03:09:25 2015 UTC,You have to want to.
trumpet,38zefm,majorkev,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:41:55 2015 UTC,"I do want to, and I do practice. I need to know how I can make myself want to practice MORE."

trumpet,38zefm,Yeargdribble,3,Mon Jun 8 05:54:02 2015 UTC,"/u/orchestraltrumpet has the answer... discipline.  You just need to have the sort of consistency in your practice that makes put in the time even on days where you don't feel like it.  If you rely only on your own intrinsic motivation all the time, it will fail you.  There will be days where you're working on something boring or that you don't like, or you're just not in the mood.  Also, make sure you're challenging yourself rather than just polishing up stuff you're already decent at.  Use a metronome, set goals, and keep a journal of what you're doing.  Especially once your fairly accomplished, the improvements are more granular.  You won't see leaps and bounds and it can feel like you're standing still.  So document it.  Look back in a few months and realize that what was hard and limiting then is now a cakewalk."
trumpet,38zefm,akinsgre,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:19:46 2015 UTC,"The journal and a practice ""script"" does it for me.  When I have to get through my plan and I write it down, it adds some accountability to my practice."
trumpet,38zefm,niliti,2,Mon Jun 8 19:36:24 2015 UTC,"You need to make it part of your routine, and never let yourself make an excuse to break it.  I heard something a while back that really made me look at my efforts in a different way.  Motivation is temporary.  Dedication is what is required.  You can't rely on feeling like playing.  You need to set up a schedule for yourself and stick to it without exception."
trumpet,38zefm,cyhlalala,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:34:25 2015 UTC,"Elaborating on discipline: It shouldn't just be for practicing the trumpet. Discipline is a habit. If you are disciplined in other areas of life, practicing more should be easy, especially since you say you want to."

Whether this is for better or for worse for your mental health is another issue entirely, but I've found that every day I become more aware of just how much more there is I need to learn. Scales, licks, intonation, attacks, range... everything. That's my motivation. Even the best players in the world work harder every day to get better and better. Our instrument is too difficult for anybody to be perfect, but that doesn't keep those who are truly committed to it from trying."
trumpet,38xji0,BitLion,3,Sun Jun 7 18:15:47 2015 UTC,It sounds as if you are using too much mouthpiece pressure. The wrinkle you're referring to could be the outline of your teeth. Try using less pressure.
trumpet,38xji0,The_Dead_Trompette92,3,Sun Jun 7 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"If you're doing anything you would consider ""crushing"" your lips, then you're using way too much pressure.  You shouldn't be pushing against your teeth at all.  Pressure against the mouthpiece should be only just enough to prevent air from escaping around the rim.  I know it's tempting to try using pressure to ascend in range, but this is a bad habit to form.  It's going to hurt you and hinder your progress in the long run."
trumpet,38vdc6,themanoctave,2,Sun Jun 7 03:43:38 2015 UTC,"My recommendation: get a mute bag and a triple gig bag/case for your horns. Protec makes decent, cheap bags and cases that most retailers carry. More expensive options are Gard, Reunion Blues, and Torpedo, but you can sometimes find these used on eBay, craigslist, or trumpet herald.  Dillon and Trent Austin have decent 'doublers' piccs and flugels at a good price point. Typically copies of respected manufacturers that they look over and test thoroughly. Check trumpet herald and YouTube for reviews. Note that not all flugels and piccs take trumpet shanks. Do your research on which mouthpieces work with which horns, because the right mouthpiece can make a dog of a horn at least playable. Mouthpiece Express has a guide for flugel mouthpiece types. Almost all piccs take either cornet or trumpet shanks, but I recommend getting a teacher because playing picc is not like any other trumpet. Takes a lot less air and more finess. Look up videos by Dr. Jack Burt on YouTube about picc playing.  Possibly invest in a mute stand/rack for use in the pit. This will save some space. The hercules brass mute holder on Amazon is okay.  Jo Ral makes EXCELLENT bubble mutes (any metal would do, I prefer the copper). Personally, I have found them to have more consistent intonation and allow a broader range of color than other harmons/bubbles out there. Mutes are worth the investment. You get what you pay for."
trumpet,38vdc6,themanoctave,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:20:17 2015 UTC,Trent doesn't seem to have his picc for sale on his website anymore :(
trumpet,38vdc6,maestro2005,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:38:41 2015 UTC,That's a shame... If you call his store and talk to him he should be able to give you recommendations for similar products. Dillon's picc should be fine for what you need for now though.
trumpet,38vdc6,Sab754,2,Mon Jun 8 14:58:25 2015 UTC,I think I'll go with a thomman picc ( http://www.thomann.de/gb/thomann_tr901s_piccolo_trompete.htm) simply because it's the cheapest I've heard good reviews for. If it won't go through customs fast enough I'll try for a dillons.
trumpet,38vdc6,maestro2005,2,Wed Jun 10 02:10:01 2015 UTC,"There's picc in Les Mis?  I've never played that show but I don't feel like I've ever heard it.  I'm running through the soundtrack in my head and I can't think of where it might be.  If it's not critical, that would be the first thing to cut, just play it on standard trumpet in whatever octave you can.  If you really want to buy, stick to the reputable brands--Getzens can usually be found for surprisingly low prices.  You might be able to rent a flugel if there's a good store nearby.  It plays basically the same as trumpet so you don't need to rent it for the entire rehearsal period, just grab it a week before opening or so.  Otherwise, it's a good thing to have if you're going to be doing theater in the future, so if you can afford to invest now then I'd say go for it.  If you're in or around Boston I have some extra horns that I rent out.  For stands, get the K&M 5-leg stand, they make them for flugel too.  They don't make them for picc, but their clarinet stand fits perfectly.  For mutes, get one of these.  This is one of those products where I honestly have no idea how I even operated before I had it, like Wikipedia or Google Maps.  I've played a ton of harmon/wah-wah mutes, and honestly they're all kinda the same.  The Harmon brand is fine.  I have one with a ribbed rubber ""cork"" which I really like because it sticks in the bell more securely, but the sticker fell off and now I can't figure out what it is."
trumpet,38vdc6,akinsgre,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, there's definitely a piccolo trumpet part there. Our school is doing it too, and it's song 21 (from memory). It's not pitched different though to a Bb trumpet, and the phrases appear in that song in previous songs so we're just not using it. I'd like one though - song stays up in the consistent high C to E range."
trumpet,38vdc6,SgtSiler24,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:26:57 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely look at getting that mute holder, as I'll be using a harmon, straight, cup, and plunger in the show. What about a triple stand, like one for a cornet, trumpet, and flugel?"

I do know someone though who just finished a year of studying at a technical college studying instrument repair and have talked to him a lot about that industry and repair of brass/woodwind instruments in general. Instrument repair is hard work that requires a steady hand and a metric shit ton of practice (like a year of college. apparently).

trumpet,38raba,IDontHaveAnyCrack,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:20:44 2015 UTC,How old is your horn? You may need to use Hetman #3 if your valves have lost some compression. Loose valves + thin valve oil = sticky valves.

trumpet,38rctl,ideas_by_jake,3,Sat Jun 6 03:55:49 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Sorry to hear about your dad! I've got a couple of things you can try.   1) If he has some movement in his 3rd finger, you could try extra light springs in his valves.   2) If that is not possible, then he should try playing with his thumb, 1st and 2nd fingers. Using the pinky will be quite uncomfortable as it is a very weak finger and almost impossible to move independently alongside the 1st and 2nd fingers.  I know someone that has to play using thumb, 1st and 2nd fingers and they got a degree in music and are regularly booked to perform with various ensembles.   Swapping hands is also a possibility if his other hand is stronger.   Perhaps rotary keys might work better as they are flat and easier to reach/press?  Oh and is physiotherapy a possibility?  Just some rambling thoughts for you!"

trumpet,38rctl,socialpains,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"Slide trumpet, maybe, but there'd be no benefit to the bugle. The notes you need third valve to play just can't be played on those horns."
trumpet,38rctl,RocktimusCrime,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:23:53 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly asking out of ignorance, but if there's a significant part of the chromatic scale missing, how did drum corps use them for so long?"
trumpet,38rctl,socialpains,2,Sat Jun 6 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"Well, once you get above C in the staff, everything has an alternate fingering. Most music was written around and above C,  since corps music is supposed to be loud and really putting out volume meant playing a little bit higher than is called for in a non marching setting. Additionally, everything was played in only two or three keys, meaning playing with odd combinations wasn't usually called for, either. They just arranged around it, too."
trumpet,38rctl,iubkud,2,Sat Jun 6 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"Play left handed. Or use the pointer finger on his left hand to replace the ring finger. Think like the fourth valve on a piccolo, but just with the third."
trumpet,38rctl,Architorture92,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:16:24 2015 UTC,Simplest solution would be to play the third valve with his pinky. Awkward at first but I don't see why it wouldn't work. If worst comes to worst switch hands and play lefty perhaps? I'm sure we've all done it while flipping pages
trumpet,38rctl,kickassbandgeek,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:25:56 2015 UTC,I've been known to play with just my 1st and 2nd fingers with my 2nd in the third valve. I use a lot of alternate fingerings and only switch my finger back to the second valve for F#.

One thing I hear is that someone got their horn back from sonic cleaning and there was pitting or scratches.  The fact is that the pitting or scratching or whatever was already there, and the cleaning just revealed it.

The main thing to remember is it's a plastic trumpet it's not meant to sound great. It's meant to survive. My daughter drops it, bangs it, and drags it around the house. But it's cute and pink, and everytime I practice she wants to have hers too.   All that being said, my buddy bought an Allora for his little boy which has stainless steel metal valves which work much better than my Tiger. If I had to do it over again I'd buy the Allora.

Of all the plastic trumpets I've tried, I didn't feel like there were any pronounced issues with the low register, nor do I feel like they were either too open/constricting.  These things are balanced to be playable plastic trumpets.  Oddly enough, I think more thought to design has gone into these things than a lot of student-line instruments on the market, which tend to be cheaper and cheaper regurgitations of the same thing, distilled into a mostly playable lamp-quality pieces of crap."

I believe it is modified Caruso, but not certain.    Step 1: G-F#-G-C-G-E-C ... F#-E#-F#-B-F#-D#-B ... etc Step 2: Octave+6 Lip Slurs: Low F#-A#-C#-F#-A#-C#-D#-C#-A#-F#-C#-A#-F# ---  Other than low A# and the top D#, all notes are played 1-2-3-. Continue this same exercise chromatically in this manner until the partials no longer work, then with standard fingerings to the end of your comfortable warm-up range for that day, taking a break between each arpeggio as long as you just played. Step 3: Clarke's 2nd Technical Study in all keys, again going up chromatically to the end of my range. Step 4: Maybe some articulations if my tongue is feeling sluggish. Step 5: Water and a 15 minute break before anything else."

trumpet,385ote,TrumpedOut,2,Tue Jun 2 01:05:10 2015 UTC,"Lip slurs.   The key to enlightenment.   No but really, accuracy is primarily a result of intense practice. Playing scales doesn't do much except help your finger dexterity. Long tones don't do much besides get the blood flowing in your lips.  I think that a thoughtful approach to lip flexibility is the key to control and accuracy. I usually start with single intervals (schlossberg) for centering my sound, then moving on to more comprehensive exercises when I'm practicing. I highly suggest the schlossberg for this, and additionally the Thibaut book. I would avoid anything by Smith (personal prejudice).  You should also look into the interval studies in the St. Jacome.   And, of course, discuss proper execution with a private teacher. The books are pretty useless by themselves."

If you seriously want to use the horn, take it to a decent shop and let them give it a workover and a chemical bath. Don't experiment around with different chemicals and cleaners as you might damage the finish.  I brought my old TR200 to a local reputable shop a few weeks ago to get a brace soldered; the owner convinced me to let him give it a complete workover - chemical bath, full polish, new springs/corks/washers, he buffed all the slides, took out all the little dings, scrubbed and buffed the insides of the valve caps and buttons, etc. It turned out 10x better than I imaged and looks and plays like a brand new horn - if you've snagged a gem, you may as well polish it!"

You could really badly permanently damage the instrument. If it's something like the mouthpiece is stuck, take it to a music store or music shop, they'll usually fix minor things for free.   On the care side, I recommend having your daughter learn from her instructor on how to properly lubricate the slides and valves, as this should be done at least once a week or usually even less.   I recommend taking the trumpet once a year to a shop and get it hypersonic or chemically cleaned. This will keep it in top shape."

trumpet,380ub6,916expat,3,Mon Jun 1 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"Regarding movable-do solfege with a la-based minor (using 'so' as the resting tone in mixolydian): there's nothing magical about the syllables. Make up your own if you want, but there's nothing wrong with the current syllables, imho. The important thing is that they teach your brain tonality.  If you practice with the syllables, then when you learn a new tune, you'll catch yourself thinking, ""This tune is in Dorian! How did I know? Because I was hearing 're' as the resting tone.""  This process becomes subconscious and you'll ""just know"" the tonality. It gives your brain a quantifiable 'link' to tonal function, which is a very abstract thing otherwise."
trumpet,380ub6,cphuntington97,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:52:10 2015 UTC,"Most people who take music theory learn solfege for sight singing, once you can sight read vocally it transitions extremely well into instruments.  Solfege helps sight singing because it helps you memorize intervals, and the words used also help your pitch when sight singing.  When I took my high school AP music theory test I had 60 seconds to look over the sheet music for two songs, and then 25 seconds to sing(or something close to that.)  For both I practiced it in solfege, and when it came to singing i just used a neutral syllable.  Honestly it was probably one of my most confident parts of the test even though I was not in chorus.  Not sure if more can be contributed or not to what I said, I'm sure there is more though."
trumpet,380ub6,Elverlong,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"Fixed-do solfege is indeed just a renaming of the notes, and IMO is pretty worthless (cue flamewar in 3...2...1...).  Movable-do solfege makes 'do' the tonic of the key, and is a way to talk about tonality without being constrained to a particular key.  The same melody always has the same syllables no matter what key you might transpose it to."

Bach's professional models are pretty good but their student models kinda suck in my opinion. For a student instrument I recommend Yamaha or Getzen.  I can't remember the model number for the Getzen's student model but Yamaha's student models are the 2335 and 2330.  I've never played one but I've heard that Olds made (they're no longer made) good instruments that can be found pretty cheap. Look for the Ambassador model.

Your local music shop will probably have used horns for sale. Craigslist is also a good place to look. Good beginner brands are Bach and Yamaha.   Edit: You want a B-flat trumpet.

trumpet,37mt80,Instantsoup44,2,Fri May 29 02:35:25 2015 UTC,"Gonna second this.  Played on one of these first the first time at a convention.  They are tiny, very quiet, and probably have the least back-pressure of any practice mute I've every tried.  However, if you want cheap, that they aren't."
trumpet,37mt80,Yeargdribble,1 point,Fri May 29 04:47:54 2015 UTC,"Off-topic, but two questions for you:   Do you know anything about Best Brass trumpets? Are they any good? What do you think of your Adams Custom A6 and how does it compare to something more common like a Bach Strad 37?"
trumpet,37mt80,Crowst,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:24:14 2015 UTC,"I have never played a best brass horn, so I cant help you there. My A6, flugel, and A9 are the best horns i have ever owned, and ive had a Monnette LTJ. The A6 is like a conn constellation but way better. It isnt as bright or as straight sounding as a bach. The sound is warmer and more diffused."
trumpet,37mt80,Instantsoup44,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:31:13 2015 UTC,Adams's claim is that it is more free blowing and less strained in the high register too. Is there any truth to that?  Also I noticed the A6 has the smallest bore of all their models. Any reason you chose that over a bigger bore?
trumpet,37mt80,Crowst,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:10:54 2015 UTC,"I mean it plays fine in the upper register, not really my bag so i cant say. It has a small bore yes but the horn has a wide wrap so it doesnt feel as small as it is, but i love it."

trumpet,37mt80,ortrigger,1 point,Thu May 28 23:01:34 2015 UTC,"There are some good ones, but to be perfectly honest, I hate almost every practice mute.  Best bang for your buck: the stubby aluminum ones sold by Windy City Mutes, Pro-Tec, and Dillon Music.  It's a copy of the former design by BestBrass, who makes a lot of my favorite mutes all around.  They redesigned their practice mute, and offer it in either aluminum or plastic (the plastic one is quieter), but they're prohibitively expensive for people who aren't committed to that price point.  The one I mentioned marketed under the 3 vendors is about $30-40.  That said, here's a list of practice mutes I hate:   Jo-Ral Silent Brass Humes & Berg Manny Klein mute   I've owned these, and the ones I didn't sell are now holding fake flowers full-time."

trumpet,37jezm,RedWasatch,2,Thu May 28 01:42:03 2015 UTC,I Play almost exclusively on vintage conns and couldn't be happier. My main horn right now is a 1947 conn 22b NYS model and it is a joy to play. Plus for 400$ it can't be beat.
trumpet,37j2kz,RedWasatch,3,Thu May 28 00:11:41 2015 UTC,"Actually no. You don't want to do that at all. Those muscles are only for dropping a deuce and birthing children. They are awful and actually a little harmful for trumpet playing. Why? The Valsalva Maneuver  So the action works two ways: you have the pushing motion with the aforementioned muscles but to be truly effective, your throat has to close off in order to create back pressure. Try it (don't poop yourself) you'll feel your throat close up, your neck swell, and you'll make like a little 'hnnggg' sound. That's bad.  You can use your abdominal muscles to reach for high notes or rather, you can use them to scream notes you can already squeak. Maynard said ""push your belly button into your back"" which is a somewhat similar motion but very different from the Valsalva Maneuver."
trumpet,37j2kz,ScreamerA440,1 point,Thu May 28 00:51:51 2015 UTC,Okay but it does seem like I can engage those muscles without closing off my airway.
trumpet,37j2kz,CatVaginaBackwash,2,Thu May 28 01:07:14 2015 UTC,I agree with screamer.  Don't use your pooping muscles. You'll give yourself a hernia or prolapse. Push your air up by bringing your stomach in and up. And don't take in a lot of air. Just enough to play the passage required.

trumpet,37j2kz,autowikibot,0,Mon Jun 1 11:02:33 2015 UTC,"Valsalva maneuver:       The Valsalva maneuver or Valsalva manoeuvre is performed by moderately forceful attempted exhalation against a closed airway, usually done by closing one's mouth, pinching one's nose shut while pressing out as if blowing up a balloon. Variations of the maneuver can be used either in medical examination as a test of cardiac function and autonomic nervous control of the heart, or to ""clear"" the ears and sinuses (that is, to equalize pressure between them) when ambient pressure changes, as in diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or air travel.

trumpet,37j2kz,ortrigger,2,Thu May 28 00:52:27 2015 UTC,"Using those muscles in your lower abdomen may seem like a good idea but it's not. You'll end up crapping your pants. Instead, research deep breathing exercises and learn to engage your diaphragm to keep the air pressure consistent. Not only will this save you a mess and some embarrassment but it will help you in all aspects of your playing."

trumpet,37gvcl,ben7xxrd,3,Wed May 27 15:18:22 2015 UTC,"Breathing exercises, Yoga, meditation, general physical health is important as is knowing that playing trumpet is very not about using all of your muscles and tension to play - that's quite the exact opposite of the goal we should all have."

trumpet,37gvcl,YCANTUSTFU,1 point,Wed May 27 23:23:43 2015 UTC,I'm always surprised by how much stretching every day before playing helps. Some basic stretches like shoulder rolls and other things to loosen up your neck and shoulders are all great.
trumpet,37gvcl,ColbertNation893,2,Mon Jun 1 01:06:27 2015 UTC,"i once attended a masterclass and the visiting professor said to one of the students: ""Don't be so tense!"" Student: ""How do I practice and not get tense?"" Professor (with a smile): ""Practice. And don't get tense."" :)"
trumpet,37gvcl,zanflorjan,2,Wed May 27 18:43:24 2015 UTC,"Something I have been working on (in the midst of my complete embouchure rebuilding) is finding the right angle. Try angling your head down so its as tall as it can be (the back of your head being the top, ie where most people's hair parts) and I find that helps me open up my throat and generally feel more relaxed.  Here is a great article written by trumpeter Eric Berlin on a few more details on the physical aspects of playing. Check out the rest of the blog too, its all very helpful!"
trumpet,37gvcl,OceanicMeerkat,1 point,Wed May 27 21:07:54 2015 UTC,"Most students that have embouchure problems don't need an embouchure change, they just need to find the right angle to hold the horn.  Best way to do this is by doing very long tones with just the lead pipe. Adjust the pivot slowly and keep the air constant. Keep doing this while focusing on relaxing any muscles that aren't critical to playing the horn and eventually you'll (OP or whoever is reading this) feel the instrument respond. Memorize that exact feeling and repeat for like 10 minutes a day, every day."
trumpet,37gvcl,ScreamerA440,2,Thu May 28 00:43:51 2015 UTC,"Been working on this so much lately!  Step 1 - Monitor yourself. Figure out where the tension happens. Is it in your arms, your neck, your back, your shoulders? Also, when does it happen? For me, tension usually crops up in loud/high playing  Step 2 - Start easy. Play in a comfortable place (both register and dynamic) and then work your way towards the places where you have tension. Try to stay relaxed as you get out of your comfort zone. Baby steps, don't skip anything until you can do it with ease.  Keep in mind that more often than not, the tension roots itself before you even start playing. Make sure your posture, grip, and breath are all easy and flexible. Alexander technique helps me a lot too.  Good luck and don't worry, this is something that 99% of players struggle with at some point."
trumpet,37gvcl,Hanktpt,1 point,Wed May 27 21:59:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this will help, but try this. Set your embouchure as if you're playing high register, whatever that may be you. Now take a moderate breath, bring your stomach in to your spine and up towards your lungs, and let a fast compressed air stream go. Not a lot of air, just fast. And try to think with your chops as relaxed by refusing to squeeze them together and try to mentally visualize your air going forwards and use your diaphragm to ""blow out a candle at the other end of the room.  Don't tense up your chops to get the air going faster or more compressed.  There aren't really exercises to play relaxed rather, you have to force yourselves to play with as relaxed chops as possible. The corners should be slightly tense just to make the seal but the part of your chops that are in your piece should be relaxed. Why am I talking about your chops? Because if your chops are relaxed and you have a decent sized aperture going, your sound will be as full as it normally is, if not fuller, and since the air is going through a larger aperture, there's less back pressure in your throat.  Let your air flow through by your diaphragm. Not through a tiny aperture.  This is all, of course, assuming since you're trying to relieve tension, you tense up your chops and try to make a small aperture. I think, from what you've said, that you play as a tension player in the chops, and you try to force a lot of air through a small opening. Well, it can't all I through, so it causes back pressure in your throat which can lead to other injuries."
trumpet,37gvcl,CatVaginaBackwash,1 point,Thu May 28 05:40:29 2015 UTC,"I try not to relive tension very much.  I have enough of it the first time.  :P  Really though, how tense are you feeling when you play?  I can't say that I ever feel any neck tension at all when I play.  Are you clenching your neck muscles?  Pretty much everything above your abdominal muscles and below your head should be relaxed (aside from your arms of course).  Edit:  Just wanted to ask a question about posture.  Do you sit or stand when you play?  If you're sitting, you should be sure you're making a habit of sitting up straight.  If you're sitting and slouching, that could cause neck strain."

I don't know if it was a joke or your are just being not so smart.  This is my second year with the trumpet (and the first doing the right things). If you practice with a mirror, you can watch yourself and you will find the wrong tension. It helped me a LOT.  My embouchure (fucking strange word) was hideous and my new teacher fixed it. It changed my flow of air, I'm less tired and as I practice I can see what I'm not doing right.  If you see your neck doing shitty things, stop, relax or rest, and do it naturally."

When I'm really trying to scream - say a super g - I find having a lot of pressure and tension doesn't help, and alcohol can help relax your whole play on style. Obviously this isn't recommended for anything serious, by personally I find a pint or two for big band gigs can help."

Things like Dandelot, Fontaine, Weber, Lysight, Clacens, Phyliba. The list goes on. I think you might have a different idea of what solfege is.

trumpet,37ey1n,gramson,1 point,Wed May 27 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"No, that's exactly what I've done before - I've just never heard of it being called ""key reading"" before. In my college theory and aural skills classes we used solfege for sight singing all the time (do re mi fa sol, etc.). I suppose practicing more of that would help my trumpet playing as well, although things don't always transfer super easily to actually playing on the horn."
trumpet,37eera,TheShaymin,7,Wed May 27 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"The two ingredients to extended range are faster air and smaller aperture.   It's extremely important that you make the aperture (or hole the air goes out between your lips) smaller without it becoming pinched or forced. I like to think of a drawstring bag closing, the closure is even and never stressed.   Saying that one needs less air to play high is misleading. Less air might be going through the instrument due to the smaller aperture but you need to be pushing just as much air through your lungs as with any other kind of playing, if not more.   Finally and most importantly, fast air is critical. All of brass air usage can be grossly generalized by the statement that volume of sound is determined by the volume of air you use and that range is determined by the speed of the air. A larger column of vibrating air will result in a bigger sound. Faster air moving across your lips results in a higher frequency of vibration in your lips and in the air, translating to a higher pitch.   There's the theory, now here's the practical side. Practice maintaining a fast air column by holding a piece of paper against a wall using nothing but your air stream while standing a few inches from the wall. This requires a high speed and volume of air.   Maintaining a small aperture can be practiced by holding a pencil outright from your mouth. Form a trumpet embouchure and place the tip of a sharpened pencil (not mechanical) into the aperture of your embouchure. Make sure only the cone-shaped sharpened portion of the pencil is in your aperture. Hold the pencil parallel to the ground using nothing but your embouchure for as long as you can a few times a day. Try to increase the time you hold the pencil out each day.   Finally, it's critical to avoid bad habits. Don't let your lower lip curl over your teeth while playing high - the aforementioned exercises will help with this some. Avoid excess pressure; you'll still need some, but less is best. Play as high as you can while holding the trumpet by only resting it in the crook of your hands between your thumb and index fingers. Additionally, it's good to change as little of your face as possible as you move up the range, so practice in front of a mirror to observe any change that might happen as your range goes up and minimize it as much as you can. For practicing this I really like to use the following exercise: start on a note that is well within your comfortable range, at least a perfect fourth below the high part of comfortable. Play that note, followed by the note a perfect fourth above. Rest for half a second, but do not remove your face from the horn. Then, play a low G below the staff without changing your face. Continue this exercise by raising the first two notes a half step each time and always returning to a low G. Never remove your  mouth from the horn between the high note and low G. For example, when I do this I start with the G at the top of the staff and play HighG-HighC-LowG rest HighG#-HighC#-LowG rest HighA-HighD-LowG rest until I cannot play any higher.  Sorry for the wall of text, hope this helps some, best of luck! Always remember, good high range is an essential part of successful trumpet playing, but it's only that - a PART of trumpet playing."
trumpet,37eera,M0hnJadden,1 point,Wed May 27 01:53:51 2015 UTC,Don't let your lower lip curl over your teeth while playing high   This is key.
trumpet,37eera,RedWasatch,2,Wed May 27 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"There are dissertations on trumpet about increasing range. A google scholar search will find tons I'm sure. What I've boiled it down to in my playing is that your chops are muscles. If you don't walk or use your legs for 6 months and then try to dead lift 300 pounds, how successful do you think you're going to be? Not very successful at all. It takes daily structured practice just like doing pull ups takes systematic daily work ( I say pull ups because I'm trying to get to the point where I can do ten pull ups, it sucks). All the other details are secondary. You might need to tweak how you hold your lips or place your tongue or whatever, but if you're not playing every day, I have found that my range, tone, articulation, flexibility and all around ability to play musically with confidence decline significantly. Do you take private lessons? You should. It's hard to diagnose why you're having trouble at the top of the staff over reddit..."
trumpet,37eera,ProfessorWhat42,2,Wed May 27 03:29:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's been said already, but you want your tongue level high. That compresses the chamber and means a faster air flow.  Pressure is on the lower lip and teeth like a shock absorber, and that allows the upper lip to vibrate more freely.  That, and pretend like you're taking a dump. It's the same muscles involved in tightening up that diaphragm. The higher you go, the deeper you go.  Never trust a fart."
trumpet,37eera,ajramone,1 point,Wed May 27 03:16:12 2015 UTC,"I try to never go for longer than two days at most with no trumpet playing at all. That's only in the case of a really long recording session or a gig where I play lead.   I personally can't speak to the puckering method OR the smaller aperture method since in my opinion, they just give you too much to worry about and analyze (which is definitely a bad thing when done too much) when you're already trying to do something difficult. My upper register methods mainly consist of Clarke 1's up an octave, some of the Maggio exercises and playing common melodies up an octave. My personal key is that I have to be as relaxed  It may be considered unhealthy, but some days if I don't have to practice a lot, I'll go to the top of my usable range and then go beyond it. When you play a squeak or a tinny little blat, you'll hate it soundwise BUT you will also have felt the note and it'll be easier to access.   Here's some misc knowledge I came across the other day that I think is pretty cool too, it discusses feeling lightheaded in the upper register."
trumpet,37eera,SirBrass,1 point,Wed May 27 05:33:07 2015 UTC,"I'm just a beginner but preventing my lower lip from curling back has completely changed my playing in only a couple of days.  Instead I keep my lower lip inside the cup of the mouthpiece as much as possible and those higher notes seem to come from the very tip of my lips where the lower meets the higher.  Thinking of ""duck face"" or like an exaggerated kiss or pucker isn't far off but it shouldn't be too extreme.   There is a tendency to tighten the lips against the teeth to go higher but this is exactly the opposite of what you want to do. Push your lips into the mouthpiece. It takes some practice and patience especially if you've developed the habit of pulling like I had.  Anyway, like I said I'm just a beginner but this was such a miracle for me that I felt I had to share.  Now I haven't explored this guy's whole lesson plan but this video was what inspired me to try something different.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joCN-3rZ2n8  Anyway, ymmv, good luck!"

trumpet,37eera,Zeriaxian,-2,Wed May 27 01:00:32 2015 UTC,Pucker your lips into the mouthpiece the higher you go. Don't force it. The upper register will use less but faster air than the lower.

trumpet,37eera,CatVaginaBackwash,1 point,Wed May 27 05:17:42 2015 UTC,"Watch videos of Maynard. Relaxed chops and unfurled by bringing the tissue in your lips, out and into the mouthpiece. I do this and it's great. You buzz all the way across and get a huge sound. You can play high by a small aperture and a good tongue level and tensed. Or you can play high by relaxing your chops and bringing the inner tissue out and really focusing on your breathing so that your air is like a jet.  Look up compression breath by Roger Ingram on YouTube or bobby shews wedge breath.    I'll probably get downvoted like the other guy but this is what works for me and, while unconventional at first, is a real payoff.  It's also different then you've probably been playing in the past.  Watch Maynard and he unfurls like a monster. There's a video of him playing don't let the sun, where they are all wearing yellow in the back. Look at his chops when hey zoom in on him. Check out Maggio and his lips are like a monkey (although he had to learn to play like that because he damaged his chops).  You can't be tensed in your lip area for this to work. You need to compress your air and let it out.  Visualize trying to make your lungs like those tanks of air that are used to blow up balloons. The air is super compressed and when the nozzle is open (your chops), the air comes out in incredible speeds. This isn't he same as pushing more air through the horn. This is faster, compressed air. You don't need a lot of air to play trumpet.  Don't tense up. Relax your chops and use your stomach/diaphragm to compress your air so it shoots out in fast bursts.  Don't roll your chops in. Your chops barely vibrate as it is so do you think your skin, by rolling in the red, will vibrate any easier?   If that doesn't make sense then think of it like this. Your lips are in the air all day and chapped and open to the environment. The tissue slightly inside right in front of your teeth are moist, relaxed, and undamaged by the environment. What vibrates easier? Wood? Or rubber?    At the very least, if you don't want to try unfurling your chops, there's a lot of information that would help you. Play relaxed and use your air correctly.   EDIT: also, are you in high school? What's your experience level?  Do you NEED the range? It will definitely make the middle end easier.  Do you have a private teacher?  A teacher that plays trumpet in general?  A good teacher is open to ideas. Not tying to force HIS habits into you. Everything I said above is based on, you've been playing for a while, you're looking to try anything new to see if it works, you have had lessons before, etc. good luck!  There's a method for everyone, I think tensing up and making a small aperture is asinine.  But hey, I played in a drum core where the lead soloist could scream like no other. He played with a small aperture and a high tongue level. I also have been in the same room as Lynn Nicholson. Let me tell you, he is definitely relaxing his chops, unfurling, and using his air. His double C is literally scary."

trumpet,37eera,zeroexev29,0,Wed May 27 01:49:23 2015 UTC,"I'm only an amateur, but after 8 or so years my range developed fairly naturally as far as I could tell. I liked to push myself in high school pep band (and blew my chops plenty of times in the process). I can hit a Ledger Line C with relative ease now, currently going for consistent E's.   Playing anything in your upper register is good practice, as it tempers your chops well. So find music to practice that keeps you up there for prolonged periods. Push yourself a bit but don't overdo it. And maintain good embouchure (mouth position) as it will help with consistency."
trumpet,37eera,ZZZ_YYY_ZZZ,-3,Wed May 27 01:51:36 2015 UTC,"Your lips is a rubber band. You know when you pull a rubber band and play it like a guitar?

trumpet,37eera,RedWasatch,1 point,Wed May 27 02:05:33 2015 UTC,"This is the opposite of what you want to do. Yes, you want your lips ""tighter"" but not by pulling them but by pushing them together using the leverage of the mouthpiece. It's much much easier this way."
trumpet,37d9zb,Zeriaxian,2,Tue May 26 19:59:23 2015 UTC,"I went through this exact issue around the age of 14-16. (I'm a professional player now.) I struggled with it for quite a while, but the best piece of advice I got about it was this:   You don't have a tonguing problem! You just need to learn a new skill. You don't need to learn how not to tongue the way you're used to. You just need to introduce a new skill ('correct' tongue placement) and if you do it every day then over time you'll be able to use it when you're actually playing music. Don't expect to be able to tongue 'correctly' right away while you're playing in band. You'll need to get used to it over a period of weeks or months.   Slow, diligent tonguing practice will be the most helpful. The Shuebruk single-tonguing exercises, done very slowly (like eighth-note = 60) will help tremendously. Also - find a qualified private teacher.   PM me if you'd like more advice, or help finding a good teacher."
trumpet,37d9zb,YCANTUSTFU,3,Wed May 27 23:33:34 2015 UTC,"To me, putting the tounge through the teeth and in contact with the lips sounds like a bad idea, as it will bring down your flexibility.  On the other hand, the thing about trumpet especially is how personal you must treat learning it. No mouth cavity/jaw/lips are the same, so do what works optimal for you. My teacher rests the tip of his tounge on the front bottom teeth, and does the actual tounging with the middle of the tounge. It seems to work for me too, so i'm trying that. Don't get too caught up in the way a band director thinks it should be done, you should focus more on getting it to sound right."
trumpet,37d9zb,Asfomu,1 point,Tue May 26 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies so fast, both of you, my main problem with it is that it reduces my flexibility, I can't double tongue doing it, and it affects sound negatively.

trumpet,37d9zb,LeeMorgan,1 point,Tue May 26 20:25:08 2015 UTC,"Try buzzing with just the mouthpiece. Try to move your tongue in the same way that you do when you say ""dah."" It might take a while for it to feel natural, but this is generally the way that will sound the clearest."
trumpet,37d9zb,niliti,1 point,Tue May 26 20:52:29 2015 UTC,"You may just want to start off slowly.  Start buzzing into your mouthpiece, cut the stream of air with the tip of your tongue at the top of your teeth, then move the tongue down, releasing it.  It doesn't have to be super clean to start off, but just try to get used to the feel of doing this way.  I've seen people do what you're describing, and from that experience it seems like they have a harder time getting really clean, quick articulation.  It also seems like it would make it a lot harder to articulate when you flutter tongue because the position for tonguing is so far away from where your tongue needs to be to flutter.  Have you tried thinking in terms of saying ""tu tu tu"" when you tongue?  Do you put your tongue to your lips when you say that or does your tongue go to the back of your teeth?"
trumpet,37d9zb,niliti,1 point,Tue May 26 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"When I say tu off of my mouthpiece, my tongue goes to the back of my teeth, but trying to tongue on my mouthpiece my tongue goes to my lips, I believe due to bad habits developed back in Middle School I never fixed until just now. I'll have to start slow, like you said. Thanks for the reply!"
trumpet,37d9zb,Malachite6,1 point,Wed May 27 00:51:14 2015 UTC,"I hear ya.  I spent my school years using only my lip compression and compression from my abdomen to ascend in pitch.  I've learned in the past year that it should actually be my tongue doing most of the work.  I had been told so many times to ""keep an open airway"" that I thought it meant to keep the back of my tongue down too.    So, I'm now trying to incorporate the back of my tongue into my playing, and it's not the easiest thing to do.  Breaking old habits can be a real struggle.  Once it starts to click for you I bet you'll have an easier time playing.  That's been my experience when breaking bad habits.  The payoff is worth the effort."

I think that as long as you sound good and get the articulation that you desire, then it doesn't really matter how you tongue the note. However, I could be wrong. If you're REALLY set on changing your tonguing style though, just practice. At first, you'll have to put thought into how you tongue each note, but with practice it'll become automatic."
trumpet,379am1,PlatinumFade,4,Mon May 25 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"Hey friend. I do a lot of work with students over the summer and we talk about maintenance and development a ton. The summer is when I get my best work done. I'm no longer stifled by 6 hours of ensembles a day and the high expectations of teachers, directors, etc. I can chill out in my studio for hours a day, relax, and return to the casual joy of playing and improving.  Now is the time to do two things simultaneously: Build Habits and experiment.  I would start by picking four warm ups that you think (between all four of them) cover every aspect of trumpet fundamentals. You know, grab a long tone exercise, a flexibility, a technique, and an articulation exercise. You can pull them from Arban, Vizzutti, Cichowicz, Irons, Stamp, or just make one up that you think would work. do those warm ups and only those warm ups sequentially the exact same way for a week or two. Did you like them? do you think they ""worked""? Then try a new set for a two weeks, then a new set, then a new set, until you discover how you 'respond' to various exercises. It's funky, but you'll only notice the difference if you do it consistently.  For example: Stamp's first study and Cichowicz flow seem very similar and at first, it would appear you could do them interchangeably. But I know, from having spent time with both of them, that they accomplish different things for my playing. Now that I know what each ""does"" for me i can pick which one I think I need for the day and do that. Summer is great for building a routine and a routine is great for building a foundation upon which you can do the next thing:  Experiment. You need to work on articulation? Try 60 second drills: just play 8th notes on a treble C at quarter = 84 for a minute straight (breathe as necessary) then either increase the speed a tick or change pitches. Document your progress. Find articulation exercises in any of your books, start slowly, and learn one or two of them perfectly over the next three months. You will discover the correct way to do it in a few weeks without needing input from a teacher. You just will. That's what practicing is for.   Then experiment with other stuff: find cool rep on youtube, order it, and just play through it. If a solo grabs your ear, spend an hour working on it every day. See how far you can get. There are no consequences. There is no failure. It's summer! You need not have a goal in mind. You need not sprint or panic practice or push yourself. Instead you get to slow down, explore the instrument, understand how you relate to it. You can focus in while also taking is the scenery.  Which U of I, by the way? Indiana, Illinois, or Iowa?"

trumpet,377t7k,ScreamerA440,1 point,Mon May 25 17:42:42 2015 UTC,"Not typically. Rite doesn't get pulled out as much as petrouchka or historie du soldat. If you have the whole C and D parts I would pull up your favorite recording and try to play along. Find sections where the trumpets are featured prominently and put the polish on those. That way if you're asked for a section you weren't expecting you will at least know the context but you'll also have the most obvious parts down. Nothing else I can really say. Usually auditions don't say ""Prepare some excerpts from this piece"" they'll say ""Prepare these excerpts, a solo from the repertoire, this Charlier Etude, and be ready to sight or section-test music from the orchestral repertoire."""

trumpet,3765k7,TeachMeHowToDuzy,3,Mon May 25 05:11:47 2015 UTC,"Do your long tones with a drone track. The meditative aspect of trying to listen for overtones and complimentary tones is incredibly helpful to me day-in-day-out.  Also, and I'm sure I'll be crucified for this: it is not necessary to do tons of long tones to warm up. You can do like 2 minutes of long tones then switch to Clarkes or Lip Slurs or whatever else you like so long as you stay in a comfortable range and focus on the good habits like your air stream and such.  Also, I wager your embouchure hasn't deteriorated as much as you think. It's the swelling response that's screwing with you if you're getting tired after a few minutes. Your face isn't used to the unique stimulus of playing trumpet (which we are not at all designed as humans to do) so it thinks your lips are being stressed (technically correct) so it starts the immune response. Do a 5 - 10 minute warm up in the bottom half or below the staff then come back in 20 minutes, you'll feel better and probably be able to go a half hour or so before you start to feel fatigued.  Just don't go reaching for glory notes for about a month. I recommend expanding your horizons as well. Nothing gets your mind off the physical aspects of playing quite like trying to learn new tunes. Getting a Real Book or opening your old one and learning some new charts is a great start. Good luck."

trumpet,37659i,RedWasatch,3,Mon May 25 05:08:44 2015 UTC,"I don't remember whether it' a straight or conical bore instrument (I think it's straight if I remember right, but don't quote me on that - let someone else take the blame), but one interesting thing to interject about cornets is what style of instrument they are.  You're going to find a few basic designs of cornet:   Shepherd's crook, like the ones guys use in British brass bands.  Look at the Besson design for an example of this.  These are conical instruments. American-style sans the Shepherd's crook.  Many of these are straight bore, basically making them...a funny shaped trumpet.  They're essentially made to be more obnoxious then the Shepherd's crook design.  The Shepherd's crook design is mostly used to sound nice.   The bastard designs, like the old Holton Herbert L Clarke model, the array of Conn cornets, Pan American (stencils by Conn), etc.  These are basically outdated designs, since trumpet and cornet have been horribly homogenized in the last 50-60 years.  These designs have all sorts of wacky features, like the opera glass tuning crook on some of the Conn cornets, especially long designs that basically appear to be trumpets, etc.  A lot of companies were really adventurous with these back in the day, which makes them a great point of conversation.  Information can be kind of spotty on them sometimes, due to awful literature distributed with the instruments, word-of-mouth simply being wrong, and poor measurements by people who've checked these things out.  The best thing to do is to ask somebody who's measured the areas that would show whether it was a straight or conical bore.  The better thing to do, is just play the damn thing, and not ask any questions if it's working.   For what it's worth, I had a Conn 80A cornet (made in 1937) when I was in college.  I made it a point to play as many cornet solos for recitals as I could.  People seemed to dig it, since most of the music program was populated by vocalists, and even they got sick of hearing one another.  This was one of Conn's ""opera glass"" tuning mechanism instruments, which gave me some flexibility to move the main tuning slide in better positions.  These were designed to play in both Bb and A, though, which also made it fun.  If you like the 38B, however, have you tried the 36B?  It's basically a lighter version of the 38B, but with a smaller bell diameter.  They're great horns for commercial/lead playing, if you're looking for a companion to a 38B.  The only downside, is that since a lot of great lead players play these things (Brian MacDonald, Dan Falcone, etc), they've regained a lot of popularity in the last decade or so, thus driving the price up.  People who like them, tend to buy more than one, as well.  That said, if anyone wants to give one away, feel free to ship it to me.  =)    TL;DR:  There are conical bores trumpets, and straight bore cornets.  It's wacky, dude."

My chops have crashed already in the past and I just feel like my practice is reenforcing a bad type of pressure on the top lip. again.  I do have a private teacher but my problem's kind of hard to explain. I tell him about it and try to show him what's wrong, but all that happens is him going ""It looks good,"" and mentions that ""if it looks good, and sounds good, then it's a good mouth position.""   I try to spam Clarke's and Chicowitz flow but I just feel like practice won't mean anything unless I feel confident about having a good mouth position.  My teeth are crossbited and I have a slight underbite, and my teeth are a little inconsistent from left to right. I can't help but feel like the right side of the upper lip dips further down across the top teeth than the left side of my upper lip, which I feel gets scrunched against the teeth/gums and doesn't vibrate."

I was in that mindset (and still am at times) but the best thing for my playing was to take a long break (sometimes not possible, a week would suffice if you can't manage any more than that). Just put the horn away and forget about trumpet for a bit. About half way through your break start listening to your absolute favorite recordings of trumpet. Anything that inspires you will be perfect. Just listen and enjoy. After you decide your break is over pick up the horn and your first day back just play one note. Play a G or a C or whatever feels good. Make it have a beautiful beginning, middle, and end. This isn't to beat a dead horse but rather to remind yourself what it feels like to sound good. Scale that up and keep working over some time and eventually you'll always refer back to, ""Do I sound as good as I could here?""   I understand I gave you zero advice about a proper embochure but you might be surprised at how big of a role you brain plays in how you sound and how it feels. Look around at other professional players embochures and see how they play, many of them are more jacked than any of us have ever been. You just have to adapt it to your face and realize that every person is different. I have always always struggled with range but for some reason or another I can get a consistent solid sound when others couldn't. We will always have that one thing that we feel the need to overcome; that's normal.   And to close, I want to disclaim that I am not nor have I ever been a professional player or instructor. I actually haven't played much in the past few years because I've been starting a family but I just wanted to share what's helped me in the past."

trumpet,370swq,DXLVXR,1 point,Sat May 23 20:19:26 2015 UTC,"This is one of those things that comes with time. A few things that help my students:  -Sing a note and release. How do you release? Just stop singing. It is almost the same with trumpet.   -Usually the issue comes about because of either something off happening with the throat or lips or tongue controlling the release or poor air support to the end of the note. Try to hold your finger in front of your mouth and imagine it's a candle. Blow it out with a short sharp breath, then a long sharp breath. Both breaths should be completely even - don't taper the air, but instead have your air either fully switched on or fully switched off.   -If it's happening only on higher notes, there's a chance that you're using a crutch of some kind to reach those notes - maybe mouthpiece pressure or the tongued attack is helping you reach the highest notes but your air support or tongue arch or embouchure is lacking in order to keep them up. I would not worry too much about this; instead focus your efforts on solid tone and support in the range that you completely control."

Second, referring to warming up and such, I would assume it's based on the teacher. If it's your first time, you'll probably warm up there. When I go, we spend lots of time warming up; it's EXTREMELY important. Lastly, referring to questions, ask him/her what you should do about problems you have, what music to work on, etc. Be sure to ask what are some fundamental things you should be doing everyday (scales, articulation practice, long tones, etc.) Hope this helps!"

trumpet,36q0yh,tda86840,3,Thu May 21 05:27:49 2015 UTC,"V cup and open blowing aren't going to get too many hits if you want a lead piece. Part of what makes lead pieces effective is their high resistance due to having a shallow cup and tight backbore. You need that resistance to get the horn to respond in the upper register without using too much energy (yes I know, some people can pop double Cs on 1 1/4 cups, they are mutants).  If you want to look at something with an easier grade then you might start with the mouthpiece comparator in the sidebar and find something a little deeper than a 14 or 13a4a with a similarly tight backbore. I played on a Schilke 13b for awhile and liked it. You might also like the Yamaha Bobby Shew model. If you want a fitting, you could check out Pickett or GR."
trumpet,36q0yh,ScreamerA440,1 point,Thu May 21 05:48:55 2015 UTC,"I realize that some of the preferences don't go together which is why I'm open to changing some. Resistance would actually be the first to go. I just prefer the open blow feeling, but I can live without it.  I've spent a lot of time with the comparator over the past few days and have come to love it (didn't know it existed until I started looking for a new piece)."
trumpet,36q0yh,ScreamerA440,1 point,Thu May 21 05:56:38 2015 UTC,"Well... If you want a free blowing mouthpiece but still want to screech you might start with a standard lead piece then gradually move away incrementally. Alternatively, you might try a smaller lead pipe with a large mouthpiece in order to get some resistance so the horn responds. The problem with the upper register is that the tight, fast vibrations have to ""hit"" something. If you imagine shooting a laser through a long hallway (not entirely accurate but the visualization works) then you'll see that you would have a harder time getting it to touch a wall and come out clean the other side.  But really, ITG is coming up. Swoop out to Colombus, OH and check out Pickett, Gr, and Warburton. They've got options on options and you can try and try until something responds the way you're looking for."
trumpet,36q0yh,Vero9000,2,Thu May 21 06:01:11 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for v style cups with no bite, check out the legends brass Maynard ferguson pieces. The diameters might be a little small, but because of the style of those pieces the dimensions aren't exactly right when measured. Some models even have pretty large throats for a free-blow too!"
trumpet,36q0yh,CatVaginaBackwash,1 point,Thu May 21 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"More info:  I've been playing for about 11 years so I know that mouthpieces are not magic wands and that I need to find what I'm most comfortable on and sound the best on. I know what I'm comfortable with and have achieved good sounds on other mouthpieces and will continue using what I sound best on until I find something better. So right now, I'm looking for that ""it"" mouthpiece. The one that just works for me.   What I've found myself most comfortable on is a System Blue Tp2. It has a rounded rim (feels like a pillow on my chops), V style cup, has little to no resistance, and is approximately equivalent to a Bach 3c. Unfortunately I can't find any measurements for it anywhere (if anyone has some, I would be forever grateful), otherwise I would just take the measurements and find an equivalent with a shallower cup - for some reason I didn't like the SB Tp1 which should be what I'm looking for (hence the quest to find my ""it"" mouthpiece).  I've played on a Bach 3f before and did enjoy it. If I can't find this ""it"" mouthpiece, I'll most likely end up sticking with the SB Tp2 and getting the 3f for when ever I'm in the extreme upper registers for an extended amount of time.  I'm also considering a Bach 5SV for the shallow V style hoping it works out.  Also considering a Bobby Shew but don't know much about them."
trumpet,36q0yh,TheJoeD,1 point,Thu May 21 05:45:18 2015 UTC,"Shallow v with a rounded rim?  Check out stomvi mouthpieces and look at their Groovin High piece.  It's extremely small.  GR has one that's made by Dan mcmillion and it's slightly larger than stomvis. The monette BL5 is the same concept. These are all v cups that are slightly bowled.  I play on Ingram's V cup which is ever so slightly bowled. I modified the throat on it, but if you can play it, it's very comfortable.  Look up warburton MF piece. It's not the jet tone style cup.  It's a straight V, not curving in or out, just straight. I want to say that Greg blacks NY4s is a copy of the giardinelli/warburton straight v, but it could be like the slight bowls ones.   Lastly! The mf jet tones models. There's a few different kinda. Hard to play, efficient if you can.  The mouthpieces cup curves in so there is very very very little chop room.  This is not the same mouthpiece as the above mentioned.  Legend mouthpieces has a few copies of these.   Or if you're looking for other ""v-cups"", there's cups that are still mostly a bowl. Check out warburtons ESV cups. They remind me of past jet tones. I saw that you play on Bach 3 size mouthpieces but these are some shallow v cups that I know of. I'd really recommend trying them out because these pieces are small and shallow.   You can still get a huge sound out of them. Check out lynn Nicholson on YouTube. He plays mostly these small v cups and his sound is scary big."

However, having equipment that fits properly is extremely important! I play on a rim size that measures to approximately a Bach 4 because that is the size that I've found works best with the size and shape of my lips. One of the other trumpet players in my college studio played a Bach 1B because he had large lips and the way he approaches the formation of his embouchure is different.  I love comparing trumpet playing to golf. Having properly fitted golf clubs will not automatically make you a better golfer, but having the equipment that is best suited to your physical makeup and abilities will make the learning process much less frustrating.

trumpet,36bu6x,ImWrong_OnTheNet,3,Mon May 18 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"So this album contains two old trumpets of mine, both beaters, so don't clutch your pearls just yet.   The first is a TR300 that I had stripped raw several years ago, and was my main trumpet for teaching (I'm really a percussionist). The finish was chipped and worn, so time for some questionable experiments! I used Copper Sulfate, which is a root killer that is also used to make metal patinas, to put some color on it. It turned out a strange, uneven plum color. Didn't dig it. I was going to strip it and start over, so I soaked it in CLR Lime remover, and it turned kind of pink/copper/orange stuff. I actually liked that one a lot, so I applied gloss lacquer, and trimmed it with some heavy CCaps, Red Jasper buttons from Brass-Fix UK, and a guard I made from a 3 dollar piece of leather from Hobby Lobby. It sounds just fine, plays smooth, and no one is ever going to mistake it for theirs.   The 2nd trumpet is an old Conn 18B that was broken, and the shop wouldn't repair it. Since it was officially junk, I had nothing to lose in playing around with it. If nothing else, I could work on my soldering.  I looked up measurements on forums about converting a Bb to a C. Then I torched to whole thing apart, cut tubing off the bell stem, leadpipe, all the slides, you name it. Soldered it all back together, and applied several coats of Birchwood Brass Black then lacquer to get the color you see. As an added bonus, the trumpet actually plays pretty well in tune. Good enough for free, at least.   I hope you like the pics. Long time lurker."
trumpet,36bu6x,dsr0057,3,Mon May 18 03:11:53 2015 UTC,"The pink/copper/orange coloration you got is a chemical reaction of the calcium in CLR and the zinc in the brass. It's not harmful and most times it occurs when there is the presence of a ferrous metal. Most times I see it when I clean horns we buff it away since I've never known someone to actually like the discoloration. I loved the finish on the C trumpet, did you notice a drastic change in tone since you added so many coats of a non resonant material?"
trumpet,36bu6x,ScreamerA440,1 point,Mon May 18 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"Not a huge difference in sound. The tr300 was a little more open when it was raw, but not unlike it was when it was stock.  I just use it for lessons mostly, so it will do alright.  If I ever get another trumpet, I will probably go full raw brass.  It's such a good feel.    For the color, I just wanted something unique, a bit different.  I like rose colors anyway, so it was a nice surprise."

trumpet,36bu6x,LeeMorgan,2,Mon May 18 11:46:22 2015 UTC,What's the best way to remove finish on an old trumpet? I have a 60+ year old beater that I would love to make raw or some other color
trumpet,36bu6x,Yeargdribble,3,Mon May 18 06:26:10 2015 UTC,"It's really caustic, but on some of these old horns the only thing that really works is boiled lye, particularly on old Conns the lacquer is really baked on hard, this is the best way I've found to remove it."
trumpet,36bu6x,Yeargdribble,2,Mon May 18 16:50:34 2015 UTC,"The best way is debatable, but here is what I did.   Commercial gel stripper, like Zip Strip, works pretty well. You need lots of ventilation, and gloves, because it removes skin pretty efficiently, as well. The 3M Safe Strip really did not work well for me, but maybe on a horn where the lacquer was already worn.   Acetone works well supposedly, but getting a gallon of it is not as cheap as other options. Since it's not a paste, you have to soak it, and that's going to take a fair bit of liquid. I suppose you could brush and rub it with a cloth, but I'm not sure if that would be effective or not.   The biggest problem with stripping horns in my experience, is the brand. King and Yamaha are absolute beasts to remove all the lacquer. What's worse than nothing, is that parts of the lacquer come off all right, but a few areas just defy all chemicals so you have these stubborn patches. This is where an acetone bath would probably work, but I'm cheap. If I were going to strip a very nice horn, I would just suck it up and spend the money to do it well.   Lastly, and I know I'm going to get comments about this, is 400 grit sandpaper. Here's my thoughts. I KNOW that removing brass will alter the sound, and I would NEVER do that to a quality instrument. However, I don't feel any remorse rubbing down an old student line horn. Another thing to consider is that there is a layer of lacquer, so in theory, if you don't go nuts, and pay close attention, you won't remove much more than the lacquer. The color changes when you get through it, and you can usually see a line where one meets the other. Another neat idea is just scuffing the lacquer with the sandpaper but not going through it, and you get a brushed look that doesn't fade.   Finally, you can sand blast it with baking soda. I haven't done it, but it is supposed to be very good for getting in tight spaces and not damaging the metal. Your milage may vary.   Best of luck."
trumpet,36bu6x,Yeargdribble,2,Mon May 18 13:53:15 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'll have to experiment with that.
trumpet,36bu6x,Yeargdribble,2,Mon May 18 14:31:55 2015 UTC,"Have you tried liver of sulfur?  It's definitely worth a try on both silver and raw brass.  It comes out a little more black and less brown than the C you did.  Depending on how you treat it, you can actually get a pretty rainbow effect (think gasoline in a puddle of water).  The chemical reaction is faster or slower based on the heat of the water, so with mildly hot water, you can really control just how the finish comes out, and you could even draw on designs with a q-tip and some very hot water and LoS solution.  On raw brass it gives it a very deep, dark patina.  So if you end up with any other beaters you want to play with, I'd recommend it."
trumpet,36bu6x,Bily_Mays,1 point,Mon May 18 08:06:15 2015 UTC,"You know, I actually tried that first.  I bought some stable gel paste that was supposed to work well, but for the life of me I couldn't get it to work.  Tried twice.  Im going to assume it was user error, not a bad product, but still.   That, and my house smelled like egg farts for two days."
trumpet,36bu6x,Bily_Mays,2,Mon May 18 11:50:48 2015 UTC,"I definitely used a very large portion of LoS, and I made sure my water was very hot (just under boiling).  Some of my early trials with medium hot water and moderate amounts just didn't do much other than turn it a very subtle goldish/brownish/silverish color.  Larger amounts of the LoS and very hot water and it'll almost snap to black as soon as it touches.  I've also found that if it's full on boiling, and you let it sit for a while, you can get an interesting almost matte dark grey.  I'm seriously not sure what's up with that.  Also, it's all reversable using either baking soda and aluminum or the legit stuff made for that purpose (the pink stuff)."
trumpet,36a2bo,wimpyarms,2,Sun May 17 17:31:14 2015 UTC,"Think of your finger fatigue like arm muscle fatigue after a workout.  You can push it a little bit, but not too much.  There is a point where you will just be doing damage.  If you start to feel fatigue, maybe take a small rest like 5 minutes.  If you come back and your fingers are still fatigued, just call it for the day.  I would also suggest possibly looking into a wrist brace if your hand moves a lot.  The last thing you want is to damage the nerves in your wrist, because that can be a bitch.  You could look into changing your technique if your fingers are having endurance problems until they can last longer, but my guess would be some added support like a brace would work great.  You can buy a brace pretty cheap and return it if it doesn't feel right while playing."
trumpet,36a2bo,pumadude321,1 point,Sun May 17 19:25:36 2015 UTC,"Those small muscles in your wrist don't like to be worked for long bursts. If you are encountering tension (not just a little fatigue, but an increase in tension) then consider your grip and see if it is ergonomic, make sure you're using the right oil, make sure your springs aren't too heavy/light, and then also consider doing more short technique sessions with breaks in between. Something like 15 minutes on 15 minutes off might give your wrist the rest it needs until you've done enough repetitions that it no longer takes as much effort.  I'd have to see you play though. I've never had any ""finger fatigue"" that couldn't be cleared up with a walk around the block. For this reason, I suspect you're doing something wonky with your right hand."

The tone on it is wonderful, especially in the mid and low register. Once you get above G in the staff, it starts to resist you a bit which makes it a little harder to go higher.   Overall it's a great piece, but I only use it for orchestral and concert ensembles. I use a more shallow piece for anything jazz or marching."

It does t need to be anything precise, just very small, light buzzing to get your lips to respond. Do the same thing on the horn. Play almost painfully quiet, but DO NOT pinch or use less air. Keep your air moving and do air attacks on pitches. Also, chill. Chill."

He's a nut, these exercises feel nutty, but don't let that get in the way of taking them seriously.  I think you'll find that after following the exercises, the next time you put your horn to your face you be amazed at how much more air you're moving and how much more in control you feel of your sound.

If you have bigger lips you'll probably like the 3C because it's bigger than the Schilke piece.  Personally, I use a Marcikiewicz 1.5 Bobby Shew for big band and marching band, and a Stork Vacchiano 3C for orchestral ensembles. The Stork piece is significantly bigger than the Marcinkiewicz."
trumpet,3649u5,CSNX,1 point,Sat May 16 01:02:06 2015 UTC,"Stop using your 14a4a.   How did you happen to start using the Schilke? Do you have a private teacher? I'd look around for one. A teacher will be able to look and listen as you play and give you productive feed back. If you feel weak on the Schilke, stop using it. If your sound sounds thin, stop using it. It won't matter if you can play the 1st part notes if they don't sound good, people want to hear good sound. So focus on the 3C and make your sound as good as it can be. Higher notes will come later."

trumpet,3649u5,CSNX,2,Sat May 16 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"I'm always kind of skeptical about school band directors suggesting/requiring certain mouthpieces. Every player is different so the right mouthpiece for the director will probably be different than the right mouthpiece for you, which will probably be different than the right mouthpiece for the guy sitting next to you.  Play on whatever mouthpiece feels the best and gets you a good sound. Don't worry about range, that'll come with practice, not using a different mouthpiece."

trumpet,3649u5,CSNX,1 point,Sat May 16 15:05:50 2015 UTC,"Your band director is a trumpet player then? I too am skeptical- that mouth piece is extremely shallow, so if your lips have any meat on them at all you'll bottom out a lot. The shallowness also makes for a shrill, thin sound, and to want/have your entire concert band trumpet section putting out that tone quality is dubious to me. But as musikman95 said, every person is different, so if you and the rest of your section actually do sound good on that size then go for it."

trumpet,360fuv,Perpherion,2,Fri May 15 08:15:28 2015 UTC,"It's a one-valved soprano bugle. It's in the key of G, meaning that the ""C"" it plays sounds like a ""G"" on the piano. The single valve puts it in the key of D,  an interval of a fourth below the key of G (like holding down the first and third valves on a Bb trumpet). This particular horn is a Getzen, the model is Elkhorn. IIRC, Elkhorn was their ""cheaper"" line of horns.  I'm guessing this one is from the 80s. If anyone wants to try and track it down the serial is B7253. These were used in old school dci before they were replaced by ones with three valves."

trumpet,35zttp,Massive_bhuna,6,Thu May 14 22:08:03 2015 UTC,"My picc  Getzen 940S Eterna.  This one actually came to me from a band director who found it in his inventory when I was in college.  He just told me to take it because he said it would otherwise just rot away in a case never getting touched.  It's a bit stuffy if I'm honest, but when I need it, it gets the job done.  I use a 7E for what that's worth.  It's just chilling on a table.  It's usually on a K&M clarinet stand, but my wife jacked it.  My C  B&S 3136 Challenger.  Plays great.  It's the only shiny horn I have because it's the one where that's most likely to matter, so it stays in the case.  Also, it gets played the least, all the more reason it stays in the case.  I usually play it with a 6B.  Horns I actually use daily  Nothing special here.  Bach Strad 180S37 with some years on it.  3CW.    The flugel is some Yamaha thing.  It's another one of those band director telling me to use it because he's got a fleet of them that never get used.  Borrowed it for one theatre gig and he basically told me that he would ""forget"" that he'd lent it to me.  It's not great, but it does the job.  The lack of a 3rd valve-slide trigger is the biggest problem.  It's also not as dark as I like, but I think if I cared enough to shop for a better mouthpiece, that would solve that problem.  The cornet is a King Tempo that my late grandmother found at some estate sale and gave to me.  It plays okay, but very much like a middle-of-the-road horn.  While I like the tone for certain things (I've played a few things that call specifically for cornet), it just doesn't play as well as I'd like, so it gets the back row.  Honestly, it's mostly just on the stand to help counter balance since the Hercules stands can be a little wobbly with only one horn on them, and when I'm making quick changes, I don't want anything falling over.  Not a trumpet  This is the money maker.  Nord Stage 2 and a Boss RC-300 Loop Station.  The keyboard is amazing, and the looper really lets me do a lot of things that I need more than two hands for.  Additionally, it lets me play in the harmony and bass to a chart live (usually while my wife covers the head) and then solo over my own playing on my horns, or the keyboard itself, or something else.    Some trumpets on my wall  Can't remember what they all are off the top of my head.  The one on the top is a Conn Wonder 10A.  It has a pretty unique sound somewhere between a cornet and trumpet.  It plays okay, but needs a little work that I just don't have a reason to deal with.  These are also some things from my late grandmother's estate sale hunting.  I just put them on the wall because I have no reason to play them and I like the way they look.  Part of my living room  More mostly random estate crap mostly.  The clarinet is a mish-mash of parts my wife gathered when a band director was throwing out about 20+ broken clarinets.  It's a combination of different horns that make one full working Normandy I believe.  The horn is a door stop that cannot be salvaged that I grabbed for decoration.    One of two accordions  Once again... grandmother.  I've actually been paid to play it a few times and I'll probably start breaking it out more in the future for specifics gigs that it's useful for.  It's a tuba  I dunno... it's on my wall.  Sometimes I need a tuba handy (like if my wife and I want to make a tuba/flute duet of Nyan Cat... hypothetically of course... ... ...)  The workhorse  It's a Casio Privia PX-130.  A decent board in its price range (though these day's I'd recommend a Yamaha P-105 to people).  it was the first passable instrument I got about 5-6 years ago when I started to get serious about piano.  Obviously, I've upgraded since then, but it's great, especially if I'm trying to pick something out quickly in my office.   Other stuff  An Epiphone Dot which is good enough for my very hack level playing skills.  Good for taking solos over a lot of standards, or looping in some rhythm guitar over some heavy rock-type tunes.  Also, the melodica there is fantastic for some standards like Autumn Leaves.  It's amazing how expressive such an instrument can be.  It's fun as hell to solo on.  The other guitar  And the Martin acoustic electric which is great for plenty of other stuff from the country stuff to the folky stuff.  Now if I just went over the organs (yes... s) and all of my wife's slew of crap..."

Jacob Winter Wood Cases, both the regular and the Prestige series, attractive and they're really protective. The Bauhaus-Walstein  hard cases are really nice also, room for a standard orchestra folder and about four maybe five mutes can fit in it, rather rugged you probably won't destroy it unless you run over it with a car If you plan on running your case over with a car the only real option is the Torpedo Classic, literally, they ran it over with a car, super protective, if you get the Loredo Leather even more protection, and it's leather, not running your horn over with a car? Get the Outlaw still gonna protect your horn better than some hard cases and weighs three pounds, still want leather, comes in Loredo also. There's the chuckwalla for a full complement of mutes, and a standard orchestra folder, fits an Arbans too, and the sidewinder suit bag. More than one horn? The Coyote 2.5 is in my opinion the best double on the market, also comes in Loredo, it's fully modular, and has a bunch of different lids for carrying laptops, music, and such to gigs.   Now, if it sounds like I'm getting paid to plug the Torpedo bags, I promise I'm not, I just think everyone should have one of these bags, they're light, sturdy, and more protective  than anything else on the market, also their customer service is second to none, if something breaks before its time, they'll replace it for free, these are simply the best bags on the market."

We have all the practical bases covered with our cases, but sometimes you want to splurge a bit and get something nicer looking.  It's like a car.  Yes that Honda Civic has 4 wheels, an engine, and a seat belt, but sometimes you want to pay a little more for a better experience and get the Mercedes instead.  I have seen a few custom made cases at shows and conferences, but I don't know of any that actually sell them.  Jupiter's XO case is about the best I've seen there, faux leather with a brass marker, and a black velvety interior.  It's ruined by the backpack straps though...  I've often considered custom making a few and selling them, but I don't have any way to form a foam insert, nor do I have the tailoring skills for the inside.

Pretty, fancy, oiled leather, etc. is not the type of case you want to expose to that level of wear and tear.  I like a nice looking case, but if you're using it much, it won't stay nice for long.  I was really tempted to go with leather when I got my torpedo, but I've seen how they look after use.  Plenty of people make fancy cases and I know guys that have them.  I love the look of the leather Reunion Blues single horn case, but it's extremely impractical.  I guess if you play very casually, never need mutes, and don't need any protection, it's great.  But how many people playing seriously are in that position?    TL;DR - If you play enough to warrant a fancy case, you'll get a practical one.  If don't play enough to warrant a fancy case, you probably won't care enough to drop that much money on a beautiful, but impractical one.

If you have the opportunity, you should experiment with neighboring sizes (3C, 7C) and see if one of those feels easier or more natural."
trumpet,35walw,maestro2005,1 point,Thu May 14 01:23:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm mouthpieces are a very tricky thing. People starting out or picking the horn up after years are safe with smaller mouthpieces. I feel that as you progress you should play on bigger mouthpieces depending on what you want it to do. it worked for me, but might not work for everyone. I started out on a 7c, then progressively played on bigger mouthpieces until I settled on a 16c4 (1 1/2c basically).   If you feel that the mouthpiece isn't feeling as good, I'd suggest fighting through it, then decide much later if you want to switch. Even the pros have their trouble moments with long term mouthpieces sometimes.   Edit: also remember that company sizes are not consistent. If you really must know the exact size, look for the metric measurements if they are available. Bach 3c is much different than warburton 3c, which is still different than ""X company"" 3c mouthpiece"

It's a habit I would describe as ""not ideal"" but not necessarily ""bad"".  It's also not that hard to fix later on.  The problem is that if you're shifting your embouchure for extreme ranges, it makes it hard/impossible to quickly switch registers.  Like if you had a section of music that suddenly jumped from the mid range to a high D, you wouldn't have the time to shift."

trumpet,35w47x,jaylward,1 point,Sat May 16 04:53:38 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion? Do you have to take a few breaths and reset your chops and mouthpiece? Or can you switch the chop change seamlessly so it sounds like you are going up to the high c/d continuously?   Ideally? Yea.  One embouchure is better.  But you know what? I've played a few gigs where by the end of it, I'm tired. It's hard to play.  When I player higher, I kinda do a maynard embouchure and unfurl my lips. Usually I can do that seamlessly while I ascend higher but at the end of the gig? I usually have to unfurl around g on top of the staffed opposed to around high C/D.  On camera/audio, you can't tell that I had to roll my lips out. You hear what's played. So my personal opinion, work on one embouchure. Learn how to play ""when you're tired"". We can all pop out high notes when we're fresh but the trick is to know how to safely do if, when you're tired. It would take a personal one on one one to see/hear how you play, but I'd recommend still practicing and maybe later on you'll find that you won't need to move he mouthpiece down.   Oh! Also another factor, do you play tense or relaxed while playing the high c/ds??  I bet a lot of the problem with how you have to shift your mouthpiece has to do with how you direct your air.   Just my two cents.  I still make an embouchure change through unfurling and tilting my head at different angles depending if I'm playing extremely low, or extremely high.  I'm still learning just like you!"

trumpet,35weoa,the_rocket_surgeon,2,Thu May 14 02:58:52 2015 UTC,"Since you missed out on the chance to practice more in general (which is the best way to deal with this), I'd say this:  Get as much rest as you can, and if possible, pace yourself until the big Ray Charles tune (....and pace yourself even then)  Also, play no more than 80% of your full volume.  Recklessly blasting away is another sure-fire way to blow your chops out quickly.   Good luck."
trumpet,35weoa,WhatTheFlyinFudge,2,Thu May 14 02:47:24 2015 UTC,"Get up early, warm up before you go to school very slowly, don't even get up above a G above the staff. Take an aspirin before you go to bed tonight and about 30 minutes to an hour before you play. Take 15 minutes to warm up before the concert and rest as much as you play during your warm up. If you don't need to go crazy at the concert, don't. Eat light tomorrow, but don't starve. Treat trumpet playing like weight lifting. Reduce swelling as much as possible, stretch before the big day. Biggest advice is to rest as much as possible during the school day. Play it all down. Don't force. Don't strain. Remember, when your chops are dying, let the air do the work."
trumpet,35weoa,Nealium420,2,Thu May 14 02:51:17 2015 UTC,"It's good to find any way you can possibly rest.  This is especially easy in an oversized concert band.  Listen and look for parts that are unison with the section and lay out.  Also possible in jazz band.  You can lay out in any part with full section unison.  This is a pretty normal thing to do in the context of a very long and taxing set.  If I look at the rep for a particular concert and realize that endurance will be an issue, you bet I'll find every opportunity to not play (if it's appropriate).  I guess this might not help much since you're doing this tomorrow.  This technique only really works if you have rehearsal time to double check that laying out is alright or coordinate things with other players.  You don't just wanna stop playing out of nowhere on the concert.  Hopefully this helps you for the future.  For the short term, take it as easy on your chops as possible.  There's little you can do with this little prep time to improve endurance.  Just make sure your body is in okay shape (sleep, stay hydrated, eat well)."

What helped me, and I still lost my chops at the time, and this will be no help now, was to make sure I run the pieces within the same ish time constraints as the concert. Made it far into Jazz band but the last song took me out. I also conducted a piece I wrote so that was a nice break during the hard stuff.  Edit: did that for a week srriaght, twice a day"

trumpet,35t30l,Finnball,2,Wed May 13 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest getting your hands on a mouthpiece and practice getting a good buzz sound. This is fundamental to the rest of your playing. As far as online resources, the YouTuber Charlie Porter has some video tutorials etc. that could be useful. If you find that you're still enjoying it, try to get yourself a teacher. It will be much easier to remain motivated and it will aid your development and reduce problems (e.g. embouchure) in the long run. Most importantly - Stick with it. Starting at 19, you'll have a lot of distractions. It's a very rewarding instrument to play."

That being said, get an arban's book, and Clarke technical studies. While technical studies are great and all, get some music too. After all, that is why you're playing the trumpet. To play music. So, if jazz is your thing, get a real-book and play some tunes out of that. If not, figure out some tunes that you like and play those.   Just another thing that is often overlooked. Learn as much as you can about the trumpet. As in, check out its history and start listening to trumpet players and see what you like.   Good luck!"

trumpet,35o1ka,DXLVXR,3,Tue May 12 01:58:16 2015 UTC,I would totally suggest getting one. They open up so many opportunities to get chop time in that you just don't get playing without one. They do let you know when you are dipping your air stream which is helpful but at the cost of driving your pitch sharp. I haven't found one that doesn't though some are way better than others.  I would suggest a Yamaha silent brass or stone lined Manny Kline practice mute. I use both and love them. I have heard good things about brass spa practice mutes and best brass practice mutes but never tried them.  All that being said it is important to balance your practice mute playing with regular playing so you don't get into bad habits that revolve around you compensating for the practice mute's added back pressure. Hope this helps.
trumpet,35o1ka,shallow_ender27,3,Tue May 12 02:36:04 2015 UTC,"If you can reasonably get away with never using one, I'd suggest doing exactly that... never using one.  The back pressure is going to make you tired, change the feel and pitch of things, stop you from being able to hear and focus on your tone, and hasten the development of bad habits.  The only time I use one is if I'm in a situation where I have to sit cold for a very long time before and entrance.  I'll use it during a loud section shortly before my next entrance to sort of re-warm my lips a tiny bit."
trumpet,35o1ka,Yeargdribble,3,Tue May 12 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"I had the Yamaha Silent Brass system until recently when my house got broken into. By some stroke of pure luck, the crackheads took my silencer, but not the two trumpets that were sitting underneath it, lol.   Anyway, I used it quite extensively when I was in an apartment with a 'no musical instruments' rule, but outside of that period it was mostly a novelty item.  If you are actually bothering your neighbours, then it is worth looking at. If not, don't bother."
trumpet,35o1ka,causeicantoo,3,Tue May 12 11:28:42 2015 UTC,"The best comment on practice mutes I heard from an old teacher is ""it's like practicing singing in earplugs.""  Sure, you can play quietly, but nothing you are actually trying to achieve with a practice session is achievable with a practice mute, and some things are actually going to be made worse.  I have a Yamaha Silent Brass and it's the best practice mute I've ever used, but I only use it to run my horn through effects on the iPad for fun, I don't actually practice on it."
trumpet,35o1ka,Subduction,4,Tue May 12 13:58:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, they change the way the horn feels and it will change the way you play after just a few days. Arturo Sandoval hates them"
trumpet,35o1ka,yalokinh,1 point,Tue May 12 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"The issue with most practice mutes is that the intonation isn't consistent throughout the range of the mute, and sometimes you'll feel like there's more pressure in the upper or lower ranges. You really shouldn't ""practice"" with them, but if you want a good quality mute that will merely make the sound quieter and not distort pitch, I recommend the Bremmer SshhMute or the latest model of Yamaha's Silent Brass System.  As for the first part of your post, I can't really comment. There may be tangible data out there regarding changes in air pressure, but that sounds like speculation to me. Personally I think if you're going to practice something you treat it like a performance. Use the practice mute when you don't want to bug your neighbors, but play at least as much with out it."
trumpet,35o1ka,themanoctave,1 point,Tue May 12 02:39:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt use a practice mute for the reasons you listed.  I love mine and use it frequently, but only for a couple quick blows before going on stage.   They aren't great (comfortable) to play on for a long period of time, they have a little less added resistance than a harmon mute, but more than a straight mute or cup mute."

trumpet,35nxax,Bbinfifthposition,3,Tue May 12 01:22:27 2015 UTC,"OP, are you a brass player?  For those reading this who don't know, Jacobs' teaching style in a nutshell is ""While you're playing, keep your mind focused on the sound you want to be making. That sound is your goal. Don't worry too much about your technique. Technique will develop properly as long as you're trying to make your best sound.""  I think this advice can be helpful, but only under certain conditions. This is a topic that hits home for me because I followed that advice and ended up in serious trouble. It didn't work for me because I wasn't meeting the implied conditions.  Before a player is ready for Jacobs' advice, he needs to know how to take care of his chops. He needs to know that if he expects to sound good for more than 5 minutes a day, his embouchure is going to require maintenance. Every day, brass players need to put in several minutes, if not hours, of very basic, repetitive, low-impact drills to constantly remind the muscles of the embouchure how to vibrate in a focused and balanced position. Otherwise, it's impossible to be in shape.  Not only does a kid need to know what exercises to play, he needs to know how to do them. For example, everyone knows Clarke studies are good for you, but I can easily find a kid who practices Clarke studies and gets nothing out of it because he's missing the point of how to do it. I was that kid.  Kids need to understand that these exercises provide no instant gratification, but when done every day, they have calisthenic value for the chops that you can't get from full, expressive playing. Jacobs' style of playing is great as long as your chops are fortified from calisthenic practice. Otherwise you're just going to beat the crap out of your embouchure, no matter how inspired you are.  That's why I think you heard his teaching was tailored mostly to adults. It's because he doesn't really emphasize the basic stuff that kids need to hear.  Interestingly, there is a school of thought that is exactly the opposite of the approach you're taking. It's called Alexander Technique. You're saying you would rather focus on the product, which is the sound your students make, rather than the means whereby they're making those sounds. According to this school of thought, and my experience, not to mention decades of scientific research, this is how people get injured. Athletes, musicians, dancers, any person performing an activity that requires refined use of the body needs to be acutely aware of how they're using their body from day 1.  If you put a high school pitcher on the field and tell him ""your goal is to throw the ball as hard as you can. Doesn't matter how you do it. You just gotta picture if moving 100 mph and you'll be fine."" He's going to injure his shoulder before the season even starts. He needs to work on stretching, getting his shoulder stronger, and whatever baseball players do. In the process, if he needs to throw pitches at 20mph in order to maintain good form, so be it.  Same goes for swimmers. A swimmer's goal shouldn't be speed. It should be form. If he perfects the use of his body, he will get stronger. Better performance will come about as a result of that strength. This is what yoga is about. And dance. And singing.   I think you see my point here. Focusing on your product is good, but you should only do it on the condition that you've spent adequate time focusing on how to use your body in a way that is scientifically healthy.  I recommend you read about Alexander Technique. It has changed a lot of peoples' lives. Here is one of my favorite excerpts from ""Indirect Procedures: A Musician's Guide to the Alexander Technique"" by Pedro de Alcantara."
trumpet,35nxax,HalfDiminished7,2,Tue May 12 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"Do not forget that Jacobs was an amateur anatomist. He was excellent at describing the use of the breath. I don't know why /u/Bbinfifthposition is against breathing gym: That was half of his pedagogy (Song AND Wind).  I use some Jacobs techniques with my young students, mostly things like understanding their breath and how it interacts with the trumpet. As they age or when they need to get out of their own heads I introduce more advanced concepts. Frankly, I think you're both a little off-base. Jacobs had to have perfect form, he was operating on imperfect equipment (his shitty lungs)."
trumpet,35nxax,ScreamerA440,1 point,Tue May 12 07:53:49 2015 UTC,"So what about ""Breath like a baby, play like an angel."" The point of him learning about anatomy was, (I think) to point out the amount of stuff we can't really control about our breathing. I hear people talk all day about using their diaphragm although it's involuntary. ""Breath to expand, don't expand to breath."""
trumpet,35nxax,ScreamerA440,1 point,Wed May 13 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"He also talked about 75/25 breathing and the similarities in embouchures at certain octaves regardless of instrument. When he talked about respiration he also talked about which muscles we can control, especially when we exhale  Ninja edit: this is all part of the larger discussion about him: he did cover the physical aspects of brass playing. Exhaustively. He even said he would spend entire lessons on breathing with new students."
trumpet,35nxax,TootTootTootToot,1 point,Wed May 13 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"You lost me by the second sentence... The Breathing Gym is heavily informed by the teachings of Arnold Jacobs - including a focus on results (healthy, flowing, musical air). They never talk about how you're breathing (as in specific muscles) but instead connect the air to a goal (as simple as good flow or as advanced as a specific dynamic or tune). They also use the ""hand monitor"" so you can gauge your breathing externally rather than internally, again focusing on products over process. I would highly recommend the Daily Workouts DVD for group settings at any level of ability.  I think you are interpreting Jacobs a little narrowly - remember the pedagogy is often referred to as Song and WIND. It's crucial to have a healthy sound concept but it's also important to be a great breather.  This pedagogy is great for any level, including beginners. It's all about good tone and good musicality. Of course good air = good tone. Also, with beginners it's essential to build their sound concept - they usually have absolutely no idea what good tone is or how to hear it in their own playing. That means they need to do a ton of listening, preferably live (modeling on their instrument and having them play back) but recordings are also important.  Best of luck!"
trumpet,35nxax,ScreamerA440,1 point,Tue May 12 13:53:46 2015 UTC,If you're not going to protect them from their own bad habits then what's the point of teaching them at all?

trumpet,35mw7n,someday_believers,4,Mon May 11 20:31:37 2015 UTC,"I personally think the Rubank books are some of the best quick-start books for people who are learning a secondary instrument.  It introduces stuff in a nice step-by-step fashion, but it is a little brisk.  They definitely don't hold your hand at all, but there are also no frills and a lot of meat.  People love to say Arban, but as much as it is a staple of trumpet, it's a horribly laid out book that doesn't explain much.  If you don't have a teacher to show you how to use it, it's pretty much a terrible book.  And honestly, for every section of Arban that focuses on something, there are books that do it better.  This is especially true with the lip slurs section.  Most people recommending it aren't thinking pedagogically about it.  They forget that someone probably showed them how to practice from it and that that information isn't going to be intuitive to someone just picking it up.  Either way, I'd highly recommend getting lessons because brass (especially high brass) is very different and in pretty much every way more demanding than woodwinds.  This isn't me trying to be some jackass about instrumental superiority, it's just the way the horns work.  I really like Yamahas for their consistency even into their lower tier models.  People are probably gonna tell you go go used and it's really a good idea.  Everyone has their favorites for beginners and I'm sure you'll hear of more of them.  You'll probably be safe with any of them.  There are plenty of horns that are good, so a more useful think to know is what to avoid.  I think Jupiter makes terrible beginner and intermediate brass.  But mostly just stay away from any cheap Chinese knockoff types.  Many shops won't service them because they are crap."
trumpet,35mw7n,Yeargdribble,1 point,Mon May 11 21:29:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips!  I may consider getting lessons once I can afford them :p And I definitely get what you mean about being more demanding. I bet almost every instrument is more work than the saxophone. I learned the flute last year and I was surprised at much air I needed.
trumpet,35mw7n,NotAlwaysPolite,2,Tue May 12 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is a standard answer in these parts having only joined the sub a few days ago but a good book to get is a copy of the Arban method (or just Arban). It's not one you'll ever get rid of or finish with either, I stopped playing for quite a few years and it's helping me get back up to speed."
trumpet,35mw7n,duhbell,1 point,Mon May 11 20:54:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are going to swear by the arban book. It's not bad but it's certainly not intuitive.   Everyone also has their favourite brands but you can't go too far wrong with the Yamahas or the Vincent Bachs. Personally I've always loved my Getzen and it's a brand I don't see mentioned too much on here.   As for YouTube channels that offer pointers... consider taking a few lessons instead of learning from YouTube. I came to trumpet after fiddling around with a clarinet and a tenor sax, I tried to teach myself and developed some horrible habits. Did a couple months of lessons and saw a huge improvement in tone and range and it set me up to develop a better overall playing style."

Lots of people love the Bach Strad but for a beginner you don't need one, get a good basic horn now and then buy yourself a shiny new Bach Strad once you've stuck with it.

trumpet,35k7aa,CSNX,3,Mon May 11 13:26:12 2015 UTC,"I've been a Monette client and friend of the shop for many years. I think they do extraordinary work and it's nice to see them get some positive attention around here. But don't be surprised if a few haters come along....   Has anyone out there upgraded from the silver mouthpiece to the Prana line? Did you notice any difference to justify the price point?   I've played Prana mouthpieces for quite a while now. I think they are definitely worth the cost, but only once you have acclimated to your non-Prana mouthpiece and have done some body-use work. Did Dave or anyone at the shop talk to you about body use? (Tension, posture, alignment, etc.) When a player is well-aligned and plays with little to no extraneous tension, Prana mouthpieces can work fantastically well. But players who use excess tension might find them to be a bit unforgiving. They can even amplify negative aspects of your technique.   If you haven't already, check out the info from their website about body use and tension.  The most immediately noticeable aspect to playing Prana mouthpieces is that dynamic changes can be done with very little effort. So, I find that the physical difference between playing soft and playing loud is very slight. That translates to more expressive playing with ease. But it's kind of like driving a Ferrari; if you've never driven one, it might be a bit too much for you to handle right away.  Just my $.02. If you ever want to chat with someone about Monette equipment, I'm always happy to do that. I've known Dave and the whole shop since I was a kid, so I'm very familiar with their work. Enjoy your new mouthpiece!"
trumpet,35k7aa,YCANTUSTFU,3,Tue May 12 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I lurk on this sub a lot more than I comment, and I've noticed a lot of Monette haters.     Dave was off the day I had my tour. Jason helped me out, and he was awesome! He gave me some pointers on posture, alignment, and tension. When I came home I played on my bach mouthpiece, and worked on the things he talked to me about. My bach mouthpiece still didn't quite feel the same as what I tried at the shop, even applying the what was suggested at the shop. I was wondering if it was the incredible horns more than the mouthpiece. I wasn't disappointed when it arrived. I'm still getting to know the equipment, but I'm very impressed so far. I'm also much more aware of when my posture is off, or I'm using too much pressure. I feel like it puts me a little more in the driver's seat than what I was playing on previously.    I'm very happy I stopped in for the visit. If I had just selected a size close to my previous equipment, it may not have worked. Having someone hand me one mouthpiece after the other until I found the one that sounds, and feels good really helped out. The posture, and tension tips helped as well. Like is said, I had no intention of purchasing anything, but after playing the equipment, I didn't want to leave without it.      The owner/ repair tech at the music shop I worked in told me he was Dave Monette's room mate in school. I would have been interested in hearing some stories. I did meet David Monette at ITG in Chicago almost 20 years ago. It was at the end of the day, and Charles schluter was playing in the room after everyone had cleared out. I creeped on them for a while, before they saw me at the door. The rest of my group had come over as well. My teacher came and found us, and was wondering what happened to us, and he was pretty surprised when he realized the principal trumpet of the Boston Symphony, and the Dave Monette were telling us stories, and playing music for us. Dave Monette saw our performance that morning of the Altenberg, and offered us free mouthpieces because he liked us so much. My teacher never followed through, because our band director was a control freak and told him not to. I always thought that was pretty cool though. Incredibly nice gesture. It might have taken me a while, but I finally got my Monette mouthpiece, and I think should have done it much sooner. Now if I can only find an extra $14k around."
trumpet,35k7aa,cyhlalala,1 point,Wed May 13 01:27:18 2015 UTC,"I've always avoided monette as I had an impression that they are usually very dark horns...  When you tried the horns were there any that were bright, like a better version of a bach?"
trumpet,35k7aa,YCANTUSTFU,3,Tue May 12 00:19:08 2015 UTC,"Monette makes a full range of horns in different weights. The impression that all Monettes sound dark is an incorrect hold-over from the days when their new designs were becoming heavier and heavier in comparison to other makes of trumpets.   If you're interested in what Monette offers by way of lightweight ('brighter') horns, check out their LT, XLT, and MF horns. Here's a recent video of a new MF model from their facebook page.  All that being said, I don't think that even their heavier horns are 'dark' sounding, although they do have the ability to sound dark. Heavier horns have a more complex overtone structure, which may sound 'dark' to some people's ears, but that description is an oversimplification of what is actually occurring in the sound."

If you live near the shop, definitely go check it out. Send them an email. They're all very friendly, and very helpful. I have always been curious about Monette equipment, but the visit made the difference. Having assistance to pick out a mouthpiece was much better than taking a shot in the dark and just picking one from a catalog."

But you could be in the same situation as I am, where your teacher focuses on that one player and kind of forgets about everyone else, not seeing your potential (that's a rant for another day). If there's any one thing I've learned from playing is that if you want to improve, you have to challenge your self. There's only so much the basics can give you. An example of this is I wanted to learn how to double tongue. Sure I practice going ta ka ta ka for hours, but I learned more by playing Buglers Holiday. Set goals, like say ''I want to play the Haydn concerto'' then set smaller goals that lead up to it. To rap it up in a nutshell, find a piece you want to play that's challenging, then set goals that'll get you there."

trumpet,35f1lu,tptmeister,5,Sun May 10 01:18:44 2015 UTC,"Do you include lip bends in your fundamentals? I've found for me, bending low C to low G and back, then B to F-sharp, B-flat to f etc.,  helps get my lips to 'feel right'. Nice, easy, slow, low lip bends. Long tones are isometric exercise that will wear out the lip quickly, and lip slurs are also meant for strength building. My teacher has recommended to use a lot of light tonguing (Clarke scales are nice for this).  Your situation usually happens to me with long weeks of cumulative fatigue, or accidentally bumping my lip. Unfortunately these incidents typically require longer periods of rest with zero playing. But since you're recording, you'll just have to do your best with what you have, and be careful and pay attention to what your lip muscles are telling you.  And what the other guys are saying about the frustration: it makes your playing suck! Whenever I get pissed off when hitting a brick wall, I put it down and walk around a bit. Watch some TV. When you come back, you'll be more productive. Hope this helps. We all have to go through this stuff eventually when playing trumpet."

trumpet,35f1lu,_mark_o,4,Sat May 9 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Do you take lessons? If so, mention it to your teacher. If you don't take lessons, get a teacher. Seriously. There comes a time when you reach a plateau and you need someone experienced to sit there with you and help one on one. Instrumentalists, especially the younger and/or amateur players, can do weird things with their playing and not even notice it until someone points it out to to you.   Until a few months ago. My tonguing suddenly went to shit again. Now I can't tongue a note without fuzz.   Sounds like your tongue is interrupting your air stream too much and striking the inside of your lips. (like spitting out a hair that's on your tongue.) Your tongue should be striking the roof of your mouth somewhere between saying the ""tah"" and ""dah"" syllables. Execution of the articulation syllable will change based on playing speed, volume, style etc but it should only interrupt the air stream, not the embouchure.  Also never practice frustrated! Put the horn down or play something else. MUSIC IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN DAMMIT! 😜"
trumpet,35f1lu,Felt_Ninja,3,Sat May 9 22:54:03 2015 UTC,"Your tongue should be striking the roof of your mouth somewhere between saying the ""tah"" and ""dah"" syllables.   Tell me where exactly your tongue is striking the roof of your mouth when you say ""tah"" or ""dah"".  I think saying ""the roof of your mouth"" is a dangerously ambiguous piece of terminology to give to anybody learning to play the instrument.  The fact of the matter is that while some tongue may make contact with the ""roof"" of someone's mouth, the effective area resulting in actual articulation isn't the roof of someone's mouth.  Tongue and air are interrelated concepts, and for someone to have control over what their air is doing, being able to use the tongue as a regulation device is quite a useful skill.  This is what a lot of successful players have done (in all applicable musical genres to trumpet - not just ""high note guys"" like people think), and it's a general given than it's the method that yields the greatest results when applied appropriately to someone's individual face.  So honestly, I have to disagree with the ""tongue at the roof of your mouth"" idea, since it basically doesn't work for anyone, and is a really hazy conception of something to tell someone.  Advice about fundamental issues can not only be stunting, but counterproductive.  If you tongue squarely on the roof of your mouth, I'd gauge ho well it's working for you, before telling somebody this advice, and expecting them to take it as gospel."
trumpet,35f1lu,_mark_o,1 point,Sun May 10 02:55:11 2015 UTC,"I apologize for the proceeding wall of text. Not trying to argue, but to collaborate, learn, and help. 😁   Tell me where exactly your tongue is striking the roof of your mouth when you say ""tah"" or ""dah"".   Your mouth has a hard palate and a soft palate. For me, my students, and other brass playing colleagues, the point of contact for saying ""tah"" is at the front of the hard palate a few millimeters behind the teeth with the tip of your tongue.  I was intentionally not trying to over complicate things because everyone's mouth is slightly different and throwing a wall of advice can be too much for the reader/listener, but saying the word properly will create the desired effect. If you don't over think it, it's hard to mess up the tongue placement of you just say a silent ""tah"" as if you would normally say it on everyday speech.   Tongue and air are interrelated concepts   Please explain. I'm sincerely not trying to start an argument, I'm just curious. I know they can be mutually exclusive in that you can have a good sound without using your tongue. However,  when I start my air stream, I use my tongue. When novice players don't, and use solely air to create a buzz, it's easy to get a fuzzy attack (sounds like phuhh). When you begin with the tongue, the tongue acts like a mini pressure valve and creates just enough pressure to get the air to start moving quicker when you release the tongue.    since it basically doesn't work for anyone   Broad statement aside, it works for me and my students. Maybe some miscommunication here?   Advice about fundamental issues can not only be stunting, but counterproductive.  If you tongue squarely on the roof of your mouth, I'd gauge ho well it's working for you, before telling somebody this advice, and expecting them to take it as gospel.   That's why I suggested to take it up with his teacher who knows more about his playing than I do. As I mentioned before, saying ""tah"" normally won't do anything strange like hitting your soft palate or the top arch of your hard palate. I should have use better wording here and I apologize. You should always take informal, impersonal reddit advice with a grain of salt compared to one-on-one help."

trumpet,359fg3,Firion91,5,Fri May 8 05:24:03 2015 UTC,"Don't pick up the trumpet and assume you can do everything you could do (even if you can). Start with the easy stuff in the lower octaves and do no more than 10/15mins a day in the beginning. Your face muscles will be weak, and most people in this situation will tense up and force things to happen instead of it being a natural progression. If you find yourself tensing up, stop, put down the instrument, come back tomorrow. Most common problems I've seen are closing up the throat and using too much pressure. Restarting after a time off can be a dangerous time for picking up new bad habits, but it can also be a great opportunity to lose the ones you had already picked up. Was there any specific bad habits you had you wanted to lose?  Source: Teacher, and have re-started adults after years of not playing."

trumpet,359fg3,trumpettongo,1 point,Fri May 8 07:44:55 2015 UTC,"Air pressure rather than instrument pressure is something I've only recently started to incorporate it to my own playing so hopefully something I can help with.   Whisper tones will really help with this. Exercise low and quiet playing with a precise single tongue (it can be ease to forget to exercise your tongue after a time away). Start with small chromatic intervals and slowly build up to larger intervals. You'll find the large intervals will 'require' instrument pressure if you jump straight in. Concentrate on the quality of the sound and always make it beautiful! Air pressure doesn't mean a thin air column. Think wide. Put your hand about 10cm from your mouth, blow a warm summer breeze, not a winters gale. Hope some of that will help"

Coming back to the trumpet is a beautiful thing; but it takes time and lots of patience. Help from a teacher is recommended. I would recommend the Arbans and Clarke studies but practice them slow and softly. Also, lead pipe playing is pretty effective and helped me out a lot.

(plenty of good advice above/below me, but you can't possibly follow all of it. What's the point of guessing what to follow, which leads to my next bit of advice...) 2) Find a good teacher. How? Ask someone who plays the way you want to who they studied with. A decent teacher (in-person) can tell you more than anyone can tell you through the internet's tubes. 3) Advice I learned from physical exercise: the best exercise is the one you'll do.

However, I can share my thoughts on my 1967-68 Selmer K-Mod. It is a very very dark, beautiful horn. Dark, mellow, velvet-y. However with the right mouthpiece, it can sing as a lead horn, at least it did for me. I personally love it. The valves are the best I've ever felt and it looks very cool. I personally chose it over a nice playing Bach Strad and a Kanstul model that escapes me."
trumpet,358z5p,aspiringtrumpeter,1 point,Fri May 8 04:05:05 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I would take Bach Strad off of that list.  I'm not a big fan of Bach horns so take that with a grain of salt.  They're not bad horns by any means, but I've found that they're quite inconsistent.  You can absolutely find a really really good one, but you could also find a really crappy one.  I played on an Olds Clark Terry for about 8 years.  Absolutely fantastic horn.  I'm a lead player but also do all sorts of all-around work.  I recently bought a Yamaha 9335NY and it just loves to speak in every register.  Personally, I feel the 9335NY screams better than the 8335LA or 8310Z.  It's just so freaking solid.  I was thinking about selling my Olds Clark Terry, but thought about it and realized it's just too damn cool to let go.  I think there were only something like 300 of them ever made.  I'm gonna send it off to get the valves rebuilt (they leak after 50 years of course) and I think it'll be damned phenomenal again.  I think almost any Olds top-end horn is gonna be real good.  I tried a Conn Constellation while I was trying out horns making my way to the the 9335NY and it was just amazing.  The place I was at was selling it for $1250.  I dunno if it was used or not.  For $1250, that's just about as good as it's ever gonna get.  I've played $3500 horns that were nowhere near as good.  Stomvi makes some really good horns as well.  I tried out a Stomvi Mambo a loonnnggg time ago.  I think I was in high school and unprepared for it at the time.  I played a low C and all my air was just gone almost instantly.  I'd love to try another one some day but can't seem to find them anywhere close.  As a lot of guys will tell you, the horn does help, but the sound is really gonna come from the player.  Louis' sound came from Louis.  Also, TRY BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!!"
trumpet,358z5p,Rabidchiwawa007,2,Fri May 8 04:11:10 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Bach and Yamaha occupy the same echelon of horns.  They're both good horns, and perfectly acceptable at a professional level.  While Bach did have poor quality control for a while, they are much improved these days.  Yamaha, while impeccable with quality control, has never impressed me.  Not all, but many Bach horns sound beautiful and dark, and Yamaha's sound fine, but they rarely reach the fullness and clarity that is characteristic of a good Bach.  Now, with the Olds, Martin Committe, and the Selmer, I'm sure they're fantastic, but I have no experience with them.  However, tl:dr, Bach's are still great horns, especially once again as of late."

Then put the solo back to back so it would loop the solo 4 times total. That way, the free trial version of the app will play the solo one time through."

trumpet,354lno,SirTiger,3,Thu May 7 01:38:35 2015 UTC,"The mouthpiece is going to feel very small and stuffy at first.  As far as the embouchure is concerned, you're basically doing the same thing you do on a tuba mouthpiece except in a quarter of the space (think of playing an upright bass vs a violin).  It's going to take some time and slow steady practice (mouthpiece buzzing/long tones/free buzzing) to focus in on the muscles needed to produce a good sound in that small of a space.  If you're not familiar with free buzzing, consult youtube. It's a great way to improve your strength and lip control for any brass playing.  The biggest hurdle you will probably face is the amount back pressure. On tuba you have a lot of warm air at low air pressure/resistance (like a tank going down the street, unstoppable and broad).  Trumpet air is still a considerable amount of air but at a much higher air pressure inside your oral cavity (like a tiny, fast, souped up street racer). You're not moving the same kind of air as you do with the tuba  because it's coming out at a much higher pressure and speed (think water hose with a big nozzle vs a very small nozzle). Low brass players who pick up the trumpet tend to overblow and get a headache trying to move too much air at once.   My suggestion is to start slow, like stupid slow, and play some long tones to get used to using your air differently.  Don't worry too much about range.  Stick to the low(er) notes on the trumpet like G in the staff (concert F) and lower.  Work on getting a good sound in that range first.  The high stuff will come on it's own.  Hope this helps.   source:brass instructor/part-time band director"

trumpet,354lno,jps98,2,Fri May 8 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"You could try getting a very large mouthpiece, such as a schilke 24 or bach 1. Both of these are relatively inexpensive and could help a lot.

I think the best way to get a good start is to do some back and forth playing with a patient trumpet friend if you have access to one.  I've done this over Skype with some friends before.    You'll need to do some work on your own to get used to the mouthpiece but you should be fine.  The basic concepts are the same.

trumpet,3527si,madmelonxtra,7,Mon May 11 18:00:10 2015 UTC,"To improve your range, you have to get more comfortable playing at the top of your current range.  Spend a lot of time up there while practicing, until you absolutely can't keep playing.  Then take a break and come back a little later and do the same thing. The more time you spend at the top of your range, the more comfortable you'll get playing high and the easier it will be to play higher."
trumpet,3527si,MannschaftPilz,5,Wed May 6 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"While doing that, make sure to practice hitting high notes quietly. You'll find that a lot of that lead stuff doesn't need to be all that loud to carry like crazy, and it'll save you tons of chops and help develop easy, comfortable playing up there."
trumpet,3527si,ColbertNation893,2,Wed May 6 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"This!!!  A lot of lead players play too loud, and while I'd be happy to have brick splitting high notes, you typically don't have to play that loud. I was told before that, (don't let this feed into your ego :]) the other parts are there to make you sound good.  As in, your overtones will be carried over by the rest of the section.  I played Corozon by Kenton on one occasion in a small jazz group where I live, and the opening upper octave section, I well, over did.  Kinda made me laugh on the first video that I saw because it just sounded rude.  Next time we played it, I backed off and was kind of at the point where, ""hey, I can't hear myself extremely clearly, but I can feel hat I'm playing.""  Needless to say, on the next video that was recorded, I blended muuuuuuch better and sounded very in tune.   Anywhos, when you can get the notes out quietly, don't force the notes out during gigs by using ""a lot"" of air. You can back off and you'll be surprised with the results!!"
trumpet,3527si,CatVaginaBackwash,5,Thu May 7 04:17:43 2015 UTC,"I was once told at a DCI camp that ""the only way to get good at playing high and loud is to practice playing high and loud"". I have found this to be very true. However, I would add that as important as it is to be on the top of your range, and equal amount of time should be spent on pedal tones- both true and false pedals."
trumpet,3527si,JayTongue,1 point,Wed May 6 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"What are false and true pedal tones, and how do you play them? It seems nothing I've found could give me a definite answer."
trumpet,3527si,AncientRuler777,1 point,Thu May 7 20:22:26 2015 UTC,"What I THINK he means is that you can, for instance, hit a pedal C on the open horn with the fingering an octave down, but you can also bend the pitchto hit a pedal B, Bb, A, Ab, (insert any other note).  Essentially, play below your horn, and train your lips to accurately produce a note in any register.  If you can do that low, you can do that high."
trumpet,3527si,jaylward,2,Sat May 9 04:25:15 2015 UTC,"Style, accurate reading, good tempo, and intonation is where you really need to excel. Range comes after these.   To improve range, quit over-blowing and over breathing. Without seeing you play, I bet your tanking-up too much air in the wrong area, and you're also messing with yourself mentally.   Mouthpiece:  Get to playing the same rim as you do in a concert setting. Don't swap between a specialty lead-piece and then play a totally different rim in the concert setting. I use a Warburton; I have 3 tops (same diameter and rim) and two backbores. I'm an oddball that likes to play on big backbore in all situations. My lead piece is a 4s/10!  So... find a rim you like and get two pieces based off of it."

I give a damn if my lead player can pop dubbas on command, if he can't swing, count, syncopate, or articulate in the style of the piece we're playing then he's a detriment. If you can get the style correct in that range it will be much less exhausting to play in that range (duh) and your range will develop naturally without you having to destroy your face trying to add a fifth to the top of your register."

I play once or twice a week for around 2 hours at a time, mostly playing lead parts for big band/pop charts. I find if you really relax into the playing and concentrate on low pressure on the mouthpiece and a tighter core you can really start screaming. That technique should help up to around super G or A, don't know about going higher than that. I also find that exploring the upper range quietly at first before putting air through tends to give a better tone, but I know this can depend heavily on the mouthpiece choice."

Plus theyll often have exercises you can play to help you work on the problem and tone and range.

trumpet,34x88e,ScreamerA440,1 point,Mon May 11 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"This is a common problem with people adjusting their pressure. Your embouchure naturally compensates for the sudden reduction in tension by compressing in order to create a buzz. I would experiment very slowly and deliberately (using a piano, tuner, or drone track) with your mouthpiece for 5-10 minutes a day until you get an easy ""ringing"" tone then go to the horn. If you can replicate the feeling of ease and the exact weight, angle, and location of the mouthpiece while you're buzzing and when you're on the horn you'll start to notice a difference and your tone will improve."

I'd hate to see what a raw brass trumpet looks like after some drizzle, rain, humidity, etc.  Gloves would definitely help too - IMO the valve cover for your hand is a must on a raw trumpet.  Mine never went outside and after being played for not quite a year off and on a couple times a week it looked pretty bad until I cleaned it again this past weekend and took those new pics."
trumpet,34uyhd,Hydrargyrum1,2,Mon May 4 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds old. Very old. I don't think b&h has been a freestanding firm since the 50's at the latest (but correct me if I'm wrong.)  $670 sounds fair to high, even if it's in great shape and set up well, AND assuming that's the sound you want. I wouldn't blow that on an unknown trumpet on a hunch.  Google and eBay are your friends for info and valuation.  Don't get me wrong, I love vintage gear, but take your time and do your homework before you blow a wad of money. There will always be another horn. I'd read up and get a few models in mind you'd be interested in, and ideally try several before you pull the trigger.  If you want something older, Conn, Olds, Martin, and Buescher were respectable in their day, and certain models might be found in this price range, especially if they're stencils. (Make sure you're not actually getting a 60's or 70's student horn though; the names kept on after the original corporations bit the dust.) Old Bachs tend to sell high. Old Selmer horns don't seem to be sought after, and might be in contention."
trumpet,34uyhd,reedfriendly,1 point,Tue May 5 04:32:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your in-depth comment. I tried google and ebay for valuation but i got very mixed prices, one website said it was worth 5000 USD another said 650. I'll try it out, see if it works (and comparing it).   I saw there were some Conns and Old in my area, i'll definitely try some of them out.  Thanks again!"
trumpet,34sxew,RedWasatch,2,Mon May 4 08:02:56 2015 UTC,"Generally the ""smiling"" is not ideal.   It causes you to have a tighter buzz that creates a thin sound. Generally you want the corners of your mouth to remain firm, and use your air to manipulate the pitches of the notes."
trumpet,34sxew,theMasterBlasta,3,Mon May 4 10:22:44 2015 UTC,"Firm corners for sure, but I think smiling pulls them up too far for most people. Try saying the letter ""M"" - your corners should be about where a comfortable embouchure will be for you. It is of course pretty impossible to work on this with strangers over the internet."
trumpet,34sxew,ColbertNation893,2,Mon May 4 13:14:39 2015 UTC,"You missed a ""P"" word: Pinned. I don't like to change the location of my corners, I just like to take two push pins and lock them down tight. That, in my opinion, creates a very natural embouchure and gives me a lot of flexibility without creating unnecessary tension."
trumpet,34sxew,ScreamerA440,1 point,Mon May 4 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"This is my embouchure, and it's the basic idea of what you want. Of course, there are things I could always work on, but this is the structure you're ultimately wanting."
trumpet,34sxew,jcpearce,1 point,Mon May 4 12:02:00 2015 UTC,"I would definitely discourage thinking with the term 'pulling' with regard to your embouchure. As others have stated, that gets you into the 'smiling' structure and you don't want that.   I don't really want to say it's pushed though, either. I think of it more as just firming up the corners whilst leaving your lips soft and flexible; I'm almost making a 'duck face', (as much as everyone hates that face, it's very mild). So I guess the firming of the corners slightly pushes your lips out, but be careful that it's not extreme.  I suggest sitting in front of a mirror and messing around with your face muscles, see what your face looks like when you do a certain thing. When you get the ""ideal"" look and structure, add the mouthpiece and then the horn later on."
trumpet,34sxew,CSNX,1 point,Mon May 4 13:42:54 2015 UTC,"Just .... keep ... slightly ... firm...   Pushing, pulling, huh? Just think air down the middle."
trumpet,34sxew,nuvistor,1 point,Wed May 6 08:56:53 2015 UTC,"Corners = my lips at outer edge of my rim. They are firm.   All the ""work"" happens inside the rim.

trumpet,34n6w9,pikapika131,11,Sat May 2 18:15:24 2015 UTC,It was used for marching drum and bugle corps and was made in the USA by olds it looks like. It's actually a 2 valve g bugle  Zig Kanstul would know the most about the horn if you needed information (he worked at the olds factory for a long time) and he now owns his own horn company Kanstul.net to contact him and you should include the serial number and he can probably give you the year of the horn (this may be as simple as a Google search however)  It's probably not worth a whole ton because it is a specialty instrument that is not used anymore but check out eBay and such for old sell prices. I would put it up for a few hundred bucks and would probably take 200 - 300 for it if offered. Be sure that the valves and slides all move freely
trumpet,34n6w9,orchestraltrumpet,5,Sat May 2 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"All said about it being a 2-valve bugle pitched in concert G...  These basically have no resale value, unfortunately.  There's no use for them, o the only people who buys them are vintage drum corps enthusiasts.  Even then, it's a buyer's market, since almost anybody in possession of one of these wants to unload it.  To be perfectly honest, you may make more money wiring it to be a lamp, and selling it as that.  If you don't mind me asking (and believe me, I feel bad asking), how much are they asking for it?"

trumpet,34n6w9,radams68,2,Sun May 3 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"I played a 2 valve horn with the Caballeros in 1988. The whole 2 valve thing never made any sense to me. Either don't give it valves and have a bugle, or put on 3 valves and have a chromatic instrument. I don't get why just one or two ever made any sense. I did quickly realize that if you lock down your trumpet 3rd valve with a rubber band, it plays exactly the same."
trumpet,34n6w9,radams68,1 point,Sun May 3 03:46:51 2015 UTC,What songs did you play with it? Is the fingering the same as a trumpet but with a lack of any notes with the third valve?

Yes, it plays just like a trumpet, but if you need the 3rd valve to play it, this horn can't do it. Again, just lock down your 3rd valve, and only use the 1st 2.

They have like 2-3 new music concerts at the conference every year and there's very often one or two excellent pieces on each. I believe you can find recordings of each through ITG or even on youtube if you dig deep enough.  If you want to reach back a bit further you could look at the Ewazen Sonata, Pakhumatova Concerto (Arutunian Lite, very passionate), Dello Joio Sonata (so very, very on the face), Stanley Friedman ""Solus"" is a clever avant garde piece.  ninja edit: Oh!

You use things you're familiar with, stringing together words, and eventually sentences.  Soon you may be able to be a great orator like Ralph Waldo Emerson, or Martin Luther King Jr. (or a great improvisor, like Charlie Parker, or Clifford Brown, or Marshall Gilkes.)

Next, since it's jazz, you can use accidentals and not feel too bad about it. Just be careful, because too many will massacre the sound. They should be used scarcely, and should be well placed. If you're not used to improving, try to stay on key. Don't overthink it either. Let the notes happen. Improv by definition is free form, so have some fun and relax.

trumpet,34ktrt,Jafrankman,5,Sat May 2 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"I do.  I used to use it as a gag instrument on ska shows about 10 years ago.  The trombone player had a valve trombone too, and I had this thing, so for  couple tunes, we'd swap our horns out - he'd play valve trombone, and I'd play slide trumpet.  It confused the audience.  They play okay, though.  From a design standpoint, its a little harder to screw up the layout of a trombone versus, for instance, a french horn.  So long as the slide works, and the mouthpiece fits in the receiver, you're pretty much good to go.  I had to work on my receiver a bit, but the slide is definitely passable.  If you're looking for a better one, it's obviously going to cost more money.  Unless you're awesome at playing the thing, that be a waste.  Jupiter's slide trumpet costs a little more, and is about the same build quality, but the Miraphone version of the instrument is generally made a little better.  You can find some old Getzen slide trumpets floating around on eBay once in a while, but I couldn't tell you much about them.  There have been other makers, too, but information is sparse at best about their slide trumpets.  Wycliffe Gordon uses a prototype slide trumpet by Yamaha, which by all accounts of seeing him play the thing, is basically constructed flawlessly.  It doesn't hurt that he's one of the 3 or 4 guys on Earth who can play the thing well, though.  If case you haven't done some listening to it, check out Wycliffe Gordon, Steven Bernstein, and that one really old Chuck Findley clip where he plays one.  There's also a handful of recorded Moravian trombone choir music featuring the slide trumpet (which we can also call a soprano trombone, to be fancy)."

trumpet,34iggx,toxroxmysox,6,Fri May 1 12:55:51 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of subtle things involved.  I've played some vaguely mariachi style stuff (mostly in musical theatre stuff for a single number, though I have joined in with an actual mariachi group and end up playing venues with them frequently).  Even then, it's a funny thing.  I went to a clinic and the guy was explaining some more nuanced mariachi stuff and so much of what I thought was the way to do it was what he called ""white people mariachi.""  I felt so ashamed of myself as he explained how it was really done.  Most of it boils down to articulation differences.  That's where the real detail of it happens.  It's a lot like swing in that most people do it wrong and think they are doing it right.  So in swing most people put the accent on the downbeat... DOO-bah DOO-bah DOO-bah, when it should be be doo-BAH doo-BAH doo-BAH.  (The whole swing thing and the varieties and subtleties there is a whole other rabbit hole).  Similarly, people make mistakes like that with mariachi, and I'm one of them.  Since I don't play in that style frequently enough, I can't really expound on them.  I think the most signature thing if you want to fake it though is tone and vibrato.  It tends to be much faster, more pronounced vibrato.  Dedicated mariachis are likely to play on lighter horns, but you can really pull almost any sound out of any middle of the road horn.  So much more of it is coming from you than the equipment... equipment just helps facilitate.  If you really want to play any style well, nothing will help you do so as much as listening, so I'd recommend if you want to play in that style, do a lot of listening and pay special attention to articulation most of all (which is true for most styles), and also tone stuff.  Sorry, wish I could be more specifically helpful."
trumpet,34iggx,Yeargdribble,1 point,Fri May 1 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, there are also a few explanation videos of mariachi style.  One I like, because it's accessibly in English (for those whose Espanol es mierda), and because it's spelled out nicely throughout the 10 minutes is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmHMDIH-X0c  I did a gig for Telemundo a few months back, and aside from us in the ""house band"" for the show, there was a great mariachi group from Miami they used.  A few of us realized how piss-poor we are at playing mariachi music - myself included.  People downplay mariachi musicians way too much.  The violin players were all blasting through Czardas in unison, the trumpet players can convincingly carry the styles for a really long gig without sounding fatigued, and basically all of them are opera quality singers when they do lead and backup vocals.  It's not often I feel bad about my playing after seeing another band on a gig, but I went home reconsidering exactly how bad I might've looked on the few mariachi gigs I've done.  Mariachi musicians usually don't just ""pick it up at some point"", though.  They end up doing it for a pretty long time, and as a result, are exceptionally experienced musicians.  The culture of appreciation for mariachi music helps greatly to fuel it, just as anybody from a musical family knows.  There's not a lot I would pay money to go see, but I'll drop some pesos and drive a few miles to see a good mariachi band."
trumpet,34iggx,Felt_Ninja,3,Fri May 1 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"I think that really bright, tinny sound is more in the realm of norteño bands. Some mariachi players can be quite lyrical and pretty sounding. As for what causes it, it might be cheap instruments and a consensus of what brass should sound like."
trumpet,34iggx,Wiredhand,3,Fri May 1 13:05:57 2015 UTC,"My educated guess? The trumpet changes things a bit, the mouthpiece a bunch, and the playing style the most. I know that they generally play loudly and very resonant.  Also, they clip the notes very aggressively.  A friend of mine plays in a mariachi group and when I first heard her perform with them she didn't fit in at all.  Now, some years later, same horn and mouthpiece, she's got the style down.  It's just a different sound concept."
trumpet,34iggx,Stradocaster,5,Fri May 1 20:08:51 2015 UTC,"Just the style. When you play a lot of Slavic-style music, you play with a rich, brassy sound. When you play Mahler, you play dark and full. When you play Handel, you play bright and light. These are generalizations, but you get the point.  Edit: Probably a shallower mouthpiece, faster airstream, and firmer corner muscles. It's also somewhat a product of shitty recording/broadcasting equipment. Go listen to Mendez."

trumpet,34ji2i,theMasterBlasta,3,Fri May 1 18:03:47 2015 UTC,-DISCLAIMER- I'm not a lead player of any kind so take this with a grain of salt.  My range extends (on a Bb trumpet) to a triple Pedal F up to the G above High C. Throughout my entire career (as an orchestral/chamber/solo player) I've only ever been able to -free-buzz to the B below middle C (or Bb if we're talking concert pitch). I never thought freebuzzing was a good indicator of any type of ability on the trumpet. ~MAYBE~ response but I've never been able to find decent use beyond 30 seconds to prep for mouthpiece buzzing.  Just my 2c
trumpet,34ji2i,gramson,1 point,Fri May 1 19:09:03 2015 UTC,And a very valuable 2c it is. Thanks for the response man.
trumpet,34ji2i,jaylward,1 point,Fri May 1 19:48:50 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as gramson, range and experience and gig orientation.  I DO play some lead (not like Wayne Bergeron, but I still do it) and can confirm.    I free-buzz at about an octave below what I do the trumpet.  doesn't mean anything at all.  I free-buzz to stretch out and relax my lips, and get blood flowing through them."
trumpet,34ji2i,Yeargdribble,3,Sat May 2 23:03:38 2015 UTC,"I can't.  I can barely get out of the mid-register and the motion I have to use to do so is so far from any sort of reasonable embouchure it's not even funny.  It's something that has frustrated me when trying to do some Caruso type stuff.  That said, I still will use free buzzing to get things moving, especially when I'm in a situation where I can't actually warm-up in any traditional way.  I'll do Remingtons, often starting completely below the range of the horn where I can very comfortable free buzz with much control and pitch accuracy and I'll just do them ascending until I physically can't hit any more.  This is an amazing way to get your lips feeling very responsive, but almost more important, the amount of air it takes (for me anyway) to get a consistent free buzz as I ascend is ludicrous, so it's a great breath warm up.  I tend to talk a lot about how easy (and bad) it is to be able to play the horn with inadequate or barely adequate breath.  Something that really pushes you to fully utilize your lung capacity before playing can be very helpful in keeping you from getting complacent about it.  Free buzzing (for me) kills two birds with one stone in that regard.  So, no, I can't free buzz very high, though I can mouthpiece buzz and siren the vast majority of my range."
trumpet,34ji2i,Yeargdribble,1 point,Fri May 1 18:45:19 2015 UTC,Ok. That just helped me out a lot! I'm in the middle of a range crunch for college big band right now and my inability to free buzz past the middle of my range was beginning to become disheartening. That said I totally agree with you. Free buzzing is magical. If you don't mind could you explain the Remington? I mostly do Stamp stuff and haven't heard of Remington before.
trumpet,34ji2i,CatVaginaBackwash,2,Fri May 1 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"Odd, Remingtons are such a staple in the band directing world in the south I figured they were universally well known.  I should take my own advice and not assume so much, especially since there are a couple of different Remington exercises.    One is starting on a note like G and slurring down to F# (half-step) and back up to G... down to F and back, etc, chromatically.  Another is just doing descending half-steps.  So G-F#-G, F#-F-F#, F-E-F, etc.  The first one can also be really useful on and off themouthpiece as sort of a poor-man's Chicowicz flow study.    I basically will free-buzz the second type.  I tend to start somewhere below where pedal C.  Usually around G.  Then I'll do G-F#-G, Ab-G-Ab, A-G#-A, etc. and just move up from there until I run out.  I think the highest I've ever managed is C in the staff, though I'm really struggling past G.  So I usually just cover about two octaves.  As you ascend, the airspeed required to excite your lips into action is just ridiculous because you don't have the resistance of the horn.  They are great when driving to a gig, though be careful; as with a lot of breathing exercises, you might actually get lightheaded from the amount of air you're quickly circulating if you're not doing something like this with some frequency (basically you'll hyperventilate a bit)."

trumpet,34jf0l,x_bar,2,Fri May 1 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your help. It seems strange that the Bb trumpet is so dominant. It makes sense in the context of orchestral playing situated with other brass, but especially in jazz it would seem to make things a lot simpler to just play a C trumpet. Why don't more players go this route?"
trumpet,34jf0l,jaylward,3,Fri May 1 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"Simply tradition.  The British band tradition, and American marching band tradition favored instruments like the Bb cornet and F trumpet.  Bud Herseth (due to his teacher) made the C trumpet popular in America in the middle of the 20th century.  (You can see this on the cover of the famous Gabrielli antiphonal brass record with Chicago, Philly, and Cleveland, where some are using Bb's, and others C's)  Prior to that, it was more a just French thing.  However, British orchestras still favor the Bb (or Eb trumpet), and in the Cleveland Orchestra, everyone but Michael Sachs plays Bb for…reasons…  While a C trumpet will sound slightly (negligibly) brighter than a Bb, it is more up to the player and makeup of the trumpet.  There are C's I've used that can sound much darker, and a Yamaha Xeno, for instance, is brighter than most C's I've used.  An experienced player should be able to overcome the slight difference of the C trumpet and make it sound as dark as the sound some people associate with a Bb.  I know some jazz players who do play C trumpet.  However, know that higher trumpets don't make it easier to play higher, it might just make it easier to tune, or easier to hit partials.  I choose C when it lays better in the key, or sometimes Eb when it's an exposed part in an upper tessitura.  Be able to play your music on any horn, and use different horns for ease."
trumpet,34jf0l,GTDwarf,3,Sat May 2 23:12:33 2015 UTC,"Understand that a C trumpet and the Bb trumpet(along with Eb/D/A) aren't just the same trumpets in a different key.  The each have different tone qualities, intonation tendencies, and uses.  The main reason why I wouldn't use a C trumpet for Jazz, is because it doesn't sound ""Jazzy""..... I find that the C is great for orchestral work where the trumpet needs to be heard across the theater and over an orchestra.   A Bb trumpet couldn't do that (or at least without some difficulty).  The Bb trumpet is used is jazz not because they thought it would be fun to transpose, but because the sound fits the ensemble/combo needs as well as the style."

trumpet,34a9j4,Crowst,5,Wed Apr 29 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"I've put a lot of time into Gordon in the past and looking back, I think it's honestly just a very impractical approach to practice with a very narrow focus.  It will demand a huge amount of your time but really not help you improve in the vast majority of areas that are important to every day playing.  I have heard great things about the method, but they have mostly come from people who had Gordon teach them directly and usually involved him basically skipping over and even telling them to ignore parts of the book or to perform them in ways the book didn't instruct.   If you wanted something rounded, you could probably use the Arban Manual or Prescott Technique System (I personally prefer the latter, but I think it might be out of print) to hit most of your different fundamental needs daily.  That sad, I really feel like it's dangerous to get locked down to a single routine too much.  People have a tendency to not listen to their bodies because they feel like it's so imperative that they do ""this thing"" today.  It also sort of gives them tunnel vision and they don't work on other things.  A good balance of comfortable fundamentals to make sure you're working in a mechanically efficient way (thing some Chicowicz, long tones, and lip slurs type stuff) is a good start to a day, followed by working most on things you suck at.  If you're primarily doing one style of gig (or want to) you might prioritize skills that help you be solid for that gig.  So if you have work that has you doing something like transposing out of a hymnal a lot, you might want to work on that for example.  Just make sure not to relentlessly over-polish one thing.  The best example is that you shouldn't work on making tiny speed increases to your C major scale when you can barely play some of your other scales.  I think your best results will come from being aware of what you need to improve and actually working on those things.  It'll change month to month or even day to day."
trumpet,34a9j4,Yeargdribble,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:10:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  I think maybe one of my hangups is not really knowing what goals to set for myself and what is realistic given my skill level. Even if I can come up with a vague sort of goal like ""improve on double tonguing"" or ""improve tone quality in my upper range"" I don't have a lot of experience in how to go about fixing those problems. I was taught lots of things by various instructors throughout the years, but I feel like I'm at a wall where I need instruction or knowledge beyond what I know now to continue improving. So I don't have a good idea of how to practice in order to work towards those goals.  I guess that's why I'm looking for something concrete that I can point to and say, ""this method works because it is fundamentally about the physics and anatomy of playing the trumpet and should thus work for everyone."" I'd like to be a well-rounded player that is good at a variety of styles, so I would like to just build generally useful skills. I enjoy playing a variety of music and I don't really have any interest in being specifically a jazz trumpeter or a classical trumpeter or anything like that."
trumpet,34a9j4,Yeargdribble,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:48:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can understand that.  I'm certainly the kind of guy who likes to have a clear path and just get on that path and work straight through it.  The approach to practicing almost anything is virtually the same.  You pick a handful of things you want to improve on and you hit them every day until they are better.  Be careful not to spread yourself too thin (hypocritical coming for me if I'm honest).  Find the balance for yourself.  You need to be able to play them both physically and mentally fresh.  Getting too ambitious will make that very difficult and you'll not only make less progress, but start to feel bogged down.  Only allow yourself a certain amount of time to work on these things.  Honestly, 10-15 minutes per focused item is probably sufficient.  If anything, a lot of people ""practice"" too much.  I say ""practice"" because they spend a lot of time with the horn on the face, but aren't actually working on any goals.  It's the worst of both worlds there.  So yeah, limited time gives you a couple of advantages.  A huge one is that you won't get as tired, which means you're playing mostly when you're fresh and making good, efficient decisions rather than trying to play through tired chops.  Another is that your routine won't get too unwieldy and crush you with its enormity when you're looking at doing the same 2 hour routine for the 16th day in a row.  You'll also find that stopping before you're sick of something every day will make you eager to come back the next day for more progress.  For whatever you're doing, try to do it as cleanly as possible and don't force yourself to go faster than you can.  A lot of people will try something 10 times and stop when they get it right once.  Your brain doesn't remember the 1 time you got it right... it remembers the 9 times you got it wrong much more.  Practice at a tempo that causes you the least mistakes.  If you find yourself barreling though a dozen (or even three) times and screwing it up over and over with hopes of getting it right once... stop... back the metronome down and try it at whatever tempo you can do it successfully at.  The next day, in your limited time, start again.  Start slower than your last successful tempo (from the end of the previous day's session) and work your way up maybe 2 or 5 bpm at a time.  Aim for only good runs at something and try to repeat doing it right, not doing it wrong.  You'll make gains every day doing this.  They will be slow and tedious, but they will be consistent and not full of errors and bad habits that you'd have to fix later.  Since you mentioned double tonguing, I'd highly recommend this book.  Taking the above sort of approach to a book like that is perfect, but really, it can work on almost everything you want to improve.  Of course, that does leave the details of working on any one thing.  For that you'll probably have to ask very specific questions about approaches and methods for those areas and then apply this very systematic approach."

Tell them what you are telling us.    They can help you determine what to focus on and how to get there.   It's so hard to offer really good help over the Internet and nothing beats a one on one with someone that has already put in the time and knows what he/she is talking about.

What's your biggest weakness? Go after that. What steps do you need to take to accomplish that? Have attainable goals and pursue them. That being said, mix that practice up with some of ""the fun stuff."" Motivation is much better when your succeeding, working towards a goal, and still having fun.  I'm a little drunk. Have fun!"

trumpet,34a9j4,mydogistoby,1 point,Fri May 1 02:41:17 2015 UTC,"Let's talk about practice logs.  I took a lesson with Tom Hooten and discovered he is crazy organized.  I learned so much from him and the way he structures his practice sessions.  First, you have to determine where you are and where you want to go.  Identify your strengths and weaknesses so you know where to spend your time.  once you know what you need to work on, figure out a smart way to cover all of those bases every day.  I used a variety of books because I get bored easily.  I can't stick to one persons program or plan, I only do what works best for me, and often that requires regular adjusting and fine tuning based on what I have to play for work.  So, you play as much as you can in the most balanced way possible.  Covering everything will take time, even if you only spend 10 mins or so on each aspect.    When preparing for an audition (now) it's not uncommon for me to spend 6 hours on the horn throughout the day.  Multiple sessions with lots of resting.  I use the resting periods for listening, reading,  score study, arranging, etc.  I can talk more specifics if you're interested.  Hope this helps a little."

First off, if there's that much disparity between you and your 2nd-in-command, your band is not going to do that well anyway, so stop being a pompous ass.   Use Aloe, Vitamin E oil, and an ice-pack, or washcloth with ice inside, and some ibuprofin. With ice, you should be doing about a 15 minutes-on 10-off type routine for optimum results and remember to let the meds absorb into your lip.  If it ruptures, clean it extremely well with hydrogen peroxide and then go back to the aloe/vitamin E w/ icepack routine, cleaning and reapplying every hour."

I know a college professor who went to North Texas. Being a performance major, he played a shit ton of gigs. I think he was part of like 4 bands. Maybe 5. You know where he voluntarily sat every time?   2nd chair.  2nd chair because that gave him the freedom to do multiple gigs as freelance and make more money than most.   Get over the ego kid.

Ensemble problems that we don't have time to fix.  You guys keep saying ego as if I'm calling him shit and calling myself Phil Smith.

Don't play on your chop til its healed or you'll never play again. That's all you get to worry about now. Let your boy worry about getting the part down.

trumpet,3463cy,yalokinh,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"So there's kind of a weird double standard here. On the one hand, the injury sounds be taken seriously, and on the other hand, it doesn't seem like your current band culture allows for that to happen.  As a musician, personally, I would consider the long term health of my chops more important than any one gig. In the professional world, you'd probably just sub this one out. Opera trains legions of understudies so that stars can take a rest in the case of injury. But in high school, talent is not that deep usually, and there is a lot of pressure for a performance top only contain members of your school. While understandable in a contest situation, I wish more directors would be less uptight about where they get players. I teach on a large music staff at an inner city school, and we regularly have staff sit in on rehearsals and concerts. If we're a third bone short, are the kids really losing something if a director fills the chair for a community concert? Hell no.   This also is interesting to consider from the context of performance injury. There are physical trainers, at almost every high school, who know every sort of malady that can befall an athlete. And when they can train and how much and when they are getting pulled for recovery. I'd be surprised if there are a dozen people in the country who are qualified to do the same for injuries specific to wind instrumentalists. Who knows if this is the brass version of a concussion, where a second hit could be the end of you (or your chops), or a take-some-ibuprofen and deal with the pain nbd kind of situation. I would be surprised if there's anyone in your vicinity who is both medically and musically qualified to make that assessment. In these cases is always better to play it safe.  On another note, does your director know about this yet? Because if I was your director, and you tried to figure out the situation yourself before consulting me, I'd be hopping mad for you going over my head. I'd say it's not for you to decide who's qualified to play your part. In this relationship, you are a player, not a director, arranger, composer, event organizer, or promoter. And if you wear any of those hats without the full official consent of the organization, you are doing your band wrong. Including deciding for yourself who is or isn't qualified to take a part or not reporting an injury that could risk your health or the success of the performance. These are issues of basic respect and professionalism, and it's this kind of crap, not playing ability, that gets real professionals fired or not called back.  If I was your director, I would sit you out, modify the parts to be easily within the talent level of the subs, and (if this indeed the case) reprimand or discipline you for waiting days to tell me, wasting time I could have used to prepare for a new situation."
trumpet,3463cy,va3db,2,Wed Apr 29 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"I just went to a doctor(no musical experience) who told me that it'll heal over 4 days and that under no circumstance should I play. I don't want to cause any permanent damage so I'm going to do just that until it's completely gone and not try anything that the internet says will work.  I told my director the minute I realized the severity of this issue and he was understanding yet disappointed. He simply said to try to teach the 2nd chair(who luckily has someone else playing his part) the first part and to go see a doctor. As of right now, I am going to the state evaluation tomorrow to sit there and look like I'm playing but not actually doing anything."

It is a sucky situation, and it's also too bad you have to teach the guy the part yourself.  I think all the charade involved is silly. The fact that your director feels compelled to hide you in the section and have you fake it is telling of the unrealistic pressures of high school music.  What are those pressures? The reality is that the success of school music programs, along arbitrary and standardized lines, is what has to validate a program's existence. Every year. Even for the best schools. So true education takes a backseat to very highly controlled shows and contests. May not be exactly toys at your school, but I would venture that it's a fair description of high school band culture nationwide. And part of why this sucks so bad is a part of this particular musical culture, and what it has told you about what matters in music.  These are all just musings. I don't know the facts in your case but you seem to be honestly researching your plight. I'm passionate about the issue and I hope my comments have shed some light on some parts of your dilemma that may have been in the dark."

Horns like that are not good starting horns either because they have so many problems.

If you want something really technical, his solo on Autumn Leaves is a classic, and can be found in a wide variety of books, and possibly online."
trumpet,341tv0,exceptyourewrong,4,Tue Apr 28 19:39:40 2015 UTC,"My two cents: As much as we often talk about being a ""versatile"" player (which is very important) they won't really care if you can play EVERY style. They're looking to hire people who will be great in the specific show(s) they're casting. With that in mind, you should play something that will demonstrate your strengths. So, first off, what are your strengths??  If you're a great jazz player/improviser, maybe play a bebop head and part of a solo transcription or some dixieland. If you're a strong lead player, consider the shout chorus from a favorite big band chart or something from a Tower of Power (or similar) tune. If you think of yourself as a ""classical guy"" then the exposition of a concerto, or a section from a Clarke solo, or even an orchestral excerpt or two could be great. If you can do something from more than one of these categories, GREAT!    Preparing 2 or 3 short contrasting pieces will (usually) be much better than playing one longer piece. For each piece you play, pick 30-60 seconds of music that is interesting, melodic, and in some way, impressive (shows off your technique, or beautiful sound, or range, or style, or whatever). Again, you DO NOT need to play an entire movement, just show what you can do; short and sweet. I would strongly recommend against playing a ""contemporary pop"" piece, but you should also be aware that they're probably not putting together an orchestra, so playing the Haydn and the opening of Pictures at an Exhibition might not help them ""see"" you in their show as well as the opening of ""You're Still a Young Man"" and a chorus of ""Joy Spring"" might. Not trying to discourage you from playing classical music, especially if it's your strength, but be aware of what you're auditioning for. If you can nail ""Petrushka,"" I suspect you'll get the gig...  Final thought, remember that you're auditioning as a trumpet player IN A SHOW. So, while your playing is important, it's not their only consideration. Go in with a great attitude. Be relaxed. Smile! Show them that not only will you LAY DOWN the parts, but you'll be professional with your colleagues and friendly with the guests.  Knock 'em dead!"

We stayed calm though and I decided to just end it. I got everyone's eyes and just landed on a note. We all just stopped after that and accepted the applause of a completely ignorant crowd of onlookers. The lesson I learned; when things go bad they can go really bad.

trumpet,340icu,Krikkit_Forge,2,Mon Apr 27 14:14:50 2015 UTC,"I was playing a wedding gig one time, and the music director for the church (guy who hired out for the participants) told me, and the string quartet, minutes before the ceremony, that we were going to play outside in 40 degree weather.  With no time for an emergency tuning to bring the strings down to match my pitch, I pushed all the way in and tried to lip everything up.  It was frack city, man.  Worst ""paid"" gig I've ever had.  The parents came up to me afterward and I fully expected a 'How could you ruin our daughter's special day with your prepubescent horn squawks?!' or something like that.  They simply thought the ""band"" was ""lovely"" and we were all very handsome. (No quotes around handsome. That shit's true)  Honestly, most people either don't know what to expect or don't give a shit at all.  Don't worry so much about your playing.  Check out the ""Inner Game"" concept.  It'll teach you about getting out of your own way and just letting things happen, more or less."

trumpet,340bee,ncmggr,9,Mon Apr 27 07:56:07 2015 UTC,"My father always played trumpet for me. My mom tells me that he even played trumpet directly into her belly when she was pregnant with me. As a baby, there are many pictures of me in a sweater with a trumpet on it, so it's natural that I would end up picking up a horn around 10-11 years old. That same man, my father, worked with me and my best friend every weekend and all summer long, perfecting out chops, arbans, scales, arbans, I remember listening to arturo Sandoval, then going back to arbans. Sometimes when I couldn't get the damn exercise right, I would cry playing trumpet. My dad was tough on me, always told me not to quit, to stop playing video games and practice my trumpet. I had many arguments with my teacher/father, I'd get pissed in front of my friend and would rage when I couldn't play it better than him. My father taught us both very equally, but we always felt the need to better each other, compete to see who studied the most (which he always won) and who could impress my dad better. Arbans, arbans, duets, arbans.   And alas! 2007, two years playing trumpet, my friend and I are accepted into the Osceola County School for the Arts. Man, we were stoked and nervous. We heard these cats play before, they were no joke and music was such a norm to them. Under three months, guess who was in the first and second chair of the Jazz band and the Concert band? My father kept us going until he realized we now practiced at our own will. No more tears, no more rage, just compliments and critiques. Fast forward to now, my father is my colleague. We work together professionally, my friend is back in the US playing. Last I heard, he was zapping people's hair off in a salsa band. My father will always be in my heart and my memories for the trumpet. Even though I play trumpet for a living, I'm perfecting myself in something totally foreign of music. My father says its a good idea and he doesn't need to remind me that music stays in the heart. He also says when he passes away, all four trumpets in the house are mine, and it's my responsibility to continue the tradition.   Sorry for any typos, on mobile."
trumpet,340bee,AMIGO64,2,Mon Apr 27 12:24:42 2015 UTC,Wow. I found music and the trumpet relatively late and i really only developed the drive to want to improve a few years ago. I would have appreciated an environment where i could have learned from someone like your father. Thank you for sharing.
trumpet,340bee,Extremofire,6,Mon Apr 27 22:27:01 2015 UTC,"I actually have a super, super boring genesis for my playing. My mom raised me on myriad jazz CDs and artists, most mentionable of them being the works of Ella Fitzgerald, and the albums Kind of Blue and Study in Brown. My mom brought me to many middle schools in the hope of possibly snagging a nice school, but all of them offered no money for us, as we weren't very financially inclined. During one of these visits, we visited a Waldorf school, where all children are supposed to learn an instrument. Of course, being extremely expensive, I went to a regular city middle school.  I am actually realizing as I type this (and as I was typing the previous paragraph) that such visits were probably the precursor for my mom to suggest studying trumpet. Perhaps she intended to bring some of the Waldorf curriculum to me, since she couldn't provide me with the best education she wanted to.   One day (probably following these visits) she asked me if I wanted to play trumpet, and I nonchalantly said ""sure"". Thats really it. I practiced it and loved it.  I'm sure you were expecting a big epic or epiphany story, full of conviction and desire, but thats it. But your questions did allow me to think in retrospect, and gain huge respect for my mother. Thank you.   I have, however, found great pleasure in playing the trumpet throughout my many years of playing. In your asking of motivation to do what I do, I love the ability to pluck at the heartstrings of others and instill emotion. Music is so commonplace and many don't realize how its presence affects our daily life. I often envision a world without music as a world without color, dark and gray. I have personally witnessed (and experienced) music changing lives and I intend to do the same. Music saves. Don't forget that.  I am currently nearing the end of my undergraduate term, practicing trumpet performance and music education. I intend to share this powerful craft with the masses, and teach the next generations to do the same. I hope to join the military as well (probably before teaching); my inspiration for that is being able to serve my country with music. While military bands often perform for the public, they play for their fellow soldiers as well. Many have seen war, and I firmly believe that the music that I make with my future partners will help them ease their war-torn souls. If I can give meaning to the phrase ""music saves"" in even the slightest, from changing a life to erasing a bad memory or thought from mind, then I have achieved my dreams.  I guess what I hope to convey to you as a personal philosophy is that we, as musicians, should be there to color our world, and you should let that passion fuel your trumpet playing, and vice versa.  tl;dr: My mom suggested it to me, and I just wanted to. The passion developed over time, in my case. Don't forget your role as a messenger to the world through music!"
trumpet,340bee,CallMeTheSnoreMaster,2,Mon Apr 27 08:49:40 2015 UTC,Wow. I just listened to the finale of Pines of Rome. That alone could have inspired me to start playing.  Thank you.

trumpet,340bee,kickbrass,2,Mon Apr 27 09:19:58 2015 UTC,"wow. I think think what you said was more amazing than you think. I think that music, just like many other passions, have to find you instead of you finding it sometimes. You listening to jazz throughout your childhood and growing a passion for music where you didnt have to second guess the opportunity to learn an instrument with an influential role in jazz sounds amazing to me. To already (whether conscious or not) have a growing passion for something and to want to share that passion too through music education is quite wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing."

trumpet,340bee,nuvistor,2,Tue Apr 28 06:00:44 2015 UTC,"I started in 7th grade and played in concert bands and marching band through high school.  I only joined because my older sister had been in band before me, and it seemed fun.  I really enjoyed playing, but never saw it as something very personal.  I hardly ever practiced at home, and I had very little motivation to keep playing after graduating.    I decided not to continue playing when I went to college since playing in any school band meant you had to be in marching band.  I didn't want to do that anymore.  So, fast forward 13 years, and I got very interested in joining a friend's band.  At the time they were a quartet of bass, drums, 2 keyboardists, one of which (female) also did vocals.  I bought an Olds Ambassador, started practicing, and joined up with them a couple of months later.    I've been playing again for about 2 years now, we play shows regularly, and are currently recording an album.  I love the music, I love my band mates, and I really love playing trumpet far more than I did when I was younger.  I feel much more of a personal connection with how and what I play now.  It's been very rewarding for me.    My band mates all have serious talent, so I'm always trying to improve myself to be able to keep up.  It's been very challenging, and frustrating at times, but I continue to see gradual improvements and that is always satisfying.  Edit:  I wanted to add that I always missed playing music in those 13 years.  It gets in your blood, and it never really lets go."

trumpet,33wwi3,Call_erv_duty,2,Sun Apr 26 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"If that's the extent of your professors range, he may not know what he's talking about. There are a multitude of high school players who can play in that range and sound screaming, but do it completely wrong."

trumpet,33wwi3,Call_erv_duty,-1,Sun Apr 26 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"I mostly disagree with this.  You don't want a super huge about-to-burst breath, but I know that my high range is massively easier with a good hearty breath, and in several instances I've taught high school players to expand their range (and play those higher notes with ease) in part by finding support in a larger breath.  The goal is to achieve airspeed with as little physical effort as possible.  I like the idea of the balloon analogy/visualization... but I would note that it's easier to squeeze air out of a balloon the fuller it is."
trumpet,33wwi3,maestro2005,2,Mon Apr 27 00:47:05 2015 UTC,"Well, there's ""breath available"" and ""breath used"". A lot of players go high by taking ""more air"" when really they just need to take a normal breath and hit the notes with that. I think that's what Ingram is going for (to a certain extent). It's more about setting up properly and not creating necessary back pressure by over-inhaling."

What I'm looking to understand is the collective's opinion on the select 'best exercises' to improve. Obviously there is a lot of areas to master, but I just want to focus on the ones that will provide the greatest results in the short term (results in terms of improving range, sound quality/resonance, control ect)."
trumpet,33zf4r,zxijcvpozixjcpvoizjp,2,Mon Apr 27 02:45:42 2015 UTC,"Lip slurs (I believe lip slurs are like the pushups of the trumpet world. They are a pain in the ass, but improve lip muscle tone, control, and strength.) Long tones (to improve your endurance, intonation, timbre quality, etc.) Breathing (look up the Breathing Gym and work out your breathing muscles like an athlete)   Bonus: Buzzing/sirens (mouthpiece or free buzzing) - this is somewhat controversial. Some say it helps, some say it's a poor substitute for playing the actual horn.  If I could narrow it down to one thing only, I'd say practice scales. Make those 8 notes sound as beautiful as possible and the rest will follow."

trumpet,33yk5w,Stale56,2,Mon Apr 27 04:08:57 2015 UTC,"I have two I realized last night.  1) smiling too much prior to the gig (we have some members of a band who haven't been in town for years... they are back and we had a good full day of fun prior to the gig).  2) Evidently I'm getting a little bit of a gut, and the shirt I wore was a bit tight.  I feel like my breathing wasn't nearly as full as it could have been.  I think this is because i was self-conscious of my gut jutting way out there.  So, yeah, I don't think I took super-full breaths for a lot of the night.  When breathing suffers, chops suffer.  So shirt selection; awesome time prior to gig.

All music from like after the 70s that is getting overlooked because of everyone's obsession with the standards. Morales is definitely on that list. That C concerto is a scorcher.

That's also when ITG started commissioning stuff like crazy but a lot of that music (Dello Joio included) is crazy difficult or in other ways unapproachable. I'm prepping a recital right now so I haven't dug into the rep lately but that's going to be a summer project of mine. Hopefully I can start posting cool finds here.  Edit: I keep thinking of stuff. Ewazen has written a trumpet sonata, a trio for trumpet voice and piano, and a trio for trumpet, piano, and violin. You might check that out. Dana Wilson ""Masks"" is unbelievably cool. Uhh... Man... Stanley Friedman ""Solus"" is hilarious if you've got some showmanship."
