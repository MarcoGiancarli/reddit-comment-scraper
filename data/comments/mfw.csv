Who's to say I can't believe in God and still be amazed at the worlds we can't yet reach or life that extends beyond our solar system? I believe in God, but I also know that science has expanded our knowledge in ways humanity could not understand thousands, hell hundreds of years ago.  People are so quick to jump on the bandwagon and get into the mindset that if you believe in God your wrong, or your views aren't validated because ""science bitch!"". I find that my belief in God does not conflict with the advancements in science and technology we have today, largely because there is no moral issue to it.

mfw,33x8kp,thebestwes,2,Mon Apr 27 01:40:29 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm not saying there isn't a market for it.  But it's really dumb to compare this to a Rolex.  The people spending money on the top iWatch are not doing it for anything other than getting a status symbol.  I don't think they expect it to last more than a few years.  I also don't think the people who are spending $10k on a Rolex or Omega are the kinds of people who are interested in a smartwatch."
mfw,33x8kp,TimeTravellerSmith,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:43:45 2015 UTC,"You don't think people get Rolexes because they're a status symbol?  I guess what I'm saying is that I don't see what's so weird about a product that's expensive and mainly has the prestige factor as a selling point. Like, nobody posts ""mfw I see how much a lamborghini costs."""
mfw,33x8kp,thebestwes,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:48:12 2015 UTC,A practical status symbol.  High end watches are built to last practically forever and are incredibly durable.  It's something that you can invest in and it will hold it's value and can be handed down through generations.  You usually get what you pay for in watches.  Sure you can get a $10 quartz but it probably won't last nearly as long as something high end.  A smartwatch is really none of that.  They'll last a few years at best and eventually go obsolete.  A quality watch will never become obsolete and with regular maintenance will last forever.
mfw,33x8kp,TimeTravellerSmith,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:55:44 2015 UTC,"But $500 isn't high-end. Depending on who you talk to it is barely medium-end.   Also, most Rolexes aren't actually particularly durable or good at keeping time. IIRC your average ~$30 watch will keep time better and for longer than a mechanical Rolex. People still get them because of the intangible benefits of a mechanical piece, not because they're more practical."
mfw,33x8kp,thebestwes,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"$500 will get you a really nice watch, not on the extreme high end but still pretty med-high.  Prices tend to go up exponentially.  It's hard to beat the accuracy and consistency of a quartz watch, but high end watches are still built to be incredibly durable.  Or at least that's how classic Rolexes were...I'm not exactly following the modern high end watch scene to know if they're still durable."
mfw,33x8kp,TimeTravellerSmith,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:02:50 2015 UTC,"That's true, but there are other features of the Apple Watch that make it appealing in spite of its shortcomings.   I have neither the money nor the desire to own a smartwatch made by Apple or anyone else, but I just don't see what's so absurd about the price. There's clearly a market for it, people are happy buying it at that price, and if you can't afford it then how is that different from any other luxury item that's inaccessible to the average person?"
mfw,33x8kp,thebestwes,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:05:35 2015 UTC,"All my original comment was meant to say was that you really can't compare any smartwatch to a Rolex or any other high end watch.  Sure, there are reasons to get a smartwatch and they will sell millions and there's nothing wrong with that.  It's a nifty thing and I'll probably look at v2 or v3 in a few years when it matures.  But again, you really can't set this next to a Rolex and say it's the same thing."

You know when you close your eyes and imagine something REALLY VIVIDLY? It's like that, but all the time, and my eyes are open. I can drive just fine (but I do get distracted by the sensations sometimes).  The type I mostly have is hearing sights. Even silent things make a noise to me. I know I'm not actually hearing it, I know when something is silent but I do almost actually hear it very quietly, muffled and distant sounding. Yes, all gifs are a little like watching youtube.   That and sounds having color, patterns, motion, and texture, especially music. A lot of the time, listening to music is like viewing a silk scarf moving in the wind or underwater, or just shifting across a surface. Each one has different lighting involved, different patterns, different movement. Sometimes I get vivid flashes of where I was when I first really heard the song along with it.   All words, especially categories of things like numbers, shapes, months, days of the week etc have color. It's usually based on what letters are involved, but not always. ""Fuck"" is orange and ""Shit"" is blue and in impact font. Numbers and letters also have personalities that can get pretty complex. 7 is an asshole frat boy and 4 is shy and genderqueer kid who likes to draw. 2 is exceptionally sweet, but kind of stupid. 8 is an easily offended middle aged woman and 9 is a prudish old school teacher. 10 is a super hero who everyone loves, but he has serious doubts about himself that he doesn't let anyone on to, but believes he means well and that's all that should matter. All numbers up to 1000 are like this.   I don't really get it with taste, and touch only in certain instances."

It was filled with an empty plot, huge malfunctions, and missing advertised content. They have done good work repairing it, but it is still largely lacking a lot of key elements that makes a game great. People , myself included, kept giving Bungie chance after chance to fully bring Destiny to its potential.  They released a blog post yesterday saying that they will not be having a raid, a very key part of the game, in the next DLC. Even though many players preordered the DLC expecting a raid to be included. As of now for me, Destiny is going to be sold to buy a new game that hopefully will hold up to its promises.  TL:DR Bungie expects people to buy their shit without actually getting the expected shit.  If I buy $60 worth of shit, I want every last turd."

Regardless of if they can be white, generally from what I or you can discern from the joke he meant they were mostly darker skin than his white friend.  As for the people from Spain in the U.S, they're considered Spanish. White is generally European or Caucasian over here, the word white is thrown around so much over here though. If you're a light skinned hispanic kid or a half black/half asian kid the full black or dark skinned hispanic kids will call you white, or white-washed.

I pointed out that there have been a lot of people who complained about (and I could confirm) how it would be a lot easier on their back to grab the heavier ones from the top than it would be to stoop for them. He just told me that I'll be putting them back which was a workout in and of itself.

mfw,2pty5s,Flumphry,-1,Sat Dec 20 04:29:13 2014 UTC,"I'm not watching a 25-minute video complain that ""normal people"" are ruining video games. Try again.  EDIT:   I understand the allure of tribalism and ""wanting to belong"" in a world where things like religious affiliation and national identity are no longer the most important thing in your life. I also understand it's the same trick cults and extremist groups use for swelling their ranks, right down to telling you you're far too intelligent to believe the same things as everyone else and that ""the truth"" can be had if you just do this one little thing... I understand the concept that you've been told ""you're always the protagonist"" in your head for a very long time, to the point where you literally can't imagine yourself not being the protagonist.  I understand that you've been told so many times that it is your job to ""save the princess"" that you think it you are also owed your IRL ""princess"", when in fact you just didn't bother playing Braid long enough to get to Minus World and see that [spoiler alert] you're not in fact the hero rescuing the princess from the evil knight, but in fact you're the stalker she's been trying to get away from.  I understand that you think that if you grind away long enough, send enough emails, and just plain keep shouting down the opposition that you think sooner or later you'll level up and that will magically solve all your problems and ""win the war"" and the girl, when in fact, not every problem -- in fact, very few problems -- can be solved in such simplistic terms. (This is the concept that makes video games so damn seductive in the first place.) There is no such thing as IRL XP -- there is merely the roguelike mastery of new skills and tricks that allow you to not fail so hard the next time. And lastly, I understand that those last couple of concepts are a bit hard for you to grasp -- so much so, in fact, that you'd rather double down on your current ideological stance rather than recognize that at best those stances are giving cover to some truly heinous asshole behavior, and at worst are actively encouraging that heinous asshole behavior.   In short, trust me when I say I understand Gamergate quite well. That doesn't make me agree with you.  ... oh, and if you don't already have Braid from the Humble Bundles, wait for its Steam Sale and then go play Braid anyway. It's cheap, it's good, and it'll keep you off the internet for about a week."
mfw,2pty5s,Flumphry,0,Sat Dec 20 05:23:46 2014 UTC,Jesus christ you really have no idea. Your whole argument there is based on me being a manchild who doesn't want other people playing my precious games. You didn't bring up a single point attacking the ideas behind GamerGate. That only further shows your lack of understanding of the movement by the fact that you resorted to ad hominem instead of actually refuting anything. You're ignorant.
mfw,2pty5s,itchd,2,Sat Dec 20 16:07:18 2014 UTC,"That's because telling you that EVERYTHING -- literally all of it -- that you've based your ""movement"" on is a fabricated myth concocted as a vindictive stalker ex-boyfriend's revenge writ large isn't any more likely to sink into your brain unless and until you're actually willing to believe there's the slimmest chance you've been misled in the first place by people who have zero interest in video games at all.   There are no points of Gamergate to refute because when you peel away and try to find actual evidence behind all the points of Gamergate -- the ""reviews paid with sex"" that never existed, the ""gamers are dead"" articles that were written in direct response to this tirade, the deliberate misinterpretation of everyone who disagrees with you into some absurd sexist, racist, tirade -- there is NOTHING LEFT except a bunch of people who want to believe that gaming is somehow ""in peril"" because they just discovered how professional networking works, and think the way to accomplish this is to bully everyone else.   If you look at the history of Nintendo -- NINTENDO! -- you'll see plenty of ethical whatnot going on, from Nintendo forcing publishers to use THEIR manufacturers, arranging deals to turn The Wizard film into a 90-minute commercial for Super Mario 3, the downfall of Atari, Nintendo Power being little more than a glorified promotional channel, the lawsuits over Donkey Kong, and you will see that the kind of things GamerGate is dealing with, when they actually DO try to do anything related to ""ethics"", fall into one of three categories:   Completely fabricated claims of progress that GamerGate could have zero actual involvement in (see: BoingBoing) Pathetically small potatoes compared to actual ethical issues, like the military using video games as a recruitment tactic, or ""crunchtime""/Zyngaspeed, or labor practices at EA, or the inadequate methods used to deal with harassment in online multiplayer games like ""Halo"" which limit the groups f people who can participate to those who either can ""pass"" or keep silent. Misdirected rage at indie developers rather than the companies who actually do the things that could be dubbed ""unethical"", like tempting children's games with free apps that then ask for $99 ""in-app purchases"", King's wholesale cribbing of other companies' games, and misleading trailers and advertisements that don't reflect the actual game in any sense (See: EA's sports trailers, Evony's ads).    Also, ""ad hominem"" implies I'm insulting you by pointing out that you haven't bothered to consider how someone -- ANYONE -- could look at GamerGate and its ""accomplishments"" and not agree with you. That's not insulting -- that's pointing out that you've not actually thought about the problem because you've not even considered that there could POSSIBLY be any reason someone would disagree with you other than purely evil, selfish motives.   How in the name of Miyamoto can you honestly expect to convince ANYBODY who isn't already on your side, if you have no idea why they think the way they think (that doesn't involve the terms ""brainwashing"" or ""white knighting"")?"

Unofficially, approximately twenty years after we were created, a special detachment of the Imperial 501st Legion was dispatched to Kamino with orders to eradicate an army of clones that had been bred to take arms against the Empire."" ―Entry from the Journal of the 501st[src] The Kamino uprising was a conflict in 12 BBY on the aquatic planet Kamino, the origin world of the Grand Army of the Republic during the waning days of the Old Republic. After having spent the better part of the last couple decades growing clone troopers for the Old Republic and stormtroopers for the Galactic Empire under Emperor Palpatine, a group of Kaminoans went rogue, using their cloning resources to grow an army with the intent of combating Palpatine's New Order. The Kaminoan resistance once again utilized the Grand Army of the Republic's template, Jango Fett's DNA and equipped their soldiers with phase one clone trooper armor. Upon learning of the insurrection, the Galactic Empire hired renowned bounty hunter Boba Fett, himself a clone of Jango Fett, to penetrate and sabotage the cloning facilities of Tipoca City. Fett's childhood spent in the city granted him intricate knowledge of the facility's layout, and he led the Imperial army to a crushing defeat of the ""anti-clone"" army. The Kaminoan leadership themselves were destroyed when their escape transports were shot down as they attempted to flee. Before the battle's end, Fett extracted a sample of the Jango Fett DNA and delivered it to his Imperial clients. The uprising led to a restructuring of the Imperial cloning policy; the previous model of centralized cloning sources was abandoned in favor of having a wide variety of cloning centers and genetic templates.

mfw,2ng452,Theophagist,1 point,Thu Nov 27 13:56:14 2014 UTC,"In the case of Michael Brown, the way I see it is the problem that there is no irrefutable, concrete evidence like a videotape to prove one side of the story over the other. It turned into a lot of ""he said, she said"" between witnesses and police, and in the end the forensic evidence did seem to support the officer's point of view. But before that, a lot of people were saying that the police officer shot Michael Brown while he was running away with his hands in the air-- which is definitely something that is worthy of ""a horde of weenies screaming for your blood."" So, I think this one isolated case of people being mad at a white person is not enough to say that there is institutionalized racism being perpetrated against white people."

We also have the other guy just recently who instead of following orders reached into his car and pulled out something gun-sized, getting himself shot.  Black guy, white cop. They want to ruin that cop's life too.    Whenever a violent crime is white-on-black (as rare as those crimes are) they tend to be considered hate crimes. But when a white family is targeted for being white in a black gang-initiation drive-by shooting, who even hears about it?  Where is the public outcry to protect white families?  Switch the races.. Black family shot up in neo-nazi gang initiation.  Imagine the circus around that.  But it's so common for black gangs to commit hate crimes just for the fun of it no one even notices anymore.  It's simple as this. The media forms public opinion, and the public helps form the laws.  And it's obvious that the media cares more about black thugs than law-abiding white citizens."

There are gangs comprised of only blacks in cities all over the united states.  Most of the black gangs only allow blacks to be members even though their inner city neighborhoods are usually very diverse.  To get into these gangs, many of them require a random act of violence against white people.    The fact that no one is forming anti-geriatric gangs has no bearing on these realities.   If you don't see that as racism of the lowest order I don't know what to tell you."

If you devour the children aged 15 and under we will have the strength and mental fortitude we need to procreate a new generation - the flawless generation. We force them to do nothing but eat foods that provide them with optimal health and remove all forms of entertainment that isn't intellectually stimulating. We also force them to have flawless ethics. Then we use our new offspring to terraform mars and watch them live in peace from afar.

Just don't put your hands in your mouth and you should be fine. You can put a shirt that has been soaked with ebola fluids in a washing machine and it will be safe to use after being washed. Just make sure you wash your hands a lot, which you should start to do anyway due to the fact flu/cold season is starting.

mfw,2atpyu,Yojimara,5,Wed Jul 16 05:09:58 2014 UTC,"I wasnt trying to offend anybody.   For the future saying ""tranny"" is a slur. It's like saying faggot and nigger."
mfw,2atpyu,WeirdIdeasCO,1 point,Thu Jul 17 04:32:25 2014 UTC,When did tranny become a slur? I was unaware.

mfw,2atpyu,TheAntsKnuckles,-1,Wed Jul 16 05:51:20 2014 UTC,I guess eventually we will not be able to say male and female either.  Its kind of ridiculous that we have to be this sensitive to words.
mfw,2atpyu,Dina_Belcher,7,Wed Jul 16 15:16:43 2014 UTC,"You think ""tranny"" is equivalent to ""male"" and ""female?"" lol people in this thread."
mfw,2atpyu,KevinMcCallister,0,Wed Jul 16 15:36:21 2014 UTC,No I'm just saying its all ridiculous.  What I meant by about male and female is I would not be surprised if people think these are derogatory words sometime in the future.  People need to stop being so sensitive.
mfw,2atpyu,Dina_Belcher,1 point,Wed Jul 16 15:58:59 2014 UTC,It's ridiculous that words can hurt people?
mfw,2atpyu,KevinMcCallister,1 point,Wed Jul 16 16:00:55 2014 UTC,it's like saying OP... or OP...  ftfy
mfw,2atpyu,oklahoma_mojo,2,Wed Jul 16 16:11:42 2014 UTC,this was ruined the second it was posted.  OP even admitted it wasn't real.
mfw,2atpyu,oklahoma_mojo,4,Wed Jul 16 16:20:16 2014 UTC,"For clarification, the word 'tranny' is considered defamatory. This isn't even a joke - it's a visual representation of an age-old stereotype that actually is offensive. I hate that tumblr has perverted social justice into this ridiculous, victimized, perspective of coddling every single insecurity a person has within society, but this is not that."
mfw,2atpyu,hippesthemp,-2,Wed Jul 16 09:13:51 2014 UTC,"I don't need any extra confidence. I'm a grown ass queer with my shit together. What you need is some respect. I clearly spelled out why this post is more than obviously transphobic to the least-bit aware, and you turn around and say that I'm the one who's being too sensitive? Just own the fucking mistake and stop being a bigot. The internet may not be a serious place but that doesn't mean you can just toss around epithets and expect everyone to have a chuckle."
mfw,2atpyu,hippesthemp,-1,Wed Jul 16 13:49:25 2014 UTC,"Your ignorance is truly palpable. I didn't have that link ready...it really is as simple as doing a google search of the word tranny to find out that its considered an offensive term whether an individual trans person finds it to be or not.   What I don't understand is that given the information I've given you about the slur, why this word is such an important part of your lexicon that you are willing to armchair diagnose my (imagined/projected) confidence problems instead of just trying to not use or defend defamatory language.   Say the word all you want, you just look ignorant as fuck."
mfw,2atpyu,hippesthemp,4,Wed Jul 16 21:30:04 2014 UTC,"Run now. Almost no good comments in this room full of het, cis, neckbeards."
mfw,2atpyu,yreme,0,Wed Jul 16 05:20:47 2014 UTC,Nice.
mfw,2atpyu,yreme,1 point,Wed Jul 16 06:11:51 2014 UTC,How is 'shut up shitlord' in any way ironic?

mfw,2atpyu,patroy89,-10,Wed Jul 16 15:47:04 2014 UTC,That's horrible. Like one of the worst things I could possibly think of
mfw,2atpyu,retrobuddha,-4,Wed Jul 16 18:28:53 2014 UTC,Reach down between her legs and grab a dick.
mfw,2atpyu,retrobuddha,-4,Wed Jul 16 18:39:29 2014 UTC,His
mfw,2atpyu,WeirdIdeasCO,3,Wed Jul 16 18:57:02 2014 UTC,yeah but you are thinkin its a woman
mfw,2atpyu,WeirdIdeasCO,-7,Wed Jul 16 17:51:00 2014 UTC,No I'll never see it as a woman. No one will. Just a broken male
mfw,2atpyu,WeirdIdeasCO,6,Wed Jul 16 18:00:34 2014 UTC,It would be her because they're transgender.
mfw,2atpyu,everythingispancakes,-10,Wed Jul 16 22:30:17 2014 UTC,"More like ""it""? dressing as a woman doesn't make you a woman. You can't change chromosomes."
mfw,2atpyu,WeirdIdeasCO,7,Thu Jul 17 04:33:29 2014 UTC,Not really. Sex and gender are different things.
mfw,2atpyu,iamnotaclown,-8,Thu Jul 17 09:35:12 2014 UTC,"Nope. You can't change chromosomes. Its a guy and it will be for the rest of its life. No one will truly look at that monster and think ""wow what a pretty woman"" its more like "" ew a tranny"""
mfw,2aq5dj,1leggeddog,2,Tue Jul 15 02:16:10 2014 UTC,/r/shittyreactiongifs is a better place for stuff like this.  This is mainly for things that actually happen.
