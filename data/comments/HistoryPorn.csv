HistoryPorn,3e1bg1,Witherkay,-42,Tue Jul 21 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"The British also provided industrial advancements, technology, governmental structure   Maybe it's about time you go back and read some history, boy?  In India there were rich agricultural areas producing unusually fine cotton. They also had advanced manufacturing, by the standards of the day. The British tried to destroy the existing manufacturing system in the parts of India they controlled. Starting from about 1700, Britain imposed harsh tariff regulations to prevent Indian manufacturers from competing with British textiles. They had to undercut and destroy Indian textiles because India had a comparative advantage. They were using better cotton and their manufacturing system was in many respects comparable to, if not better than, the British system.  The British succeeded. India deindustrialized, it ruralized. As the industrial revolution spread in England, India was turning into a poor, ruralized and agrarian country.  It wasn't until 1846, when their competitors had been destroyed and they were way ahead, that Britain suddenly discovered the merits of free trade. Read the British liberal historians, the big advocates of free trade -- they were very well aware of it. Right through that period they say 'Look, what we're doing to India isn't pretty, but there's no other way for the mills of Manchester to survive. We have to destroy the competition.'  And it continues. We can pursue this case by case through India. In 1944, Nehru wrote an interesting book, The Discovery of India, from a British prison. He pointed out that if you trace British influence and control in each region of India, and then compare that with the level of poverty in the region, they correlate. The longer the British have been in a region, the poorer it is. The worst, of course, was Bengal -- now Bangladesh. That's where the British were first.  Don't even get me started on China. Unless you consider the introduction of opium irrelevant to the development of China, in contrast to ""industrial advancements, technology, governmental structure""."
HistoryPorn,3e1bg1,generalako,15,Tue Jul 21 14:39:36 2015 UTC,Any sources for any of this?
HistoryPorn,3e1bg1,DirtLoves,-6,Tue Jul 21 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"Please do. The propagandistic view on the matter of India (and all other colonies, really) is quite baseless. If you go back to the history of that time, even the British themselves confirm what was going on. Take a look at the condemnation Adam Smith gives in his work Wealth of Nations (a book that is wrongly cited for a whole lot other things -- as Western doctrine today usually always teaches things to favor the ideas of those in power).   The British governor-general at that time observed that ""the 'Permanent Settlement,' though a failure in many other respects and in most important essentials, has this great advantage, at least, of having created a vast body of rich landed proprietors deeply interested in the continuance of the British Dominion and having complete command over the mass of the people."" Another advantage was that British investors gained enormous wealth. India also financed 40 percent of Britain's trade deficit while providing a protected market for its manufacturing exports; contract laborers for British possessions, replacing earlier slave populations; and the opium that was the staple of Britain's exports to China. The opium trade was imposed on China by force, not the operations of the ""free market,"" just as the sacred principles of the market were overlooked when opium was barred from England.  There is a reason why Japan, the only place not affected by colonialism, also happened to end up as the only wealthy and industrialized Asian country throughout the 20th century. For people in here to deny facts like these, and to even go as far as to claim that colonialism somehow brought ""advancements in technology and industry"" is extremely preposterous."
HistoryPorn,3e1bg1,generalako,22,Tue Jul 21 14:52:18 2015 UTC,"It's really not.  China and India both had advanced civilizations, true, but you can't equate their technological level with European civilization, especially in the period dating 1750 to 1890. No country on earth prior to the industrial revolution really had ""industry"" in the way that we knew the term today - shit, half the reason for the instability in France in this time period came from the flooding of the market by an industrializing England.  No one is arguing that colonialism was a super-cool-fun-time for colonized areas, or even that it had a net benefit. But you're equally denying history if you posit that Qing China, for example, was technologically as capable as any of the colonial powers, including late-to-the-gamers like Imperial Germany.   Japan's survival strategy was to use Western power and technology to defend against powers it knew it was behind - the failure of sonnō jōi when the colonial powers were happily bombarding coastal cities and capitals into dust caused deep wounds and even deeper reflecting on the part of those who would later take part in the Restoration. The end result - fukoku kyōhei - was a cohesive and strongly-focused policy on using Western technology and policies to make Japan wealthy and combat Western influence.  Compare to China, which was ultimately humiliated by Western powers, but was definitely weaker - internally and technologically - than the West. Britain's role in the opium trade was vile, yes, but while Imperial China was routinely one of the most prosperous and powerful nations on Earth, it wasn't the time of European imperial expansion. One reason for which, aside from various internal collapses, was the refusal to adopt weapons and policies the West brought forth."

Klingman and three other pilots of VMF-312 climbed to intercept a Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu (""Nick"") twin-engined heavy fighter flying reconnaissance at 25,000 feet (7,600 m), but the ""Nick"" began climbing higher. Two of the FG-1D Corsairs ceased their pursuit at 36,000 feet (11,000 m), but Marine Captain Kenneth Reusser and his wingman Klingman continued to 38,000 feet (12,000 m), expending most of their .50 caliber ammunition to lighten their aircraft. Reusser scored hits on the ""Nick's"" port engine, but ran out of ammunition, and was under fire from the Japanese rear gunner. Klingman lined up for a shot at a distance of 50 feet (15 m) when his guns jammed due to the extreme cold. He approached the ""Nick"" three times to damage it with his propeller, chopping away at his opponent's rudder, rear cockpit, and right stabilizer. The Toryu spun down to 15,000 feet (4,600 m) where its wings came off. Despite missing five inches (13 cm) from the ends of his propeller blades, running out of fuel and having an aircraft dented and punctured by debris and bullets, Klingman safely guided his Corsair to a deadstick landing. He was awarded the Navy Cross.  Source"

For people that can't seem to get their heels to the ground he recommends putting something under your heels like a piece wood. That way you get weight distributed better and you can slowly work your way down to a true flat footed squat.

I used to not be able to do it, but i'd work on getting down into the position for at least 1 minute (started out 15 seconds) and now I can easily squat down to pick something up I dropped or to just chill out. The weight of your body should be over the middle of your foot, but on the front of your feet.  Yes the mobility till come.

I practice squatting for a while every day, it's just more comfortable than sitting when there are no chairs about, I have some mobility issues. I'm slightly overweight but not obese, I have lost a lot of weight over the winter, so it's not like there's a bunch of fat in the way for me :) I have also gone to physical therapy, but there wasn't much improvement. And my doctors don't really understand my immense jealousy of those who can properly squat lol and had no advice for me about this. I definitely want to be able to go all the way down so I can incorporate weights to my squats. I want to be as healthy as I can, because with the lupus every bad thing you do to your body causes amplified damage than it would for the average person, yknow?"

HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,quintinza,15,Mon Jul 20 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"Afrikaans is not controversial in and of itself. It is classified as an African language (Afrika is Afrikaans for Africa) and it is also the youngest classified language in the world, becoming official only in 1925.  English is a colonial language over here, and Dutch and French as well. Afrikaans is local however, many of its roots my be in foreign languages (Dutch, German, French, Chinese, Malay and others) but a large part of its origin stems from local languages.  People who today lump Afrikaans in the colonial ball pit have a political ax to grind. Language of the old regime maybe along with English, but that ignores the work that Afrikaners have put in since 1994 to help rebuild the country."

HistoryPorn,3e0h01,yourmindin3D,9,Tue Jul 21 00:31:13 2015 UTC,Some Background
HistoryPorn,3e0h01,Snigaroo,16,Tue Jul 21 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"That article really only discusses the official reasoning given for the Siberian intervention. If you want a rundown of what Wilson and the Allies said they wanted to do in Russia it's a good read, but it's widely accepted by historians that what was said and what was intended doesn't match up in this case. I'd be very interested to read that Military History piece, because if it's anywhere beyond 2004 it's got some new scholarship on the subject it should have been engaging with. Hell, scholars have been proposing the new view of American intervention for decades.  In the view of most specialists on the period, the Siberian intervention was a deliberate move by the Allies to stabilize the Siberian region by guarding and repairing the Trans-Siberian railway. Once stability had been restored, they used the port of Vladivostok and the newly-reopened Trans-Siberian to ship supplies to Admiral Kolchak, the leader of the White Russian resistance in the area. None of the Allies were happy with the Soviet government, and Kolchak was just one of many counterrevolutionary leaders which the Allies supported.  For this particular endeavour, a four-way occupation of Siberia centered around Vladivostok was proposed. The Japanese, Americans, British, and French all participated, in decreasing order of importance. That's a bit of another knock on the article: it reads like this was all an American plot, but it wasn't in the slightest. The French proposed it, the British bankrolled it and pressured America to undertake it, and the Japanese were there first, left last, and sent the most troops. Moreover, whereas the article claims that the British balked from supporting the American position, it was quite the opposite--Wilson ordered no shots fired, and the British general in charge of the Arkhangelsk intervention, which America also participated in, led an overt campaign on Moskow. It was the Americans who were furious with the British for overstepping themselves. This isn't to say that America has no ""fault,"" if fault is to be assigned, but only to say that the article fails to properly respect the diplomatic complexities surrounding the interventions.  Anyway, away from that tangent. The stated reason for the intervention--to reestablish stability, make the railway functional, and secure the exit of the Czechoslovakian legion--was achieved within two weeks of the first American ships reaching their destination. Troops would remain on the ground for over a year longer, until Kolchak's army started to collapse. That's the biggest indicator that something ulterior was going on.  The reason why most articles like this miss the real purpose of the intervention is because of Wilson's orders to the army. He was very explicit about helping neither side and only garrisoning the territory, which is understandably confusing from the outside. When one looks deeper, though, they see that America was absolutely part of a larger effort to aid Kolchak, just not through military channels. As the intervention technically violated Wilson's self-determination principles, he wanted to keep all direct US involvement out. This is why the US military only held the area and did not officially support the Whites in the region, and made the railway usable both for the Whites and Reds. It was semi-civilian organizations under the direction of the State department (mostly the American Red Cross) which provided the aid, though none of it was military. Most of it was medicines and clothing, things that the Red Cross could deal in; the British provided capital, and the Japanese were the gun-runners.  Honestly the Siberian intervention is an absolutely fascinating microcosm of WWI and its immediate aftermath, and I could talk about it for ages, but I just wanted to set down a more modern and nuanced view of the intervention than what that article provides."

HistoryPorn,3e0h01,Immortalgladiator1,2,Tue Jul 21 09:10:45 2015 UTC,"If you've got any specific questions I can probably answer them, but if you're looking for a general history I can recommend two good books.  David Foglesong's America's Secret War Against Bolshevism is the more definitive work. It's probably going to be dull as hell to your average reader, because Foglesong relies on quotes almost to a fault and uses one almost every other sentence, but for the historian it's probably the most in-depth analysis of the intervention. The book is somewhat dated, however (published in '95), and even with his quoting habits aside Foglesong has a tendency to be wordy all on his own. This one is a dull read, in other words, but highly informative.  Carol Melton's Between War and Peace is the more modern and more readable tale of the intervention. It's only six years newer than Foglesong's work, but he really paves the way for her and lets her spend more of her time on analysis than on proving facts. She's less wordy, relies less on quotes, and also adds in some new information which is missing or only implied in Foglesong's work. For all that, if you're a historian Foglesong's book is much better for researching the subject, as it has a tendency to lay out its proof systemically and provide a veritable mountain of sources to support it."

The photographer carried his heavy camera equipment and glass plates up the tower’s thirty flights of stairs. Beal exposed five glass plates to create a panorama measuring seven feet long.  The images provided a never-before-seen, sweeping vista of lower Manhattan’s landmarks and the bustling commercial activity along the East River. The New York (west) tower of the bridge dominates the center, and landmarks such as Trinity Church, the Western Union Building, the new Post Office, and the Tribune Building are all shown. Over the next few decades the city’s skyline was to be utterly transformed. Beal’s panorama captures New York on the cusp of becoming the world’s greatest commercial city - Source"
