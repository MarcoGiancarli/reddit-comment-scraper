flying,3dqa4r,jakielim,40,Sat Jul 18 16:19:50 2015 UTC,Some Asian airlines are somewhat notorious for putting very low-time pilots into the front seats.
flying,3dqa4r,GuidoOfCanada,19,Sat Jul 18 16:27:30 2015 UTC,"Has nothing to do with time, it's all about training and culture. With the right training, a low time pilot can absolutely safely fly a heavy. Look at the RCAF for example, a lot of pilots go straight to the C-17, C-130 or A310 after they get their wings, and have less than 200 hours under their belt when they start flying them."
flying,3dqa4r,bsyx,9,Sat Jul 18 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"RCAF? How about the USAF? We send dudes straight to C-5s as copilots right out of pilot training with less than 200 hours.

flying,3dqa4r,RedmanRC,4,Sat Jul 18 23:08:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly, after I got my wings I was flying a heavy with less than 200 hours, it's totally doable with the right training.   I only mention RCAF because both the commenter and myself are Canadian, but the USAF does it more than we do."

flying,3dqa4r,RedmanRC,-7,Sun Jul 19 02:57:37 2015 UTC,"Let the down votes pour on, but I think it's a terrible idea to let low time pilots into large aircraft. As a low time pilot, I declined being an instructor because the thought of a 300 hour instructor teaching students made me cringe, but it happens. Although I certainly think training has a lot to do with skill (graduated from one of the best flight programs in the country) I think that time has a huge role to play as well.  It makes me sick to think that 250 hour people are out into the right seat of an airliner and trusted to be able to recall upon their (6 months?) skill and be able to make a critical decision.  Nothing against low time guys, I get it, I flew for free for 2 years to get my flight time to even qualify for a banner job, but those hours were invaluable. Saying training at a too notch flight school can substitute a thousand or so hours commanding an aircraft is asinine.   Also I fly with captains who have never experienced an engine failure, while I, myself have had 3.  Not that it's a great thing, but it certainly makes me a better pilot having dealt with those situations, the stress, and the consequences of my actions.  Edit: also military pilots might not be the best example. I am certain that incidents/flight hour military vs commercial are not even close.  Hell I watched first hand as an F18 pilot destroyed 4 hangers and the 4 planes within them while performing a ""run up"" (full power) literally right in front of them.  Turns out he had less than 300 hours.  Like most of the military guys I have met."
flying,3dqa4r,pilotwithnoname,8,Sat Jul 18 22:46:10 2015 UTC,"You're talking like flying a large aircraft is somehow cosmically more difficult than small aircraft, it's not. It's a different skill set, but one that can be learned, like any other.      It makes me sick to think that 250 hour people are out into the right seat of an airliner and trusted to be able to recall upon their (6 months?) skill and be able to make a critical decision.    That's why there is a left seat...You rely on your training, learn from the more experienced people you are flying with, and build your own experience in the process. I think you are seriously underestimating what people can learn in flight training. You don't need thousands of hours flying shit airplanes below minimum wage to have airmanship or be able to make decisions.   I am certain that incidents/flight hour military vs commercial are not even close.   And I'm equally certain that the way military aircraft are employed is the main reason for that, not pilot inexperience.    Hell I watched first hand as an F18 pilot destroyed 4 hangers and the 4 planes within them while performing a ""run up"" (full power) literally right in front of them. Turns out he had less than 300 hours. Like most of the military guys I have met.    And I've seen low time civilian pilots do equally dumb things, are you implying that low time military pilots are somehow less capable than low time civilian pilots?"
flying,3dqa4r,bsyx,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"Flying a big airplane is not that different from flying a small one. That's why I think it's necessary to have things like the 1500 hr rule in place, so that you can get used to flying your Cessna around and learn stalls, stick and rudder and other fundamentals before you have 50+ passengers to depend on you.  It sounds dumb I know, ""but training!!!"" yeah I get it.  Training has a lot to do with how you handle yourself in an emergency, but having experience to fall back on is critical.  There are far too many accidents where low time FOs had stall events or crashes because they were pitching up in a stall instead of pitching down.  I know there will always be people who can't fly regardless of hours/training/experience but I think exposure to more time is good for embedding these fundamentals. Hell, Skywest now can't take a crj200 over FL280 because they have been having too many stall events in cruise.    By the way, about the low time ""minimum wage jobs"": I made WAY more money BEFORE I went to the airlines.  In the roughly 5 years of flying it took me to get enough hours to be an ""airline pilot"" I never had a job where I worked as much and got paid as little as I do now.  I would quit in a heart beat and go back to banner towing if I wasn't a gullible fuck and believe that maybe the grass is greener on the other side..."
flying,3dqa4r,pilotwithnoname,2,Sun Jul 19 03:17:34 2015 UTC,"Flying a big airplane is not that different from flying a small one. That's why I think it's necessary to have things like the 1500 hr rule in place, so that you can get used to flying your Cessna around and learn stalls, stick and rudder and other fundamentals before you have 50+ passengers to depend on you.   Or you could have a training system rigid enough so that only those who are competent get through, and also teaches those skills (ie flying high performance aircraft from the start). Military flight training isn't like civi flight training where anybody can just throw money at it until they are qualified, there is an incredibly steep learning curve and high standards, which if you don't meet, you're out. That's why a 200 hour military pilot is both ready to and capable of flying things like C-5s or F-18s, and do so safely all the time.   You're right, I don't think a 200 hour civi pilot who has never flown anything bigger than a 172 is ready for the heavies, but I do know that given the right training a pilot can be ready to do it in that time. I flew a heavy for the first time with under 200 hours, but that 200 hours included around 100 in a high performance, fully aerobatic turbo-prop and around 80 in a King Air, plus god knows how many hours in the sim.   Hell, Skywest now can't take a crj200 over FL280 because they have been having too many stall events in cruise.    That's just embarrassing.   There are far too many accidents where low time FOs had stall events or crashes because they were pitching up in a stall instead of pitching down.   Really, because the only two that come to mind are AF447, where the 3000 hour FO did that, or Colgan, where the 3400 hour captain did it. I'm curious who these mythical FOs are who keep pulling back in stalls, even though the training should be fresh in their minds?"
flying,3dqa4r,bsyx,4,Sun Jul 19 12:57:01 2015 UTC,"The problem with the pilots involved with the Colgan crash wasn't that they didn't have enough hours at the time of the crash. It was that the captain graduated from one of those ""rigid training programs"" (Gulfstream) and had very little actual airplane experience before heading to the airline. The FO was in a similar boat, she started in 121 with around 250 hours just like he did.    When you're trained in on of these zero-to-hero programs and go right into flying large aircraft, when you get out in a situation like they were, you just do not have the ingrained fundamentals needed to make good decisions.  If you're in a stall, lower pitch and increase power, they didn't do that.  And it cost 50 people their lives.  Flying a 172 for 1500 hours or so is 100x more productive at teaching these skills than letting a 250hr guy into the seat after he finished a training program that focuses on large aircraft and how stalls are super terrible.  They arent, but you need to know what to do in the event of one.  Edit: fat fingers"
flying,3dqa4r,pilotwithnoname,3,Sun Jul 19 13:59:44 2015 UTC,So I've been an instructor for over a year. With a 100% pass rate on the first attempt for both myself and each student I've sent to checkrides.  Now if I could only have an engine failure or 2 so I can be a good pilot...
flying,3dqa4r,Aviator8989,0,Sun Jul 19 00:41:17 2015 UTC,"I applaud you for your skill as an instructor, and clearly I did not mean to imply that having an engine failure is great training, it's not.  It sucks.  But what I am saying is that flying a 172 and teaching students to do steep turns and talk on the radio isn't why being a cfi is good for your aviation career. Its because the lo get you have stuck and rudder skills ingrained in your brain, the better off you are (and your passesngers). There are tons of accidents where low time guys just don't ""get it"" and end up stalling and crashing because lowering the nose in a stall isn't something you need to do anymore with 10,000 horsepower available, well it is.  Colgan crash comes to mind."
flying,3dqa4r,pilotwithnoname,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"If you knew anything about the Colgan crash you'd know it had nothing to do with how much time either pilot had. The Captain held an ATP and the FO had close to or over 1500 hours. Fatigue and lack of proficiency led to that accident as well as sterile cockpit policy breakdown.   There are plenty of lower time guys more proficient than higher-time pilots. To lump everyone with less than whatever your metric for ""high-time"" into a group and call them poor pilots or scary is just plain insulting and inaccurate."
flying,3dqa4r,Aviator8989,0,Sun Jul 19 03:13:23 2015 UTC,"Of course the captain held an ATP, the Q has 70 seats, so did the FO, it's required.  Sterile cockpit wasn't a problem, it was that they were picking up a lot of ice, got slow and didn't lower the nose after they started their ""stall recover"". I put it in quotes because it wasn't done properly.  Not saying that more practice stalls in a 172 are needed, or would have even helped, but I think maybe it would have.  I believe both of those pilots had very little time when they went to the airline, back then it was just a 250 hr requirement for ATP.  So you get low time pilots with a fresh certificate who go to an airline and really haven't had any experience outside of their flight training program,  something goes wrong, and they have no fundamentals to fall upon.  Its a recipe for disaster, and it has caused many.  The CA of that flight had over 3k TT, FO had like 2.2k, but like I'm saying that was mostly all airline time.  The airline environment is very controlled so as not to expose you to problems, but when they pop up, it's nice to have an idea of what the hell you're supposed to do in the event of a stall, like not pull back for example.    This whole argument is being argued by people who have little flight time who want to go fly an airline right now because investing years of training and time building is stupid for 20k a year. I get that. I did that. And I hate it, BUT it's a pilot pay issue, not that the requirements are too high."
flying,3dqa4r,pilotwithnoname,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, but only for PIC. I sat right seat on a Turbo Commander and a Citation II for a few months with like 300 hours. Was I 1/100th as skilled as the guy sitting left seat? Of course not. Could I land the plane if the guy in the left seat had a heart attack? Easily, and at the same time I was building valuable skills about what flying jets and airline-type crew operations is like. I would say the 150 hours I built there is worth more than 500 hours of survey flying in a 172."
flying,3dqa4r,DarkSideMoon,32,Sun Jul 19 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"Nothing to do with low time, everything to do with bad training and cultural problems that lead to bad CRM.

I first saw a picture of one a few years ago, and for the longest time I thought it was a brand new plane from Cessna, maybe a replacement for the 182 or something. Only after looking some listings and seeing that they were all from the '70s did I learn Cessna stopped making it in 1978(!).

Generally you can spot these gust fronts visually by looking for lower stratified wall clouds in front of convective systems or by looking for the dust/particulate lines on nexrad radar that are simply small scale violent cold fronts. I'm just assuming that's what happened. Is it a good call to fly balloons in unsettled weather with possible convection? I doubt it.

Ground speed was great, 37 minutes to get there.  Trip back we were barely outrunning cars on I-5 and took about an hour :)  Things learned :  Red light mounted on forehead with a strap is perfect for cockpit visibility.  Just left it on and checklists / logs etc were much simpler.  Highlighter on the map works great during the day, but is completely invisible under a red light at night.  Glad I also penciled those lines!  Airports make great waypoints.  Spot the beacon, then confirm with clicks on CTAF to light it up.  Freeways also very useful.  Water / islands invisible until very close which made night look so different from day.  Descending into the black void at my destination was eery.

flying,3dozdg,fishchunks,16,Sat Jul 18 08:15:56 2015 UTC,"With a single, you lose an engine and you end up landing in a field.  Most of the time, it's survivable because that's the outcome that the pilot is looking for.  In a twin, the desired goal is to land at a nearby airport if you lose an engine.  When a twin crashes, it's usually because the pilot has lost control.  The best analogy is crashing a twin is like a base to final spin accident in a single, something happened and the typical outcome is negative."
flying,3dozdg,JediCheese,3,Sat Jul 18 08:47:12 2015 UTC,But with 2 engines cant you still fly if one of them dies?
flying,3dozdg,NoahGoldFox,20,Sat Jul 18 10:18:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, so that's why for a twin engine to crash you need something to go very wrong and so it's rarely survivable."
flying,3dozdg,An0k,10,Sat Jul 18 10:56:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's much more difficult because of the non-center-line thrust.  Someone with an actual multi ticket might come explain more, but essentially there's a single-engine minimum airspeed that if you get there, the torque from the running engine will flip the plane over and you crash and die."
flying,3dozdg,lordvadr,3,Sat Jul 18 10:59:37 2015 UTC,"You basically hit the nail on the head. There's a fine line between single engine best rate of climb and VMC (the flip over and die speed you talked about). You start getting sloppy with your technique and it's easy to end up in an irrecoverable world of hurt, especially in real light twins. The trainers are a bit more docile (The seminoles will actually stall before they VMC)."
flying,3dozdg,DarkSideMoon,2,Sat Jul 18 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"Cool.  Thanks!  So I've always wondered this though.  Could you not idle the remaining engine and recover?  Altitude assuming.  Also, do you get any warning that this is about to happen...like when you stall, you get plenty of warning with the buffeting that you could get by without a stall horn.  Anything similar as VMC is approached?"
flying,3dozdg,lordvadr,3,Sat Jul 18 15:17:44 2015 UTC,"That is exactly the correct action. Well, that and nose down. The problem is that once it goes, it goes fairly quick.

flying,3dozdg,DarkSideMoon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"I edited my last comment while you were replying to this one.  Two more questions:  1) Is there any physical warning to this occurring?  Similar to the way the plane will buffet when approaching a stall.  2) I would also imagine it's pretty easy to get lax on weight and end up routinely taking off with more weight than a single engine could even climb at all with.  Is this the case, or is there some mechanism that prevents lazy/idiot pilots from doing this?"

flying,3dozdg,caskey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:34:55 2015 UTC,oh >3< well cant they turn the other engine off then find somewhere to land?
flying,3dozdg,NoahGoldFox,20,Sat Jul 18 11:19:38 2015 UTC,"You don't turn off your good engine! When flying single-engine (or any kind of asymmetrical thrust) dropping below a certain airspeed will cause you to lose directional control (called Vmca, or V minimum controllable airspeed). You recover from this by either 1) lowering the nose to increase your airspeed (a bad option close to the ground) or 2) reducing power on the good engine to reduce the asymmetric thrust. Vmca changes on a number of factors including configuration, CG, power on operating engine, use of rudder, etc. You have a bad time (like this fellow) when you lose an engine close to the ground at low airspeed and high power settings. Losing an engine at altitude presents almost no problem (other than only having one engine!), and finding an alternate airport is very doable."
flying,3dozdg,TheBiles,6,Sat Jul 18 11:58:38 2015 UTC,"You don't turn off your good engine!    Which is also another thing that goes wrong with Twins in trouble, people sometimes turn off\reduce power\ feather the prop on the good engine and suddenly end up in a world of pain. This is one of the things that happened to that plane that crashed in Taiwan that was captured on the dash cam."
flying,3dozdg,NotHyplon,3,Sat Jul 18 12:43:19 2015 UTC,This even exists in my multiengine centerline thrust airplane when single engine. If you go above 11 degree alpha and plug in the blower you guarantee yourself a bad day. Where does this apply? Single engine go arounds while heavy.

flying,3dozdg,LeonJones,3,Sat Jul 18 15:08:03 2015 UTC,"In the Vmca situation he's talking about, you actually run out of rudder authority. To simplify, its the airspeed at which the engine wins out over the rudder because there just isn't enough air moving past the control surface to make it effective."
flying,3dozdg,cardbox205,2,Sat Jul 18 15:22:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can apply the proper rudder/aileron corrections to reduce Vmca. You can also feather the dead engine or change configurations.

Power lines, rocks, all sorts of things that can make you not walk away from that.  Again, in a single-engine aircraft, crashing into a field is mandatory during an engine failure, so the pilot sets it up and does it.  In a twin, it's perfectly doable to make it back to a runway on a single engine.  But it's not something that many multi folks practice a lot--mostly because the practice itself is dangerous (for these reasons).  So then when an engine fails, you have a pilot rusty on the procedures trying to make it to an airport.  One mistake, and he loses control.  Bottom line is that serious failures in an aircraft are bad news no matter how you shake it.  We train and train on how to deal with them the best we can, but plating an aircraft in a corn field isn't a gentle landing."

flying,3dozdg,lordvadr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"Not multi engine rated yet but here's an explanation: most multi-engine propeller airplanes have props that spin the same way. The basic aerodynamics of a propeller mean that each engine produces asymmetrical thrust to begin with. The thrust vector from each engine is shifted a little bit to the right of each engine. Most multi engine aircraft therefore  have their center of thrust shifted to the right of the fuselage centerline. This creates a yawing motion to the left. This also results in the left engine being deemed the ""critical engine"". This is because if you lost your left engine, the yawing motion to the left would be far greater than the yawing motion to the right if you were to lose the right engine. Losing the left engine shifts the center of thrust to the right of your right engine. When you lose your left engine, the arm between the fuselage centerline and the thrust vector is huge, meaning  you need a lot of right rudder to keep the aircraft flying straight. If you lost the left engine, the thrust vector is much closer to the fuselage centerline, meaning a much smaller arm to overcome with rudder.  With that explanation out of the way, we can talk about Vmc. Velocity minimum control. This is basically the slowest airspeed you can fly before you no longer have enough air flowing past your rudder to overcome the yawing motion from a dead engine. Once below Vmc, you can't keep the aircraft from rolling and you'll enter an uncontrolled death spiral.  There's a lot more, but I'm typing on my phone and don't feel like torturing myself typing another paragraph on this thing. Someone else can elaborate on what I've said :)."

flying,3dozdg,Mr_Marram,6,Sat Jul 18 20:31:21 2015 UTC,You lose almost all your climb performance and that's when you do everything perfectly. Twins also have higher stall speeds so if you do crash the energy is far greater than a typical single.
flying,3dozdg,spectrumero,5,Sat Jul 18 12:03:16 2015 UTC,"In real life most piston light twins don't have enough power to maintain level flight in an engine failure after takeoff scenario, if you're anything other than lightly loaded. Generally in a light twin if you have an engine failure you're going down, albeit relatively slowly. What gets most light twin pilots killed is the belief that they could still turn back and return to the airport, and they lose control during the turn or trying to stretch the drift-down and stall. In a single engine aircraft it's pretty obvious that you won't go very far in a glide so pilots mentally prepare themselves for a crash landing at a cornfield, and they usually survive even if the aircraft is written off.  The safety aspect of piston light twins is almost purely an illusion - if you have 2 engines you're twice as likely to have an engine failure. People buy these aircraft for the speed, range and payload capacity.   You might ask yourself how this can possibly get certified by the authorities and the answer is that the performance requirements are much less strict compared to large transport category aircraft used by airlines, and most piston light twins are relatively ancient. For most people owning an aircraft is like owning a vintage car - it's perfectly legal to drive on the road but the moment you have an accident that car will get crushed like a Coke can."

If you were taking off on a warm day in Denver even at full power you are going to end up back on the ground, and probably at a much higher speed and much less controlled than a 172.

The 1,000' ""separation"" might have been extrapolated post-collision? Even so, the transponder on the 150 was working and ATC was controlling the F-16, seems to me all the tools needed to avoid the collision were there.

If you wait until 3500' to call them up, you've already crossed through a few approach paths here on the east coast.

All three parties could have done different things that would have prevented this.  This struck close to home since I know guys flying in that F-16 squadron, and have almost ran into a SR22 blitzing through an active MOA.  The F-16 certainly had the greatest ability to avoid the accident as far as ability to maneuver out of the way.  But he is under IFR rules and is relying on ATC to deconflict until he gets eyes on the traffic.  He should have turned immediately when told to turn if he did not see the 150, but he complied and started his turn ~40 to ~50 seconds before the accident (if I am reading the time stamps right and doing basic math and presuming the accident happened sometime between 1101:13 - :19)    The 150 pilot should have talked to ATC before.  He didn't have to, was totally legal, but it could have prevented the accident.  Very sad, and I heard that the family not only lost the father & son, but also had a double murder in the family at the same time.  Don't have a source for that yet.  Here it is: link  I am afraid that most of the blame is likely going to fall squarely on the ATC controllers shoulders.  He ended up vectoring the F-16 into the 150 when trying to deconflict.  He seemed to accept a 100' vertical clearance with a climbing aircraft, and his last transmission to the F-16, was that the 150 ""passing below you"" and therefore presumably not a conflict at 1100:52.  There was still maybe ~10-20 seconds before impact.    Its hard to reconstruct the timeline from only this and it is only a best guess given what we have.  But getting back to what we can learn, just remember that ATC will do its best to keep you safe, but they are only human.  Fighter jets move very fast, and most GA aircraft are tiny, leaving it very hard to find you.  And though they may cost millions of dollars, they have rather old avionics, No TCAS (at least they didn't when I was flying a couple years ago, they may have finally got upgrades, but even then it takes years for the whole fleet to get them.)

flying,3dseeb,littlelowcougar,3,Sun Jul 19 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, we are constantly working the radar.  But our radar is old and crappy.  It only looks at a relatively small piece of the sky at a time and we have a couple of knobs on our throttle that we have to ""steer"" with to make it look at different areas.  And only in a cone out the front.    The newer jets (F-35, Super Hornet, & F-22) are supposed to have better radars and easier to use systems.  The F-15s are getting ASEA radars that are much better too.  They developed ASEA radars for the F-16, but haven't heard about them lately.  But I am out of the loop.  Even if the radar had been looking in the right piece of the sky, the 150 isn't much metal and I always remember having the hardest time picking up small aircraft low off the ground.

Continually making azimuth and elevation tweaks to sweep sections of the sky... then tracking and sorting once you've actually got some hits, it's a fine art.  Have you only flown F-16s?  I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the ergonomics of the radar controls on the throttles standardized by F-15s, F/A-18s, A-10s etc versus the F-16 throttle.

IMHO The F-35 EODAS would be more capable at spotting a C150 compared to the AESA radar. The AESA radar is an improvement, especially looking down at low targets mixed in with the ground clutter, but not 360 spherical coverage."
flying,3dseeb,neurotech1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:52:24 2015 UTC,"I flew the block 30 & 40. It does have a dogfight mode, but you had to turn all of the jets avionics to dogfight and then lost some navigation stuff if you did that. Even then it only worked sometimes especially in the low altitude and small target arena. Radars like big, fast moving and away from everything else.   The F-35 has amazing capabilities, but only the ASEA has been talked about for the viper that I am aware of. But the only thing that was needed was a basic TCAS. There is a long list of safety stuff old aircraft are not getting. Mostly because the military is shitty at buying stuff and defense contractors are greedy."
flying,3dseeb,ViperCancer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Some of the F-16s have EO/IRST/FLIR pods for A/A use but that is mainly for the aggressor jets, and has a narrow scan cone.   The AESA upgrade would actually save the USAF maintenance costs. They could have gotten the F-16 radar upgraded 5 years ago if they wanted to.   Also, When did they change to using ASEA instead of AESA to describe the radar array?   From the reports, the Cessna's transponder wasn't transmitting Mode C (altitude) TCAS wouldn't have done much. It sounded like ATC didn't quite convey the urgency of conflicting traffic. No LiveATC feed though."
flying,3dseeb,neurotech1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"It might be AESA, all that is alphabet soup to me.   Don't get me started on dumb Air Force procurement. But to understand it a little, there is different pots of money. Operations and maintenance vs. procurement. It is typically easier to pay for maintenance of old systems than to get authorized money for new stuff.  Blame congress.   I am on mobile now, did it not have mode C at all?  Or just not have it the last sweep or two?  The TCAS would typically hold onto the last reported altitude, but even if not, would have given the f-16 pilot a better azimuth to look. Not 100%, but I would have wanted to have one pretty badly in a situation like this."
flying,3dseeb,ViperCancer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"NTSB report: ""At 1057:41, a radar target displaying a visual flight rules transponder code of 1200, and later correlated to be the accident Cessna""  ""At 1100:54, the radar reported altitude of the F-16 remained at 1,500 feet and no valid altitude information was returned for the radar target associated with the Cessna.""  Old Cessna's might not have Mode C transponders or it might not have been transmitting Mode C due to malfunction or setting.  In the GOL 1907 mid-air collision, the Embraer 600 crew apparently switched the transponder to standby without knowing, and the ATC radar didn't clearly warn the controller and reverted to primary radar return, with either the last known altitude, or the flight plan altitude.   In the NTSB report, there was no mention a malfunctioning transponder in the Cessna, and they would have known the transponder type fitted, so its probable that it didn't have Mode C capability."
flying,3dseeb,neurotech1,-7,Mon Jul 20 18:57:19 2015 UTC,I am afraid that most of the blame is likely going to fall squarely on the ATC controllers shoulders.   I'm sure our genius government will make sure that the controller stays on the job and gets a wonderful retirement package too.

ATC is doing it to try and be nice, but the ""If ... Then ..."" leaves too much discretion in a situation like this.   The F-16 pilot still should have turned earlier, but I have seen and heard pilots delaying executing instructions way too many times because they were given conditional instead of directive instructions."

flying,3dseeb,demintheAF,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:39:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I never said it's ambiguous.  I would be turning immediately. But I watch plenty of pilots try to hold on for a couple extra seconds. ATC shouldn't use it, and failing that we need to make sure we teach people to treat that as an immediate command.   Maybe this is blown out proportion in my head, but I feel like if I heard a conditional direction from ATC, there would often be a huge pause before they acknowledged a new vector. There should only be directive comm in safety of flight situations."
flying,3dseeb,ViperCancer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:35:44 2015 UTC,"Much data shows that if a pilot is visual and the other pilot is not maneuvering, that a self-directed maneuver is generally better than an ATC vector. Hence the ATC directions."

But they weren't visual, were they? and this was the 3rd or 4th traffic call.  And as I said earlier, this was safety of flight.   If you are using terms like ""immediately"" you obviously know there is an issue and should be using strong directive terms. Without any other niceties. If you have 10 miles of buffer airspace, fine do whatever conditional vectors you want. Ask them what they had for breakfast.

flying,3dseeb,Y3808,3,Sun Jul 19 15:08:19 2015 UTC,"But both aircraft are responsible for Visual clearing and neither is eyes  on the other.  Sometimes visual clearing just doesn't work.  And the controller ended up vectoring them into each other.  The F-16 turned under IFR control for traffic, I don't see how this isn't going to be anything but an ugly accident report for ATC.  Like what was said earlier, a simple altitude change by ATC was the most effective tool that wasn't used."

flying,3dseeb,ThatPersonFromCanada,3,Sun Jul 19 16:25:04 2015 UTC,I agree that the legal responsibility was with the pilots. But the accident investigation will likely put a large chunk of the fault on the controller. He violated procedures by crossing their flight paths. Fault and responsibility aren't always the same.   We will have to wait to see what the official report says. This is also my view from knowledge of military accident investigations. So it may be different from NTSB or whoever is in charge of this.

We do try to scan for traffic as much as practical though. The TCAS traffic display is generally our heads up to look a certain direction and try to pick up a guy, but many times we can't find them (or it will take us a while).

What reason is there to fly around in crowded airspace and not talk to anyone?   Could the Viper driver have responded very urgently to the somewhat poorly illustrated conflict that ATC was alluding to? Probably. But it sounds like he was searching and trying to figure out what was going on while also managing a freaking fighter aircraft. He did turn, and if a conflict was close enough that ATC asked an aircraft to turn, they probably should have asked for the aircraft to climb as well... Especially knowing that he was dealing with a single-seat aircraft that covers a lot of ground pretty quickly. A 100 ft. separation is not nearly enough to be considered safe, and especially when one of the aircraft isn't in contact and could do virtually anything at any moment without warning."

If I get a same altitude callout I'll cheat up 100' or so just in case."
flying,3dseeb,DarkSideMoon,-3,Tue Jul 21 05:45:12 2015 UTC,"From my view, controller was not used to speed of F-16 and therefore reacted poorly. His calls ""if you don't see this traffic, turn"" was rather weak. Especially when you vector traffic into a dot of same altitude. But ultimately, pilot of F-16 is responsible. Although I don't know if 16 has TCAS or useful radar for such slow targets, there was plenty of verbal warnings of traffic ahead."
flying,3dseeb,SimFreak,11,Sun Jul 19 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"The F-16 doesn't have TCAS and the radar is hard to use in these situations. Ultimately though, it's ATC who had knowledge of their relative positions and the responsibility for deconflicting their flight paths.  The F-16 pilot was responsible for visually searching while in VFR. But he was on a IFR clearance and wouldn't have aggressively turned unless directed to or felt he had to for safety of flight. Based on the transcripts there was never a sense of impending danger.  This is just a reminder that we are all human. The 150 probably never knew what was going on. The 16 was looking, but never saw them and ATC probably thought they had more bubble space.  So give every extra bit of help you can. Talk to ATC, turn before you have to and take the more conservative path when there might be a conflict."
flying,3dseeb,ViperCancer,3,Sun Jul 19 02:33:25 2015 UTC,"The F-16 pilot seemed reluctant to follow ATC's advice, as it would have put him off course. I can understand the reluctance, but ATC did use the word 'immediately'. The correct thing to do would have been to promptly (not necessarily aggressively) turn to the suggested heading by ATC. You said there was never a case of impending danger, but the controller was clearly worried about the potential of a collision, and that should have been obvious to the F-16. Just a reminder that ATC can say, or not say what they want but it's us, as pilots, who pay if we don't react quickly enough."
flying,3dseeb,blueb0g,3,Sun Jul 19 10:52:59 2015 UTC,"He did definitely delay a little in following the ATC command, but it was conditional. But ATC only threw on the immediately in the second call, 8 seconds later. Flying faster  than everyone else means you hear more ""immediately"" but I would have never maneuvered more aggressively than stand standard rate based on his wording. And he was told he was passing above.   The F-16 started turning and was most of the way if not all of the way through his turn when the accident happened. He turned from heading 260 to 215 by the radar paint at 1100:49 and was still presumably turning. He was vectored into the 150."
flying,3dseeb,ViperCancer,4,Sun Jul 19 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"Good points. I think I misunderstood the NTSB's vague wording - ""over the next 18 seconds, the track of the F-16 began turning southerly"" could be interpreted as the F-16 only began the turn 18 seconds after the call. But you're right, if he was at 215 by :49 seconds, and the ""immediately"" call occurred at around :37 seconds (not stated explicitly), that can't be the case. That's 45 degrees over around 12 seconds - around 40 degrees in 10 seconds - so 4 deg/second, actually slightly above standard rate, even without including a second or two reaction time.   I retract what I said earlier - the pilot obviously responded correctly to the controller's second call. Arguably he still should have turned to 180 at the first call but the controller should have been more forceful. ATC shouldn't have let them get that close and C152 probably should have been on frequency. This is perhaps one of those situations where everybody is at fault but nobody is to blame."

flying,3dseeb,brauski,4,Mon Jul 20 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed, looks like a lot of controller error. Cessna isn't radically maneuvering (he's climbing and maintaining a roughly south-east bearing the whole time), so it should be pretty easy to predict where he's going. So to those who say that if he'd been in contact this would have been avoided... unlikely.

He was not expecting me to take out my E6b or anything. I said a rough heading, and said I will help myself out with landmarks and a VOR near the airport. I said it was ""mmeeehhh, about 150 miles"" and would take us ""about an hour and 20 minutes"" just remember you are going about 110 knots and do very rough math.

It was really fast off the line and down the straight, but all of that weight made it easy to catch in the corners.  I can only imagine the tire wear.  The bigger problem was the software.  At least at that point they still had a pretty low top speed limiter (120?), and he was hitting some sort of limp home mode after a couple of laps.  His suspicion was that it was warming the battery pack and the software was just being cautious.  He found that if he kept it under about 90 on the straights he could avoid that effect, but it made him pretty slow overall.  He also had to skip about half of his run groups so he could charge up from a wall plug.  It would have been better if there was a supercharger, but that infrastructure hasn't hit the track yet.  Overall it just gave the impression that while the possibility exists for Telsa to produce a track car that is a lot of fun it really isn't a primary design goal at this point.  For now if you want a fast family hauler that is fun on the track you would be better served with an Audi RS7, BMW M5, Porsche Panamera, or something similar."

I like the low cost, $55k it's as close to impulse buy money as you can get. It's for having fun in, not accomplishing anything, so the burn rate of 2.1gph is brilliant.

You want to take your plane to the lake and be able to unhitch it and go fly, and have the convenience of having your own car with you, and not having to drive to an airport 30 minutes in the wrong direction to fly to a remote lake where it's difficult or inconvenient to get a rental car. Also in many places where the rich live there are massive waiting lists for hangars - sometimes on the order of 2 years."

It sounds great in theory, but it's a hell of a lot more complex than opening the hanger door, hooking up the towbar or tug, and pulling the airplane out."
flying,3dnvy5,demintheAF,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"Folding wings have been done by more than one company (for example the very successful Eurofox has folding wings and is used as a glider tug - and can tow a heavy 2 seat fibreglass glider quite happily). The Eurofox in particular has wings that will fold in five minutes, and the tailwheel version can be put in the trailer by one person. This aircraft has started becoming very popular as a glider tug here, and there are no reports of the general aircraft handling being compromised in performance by having foldable wings. Also in the glider world virtually every glider ever made has been designed to be de-rigged. Most new gliders can be rigged/derigged by one person. The mechanisms are just not that complex, and by now are well developed. In particular gliders are aerodynamically very high performance, and some have more control surfaces than a light powered aircraft (ailerons, flaps and air brakes on some gliders)  I've seen Europas being towed by cars in the UK reasonably often (a homebuilt designed to be rigged/derigged relatively easily, not a wing folder), and I see gliders getting towed by cars all the time (some of the more extreme ones have wingspans in excess of 20m - about 66ft). In any case you're not going to see that many trailerable aircraft on the road, there's not many of them and even the most actively trailered aircraft is probably only going to be moved once a week at most.  The Icon is an aircraft a bit like a glider: it's never intended to be used for practical A-B travelling aviation, but flying for fun, and like a glider, it makes sense that you can trailer it out to your flying site."
flying,3dnvy5,spectrumero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:10:11 2015 UTC,"Good to see that some folks are actually getting some mileage out of folding/easily derigged wings; I haven't flown much in the UK, and that was all mid-level IFR so I would have completely missed them.  Gliders are hardly a fair comparison, as it's not really predicatable where or when they'll run out of energy, and their coffins are deliberately used as their storage places."

Boeing offers a dedicated AoA gauge on the 737NG, 767-400, and 777, but it is an option and rare.  However, on the modern Primary Flight Display, a few of the symbols do indirectly show angle of attack, at least as it relates to a stall.  There is a Pitch Limit Indicator that pops up to indicate the maximum pitch, and the red and amber speed bands on the lower portion of the speed tape vary to indicate the speed at which the airplane is predicted to stall based on angle of attack.  u/kyflyboy commented, ""using airspeed is from the dark ages,"" which is kind of true - but a lot of commercial transport features have been built to continue practices from before instruments were so fancy."

flying,3dnvy5,WinnieThePig,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:51:29 2015 UTC,"I dont really get the AoA stuff. Can you stall at any speed? According to the video yes but I dont understand. A high AoA = pitch up which means youre bleeding speed off. I dont understand how you could stall at, say 250 knots. Or mach 2 /student pilot"
flying,3dnvy5,WillFlyForCrackers,3,Sat Jul 18 09:23:37 2015 UTC,every wing stalls at a particular AoA. if you are flying along at 250 kts and pull up hard you can still stall the wing assuming you exceed that critical AoA. Whether it's possible I suppose would depend on the capabilities of your flight surfaces. If you do this at a speed faster than Va (maneuvering speed) then you have a good chance of breaking the plane before you stall it.
flying,3dnvy5,karock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:13:46 2015 UTC,You are confusing pitch and angle of attack. Pitch is how plane is related to the ground. Angle of attack is how the wing faces the airflow
flying,3dnvy5,Masse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"AoA is actually the only factor that causes a wing to stall - when you increase it enough the airflow breaks up instead of flowing over the top of the wing and you lose lift - here's a diagram.  The reason we talk about a ""stall speed"" is that in level flight or in a stable climb or descent, the lifting force from the wing is always exactly equal to the airplane's weight - if those two forces weren't equal, the plane would accelerate upward or downward.  The weight of the aircraft doesn't appreciably change, but two things affect the lift generated by the wing: Airspeed and angle of attack. Higher speed increases lift. So does higher AoA, up to the 'critical AoA' at which the wing stalls. So, if a plane is flying straight and level and wants to decelerate, the pilot must increase AoA to maintain the same amount of lift force. As the plane slows further, the AoA required to maintain level flight approaches the critical AoA, and at the ""stall speed"" it crosses it and the wing stalls.  Stall speed varies based on the weight of the aircraft (if you're lighter, you need less AoA to fly at the same speed) as well as the density of the air and other factors. However, any particular wing design will always stall at the same angle of attack, so if you have a way to measure AoA it's a much more reliable way to know how close you are to stalling than looking at airspeed."

I just bought a Cessna study course the other day for IR.   Good for you giving them back to the community! I've noticed that the aviation community is very helpful in general. Thank you for continuing that trend and making someone else's training even better."

flying,3dpb4f,Devoplus19,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:18:03 2015 UTC,25+ hrs right? I've called in sick twice in the past year and I still have 50 hrs in the bank. Unless you're a brand new FO you should have the sick time to cover a trip.

flying,3dpb4f,Devoplus19,7,Sun Jul 19 05:47:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend flying if you have a cold. Being congested can cause you to have problems like an ear block. Not to mention you'll be exposing everyone else to your sickness in a small space. That said if you're flying GA at lower altitudes you probably won't have as much of a problem with pressure differences.   Don't take that as an endorsement though. You're much better off airing on the side of caution.
flying,3dpb4f,Minerminer1,9,Sat Jul 18 04:20:11 2015 UTC,"heh, airing"

flying,3dpb4f,Striderrs,3,Sun Jul 19 11:46:10 2015 UTC,"From what I have heard horribly debilitating pressure style pain, followed by a loud valsalva pop and a release of said pressure, followed by a metric shit ton of blood and mucus coming out of your nose and down your throat. A moment of relief and then more pain.   Both dudes had to undergo surgery to repair their sinus cavities- that involved drilling and dremeling inside through their noses. They were both med down for about 6-8 months.  Third guy blew out his ear. Almost couldn't land the airplane because of the veritgo. No shit flew a section approach to touchdown, taxied clear of the active and shut off the motor. Crash Fire Rescue pulled him out of the airplane, said there was puke everywhere. He had his eardrum and eustachian tube surgically repair. He was med down for almost a year.   It should be noted at all of these occurred at cabin alts of less than 10K, and on the RTB.   I always fly with Afrin now. And I won't go fly if I have a head cold of any type."

I make it clear to the student on the first day that of either of us doesn't feel up to it for any reason, we don't fly. If I can't fly for any reason, I always remind the student that I can try to find them a substitute if they want.  As a 135 pilot it's pretty much the same (I can just say ""No."" for any reason) but my personal minimums for how bad I have to feel are higher. Our plane's cabin pressure never gets above about 2000 feet anyway so it's probably easier on the ears than a Cessna."
flying,3dpb4f,lfgbrd,3,Sat Jul 18 04:08:59 2015 UTC,"I was always under the impression planes kept their cabin pressure around 5-6,000'. Am I wrong, or just different airplanes?"
flying,3dpb4f,warrioriii,6,Sat Jul 18 05:07:15 2015 UTC,8k is the standard for commercial jets the 787 is 6k.
flying,3dpb4f,ljthefa,2,Sat Jul 18 07:09:12 2015 UTC,"Standard is relative, and also depends on the cruise altitude. The controlling factor is the maximum differential pressure. On the jet I fly I rarely see the cabin altitude get above 5k."
flying,3dpb4f,eyeinthesky45,3,Sun Jul 19 00:08:39 2015 UTC,It depends on the airplane.
