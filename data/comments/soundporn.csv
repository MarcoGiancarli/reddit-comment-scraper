soundporn,3du2vb,manualLurking,2,Sun Jul 19 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"They can be used as trainers, but that's not really their primary role. The rear cockpit is different than the front because the crew that sits there devotes their time to operating battle systems while the pilot focuses on flying. That being said, the single seat variants are much more common in the fleet."

Best solution is an external DAC or soundcard. Something with low output impedance will get the job done since the jacks on tower computers are more for speakers.
soundporn,3atvdq,Shaggy_One,2,Wed Jun 24 05:30:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, good point, I get little to no interference plugged into my speakers, but I forget about when I was a wee one and all the random snaps, pops, and so on I got when I had the headphones plugged directly into the back of the tower."

soundporn,3aof8j,--lolwutroflwaffle--,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:26:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks :D  I have never heard of BlueZone Corp.... Oh it seems like there a sample library seller, I actually use all my own original by using synthesizers/samplers/field recordings, ect. Never really got into downloading and buying other peoples sounds, they do sound very nice, but i feel like its kinda cheating when I can just use my creativity and own personal sound library I can make things that are unique that no has heard of before. (or will be able to use besides me ;D)"
soundporn,3aof8j,--lolwutroflwaffle--,2,Tue Jun 23 03:42:28 2015 UTC,"That's really cool. BZ have some of the best atmospheric/cinematic sample libraries out there. you should really give them a listen, if not just for inspiration. My favorite ITB plugins for creating atmospheres would have to be:  Synths --   Superwave (retro plugs) HGFortune (retro plugs) Xfer Serum (WAVETABLES!! Extremely versatile) Spire (FX modules are second-to-none, surprisingly)   Effects --   Altiverb HOFA IQ Reverb Nebula3 (various 3rd party programs)   I strive to emulate analog as best I can. Good thing plugins today are very, very close to achieving that quality, if they're not already there.  What do you use?  EDIT: FYI, I do not work for BlueZone lmao."

Cranial structure has a lot to do with intelligence, mate attraction, and defense if applicable but that has nothing to do with how these creatures expelled air from their mouth and throat which are neither very 'cranial' components.  This is the equivalent of someone thinking they know what a human sounds like based on our head geometry. And as you all know it has everything to do with vibrating vocal chords not the shape of our heads."
soundporn,36bpla,Relient-J,3,Mon May 18 07:34:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how accurate it really is, but it's cool sounding, nonetheless.

It's a pretty old site, though, haha."
soundporn,36bpla,Dilong-paradoxus,3,Mon May 18 08:09:48 2015 UTC,"Parasaurolophus has a cavity in its head clearly connected to its nostrils and not into its braincase, which was relatively small compared to that of a human skull, which lends credence to the idea that it was used for producing sounds.

I believe the consensus was that the audio was added in after the video was recorded. This was determined by looking at a spectrograph of the video audio, where it was clear that the portions with the sound were cut and paste in from a source with a different frequency range (recorded at different bit rate, meaning max. frequency is lower).  tl;dr: cool noise but likely fake like the rest  also, supposedly it's just the sound of metal grinding. http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/spooky-sounds-in-terrace-b-c-spark-new-theories-about-origin-1.3065230  edit here is the hoax i referenced: http://www.gigcity.ca/2012/01/25/strange-sounds-in-edmonton-sky-part-of-viral-phenomenon/"

soundporn,32zqy6,keytarin,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:32:51 2015 UTC,"Every sound the AT-ATs make is absolutely fantastic. I think for a mechanical 'character' if you will, the AT-ATs have some of the best sound design out of everything in the Star Wars films.  I've read up a lot on Ben Burtt's work creating the soundscape of the Star Wars universe, and know exactly what went into creating the AT-AT's sound.   The impact of the footpads onto the ground is taken from giant artillery cannons recorded from a few hundred feet away. The walking cycle is a combination of a few sounds. Most of the sound comes from industrial hydraulic powered sheet metal cutters, with the sound of large chain links being dropped on a concrete floor mixed in. The iconic metallic 'squeak' of the knee joints is taken from a rusty door on a dumpster. The heavy cannons' blast is actually from an inertia starter on an old piston-powered airplane. Basically an inertia starter is a heavy flywheel in the plane that is spun up independently of the engine to a high enough speed, and then a clutch is engaged and the inertia from the flywheel has enough oomph to turn the engine over. That squealing 'peeewwww!!' is from the clutch engaging on an inertia starter. (You can actually hear this sound effect being used in the correct context at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Listen for it when the biplane is starting up as Indy is being chased by the Hovito tribesmen.)"
soundporn,32zqy6,keytarin,2,Sat Apr 18 20:49:58 2015 UTC,"I knew about the inertia starter from this sub, but the other bits are really interesting. I especially liked how dice added some desperately needed punch to the inertia effect"

soundporn,32125r,Baconaise,5,Fri Apr 10 15:18:44 2015 UTC,Wait. Is it engineered to do that or how does that work?
soundporn,32125r,Bootleg_Fireworks2,7,Thu Apr 9 19:28:55 2015 UTC,The sound is made by the frequency converter of the electrical motors. The frequency of the sound depends on the revs of the motors. In this particular video the frequency changes randomly because of bad traction (snow). It is not added to the video. Another example (with ideal traction): https://youtu.be/ywwXOeVRQOA?t=19s
soundporn,32125r,encaseme,2,Thu Apr 9 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'd like to make a small correction, the frequency of the sound doesn't depend on the RPMs of the motors (which is why the pitch reaches a ""constant"" toward the end, but the train keeps accelerating).  It basically relates to the amount of torque the motors are applying (though it may not even necessarily depend on that, depending on how the motor controllers are designed; but I believe in these two videos that this is in-fact the case).   The motor controller can either have the motors be entirely-on or entirely-off (for various reasons, mostly simplicity and efficiency), if you want half-power what you do is basically turn the motor on and off rapidly (so on average you get 50% of the power). The frequency at which you turn the motor on and off is what is causing the hum (the coils ""shake"" slightly when energizing or deenergizing, the same way a speaker does). If you want 10% power, you turn it on for a little bit, then off 9 times that amount. This causes the change in pitch. The other way to do it is to have a constant on/off cycle, and just vary the percentage of on-vs-off (called PWM, pulse-width-modulation, vs PPM (pulse-position modulation) which is what I believe the train-controllers are using).   The reason it sounds differently in the snow is either the train operator or some control logic is modulating the torque so as not to slip on the icy rails."
soundporn,32125r,nllpntr,2,Fri May 1 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I've heard this before but never really thought about it. The notes follow the Phrygian mode for two octaves, starting on an E (~164Hz). Now I want to know why that makes sense from an engineering point of view, and why the frequency changes aren't discreet.  Edit: phrygian is hard to spell"
soundporn,32125r,autowikibot,2,Thu Apr 9 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"Section 7. Modes of article  Diatonic scale:       The whole collection of diatonic scales as defined above can be divided into seven different modes.  As explained above, all major scales use the same interval sequence T-T-s-T-T-T-s. From the modal point of view, this interval sequence is called the Ionian mode. It is one of the seven modern modes. Taking any major scale, a new scale is obtained by taking a different degree of the major scale as the tonic. With this method, from each major scale it is possible to generate six other scales or modes, each characterized by a different interval sequence:  For the sake of simplicity, the examples shown above are formed by natural notes (also called ""white-notes"", as they can be played using the white keys of a piano keyboard). However, any transposition of each of these scales is a valid example of the corresponding mode. In other words, transposition preserves mode.

Moog's new Sub37 is perhaps one of the best instruments Moog has ever put out (not saying their other products aren't fantastic as well); Korg is absolutely dominating the analog market with their MS-20 mini remake, the Volca line, and the soon to be released ARP Odyssey comeback. And Roland (while not really taking a bite into full analog) released their TR-8 drum machine which by all means is a pretty damn near perfect recreation of their absolute iconic TR-808 and 909 for a fraction of the cost of the real vintage instruments."

soundporn,2x6e5v,autowikibot,2,Thu Feb 26 19:18:12 2015 UTC,"Section 23. Shotgun and parabolic microphones of article  Microphone:       Shotgun microphones are the most highly directional. Their directional pattern has a very narrow lobe in the forward direction and rejects sound from other directions. They have small lobes of sensitivity to the left, right, and rear but are significantly less sensitive to the side and rear than other directional microphones. This results from placing the element at the back end of a tube with slots cut along the side; wave cancellation eliminates much of the off-axis sound. Due to the narrowness of their sensitivity area, shotgun microphones are commonly used on television and film sets, in stadiums, and for field recording of wildlife. Parabolic microphones have similar characteristics, but often have poorer bass response.

It was first described in 1638 by Galileo Galilei in his Two New Sciences.  This principle states that, as a shape grows in size, its volume grows faster than its surface area. When applied to the real world this principle has many implications which are important in fields ranging from mechanical engineering to biomechanics. It helps explain phenomena including why large mammals like elephants have a harder time cooling themselves than small ones like mice, and why building taller and taller skyscrapers is increasingly difficult.

soundporn,2vmuy5,un1cornbl00d,2,Thu Feb 12 20:20:35 2015 UTC,"So this kinda brings up a good question that I think I might ask on the sub later. Cause, like, Alien had some of the most beautiful techno-future sounds I've ever heard, especially the hum of the main room, which is probably where this soundtrack got it's hum from. Example for you  So I'm wondering. How could you make something like that on curent or futuristic computers? Ours are so quite. What would you use? Anything?"
soundporn,2vmuy5,SoundProofHead,1 point,Thu Feb 12 22:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a sound designer, I can give you an answer. I hope I didn't misunderstood the question.  In sound design there are many different ways to do something. In that case, we could use an impulse response. It's usually used to get the reverberation properties of a place to apply it to whatever you want afterwards but you can also get the sound properties of speakers for instance. So we could use the impulse response of an old computer or an old TV and apply this effect to a simple synth. This would give the synth a retro-futuristic sound (plus some tweaks like saturation and EQ). After that, it's all about combining mechanical sounds that mimick what you're looking for. It's an illusion, if you're not lucky enough to have one of these old computers, you can find ways to mimick their sounds."

soundporn,2v3von,gorillamunchies,2,Sun Feb 8 04:15:36 2015 UTC,"They have a steady supply, but the prices DO go up almost yearly. Back in 09 or so I bought a Service Grade Springfield rifle for $595.  That same rifle is now $730.  The CMP will always be the cheapest place to get a shooter-grade M1. It's worth buying and keeping because these are sweet sweet guns."

Or is it really all just cosmetic?  thanks again!"
soundporn,2v3von,gorillamunchies,2,Sun Feb 8 04:26:10 2015 UTC,"The requirements to get one are simple to complete. I actually had a type 03 FFL which is what I used to acquire mine. (subsequently I had to record the purchase in my C&R log book)  In my opinion, Service Grade is the lowest grade I would get for something presentable. I think all the ones they sell are functional and safe, but really how many M1s are you going to buy in your life? Might as well get one that looks decent.  Don't forget to buy some of that HXP .30-06 ammo before they run out again. Wouldn't hurt to learn how to reload so you don't shell out $1/rd for commercial .30-06 (which you shouldn't shoot in the M1 anyway)."
soundporn,2v3von,costanza_vandelay,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:33:25 2015 UTC,"I sort of want one that would look a little beat up, seeing as how it's a WWII rifle, I think I would like that look (But then again I haven't seen what the grades look like in person, so I may take that back)  What's the difference between the HXP .30-06 and commercial .30-06??"
soundporn,2v3von,gorillamunchies,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:37:39 2015 UTC,"HXP .30-06 is Greek Surplus since the Greek armed forces at one time used M1 Garands. The ammo is matched to the gas system of the M1.  Commercial .30-06 loads are mostly intended for bolt guns, which don't use gas systems, and are often on the higher end of the pressure spectrum.  The M1 uses an ""operating rod"" that cycles the action once a bullet leaves the barrel. This op rod can get severely damaged if you shoot ammo that isn't the right profile for the M1.  You CAN, however, put an adjustable gas plug in the M1 and fine tune the rifle to cycle with any ammunition. This is more of a chore than a convenience, though.  For example, my M1 has a Schuster adjustable gas plug but I basically keep it closed at 0% and only shoot HXP ammo anyway."
soundporn,2v3von,costanza_vandelay,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:44:18 2015 UTC,"if the HXP .30-06 is Greek surplus, are they still producing the ammo, or are they just selling leftovers??  Thanks so much for answering all of these questions"
soundporn,2v3von,gorillamunchies,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:48:18 2015 UTC,I can't imagine it's being made any more since most modern armed forces have moved to STANAG calibers. The CMP has most of it and is selling it in rationed quantities. This also has gone up considerably in price.  Back in 09 I bought the 240 round cans for probably $100/ea.  Now they're going for $178...

soundporn,2tov7l,chingchongwah,1 point,Mon Jan 26 05:30:11 2015 UTC,this is undenyable one of the most important inventions of the last century.  also it's always interesting how old EDM actually is.
soundporn,2tov7l,Bohzee,6,Mon Jan 26 12:48:15 2015 UTC,"EDM is about 3-4 years old and calling the music that was originally produced on machines such as these EDM is so reductive it actually hurts me.  It's like calling all music with a drum kit in it ""Rock and Roll"" except it's worse than that."
soundporn,2tov7l,Imsomoney,2,Mon Jan 26 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"hm, i think the word is ok, so you don't have to distinguish between house, trance, rave, electro, industrial, and so on."
soundporn,2tov7l,Bohzee,3,Mon Jan 26 16:41:25 2015 UTC,Just say electronic music then.
soundporn,2tov7l,Imsomoney,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:08:16 2015 UTC,i don't think it makes that big difference if i say electronic dance music oder electronic music. or is it the abbreviation that bugs you?
soundporn,2tov7l,Bohzee,0,Mon Jan 26 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"It's the idea of equating this new soulless, cynical pop music termed EDM by the marketing trying to sell it in the mainstream as the same as the vast amount of nuanced genres that have evolved over 30 years just because they use similar drum patterns."
soundporn,2tov7l,Imsomoney,2,Mon Jan 26 17:30:28 2015 UTC,"i don't like it either, though some sound catchy. i like electronic music since the late 90s when i was a child and it have been around here in europe anyway, in contrary to the us except some exceptions, even though some fundamental styles were created there.  what now happened, or rather recurred, because ""this new techno-thing"" was commercialized pretty fast, is the (sadly) normal way of commercializing music. and now it even works for the us.  anyway, except for the dark shadow of the term, it has a practical meaning and i didn't mean something like david guetta.  if anything, i was meaning that ""synthesizer-music"" isn't just around till 2006, or even 1989. some kids don't know that."
soundporn,2tov7l,Bohzee,2,Mon Jan 26 17:58:34 2015 UTC,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music
soundporn,2tov7l,Imsomoney,2,Mon Jan 26 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"""The acronym ""EDM"" was adopted by the American music industry and music press as a buzzword to describe the increasingly commercial US electronic dance music scene. ""EDM"" is the umbrella term for which other genre's fall under i.e.; house, euro-dance, trance, techno, trap, dubstep and garage. ""EDM"" is not a genre of its own but a collected group of sub genres of electronic dance music.[4][5]"""

soundporn,2tov7l,betheguy,2,Mon Jan 26 19:13:23 2015 UTC,"I thought it came from Aphex Twin being referred to as IDM which makes EDM the obvious catch-all for everything else. IDM was a meaningless moniker and EDM as ""stuff that isn't IDM"" is even more meaningless."

soundporn,2tov7l,Bohzee,2,Fri Mar 6 19:08:00 2015 UTC,"I know man, I know. Ironically it means more now that you have the ""stupider"" EDM."
soundporn,2tov7l,SomethingIntangible,2,Sat Mar 7 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"IDM is short for ""intelligent dance music"". except for a fitting description for that style with its playful elements it was actually named after a label called intelligent records iirc, which made tracks like those.  speaking of reutilizing terms, ""EDM"" isn't the only one. in the last century there was even a style called ""nu rave"", with another meaning as the current nu rave, where producers jump on that nasty 90s revival train. it was...alternative! rock music with a hi-hat reminding on house music. actually it had nothing to do with it, but you know, commercializing.  but for ""EDM"", it's more a term for not having to call it all ""techno"" or ""dance""."
soundporn,2tov7l,Bohzee,2,Mon Jan 26 22:39:48 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say the sound synthesizer is very important at all in the scope of inventions.
soundporn,2tov7l,SomethingIntangible,2,Tue Jan 27 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"on the first sight, yes.  and it might sound poetic, but there's more to it. do you want to deny the worth of expression of art, entertainment and the good feeling and other influences of music?  music doesn't clean my room, but it can give me motivation to do it.  music cannot heal most deseases, but it can work against depression and social phobia.  music can't take you from a place to another, but on a spiritual and/or psychological way, it can.  do i have to mention money?  through history, music influenced society.  think about it, it's more real as it might imply on the first sight."
soundporn,2tov7l,Bohzee,2,Tue Jan 27 14:27:00 2015 UTC,"wait... were you talking about the Moog or synthesizers in general? Cause either way, they are just instruments in music.

There is no advertisement, nor time out on the public generators.  Just try this and turn Animate! on... you will have hours of fun, or this one if you are more into tonal sounds.  My challenge is to keep this website alive - without any paid subscription - when the monthly bandwidth rates in terabytes, and the time spent on designing all of this, is equivalent to 20h a week (at least). Any donation will unlock the bonus features... for a lifetime.   I can't do anything less frustrating than that, or I will have to close the website.  I know, many people expect to have everything for free nowadays. But often, free is an illusion. Nothing is free.

soundporn,2qvrxc,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Dec 31 10:01:20 2014 UTC,"Mains hum:       Mains hum, electric hum, or power line hum is a sound associated with alternating current at the frequency of the mains electricity. The fundamental frequency of this sound is usually 50 Hz or 60 Hz, depending on the local power-line frequency. The sound often has heavy harmonic content above 50–60 Hz. Because of the presence of mains current in mains-powered audio equipment as well as ubiquitous AC electromagnetic fields from nearby appliances and wiring, 50/60 Hz electrical noise can get into audio systems, and is heard as mains hum from their speakers. Mains hum may also be heard coming from powerful electric power grid equipment such as utility transformers, caused by mechanical vibrations induced by the powerful AC current in them.

soundporn,2q8aq3,liamPwalsh,4,Wed Dec 24 02:53:37 2014 UTC,"Waterphone:       A waterphone (also ocean harp) is a type of inharmonic acoustic percussion instrument consisting of a stainless steel resonator bowl or pan with a cylindrical neck and bronze rods of different lengths and diameters around the rim of the bowl. The resonator may contain a small amount of water giving the waterphone a vibrant ethereal sound that has appeared in movie soundtracks, record albums, and live performances. The instrument was invented and developed by Richard Waters.  Several sizes and design variants of the instrument exist. It is generally played in a seated position by a soloist and either bowed or drummed, played as a friction or struck idiophone, with movements to affect the water inside. This combines the resonant characteristics of the bowl and rods in combination with the movement of the water. The sound of the waterphone is often used to evoke mystery and suspense. A superball mallet has become the prime way of drumming the waterphone.  The waterphone is a modern invention influenced by a Tibetan drum, encountered by the inventor in the early sixties, containing a small amount of water affecting its timbre.  It is also related to the nail violin, which also used a resonator and rods (nails), and is struck or bowed.     Image i - Waterphone with superball mallets.

Oneohtrix Point Never (pleasantly disorienting, soft, analog, made entirely from samples of old commercials) Dysnomia (acoustic instruments imitating electronic instruments, repetitive, hypnotic, kinda dark) Boards of Canada (ambient-with-a-beat, nostalgic, analog, dreamscape-y, wistful but not necessarily sad or dark. Legendary Artist.)] Aphex Twin (borderline acidic, techno influenced, lush, innovative, mechanical. Legendary Artist.) The Field (Ambient house and techno, extremely lush, creative state inducing, flow music) Brian Eno, Jon Hopkins and Others (Equal parts weird and sublime-ly relaxing) Trent Reznor's Ghosts I-IV (All over the map. From rock-ish to gentle serene soundscapes to everything in between.) Pantha Du Prince (housey, technoy serene, soft soundscapes)  Other noteworthy but not necessarily enitrely fitting mentions: Recondite, Stars of the Lid, Nils Frahm, Trent Reznor (and/or Atticus Ross), Sigur Ros, Lorn, Nicolas Jaar, Godspeed You!

soundporn,2o37vt,neunen,3,Tue Dec 2 22:22:19 2014 UTC,"Singing sand:       Singing sand, whistling sand or barking sand is sand that produces sound. The sound emission may be caused by wind passing over dunes or by walking on the sand.  Certain conditions have to come together to create singing sand:   The sand grains have to be round and between 0.1 and 0.5 mm in diameter. The sand has to contain silica. The sand needs to be at a certain humidity.   The most common frequency emitted seems to be close to 450 Hz.  There are various theories about the singing sand mechanism. It has been proposed that the sound frequency is controlled by the shear rate. Others have suggested that the frequency of vibration is related to the thickness of the dry surface layer of sand. The sound waves bounce back and forth between the surface of the dune and the surface of the moist layer, creating a resonance that increases the sound's volume. The noise may be generated by friction between the grains or by the compression of air between them.   Other sounds that can be emitted by sand have been described as ""roaring"" or ""booming"".  The particular note produced by the dune, between 60 and 105 hertz, is controlled by the rate of collision in the shear band separating the avalanche from the static part of the dune. For spontaneous avalanches, the frequency is controlled by gravity and by the size of the sand grains.

soundporn,2mqqha,thathandsomeguy,8,Wed Nov 19 04:51:39 2014 UTC,"interesting fact - you may notice a ""crickling"" quality to the sound. As you may know, sound is a phenomenon of repeating waves of higher and lower pressure, permeating through a medium (here - air). The amplitude of the wave, i.e. how much the high and low pressure regions are different from the atmospheric pressure is what we percieve as volume of the sound. So a loud sound will create a wave of very high and very low pressures. Now the reason rocket launches sound the way they do is that they are so loud, the low pressure regions of the wave are down to vacuum, and the pressure physically cannot get any lower than that. This causes the peak of the wave to be cut (much like the way it's cut in the sound of an overdriven electric guitar), producing the characteristic crickling sound."

In line with company convention, the Griffon was named after a bird of prey, in this case the Griffon Vulture.  Design work on the Griffon started in 1938 at the request of the Fleet Air Arm, for use in new aircraft designs such as the Fairey Firefly. In 1939 it was also decided that the engine could be adapted for use in the Spitfire. However, development was temporarily put on hold to concentrate efforts on the smaller Merlin and the 24-cylinder Vulture, and the engine did not go into production until the early 1940s.  The Griffon was the last in the line of V-12 aero engines to be produced by Rolls-Royce with production ceasing in 1955.  Griffon engines remain in Royal Air Force service today with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and power the last remaining airworthy Avro Shackleton.

soundporn,2lfzi6,peabnuts123,9,Thu Nov 6 08:45:58 2014 UTC,"It's the two long metal(?) pieces that carry vibrations. The vibrations travel the length of the metal and when they get to one end, they lose some energy and reflect back causing a delayed and filtered sound. The different size and length metal will produce different delay times and different filter characteristics. Together, they produce a complex feedback delay.  Btw, that is all reverb is. A very complex series of delay lines and filters."
soundporn,2lfzi6,SomethingIntangible,7,Thu Nov 6 11:42:05 2014 UTC,"I believe its two very long springs. This is, in fact, a very old, classic way of doing reverb, and is how it was done in effects units, guitar amps, etc. before digital delay and reverb was possible. It's become such an iconic sound of music though that it's a standard digital effect now in most reverb suites, which is probably why it sounds post-processed to you.  This instrument is rather unique in that it seems to use the resonant heads of the drums to feed back the vibrations in to the springs, creating a sort of spring feedback loop which is what is creating the insane sustain and mix of delay/reverb sound.  Very very neat!"

The one that comes up immediately after (I think that's around 0:49 into the video) looks like a very late '60s or very early '70s design, since the wings have appeared but the body itself is still very round and narrow... my guess is that it's from 1970.

The Raptors of Jurassic Park had the most complex sound designs of all the animals in the film. Samples from various birds such as cranes and geese, and various animals such as dolphins, walrus, tortoises, and horses, the sound effects gave the Velociraptors a language of their own. Dolphins and walrus made up the base of the Velociraptors famous screech, with horse sounds thrown into the mix for variation. Tortoises mating made up the base of the Velociraptors bark when calling to one another. The sounds also were mixed rigorously to create hoots, cackles, roars, snarls, and hisses. These sound effects largely contributed to the reptilian feel that was used in the portrayal of the villains of the first film"

""Trust me, nothing else sounds like that."""

soundporn,2jw2gi,friedballsack,4,Tue Dec 23 04:45:24 2014 UTC,"He's playing open-handed. If you can learn how to utilize it, you can shift your dominant hand. It basically just opens up another book of possibilities."
soundporn,2jw2gi,Chunky-Bunker,3,Tue Dec 23 21:19:33 2014 UTC,What exactly is it useful for? I'm kinda curious. I've been a percussionist for a while and I've never heard any uses for it aside from maybe playing a fill on a kit
soundporn,2jw2gi,friedballsack,3,Tue Dec 23 21:23:56 2014 UTC,"I honestly don't have the ambidexterity to pull it off, but from what I gather, it can be useful in a number of situations. Fills, beats, lead-ins, etc. However, I'm not sure it would be anywhere near as useful when a kit isn't involved."

soundporn,2jw2gi,SomethingIntangible,2,Tue Oct 21 14:34:19 2014 UTC,"so I guess he wrote a drum part, played it at every spot then edited it together? I wonder how much of this is editing too"
soundporn,2jw2gi,MarlboroReddit,4,Tue Oct 21 15:24:05 2014 UTC,"He either had a mic in/on the kick, or added it in post. It was way too clean and consistent across the scenes."
soundporn,2jw2gi,sysiphean,2,Tue Oct 21 19:10:52 2014 UTC,No. The reverb is created in the studio. It even looks like green screen for the backgrounds.
soundporn,2jw2gi,CaptainMulligan,3,Tue Oct 21 18:18:06 2014 UTC,Incorrect.
soundporn,2jw2gi,sysiphean,5,Tue Oct 21 19:09:13 2014 UTC,"Ok, they might have used reverb they recorded in the environments, but those are mic'd drum sounds. There's no fucking way you can get that bass drum sound without a mic on it. There's definitely fakery going on."
soundporn,2jw2gi,CaptainMulligan,2,Tue Oct 21 19:25:02 2014 UTC,"Probably just mic'd the drums normally and had a mic for each of the environments he was in, then layed em over each other"
soundporn,2jw2gi,MarlboroReddit,2,Tue Oct 21 19:45:24 2014 UTC,Non-visible mics is not the same as fakery. They probably multitracked it with four or five mics and mixed them in post to maximize the environmental effects.
soundporn,2jw2gi,sysiphean,3,Tue Oct 21 21:08:42 2014 UTC,Incorrect. Here's a making of video that shows they used one mic on location.  Also:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=y1ubNoresUA#t=164

soundporn,2jtvl3,Dilong-paradoxus,3,Mon Oct 20 22:22:35 2014 UTC,Holy shit! What are the uses for something like what they were turning on the gigantic lathe? Interesting to me that it's not liquid-cooled cutting- those chips were colored blue from the friction heat!
soundporn,2jtvl3,Mandocello,2,Tue Oct 21 09:11:53 2014 UTC,"Looks like some sort of drive shaft for a very large turbine or similar power device. In the final frames they show you the product, but it is in no way nearly finished. That piece probably still has hundreds of machine-hours to go yet - Milling, turning, milling, turning, boring, drilling to add more features."
soundporn,2jtvl3,Nephoscope,3,Tue Oct 21 09:40:28 2014 UTC,"I couldn't tell you what they're making, but my understanding is that most of the heat is carried away in the chips that fall off, and liquid cooling would not help much for how much extra complexity and cost it adds."

soundporn,2jtvl3,Nephoscope,3,Tue Oct 21 04:51:33 2014 UTC,How is that a waste? all of that swarf is sold back to recyclers.
soundporn,2jtvl3,gimli2,-2,Tue Oct 21 09:42:12 2014 UTC,Waste of energy it seems like. To melt all of that then go and use a very powerful machine to cut away half of it
soundporn,2jtvl3,Nephoscope,1 point,Tue Oct 21 11:59:04 2014 UTC,"What else are they going to do when they need a 1ft diameter shaft with a few 1.5 meter diameter sections?   It's really not that expensive to just re-melt the swarf, it's practically pure."

soundporn,2iaczt,self_defeating,4,Sat Oct 4 20:44:43 2014 UTC,"I think that's what this is about.  From the video description:   When you move the metronome and put on a table that moves multiple metronome that ticks all the metronome sound at the same time as it is known in sync eventually.  Create table test equipment such as works by hanging from the left and right units to put a metronome, the laboratory is Ikeguchi, we have conducted an experiment in sync. In this video 32 metronome ticks sound at the same time.   So... yeah! I have no idea!"
soundporn,2iaczt,LithiumEnergy,3,Sat Oct 4 20:58:25 2014 UTC,"Since the table is suspended it must cause the metronomes to change. I'll have to look into it but I think it's sort of like a swing: when you are moving down a swing you move your feet out in front of you, and coming back you tuck them in. But if the swing set itself is also moving, the act of moving your feet may not increase your momentum. Something with the interaction with these metronomes and this swing set idea makes this synchronisation."
soundporn,2iaczt,Festlund,3,Sat Oct 4 22:27:18 2014 UTC,"Mythbusters tested it..  They sync because of the table yes, the table moves back and forth basically forcing them in to sync.  If the table was rigid they would never sync."

soundporn,2i5b5p,Akazu,2,Fri Oct 3 09:38:08 2014 UTC,"well an inline 4 is indeed half a V8. if you look even deeper into the matter you'll find that regular inline 4s with a flat plane crankshaft sound a lot like Ferrari V8s and Formula 1 V8s when being revved up high.   a crossplane crankshaft on an inline 4 (like that on a Yamaha YZF R1) sounds like a tiny version of a big american V8.   the reason for this is the way that the 8 crankshaft types force the overlap of combustion cycles. crossplane crakshaft like those used in muscle cars, pickup trucks most sports cars don't have a perfectly even firing order. this gives them a burbling sound.   most road cars(with inline 4 engines), exotic cars (with V8s), race cars and bikes like the one Op posted have have flat plane crackshafts that force a smoother firing order giving them a more screamy type sound.   if you want a bit better explanation, you can check out these videos.   http://youtu.be/-s5bSQIQQsY  and  http://youtu.be/Hb9exU7tV0A  my favorite sounds come from inline 5 and V10 engines. its crazy to see how the tone of an actual engine  like this http://youtu.be/2akKj53jw30  can be heard in something made out of lego like this  http://youtu.be/SZT2V259Rmw?t=57s  really goes to show that the way overlap happens in combustion has a much bigger role in engine sound than just an exhaust."

So slowing something down 100% would make it stop?  And 800% would be..?  If it's an eighth of it's original speed, it would have slowed down by 87.5%, wouldn't it?"
soundporn,2i2fi8,MarlboroReddit,2,Thu Oct 2 21:58:14 2014 UTC,800% means 8 times longer. I could have said 8x but the program I used uses percentage as do the rest of the YouTube videos making it easier to search for.

You'll see the last few ones have big thick lines to sort - that mean's they're only sorting a small amount of lines.  The ones in the beginning had pixel-thin lines, so they had way more items to sort.  Some also say ""2.0 ms delay"", some say 1 ms, some are 0.6ms.  The fastest ones have 2ms delay because they're so fast that you wouldn't be able to see it properly.  In general, the fastest all-purpose ones are Quicksort and Heapsort, and I think that stdc one."

soundporn,2gpyph,SirMimir,7,Thu Sep 18 04:15:20 2014 UTC,Its an Ignition Delay Anti-Lag system. In this case it works by keeping a fuel air mixture burning after the combustion chamber but before the turbo to keep the turbo delivering boost even when the engine isn't producing enough exhaust gasses. That way you get maximum horsepower earlier in the rev range and don't have to worry about turbo lag as much.   Here is a video explaining it better if you are interested.

In Hiberno-English, the anglicised spelling lough is commonly found in placenames, although it is pronounced the same way as loch. In Scottish English, 'loch' is always used. Some lochs could also be called firths, fiords, estuarys, straits or bays. Sea-inlet lochs are often called sea lochs or sea loughs.

soundporn,2fqnt8,mysockinabox,2,Sun Sep 7 20:17:13 2014 UTC,"According to /u/emanresu1 from Portal's 'Still Alive' being ""sung"" by a laser. Check out what the laser is cutting.   In a 1085 nanometer, neodymium doped silica/germanium based fiber laser such as this one, generally the doped gain medium is hosted in the innermost core of a multi-clad fiber, whilst the initial core cladding is used to host the pump light, typically in the 800-900nm range which is supplied by a gallium arsenide semiconductor laser diode. The frustrated total internal reflection of the pump light at the core-clad interface (provided the index of refraction matching of the two materials has been suitably selected for, of course) allows the pump light to be efficiently and uniformly coupled into the gain medium at an arbitrary frequency limited largely by the obvious parameters of the speed of light in the gain medium and length of the optical resonator itself. Thus, you can now see that due to the natural high frequency operational capability of either the pump light to be switched at least in the kilohertz range, or alternately, a high finesse potassium dihydrogen phosphate based pockels cell Q-switch placed at the output coupler of the core which is directly modulating the Q-factor of the optical resonator itself, the laser radiation emitted at the end of the fiber may be delivered at any quasi-continuous wave frequency of the operator's choosing.  TL;DR - the laser is being switched on and off rapidly at a frequency in the audible range. The action of the cutting or burning produces a small amount of noise at a frequency equal to the frequency of the pulses of light arriving at its surface. The frequency of laser radiation itself is largely irrelevant so long as cutting or burning is occurring.  Even more succinct TL;DR - The same thing is happening here, just with a spark created by electricity rather than laser pulses."

soundporn,2flrt6,piiine,9,Sat Sep 6 03:04:17 2014 UTC,"according to wikipedia:   On 27 August four enormous explosions took place at 05:30, 06:44, 10:02, and 10:41 local time. At 5:30 A.M, the first explosion was at Perboewatan volcano, triggering a tsunami heading straight to Telok Betong. At 6:44 A.M, Krakatoa exploded again on Danan volcano, with the resulting tsunami stretching eastward and westward. The largest explosion, at 10:02 A.M, was so violent that it was heard 3,110 km (1,930 mi) away in Perth, Western Australia, and the Indian Ocean island of Rodrigues near Mauritius (4,800 km (3,000 mi) away), where they were thought to be cannon fire from a nearby ship.[2][3]:22 Each explosion was accompanied by large tsunamis, which are believed to have been over 30 meters (98 feet) high in places. A large area of the Sunda Strait and a number of places on the Sumatran coast were affected by pyroclastic flows from the volcano. The energy released from the explosion has been estimated to be equal to about 200 megatons of TNT,[4] roughly four times as powerful as the Tsar Bomba (the most powerful thermonuclear weapon ever detonated). At 10:41 A.M, a landslide tore off half of Rakata volcano, causing the final explosion.  Final explosive eruption  The pressure wave generated by the colossal fourth and final explosion radiated out from Krakatoa at 1,086 km/h (675 mph).[5]:248 It was so powerful that it ruptured the eardrums of sailors on ships in the Sunda Strait,[5]:235 and caused a spike of more than 2½ inches of mercury (ca 85 hPa) in pressure gauges attached to gasometers in the Batavia gasworks, sending them off the scale.[note 1] The pressure wave radiated across the globe and was recorded on barographs all over the world, which continued to register it up to 5 days after the explosion. Barographic recordings show that the shock wave from the final explosion reverberated around the globe 7 times in total.[3] Ash was propelled to an estimated height of 80 km (50 mi)."

His voice is very effective, as apposed to the one you linked to in your comment where the singer has a much more hurried, excited and whiney tone. Which is certainly not what the composer would have wanted."

soundporn,2cq86y,bcoin_nz,2,Wed Aug 6 06:48:24 2014 UTC,"800%, or 8x, I presume?  According to earslap:   It was generated in a mainframe computer called ASP (Audio Signal Processor) which was able to synthesize the sound in real-time.  It took 20000 lines of C code to write a program that generated the score for the ASP to play. The generated score was consisting of 250000 lines of statements which were to be obeyed by the ASP.   Amazing, since recreating a sound like this on modern VST instruments would not require that much effort at all. The execution, though, is absolutely flawless. Some harmonies tend to appear and disappear, and some pitches seem to change just a little bit. This gives the sound so much more depth and organic feel."

soundporn,2as5t9,VeryTallDog,6,Tue Jul 15 21:23:56 2014 UTC,The turbo blow off valve is acting up because the fuel pump is failing causing the car to lose power and the blow off valve to open up. You can see the car shake pretty violently when it makes the tktktktk sounds.
soundporn,2as5t9,encaseme,0,Wed Jul 16 00:46:44 2014 UTC,"Fuel pump has nothing to do with the blow off valve sound - it would sound this way with fully functional fuel pumps.   BoV opens when he lifts off the throttle, which results in the noise."

soundporn,2as5t9,public_persuader,0,Wed Jul 23 21:00:51 2014 UTC,The troublesome fuel pump is causing a loss of full power to the motor; thus backpressure needs to be relieved. Thus the blow-off valve is going crazy.

soundporn,29v5qg,Sventertainer,1 point,Sat Jul 5 08:14:15 2014 UTC,Is the sound really that crackle-y and sharp in person?
soundporn,29v5qg,Sventertainer,3,Fri Jul 11 03:03:35 2014 UTC,"Yes, but remember, each of those clapping sounds feels like the report of a gun.  You feel it in your chest.  You feel it shaking the ground under your feet.  You hear it echoing off landforms around you.  The sound completely overwhelms you.  You stare into the sky at that small thing rising on a column of fire and you simply can't make yourself believe it could be making that much noise.  Then it rises a bit, and the engines are more directly pointing at you.  Even though the ship is hurtling away from you, the sound gets LOUDER.  How the damn thing didn't spontaneously evaporate into dust from the sound energy alone, seemed impossible to me at the time.  Think about watching a youtube video of a gun firing.  You hear ""pop pop pop"" on the audio clip, and that is really the sound when you are up close.  But each pop is concussive and overwhelming in a way the video can't capture."
soundporn,29v5qg,Ghostleviathan,1 point,Fri Jul 11 07:20:43 2014 UTC,"Wow, I really hope to see a rocket launch in person one day. So sad that the shuttle program ended.   That's something I rarely remember when watching videos online, and I can imagine the sound pressures from a few times at band camp where the full band and drumline were inside crammed into one band hall. Bass drum warmups reverberated in our lungs and made breathing feel weird. I imagine a shuttle launch would be that but with the knob turned from bass drum sound(5-ish) all the way up to 11."
soundporn,29v5qg,n5corp,1 point,Fri Jul 11 08:10:41 2014 UTC,just rewatched the video and had a thought.  The mic is overloading due to the shockwaves.  The result is a crackling transient after each clapping sound.  You don't hear those transients in person.

soundporn,29ecn8,evening_raga,2,Mon Jun 30 15:59:04 2014 UTC,"its more about feeling and movement rather than a structured time keeping   Well, it has aspects of both. The traditional North Indian performance is split in two between time keeping and not. There is a style of Indian music called Dhrupad which is very slow and focuses on lack of rhythm and is fully improv. Heres an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co5iWkbj-SM It is very much about feeling and movement and not concerned with rhythm. There is also a fast style called Khyal which is very much concerned with keeping time and focuses heavily on rhythmic cycles and 'playing with time' so to speak, by dividing up the rhythms. Its very mathematical:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOP4kIb8pBE"

soundporn,29cpcp,nidalmorra,5,Sun Jun 29 16:25:15 2014 UTC,"The oboe cannot be tuned like the other instruments - it's stuck in the pitch it was originally made at. If you adjust the reed, the playability of the instrument is compromised.  This means if the oboe is slightly out of tune, the rest of the orchestra (other than piano/tuned percussion) can tune to the oboe, instead of just the oboe being out of tune. Oboe often has large solos and features in the orchestral repertoire, so it needs to sound in tune!"

soundporn,2882ys,ForceBlade,3,Mon Jun 16 05:01:23 2014 UTC,I know that the purpose of a transformer is the change the output voltage/amps and that it does this with wire wrapped around a transformer core. But How exactly does it make this noise?
soundporn,2882ys,iLurk_4ever,2,Mon Jun 16 06:48:51 2014 UTC,"There's a relationship between current, magnetic field, and physical movement. If you have two then the third will be produced, this is the principle upon which motors and generators work. Transformers pass alternating current and generate a magnetic field, thus the whole thing shakes at (in this case) 60Hz."

soundporn,283jpm,sinisterspud,2,Sat Jun 14 01:52:49 2014 UTC,Yeah. Very cool.
soundporn,283jpm,LintGrazOr8,8,Sat Jun 14 09:48:04 2014 UTC,"I'm curious if this is the actual sound it makes.   Theoretically, if you were to place a neutron star somewhere on earth, would you hear this exact sound? Or is this sound just an interpretation by the space craft of different type of waves given off from the star?"
soundporn,283jpm,3genav,21,Sat Jun 14 04:03:38 2014 UTC,"On mobile so I can't link to sources, but to answer your question: no, this isn't a true sound. It is the translation of radiation waves into audio waves.  Obviously, in space no one can hear you pulse.  Assuming that the star could be placed in some medium that would transmit sound waves without falling into the star's immense gravity (several hundred times that of our own star), and also assuming that the medium wouldn't immediately combust due to the ridiculous forces attempting to rip it apart at the molecular level, then we would hear something similar!  For a fraction of a second anyway. Then the sonic forces would turn your entire body into a fine, bloody mist much like a cube of Jello in a turbine engine."
soundporn,283jpm,SomethingIntangible,5,Sat Jun 14 12:19:35 2014 UTC,"Obviously, in space no one can hear you pulse.   Lol, my thoughts exactly. Nice post, man."
soundporn,283jpm,ForceBlade,4,Sun Jun 15 13:54:54 2014 UTC,I guess you would vaporize or something. That is why I don't understand how the sound has been identified. Unless by radar or some..thing..

soundporn,281a5t,LeartS,10,Fri Jun 13 20:52:22 2014 UTC,"It's a mechanical switch and yes, it is expected to do what it does. They are (obviously) disconnecting a high voltage line. Not something that is done a daily basis but has to be done to enable repairs for instance.  What happens is that at first, when the two parts of the switch are close to each other a spark is formed, pretty normal and you can see it happen with much lower voltages. What follows is more interesting though; as the arc is formed the air around it is ionized, it basically breaks down into bare molecules with added charges so O2 becomes O with an extra electron. Air doesn't conduct electricity but ions do and that's what let's the arc grow so long and extend beyond the switch into the air. It also rises up because the air/ion are extremely hot around the arc so they rise upwards."
soundporn,281a5t,L4NGOS,1 point,Sat Jun 14 22:49:16 2014 UTC,"Judging from the arms moving apart at the beginning, it looks like some sort of safety feature or kill switch. I'm not sure, but I'm very curious."

I dunno for sure though, you'd need to ask a electrical/power engineer"

Google a cross section of a turbine engine and imagine the difficulty of fishing a screw out. Fishing a screw out would likely require taking entire engine apart. So that's why he says it is something you never want to hear I believe. Let me know if this is confusing, I'm quite drunk right now and could have butchered this. However,I am an experienced mechanical engineer that should be able to answer your question while sober."
soundporn,280tbw,hi_my_name_is_idgaf,6,Fri Jun 13 03:14:39 2014 UTC,"Greetings /r/soundporn!  Thank you /r/hi_my_name_is_idgaf for posting this, I too think its prime time for us to start taking a little more control of this subreddit.   A few things I want to reiterate and get out there:    First as /u/Mariospeedwagen mentioned there is a post in /r/redditrequest made by /u/SomethingIntangible requesting control of this subreddit and we have a few redditors who have volunteered to be moderators of this sub.     Start spreading the word about us! If you find a video with a cool sound in it, comment ""/r/soudnporn"" (or something like that) in the comments, and if not already reposted, feel free to yourself!   Please do! We are working to bring a wider variety of content to /r/soundporn, although we love the sound of engines and rockets that kind of content has taken over this sub the past few days and it might be wearing on some of the subscribers who are not as into that kind of stuff. So for the meantime I think its best that we temporarily hold off on posting that kind of stuff. In the future we are planing to integrate some kind of filter system, like some other subreddits have such as /r/science, this way subscribers can filter out the soundporn they don't want to hear/see.       General suggestions for acceptable/un-acceptable posts and content + general etiquette + posting guidelines(if any)   /u/hi_my_name_is_idgaf is right we need some ground rules for submissions. Lets start compiling a set of rules.   Please make rule/etiquette suggestions and I will edit them in here.  Rules(what we have so far):  1) NSFW content of any kind/type is not allowed.  2)Youtube submissions with sound other than the soundporn in question must have an appropriate time code. (If you don't know how to do this here is a helpful how to or you can use this web app)  3) Basic reddiquette should be observed, downvote if something takes away from the discussion/sound/overall point of the sub. I mean, it's nice to say this, even though it's not really able to be enforced, but it would be nice to have an established community where we're not just attacking others and farming karma as it were. That being said if you feel a reason to downvote something or are annoyed by something on the sub, comment about it! Changes only happen via communication!  4) No racism, pointless slandering, attacking of others, and so on. Let's try to build a helpful community that doesn't attack, but listens and instructs, even in the case of those breaking rules, to an extent.    In the meantime please upvote this post so that it becomes more visible on the sub front. Also please, please make suggestions for /r/soundporn rules, etiquette, etc. as well as obeying the ones that get suggested  -Knox"
soundporn,280tbw,KnoxButler,3,Fri Jun 13 05:33:29 2014 UTC,"Replying to the top level comment to keep things organized; in general I think NSFW posts should be part of the disallowed posts, considering /r/soundporn has the possibility of being a rather large general/catchall sub."

soundporn,280tbw,n5corp,1 point,Fri Jun 13 06:14:39 2014 UTC,"Regarding filters for posting; I think it's a nice idea to have quite a few filters once in place, from specific interests like auto, aero, samples, and so on to larger ones such as as physics, nature, humans, etc.  Bad idea or too much until the sub is larger?  Note I'm commenting a lot because I want to hear what the community has to say!"
soundporn,280tbw,n5corp,4,Fri Jun 13 06:10:39 2014 UTC,"I think implementing filters is a good idea but might be a little pointless until the sub gets a little larger and filled with a little more content. But there is no harm in starting to take suggestions from the community on what filters they would like to see. Should I make an additional list in my comment above for filter suggestions?

They actually have to take the time to check out each request, keep that in mind.    It seems like the few folks interested in requesting it are nice and so on so even if it's not accepted this time we each can make a request once every 30 days anyway, so I trust /u/SomethingIntangible will keep us interested parties up to speed in any case.   I'd be surprised if it was denied considering it's becoming active and the only mod deleted his account.  At this point we just gotta wait."

Play the slightly flat E with C below and the G above, and you get a perfectly in tune C major chord. Granted these notes they create are quiet, but they're there, but only when you're in tune, of course. The volume of overtones and undertones varies depending on the timbre of the instruments/voicing used. For example, an oboe's timbre and tone are pretty laser-like, which means there aren't many other vibrations aside from the original note being played which restricts the volume of these overtones and undertones, but a french horn or trombone for example, have more ""open"" tones, which means they produce more vibrations (partly due to the lower pitch of the instrument, partly due to the materials of the instrument), allowing for louder over/undertones. So in this video, the voicing is 4 male voices, which are low(er than women's typically), allowing loud over/undertones (in this case you hear an octave G undertone). It helps that they're really fricken good at singing ."

soundporn,27whzo,robostoph,5,Wed Jun 11 19:46:46 2014 UTC,"+100,000 videos on YouTube can't all be hoaxes, surely... I wonder if someone can explain for us what this could be... Whatever it is, it sounds awesome!"
soundporn,27whzo,Lagahan,2,Wed Jun 11 20:00:21 2014 UTC,"I genuinely want to know what causes it, fake or illerminertey lol, just because it sounds so cool."
soundporn,27whzo,VaHaLa_LTU,2,Thu Jun 12 16:03:08 2014 UTC,"A bit late on an answer here, but I do recall some of these videos coming up maybe 3 years ago. A couple of months later someone figured out that many of the sounds from those videos are pretty much identical to the ""sounds of God"" from a movie ""Red State"" (a pretty mediocre movie at that). Which in turn suggested that it was simply some clever marketing thing.  I don't exactly remember the old video sounds, but these do seem to be similar, so this might be hinting at a sequel or something."
