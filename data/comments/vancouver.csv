vancouver,3dqtvl,Hawkeye077,38,Sat Jul 18 21:25:44 2015 UTC,"This article does a great job of covering every possible factor in the housing crisis we are experiencing. However, there is a few problems.  First, what is an 'artificially low' interest rate? This country is currently sliding into a recession and the Bank of Canada has prudently lowered rates to combat this. It's true, this is not going to help Vancouver housing prices, but a 'solution' which makes a minor recession into a major one is not a solution. In fact, failing to lower interest rates now may simply mean that we have to lower them more later (see Sweden for this).  Tightening up mortgage requirements isn't a bad idea, but these people still need to live somewhere. What are they going to do, jump into our roomy rental market? Rentals are already at a sub 0.5% vacancy rate, which is a strong indicator that this isn't just a home-ownership problem, as the author might suggest.  What we have is a housing problem, and that includes rentals. There simply isn't enough places to live. This is also the flaw is in his argument that you need to count immigrant capital, not numbers. Okay, well sure a bunch of rich foreigners can bid up some prices, but 45,000 can't cause a housing shortage. They still only take that many houses, no matter how expensive. And if they are truly buying up coal harbour, even better. 1000's of investors are taking up only a small piece of city land.  Do foreigners have a right to buy property here? Of course not, it's up to us. However, at what point do immigrants become Canadians? I suspect truly foreign buyers are a minority, while Canadians with foreign money are the majority. Either way, this money drives the Vancouver economy, we should think twice before cutting it off. And preventing Canadians from buying property here is not within our rights in any case.  Ultimately, we don't control whether rich foreigners want to move here, the Bank of Canada interest rate or the CMHC. Blaming all these things is just tantamount to saying '""it's someone else's fault"". We need to take some responsibility for our own mess a look at what is really causing a housing shortage - a lack of houses.   The zoning requirements he briefly mentions keep most of Vancouver hilariously sparsely populated, and prevent density being added. Upzoning the city would allow us to built enough houses to meet actual demand, something we have consistently failed at. This is artificial and under our control. Rapid transport reduces traffic and makes farther areas more accessible, allowing the population to be more spread out. And property taxes are too low - increasing property taxes directly hits the capitalized value of the home causing a decrease in price. Let's even do one better and use a land value tax that incentives good land use. These reforms are significant, sensible and completely opposed by the homeowners currently making millions at everyone else's expense. They want you to blame foreigners and the Bank of Canada, because it keeps us distracted from the real problem, which is much closer to home.   Fortunately, even if the author doesn't go far enough, he nails the landing,    The aforementioned policies (or lack of policies) have made existing homeowners incredibly wealthy, while most everyone else is permanently priced out of the market. This wealth hasn’t been created – it’s been transferred from the future to the present. Robust wealth is created through business and innovation. As our stagnant job market shows, we are not becoming wealthier – and with leagues of young, educated people leaving the city, it is on a path of decline. We have mortgaged its future, and the future of younger generations, to pad the coffers of today’s property owners."
vancouver,3dqtvl,TerbetsColphen,5,Sat Jul 18 17:52:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, well sure a bunch of rich foreigners can bid up some prices, but 45,000 can't cause a housing shortage. They still only take that many houses, no matter how expensive.   45,000 (a very conservative estimate from available information) foreign millionaires in a city with a population of 600,000 is a very significant number.  Also, it is not as though anything is limiting them, or even non-investor immigrants (true foreign buyers), on the number of properties they are able to purchase.  So the number of homes purchased could easily be double or triple that, or even more.  At what point does it severely impact the housing prices and availability for the city/region?  I don't think the term 'housing shortage' was used in the article once.  The issue raised was housing affordability.  If people who live, work, and pay taxes in Vancouver are competing in a housing market that allows unmitigated and untracked foreign capital, that's the problem.  And the results have been clear.  An average house price in Vancouver that essentially unaffordable for anyone who makes a living here.      However, at what point do immigrants become Canadians?   When they start living here, working here, and paying taxes here.  That would be a start.  Right now tax records show that some of the wealthiest areas in the GVRD have absentee homeowners who report little or no income to the CRA.      I suspect truly foreign buyers are a minority, while Canadians with foreign money are the majority.   I agree with you here.  Although nobody has the data to prove one way or the other.  Also, I'm assuming you are able to make a distinction between a Canadian who has immigrated to Canada to live and work here and someone who holds a Canadian passport but also holds citizenship in another country, and in fact earns their money there and primarily resides there and only uses Canada as a place to buy property and possibly send their children to be educated before they return to their home country.      Either way, this money drives the Vancouver economy, we should think twice before cutting it off.    I would be very interested to see some data to back this up.  Apart from the construction, development, and real estate industries, I have never seen a compelling argument for how untaxed foreign capital flowing into real estate purchases drives the Vancouver economy.  If you look to Wikipedia it lists the main components of the local economy as International Trade, Tourism, Technology, Film, Banking and Finance, International Relations, and Aviation.  And that is not to mention Agriculture, Forestry, Manufacturing, Mining, Natural Gas, Energy, Fishing, and other economies throughout the lower mainland and province.  If you can draw a direct correlation between foreign capital in real estate and a significant benefit on those industries, I would be very interested to read it.  The majority of the analysis I have seen highlights how the increased cost of housing is a detriment to the local economy as it increases the mortgage debt incurred by people who buy homes here, leaving less discretionary income to be spent in the local economy; and that the high cost of housing both drives away young talent, and makes it difficult to recruit talent from other cities.   Ref:   Vancouver as a City Region in the Global Economy ""Housing affordability and limited, relatively expensive child care are major barriers to retaining and attracting talent, particularly those starting families.""  Vancity - Help wanted: salaries, affordability and the exodus of labour from Metro Vancouver ""Metro Vancouver’s future growth is dependent on the availability of high-quality labour, which is now threatened by the rapid increase in the cost of living, driven primarily by unaffordable housing. Millennials are the next generation of workers and are highly educated and very mobile. Up to 93 per cent of Millennials plan to own a home sometime in the future. Metro Vancouver’s housing crisis will motivate this group to migrate away in search of better opportunities, leading to a labour crisis.""  Vancouver home price surge worries businesses as they seek to hire, retain staff  ""Government data shows the migration of 25 to 44-year-olds out of Vancouver to other provinces has outpaced those migrating in from elsewhere in Canada over the past three years, eroding a key working-age demographic.  ""Housing prices are a concern for that exact reason,"" said Ken Peacock, chief economist at the Business Council of British Columbia. ""It makes it more challenging for younger people starting a family.""  Vancouver's expensive housing also makes it tough for companies to bring in new talent from other regions, in particular senior executives, he noted.""  So when it comes to increased home prices, it's not that this untaxed foreign capital flooding into the housing market is driving the Vancouver economy, it's that it's threatening to derail it.      And preventing Canadians from buying property here is not within our rights in any case.   I agree with this.      Ultimately, we don't control whether rich foreigners want to move here, the Bank of Canada interest rate or the CMHC. Blaming all these things is just tantamount to saying '""it's someone else's fault"".   We don't control who wants to move here, but we can control who owns homes here and require that home ownership be linked to living and paying taxes in Canada.  That would encourage people who are genuinely interested in immigrating to Canada and prevent those who only want to buy property to stash money, hedge their assets, or launder money.  Since you've clearly thought a lot about this issue and took the time to type out a meaningful comment, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts and response on this.  Do you disagree on these points, or are these aspects just something you hadn't previously considered / researched?  If you have unbiased data and research that counters my contentions I am very interested to read it."

vancouver,3dqtvl,animalchin99,22,Sat Jul 18 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"Here is a map that was posted to this sub recently, I think it's reasonably accurate.  The obstacles are political, the city has full power to determine zoning. I think a lot of people see condos going up in very high priced areas and neighbourhoods changing, and make the connection backwards - that these condos are causing the prices and changes, not the other way around. Usually, they call this gentrification. Second, they see huge developer profits and don't like that. However, preventing development counter-intuitively increases developer profits because they can sell for more money, so it's kind of a silly cycle. A lot of people simply don't want change. They want the community to stay the same as it has always been, regardless of what is happening outside. This basically makes it impossible for any openly pro-development politician to be elected. Additionally, any zoning change is subject to community meetings, where local residents staunchly oppose pretty much everything. These aren't a bad idea in theory, but the problem is while local residents are well represented, the interests of the population as a whole are not. So they inevitably end up slowing development. Worse, these sort of obstacles ensure that only super well-connected, well-funded developers can build anything -forget the concept of a small scale developer.   I've tried to be relatively neutral up to here, but I will add my personal opinion: many people understand perfectly well that opposing density means their homes become more valuable. They are motivated by money and don't care what it means for the poor, the young or the city.  That said, we are slowly doing it, for example the Cambie corridor. Unfortunately, we are barely keeping up, never mind making progress. Here is a great article if you are interested in the subject."

You make some good points but what makes you think opposing density makes your house worth more? Vancouver's most tear-downs are all based on land value, and land prices are so high because of the appetite for developers looking to densify. Contrast that with somewhere like SF where upzoning is pretty much illegal, a 900sqft condo runs pretty much the same price as a 900sqft SFH.  I agree with most of the rest of what you're saying, I just think we won't get anywhere just by liberalizing land-use, you need to address the other political issues or you'll just get more rich investors bidding up houses they think they can eventually flip to well-connected developers."

vancouver,3dqtvl,boop-boop-a-doop,3,Sun Jul 19 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how people think rezoning would harm existing owner's equity. In Vancouver prices are pretty much entirely based on the land value, and rezoning your land for higher density increases its value."
vancouver,3dqtvl,animalchin99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:30:06 2015 UTC,I concur. You'd think it'd be a win-win.
vancouver,3dqtvl,Logisch,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go that far. Seeing a bunch of higher-density, affordable development would be a good thing, but upzoning doesn't automatically make that happen, especially given that we're already densifying faster than most other major North American cities. What I think we've been seeing with our already relatively pro-density approach is that future earning potential gets priced into land values, which just increases the price of any existing housing that could be redeveloped for more density. I think political initiatives that would lower land values like a land value tax, higher development fees or even higher property taxes would do more for affordability than a blanket up-zoning."
vancouver,3dqtvl,bramathon3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:52 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me adding, regarding the political obstacles, there is in addition  incentives/policies that the city hall allows developers in some buildings; while it benefits the developers through less risk and higher profits, it negatively affects the community. For instance when they waivers the developers need to build parking spaces, as far as I am aware that is still rare, but the nonetheless its still adds uneasiness among community coupled with how the city rezones from low to high. It seems vancouver's development isnt going to go from low to medium then to high, rather its low to high in many places. A large part of that yellow area should be row housing or town homes but in many ways that is a systemic failure of past municipals governments in failing to recognize the impact of a growing city.   Also there is view cones, which I think is ridiculous."
vancouver,3dqtvl,Logisch,4,Sat Jul 18 20:15:22 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me adding   Always welcome!  I completely agree and I tried to briefly touch on that with the 'well-connected developer' bit. The current situation only allows for large scale, high profit development, and the restrictions ensure only the well-connected can participate. I think that small scale local development creates some of the most diverse and valued neighbourhoods, but the irony of the anti-development movement is that we basically made such neighbourhoods illegal.  My one bone to pick is that parking requirements are one of the exact zoning requirements that prevent density. I see no reason parking should be treated any differently than other amenities such as pools and gyms. If people want parking, they can pay the extra cost (which is a substantial 30-50k per unit). If I don't drive, there is no reason I should pay the extra cost for parking. Of course, this shouldn't be something that is only waived for privileged developers, we should eliminate it entirely."

If I don't drive, there is no reason I should pay the extra cost for parking. Of course, this shouldn't be something that is only waived for privileged developers, we should eliminate it entirely.   There is definitely pros and cons of parking within a high zoned area or building. I agree that with no parking you can get more space devoted to the actual development and real usable spaces. Plus it forces the city planners to have a good transportation system in place. I disagree that it should be treated like pools or gyms, those are luxuries that we can do in our spare time whereas driving may be essential to a person for their livelihood. That being said, we are still using too many cars and not everyone is fortunate enough to have a job where they can hop on to the skytrains and be at work in 30 minutes. Or they have kids/family and can't rely on the public transportation system to get little sally and john to whatever kids do these days. So absolutely certain locations should have a partial parking capacity, however if they completely wavier while being great for certain residents and developers, it isn't for those who own a vehicle. Also if you don't have that great transportation nearby this then is passed onto the community since thats where they have to park and drive. In addition I would argue it excludes certain portions of the population groups from wanting to live there. In the end to be honest I don't know how many places were excluded but when I hear that its presented as solution I have doubts on whether it could be done without increasing NIMBY."
vancouver,3dqtvl,Logisch,2,Sat Jul 18 21:21:25 2015 UTC,"Well, there are several cities which have eliminated parking requirements at least for certain areas. The result is that most building have parking anyway. So I think this is something that can be adequately decided by the market - you know if parking is necessary for people they will pay for it. However, we need to accept the reality that there is a significant number of people who don't want/need parking and there isn't any reason to force them to have one. This also really affects low income people, not just car-free hipsters. If someone can't afford a car, they definitely can't afford to pay for a parking spot, but that cost gets added to their rent anyway. Here is a good rundown of the arguments."
vancouver,3dqtvl,bramathon3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"But we don't have ""free parking"". Everything downtown or close to it is paid parking, or underground parking for a grocery store but thats customer only. We also don't have giant parking lots in downtown like in many cities, LA, St. Louis, and a lot of the southern metropolitan. Parking along the side is at least free during or weekends but those are fairly rare and are becoming rarer.  Canada in general as been way more progressive with regards to highways, cars, and parking compared to our neighbors in the South. Vancouver voted against having a highway run through in the 50s since they were worried it would bring in too high of a demand. Now Vancouver is trying to be car free by whatever date, I can't remember 2020 or something.  That article has merit and is applicable for the states but in a way its outdated in Canada as we are already implemented many of those findings. I know, including a fair amount of my friends, that we have to pay for a car spot in our condos. I thought that was fairly standard practice in Vancouver. People who do own are usually paying more than those who don't in the end. I personally don't have a car here as I do find it too expensive and I am fine as of now to use the public transit. but my personal take is that high density should have some or at least up to half of the units of parking I am not advocating for a 1:1 relation but when its 0:1 then that is too far in the extreme. If this was a city with a well establish transits (vast metros or underground) things would be different.  I would love the European city feel, Montreal is probably the closest city in Canada to that feel. Vancouver is close but we lack that medium density."
vancouver,3dqtvl,oilernut,2,Sun Jul 19 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"You can safely ignore the parts that aren't relevant to Canada, I was mostly referring to the parts about parking requirements. I don't feel this is a large issue in the core, where the cost of a parking spot is a minor part of the condo and parking is treated as a valuable commodity. But in the inner city it definitely is - when starting a small business or trying to build a small apartment, it can be a real show stopper.  The part I don't understand is why we should legislate the amount of parking. Isn't this exactly the sort of thing the market is perfect at deciding? In any case, any change that allows a more nuanced approach to parking requirements would be a good idea imo. I think we can agree there.   Montreal is probably the closest city in Canada to that feel   Yup, a lot of my opinions come from living in Montreal for years, where there has been a much different approach. It's worth noting that some of the city's best neighbourhoods (Plateau, Mile End, most of East Montreal really) would not be possible to build under modern parking requirements."

It's not like the whole city needs to become tall condo towers either, to allow small 3 floor multi family buildings accross the city. To even replace a single house with a small apartment that can house say 5-10 units would be a fantastic improvement. But it has to be on a huge scale for it to really make a difference, the slow rezoning that occurs just is never going to be good enough. Of course it's not just Vancouver either, the same thing has to happen all accross the metro."
vancouver,3dqtvl,animalchin99,5,Sat Jul 18 20:00:30 2015 UTC,"There is actually a fairly good argument that it is better to do it all at once, rather than piecemeal. Basically the argument is that upzoning a small piece of land affects people around it pretty substantially in the terms of the change in their neighbourhood, new residents blah blah. Upzoning everywhere at once however, means that the change to any small community is relatively small. I think this is what we need to do, especially to get that sort of nice, family friendly, but reasonably high density housing."
vancouver,3dqtvl,Serenity101,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:49:25 2015 UTC,"Upzoning the city would allow us to built enough houses to meet actual demand, something we have consistently failed at.    What evidence do you have of this, other than prices or the vacancy rate? The region is on pace to build around 700 units per 1000 new residents last time I checked, that's more than most of the more affordable major North American cities. Even if household formation is under 2 we seem to be building enough to absorb our growth projections, but maybe we're building the wrong type of units or too many are being left vacant."

vancouver,3dqtvl,TerbetsColphen,3,Sat Jul 18 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"Canadians are restricted from buying property in countries like ... China.   But this false. This is a myth that keeps getting repeated in this subreddit. Canadians can and do buy property in China; you are not banned from doing so. First, in China property ownership is handled on the local government level -- i.e., with the exception of a few sensitive boarder areas, ""China"" doesn't restrict anything on the housing level: individual cities do. City have a lot more autonomy in China than ones in Canada where the province imposes a strong top down control of the cities. Yes, some cities have barred foreigners from owning property but for the most part they don't. I split my time between Suzhou and Vancouver. If I wanted to I could buy a house here as long as I had lived here at least 1 year. Yes, I am limited to buying just 1 house in this city but for the most part so are the locals (though this restriction was eased a bit last year for locals -- emphasizing locals, locals generally can't buy in city you don't have hukou in, but that's not always the case). Second, if I got the equivalent of a permeant residence status here, I would be considered in the same category as locals and be able to buy housing in the few cities that restrict foreign ownership.   Often you seen articles in the Western media saying ""China does X"". But 90% of the time that's bad reporting. China is best understood as a loose federation of semi-autonomous city states. Rarely does ""China"" do anything. Laws and regulations vary from city to city to a degree that is just need in a western state. Then again you're spanning a massive gamut from hyper-developed east coast cities to dirt poor cities in the west and everything in between. It would be pretty much impossible to govern in a uniform federal system.  NB: all property is owned by the state, you are buying a lease of the land and not the land itself."

vancouver,3dqtvl,freedrone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"Just to confirm, this 1 house limitation is in a china city? Suzhou   Yes. But it's common to most of the rich east coast cities. Though when the market started to soften last year some of them raised the limit to 2. People do get around it buy putting ownership in other family member's names.   So SOME cities in China do bar foreign ownership then and your just are clarifying that it isn't a blanket statement to all of china?    There were 3 goals I was trying to achieve:   Debunk the often repeated blanket statement in this subreddit that China as a whole doesn't allow foreign ownership. Often in the western media when one small hick town bans something it gets reported as ""China bans X"". It would be like if media headlines reported ""America bans the teaching of evolution"" because some county in the middle of Kentucky banned teach of evolution in school. This sort of restriction just isn't a common thing. Saying ""foreigners are restricted"" is very different from saying ""everyone is restricted"". Property markets tend to be very highly regulated. In general, though there are lots of exceptions, the rule is once you are resident of a city, i.e., have your hukou if a Chinese citizen or lived a year in China and registered with the PSB of the city if a foreigner, you can usually buy 1 house. And by ""buy"" I mean lease as all land is owned by the state. This is the case in most of the well developed east coast cities. These are also the hardest to get hukou in because they are were everyone wants to move to.  Point out that if your D Visa (aka ""permanent residence"" or ""green card"") then you are exactly the same a local (i.e. someone with hukou) for the city you're resident in.   In short, the restrictions here are nothing like those in the other countries cited. To put them together as the author does is at best ignorant and at worst just straight up dishonest.    Then the articles point that, there exists restrictions elsewhere, but not in Vancouver is still valid, no?   If anything, the case for restriction is hurt by how they have played out China. In the developed east coast Chinese cities there is a housing affordability crisis the likes of which Vancouver has never seen. The restrictions have done little to nothing to make things more affordable. It just creates hassle and makes rent more expensive and thereby making life on lower income peoples much worse. Which is why companies often have to build dormitories for junior staff here.     Then again, perhaps spending time here makes it hard for me to feel sympathy for people complaining about affordability in Vancouver. Imagine if the prices for condos were roughly about the same but the house hold income was half to a quarter what it is in Vancouver. That's the situation here."

'Red Tape',    While China is definitely more bureaucratic, it is not a hostile bureaucracy. The large bureaucracy's goal not to make your life hard, quiet the opposite. With the strong growth targets imposed on them, they are quiet helpful.   lack of transparency,    I don't get think complaint. Yes, we don't have great insight into what is happening in Zhongnanhai but frankly it doesn't affect things on the ground too much. In China the local level matters more to the day-to-day and they are usually pretty transparent. Plus China has a well functioning court system. Albeit the legal system does work differently than Common Law, it does work.   language barriers,    Oh horror! It's a country that doesn't have English as it's official language. Clearly they are evil!  Again, there are more then enough people who will eagerly help you with that.   corruption,    It's hard to understate just how much China has cleaned up corruption. Yes, there is a way to go but good progress has been made. Chinese corruption is on par with Spain, Brazil, and South Korea. It's better than Mexico, India, any FSU country, and almost all of Africa, South America, and SEA. Yup, it has a long way to go to get to Canada levels. It's doing well for a developing country.    xenophobia    Really? Where? There is far more rabid xenophobia in Vancouver than in the cities I've lived in in China. China and the US have a lot in common -- both have it beaten into them from a young age that they are the best country in the world.  However, China is generally not as hostile to others as the US.   and more over there combine to form a restriction or rather an obfuscation foreigners   Ha! There are more than enough people who will be more than eager to help you get it resolved legally. There are tons of translators, realtors , etc. If anything, given the low prices for the help, it's far easier on a foreigner here that doesn't speak the language than one in Vancouver who doesn't speak English.   And I'm sure you can guess what would happen to the rules overnight in China if foreigners started ' buying up' properties in droves and locals began to accuse them for higher prices.   That's not really relevant to the discussion at hand. You're playing at counterfactuals. Largely because China wouldn't do anything. This is the realm of local governments. To even begin to respond to your counterfactual, I would need to know if hukou reform had happened or not.  China just isn't that scary of a place."

vancouver,3dqtvl,badwolf,-2,Sat Jul 18 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"You have to reside in China for 1 year, Canada has no such restriction.   The point is compared to Chinese citizens not really a big difference. If you do not have hukou in a city you cannot generally buy houses in it either. Note: mostly applies to larger eastern cities. It is much easier for a foreigner to establish residence than the average Chinese citizen to establish hukou in the popular east coast cities. Making it much easier in practice for foreigners to buy property than Chinese citizens. Of course, if a Chinese citizen has hukou in a city then it's very easy for them to buy. So unless you're suggesting we block Canadians who haven't lived for say 6 months or so in Vancouver from buying property in Vancouver then the author is misusing China as an example here.    Also, becoming a Chinese PR is significantly more difficult than a Canadian. Especially with the previous IIP.   Yes and no. If you go the professional path you have to reside in China 3 of the last 4 which is harder than someone coming to Canada with the right skills but easier than someone coming to Canada for family reasons. If you go the investor path, you just need to have US$500k of registered capital in the country. This means that the investor path to your D Visa (aka ""permanent residence"" / ""green card"") is a lot cheaper than the IIP was: i.e., no loan to the government required."

Which cities are first tier is a big debate and people really only agree on BJ and SH. Guangzhou isn't really considered first tier anymore and has been generally replaced by Tianjin and Chongqing most lists done in the past 5 years. Hell, some are even calling Hangzhou first tier now.   Suzhou is 2nd tier but in practical terms it's often consider 1.5 tier. If we were to apply Chinese style tiering to Canada then Vancouver is very much a 2nd tier city. Really only Toronto could be considered 1st tier, though you might be able to make a case for Montreal. I think it's an apt comparison."

In every other housing market, when property values increase to the point that they become unaffordable, the solution is always the same. Build density solutions that leverage land into multiple more affordable parcels. But people in Vancouver honestly seem so obsessed with the price and ability to afford a single family detached home that there is little to no movement on actually building. Almost 0% vacancy rates, extremely high demand for housing, and a sustained seller's market that has persisted for almost an entire generation without relief. That is a perfect storm for pricing people out of the market.  There is no reason areas such as Kits, West Point Grey, even Mount Pleasant are not filled to the brim with family oriented relatively affordable low rise townhouse and condo multi-family developments to sustain housing demand and temper prices. Yet the conversation always revolves around people's obsession with single family detached homes and wanting to own your own land in the tiny city of Vancouver.  No one talks about single family detached homes in Manhattan anymore. Vancouver residents need to focus on the core housing supply issues and work towards creating a holistic balanced market instead of the lopsided sellers market that is persisting."

To implement ornerous new foreign ownership restrictions because of high prices in a few cities would frankly be a bit of a knee-jerk reaction and a major shift in economic policy to a less free and open economy.   This free and open economy now, is resulting in localized Canadians (of all races) to be out priced. Especially when subject free cash offers from thousands of millionaires is in competition.

Every property is owned by someone, it's not like you'd have any more or fewer owners.  Do people move out of London and NYC because they are not rich?  ie, are there young people making careers?  I have a hunch that all young professionals aren't going to just pick up and move out of Vancouver because it's too expensive to purchase.  Certainly some."

vancouver,3dp9k7,wildstarsuperstar,28,Sat Jul 18 05:01:45 2015 UTC,"The only time I've heard this was when the EXP Restaurant spread this around in 2012. From what I've read on here they took everyones money via their Indiegogo campaign and lived up to none of their promises. The reason they aren't allowed video games is something to do with the fact they purchased a restaurant liquor license vs a bar liquor license (more economical.) They turned it into a situation that made them out to be the victim and kept $50k of donations.   Everything in the above paragraph is based on what I've read on Reddit about this.  The owner was all over PR on reddit; https://www.reddit.com/user/BrianOnTheRocks  For my own personal experience I've been to many bars with video games, for example; https://www.facebook.com/events/712417705438006/ https://www.facebook.com/astoria.hastings/  I've never looked into opening a bar, or consulted a lawyer on this matter, but it seems there's some BS to it.

The crucial legal distinction is that these are large bars with smaller pinball sections, and you have to leave the games area and go to the bar or your table to drink. At least that's the case at the bar under the library.  They're rad, but they aren't exceptions to the rule that barred EXP bar from doing what it intended, and the city denied their application to open as a bar with a video games room on the basis that they had already tried to apply as an arcade with a bar in it.

We've all been into them.  My cousin-in-law puts food on his kids' table by managing one.  Once liquor is at Safeway and Save-On, those private liquor stores will all go out of business, people like my cousin-in-law will be out of work and the people who invested their money will rightly scream blue murder.  What the government should have done was put liquor at Safeway from the get-go, instead of these stupid private liquor stores, and still allowed the private stores for 'specialty shops' like Legacy Liquor store."

vancouver,3dp9k7,Aureoloss,5,Sat Jul 18 08:31:27 2015 UTC,"Selection is really only limited on the super micro stuff now. When I was in Oregon last year Walmart had a pretty decent selection of Deschuttes, Ninkasi, New Belgium etc. like ~35+% of beer shelf space was the good stuff. And Trader Joes is like an entire aisle of it. The big stores will stock whatever the local demand will satiate. Same goes for the little ones; they buy what moves. If anything they're less likely to gamble on new stuff."

I get that it would be unfair to fix these things right away, but how about we get started on fixing things for good? The new change for liquor in grocery stores is still hugely flawed because of the ""store inside a store"" model doesn't have any real added benefit.

That way people who have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars have a transition out.  ...and before you say ""A decade is too long!"" let me ask you this: Do you remember 2005?  I sure do, and it was a decade ago.  At the same time, you amend other laws to make things easier for the established businesses - You let private Jar shops be open 24/7, sell cigars & pull tabs etc.  you let a Vancouver cab pick up in Ladner."

Well duh, they aren't going to open stores that don't have demand on Sundays just because some other stores can. That doesn't make any business sense. From the list on that website they are opening a lot of them on Sundays, including ones in towns where I wouldn't necessarily expect the demand for it.  edit: Since I apparently wasn't clear with what I meant. Presumably the BC Liquor store being open on Sundays will reduce the number of customers on other days (mostly Saturday) if they are buying for drinking on Sunday. It will also drive some new customers that either haven't planned ahead and have no other buying options, or those that would have purchased at private liquor stores that were open on Sundays. The new customers are the only ones that matter here, and if there isn't enough business driven due to being open on Sundays then it doesn't make business sense to be open these days. This may indeed be the case with smaller markets where there are few alternate options around.  From the list it looks like a ton of their stores are open Sundays. All the ones I'm familiar with (mostly Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island) are open Sundays, it would be interesting to see which ones aren't open Sundays."

It turns out that hundreds of thousands of British Columbians share that concern – as demonstrated by a SumofUs.org petition signed by 225,000 people, which has now resulted in a BC government commitment to review its water rates.  But former MLA Judy Tyabji is claiming that increasing the water rates could cause BC to lose control over water under NAFTA, and is citing a 1999 West Coast Environmental Law legal opinion in support of her view.  Consequently, we think it’s important to clarify that we agree with SumOfUs that there is room to increase water rates dramatically without running afoul of NAFTA or other trade agreements."

I'm highly suspicious of what they would set as ""a normal amount of usage"" ... average across all households, including the mini-condos & households where no one is home. Someone who grows a veg garden, or maintains any sort of greenery (not talking lawns here), or even has a family would be penalized in comparison. I can also see this baseline usage creeping down over time & while the price creeps upwards.  Relevant comparison maybe: Where does BC Hydro get their numbers for baseline (Step 2 threshold) household usage from ... I've searched & have never been able to establish what type of household these numbers come from. And the price continues its upward climb even if your consumption stays well below baseline."

vancouver,3ds1sa,RunsOverCyclists,-23,Mon Jul 20 01:07:24 2015 UTC,"So, interesting little factoid. Richmond Island next to the Vancouver bus depot on Hudson is actually in Richmond and not Vancouver. However, that being said, Sea Island is managed by the feds, so a bridge wouldn't be a strictly intra city affair...  I wonder how feasible building a short swing bridge might be to help serve the mall. Airport traffic could be dissuaded from using the new bridge by prohibiting right turns off Templeton and Mall traffic could be dissuaded from using the Arthur Laing by restricting right turns onto Templeton.  The area around the foot of the Arthur Laing in Vancouver is industrial,  and very close to Marine Drive at Oak, keeping disruptions to a minimum."

The Briton, for example, has currency worth almost twice the value of our own, and the houses (yes, plural) that they bought appreciated in value of 40% over only two years.   Foreigners - not just Chinese - are buying property here because right now, it's a very hot investment and a good way to make money.

Don't lie like an idiot that we have an innocuous ""we want to know"" situation where we become happy once the government provides the service we demand. The real goal is to restrict demand for Vancouver housing in a way that benefits the ""locals"" (who are mostly from Ontario). Getting data is a route that this particular movement is taking, however if this route doesn't work there will be other routes that we seek until the true goal is reached.   This isn't really about data tracking on behalf of the government, so lets deal with the real issue. We must not forget that every time a foreigner buys a house a local gets paid, and the other people looking to move in still has their money, so this is a net benefit for Canada as a whole.  If Canadians restrict property ownership, the local gets paid less and the Canadian spends all his money, no net gain by Canada. So the movement is asking for a net loss from the current program so that he/she may buy that better home they bid for but didn't get. This isn't a situation where there is a fundamental conflict between those who own homes and those who don't.  Can we please seek a third solution before going this route? It just seems like an easy fix that only delays housing un-affordability for a short period of time, if at all."

vancouver,3dmxja,koncept61,6,Sat Jul 18 01:38:05 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia   The first type of entrapment, ""random virtue testing"", occurs when the police offer an individual the opportunity to commit a crime without reasonable suspicion that either that individual, or the place where that individual is located, is associated with the criminal activity under investigation. If police do have such a reasonable suspicion, they are still limited to providing only an opportunity to commit the offense.   The second form of entrapment occurs when the police go beyond merely providing an opportunity to commit an offense, and instead actually induce the commission of the offense. Some factors a court may consider when deciding whether police have induced the offense include the type of crime being investigated, whether an average person would have been induced, the persistence and number of attempts made by the police, the type of inducement used (e.g. fraud, deceit, reward), and the existence of expressed or implied threats.  The question of entrapment is only considered after there has been a finding of guilt. If, after finding the accused guilty, the court determines that the accused was entrapped, the court will enter a judicial stay of proceedings. In effect, this is similar to an acquittal."

You do the math and tell me you'd do any different.  3) NOT paying would still have the parts taken off and sold for $100+ so your point is moot.   3) The emotional loss of of a bike also has a price that is hard to put a figure on.

But I think it's...important to keep in mind that it really is a few very small tiny fraction of people who are bad and not to paint the entire DTES as something vicious and horrible. Because when we tell our tourists to be careful and when we roll our eyes hearing something bad happening there, we are choosing to believe that 80+% of the citizens there are bad guys as opposed to the truth. When we do that we are choosing to believe ""poor people = bad people"" when in reality a small fraction of any community is bad, rich or poor. Would the officer have also not been robbed strolling around Kits or outside Holt Renfrew? More than likely. Would he have received this kind of concern and love and well wishing? I would not bet on it.   Edit: as part of a school field trip I once had the opportunity to pose as a kid begging on a downtown Toronto street corner. I was invisible to most people. The people who came forward to chat and make sure I was alright were mostly people who dressed like they were also pretty hard up. So, I know there's way more crime in DTES than elsewhere, but I think it is likely a small number of individuals responsible for the vast majority if crime rather than that every ""transient"" looking person there is looking to eat each other alive."

vancouver,3dp3lu,41234,0,Sat Jul 18 18:26:19 2015 UTC,One thing about a fence is that it's a one time purchase (ignoring any maintenance/replacement). You don't need to spend money on an annual basis for a fence unlike mental healthcare. $3.5 million to put up a fence is considerably far more cheaper and more efficient than spending it on mental healthcare if we want to prevent deaths from jumping off the bridge - but if we're looking at the bigger picture it simply isn't efficient. Someone who wants to commit suicide has a large variety of ways of doing it.  tl;dr I agree with you but the fence isn't a horrible idea if you want to specifically only prevent deaths on the bridge and not about city-wide suicide prevention.
vancouver,3dp3lu,MeteoraGB,2,Sat Jul 18 19:52:31 2015 UTC,"Suicide is a funny thing though - you would think that suicidal people would simply find another way, but it doesn't always work out like that. Suicide can often be impulsive and be based upon the immediate availability of a means of death. Many suicidal individuals probably have to cross the Burrard Bridge every day to-and-from work.  Take away the means, and you just might buy enough time for the suicidal individual to come down from their elevated state."
vancouver,3dp3lu,MrMajorMajorMajor,7,Sat Jul 18 20:07:28 2015 UTC,So I guess you believe that a fence should also be built between the side walk and the road? The individual may want to jump in front of a bus since this same individual can't jump off the bridge any more. Let's put up fences everywhere!
vancouver,3dp3lu,westfalia1969,-2,Sat Jul 18 21:33:38 2015 UTC,Isn't this kind of like saying Translink should have used the poodle statue money to pay for the Broadway subway? It seems like a drop in the bucket compared to the massive investment in mental health we really need. You need the band-aid while you wait for stitches.
vancouver,3dp3lu,fitofpica,28,Sat Jul 18 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"A couple of weeks ago some friends and I were on a sailboat about 300 metres west of the Burrard street bridge when a call came over the coast guard radio saying there was a jumper and asking for all vessels to assist.  Took us about 3 mins to get there and when we arrived the jumper was in the water, alive and being held onto and kept afloat by a man in a small dingy. The dingy dragged the jumper to the back deck of s larger powerboat and they pulled him onto their deck. He was moaning and was obviously in a lot of pain.  The powerboat took him to the kits boat launch and where paramedics were waiting.  Lucky guy.  Anyways, the police marine unit was dispatched from Coal Harbour and took 25 minutes to arrive, they showed up after the guy was on shore. 25 minutes, right in front of the of the now closed kits coast guard station...  A 25 minute response time to a marine emergency in the heart of a major city is shameful. I shudder to think about what would happen in a situation that other pleasure craft wouldn't be capable to assist."
vancouver,3dp3lu,iatekane,7,Sat Jul 18 03:28:25 2015 UTC,"One would argue that the Vancouver city services would be better equipped for that sort of situation regardless of what the coast guard are for. While the water is a federal jurisdiction perhaps a better organization of who has what responsibility is in order.    Remember- It's VPD while the jumper is on the bridge, but suddenly it's the Coast Guard's problem if they jump? That's just bad policy."
vancouver,3dp3lu,captmakr,7,Sat Jul 18 05:03:13 2015 UTC,"They don't really divide the responsibilities this way. Point in case: It was the VPD that responded, not the Coast Guard.  ""Responsible"" is whoever arrives at the scene first, unless otherwise negotiated later.  In the described case, the Coast Guard would have been ""first responders"" and in charge of what transpired."
vancouver,3dp3lu,thedarkerside,-2,Sat Jul 18 06:29:06 2015 UTC,Most suicide attempts are a cry for help. If the jumper was really serious he would have jumped off the north end of the bridge onto the concrete adjacent to the Aqua Centre.
vancouver,3dp3lu,W-Ender,26,Sat Jul 18 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"Please, Vancouver, no.  The fence isn't guaranteed to stop a jumper from climbing it.  It isn't guaranteed to stop a would-be jumper from ending his/her life another way.  And the article suggests this only happens once per year anyways.    Spend that part of the bridge budget on mental health assistance, not fences.  I bet that helps several people per year, not just one."
vancouver,3dp3lu,RainbowNowOpen,10,Sat Jul 18 04:18:21 2015 UTC,"TLDR; It's a psychological barrier, not a physical barrier.   The fence isn't guaranteed to stop a jumper from climbing it. It isn't guaranteed to stop a would-be jumper from ending his/her life another way.   A scientific study showed a bridge fence does indeed stop bridge jumpers, and they don't normally go to another jump location.  From the study Preventing suicide by jumping: the effect of a bridge safety fence:   Conclusion  The safety fence was effective in preventing suicides from the bridge. There was no evidence that suicidal individuals sought alternative sites for jumping.   One hypothesis for this result is that when suicidal people see the height of the bridge fence required to climb and jump, they realize that society actually cares about them enough to put up that fence."
vancouver,3dp3lu,RainbowNowOpen,12,Sat Jul 18 05:50:49 2015 UTC,"We could expect the barrier to save one life per year.  Or we could avoid the eyesore to all and divert funds to treat the cause: mental health.  Support the lives of many, maybe including that same jumper."
vancouver,3dp3lu,karkahooligan,-4,Sat Jul 18 06:03:25 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks I accept your apology.  Yes the first part of your argument was wrong - bridge fences do in fact stop suicides - but the second part was right.  Vancouver is severely lacking in resources for the mentally ill.  But the two aren't mutually exclusive.  I think it was a cartoon lobster character who once said ""why not each?""  :)"
vancouver,3dp3lu,RainbowNowOpen,4,Sat Jul 18 06:26:02 2015 UTC,"bridge fences do in fact stop suicides   Reminds me of those cushion barrels they put in front of the concrete bases of highway overpasses and such to stop the number of 'accidents'.  Turns out most were suicides, not accidents, and an increase in different methods, like jumping off bridges, was observed."
vancouver,3dp3lu,meowlolcats,5,Sat Jul 18 07:56:36 2015 UTC,And from the study in the British Medical Journal: Effect of a barrier at Bloor Street Viaduct on suicide rates in Toronto    No study has shown a statistical drop in overall rates of suicide after the construction of a barrier on a bridge It is unclear whether barriers prevent suicides or simply result in people substituting one bridge for another or attempting suicide by other means Suicide rates by jumping were unchanged owing to a corresponding increase in jumps from other bridges and buildings in the area Therefore barriers may not decrease suicide rates when comparable locations are available
vancouver,3dp3lu,Jelly_Cube_Zombie,3,Sat Jul 18 08:46:30 2015 UTC,"From the study:  ""Participants: 14,789 people who completed suicide in the city of Toronto and in Ontario.""  :/  Oh, that study also said: ""This finding suggests that Bloor Street Viaduct may not have been a uniquely attractive location for suicide and that barriers on bridges may not alter absolute rates of suicide by jumping when comparable bridges are nearby... It is well recognised that restricting access to a means of suicide may delay or even prevent suicide among vulnerable people.""  I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the city would get better results from investing in mental health services, but that last sentence does seem to suggest that installing barriers on all relevant bridges could result in a reduction in suicide rates, which is presumably also the rationale behind the 2008 coroners’ inquest which ""recommended such structures on all major bridges"" mentioned in the article.   edit: then there's the other issue, that while a lot of people in this thread might prefer them to spend that money on mental health services instead, the reality is that if they don't add the barrier to the bridge, I don't imagine they're going to increase funding of mental health services in lieu of the barrier."

Paid out of my guts for their services only to find that I could of done better at home. Told them I was dissatisfied, and pointed them to areas that needed improvement. They blew me off and then the owner just left with his Ferrari.  If you don't know how to do a proper wash yourself, try finding a car enthusiast (on Craigslist or something) that does it as a hobby. They're generally cheaper, better quality (because they enjoy what they're doing) and you get to meet a new friend.  Edit: the comment I was replying to got deleted.

EDIT:  That left hand turn onto Hornby is one of my two main gripes with the re-design. I would have loved for them to move the left hand turn to Burrard, there is enough space for a dedicated turn lane.  Likewise, that they will only retain one lane into the Westend that doubles as a right turn lane is annoying. Because with the dedicated bike lane anybody who will try to make a right onto Burrard will be stuck there for the entire cycle. They should have created a pullout for the right hand turn to allow straight traffic to proceed. But I have a hunch they did that on purpose to limit traffic through the Westend to Lionsgate."

Two things to note here:  It's amusing to me how it's a-okay to ask pedestrians or cyclists to make major detours so as to not ""inconvenience"" car drivers, but god behave a car driver has to go around the block. The world comes to an end.  Secondly, I see more and more people actually walk on the east sidewalk, and I get it. If I am on the south-east side of Pacific, in order for me to get across the bridge ""legally"", I would have to walk back a block to Hornby, then cross Pacific, walk back to Burrard, cross Burrard, then go across Pacific again and then I am on the bridge. That'll be what? a 5 - 10 minute detour?  Why is it okay to force pedestrians to do that detour when the proposed changes make it better for everybody?   I don't support the removal of a vehicle lane, since I don't think the improvement to the cyclist/pedestrian lanes will outweigh the impact on traffic.   The limit always was and will be the traffic lights on both ends of the bridge, it's not the number of lanes across the bridge.   Not to mention that you're already down to two lanes anyway (realistically) when going northbound because the right most lane tends to backlog from Hornby, especially when people try to get off the bridge and then make a right onto Hornby (why? The much better way would be to go up to Drake and then get onto Hornby if you have to get there)."

I also look forward to the inevitable tears if they do take away a northbound lane to improve the cyclist experience.  One thing that is going to be necessary sooner rather than later is improving the flow of traffic between the North Shore and the city.  Right now there are a few different ways to get from the Lions Gate to the Burrard or Granville bridges, and none of them are particularly good.  Howe really lacks the capacity to carry all of the traffic we expect it to, and it's only getting worse - but there's no room in downtown to widen any streets"

vancouver,3dnkgf,RunsOverCyclists,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:22:22 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Buses still run down Granville and taxis can use it too. Technically you can't get onto Granville because they don't allow right hand turns onto it, but it's not like a ""do not turn"" sign has ever stopped anybody in the lower mainland from doing it anyway.  EDIT: And anyway. Granville is only ""closed"" to traffic from Robson to Waterfront. The rest of Granville is wide open, so giving another block to cars on Granville is not going to be a huge tradeoff."
vancouver,3dnkgf,NoRegretsCoyote,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:27:26 2015 UTC,so giving another block to cars on Granville is not going to be a huge tradeoff   I have a feeling that if you allowed traffic on that section of Granville (ie - coming off Georgia) that would do absolutely awful things to the flow of bus traffic.
vancouver,3dnkgf,katanaFedora,0,Fri Jul 17 22:42:07 2015 UTC,"Buses? Those are these horrible things that cause traffic congestion, right?   Quite frankly in my ideal world they'd take the buses off of Granville too and put them back where they were during the Canada Line construction, then turn the stretch from Robson to Waterfront into a pedestrian mall (or do it from West Georgia and allow a right hand turn for cars to go across Granville bridge)."

vancouver,3dnkgf,Thatsalotofaxolotls,2,Sat Jul 18 06:25:12 2015 UTC,I semi-regularly see cars go down the stretch between Smithe and Robson and it doesn't seem to be tourists. They then usually turn right onto Robson.  I think I know though which alley you mean though.

vancouver,3dnkgf,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:23:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Look at Toronto's Gardiner Express Way. It literally cuts the core of the city off from it's waterfront.  I am also not a fan of the elevated Skytrain, for similar reasons (though in the case of Skytrain, at least it's honest. It never pretends to be part of the community, it's just passing through on it's way to the next development cluster)."
vancouver,3dnkgf,moosekayak,-1,Sun Jul 19 07:27:08 2015 UTC,"I am also not a fan of the elevated Skytrain   I had thought about mentioning the SkyTrain to you and opted for the viaducts instead. Well, at least you're consistent. A lot of the problem is that access to the Lion's Gate is done through the central business district. Motorists must literally traverse the entire downtown peninsula to access it.  There are solutions of varying efficacy, like building a Waterfront expressway, twinning the Lion's Gate, and yes, elevating portions of road through the core... But those won't happen.  I don't disagree with what you say, but the city needs to get off its high horse and get back to reality when it comes to moving people through the city. Whether that means building a new bridge away from the core or providing access by way of a bypass it's clear that traffic going in and out of the core will never ever have its needs met with a 3 lane counterflow bridge. I don't care how many buses you run across it, how many SeaBuses we add, how many spandex clad cyclists use the sidewalk, or how expensive it gets tolled, at the end of the day, we will never be able to remove enough vehicles to make that bridge's capacity appropriate for what it does.  I think the focus should be on removing downtown from being the central business district instead of just build, build, build and expecting that everyone new person that arrives won't drive a vehicle.  That way, we can justify removing road capacity like with Burrard, Hornby, and Dunsmuir. As it stands, the decision to change those streets while continuing to densify and cause the problems we've seen on them was poorly thought out and done with malice.  Basically, build the Third Narrows, demolish the First Narrows (or turn it into a bus and carpool only bridge), build a Boundary bridge to Richmond, install park and rides at Lonsdale for downtown bound commuters, then have through traffic avoid Vancouver entirely, going around it. Collaborate with Surrey to turn Whalley into the central business district, which has room, freeway connections (soon, a freeflowing orbital ring road!), and rapid transit.  That way, if Vancouver wants to create its cycling utopia and create even less space for cars, they can go ahead and do it without holding back the rest of the region like it is now."
vancouver,3dnkgf,CaesarVercingetorix,3,Sun Jul 19 09:27:43 2015 UTC,"Whether that means building a new bridge away from the core or providing access by way of a bypass it's clear that traffic going in and out of the core will never ever have its needs met with a 3 lane counterflow bridge.    It's not the city who's in charge here, it's the Province they own both Second Narrows and Lionsgate. They need to come up with something, and if you want to bypass things the only option would be a tunnel, because there is simply no place a bridge could unload it's load on either side. Though even building a tunnel will be thought with problems, because if you want to bypass the city from the North Shore you're probably using #1 and Second Narrows anyway to get to #1 and that still has problems, mostly on the north shore.   we will never be able to remove enough vehicles to make that bridge's capacity appropriate for what it does.   How defeatist. Because if you think the only way forward is more cars we're fucked anyway. Feel free to go down to LA and see how many car lanes they have and how shitty their traffic is, or try Atlanta if you really like humidity and there the gridlock isn't just across a chokepoint or two, but across most of their system for most of the day.   I think the focus should be on removing downtown from being the central business district instead of just build, build, build and expecting that everyone new person that arrives won't drive a vehicle.   So you want to do what the US cities did in the 1950s, core out the city and have everybody live in the Suburbs and have two hour commutes to different business parks? How is that any better?   That way, we can justify removing road capacity like with Burrard, Hornby, and Dunsmuir.   Again, the limit never ever is the number of lanes on these roads it's always the limit imposed by traffic control measures (aka traffic lights).  The only way you are going to increase capacity is by removing traffic lights and don't allow any intersections. So if you want to cut the city in half where you have to drive ten blocks to get to a destination that's two blocks away, go for it. Otherwise realize that this will never ever happen, unless you can somehow figure out how to teleport cars across intersections without the need to stop.   That way, if Vancouver wants to create its cycling utopia and create even less space for cars, they can go ahead and do it without holding back the rest of the region like it is now.   You know if you'd take of that passion and channel it to understanding human behaviour and traffic management you may even come up with a workable solution. As it stands right now, the 1950s called and would like to ask you for some advice on how urban planning should be done."

vancouver,3dle9o,nolanrh,5,Fri Jul 17 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"You could build an elevator up to a stop on the bridge, and then replace the parking lots on the island, which would have the effect of generating revenue to fund the access point, and reduce the throng of car traffic on the island that makes it somewhat uncomfortable to walk in areas"

But, as most Moonbeamistas are concerned, it would open up space on the island for condos, less cars, and a few thousand bike parking spots, plus the few hundred thousand in bribes deposited to offshore banks, so win-win-win in their minds."

Find a place with parking (e.g. UBC) and have it done that way.  Won't happen though, if you can't drive there people think the world will come to an end.  This will be an opportunity wasted."
vancouver,3dle9o,thedarkerside,0,Fri Jul 17 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"If you want ""a little life in the evening"" then close the island off to cars, make it pedestrian only and put some more social venues there.  But that's not going to happen because Vancouver still can't let go of the idea that every little piece of the city needs to be driveable.  They do indeed have an opportunity here to do something incredible, but it won't happen because what is lacking in Vancouver is the will to take risks and create environments that aren't either geared towards drivers or profit maximization for the Donnelly's et. al.  And BTW, next time you're on GI, take a walk around and just realize how much of the area of the island is dedicated to cars, either parking or lanes."
vancouver,3dle9o,thedarkerside,4,Fri Jul 17 18:59:40 2015 UTC,I don't think the two options are mutually exclusive.
vancouver,3dle9o,nolanrh,0,Fri Jul 17 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you this: Do you enjoy sitting outside in the summer surrounded by cars? If the answer is no, then no, they are mutually exclusive.  Try travel to Europe some time and see what they have done to their downtown cores / similar areas. The moment you limit car traffic, desirability of the area shoots through the roof. A few years ago Zurich shut down pretty much all of their downtown to car traffic (people living there and deliveries during certain time periods are still allowed). End result is that both retail and restaurants are doing much better business. And yes, they made similar arguments against it as you always hear in Vancouver when there is a ""thread"" of taking a car lane away."
vancouver,3dle9o,thedarkerside,3,Fri Jul 17 19:33:08 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with you.  My point was that it's possible to add residents without getting rid of cars.  Would I prefer both? Yes.  Would people still buy residences there without getting rid of cars? Yes
vancouver,3dle9o,nolanrh,2,Fri Jul 17 21:31:37 2015 UTC,"I see no reason why you would need to build Condos on there. The seawall all around the island already has Condos. What would make this a destination is if it's easy to reach and provides interesting options when you get there. I all for mixed developments, but I don't think GI is the right place for it.

And it does--even without as many of the usual traffic controls (lights, pedestrian crossings) you see everywhere else. Maybe it works because it's Canadian and in laid-back Vancouver, but it works.   Frankly, I think the reason Vancouver has adjusted as well as it has to bike lanes is partly thanks to Granville Island teaching us to chill out when it comes to accommodating other road traffic."
vancouver,3dle9o,burtaexpat,10,Fri Jul 17 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"laid-back Vancouver   Every time I hear this I wonder what Vancouver you live in and what Vancouver I live in.   Vancouver has to be the most stressed and image conscious Canadian city I've live in (and I've live in Montreal, Toronto, and Calgary in the past!) One of the latter two should easily be the more high strung city depending on what stereotypes and negative ideas you have about what people in those cities are like.  Here in Vancouver, most of my coworkers are angry and bitter people, just about everyone else I interact with seems a little pissed off about something and definitely not really happy to live in ""The Best Place on Earth."" The only people I know who are happy with the city are some friends of my parents who bought houses in Dunbar and Kits back in the 70s and 80s and have recently sold them for 2-5 million a piece and now have a ton of time and money on their hands.  So in general, I think it might be due to the severe imbalance between incomes and cost of living in the city causing people to freak out as their financial lives suck more with each day."

vancouver,3diwfl,VelvetJustice,41,Thu Jul 16 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"Most of these fires are in remote locations, good luck enforcing that."
vancouver,3diwfl,InALaundryRoom,12,Thu Jul 16 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"Not about enforcement.  Much like Bike helmets.   If 100% of the population knows it's illegal,  90% will comply.    90% less people throwing out cigarette butts  means 90% less fires from said cigarette butts."
vancouver,3diwfl,wascallywaldo,2,Thu Jul 16 19:47:23 2015 UTC,"False. This isn't a linear problem, you can't solve it outright by ""enforcing"" a law unenforceable in the remote regions of the province, where said fires usually take place. You're also reaching for making conclusions based off unrelated observations with no evidence. A guestimate of 90% of the population confirming is a nice high number to use, but helmet laws and cigarette butt laws aren't related. 100% of the population aren't smokers, so 90% wouldn't be conforming to anything other than a change in opinion. Out of the smokers that do live here, how many live in cities and how many populate up north? Also, how many of the workers in the northern parts of the province are from out of province residences? How many care? Bike helmet laws are a nice example of an urban reform, where enough people are exposed to accidents and injuries that eventually everyone wises up to the changing ideology, but cigarettes as we can see haven't done the same. We've known they are bad for you for how long? And people still smoke, certain demographics still choose to smoke despite all the dangers they are made aware of. If that pocket of the population is willing to put cancer in their lungs, and pay for it in 10 dollar increments, I don't see how the threat of impounding a vehicle would stop them when they know to just wait till no one is around before tossing the butt. If you want to get people to stop tossing butts, get the people to stop smoking, not change where they can and cannot smoke. Your car is a vessel of personal freedom, I doubt this would make an impact on perceptions."
vancouver,3diwfl,WarrenPuff_It,2,Thu Jul 16 21:04:40 2015 UTC,"If there is even just a small handful of people who learn from this it will be worthwhile. The Lower Mainland has had hundreds of brush fires so far this year due to things like cigarette butts, we have dodged the bullet so far, but if this is a sign of years to come, we have to stop those types of fires from happening, and we have to get the message out via any mechanism possible.   People should be climbing out of their mental boxes and telling strangers to stop it, police should be ramping up enforcement, and smokers should be smartening up. Whining about a difficulty in enforcing a good law is not helping."
vancouver,3diwfl,SquishedPeter,5,Fri Jul 17 15:01:08 2015 UTC,"The number won't be 90%.  The number won't be 0%.      Anywhere in between makes this worth while.   Also not all Smokers are terrible human beings.   Many want to quit but can't.  Many care about their surroundings more than their own body.   Many didn't even realize there was a band until we spoke if it.   The more publicity it gets,  the better it'll get.     What would your solution be?  Nothing?"
vancouver,3diwfl,wascallywaldo,-7,Thu Jul 16 21:11:47 2015 UTC,"No,nothing would be counter productive. I stated getting smokers to quit as the solution, assuming we are just talking about cigarettes being the cause of forest fires."

Your behaviour is dangerous to the public, public and private property, animal and plant life, and the lives of the people who are tasked with putting out the fires started by butts.  That doesn't mean an impound is necessary. Due process is still required, IMO. But there may be an analogy here to other types of habitually dangerous driving behaviour."

Start small and work your way up to draconian.

Take a tape measure.   Don't worry about buying used sheets- that's why they invented washing machines. Just wash them on hot before you use them and they will be fine.

Don't know what I was thinking, but was feeling cheap and found a place in the bushes near some office buildings.    Did you know that if you are homeless you can sleep in parks in Victoria?    If you are this broke firstly fuck your credit cards. You need to get back on your feet.  You need cashflow for food and shelter.   You are entitled to social services.  It is now the weekend but on Monday go to welfare.  There are services which can help get you back on your feet.  Use them.   Focus on shelter and food.  Don't worry about unsecured debt. That can wait or be written off.  You are entitled to emergency funds to pay for some shelter even if it is a flophouse on in the DTES.   Welfare will want you to get working.  You need to be willing to do anything to get you back on your feet earning a living.  After shelter sorted focus on employment.   A stable job will do wonders for you restoring your confidence and getting you back on track to a normal life.  Don't be afraid to leave Vancouver if it will improve your prospects.

vancouver,3diuuu,ejactionseat,2,Thu Jul 16 22:21:29 2015 UTC,I thought the city had banned anchoring in the harbour which is why you see all the crappy boats off kits... but I noticed there are a bunch of boats anchored again this year.  Is this the cause of the levels to spike?  Seems to me the reason they enacted no anchoring was a result of raw sewage from boats.

But thats bad because its the equivalent of you being the mayor, and you might be capable of making decisions best for the city.  Shouldn't we vote based on qualification and trust instead of hearing what we want to hear?

The guy's a PhD candidate in political economy, has an MBA, and has written a bunch of peer-reviewed work on Australian's housing market. You don't have to agree with him, but come on.  Ian Young brings a lot to the table, but this is basically a hit job on someone who's actually crunched the numbers and come to a conclusion that Young doesn't agree with."

There's no such thing as a ""real"" economist, because there's no governing body for the field like there is in medicine.   There just are people who do the work. Some people do it well, and some people do it badly. Bula found someone who'd done extensive work on the topic and found a bunch of people with faculty positions who say it's good work. Young's argument is that Soos doesn't have a PhD yet so we shouldn't listen to him.  I work in an academic lab and calling a PhD candidate with a bunch of published work ""just a student"" is beyond idiotic and made me lose a lot of respect for Young.

It does mention working his way towards a PhD (like how I'm working towards death, it's an empty phrase), with the update that even Soos admits that's from an old bio that hasn't been updated, which sounds more like he took some finance classes.  Which isn't to say he can't have an intelligent opinion on the matter."
vancouver,3diqxa,JuiceMcNewton,6,Thu Jul 16 18:40:32 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I don't want to go to the wall for the guy since I definitely don't know all the details. It's all a bit of a red herring since there's no reason he has to be associated with a school at all to be taken seriously.
vancouver,3diqxa,NoRegretsCoyote,6,Thu Jul 16 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"Hi NoRegretsCoyote: Philip Soos is not a PhD candidate in anything. The claim that he is ""working on a PhD in political economy"" is simply untrue. Soos himself told the SCMP this: he says this claim is based on ""an old bio back from 2012 which hasn’t been updated in a long time"". In fact, he is a Master of Commerce student at Deakin in the department of finance, not the dept of economics. If anyone wants to split hairs about whether he's an economist, well, go ahead, I guess. But both Deakin and Soos confirm that he is not a doctoral candidate in political economy, or anything else there."
vancouver,3diqxa,ianjamesyoung70,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:14:29 2015 UTC,"If anyone wants to split hairs about whether he's an economist, well, go ahead, I guess.   Oh please. You wrote an entire post splitting hairs about what it means to be an economist (""merely a student""). I don't care if anyone calls him an economist or not, and I don't particularly care if he's a PhD candidate or a masters candidate or not affiliated with a school at all. I don't even know if he's a good researcher!  Like I said elsewhere, your whole post is an ad hominem attack that demonstrates some really weird ideas about how academia works. For example, there's nothing weird about a graduate student using their school address as their work address, or saying ""I'm at such-and-such University"". You presented both those things as misleading when they are utterly normal.  Graduate students are real researchers and are often experts in their field well before they earn a PhD.  I mostly find it frustrating that your angle on the housing market recently has been ""why isn't the government keeping data??"", which is fair! But when Bula went and did some real research on the topic and found people that had run data-driven analyses on a similar market, your response is to attack their credentials instead of engaging with the substance of the argument.   If he's doing shitty work, show us why."
vancouver,3diqxa,NoRegretsCoyote,4,Fri Jul 17 00:02:54 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point: he hasn't done (at least, hasn't published) any work on Vancouver.

But you went way beyond that.  Sidney is regularly held up as a similar market to Vancouver. As long as people are making the argument ""Australia taxes foreign owners, why can't we?"" then examining Australia's market -- especially in terms of foreign investment -- should be very relevant. I'd be very interested in a well researched piece by you on Australia's real estate market and how it's similar or different to Vancouver's."
vancouver,3diqxa,NoRegretsCoyote,4,Fri Jul 17 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"FYI, the SCMP article is in no way an ad hominem attack.  It's highlighting and deconstructing a disingenuous Argument From Authority.  The person's opinions and analysis should be evaluated on their own merits, but giving the impression that someone is a professional/expert/experienced academic in a field when they aren't is not OK and should be called out.    Basing an entire article around someone's opinions/research and referring to them as ""an economist at Deakin University in Melbourne"" certainly gives the reader the understanding that the person is a professor at the University, or at the very least a PhD candidate in that field, and well-respected and experienced; not a Master's student in a somewhat-related field.  As for Bula's article, it made no compelling comparisons between Australia's and Vancouver's housing issues whatsoever."
vancouver,3diqxa,Hawkeye077,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"Soos is introduced in Bula's story as someone who has written a book on Australia's housing market. That's the opposite of an argument from authority. A couple paragraphs later she calls him an economist at Deakin University, which I'm happy to concede is too vague. But come on, an honest reading of her article clearly implies he's worth listening to because he's researched the topic, not because he has some official credential.  And Young's post goes way beyond pointing out some bad coverage in the Canadian media and implies that he's a huckster. That's what I'm taking issue with."
vancouver,3diqxa,NoRegretsCoyote,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"""an economist at Deakin University in Melbourne"" isn't vague, it's misleading.  That's mainly the point here.  The guy, Soos, only has researched Australia's situation and Bula's article fails to draw any relevance between that research and the situation in Vancouver.  So the whole article is misleading.  I wouldn't mind reading a good unbiased analysis of the Vancouver housing market, even by a grad student or someone not in the academic field whatsoever, but misrepresenting someone's credentials isn't the right thing to do.  As for the conclusions of Soos' report and Bula's argument.  I don't agree with it, anyway.  If there are 60,000 empty homes in Melbourne and at least 15% of new home sales are to foreigners, that is a significant number.  I don't see how it can be argued that it has no impact on the price of real estate."

Also, ""guy who benefits from false perception of his credentials"". That's what he is. To understand Vancouver's real estate market, I prefer to look at the research of a guy like UBC's Dr David Ley, who has spent decades studying Vancouver's real estate market and demographics and who has a huge swag of peer-reviewed work to cite.

The Lions games are not just rowdy but guys come to get pissed up and they like to pick fights for whatever reason. You don't see that at Whitecaps games at all and Whitecaps gets pretty rowdy. I feel there's more respect there. Then there's the Nucks. They are the hot ticket and they bring out those same rowdies to ""rage"" for a big game. I love to party with the best of them but some people don't have that internal commentary to be respectful.  I love that we are rebuilding. Give these young guys a shot. A lot of guys make the show only because they were given a chance to prove themselves and were developed right.

You'll see roadside vendors selling corn right now but it's likely not the corn you're looking for. most of it is peaches and cream which is absolute garbage.  the corn you're waiting for is jubillee. most roadside vendors will know what it is and will be able to tell you if they have it. sometimes they'll try and trick you and pass off sweet corn as jubilee. don't be fooled. Sometimes they'll have jubilee labelled as 'super sweet' because that's how most people in vancouver refer to it.  jubilee is usually in season in August. you might get some early crop in late july. it's been a hot summer so it should be a good crop this year.

vancouver,3dfjrk,LazyRobot,11,Fri Jul 17 16:14:30 2015 UTC,"It's a little difficult to first start out with urban exploration or roof-topping like this. For the most part, you're always trespassing. It's illegal, no doubt about it. I don't think you'll be able to find classes for it for this reason. It is, however, a huge thrill. I've climbed bridges, sat on the edges of huge hotels, jumped across stairwells, it's insane and extremely dangerous.  To start, you can take a walk around your city by yourself, check out buildings, see how high you can get up using the elevator or stairs. Sometimes, you'll even have to free climb walls and fences. It takes a lot of time and effort this way, seeing as you don't always succeed, there's a lot of trial and error. Locked doors, security and all that. Every building is like it's own puzzle. If you have any friends who are photographers, or any friends who do this sort of stuff already, ask them about it. It's always more fun to go with people than to go alone. Just make sure it's a small group, 2 or 3 people including you. I was very fortunate when I was starting out. I had friends who'd been doing it for awhile before me and they took me around and showed me certain buildings that were easy. If you can find anyone like that in your area, you're golden.   If you're really interested in all of this I highly recommend On The Roofs on YouTube. These guys are absolutely crazy and I only dream of some of the stuff they do. The reason why their faces are usually absent from all the shots is because they could get thrown in jail for a lot of the stuff they've done. ""What's Up Hong Kong?"" and ""Shenzhen Centre"" are must watches from them.   Good luck!"
vancouver,3dfjrk,CandySlawws,2,Thu Jul 16 04:01:16 2015 UTC,I've tried hard to find spots to climb and have only found one or two very easy ones. Do you have to think outside the box to climb some buildings? What should I look out for? What are ways of getting to the top that should always be considered?
vancouver,3dfjrk,Deadzone_,6,Thu Jul 16 04:22:41 2015 UTC,"It's always good to think outside the box. Learn to free climb and work on upper body strength, it helps so much. One good thing to look out for all the time is ladders, stairs or scaffolding on roofs. It confirms there's a way up there and that the roof is made to support foot traffic. Ways of getting to the top that should always be considered? Check for elevators, stairs, fire escapes and ladders. Usually you'll have to take an elevator and a few flights of stairs after that.  A lesser known, super important tip... Know how to lie and improvise. I've been caught before, you have to stay calm. The school art project excuse is a classic."
vancouver,3dfjrk,CandySlawws,2,Thu Jul 16 04:53:58 2015 UTC,"There's never really a police threat. Of course I've always thought about how scary it'd be to come out of a building with some police waiting, but that's just paranoia. It all depends on what you're doing up there, what building it is and if you get seen or not. Recently, a teenager climbed the World Trade Centre and got caught. He faced up to 3 months for criminal trespass. As long as you don't climb anything that's viewed as very important by the government without proper gear (mask) you should be fine."
vancouver,3dfjrk,CandySlawws,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"Of course, but as long it looks like you know what you're doing, you can make your way through a lot of places without people stopping you. These guys probably did it at a time where they were less likely to be stopped as well."

vancouver,3dfjrk,Mountainbillygoat,3,Thu Jul 16 20:29:38 2015 UTC,"You can't really do it without trespassing, however some targets are more risky than others. Just start doing it, join up with others who are into it and learn from them. I've been to to top of many buildings downtown and our most iconic bridge, it's so worth it but definitely carries a risk. Just remember, it IS dangerous, you CAN be arrested so you have to take all precautions.  It does help if you are a climber and have gear (harness, slings etc to rope in with) and are familiar with how to be safe at height, but most places are designed to be fairly safe.  When i'm introducing people to it i have a set of increasingly more difficult locations i take them to."

The city evacuated a number of its staff from works yards and city hall. They had armed police at city hall assisting in the evacuation and guarding those at risk. Police protection was assigned to the homes of others who sat on the committee responsible for the termination of the ex-employee shooter, who remains at large. It's pretty serious."

I don't know anything about the situation or the politics, but I know he was very kind and generous to me and my wife when we lived in his basement suite. His wife and two sons were always great to us, sharing their cooking and being more like friends than landlords.     The night my wife was in a serious accident I waited (alone) for her to come out of surgery. This man left a family gathering to come and sit with me in the hospital. It was a surprising gift of comfort for which I will always be grateful.    We last saw him during one of the garbage strikes. He was hanging off the back of a truck, making the rounds, picking up bins. He called our names as we were walking by, even though it had been many years since we last saw him. My last image of him is as he climbed onto the back of the truck with a big smile and a wave.    I only post this to tell you that this was a person like the rest of us.

vancouver,3dhrzs,noshowwilly,2,Thu Jul 16 16:07:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it mentioned yet, so I'll add a plug for Lighthouse Park in West Vancouver. It can be reached by transit with relative ease and offers several great, scenic hikes--especially through its less-visited eastern half.   Out at the aforementioned UBC you can check out Nitobe Memorial Japanese Garden, the Museum of Anthropology with its many totem poles and other aboriginal artifacts, Spanish Banks beach, and long hikes through nearby Pacific Spirit Park. If you're adventurous you can hike down to clothing-very-optional Wreck Beach.   I second Cypress_Sam's recommendation of Bowen Island. Take transit to the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal then go over as a foot passenger. Hike up to the unique shops at Artisan Square and then go over to Cates Park/Killarney Lake for a scenic and peaceful hike. When you're done, before taking the ferry back, try out the handmade, woodfire oven pizza at Tuscany Restaurant in Snug Cove.   On a different note I'll also mention several funky shopping areas, populated mostly by unique local shops and restaurants, that can, of course, be easily reached by transit. My current favourite is Main Street from Broadway down to 33rd--especially the area around and south of King Edward. Chaise is my favourite restaurant there, but it's one of many. It's also close to Queen Elizabeth Park with its views of the city, converted quarry garden, and small but spectacular conservatory, home to several exotic parrots. Davie St. downtown, West 4th, and West 41st in Kerrisdale (west of West Blvd) are also pretty cool. (I can't recommend Robson anymore--it's basically become an outlet mall filled with the same trendy, overpriced shops and restaurants you can find in any North American city. Your time is better spent elsewhere.)  Enjoy your visit! Your sister needs to get out more."

vancouver,3dgg6n,plucesiar,37,Thu Jul 16 02:01:22 2015 UTC,Demand your own adjuster. ICBC uses the same adjuster for both vehicles.  You must get a third party to act outside the interests of ICBC.  Listen closely. ICBC will fuck you. Scammers pull this garbage all the time because they know ICBC will not side with the victim.
vancouver,3dgg6n,RunsOverCyclists,7,Thu Jul 16 02:57:52 2015 UTC,Sorry I'm not familiar with this whole adjuster business.  Do I simply call ICBC and tell them I want another separate adjuster?  How does this work?
vancouver,3dgg6n,RunsOverCyclists,12,Thu Jul 16 03:18:29 2015 UTC,"You can hire an independent adjuster to asses your damage. The problem is that the money comes out of your pocket and you'll still need to convince ICBC that you're legit. Bringing your own adjuster the table shows you mean business though.  You can lawyer up. A lawyer is probably the best thing you can do right now... Again money.  Discuss the situation with the police and file a report. If the scammer has filed a police report, they can be arrested because filing a false police report is a criminal act.  Honestly, ICBC is going to fuck you long and hard over this. A lawyer might tell you it's not worth the money although personally, I'd retain one anyway and sue ICBC for my costs just because I know I'd win.  The current free option you have is demanding a second ICBC adjuster to look over your vehicle, separate from the adjuster that apparently inspected the scammers vehicle. They only do this in serious or unusual cases, but that won't matter. If they tell you they can't, that's bullshit. Ask to see a supervisor."
vancouver,3dgg6n,jhenry922,3,Thu Jul 16 03:25:22 2015 UTC,I can talk to someone who I know and trust personally who IS an ICBC adjuster who trains people how to do claims. He knows lots of shops in East Vancouver where you can go to get a fair shake
vancouver,3dgg6n,WarrenPuff_It,6,Thu Jul 16 14:15:13 2015 UTC,Is filing a false claim to ICBC a criminal act itself?
vancouver,3dgg6n,RunsOverCyclists,8,Thu Jul 16 03:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is. Fraud. You don't need a lawyer to know that. Fraud is fraud."
vancouver,3dgg6n,brynndle,3,Thu Jul 16 03:47:27 2015 UTC,IANAL... It certainly sounds like fraud.
vancouver,3dgg6n,brynndle,17,Thu Jul 16 03:43:58 2015 UTC,"As someone who works in insurance, I and everyone I work with fucking hate dealing with ICBC because their practices are so ridiculous and they're extremely unwilling to compromise, so you probably won't get my much assistance from their adjuster. Someone already suggested getting your own adjuster, which I would recommend, because their adjuster is going to do everything possible to prove that you're at fault.   Regardless of whether you get your own adjuster, get your vehicle appraised. If the third party claimed  damage and your damages (if any) don't match up, then they don't really have much to go on in terms of proof (besides the ""witness""). However, the fact that they've enlisted their own witness is concerning. Fault can be confirmed solely on the witness statement.   Unfortunately, you might need to get legal advice. I'm not too familiar with the legal part of claims, so hopefully someone else can assist you on that.  Good luck! And don't let ICBC fuck you over!"
vancouver,3dgg6n,SusieSuze,3,Thu Jul 16 04:55:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I've told them to get it checked out at a car dealership/repair shop over the next couple of days just to get a record that the car isn't damaged.  This would be in addition to the checkup the adjuster has arranged, which is like 2 weeks out."
vancouver,3dgg6n,frodosbitch,2,Thu Jul 16 05:39:15 2015 UTC,"That's great about getting it checked out, and I would also recommend taking as many pictures as possible of the car as soon as you can. Pictures are extremely important in claims!   You might want to be prepared for this to take a while, ICBC works at a snail's pace unfortunately."

vancouver,3dgg6n,frodosbitch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:35:48 2015 UTC,Does ICBC accept that as evidence? That is the important question. Just because it makes sense it doesn't mean it's on their stupid checklist of approved evidence.
vancouver,3dgg6n,cdnheyyou,4,Thu Jul 16 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"ICBC's used it in the past to catch insurance cheats in court.  Some dude claimed his 75K pickup was stolen. It was found in the woods torched a week later.  ICBC subpoenaed cell tower logs to show that the owner was in the vicinity of where the truck was found before the truck was reported stolen.  Bottom line is OP needs to do the following, and now:   get an independent inspection of the car, in writing; retain an attorney send the ICBC a notarized affidavit denying any and all responsibility   OP's family needs to put themselves in the driver's seat and let ICBC know they won't be bullied or pushed around. Make their lives difficult for as long as possible and you have a good chance of getting through it.  Fuck ICBC."

vancouver,3dgg6n,zipperhead1971,-1,Thu Jul 16 02:52:07 2015 UTC,worst case is that she's found at fault for an accident.  that's where your liability insurance kicks in. Could lose your discount. Could have to pay for a new bumper if someone rules that 'hit and run' voids insurance.  You can always appeal any decision against you.  It's equally possible that someone crashed into your old lady's car and didn't want to pay for their own bumper.

They won't threaten, but they will ask serious questions and that presence does have an effect on scammers because it then becomes a case of lying to police on top of the fraud charges.  Scammers are hoping you'll just pay them to make them go away if you get the police involved the scammers will usually just move on to a softer target.  Police will also have a record of these people making this accusation which can then be used against them if it pops up again.  The scammers will be forced to identify themselves to police if they give fakes identities, it's lying to police, so they can be charged even if they drop the accusations."

Chances are an offer will be made to settle  and that is what they are hoping you will do.  It's a common scam, especially in Ontario.  It's a HUGE scam with Tamils there, along with staging rearenders on roads.  The fact that the target doesn't speak English tells me this is likely Asian scammers targeting non-english speaking seniors because they will find it more difficult to seek help and just pay out cash.  Watch and see, if she indeed was home an offer for a cash settlement will arrive soon enough."

Gather as much evidence as you can to prove it wasn't her, and that she wasn't there at that time.  If there's proof she wasn't there, and there's absolutely no damage that could match up with the other vehicle it, would be asinine for them to put your mother-in-law at fault."

This would be in addition to the inspection scheduled by the adjuster, which is like a few weeks out.  Also advised them about getting a separate adjuster too.  If ICBC fights back hopefully the fact that a police report was filed will push them into assigning one.  Anyway, keeping my fingers crossed that the inspection is enough to prove innocence, and if it does maybe the police will do something about it.

vancouver,3df9b9,liquidpig,2,Thu Jul 16 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"Situation 1: You work a job at $50k/yr and have no savings. You just keep working and making $50k/yr, saving $5k/yr for 20 years until you have $100k to start a business. You start that business and earn $100k/yr in your new job.  Situation 2: Same starting conditions, except after 2 years and $10k saved, you quit your job and borrow $90k to start the business. You now earn $100k/yr. You pay $10k/yr on your loan to service it, live on $50k, and save $40k. After 1 more year (so year 3), you take out a $400k loan and increase your business size. You now owe $480k in debt, but you're making $500k/yr. You keep doing this type of thing for 20 years. You are always in debt, and the debt is growing, but your income grows faster. After 20 years you are earning $10M/yr using 10% of your income to service the debt, and keeping the other $9M yourself...  Which situation would you rather be in after 20 years? Debt free earning $100k, or clearing $9M/yr even after making the payments on your $9M debt?  Obviously the numbers are made up, but the idea is that you leverage cheap debt to earn a higher ROI which you can then turn into a downpayment for more cheap debt which gets you more income.  This is a no-brainer to do for the government because there's a ton of nice ROI projects they can invest in, and debt for a government is dirt cheap."

We supplement federal transfers for health with revenue both from provincial income tax as well as MSP, not to mention various other miscellaneous sources of revenue, but to call it a subsidy is a bit weird. That's like saying we subsidize roads... by paying for them. It's something we pay for.  If we had 100% private insurance and the provincial government paid the premiums for those below a certain income, you could say the state was subsidizing their health premiums, but the use of that word doesn't make sense when referring to how we pay for a chunk of government that at present takes over 50% of the provincial budget. The government doesn't subsidize itself - the idea is nonsensical. The government allocates revenue to expenses and program spending."

I chose London Place because of the no-touch procedure.  The staff there were great and all the informational sessions and follow up care were top notch.  The surgery itself took only about 5-10 minutes.  I was extremely sensitive to light afterwards.  I was out of commission for about a week, and could barely open my eyes.  Had to wear sunglasses, even indoors, for about another 2 weeks afterwards.  Then it slowly got better.  The first few days was actually pretty painful for me.  Not sharp pain, but constant stinging sensation in my eyes.  They gave me some pain meds to deal.  10 years later, I am still 20/20 (I had super vision for the first year or so though).  Although, I do have a side effect.  I see halos around lights when the ambient brightness is dim or dark.  In well lit areas, it's totally fine though."

I mentioned it in a follow up and the doctor was like... Yeah,   that happens.     1-3 months later,  she had eye pains that were more discomfort than anything and vision was not perfect.   3-5 months later   Vision is near perfect and eye pain is essentially non-existent.   6 months later, her eyes are now dry every once in a while and uses eye drops before bed, or when dry for other reason.

I haven't had any of the complications they warn you about like light sensitivity, halos or anything. SBK has less risk of those anyway compared to regular LASIK.   The most annoying parts were having to wear glasses only in the weeks leading up to the surgery, and having to sleep with the protective eye cups on after lol.

They recommended the PKR treatment as I'm still young and have plenty of cornea tissue. 5 days of expected recovery and about a month before my vision settles. They did however tell me that I can't get to perfect 20/20 vision in my left eye due to its shape.  The price is usually $3,000, but with a referral, you can get it for $2,500.

I do not agree.  The Charter is the supreme law of the land and there is nothing that would, in the Civil Forfeiture Act or otherwise, require judges to construe provincial laws in such a way.

She seems to trully get at the root of why civil forfeiture cases get under our skin:   There is, however, an extra element in the civil forfeiture cases, and that is the jeopardy faced by a civilian, at risk of losing a great deal and at risk of being labelled for criminal behaviour. This jeopardy arises from evidence gained by police using their special authority but without the case ever having fed into the criminal proceedings stream, with the defendant now caught in a proceeding that requires presentation for cross-examination at an examination for discovery. All of this is allowed by the legislation. Given these very high stakes for the individual and the power difference between the parties, it is not surprising that there has been an assortment of applications seeking to challenge the legitimacy of the evidence gathering actions of the police, seeking to postpone discovery until that legitimacy has been determined, and seeking avenues for just redress where such activities have been found to be in violation of a person’s Charter rights."

While extending the WCE over the Mission Bridge to Abbotsford has an air of plausibility to it, there aren't really any other rail corridors of comparable quality to the CP mainline connecting a number of old town centers directly and quickly to Downtown Vancouver.  The CN mainline doesn't really go through any population centers in between New Westminster Bridge and Chiliwack. The BNSF Shore Line only goes to White Rock, and the old BC Electric Interurban is steep, winding, and misses many of the residential and employment centers South of Fraser.

vancouver,3de7ny,Dohnought8765,2,Wed Jul 15 23:47:35 2015 UTC,"Let's see here.  A rule-of-thumb capacity of a freeway lane is 2000 vehicles per hour. Assuming a 1.2 occupancy rate, that's 2400 people per hour per lane.  A 22 lane freeway would carry 26,400 people per hour per direction.  That's more or less exactly the maximum design capacity of the Expo Line.    The current operating capacity of the Expo Line is 16,000 pphpd. Presumably, the capacity of the Millennium Line is 8,000 pphpd, which adds up to 24,000 pphpd  So a full 22 lane freeway or the skytrain operating full trains would be transporting a comparable amount of people out of town.

vancouver,3de7ny,kylemacmac,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:47:09 2015 UTC,Diesel multiple units were once proposed for the SW corridor to link Coquitlam Station to Braid Station (and to be further expanded along the Fraser to Vancouver).  Is it feasible to run DMU style service along some or all of the WCE corridor during off peak hours or even as a replacement for the WCE?
vancouver,3de7ny,RunsOverCyclists,2,Wed Jul 15 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"I believe that the Canadian Pacific Railway would be hostile to any increase in frequency on their mainline without some rather formidable capacity upgrades, and maybe even then, management is said to be rather hostile to passenger rail in general.  Their recent murder of once excellent WCE time keeping (followed by what's said to be a return to normal once the referendum was safely over) is suspicious.  I believe there has been some chatter of a midday frequency, but I bet that a pound of flesh would be necessary before they'd let it happen.  Ideally, the WCE would be an all day DMU.  DMU have better acceleration than locomotive-hauled trains, and thus can make more stops or make the run faster.    With respect to the SW corridor, that's an interesting proposal which I'm not familiar with. At 'typical' commuter rail average speeds you could make the run between Coquitlam Central and Braid in 10-12 minutes, and New Westminster Station in 15-20, which is point-to-point car comparable.  The problem I see is that the line is on the wrong side of the freeway for a lot of residential traffic and business parks and Box stores adjacent to the line tend to generate poor ridership as well. But it would be interesting to study"

I figure capacity upgrades would be cheaper to do on the portion of track east from Coquitlam Station although I also imagine some may view it as competing with SkyTrain (which is what killed the False Creek Streetcar).  I don't think it's too far fetched to suggest that a preliminary off peak DMU service could be set up between Coquitlam and Mission if we could satisfy CP.

(Slow the video down to 0.5 speed to see what I mean)  No wonder people out there emphatically voted no. The service they get is shit now, and I'm sure not many care about things like a Broadway subway that's designed to service students at UBC who  either aren't paying taxes or their fair fare share.

vancouver,3de7ny,RupertMurloc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:28:43 2015 UTC,"The Broadway subway will have more ridership on opening day than Surrey will ever have.   Right, and? That justifies it? When a large percentage of the ridership are UBC students who aren't paying any taxes at all to support it and are paying a discounted fare already?  Everyone keeps saying car drivers should ""pay their fair share"", and that's absolutely true. But sauce for the goose and all that. Translink's farebox recovery is 51.9%... Montreal's is 57.1% and Toronto's is a whopping 73%. There's certainly room for a moderate fare increase.  Look, I'm not saying a Broadway subway is a bad idea - it absolutely is needed. But my point is that when people who will never benefit from it are asked to bend over and pay for it, are we really surprised when they balk? Add to that the argument the perception that UBC is a wealthy school with a massive endowment full of wealthy foreign students with deep pockets, and yeah, tough sell to the rest of the GVRD."
vancouver,3de7ny,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,0,Thu Jul 16 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"The Broadway subway isn't for UBC. It doesn't go to UBC.  Most of it's ridership is not going to UBC.   UBC students are paying the same property taxes indirectly through their rents,  Their discount passes come from requiring all students to pay for them.  The students that are commuting to UBC are largely local students. ""wealthy foreign"" students can afford to live closer to campus.  Broadway is connecting the region to the second largest employment center in the entire Province. The rest of us are expected to 'bend over' and pay for the losses on the Port Mann Bridge, and the inevitable losses for Surrey Light Rail, and countless other ways, but when the one transportation project that actually has a sound business case comes up, all the sudden it's it's everyone else whose getting screwed? This is classic suburban myopia in action. You're right, it's a tough sell, but it's not a tough sell because of people having a strong grasp of the issues"

And that money goes back to Translink? Source? Which center is that, and it's not already served by the Canada Line? Broadway/Cambie? That's not how the Port Mann was sold to us, though. The after-the-fact numbers, sure. And the ""inevitable losses for Surrey Light Rail""??? I'm sorry? Using that argument, the entire Translink system is a loss. Unless you're trying to say (and I hope you're not) that the Surrey LRT should have 100% fare recovery??    ""...sound value case"": sure, it has, I've already said that it's needed. But there are plenty of places in the GVRD that need it just as desperately as the Broadway Corridor. Again, the question lots of these people asked: ""why does Vancouver get it first? Where's ours?""  ""...because of people having a strong grasp of the issues"" - well, then the Mayors certainly did a piss poor job educating the populace of the ""issues"".   It doesn't matter what the issues are to the average ratepayer, they only care about ""fairness"". Vancouver getting another subway line while the rest of the GVRD gets what they feel is table scraps just perpetuates the stereotype that it's Vancouver proper first, everyone else second.

vancouver,3de7ny,kylemacmac,0,Thu Jul 16 19:40:20 2015 UTC,"1/2/3.  Whatever. To portray Broadway is simply an expensive shuttle for 'foreign students' to UBC is misleading. That is the point, not whether students use it at all.   4-  Yes, U-pass revenue goes to translink. If students walk/bike/drive to campus they pay translink the same every month. This is why the U-pass is a negotiated agreement between Translink and various student societies   5- I don't have census reports on the issue, but think about it. Supposedly wealthy foreign students are going to be the ones who live in Kits/Point Grey/Dunbar or on campus because they can afford to do so. for them the 99 is not an necessary link.   The students depending on Broadway transit are those living in East Van, Burnaby, Surrey, the Tri-Cities, the North Shore, and so forth who commute long distances from their homes to campus.    6- You know, Central Broadway? Most people in the region don't live in Richmond, and the Canada line does not serve them.    7- I made no argument, merely an observation that suburban services are mostly money pits in excess of everything else, especially one like Surrey Light Rail which by nature will have rather high construction and operating costs versus the ridership it will attract.   By contrast Broadway will have enough ridership to more than pay for it's operations and maintenance.    ""But there are plenty of places in the GVRD that need it just as desperately as the Broadway Corridor""   Quite frankly, no. There are no places  in Metro Vancouver that need rapid transit as desperately as the Broadway Corridor by any metric. Any other line that's been discussed is a speculative investment in hopes that something better than car-bound suburbanism might be built in the next generation after construction. Broadway is there now. The buses are past capacity now.  That doesn't mean other lines shouldn't be built, but the notion that an actual corridor which has the demand to justify heavy rapid transit yesterday is not most in need is rooted in an inability to appreciate the mass of infrastructure already built to serve low density suburbanites,   The mayors didn't help that, but that wasn't a fight they were going to win."

vancouver,3de7ny,albh,6,Wed Jul 15 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right re: efficiency of buses / $ of transit spend.  Having more buses or trains or ferries does not mean more efficient use of transit dollars, or vice versa.  In fact, it can mean the exact opposite...with limited transit funding money wasted on needless empty buses.  But the funding and service levels administered by Translink put it into a public transportation category far above that of metro North American cities of our size.  We shouldn't be compensating Translink exces similar to Seattle, Portland or Calgary.  The level of service and ridership operated by Translink is similar to the MBTA in Boston or SEPTA in Philadelphia, metro and service areas with 2x the population of Vancouver.   And since we have a far more developed and frequented transit system in place than cities our same size, even IF our system was slightly less ""efficient"" on whatever (seemingly arbitrary) metrics used to determine such a thing, it's still worth us paying more because of the level of service we get, which offsets expensive personal vehicle use.  We'll save money overall.   Compared to the 3 cities listed in my previous post, Vancouverites are far less likely to HAVE to rely on private automobiles to get around.  It's mind-boggling to me how all discussions re: public transit ""efficiency"" never seem to factor in the idea that with sufficient public transit funding and service levels, ""people will simply not have to own/operate a private vehicle that costs $10,000 per year"".  The savings of being able to get around without a vehicle are immense....even IF Translink ""wastes"" some money.  By no means do I suggest they should operate inefficiently, but they are being publicly scrutinized on all the wrong metrics for all the wrong reasons."

The entire region is growing fast, and Burnaby is adding large #s of net units. You'd expect more supply to equal lower prices, if the market was reasonable."

The Corrigans are as NDP as they come and yet when it comes to what goes on in the city, they shrug off the responsibility for the problem onto other levels of government. In Vancouver, at least the city is trying to find creative ways to stimulate the building of affordable rental. They haven't had a ton of success, but at least they are trying."

It would be accurate to label Burnaby as a left wing council sure, but unless they've changed their party name to ""NDP"" it's an inaccurate label and terrible journalism."
vancouver,3diye3,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:31:03 2015 UTC,"Well, not quite. The BCA functionally is the NDP, more or less. From what I understand BCA elected officials are all all members of the NDP, and are all expected to maintain memberships in the NDP. That doesn't mean that they toe the Dipper party line, but they are thoroughly joined   By contrast, while Vision Vancouver has notable ties to the NDP (like ex-NDP MLA Gregor Robertson), they aren't partisan NDPers. Vision has rather significant connections to the Federal Liberals, and even ties to the BC Liberals more than Vision or the NPA might admit publicly. Vision elected officials, staff, and activists are known to be members and supporters of both parties federally."

New Westminster has a third the population of Burnaby and an eighth the size, yet New West has (at least as of 2013) the highest number of permanent shelter beds in the province, per capita. Burnaby has zero.  New West has an extreme weather shelter and four emergency shelters, Burnaby has one extreme weather shelter that, in 2013, was only open from 7pm to 7am. If it happens to be freezing cold at 7:30am, sorry bud. Burnaby has no transitional housing residences, New West has six.  Corrigan and his council are purportedly left wing, but they really don't act like it. His standard ""it's the province's problem to deal with, it's the country's problem to deal with"" is bullshit. Vancouver deals with it. New Westminster deals with it. Burnaby doesn't.  How about fighting that fight while also helping your citizens, Mr. Corrigan?

vancouver,3dft3h,hankjmoody,5,Thu Jul 16 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"They have those. I've worked in a few apartments in west vancouver where the entire floor is one unit with it's own elevator access directly to the front door.  However, it's not done reguarly because it's not as profitable. Would you rather sell 1 3000 sqft unit for $1,000,000 or 6 500 sqft units for $250,000+ each and make $1,500,000+? This is why cities put a mandatory minimum 2/3 bedroom units for all new developments. Otherwise, builders will only make small 1-bedrooms to maximize profits."
vancouver,3dft3h,Quenchiest,2,Thu Jul 16 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I guess I've just never come across one.

Can you imagine the cost, not to mention reaction in the neighbourhood? I doubt that running new arterials through residential neighbourhoods for the benefit of car traffic is high on the city's list of political priorities.  It would be interesting to see city data on the problems created by the Broadway / W10th disconnect, but a combination of better transit and co-ordinated traffic signals can likely manage most problems.

FYI,  Broadway turns and becomes 8th Avenue, not 9th.  The original design was that it it run to Chancellor via 8th, certainly it's not what they have in mind now, although like many unrealized projects, they maintain provisioning in case they change their mind in the future.  Future provisioning can be seen for NW Marine Drive, intended to become 4 lanes and become Point Grey Road, which also had setbacks reserved.  The parking lot outside the sailing centre was intended to become part of the road, forming a grand centre median like we see with King Edward and Cambie."

It's intended for people who want to make money selling their art, but they might have classes or skill-sharing options.  She could get involved with volunteering by finding a cause she's into - she would have something to do with her time and a way to make some new friends. You can type in the word Art into the search function - I notice that brings up Powell Street Festival, which reminds me that any festival in Vancouver would probably take her as a volunteer. The other perk to volunteering is that if she's been using drugs heavily this would be a nice way to ease back into working and start (re-)building a resume.  Vancouver Art Gallery is by donation on Tuesdays from 5-9pm and right now they have that new exhibit on Heaven & Hell that looks pretty interesting.  If she's up for it you could also take her to some of the beautiful places accessible by transit & with no cover charge (mountains, hiking, Stanley Park/QE Park/Sun Yat Sen Gardens) and encourage her to bring a sketchbook and draw. She can do this with you, with another safe friend, or on her own.  In my experience one of the best ways to work on recovery is to focus on what the goals are ahead and not dwell too much on the past, unless you really need to talk something out (which is better done with a counsellor, but also sometimes good with friends). Talking more about ""How are you achieving your goals?"" and ""What did you do today that makes you happy?"" Making new friends is pretty key, because new friends keep you focused on who you are since you've met them, as opposed to drowning you in who you used to be. Also making new friends makes it easier to delete/unfriend/grow away from old friends who still use or who have phone numbers to dealers.  Hope that helps! :)"

vancouver,3djl73,FirstVape,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:00:09 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for the games with the best odds and easy to play, stick to Craps betting only the Pass or Don't Pass bets (although the latter will get you snarky looks) and always maxing the behind the line bet after the come-out roll. If that all sounds like gibberish, just place $5 or $10 on the pass line and cheer for the roller.   The other game that has decent odds is Blackjack. The problem with Blackjack is you MUST play basic strategy for it to not have shit odds. People play how they feel like playing and this results in one of the worst odds in the house. You have to be consistent and always follow basic strat (unless you're counting, but this doesn't work in Canada due to the amount of continuous shufflers), if you deviate you are hurting nobody but yourself. This means hitting 12-16s on dealer 7's or higher (few exceptions where you should surrender), and most people don't want to do that because they don't like losing instantly.  To my knowledge all other casino games have far worse odds. General rule of thumb is the more the game pays out compared to your bet, the worse it is.  Have fun and always consider the money you take into the casino spent, leave debit cards at home!  Edit: Baccarat ain't bad either."

Will they eat food off a 100 km/h highway?  Yup, seen it many times.  Do they fleep away before they get hit?  Yup, every time I've seen.  Anyways, there's a tragic first time for everything I guess.  This statement near the end is unusual:  ""The seagull population has already taken a dive by 50 percent as marine food continues to drop according to UBC. This accounts for why seagulls have begun to eat garbage ""  Begun? Has UBC been paying attention?  Seagulls have always eaten garbage.  Every alley.  Every can/dumpster. Every landfill.

They imply that the only reason council members voted a certain way was because they got a donation beforehand.   ""Lo and behold, City Council has moved recently to extend restaurant patio hours. As well, public land leases for new restaurants are coming up (watch for future land deals, possible heritage transfers with some of these companies).""  Well so friggin' what? Is it not possible that extending patio hours was maybe a good idea in the first place?"
vancouver,3degq4,robertscreek,2,Wed Jul 15 17:31:28 2015 UTC,"They imply that the only reason council members voted a certain way was because they got a donation beforehand.   Yep, I think that causality mainly runs the other way, in most cases.  A political party says they'll do X, so you donate to them because you agree with their plan to do X, and then next thing you know, that party is in office doing X.  They're not doing X because you donated to them.  It's the other way around: you donated to them because you agreed with their platform, which includes doing X.  There may be some influence in the other direction in the case of extremely large donations, but I think the effect is often exaggerated."

A complete example of quid pro quo where there is no reason for the regulations they have except for corruption.  Sure maybe extending patio hours is a good idea but when the keg gives the mayor 100K he should excuse himself from any voting on those issues.
vancouver,3degq4,Weirdmantis,7,Wed Jul 15 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"If everyone who got a donation had to recuse themselves, there'd be no quorum and council business would come to a halt.  It would be much more pragmatic to simply limit how much a person can donate and how much a party/candidate can spend.  If the taxi situation you're referring to is keeping Uber off the streets, it's because the company refuses to comply with provincial safety/licensing standards. Maybe those standards need to change or maybe there needs to be a new process but that doesn't mean the city is corrupt for enforcing existing legislation. The taxi industry has always donated heaps of cash, long before Uber was a thing."

That is entirely within city councils control.  The fact that the number of taxis were reduced to the point where the service declined created a situation where uber was able to come in an be so much better.  That's not even talking about how the provincial liberals and NDP are also bribed by the taxi companies.

vancouver,3degq4,majormoron,2,Wed Jul 15 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"The problem is that regardless of what logical, reasoned arguments may exist in favour or against extended patio hours, those donations erode my confidence that the policies are being made in good-faith consideration of those arguments.  It might actually turn out that the patio hours decision was a good decision. But it doesn't follow that it was a good decision made for the right reasons. The reason we're supposed to care about an official's past legislative record isn't because we want to retroactively reward good behaviour with votes, it's that it supposedly helps us to understand what kinds of decisions that official will make in the future, if reelected. Their past decisions are supposed to help us make inferences about the process which produces those decisions.  A good legislative decision, if it's made in the presence of a large campaign contribution contingent on that decision, whether explicitly (""support this legislation or I'll withdraw campaign support"") or implicitly (""I like you and I want you to have some campaign money, and I'll keep liking you as long as you keep governing in a way I like""), tells me nothing about whether they'll make good decisions in the future.  edit to add:   ""Citizens have a right to insist, as the price of trust in a democracy, that officials not give reason to doubt their trustworthiness.""

vancouver,3dh6l3,fuzzypeacheese,5,Thu Jul 16 06:17:51 2015 UTC,Nursing opertunities are fairly decent in the city. Its easy to get hired on as a casual and then apply internally to positions. Then it might be a bit of a waiting game to gain a permanent work line but there should be plenty of work casually in med/surg until then.
vancouver,3dh6l3,misterbator,3,Thu Jul 16 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"You will get a casual line no problem in all VCH/PHC/FHA facilities, the con of this is that you'll probably might have to travel to different hospitals every other shifts. Getting a permanent full time line is based on seniority."
vancouver,3dh6l3,caw___caw,3,Thu Jul 16 14:59:42 2015 UTC,"This was definitely my experience. Casual work is relatively easy to get, depending on the time of year and a bit of luck. From there, there are lots of opportunities to specialize once you get experience.  There is a particularly large demand for pediatric and perinatal nurses due to the expansion at C&W's hospital, and a high demand in the OR and ICU at this time (maybe because of hospital budget cuts?), but in 2-3 years, that may change.  There always seems to be jobs for nurses willing to work in rural areas (Bella Bella rural, not Squamish).  Edit: protip. Both external and internal postings for vch are open to the public to view if you want to get an idea of what's out there"

You could go on to get your Nurse Practitioner designation - NPs are being used for primary care issues like doctors (with limitations on their scope of course).  The ONLY drawback I've seen from working in healthcare (not as a nurse) is that some hospitals are hiring LPNs because they are cheaper than RNs."

More organized thieves try to offload in another city - so watch out for Surrey, Richmond, Langley, etc.  Not sure if NSMB has a forum for this, but they have a pretty big online presence - I'd check their website / forums and see if there's any further tips there.  Last idea: Call up a reputable bike shop (like Obsession Bikes in North Van) and ask if they'd recommend you check out any shady second hand dealers who might not be as careful about who they buy from. I don't know who they are anymore or I'd suggest them here - but in the industry, everyone seems to know who's who, and if you ask, you might get pointers.  Good luck.

You don't want to get into a physical confrontation with anyone. Make sure you keep the bikes serial number and the police report number on you at all times. If you see the bike you should call the police and just observe the person that has it from a distance.   Craigslist/kijiji is another good place to keep an eye on. Side note - if you're ever purchasing a bike through one of those services and the owner won't provide a serial number it's probably stolen. The RCMP maintains a database that you can search for stolen cars, bikes, boats etc. Just input the serial number and it will tell you if a police report has been made about the item. http://www.cpic-cipc.ca/index-eng.htm   Last week I located a friends stolen bike outside Nester's Market in the Woodwards building. I noticed the bike from a post that she made on Facebook. I asked the store management to check their security cameras and I was told that it was left by a junkie about 30mins earlier. I called my friend, sent her a photo to confirm, and then just took the bike back because it was unlocked. So, keep your hopes up!!!"

All I can say is, good luck. What I recommend is find a good stylist/barber and patronage them. after a couple cuts, they'll be more familiar and open to giving you ideas.  if you want a trendy cut though, find some examples of what you like and take it to anyone. try not to be unrealistic though (i want my hair to be 4 inches longer on top, etc)"

And yeah, it's absolutely possible to find what you are looking for at that price bracket. We got lucky but my girlfriend and I are staying in East van in a 1br apartment for 800.   Though as some may have mentioned, you may have to stick it out for that right price. I would also recommend broadening your search to the greater Vancouver area, its not uncommon that you can find basement suites for around 700- 900 range and as long as you are close to a sky train transit into Vancouver is a cinch.  As far as share rooms go, I know my neighbourhood (east van) does have many shared houses but I am unsure on the going price is. Rooms are available everywhere but it may be trickier to rent a room for a couple rather than a single.

That's a little disappointing. For the record, although I'm not ""enraged ""by your site (I just seldom find it funny) I and all of your readers ARE entitled to feel however we like about it.

You absolutely have the right to read, not read, like, dislike, strongly dislike, be amused, aroused, share, or knock anything you see in the world. This is our society, and that is awesome. What I would ask is, why?   I know that if you came to a Syrup Trap meeting in my friends' shitty basement apartment, and met the young, overly optimistic, super talented people who contribute to it (for free, although sometimes there's beer), you wouldn't say that you hate the Syrup Trap. You still might hate it, for sure. You still may never read it, share it, or be aroused by it, but you would never shit on it.   That's why I'm defensive of the organization - because I know the people who take the bus across town every week with ideas they've been working on for days for no reward except being part of something they believe in. And when you tear it down it just feels sad. Yes, we're satire writers (some of us), but look at our targets. We don't punch down."
vancouver,3datt5,jameswsthomson,2,Thu Jul 16 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"Food for thought, thanks. Look, I understand where you're coming from. Unlike what your other vocal defender implied about me, I think people creating things is good. Comedy is good. Art is good. Hell, these are the things that feed and clothe my kid. And I sort of regret using the word ""hate"". I think in hindsight I just wish I'd said I hadn't ever found the Syrup Trap very funny. It's not like I don't understand that there are real people behind it.  I can dislike the work but that doesn't mean I dislike the creators. I just haven't really enjoyed the content I'd seen on the Syrup Trap for a variety of reasons. When I saw this article, which I thought was funny, it was within that context. So I said so.  Note: I didn't heckle you on stage. I didn't stop you on the street to tell you how much I hate it. I didn't send you an email or troll you on Twitter. I didn't post on Syrup Trap's Facebook page. I commented on a third party website where strong (and often ill-considered) opinions are shared.  It is what it is. I understand it's shitty when people vocally dislike something you made, but it's kind of part of the business. Volunteer or not, labour of love or not, free publication or not. It's the internet, right? That's the beauty of it. It doesn't matter if you're a conglomerate or some girl in her PJs. You're in the same marketplace, so you're fair game. That's the downside. The upside is your publication exists.  You're absolutely right, Syrup Trap doesn't punch down. But can you understand that I -- some schmo on an internet message board -- am also not ""punching down"" when I say something kinda harsh (but fairly honest) about an online publication with its own established readership, social channels, etc.? (I actually have/had no idea how ""big"" Syrup Trap is, but it's gotten fairly regular play on /r/van. You could tell me it has a ~6-person salaried staff and pays decent freelance rates and I'd totally have believed it.)  Anyway. Doubt we'll see eye to eye on this one, but that's my POV.

Said  ""the rotors need truing and they so cheap new ones are just about the same"". Brake pads have over 3/16"" left before the wear indicator would start to contact, runout on the rotors was only 2/1000"" measured with a digital dial indicator. Judgement: Not actual crooks but certainly telling fibs. 3/10  Great Canadian near Lions Gate (they call themselves something else). I change my trucks oil but let them do my wifes as I don't have tire ramps. They always pressure me for a laundry list of stuff like cabin and fuel filters etc. So so. 7/10  The Honda dealership at the Automall TM is pretty consistent and is reasonable in price but there can be a wait. Good thing there is a good park with a coffee shop (Thomas Hass) nearby. So, upvote for chocolate and caffeine. 9/10  Got my oil changed at Nic's in North Vancouver.  This and other things they did wrong make me glad they are no longer in business. On the oil change front, they somehow  had 22 liters of oil in it and it ran poorly. (how? who knows?) and I had to go to Johnny's at the foot of MacKay to fix this and a persistent transmission leak that he traced to a vacuum line that left cylinder #5 spark plug damaged."

The worse part is, is you self promoted the fuck out of it, had launch parties and still no one bought it. And that was 4 years ago.   So now what?   You don't have the car. No porn in Costa Rica.

Wrong! Oh man, you're off by several years.  No porn in Costa Rica? Where else did I go for a year then?  Calling a book a flop is pretty lame, it isn't easy to sell art. This ain't 50 Shades of Grey. 50 Shades was fan fiction based on Twilight that took off with an abusive storyline about a billionaire and a girl who would say ""double crap"" and bite her lip on every page. That drole made $500 million dollars. My book was a genuine attempt at creating a work of art from my heart and soul. If it sold less than 10 copies I honestly wouldn't have cared. Truth is, I've sold a few hundred and several girls have banged me in exchange for a copy! It has been incredibly fun to be an author, even one that isn't very popular. Go ahead and insult it, I'll be releasing more books soon. Don't hate on someone because they're following their dreams, you should be congratulating me for being able to pursue my dreams with aplomb. :)  Seriously, you're yet another anonymous nerd trying to attack me for being able to live life my way. Funny how instead of wanting to pursue porn, I raise issues that do affect other men and women from a genuinely caring place. For that, people attack me relentlessly. Honestly I see a ton of suffering around me of both men and women, and the issues I try and bring attention to, instant gratification, the lack of traditional morality, drug and alcohol abuse, the realm of online dating changing our value to others, the list goes on and on. These are issues that cause a ton of strife in our culture, a culture that beats people down through 1000 little cuts that adds up to a toxic environment for us all.  I suppose if I simply stuck to porn and focused on making a fortune in it and not commenting on social issues, guys like you would be my biggest fans. It really makes me laugh that people are so eager to hate on someone who wants to discuss things that nobody else is talking about. If I just stuck to the same old topics, it would be so much easier to get along with the average person.  Diss me all you want, you don't have the mental capacity to engage me on an intellectual level so you simply attack my book sales. Pretty lame. :)"

Obviously I'm not in a position to judge the quality of your relationship, but perhaps two introverted people are actually not the greatest match for one another? It has been said, and seems only natural, that opposites should attract.

You aren't in a position to judge, yet here you are, doing just that.   I'm not helping you prove anything. You are cherry picking what you want to hear to support an argument you have no real interest in hearing the other side of.

Being a heterosexual has innate disadvantages, such as:   The man paying for dates The social status required to date a desirable woman The incredibly expensive nature of taking a relationship beyond ""girlfriend""   Perhaps it is people like you, introverts with so little grasp of the outside world, that needs to open your mind up. My mind has been so open in the last 6 years of living in Gastown and writing on the subject of sex and dating that my brain nearly fell out of my head!  Yes, I know several couples that met online, but I've also known a bunch of people who claim their 5 year oxy addiction is actually helping their lives.  Perhaps someone like me should just keep his mouth shut in hopes of not offending someone on Reddit, that online dating is a wonderful thing that promotes a sense of community, connects people, and has replaced the god-awful, more traditional ways of meeting people.  Talking about some subjects is just inviting people to attack you, despite your best intentions. Online dating may help a few couples get together but the overall effect on relationships between men and women has been damaging, both mentally and physically. People are more polyamorous, less faithful, more likely to transmit sexual disease, more disconnected from their communities, more self-absorbed and narcissistic, fueled by instant-validation through responses to their online personas.  I haven't even got started in discussing how the consumption of alcohol and cocaine go hand-in-hand with the online dating hookup culture, either. :)  Overall, online dating is yet another barrier to natural attraction. You have non-corporate entities using the media to shame men into fearing for their jobs if they make an awkward, drunken pass at a woman, or scaring men into being less able to approach women in public with things such as:  http://www.goodnightoutcampaign.org/area/vancouver/  This ""climate of harassment"" further pushes dating into the online realm, acting as the ""safe"" barrier to allow men and women to talk online.

You are so quick to assume things about people, how does that reflect on your claim of having an open mind? Why would you equate introversion with not having a grasp on the outside world? Do you honestly think everyone who identifies as an introvert just sits in their apartment with the blinds closed on their computers?   perhaps people like you should try listening and understanding where other people are coming from rather than going off on rambling tangents. maybe you need to accept that online dating is not inherently good or bad and that it depends on the people using it, and what they want out of it."

The exact same argument can be used for heroine, cocaine, meth and other hard drugs. I'm positive we could find high functioning people on those drugs, but for the majority of the users, it harms and degrades their lives.  Again, you cannot even begin to debate any of the points I brought up, instead you bring your ad hominem attack on me for, apparently, ""not listening and understanding where other people are coming from.""  I've spent the last 6 years of my life dedicated to understanding the motivations behind people's sex and dating, immersing myself in the lifestyles of the people I meet downtown. In an urban environment, online dating is yet another one of the 1000 cuts that has mangled our social fabric.  Please, engage me on any of the points I brought up. The polyamourous nature of online dating, the increased sexual disease risk, the ease at which we ditch partners who aren't 100% perfect, the constant striving for something better, the carrot of a modern family life dangled so far above our heads that we choose easy hedonism instead. Are you married for almost 7 years without children? That might say a lot about your own ability to understand -why- you're even in a relationship, and where it is going.  Online dating is inherently bad. It is an electronic, inorganic method of meeting and dating. It is similar to being a rat in a box, pulling an automated level to get a piece of cheese. The cheese is never-ending and drowns the rat in his own apathy."

vancouver,3dduvf,tuggspeedmin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:29:34 2015 UTC,"But buying a house is usually a pretty decent investment.  For example my condo.  40,000  investment (Down payment)    If the condo sits at 0% I pay $300 more than if I was renting. $800 a month goes to principal.  That's $5000 a year or 15% gain (after subtracting savings in renting).   If the condo increases with inflation (1.5%)  I made 30%  If the condo increase 10% (like it did in the last year)  I just made 115% of my original investment.   What if the Housing market drops?!  Well,  I lost 70% of my portfolio in 2008, the stock market is not insulated from housing.  But Yes, a giant drop in the value of your house/condo could be worse than losing it on the market.   The biggest issue is that housing is not liquid.    The costs to get in and out is ASTRONOMICAL.     Real-estate thieves agents, city/provincial fees  etc.   Also if interest rates go up (slowly)  You'll make more money on the market and housing prices go down.         In the End,  Renting is great to hedge your bets.   Though if you can make 20% average (even 10%)  you should stop working right now and get some leverage.   Work those options.

At $200k you probably won't make the admin fees back on any reasonable tax.  $100k might be a different question, though.

Tesla's pricing scheme in Canada is essentially the USD price adjusted for exchange rate, plus the Canadian duty because of the battery. And then a 15% tax on top of that. Once the gigafactory starts production they ought to drop in price here considerably. Unless our government comes up with another excuse to line their pockets."

Landlords are just as much market takers on price.  $100 too high on rent and you go a month without rent which is extremely inefficient.   On a $1500 a month place, being $100 off on rent has a 15 month recovery time if you go a month unrented."

If there is a circumstance where owners are losing money, they will usually renovate/upgrade/sell the property if they don't see an opportunity to make more money.  There are some exceptions where owners are renting property to offset the carrying costs of owning a property (as opposed to renting property to generate profit, which is what most people who have multiple units are doing)."

vancouver,3d9g0q,hnryv,17,Tue Jul 14 16:24:55 2015 UTC,The idea behind taxes is to redistribute wealth.   No it's not.  The idea behind taxes is to provide funds to the government to run government and to provide services to the taxpayer.
vancouver,3d9g0q,ruddiger22,2,Tue Jul 14 16:29:27 2015 UTC,It can be both and in many areas (including Canada) it is.
vancouver,3d9g0q,hedonisticaltruism,6,Tue Jul 14 17:11:42 2015 UTC,"It may have that effect, depending on the services provided by government.  But to say that the ""idea behind taxes is to redistribute wealth"" is incorrect."
vancouver,3d9g0q,ruddiger22,0,Tue Jul 14 17:19:59 2015 UTC,"It's not incorrect (but used solely, it's a very esoteric description):  Governments use different kinds of taxes and vary the tax rates. This is done to distribute the tax burden among individuals or classes of the population involved in taxable activities, such as business, or to redistribute resources between individuals or classes in the population. Historically, the nobility were supported by taxes on the poor; modern social security systems are intended to support the poor, the disabled, or the retired by taxes on those who are still working. In addition, taxes are applied to fund foreign aid and military ventures, to influence the macroeconomic performance of the economy (the government's strategy for doing this is called its fiscal policy; see also tax exemption), or to modify patterns of consumption or employment within an economy, by making some classes of transaction more or less attractive.  I should even go back to my statement and correct it by saying that it actually always redistributes wealth by pure definition that money/value is transferred."

vancouver,3d9g0q,mercier153,9,Tue Jul 14 17:11:35 2015 UTC,We should also tax anyone that has a bike worth more than $250.00. Nobody needs an $800 mountain bike.

There is a significant difference in weight, speed, grip etc.    Im not saying that I agree with the tax that is mentioned.  All I was saying is that if you have 80k to spend on your car, then you are rich or bad with money.  Spending 800 on a bike is very different than 80K.  Especially because bikes dont require fuel or insurance."

They have 1.5 years of average household income for a car while still paying taxes, still paying for their house (if it isn't paid for) still saving, still going out to eat, possibly travelling etc. Obviously they are more rich. In a society like Vancouver we might not see it because there are many rich people who flaunt wealth, but that does not make them not rich as well."

To be able to have 80k in the bank that they are able to spend on a car, that is a lot of money.  If you work one year and make 75k, you get taxes off, GST, gas, housing, food, internet, phone etc.  This person is able to spend 80k on a car alone.  I assume you are not buying an 80k car and living in a bad part of town, so to be able to afford that means they make well over 100k."

Personal property laws are typically governed by provincial legislation such as the provincial Sale of Goods Acts. Likewise, the common law rules inherited from the United Kingdom are largely still in force.

Long commuters already pay higher rates, but not enough to discourage it or offset the disproportionate costs they leverage to other tax payers that commute short distances.   Further thought edit: people managed without these massive trucks that started to be built in the past 20 years. Up until the 00s the default pickup size was a hell of a lot smaller than it is now.

Sorry but they need to provide more information to the public about what they are paying their employees.   and thus only recruit the crappiest of managers?   Says who? What's to say that the contracts these employees have are not paying way too high?  Why the blanket statement of support?
vancouver,3da6hv,menkar,0,Tue Jul 14 22:52:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I thought you were just complaining about the existence of the severance packages period. I think you're just asking that the amounts be public knowledge, which is more fair.   There are pros and cons to having public sector salaries and contracts be publicly available. One con is individual privacy - would you want your own salary posted on the internet? Another is that people tend to be outraged at all executive compensation regardless of what it actually is. There is a certain level of pay required to be competitive in recruiting. Of course, the pros are increased transparency and accountability like you mention. I'm not sold on which way I prefer, but I think I misinterpreted your original post so sorry about that."

Because domestic cat breeds do not have a long history in North America, they are essentially a human supported invasive species that kills for sport rather than food, and considered the second major factor in wild birds' declines."

If one day, a coyote eats her (doubtful, as I doubt it could catch her, she can scale a tree in about two seconds) then that's life. That's nature. What isn't natural is keeping an animal who clearly prefers her freedom inside against her will in order to have the illusion of 'control'."

They had some excellent points, it is no more acceptable for my neighbours cat to shit in my yard than it would be for their dog, and you don't see cat people following around their cat with plastic bags like you do with dog owners.

The Dollarama has those older styled paper bags, they're tall and narrow, but do the trick. You can get a bag of 40 for $1. Just add some newspaper or paper towel to soak up anything that's wet.   I guess you can use newspapers as well for the bags. Just take a regular sized shoebox, wrap that with the newspaper, leave one end open up top, remove the shoebox, and then just add another layer for absorbing moisture.  Also, make sure you change it out every few days, or mold's going to be your new problem."

vancouver,3dbcz7,stumo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:54:31 2015 UTC,The is a difference in biodegradable and compostable. Compostable is better than biodegradable because a compostable container is usually made from a corn material that can be broken down 100% whereas biodegradable means only certain parts of the container has weaker bonds that breakdown faster than the rest of the container. The biodegradable container either a plastic fork or bag will only breakdown partially.

vancouver,3danza,ArchieMoses,4,Wed Jul 15 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"Fuck that! The dude was waving a gun for 5 hours while surrounded by police. Finally after the fifth hour, decides to get out of his vehicle, with his gun in hand, to go for -- oh, maybe it was a midday stroll!  No, fuck that! Getting out of the vehicle with gun in hand itself was a provocation against the police and deserved a shot to the face.  Let's stop defending idiots. Why is no one asking -- how did this man get a handgun in the first place? Carrying a handgun in public is an offence that warrants execution. The minute you buy a handgun is the moment you make the decision that you're going to get shot for being a threat. There is no reason for a citizen to be waving a handgun around in public, EVER.  Fuck this bullshit, waiting 5 hours while the criminal cockles everyone! The reason no one acted sooner was exactly situations like this, the criminal getting sympathy from the public, and the police officer who did his job is getting harassed.   Too often the police are blamed for using too much force. This is NOT one of those times. This was exactly an appropriate use of force for the situation. And the gun did NOT have to be pointed at a police officer's face, before the officer was warranted to shoot the suspect. There is absolutely no reason for it to be that close of a risk."
vancouver,3danza,shoetiefreely,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:21:36 2015 UTC,What 'accounts' make you say he fired his gun at the wrong time?
vancouver,3danza,MW250,0,Tue Jul 14 22:09:54 2015 UTC,"Officers have told IIO investigators the plastic and live rounds that hit Bayrami were fired in quick succession, as close as milliseconds apart. Use of force expert Orville Nickel told CTV News there may have been a breakdown in communications. “It seems as though they were trying to go with a non-lethal method. Somehow the lethal got mixed up with the non-lethal and they were executed simultaneously,” Nickel said."
vancouver,3danza,idspispopd,5,Tue Jul 14 22:16:08 2015 UTC,"Way to take that quote completely out of context.  His job/role was to fire his lethal rifle rounds if the handgun was pointed at officers, which it was, the non lethal rounds were fired from other officers that didnt have lethal weapons drawn. They had less than a second to respond which is why everyone fired, as is the standard procedure in a standoff, and that makes it SEEM like a clusterfuck when in reality everyone did their job."
vancouver,3danza,iTzDusty,5,Wed Jul 15 06:12:19 2015 UTC,"IMHO, shit happens.  If this had been an innocent person then I think the prosecution might be warranted.  But this is a case of an unstable armed person who put himself in the cross hairs.  And the benefit of the doubt must go to the officer."
vancouver,3danza,mcain,-1,Tue Jul 14 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"It was a controlled situation. Any other profession where a mistake results in the loss of life it would be expected there would be a review, that is what was done here. Just because it was a cop and an unstable guy doesn't mean we shouldn't try for a better outcome."
vancouver,3danza,idspispopd,2,Wed Jul 15 00:13:55 2015 UTC,"I would assume there were multiple reviews by multiple agencies.  How or why Crown proceeded to lay charges seems baffling. Clearly they couldn't meet the burden of proof and have not only subjected the officer and his family to tremendous stress, but they've wasted taxpayer resources on a fruitless endeavor.  How many charges against others were stayed because Crown didn't have resources to adequately prosecute them while they diddled around on this case?"

vancouver,3db9hi,shallowminded,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"True about ladder matches... I was just wondering if they did more with Matthews.  Last Ballroom Brawl had her going toe-to-toe with Bishop.  I mean, I appreciate her being booked strongly but come on, the size and strength difference there is too hard to ""suspend my disbelief"" over.  A Nicole Matthews match where she's facing someone much bigger than her should be built around hope spots."
vancouver,3db9hi,DJ_Molten_Lava,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"If anything, she was the most credible competitor going into this match. She's bigger than Billy Suede, probably weighs more than Artemis Spencer, and nobody cares about Ethan HD. She didn't seem outclassed. That and four man matches lean less on any one particular competitor. Matthews can get blasted and be out of it for five minutes while the match goes on around her"

I'm also more interested in non-espresso coffee. I try to get around to a different local roaster each week to see what they've got. IME there's a lot more variety outside of espresso in the Vancouver roaster scene. The only roaster that I know of that specializes in espresso is Milano.

Personally I think having the map dominating above the fold is bad design though, especially if I try to scroll down while hovering on it the map magnifies.  You should have your latest blog posts front and center and the map could be available on the sidebar.  Also it aids readability and interest when the first paragraph or so is readable without having to enter the post.  Also I think it would make for a more well rounded blog if you could also touch on other aspect of coffee such as (for instance) the different methods of preparation and the varying characteristics of coffee from different locations.   Beautiful blog and I will be adding it to my RSS feed as I agree it is something that is underserved currently.

vancouver,3dc6vc,vansoftware,7,Wed Jul 15 06:03:37 2015 UTC,"Beautful location, with tons of stuff nearby.  If you're planning a reno, there's probably asbestos in the drywall, flooring, and/or ceiling popcorn. It can be dealt with, but at a cost and a hassle.  Apart from that, check the strata minutes to check for any issues with upkeep, (roof, boiler, etc.)  Sometimes, older buildings will have a mix of older, lower-income owners who bought when it was cheap, and younger, newer owners who bought after property values went up. This can create a conflict when younger buyers want to update things but older residents can't afford the additional costs.  For example, our building has single-pane windows some of us have been fighting to replace with double pane windows for noise and especially for energy efficiency. However, people voted not to replace them becuase they felt the upfront cost was too high. Meanwhile, we're all blowing cash out the windows when it's cold.  Definitely get a good home inspector to go through the building before you go through with the purchase. Talk to the property manager, as well as any residents in the building you can pull aside.  Edit: If you're diligent about checking into potential problems and see that they are under control, an older building can be perfectly fine, and in fact offer significant advantages to a newer building for the same price. For example, we have a lovely yard to hang out in and far more space than a similarly located and priced newer building."

People will rent out their condos to scumbags.    Older condos will need upkeep.  a 40 year old building should have had a re-pipe by now.  If it has not then you're gonna see 'water leaks' a lot in the strata minutes. Inspect the whole building, not just your unit.  If you have a street facing view, you get traffic noise.  If you have an alley view, you get garbage smell, and the music of garbage trucks with autustic controllers who slam the garbage container 3 times, not to empty it, but because of impulse. slam-slam, slam-slam, slam-slam at 6 am.  Do the balconies need replacing - that's 20 or so grand in the next 10 years.  How old is the roof?  A re-roof is 5 to 10 grand.  Balcony - repipe- roof - siding - the major repairs you can expect in the next 10 years. The depreciation report should list these."
vancouver,3dc6vc,v6bot2,5,Wed Jul 15 04:43:50 2015 UTC,"This is all true.   Older wooden buildings have huge noise issues and the tenants are all low income, which brings problems, problems, problems.

vancouver,3dcq97,marrwillo,5,Wed Jul 15 06:24:36 2015 UTC,"There is free parking up to 3 hours on Granville Island.  Then you could drive downtown and park at a nearby lot (e.g. the one under Pacific Centre mall).  Once in downtown, there is a free shuttle bus service to/from the Capilano Suspension bridge.    Depending on when you are coming, and your desired order of activities, this may work out to be cheaper than parking near a station and then taking transit downtown (Translink day pass costs $11). Of course, this also means that you'd be driving a greater distance, so there's that to consider."
vancouver,3dcq97,kLAUphoto,0,Wed Jul 15 09:59:22 2015 UTC,"I'd leave the car at home or at the ferry terminal.   My GF and I have a few days off next week, we were going to take a day trip to Victoria.  Then I looked up the Ferry fare.  ~$185 return. The PCL Bus? $31.20 + $17 Ferry Fare, Each way.  It would be cheaper to take a car!    So then we looked at the walk on Ferry fare as you're suggesting.  It's really not much of a savings either.  Parking @ Terminal  plus $17 +$2.50 Tansit Bus fare.  $80 just to get there and back, and having to take a transit bus plus whatever parking costs for the day. Probably over $100 in transportation costs.   Forget it. We're going to the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State instead.  We will probably spend less than $75 in gas AND take a Wa State ferry for <$25CAD."

Seriously the train is all you need for when you are traveling through the city core or major shopping areas. Once you pass downtown though, there is no train so you'll have to drive to the bridge and back, skipping downtown till you park somewhere past it. You'll also be closer to the ferry if you do that after the bridge part of your trip."

The oceans and the trees do help absorb the smoke yes but its all the precipitation and clouds that took away the smoke. Day after rain storms usually you can see right to Mt. Baker.

vancouver,3d60fa,omega_point,5,Mon Jul 13 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"Nationalism/Patriotism among most Iranians is very strong. There is a tendency to exaggerate the beauty and good aspects - this is probably due to the fact that western media focuses so much on the negative aspects.  I personally think that this polarized/biased type of thinking is naive and simple-minded. Both sides are equally wrong.  In the case of pollution, Tehran, Isfahan and Mashhad are terrible.  The nature of Iran is beautiful, but so is most of other parts of the earth. Also ""Iran"" doesn't have anything to do with it. It's the beauty of earth.  One awesome thing about that region is you have an amazing range of different climates. You can go from the hot desert of Maranjaab to the gorgeous jungles and mountains of Maasaal in 15 hours drive.

Backpacking typically comes with hiking, carrying loads on your back, uncomfortable beds, long bus rides, drinking and overall shenanigans.  To suggest that you have an infection which causes back pain and nothing else over the past two years is incredibly unlikely and an irresponsibly poor suggestion."
vancouver,3dcxxf,VelvetJustice,3,Wed Jul 15 20:11:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation (and for bringing back memories..)
vancouver,3dcxxf,VelvetJustice,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"No problem.  Have you seen a pt or rmt? A gp can write a referral for insurance purposes. You don't need a referral for a chiropractor but as you've already mentioned its out of pocket.   A good indicator of how ""good"" your health practitioner is is their ability to teach/suggest exercises for you to do on your own. Treatment sessions are good and necessary, but compliance with exercises is an important component of recovery.  Specific to chiropractors if they start suggesting adjustments for things like indigestion and earache I'd consider that a red flag.   Good luck finding relief from your back injury, I know you difficult they can be."
vancouver,3dcxxf,vancouvertroll012,2,Wed Jul 15 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen a physio or massage therapist, no. I thought that massage therapy is just giving massages to help sooth temporary sore muscles.. I'm very uninformed in these areas though, is it a treatment for chronic pain as well? And it's regarded as much more legitimate than chiro?  I didn't realize that physio can be covered by provincial insurance if referred to by GP -- in that case, that would definitely be something I'd rather explore before a chiro. So any great pt/rmt you know in the area?  This is also a reply to your other comment: So another piece of information here is that I've also developed a lot of IBS symptoms shortly after the pain started (frequent bowel, very very gasy, frequent stitch-like pain, consistent general abdominal discomfort). A gastro did diagnose me with IBS, and I understand that IBS can be triggered by stress, so my theory is that maybe it got triggered by me being stressful about being in constant pain and not being able to be active again.  But because I have some gut related problems as well, I'm not ruling out that maybe it IS parasite related.  Really not sure, just keeping all options open.    But as you said, most likely a muskeloskeletal injury."
vancouver,3dcxxf,FJetson,2,Wed Jul 15 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"Well I would suggest a pt/rmt route myself, however I didn't realize that you did not have supplementary insurance. However, if you are on premium assistance they will pay a small portion of the fee for ten treatments. If money is a concern I would try to find any that offer a sliding scale. It may be worth considering additional insurance if you're able, as it seems you would get use of it.  RMT can help with chronic pain, they are not a relaxation style experience. And most that I've been to will suggest exercises to help imbalances. Pt are probably the health professionals who are best at managing soft tissue injuries and generally work with their patients to restore function.  Well the IBS s/s would have been good to know before. But I'm assuming that GI saw you while you were symptomatic and did tests then.  I'm also assuming the pain that you're searching to solve is back pain that gets worse on movement.  I am not a Doctor but my advice to you if you do not have a GP is to make a list of the tests that you've had done and the approximate timing and nature of your issues. Then tell them that you are not looking for narcotics but a referral to pt/rmt. They may be able to suggest one, or you could just get a general referral. The list can help them with their ddx.  Your stool tests if they were looking for parasites (o+p kit) or blood ( the envelope with 3 smaller envelops inside) are sensitive to ""exotic"" pathogens. Travellers and foreigners are frequent enough that tests are commonly done."

There are a few trails here and a boulder you could climb. You may want to rent a a bike close to Canada Place and bike the 8.5ks till Science World. Its an amazing ride, I do it every three to four days. While doing this you will go through Stanley Park and will have the opportunity (if you want) to go to the Aquarium (It's Awesome). Once you finish at Science world you can take the Sky Train back to Waterfront Station and drop of the bike where you got it. This should take 1-3 hours depending on how fit you are. The place I recommend is EZee Riders, because they have electric bikes, making the ride easier.  If you are feeling more adventurous, there is A Nude Hope: A Sci-fi Burlesque Adventure *There is the Gastown Grand Prix to watch. http://www.globalrelayggp.org/   That's all I got. Hope it helps."

From the record alone, I'd guess he's a young guy who just began accumulating an adult record. He's probably an addict trying to make some kind of living by selling drugs, but when he runs out of cash he steals things, and he's been getting more brazen as he goes, hence the home invasions.

It's pretty hard to find your keys, unlock the triggerlock/safe for your gun and then grab your ammo (possibly unlock that too) fast enough in that scenario. Even if you did, the fact you grabbed your weapon could be seen as a sign of intent to injure/kill the home invader without knowing what kind of danger they present.

Only in a minority of those cases do they draw their guns as a threat of force. And again only in a tiny minority of cases do they fire their gun and only in a subset of those cases was the suspect killed.   Comparing deaths against utility seems wrong.   Children do die of unintended events all the time. Are firearms really a huge threat when compared to other deaths? Let's take a look at what the CDC says:  http://www.cdc.gov/injury/images/lc-charts/leading_causes_of_injury_deaths_highlighting_unintentional_injury_2013-a.gif  It seems that, while unfortunate, deaths by firearm are not a leading cause or even a major cause as compared to the vast array of 'threats' that resulted in deaths of children.

I agree with you about Canada's lack of a gun crime problem and rudderless mental health care system.   I just think the lack of gun crime is a reason to not race into castle doctrine.

vancouver,3d6saq,oilernut,6,Tue Jul 14 05:18:21 2015 UTC,"Technically true.  Wasn't suggesting shooting someone (especially someone fleeing), but it's my belief that self defence laws (especially if the case involves firearms) are designed to financially destroy anyone who has to legally defend themselves after being automatically charged by the crown.  The crown has essentially unlimited resources to use against the average Joe.  They can and will throw every charge against you if you defended yourself with a weapon of any kind.  I believe this is intentional as to discourage the average citizen to attempt to protect themselves (and instead rely on the police).    Forgive the cliche, but when seconds count, the police are minutes away.  Not espousing violence here, but it's pretty bad when a victim of crime is further victimized by a ""criminal justice"" system after the fact."

vancouver,3d502p,spibbs,3,Tue Jul 14 06:37:47 2015 UTC,"If the analysis in the article is correct, then we're seventy years past the average interval.  The longer it waits, the more energy is built up and the more likely that it all releases in one big event, rather than several smaller events.  So, 'the big one' could involve ground movement like this:   will drop by as much as six feet and rebound thirty to a hundred feet to the west—losing, within minutes, all the elevation and compression it has gained over centuries.   What's your rough guess, what would happen to an older concrete building when subjected to that type of force?"
vancouver,3d502p,djn808,10,Mon Jul 13 20:23:44 2015 UTC,These types of quakes we are subjected to are supposedly the most damaging variant for infrastructure  I just would NOT want to be on the West Coast of the Island. 5-10 minutes of shaking and a 5 foot immediate drop in elevation.

vancouver,3d502p,touchable,4,Tue Jul 14 06:00:52 2015 UTC,"You can't answer that kind of question deterministically. There's a huge amount of statistics that goes into:  1) The figures that you're quoting. Six feet drop and 30-100 feet laterally movement COULD be accurate, or it could turn out to be higher or lower. These are based on our measurements of plate movements, and our inferences of how much stress is stored in the plates.  2) Where exactly along the fault the epicentre will be. If the initial epicentre is somewhere down the coast near Seattle, and then it's followed by smaller fault ruptures closer to us that dissipate energy in a more controlled manner, we could be better off. If the whole 400-600km length of fault ruptures at once, it could be catastrophic.  3) The soil conditions at the site of any building you're trying to analyze have a huge impact on how the building will behave. Softer soils like silt and clay tend to amplify the ground motions, which can be devastating, while rock just transmits the waves through because it's relatively stiff. But this doesn't necessarily mean that buildings on rock (most of DT Vancouver) are safe.  4) Building construction and design. Even though we lacked the building code provisions in 60's/70's concrete buildings that we have today, this doesn't necessarily mean they're ""weak"". Chile has historically had a very similar building code to us, so we can take some clues from what happened in their recent earthquake. As the previous comment mentioned, a lot of thin walls (8"" or less) did not do well, especially when they had large openings at ground level for parkades (resulting in a ""weak story"" effect at the base).  The design philosophy in the 60s and 70s was to simply design the building to take a ""seismic force"", which causes buildings to be very stiff, but any weak links can result in severe damage. Nowadays for very tall concrete buildings, they're actually designed for displacement performance rather than forces. The building behaves more flexibly, and because it has a longer period, the force it needs to be designed for is lower.  tl;dr: We can't know for sure, there's a lot of seismic, geological, and, to a lesser extend, structural uncertainty."
vancouver,3d502p,djn808,10,Mon Jul 13 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly I am immensely skeptical many of the buildings in downtown Vancouver can withstand a 9.0-9.3 Earthquake. two meters of broken glass piled in the streets. I wouldn't want to be anywhere near the Core.   A big thing I've noticed is ~70% of megathrust quakes like this have large foreshocks as well. If we get a large 7.0-8.0 earthquake in Cascadia, we have 10 minutes-a few weeks to really strap down before the mainshock hits.  We will also have months-a year of large 6.0-8.0 aftershocks as well, which are big enough to worry about on their own. Some megathrust quakes (Chile) Had over 20(!!) 6.0+ aftershocks within ~72 hours of the mainshock, including some very large ones.   Victoria worries me as well as we have tons of heritage buildings and I bet lots of unreinforced masonry as well.

Thanks to that work, we now know that the Pacific Northwest has experienced forty-one subduction-zone earthquakes in the past ten thousand years. If you divide ten thousand by forty-one, you get two hundred and forty-three, which is Cascadia’s recurrence interval: the average amount of time that elapses between earthquakes. That timespan is dangerous both because it is too long—long enough for us to unwittingly build an entire civilization on top of our continent’s worst fault line—and because it is not long enough. Counting from the earthquake of 1700, we are now three hundred and fifteen years into a two-hundred-and-forty-three-year cycle."

Every airport in the region will be unflyable for a week until we can adequately clean/repair them, all water and sewage and gas lines rupture.

Some megathrust earthquakes (Chile) had up to 20(!!!) 6.0+ aftershocks within 72 hours after the mainshock. And yea they'll continue for up to a year. Some aftershocks can be huge in their own right.  Pulling people out of rubble before aftershocks cause more structural damage will be important.

vancouver,3d5tc9,two_off,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"All things being equal, adsl over cable.  ADSL is a dedicated line vs the shared pipe to the node that cable is, so you will get more consistent bandwidth and ping rate.    That being said, it is rarely that cut and dry;    ADSL tends to cost more on setup, and the high end speeds can have a limited zone that it can be offered in.  But those higher profiles have great uploads if you need that, and getting a static IP is super easy if required.    Cable is less distance dependent, so you can get those faster speeds farther out, price wise it can be more aggressive on savings, also active transfers are mostly automated, no dispatch required, and can be setup before you contact your current cable internet provider, ensuring zero down time.   All said, it really depends on the situation, your usage requirements, budget and personal preferences.  If you have more questions shoot away here, or a PM if you want."

I always got the ""Telus treats us like garbage"" spiel. Always something with Telus not working.  Eventually, I got fed up when the service stopped working and never worked again... Then they had the audacity to keep trying to bill me throughout for two months AFTER. Then, they claimed that I had service and received packets when my modem wasn't even plugged in.  Then, they threatened to use a card  I only provided for a one time charge to take my money. I had asked them not to keep that card on file and not only did they ignore that request, they threatened to charge me with it. I actually kept them on the line as I cancelled the card, telling them that I believed I was at risk for fraud by Lightspeed. The card was cancelled, I told Lightspeed to do whatever they wanted, I was done with them and if they tried to touch my credit, I would be suing their balls off. Sure enough they tried to charge the cancelled credit card.  So basically, their tech support was friendly, but the service was garbage and there isn't enough four letter words in the English language to tell you how I feel about their billing."

However, for both of them you do need to buy/rent a new modem for about $100. You may also need to purchase a router depending on your old modem's abilities.  If anyone has any third-party way of buying the modems for cheaper, their advice would be much appreciated.   Edit: Looks like Teksavvy is also charging an $80 cable move fee, whatever that means. But it's still going to be about half of what we're paying on Shaw, so the price difference quickly makes up for it."

I grew up on a ravine and have spent a lot of time hiking around the north shore and Coquitlam back country and if there's one thing I've it is to stay on the trail unless you are very certain where you are and what's nearby. As a visitor just follow the signs and familiarize yourself with the map ahead of time including surrounding trails in case you end up on the wrong trail. Definitely tell someone where you're going, when and where you're entering the trail.  As a tourist I would suggest going to whistler for two nights. I would leave Van early (7am) and stop at the Squamish Chief on the way for a hike to peak 2. Then I would head to Whistler brewing for beer and nachos before checking in at my hotel for a nap followed by an afternoon gondola ride on the peak2peak :D"

vancouver,3d3euu,nomeanswhatever,50,Mon Jul 13 05:14:13 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately on this issue Tyabji has launched a tirade with the words “growing hysteria” and calling a strongly supported public campaign “wrong” without getting her facts straight.  The petition in question asks the government to review an existing rate. It is not about “selling” water. It is an administrative fee that existed under the old Water Act for surface water and is now being extended to groundwater under the new Water Sustainability Act.  Tyabji writes “Currently, Nestle pays the same fees that everyone else pays for access to water.” In fact currently Nestle does not pay anything for access to water because they use groundwater and BC has never regulated groundwater before. When the Water Sustainability Act comes into effect in 2016, Nestle, like every other non-domestic groundwater user, will have to get a licence (free, the licence fees are being waived) and pay a “rental rate” for access to water just as surface water users always have.  This does not open the door to NAFTA, it does not change water to a commodity. It provides revenue on a cost recovery basis for the government’s regulation of water in the province.  The point of the petition is that the rates the government has set, a maximum of $2.25 per million litres, will not provide sufficient cost recovery to do the work that needs to be done to properly regulate water use in the province. The WaterWealth Project and SumOfUs are asking the government to review an existing rate structure. Nothing new. Just review the rates and show British Columbians how the rates they set will fund the full implementation of the Water Sustainability Act.  The Environment Minister and more recently MLA Laurie Throness have doggedly dodged the real issue straw man arguments of commodification of water, or of businesses being harmed by loss of access to water. We can only wonder whether their reluctance to even review the rates comes from the fact that LNG fracking, an industry favoured by government and which Tyabji’s husband was reported to be receiving $12,500 a month to advocate for, uses immense amounts of water."

I am trying to wrap my head around these issues - can I ask (because you seem more familiar than myself) - in what way would a larger administration fee help regulate water in the province (how does that work)? What kind of fee would be beneficial and to what end?   Presumably nestle or other canadian water bottling companies will roll whatever administration fee there is into the cost of business, so it is not going to be a deterrent or limit bottling of canadian water to have a higher fee. So if the goal of greater administration fees is not less bottled water than what is it?"

They helped Pinochet gain power in Chile in the name of fighting communism, but were actually helping large multinationals gain unfettered access to resouces without having to give anything back to the people. In Bolivia the water ultilities were completely privatized, which eventually lead to riots over the price of access to water.

They're not right wing like fascists or royalists are, in the sense of truly embracing natural law and natural hierarchies. They're just a little less crazy about social services and equality than the modern Left would like.   the Keynesian model    Keynes is the guy famous for saying you could bury cash in a mineshaft and that it would be an economic good to have people go dig it up. There's a reason that Austrian School economics are still a going concern: not everyone believes in this boom-bust debt driven economy which may very well be a ticking time bomb for all of us. Our economy punishes people for being prudent, saving, and planning, and rewards people for spending mindlessly and taking easy credit. At some point, those bills come due for collection, and the result is a 2008-style crash.   They helped Pinochet gain power in Chile in the name of fighting communism   Implying ""the neoliberals"" are sufficiently a group so as to be a ""they"" committing actions together in some kind of conspiratorial fashion. It's an ideology, not a group.   I disagree with the ideology, myself, but that doesn't mean we can unfairly castigate everyone who holds it as being responsible for Pinochet.   free market driven economic ideology   Somehow these are dirty words to many Canadians, but the free market is an incredible tool enabling competition to find the best solutions to problems, including resourcing, logistics, and pricing; it has time and again proven itself to be better than a centralized economy by using competition to continually seek better solutions rather than having mandating services from a monopoly backed up by force of law.   At the same time, we do need controls on the free market, which is why people like the OP and myself are against the commoditization of water. The free market would absolutely find the most efficient and profitable ways of bottling and selling water, but would not adequately concern itself with long term impacts of doing so, and so we need to retain some control. Sometimes, that comes in the form of regulation and taxing; sometimes it comes in the form of simply excluding a market entirely."

vancouver,3d3euu,Pierre_Putin,22,Mon Jul 13 06:40:48 2015 UTC,"This whole anti-nestle thing is getting absurd and really speaks to how shortsighted the vocal opponents are to the whole thing.  First off, the source of the water is an aquafir running in to Kawkawa, in Hope BC.  Hope gets TWO METERS of rain a year, plus snow melt run off.  Kawkawa lake is never going to dry up.  Kawkawa lake drains in to the Coquilhalla river, and then in to the Fraser River and out to sea.  There's no hydro on these rivers, no agriculture, no civic water supplies.  The water is a complete surplus. It is a totally sustainable and renewable natural resource.   Nestle has come to the small town of Hope.  There's next to no industry in Hope.  Nestle builds this bottling plant to sell water to Canadians who like to buy bottle water.  I bet there are at least 50 full time jobs directly generated by this plant.  In a small town, that's a lot of jobs.  Nestle pays taxes on the property they own, plus business taxes.  The people working there pay income, property and sales taxes.  The town of Hope benefits from this bottling plant, which is made possible by a totally sustainable and renewable natural resource.  Nestle donates money to things around the community.  They spent $80'000 to improve the road to the plant.  $60'000 for the School District $40'000 to build a park in Hope!  When Hope was under a Boil Water advisory, They donated drinking water to the town!  But the No to Everything crowd seems to think that we should stick it to Nestle.  They they are somehow raping the province, and taking advantage of low rates for industrial water licenses.  Well what happens when Nestle just says forget about it, and shuts down the plant?  All those jobs are now lost. The people living in Hope lose out on significant tax revenues.  What message does this send to other companies that might want to invest in natural resources in British Columbia?  They're not going to invest in BC, create jobs and maintain the economy.    The shortsightedness of these idiots is beyond my understanding."
vancouver,3d3euu,AdiposeFin,11,Mon Jul 13 07:54:27 2015 UTC,"Kawkawa lake is never going to dry up.   This is an irresponsible way to look at any resource.

vancouver,3d3euu,ryanthekiwi,0,Mon Jul 13 08:33:08 2015 UTC,"It would be pretty irresponsible for a company to invest a significant t amount of money to build the plant, make and market the product if they didn't first examine the projected lifetime of the source.  As I said, Hope BC gets 2 meters of rain fall a year.  If you took a 100x100m square and dumped 2m of rain on it, that's 20 Million litres of water.   How much water is nestle bottling? 2.5 million litres? 5million? 10million???  It's literally a drop in the bucket here.  Don't forget, that if nestle didn't bottle that water, it would all go unused and just run out to the sea.    So again, this is a BAD use of a renewable resource?????"

vancouver,3d3euu,ParkingPaky,2,Mon Jul 13 08:06:12 2015 UTC,It's not about Nestle. It's about the fees the province will charge every non-domestic water user in BC. The fees are cost recovery for good governance of water in the province. The petition asks the government to review the rates and show British Columbians how the rate they set will do the job it is intended to do.  Under the proposed fee schedule Nestle would pay less than $600 per year. Does anyone think that if the fee were raised on bottling such that Nestle would pay $1200 or even $1800 per year they would shut down their western Canadian operation and leave? How silly is that suggestion?

vancouver,3d3euu,touchable,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:09:01 2015 UTC,Tax money isn't meant to be hoarded and used only to support private enterprise. It's meant to be used to do things that the people want.

Things that the people want include education for our kids, health care, garbage collection, utilities, highways and bridges, welfare for the less fortunate, etc.  Extracting the rationale behind a nominal $600 fee for government regulation of a water extraction point is far down on most people's lists."

vancouver,3d3euu,natebx,2,Mon Jul 13 20:45:01 2015 UTC,"Okay, so do you suggest we have another plebiscite about whether the government should raise Nestle's water fee from $600/year to $1800/year, or heck even $20,000/year? Spend a few million dollars, kill a few thousand trees, and then we'll know exactly how many people in the province support it?  How about instead, we just let our democratically elected government do their job to the best of their judgement and abilities, and if you don't like it, vote for someone else in the next provincial elections. That's how an efficient democracy works."

Let's assume all of those are valid BC residents and no one has voted more than once (hard to believe), do you really want less than 10% of the population forcing the government to overturn a decision they thought was in the best interest of the province, just because they're worried about the optics of not listening to those people?  Regardless of what you think of the people that run the government (and of course there's bound to be both incompetence and corruption), you have to admit that the people whose job it is to know what's best for our water resources, our environment, and our economy, know a bit more about those topics than the average Joe at home who signs a petition he saw on Facebook or VancityBuzz."

You can not bulk export our water, but they are trying to export any they can as a 'finished product' in bottles. The problem is that shipping costs destroy profits and few exports actually happen due to that. Locally sourced water is usually cheaper. Even RO from salt water becomes cheaper at a certain point.  I've talked with a few executives who would have no problem paying a little more for ground source spring water. Most of them thought that price was too low and invited this sort of public shaming.

The post has been shared almost 14,000 times on Facebook and has been quoted on many blogs and news sites. Sadly, Tyabji's post is either misinformed or intentionally misleading, having errors of fact that are fundamental to the issue.  Tyabji wrote ""Do NOT demand that the province charge Nestle money""  But the province is already going to charge Nestle money, as they will every other non-domestic groundwater user, and as they always have every surface water user. No demand needed for that.  Tyabji wrote ""Currently, Nestle pays the same fees that everyone else pays for access to water.""  But no, currently Nestle pay nothing at all. Groundwater is not regulated in BC until next year when the Water Sustainability Act comes into effect. That is one of the most significant changes from the old 1909 Water Act to the new Water Sustainability Act. Someone claiming an interest in BC water issues going back to the 1980's (as Tyabji does in her post) should know that, unless their interest did not make it to the 2000's.  Tyabji wrote ""When Environment Minister Mary Polak says “We don’t sell water. We charge administration fees for the management of that resource"" she is trying to tell us this - we are NOT selling it.""  That is correct, but not quite in the way Tyabji used it. Correct, we are not selling it and no one is suggesting that we should. The petition asks the Minister to review the administration fee and show British Columbians how it will cover the costs of implementing the Water Sustainability Act, something that every British Columbian with an interest in transparent and accountable government should support.  Tyabji's post is a sad attack on the hard work of many concerned British Columbians who have taken an interest in modernization of BC water law, who have informed themselves and taken part in the public consultations, and who continue to be engaged in seeing the Act properly implemented to protect water in BC for the future.  It is hard not to wonder whether Tyabji's post might have been influenced by her husband's reported $12,500 per month from the government to advocate for LNG, an industry the government favours and which uses vast amounts of water.  Hopefully the post was only misinformed and not deliberately misleading. We have communicated with Tyabji about her errors and hope that she will take the time to confirm the truth of the issues and publicly rescind her post."

This isn't the same thing as a drought. A drought is when water demand far exceeds supply, and rationing is required (see Africa).  Additionally, Nestle is taking water from an underground aquifer, which we don't use for drinking water. We use water from the Capilano, Seymour, and Coquitlam reservoirs.

The most likely scenario right now is as follows:   Most of the design work is done by a firm in the US.

My contention is that the extreme increase in house prices over the past 10 years in Vancouver has been driven by a multitude of factors, some of which are common across Canada (easy access to money, low interest rates, CMHC-insured mortgages), and some of which are unique to Vancouver, such as the influx of foreign capital.

So you can normalize the nationwide factors, and you are left with a higher change in home prices (not just higher nominal home prices) in Vancouver over the same period.  This would indicate that there were factors driving the housing market specific to Vancouver that were not present nationwide.  This means that it's more than just low interest rates and the CMHC insured mortgages that have affected the price of homes in Vancouver.  To see evidence of foreign capital in Vancouver real estate you would have to look at the increase in incomes in Vancouver over that same period, and look at increase in rents, as well as data on net migration from foreign countries (including investor immigrants) over that time period.  Ideally you would like to know the details of every home sale, and if the purchaser is a resident of Vancouver or not - but even without those specifics, there is data freely available that shows the Vancouver housing market has not been driven by local incomes.

But with billions of people eating three meals a day. That 10 cents adds up.   With houses costing 5-7 millions in HK , the house prices for immigrants in their standards are cheap as hell."

Then goes up and down a bit in a nice forest. Can dip into the water below the falls which is pretty cool.

vancouver,3d529e,hafilax,4,Mon Jul 13 20:05:19 2015 UTC,"The West Lion is a very difficult scramble and incredibly dangerous if you have no scrambling experience. The last time I went up there I had to help 4 or 5 people get up it and back down because they were so struck by the exposure that they were nearly frozen. I was telling them where to put each foot and hand. One even thanked me later saying it would have been worse without my being there.  I don't know if it's been fixed up since I was there but most of the ropes were so warn then wouldn't hold a person's weight should somebody have fallen. The only properly equipped party was from the UBC VOC and they had ropes, harnesses and helmets. If the route is at all wet it would be really sketchy.  I think it is irresponsible for you to include the West Lion in that list alongside a bunch of hikes with no indication of how difficult it really is."
vancouver,3d529e,boredinvancouver,2,Mon Jul 13 22:20:50 2015 UTC,"You can do the majority of the lions-binkert trail, stopping at the shoulder, and thus avoid the dangerous scramble section. Many people do this, however I would second that the last portion is certainly not something for the inexperienced."
vancouver,3d529e,hafilax,2,Tue Jul 14 00:45:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  This is what boredinvancouver has to say (which I think is bad advice).    You can’t call yourself a Vancouver local until you’ve stood on top of a Lion and yodeled down to the city below you. Okay, that’s not true, but it sure feels good to make it to the top of The Lions, a mountain that is iconic in Vancouver. The trail to the Lions is full of switchbacks and forests and snow and quite a few people. A part of the Howe Sound Crest Trail (also an awesome journey if you want to do a multiple-day hike), the Lions Binkert trail is a fun, yet difficult trail. Bring a lunch for the top and spend an hour or so taking in the Lower Mainland from a different viewpoint.   It doesn't mention the mandatory rope climb, the slabby scramble, the fixed lines for protection or the class 4 climbing section."

You can choose to go up the Lion if you wish, or you can stay at the bottom of the scrambly parts and still be at the ""top of The Lions""."

vancouver,3d529e,pfunkman,2,Tue Jul 14 18:45:36 2015 UTC,"A fun one I did this fall is the circumnavigation of the Stawamus Chief via the little known 3rd peak via-ferrata.   Start at the parking lot at the base of the Chief, but hike North (you can go along the base for portions if you like). Eventually, you'll have to walk on the Mamquam forest service road to Hippy Camp (a big clearing on the right.often with climbing dirtbags camped there in their vans). From the clearing, hike up the trail to the base of the Slihany. It should be marked by orange diamonds. You'll get to the base of the Slihany and start walking towards the South. There will be a trail trending upwards at the far right end of the base. It is marked with orange diamonds. At some point, after climbing a ways you'll come to a fork. The right side of the fork leads towards the Chief (it is marked that way in fact). Follow this trail, continue following the orange diamonds. You'll start climbing up the ledges up the back side of third peak. Eventually you'll get to a rebar ladder. Follow this ladder up through a series of ledges. This will take you to a spot near the top of 3rd peak with a good view of North peak. From here, you can proceed to the summit and then over second peak and back to the first peak summit trail, or, descend from third peak rejoining the summit trail lower down. This is about a 3-4 hour excursion.  A fun adventurous day out on which you're unlikely to see any people. Just be careful, there are plenty of places to fall and die on this one."

The difference between something like Norvan Falls and something like Hanes Valley is massive...  The fact that you're looking for creek crossings and rate them with a scramble suggest that you don't have much experience. Be smart and safe. Check out www.vancouvertrails.com.

vancouver,3d529e,AdiposeFin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"Dog Mountain to Suicide Bluffs is one of my favorite short hikes. From the parking lot to Dog Mt is heavily traveled and not very adventurous. The fun bit is from Dog Mt to Suicide Bluffs. The trail is much less traveled and has some steep bits with fixed ropes.  The Flint and Feather trail is a steeper alternative to the Grind or BCMC. It has some easy scrambling with very nice views.  Mount Strachan via Christmas Gully has some boring heavily traveled parts, but Christmas Gully is more adventurous. It involves scrambling up a steep rocky creek bed.  Each of the above involve class 2 scrambling -- you'll occasionally need to use your hands, but there's never much danger of fatal falls. If you want to get into harder scrambling, Mt Brunswick is a great beginner scramble with more exposure, but it involves a steep 5 hour walk before the scramble near the summit. However, even Brunswick is probably more of class 2 than a class 3 scramble."
vancouver,3d6oj2,nowWhy,8,Mon Jul 13 23:08:25 2015 UTC,"Just from personal experiences across the country, it's usually sediment, due to local municipal maintenance, lowering regional water reservoirs, or immediate area construction or disruption that can shake the pipes and cause more sediments than normal to come down the pipes.   99% of the time it's nothing to worry about. That 1% can be unsafe and since you mentioned having a 1 year old I recall the ""danger... danger everywhere"" mindset... so if you want to do something proactive run all the taps in your home for at least 15 minutes, see if there is any change, boil any water for immediate use for 60 seconds, put it in containers in the fridge to cool down for consumption, and away you go. I have lived through some very long term boil water advisories out east and can attest to how annoying it can be, but whatever helps you sleep easier."

I Just came from Oregon (vacation)  I had the Gall to ask a brewery called the Wet Dog Cafe if it was OK if my dog could sit on the other side of the patio.   They looked at me like I was crazy, told me to bring him up, brought me a dog bowl of water and asked if my pooch wanted cookies.    We did the same thing in Portland.   IT WAS WONDERFUL.  I was able to have a beer and meal (which I otherwise could not have because I could not leave the dog in the car on such a hot day)  People stopped by, greeted my dog,  we had some conversations.  It was so friendly and refreshing.   It was Outside on a street-side patio, he was no where near a kitchen.  He did not cause any issues.     If the restaurant wants to allow it,  or even PANDER to us dog loving scum, why can't they?

vancouver,3d9dz2,majeric,3,Tue Jul 14 16:04:28 2015 UTC,Just forcing that reply in there. Good job pandering to the masses.
vancouver,3d9dz2,ninetynyne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"The fact that rental housing is not dog friendly isn't relevant to the conversation? I mean if you're going to talk about how pet friendly this city is, one might imagine that being able to live with your pets plays a role..."
vancouver,3d9dz2,majeric,2,Tue Jul 14 16:30:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see what you mean.  The way you worded your reply was ambiguous - I thought what you meant was that the city didn't have affordable rental housing.  My bad.  As for rental housing being pet friendly - that's a whole property owners thing.  Most property owners don't want to devalue their property and/or have to pay for unnecessary repairs.  To give you an example, in the past, my parents rented out a house.  The renters had two dogs.  We came back to see our whole backyard had been destroyed and dog piss soaked into the carpets.  They've had a no-dog policy since.  So you have to see it from another perspective."
vancouver,3d9dz2,ninetynyne,3,Tue Jul 14 16:42:32 2015 UTC,"Anecdotes are not evidence though. You'd also have to demonstrate that your parents' experience was typical of pet owner behaviour. They may have just had shitty tenants.  The tenants might have equally been shitty without pets and could have ruined the house in other ways.  Pets have a positive demonstrable effect on the quantity and quality of our lives.  I'm not suggesting that Tenants shouldn't be charged an extra pet deposit...and I'm also suggesting that insurance for the potential damage that a shitty tenant should be factored into the rental price of the property in the rare cases that a pet destroys a home.   So, while I do see your perspective,  I'd recommend that you ""keep perspective"" rather than letting unusual biases impact your perception of pet owners."
vancouver,3d9dz2,majeric,2,Tue Jul 14 17:07:13 2015 UTC,"I don't care either way - it's not my property nor do I own pets.  I do not have a bias - I'm simply relaying why property owners see pets as possible risks towards investment.  Pets serve to only enhance the quality of lives of people who own them; to property owners, it's irrelevant whether or not it enhances their tenants' lives.  It's a life choice like any other - you can choose to have a pet or not.  It is not a requirement to have a pet unless it's seeing eye dog or otherwise.  To them, the only thing that matters is risk - do I rent out to somebody who has a pet or not? A pet is always more risky.  A person's risk is taken into account upon interviewing, but you can't interview a pet.  So it's not that many property owners have anything against people owning pets - it's simply a decision of financial risk.  Am I comfortable with risking my investment due to a pet? Do I gain anything from risking my investment with somebody with a pet?  Pet insurance and a deposit are one thing - but the time it takes to fix the property afterwards is time lost in turnover.  Again, a lost financial opportunity.  My point is - property owners have no good reason to allow pets onto their property.  There is no financial incentive.  If pet owners were to pay more on their rental properties, then maybe then it'd be okay.  But them people would decry that it was discrimination towards pet owners.  Just my two cents."
vancouver,3d9dz2,ninetynyne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:33:34 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a Jackson Polluck of anti-pet arguments.    I do not have a bias   The bias I am describing is assuming that the example you use is typical of pet ownership. Which may or may not be the case. So yes, you are biased because you hold up an example as typical.   Pet insurance and a deposit are one thing - but the time it takes to fix the property afterwards is time lost in turnover. Again, a lost financial opportunity.   This is just bad management on the part of the owner if they don't accommodate risk in their rental plan. Every argument you're making is just further splitting hairs.   Just my two cents.   Yes, you've re-itterated all the typical ignorant justifications for discriminating against pet owners."
vancouver,3d9dz2,majeric,2,Tue Jul 14 17:59:26 2015 UTC,"I was trying to be civil, but obviously you are so knee-deep in your bias that you have no idea what you're even talking about.  I have been nothing but courteous but you're taking on personal attacks.  How gracious of you.  And you're still not answering my question: why should home owners risk their properties for pet owners?  Also this:   This is just bad management on the part of the owner if they don't accommodate risk in their rental plan. Every argument you're making is just further splitting hairs.   Why do they need to plan for this financial loss when they could just, I don't know, get somebody without a pet?"

The new flooring could have been done for half of that if it wasn't for removal labour, dump fees, trim matching etc.  We did the paint ourselves, but still had to pay for it.

As someone who enjoys sitting on the patio the absolute last thing I want is to have to deal with other peoples poorly trained dogs.  As a dog owner, I would absolutely LOVE this.  While I do think that simply bringing your dog to a restaurant for the sake of it is kind of stupid there are times when I'll go for a hike with my dog, or take him somewhere that's not all that close to home. Some times I'd like to be able to stop on the way home to have some food. Sure, I could pack stuff in a cooler or stop for some fast food, but being able to sit on a patio and eat some decent food and have a beer is better.   A patio full of dogs would be stupid and chaotic, but if places wanted to open a couple designated tables off in a corner I really don't see much harm. Especially if they're quick to eject anyone with unruly pets - and lets be honest, in most cases it'll be pretty easy for staff to figure out who's going to be a problem even before the first drink is served."

vancouver,3d9dz2,ninetynyne,0,Tue Jul 14 16:40:07 2015 UTC,So we should not allow anything near restaurants that people might be allergic to?
vancouver,3d9dz2,elchivo83,0,Tue Jul 14 16:43:24 2015 UTC,"If it's within our control, sure.  Stuff like peanut allergies and whatnot - those are highly unavoidable due to food processing in general.  But something like a dog allergy - which is totally optional and totally not involved in food processing - should be avoided where possible.  Same idea as people asking other people not to wear perfumes in the work place."

So what if Europe does it? That's Europe not Vancouver. Also this is Vancouver not all of Canada, and people in Vancouver tend to blow up things into a bigger deal than it is. Even when it has no effect on them.   I'm totally with the person who said to make it optional. I agree that it's silly to not allow dogs or what have you on patios, but there must be reasons we don't allow it, and Europe isn't one of those."

However, if you're looking for a rebuttal, your argument isn't the same. No pants at a restaurant? That might be a little less politically acceptable than a pet. Do I care if there is a pet at a patio? That depends on the situation. Like someone said earlier, it's not the pet's or dogs that are bothersome, it's their shitty owners and their inability to properly train and teach their pets obedience. That is a really good point and where everyone should be looking for an argument.

Although there was a nearby parking lot for a hiking trail, we were never bothered and frankly never even saw anyone near our campground save for the cars of the hikers. To be honest we never checked that hiking trail out, so I can't comment on that. It's easily accessible by a Golf.  The nearest campground is Gold Creek which is ~5 mins drive away, so at night you're completely alone with a great view of the stars. There's sinks, showers, and flush toilets at Gold Creek which is great. Many times my group just simply walked there, it's a shorter distance by foot, but still takes ~15 mins to get there.  Keep in mind that the group campground costs a lot more than your usual one. If money isn't too big of an issue, then don't worry about claiming that 15 people are going to be there when you'll only be bringing a few. I only had 8 people with me, and only one person has to do the check-in.  Hope you find the right campground :) Cheers!"

vancouver,3d20zu,tdangerk,-14,Mon Jul 13 04:21:43 2015 UTC,No.  More than likely it is reserved for a specific person.  The point is that this isn't a public parking lot like a Safeway or a Park.  This looks like a private employee-only lot.  A manager probably pulled up on a Sunday knowing that no one was around and just parked in a random location to quickly go in and grab something - knowing very well that the parking spot would not be occupied because the one and only person it is reserved for is away that day.

This is not a spot in a public parking lot that is available to any disabled person.  This is a reserved spot for one very specific disabled person.  No one else is allowed to park there.  This is also in a private parking lot.  The car owner likely had knowledge that the one and only person who is allwoed to use this spot was not going to be in on that day.   When we try to use the internet to bring attention to an issue - and it turns out to be false - we only serve to reduce the power of the method.  Later this week when there is a real offender, people won;'t take it seriously.  don't cry wolf.   Also - we don't yet have any evidnce that the person in the spot was not the person who the spot was designated for.  disabled people can drive sports cars, right?  or do you think disabled people only drive minivans?"

Context is important.  We each make 25-30k/yr, and are looking for long term housing, we are not close to 30 and will be renting for another 7-8 yrs. We are clean, well-dressed, and well-spoken; the places we look at seem very lovely online but in person, the landlord asks for a whole lot of bullshit because they don't know better or they know they can (for example, an application fee for a place that they know many couples really want and will pay anyways). It's just annoying to say no thank you and walk away knowing they will probably fool some other applicant or someone more desperate will eat the illegal costs knowingly. :-/"

I was just under the impression you're only allowed to be choosy about gender if you share kitchen/bathroom with the tenant - although I guess seeing applicants in person is equivalent to being sent photos. Just struck me as creepy, lol  While I know it's legit to see photo ID, is it legal to decline an applicant if they were, for example, 3 boys instead of 3 girls? The landlord can always decide they didn't like the personalities/presentation, so I guess that'd be hard to prove anyways. I've never seen a listing asking for photos before (not photo ID, just an emailed attachment, ""FB photo is fine"").

Is that not what section 20 of the tenancy act means?   http://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/rtb/bc_laws/RTA.html#section20  The ""Tenancy Survival Guide"" mentions application deposits more specifically (as the RTA has ambiguous wording to me), I understand it as not being allowed to ask for any form of money until an agreement is being signed  http://wiki.clicklaw.bc.ca/index.php/Making_Your_Tenancy_Agreement#Deposits_and_paying_rent"

When humans see cougars something's wrong.  Either you have surprized or interrupted it in the middle of whatever it was doing.  Like stalking prey.  Cougars have no problem grabbing livestock, pets, and for the truly desperate ones attacking humans.  When they show up around farms, backyards and humans?  It can be dangerous.  Some of them just need to be destroyed.    Black bears?  No short supply of them, and they really can be pests.  Grizzly bears?  The population is not in decline and often they come in to conflict with humans as well.  While not as pesky as a black bear, a grizzly around humans is not a good thing."
vancouver,3d5e87,AdiposeFin,-2,Mon Jul 13 17:49:39 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article at all? Conservation officers here in BC killed a cougar about once every four days over four years. During the same time they shot 72 grizzly bears and 1,872 black bears.  It sounds less like ""conservation"" and more like the officers were using their position to conduct their own personal hunts."
vancouver,3d5e87,sign_in_or_sign_up,4,Mon Jul 13 18:22:55 2015 UTC,Conservation officers are nature lovers.  You don't ascend to the role because you are foremost a hunter.  Putting an animal down is a conservation officer's worst possible day at work.  You should listen to one interviewed.
vancouver,3d5e87,majormoron,6,Mon Jul 13 22:02:12 2015 UTC,"It is possible to kill an animal to conserve a species.  There was a lottery for an endangered Rhino hunt a few years ago and there was a MAJOR uproar... because people don't understand. The animal had to be killed because he was dominant and wouldn't let the other smaller rhinos breed. It is possible to kill, even an endangered animal, in an effort to protect a species.  There is another case example, St. Matthew's Island. Reindeer were introduced, then the island was abandoned. The reindeer thrived, doubling, tripling, 10x, 100x... then extinct on the island because they ate all the food. If someone was there to control the population, there would still be a thriving population there.  tl;dr Killing animals isn't always ""OMG, monsters! Bad!"" Even though for the uneducated public, it always will be."

If the problem is really overpopulation, then the province could make money from hunters paying to take care of of the problem for us all, instead of paying conservation officers needlessly to do it.   1.) Conservation officers don't just kill animals, they also:   inspect the carcasses of hunted animals for compliance with the regulations (proof of sex, antler size, etc).  enforce anti-poaching regulations advise residents on living with wildlife relocate animals   and probably more, but that's what I know of.  2.) Conservation officers kill problem animals on demand. You cannot necessarily call up a recreational cougar hunter to Maple Ridge on a Tuesday morning to deal with a starving cougar that's been stalking children. The guy probably has a full time job and may live hours away.  3.) Conservation officers use a variety of tools to remove problem animals from residential areas, which hunters are not necessarily trained/equipped to do. It's not like in the forest where you just release the hounds and shoot when you have a good target. There are houses, cars, people, pets, private property etc. to consider when shooting and pursuing. Sometimes animals are trapped or tranquilized, which hunters don't know about because bears and cougars are not trappable in BC.  Being a conservation officer is a job, I don't think you'll find many hunters that want to pay to do it. Shooting a black bear out in the forest is different then traipsing around a neighborhood and then shooting a starving yearling or a sow with cubs in front of firefighters, First Nations, concerned residents etc."

vancouver,3d12f3,ArrachtasOfEire,2,Wed Jul 15 04:40:23 2015 UTC,"There is a handful of reasons, of which writing about would be somewhat of a pain. In short though, the disparity of wealth issue here is the worst I've ever seen. Drug and homeless issues are way more of a problem here than in cities several magnitudes larger. The so called ""mountain tax"" on everything is laughable, and while outside of Vancouver is beautiful, it serves no real purpose in the city itself. Friendly people are few and far between here, I've noticed. People are so insanely closed off and clique mentalitied that seems like nobody ever left the high school period of life. There is an inferiority complex. Vancouverites love to trash talk places they have never been, and nowhere is better than Vancouver. Their ignorance is bliss. The work sector here is lame. You want to make 30% less in wages for your field, and pay 50% more to live? Vancouver is for you, my friend. There is nothing much that the city offers, the nightlife is an abomination, and the good bars that don't cater tourists, and yuppies are few and far inbetween (this could just be because i havent found any yet). I could go on an on about the little annoyances. Regardless, i'm here for a year at least so who knows what my impression will be as I get more acquainted. As it stands now though, this place is very meh in comparison to other places I've lived and been to."
vancouver,3d12f3,mclellac,2,Wed Jul 15 05:12:15 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree; I'm a Vancouverite (for the most part), though I've lived in other places, including Europe (my parents are Irish and I'm a citizen), and I've lived in Calgary (where I'm moving back to).   Much of what you covered I do tend to hear from people - sometimes from those who have grown up here (and are in their late-20's to late-30's), but largely from those who move here from elsewhere within Canada or the USA.  To your points, from a relatively unbiased point of view (since I've lived elsewhere and traveled extensively), I can only offer my perspective - that of someone who has lived in Vancouver for about two decades combined. It's opinion, but it's largely grounded in fact, or at the least, popular opinion (that doesn't mean it's EVERYONE's!):   Drugs and homelessness are indeed quite bad, but mostly concentrated; Gas Town and parts of East Van are indeed among the worst in North America for poverty and drugs. The rest of Vancouver-proper is pretty respectable. Similarly, some suburbs of Vancouver are both good and bad; there's areas of Surrey that are about as bad as it gets, yet others that are OK. What you call the 'mountain tax' I've heard others call the 'sunshine tax', or as one person once told me, 'BC' stands for 'Bring Cash'. The funny thing is that, as much as many Vancouverites rave about the scenery (and it is indeed amazing), few people actually seem to go and actively partake of it; sure, beaches are crowded on a summer's eve, but there's still tonnes of other people who never ever visit them, because they have to live so far away from them, or can't afford the time to visit. People would be surprised, perhaps, to hear how infrequently the average Vancouverite hits the beach, or goes skiing (or can afford to!). There's other pretty cities that have mountains/cities/water that don't cost what Vancouver does. You'll heard proud (smug?) Vancouverites bragging about skiing, sailing, hiking, and fine dining all in one day - but the only ones that can afford all that in one day are very, very (very!) wealthy people. Not exactly the norm; many can't even afford one of those. Not-Friendly/cliquey/inferiority. I'd sum this up as 'attitude'. Overall - and speaking only generally - I say that's fair. The average Vancouverite might not notice it, but I'd be compelled to ask how often they truly travel to other places, or if they've ever lived somewhere else (and how many places/residences), especially within Canada. Vancouver does indeed have a lot of image-obsessed very 'us and them' types of people; status here (or the appearance thereof) matters, and leads to that inferiority complex. Try to tell Vancouverites that Banff and Lake Louise (Calgary's local ski hangout) is on par with Vancouver's offering, and people here will riot in protest. Mention that Toronto or Montreal has a better culture/arts scene, and the same will happen. I do think it is indeed ignorance; people buy in too much to what they read on our license plates ('best place on earth'), which is conceited at the least. We also tout multiculturalism, and while that does happen, there are a lot of ethnic enclaves where there is very little mixing, and anyone not from the dominant culture of the area is a rare sight.  Work is indeed lame. My field pays well over $10,000 more per year just to start in several other provinces (nice ones). The average BC citizen (not just Vancouverite) experiences depressed wages, and poor job markets. This is the infamous 'sunshine tax' - the idea that one should be willing to earn less for the 'privilege' of living here. The old 'don't like it, then move' is often thrown around, as if actively encouraging educated and hard working people to get lost is somehow a virtuous and good thing to do.   I'd have to say that your first impression seems fairly accurate - from a certain point of view. Others may disagree, but I've lived in Vancouver for most of my life, and I can see where you're coming from. I think a lot of residents from here lack perspective; they've either never lived anywhere else, or they lived somewhere so rough (i.e. they're immigrants from a poor country or one with a lot of social ills) that anything that isn't 'where they came from' is viewed an improvement."

vancouver,3d12f3,burtaexpat,3,Sun Jul 12 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Some people in this thread seem to think I've thrown out the ""well you're being racist card."" That wasn't really the intention. It seems that all sides of the housing cost debate have taken up blaming the Chinese for their own purposes.   Although honestly, I would love to see strict government restrictions on property purchasing, complete with an investigative unit with teeth,  put in place just as an experiment to see if Chinese money really was the primary driver of the high property prices. I bet it would marginally affect the high end of single family detached in places like Point Grey and the nicer parts of West Van, but have little to no effect on condos as well."
vancouver,3d12f3,burtaexpat,13,Sun Jul 12 20:02:32 2015 UTC,The pattern is that people are too busy blaming the Yellow Menace instead of getting their government to do something about it.
vancouver,3d12f3,ninetynyne,13,Mon Jul 13 19:59:11 2015 UTC,I think people have been legitimately trying pretty hard to get the government to do something. Maybe it's time for a recall campaign..

vancouver,3d12f3,proudbedwetter,3,Sun Jul 12 23:25:28 2015 UTC,Indeed. I'm not sure most dual-professional income families with kids can buy property of a reasonable size to accommodate them (and I'm not talking single family detached here) for payments that are less than the %35 of income that most financial advisors consider prudent anywhere within a 45 minute commute of the core of Vancouver.
vancouver,3d12f3,burtaexpat,-3,Sun Jul 12 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"yes, people who were smart enough to not listen to the fear mongering sales pitch are truly the fortunate ones.  their reward is 1 1/2 hour commute, both parents working and living in a townhouse in the burbs.  like i said, buying isn't really an option anymore... better to rent or move away than have the above in my opinion."
vancouver,3d12f3,proudbedwetter,6,Sun Jul 12 21:42:10 2015 UTC,Count me as one of them. By this time next year I'll be at my new job in a place that isn't Vancouver.   I'd like to stay in Vancouver. Over the past few years I've made some very good friend here. But I just can't afford the city and the job opportunities for people with my training are too few and generally far underpaid for the relative cost of living.

vancouver,3d12f3,proudbedwetter,2,Sun Jul 12 22:20:42 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, some people really are concerned about how potentially ill-gotten money from the benefactors of single party state with a really shitty human rights record are changing the city. For others, it's about ethnicity and general cultural dislike.  The problem is that no one in our government or civil service has the balls or has been enable to flat out ask where the money is coming from and seriously investigate potential corruption."

vancouver,3d2lno,wildstarsuperstar,46,Mon Jul 13 00:49:50 2015 UTC,This is called a preload. The weight of the sand compresses the soil beneath to provide solid ground for construction that will experience less settling.
vancouver,3d2lno,shazoocow,10,Mon Jul 13 00:57:03 2015 UTC,"To be more technical, the preload is consolidating the soil, not compressing it.  Compressing means to force air out of the soil, consolidating means to force water out.  It takes a long time to force water out of a fine-grained soil (like silt or clay) so that's why those preloads have to sit for 6-8 months (or more depending on the site)"
vancouver,3d2lno,Red_AtNight,2,Mon Jul 13 15:15:22 2015 UTC,The townhouse site neXT to Kwantlin university was preloaded in 1991. they didn't start construction until aprox 2003.
vancouver,3d2lno,pagit,3,Mon Jul 13 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"There may have been other reasons for that, like permit delays, or owner couldn't afford to built yet, etc.  Generally speaking, most pre-loading consolidation takes place within the first few months, but in some cases even up to 1-2 years is required (or more preload, depending on what's more economical). However, 12 years seems excessive. You probably wouldn't get much more consolidation than you would've had after say... 3 years."
vancouver,3d2lno,touchable,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:02:27 2015 UTC,This is correct. The soil in Richmond is awful for building (notice no sky scrapers). Alternatively the soil can be densified by vibrating in columns of gravel or driving steel/timber piles (that hammer notice you often hear near construction sites)

vancouver,3d2lno,aieaieandgoodbye,2,Mon Jul 13 17:03:22 2015 UTC,"Its used to compress the water out, but its not a great way to build since if we ever have an earthquake the soil would liquify. The reason is because Richmond is under sea level so you got to get all that water out. I am sure there is detials I am missing."
vancouver,3d2lno,Zanarkand_Behemoth,4,Mon Jul 13 01:00:54 2015 UTC,Look at Richmond on a map we are surrounded by water there is a dyke that surrounds us to prevent the water from overflowing. There are pumps stations all around Richmond making sure we don't flood as well.
vancouver,3d2lno,Zanarkand_Behemoth,10,Mon Jul 13 01:05:14 2015 UTC,"Richmond isn't below sea level, it's just above sea level (average elevation is one metre). But there are dykes surrounding it in case the Fraser floods or there's an extremely high tide."

Go to any grocery, department or Pet Store and it is mostly things for the common dog. Us feline owners do not get fancy parks either.  How about some of them with climbing 'toys' etc?  Cats are smarter, more loveable and feline owners are more 'hip' 'cosmopolitan' and 'sophisticated' than those that own the common dog...."
vancouver,3cze3t,thfc66,2,Sun Jul 12 05:19:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe because cats don't play with toys on the Same level as dogs. And there are no 'fancy cat park's ' because people don't leash their cats and go for a walk.  And I would have to say that dogs are smarter. I never heard of too many cats that save lives, help disabled people get around, sniff out lost/buried bodies, help find bombs, drugs, or currency etc etc."

I went to Uni for a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and College for Graphic Design and Digital Art in Northern Ontario.  I work mostly weddings and portraits, and dabble a bit in fashion and commercial, which I would like to further pursue. I just moved to Vancouver from a few years in the Caribbean, where I also shot weddings, and still get to travel a fair bit, which I love!  It's really nice working for yourself, and I get to shoot happy couples on one of the happiest days of their lives. Everyone is in an positive mood and varying degrees of happy drunk. I get to really spread my creative wings and try new techniques every weekend, and I am constantly learning new stuff. Its important to keep it fresh, or else it gets boring!  One of the downsides is that most weekends are booked up with work and no one understands how much work goes into editing wedding photos. Everyone thinks I have the week off and only have to work Saturdays! Ha! In high season, summer, i'm working 60 hours a week editing, and low season, winter, 40.

Went to uni (SFU) after a couple year break after HS and graduated with a degree in Archaeology.

Husband and I created a property management and renovation company.   Pro: we work for ourselves, financially it is great, gives us freedom, don't have to work in an office, commute, have other manage us, the harder we work the more money we make, etc...  Con: while we get a lot of day to day freedom, long-term freedom (ie: vacations) can be harder to take, it is a lot more stressful than punching in and punching out daily, weekends do not really exist, it can be a lot riskier financially (especially at the beginning), working with your spouse can add another level of stress onto a relationship.

vancouver,3d0eq6,Gaglardi,6,Sun Jul 12 23:06:10 2015 UTC,"Consultant for a software company doing implementations of our software. I'm an accountant by trade but I've been able to spin my career into something not accounting. I wanted to be a pilot when I was a kid. I actually still love airplanes and I'm doing my private pilots license but growing up Asian you find a career that pays the bills and is practical so became an accountant.  To be honest, I went into accounting because I was good at it but after being told that my vacations were limited to times that aren't month end (i.e. 2 weeks a month) I realized that this was a far more restricting career than I had originally envisioned. So began my path to become an accountant so I could stop being an accountant. I went through different financial analyst roles, worked at an international bank doing strategy, went into treasury, and then I ended up here after getting a call from a recruiter because of my banking experience.   I travel a lot for work these days. It sounds sexy but it's pretty tiring. Realizing that you need to unpack on Friday night only to repack everything again Sunday night is pretty tiring after a while. I spend at least a full working day every week either at an airport, on an airplane or in a taxi. I encourage everyone to try a travelling job at least once in their career to see what it's like. It's definitely not for me.  The pros of the job are the flexibility. Yes, I may be travelling on Tuesday or Wednesday but I work from home on the Monday and/or Tuesday. My hours revolve around billing out 40 hours a week so if I travel on a Sunday I take the previous Friday off. Having said that I COULD bill more than 40 hours a week but quite honestly, I'm at a point where I don't really care anymore.  When you're a billable ""resource"" you realize that nobody cares about you. You're literally a dollar figure for your higher ups to bill you out. You don't go home for 6 weeks straight... not their problem. Your client is shit and you're just sitting in another city surfing Reddit? Are you billable? Yes? OK not a problem. It's the same in accounting firms too, despite winning ""top employer"" awards because of the benefits but you soon realize you don't get to make use of the benefits because you're too busy booking billable hours.  I'm pretty sure at this point you've figured out I'm not exactly loving my job. But I will say that I honestly don't know what else I can do. I'm pretty much a victim of golden handcuffs. This is a job where I finally realize that white collar work isn't all it's cut out to be. I've come to the realization that my job is pretty much just me going to the office, answering the same emails I've been answering for the past 6 months and doing the same thing over and over again every day. It's not fulfilling work but hey, it pays the bills!"

vancouver,3d0eq6,Superdont,7,Mon Jul 13 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"High school teacher. I have a degree in History (mostly 20th century world affairs) with an extended minor in Clinical Psychology. I have a teaching degree (two year program from an old European university), and am completing a graduate degree in Special Education. I wanted to be a pilot (as in for planes), but never had the math/science marks to get into a decent school for it; I'll get my private license one day. I definitely always wanted to have a job that helped the community, though - I think it's important to have a job that really contributes to building society.   Teaching is a job that requires a lot of hours and a lot of stress-coping, but it's one of the few jobs where you can truly say you make a major difference in the community, and can leave a lasting impact on future generations. The students I've had, the colleagues I've worked with, and the administrators and districts that I have worked for - they've all been great. The commute has been less great, as the school district I've worked for is a long way from where I live - such is the downside of it being a tough job market for educators. Overall, it's a rewarding, if extremely challenging job.  ...politically, though (hello, BC Liberals)... well, that's the problem, and the reason I'm leaving BC. The pay for teachers in BC (particularly compared to the national average and cost of living here) is atrocious, the job prospects for newer/younger teachers (like myself) nearly non-existent, and the treatment we (and education in general) receive from government is appalling. I've worked most of my relatively short career 'on call' (i.e. as a substitute) due to the fact that there are no jobs, and the government keeps cutting the education funding that is needed to hire teachers. The strike is over, and I'm leaving BC, so I have no real personal stake any longer in stating the bald truth - I can state without bias (since it no longer will affect me) that, yes, classrooms really are as under-funded and over-full as teachers state, barring a TINY handful in certain areas of Vancouver. It is only going to get worse under this government, which would rather direct funds toward private schools.  I do feel a good deal of self-pity (mostly for my empty wallet), but I feel just as badly when I see under-supported students dealing with archaic resources, or special needs students who have zero support. This is a problem unique to BC, within Canada; other provinces have it much better than BC students (or teachers) do.   The Liberals have single-handedly severely damaged my enjoyment of the profession. 47% of new teachers burn out and quit the job within five years, due to the stress of it; if I stay here in BC, I know I'd be part of that statistic. Time for a fresh start, and I encourage other new/young professionals (not just teachers) to consider leaving the GVRD as well. I'm heading to another province, and I doubt I'll come back.  TLDR: The job is one of the most rewarding out there, and harder than most imagine. It's a rotten job in BC, though. If my post sounded like a rant, it kinda was, but if there's any aspiring teachers in this thread, I wanted them to heed my warning."

As for the job itself, I know one teacher at an elementary school and I have to say that my respect for what you do has changed dramatically since talking to her. Teaching now is not like what teachers used to be when I was going through the school system. I'm actually kind of sad to see what the downstream ripple effects will be when you have this generation of kids coming out and basically never having to deal with the consequences of their own actions. I'm also sad to see how much they've watered down what teachers can and can't do.

Art Center has one programme that specialises on the more entertainment side of things.  What are some standard industry software she needs to learn?

Digital arts is what the entire industry uses.  Traditional art studies is a good base, but she has to be savy and focus on a technical background of software packages and drawing with a Wacom tablet.  Buy her a Wacom tablet and have her familiarize herself with photoshop, that is always the first step towards learning digital art tools.  From there she can focus her studies with a specific school.  Gnomon is one of the larger schools in the industry, while not cheap they will train her for the job market. But I also want to add, I oversee recruiting and we don't really care about what school they have studied, the portfolio and reel they accumulate is what matters.  So the time she puts into her own personal projects will help her land her first jobs the first few years out of school, after that it is all experience.  Good luck!

The former isn't what I always wanted to do, but it's actually a much better job than I expected it. Affords me my own apartment right in the center of downtown, no roommates. Money is tight, sure, but for me it's worth it.   The latter is kinda what I always wanted to do. I've been involved in acting/performance all my life, and doing commercials/characters/whatevers is a ton of fun and pays really well. Voice acting has a huge technical aspect to it as well, so being good with computers has made it easier for me. You get the job just like you get any acting job. Constantly audition, constantly don't book anything, keep doing it anyway and eventually start to book clients. Provide them with great work, and they give you repeat business. No commute at all, I do it all from a home studio.   The downside to the work is that it's very irregular, just like any acting job. I might book a ton of clients one month and book nobody for 2 months. The goal, though, is to eventually have steady enough bookings that I don't need the day-job anymore. That won't be any time soon, but however long it takes it's a goal I intend to hit."

Tourists are crazy in the summer but their presences really dies down after it's over. Most places still get steady business but the streets are usually pretty empty.  Tourists haven't changed things THAT much. While living there, I never really got the impression that tourists ""owned"" our neighborhood. The docks are obviously marketed towards tourists and not residents but they've been that way as far back as I can remember. I think most of the changes in the neighborhood have actually been as a result of the growing number of residents, rather than the growing number of tourists (although both things are obviously linked).  Admittedly, I do miss the old industrial buildings by the water and the dingy feeling it used to have in the 90s. However, the neighborhood still has a local grocery store, small coffee shops, cool community events, and some great neighborhood restaurants. Most of the employees in businesses are kids from the neighborhood so the increased business from population growth/tourism has definitely benefited the community. Also, there is still a small town vibe in the sense that I can't walk through the area without seeing somebody that I know.  If I didn't have the option to live in Vancouver proper and owned a vehicle, I would definitely pick Steveston over most of Metro Vancouver."

The cannery is gone (the real one, I mean), and all that's left of the canning industry is the original cannery building, which is now a museum.  Despite the Disney-fication, it's still a functioning town. We shop at the local grocery store, and we eat/drink at The Buck, Dave's, or Steveston Pizza.  Things I miss: I miss the ""sand dunes""— the industrial sand piles at Garry Point before it became a park; the fishy reek of the cannery when the wind blew from the south; the seedy storefronts like the Buccaneer peeler bar or Koby's ""billiards"".  It's been sanitized, artificialized. But it's still a unique place with unique history unlike the rest of Richmond.   Even so, I like the influx of good restaurants.

vancouver,3d2tmb,BohemianPunk,12,Mon Jul 13 02:04:23 2015 UTC,"Well, you seem to have the budget right and I would suggest looking for a nice place in Burnaby or New Westminster close to the skytrain.  What you should do:   Make a list of ""wants"". Looking at apt after apt can get VERY overwhelming and at some point, they will all look the same. For example: carpet or wood? balcony? first floor...second..top floor? pets? dishwasher? laundry? underground parking? close to groceries? close to your gym or a park? You won't ever get EVERYTHING on your list...but if carpet is a no-go, don't look at apts that have carpet. Ask questions to the manager. What is included, how much is laundry, what are the other tenants like, how do I pay rent, what upgrades does the building have, can I control my own heat, is there smoking, are there pets, have you had issues with bedbugs, what is your noise policy, if something breaks...what do you do or who do you call, etc...I encourage people to ask as many questions as possible. If you are signing up for a 1 year lease, it is a commitment you need to be happy with. Present yourself well. Dress like you care, don't smoke before you walk in, don't be late (if you are going to be late, just call), don't no-show, be honest. Be prepared to fill out an application BUT only do so if you want to place. Don't feel bad if it is not for you...not everyone likes what I offer and that is okay. Don't fill out the application just to be nice. Have your SIN, ID, previous landlords contact info if you have one, contact info about your job as some landlords will confirm employment, etc. Don't hand over cash for a deposit if you have not signed a tenancy agreement. Always get a receipt.    When not to take an apartment:    Smells like smoke.  The manager/landlord is creepy or appears not to care. Or, one that acts ""shifty"" when you ask questions. There are several abandoned cars in the parking lot. Most, if not all, balconies at the building are FULL of shit (furniture, garage, etc). Landlord demands a deposit (in cash) before papers are signed. An apartment that includes cable. Anything that is priced below market value (check comps on CL). When you are being pressured to take it.   With a budget of $850/month you will find a reasonably renovated 1 bedroom in New West or Burnaby or possible a small renovated studio in a newer buildings in NW/Burn. I wouldn't recommend a basement suite."

vancouver,3d2tmb,ParkingPaky,6,Mon Jul 13 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"GENERALLY,   Years ago apartment buildings would include cable as an insensitive for tenants. Now, buildings that include or provide cable tend to attract those people who will not qualify for an account with either shaw or telus...meaning, their credit and/or previous accounts with cable providers must be in good standing....think ""less than desirable tenants"".

vancouver,3d2tmb,GregEh,2,Mon Jul 13 04:21:32 2015 UTC,"Main factors to weigh:  -location (length of commute, neighbourhood, distance from transit and other amenities, etc.)  -size, layout of the place  -price  -other preferences you have  Figure out which of the above you prioritize the most, and which ones you're most willing to compromise.  Do you strongly wish to live in a vibrant neighbourhood, or close to downtown, and are willing to have a smaller place / higher rent in order to make that happen?  Or are you not too picky about where you live, if it means you can have more space and cheaper rent?  Those are questions to consider, so that you'll have a better sense of what to look for."
vancouver,3d2tmb,PopeSaintHilarius,2,Mon Jul 13 07:13:12 2015 UTC,"Lots of good stuff here already. Some additional and more specific considerations for a first-timer:   Is there a grocery store nearby? Other neighbourhood amenities are nice and all, but there's no escaping the need to regularly restock your fridge. Especially important if you don't have your own car, hauling loads of groceries on the bus gets old real fast.  Is noise an issue for you? Is there a major road or weird intersection nearby that results in frequent car horns? Police/fire/ambulance stations sending out sirens at all hours? Train tracks, flight paths? Bars or pubs letting out drunk crowds at closing? Rentals in Vancouver tend to get snatched up very quickly. While you should definitely heed all the advice here about not signing sight-unseen or if anything looks fishy, do be prepared to sign asap if you like what you see and everything looks legit. Waiting an extra day can easily cost you. Also related to the short listing periods: many owners/managers don't even bother to post online, instead they just put a sign out front (especially true of apartments, not so much basements suits). Spend some time pounding the pavement in the areas you're considering. Once you've found a place you like, examine it super closely and leave no stone unturned. Check the water pressure in the shower and taps. Test every electrical socket. Test the appliances. Pay extra attention to the areas around the windows. Open/close anything that's designed to do so.

vancouver,3d2tmb,Jimmy_Sax,2,Mon Jul 13 08:14:22 2015 UTC,"$850 for a one-bedroom is a classic Marpole three-story walkup price range. There are three buildings on Shaughnessy Street (one over from Oak) between 70th and 71st that used to be (and hopefully still are) managed by a lovely Italian couple and almost always have a vacancy advertised out front. They use an application process and they are quite legit. One building is called Shaughnessy Apartments, iirc, and the other two look just like it.   Three-story walkups tend to be a bit noisier than larger concrete buildings, but they are generally more affordable (a one-bedroom over at the Langara tower was $1400 the last time I looked, which was about a decade ago) and they offer some autonomy that a roommate-in-a-house situation can't offer. Marpole is a classic neighbourhood for 20-somethings moving into the city. Cambie village is another area that has quite a few three-story walkups."

The US looks at contingencies which result in moving ahead with TPP without Canada.  Two ways to look at this: Canada being overly protective of its agricultural monopoly over Canadian consumers, or the US is being aggressive with veiled threats and bullying Canada into signing an unfair deal.

But whistler is a beutiful place to go with or without snow. The ski hills might not have enough snow but higher up the mountain there is enough for you to still snowshoe and snowmobile..... the best thing about whistler is you dont need a car at all, the village is designed to  be walked around and all the major attractions have a shuttle bus service up the mountain to their spot.  When I go up I park my car in the underground parking at the hotel when I check in , and i dont come back to my car untill I leave whistler.  If i were you , I'd arrive in whistler early day time.  Site see, find activities your interested in (they have ads and deals posted at all hotels),  check in to hotel, have lunch, go snowmobiling,  walk around the village, change at hotel, have dinner ,  walk around the village nice lounges and bars everywhere, sleep,  have breakfast , squeeze in one more activity, before or after lunch,  leave whistler around 4pm...... if you really want to see snow research Banff or jasper alberta.  It a 7 hour drive but they are both winter wonderlands aswell...... ive been to Brazil. Its a beutiful country.  Ill never forget my first glimpse of the beach and ocean.

Grouse Mountain typically opens for skiing at the end of November but of course, it depends on climate variability. Even if it is not open for skiing yet, you can still take the tram up to the restaurant and run around in the snow, if it is there. You can get to grouse mountain by bus or rental car.

However, most of the development is occurring around major transit hubs (e.g. Canada Line/Skytrain stations), so the impact shouldn't be as big as some would think in the long run. As well, with projects like the Oakridge redevelopment, you'll start to have quasi-self sufficient communities where basically anything you'd want to get or do would be in those big developments. So, there'd ideally be less traffic out of those areas.   On the flip side, there may be slightly more traffic into the region, so we'll have to see how the balancing act holds out.

Not true they need to be $4 Billion 10 lane PPP toll bridge behemoths.  Overbuilt vehicle infrastructure under-prices distance traveled and encourages wasteful auto use via feedback loops that make far more traffic in the end.  No reason why the Massey tunnel can't be upgraded for $2 Billion and another $2Billion put into the Broadway Subway.  It's only political will that's the difference."
vancouver,3cxnm5,vancouver_boy,16,Sat Jul 11 20:56:40 2015 UTC,You obviously haven't driven through the massey tunnel during rush hour traffic. On a typical friday afternoon the southbound traffic is usually backed up all the way past oak street bridge.  Patullo bridge replacement was a part of the transit plebiscite too and that would definately benefit the auto dealers so get out of here with your crackpot conspiracy theories

An upgrade to the Massey Tunnel by the way is WAY worse then building a replacement now or just delaying it's replacement as somebody that lives out here, the Massey Tunnel is so woefully inadequate and seismically unsafe even with upgrades that upgrading would be an absurdly huge waste of money because we would still at the end of the day need to replace it after we pissed away all that money.  That 2 billion would go right down the drain, an upgrade would be the epitome of a short sighted decision, pretty much everyone in town can tell you that we passed the point a decade would be reasonable more then... I dunno, a decade ago?  We have dealt with traffic jams there literally for as long as I can remember.  And I mean that quite seriously, for my entire lifes memory, I can remember traffic jams at the massey tunnel.  We have a big ass mall opening down here, deltaport just expanded, property is going up all over the place down here, and you are incredibly incredibly out of touch if you don't think we need a bridge there.  This bottleneck by the way affects the connections between Ladner/Tsawwassen and the Canada Line, the main public transit route in/out of the region, so while it may not seem like it, this is also a public transit improvement.  The only reason we haven't been pushing for it harder is we realized other regions had even worse problems.  I'm going to flat out say that we need this improvement a lot more then the Broadway Subway needs 2 million dollars, I've been keeping my mouth shut so long as other places had problems like the Patullo Bridge, but Broadway Subway is way lower priority then something like Massey Tunnel.  Edit - Here is a google maps clipping of the typical traffic at the Massey Tunnel at 5 on a weekday.  Gee guys I wonder why they're not upgrading it?

Anyway, I think replacing it is a good idea.  Going from 4 lanes to 10 lanes seems like overkill, but that's not the end of the world; my only annoyance is that it was green-lighted without any hesitation, whereas any new transit funding will now be put to a plebiscite (aka death sentence) under the BC Liberals."

Buses only because this is the main public transit route out of the region.  I think the idea is to use the 6 lanes we need currently, and then add an extra 2 for growth, and an extra 2 to promote transit use. It's a bit pricy, but I think the worry is that without the 8 lanes you have no growth, and without promoting pubilc transit with the bus lanes you're going to be flooding tons of traffic into the oak street bridge in the long term, causing congestion.  Edit - the little video the government put out had two lanes marked with diamonds.  Two lanes will likely be HOV or Bus lanes IMO.  I'm guessing the BC liberals would not mind winning back the riding from Independant Vicki Huntington, as they lost support in the region after breaking election promises repeatedly, so that might help explain the loose purse strings, probably more then the auto lobby.  See how close they are to winning a seat in Delta South - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_South.  This more then anything is probably the real reason for making such a grand bridge, this would be a big boon to anybody in Ladner/Tsawwassen, although honestly the tunnel was pretty dilapidated, unsafe, and congested."

vancouver,3cxnm5,Weirdmantis,5,Sun Jul 12 21:52:43 2015 UTC,You really think it encourages people to buy cars?  That's the most tenuous link in the history of the universe
vancouver,3cxnm5,PopeSaintHilarius,25,Sat Jul 11 20:10:56 2015 UTC,"Nah it's both logical and pretty well-established that prioritizing car-oriented infrastructure more than public transit makes it less convenient to get around without a car than it would otherwise be.  The less convenient it is to get around without a car, the more likely people will be to buy a car and drive a lot.  That's why the proportion of people who go to work by car varies wildly between different cities, even within the same country.  Indianapolis: 92% of people get to work by car  Houston: 88%   Phoenix: 88%  Los Angeles: 78%  Portland: 70%  Seattle: 63%  San Francisco: 46%  Washington DC: 43%  New York: 29%  If people's transportation choices aren't affected by the design of the city and the types of infrastructure that have been built, then why such variation?  It's not a fluke that places built to be the most car-centric and with mediocre transit have more commuting by car, compared to places where the transit systems are fairly extensive and efficient."
vancouver,3cxnm5,donjulioanejo,2,Sat Jul 11 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"Density is a huge third factor, though.  Everything you need to do in New York, DC, or San Francisco is constrained to a few city districts that are easy to get to (the same way it is with our Downtown).  To contrast, LA or Seattle are incredibly spread out.  I don't just mean the lay out of the city, I mean the general infrastructure.  I.e. the jobs are simply too spread out to make transit that viable."
vancouver,3cxnm5,PopeSaintHilarius,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:53:30 2015 UTC,"Density is a very important factor, but it's worth remembering that it's largely the result of human choices, and not a natural phenomena; these cities didn't just fall from the sky fully formed.  Sure, some cities are predisposed to being higher density due to constrained geography, but LA for example is so sprawling because humans made choices to prioritize car-centric infrastructure and city-planning, and build massive freeways everywhere that divide the city and unfortunately result in it being more difficult to get around by other modes of transportation.  Washington DC doesn't have physical barriers preventing it from being just as spread out and car-dependent as LA, but different choices were made.  Similarly, for most North American suburbs, people chose focus on building winding subdivisions, strip malls with massive parking lots, and wide roads.  They could have been built with more compact, walkable designs like Vancouver's grid-system, which would have made it easier to now accommodate people getting around by foot, bicycle and transit, but at the time (post-WWII 1950s-1970s), the negative consequences of making cities too car-dependent weren't on people's radar, and it just seemed natural to plan cities around the assumption that everyone must drive a car to go anywhere.  Going forward, we can look at how different types of city planning choices have worked out over time, learn from them, and hopefully make better choices."
vancouver,3cxnm5,misteredgy,6,Mon Jul 13 06:14:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does. It's been well documented that building more vehicle bridges etc doesn't improve traffic, but just leads to more traffic.  More traffic = more new cars."

Anyway, of course you should continue driving if that best fits your needs.  But there's a lot of other people like myself for whom transit could be a good option, so it makes sense to provide efficient public transit so that people like me won't need to commute by car, thus leaving more road space for the people like you who do need to drive."

Case in point - I want to go to Surrey Central, where I worked for about a year, from where I live (near Strawberry Hills).  I can:  a) Take the bus to 22nd Street (30 minutes), then take the Skytrain (20 more minutes), not counting the time to wait for the bus.  50 minutes total.  Direct bus takes just as long, and comes less often than 340.  b) Drive there in 12 minutes.  17 minutes if there's traffic.  ...I'm in surrey."

Transit is never going to meet everyone's needs, but with expansions and improvements it can meet more people's needs.  There are valid reasons why about ~70% of trips in Metro Vancouver are taken by car.  But over time, if we get more rapid transit lines, more buses to provide new routes and higher frequency service on existing routes, etc., then maybe we can get that down to 60% or 50%.  In that scenario you might still be a part of the 50% that chooses to drive because it best fits your needs, but at least there won't be as many other drivers in your way, compared to if we fail to expand transit service and increase ridership."

Instead of ""hey, these people only have access to a bus that comes once an hour.  Let's build a rapid line here instead.""  All the while being taxed 17c/litre for the same lack of transit.  I.e. it literally feels like Translink is sucking money from the suburbs (by forcing them to pay gas tax, because driving is the only option left to them) for yet more transit lines in Vancouver that still nowhere near pay for themselves with fare revenues."

I'm not sure what you mean by the bolded.  There are plenty of cities around the world with subways along their busiest routes.  In fact, the 99 on Broadway is the busiest bus route in all of Canada and the United States, because all other cities with such busy routes have replaced them with more efficient forms of transit.  Also keep in mind that ~50% of people traveling on Broadway live outside of the CoV.  Until earlier this year, I had never lived within 8 km of any Skytrain station, yet I had ridden them hundreds of times.  People don't solely benefit from transit built nearby.  I would've benefited from a Broadway Line even when I was living in Pitt Meadows / Maple Ridge.   Instead of ""hey, these people only have access to a bus that comes once an hour. Let's build a rapid line here instead.""   They're currently building a rapid transit line through Port Moody and Coquitlam, and they proposed building 3 light rail lines throughout Surrey, but that's obviously on hold for the time being.  Maybe you liked the light rail plan or maybe you didn't, but it would have meant a $2 billion dollar investment in transit in Surrey, if I recall.  I do hope that rapid transit will get extended through Surrey sooner than later, but it also needs to be extended along the Broadway corridor."
vancouver,3cxnm5,donjulioanejo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:36:30 2015 UTC,"""Feels like"" isn't factual. The peripheral suburbs demand more expensive infrastructure per capita than the money they contribute to infrastructure, they aren't subsidizing Translink in the slightest. The problem they face is the bus routes to the less dense sections are huge money sinks per rider, where Vancouver and Burnaby are operating near cost recovery.  The problem is the budget is constrained, so the higher subsidized routes get squeezed out to protect the higher value lines, which leads to the appearance that the suburbs are getting screwed. Then instead they take a car and drive across 2-4 billion dollars worth of road infrastructure with a conveniently invisible price tag while complaining about the price of transit."
vancouver,3cxnm5,slavior,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:49 2015 UTC,"Road infrastructure they pay tolls for.  And more planned road infrastructure most people don't want to see since it's going to have tolls on it too.  While again, paying gas tax that goes directly to Translink.  Want it to be fair?  Fine.  Put in a gas tax per municipality relative to how much transit infrastructure it gets.  Vancouver/Burnaby paying 25c and getting 3 Skytrain lines and numerous b-lines sounds fair.  Surrey paying 10c and Langley paying 5c also sounds fair, considering how little they actually get.  This would also have an effect of reducing traffic in already congested areas by moving people to transit, but without screwing the much less affluent people over in the far-off suburbs who are also forced to rely on cars due to a lack of transit."

vancouver,3cxnm5,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,9,Sat Jul 11 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"The most traveled routes in the transit network are downtown and UBC routes. A colleague of mine lives in Yaletown and works at UBC. She has a daughter in daycare at UBC. For her to take transit she has an 5-10 minute walk to the bus, a 30 minute bus ride, a 10 minute walk to the daycare, and then a 20 minute walk to our lab.  Or its a quick ~20 minute total drive in her car.   You try doing that at 7am in the rain with a screaming toddler and you will quickly see why some people really prefer a car over transit even in the city.   Government needs to cater to all citizen's needs, we need better transit and better roads. The two are not exclusive of one another."
vancouver,3cxnm5,donjulioanejo,0,Sat Jul 11 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"/u/slavior being an ass aside the problem is that they are exclusive of one and other as we build most things today, if by 'better roads' you mean 'better roads for the use of private cars'.    Building better roads for cars to use without putting a proper price on them to limit their use both undermines the demand for transit by causing more people to drive, and decreases the supply of transit by allowing more cars to congest trip-terminating areas and subsidizing land use patterns which make transit difficult, expensive to serve, and inconvenient to use. If, say, the Port Mann Bridge hadn't been tolled and we'd seen an uptick in traffic trying to get in tonw, all the extra traffic would reduce ridership on the skytrain (which does pay for it's own operations, unlike highway 1), and all the traffic coming off the highway would funnel into roads in Downtown, Broadway, various corridors in Burnaby or Richmond or Whalley and the increased traffic would slow down the buses. Meanwhile because more traffic is coming by car, developers and businesses have less incentive to serve walking customers and more incentive to serve motorists to solicit business.  This requires expensive parking lots, and furthers a general trend to spread things out, sperating destinations with parking and buffers to accommodate and mitigate the car traffic and make them inconvenient for non-motorized customers. The increase in car traffic also tends to make cities more dangerous to pedestrians, further damaging the economics of transit and other non-car modes of getting about.    This trend is something that successful cities have spent the last 60 years resisting, rather than furthering."

I'd look more into these links if there was a ban on say, direct auto sales here in Vancouver."
vancouver,3cxnm5,newrig,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:25:00 2015 UTC,Because of induced demand Building more roads won't result in less congestion.  Metro Vancouver already has a lot of road infrastructure compared to many cities. [1] [2]  Building larger roads would be expensive and would not greatly reduce congestion.  Only better land use planning and an increased cost of driving will reduce congestion.

There's a safety and reliability issue here as well.  The tunnel is over 60 years old is at capacity and traffic is getting any better backing up busses, commuters, and trucks.     Hopefully, with a bit of planning the region will avoid pit falls that create more traffic by expanding local options for employment and housing however, even if those strategies were 100% effective you would sill probably need to replace the tunnel for the same reason the Potello bridge should be replaced."

vancouver,3cz7m1,eketros,5,Sun Jul 12 03:25:59 2015 UTC,"To add to billy's comment I would say key considerations of a landlord would be. 1 your salary, at $30k I would be comfortable renting you something sub $900 in rent.  2. How well behaved is your dog, beagles are known to be very noisy and in a basement suite that would be an issue. 3. How responsible do you sound, can I expect wild parties and music playing at all hours. I would second those other comments re: basement suites and suggest you look to Burnaby and new west."

GOOD NEWS, though...  There is life outside downtown and it is where you need to be. With the beauty of skytrain, you have much MUCH MORE options in New west and Burnaby. And, this my friend, is where you belong.  Drop your budget to 900$ and get yourself a nice one bedroom apt in a pet friendly building. When you book to view, ask them if they want to meet your dog."

vancouver,3cz7m1,vansoftware,11,Sun Jul 12 08:55:19 2015 UTC,"As an amateur landlord who is picky about tenants, my take on your situation is this: 1) you don't have employment stability yet (contract work and employment history limited) 2) you are looking in very competitive neighbourhoods where even if you are the only applicant, landlords think something better will eventually come along and they can wait (esp. property managers) 3) just because a place is pet friendly, in many cases a landlord will still always choose a non-pet owning tenant over one with a pet 4) your income is too low, your GF has no income that can be proven, PR papers WILL take a while (our last tenants were in same boat - she was waiting for PR papers - took around 2 years)  all of which = bit of a gamble  You would be much better off looking in less competitive neighbourhoods, not targeting places that use property management companies (they are less likely to take a chance on you than other landlords who may offer their place to you if you make a good impression), and building up your housing history in the city first.  Also, we allow dogs in our place but we insist on meeting the dog as well. Offer to do that so you can show them that you are a responsible dog owner. You need to show landlords that having a pet does not make you more of a liability than a non-pet owning tenant.  It's all about first impressions in my opinion. You need to speak to your possible limitations and convince landlords they are not issues and you are aware that they may be concerned about them."
vancouver,3cz7m1,vansoftware,0,Sun Jul 12 08:56:58 2015 UTC,"All of the above have passed through our mind with every rejection, but we were hoping(still are a little) that maybe one of the landlords would no see it as a big issue , we even added to our application a Cover letter king of explaining who  we are, employment letter singed by the company with contact inf, and even ask for an interview with our dog to make our case stronger. but it seems that didnt make a difference in those cases.  So I'll keep trying to look for more landlord face to face rental , instead of the Rental companies, but as you say Its going to be in other neighborhoods ,knowing that a lot of downtown/westend apts are manage by rental companies  Thank you  for the your  insight"

vancouver,3cz7m1,Berdavark,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:02:53 2015 UTC,At the begging I thought Like why do the landlord care if spend 60-70% of my income on the rent as long as I pay my rent on time but as applications keep getting rejected   I think this might be a big issue too.
vancouver,3cz7m1,impulser91,8,Sun Jul 12 04:04:15 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that if 60-70% of your take home salary is going to rent, it's going to be very hard to pay utilities, food, transportation, etc. Something will eventually have to give, and that can be a hard, messy situation. I can understand why a landlord would be hesitant to rent to someone who will be barely above water for the time being. I think you need to be realistic about you can afford on $30,000/year.   I agree with the person who suggested basement suites. A private landlord is usually more flexible than a company. You might want to extend your search to Burnaby and New West--it's cheaper than Vancouver and transit is easy enough on the skytrain. Worry about the dream downtown apartment when you both have jobs and you have a bit of credit. It's certainly possible to sink most of your income into rent, but it's not always a fun or enjoyable way to live."

vancouver,3cz7m1,Slashmonkey,2,Sun Jul 12 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"I work at a property management firm. I'm not part of the rental department involved with screening tenant applications so I don't quite know all the logic behind it, but here's a few things that are worth pointing out:  Salary - Your salary is on the lower end of salaries. While you could technically fulfill your rental payments usually the higher the salary the better you'll get your tenant application approved. The reasoning is mostly in fear that you can't keep up with your regular rental payment - which either means the tenant will leave earlier than the agreed lease or the landlord will be force to evict you both of which means more headache for the landlord.  Credit - We always check credit rating. No credit usually means we ignore the application or we have a hard time convincing the landlord to take you in unless we don't receive many tenancy applications.  Girlfriend + Pet - Unfortunately for couples and pet owners, this demographic isn't exactly the most worthwhile people to lease to. The reasons are quite simple: relationships are dynamic and both partners aren't necessarily fully committed to one and another (they could break up). In the event of this, regular rental payments could not be fulfilled. And of course we get into the more illogical reasoning but I'm not even going to go there.  As for the dog, that's usually a landlord preference but its mostly because they don't like the smell and mess pets can make.  Unemployment History - Also looked upon, longer unemployment period usually makes it harder for you to be accepted."

Buy a PROPER belt...a belt you wear with jeans will NOT suffice and grab a pair of dress socks.  Shoes can be bought a payless. And...to be honest, if you are on a tight budget b/c this is your first job...hit walmart and/or value village. Upgrade when you can afford it.   The key to a guy looking good isn't always how expensive this outfit is, it is how it fits! Get properly measured for a shirt. Its not S, M, L...its numbers. Sales people are there to help you.

vancouver,3d2dcn,mountainslayer,2,Mon Jul 13 01:20:34 2015 UTC,"The only thing you really need is the time to do it.  Brake pad replacement is one of those things that is ridiculously easy to do yourself, but crazy-expensive to get done at a shop.  Budget isn't an excuse to not do it: as mentioned above the jack & stand & tools will be less than the shop price. You can even (shhh) buy from crappy tire, do the job in the parking lot, then return the tools. Tool co-ops, as mentioned, are available if you'd rather something a bit more honest.  Space requirements are basically zero for this kind of job. You need a few feet on the side of the car to work in. Tool storage is minimal. The tools will easily fit in your trunk or, if you'd rather not keep them, return them or sell them on Craigslist to make the job even cheaper.  If you're time starved, well, then sure, take your car to a shop, but know you're paying a premium to get your time back."

A large C-Clamp to retract the brake pistons ($15). Or find someone to borrow these off of.  Don't forget the anti-squeal lubricant ($5). If you order parts online from the States shipped to Point Roberts, you can save big ($140 total for front/rear pads and rotors).

Moving here from Boston, even the Mark I trains are positively modern and smooth riding compared to most of the MBTA system. I've never had to hold on to the SkyTrain with the same strength that I regularly used to hold on to Green Line trains in Boston, nor has any sound from our trains come even close to the horrible screeching sound of a Red Line train taking the curve at Harvard Square.  And if you think the regular sound of the trains running is loud, you should never visit New York.  We're perfectly safe."

As we blast along, I look at all the houses (some of them very new developments,) that are within a stones throw of the train.

vancouver,3czt9q,JPLebeau,3,Sun Jul 12 07:23:14 2015 UTC,"The supervisor claims that his decision to kill the cubs was based on opinion provided by the Provincial Wildlife Veterinarian. The instructions to destroy the cubs was issued before the cubs were even captured and the veterinarian made no examination of the cubs and did not even have a description from the field. From the supervisor's email, the vet nevertheless apparently had made a decision absent of information:    ""Final decision has been made by Provincial Vet and you have rec'd direction re: what you need to do.""   Either the supervisor was not truthful or the veterinarian made a diagnosis without sufficient information. A subsequent veterinary inspection that Casavant took the bear for concluded that the bears were not garbage habituated, as he had suspected. Per Casavant's email:    ""The cubs have received full medical attention by a veterinarian for health and assessment of their diet to date. They have not accessed unnatural food at this time. They will be transported in accordance with provincial policy for a follow up medical assessment and behavioural assessment to determine if they are rehabilitation candidates.""   This sounds exactly like a conservation officer carrying out his duties in a forthright and prudent manner and it also shows that had the provincial vet made a proper examination of the animals, she would have come to a different conclusion than the one she was said to have come to and one based on fact. Casavant should be commended. He goes on to say:    ""If a provincial vet would like to do a full health and behavioural assessment for potential euthanization at a later time then that is the call of an informed decision maker who is a qualified veterinarian and will abide by zoology best practices for the destruction of an animal.""   In other words, the provincial veterinarian that the supervisor said had made the call to euthanize had made no such evaluation.   This is something that the College of Veterinarians of BC needs to investigate. So does the head of the Conservation Officer Service. You can't have a supervisory cop who isn't truthful. This is what the College of Veterinarians has to say:   ""All veterinarians practising in the province must be registered and governed by the CVBC as the statutory body created by the Veterinarians Act to oversee, in the public interest, the practice of veterinary medicine in B.C.  Like every professional regulatory body, the CVBC is responsible for establishing and enforcing standards of professional competence and conduct for all practitioners, and for responding to complaints about veterinarians.  Veterinarians are required to in every aspect of the handling of a case, meet the standard of care, skill and knowledge, and conduct, expected of a competent and ethical professional. """
vancouver,3czt9q,SirToxalot,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"Lots of assumptions about the way the provincial wildlife veterinarians make decisions in here.  He says that a provincial wildlife veterinarian is used in all borderline cases. Do you think they send the vet up a tree to ""diagnose"" a pissed off 180 lb cougar? Of course not. The vet is judging the animal's behavior in the wild, so he gives his opinion based on the animal's behavioral history, not necessarily by physically examining it in a clinic.   If the supervising Conservation Officer said the provincial veterinarian said these cubs should be destroyed given that they had probably learned to go to human habitation for food and had no fear of the home owners, then that's probably what happened.   What exactly do you think the value of an in-person examination is in evaluating a wild animal's behavioral propensities? They could have taken a bear that had broken in to 50 houses and eaten a dog and put in a cage and it would probably act afraid and ""un-habituated.""  The only thing the veterinarian that Casavant took them to confirmed was that they had not eaten garbage... how, well, probably a fecal. Which probably isn't a guarantee that they didn't eat any garbage, and certainly doesn't confirm their level of habituation."
vancouver,3czt9q,a7neu,2,Sun Jul 12 23:56:43 2015 UTC,"Not really assumptions. Read the email history. The Vet would not have had even a phone convo with the Conservation Officer. If the provincial vet can't make a proper assessment (the way the vet that Casavant took it to), so be it but then don't make shit up. Just say that the vet would need to make an assessment. From the email, it is clear that no assessment, even 2 minutes of Q&A over the phone with the CO was made. That is really lame veterinary practice.  It is obvious that once qualified assessment was made, it was determined that the cubs could be rehab'd. An enormous difference - life and death in fact."
vancouver,3czt9q,SirToxalot,0,Mon Jul 13 01:05:32 2015 UTC,"I have read them. Sounds to me like the supervising Conservation Officer and the provincial wildlife vet made the call based on home owner reports that the bears were following the mother around as she broke into homes and the fact that they let humans get within 12"". I would imagine that the vast majority of decisions to destroy an animal are based on home owner reports. It's unlikely that the CO is going to be on the scene when a bear breaks in or a dog is eaten. Those reports were the reason the mother was shot and Casavant was there to begin with. I don't see how a vet talking to Casavant over the phone or looking at them in person would change anything about the cubs' documented experience with humans or behavioral proclivities in the wild."
vancouver,3czt9q,a7neu,2,Mon Jul 13 01:13:13 2015 UTC,"Well, the bears were not yet weaned. Of course they would follow the mother around.  You miss the point entirely. The provincial vet made no assessment but gave an opinion to destroy the animals. Either that or the supervisory CO was not being truthful. Neither scenario is ok.  As for the provincial vet, a different vet made an actual assessment and concluded that the animals did not need to be put down.  Bears are not endangered but snuffing out life for no good reason or because of budgetary considerations is not what the public expects.  Casavant seems to have considered this situation based on his own assessment. Of all those involved in the email, he was the only one who was there in the field. It isn't that he is a conscientious objector. After all, he did kill the mother bear. He was making an assessment on the cubs and from what is available, it was a pretty good and fair assessment. The same can't be said for the supervisor or the provincial vet."
vancouver,3czt9q,SirToxalot,0,Mon Jul 13 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think I do miss the point, I think you do.   Why do you keep saying the provincial vet made no assessment? What are you considering an assessment? The vet made an assessment based on their behavioral history, which was documented via home owner reports of the cubs following their mom as she broke into residences, and showing no fear of humans. That is the relevant information to make a decision on.  Again, are you denying that a documented history of experience with humans is grounds to destroy an animal? Again, what could you learn from seeing the cubs in the field that would change their documented behavioral history?  And yes of course, the bears weren't weaned and were following their mother around... likely learning from her, maybe even nibbling solids."
vancouver,3czt9q,a7neu,2,Mon Jul 13 01:50:36 2015 UTC,"For a medical professional to provide recommendation, the professional should examine the animal or, in the case of this recommendation, at the very least have a discussion with the CO. The CO clearly had information pertinent to the question of whether or not the cubs were rehab'able and that was confirmed by the subsequent vet who actually examined the animal. There is no evidence of that having happened and the sequence of events suggests that it did not. That being the case, I have to question the truthfulness of the representations made by the supervisory CO."
vancouver,3czt9q,SirToxalot,0,Mon Jul 13 04:03:02 2015 UTC,"For a medical professional to provide recommendation, the professional should examine the animal    Yeah in the case of taking your pet to the vet for a medical condition. Provincial vets advise on policy all the time. This was a behavioral assessment not a medical assessment, so she used behavioral records, not a physical exam, to make the call.  The supervising CO has probably been doing the job longer than Casavant and no doubt knows far more about nuisance wildlife than you or I. He deemed that he had enough information to make a judgement on the case, no further information was needed, and I don't see any reason to doubt him. That a veterinarian (was it even a wildlife veterinarian?) said there was no evidence of the bears eating garbage doesn't have to change anything. As a made-up example to illustrate the point: If he gets a report of a cougar sitting by people's sliding glass doors, watching pets inside, does it matter that a fecal analysis shows no signs of it having eaten a dog recently? No, the fact that it hadn't eaten a dog wouldn't change the decision, because the behavorial reports were sufficient to make the call. A vet does not need to examine the cougar nor phone the CO who trees the cougar to talk about it... they already have enough information."
vancouver,3czt9q,a7neu,-5,Mon Jul 13 05:00:57 2015 UTC,"Here is what the e-mail chain shows:   A bear encounter is reported where three bears are all showing clear evidence of being habituated (no fear of being close to humans, etc.) Based on that information and policy which has been established by experts, a senior level manager makes the decision that all three bears need to be put down.  It appears that a veterinarian is also involved in an assessment of this specific case.   It's sad but the policy is there for a reason.  For reference, COs have to put down 1000 bears/year and hunters take 10,000-20,000 bears/year in BC.  Also for reference, rehab centers can only handle so many bears each year and rehab is hard to do.  It hurts everyone to try to rehab bears that are too far gone because it takes away spaces from bears that actually have a chance at being successfully rehabilitated.  The CO (union employee,) refuses to follow the directions. The manager asks the CO to hand over the file to a different CO. The CO also refuses to follow that direction.   At this point, it would be entirely reasonable for the managers to have phoned the police and asked them to intercept the CO to take away his weapons and to have him hand over the bears.  We simply can't have gun-carrying COs running around the province, refusing to follow established policy and refusing to take orders from their superiors.  At that point, CO should have also been fired with cause and no severance.    This story is a case-study of how unions try to run this province and why the unions are slowly losing the respect of the general population."

A flashing green light is not exclusively at intersections with stop signs and signals and intersections with stop signs and signals do not all use the flashing green.  Technically speaking, in BC, a flashing green light is used to indicate that the signal is controlled by an outside source that isn't a motor vehicle, not just pedestrians. For example, bicyclists can sometimes activate such a signal.  A flashing green light need not only be located at intersections. They are occasionally found at mid block crossings where a different section of the BC MVA applies to them. When a red light is displayed where there is no intersection,  you only need to stop and allow the pedestrians to cross. Unlike the section that deals with intersections, you are not required to wait for a different signal to allow you to go.  As for stop sign intersections with traffic lights, flashing yellow lights are occasionally used in place of a flashing green.

vancouver,3czzk4,TheJackal8,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:35:39 2015 UTC,The lack of signalling is annoying. But much worse - nobody has a clue that the car in the circle has the right of way.
vancouver,3czzk4,alvarkresh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:38:55 2015 UTC,"Different part of Alberta. There are about 4 traffic circles in Calgary, and to my knowledge all only one lane. I studied up on these after running into one near Bragg Creek. Thanks for the heads up though."
vancouver,3czzk4,burtaexpat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:56:37 2015 UTC,"Just to confirm, it means it's pedestrian controlled. It's green until someone needs to cross, and you pretty much don't see it anywhere outside of the city."
vancouver,3czzk4,RunsOverCyclists,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:24:41 2015 UTC,Actually I have seen flashing green pedestrian controlled intersections elsewhere in BC.
vancouver,3czzk4,vansoftware,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:23:57 2015 UTC,"Flashing green means that the intersection has a pedestrian controlled light. People who want to cross the road facing the flashing green lights push a button and the light then cycles like a regular traffic light for one cycle. In Alberta these are usually flashing amber or red lights that flash temporarily giving the pedestrian priority. I think the flashing green thing is a GVRD thing only.   (1) Yes, by law you must yeild to them- or at the very lease ICBC will fail you during a driving test if you drive past one and it's signalling to pull back out in to traffic after stopping for passengers. Also, the bus drivers in Vancouver deal with the high level of passive aggression and low situational awareness of the average Vancouver driver by being much more aggressive with a much larger vehicle. As someone who rides a motorcycle, I like getting in behind an aggressive B-line bus driver and enjoying the wake of cleared traffic they leave if I have to commute during the bad bits of rushhour. They will pull out in to traffic and crowd your car out if you are being an asshat and not yielding to them.  (2) You can pull in to the intersection. You are legally allowed to complete your turn even after the light turns red. Just remember that the Lower Mainland has few, if any, left advances and drivers are aggressive as hell, turning left, especially in Vancouver proper, can be difficult. You will have to put the gas pedal to the floor. Just don't end up stuck in the intersection or part way over the cross walk when the light turns red. You are then impeding traffic and/or pedestrians.   (3) I believe it's 40 km/hr or greater. I think the same rule applies in Alberta still"
vancouver,3czzk4,theadvenger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:46:46 2015 UTC,"The rule for speeding in Alberta is that exceeding the posted limit by 60km/h or greater has a mandatory court appearance to go along with the ticket. Presumably, so the judge can tell you what an idiot you are."
vancouver,3czzk4,RunsOverCyclists,0,Tue Jul 14 01:23:20 2015 UTC,"Flashing green is stupid. It just means that it's a pedestrian controlled intersection.  Basically treat it as a green.  A pedestrian can hit the crosswalk button to turn the light red but you don't really need to know that as a driver so the flashing part is silly and it confuses people from other regions where it means other things.  Yes, buses are basically big moving yield signs.  They own the road and when they turn on the blinkers to join traffic, you have to let them in first.  Haven't heard about not being able to enter the intersection.  Obviously don't start your turn and block the flow.  Note that you may find that a lot more people go through on a yellow than you are used to.  You need to be going 40km/h over the limit to get impounded.  http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/osmv/road-safety/speed.htm  That sounds like a lot but it can sneak up on you pretty easy given that we have 4 lane highways with sections that have 70km/h limits.  Edit to add: Lots of bad drivers here.  Assume everyone is trying to kill you and no one is competent.  Leave space.  Keep your eyes open.  Don't assume that a driver will be reasonable/competent just because they are driving a BMW or other nice brand."

A proceed with caution before switching to a total green."
vancouver,3czzk4,Squealio,2,Sun Jul 12 09:15:15 2015 UTC,The proliferation of manual transmissions outside Canada and the United States means that traffic signals in much of the world have a red+yellow phase before the green to tell motorists to get into gear.
vancouver,3czzk4,chicken_boner,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:34:31 2015 UTC,Down votes?  Okay can someone actually tell me how flashing green for pedestrian controlled lights actually improves driving or pedestrian commutes in any fashion?
vancouver,3czzk4,Choralation,2,Sun Jul 12 18:17:02 2015 UTC,They don't. They're actually dangerous because a flashing green in the rest of Canada means traffic facing it has the right of way in every direction.  There are stories of motorists from Ontario causing accidents because they didn't know that.
vancouver,3czzk4,sharper44,0,Mon Jul 13 08:39:18 2015 UTC,"The flashing green light simply means that it is a pedestrian controlled intersection: ie - there is a button for a ped to push so they get to cross.     Other points   Yes please yield to buses pulling away from stops. You can pull into the intersection, just keep your wheels straight so if you get rear ended you don't get pushed into oncoming traffic! I dunno.  Anyone?"

What I am saying is that the operation of the Nestlé plant in Hope would not appear to be affecting the local water supply in Hope, the greater water supply of the Fraser Valley or the even greater water supply of the Lower Mainland. Nestlé’s water supply is completely independent of the water supply used by you and me in Metro Vancouver and not a single litre of the water bottled in Hope would otherwise be available to the users in Vancouver dependent on the Metro Vancouver Water system. The only reason to deprive those 75 people of their employment and the District of Hope of those tax revenues, during this drought, is to make someone else suffer in order to make ourselves feel better and that is not a very reasonable basis for a policy decision.

They could have asked the company to help build infrastructure to supply Hope with some of that water to help with our overall supply.   But no. Pennies, with nothing to gain from us."
vancouver,3cv1o2,transmogrified,5,Sat Jul 11 08:44:51 2015 UTC,Isn't that exactly why businesses pay property tax?  So they are paying tens of thousands of dollars of money for infrastructure such as water infrastructure which they aren't actually using and lots of items like policing and roads which they do use (which they rightfully should be doing the same as any other firm operating in Hope).
vancouver,3cv1o2,transmogrified,4,Sat Jul 11 09:30:45 2015 UTC,"I think the argument is that somewhere along the line, whatever the business is paying for the resource was miscalculated and it's NOT ENOUGH.  Who cares if Hope doesn't directly supply Vancouver?  Nestle is receiving something that many in BC do not consider to be a fair value proposition.  The issue isn't that there's a water bottling facility there, it's that they aren't paying enough to be there for the benefit they provide the province.    We are beginning to re-assess the value of our water, especially under the threat of continued drought.  THAT's what people are upset by."
vancouver,3cv1o2,transmogrified,5,Sat Jul 11 15:03:24 2015 UTC,"Where they are pulling from does not supply Hope residents either. They are literally pulling water that is destined to flow into the Fraser and wash out to sea. They are doing something that has zero impact on drought or water security issues and that is why the outrage is just silly.   We only take a small fee on the water so they actually have to have a water license so if the need be we can always restrict or control water consumption by said consumers. The fee of $2.25 per 1000m3 or about $600 per year just makes the company pay for the fact we can now regulate and restrict use if we feel the need.   They provide 75 full time jobs. so roughly $4.5 million in wages to the community, they pay full property tax on the facility that pays for the actual roads and water infrastructure used by the property and rest of community, and then they pay corporate taxes to both the province and the federal government. Those are directly not including all the spin off employment and taxes from the transportation, marketing, and final retail sales of said product. All in exchange they pull about 76 seconds worth of the flow of the fraser river ever year worth of water that would simply end up in the ocean like almost %100 of our fresh water. Further we don't have drought issues we have water supply issues, our reservoirs for metro Vancouver are using spill ways 10 months out of the year since they are over capacity, we really need to work on improving our storage capacity or bringing on one of the other lakes as a reservoir especially with the continued growth in population.   btw just before I am sure someone calls me a shill. I don't buy bottled water because its simply stupid and Nestle is actually a rather abhorrent company with its international track record and i avoid their products when possible and recommend others do the same."
vancouver,3cv1o2,transmogrified,2,Sat Jul 11 16:34:38 2015 UTC,"My point is that if they start ""Pulling"" too much, they may increase the speed with which water would naturally leave the system further upstream without changing the level of the aquifer significantly until it's too late for them to notice.  This could have adverse effects on the ecosystem which could also cause a significant change in the structure of the watershed and thereby threaten Hope's residents.  Again, replacement is based off of rainfall and snowmelt. These things have been conspicuously absent and will change how those rivers flow. Just because it has zero impact now does not mean it will continue to do so, and this drought will necessarily change the way we assess how much the watersheds can handle.  So like I said, I have no problem putting a halt to things while they start to reassess how much we can take and how much what we take should be worth if sold.  Our entire basis for these deals was ""we've got SO MUCH WATER"" and now it's seeming like more and more we will not have so much water, and the world will not have so much water, and those places with plenty will be poised to be rich if they start effectively managing their resource, which does't happen when you put a company in charge of an increasingly scarce product that has a pretty strong track record of shitty behavior.  My point is that we usually wait until it's too late to start managing a resource effectively, especially when things change quickly.  Like I said, we have no idea what the watershed looks like in a drought."

These reports conclude that Nestlé Waters Canada has had no negative impact on the Kawkawa Lake sub-watershed in the 15 year history of our operations.""   ""We withdraw less than one per cent of the available groundwater in the Kawkawa Lake sub-watershed,""   They have to report how much they are pulling, this amount can be adjusted by the province, and they got a 15 year track record of having zero impact.   Remember, them pulling nothing just has the water flow into the Fraser and literally nothing changes with how much water we have in reserves for future use.

vancouver,3cv1o2,transmogrified,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:54:53 2015 UTC,"I get that,  I really do, and I'm not trying to argue that they don't have a history of data, but they're using available groundwater as their metric.  Lowering the available groundwater through use down-stream effects upstream environments.  Do you get that dropping a water table at sea level means their is an increased demand on the available water further upstream, in the mountains where the sub-watersheds pull from?   It's been a long time since my forestry degree and I don't have access to all the articles, but in my hydrology courses there are a lot of examples of how downstream use can impact upstream ecosystems.    Especially if these ecosystems are experiencing stress from the drought, which they are undoubtedly are, they will be especially sensitive to any changes downstream.  And especially if there's less water to begin with (lack of rain and snow), while it may seem that the sub-watershed is doing just fine since the levels aren't dropping, pulling water out of the sub-watershed increases the rate of removal of that water from the ecosystems upstream.  This can have detrimental effects to the watershed as a whole.  Healthy forests help regulate against floods, prevent further drought, clean the water for you.  Measuring it at their point of use isn't enough.  Impacts are definitely best-measured downstream, but we're just beginning to understand how downstream usage can effect upstream usage.  Which is why I think it's prudent at this point to re-assess the whole system.  Like I said, just because they have ""zero impact"" now, and to their local subwatershed, doesn't mean there aren't far-reaching consequences.  Again and again we go ""oh this system is fine because our metrics say it's fine"", and then they fail, and then we realize our metric was anachronistic or being lied about or just plain wrong to begin with.  Especially now that we're seeing significant climate change, it's not enough to look to the past and say ""it's been fine"".  Healthy forests and ecosystems upstream are essential for the continued health of the watersheds downstream.  Damaging ecosystems upstream can further CAUSE sources of water to dry up, or re-direct, or silt up, or become polluted.

Another reason would be to re-assess the volume they are able to extract in light of the fact that we face sustained drought and re-adjust our policies before they screw up the local environment irreparably.  Another reason would be to re-assess the price they are purchasing at, to avoid further entrenching the company ""as-is"" into the local community until it's ""too big to fail"" and we're stuck with Nestle and it's current practices and price-structure.  These assholes won't let go without a fight, the more we allow them the more they will take."
vancouver,3cv1o2,jimmyt_canadian,8,Sat Jul 11 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"Um, actually, this aquifer has been evaluated and it is not limited. The extraction is a small percentage.  Now on the point of whether we got a good deal for a public resource... we did not."
vancouver,3cv1o2,docnotsopc,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:04:25 2015 UTC,"Has it been evaluated recently, with a full understanding of where the aquifer pulls from after draw-down?  Hope is an ""unconfined aquifer"" and pulls from a watershed, which requires rainfall and snowmelt to replenish.  While we judge whether or not the aquifer is ""healthy"", that judgement is based on projections for rainfall, snowpacks, and temperature.  If those judgements were not based upon current conditions, or our rapidly changing projected conditions, they will be inaccurate and cause shortages further up the supply line before it's close enough to Hope for the residents to notice that their sources aren't as abundant as projected.  For example, we should be taking worst-case drought scenarios (well, maybe not total apocalypse, but based on the knowledge we have now) and using THAT rather than whether or not the aquifer is above or below some mark to regulate water usage.    They'll need to keep eyes up the whole supply chain to make sure they're not over-drawing. We've never observed before how the aquifer responds to drought and the sooner we start managing, the more we'll have for longer.  While not entirely unexpected, I wouldn't be surprised if the projections were a lot more optimistic than they should be.  Hope may cause damage elsewhere before they fuck up your own backyard, and by the time they fuck up their own back yard it's probably too late to re-assess.    This drought is a wake-up call on our water usage and, on our assessment techniques, and on how our legal systems and governments manages resource extraction.    And I agree, not really a good deal for a public resource."

I heard a lot of ""I'll never vote for the ___________party because of [whatever political grievance] !!!"" So, race is surely a factor but it's wrong to say that traditional politics no longer has anything to do with it. IMO Wai Young is actually a good example of politics/ideology trumping identity, people voted for the idea of the conservative party since she made little effort to distinguish herself during the campaign.  She didn't even show up to the debates and hasn't made much of a public name for herself during her term either, as far as I'm concerned."

It's the same way they only run GLBT candidates in urban ridings with large GLBT populations in order to appear progressive without risking seats.  What I'm saying is that their race is only a part of it. You can't say Dosanjh winning one election and Young winning the next is entirely up to demographics.

There are other ways to go about this, fining people or impounding vehicles will not stop it."

It's pretty selfish to think that just because you want to modify your car, the rest of the city should have to listen to it. Enforcing the law isn't going to increase incidents, and makes you sound like a rebellious 17 year old."

vancouver,3cutzb,RunsOverCyclists,5,Sat Jul 11 02:27:35 2015 UTC,"RCMP can issue a VI (vehicle inspection) which requires that the car be inspected for safety/law compliance, and usually the car is immediately impounded. If the vehicle fails it cannot be insured until it is brought back into regulation.   I think it was earlier this year the the well known ""revscene thursday night meetup"" pissed enough people off that the fuzz basically inspected every vehicle going to the meetup and issued multiple VI's."

vancouver,3cutzb,RunsOverCyclists,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:02:01 2015 UTC,"No Maybe (maybe it's a distraction?). But withholding insurance works to enforce compliance with the MVA. Why do you want vehicles that don't comply with the MVA on the road?  It is incredibly easy to have a vehicle that doesn't break the loudness rules. In fact, its easier than the alternative. If you choose to break this rule, I'm really not going to worry if you get in an accident and are found personally liable. Same with rolling coal or improperly coloured lights."

vancouver,3cutzb,RunsOverCyclists,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:10:45 2015 UTC,"The problem (? I'm not sure it's a problem really) is that ICBC has more or less rolled (basic) insurance and registration into one package. So sure, we should withdraw the registration. IANAL, but I'm pretty sure an unregistered vehicle can't be insured to drive. If we were in a province or state that had separated insurance and registration tags, then I'd worry more about the specifics of which is which.   I don't understand how you feel entitled to drive a vehicle that contravenes the MVA, nor how you feel entitled to coercing ICBC into insuring your non-compliant vehicle."

It's absolutely hilarious that you used 'barista' as your example to belittle r/vancouver because they are the ones that most frequently have to decide whether or not to continue serving alcohol - a policy that is UP TO THE EMPLOYEE TO DICTATE HOW THE POLICY SHOULD BE INTERPRETED. You think a manager who has not assessed the scenario all night will override a bartender's decision to stop serving a patron alcohol? Don't kid yourself.    You are COMPLETELY WRONG about employees not dictating the interpretation of policies. This isn't a job where management and employee share the same work space such as a retail job (and even then it's arguable). In this case, management is working off of MUCH LESS INFORMATION than that of the field worker. You'd be an idiot (which you are) to think that a less-informed manager is more capable of making the correct decision than a more-informed field worker. As shown in the e-mails, the manager shows little regard for the field worker's more-informed assessment of the situation.    I work in an industry where trust of field workers is of utmost importance to not only the operations, but the safety of field workers AND the general public. Management trusts their abilities to make the correct interpretation because THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE HIRED FOR. These aren't grade school kids following orders of their teachers, they're well-trained professionals with years of training for the sole purpose of MAKING SUCH DECISIONS.  It's obviously easy to keep your head down and follow rules blindly, but real managers see the value of an employee that is passionate about their opinion, whether or not the management actually agrees, because over time, these opinions will drive change for the better. If no one ever questioned the decisions of upper management, how would anyone ever know if something was being done incorrectly?  Maybe you should find a job in an environment where you can observe this, so you don't go around spewing garbage that is not in any way applicable to this situation."

Don't kid yourself.    It's not really like that though. This is more like a manager that says after they've had 7 shots in under an hour, DO NOT serve them anymore. And the bartender goes, well, they don't seem too drunk so I will serve them more.   The superior Conservation Officer says that 5 month old bear cubs that have spent a week following their mom to a residence while she breaks in and feeds, and who got within 12 inches of a human, are at a high enough risk for habituation that we're not going to rehab them. I'm not sure that being in the field would change that call.   The Conservation Officer in the field says, well, they must have been primarily nursing, no one saw them eat, and it would be bad PR, so I'm not doing it."
vancouver,3cu11x,a7neu,-2,Sat Jul 11 15:57:12 2015 UTC,"I'll try to explain it again for you  There is a policy in place. The manager told the employee to follow the policy. The employee refused.  It is not his role to decide which policy to refuse, which is why he has been disciplined. It's pretty clear cut. Whether destroying the bears is the subjectively right thing to do is up for debate, however in regards to policy he did the wrong thing. Management has to trust employees will follow direction. He did not.   That is very different than ""we have a legal obligation to not over serve, you have to pay attention to when the person is intoxicated and then cut them off""  There is no interpretation of policy there. Good policy leaves little room for open interpretation"

The CO said the bears were twins, about 5lb and 10lb (very, very young), that the sow had 'full tits' (implying the cubs were still nursing because the sow was still producing milk), and that the cub's teeth did not appear to have accessed garbage.

The island is the perfect habitat and they feel no pressure from Grizzly Bears.  3) Hunters in BC kill something like 10,000 to 20,000 bears each year.  4) The cubs had been within one foot of a human and were not afraid.  A human had seen the cubs in the garbage.  Standard procedure in this case is to kill the bears, not to send them to the zoo.

The bears have broken into the caller's freezer, and have managed to grab garbage from inside the caller's home. The caller has tried to use fire crackers to scare the bears off, but they do not react to them. The bears have not been aggressive, but one of the cubs had come within a foot of the caller. The caller had followed the bears' path recently, and thinks that the bears' den is right behind the house.

Are you in cell service?  From: Mike Newton  To: Bryce Casavant  > Bryce that is old policy  Redraft is underway. In the meantime FLNRO biologist and Prov Vet make the call on the borderline/ questionable ones. These bears aren't a borderline call, so I'm afraid we are left with no other option.

Req'd for public safety and most humane for these bears in the long term. please update our NIZ group over the status of these cubs. NIZ CO's Dr Schwantje has assessed these garbage habituated cubs and they are to be euthanized asap > Bryce please reset the trap at this location immediately and provide updates as appropriate to your team so that we can respond as necessary over the next few days while you are tied up with fire call. > Thx Mike  From: Bryce Casavant  To: Mike Newton  > My assessment at this time based on witness statements, health of cubs, full tits on mother, teeth of cubs, and age is that the cubs have not accessed garbage at this time. > Furthermore, within the conflict matrix they have not posed a risk to public safety at this time and donot fall within the destruction category. The First Nations on scene are very concerned as is the fire department and adverse public image is a high risk for the province. My primary mandate is public safety and the immediate threat has been removed (ie. the sow). My duties as a law enforcement officer do not include the needless destruction of a baby animal that can be rehabilitated. If a provincial vet would like to do a full health and behavioural assessment for potential euthanization at a later time then that is the call of an informed decision maker who is a qualified veterinarian and will abide by zoology best practices for the destruction of an animal.  From: Mike Newton  To: Bryce Casavant  > Bryce I just left you a message. You are removed from this HWCR effective immediately. Please arrange immediate transfer of these bears to CO Gudbranson. They need to be stored in a cool dark place with access to water until that transfer occurs. Overnight in warehouse is ok. Or, if you are on the road already, stop in Campbell River and contact CO Gudbranson and arrange transfer. You do not have the authorization needed to transport those bears to Rehab center/ Errington. Thanks very much, Mike  From: Bryce.Casavant@gov.bc.ca  To: Mike.C.Newton@gov.bc.ca  > I will be maintaining carriage of this file until this situation is resolved. The final result and my decision may be reviewed by management after with union representation. At this time I am operating within the full scope of my authorities and appointments. No NIZ officer is to obstruct me in the lawful execution of my duties. The cubs have received full medical attention by a veterinarian for health and assessment of their diet to date. They have not accessed unnatural food at this time. They will be transported in accordance with provincial policy for a follow up medical assessment and behavioural assessment to determine if they are rehabilitation candidates. Bryce."
vancouver,3cu11x,caffienated_buddy,-1,Sat Jul 11 08:20:45 2015 UTC,"As someone with a Natural Resources Conservation Degree and working as a wildlife biologist, it appears that the general public have a hard time understanding the issue of wildlife overpopulation in the context of public safety. Nor does it appear that the public have a good understanding of the highly expensive and the statistically low survival rate of rehabilitated cubs reintroduced into the wild.   I just know someone is going to make the argument of: ""Oh well people are overpopulated, should we kill them?!""   If you truly think that the above argument has legs to stand on, then I am happy that you are not in charge of making policy.   If you believe that the value of an animal's life is higher than that of a human, then I am extremely happy that you are not in charge of making policy.   If you believe that bears habituated to humans are harmless, then it's probably because you live in the city.   Some people are making the argument that these cubs are not habituated to humans.   Would you want to take that chance? If the same cubs grew into predatory bears that attack residents, are you going to blame the residents for ""invading their territory""? ""That it's people's fault for living near wildlife?   It must be really easy for a lot of people to say that and live in a city that was constructed over prime wild lands long ago by their forefathers.   Would you rather the government spend thousands of dollars rehabilitating black bear cubs or towards conservation efforts of endangered reptiles in BC? - Because that is the reality. Budgets are limited and money needs to be spent wisely."
vancouver,3cu11x,a7neu,3,Sat Jul 11 03:24:42 2015 UTC,"I know they aren't threatened by any means, but are black bears overpopulated?  Black bear attacks are really rare, despite the fact that they live and in highly populated areas. I agree that they might be habituated, and may remember to look for food near humans when released, especially if they get hungry. But using the risk of them turning predatory as an argument against rehab seems to be scarmongering to me.  No government money is going into their rehabilitation. They are at a wildlife rescue that runs on private donations."
vancouver,3cu11x,caffienated_buddy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:02:20 2015 UTC,"You would have to argue and prove that the risk of rehabilitated bears becoming habituated and thus dangerous is unlikely enough. Unfortunately, there isn't much information and research to warrant that.  It is basic ecological knowledge that if a habitat is not able to sustain a population, then individuals will die from starvation or disperse into other habitats.  If the cubs are reintroduced into the same area with an abundance of black bears already, then I believe that they will succumb to those options. With this reasoning, I believe that it is not scaremongering to believe that these cubs may scavenge towards human settlement again.   As well, research does show that rehabilitated bears have a low survival rate following a year of their release.  http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/wildlife/faq/bearcubs.html#8  But, if the cubs are rehabilitated on private donations and released into a low risk area, then by all means. I Just have qualms on usingtaxpayers dollers and calling it conservation. It is not conservation.  edit a study detailing in the instances of predatory bear behaviour. Though rare, it happens.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/a-few-surprises-in-decades-long-black-bear-study/article579472/  edit 2  The rarity of fatal black bear attacks could be attributed to CO's eliminating upwards to a thousand high risk bears each year."

The COs would destroy them if they came back to human habitation for food, like they would with any bear. Considering the rarity of black bear attacks using this system (wait till an offense, then kill), I think it is scaremongering to list predatory attacks as a reason for destroying them."
vancouver,3cu11x,VR_22,2,Sat Jul 11 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, so many armchair quarterbacks recently.  Apparently the people of BC know more than the senior level management about fire fighting and bear cubs.   Now if only we could get a fraction of this level of engagement on issues where public input is actually being requested like the trade-offs associated with LNG.  This story is really about unions and how a front-line employee can disregard all policy, disobey orders and still get fully paid."
vancouver,3cu11x,a7neu,-2,Sat Jul 11 07:13:03 2015 UTC,"Just because the cubs were not eating the garbage does not mean they weren't habituated to some degree. Baby animals are programmed to learn from their parents. These ones saw the mother scrounge around and break into a home for food. The CO manager isn't unreasonable for thinking these bears are at an above-average risk for targeting human habitation for food as adults.  Also, the cubs were 5 months old, it's reasonable to think they would have nibbled some solids."

Rather, I was trying to discourage people from shitting all over his superior who is also a Conservation Officer and has no doubt been one longer than he has (as an aside, here's a story of the superior officer relocating a cougar).  Again, I'm not against saving the bears but people who are talking like the superior CO who wanted the bears put down is a vicious bureaucrat who has no idea what he's talking about, when according to the report these cubs came within 1 ft of a resident and were around their mother when she was breaking into human habitation for food. I read that bears are weaned from ages 6-8 months but weaning is a gradual process and these guys were 5 months old, so I don't think it's unreasonable that they would have eaten some solids even if they were primarily nursing (disagree with me there all you want, it's just speculation on my part).    I think people are being really arrogant when they act like they KNOW who made the right choice in a dispute between two guys who manage wildlife for a living. Especially when they so vehemently side with the guy who is probably less experienced.  I mean, the top comment is calling the superior CO ""unqualified.""

It is your subjective opinion to a public response.   ""Water shaming"" isn't a unique term created by reddit. Nor is ""drought panic"" [1] Water shaming via google trends dates back to 2011 confining the search results back to that link mostly to blog articles from Korea, parts of Africa and of course, California. Pushing into 2012 and still no results returned from reddit.  ""Drought panic"" returns even more convoluted results and isn't quantifiable by google trends. Specifying reddit with the term to google only returns one response from /r/vancouver, but strangely the phrase is nowhere to be found.   I broke all this out so if anyone bothers they can find an itemized breakdown of you being a general ass hat. Further more I wanted to give some citations to beef up /u/vel0bl0b s response. Of course you're exaggerating your own claims and being otherwise an insufferable prick because...no one cares why  What you claim to be ""water shaming"" is a public response to a perceived violation of water restrictions. Good on Canadians for being a rule abiding group and making sure others follow the structure. As to ""drought panic"" to the best I can understand is folded into a reasonable public concern with the numerous wildfires recently on going and the threat they pose to the territory in tandem with the drought conditions.  [1] After repeated iterations of this search term, I found few examples of it being used. Arguably a drought is a reason to panic."

Two bedrooms are getting crazy expensive, and three bedrooms are like unicorns. One bedrooms are everywhere but good luck getting a landlord to rent one to you if you have kids. Just a quick browse of Vancouver airbnb listings makes it pretty obvious that the small suite rental market is being affected.  However, it would  be a shame to see it regulated out of existence. I like having tourists in the neighbourhood, they add interest and it makes me feel more connected to the world, in a way. I also suspect that there is an unmeasurable but potentially large benefit to small businesses outside downtown from these listings, a lot of tourists probably end up eating and shopping at places they'd never find if they were stuck staying in hotels."
vancouver,3csy1r,albinocastro,8,Fri Jul 10 16:53:30 2015 UTC,There are at least 3 entire unit Air BnBs in the building I own my condo in. Starta tries to shut them down but all they can do is fine them and complain to the city who doesn't enforce their bylaws. We are worried about insurance implications - all of these units would be filled with renters if they weren't Air BnBs. The owners have said as much but they make more $$ via Air BnB.
vancouver,3csy1r,orisonofjmo,2,Fri Jul 10 20:23:04 2015 UTC,What insurance implications are you worried about may I ask?
vancouver,3csy1r,GoodGuyGinger,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:12:55 2015 UTC,"Sure. Let's say there is a fire or a flood set by an Air BnB guest in your apartment.   You don't have permission for a short term rental, you don't have a license to run an Air BnB. The strata's insurance company investigates, and deems an illegal business was operating out of that department, potentially denies the insurance claim. Suddenly, the strata corp is responsible for recouping costs for repairs. Sure, you can sue the unit owner. But what if they don't have any assets other than the now badly damaged unit? That may not cover costs of repairs plus now you have legal fees.   This is the exact reason why our strata (and many others) have officially banned whole unit Air BnBs."

vancouver,3csy1r,shesallover,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:11:04 2015 UTC,"There are bylaws against short term rentals unless you have a permit to run a hotel or BnB. Air BnBs play against the rules that small business owners (BnB owners for example) have been trying to play for years.   Plus a violation of bylaws means that insurance policies could be denied, especially if the insurance company can prove strata was aware of the violation."
vancouver,3csy1r,orisonofjmo,-3,Mon Jul 13 21:48:26 2015 UTC,There are more listings on just Craigslist right now than there are on Airbnb. It is a tiny fraction of the market. Banning every rental and restoring them all to long term would not even provide two days of extra stock.

The strata recovers damages from the owner, and the owner then recovers damages from the tenant (or from Airbnb if their policy pays out). Why would the average short-term tenant be a greater liability risk than the average mid- or long-term tenant? It's not like Walt and Jesse are renting condo suites for the weekend to run their meth cooks."
vancouver,3csy1r,badr3plicant,17,Fri Jul 10 21:59:54 2015 UTC,"The strata recovers damages from the owner, and the owner then recovers damages from the tenant (or from Airbnb if their policy pays out)   This simple sentence could be a multi-year legal battle among many parties.  Things like water damage can effect multiple units and get ugly in a hurry.  The pleasures of shared living."
vancouver,3csy1r,EastVan66,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"If the owner has sufficient assets to cover the damages. If they don't, strata can sue all they want but it's impossible to recoup money even through the legal system that someone doesn't have."
vancouver,3csy1r,orisonofjmo,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:46:24 2015 UTC,"It can certainly be complicated, but it's not any more complicated for a tenant staying two days than a tenant staying two months."
vancouver,3csy1r,badr3plicant,4,Sat Jul 11 00:35:09 2015 UTC,"I own an Airbnb suite that was recently water damaged. I had contractors in and repairs completed within a week rather than wait for the strata to get 3 quotes and send in their own contractors. The unit below me was only getting its floors finished 7 weeks after the inital damages. Airbnb hosts have a vested interest in making sure things run smoothly and making sure that their place is looked after and always in pristine condition.   Compared to a place that is rented out long term to students and not maintained for that entire year an Airbnb apartment is kept in infinetly better condition because you will be punished in reviews if you allow standards to slip.   Before Airbnb i had repeated issues with tenants not paying rent, tenants throwing parties every weekend, tenants subletting rooms to ease the cost of rent and so on. With Airbnb I have none of those issues and if i did get a bad tenant he would be gone within the week.. A much better scenario than months of court dates and eviction notices to remove a long term problem tenant.   For insurance I have liability insurance and full coverage for any damage caused by my suite in addition to the Airbnb guarantee of $1m"
vancouver,3csy1r,Secrets7,2,Sat Jul 11 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, did the tenants have anything to do with the water damage?"
vancouver,3csy1r,badr3plicant,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:01:43 2015 UTC,"No, it was from a unit above me which had 5 students who overstuffed a washing machine with a duvet and then went out. The machine filled, overflowed and then kept flowing."
vancouver,3csy1r,Secrets7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:23:30 2015 UTC,Right and this is an entirely different situation to damages caused by an Air BnB guest that might invalidate your strata's insurance policies.
vancouver,3csy1r,orisonofjmo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:46:52 2015 UTC,Do you think Strata insurance policies set limits on the type of person who may rent an apartment or the time duration of such a rental?   (For the record I am on my strata council and they do not)
vancouver,3csy1r,Secrets7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:38:43 2015 UTC,"No but insurance companies will not want to pay out on a claim that was the result of illegal activity.   Our strata looked into it with their insurer and found that if an illegal hotel guest caused excessive damage to common property, one or more insurance policies involved (the unit owners, or the strata corp's) may not pay out due to the damage being caused by an illegal activity."

vancouver,3csy1r,JustinThrewDough,4,Fri Jul 10 18:39:41 2015 UTC,Depends on how much the hotel industry wants to bribe our city counsellors and our mayor. Then they will do something about Airbnb for  sure.  Worked for the taxi industry against uber!
vancouver,3csy1r,Weirdmantis,8,Fri Jul 10 18:42:48 2015 UTC,"With new business models comes with two things: eroding of existing businesses and birth of opportunities. Much like Uber, Airbnb doesn't play by the traditional rules and undercuts existing monopolies because of it (less associated overhead costs). People naturally want better prices, so they would obviously gravitate towards a new business model that's cheaper for them.  It'll be interesting whether or not the city will favour a laissez faire approach to Airbnb in the end. Change isn't necessarily a bad thing (e.g.  Netflix, Spotify, Steam, etc) - as economic stagnation can stem from a lack of innovation or when businesses become too big for new enterprises to spring forth.   If Airbnb is here to stay, we as a society will have to adapt - in other words, people may need to migrate to some other place cheaper to live; much like how Europeans left Europe to go to the New World to find a better place to live and for opportunities. I know it's not a popular idea thrown around, but there has been no other place in time where you can relocate to another place as easily as you can today."
vancouver,3csy1r,MeteoraGB,10,Sat Jul 11 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"The problem with both airbnb and Uber is that they are skirting existing regulations and laws, while hiding behind the idea that they are ""just an online information hub, not the service provider""."
vancouver,3csy1r,EastVan66,2,Fri Jul 10 18:02:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't disagree with you at all. I don't like Uber's corporate policies and even though people like to champion Uber, the fact that they can skirt existing regulations is unfair to existing business that play by the rules.  People may argue its anti-competitive to try and regulate and rein in Uber, but its also pretty anti-competitive to not obey the rules."
vancouver,3csy1r,MeteoraGB,4,Fri Jul 10 18:44:31 2015 UTC,"Uber does indeed flout existing regulations, because the regulations are a product of corrupt backroom dealing between taxi license holders and city politicians. It's the same story all over the world: artificially constrain supply and sell the licenses to your friends. Or sell them on the open market for the absolute maximum the market is willing to bear - the level at which taxi drivers can just barely eke out a living. This is the business model that cities all over the world are fighting so hard to protect."
vancouver,3csy1r,badr3plicant,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"if uber isn't obeying the roles, why don't the taxi companies ignore the rules as well since uber is exempt from the rules? When the city cracks down the taxi firms can sue for selective reinforcement and be reimbursed for lost revenue, which can be an arbitrarily high amount."
vancouver,3csy1r,foodtyrant,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:15:49 2015 UTC,Beats me. I think the government can just revoke their license. The government hasn't really doe anything in regards to uber in terms of regulation.
vancouver,3csy1r,MeteoraGB,11,Fri Jul 10 20:26:46 2015 UTC,Uber and AirBNB are just the tip of the iceberg regarding the new digital economy.  I have my doubts whether our governments are nimble enough to keep up.  At least more people will come (and spend money in our city) when they don't have to pay extortionate hotel rates.
vancouver,3csy1r,pm_me_yr_taint,17,Fri Jul 10 20:56:20 2015 UTC,You do understand paying for a hotel is also money that goes to the local economy.
vancouver,3csy1r,emthree,16,Fri Jul 10 16:20:42 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but they pay Hotel Tax which goes directly to the City to pay for services."
vancouver,3csy1r,piltdownman7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:41:04 2015 UTC,Yes as current trends continue government will have to get more inventive regarding revenue streams.  Property taxes are one obvious answer.

With a quick google search, you'll see many people either acting similarly to the article, or contemplating doing so, and while it may be more convenient to own/airbnb a property in the city that you live in, there isn't a huge barrier running this sort of operation in another city."

In the states it's already a big problem in high demand regions, why would anybody rent out their place to residents for a couple grand a month when they could be renting it to tourists for >$100/daily?  Quick money for homeowners, even worse environment for young people and working class looking for a place to live."
vancouver,3csy1r,TraumaSaurus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"Because of the effort required to do so. Cleaning, meeting guests, maintenance etc. Its way more effort than most people have time for to coordinate an airbnb.   The number of units taken out of the market is miniscule in relation to the overall rental market. Less than .2% if you factor 3000 Airbnb listings against the number of rental homes in Vancouver. When you account for the number of those listings that are rooms or just rented out while the owners are on vacation it becomes far far less."

A not insignificant share of the AirBnB stock isn't going to ever end up on the rental market at all.    Let's work ourselves into a lather about things that have the scale to matter"

vancouver,3cuurg,SirToxalot,8,Sat Jul 11 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately for your desire to see them go under, that might not happen. Consider their business decisions:   They partnered with YVR to build the mall on YVR land. They more than likely share profits, which means YVR has no qualms about passengers getting stuck in mall traffic. For YVR, if you don't wanna be late, leave your house earlier. As well, Opening week and Boxing Day will be the only two busy blips on the calendar year. The rest should be regular traffic. They have PRIME location. They're in between two major cities, with a Skytrain station right outside for easy access. You can't get better service than that. They're designed to cater to the travelling population. Being only three Skytrain stations away from YVR, rich foreigners on long layovers can go out and spend a quick buck at the mall, without having to worry about catching a taxi. The customers they cater to, foreigners with huge spending budgets, live in the same two cities they're sandwiched by.   I'd say they hit the jackpot business wise. The only design error they made is it's an OUTDOOR MALL. In a city where it rains for the majority of the year, that wasn't the best decision."

Check out http://pacificropes.com/sprat-training/ There are many options for SPRAT, just look around.

Here is a few I can think of off the top of my head: http://pacificskyservices.com/ http://skywalkerhighrise.com/ http://seymoursky.com/  Keep in mind, similar to rock climbing, you are expected to have and maintain your own gear.

For example the first person I saw was really into wellness, diet, meditation and stuff like that. It didn't fit with me personally (I saw him regularly for a few months). It helped but not as much as I hoped.   I tried a new person recently when I started suffering from depression/anxiety and after one session I knew that this was the person. It was more of a, ""alright, let's sit down make a short, medium and long term plan with the steps you need to follow"", which is more my style.   Most counselor/therapists/psychologists will be very sensitive to LGBT issues I imagine. I also think that QMUNITY (on Davie and Bute) would be very helpful in finding a person specialized in LGBT issues (http://qmunity.ca/)"

If you want to blend in as a Vancouverite quickly, this place is a good source for waterproof/breathable jackets and shoes.  And shorts.  And shirts.  And socks.  And backpacks.  And bicycles.  And accessories.  And tents.  And water bottles.  It's a local ""store"" that's membership based ($5 for a lifetime) and their stuff is generally good and well-priced and the staff is generally knowledgable.  You probably already know Vancouver is an ""outdoor activity"" sort of town and MEC is the anchor when it comes to buying gear. There is more fashionable stuff, maybe, in Arc'teryx or North Face and Lululemon, but those stores are all close by also.  Anyways, stop in there and absorb some Vancouver outdoor-gear-buying culture, even if you don't buy anything.  They also have a good bulletin board near the cash registers where people post buy/sell ads for bikes and gear and other random things.  Welcome!!"
vancouver,3cv74w,RainbowNowOpen,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"While MEC has some nice stuff, it's extremely overpriced especially for what the average person uses their stuff for day to day.  MEC is for people who think they are bear grylls but use jackets rated for Mt Everest to walk to their dogs in the park, or if they feel really adventurous a ""hike"" up Quarry rock in Deep Cove. (For OP, Quarry rock is a very short easy hike that people love to post all over facebook to make it seem like they are outdoorsy)  Jacket? Maybe get from MEC. They are good quality, but can be expensive. If you can go to an outlet across the border (in Tulalip), you can get a much cheaper North Face jacket. I got one for $99 down from $400. You can also try on jackets in stores and order one off the internet to save money. If money isn't an issue, you should just get a light lower end MEC jacket.   Shoes? Please please do not get shoes from MEC. They are extremely ugly and too many people in Vancouver think its alright to wear hiking/hybrid shoes around the city. For hiking (actual hiking outside the city), shoes would be good from MEC.  Socks? No need to overpay for socks. Get them from costco.   Vancouver is an outdoor city. However, far too many people try to play the extreme end of the outdoorsy role when in reality they go on the occasional hike. In other words, Vancouver is full of outdoorsy posers. Beyond a waterproof jacket, you should not be walking around day to day looking like you are hiking. You can enjoy the nature here without slapping a label on your head that says ""MEC. I love hiking""  Bike? There is an abundance of fairly priced used roadbikes on craigslist. Just use some common sense, and most likely you won't be buying a stolen bike. I got a nice vintage road bike for <$150. Most people bike between June and September. Some basic bike etiquette includes: Not biking on busy roads (unless theres a dedicated lane), sticking to bike routes, stopping at stop signs, not running red lights, not cutting off cars or pedestrians, no formula 1 racing around the Seawall, avoid tight spandex if you can  Above all, enjoy Vancouver!"

vancouver,3cr2c1,Chris266,0,Fri Jul 10 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"Well, they have a regular size and small size that are 2-3 bucks different. You definitely get a lot with the large. Personally I'm full on a regular. That said, I usually get a samosa with it as well and I'm not a huge guy. Its all really tasty though.  I used to live right by Crave India and went there all the time. That is until one time I was chewing my nan and I bit right into what I can only guess was a rock in the nan! What I think may have happened is that since they make the nan by sticking it to the oven wall, a part of the oven wall may have chipped off from years of use and went into the nan. Luckily I didn't break my tooth on it. Unfortunately, since that happened I have been kind of afraid to eat the nan there.

Of course, in that situation I'd just take the lane behind the right turner, but if there's a bunch of cars turning right, I'd consider it. The best strategy probably depends on the intersection design.  ETA: the other advantage of shoaling is left turns on commuter cycles, if you're not Five and Dime enough to take a left turn with cars. You shoal up, dismount, and cross like a pedestrian.

BC has around $8,400 of net debt per capita, while Quebec has around $22,000.   There's no doubt that there are serious problems with childcare costs in this province, but this won't fix much.

This plan was estimated to cost BC  $2Bn/yr+ in highly optimal Peter Pan scenarios. Out of the CCCABC's/HELP (provincial lobbies) own mouths:  http://earlylearning.ubc.ca/media/publications/15by15-full-report.pdf    Access to a full or part time program for 90% of children aged 3–5 and about three-quarters of children under 3 (following a significantly expanded parental leave program). ECE wages at an average of $25/hour plus benefits and additional funding to include children with extra support needs and children from low income, immigrant or other families facing social or cultural barriers. The full cost of this Plan would be somewhat higher to cover the costs of services for children aged 6–12.    They will heavily unionize and we don't need another group of people that hold children hostage every year for grossly excessive pay/benefit completely devoid of economic reality in a ZIRP/QE economy.   Off their own site:   ""8. What about unions?  We support unionization as an important strategy for advancing the sector. Currently a number of different unions represent some BC early childhood educators, and all teachers and classroom-based school staff are represented by one of two unions. We also support the democratic right of workers to unionize and choose which union can best represent them.""   Sorry, but we can't afford afford this, we are slightly above stagnation at best even with ZIRP and not counting the oil price shocks earlier this year. You aren't entitled to a career, quality of life, AND children in a globalized  modern day society with a highly saturated labor pool.  The only way this would have been feasible was to embrace nationalism in the 80's, adopt natalist policy favoring Canadian birth rates (we have a pathetic sub-replacement rate of 1.61 births per woman 2012 TFR even with immigration), and halt immigration (to prevent labor pool saturation). It's too late for that now so just sit back and enjoy the rapid decline and fall of the West.   If we keep pushing for myopic shit like this we are going to collapse as a resource exporting welfare state by 2 windows:   2015-2018 ZIRP, interest rate adjustments from the States, and equity/real estate bubble issues ~2029-2032 Boomer Bomb and immigration demographic collapse.

vancouver,3ctzh9,Enginerd_42,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who works for Impark once told me about the follow and I find it reasonable. So I am just sharing for you to make your decision of paying or not.  I heard Impark usually won't take actions unless you have more than 3 tickets. They will just keep trying to ask you for money until you contact them or paid them. Yet, if that 3 tickets or less are extended over time without payments, they will put the licence plate on file and that's when you need to 1) change your plate or 2)Don't park at the lot (yet you can park at other lots since your plate is only on the tow list on that specific lot).  So if you don't really need to go back to that parking lot, probably you don't need to pay it, and otherwise be careful of the car being tow if you didnt change your plate.  And last, City collection is part of Impark. However, city collection is also its department to follow outstanding tickets to real collections, which then it would affect the credit of the driver. Yet, that probably wouldn't happen until you accumulated 5 or more tickets. Reason being is they need to split the revenue between Impark and the real collector, Impark doesn't want to do the extra work and have only get a little back. So they are likely to let few tickets go, but if it accumulated, take your own risk.  Hope it helps."

Traffic will calm down a bit as the place becomes normal, but they certainly should have not included as much of a parking crater as they did with the skytrain station onsite ( nearly half a kilometer walk, but , YVR originally wanted to put it on the south side of the island where you couldn't take the train there at all, which the city talked them out of.)"

At some point the planning profession needs to be accountable to their professional organization. From all I can see, they never hold a planning professional accountable for negligent practice. The MCIP letters after their name are laughable if there is no accountability in their practice.   Either YVR has staff planners (who should be held accountable) or they hired consultants (who should be held accountable). However, this goes down as a very significant fail of a project. For that, there needs to be a way for YVR to be held accountable."

There was a really good direction for the video but it just never got off Water St. If I could make a few suggestions they would be to first of all really explore some of the neighbourhood and diversify some of the content, I know for a fact there's a ton more dynamic material down there. Crab park, Waterfront, the Cambie patio, even the No.5 is possibly included! You could even blend Railtown in and I doubt anyone would complain. Also relax on some of the 'effects' like the reversals. It's a great start and a cool idea. I'd like to see more of these for different neighbourhoods."

Try cutting in some wide angle shots between a series of tighter shots. I know you're probably going for the shaky hand-held effect, but your shots are way too shaky. If you can't fashion a homemade steady cam, it helps to stand with your legs apart, rest the camera against your body, and relax your breathing.

vancouver,3cpc7i,grandwahs,7,Thu Jul 9 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"This is how I understand the situation:  Those low-income apartments are managed by a property management firm on behalf of the owner/developer. In order to have these developments approve by the city, the requirement was that a certain number of rentals were to be rented at below-market to appeal to low-income.  These low-income people are just regular, everyday people who sign tenancy agreements likes everyone else. So, under the RTA there is no provision for these people to be in some type of treatment/have support/etc.   Now, if these was a rehab facility type thing...that would be different.   If I have a tenant that moves into one of my units...and he turns out to be a crack head, I can't kick him out for being a crack head. This is the issue...at least from what I can tell.  Basically, 200 units (not a real number, just an example) have been rented to people on social assistance (welfare) so their rent is guaranteed. If the rent is paid, it is VERY HARD to have someone evicted PLUS all these people have these fucking advocacy groups to support the should they receive an eviction letter.   I am dealing with this right now...tenant on welfare stops paying rent, fucks up the apartment, I take her to arbitration and she has some fucking advocacy group representing her like I'M the bad person.   Th only requirement I can have is pay rent, don't disturb people, don't damage shit, and don't smoke, etc. I can't require someone to have a councilor."

The Water Restriction bylaws are a result of an agreement between municipalities to put in place local bylaws in each respective city.  However, UBC as its own municipality does not have any bylaws at all, nor a bylaw officer. The campus is therefore not subject to the water restrictions.

Those trees do look young and do need water, but there are far more efficient and cost effective ways to do that, like water bags.

vancouver,3clvei,tvorm,2,Thu Jul 9 04:32:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the farms actually help our economy. The grass is a waste. It takes more water per year to have a lawn than a pool where I am in California. They've only just started having limits on how often you can water, and people still do it daily. It is an actual problem. We have a high population and that number adds up quick. Just my two cents."
vancouver,3clvei,WugOverlord,2,Thu Jul 9 06:25:27 2015 UTC,"True, but it was never a good idea to subsidize farms in such an arid environment anyway. At market prices, there would be a lot less water consumed by agriculture.   Unfortunately, the farm lobby is much more powerful than the suburban homeowner lobby, so you'll always see the little guy bearing the burden of water reduction. Look at the water consumption numbers yourself, and decide whether its worthwhile getting worked up over sprinklers."
vancouver,3clvei,MeteoraGB,2,Thu Jul 9 08:51:48 2015 UTC,"We need to make money and produce food. The ""little guy"" doesn't need a green lawn.

Nobody is saying ""have dirt for your front lawn,"" they're just saying ""holy shit that's a lot of water to use on an empty patch of lawn for something that's not sustainable in this environment."" I have looked at the numbers, we are actually forced to in high school because it's a major issue. And, again, it would use less water to have a POOL on the equivalent land.   20% of our water use is the ""little guys,"" if we can cut it in half that's an AMAZING amount of water saved. Obviously the agricultural sector needs to do their part too, but we also need money and jobs and food. California produces a silly amount of food for the country. We can't just be like ""we know food is a needed resource and brings in money for the area, but we need to remove it."" They can improve it, use better irrigation, water at smarter times, ect. But don't underplay the importance of agriculture in California.   It's easy to look at the biggest amount of water being used and say ""blame them,"" but that is ignoring the function of the water. Is it being used to produce avocados, cherries, nuts, oranges, lemons? Or is it to water useless grass so someone can keep up the vain ""green golfer lawn"" that is fashionable and a symbol of wealth? Think about it."

If you're just asking about that picture, I'm actually probably wrong. Soil erosion can't really happen if there's no slope. The water will just sit on the dirt/grass and the mineral/nutrients will probably return to the soil. Still, pisses me off to see soil being drowned with water like that not only because its incredibly inefficient and wasteful, but the grass probably doesn't need that much water (I personally never water my lawn so I wouldn't know).  If you're talking about water usage in Vancouver - then in my opinion we have a tendency have a lavish and excessive use of water. Can't really fault the people, we have so much water we take it for granted and water meters were not required for buildings until recently - which are only applicable to renovating houses and newly built ones.

vancouver,3crsjq,carnifex2005,2,Fri Jul 10 10:00:11 2015 UTC,"If you want to see the shops... they are both almost identical. They both have the same night market types of shops selling roughly the same things, in some cases people pay for a spot in both markets and divide their stuff between the two (was talking to one vendor about this last time I went down). The only difference in shops is the number of vendors is larger in the newer market, compared to the older one.   When it comes to food, they both have a wide variety, but obviously the new night market (New one is the one you pay for, old one is free) has more selection. That said, many things at the new night market have lines, and you can end up stuck in a line for quite a while sometimes.  If you are bringing people from away and just want the culture shock value of a Vancouver night market, take them to the newer, larger one. It's flashier, busier, and more impressive visually.   If you just want to go to a night market, buy some quick food, and wander for a bit, and then get out then go to the older, smaller one. It's still a bigger ""asian style"" night market than most cities in north america, but much smaller than the new one."

vancouver,3co4gt,proudbedwetter,3,Thu Jul 9 23:17:32 2015 UTC,"Let me try to explain why prices can't go up forever. It has everything to do with the income that you can generate from the property.  Today, property in Vancouver generates 80% less income than it needs to in order to be a ""break even"" investment. In other words, when you add in taxes, repairs, and other costs associated with having a real estate biz, landlords are losing lots of money right now.  If prices go up even more, they will become even more unhinged from profits. Eventually, the gap will become so large that nobody will want to invest anymore. That can and will pretty quickly trigger a collapse as investors seek to cut their losses through a quick sale to a market that will become increasingly pessimistic.  Another way of looking at it is this: assume that rents go up with wages. People, after all, don't magically have more money each year to spend on rent. So rent is necessarily hooked up to wages.  Now assume prices go up much faster than rents. That is what has happened in Vancouver since 2001. Eventually, the price of property is so disconnected from the rent you can earn from it that even the most bullish investor doesn't have the cash.  At 20% per year price growth, vs. 1% per year rent growth, it doesn't take long for the show to stop."

vancouver,3co4gt,rainman_104,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"Just because it was a good idea in 2005, doesn't mean it's a good idea now, no matter how many years the market has been growing for. The fallacy of hindsight is one of the reasons why irrational markets continue to grow at an apparently irrational rate. In fact, the longer a market remains irrational, the more likely it is that investors will consider it a good bet for further growth.  In 2008, the Vancouver market stopped like a watch. Literally within a few days of May 1st 2008, inventories started building inexorably. Sales halted. Price correction was immediate (if you wanted your house to actually sell), and some over-leveraged people started to lose their shirts. In 1982 the fall was sharper.  The Canadian housing market - and that includes boring places like Flin Flon and Medicine Hat - is more than 80% over-valued relative to rents. That's the worst in the world - worse than Hong Kong.  We can't know when it's going to correct, but the longer it goes up, the harder the correction will be.  If you want to predict the timing of the fall, keep an eye on housing starts and sales inventory. High starts is a good predictor of future price increases; high inventory is a predictor of price falls. At the current time, starts are healthy and inventory is small. So will it burst this summer? Unlikely. But if China's stock market keeps tanking, who knows.."
vancouver,3co4gt,ttul,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:18:04 2015 UTC,"But if China's stock market keeps tanking, who knows..   That's the wildcard here, where we'll find out how much effect chinese buyers really have had on the local real estate market.  Personally I think the real effect on real estate here has been buyers willingness to live in condos.    Consumer tastes have forever altered demand curves.  20 years ago, condos were for poor people.   Poco was called Pocompton because it was such a shithole.   Steveston?  Who the fuck wants to live there in an earthquake zone?  Things have changed in this city for better or worse, and as one economist put it, you always have to account for changing tastes.    I think we may see a pullback, the question is to what levels?  2001?  2005?   1992?    IDK."

vancouver,3crzbw,Baniita,2,Fri Jul 10 08:11:24 2015 UTC,"If you really want to go through the QA route, the best course of action is to apply at a studio to get some game tester experience. A lot of studios in Vancouver look for game testers on a contract basis, you learn a bit more about the industry, and get to make some connections.   VMC (EA), United Front Games, and Hot Head all hire people based on contracts. The only one that I know of that could have any long term contracts is VMC at EA.

vancouver,3crzbw,AdiposeFin,2,Wed Jul 15 07:50:55 2015 UTC,"I work in the games industry, and it's great that you want to join it.  First of all, you need to get a clearer understanding of the roles in games. It's not 100% clear to me the kind of career you want. I don't understand the point about Japan at all, either.   Do you want to do the model and texture work, or possibly the animation around making a character? If so you want to be an artist or an animator, and you will very likely need to go learn how to do that in a school, and you will need to have a good portfolio.   Or did you mean a design style job? One where you are giving the character attributes in the game world, and working on the things that make it fun to play? If that's the case you can go to school at one of the local private schools. It's expensive, but they are established enough that we are hiring grads, plus the instructors are often well connected to the industry, and they can provide a decent referral into the local studios.   You can of course try and learn this all on your own. There are examples of the self taught genius, but usually the best people I've worked with came from environments where they could learn from experts.   Now for QA. QA depends on your ability to thoroughly test based on your assignments, and on communication skill, especially written. There are companies that hire large numbers of temporary staff, and that can be an opportunity to get experience, although if your goal is to gain exposure to developers, locking in a job at a smaller studio will usually provide more contact with the development team.  An important tip for interviewing: most studios aren't specifically looking for QA staff to groom into other roles, and the hiring manager is going to be looking primarily for people he thinks are going to do the job well. If you spend half the interview talking about breaking in to the industry and the other fields you want to work in, he might see you as a distraction or unfocused and pass. Take that viewpoint into the job too, and focus on being good at what you do, because it will earn you more credibility at work than simple enthusiasm.   Good luck OP!"
vancouver,3crzbw,am3ience,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"Basically, I want a job like Gen Kobayashi's... or Tetsuya Nomura (his character designing side, mostly, but I want to be able to model characters too). Or like the guy who designed the characters for the Devil Survivor games, or Dangan Ronpa games. Character designers in Japan are mostly key animators in the Japanese animation industry, or design for novels--but I'm hoping for the game design version; I don't think it has as much competition either. It's rather a niche job. I want to work in either Square Enix, ATLUS, or Nitro+. I know that 3D is the way to go, and the school I want to go to will teach that, but I actually prefer 2D. Or 2.5D, which is a kinda cool look for animation that the Japanese do... But there's no jobs for that kind of thing in Vancouver, not really, that I know of. Nomura started as a debugger, got into designing monsters, and then characters. He designed the characters for Final Fantasy VII, and partly for my favourite game, The World Ends With You.  I suppose I just thought debugging would be a lead. Thank you for the thoughtful reply! I'm rather lost and obviously don't know what I'm doing, so advice like that helps."

vancouver,3clgue,koncept61,5,Thu Jul 9 06:01:51 2015 UTC,People are happy because they are rooting for the CO. Usually when cops are suspended its because they are suspected of doing something awful.
vancouver,3clgue,a7neu,-7,Thu Jul 9 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"Rooting for him because it's a nice story... Yet if it turns out he went against policy then he was in the wrong just the same as a cop could be in the wrong.    Retired bear expert Barrie Gilbert says the uproar over the bear cubs who were almost shot in B.C. has more to do with ""heart strings"" than conservation.   He says black bears are far less threatened than Vancouver Island's elusive marmots.  ""My personal value system is I'd rather see people put their effort into threatened populations like your marmots on Vancouver Island ... [But] the heart strings are pulled when you are talking baby bears. I mean, what's more attractive?""   So if it turns out the suspension is justified are people going to froth at the mouth over how he was suspended with pay / on paid vacation?"
vancouver,3clgue,koncept61,7,Thu Jul 9 05:25:33 2015 UTC,"Policy =/= morality. That he went against policy is not under discussion. Rather, people feel that he made the morally correct, compassion choice in spite of shitty orders.  This has nothing to do with species endangerment. I agree VI marmots are a worthier cause but that's irrelevant to the issue at hand.  When we hear about cops suspended with pay, it's for doing something morally egregious, like drinking and driving, killing or beating a civilian without good cause etc. Hence why people do not want to see them suspended with pay."
vancouver,3clgue,a7neu,-6,Thu Jul 9 05:33:10 2015 UTC,"Regardless, if it turns out he was suspended with pay and his suspension was justified, he's in the same boat as officers suspended with pay.  You don't get to pick which one you like and which one you don't. It shows how fickle the masses are.

vancouver,3clgue,koncept61,3,Thu Jul 9 06:26:58 2015 UTC,Compassion is a good trait. Following orders blindly? ...eh not so highly prized. Possibly murdering people? Definitely looked down upon. Even if you don't share this viewpoint it should be easy to see that the contradiction in response that you see can be attributed to the actions of the CO rather than the simple fact that he is a CO.
vancouver,3clgue,a7neu,0,Thu Jul 9 07:08:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think people have a problem with cops being suspended with pay.

I hope we see more of that going forwards into more and longer droughts.

It's a municipal park, which means they can only water it on Wednesday mornings between 1:00 am and 6:00 am (its address is 450 Beach Ave, so it's an even-numbered address), not at 9:00 am on a Tuesday.

Yes, restrictions are necessary, but the reality is that grass isn't going away anytime soon and that it does need to be kept ""somewhat"" moist as to prevent a fire hazard.  Personally, I'm in Abbotsford where water is metered. We should be metering it EVERYWHERE and raising/tiering rates based on usage during drought periods.  But this whole pitchforks and torches mentality ubiquitous among the keyboard warriors on Facebook/Reddit/etc... has other negative consequences. This issue has sparked my neighbourhood's Facebook page to turn pretty much everyone against one another about many other petty bylaw violations.  If your neighbour is misusing water, then go fucking talk to them. I have great relationships with my immediate neighbours and have actually spoken about the water shortage. I actually got my nextdoor neighbour to cut back and water responsibly, i.e. by hand.  Governments also need to be putting appropriate incentives in place, especially if investments in water infrastructure are not keeping pace with population growth/needs. There needs to be more subsidies for water-efficient technologies... maybe even incentives for more ""eco-friendly"" lawns. If we're going to tar and feather anyone, it should be the BC Libs for being so clueless about this whole mess.  You know what, I like my lawn. I just spent 3K installing a new one in the house we just bought. We live in the middle of nowhere and it's nice for my kids to be able to play outside while we BBQ, etc... in the summer. I'm not opposed to seeding it with more eco-friendly seed, something that I just found out about TBH. I've dialed back on watering it though and am letting it overgrow to retain what moisture it does have. Whatever water I DO use, I pay for each month. Are lawns ""necessary?"" No, but we could go through anyone's home and find any number of things that are unnecessary, wasteful and harmful to the environment.  Does your neighbour have a green and perfectly manicured lawn? Are they being selfish assholes? Great, go talk to them before pointing fingers and starting a shittstorm."

We should be metering it EVERYWHERE and raising/tiering rates based on usage during drought periods.   Abbotsford gets this right.  Fruits and vegetables, fish, wood, minerals, and other resources we consume daily have their market price fluctuate by season and availability. Why not water?    I think it's harmful to insulate households from the true cost of water consumption.  I know family budgets probably can't take a huge variance month-to-month, but if a family chooses to live on a plot of land with an optional lawn that requires resources...  then build water consumption into the monthly cashflow and save up for those dry summer months!  It's not much different than high electric bills in summer because AC usage goes through the roof.  Anyways, kudos to Abbotsford for seeing water this way."

vancouver,3cjr20,MeteoraGB,22,Wed Jul 8 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"Like the HST referendum, the Transit referendum is purely about deflecting blame. Essentially they are spending millions of taxpayer's dollars to run the referendum so that the public won't blame the liberal government so that they can get re-elected during the next election.   That's all it is. 100%. They don't care about running the province, principle, justice, or facts. All they care about getting elected. That's scary."

I had less issues with repealing something through a referendum than trying to introduce a tax through one - though I'm biased because 12% on dining out rubbed me the wrong way when I also had to tip on top of that.  A proper referendum is the vote on SVT in BC as it would alter how our provincial elections play out, not some sham referendum that as you've said, deflects blame from the government. Unfortunately this political maneuver is thanks to how democracy works where short term gains (getting re-elected and show short term results) is more important than long term progress."

vancouver,3cjr20,biskelion,44,Wed Jul 8 19:53:40 2015 UTC,On the positive* side maybe this sets the precedent wherein if a city/community wants something expensive they should hold a plebiscite to raise local taxes to pay for it.  Small island ferry’s schedule getting cut and fares are going up? Hold a plebiscite to raise local taxes to subsidies it.  Bridge that connects your rural community condemned? Hold a plebiscite and pay for it yourselves.  Forest fires in your region and the government’s budget is running out to fight them? Better hurry up and raise your local PST.  *This is not actually positive and not how a civilized society should operate.

This whole debacle largely seems to be a rural urban divide. Precious flowers in suburbs and far flung BC don't like the idea of Greater Vancouver taking their hard earned money.

Jordan Bateman at the Taxpayers' Federation won this, and that's what he wants.  If No voters really want to send a message, they have to make the effort to send a message: pick up a pen (figuratively) and contact their MLA. Perhaps they think Translink isn't democratic enough. As a Yes voter, I agree! Perhaps they think this process wasn't democratic enough: elites tried to impose what they thought was best rather than listening to the needs and concerns of citizens. As a Yes voter, I agree!   But if that's the message they want to send  - indeed, regardless of the message they want to send, they need to realize that the message wasn't clear. If they don't clarify it, their vote will be appropriated for someone else's agenda. It's already happening.  Bluntly, if all someone does is mark an X in a box and figure someone will deliver the outcome they want, then in my opinion that person is both entitled and lazy.

Because there are six hundred thousand people here living and working in a comparatively dense urban environment and many many thousands more trying to get to work and school here from elsewhere every day.  Infrastructure in Vancouver serves the whole region, and certainly half the ridership on Broadway was expected to be people from beyond Vancouver City Limits, and given it's dense use, infrastructure in Vancouver is far, far more likely to pay it's way in use than infrastructure out into the burbs.  But hey, screw us right?     Prior to the Canada Line, most of the skytrain infrastructure hadn't even been built to serve many Vancouverites in the first place.  The lines went through industrial areas and through some low density residential areas as a means of ferrying people from Burnaby and Surrey to their jobs downtown."

They are increasing efficiency by removing stops and reducing service to less used routes, but this is going to mean that their bus system is going to be worse for a lot of people. This is not necessarily better. If you reduce service to lower demand areas, less people are going to be willing to use the bus resulting in more drivers.

vancouver,3cjr20,BelaBartok42,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:27:58 2015 UTC,"What? Why not?   Because it's a percentage based on land value, and land values are different here than in Miami.    Municipal budgets are not decided based on land value.   Land value is simply a function to provide the funds that municipalities need.   It's simply the way to divide the municipal budget up into the units it provides for.   Nothing more.    If property values in Vancouver cut in half tomorrow, rates would double it's as simple as that.     As a renter, I pay property taxes too you know, or did you think landlords just cover that expense out of altruism?   lol it's not quite so simple.    A landlord charges whatever the market comparables in the area are worth, and those prices by and large are driven by demand.  For example, if I have a unit to rent and I price it even $100 too high, I may end up with one month of vacancy.   That costs me  1/12th of the annual rent income.    Over a 5% increase in rent, it's not likely I can get away with that from the market.  Property taxes are a cost of doing business, nothing more.    Sometimes I absorb the costs, and sometimes I download them.   In all cases though, I will seek to maximize my rental income either way, be it property taxes or otherwise.

vancouver,3cjr20,BelaBartok42,0,Thu Jul 9 00:21:56 2015 UTC,You obviously don't understand how property tax is calculated. Go educate yourself before you continue displaying such ignorance.
vancouver,3cjr20,roadvage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"I'm just using info found on the relevant cities' websites, and using the total percentage. What would be a better method, since you seem to be quite knowledgeable on the matter?"
vancouver,3cjr20,BelaBartok42,0,Wed Jul 8 23:55:50 2015 UTC,"Property tax rate is arrived at by taking the municipal budget and dividing it by the total property value. Then each person pays their percentage of the total value in tax.  So if the budget is $1'000'000 and the total value of all property is  $1'000'000'000, and your house is worth $1000, you pay $1 in tax. So comparing % between cities is stupid because it's really just a factor of the housing market in those cities. Vancouver has a stupid expensive housing market. So the % for tax is lower. If the market nose-dives then the % goes up.  That way cities can plan. You shouldn't have different budgets based on an external factor like the housing market, what would you do in years that the market tanks? Fire everyone that works in the parks department?"
vancouver,3cjr20,roadvage,2,Wed Jul 8 23:59:53 2015 UTC,"So at no point ever can we compare tax rates in different municipalities, is that what you're saying? I put New York and Toronto in there because they are still quite expensive, as much or more so than Vancouver, and the percentage of tax is still higher. In New York's case, over an order of magnitude higher. Comparing Vancouver and Red Deer would be silly, I agree."

Vancouver, among other major cities, needs better public transit to meet population growth. Public transit is cheaper, more efficient and better for the environment then relying on the car. A city designed around good public transit is a much better and liveable city than a city designed around the car (not saying the car doesn't have its place).  Never before have such a diverse group of interest come together to support the same issue. From big business, to big unions, to environmentalists, to small business, to construction industry, engineers, the universities, architects, the real estate industry, carshare companies, etc etc etc.. Basically every major group in the lower mainland except Jason Batemen and the CTF. Never before have such a diverse group of interest come together to support anything, well except maybe that puppies are cute and ice cream is delicious.  The media loved controversy and Bateman won by spreading falsehoods and BS. And as the famous saying goes, the amount of effort to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude greater than the effort to create bullshit.  Anybody with any actually knowledge on the matter knew we absolutely need better transit and this was more than a reasonable funding source.

The right vs wrong answer will vary by person. NO, your opinion is not more correct than someone else unless you have a magic eight ball to accurately predict the future.   I was ultimately on the fence until the end and ended up confidently voting no. What pushed me further into the no? The entire yes campaign (especially its voters) turned into attacks on the no side and the extreme bias in the media. The media didn't even attempt to be neutral. This on top of the unrealistic list of projects that wouldn't be completed in the time or budget. Although I sometimes dislike Translink itself, it was a very minor reason I voted no. I don't even care about their high salaries because it's peanuts compared to Translinks projects. However, I do care about how inefficient they are at spending money. We do need better public transit, this just wasn't the way  Either way, it's over now and as I expected, the yes side didn't lose with dignity and has been non-stop attacking no voters since the results came out. If you are a yes voter, your opinion was the less popular one. It happens. We live in a democracy. Vancouver isn't going to fall apart like people keep saying. This isn't a doomsday situation.

vancouver,3cjr20,Diamond_notthrowaway,-2,Wed Jul 8 20:31:34 2015 UTC,So how should we fund transit then and raise $250 million per year to do so?

Etc.  How about stuff like that?   Why not let some of those funds that were earmarked for funding transit, fund transit?  Instead the various levels of government funnel that money into general revenue so they can run the election with ""A Balanced Budget"".  They couldn't balance the budgets so they threw money earmarked for transit at general revenue and then asked for more money for stuff people need/want (and have even already ponyied up for but forget about).  It's an election strategy not a governance strategy.  This was pretty evident in the whole ""We have no Plan B, that was it"".  There's some fine leadership for you.  What about forcing transit to actually step up and improve their business.  You can dismiss people's comments on the Ridiculous situation of two CEO but it's the perfect metaphor for the entire situation.  MTA's CEO (NYC) makes something like 360k usd in an organization with an annual budget of around 14.5B usd.  Our CEOs make something like 420k cdn EACH in an organization of around 1.4B cdn.  No that's not apples to apples and yes there are significant differences but it sure highlights something's seriously wrong.  ""People are upset saying we need to manage our business better what do we do??  Hire another CEO!!""  - CEO#1.  It demonstrate a complete disconnect with the constituents and lacking even basic business knowledge.   I want better transit but I also want responsible government and some confidence that my taxes are being used efficiently.  There's a reason CC and GR set up a ribbon cutting ceremonies for new transit routes and not sewage pipes renew.   Me I hope we fund both respectful.  Do we need to Fund transit for growth over the next decade?  Yes, and I'm guessing virtually everyone is in agreement on that but we'll never know because that wasn't the question  Do we need a additional 0.5% sales tax within the GVR to fund it transit (with nothing but promises, why not legislate the monies)?  62% of the voters said No  For f-sakes the yes side spent 7m trying to get this to pass that's like 0.5% of the annual budget of transitlink  ** all ""number"" and ""facts""are pure from memory while researching my position before the vote and should be considered purely fictional, but I don't care anymore so feel free to google them yourself I'm way too lazy"

In the event of a crash, it could take 10 years for prices to recover - see Japan.  getting married in itself doesn't require a change in living situation as 2 people can share a one bedroom condo.  it's when you get kids that you need a second bedroom.  Renting is good for when you don't know where you will be 5 years from now.  In the long long term, prices go up.  But prices also go down for the building itself which sits on valuable land, so as prices go up, you don't necessarily see YOUR condo go up in value as the wooden structure gets creakier and large items need replacing in the next 10 to 20 years.  If you do buy a place, try to get something built solid and quiet.  Avoid future pipeline routes.  Avoid living on major traffic arteries.  Being walking distance to good transit is good.

Long term, you can bet that there will be some sort of market intervention to curb rising costs, but as of right now that is just a discussion topic and there isn't a concrete answer for how the city could do that.  If you could afford it right now, why not buy property/housing. This market will still be rising in a year/2 years/3 years and onward, especially with the province investing in the economy. Now, down the road, I don't know what to tell you. It just isn't sustainable. Along with this, right now the province is still racking their heads around the rising CPI for BC and minimum wages, so when wages increase you can believe that the costs of housing will follow along the same direction, which means in the near term a definite increase in prices with demand being constant if not increasing as well.   Tl;dr: If you are focused on short term, e.g. 1-5 years, I don't see why you wouldn't see increasing prices, but I can't say for the market as a whole what that will look like. Long run, someone will institute a price ceiling or subsidies to help curb the costs, or increase in lower-income housing and more buildings being renovated into smaller units/micro condos being put up. Or any combination of those outcomes is possible."

I don't agree with the conversation devolving into one that assumes all Christian people in the Lower Mainland, particularly those interested in working in a strictly secular legal system, are hate mongering idiots from the South.   This doesn't assume all Christian people in the Lower Mainland, just those that took an oath that eliminates the human rights of a subset of the population. The fact that they are fear-mongering idiots is only half the problem. The other half is that it does not allow for equal possibilities for all individuals to attend law school.

It's not as if Nestle is stealing water from our reservoir.

Getting rid of bottled water would be a stupid idea.

That's obviously alarming and action needs to be taken, but it's not the same thing as a drought (see California last year).  Another thing worth noting: Nestle gets their water from the Fraser Valley aquifer. We get our drinking water from three reservoirs: Capilano, Seymour, and Coquitlam. Nestle bottling water is in no way taking away from the region's drinking water.  Also, as /u/ctcsupplies has pointed out below, Nestle takes about 2281 times less water than Metro Van uses daily.

For OP: things can cost arbitrary amounts, even beyond 1/100th of a dollar (take a look at volume pricing, or even your hydro bill).

That of course is how we currently handle both, though we spend far more subsidizing drivers than we do on transit. I'm pretty sure Translink's funding problems would be solved if we just took the Transportation budget and apportioned it according to mode share - that would give transit across the province a decent boost (not to mention a massive bonanza in bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure).

How should it be payed for? If they shifted more of the costs directly to the users, less people would use transit, resulting in a net loss to the economy. The assumption is that you're not more important because you pay more in taxes.

In an imaginary world where transit demand is inelastic, translink would have to double fares to reach 100% farebox recovery. That's $11 for a 3 zone fare or $340 for a monthly 3 zone pass.

How would you divide up that pie?  Like I said, transit demand is elastic. If they start raising fares above inflation demand will drop and then it's either (more) service cuts in the suburbs or higher taxes."

I do agree that rent isn't that insane here. Friends with about the same lifestyle as me in Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto all pay about the same if not more for rent on equivalent units. A quick look on padmapper will confirm that. The only other major city with noticeably cheaper rent is Montreal.  I'll be moving to the US for work very soon and have been hunting down rental apartments in Southern California, rent in just about every major city there is either about the same as Vancouver or higher. The Bay Area is eyewateringly expensive if you don't have a lucrative job in software,finance, or biotech it seems. San Diego is about the same. Los Angeles is a bit more expensive.

vancouver,3cm1pj,ttul,2,Thu Jul 9 15:20:20 2015 UTC,"I strongly believe when it comes to urban land usage the rights of communities and the people who live in them must come first. This particular property is somewhat of an exception as it's actually relatively well kept (By the city / community, not its owners), but there are FAR too many vacant lots across this city, sitting derelict, turning into trash-heaps and eyesores, all so some already wealthy individuals can sit on them until property values are high enough to make enough profit to justify the effort of doing something with the land. In a city already faced with a severe housing affordability crisis these vacant lots are an insult to the people of this city. We need far tougher regulations regarding vacant land. Personally I'd propose something along the the following lines:  If land sits empty for month than 3 months it must be maintained (Cleaned, landscaped) at least bi-weekly. If not severe and escalating fines are imposed. I'm talking 5% of the value of the land to start, increasing by 5% per period of the fine. If a fine goes unpaid for more than 6 months, the land is forfeit.  If land sits empty for more than 1 year it must be turned into a temporary park for the communities enjoyment at the owners expense and maintained by the owner. If not, severe and escalating fines.   If property sits empty for more than 3 years, it is forfeited. Seriously. There is no reason we as members of this community should accept that parts of our city are allowed to sit fallow and not be put to productive use when we are already faced by such a severe housing crisis. There is absolutely no reason any land owner should not be able to navigate the zoning process, secure any necessary funding and plan / design a project in three years time and the rights of the wealthy and corporations to make excise profit should not supersede the rights of the all the rest of the people who live here to have a clean, livable, affordable community. When such properties are forfeited, they should only either be converted into permanent parks or developed into affordable housing, thusly benefiting all members of the community by either providing green space or increasing the stock of affordable housing.   Call me a socialist, fine. But I'm sure like many others I'm sick and tired of seeing empty lots pile up with trash while hard-working people struggle to find a decent place to live. Something needs to be done and it needs to be drastic if its going to actually change anything."

For example, The Blarney Stone is fun and usually has a live band playing fun songs on Fridays. The Cambie is fun too, it's a hostel bar with really huge tables so you end up sitting and talking to new and interesting people every time you go. The Portside Pub is a cool place too - it's a pub/restaurant before 10, but after that they have a dancefloor sort of thing going on too.

BC Spirits as well, but they're kept behind the counter with tobacco (to appease the neo-prohibitionists). No radius rules. If you can have a tobacco license, you can sell BC beer, wine, and spirits.   Step 2: BCLS and Private liquor stores keep selling imported goods with the pre-April 1st rules, such as:  Step 3: Shelf prices are all in pricing. Tax? Included. Envirodeposit? Included. 6er of Bowen is listed at $7.95? You drop a fiver, toonie and loonie and get back a nickel. (Yes, I know the eco fees weren't included before, they will be now).  Step 4: Growlers can be filled at any bar (or Private liquor store) that wants to, at a price agreed to by them and the brewery. Also cider can be put in growlers. (Any non-distilled beverage, really, but I can't imagine there being much of a market for wine growlers).   A man can dream..."

vancouver,3cjnad,theadvenger,2,Thu Jul 9 09:11:18 2015 UTC,I also wish we could get rid of minimum drink pricing which does not account for the actual alcohol content. A light 7% wine has the same minimum price as a 20% fortified wine. If their argument is to use pricing to decrease drinking at least base it on specific alcohol content.

Government regulates land use, period. This is not a stretch at all. For example, the City of Vancouver mandates office space be built well ahead of demand in many parts of the core to 'future proof' the area and make it not entirely residential. Those office floor areas are not necessarily economically justified at the time of construction, but it is the long game to ensure neighbourhoods are balanced and can adapt. Same thing can be said for grocery stores. If the space can only be used for a grocery store, for example, the rent will drop until viable for a business.  It's just land economics. Private landlords do this same shit all the time to ensure appropriate tenant mix and selection (think: malls). This is the same version of that except on city blocks instead of a mall."

vancouver,3cmtgy,DJ_Molten_Lava,2,Thu Jul 9 06:13:20 2015 UTC,cheers...any other interesting place along the route to Ucluelet you'd reccomend to stop for the first night to break up the trip?
vancouver,3cmtgy,ProfitMuhammad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:15:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe Nanaimo, I guess.  There's not really a whole lot of towns between Nanaimo and Port Alberni, at least I don't know anything about them.  Port Alberni isn't too far from the end of your trip so that's probably not a good option."
vancouver,3cmtgy,CohibaVancouver,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:20:48 2015 UTC,"The drive is actually not too bad. I grew up in Nan and made the trip every summer. Don't waste your time in any of the small towns along the way, hit Nanaimo for breakfast after the ferry (go to Gabriels, that shit is amazing) and then drive to Coombs. It's cheesy, but it's a great place to stretch your legs, get snacks, and look at goats. If you like big trees definitely stop at Cathedral Grove for a walk in the forest. If it's super hot, stop at Sproat Lake just outside Port Alberni for a quick swim - the water there is perfect. Then you'll be set to finish the last stretch of road.     Be smart on the road for the last bit, it's pretty curvy, and a lot of people get impatient with the poor Alberta plates who can't seem to handle it. Just enjoy the drive =)"
vancouver,3cmtgy,CohibaVancouver,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:22:31 2015 UTC,any area around nanaimo you recc going to see/eat at if we spend one night there?
vancouver,3cmtgy,Roloboto,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you're into. Nanaimo is a pretty small town for it's population size... there's not a lot to see or do aside from great parks. It might make sense to catch a ferry after work in the evening and just get a place and crash, in the morning grab some bfast and take off... rather than going in the morning and spending a day there.     The Vault is a good hang out for after dinner socializing. It's a licensed coffee shop so it doesn't have the bar vibe, but it's open late. Gabriel's for breakfast, unless you just want pastries and coffee to go then head to Mon Petit Chou across the street. If it's open Trader Jake's is a pretty crazy place. It's like an antiques and oddities shop, but better... and unlike Vancouver you can actually afford to buy shit. He keeps super weird hours, but he's really great to chat with as well.    Umm.. ferries... you might want to reserve a spot depending on when you go. Keep in mind that festivals and events (like the bathtub races that are held every year in Nanaimo) will really clog up the ferries. And trust me, you do not want to spend a two sailing wait in your car on a hot summer day."
vancouver,3cmtgy,Out2D,0,Fri Jul 10 15:43:33 2015 UTC,"There is nothing to see in Uculet or Parksville IMO. Cathedral groves is neat, its between qualicam and tofino"
vancouver,3cmtgy,madamehandsome,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"Totally worth it.  It's like a 20-minute drive between Tofino and Ucluelet, and to be honest other than Tofino Brewing Company, Tofino doesn't really have anything that Ucluelet doesn't.  So even if you just stayed in Ucluelet you'd still have a great time."

I bike a lot and I know the area around UBC pretty well, and I can honestly say that every bike route leading away from campus is pleasant and will take you to nice areas. The most obvious route is NW Marine Drive to Spanish Banks and further along the water (as someone else said you can take the bike route all the way to the Burrard Bridge in to downtown). However, for something different, take SW Marine Drive to the Dunbar/Southlands area. Dunbar St. is quiet but there are some cafes and shops in the general area where the bike route crosses it and you could head a little further south and check out some of the horse stables in Southlands.  Have fun! I moved off campus a decade ago but I have many fond memories of exploring the beaches and other areas nearby."

vancouver,3cilj2,crazedlizard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"Peaceful Paddle lands Site C opponents on terrorist watch list   Dear Editor,  According to the Toronto Star (March 30, 2015), the Federal government has included the Paddle for the Peace on a terrorist watch list.  And here we thought we weren’t getting any attention.  We are in good company, though.  Also on the list is a physicians’ group opposed to child poverty, Mother Theresa, and a senior’s quilting group from Bugtussle, Saskatchewan.  In an effort to save our government security agencies time, not to mention the Canadian taxpayers a great deal of money, we’d like to present a brief resume of some of the key players on the Paddle for the Peace planning committee.  It is a rogues gallery indeed.  Retired primary school teacher Ruth Ann Darnell is the Chair of the Peace Valley Environment Association.  She has been working to save the Peace Valley from Site C since the 1970s.  Back then, Ruth Ann’s subversive activities were hampered by the fact the Internet was decades away from being created.  After a long day of teaching five year olds to read, she just never had the time or energy to trudge down to the Fort St. John library to research DIY incendiary devices.  After teaching her sixteen year old son to drive, local children’s clothing retailer Danielle Yeoman knew she was one of those rare talents every ISIS recruiting officer dreams of discovering.  She desired to really put her nerves of steel to the test.  But her terrorist career was over before it was started when she learned those torso belts packed with explosives add at least six inches to your waistline.  I mean really, there are limits to what a girl will do to support a violent fanatical cause.  When she was a little girl, Diane Culling dreamed of becoming a pot-smoking tree-spiker fighting to save the rain forests of the Sudan. Unfortunately she found the required cannabis consumption affected her fine motor skills.  She kept hitting her own thumb with the hammer.  In the end, she was forced to limit her mind-numbing activities to sitting through endless BC Hydro consultation meetings.  Local business owner Wendy Crossland’s membership application was regretfully declined when the Al-Qaeda executive realized she never stops smiling and laughing.  They might be a blood-thirsty terrorist organization, but they do have some standards.  And then there’s Tony Atkins.  He was in from the start and in it until his untimely death from cancer a few weeks ago. Educator, tireless community volunteer, virtual saint, and all-round asset to Fort St. John.  He won’t be there in the flesh at this year’s Paddle, but believe me, he will be there in our hearts.  So, that’s just a few members of the notorious PPPC (Paddle for the Peace Planning Committee).  There are others, but they’re like Voldemort – we don’t even say their names out loud.  To our friends at Canada’s spy agencies – I hope this helps.   If you want mug shots and finger-prints please meet us at our rendezvous site on the west side of the Halfway River bridge on Highway 29 on July 11th.  Bring a spare shirt in case you drip pancake syrup.  And don’t forget your life jacket; because, after all, at the Paddle for the Peace we are all about public safety.  Cordially,  Paddle for the Peace Planning Committee"

vancouver,3cilj2,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,2,Wed Jul 8 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"There isn't a fixed amount of jobs.  Historically, immigrants to Canada have been considerable producers of wealth. While when they land they are on average worse off than the typical Canadian born worker, by the end of their working lives your average immigrant to Canada is pulling in more income than Canadian-born.   It makes sense to. Immigrants are self-selecting for the self-starting and entrepreneurial risk-taking types."
vancouver,3cilj2,Weirdmantis,0,Wed Jul 8 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"For sure they are i'm not anti immigrant but they have to DO something like pave roads and create factories and resorts and we need electricity for them.  Let 2 or 3 hundred thousand people into Prince Rupert and make it a booming resource town. If you make the province a nature reserve then there won't be anything these people can do.  So like I say, we need to either allow development so these entrepreneurial types can come here and create jobs OR you can say we are full, let's not do anything that damages our environment.  Either one is fine by me.  What I don't want is to say no more development anywhere, let's cram 2 million more people into the tiny lower mainland and give everyone shit jobs which is what is happening right now.  Canada used to have immigrants that built this country and build little towns all over.  Now all the opportunities are in big cities because we aren't allowing development of our natural resources."
vancouver,3cilj2,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,2,Wed Jul 8 18:31:32 2015 UTC,"I doubt that Prince Rupert will ever be that big. The thing about the economy today is that you don't need lots of people to do lots of things. Prince Rupert, is, for instance, an absolutely enormous port.  In the olden days that would have required a fairly significant city to service that kind of industry. But today, a few cranes unload the containers from ships and another few cranes load the containers on trains and away they go to Chicago. And to accomplish this Prince Rupert only need be a 10,000 person town to handle more metric tones of freight than Seattle.  Same with the resource industry, especially one that is by necessity as mechanized and automated as the extraction and compression of natural gas.    The small resource town is a dying thing mostly because there isn't a whole lot of need for a whole town-full of people to service an isolated project, and fewer and fewer people want to live in such places anyway.  To anchor a small town, the high income crowd need to actually live there and shop there, but with a lot of resource projects the high income engineers and managers have the pull to demand fly-in work from what ever real city they actually want to live in, and even more people work off site.  Even an everything-goes resource boom today isn't going to generate the sort of place-making that such projects once did outside a few particularly exceptional locations."
vancouver,3cilj2,PopeSaintHilarius,-1,Wed Jul 8 19:04:04 2015 UTC,"Doubling immigration? No, that seems excessive. I'm fine with maintaining current immigration rates.

People coming up on molly were checked on, and offered a safe place to sit, offered FREE water, and were spoken to by human beings.

We have no shortage of black bears here so I don't see the point of endangering people in order to preserve as many as possible.   That said, if someone wants to rehab these cubs, rehab of black bear cubs is successful, and these ones are good candidates, I don't know why it's so important that they're shot. I think it's pretty nasty to insist that someone kill an animal when that person has found a viable alternative for it.   Maybe this has been an ongoing issue with him and they're penalizing him because they figure he's too soft to kill animals when it's really necessary."

vancouver,3ch5cj,spyder728,7,Wed Jul 8 05:34:00 2015 UTC,"That's a bit hyperbolic. I've got bears aplenty around my house in Coquitlam. They come in the yard, they wander around the street. The only community response I've seen is people warning families with small kids when there's a bear on the block. Other than that, the Ministry of Conservation just posts signs telling people not to call them if they see a bear.   Everybody practices bear-safe garbage and food handling. In fact, if the bear was breaking into a mobile home around here, I'd suspect that the Ministry would warn the family to secure their food better, and fine them if they failed to comply. Bears can't break through windows or solid doors, so this family probably had a screen door or window that the bear got through. If they'd have secured their freezer properly, the mama bear could still be alive."

And yes, if I put some salmon in my shed, I'd fully expect that a bear would come and rip into it in no time. And, if I complained about my shed being ripped apart by a bear, I'd fully expect the Conservation fellows to fine me for contributing to the delinquency of a bear - because it's illegal to have a food attractant that a bear can detect, and it's irresponsible to put it in a place where a bear can get to it. In my experience, you don't have to fine people, so much as just educate them.   My house is frequented by bears, coyotes, raccoons, skunks, and ants. And the only ones who piss me off are the ants. I'd take bears over ants any day."

However, in my opinion, it seems like going out and blowing a bears brains out because it walked through someone's backyard is a pretty heavy handed standard operating procedure for a government agency that has 'conservation' in it's title. Clearly they have tranquilizers. Put them on a helicopter and drop them off in some remote area behind Pitt Lake."
vancouver,3ch5cj,WestfieldWolf,4,Tue Jul 7 23:36:23 2015 UTC,"Conservation officers won't even come out to your house if all a bear does is walk through your yard.

Surely other bears have established territories there? They all need a large enough territory to feed themselves. How much will it cost? What kind of money exists for relocating?
vancouver,3ch5cj,a7neu,6,Wed Jul 8 03:54:10 2015 UTC,Put them on a helicopter and drop them off in some remote area behind Pitt Lake.   Why do you even think this is a good idea? Dropping off a bear into a territory it is completely unfamiliar with and possibly disturbing the areas natural ecosystem? Are you sure you know what your talking about or are you just saying this because youre squeamish at the idea of a bear dying?  Your also forgetting about operating costs and the fact that bears who've become accustomed to living around humans and eating from the garbage are actually a real threat to humans.

That's just hyperbole.  Just call and don't tell the neighbor it was you who did it. I've called on some people already. I've passed plenty of violators in other neighborhoods and considered calling as well. People need to take it more seriously."
vancouver,3cft1i,cimbalom,9,Tue Jul 7 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"The idea of snitching requires a contempt for the authorities. If you respect people in authorities like the municipal government and the police then snitching isn't something that can really be said to exists for you. However, it is a very real thing for some people despite it, perhaps, not being real for you. Soooo, this is and is not snitching depending on who you are.  Some people, for example, would consider you going straight to reporting your neighbor and not having the decency to talk to them face to face to be a fairly dick thing to do where as you seem to think it's a-okay neighbor behavior.  This is not to say that we should not take the water shortage seriously. We should. We should just try to have some decency about how we treat our neighbors while we take it seriously.  Edit because a word."
vancouver,3cft1i,roguemango,10,Tue Jul 7 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"So, maybe going straight to the authorities instead of talking to them directly, is a dick move.  But it's rarely clear, ahead of time, how that confrontation will go; some neighbours are great and understanding, and some neighbours react badly to being told they're wrong, and some neighbours hold grudges especially if they've been reported for an offense. I'm not sure if, for the sake of upholding the rules, I would want to risk finding out whether my neighbour is that kind of neighbour or not. Reporting anonymously doesn't carry that risk.  So, maybe openly disregarding the conservation rules and forcing your neighbours into this confront-or-report dilemma, is also a dick move in the first place, and anyone who decides to report, is simply responding in kind. That's how I'm inclined to see it."
vancouver,3cft1i,spazdor,3,Wed Jul 8 00:54:42 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right that doing the decent thing tends to carry more risk.

There are hundreds of people who live within a block of me, often only for a few months before they move on. I try to act friendly towards them but they are essentially strangers to me. So, I don't feel that I've wronged anyone by occasionally calling the city to report bylaw/restriction violations."

Don't get pissed when people do what's allowed just because you don't value their grass.   Looking at the water usage data is interesting, it seems most of the usage is level but the per capita is falling. I'm guessing their are a few very heavy users of water (like golf courses) which are taking the lions share. I'd like to see metering so people have an economic interest in conserving water.

We draw from limited reservoirs and we are drawing more each year - a trend that is obviously going to continue. Another major issue is peak usage throughout the municipality; our facilities are designed to handle certain maximum capacities, and if everyone is watering their lawns during hours when the system is being heavily drawn upon, the system can fail to meet capacity.   It's not some hippy dippy mumbo jumbo - why would anyone care when you water your lawn, unless (on a municipal scale) it had some tangible negative impact?

vancouver,3cguq5,godstriker8,20,Fri Jul 10 05:41:45 2015 UTC,"Back to Onterrible. GTA or Ottawa, though I would love to live on the bruce peninsula. Moving to Van was a late 20's adventure, somewhere totally new and different from where I grew up(I used to come to Van for trade shows). I knew going to Van that it would be expensive, but at this point in my life and career, I'm starting to look at moving out of BC.  The job market here pay is shit(I make less now here than I did when I graduated from university 10 years ago), even though I have way more responsibility. The city doesn't realistically offer a good future to those of us in our 30s. It feels like everything is stacked in favor of those who 'bought in' in the 90s or early '00s.  When I left the GTA to come out here I was renting a 3 bedroom house for what I rent a 1bedroom apartment here for(and I continually get rent increases here, never had that back in Ontario).  Something about this city just feels like a play area for the uber rich and the rest if us shmucks are told to deal with shitty lowered expectations for quality of life. I'm sorry but f*ck that.  I work hard, am well educated, I have a decent job, but at this point if I want to grow professionally and start a family, my only real option is to move.  I would be surprised if I still live here in another 18months. I kind of view my time here as an extended working vacation. It would be nice to live here, but the writing is on the wall and my future is not in this province.  I only have 3 more items on my list if things to do out here, climb the lions, go to Tofino and go to Banff(which I will this august).  Politically the BC libs are like the Ontario Libs. Hail their corporate masters and screw the populous.  I also find travel to be super annoying out here. Mountains are beautiful but goddamn they make travel times way the heck longer. I miss being able to drive to NYC or Chicago or even Ontario cottage country.  Sure Ontario gets snow and they air isn't quite as clean... But when it comes to being able to actually build a future... I don't really see BC as the place to do that.  This is coming from someone who is born in the early 80s so I have it much better than a lot of the echo generation.  Ohh well its been fun. Vancouver and BC. I hope this city and province sorts their shit out.   Sorry for a bit of a rant but my feeling that I want to move have been growing and growing. This was just a place to unload a bit.   Also my bad if there are typos. Phone typing sucks"
vancouver,3cguq5,Fourseventy,10,Tue Jul 7 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"As someone originally from Onterrible, all I can say is regardless of the situation, I will not go back out east.  The lifestyle and activities I enjoy out here are unrivaled compared to Ontario. The average price of a house in Toronto is over 1mil anyway...and it's friggin Toronto.   I'll probably move to Squamish."
vancouver,3cguq5,Mountainbillygoat,0,Wed Jul 8 01:43:15 2015 UTC,"I have lived in Toronto for a few months in my 20s.  I hated it, the only place I could actually live in Toronto is on the T.o isalands(GFs parents actually live there).  I used to live in Mimico right on the lakeshore so I had access to good parks and everything.  I just didn't like living there, I think I am just not a fan of living in big cities.  The surrounding western 'burbs' aren't too bad especially if you have access to GO trains.   Come to think of it.  Barrie would be pretty rad(I almost moved there before I came out to Vancouver. The  HWY400 sucks ass to drive on, however with the GO service now extended to Barrie getting to downtown Toronto in about an hour and for a reasonable cost is pretty sweet. Barrie also amazing access to great, Hiking, mountain biking (Hardwood Hills) and paddling Muskokas and Lake Huron & Lake Simcoe are relatively close."

The entry level pay for artists generally hovers around 40-46k in Canada and the United States, which isn't bad but compare to what you could get as a programmer it's sort of abysmal - especially when you consider living standards in Vancouver and every big city in the first place.

To see any real Change in prices you need to leave the lower mainland.  Things are reasonable in Squamish and hope,  but again terrible transit options and even poorer employment prospects in those areas,  means quite a few people commute 3+ hours a day into Surrey,  Burnaby and Vancouver to maintain their careers.

vancouver,3ch9pa,gudbimeyewuv,-1,Wed Jul 8 19:25:09 2015 UTC,"FWIW, be sure you know what you are doing.  Two important facts:   Cutting sugar doesn't actually matter that much - cutting total calories is what really counts.  (although not drinking soda and reducing your sugar is almost certainly a good thing for other reasons.) As a follow-up to the above, you don't actually need exercise to lose weight - you just need to take in less calories than you burn each day.   If you go to the gym and then eat a little more as a result, you won't lose anything.  (although going to the gym can bring many other benefits including muscle preservation during weight loss and is an important part of a healthy lifestyle)"
vancouver,3ch9pa,VR_22,4,Wed Jul 8 03:12:40 2015 UTC,"Man, this is way to simplistic and overall not good for someone who needs to change their lifestyle.   A healthy lifestyle is not just calories in calories out, it is also macro/micro nutrient based. Eating sugar is basically empty calories with overloads of glycogen.   Which brings me to my next point. The gym is essential to losing weight and keeping it off for two reasons.   Your muscles are your metabolism, with more lean body mass you are able to burn more calories more efficiently. Why is this important? Because you get to eat 3500 calories of delicious food without gaining weight! You most definitely can lose weight while eating more and weight lifting. I have done it, I have seen people do it. Renaissance Periodization is a great resource for this.  Exercise offsets caloric deficits which over time are destructive on your body. For example,  If I want to lose a pound per week. That is roughly 3500 calories or 500 calories per day. If I go on a caloric deficit of 250 cals and then burn the other 250 off through exercise I will lose at the same rate while eating more per day."
vancouver,3ch9pa,garthomite,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:13:32 2015 UTC,You are right that it is complicated.  My post was just meant to point out that it sounded like the OP might also benefit from a more thorough understanding.  My post was not intended to provide that understanding.
vancouver,3ch9pa,gudbimeyewuv,-2,Wed Jul 8 04:17:05 2015 UTC,"Actually /u/VR_22 is correct and I disagree that basic calorie reduction is not good for someone to change their lifestyle.  A gym is not essential to losing weight, it's optional. I dropped 70 lbs just from my eating alone, that took about 8 months.   I'm not saying people shouldn't stay active, being active is awesome but people shouldn't see it as a requirement for weight loss. After some of the weight is gone people are naturally inclined to be more active with their lighter bodies.   Your muscles are your metabolism, with more lean body mass you are able to burn more calories more efficiently   This is broscience. The problem with this logic is that it's very difficult to gain muscle mass on calorie deficits. Initially it can be done if you are quite obese but after some training the gains will slow down, the FAQ in /r/Fitness covers this.    Exercise offsets caloric deficits which over time are destructive on your body   Only an excessive caloric deficit will eat away at your muscle mass. Excessive being 22 calories/day per pound of body fat which is well above 500 for most people.  Honestly if I would have followed this advice when I started, I probably would have failed. The calorie deficit didn't wreck my body nor have I entered my gym. I did no exercise for the first 8 months then I wanted to get fit so with 2.5 months of biking, running, swimming I was able to finish the Vancouver Tri in 2:27, still in the top 20% of my age group."
vancouver,3ch9pa,garthomite,5,Wed Jul 8 06:26:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with your overall stance and am glad you were able to have success without the gym.   However, I will note that calling my, granted simplistic, claim broscience and then using the FAQ of /r/fitness, a sub soaked in broscience is fairly ironic. I agree that it is very difficult to gain muscle mass on a deficit but it is not impossible and often, if a reasonable deficit is undertaken people who focus on proper nutrition, rest and strength-focused workouts will not lose any strength while they may not specifically gain any muscle.   What I mean by your muscles are your metabolism is that people with a higher % of lean body mass, sub bone structure, have a higher basal metabolic rate. About 20% of your TDEE comes from physical activity whereas 10% is from themogenesis, these are obvious generalizations. By undergoing anaerobic, not aerobic, we can slightly increase our BMR overtime.   Anecdotally we see this very often in bodybuilders, olympic weight lifters, powerlifters and sprinters. People who have high levels of muscle mass and use that muscle mass can eat quite large amounts of food to maintain that muscle. This is a combination of both LBM BMR and high levels of physical activity.   I am not saying you can't lose weight by just eating less but that it is suboptimal. Of course this is applying my bias that your end goal should be one of muscle bearing fitness (sprinter vs. marathon runner) and not 'skinny,' 'skinny fat,' or 'runner fit,' although I do realize some people thrive on the latter's body type."
vancouver,3ch9pa,tripleaardvark2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:07:03 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that /r/fitness is full of broscience but the specific subject of gaining lean muscle mass while losing on a calorie deficit in the FAQ is not. I just don't want people to have expectations that they can go from sedentary to losing a lot of weight and gaining lots of muscle mass at the same time.   I also agree what you said for someone that wants to go from skinny or skinny fat to athletic, it is spot on.  It's just the necessity for the gym to perform a lifestyle change. Yes I want to see people train and become active and athletic but at the same time I get how depression based eating gets to you, I also get what it's like to live a sedentary lifestyle and the daunting task of making that change.  For me the best way to maintain a lifestyle change is to make lots of small changes over time, master each change and keep going to the next. It could start with just simply cutting out calorie dense foods, then it can move on to just eating your TDEE of calories then eventually moving to a deficit. Every single change I do I ask my self ""Is this something I can maintain for life?"". At this point your losing weight and when you are ready then it's time to put in to action everything you said if that is your athletic goal.  I just don't want people to be discouraged about the process of losing weight and changing their lifestyle. I've seen it way too many times and I'm sure you have as well where someone takes on a aggressive plan coming from a sedentary background then after a few weeks or months something happens, either life gets in the way, injury or whatever excuse people will find to stop their training and revert to their old ways. If someone learns how to at a bare minimum eat their TDEE worth of calories then when these life events pop up they have a better chance.  Sorry if I come off a little passionate about this topic but it's a topic I've had a lot of experience with. I know what it's like to be sedentary and disgusted with myself and now I know what it's like to be athletic so my goal is really to get people started. Once they are up and running then they should be coming to people like yourself to become strong and faster!"

vancouver,3cknbe,E3_Lunatic,5,Wed Jul 8 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"There is also the Greek 'Nike' statue at the intersection of Thurlow & Cordova. This statue is given to host cities by the city of Olympia, Greece.  Also, the Inukshuk from Expo 86 and the symbol of the 2010 Olympics at English Bay. The countdown clock was separated into two parts. BC place has the Olympic side of the clock, and Whistler Olympic Park has the Paralympic side of the clock."
vancouver,3cknbe,westfalia1969,2,Wed Jul 8 18:19:18 2015 UTC,I was on Google Maps wondering why I had never seen a Nike Swoosh statue in Vancouver... I wonder if the Greeks would like it back right now...
vancouver,3cknbe,Cant-Find-Username,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:17:58 2015 UTC,It was in storage for a long time. The City couldn't decide where to put it. It was only installed about a year ago.

vancouver,3cknbe,VR_22,0,Wed Jul 8 17:45:53 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that it's stupid there aren't rings downtown, but the fact remains you have to go to Whistler or Cypress to find them."

Surrounding yourself with others who understand your situation might help considerably.   Also, from what I've read, BC has some of the best cancer treatment available. Good luck. Hope you beat the cancer and get well soon."
vancouver,3ce043,Muskwa,18,Tue Jul 7 04:38:20 2015 UTC,"I've been doing my best to stay away from the googles, so I wouldn't even know how good BC is, or what the long-term prognosis for everything is. I struggle with anxiety sometimes so it's best for me to not know, hah.  Not searching for everything I could on google was suuuuuuper hard. When I started noticing symptoms about 6-7 weeks ago my first instinct was to check google... and I did, briefly. But I stopped myself and I've been good about it ever since!   Local support groups - I didn't even think of that. And I'm surprised  none of my doctors even mentioned it to me :o. It's a good idea, so thank you for mentioning it :)."

However, you shouldn't be too cautious in being optimistic you can make it through this. My dad just beat (plasmabastic non-hodgins lymphyoma I think was his) about a month ago after 6 months of chemo. This is despite being in his 60s, and a double kidney  transplant recipient in his life. He's a stubborn old bastard, and he's not quite recovered from chemo yet but the treatment worked for him.  There's rough times ahead, but there's likely to be times where you're amazed as well."

vancouver,3ce043,MoshPotato,33,Tue Jul 7 15:55:13 2015 UTC,I work for the Canadian Cancer Society and there is a great program called Cancer Connection. It is volunteers who man phones and are there literally for that. They are all cancer survivors and are great support for those who don't have family/friends to talk to or who can empathize with you.
vancouver,3ce043,phycolologist,2,Tue Jul 7 05:04:29 2015 UTC,Thank you for telling me this! That certainly sounds like a great resource.

vancouver,3ce043,RainbowNowOpen,19,Tue Jul 7 05:08:13 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed with a very aggressive cancer last year and although I had friends and family, I still felt pretty alone.  No one I talked to really understood my situation and it was pretty frustrating try to talk to people about it, they couldn't relate to my situation.  If you are being treated at the BC Cancer Agency, I highly recommend going to the support groups and talking to one of the counselors.  It was a breath of fresh air being able to talk to people who knew exactly what I was going through.  Talking to the people there made me feel a lot better about my situation. The Canadian Cancer Society also has a CancerConnection service that connects people living with cancer with trained volunteers who listen, provide hope, offer encouragement and share ideas for coping – all from their unique perspective as someone who’s been there."
vancouver,3ce043,parkleswife,6,Tue Jul 7 05:37:00 2015 UTC,Thank you for sharing. How are you doing now? I'm wishing you the best.
vancouver,3ce043,MoshPotato,7,Tue Jul 7 05:13:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate it.  I had surgery a year ago, everything looked good until a few months ago.  CT and PET scans were showing activity in my chest cavity again, so I have to go in for more treatment soon.  I find that if you keep a positive attitude, getting through it is a lot easier."

The BC Cancer Agency has their shit together pretty well, in my experience with loved ones and their cancers.  This includes counselling and support groups.  You're fortunate to live in Vancouver and have the agency close by.  I can't give you a hug right now, but I can tell you that there are people within that organization for exactly this situation.  You will find people to console you and love you and support you.  Best wishes."

I'm 30 and a teacher with my summer off so I'm totally free and available for a chat if you need one.  I'm low on friends right now too so we can talk about stuff not related to cancer if you want because talking and thinking about cancer all the time sucks.   Either way, I wish you the best."

I moved here from Burnaby and I'm so so much happier in a quieter city.  I live in walnut grove, on the north side of the freeway, so it's even quieter than downtown Langley. And I like that I can still get to the ""big"" city easily enough. I'd love to show you around sometime! There's a place near me that has killer Mayan hot chocolate...

They have a retreat this summer in BC and you will be able to meet other young adults and build a network.  They also have a group called Local life and they do stuff monthly around the city.  We are like a big family and you will make some good friends I guarantee it.  Also head over to /r/cancer lots of good people, can also get a idea of what other people have gone through.    Check out the counselling at the cancer centre also, it is good to talk to someone."

I myself won't mind if you'd like to PM me, since anxiety and depression are things I have experience with and have no problem talking about, but I strongly urge you to check out our local support services. Next time you see a doctor, ask him/her what they recommend. They're usually quite knowledgeable of such things, from what I've seen. I got a whole list from my own family practitioner alone. Heal your body, but don't neglect your mind.   Here's a good site to get you started. Get well soon, OP! We're all rooting for you here!

It's never easy meeting patients who are young but I'd just like to assure you that you are not alone! Like some of the other users have suggested, be sure to use the support groups if you are getting treatment at BCCA. The individuals you will meet there all know exactly what you are going through and would be delighted to meet you! Also, remember to voice your concerns and questions for your oncologist (and try to avoid reading too much from Google!). The oncologists are some of the most wonderful and caring professionals I have ever talked to.  I truly wish you the best.

Pick a location that works and an office that appeals to you.   Who it is doesn't really matter, but you need someone you can check in with regularly and who has a file on you in addition to your oncologist. Shop a few - it's a totally legitimate process."

He believed Dr. Chen is still taking patients. Make an appointment on Tuesday or Thursday and you'll get to visit with an intelligent, young stud of an intern. It's Dr. Jason Chen in the north tower at Oakridge and he's at 604 261 6000.   There's a new-ish clinic at the Superstore Marine at Maine and they're probably still taking patients. I went in last summer as a walk-in while my doc was on holiday and I was surprised by how clean and modern the place is.   You pay MSP, it makes sense to use it regularly. Especially with the whole cancer thing going on (which I'm sure you're going to lick, and then you and your new gp will always have something to talk about)."

vancouver,3ce043,sh0nuff,4,Tue Jul 7 10:22:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the kind sentiments and for reminding me to be my own advocate. I'm kicking myself now for not pressing doctors harder. I don't have a family physician and so I was just bounced from one walk-in clinic doctor to the next, none of whom actually said anything to me. They physically prodded me, told me to just 'wait' or printed off a requisition. The longest interaction I had was about 1 minute from the walk-in docs. I don't blame them - I'm just another sack of meat they have to slog through. It was just a tough experience and I should have done more for myself. I'll be sure to do more of that going forward."

It's good to have someone to listen carefully to what is being said since you are in an emotional state and may mis-hear or mis-remember.  I assume that you now have a clear diagnosis and are working with a specialist?  Do you have next steps for the treatment?

vancouver,3cfjvf,mukmuk64,19,Tue Jul 7 14:57:56 2015 UTC,"So Surrey's Plan B is to divert developer fees away from municipal projects like improved streetscape, parks and community centres, and toward directly funding a project that is obviously too expensive for the city and that the Province should be building in the first place.  I'm sure Christy Clark is fine with this plan, but Surrey residents should be very concerned."
vancouver,3cfjvf,dominion47,3,Tue Jul 7 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sounding like a broken record on the issue, but our real financial concern should be run away municipal councils."
vancouver,3cfjvf,dominion47,13,Tue Jul 7 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"Well I think there's a core issue of an increasing dereliction of duty by the Province. As the Province does less and less, municipal councils are faced with stepping in to fill the gap in service, or doing nothing and seeing their communities decline in quality.   We've seen this with low income housing in Vancouver. The Province is not building nearly enough housing to provide to the homeless or at risk of homeless. As a result Vancouverites see the homeless on the street and ask the City to do something about it. The Province refuses to do more on the issue, and so to make up the gap the City diverts developer fees into its own low income housing funding. The Province successfully dumped the issue on the municipality, and now the municipality has less ability to provide the things that it should be focusing on, such as street improvements, parks, etc.   Now we're seeing this with transportation. In Ontario the government just announced they'd be covering 100% of the costs of Hamilton's LRT, but here the provincial government is demanding that municipal councils contribute way in excess of their ability. The result is what we're seeing develop, where Surrey is considering diverting funding from typical city services into an infrastructure mega project they really shouldn't be funding.   The issue is not runaway costs at municipal councils, but that they're being asked to provide more and more services, but do not have the funds to do so. The Province is now stating that cities should just raise property taxes. This way the Province can balance its books and appear like a thrifty, well run, ""no new taxes"" government. In reality all the Province has done is dumped costs from its books on the municipalities and forced them to increase taxes."

vancouver,3cfjvf,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,19,Tue Jul 7 16:35:54 2015 UTC,"Is anyone else sick of out of context dollar amounts?   According to Ms. Hepner’s campaign literature, that share is about $64.5-million. However, it goes straight to TransLink under current provincial laws.   That's neat, Surrey pays a consider amount of gas taxes and $64 million sounds like a heap of money.  I wonder how much its current Skytrain infrastructure cost? Or how much does Translink spend a year in Surrey? I'd be willing to bet it spends considerably more than the $64 million if you include capital projects.  So ""Translink is taking 'our' money"" holds a lot less water as a news story if Translink takes $1 but spends $2, $3, $4?"
vancouver,3cfjvf,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,12,Tue Jul 7 15:05:48 2015 UTC,"Under the 2014 base plan translink's expected gas tax revenue was about $330 million. So Surrey's contribution would net out to a bit under a fifth of Translink's gas tax revenue, which is more or less equivalent Surrey's share of the Metro Vancouver population.    EDIT: Come to think of it, the numbers are sufficiently close that it's entirely plausible that the $64.5 million figures was arrived at simply by multiplying the total revenue times Surrey's population share."
vancouver,3cfjvf,biskelion,22,Tue Jul 7 16:11:41 2015 UTC,"Between Hepner's undermining comments about everything being built anyway during the referendum regardless of the vote, and musings about pilfering regional funding sources, it would seem that the people at Surrey City Hall believe that they don't have to be part of the region."

vancouver,3cfjvf,nolanrh,17,Tue Jul 7 20:27:40 2015 UTC,Yes the public pays for it - that's why it's called public transit and not private transit...
vancouver,3cfjvf,proudbedwetter,12,Wed Jul 8 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"The main reason transit is publicly funded is because drivers are too entitled to actually pay for the costs of congestion, parking, and other important road costs leading to the roads being over-full.  Transit was historically funded to alleviate this pressure.  It remains the case that it's cheaper and more efficient to build Canada Lines than it is to build Port Mann Bridges"

vancouver,3cfjvf,nolanrh,-4,Tue Jul 7 15:27:31 2015 UTC,70% of everyone are drivers. so drivers pay for almost all of roads and 1/3 of public transit.

vancouver,3cfjvf,proudbedwetter,-2,Tue Jul 7 15:42:46 2015 UTC,except they won't. the vast majority of people drive and under a user pay system the vast majority would be paying for roads. assuming that transit also goes user pay and drivers fund 1/3 of transit i suspect that the only thing that will go up in price is transit.

Discourse Media’s George Poulos recently calculated that for every dollar I spend as a driver, “society” pays $9.20 for congestion, air pollution, traffic safety, accidents, and other hidden driving costs.  By comparison, every dollar spent by a transit user costs society $1.50. A PST increase benefits drivers by sharing that cost among everyone — including tourists. Transit riders pay fares; what’s wrong with drivers paying a toll on the new Pattullo Bridge to cover a much smaller fraction of their subsidies?"""
vancouver,3cfjvf,proudbedwetter,-6,Tue Jul 7 16:06:19 2015 UTC,"discourse media isn't a credible source. they are a special interest group pushing an agenda. a great way to do that is to talk about ""hidden costs"" instead of real costs that are in plain view."

vancouver,3cfjvf,proudbedwetter,3,Tue Jul 7 16:28:15 2015 UTC,it doesn't matter if you use the roads or not you still help fund them. and in actual fact if you are driving on them you are causing wear and tear and added congestion. if anything everyone else is off setting the costs you would actually be paying if you only paid for what you use. the only real reason you can actually use your car in an efficient way is because others have left their car at home to take transit.  without transit your commute time double at least. so get off your high horse and wake the fuck up. you live in a society where everyone pitches in to help everyone else. don't like it? move to America.

vancouver,3cjqsf,Lvl100Magikarp,2,Wed Jul 8 13:23:02 2015 UTC,I have taken the train and it was totally worth it. The highway itself is beautiful but the train goes through untouched countryside and river banks. The entire experience is really good with the narration and meals. They have an open air coach where I spent most of my time. I'm a sucker for trains though. If you can afford it then I would strongly recommend it.
vancouver,3cjqsf,lordoftheopenflies,2,Wed Jul 8 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"Yes the train is beautiful and much more relaxing than the drive. I'd personally skip Victoria and add a night in Whistler, because cities don't really do it for me the way mountains do."
vancouver,3cjqsf,smilinfool,2,Wed Jul 8 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused, it's a 3.5 hour trip, does that mean you need at least 2 days to do this trip? (i.e. stay one night in whistler), or do people just do it in one day, and spend all day on a train? I mean, if we make this a day trip, we'll barely be 1 hour in Whistler.   The train is a very nice trip - But to some degree it's like a cruise ship on rails.  Nice views & meals.  However, if you're able to rent a car I'd recommend that instead as it gives you more flexibility to stop along the way.  It's one of the most impressive drives in the world. If you leave Vancouver at 8:00, after rush hour is dying down, and then stop at Porteau Cove and Shannon Falls, you can aim to be at the Sea to Sky Gondola when they open at 10am.  If you're back on the road by 11:30 you should in Whistler by about 12:15, give or take.  You can leave Whistler after dinner and be back in Vancouver a couple of hours later.   Do not drive if you've had a couple of drinks.  You will likely encounter a drunk-driving roadcheck on the way back.*   All of the above are google-able.   Also, is Victoria Island worth staying, or is a day trip enough? Our provincial capital is the small city of Victoria, on Vancouver Island.  It's well-worth visting.   You can certainly do a daytrip to Victoria, provided you're able to make an early start.  BC Ferries operates large car ferries between Tsawwassen (south of Vancouver - pronounced suh-wassen) to Swartz Bay on Vancouver Island (North of Victoria).  http://www.bcferries.com/  http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2731/4057699266_4c89b2e5ca_z.jpg  Downtown Vancouver to Tsawwassen is about a 45-60 minute drive, Swartz Bay to Victoria is about 30 minutes. The ferry crossing is a little over 90 minutes. Reservations are recommended for peace-of-mind, but you can also just show up.  Here's my typical day-trip schedule for out-of-town guests -   Drive away from Vancouver around 5:30AM, arriving the Tsawwassen ferry terminal at 6:15am-ish Board 7am ferry to Victoria, eat breakfast on board in the buffet, admire views of sun coming up in Active Pass Drive off ferry at 8:45, arrive downtown Victoria around 9:15. Visit the Royal Provincial Museum, tour the Legislature (Parliament), walk around the inner harbour, take a harbour ferry water taxi to Spinnaker's for lunch. Drive away from Victoria around 3:30 PM for the 5pm ferry out of Swartz Bay Eat dinner of board Drive off ferry around 6:45, back in Vancouver 7:30 - 8pm.   If you don't want to drive you can also take an organized tour that follows roughly the same itinerary, for example http://vancouvertours.com/tour/victoria-tour/ - There are several others.  You can also get to Victoria on public transit, but if you're only going for a day I wouldn't recommend using up that time."

The harbour and Parliament area is beatific but Chinatown is also worth exploring and I'm not sure how keen you are to do everything in one day.  Most people here drive up to Whistler. It's a 1.5 hour drive and you can definitely do the one day. The Rocky Mountaineer is a gorgeous ride but it's pricey and longer than driving.  Depending on what you want to do in whistler a day trip would be fine too (if driving). The village is not very big but if you're planning on hiking or biking I would leave early in the morning to get the most out of your day there.  Also if you can find a place to store your bags, you don't need to take all of your luggage with you to Victoria for a 2 day trip."

So Guilford and Newton don't get any service to people from Langley can travel quicker through Green Timbers and Farmland.   Maybe someone can explain why from King George the a potential Skytrain can't backtrack slightly through the hyrdo right of way down to 104th to Guilford then take 152nd back to Fraser Highway? It would be longer, but still a shorter travel time than LTR, and pick up the second most populated centre in Surrey."

vancouver,3ciwbo,Birddawg65,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:51:12 2015 UTC,Well yeah how dyou think smoked meat gets smoked? They smoke it for anywhere from 4-16 hours.

And what else dyou expect them to do with meat they don't sell? Throw it away? Slow smoked meat tastes better the day after anyways.

It's not like they caught her selling drugs in school or something similar, why treat her like a criminal if she hasn't committed a serious crime (drugs in school is super bad, but it could also be her holding something for a friend), and is still young enough to not have her name published in the papers (whole life ahead of her to make better decisions)?"

Otherwise if the crown does lay charges the cop has to go into court and if they don't show up then the case gets tossed. So why bother writing anything up?  I suspect they do keep a ""record of the encounter"" if they presume there might be problems in the future and having the encounters registered would allow them to easily see a pattern.  Now if that's overkill or not, we can debate, but I can see their rational for the record keeping."

There should be safe guards against those sorts of things to prevent the dumb screw ups that kids have from marring them for the rest of their lives. But for Adults over 18?  It's called accountability.  As for this guy's lawsuit?  Here's just another helicopter parent trying to do everything for their kid.  He should try teaching her some life skills, like how not to get caught by the police smoking dope."
vancouver,3ceg2e,donovanbailey,10,Wed Jul 8 13:48:00 2015 UTC,It's got nothing to do with accountability. If I never receive a ticket or a charge the interaction should not show up in a background check regardless of my age. Knowing this now I'm immediately even less willing to talk to police about anything.
vancouver,3ceg2e,AdiposeFin,-4,Tue Jul 7 12:23:47 2015 UTC,"Has everything to do with being accountable.  Let's say that one day somebody is at the bar, drunk, causing problems.  The police are called.  Rather than cart this person off to jail, they put them in a taxi and send them home with a sober(er) friend.  The police write a report saying he was drunk and sent home in a taxi.  There should be no record of this person being drunk and causing a problem in the bar?  So much police work is just an order maintenance situation like this.  Where just by having the police show up, the problem is resolved.  No charges, nobody goes to jail and the problem is over.  But does that mean that there shouldn't be a record of this?  Should people be able to misbehave in public with no repercussions at all?  Or are you asking for a formal process in each and every situation?  The scenario above ends with the guy being given an appearance notice to go to court and answer to a criminal charge of causing a disturbance by being drunk in a public place.  That's ridiculous.  Even if they gave him a liquor act ticket for public drunkenness, that would be a charge and he could go to court on it.  Where's the court time going to come from for all this?   Knowing this now I'm immediately even less willing to talk to police about anything.   Comments like ""less willing to talk to the police"" only show what kind of a life you must live.  Other than just saying hello, nobody should ever have to talk to the police.  There's simply no reason whatsoever for the police to talk to me in my day to day life.  None.  I say hello to police officers when I see them, because I'm a nice guy.  Or maybe I might be a victim/witness to a crime, or be in a car crash or maybe get pulled over for a traffic offence. Outside of those few situations, there's really zero reason for the police to talk to me or me to talk to them.  I don't give them a reason to talk to me either.  So I don't know what kind of a life you live if the police are always talking to you, but perhaps it's time to change your ways."
vancouver,3ceg2e,donovanbailey,5,Tue Jul 7 18:03:56 2015 UTC,"If these ""problems"" are deemed by the police to not be at a level worthy of the formal process we have in place to deal with the situation, then no. If the police want to maintain internal records, fine, but they should be secured and non-distributable. You think this person should face career and mobility consequences even though they didn't break any laws? Must be nice being a middle-aged white male. If even reporting a crime will associate me in their PRIME database why would I take that personal risk?"
vancouver,3ceg2e,AdiposeFin,-3,Tue Jul 7 18:46:42 2015 UTC,"You think this person should face career and mobility consequences even though they didn't break any laws?   How do we know they didn't break any laws?  Perhaps they did and the police exercised discretion.  Be it a drunk causing problems at a bar, or Daddy's Little Princess smoking dope.  The police have a lot of discretion in how they deal with minor things.   The other thing here is that the police are not disclosing anything.  If you've ever had one of these record checks done, like I have to get done for a volunteering gig I do, all that you get is a sheet with a box ticked off.  It doesn't say anything more than 'record may or may not exist' in four categories: convicted, currently charged, charged but not convicted and history of negative contact.   Its up to YOU to disclose what happened.  In any of those situations, it's easy to explain something by being honest.  ""Yeah, when I was 20 I got busted for stealing a car with my friend.  I was young and stupid, I learned my lesson.""  or ""Man, I had a crazy girlfriend a few years back, we would always argue and a couple times the neighbours called the cops on us.""  Things like these are understandable.  Or you can just stonewall them and say ""I haven't been convicted of any crimes and that's all I'm going to say.""  Well, that says a lot about who you are as a person now, doesn't it?  See what I mean about accountability?  And guess what? I'm a guy with one of those boxes ticked off!    Must be nice being a middle-aged white male.   Oh fuck right off.  This has NOTHING to do with race and everything to do with behaviour.   I hate to break the news to you, but if you're not white it doesn't mean anything.  What are all the Asian, Indo, Black, police officers out to get you too?  Come off it man, this isn't a race issue."
vancouver,3ceg2e,_timmie_,2,Tue Jul 7 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"Whether laws were broken or not is irrelevant.  What is relevant is that the person was never charged with anything and most definitely not found guilty of anything.  The person involved has no idea that information is being tracked and has no recourse against it.  Yet a background check will show that information and it can impact whether they can get a job or not.  In the eyes of the law, if a person isn't charged with a crime then they are innocent.  Background checks should absolutely not be showing things that the person was never charged with.  I don't care if the police track that stuff internally, but it should never be visible through a background check that anyone can request."

The sound effects throw you off a lot, because you don't hear the bangs for 3-4 seconds after the light, and most of the smaller stuff makes no noise at all.   Part of the problem up there is that the loudest part is the people around you, and that year there were a lot of really negative people up there complaining that it looked too small and they couldn't hear anything... and they were making these complaints while the fireworks were ongoing. So that kinda puts a damper on the mood.   If you are looking for a nice chill spot though, with not too big of a crowd, that's the place."

vancouver,3cgbwl,kLAUphoto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:54:09 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to reduce image noise on very long exposures, stacking will help with that.  Instead of taking say, a 10 minute exposure, you would take 20 * 30 sec exposures, and then combine that in Photoshop.  The idea is to prevent the sensor from heating up so much that it would introduce too much noise.  I believe they explain some of their terms/shorthand in their wiki link on the sidebar (for /r/astrophotography).  Anyways, just keep on reading and practicing!  I'm by no means an expert in astrophotography, but I may be able to help explain some things to you if you have further questions."

Get one that had a detachable footpad so you don't need to use the 1/4"" socket to remove the camera. A remote release. You need this because timing shots using the 2 or 10 second self timer doesn't give you control, plus you may need to use longer exposures on ""Bulb"" setting.

vancouver,3cgupd,app_dev5,2,Tue Jul 7 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"I'm in a different branch of engineering so I'm afraid I can't be of much help, other than to confirm that salaries are a lot lower here than elsewhere. The labour force in that field has been pretty saturated after the boom in the 90's/early 2000's.  A friend of my dad who's a software engineer was laid off about 6 years ago, and has been surviving on bits and pieces of contract work ever since. Although I think part of the problem was he didn't stay as up-to-date as he should have.  Also,   I've also had a few interview experiences in which HR would ask me if I could take an ""intermediate"" position. Is this prevalent here?   Sounds like just another way of saying that they can't afford to pay you what you're worth/what you were making before.  Good luck!"
vancouver,3cgupd,touchable,2,Tue Jul 7 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"For your level, it would start in the 100-120K base salary range in Vancouver, depending on what your actual experience or expertise involved. Depending on what region you came from, salaries would be higher/lower here than the US - but if you take into account the current exchange rate, it's generally lower.  The intermediate position ask - there could be different reasons for this: they don't think you're qualified for their senior level, they don't have a senior position open, they're trying to fill an open position and earn commission, etc. I wouldn't say it's prevalent, but comes from uncertainty.  Perhaps look more into the benefits packages than the salaries - some companies offer pretty comprehensive ones."
vancouver,3cgupd,InYourBox,4,Tue Jul 7 22:53:56 2015 UTC,"What kind of places are you applying to, and are there actual openings or are you going in for meetings hoping something sticks? I'm genuinely quite curious as I'm in the middle of completing a CS degree at SFU, granted it will be a few years before I'm in a position to even be called intermediate.  To answer your question, yes, as far as I know, you'll make better money in the states. There are some bigger companies setting up shop here though...Microsoft is moving to the new Nordstrom building, Amazon is opening an office in the new Telus building, Hootsuite apparently can't hire people fast enough. SAP (formerly Buisness Objects) has always had a large presence here. I'd say I'm fairly optimistic for the future.  Good luck with your search OP!"

vancouver,3cgupd,crazyol84,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:06:53 2015 UTC,"I am less qualified than you (10 years experience, masters in CS), I think my peers make about 90-110k base + 15-25% in stocks/bonus.    If it makes a difference, I work in the video game industry and enjoy the work environment.  Most of the people who I know roughly how much they make started in the video game industry and went elsewhere, so this probably biases my numbers a bit.  I would expect 100k+, unless your skills are in low demand here."

vancouver,3cdzsr,artemislight,7,Tue Jul 7 06:35:31 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine on the roads.  Just stick to traffic calmed bike streets vs main arteries.  Your biggest threat is really just the doors from parked cars (make sure you ride an 'opening door's width away from them! :)    The best bit is that at that early an hour, not only would sidewalks be empty but the roads will be too.      You're actually safer in the street  because  cars won't expect something bike speed coming off a sidewalk and won't be looking for you at intersections vs when you're visible in the road.  Don't know where you're coming from in Kerrisdale but as soon as you get on a street like Heather or Angus Dr to Cypress you'll see how empty they are!    If you're worried, try doing it on a Sunday as a trial run.  I'd offer to be a bike buddy for you but I ride east vs north to downtown."

vancouver,3cdzsr,vanyeeha,5,Tue Jul 7 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna agree with everyone else here.  Take the bike routes.  They're usually fairly traffic free and pretty safe.  I completely understand that there are situations where it's a lot safer to not be on the road and your safety should be your paramount concern. If you MUST ride on the sidewalk, then ride the same speed as a pedestrian would walk and give pedestrians plenty of warning you're coming.  Even with shared bike/pedestrian paths, I see plenty of folks who step out onto the sidewalk from a side street without looking so be on the lookout for that too."

Did you know that the California redwoods survived to be old-growth in spite of being exposed to periodic fires anyway? Not being exposed to fire would not seem to be condition of reaching old-growth so what were you going on about?  We could also talk about the bristlecone pine. Those get licked by fire once and a while but they're still some of the longest living things in the world.

There's also Motomachi Shokudo right beside Kintaro, which is actually like Kintaro's older sister (sister restaurants). At the other end of Robson is Jinya, which is also very popular.  Taishoken by Chinatown has good dipping noodles (tsukemen) that is hard to find anywhere else. Ramen Butcher nearby also got a mention from TV chef Alton Brown.

I wish more people understood this concept and didn't think one day or one season of below average temperatures refutes climate change."

But that logic also goes the other way too; one hot summer following an uncharacteristically dry winter isn't proof positive of climate change. And I'm saying that as someone who absolutely believes in climate change."

What it is though, is a tangible example of the sorts of things climate change will bring.  We have to fix this, or else... what we're seeing today is a possible example of 'or else.'"

Edit: edited for clarity as to what I meant."

vancouver,3ccfwf,friendlymechstudent,3,Tue Jul 7 18:05:56 2015 UTC,"I'm all in favour of people that bike to work or take transit if they wish to or can. It's great that those people have the option to use those resources and the more people that bike and take transit, the less congestion there is on the roads. But those options aren't always realistic for a big portion of the population. Why should the people that cannot use those options be punished? I used to take transit from Surrey to East Van and my commute was 3+ hours a day, and I didn't have the freedom to enjoy many of the activities I do now because taking transit around the city took so much time and effort. Not to mention, if you take transit during peak hours like I did, you'll know that the crush of people waiting for buses and trains would make rush hour vehicle traffic look like a cake walk. I've had a Redditor give me a hard time before saying that I just shouldn't commute then, why not live closer to work? That'd be great if it was possible to afford a decent place to live in the area I work. Why not find a job closer to home? Once again, would be awesome if I could find one that pays me the salary I make at my current one. Catch 22. Honestly, I pay an arm and a leg to have a vehicle with gas, tax, insurance, tolls, way more than I did with a $170 monthly transit pass. But my time is also worth money, so is my freedom of movement, and my safety (don't even get me started on transit safety...or lack thereof)."

From what I remember reading, only transport trucks really damage roads when they drive on them. i don't have a link or anything offhand.(well here is one)  http://www.vabike.org/vehicle-weight-and-road-damage/  So whats your brilliant solution then, get rid of all the trucks? Then how will you get your beard cream, spandex and ironic t-shirts delivered?"
vancouver,3ccfwf,corsairofdoom,2,Mon Jul 6 23:30:07 2015 UTC,"The wear on the road is proportional to the 4th power of the mass of the vehicle. Something like M4. If you increase the mass by a factor of 2 you increase the wear by a factor of 24 = 16 which is huge. That 20-fold difference mentioned in the article leads to a 204 = 160000-fold increase in the wear and tear of the road. So yes, cars are pretty negligible at this point."
vancouver,3ccfwf,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,-3,Tue Jul 7 03:29:43 2015 UTC,How does 'pricing things' become 'getting rid' of things?
vancouver,3ccfwf,leidend22,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"When you ""price"" things you put pressure on those users who are being priced to find alternatives that cost less.  And of course the less people/vehicles being priced, the less revenue so you have to ""price"" the remaining ones all that more aggressively, which leads to more people finding alternatives, which leads to less revenue so you have to raise prices more...."
vancouver,3ccfwf,RunsOverCyclists,0,Tue Jul 7 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"That's the case when you're relying on that revenue for some other purpose, but if it's what's paying for maintenance it's a different thing.  You can approach the diminishing returns problem from several directions. If you find that the cost of maintaining capacity  is in excess of willingness to pay for that capacity, then the sensible response would be to reduce capacity. Obviously, you can't start taking lanes off the Port Mann Bridge, but if we're talking about comprehensive road pricing then it's much easier to abandon a lane of if it's not earning it's keep.  For the same reason, there are relatively few four-track railroads around any more.   And in the end, if our heavy truck users ( or 30 tonne double bus riders, for that matter) find a way to do their business with out offloading the cost of heavy trucks onto society, we're doing alright"

vancouver,3ccfwf,kraptastic,5,Tue Jul 7 05:12:10 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't just the wear and tear... it is the construction, maintenance, signage, painted lines, lighting and use of space that cyclists use (in the case of segregated cycling routes or just using existing paved roads).  Second, all people - even cyclists and pedestrians - benefit from our roads.  Best of luck getting a fire truck, ambulance, bus, furniture delivery, or right-of-ways for sewer, water, hydro, gas, etc."

I go fishing, hunting, canoeing,  and hiking on a regular basis.  And I can do it at the drop of a hat.  When you use a bicycle and try to force that on people around you, it creates a very small way of thinking that fails to see the bigger picture. It causes a greater divide in income levels and encourages poverty.  I know these are things you don't want to hear. Riding a bicycle is a fun recreational activity for many people. But there is also an agenda behind creating a population that has less freedom and opportunities.  What side of the divide do you want to be on?"

You kind of assume everyone thinks like you and aspires to drive around, but that isn't the case. If you actually tried cycling around the city you'd be surprised at how relaxing and practical it actually is- I wouldn't have believed it until trying it either. I mean yea you can't cycle into the city from the suburbs realistically, but I don't think that kind of commute no matter the method is preferable to living closer to where you work.

vancouver,3ccfwf,RunsOverCyclists,2,Tue Jul 7 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"Suppose you have been eating from a buffet. Not just any buffet... The only one for thousands of miles. You had a choice to eat the bean sprouts, but you always preferred corn on the cob.  One day, there are several more selections of bean sprouts and corn has a surcharge added to it. If you want to have corn with your meal, you'll have to pay extra.   The owners of the buffet feel that people should eat bean sprouts because they feel it is healthier for everyone collectively. They also say that it's better for everyone's bottom line. But people still want to eat corn. It has more of the nutrients they need. The owners cannot stop serving corn. It is vital and there would be an outrage if they did.  Instead, they continue to make corn more expensive while making the bean sprouts easier to get. They do this over a number of years despite the fact that people keep lining up for corn, not bean sprouts. People get frustrated and angry because getting the corn would be much simpler if they would simply put more of it out. But the buffet owner does not budge. He continues to mistreat the corn eaters. He puts out undercooked and overcooked corn. He puts out rotten corn. He points and says the corn is here, the same as it ever was, but recommends people eat the bean sprouts instead.  The small number of people who prefer the bean sprouts side with the buffet owner and feel that the corn eaters are making it harder to eat the bean sprouts. They assault the corn eaters on a regular basis. They want to make it nearly impossible for the average person to eat corn. If people want to eat corn, they should move elsewhere, they argue.  Over time, people do leave. It's too expensive to eat corn here. The economy suffers and the buffet owners can't stay in business without charging everyone more money to eat at a table. If you're eating bean sprouts and nothing else, you can just get by. If you're eating corn, you're priced out. You can only stay long enough to grab a couple spoonfuls before getting kicked out.   The buffet owner's name is Gregor Robertson, the corn eaters are people who need to drive, and the people eating the bean sprouts are the bicyclists."

I think that would be awesome. Everyone with access to a car drives to work for a week. Even if they normally cycle or take transit.  I'm not a magic scientist guy but I'd bet that if we put 1 or 2 extra hundred thousand cars on the road for the week during rush hour people might realise how they benefit from transit and cycling infrastructure, even if they don't directly use it themselves."

It's just stupid when one side is happy to throw the other under the bus despite not acknowledging that some people need to use a car/truck and others need to use a bus/train/boat/bike.  Cars somewhat fund transit, and transit users somewhat fund the roads cars use. Neither is going away anytime soon and both systems need each other to work."
