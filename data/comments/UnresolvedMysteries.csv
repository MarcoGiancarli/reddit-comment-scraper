Around last year there was a new truck stop built by one of the main streets that's also a highway, and since then these girls have been disappearing. I've heard that they also think these are linked to some murders in Columbus and Portsmouth, which this highway has direct leads to. I'm not sure if you can get to Charleston from this highway since I've never been there, but it does make sense. I read in one of the articles that one of the women disappeared after she said she met this trucker somehow and they were going to go to Texas together. I doubt the police around here will do anything with this info, though, because they really suck and won't do shit. If this is the guy, and I hope it is, I'm really glad because now I'll be able to actually have a life outside once in a while without my mother having a heart attack."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,napoleona,18,Mon Jul 20 04:32:12 2015 UTC,"I changed my search terms and found an article from November 13, 1953 titled ""TWO ABOARD PLANE OBJECT OF SEARCH"" but I'd have to shell out money to see if it mentions them or not. It would be interesting to see if there was either a genuine incident and the names got changed in the story, or if a real plane crash was the jumping-off-point for a fabrication."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,Bluecat72,15,Mon Jul 20 05:14:21 2015 UTC,What publication is it from? I can see if it's part of the database I was using...
UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,napoleona,8,Mon Jul 20 06:07:21 2015 UTC,The Los Angeles Times.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,Bluecat72,12,Mon Jul 20 14:23:34 2015 UTC,I haven't been able to verify their existence either. Every other article or book I've looked at seems to point back to Williamson or the tabloid magazine.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,napoleona,27,Mon Jul 20 04:43:55 2015 UTC,"So I used a different database (the one I used before had NYT, LA Times, etc) that catalogs more regional papers and did find an article about them.  Racine Journal Times, 12/2/53.  Pretty much the same content as the tabloid article linked in the op.  It does say ""Law officers at Los Angeles are reported to have taken a dim view of the ""saucer kidnapping"". They warned Mrs. Wilkinson that both men might be in for a prison term if it is shown they ""stole"" the plane"".  The other results that reference their names are articles about unsolved plane crashes, nothing new about then ever followed the initial story.  So it does seem as if these were actual people who flew and went missing (or pretended).  If they really did go missing Mrs. Wilkinson didn't do their cause any favors by going public with the conspiracy theory, I'm sure that instantly turned off the police., who didn't seem all that interested in investigating in the first place."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,cobalt_coyote,2,Mon Jul 20 06:55:40 2015 UTC,"What was this plane worth at that time?  Was it seriously worth stealing, and, say, selling to someone across the border who'd have it repainted and renumbered?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,napoleona,3,Mon Jul 20 16:18:17 2015 UTC,"I doubt they stole the plane for a profit.  Seems like a very inefficient way to do it!  It was a single-engine Cessna, can't imagine anyone could live off the sale of that for very long."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,whiskyfucker,3,Mon Jul 20 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"Stealing airplanes in the first world is very rarely a good idea.    Best you could do is find a mechanic that would be willing to strip it down, but aviation is a reliability small community, and word gets around fast."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,OldString,10,Tue Jul 21 02:37:54 2015 UTC,Sounds a bit like the SS Ourang Medan story in that regard.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dwfqp,dethb0y,6,Mon Jul 20 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"They likely got disoriented and flew either into a remote location or into water. Even experienced pilots can get disoriented and end up going the wrong way for miles.   If the plane was anything like a Cessna 140 then it would have a cruise speed of about 100 mph. Let's assume he pulls 80 average. that's a range of 240 miles the plane could have gone down in.   That the wreckage hasn't been found says it's either high in a mountain, deep in a forest, or underwater. I'm voting underwater.   I mean really the bigger mystery would be if these two didn't meet a bad end due to ill-preparedness and lack of skill."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,JamesRenner,16,Sun Jul 19 15:00:49 2015 UTC,"Having listened to the first episode, I think this podcast needs to be reworked in order to appeal to a wide audience. For an episode titled ""Introduction"", it contained way too many disparate facts and not enough story to tie them together or, more importantly, to give a general audience unfamiliar with the case a reason to care about those facts.   And I assume the podcasters are hoping to attract a general audience, since they repeatedly disparage the niche audience they're most likely to attract: ""armchair detectives"", unabashedly depicted as obsessive, unreliable, and in some cases malicious. Alienating your built-in audience is a huge risk even if your podcast is very good.  This podcast is not very good. It's a jumble of names, dates, nonlinear events, speculation and disclaimers, and meta observations about a case this hypothetical general audience still hasn't had explained to them. Ten minutes in, they've heard Maura Murray's date of birth, physical description, and age twice, but only a single sentence of story saying only that she crashed her car and then disappeared. Arguably, that's the hook; but by itself, it's not enough of one to hang the narrative on.   And this IS a narrative podcast, or should be, despite the choice to format it as a conversation. The story is the star here, not the hosts, but unfortunately the story is buried under a disorganized discussion of details that can only be confusing for anyone who isn't familiar with the case. And the hosts insert too much commentary on those details, giving the audience little chance to process them uninfluenced before asserting their own opinions.   Ultimately, the effect is of eavesdropping on two guys discussing a case they both know intimately, with occasional hints that they know you're listening and want you to think better of them than of those other people on the internet talking about this same thing. Too much time is spent on why they're doing this podcast, when what the audience actually wants to know is why they should care about what happened to Maura Murray. A single paragraph's worth of narration hooking the audience into the mystery would've been much more valuable than 40 minutes of a discussion that audience can't be expected to follow.  TL;DR Too little story and too much data to appeal to a general audience; too hostile to mystery enthusiasts to appeal to the niche. Maybe I was mistaken in expecting this to be a narrative of the Maura Murray case, rather than the commentary track for a documentary I haven't seen; but I'd much rather listen to the former, and I expect so would most people.   EDITED TO ADD: I avoided explicitly comparing this podcast to Serial because I don't think that's a very useful criticism in and of itself. But since it's described as ""serial-style"", and I expect at least some people would take that to mean ""Serial-style"" even if that wasn't the intention, I will say this much: Serial isn't just great because it's about a compelling mystery. Serial is great because it presents that mystery with expert storytelling, tight writing and editing, and narration that lends a voice and perspective to the narrative without being intrusive or distracting. That, as much as a juicy mystery, is what Serial fans are looking for in the next Serial."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,asheswrites,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:08:59 2015 UTC,I just listened to it and I agree. I am fairly familiar with the case and didn't mind the disorganized details but they discussed the scene where her car was found quite a bit and with many random details. It might have been better to come from a wider angle.
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Danielle_Spring,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:57 2015 UTC,"I would agree that the first ep should've given more of a broad general overview. All we get is girl had problems, disappeared after wrecking her car, some debate about the logistics of how the accident might've gone down (and the role of the alcohol, whether booze bottles were found in the car, etc.), and that tidbit about Fred telling her to put a rag in her tailpipe. We don't get anything about her legal troubles, relationships with her family and boyfriend, any kind of a timeline of the day she disappeared, etc."

UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Surferboy,17,Mon Jul 20 21:01:51 2015 UTC,"I listened to the first episode but I don't think I'll continue listening. It's an interesting case but the podcast just isn't keeping my attention. However, I will tune in to the documentary when it's released."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,ocolmain,2,Sun Jul 19 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"Not bad, but they talk a bit slow. I put it on 1.25 speed and I found it easier to listen to."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Hysterymystery,2,Mon Jul 20 22:04:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I went to 1.5x by the halfway point because I wanted to hear the whole thing before reviewing it, but there was no way I was making it 20 more minutes. Especially with all the trailing off and the ""I think"" and ""I believe"" and such that made it sound like they forgot their notes.   This is another reason I think podcasts like this one are better served by tightly written narration rather than a discussion style format. There are just so many details and angles to this case, it needs to be presented as clearly as possible."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,asheswrites,13,Tue Jul 21 03:18:28 2015 UTC,"So I guess it's looking like Fred wanted to see the car so he could remove the rag from the tailpipe, and when he realized he wouldn't be able to, he made up a story about how he'd told her to put it there? Have to say, that makes Fred seem a thousand times shadier than any questionably apocryphal story about finding a nudie magazine with pictures of his nieces in it or whatever."

UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,3,Sun Jul 19 19:39:16 2015 UTC,"But here's a question... IF we assume there's a good chance Fred put the rag in there, how does this fit in with the theory that Maura chose (and in fact successfully managed) to disappear of her own volition, as I presume you still believe? It seems to me the only reason to sabotage Maura's car is if he had some type of villiany in mind. If so, wouldn't he have been following her (or at least keeping tabs on her) on the night in question? And if he was hanging around that night, after sabotaging her car, what are the odds he didn't have anything to do with her disappearance?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,4,Mon Jul 20 00:48:59 2015 UTC,No clue. But the only reason to give a reason for the rag to be there is to explain why his prints are on it.
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Hysterymystery,4,Mon Jul 20 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed! But again, I would ask how that squares with the theory that Maura disappeared voluntarily.  I guess what I'm getting at is that your two main threads of inquiry (Maura disappearing voluntarily vs. her dad being shady) seem incompatible to me. Fred just being a shady guy in general could help explain why his daughter would want to disappear, sure, but if the implication of that rag in the tailpipe is that he intended his daughter harm... I'm just wondering what your ultimate theory is going to be. Did he intend to disable her car, but didn't count on there being a tandem driver who would spirit her away to safety?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,JohnApples1988,2,Mon Jul 20 01:37:21 2015 UTC,Anything is possible. The rag could have been in the tailpipe from the time she left UMass. And he was there the day before.
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,3,Mon Jul 20 01:45:27 2015 UTC,An alternate possibility is that he thought it was a possibility she might run away and he wanted to make her car break down so she couldn't. :-(

UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,deanywinchester,3,Sun Jul 19 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I think an introduction episode should be that - an introduction.  This first episode meandered all over the shop which was confusing. And I hope we're not going to get a lot of score settling against random web board commenters which the snark about 'armchair detectives' and their misinforming suggested.   However, the first episode of many of my favourite podcasts weren't great and they often get better as people work out how to do it so I'll continue listening.  I echo other's concerns about the psychic babble though.  One thing. I am very confused about the rag in the tailpipe. It was presented as something self-evidently 'shady' which ... OK? I don't drive so I have no idea - bad advice perhaps but I'm missing the significance. I've read the thread and I'm not sure why he would need an excuse for his fingerprints to be on a rag (if indeed they could recover fingerprints from the rag) - it's his daughter's car.  I don't see how fingerprints anywhere on it of the father would be particularly incriminating.    Anyhow, perhaps it will be explained."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,legends444,3,Mon Jul 20 08:16:18 2015 UTC,"I will check this out.   Just to add to the other people throwing out their theories here, this is mine. I think that Maura was planning to leave, whether short or long term I am unsure. She made all the necessary preparations to leave town though. I think she had a friend following her. I think she planned to at some point ditch her car (again, I don't know if short term or long term) somewhere out of the way and ride the rest of the way to their destination in a friend/relative's vehicle. I think she got more tipsy than she intended to and was met with a bit of a stickier situation than she planned. I don’t think she crashed on purpose or that her plans were to crash and stage the scene. I think she got drunk, crashed, and had to improvise. Not wanting to get caught drunk at another crash site, she fled with a friend that was following her. Maybe this pushed her over the edge and she was only planning a temporary vacation, but then decided to make it a permanent one? That's sort of my theory."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,clancydog4,3,Mon Jul 20 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"This is the most probably theory, in my opinion. Except, I think her friend/family was actually in front of her when she crashed."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,legends444,2,Mon Jul 20 17:31:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. When I said her friend was following, it never dawned on me that she may have followed someone else, but that seems just as plausible to me. I'm curious whether there is something about the scene or sequence of events specifically that makes you think she was following someone else though, just out of curiosity."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,clancydog4,3,Mon Jul 20 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"The fact that she was on the side of the road, waiting for five minutes. If they'd been behind her, they could have stopped right there. If they were in front, they would have had to turn around, and because of the snow banks they couldn't turn around until 116. To get there and back would have taken 5 - 7 minutes."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,legends444,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:21 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense. I forgot that she had been seen/talked to while she was waiting until you mentioned her waiting for 5 minutes. I definitely subscribe to this theory.
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,clancydog4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:58 2015 UTC,Do you think she planned to leave to start a new life with a boyfriend?
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,rabidelectronics,4,Tue Jul 21 08:47:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like this would have been more interesting if they weren't so hesitant to talk about different theories or their opinions? Whenever the one guy would say something like ""so maybe this happened"", the other guy would immediately say ""well we don't KNOW that"". I mean, yeah, of course you don't, no one does. Maybe it's just because I've researched this case a lot and I know the details, but I prefer it when people lay out the facts but then also talk about what they personally think about a case. I'll probably give it another shot to see if the next episode holds my attention more."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,clancydog4,11,Mon Jul 20 00:16:37 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't understand why people find this case particularly interesting. Can someone let me in on the intrigue? I know all of the details, I'm just unsure what has everyone so hooked."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,legends444,29,Sun Jul 19 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"i;m surprised you know all the details and aren't intrigued.  it's a very interesting mystery, imo - not only why is she missing, but why was she emailing professors saying she'd be out for a while and driving hundreds of miles away - what was she doing?  the phone call she got at work that apparently made her really emotional right before she left - what was that about?  something was going on in her life or in her mind that we don't know about - she withdrew almost all her money, lied to professors saying there was a death in the family and she'd be gone for awhile, drove hundreds of miles away after buying a bunch of booze,  and then she disappeared in a very short amount of time from when she was last seen begging for the authorities not to be contacted and when they actually showed up.  there are so many mysteries in one - what was she doing and why, and then what happened to her?  and are they related?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,clancydog4,8,Sun Jul 19 16:47:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I kind of see the intrigue now. We know she was either abducted or died from her injuries. I think the pre-crash stuff is all pretty bland though. She had an erratic history with the law/emotions and did something that was complete irrational.....to me that is completely rational!"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,legends444,15,Sun Jul 19 16:57:31 2015 UTC,"well the other theory, given her actions leading up to it, lead a lot of people to think that she didn't die and wasn't abducted, but rather planned to disappear.  i.e. have someone follow her and pick her up after she crashes her car and start anew somewhere.  so there are a few theories that are all fairly viable given the strangeness of her actions leading up to the disappearance.  that is ultimately where the intrigue lies for a lot of us - what exactly was she planning - telling her professors she'd be gone for awhile, withdrawing a lotta money, and leaving town without telling anything to any of her friends or roommate or anything.  then disappears hundreds of miles away.  very weird"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,clancydog4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think the walking away from her life angle explains how she disappeared after the accident. That may have been her original motive for doing all of the stuff, but doesn't crashing your car badly and having injuries put a dent in that plan? How would she continue her trip to her destination? Wouldn't she have to buy a new car when she had no money? What about the injuries?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,bike_whisperer,10,Sun Jul 19 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"No no, the theory is that she had someone in on the plan with her - she crashed her car on purpose (if i remember correctly, it wasn't a horrible accident and she wasn't particularly injured when someone stopped and asked if she was ok) and willingly got into someone elses car who was in on the plan with her and they continued on. like framing your own disappearance, kinda.  Either that or there was someone else in on it driving another car, she accidentally crashed, and the person in the other car simply picks her up and they continue on.  the most prevalent theory is that she moved to Canada, i think.  regardless, it's an intriguing mystery because of how much mystery there is - if we can figure out what she was doing leading up to the accident, it could very well help us to figure out what happened after the accident.  it's just a very complex mystery with a lot of angles.  idk how ya can't see how it's intriguing after everything i've told ya.  like another user said, it's like a double mystery"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,legends444,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think she planned to crash her car, but rather was following someone in another car with whom she was going to stash her car somewhere temporarily and leave town for a while. She got a little too tipsy and crashed on accident. Then they had to improvise, but ultimately she fled the scene with whoever she was following once they got further down the road and realized she was no longer behind them, turned around, and picked her up to flee the scene.   I don't get everyone's theory that she crashed on purpose. Too dangerous, she was obviously drinking, and too convoluted. She was on her way out of town and got drunk and crashed and fled."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Theguywhofingeredyou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:33 2015 UTC,"Either that or there was someone else in on it driving another car, she accidentally crashed, and the person in the other car simply picks her up and they continue on.   That's the theory I was referring to with that sentence."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,ElectricGypsy,0,Mon Jul 20 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"I don't see how crashing your car adds anything to your ability to escape. Why couldn't she just hitch a ride from her friend to begin with. What does crashing your car in an accident accomplish? It makes it more mysterious which means there are more questions which means there's more attention on your case, which you don't want. Disappearing in the middle of the night would have been much more incognito."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Reckoner525,9,Sun Jul 19 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"it means the entire investigation will center on where you crash your car and it will be easy to say ""oh, she just got picked up and killed or wandered off and died in the wilderness.""  as opposed to what you are saying.or maybe she was running away with someone else in another car and she accidentally crashed her car so she just got in the other persons. it's just a theory - i'm not saying it's true, but it adds to the mystery for sure.  her actions leading up to the disappearance are bizarre.   ya can poke holes in every theory out there about what happened to Maura Murray - that's part of why it's such an interesting/complex case.  there are so many different little mysteries that no one theory is perfect.  you're proving that yourself through this discussion"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,hotelindia,9,Sun Jul 19 17:33:16 2015 UTC,I disagree. Theories can be compared according to how rational they are given the totality of the evidence and also the number of assumptions they make. This theory about her wanting to start a new life by purposefully crashing her car has so many side components that are unverified that would have to be true for the overall story concerning the physical evidence and facts to work.
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,SloppyPrecision,5,Sun Jul 19 17:39:00 2015 UTC,"I do not believe the crash was planned. The tandem driver saw it, turned around, picked her up. Got out of there before the police arrived and just decided to ditch the vehicle instead of dealing with law enforcement."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,bwalsh312,4,Sun Jul 19 18:12:04 2015 UTC,"well ignore that then - assume there was someone in on the plan with her that was in another car.  she accidentally crashed, other driver picks her up, and they go on.  that is much more conceivable, no?  don't get caught up in that 1 theory - that's entirely missing the point i'm making.  the point i'm making is there are so many little mysteries at play here that there are multiple theories which have merit and holes.  that's what makes it an intriguing case"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,springheeledjane,8,Sun Jul 19 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"What does crashing your car in an accident accomplish?    It makes the whole scenario seem like it was an accident, which would remove your responsibility. What I mean is that if she had hitched a ride from a friend like you say, it would have appeared as if she had actually planned to disappear, which she might have wanted to avoid... I guess because then people would still search for her, believing her to be still alive. Maybe you can disappear more easily when others suspect you to be dead.   Sorry if it's obvious/doesn't make sense,  I'm not very good at explaining myself."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,hamdinger125,2,Sun Jul 19 17:46:31 2015 UTC,"But there's this GIANT mystery around her right now due to the fact that she may have disappeared from a crash. If you die in a crash, everyone expects your body or at least some part of it in the general vicinity. If there is no body, it's a MAJOR red flag.  It would be much more under the radar to just run away. You are an adult, so your family cannot do anything legal to find you if you make it known that you are ceasing contact with you. I would be awake much more at night if a killer could have taken away someone I loved rather than if that person simply ran away."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,ElectricGypsy,3,Mon Jul 20 03:33:23 2015 UTC,"You pretty much summed up why this is not interesting to me in particular.

But he'll that applies to tons of cases."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,happilythree,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:37:53 2015 UTC,Excellent post.    Did anyone ever find out what the phone call was about that made her so emotional?
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,legends444,20,Mon Jul 20 10:54:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly the same here.  This is the first case I saw when I found this sub, and was amazed it is viewed as one of the big ones in unresolved mystery lore.   Girl decides to take holiday.  Lies to professors about some emergency so it doesn't look so bad. Takes college books and forms for use in helping father make insurace claims - shows clear desire to return. Crashes car, possibly whilst drinking.  After 2 previous accidents, panics. Dies of exposure or possibly is abducted.   The only mystery I can see is the possible abduction.  People trying to suggest a deliberate faked death, or some weird muck-raking I read suggesting bad things about her father, just seem to be looking for something that isn't there.  I mean it's not impossible, but it seems to need a lot of whole cloth to work (to mangle a metaphor).  I enjoy friendly discussion and am open to changing my mind, so if you think I am wrong please explain, don't downvote."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,prof_talc,14,Sun Jul 19 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree. She crashes, she's in a bad mental state, possibly intoxicated, walks down the road a bit, eventually detours into the woods, and either gets lost or gets too far away from the road to make it back before hypothermia sets in.  A possible sighting puts her 5 miles east of the accident that night, headed east, a direction which would take her into an in increasingly remote, heavily wooded area. If she left the road a few miles later, and walked a few more miles into the woods, she'd be all but impossible to find."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Reckoner525,5,Sun Jul 19 19:36:00 2015 UTC,Death from exposure in the woods seems the most likely outcome to me as well. Can someone who believes otherwise give a summary as to why this is not the prevailing hypothesis?
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Liz-B-Anne,6,Sun Jul 19 23:59:21 2015 UTC,"If she was intoxicated/injured enough to wander into the woods and die, she probably wouldn't have been physically able to make it far enough into the woods for her to be unfindable by searchers."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,embossedsilver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:40:23 2015 UTC,"She was a runner, though, and had just been in an incident that would have raised her adrenaline (the crash, and then knowing cops would be coming to scene.) It's easy for me to imagine her running into a wooded area she didn't know, assuming she'd come out on the other side, not realizing the woods were that extensive.   As for her being found by searchers eventually... Remember, there are quite a few missing persons cases where the bodies have been lost in a wooded area, and found quite near where they were last scene. The Jamison family comes to mind. I believe John Glasgow was found in an area that had been extensively searched, too.   Not saying this is the only way she could have disappeared, but the 'died of exposure' theory is far from impossible."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,Liz-B-Anne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree- those woods are thick, and no one knows for sure exactly where she entered the woods or which direction she went.  People are often lost in the woods and never found, or found years later very close to where they went missing but completely overlooked by search teams."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,belledejour43,2,Mon Jul 20 23:54:25 2015 UTC,She couldn't have walked very far.  I would think that there was an extensive search on those woods.  Someone would have found her by now.
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,freestbeast,2,Mon Jul 20 10:53:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's hard - I really get into these cases, but trying to subscribe meaning to someone's movements after the fact can be really difficult. I think of that with Maura Murray and Steven Koecher (sp?). So much of the mystery surrounding the cases is around their actions the days before they went missing, but if someone tried to nail down my movements within a couple day period using whatever random cell records or credit card history, I feel like it would be hard to understand the random stores I may have visited without even making a purchase, or dropping something by a friend's house that no one ever knew I borrowed, or whatever else.   That said, I do think that her ""holiday"" wasn't so much for fun and leisure but to escape some of the trouble she was getting herself in at school/in her personal life. Maybe she felt she needed a mental escape? I think it's highly unlikely she was abducted because it would have to be such an opportunistic crime, where as the exposure makes the most sense as you say."
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,imbuche,2,Mon Jul 20 01:17:48 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU. You very nicely tied all of the KNOWN FACTS together into ONE singular explanation.

UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,legends444,2,Sun Jul 19 16:37:01 2015 UTC,"I sort of assumed she was heading into the mountains to ski/snowboard or snowshoe or something. She was on her way to Stowe, right?   Is it known what happened to the rest of the booze she bought?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3du8f7,bike_whisperer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:34:16 2015 UTC,"2 - She was taking a vacation or break because of stress in her life.  We know she researched the Vermont and New Hampshire area, and then drove there.  We also know, crucially, that she looked at a place that she had visited with her family.  I don't like to project personally onto cases, but I've dreamt of taking off for a few days when life gets too much, and (before I ever knew who Maura Murray was) I knew I would always have gone to a place we took a lot of family holidays when I was young."

I'd rather here some of the less well-publicized cases than this one for the millionth time.   (Also, I'm pretty certain she died in those woods, and while I hope they find her body and I suppose that lowers the mystery because I doubt we'll ever know what happened)."

I know that it was more common to let kids be on their own at that time, but the laundry list of places Louis liked to go to and things he liked to do reads more like an adult's routine. The fact that his parents continued to let him go around totally unsupervised after he told them he had been molested by that couple (who had kidnapped him no less!) is pretty alarming. I don't think it was even terribly neglectful parenting... it's just really weird. Tell me if I'm being over the top, but as much as I'm for letting kids explore and be on their own, it seems like his parents basically didn't keep an eye on him at all."

I doubt they had anything to do with it (and it looks like they were investigated and cleared), but this just sits wrong. I know it was different in the 80s, I was there and also had the run of the neighborhood as a kid, but this is strange. He had learning and emotional disabilities, was described as ""timid,"" was only 7, was already being bullied by at least a few older kids, stayed out until 9:30p regularly, and most importantly had reported that he had been molested. And his parents still thought it was fine for him to wander around on his own? Regardless of if the molestation was real or not, that's crazypants."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,whinge_chime,0,Tue Jul 21 00:45:43 2015 UTC,I disagree.  The babysitter has value.  Someone needs to make sure the kid has a nutritious snack after school.  What happens if he's playing kickball in the backyard and somebody skins their knee?  Some adult needs to dress the wound.    Overparenting is sometimes more dangerous than underparenting

UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,softerr--,15,Sun Jul 19 11:47:31 2015 UTC,I think it's likely that something happened to him. A seven year old doesn't (or shouldn't) have the knowledge to completely fabricate molestation unless they're exposed to it. He may have been making up the circumstances under which it took place (a fictional couple or a fictional timeline ) but I don't think he would know anything about sex at such a young age in order to completely create a scenario.

There's actually been a number of scientific studies about this and a bunch of documentaries about kids fabricating molestation stories. We were shown a number of case studies in first year psychology. Anyways, I just wanted to point this quick science fact out. Also, not saying this is what happened in this case either."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,annaflixion,12,Sun Jul 19 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"Fabricating them wholesale or being led by an adult? Because it seems weird to me that a kid in the 80s would be able to do that without a little leading. We were definitely given the 'don't go with strangers who ask you to find a puppy' routine but not much about possible sex assault. I know a lot of kids were led in the witchcraft panic stuff, but they didn't just suddenly have knowledge of satanic rituals; the adults asked leading questions. And a seven year old with learning disabilities . . . it just seems unlikely to me, though not impossible."

I don't know, I guess it looks to me like we might have that same issue we so often see where there's a lot of underbrush / greenery to hide an injured person, and if he was unresponsive he could have been missed and just never found.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,From_Pennsylvania,8,Mon Jul 20 16:06:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this.  What a strange case!   Who lets a 7 year old child stay out roaming the neighborhood till 9:30pm at night??!!  I wonder what made them reopen the case in 2004?  Were there new leads?
UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,swanpredictor,14,Sun Jul 19 05:13:50 2015 UTC,"As a child I stayed out that late, often even later, on a regular basis, especially through out the summer while school was not on session.  It was common among my neighborhood for other kids too to be out that late.  It was actually more uncommon not to be allowed out to play throughout the neighborhood at night.  I lived in a semi-rural suburb and this was during the 1990s.  This is probably more uncommon now but it was completely normal in my area during the time petiod that I was a child."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,jinantonyx,12,Sun Jul 19 05:26:53 2015 UTC,"I was a 90s child and had a ""come home for mealtimes"" type schedule. Also the rule was always be home by the time the sun goes down - 9:30ish in summer."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,verifiedshitlord,8,Sun Jul 19 08:13:34 2015 UTC,"We had similar rules.  Home for dinner, then we could go back out until sundown, which could be as late as 8 or 8:30 in the summer.  Unless we had prior permission to go further, we had another rule:  we had to be ""within whistle distance.""  My dad would stand in the driveway and whistle for us...you could hear it all over the block.    He always joked that whenever he whistled, two children and one dog had better come running."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,kpuderbaugh,4,Sun Jul 19 12:02:45 2015 UTC,^  I envy this so much.   I had to in bed and not talking to my sibling (shared room) by 7 till I was 12. That was moved down to 7:30 at 12 basically thrown out the window when I was 15 which was such a fcking relief..
UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,verifiedshitlord,5,Sun Jul 19 23:43:19 2015 UTC,That's awful! Even my five-year-old isn't expected to be in bed that early.  So are you more of a night-owl or a morning person now?
UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,kpuderbaugh,4,Mon Jul 20 00:19:27 2015 UTC,When I was younger I stayed up way late because I had been forced to go to bed so early for so long. I feel most alert around mid afternoon. I don't say up past 11 much anymore.

I know it was partly so we'd leave her the eff alone. It's not like we'd sit next to her elbow and fight though.   My mother was extremely controlling and would guilt trip the shit out of us if we tried to say no.. for example she picked our clothes out for us till we were in middle school. If we tried to say we wanted to wear something else.. ah actually i don't want to go there!   My sister though... she gives her daughter no boundaries at all. My niece goes to bed when she wants, she eats whatever she wants, she is never disciplined... she is going to be more a hellion than my sister was after we were free of our mothers controlling bullshit. My sisters extreme 'permissive' parenting style is just as bad as my parents extreme 'authoritarian' style. This is middle ground!

I also grew up in the 80s and could go where I pleased, but at 7 my bedtime was 9p, regardless of the summer evening sunshine. I have a specific memory of looking down (with a Grumpy Cat face, because why do I have to go to bed when it is light out?) from our second story bedroom window, spying on the grown-ups who were having beers and socializing in the back courtyard around 9:15p or so. Someone pointed me out to my stepmom and she screamed at me to lay down and go to sleep. lol.   Anyways, the point is that 7 is young for a kid with learning and emotional disabilities to be running around a town until 9:30p without even a check-in for dinner."

My brother and I were allowed to roam free in the residential area we lived in and some wooded area next to our house. The rules were that we had to be home for meals and when the sun went down or if the weather changed suddenly and we weren't dressed appropriately.   Summer was a fantastic time - I'm close to the polar circle which means the sun's up forever. I only wore shoes if it was raining, I was getting a ton of exercise and slept like a log as soon as my head hit the pillow at night. I feel privileged to have grown up in a time and place where that was the norm."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dsnqj,spacefink,8,Sun Jul 19 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"All I have to say is this is so sad, what a beautiful, naïve child that was allowed to wander alone until 9:30 pm at night. And to think that he hid in a store for 45 minutes because teenagers were chasing/terrorizing an innocent 7 year old. I do believe his story of being molested, because a child knows nothing of sex unless it happens to them, and the added emotional punch of his being friends with an old lady that he spent time with and wanted to live with....I truly hope this is one of those cases where he died shortly after being kidnapped. Poor child."

I've been in Portland for 6 years and I can count on one hand the number of true rain ""storms"" we have had, the vast majority of the time it's just that grey and sprinkling weather you describe, and this year we have a drought with the snow pack on Mt. Hood being far less than it should be.  Edited to add: They actually closed our streams this year for fishing in Oregon, because the lower water levels and record heat are causing stress which is causing death in the fish populations.

Propeller?  Single engine?  Multiengine?  It doesn't even indicate whether or not it's a ding dang helicopter or airplane!

UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,hectorabaya,9,Sun Jul 19 07:17:16 2015 UTC,"Required by who? In the US, you just drive out to the trailhead, pay the use fee if there is one (this is usually done by just dropping cash in a box, rangers stop by once or twice a day to collect it and make sure all the vehicles in the lot have pay stubs in the windows) and set out. I guess they could require it, but it would be unenforceable in the vast majority of our public lands. It is usually posted as advice on the trail information boards at the start of maintained trails, but there's no way to require it.  Definitely best practice, though. And if you do get lost, SIT DOWN AND WAIT FOR RESCUERS. If you've followed those general precautions of letting people know where you'll be and when you'll be back, we'll find you quickly.

Sorry though, I meant that as a rhetorical question for the US (I was half-asleep and not clear). There's just so much public land here and it's so underfunded that even if they technically required it, there'd be no way to enforce it (people already don't pay permit fees for short hikes quite often). We have a lot of public land that people literally live on, they just have to move to another part every 2 weeks (this is usually administered by the BLM and is free; they ask that you request a free camping permit so they know who is out there but again, no way to enforce it). And I'm sure a bit of it is the cultural mindset we have of ""this is our public land, we can do what we want on it"" (which of course isn't true, there are plenty of restrictions but I suspect the NPS/USFS/BLM largely prefer to pick their battles).  I will say though that every actual wilderness class or camp I've been to requires that kind of documentation for solo hikes, but that of course is much easier to control since you have a limited number of participants. And most people in the US don't do any sort of organized stuff like that, they just get out and hike."

All I can think of is that maybe they lived in some kind of cult/commune that didn't trust the police and never registered the girls' births. The mother had a lot of dental work, suggesting a more traditional background. My guess would be that she could  have been a teenage runaway who either wasn't reported missing (more common then than now) or has never been matched to the body for whatever reason.  But honestly the idea of a cult that killed people and has gotten away with it for 35 years isn't all that comforting, either."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,SecondRyan,14,Sun Jul 19 03:03:39 2015 UTC,"Totally plausible theory. Let's say the mom ran away at 16 or 17 in the mid-1960s and joined a cult/commune, where she had the children that were later killed with her in the early 80s. Family or police still looking for her would be seeking a single person, not a mother of two. Thousands of girls ran away in the latter half of the 20th century...this victim is one of those girls."

Even though I'm not in Japan, I can't stop thinking about this one. Just freaking creepy and gross."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,ghost-in-the-void,37,Sat Jul 18 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"Good one. Other than dismemberment, this made this extra scary/horrible:   The body was cut into 20-centimeter pieces using an electric saw, and the muscle was carefully cut away. After this, the body was carefully washed and drained of all its blood; this would require the skills of a highly trained medical doctor. The body was not battered and there were no traces of drugs, so the cause of death could not be determined. There were slight traces of internal bleeding in the muscle, indicating that the man may have been cut while still alive."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,The_Chairman_Meow,80,Sat Jul 18 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"I'm always suspicious of claims that something would require the skills of a ""highly trained medical doctor."" First of all, all medical doctors are ""highly trained."" And for some reason, I seriously doubt something like draining a body of all its blood is something they teach in even the most prodigious medical schools. Draining a body of blood and cutting away muscle is something any butcher or hunter can do. Anyone who's slaughtered a chicken can grasp the concept."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,Durbee,47,Sat Jul 18 21:23:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  This is much more a butcher/hunter thing.  Draining a body of blood and ritualistically slicing and deboning it is more akin to field dressing a deer, cleaning fish or meat processing than to ""skilled medical training."""
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,The_Chairman_Meow,42,Sat Jul 18 22:04:40 2015 UTC,"This fallacy is brought up a lot in unsolved murders, and if I were a sociologist I'd hypothesize that it has its roots in contemporary Jack the Ripper media, where a major theory was that he was a medical doctor.

Not common knowledge in the 1800s, when the Ripper lived. And you'd be really surprised how little people know about anatomy. Seriously surprised. Even today, a lot of people can still mis-label, identify or just flat out fail to place the locations of things like kidney, liver, stomach etc.  Just because you know something doesn't mean it's common knowledge, just because this sub knows something doesn't mean it's common knowledge."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,Durbee,17,Sun Jul 19 09:19:00 2015 UTC,"I might argue the uterus thing in the days of the ripper, but it does seem like something everyone could hazard a guess at locating a woman's womb and come pretty close if taking a literal stab at it.  There was nothing about those cases that struck me as skilled."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,GobtheCyberPunk,7,Sat Jul 18 23:18:22 2015 UTC,"The somewhat more convincing argument is about the ability to find and remove specific organs 1. in the dark and 2. in as little time as 6 minutes IIRC (it's been awhile since I read up on the case).  Either way I'm more inclined toward either a butcher or a barber, since they still had rudimentary medical ability in those days."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,The_Chairman_Meow,11,Sun Jul 19 00:33:10 2015 UTC,There was nothing about those cases that struck me as skilled.   I absolutely agree.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,SeaBones,7,Sat Jul 18 23:25:45 2015 UTC,"It's funny that you pick uterus in this example. I've taken medical anatomy courses with fixed cadavers as well as interned in a morgue with unfixed ones and I was initially surprised that, despite thinking I knew its location, the uterus is surprisingly hard to find. Most textbook anatomy images overblow the scale of it. It depends on medical conditions as well as whether or not the woman has had kids but a uterus itself is typically about the size of a small lime or smaller, and ovaries about the size of a pea connected loosely by a thin string of tissue that can be easily cut through by a scalpel without a trained eye. You could disembowel it, or the ovaries, and have no idea. I'm not saying you're wrong and that an average shmuck couldn't hack up a body with some level of possible precision, but certain things, when muddled with blood and connective tissue, are pretty difficult to separate without a trained eye. The thoracic cavity isn't just some vessel that can be opened up with organs seen easily laying there like in an anatomy drawing, it's more like a muddled mess of connective tissue where you need to separate that all yourself. But yes, I agree that particularly in the case of Jack the Ripper, it doesn't take a medical professional to hack up a woman into a mess with the right tools.   Edits for grammar I was kind of drunk when I wrote this."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,ryan_goslings_smile,5,Sun Jul 19 12:24:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah but those murders happened in 1888 so ""common knowledge""  of the location of the uterus wasn't that at all."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,EscapeFromTexas,10,Sun Jul 19 08:02:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And if you cut a body up into little pieces, where the fuck do they think the blood went? It doesn't just stay put. Of course it's drained away."

To me, that signals that the three of them at least interacted - home invasion gone wrong? I don't know. It seems like a random crime - the daughters weren't even supposed to be home so they couldn't be the target. And if the mother was the target of some kind of premeditated crime, why go through with it when you notice there are 3 cars in front?  I don't see any evidence to suggest Cox had anything to do with anything. I hope he did because he's promised to confess but I find it very unlikely."

I've also listened to some podcasts on the topic and read part of the book (The Franklin Coverup by John DeCamp).  I've always been fascinated by Satanic ritual abuse and its place in American society. I know the Satanic Panic of the '80s/'90s was bullshit, but there seems to be evidence to suggest it exists in some form (just not in the way the religious right/Evangelicals believe).   I think that Satanic ritual abuse, such as the abuse that allegedly happened in the Franklin Coverup, doesn't actually have anything to do with real world Satanism. I think it's, like, an act of intentional depravity or evil, a celebration of debauchery and cruelty.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,happilythree,76,Sun Jul 19 18:00:33 2015 UTC,"The Taconic State Parkway crash  It's not a mystery as to what happened or how, but why. Diane Schuler drove drunk and high but it was known that it wasn't like her to drive while intoxicated and she definitely never would have put the kids in the car in danger. The prevailing theory is that an abscess caused her pain and possibly made her delirious, but it's only speculation. I can't imagine having to live the rest of your life knowing someone you love killed eight people and you'll never know what really caused her to act the way she did.  I do not agree with anything Diane's husband says. I'm basing what I'm saying here off of testimony from family and friends who talked about her dedication to her family and how responsible she was along with the only theory other than she just did it for funsies."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,strange_cargo,48,Sat Jul 18 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting case. The unresolved parts for me are:    Diane had a phone call with her brother, the father of the nieces she killed, while driving that day. The contents of that calk have never been released.  Diane had a 7 hour phone conversation logged on her cell during the time she spent at the camp ground the night before the accident. The person she called has never been identified.  Diane's husband knows more than he's telling. I dont know what he knows, but you can tell by his answers that he's hiding something about that weekend, or their life in general.    EDIT: http://www.topix.com/forum/news/violent-crime/TQSMQ8P7SFE8HJ3IT/p4  Here is the website where I originally read the information on the overnight phone call(s) at the camp ground the night before the crash. It seemed many locals who have connections to the event posted on here at one point or another so I'm not sure how valid the sources are. But if you dig through this forum there are many interesting tidbits.  EDIT 2: http://www.crimeinspector.com/diane-schuler-tragedy-lies-uncovered-updated-2014/  According to this link (a blog with sauce) the call from the night before was 9 mins long. Lots of good info here."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,Julevict,18,Sat Jul 18 20:00:58 2015 UTC,Diane's husband is definitely up to something. That is very evident by the fact that he has claimed she wasn't a drinker and didn't smoke pot when the evidence is very clear that she had and other people had admitted that she did but wasn't an addict. I don't trust him at all.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,AnguisetteAntha,10,Sat Jul 18 20:48:42 2015 UTC,I think that's just him covering his ass so the victims families don't sue him.  I am sure his attorney is putting him up to it.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,Pure_Silver,10,Sun Jul 19 11:04:20 2015 UTC,Which is fucking ridiculous because he's been suing everyone for what his own wife did. I believe he sued the road department for some bullshit reason and he even sued the father of the nieces who were killed because Dianne was driving his van. Dude is a scumbag.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,raphaellaskies,16,Sun Jul 19 17:42:01 2015 UTC,Wasn't the call with her brother when he asked her to stop the car and wait for him to come and pick her up? She left the cell phone on the side of the highway and drove off.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,snideways,56,Sun Jul 19 08:28:53 2015 UTC,"It's interesting you say that Diane was not known to drink or what the theory is an abscess - not that you could be wrong, this side is definitely possible I suppose, but that it is the theory her husband is purporting to be true AFTER the police investigation, and interviews with other family members about Diane's history of drinking came to a completely different conclusion. The only people who are claiming she was never a drinker are through the husband's lawyer and private investigator (I think some of these people were her coworkers, who are also far more likely to have seen her in a drunken state than people she interacted with socially). Even initially, the husband himself admitted that she smoked marijuana from time to time and that she was a drinker, along with many other friends and family and the story only changed once the lawyer and the lawsuits got involved. They also claimed she had medical conditions there were no record of (they tried to say she had a diabetic stroke, but she had only had gestational diabetes years prior), and the autopsy found no record of some of the other random conditions they tried to apply to her.   It must be an awful position for her husband - Diane killed their children and their nieces, and supposedly did it in a way that reflects very poorly on her thus ruining her memory and reputation. Plus, there have been lawsuits thrown both ways for neglect, etc. A medical explanation such as an abscess is an out for him. And how could you ever want to admit your wife could do something so horrible? And, that you essentially enabled her by looking the other way when she did drink or act erratically until it came to a head with something this extreme?  I really think there's no way it was anything other than an intoxicated accident. Even the link you shared disputes all of the claims you listed. ""What Happened to Aunt Diane"" is a really interesting documentary about the story, and there are many news articles detailing the case."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,hitchcocklikedblonds,23,Sat Jul 18 16:41:52 2015 UTC,"The documentary is titled ""There's Something Wrong with Aunt Diane"". It's a really good, haunting film. Highly recommended."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,aeshleyrose,23,Sun Jul 19 04:48:47 2015 UTC,"I really think there's no way it was anything other than an intoxicated accident.   Agreed, I think this was only an 'unresolved mystery' in the short period between Diane crashing the car and the toxicology results coming back. She was drunk and high, with corresponding deleterious effects on her ability to drive, and in her impaired state she made a series of basic errors that ended up killing her and all but one of the other occupants of both vehicles. Similar impaired-driving accidents happen frequently worldwide; this one is only really noticeable because of the large number of victims and the small number of years some of them had lived.  Like you say, the only people saying that this was anything other than a routine DUI accident are people who would benefit socially and/or financially from the waters being muddied - people that don't want to admit that they knew Diane had substance-abuse problems and didn't take the steps that would have lessened the likelihood of such an incident occurring."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,UnicornEnigma,16,Sat Jul 18 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Same. The toxicology (and the call one of her nieces made before the accident, where she told her father that Diane was slurring her words) make it pretty clear what happened. The only reason it's still considered a mystery is because her husband refused to accept the coroner's findings."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,Gonzo1888,13,Sat Jul 18 21:13:02 2015 UTC,I wanna know what was said between her and her brother that he refuses to tell anyone before she did it. Im not saying it changed anything I believe she was drunk but it's strange he won't reveal it considering everything
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,Pris257,8,Sat Jul 18 23:06:43 2015 UTC,Same. She must have said something incredibly damning for him to never have spoken about it even years later.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,PhoenixGrey,13,Sun Jul 19 08:26:08 2015 UTC,"I meant that as she wasn't known to drive while drunk and high. I'll reword it. I don't disagree that it was an intoxicated accident, that's why I said the mystery isn't how the accident occurred, it's why Diane chose to get messed up and drive with her beloved family members in the vehicle."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,PhoenixGrey,10,Sat Jul 18 17:39:56 2015 UTC,But people stated that she didn't seem intoxicated when she left or when she stopped at the gas station... She started acting off while she was in the car.. So could she just have hid it very well or what could have happened..
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,Sugar-waffle,15,Sat Jul 18 18:19:19 2015 UTC,"I don't have an answer for that but they did toxicology tests on her two separate times, I believe at different labs if I remember correctly, and both times it came back that she was high on pot and very drunk."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,Liz-B-Anne,12,Sat Jul 18 18:32:35 2015 UTC,And she had several ounces of undigested vodka still in her stomach. So she was probably drinking while in the car.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,k0m0rebi,5,Sun Jul 19 17:15:42 2015 UTC,It also took her an incredibly long time to get to where she wrecked from the campsite. It should have only taken her about an hour to get home but she was driving around for like 3 hours. Who knows what she was doing that whole time?
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,montmorency_,18,Sun Jul 19 17:46:21 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered if she somehow took an Ambien by mistake and that's what turned her into such a maniac with seemingly no impulse control.    I agree that the husband seems sketchy and probably knows shit he's not telling anyone, but there's a part of me that doesn't think she was that reckless"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,k0m0rebi,18,Sat Jul 18 22:41:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've always wondered that too. People do things on Ambien that make no sense, but they still seem to be functioning more or less normally to people interacting with them. That could be why she decided to drink and smoke with kids in the car.  I agree though, the husband is super sketchy no matter what."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,JohnnyP,4,Sun Jul 19 02:22:23 2015 UTC,I took Ambien for a short while.    According to my husband I would come out of the bedroom and start doing things that seemed completely reasonable until he realized I wasn't responding to him and was doing things like turning the gas stove on but not putting a pan or anything on it etc.    Ambien is the devil.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,k0m0rebi,7,Mon Jul 20 14:45:45 2015 UTC,I can see that for sure. I have insomnia that ranges in severity from mild to severe depending on a few things and I've been on medication for it when it was at its worst. I would never want to be doing anything other than lying around when I took something like that. Even after you wake up you feel really off.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,actually_a_bird,17,Sun Jul 19 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"I saw a theory somewhere that she might have taken Ambien recently, which makes the whole thing a lot easier to understand if its true. People who stay awake after they take Ambien do all kinds of crazy stuff; adding alcohol and pot to the mix would only make the chance of a terrible accident worse."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dqm0c,SunsetCorn,11,Sun Jul 19 00:09:01 2015 UTC,This is a brand new one I haven't read!   What a tragedy. She seems to have a good reputation before the accident so it is really hard to believe she would risk the lives of the children by driving drunk.

I don't think there is any sort of organized school of thought, but this is around the time that most of our 'earliest civilizations' started within a thousand years or so. To my knowledge Gobekli Tepe is the only one that deviates which is dated to have been purposefully buried around 13,000 years ago.   I don't know what you would google either. It just basically marked the begining of the Holocene Epoch and the climate has been gradually warming ever since. That sounds worse, but compared to the 100's of thousands of years before that our climate wasn't stable at all.   We don't know shit about where we came from because sea levels have risen 400 feet since this time. All our history is under water because we've always lived on coasts- corrolating with the MAJOR sudden flood stories in folktales of almost every single early civilization from Inda to Australia to Native Americans and Natives in Peru to bible thumpers in Alabama to this day...

So I looked it up because I didn't understand how an accident could be malicious.   ""Malicious"" in regard to arson doesn't mean you did it intentionally or with ill intent.  Only that you acted in a way that created a great risk of burning.  So you acted in a willfully negligent way is how I interpret it.  I'm not a laywer--I got that from wikipedia's article on Arson.  So maybe ""malice"" here doesn't mean an ill intent.  More that you were willfully inconsiderate of how your disappearance might affect others.  Oh and if you're interested she pled no contest to 2nd degree arson and got 5-years probation."

I've seen: non-family abduction, involuntarily missing, missing, endangered missing, lost/injured missing, and family abduction.  I may be missing one, but I don't think so.  That's why I ask about the country and jurisdiction to which you're referring.

If you follow the link, you'll see the term was actually coined by a woman whose husband ran away. It's not a law enforcement term.  IMO ""maliciously missing"" is way too broad a brush to use for all voluntary disappearances, as OP suggests. The intent isn't always malicious; some people are escaping from abusive situations, hiding from someone who intends to do them harm, or just cutting themselves off from toxic relationships. And, to be fair, Maureen Reintjes doesn't suggest using the term that way either; she's specifically talking about cases where people leave dependents behind to deal with their obligations."

Many times you'll see somebody making a deathbed confession based on feelings of guilt for crimes they didn't commit but feel responsible for (not saying this was the case with your example).  If there's no evidence trying the person to the crime, it would still be a difficult case to pursue due to the stresses one feels in near death experiences that may cause them to ""admit"" guilt."

(In, like, the aliens way, not in a nice ""we'll always be together"" way.)  No contradicting you; personal stories aren't really an argument either way. I'm not a UFO buff or anything, but just to play out the thought for a minute, I do wonder about the things that people would want their family to know on their deathbed. For me, personally, it would make sense not to tell my hypothetical kids some big secret government coverup. Trying to imagine it from the perspective of someone in those organizations, I don't really get the impulse to share that kind of thing. There's probably a lot of loyalty to the agency, and not a lot to be gained by telling.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dn8h9,Wuornos,3,Fri Jul 17 17:22:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this!  I live in WA (born and raised) and have always been especially interested in missing persons from my home state.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dn8h9,winnie_bago,2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile (on an antiquated device) so im unable to really use this map to its full ability.  Who created it and why? Is it being used by law enforcement or is it just someone's personal project?  It would be great if someone were able to automate the process of entering the data of other missing persons cases and create a national map.  Im sure it would be of use to law enforcement, professional non-LE investigators, and amateur sleuths."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dn8h9,vajabjab,5,Fri Jul 17 23:14:09 2015 UTC,Is there a reason 18 and 19 year old kids are on this?
UnresolvedMysteries,3dn8h9,TheBestVirginia,6,Fri Jul 17 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"I guess if the map is being used to consider a serial predator or predators, some late teens can look an awful lot younger than they are, so perhaps the info would help with a pattern and/or preference of a certain offender?  Not sure at all."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dn8h9,Uneje,4,Fri Jul 17 19:28:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe they were still in high school, went missing at 17/18 & were only reported at 18/19, had disabilities, etc."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dn8h9,heykenziewannafrack,2,Fri Jul 17 17:47:56 2015 UTC,I suppose I was more or less interested in whether 18 and 19 year olds are considered missing children all over or just included in the map for visualization purposes. I'm guessing the latter.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dj2ix,i_am_the_lizardqueen,74,Thu Jul 16 17:54:51 2015 UTC,Unsolved Mysteries had the absolute perfect tone. Served to both terrify and intrigue. And they had the absolute perfect presenter in Robert Stack...  ...who also served to both terrify and intrigue. :D

UnresolvedMysteries,3dj2ix,angstandennui,4,Fri Jul 17 01:29:45 2015 UTC,I know there was a segment in which a car was stuck on the track and the train collided with it and killed two women and children. Is that it or something else?

UnresolvedMysteries,3dj2ix,shixxy,5,Fri Jul 17 12:50:30 2015 UTC,"I know there are a number of Mysteries at the Museum that deal with train wrecks. One that stands out is a 'spectacle' that was being staged during the wild west era, I believe, in which two trains, sharing the same track, were to collide head-on. They sold tickets to spectators and it was a big deal.   They expected the trains to accordion. But an explosion occurred and many of the spectators were killed. Probably not what you were thinking of, but interesting nonetheless."

She came back to him after some time and told him she wanted to patch things up. Then she just up and disappeared with his kid? I think this happened in the 40/50s. The guy was basically looking for his ex-wife, wondering what had happened to her. It was a really weird story and unfortunately, I don't remember anything else."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dj2ix,queenofkingcity,13,Thu Jul 16 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"One of the best 48 hours I saw was about a guy who would chronically disappear.  And he wasn't a criminal or con-artist or anything like that.  He would move somewhere, create a new identity, get a job, make friends, live there for a few years, and then disappear again.  The people that came to know and care about him would then be left wondering where he went.  Some would be left thinking he was murdered or committed suicide.  One friend actually tracked him down after he had disappeared and discovered him living a new life in a new state.  When confronted he never explained himself or his action only expressing anger that they had tracked him down.  After that he disappeared again.  My guess is this guy had deep emotional issues.  Fear of commitment.  Fear of abandonment.  Feelings of low self-worth and shame.  Unfortunately I saw this so many years ago I don't remember any specific details like his name so if anyone is interested in knowing more you have a great deal of research ahead of you."

He supposedly snuck her out of their work in the bed of his truck.  Anyway, the part that always stuck out to me was that they had found a speck of blood in the guys truck, but were waiting for DNA tests to continue evolving as there was only a tiny amount of blood and they didn't want to mess it up."

I'm all for innocent until proven guilty, but I feel as though there's enough circumstantial evidence to make a decent case.  I'd like this to be on Cold Justice, frankly."

I recall there being several Disappeared episodes in a similar vein, where you pretty much ""knew"" what happened to the person but there just wasn't enough concrete physical evidence to arrest the person responsible, so it was sort of played up as ""who knows what happened...?"""
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Solar_Pons,28,Tue Jul 21 20:37:02 2015 UTC,Ray Gricar....that mystery has layers and layers of intrigue.
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,scandalously,14,Thu Jul 16 20:30:57 2015 UTC,It sure does! It is related to the Sandusky scandal.
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Sixad,10,Thu Jul 16 20:51:21 2015 UTC,I feel fairly certain the Sandusky thing plays into it in some way.
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Hysterymystery,11,Thu Jul 16 22:40:23 2015 UTC,"Its so weird. He retired a few years before the shit hit the fan, but he did refuse to press charges on Sandusky in 1998.  I wonder how many people that hard drive could've taken down."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Stormtrooper_OG-420,4,Fri Jul 17 04:44:13 2015 UTC,"I think some people might assume that Gricar had the ability to pursue a case against whomever he deemed worthy of prosecution, but his position was a very political one, subject to so many behind the scenes wheeling, dealing, requests, orders, and maybe even threats.  I'm inclined to believe that somehow the Sandusky case is in play here.  Maybe not even Sandusky himself, but others who would have been severely affected by all of it coming out."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,TheBestVirginia,3,Sat Jul 18 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"It sorta sounds like a suicide, and he for sure tried hard to fuck his HDD. Maybe he got some pay-offs that would fuck over his entire estate and he just thought to end it before anyone knew so hew family could keep the money.  All of this is pure speculation on my barely-informed part."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Stormtrooper_OG-420,4,Sat Jul 18 04:19:13 2015 UTC,"I'm actually more inclined to believe he went into some type of serious witness protection over suicide.  Maybe it wasn't ""legal"" witness protection, but that he absolutely had to hide because his life was in danger.  I of course didn't know him and so I have no reason really to believe this, but I don't see him as suicidal.  I see him as possibly a man put in an impossible situation and bent on survival and perhaps it came to this.  But I have nothing really to base that on.    Edit: I guess while I'm pondering the possibility that he is in hiding, I should share that if he was ""hidden"" and it was part of something bigger (with others in on it), they would have done a better job of ""staging"" it as a believable suicide (leaving his blood, a note, something).  The absence of such makes me think that if he indeed did run, he did it on his own as a result of a very clandestine threat."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,TheBestVirginia,3,Sat Jul 18 04:24:41 2015 UTC,"I guess his body was never found around there. They found the laptop and the mutilated hdd, so I guess it makes sense. His brother died around that area as well.  Ya know. What if some pen state booster paid him 5 million to disappear to not be able to be involved in the pen state stuff.  Boosters can be crazy, ya know. Especially at a place like pen state. More times than not if you here of ncaa schenanigans it's some crazy rich booster. I mean crazy rich and actually crazy, btw.

Fanhood is serious stuff.  If it came out down the road that something like what you describe happened, I don't think I'd be overly surprised."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,TheBestVirginia,3,Sat Jul 18 05:47:22 2015 UTC,Ray Gricar's disappearance more than likely has nothing to do with Sandusky. The real culprit is probably one of the drug dealers he took down

UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,bsmith7028,14,Fri Jul 17 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"I can't recall many details, but there was an episode about a gamer who was a top scorer of a popular computer game who simply disappeared. I believe he was also very intelligent. A year or so after his disappearance he may have shown up at the door of someone in the town in the middle of the night. He hasn't been seen since. I can't recall his name. I wonder if he's out there in the homeless community or has died. His family seemed very upset and I hope they can be reunited someday.  Edit: I looked it up. He was bipolar and wasn't taking his medication. He changed his name legally to Neo Babson Maximus shortly before he disappeared and was a senior at UMass-Dartmouth. He had a manic episode and just disappeared."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,therealac,8,Thu Jul 16 22:28:10 2015 UTC,"I think that was Charlie Allen. To me it looks like a classic case of mental illness, probably schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Very very sad case. I hope he eventually gets found."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,TheHermitGirl,6,Thu Jul 16 23:21:12 2015 UTC,"What really gets me about his case is his family's reaction. They refuse to believe that it was likely a manic episode. I believe they said something like ""If he says someone was after him, then someone was after him!"". They also put emphasis on something he said, about the answer being in the periodic table of elements.   Paranoia is really common with bipolar disorders, but I remember the family was really insistent that his disappearance had something to do with being a top scoring computer player, and it's all some giant conspiracy. In reality, the boy probably died in the woods from exposure. Really sad."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,therealac,5,Fri Jul 17 02:04:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He was also having delusions - he attempted to break into a home and asked for a person named Mason, who did not live at the residence. He apologized and left."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Ace1999,-5,Fri Jul 17 02:19:19 2015 UTC,Not so fast. I believe them. Have you ever heard of the term 'gangstalking'? It's happening to me right now and I am a targeted individual. I have no history of mental illness and have been constantly victimized in the same way Charlie Allen was. I encourage you to look uo the phenomenom that is terrorizing this country and get educated about it. It could happen to anyone!

UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,TheBestVirginia,2,Thu Jul 16 20:43:17 2015 UTC,Was that the Leah Roberts episode?  I lived in her area when she went missing and have followed it this whole time.  I don't think she's alive either.

UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Rsoiler,10,Sat Jul 18 13:37:20 2015 UTC,Probably the Springfield three. It's apparently not that expensive to do a test on that parking garage and they already found three anomalies in there with the first test.
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,RafaellaSarsaparilla,4,Fri Jul 17 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"That episode was so intruiging yet so frustrating. Like, why not just dig up the parking lot when there literally could be three bodies under it?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Rsoiler,8,Fri Jul 17 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think they're not willing to do it because a) an anomaly could be anything and a1) it would most likely compromise the structure.  If the local police really did think there was anything to it, I think they'd actually make an effort. (Source: Springfieldian, regularly at that hospital/parking garage.  The case is still open, and someone/a team is continually assigned to the case.)"
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,TheBestVirginia,3,Fri Jul 17 03:49:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about ground penetrating technology but from the video I saw, the anomalies certainly looked large enough to be remains and in the general shape of three bodies."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,sharknado88,5,Fri Jul 17 06:50:37 2015 UTC,"I think that the rumors and the anomalies are enough to warrant a proper search.  I mean, whomever shared the rumor didn't already know the anomalies would show up.  So to me, it is some degree of substantiating evidence to warrant further investigation.  I think the hospital is stonewalling it."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,TheBestVirginia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:29:16 2015 UTC,"Understandably so. That would be incredibly expensive to tear up that part of the garage. Could mess up the foundation completely. Then that entire structure is a loss. No one is going to do that until there is something more than a rumor and 3 blips on a screen. It would be interesting for them to check it out. I wish they would, but at this moment I doubt it."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Solar_Pons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:33 2015 UTC,"I think the hospital won't allow it.  Bad publicity, they aren't required to allow it, etc.  I bet, if they say they'd allow it, that the community (and by that I mean many people across the country) could kick start the funds to cover the excavation and even insurance against structural damage.    I can't speak for Cox, but in my town the hospital is owned by the church, is absolutely loaded, and has their way with a LOT of things especially when it comes to construction, expansion, right of way, etc."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,therealac,9,Sat Jul 18 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"I found the McStays to be the most creepy (this before we knew what had happened)--that image of the family crossing the border on foot, silhouetted against some giant streetlight, stuck with me.  Of course we know now they were never in or even near Mexico.  Otherwise I think the Jamisons--similar circumstances, but the discovery of their bodies hasn't lead to any arrests or even a cause of death.    Then there was the case of a Dillard's accountant who vanished mysteriously--can't remember the name of the guy, but it made me wonder if there wasn't some sort of corporate-inspired assassination involved...  And then of course Roy Gricar...all the little details that don't add up.  The cigarette, the car, the hard drive and computer..."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,happilythree,5,Fri Jul 17 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"Did we ever find out why the prosecutors in the McStay case initially said there was no sign of struggle in the house, but now they're saying they think they were killed in the house?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,TheBestVirginia,5,Fri Jul 17 02:38:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's likely they were holding their cards close to the chest - they probably had more details than released, and if they had their suspicions about the friend all along, it may have helped the police keep an eye on him if they made it sound like there was less incriminating evidence at the scene than they actually had."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,BonzaiThePenguin,5,Fri Jul 17 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way about how McStay's dad originally ""supported"" Chase in publicly proclaiming he was innocent, but did so under the guise of keeping your friends close and your enemies closer.  He suspected Chase all along."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Zykium,4,Sat Jul 18 03:39:28 2015 UTC,They were killed in the house without a struggle.
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Monsterandmayhem,2,Fri Jul 17 03:11:52 2015 UTC,Most likely they were corralled with threats against one of the children.

UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,choppedfan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:01:40 2015 UTC,"I honestly never thought the family on the video was the McStays.  And I don't think the Jamison family was suicide or exposure...mainly because law enforcement hasn't proclaimed either.  It's been a while since they've been found, and we don't know anything more than we did the day it was announced.  I think local LE would have been quick to announce a murder-suicide or anything that would wrap this case up quickly and get the monkey off their backs, and they haven't.  The Dillard's exec...I do think that was a homicide.  Not sure why, I just do.  And I think Gricar was too. In both of those cases, there was a lot of money and power involved, and that could allow for detailed premeditation and quiet witnesses."
UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,therealac,11,Sat Jul 18 03:34:06 2015 UTC,I can't remember the names of the couple but it was a young girl who ran away with her bf (I think he picked her up from school) and they lived in Mexico for a bit. The parents were searching for them and I think they were spotted in the US again after sometime. Ugh I wish I remembered their names!

Because it was just interesting to me how these young, normal girls just walk out of camera frame and vanish. Both episodes to me have a ""what if"" factor- Kara asked a friend if she wanted to skip class/leave campus for lunch with her (I can't remember which! Sorry.) and Brittanee was on vacation with a couple of other girls, yet she was alone. What if those girls did have someone with them?

Locally pretty much everybody assumes that her abusive ex-boyfriend (Kylr Yurst) did it, as far as I can tell. They've searched a couple of places in the last handful of years but there hasn't been much new info. Kylr is in jail on a separate charge now, or at least was last I heard.   Russ Patcek (I didn't spell that right. The reporter that was helping her family.) has since left the area, and he was really their media advocate.

UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,chirpity,47,Sun Jul 19 00:49:29 2015 UTC,"The episode about Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos upset me very much. After I saw this I found myself thinking about it for several days. Both these young men of colour were in cars/driving without licenses if I recall correctly, and were intercepted by police officer Steve Calkins. The victims struck me as average working class guys with the usual car related problems that result when you don't have enough income, but must rely on a car for transportation in areas with lacking public transit service.   The men vanished after their interactions with the officer and there were witnesses. Only because Terrance's family pushed for answers did some semblance of an investigation occur. I believe Calkins was rightfully fired after the investigation - if only for his inappropriate comments on record -  but no charges were brought against him.   Calkins is a racist and it is chilling to hear him make inappropriate comments about the young men on the recordings. It made me realize how dangerous it is to commit a minor offence in America when you are a visible minority and/or working class. In fact, the episode sticks with me because it scared me off visiting the US this Summer as I intended.  Here is a wikipedia  post about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Terrance_Williams_and_Felipe_Santos  My personal opinion is he drove these young men to a deserted area and assaulted them, leading to death. I would not be surprised to learn this person is a sexual predator targeting people who would least be missed in society, and using a badge to force them into isolated areas for his evil plans. He does seem to have a facial ""type"" beyond the dark skin tone.  The fact that this has gotten such little exposure when there are likely many other victims, is very disheartening."

Theories range from a drug deal gone bad near where he parked, to suicide in the desert, to starting a new life in a new city. All seem to require some stretching to fit all the known facts of his last few days. It's really puzzling."

Edit: the part of his case that hit home for me was seeing the huge family photo, with all of his perfect siblings with their spouses and kids, and him without either.  If he was closeted, he had to feel so alone.  He may have had a lot of pressure to conform to his family norm."

UnresolvedMysteries,3djd6f,Diarygirl,4,Sat Jul 18 23:40:03 2015 UTC,"There was an episode about a young man Timothy Carney who went missing under mysterious circumstances in New Jersey.  His car was found abandoned on a highway near the airport, and he simply vanished.  His mother worked for me at the time.   She was very dedicated and driven to find him.  I believe it was 7 years since he had gone missing, but she was sure he was alive despite all the clues seeming to say he was not.  She put up billboards every year, placed ads in local papers, and she got tons on local news coverage to keep the case alive.  She really loved him obviously as she stayed focus on getting the word out and never lost faith that she would find him.  After the Disappeared segment aired, a woman approached her neighbor in Chicago, and told him she suspected he was a missing person who appeared on the show.  It was in fact him!  He had left voluntarily after becoming intertwined in a religious group, and had staged a very elaborate disappearance.    His mother used to tell me how he was an avid crime/fantasy writer, and in the end it seems he chose to live out a plot from his library!  Interestingly, (kind of sadly) he left intentionally and chose to continue avoiding contact with his family.  The neighbor did contact his family via a lawyer to confirm it was him, but unfortunately there was little his mother could do to contact him as he was an adult who chose to remain anonymous if you will.  I was glad to see her get an answer to his well being, but it was a sobering reminder that often getting ones wishes granted opens a new quagmire of new troubles.  Sometimes the light at the end of the tunnel is actually a train!"

She was in pretty bad shape and probably would have died within hours if they hadn't found her.  It's just crazy to think what may have happened if they hadn't found her.

The friend tells her she shouldn't go out dancing by herself, but the young woman says it's okay and she goes.  Now, they HAVE video of her going into the club and then being outside.  Here's what got me... her mom... her MOM... viewed the video and picked out THE WRONG GIRL as her daughter.  The cops keep trying to figure out who the guys are that are w/ her ""daughter,"" but it's not even her.  It wasn't until an aunt (my marriage... not even a blood relative) looked at the video footage from the dance club and figured out that it's not her.  Now, the cops had to start all over because the missing young lady goes out of the club (by herself) but she looks to the one side like someone called to her. Later, they find her car w/ the door open and then later her cell phone in an area unknown to the missing girl.    I guess what got me was the fact that her mom didn't recognize her.  She even commented on what her daughter wore that night... and it wasn't what the girl she thought was her daughter was wearing.  AND... the mom seemed so... blah about her daughter being missing.  I know we all register grief/pain differently, but she just seemed so, ""oh, well... she's missing.""  Wish I remembered the girl's name to see what has happened to her case."

There's no indication that anyone was with him. He was divorced, having trouble adjusting to his community and was isolated. There's implied money trouble (his car is described as ""broken down""), although that's uncertain.

Not impossible though.   Another thing that I didn't realize at first was that his body wasn't found for 3 months. 3 months is a long time for the elements and animals to affect the scene and the evidence.   Anyway, I'm really not trying to argue that it wasn't suicide. I just feel that conclusion was made pretty hastily by the officers and I am curious as to what was in the pictures (not that I would want to see them, but maybe a description).

My stepson did believe in the Christian Faith, Jesus, God.....yet, when he was swirling down the hole in a deep psychosis.....he would believe that the pastor talking about 'The Lord', was actually talking about ' The Dark Lord ', or Satan....later his schizophrenia associated Dark Lord with Sauron....and there she blows!

UnresolvedMysteries,3dhrs4,novaskyd,10,Thu Jul 16 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"hmm very interesting, i read a lot of scripture i'll have a look at this.   When looking at documents like this it's all to easy to look at the ostensible layer and laugh but if you actually get into the narrative and try to understand what's being expressed often it's completely sensible, brilliant even.   This is largely a modern retelling of the gnostic mysteries, lots of it is quotes and readings from Bill Cooper the conspiracy theorist alex jones is based upon who was shot in a confrontation with police - this legendary figure actually got most his secret info from a book written in the late ninteenth century, i forget what it's called something like secrets of the masonic orders... this book gets most of it's info from genuine ancient gnostic texts and contemporary beliefs of vaguely secret societies but a lot of it is seemingly made up.   i think it was the psychiatrist Jong who talked about how common certain mysteries and story pattens are to people and how certain ideas seem to compel us - there have always been people believing in strange creates from the sky be they spirits, gods, aliens or whatever, it's just something at seems to make sense to us.   so this idea basically bounces around between zealous imaginations, the secrets are exposed by bill as one thing and imbued by this author who resonates with certain story elements and emits them in his style - adding his own solutions and innovations where needed... so if one understands the basic theological models it can become a pleasure to read even if the main story is a bit weird the basic under-structure is solid and often it's this they're trying to express, like they're trying to demonstrate their model of the universe...    i think the real trick with this kind of fiction is to read it as a unreliable narrator, imagine that the underlaying events are true but being described by someone who experienced them and thus has a warped perspective on events - it's a much more engaging form of fiction. The interesting thing is to build the world in your head, each piece of text is a clue rather than a narrative of events.  This stuff all harks back to the Mahabharata, it's all about the long-cycles of human development and decay - the same torah arguments about the nature and battle of good vs evil... He's trying to impart some fundamental observations on the nature of the sublime reality, how there is a dark force impossible to describe which can enrapture you and drive you to do terrible things but also there is a force of grace and goodness, the light of love and truth which will set you free and turn all creation into wonder and blessed awe...

UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,kookaburralaughs,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"We have no idea how Eddie and Keela were trained.    The specialist training techniques - which are highly confidential - were developed by Eddie's handler Martin Grime, along with the UK's National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) and America's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).   (source)  They're not trained at Body farms as they would contaminate the area, and also this has been denied several times. They may be trained with human remains, but it's more likely they're trained using human blood and tissue samples (hair, teeth, etc) along with decaying meat and artificial smells. Certainly Eddie and Keela's handlers have said there have been false positives caused by decaying animals which they have had to cross off, which would suggest that they're not sensitive to human remains, just decomposition."

Anyone there who would know anything surely came forward years ago(?)  I am not sure what we would hear now, unless a body was found or Madeleine miraculously found alive.

My understanding is that the McCann's rented a car almost a month after her disappearance.  Obviously everything we say is speculation, but I feel like it would be pretty difficult to hide a child's body in a foreign country for a month during a highly publicized investigation.  If the parents did it, where is the body?  If they did it, somebody else has to know and be in on it.

The window had only one set of prints, Kate's, the friends had a silence pact, they hired a PR guy.  There was blood found behind the sofa, so much blood that it soaked under the tiles. It's the same place the dogs smelt cadaverine. The blood matched the McCann's on 15 out of 18 markers. She died in the room. Fluids found in the car were consistent with the body having been frozen for a time. The dogs indicated frantically at a unit in the complex that the police did not have access to. The local priest was forced by the Church to give Kate keys to his little local church for purposes he was not allowed to reveal and will not discuss now.

I kind of hate the stupid worldview thesedays whereby the conspiracy theory is the first thing people believe.  Most people and organisations couldn't organise a picnic in a sandwich factory, let alone fool police etc.  I do think the horrible possibility her parents were involved has to be considered, but there are some pretty big gaps in the explanation for me if they did do it."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Reckoner525,11,Thu Jul 16 16:56:45 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree completely.  Most crimes against children are committed by parents/relatives/people who know them.  The parents should be suspected first and foremost.   I see the theory that the parents, being doctors, drugged her to get her to sleep and that ultimately caused her death.  It's nothing more than speculation, though I will admit I don't think it's impossible.  However, people get hung up on this speculation and go off on tangents where they judge the parents for this and that.  What's more important is what happens next.  Where did they take the child's body?  Bear in mind the police have been notified at this point and are combing the area.  The only way I feel they get away with it at this point is if somebody else is aware of what happened and is assisting them with the disposal.  The problem with this theory is that we are now expanding the conspiracy, more people are involved, more people who can make a mistake, etc.  The cadaver dogs also bother me a bit, just because most sources people post are blogspot sites, is there an official police report that discusses the dogs going crazy at the car?  Remember, we also have to believe that the McCann's were able to hide the body for a month to even get to this point.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Cooper0302,14,Thu Jul 16 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"I've never believed the abduction theory. I think she had an accident in the apartment and they returned to find her dead. Terrified that the Portuguese police would charge them with child abandonment (for leaving 3 children under the age of 4 all alone while the parents went out for dinner) they came up with the abduction story. Perhaps the friends, if they had a clue, feared similar consequences for leaving their children as well, and went along with the story."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,tucumcari,3,Fri Jul 17 05:08:44 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,kookaburralaughs,2,Fri Jul 17 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"Never thought of that theory, but it does make some sense. Didn't they find a lot of blood in the unit? Perhaps she fell and hit her head against something."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Nerds_Wear_Glasses,63,Fri Jul 17 22:28:34 2015 UTC,"She dead.  Parents are doctors.  Parents sedate the kids so they can be left alone while the parents go out to dinner.  Come home to find Madeline dead of an overdose.  Realise their rich careers and lives would be ruined, so they hide the body in trunk of their rental car.  After police are informed, they wash Madeline's toy rabbit and all her clothes and bedding (remove traces of whatever medication they gave her).  Immediately hire a PR rep and refuse to answer questions. Police sniffer dogs detect smell of dead body in rental car, this is not followed up.  Everyone know the parents did it."

It seems to be an absolutely vital piece of information, but is it true?  And also the background, how reliable are corpse sniffing dogs?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Reckoner525,15,Thu Jul 16 10:11:04 2015 UTC,"It is not reliable at all. Everyone knows the Portuguese police set the McCann's up.  After all they were a tiny police department who made incredible errors and had no experience on what to do when a child is abducted. The Portuguese police even tried coercing Kate McCann into a confession because they really had no idea what to do. Kate refused to answer the questions the police asked her because she's not an idiot, she knew was being set up and her lawyer advised her not to answer them. The big dogs were called in (Scotland Yard) and they did an actual investigation which is still ongoing. They have suspects, and E-fits of them."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Murkywaterkid,15,Thu Jul 16 11:45:58 2015 UTC,"the dogs were from the UK police, no set up involved. One PI firm refused to work with them because they couldn't see how they didn't do it. Maybe they didn't do it, but this whole thing reminds me of JonBenet. In a very bad way."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,TrackmarksTrademarks,2,Fri Jul 17 08:41:24 2015 UTC,"So in a foreign country,  with unfamiliar geography and terrain, the McCann's are able to elude police and other witnesses to dispose of the body in a hiding place so secure that to this very day the body hasn't been found.? Seems implausible to me when you consider the amount of attention this case has received."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,madmenonly,6,Tue Jul 21 10:35:03 2015 UTC,"This is simply, ""Our police are better than their police"" imho. The PJ were there quickly and in great numbers. They did a thorough search that night and interviewed hundreds of people. They were blocked and distracted at every turn by the McCann's and their friends, the heavyweight PR(!) man that was sent over by Tony Blair and by the UK police reps.  It's a huge rabbit hole but the information is all available."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,kookaburralaughs,3,Fri Jul 17 14:54:26 2015 UTC,Operation Grange has spent millions and has achieved nothing because they're not allowed to look in the right place. They have 'aged' a photo of Madeleine that Gerry McCann cannot look at without laughing hysterically. It's the weirdest thing to watch.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,kookaburralaughs,12,Fri Jul 17 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"It was all over the papers, the local police wanted to arrest the parents but the UK police stepped in and brought them back to the UK. Can't remember all the details, it was a huge story here in the UK, front covers of all the papers for months.   Pretty much everyone here is adamant the parents did it."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,GraphicDesignMonkey,23,Thu Jul 16 10:14:47 2015 UTC,"I'm also in the UK.  A lot of those papers got sued and lost and paid a lot of damages for saying the McCanns did it.  Also the UK Police can't protect you abroad - the McCanns did get declared formal suspects at a later date.  I  don't think it's impossible that your version of events did happen.  Equally it probably meant their friends were in on it, and that seems a hard silence to keep."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Reckoner525,0,Thu Jul 16 10:31:33 2015 UTC,Portuguese police guy in charge of the investigation made a documentary that I think had all these details in it.  I remember seeing something about blood on their rental car etc.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,bawbay,0,Thu Jul 16 13:03:41 2015 UTC,I don't think the friends had to be in on it. What makes you feel that? They could just as easily have been told exactly the same story as was told to the rest of the world. I feel like someone would have spoken by now. And that's just kind of a heavy accusation to put on people.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,anditwaslove,4,Thu Jul 16 23:40:23 2015 UTC,"To my recollection, their timeline is closely tied into their friends' timeline. So if the parents did it, the friends know about it, more or less. This is a simplification but you get the idea."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,faint-smile,5,Fri Jul 17 02:19:12 2015 UTC,This.  Not enough time between leaving dinner to check on the kids and calling the police to do anything.  Unless the timeline is a lie and the friends all in on it.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Reckoner525,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:28:55 2015 UTC,Do we know she wasn't dead before dinner?
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,alarmagent,8,Fri Jul 17 11:55:25 2015 UTC,"No, but there are three big problems with this:   One of the other families checked on the McCann children when they checked their own.  It would be taking an enormous risk of discovery to allow that. Could you go to dinner with friends, act normal, have a nice meal knowing your child is dead and you need to pop back after dessert and fake an abduction? No possible motive or cause of death if she died earlier.  If Madeleine just dropped dead due to say a heart condition, why wouldn't they call police and an ambulance?   Not saying the death theory is wrong, but it's hard to make it work without meaning at least some of the friends were in on it, and/or the McCanns were cold-blooded genius criminals."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Reckoner525,5,Fri Jul 17 12:53:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm...yeah, they'd have to be quite good & incredibly cold, you're right. I think for the first point it would be quite easy to just prop her body into the bed as if she was asleep - all a friend would do is open the door and spot the figures under the covers. The only motive I can see would be...whatever motive any parent who kills a child has.  I'm far from convinced of McCann guilt, because there is no clear motivation (also don't really buy the drugging so they could party theory) but I'm not convinced of a stranger abduction, either. It's a tough case - there is a good reason it's unresolved. Unlike JBR, for instance, where one scenario does seem to make quite a bit of sense and fit. For Madeline, nothing seems to make sense. She really did seem to just disappear..."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,alarmagent,7,Fri Jul 17 13:06:09 2015 UTC,"One of the McCann friends wrote two sets of timelines on a ripped out page of Madeleine's sticker book, see here. This was before they all spoke to the police.   Normally, I find if someone's telling the truth, they don't need to write things down to get their story straight."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,iiiva,0,Fri Jul 17 15:38:24 2015 UTC,"The timeline was a lie and the friends were all in on it, apart from Dianne Webster who I believe was left in the dark."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,kookaburralaughs,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:05:27 2015 UTC,They had a 'pact'. They openly talked about their pact not to tell the police anything useful.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,kookaburralaughs,7,Fri Jul 17 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"Again, I'd love to see sources for any of this stuff.  Not doubting you personally.  As I said, I have an open mind.  I am mainly aware there is a whole community of people out to give the McCann's a hard time.  There are undoubtedly rumours out there about the family which are total nonsense."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Reckoner525,6,Thu Jul 16 10:42:02 2015 UTC,Maybe have a look at this site: http://www.mccannfiles.com/id161.html   There's plenty of information on there.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,iiiva,23,Fri Jul 17 14:49:40 2015 UTC,Parents sedate the kids so they can be left alone while the parents go out to dinner.   Where is the evidence for this? I keep seeing this accusation flung about and nobody ever backs it up with a source. I've also never read in any news reports about her.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,marysia94,8,Fri Jul 17 15:52:05 2015 UTC,"I've heard this about Casey Anthony too, and I've been downvoted for saying this before, but I think it's a ridiculously specific thing to assume without any indication they'd done it before. I'm in no way saying it isn't possible or that they're innocent, but jumping from ""parents covered up an accident"" to ""parents drugged their kids to sleep on the reg"" is a pretty big leap."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,missxfebruary,0,Thu Jul 16 13:17:37 2015 UTC,"Maddie, I'm not sure about. Casey Anthony, I believe that she without doubt unintentionally overdosed that poor child. I believe it came out in the trial that Casey had a bit of a love of Xanax, and many people believe that ""Zanny the Nanny"" was inspired by 'zany' being a street term for Xanax. Also, the chloroform stuff. I see that there is little evidence with the McCanns, but there is more than enough to suggest that Casey was drugging Caylee."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,anditwaslove,-3,Thu Jul 16 22:01:18 2015 UTC,Totally agree about Casey Anthony but if you read the police files there a shedload of evidence pointing to the McCanns too.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,kookaburralaughs,7,Fri Jul 17 17:12:20 2015 UTC,The McCann sued him for this and won so Amaral is pretty much discredited.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Rosie-44,-1,Fri Jul 17 23:21:13 2015 UTC,That's not the case actually. They said and the UK papers trumpeted that they won but they came out pretty poorly.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,kimberleygd,4,Sat Jul 18 13:53:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I always felt that their being doctors would make them less likely to give her an overdose, considering they probably have a good deal more experience in administering medications than the average person."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,AnnonMiss,2,Fri Jul 17 10:35:03 2015 UTC,"General consensus is they hid the body and used the car to move it later. The also found hair in the trunk which was a close match to Madeleine's (80-90% match), but couldn't be matched enough to prove it was hers."

I think she was taken and most likely killed. I don't think her parents were involved. They didn't ""refuse to answer questions"" - quite opposite. Local police wanted them to stay completely silent on everything.   If you gave your kid some benedryl to sleep, there wouldn't be all this ""evidence"" to dispose of.  If a child OD'ed, why do you think her parents would be 100% blamed? A kid can easily enough get into medication. She wasn't an infant."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,pizza_partyUSA,12,Thu Jul 16 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"Kate McCann is a GP in a small town, Gerry McCann is a cardiologist at a local hospital in a small city, neither of them would be any more knowledgable about forensic evidence than any other layperson. I really wouldn't count the washing of the stuffed animal as anything too odd - it's quite possible she spilled something on it during the day and they wanted to give it a clean before she wanted it again the next day. Furthermore, it's not unusual for kids to be heavy sleepers, especially if they're absolutely zonked from a busy day in a new environment, like the day Madeline disappeared.  I can totally understand why they seem suspicious - the act of leaving your kids alone in a completely unknown location while you're having dinner quite a way away is odd in itself, IMO. However, I don't think them being doctors or taking a stuffed animal off their sleeping daughter to wash it is necessarily all that suspicious."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,SuffragettePizza,7,Fri Jul 17 16:37:01 2015 UTC,"I really don't see why you're so absolutely convinced that she was drugged and that's why she slept through something like a toy being taken away - it's really not at all unusual for kids to sleep heavily, especially after a particularly busy day. I would suggest that it's more plausible than her being drugged by her parents, when there is seemingly no evidence or prior incidents to support that.   Furthermore, I really don't see how an understanding of the human body would lead them to know more about forensics. I really think that's clutching at straws. I'm certainly not ruling out that the parents killed her and got rid of her body but I don't feel like their being doctors realistically would have any sway on their knowledge of forensics. In the UK, forensics and criminal pathology are taught as completely different subjects and areas of education to medicine.  I personally flip-flop between the parents having done it and a random abduction and I think there are swathes of evidence for either way. However, I just feel like the arguments you're presenting are clutching at straws when realistically there are other bits of evidence that more strongly support your theory."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,SuffragettePizza,10,Thu Jul 16 18:03:46 2015 UTC,"it's possible that some random dude who was fantastically stealthy/lucky took her. I just don't think that it's plausible.    It's not plausible that someone walked in through unlocked doors and with no adults there, just walked out with a sleeping child?  Same thing as the other thread, but I don't understand why you find abduction so unlikely.  The murder/accidental death theory is the one that requires the conspiracy, because the parents were sat in a public place all evening, and promptly called police after Madeleine was found missing.  (This doesn't mean the parents didn't do it.  I sometimes lean towards that view myself.  And you are entitled to your own opinion regardless.  Just pointint out abduction seems far easier to explain)."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Zeno_of_Citium,8,Tue Jul 21 10:30:50 2015 UTC,"'you don't go looking for unicorns until you run out of ponies.'    I absolutely agree with this, but for me the simplest explanation is an intruder and abduction.  They had 2 other kids, they had friends there, and they were in a busy resort.  If they did somehow kill Madeleine either the friends are in on it, or they are amazing actors.  Plus, as I keep saying on this thread, where is the body and how are they supposed to have gotten rid of it?  JBR is for me totally different as she was found dead in the family home.  Here, the fact the child was removed makes the simplest explanation that someone removed her.  Edit: TLDR: It's not neccesarily the right explanation but the simple explanation is abduction.  The killing theory requires a major conspiracy and/or disposing of a body in a foreign country after they alerted police."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Reckoner525,8,Thu Jul 16 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but their timeline doesn't support them having time to stash the body, to my recollection. And their friends support their timeline. Let me know if i'm offbase with that, i haven't looked at this case for a while."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,WeHaveAView,9,Fri Jul 17 02:23:28 2015 UTC,Obviously this is a tragedy. But there are so many more kids that go missing that don't get the same press as this middle class white family.  Who knows what happened? Did the parents fuck up and hide the evidence ? Or was she snatched up?  There is a chance she's still alive. It has happened before.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,6foot8,4,Fri Jul 17 02:24:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. People say, as a young blonde girl, she could've been abducted to be sold on the illegal adoption market. I don't know much about that (and don't intend to find out) but I hope that could mean she was adopted by loving parents. I think that's the assumption the campaign operates under - there's no point reminding everyone what she looks like if you think she's in some brothel somewhere. They're hoping to find her out in public, and she'll only be there if she's not being raised underground.  But I think the 'happiest' likely explanation is she died that night, accidentally, at the hands of her loving (irresponsible) parents."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,Reckoner525,4,Thu Jul 16 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"Dodgy people hanging around apartments very rarely equal mastermind child abductors, though. Especially if there are several of them...if there were such people hanging about outside, which I'm sure there were since it's a tourist trap, they were probably just thieves and cons. The more people you introduce into the conspiracy, the less likely it becomes...if I believe it was an abduction, it was one person. I feel like the parents have something to do with it, but I'm way less convinced than I am about JBR, for instance."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dh6vw,alarmagent,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"Good points.  I would say that if it was abduction, and it wasn't a lone paedophile, a gang - possibly Eastern European -stealing children ""to order"" seems to be a favoured theory.  In which case the idea that there might be someone casing the area doesn't seem so unlikely.  Agree conspiracies get less likely the more people involved (my problem with 9/11 ""truthers"", but that's a whole other thread).  That's my key issue with the death theory, as it would seem to need the involvement of some of the group of friends."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dfizw,pandoranicole22,31,Wed Jul 15 21:36:06 2015 UTC,"Here are some mystery and mystery-related podcasts:  Mysterious Universe is a podcast about mysteries, the paranormal, along with strange and funny news.    Mysterious Topics could best be described as your uncle's mysery podcast.  Sounds like a couple of Canadian old-timers talkin' about mysteries.  A very good show though.  Last Podcast on the Left covers mostly serial killer stuff but they also have some shows on mysteries.  It is hosted by three stand-up comedians--NSFW.  Definitely don't listen to this one with Grandma.  Monster Talk is a podcast about monsters.  The show takes a historical and scientific approach to monster legends.  Here are some one-off episodes from podcasts that aren't exclusively about mysteries:  Kick Ass Oregon History has an excellent two-part episode on DB Cooper.     KAOH on KXRY: DB Cooper Part 1 KAOH on KXRY: DB Cooper Part 2   LA Magazine did a podcast on the Original Night Stalker.   The Golden State Killer / EAR/ONS (sorry I only have a youtube link)   Shrink Rap Radio did an episode on whether the Unabomber was also the Zodiac.  Most probably not but it's still fun speculation.   The Unabomber and the Zodiac"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dfizw,hectorabaya,9,Thu Jul 16 01:03:51 2015 UTC,"I generally like Last Podcast on the Left, but I do skip some episodes because I've noticed they can get a little insensitive when joking about sexual assault, and I find that a little upsetting as someone who has survived it. They are generally funny and the podcast is definitely right up my alley, I just figured I'd mention that. There have also been a bunch of occasions where they wax prolific on the attractiveness (or lack thereof) of women in the movies or whatever they're discussing, which isn't a huge deal to me but it does knock me out of the narrative a bit.  I contrast it a bit to Caustic Soda, which covers very similar topics and I think is a lot more respectful and sensitive while also being extremely funny. I find Caustic Soda a lot funnier, because while I'd say the two podcasts' top jokes are on par with each other, I never really feel like the Caustic Soda guys are lacking empathy or concern, yet they've managed to make me pull over because I'm laughing so hard I'm in tears on some really gruesome subjects. eta: and they definitely talk about attractive women in movies and whatever (in fact they have a ""pop culture"" section where they often specifically recommend terrible movies because of naked actresses), and it doesn't bother me because it's just a small part. I'm not against that kind of thing, it's just a matter of degree.  Again, not saying don't listen to Last Podcast on the Left. I subscribe to it and have listened to many episodes, and those guys are really funny most of the time. I'm just also pretty choosy about the topics I listen to, so wanted to add that caution. (and I'll also add that, because it isn't one of my favorite podcasts and I am kinda old and am relatively new to podcasts, I'm not fully caught up so it may have gotten better)"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dfizw,StumpyCorgi,3,Thu Jul 16 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was listening to their Bundy episode, and in my opinion, they crossed the line. They were talking about Bundy's victims being beautiful women.  The podcast guy (not sure which one) said he didn't feel very bad for those women because he would never have a chance with any of them. Like they were out of his league so they don't deserve the respect given to other victims? WTF?! I understand it was meant as a joke, but for me personally, it went way too far."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dfizw,hectorabaya,3,Sun Jul 19 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. There are a few Last Podcast episodes where I had to stop listening and shut the episode off because I felt the humor went over the line and/or the episode became too disturbing.  Another problem I've had is that their research can be very uneven. Some episodes it's clear they researched deeply(like the Dahmer episodes) and have a lot to discuss.  And other episodes it's clear they didn't do much research(like the unabomber episodes).  Those episodes where they do little research can very frustrating to listen to because they never get into the case and it feels like they're using humor as filler.  I will say whether they research a topic deeply or not, I don't trust their research.  I'm familiar with a few of the topics they've covered and they get a lot wrong.  But Last Podcast isn't NPR.  Last Podcast is three friends sittin' around talkin' about a topic they're interested in and making jokes.  So if they misreport the facts I can forgive it. I really just want an entertaining episode.  Even with all the weaknesses though Last Podcast has several great episodes."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dfizw,Selcazare,2,Thu Jul 16 23:57:05 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that weakness with research too. I haven't noticed any factual inaccuracies or anything, but there are definitely some episodes where I've been like, ""How do I know more about this than you?"" because it's not a subject I'm that interested in and yet I notice glaring omissions. But then they've got their really strong episodes too, where they've obviously put a lot of research in. It's just really hit or miss."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dfizw,GateheaD,3,Fri Jul 17 01:28:23 2015 UTC,It's just really hit or miss.   Yes it is.    Here's some inaccuracies I can remember:  Zodiac: In the Zodiac episode they make the case that Arthur Leigh Allen was Zodiac.  Pretty much all the physical evidence exonerates Allen.  They also play audio of people they claim are Allen's friends.  Two of the people they identify as Allen's friends are Ralph Spinelli and George Balwart.  Neither of these men were friend's of Allen.    Ralph Spinelli was going to jail for armed robbery.  To try to get a reduced sentence he made up a story about Allen being Zodiac.  He probably never even knew Allen.  But they identify Spinelli as being one of Allen's life long best friends.  And George Balwart was a detective with Vallejo PD and he was investigating Allen as possibly being the Zodiac.  Again not a friend.  Unabomber: In the Unabomber episode they say that Kaczynski got his PhD from Harvard.  Kaczynski did his undergrad at Harvard.  He got his PhD from the University of Michigan.  This omission is significant because Kaczynski under went considerable psychological stress at Michigan including struggling with his own sexual identity.  While at Michigan Kaczysnki was seeing the school psychiatrist regarding maybe having sexual reassignment surgery.    I don't even think they're aware they missed this.  They also left out a bunch of stuff from his later life.  Occasionally they got mixed up about places he lived and when he lived there.  Zodiac and Unabomber are two cases I'm particularly interested in and familiar with so I noticed these.  So in cases I'm less familiar with I'm skeptical regarding any of the details I get from Last Podcast.  BTK: I'm less familiar with BTK so I'll just say listen to Last Podcast's episode on BTK and then listen to Caustic Soda's episode on BTK.  The difference in research quality and the clarity of presentation is stark.  ..........  In their defense I think Henry does some of his research while smoking marijuana and/or drinking.  So it's not the most reliable. They also have a very compressed time line in which to do their research.  But again Last Podcast is more about the humor and less about facts.  EDIT::u/DahmerDidNothinWrong is gone.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dfizw,deviger,5,Thu Jul 16 12:29:57 2015 UTC,The first episode I listened to was on the Zodiac.  I didn't like it.  But I tried a few more and I changed my mind.  If you're looking for a serious take on these topics then this show will piss you off.  Personally I like the humor.  Most other podcasts and shows on these topics are very serious.  It's nice to have one that's different.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dfizw,battysays,27,Thu Jul 16 13:16:48 2015 UTC,"I really like the ""Stuff They Don't Want You to Know"" podcast, they look into a lot of conspiracies and mysteries with less of a tinfoil hat point of view and more of a critical thinking/reasoning type of deal."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dfizw,deviger,3,Wed Jul 15 23:20:36 2015 UTC,I wish they weren't so short

Honestly the lack of research and preparation shows. Spending 5 minutes reading Wikipedia and you know more than they do and can point out their mistakes.   Add to that.... They.... Talk... So...

UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,waffenwolf,60,Thu Jul 16 01:19:22 2015 UTC,"There's no mystery here. Wikipedia explains exactly what happened and how it went down, although there is a level of dodgyness to some claims.   The F-117 was flying the same flight path that had been used by NATO aircraft for weeks. The Serbian SAM battery had knowledge of where the F-117 was going to be in addition to #1. The SAM battery had their radar switched off so as to avoid any SEAD missions from NATO. They switched it on for only a few seconds to get the lock. They only got the lock because the bomb bay doors were open, which increases the RCS enough to be seen by the radar used with the SA-3. 1 of 2 missiles missed.   Additionally, the commander of the battery claimed that they were using a specific band of radar that is more effective against stealth aircraft. This may be somewhat of a myth, given that the SA-3 does not have the ability to do this.  Stealth aircraft are not immune to radar. Even the famous B-2 is not invisible. There are OTH radar systems that allow you to see stealth aircraft at long range, every nation uses these and they're no secret. However, these systems come with downsides, such as significantly increased clutter, lower resolution, and the requirement for large antennae. These systems are for early warning, and are almost never used as part of gaining a firing solution. SAM systems, jets, anything with missiles attached to it use a band of radar that stealth aircraft are optimized against.  So you'll know stealth aircraft are in the air (at least until you get a HARM fired at you), but you won't know exactly where they are, what they are or even how many there are. Nor will you be able to fire at them unless your aircraft get very close. The only exception to this is the S-400 SAM system which is new and exists in relatively few numbers.  Finally, you generally can't fire radar guided missiles at the air randomly and get a hit. You require a firing solution first."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,yawningangel,3,Thu Jul 16 10:50:49 2015 UTC,"Stealth aircraft are not immune to radar.    Very true, but they do get better as time goes on. There's an interesting factoid that gets passed around about how a single Stealth Bomber (the B-2, an older stealth plane) has a larger radar signature then the entire fleet of Stealth Fighters (F-117) in its entirety."

And that the Serbs just plotted it out with a pen and paper and fragged the hell out of it when it was overhead"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,kebab_removal,7,Thu Jul 16 01:32:31 2015 UTC,"Assuming the flights weren't at exactly the same time of day, how would they even know ""when it was overhead""? Not only did they keep their radars off almost all the time to avoid HARMs, but even if they enabled them they shouldn't have been able to detect an F-117. The warhead doesn't have a huge kill radius, btw. Even if they were firing the missiles unguided, they would need to know, at minimum, the F-117's location and altitiude at the moment of firing."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,b0dhi,7,Thu Jul 16 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"how would they even know ""when it was overhead""?   Given that Russia was caught trying to supply Serbia with aircraft during that conflict, I honestly wouldn't put it past a flight schedule landing in Serbia's hands.   but even if they enabled them they shouldn't have been able to detect an F-117.   Why not?  It's stealthy, not invisible.  We were expecting to lose some during the Gulf War, and we didn't."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,R_B_Kazenzakis,2,Thu Jul 16 08:50:03 2015 UTC,"Indeed, the top post now says they did apparently have info on where it would be and when, so that explains that.    It's stealthy, not invisible.   Yeah, but it's supposed to be undetectable to that radar at that distance/height and that aspect. However, if they knew where it would be and when, then it sounds plausible that they could've detected it when the bomb bay doors were open. That foreknowledge from the Russians or whomever makes all the difference."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,b0dhi,2,Thu Jul 16 08:56:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's supposed to be undetectable to that radar at that distance/height and that aspect   Ehhhhhh it is for a certain value of ""undetectable"".  Without getting into it too much, I would speculate that it probably looks like a return that is routinely locked out of the Radar's computer.  Sorta like how the DC Air Defense Zone didn't see that gyrocopter thanks the the Speed Gate in the system.    In addition, IIRC the F-117 was hit from the rear, so it would make sense that it would be less stealthy from behind than in front(it being a penetration bomber)."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,R_B_Kazenzakis,-13,Thu Jul 16 09:02:54 2015 UTC,No it was shot down by a radar guided missile not AA gun. Even if they did work out the flight path they would still need a guided missile because its in a high altitude aircraft and a fast moving object.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,kebab_removal,13,Thu Jul 16 01:38:18 2015 UTC,"S-125 still has a fragmentation head. And the F-117 still has a radar signature, in fact a fairly sizable one compared to later gen models. Especially when they have the bomb bay doors open which compromises geometry- which was the case at the time. Given this, a fairly known and observed flightpath, and the unknown adjustments to the radar suite to specially target the bomber, it seems possible to me that it happened as the Serbs claimed."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,kebab_removal,-10,Thu Jul 16 01:51:42 2015 UTC,"the F-117 still has a radar signature, in fact a fairly sizable one compared to later gen models.    Yes but the Serbs had outdated equipment. If Serbs did as they claimed it would make the F-117 rather a fraud of a stealth aircraft if you can detect it fully by changing the settings on a Radar. What about the possibility of the bomb doors malfunctioning and not closing properly, permanently compromising the stealth and giving it a full radar signature?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,R_B_Kazenzakis,6,Thu Jul 16 02:22:35 2015 UTC,"Anything's possible, but there's no reason the doors had to be malfunctioning.  F-117s were bombing things in the area around that time. Even if it did ruin the stealth a bit, NATO was relying heavily on the ridiculously effective anti-AA counterbattery. This only becomes questionable when they have intelligence and observers keeping tabs on the aircraft, allowing for the operators to turn the radar on, shoot and turn it off before the missiles come."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,R_B_Kazenzakis,9,Thu Jul 16 02:31:16 2015 UTC,"This is a weird thing to act like it's unresolved.   Most likely: Lockheed had fabricated and misrepresented its products ability to avoid radar.   The F-117 is the result of a stealth fly off.  Multiple defense contractors(including Northrop and Rockwell) made a pitch and Lockheed's proposal won.  It's worth noting that in Ben Rich's book about Skunk Works he mentioned that Lockheed didn't have a corporate Radar range at the time, and had to use a McDonnell Douglas one.  He expressed reservations that using a competitor's facilities would reveal trade secrets.  So, IOW, if Lockheed was lying it's almost certain the other major aerospace contractors were as well.  An odd thing to do if you can cause Lockheed's proposal to get destroyed and you winning the contract.  As it is, the F-117 performed extremely well against the modern ""Kari"" air defense network that Iraq had, which used a mixed of French C&C and Soviet radar/SAM/ADA assets.  In fact, the USAF was expecting to lose F-117s during the Gulf War.  We didn't lose any.  This almost certainly over sold it's stealthiness to the public.   Also likely: Serbians fired in the air randomly and Landed a freak hit against all odds   Nope.  Due to airspace constraints the Coalition forces were flying the same routes in and out every day, often at the same time.  The Serbians used a mobile SAM system to park, turn on, and light off when they knew someone would be coming by.   Possible but unlikely: Russian radar technology is very underestimated and has abilities we are not aware of    We have long had access to the very system that shot down the F-117.  The Tonopah Test Range is replete with ""acquired"" enemy systems to assess and even use during the RED FLAG exercises.  There was nothing surprising about it.  It's worth noting that the F-117 wasn't ""retired"" until about 10 years later, and despite this it's still flying."

The Iraqis simply did not have the training to use their equipment properly. I once saw an interview with a US military general he argued that if the US had the old T-72 and the Iraqis had the Abram's M1 they still would have easily won because the Iraqis where so poorly trained compared to the US.

(Wikipedia says its classified)   The aircraft relies heavily on its low radar cross section to evade the lock-on completely. Counter-measures without the ability to dramatically change course might be futile. I'm sure it has something like IR jammers and the such but maybe nothing in the way of chaff/flares. Again, some stuff is classified."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,R_B_Kazenzakis,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"The F-117 Nighthawk is a stealth bomber invisible to radar this what Lockheed claimed. The Serbians with their outdated obsolete radar and missles claimed they could detect the 'stealth' bomber by simply changing the settings on their radar.   If you read the Wiki entry about it, it's a lot harder and more elaborate than just flicking about with a couple of buttons or clicking on a toggle in your Windows settings. And it's not impossible to shoot down stealth bombers, just incredibly hard (especially if you're not an expert with that type of technology)."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,Llaine,3,Sat Jul 18 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"It isn't really a mystery at all, the nighthawks flew the same route every sortie, the missile battery commander knew this, and when the F-117 opened its bomb bay doors which disrupted it's radar profile the Serbs detected it and becuase they were already ready for it fired immediately."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,Llaine,7,Thu Jul 16 06:04:13 2015 UTC,"Most people who know about aviation and weapons systems will tell you that number 2 is by far the most likely scenario.   Number 1 is mostly spouted off by anti-military people and conspiracy theorists. The technology of stealth is so easily testable by the air force that Lockheed couldn't fake it if they tried.   Number 3 is also quite silly. The Russians have struggled so long to develop their own stealth technology for various reasons, so to say that they can develop anti-stealth detection is pretty laughable.  Edit spelling"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,ShillinTheVillain,0,Thu Jul 16 01:39:39 2015 UTC,"Disagree that number 3 is silly.  It's not unusual for people in asymmetric warfare scenarios to slam-dunk on their more technologically sophisticated adversaries.  Example:  China blinding a mega-million dollar spy satellite with a multi-thousand dollar laser, LOL http://defensetech.org/2006/09/25/chinese-laser-vs-u-s-sats/  Another Example: Molotov Cocktail"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,APE992,-11,Tue Jul 21 04:58:16 2015 UTC,How good a stealth aircraft is must be relative to how good the radar is. advanced modern radar can detect aircraft once considered stealth. Remember the earliest stealth aircraft was the Horten Ho 229 it could not be detected by British radar at the time by can be detected by modern radar.  Number 2 is what I have always believed but firing a surface to air missile in a straight line with no target and it just happens to cross paths and collide with a stealth bomber? The odds are less likely than winning jackpot lottery.   Number 3. Is not as silly as it sounds remember the Russians produced very good military hardware and space aviation. Russian technology gets a bad reputation because its used by poorly trained armies in the middle east that dont really have the training.  Maybe they do have good radars they just understimated there ability and if it could detect F-117 do you think they would tell us? no

For this reason alone, I would be skeptical of any assertion that they have some magic bullet against stealth technology."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,lordtema,-6,Thu Jul 16 02:43:57 2015 UTC,How can we know? Russia never goes public with its findings or research. Not long after the USSR fell they found rocket technology that the west considered impossible to produce.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,dubious_orb,5,Thu Jul 16 02:55:56 2015 UTC,"Two different things. The R-73 was found to be more advanced than NATO had assumed, and the requirements for the AIM-9x were subsequently reviewed afterwards.  Russia doesn't make junk. Their hardware is capable and always has been. But in areas like radar and stealth, the US maintains an edge due to a much more accomplished materials science research sector. Russia will be playing catch up there for a while. They're also pretty short on military funding these days."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dgb4s,videogamesdisco,5,Thu Jul 16 03:01:57 2015 UTC,"Stealth technology is a bit of a misnomer. Stealth aircraft aren't completely invisible to radar in all conditions, they're just damn hard to track. They're built with specific materials and geometry to reflect very little radio energy, and what is deflected is scattered.   But if you know stealth aircraft are in the area, and they're traveling in predictable flight patterns allowing you to be aware that they're around even if your radar can't pick them up, it's not infeasible that a radar-guided missile got lucky.   Fiddling with settings on the radar wouldn't do it; they just took a pot-shot at an aircraft that they knew based on predictable flight paths would be in the area, and they got lucky. Any notion of ""figuring them out"" was just propaganda to try to make the bombers gun-shy."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dden4,acets,33,Wed Jul 15 17:25:43 2015 UTC,There's no statute of limitations for murder (in the US at least.)
UnresolvedMysteries,3dden4,FAST_AND_GREAT,22,Wed Jul 15 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on the state and the degree.  Really? Downvotes? Ok, here is a source cited:  Tennessee:  Tenn. Code § 40-2-101(b)   (a)  A person may be prosecuted, tried and punished for an offense punishable with death or by imprisonment in the penitentiary during life, at any time after the offense is committed.  (b)  Prosecution for a felony offense shall begin within:  (1)  Fifteen (15) years for a Class A felony;  (2)  Eight (8) years for a Class B felony;  (3)  Four (4) years for a Class C or Class D felony; and  (4)  Two (2) years for a Class E felony.    Second Degree Murder is a Class A felony not punishable by more than 60 years in prison.  Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-210  (2014)   39-13-210.  Second degree murder.  (a) Second degree murder is:  (1) A knowing killing of another; or  (2) A killing of another that results from the unlawful distribution of any Schedule I or Schedule II drug, when the drug is the proximate cause of the death of the user.  (b) In a prosecution for a violation of this section, if the defendant knowingly engages in multiple incidents of domestic abuse, assault or the infliction of bodily injury against a single victim, the trier of fact may infer that the defendant was aware that the cumulative effect of the conduct was reasonably certain to result in the death of the victim, regardless of whether any single incident would have resulted in the death.  (c) Second degree murder is a Class A felony.   So yes, while the majority of states do not have a statue of limitations, some do."

The first cousin is Henry Parker. Henry and Connie are siblings. Connie refused to help, but said that Lloyd claimed that he had been carrying ground beef in the duffle bags and that it had gone off. Other witnesses (presumably neighbors) remember the fire, which burned for several days and smelled like cremation! I'm kind of surprised that no one reported the fire to the authorities, but I don't know if they just didn't want to mess with that family, or just had anti-authority views, which would be common down there."

Probably teenagers, and they were probably still pretty innocent given that they lived in a pre-cable TV world (and decades before the internet). It sounds like they were still living at home and their mother was telling them to help him. Even if they did suspect something terrible was happening, they would likely have thought that saying anything would get their mother into deep trouble. You're also getting into Appalachia, and many in the community would be unfriendly to law enforcement, so it may not have occurred to them to do anything other than keep the secret."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dden4,Bluecat72,7,Thu Jul 16 14:45:43 2015 UTC,Two duffle bags that weigh like 70 lbs full of rotten ground beef. Why would anyone be in possession of that much ground beef in the first place? Sounds like they were used to this dude being sketchy.

She and a friend went missing from Roanoke a couple of years after this, but according to this article the main suspect in their disappearance had a house in Bedford County. Maybe there's a chance he and Welch were acquaintances or that Tammy Akers and Welch were related in some way.  Ninja edit: If Henry Parker and Connie Akers are siblings, Akers might be her married name. But still, it's pretty interesting to me that two more young girls disappeared nearby not too long after this and are rumored to be buried in the same county."

It's not just these two lovely kids...for me, it's every child that is attacked and killed by a grown man.  How is that justified in a man's mind, and seriously how on earth is it justified in the mind of their accessory (brother, wife, etc)?

Maybe he thought it was something to do with hunting.  I don't know if murder would be the first thing that crossed my mind in a similar situation.

I've read enough scary shit to know that is something better left unknown to me, or else I'm going to have something imprinted in my mind that I will regret.

UnresolvedMysteries,3dden4,Bluecat72,8,Wed Jul 15 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"So, police had a composite sketch of Lloyd Welch from 1975. A girl saw him staring so intently at the two Lyon girls that she confronted him in the mall. She went to police after they went missing and gave them a description of that man, who now, Welch admits, was him.   He also came forward to police just a few days after, when attention started being paid to what has come to be known as the ""tape recorder man"" (a guy who was walking around in that mall, and others, with a tape recorder asking kids to speak into it) in the media, saying that he saw the tape recorder man putting the girls into a car. He failed a polygraph when he admitted he was lying about seeing the tape recorder man.    In 2013, new detectives examined the case and starting delving into Welch. They saw his two more recent assault convictions and also realized that he resembled the sketch of the guy who'd been staring at the girls. That's what led them to start re-investigating him recently.   Interesting stuff. Even after 40 years, there were still little clues out there. Now, I hope the prosecutors can return a ""no body"" conviction on this. The Lyons were Catholic so perhaps the girls wore crucifixes that survived the fire and were found on the site in Va., something that would tie back to them found on site. Anyway, just spit ballin' but I hope they are able to convict on this."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dden4,ReginaldDwight,3,Thu Jul 16 15:37:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, I heard this expressed many times by the family members. I think the other thing that makes me chafe when I read ""closure"" is that it feels synonymous with ""moving on"" as in, ""now you can move on"", and I don't think these families ever move on."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dden4,let_the_damn_dog_out,8,Thu Jul 16 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly (and I'm a she). ""Closure"" seems to be such a common comment in response to horrible incidents like this one that is basically, to me, becoming a cliche; ""I hope the family finds some closure now"" always gets trotted out right about now.   I remember hearing a family member of a murder victim express his feelings on this subject so eloquently that it made me realize how expressing ""I hope they've found closure"" feels like lip service. Yes, it is good to know what happened and it is relieving to know that someone is finally being brought to justice, but for the victim's (victims' in this case) families, so many times, it does not bring any solace."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dden4,let_the_damn_dog_out,6,Thu Jul 16 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"I hear you.  I think closure does not have a strict definition, and unless we are in the shoes of these family members, we don't really have the ability to define what closure would mean to them.  I think a lot of surviving family members of missing persons have set their own definition of closure...as in, ""God, if you just show me ___, then I will let this burden go.""  It is most definitely a thing.  Just not an easily definable thing,"

UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,circle_,59,Wed Jul 15 02:44:13 2015 UTC,It's become more and more clear that Owens is responsible.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,oldgeezerguy,27,Wed Jul 15 04:01:04 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more.  I think when it's all unraveled, Owens will also have been found to have had a relationship with Misty.  After all she was seen driving his car after the murder and before it was found with the puppy and lipstick lips on the rear windshield.  I hope that Owens will just tell us what happened so that we will indeed know the truth."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,BarryZuckerkornAAL,12,Wed Jul 15 11:33:58 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, it was mentioned in the Disappeared episode that someone believed they saw Zebb's car being driven by someone who could have been Misty. It was an isolated report and far from conclusive."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,DivideByGodError,6,Wed Jul 15 11:59:53 2015 UTC,And the car seat was up for someone much shorter than Zebb or RJO
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,beingpoliteisrude,4,Thu Jul 16 01:05:54 2015 UTC,It was stated on the Disappeared episode so I can't link it per se.  A couple came forward to police and said they saw someone driving zebb's car and they gave a description.  A police sketch artist did a sketch and it looked exactly like Misty.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,BuckRowdy,10,Wed Jul 15 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"And the police sketch artist presumably knew about the case, including a general idea of what misty looked like which he could have potentially allowed to influence his interpretation of the witness testimony. Not necessarily saying she wasn't in fact driving the car, more just saying that eyewitness testimony usually sucks so we can't really say anything conclusive."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,MustacheEmperor,5,Wed Jul 15 15:33:49 2015 UTC,Yeah that's very possible. But it's also equally as possible that Misty was driving the car. I don't believe that some random person who hasn't been named yet is responsible for this.  I think Owens and or Misty's boyfriend is responsible.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,BuckRowdy,4,Wed Jul 15 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's unlikely that a random person(s) found Z. Quinn's car abandoned, decided to use it for whatever length of time, left behind a live puppy, a jacket, some bottles, a hotel key card, and painted lips and exclamation marks on the rear window. Finally disposing the vehicle at a location near the hospital where Z. Quinn's family worked and the college he attended.  Little Pigs BBQ, where Z. Quinn's car was found"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Qolx,3,Thu Jul 16 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah what are the odds of that?  The live puppy has got to be one of the weirdest aspects to a missing persons case that I have ever heard of.  Just off the top of my head it could be that Owens bought Misty a puppy as a gesture and that Misty didn't want it or couldn't take it so it was left by either of them in the car knowing that it would be found. Who knows the real reason though?  It bothers me that A person fitting Misty's description was seen driving the car.  IIRC the witness didn't come forward until the police released info about Quinn's car. They had spotted Misty before they even knew that that car belonged to Quinn, if I'm not mistaken."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,BuckRowdy,2,Fri Jul 17 05:48:11 2015 UTC,"I'll say upfront that I think Misty and her boyfriend were involved in some way. And she may have even driven the car. The weirdness surrounding the page is just too strange to be dismissed.   However, playing devil's advocate, it really isn't outside the realm of possibility that someone who knew Misty and had heard rumors deliberately gave them a false tip to help police/get a reward/get back at her. To me, it seems a little odd that someone would remember seeing a random car and the license plate, and the description of the driver that meant nothing to them at the time. I mean, how many times in your life have you memorized a license plate on a random car? And were able to cough that up several days/weeks later? If they didn't know it was a stolen car, why would they remember it? Maybe the lips and exclamation points were already on the car and they thought that was weird. But even then, I probably wouldn't remember that much detail. I certainly wouldn't jot down the license plate. It would be different if the car was all over the news and someone called police right away, but to get the tip afterward is a bit bizarre."

At any rate, the way a polygraph works leaves a lot of room for doubt about what it's actually telling you. It can be argued that the wrong questions were asked or that they were phrased the wrong way; apparent indications of deception can be attributed to other factors such as stress or anxiety unrelated to deception; etc.   Personally, I don't put much stock in polygraph results because they involve a lot of interpretation of limited data.

The supposed ""car crash"" that Owen didn't report smells fishy. Similarly, the half-baked story about him and Quinn going to look at a car Quinn was interested in purchasing doesn't make sense. Who goes out to look at cars in the late night hours?   If Owens did murder Quinn, which I think is apparent now and has been, then there are a few questions that remain: Who paged Quinn that night? Who did Quinn call? If Owens murdered Quinn, then why? If Owens murdered Quinn for petty reasons, then why did he drop Quinn's car off with the puppy dog and key?"

UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,SinglesRazor,25,Wed Jul 15 03:42:55 2015 UTC,"I've always believed Owens and Misty (and possibly her boyfriend too) were involved somehow, but my question is to what extent? Which one set poor Zebb up, which one killed him, whose idea was it to kill him in the first place and why?   I've been following this case closely for a long time now and I think I've come to my own theory of what happened that night. Feel free to critique and tear it apart.  Basically, the page from the aunt's house was a setup to get Zebb alone. Misty and her mom were close friends of Zebb's aunt, and may have had access to the house - probably not a key, but something as simple as knowing the aunt usually didn't lock a certain window or the backdoor. Having the call come from the aunt's house would lend more credibility to the setup.   Misty calls Zebb, claiming his aunt was in trouble. Something like ""We came over to visit and she's lying on the floor, I think she had a heart attack, please hurry!"" Zebb, frantic, tears off into the night and arrives at the house to find Misty and/or the boyfriend.  They kidnap Zebb and take him to another location to ""teach him a lesson"" about leaving Misty alone. (Owens came into the picture again at some point - maybe he got to the aunt's house before Zebb, or immediately went to the predetermined location where the beating was going to take place). I get the feeling they didn't plan to kill him. I think they meant to just beat him up, but the beating was so severe that Zebb ended up dying.  At this point, you have three people who know they are now in deep, deep shit and they need to find a way to get rid of the body. Where they put his body is anyone's guess, but it was possibly on Owens's property. He is given some of the evidence and tasked with disposing of it, which he did (or, well, tried to) by burning it in a section of his yard that he often burned unwanted items in. To further cover it up, he tells people he's planning on building a fish pond and begins that project, but ultimately decides to drop it (too costly, too much work, maybe too risky... who knows).  Misty and/or the boyfriend take(s) the car. They drive out of the area to dispose of some of the other evidence, and stay the night in a hotel. I think that's when it really started to sink in that Zebb was dead, and one or both of them began to feel guilt about what they had done. The puppy in the car could have been a way of apologising to Zebb's parents. Murderers will sometimes try to ""make up"" for their crimes by giving gifts to the victim's family - in one case, a teenaged killer gave the grieving family of his victim a card with around $20 in it only a few days after stabbing their daughter to death. They then put the car in a location where they knew it would be recovered quickly.  The pair of lips drawn on the car... I'm really not sure. There are so many interpretations you can come to. I know some have suggested it meant ""puppy love"", but it could be as simple as a way to bring more attention to the car.  And then Owens, Misty and the boyfriend kept silent for 15 years... until just a few months ago, when Owen killed the Cobbs.   Also, something I just thought of that I haven't seen anybody touch on: Zebb's aunt said the house looked normal besides a couple of pictures being out of place. What pictures were those? It'd be very interesting if they had Zebb in them, it's almost like a small sign of guilt for the beating they were about to give him.   It's far from a perfect theory, but it's the only one I can think of atm that explains most (if not all) of the strange things in this case."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Sarandana,11,Wed Jul 15 05:33:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like the puppy was to draw attention to the car. Someone wanted it found. I am torn on whether Wesley (misty's boyfriend) and Jason were in on things together or whether Jason was on Zebb's side, but it's tough to dismiss the phone call.   Of course it's possible it's a total coincidence that Misty snuck out, snuck over to Ina's house and called him, but their denial is pretty weird."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Meow__Bitch,3,Wed Jul 15 07:00:34 2015 UTC,But what about Zebb showing up at the hospital later that night claiming to have been in a second car accident?
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,teen-laqueefa,19,Wed Jul 15 05:38:24 2015 UTC,Owens was treated at the hospital and said his injuries were caused by a second accident. my theory has always been that Owens' injuries were defensive from Zebb.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Hysterymystery,8,Wed Jul 15 06:22:57 2015 UTC,"That's the general conclusion; that there was no car accident and it was just a fight with Zebb.   I do have a secondary theory that him and Zebb came in contact with Misty's boyfriend (and whomever) and both Zebb and Owens were on the receiving end of things. Zebb died, Owens just had moderately serious injuries. Boys will do almost anything for a girl they think they love. Zebb may have not been going to look at a car at all. Maybe he said ""Hey Jason, let's go rough up Wesley to make him go away"". They tried, they failed."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Qolx,3,Wed Jul 15 22:03:01 2015 UTC,"That's a possibility but, if that's the case, why would Owens end his side of the story at Long Shoals Rd? If Owens and Quinn had direct physical contact with Wesley Smith (Misty Taylor's boyfriend) and/or knows W. Smith injured/killed Quinn, why would Owens keep that hidden? Especially after becoming the ""big"" person of interest in the case?"

UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Alice_Greenfingers,2,Wed Jul 15 06:47:19 2015 UTC,Best explanation about the lips and puppy I've seen so far.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Hysterymystery,11,Wed Jul 15 06:51:27 2015 UTC,the thing that is the strangest to me is how Zebb's aunt gave alibis for both Misty and Wesley on the night of Zebb's disappearance.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,april_glowers,9,Wed Jul 15 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"No kidding. Clearly someone amongst the four of them called Zebb that night. If it really has nothing to do with anything, why lie?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Meow__Bitch,8,Wed Jul 15 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting this!  I remember reading about this case a few months ago on here.  One of the stranger cases I've ever read about, and so frustrating how witnesses obviously know more than they are saying."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Hysterymystery,14,Wed Jul 15 22:33:10 2015 UTC,"He did it. There's no way that the last person who saw Zebb alive, had a fishy story about going to see a car for sale, had a fender bender with Zebb, watched him mysteriously drive off after a phone call with no explanation, and then tried calling in sick for him the next day just happened to murder others.... That would be one hell of a coincidence. Motive is another story.  There are some big pieces of the puzzle that remain unanswered.  Was Misty involved? Just because she had an angry boyfriend, doesn't mean she or her boyfriend had anything to do with the crime. I've been caught up in a teenaged love triangle that involved many emotions, but that doesn't mean it turned deadly. It's not that out of the ordinary. Although his case has focused on the Misty situation heavily doesn't mean Zebb didn't meet some other random foul play (Owens). She was seen driving his car according to a witness, but they could have easily been mistaken.  The page from his aunt/possible break-in... I admit is super fishy. BUT again, could be a red herring. Perhaps there was a technological mishap with pager. Maybe her house wasn't broken into, but she suspected it after hearing about the page? Or maybe she was involved...  The puppy and the lipstick drawing is the most puzzling to me. I cannot think of a possible logical answer to this piece of the puzzle in any relation to Zebb's disappearance. Maybe it too is another red herring... Someone was looking to abandon a puppy and found an unlocked car, left it in there, and drew the lips to draw attention/leave a message.... I don't know.  Anyway... Such an odd case with so many twists and turns. I hope there is some resolution soon."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Meow__Bitch,11,Wed Jul 15 03:42:15 2015 UTC,"I had an alternative scenario in my head that explained all the weirdness. I've posted it before and they mentioned it on the thinking sideways podcast (though, I'm not sure if I'm the first one who ever thought this or if this has been floated on websleuths).   So he's out with Robert Jason Owens who maybe isn't a super great guy, but has no plans to harm Zebb. They're just hanging out. Zebb gets a page from Misty from Aunt Ina's. So both Zebb and Owens go over there, but Wesley is there by then there's a confrontation. Zebb and Misty leave together and go stay in a hotel (the key card). Zebb tells Owens to call in sick for him for his shift.   Wesley is determined to find them, so he hunts down Owens and beats the crap out of him to get him to tell him where they went. He coughs it up, Wesley tracks them down, kills Zebb, and ditches the car somewhere. Owens keeps it quiet because he's terrified. So Misty is all distraught and she puts the car there, with a puppy in it, so it'll be found and Wesley will be caught.   Or maybe the call is a red herring and has nothing to do with anything and Owens put it out because he wanted to get caught. Certainly his recent behavior doesn't make any sense."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Hysterymystery,6,Wed Jul 15 07:12:03 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting theory, but why wouldn't Zebb call into work himself? I have to assume that Owens called into work pretending to be Zebb because Zebb was dead and Owens knew that."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Meow__Bitch,3,Wed Jul 15 18:16:55 2015 UTC,Beats me. Maybe he had Owens number but not Walmart's. Or maybe he knew he would not make it to work in a couple days because he would be with Misty.   Or maybe Zebb knew he was dead.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Hysterymystery,3,Thu Jul 16 00:50:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I just don't see any logical reason for him to not call in himself if he was alive. From what it sounds like, him and Owens were work acquaintances, not close friends. So I'm sure Zebb would be more likely to have his work's number rather than Owens'. Even if not, why not call Owens and ask for Walmart's number? I can't think of any logical reason for him to think ""hey let's have Owens call my work and PRETEND to be me to get time off, rather than just calling in myself!"".... It doesn't make any sense."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,BarryZuckerkornAAL,2,Thu Jul 16 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"Either I was drunk/high and was in no place to do so or I was afraid they'd be mad at me. I worked for one place that really laid it on thick if you ever had to call in. I even had a friend call and quit for me once. I wouldn't do that in my adult life, but it's absolutely something I did when I was 18-19ish.   On the flip side, I've called and impersonated friends to help them deal with insurance companies or other customer service issues. I was comfortable with that stuff and knew what to say and they weren't.   I'm certainly not saying that's what happened here. Obviously something went down that night. But behavior-wise, I don't think it's out of the realm of normal."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Meow__Bitch,6,Thu Jul 16 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"I wonder, if Zebb was actually looking at a vehicle, if he had a large sum of money on him. Perhaps this could have been Owens motive. Regardless of the reason, Owens is clearly a psychopath with no regard for the sanctity of human life."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,hotelindia,3,Thu Jul 16 22:30:29 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my best guess too.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,BarryZuckerkornAAL,8,Wed Jul 15 11:45:46 2015 UTC,"It's worth considering the car as a red herring, IMO. It was parked near the hospital where Zebb's mom worked, but also very close to the high school. What if the car was originally dumped elsewhere, someone found it with the keys in it, and took it for a joyride? The lips and exclamation point could just be ""thanks for the use of your car"" from someone who ditched it assuming it would be found and returned to the owner, not knowing it was part of a potential murder until it was too late to come forward."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Hysterymystery,5,Wed Jul 15 16:09:22 2015 UTC,It's also possible the page is a red herring. Perhaps Misty lied about the page cause she snuck out to send it and didn't want her boyfriend to know she was talking to Zebb.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,bz237,5,Wed Jul 15 10:25:32 2015 UTC,"I've definitely considered this. There's an outside possibility that Misty snuck out to call Zebb for innocent reasons, she lied about it so her boyfriend wouldn't find out, then her mom lied so Misty wouldn't get drawn into some missing persons case and Ina lied at the behest of her friend.   It just seems weird that that many people would be behaving so weird. If they legitimately had nothing to do with it, why wouldn't they just say ""Misty left for awhile and I don't know where she went""   It's just weird that more than one person would behave so suspiciously if they weren't involved."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,i_am_the_lizardqueen,3,Wed Jul 15 14:19:54 2015 UTC,Here is a good article in Spin Magazine. And another good article that I spotted the other day.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,Qolx,3,Wed Jul 15 06:25:45 2015 UTC,"I may have missed something, but is there any verifiable motive for Owens to have killed Quinn? I saw it postulated that Owens was involved with Misty, but has that been substantiated? I think Owens is guilty as fuck but I'm just curious about the motive, especially since Wesley had more of a motive to kill Quinn."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dc2x5,TheBestVirginia,3,Wed Jul 15 22:08:24 2015 UTC,"The strangest part of Quinn's case, for me, is the page. The page was sent sometime around 9pm- 10pm, Jan 2nd, 2000, from Ina Ustich's home. Ina Ustich is Zebb Quinn's paternal aunt; all accounts of the case assert that Quinn and Ustich interacted very, very little.  Ustich claims that she was having dinner at Tamra Taylor's double-wide trailer the night Z. Quinn disappeared, Jan 2nd, 2000. Tamra Taylor is Misty Taylor's mother (Misty Taylor was Quinn's love interest/crush). Misty and her boyfriend/baby daddy, Wesley Smith, were also present, having dinner, at T. Taylor's trailer. Tamra Taylor corroborates Ustich's claim.  Ina Ustich strongly asserts that she did not send the page message to Quinn. From here accounts vary. Some claim that when Ustich returned to her home later that night, she noticed some things were moved around (most accounts claim pictures) so she called the police to report a burglary yet nothing seems to have been stolen. Furthermore, Ustich claimed that the unknown intruder might have sent her nephew Quinn the page. Other accounts say that Ustich actually denied filing a police report. After some info related to Ustich made the news, Ustich called Quinn's mother to threaten her with a lawsuit for defamation if accusations pointed at Ustich.  Lastly, Ustich sold her property and moved to Tennessee, pursuing a job, soon after Quinn's disappearance. It's unclear whether Ustich had already planned to sell the property and relocate. Seemingly, Jerry Quinn (Zebb's father, Ustich's brother) went so far as to threaten Ustich with serious bodily harm on Ustich if she turned out to be somehow directly involved in his son's disappearance. That suggests J. Quinn did not know her sister planned to move to another State.  I find a random intruder paging Z. Quinn unlikely. Either Ustich herself provided access to her home (either gave the keys or if she was picked up) or someone(s) who knew where she would be and how long she'd be at that location took her keys and went to her home and sent the page."

I just have to wonder if the money for his car was going to be used for her to open a business with Misty's mom as was said in article I read. It seems with the events of that night all those plans changed. Seems odd to me. First someone was in her house then they weren't. All had same alibi...each other.

After this, it has been discovered that this likely happened with multiple babies at the same hospital.  Here's a link: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3065572/Black-mothers-claim-Missouri-hospital-kidnapped-babies-told-died.html  I think the speculation is that someone or multiple people at the hospital were basically stealing live babies, telling mothers the babies had died, and then presumably selling the babies to other parents."

UnresolvedMysteries,3dbn3z,Koolaidstory,3,Wed Jul 15 09:41:22 2015 UTC,The only reason I remembered it was because I watched the episode of cold case based on the case.
UnresolvedMysteries,3dbn3z,dymphnawolf,20,Wed Jul 15 13:33:13 2015 UTC,"Delimar Vera  There was a case in Philadelphia about a decade ago where a hispanic woman ""lost"" her daughter in a suspicious house fire a few days after the child's birth. Authorities concluded that the child died in the blaze, but she insisted the child had been kidnapped. Six years later, she was at a birthday party for an acquaintance and she spotted a girl that she was convinced was hers. Like, not just on appearance alone, but the child's mother had come to her house the day of the blaze (or the day before, I can't remember) and was just kind of acting weird. She had said she was some sort of relative and had had a baby the same day. She was fawning over the child...it was just kind of strange. So anyway, the biological mother told the girl she had gum in her hair and under the guise, she snipped off a few strands. When she tried to test the hair, she was told it needed the root. She ended up getting the police involved who investigated and confirmed that it was indeed her daughter.   From what I remember of the case, she was kind of in a weird position when she was given her daughter back because she really only fluently spoke Spanish; the child only spoke English. The child had been well taken care of for the most part. She went to private school, took dance classes, did pageants. The family she went back to was a poor immigrant family who wasn't able to give her that. Interesting case.   Pepper Smith  Another one was featured on Dateline a few years back. (Note: the story that is being told in this article doesn't appear to be entirely true. I'll get to that in a minute) On the first dateline episode, it told this story about how this woman named Pepper knew she was kidnapped when she was a child. Her parents were named Bob and Bobbi. Her mother had a big blonde bouffant and she remembered her bedroom. She was raised (and kidnapped) by a woman named Shirley alongside a girl named Renee. She managed to track down Bob and Bobbi during the episode and they had a reunion. They told her that they had adopted her at 3 months of age when a friend--the aforementioned Shirley--came to their door carrying this baby. She said the mother was a prostitute and drug addict and couldn't care for her. Bob and Bobbi had struggled with infertility so they took her in without asking any questions. They managed to legally adopt her before long and raised her until the age of four, when Shirley came by with a slightly older girl named Renee for a playdate. They were staying in a nearby hotel and asked if Pepper (who was being called Rhonda at the time) could come over for a slumber party. Bobbi agreed. Back at the hotel, Shirley packed them up and left town within the hour, taking Pepper with her.   So after the dateline episode aires, a woman comes forward claiming to be not only Pepper's biological mother, but also Renee's. She claims they were both kidnapped from her. And not only the two of them, she says they also have a brother that was kidnapped by Shirley as well! Dateline tracks down the brother, who was adopted by a woman with health problems so severe she couldn't care for him before being shuttled between foster homes. So this is where it gets a little hazy. The biological mother tells a story where she gave birth to the son and Shirley was the babysitter, who then kidnapped the kids while she was in the hospital. Well, the son--who is four years younger than Pepper--was obviously not kidnapped when Pepper was three months old. But somehow Pepper got to Bob and Bobbi's when she was three months old. The older child was 7 when Pepper was kidnapped from Bob and Bobbi's (and allegedly when this triple kidnapping took place). If she's 7, she would have some memory of being kidnapped. She has none. So the story that the biological mother is telling made the rounds in the media and Dateline acted like it was true, but it really appears that what happened was she willingly gave the 3 children to Shirley at three different points in time. So Pepper probably wasn't kidnapped twice. But Bob and Bobbi's story appears legit. She was really kidnapped from their home and raised by her kidnapper."

If we were looking at the story of a 10 year old vs. a 10 month old, to me, the likelihood of the infant being raised in a ""normal"" setting despite having been kidnapped is astronomically higher.   Just a handful of real stories that make me feel this is more possible (thought necessary not highly likely or ""viable"" as you call it in each and every case of a very small child being taken):  A recent story from South Africa: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/02/27/south_african_woman_kidnapped_at_birth_reunited_with_family_after_meeting.html  Calina White was already posted here, but: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/nyregion/20kidnap.html?_r=0  Paul Fronzack is often posted here: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334802/Paul-Fronczak-Man-raised-wrong-parents-thought-baby-taken-1964.html  From Chile: http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/25/americas/chile-stolen-baby-reunion/  Illegal adoptions were once somewhat ""common"" in Ireland in homes run by nuns for young, unwed, pregnant girls: https://gamacavei.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/report-into-the-history-of-adoption-in-ireland-since-1922-by-adoption-rights-now/ ; http://www.irishcentral.com/news/2000-irish-children-were-illegally-adopted-in-us-from-magdalene-laundries-189789961-237563011.html (not the best sources, I'm sorry)   This article highlights similar hospital/adoption schemes: http://news.yahoo.com/forced-adoptions-for-unwed-mothers-around-the-globe.html  Edited to add this story, which is an example of women finding out after the fact that their hospital may have been involved in illegal kidnappings/adoptions schemes that was in the news recently out of St. Louis: http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/01/us/missouri-st-louis-lost-babies/  -- Because this is very timely, and was majorly in the news recently, it may be increasing the likelihood that someone sees a story of a missing baby and thinks adoption is possible.   I'm sure this sounds like I am a huge proponent of this being common, but I'm not. I do think it's probably very rare, though unfortunately has been common in different times and places in the past (i.e., the adopting out of babies from unwed mothers out of convents in Ireland seems to fit this theme). I also think it's possible today, still, in the case of very small children. Again, I don't think this is a ""viable option in every missing child"" case, or even all that plausible in general, I simply think it is more likely in the case of an infant who has no memories and may not look ""unique"" so to speak, in comparison to even a toddler who may resist a stranger or who may have memories of a previous home."
UnresolvedMysteries,3dbn3z,happilythree,11,Wed Jul 15 03:43:07 2015 UTC,"I was going to say almost exactly this. From the details I've read/heard about regarding infant abductions, I'd even go as far as to surmise that likely a majority of infant abductions by a stranger are committed out of desire for a child - by [extremely unstable/mentally ill] women often unable to have a child of their own... Basically a slightly less sadistic (or perhaps less surgically-self-confident) but similar-minded version of the women who cut open a near-due pregnant woman and steal their unborn baby right out of the womb.   I'm pretty sure I heard about most of these infant abduction cases on Unsolved Mysteries since, as you pointed out, abducted infants are so difficult to identify and locate and solve such cases. And I recently heard a case in which a woman and her boyfriend tried having a kid for years until it became clear she's infertile, as a result her class-act boyfriend left her. So in a quest to get him back, she pretended to be pregnant for a bit until he told her to quit lying, at which point she realized she needed to acquire a baby, stat. So she kidnapped her neighbor's newborn (and killed the mother in the process). So in her case she kidnapped primarily to get her man back but I'd also say both of them desired children rather badly."

She does silly things like constantly loan money to drug addicts. My favorite example:  My uncle is two years younger than my mom (he is 52.) He makes about $20,000 more a year than she does. He is also addicted to crack and has been an active user for most of his adult life. He doesn't own a vehicle (they live in an area where public transportation is nil) and lives in a $100/wk hotel. He maintains a good job and pretty much always has, but he lives for pay day.  Each week, he gets paid on Wednesday. He pays his rent and she drives him to the grocery store for about $50 in groceries. Around Saturday, he will call her for a ride to the laundromat. When she gets there, he will ask to ""borrow"" the money to wash his clothes. She will give it to him, simply because she doesn't want him to have to come do laundry at her house. Around Monday, he will call again and tell her that he is out of food and money (usually he tells her something like ""I loaned $50 to suchandsuch so he could pay his child support and not go to jail."") and will ask her for help with groceries and cigarettes.  This happens every week and has been happening for about 5 years. Like clockwork.  This is just her long term problem, she has had several others over the years. She knows that what she is doing is wrong, but she has to help him because she loves him and he ""doesn't have anyone else."""

UnresolvedMysteries,3dbn3z,verifiedshitlord,19,Wed Jul 15 13:55:16 2015 UTC,No. Using money that could be used to pay for electricity to run the TV for drugs = neglect.   As for no toys? That's a sad fucking childhood with no toys at all.   I take it you don't pay too much attention to news stories about abused kids.

This is an old case, but still very interesting. A woman who called herself ""Julia Otis"" posed as a social worker and told Mary Agnes' mother Catherine that she had been sent to help the family (they were very poor and Catherine was still a teen and had two children and another on the way). Julia asked if she could take Mary Agnes out to go shopping, and despite being hesitant at first, Catherine eventually agreed. They never saw Mary Agnes again. However, the day after she was taken they received a letter from Julia saying that she had taken Mary Agnes to California and that they would return in two months. Two weeks after that, the family received a letter from a woman who called herself ""Alice Henderson,"" saying that Julia had lost her own child which is why she had decided to take Mary Agnes. The police think that these letters were written by the same person. What's really interesting about this case is that years later a woman believed that she was Mary Agnes as she had been adopted soon after Mary Agnes was taken and resembled the family. Testing determined that she was in fact a Moroney, however it was later found out that she was not Mary Agnes. Mary Agnes was never found but it's very likely she was taken by Julia and raised as her own. I just hope she had a good life (Mary Agnes would be 87 now)."

According to the Canton Daily Ledger article from Aug 24, 2007:   McClaskey’s skull was turned over to police in 1993 by a boy who found it in Fulton County four years earlier and thought he had discovered American Indian remains, said Dan Daly, who was sheriff at the time.  At the time, DNA testing wasn’t advanced enough to positively identify the skull. But last year a test at the University of North Texas compared the DNA from the skull to that of McClaskey’s family members. The test found it was 6 million times more likely than not that it was Kim McClaskey, Daly told the jury.    A forensic anthropologist told police the skull had been fractured and that McClaskey had sustained a blunt force injury to her nasal bridge when or shortly after she died."

William Reinbold was imprisoned in Peoria.  I feel that's likely a red herring though.  He would have been imprisoned during the time the letter was sent, and likely the prison wouldn't let a letter like that out without looking it over first (I've heard that jails do this to discourage torment of victims by prisoners).  Not to mention that he claims he never killed her, plus, as stated in other comments on ops links, people have stated that this doesn't fit his MO.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d9hfk,fourbet,18,Wed Jul 15 11:51:52 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, Deschaine is a clean cut, Bowdoin graduate who had no record. Could he have been in the wrong place at the wrong time? There were rumors about a relative of Sarah Cherry's who was a pedophile and moved to Florida hastily during the trial. Some of the evidence seems to point at the time of death (which is difficult to pin down) occurring during a time when Deschaine was in custody. What goes against Deschaine was his drug usage. He was so blitzed that he couldn't give a coherent account of his time in the woods."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d9hfk,vajabjab,12,Tue Jul 14 15:56:05 2015 UTC,"If he did commit this crime I don't think he did this alone. But there is just too much evidence pointing to his involvement. Here's what sticks out to me:  1) As you mentioned, the drug use. It doesn't implicate him for murder but his emotional, detailed confession makes me think he was involved while under the influence. There seemed to be some heavy guilt there.  2) The rope from Dechaine's truck. His truck was quite a distance from the body and there was no evidence she was ever in the truck. However, rope cut from his truck was found 200 ft. from Cherry's body. This implies he was near the body/scene of the crime sometime around her death.  3) His auto repair receipts in the driveway where she had been babysitting. Dechaine claims they were planted to frame him. Did he have any known enemies? Why would someone want to frame this clean-cut grad as a murderous pedophile?   4) Dechaine emerging disoriented from the same woods she was killed in on the day she disappeared looking rather distraught. He had cuts and bruises on him. Prosecution argued these cuts weren't deep but the girl was twelve. She probably couldn't fight back that much. I don't think this should be ruled out.   5) The time of death. She may not have died right away. As awful as it sounds she could have laid there suffering for quite a while before passing away. At this time, Dechaine could be in custody. The coroner also mentioned she could have been dead for more than 36 hours.   6) Lying about place of employment and residence. Sounds like a guy who has something to hide. Then again, he might be avoiding drug charges but why give a full name?   7) The dog tracked Dechaine's scent from his truck up to 100 ft. from the body. Again placing him near the scene of the crime.   What doesn't add up to me?  How did Dechaine contact his wife to confess when he was in the woods the entire time? Cell phones were not around in 1988. He had not returned home in that time. This could prove the confession was drug-fueled bogus.  Why is he placed so close to the scene but there is no DNA on the girl? Was he an accomplice? Helping out his dealer? Why wouldn't he sell that person out by now?  Did anyone look into the pedophile rumor? That seems like a significant lead..."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d9hfk,fourbet,11,Tue Jul 14 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"According to the news articles that came out around May when he was in court seeking a retrial, a PI firm got access to the DNA of the alleged Florida pedo but it wasn't a match to the DNA sample from her fingernail clippings.   I don't really see unknown DNA on fingernails as exculpatory evidence, it could have come from the kid she was babysitting or just contamination. I understand there is no smoking gun in this case but it seems pretty clear this guy was involved.  He gave a false name, false occupation, attempted to hide his keys so they couldn't access his truck. He claimed to have 'lost' his truck while doing a bunch of drugs and deciding to go fishing in random woods he was unfamiliar with...  Then by cosmic coincidence he left behind some material from his truck both at the scene of the murder and the location of the house she was babysitting at which are both quite far apart. It would take a pretty unbelievably lucky and quick witted psychopath to frame someone who just happened to be in the area so thoroughly."

Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Establishing ownership of the scarf is critical because the justice referred several times to the possible significance of a partial DNA profile obtained from the scarf from which Dechaine could not be excluded.  Dechaine claims that the scarf was his, a gift from a friend (the son of a retired Maine Law School professor), and that the killer removed the scarf from Dechaine’s parked truck. Obviously, Dechaine’s DNA could be expected to be found on his own scarf, and DNA from the scarf could have been transferred to other clothing it contacted.  Not mentioned was the more complete DNA profile obtained from the scarf from which the prime alternate suspect cannot be excluded.""  William Bunting  Whitefield  Share"

He was poor, illiterate and Italian in France who were not too happy to have or friendly with communist sympathizers in their backyards. That right there meant they were pretty much ostracized and I guarantee they were not accepted and kept mainly to themselves.   He held his pants up with a cord, not even a belt. They had a tiny piece of land.... He couldn't get up from being on the ground and walked with difficulty and a cane....there is so much in this story...  France (and much of Europe) was still devastated by the war. Rationing only ended for political reasons in late 1945 and food and commodities were still very scarce when this murder took place. Even England didn't end rationing until 1954 to give you an example...    It sounds like he confessed to save his son, Gustave, who was much younger and more capable and had already taken over the day to day operations of their farm.....   Its possible the French were going to haul away one of the sons with or without evidence just to get a conviction, and who better in the law's eye but the Italian commie who found them and conveniently lived right there.......

UnresolvedMysteries,3d7sgr,enderandrew42,11,Fri Jul 17 09:14:35 2015 UTC,A judge has to decide if that probable cause is enough to warrant the search of a home or property.   That's where the search warrant comes in.

In United States criminal law, probable cause is the standard by which persons acting under the color of law has the grounds to obtain a warrant for, or as an exception to the warrant requirements for, making an arrest or conducting a personal or property search, etc. when criminal charges are being considered. It is also used to refer to the standard to which a grand jury believes that a crime has been committed in conjunction with a preponderance of the evidence. This term comes from the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution:   An officer can bypass the warrant requirement for a search with sufficient probable cause.  If what you said was true, an officer could be walking down the street and hear someone say ""please help me, I'm being murdered"" and be unable to enter a building to assist because you think they need to go to a judge and get a warrant in every single case.  You are unequivocally mistaken on this issue.  The link even mentions specific use cases, such as trained dogs. If a trained dog identifies someone who might have drugs, that can allow an officer to search them without a warrant because the dog is providing probable cause for the search.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause#Use_of_trained_drug_dogs"

UnresolvedMysteries,3d7sgr,happilythree,20,Wed Jul 15 08:08:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, this is why I get really frustrated with ""Final words"" type claims on these posts.   It could mean that the mother and daughter had an understanding that the mother would come looking for her if there were any problems at any time. It could mean that her bike was unreliable and she wanted to have a ride home if necessary. It could be that the mom wasn't totally comfortable with her bike riding in a rural area, and the mom said something about it to Tara as she left, and Tara replied that the mom could always come get her if she was worried.   My point is, we have so little information about how (tone, mood) this was said, if it was a normal comment or a something out of the ordinary, etc. It sounds somewhat odd on paper but it could be benign in any number of scenarios."

I'm also incredibly clumsy & fall more than I care to admit - I've fractured my arm, sprained my ankles countless times. My sister has had to pick me up on a quad from one of these walks.

It's really easy to puncture a tire and get stuck walking home, pushing your bike with a flat. We wouldn't tell our parents to come look for us if it was a group of people or something, but I definitely told my parents that a few times when I was just running an errand on my bike or something like that.  Or, it being a small town, if this story is correct she could have known that those guys were after her and been worried. I actually tend to lean towards this story being true, but even so, I don't think you can read that much into her words."

However, I don't think it is strange that he doesn't talk or speak publicly about this incident.  It got tons of news coverage.  TONS.  Jeffery Dahmer's brother changed his last name, Elizabeth Smart was (and is now to some extent) notoriously mum about her trauma as well.

UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,lioninacoma-,0,Tue Jul 21 17:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm replying off the top of my head so I apologize for not having proper links at the moment. What I recall in terms of sexual abuse is this:   -Burke and JonBenet both had bathroom issues at times, with JonBenet still wetting the bed regularly at 6 and reports of Burke smearing walls with feces when he was younger, during the time Patsy was being treated for cancer  -In James Kolar's book he describes a box of chocolates smeared with feces found in JonBenet's bedroom by detectives. I have not read this anywhere else nor was there any testing done on the feces, apparently, but I don't doubt it.   -When asked about JonBenet's bedwetting, Burke sidestepped the question - saying something like it wasn't a big deal, when housekeepers and others claim it was a big deal and was something that happened frequently. Why would Burke care, or know to downplay it, when asked about JonBenet's bedwtting?   -Reports of books found in the Ramsey home on troubled children   It's not so much that there was overwhelming evidence of sexual abuse, but considering the murder, cover-up, and staged sexual assault, other facts are seen in a different light. Bedwetting and soiling can be innocuous, but when it is prolonged it can indicate some type of distress or abuse in a child. BOTH Burke and JonBenet exhibited these signs.   In addition, there was a reason JonBenet's death was covered-up and staged after the fact - whether because she was sexually abused prior to that night and the Ramsey's didn't want that fact to get out, or because she was being abused at the time of her death.   In any case, if Burke WAS abusing JonBenet, the odds are pretty high that he was abused himself. If he wasn't abused and was abusing her, the Ramsey's likely knew this long before the murder and didn't do anything about it.   And yes from what I have read he doesn't talk about it, which is not so strange in and of itself. I don't take his silence as a sign of guilt rather than the inevitable outcome of a botched investigation the Ramsey's were allowed to run."
UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,oldspice75,2,Tue Jul 14 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"I think some other commenter on this subreddit said that the Ramseys, if they had covered up Burke's guilt, probably did it because they had already lost one child and they instantly went into ""protection mode"" because they didn't want to lose another via incarceration. but I hadn't even thought about the fact that they could be covering it to avoid the history of abuse being uncovered. that's really interesting and definitely makes a lot of sense. and I actually hadn't heard about the Burke smearing his feces stuff."
UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,TrackmarksTrademarks,2,Tue Jul 14 20:18:27 2015 UTC,"I think that makes a lot of sense and that even if Burke did brutally assault and kill his sister, he was still their child, and having lost two now, they couldn't bear it. I just cannot fathom how a couple could maintain such silence for so long unless it was for their child. In addition, the Ramsey's cared about their name - and if Burke turned out to be an abuser, well, then who abused HIM?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,SagaCult,4,Tue Jul 14 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"I've always been in the ""Ramsey's did it"" camp and usually discounted the theory that it was Burke until someone else brought up this same thing.

The ever controversial 911 call, that at the least proves Burke was out of bed: http://jonbenetramsey.pbworks.com/w/page/11682511/The911Call The lack of entry points, meaning it must be someone in the house. John's lies about the window fit in here. Burke's fingerprints on the pineapple. This wouldn't be a big deal if Burke wasn't involved somehow: they'd just say ""oh Burke must have got up"". However the Ramsay's simply act like the pineapple doesn't exist. It's a weird thing that sticks out.  Burke is the only one who frequented the basement. The housekeeper didn't even know that room was there. Jonbenet's ""unusual"" wound on her back, matches the dimensions of Burke's trainset: http://i.imgur.com/6K9olBW.png Burke was too young to be considered a suspect initially and never properly investigated. Burke had been caught ""playing doctor"" according to friends of the Ramseys. Burke had been violent towards Jon Benet on several occasions: notably the Ramsey's owned books with titles like ""how come Johnny doesn't know right from wrong?""   I could go on. To say there's no evidence against Burke is to ignore everything."

She was sexually abused, but no sex took place. I imagine a 9 year old would be much more likely to abuse her this way though i.e. not having sex with her.  However, if Burke did murder her, then one or both of the parents know about it. There is no fucking way a 9 year old wrote that ransom note. How many 9 year olds even know of the word attache? It's clear a kid couldn't write that. I'm certain that if Burke killed her the parent/s covered it up.   Arghh, this case gives me a headache. So many different theories seem possible."

UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,therealac,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:55 2015 UTC,"Supposing that it's true that the knot was based on a Boy Scout knot, a large percentage of men in America and especially in the Western states have been involved in the Scouts at some point. Maybe that is a basic, simple knot which is why it is frequently taught to children. Maybe the knot suggests that some Mormon did it as much as Burke (while many males do Boy Scouts, the percentage of Mormon boys who participate is nearly all). Was John Ramsey or any other suspect a Scout (or Scout parent)? So if the knot is a Boy Scout knot, that would not limit the suspect pool very much at all, and is not even remotely evidence against Burke...  Hunter presumably signed the affidavit that there is no evidence to consider that Burke Ramsey is a suspect (just like I said). Maybe he did not want to sign that Burke was never considered a suspect, since every person in contact with Jon Benet should have been considered as a suspect from the start. I think that was just poor wording and he corrected it. Anyone's opinion of whether someone is a suspect is not, in itself, evidence anyway.  The Grand Jury did not charge the Ramseys with murder because the case against them was never at all definitive. Probably they charged them with child abuse because they nevertheless wanted to charge them with something after all their shady behavior and/or because they thought the treatment of Jon Benet as a pageant girl was exploitative, abusive and led to her endangerment. That is not evidence against Burke at all, and the Grand Jury never made any indication of Burke's guilt.  Beckner said no such thing in his AMA. He said that the unknown DNA is significant, but can't be proven to belong to the killer until that person is identified.  Kolar also irresponsibly implies that Burke is guilty but wouldn't come out and say it for fear of libel suits, which he couldn't defend against since he doesn't have any actual evidence either. The Jon Benet Ramsey case is a terrible example if you want to show that police or investigative professionals know what they are doing compared to any random person.  Burke waking and getting up is not evidence against him.  Not only were there several ways that someone could have entered the house, but there is the actual evidence of an unknown intruder who left the pube and DNA...  Anyone who was in the house obviously had access to the basement. Not evidence against Burke.  Burke touching the pineapple, if true, and owning the train set... so what? Two things anyone in the house had access to.  The thing about playing doctor is just gossip (like much of the ""case"" against Burke) and not evidence even if true. Go find a pair of siblings that never hit each other. And mentioning some book is weak even for you.  If Burke was guilty of Jon Benet's death, he would have been a deeply disturbed child with major personality problems. And yet Burke's subsequent life has been blameless, inconspicuous and uneventful since then. I think that it's very likely that a 9 year old who rapes and murders his little sister would be involved in further incidents as he goes through puberty, adolescence and young adulthood. Also, very few if any children can keep secrets for much time, even when not under tremendous pressure and scrutiny.  Jon Benet weighed 45 lbs. To what extent could a 9 year old boy (who might way 60-80 lbs, let's say) physically control and/or carry a 45 lb dead weight? I haven't read anything about signs of her being dragged. And does the head blow suggest a child's strength?  As I said, no evidence to back up this accusation against a child at all."
UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,comradehong,4,Sun Jul 19 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"/> If Burke was guilty of Jon Benet's death, he would have been a deeply disturbed child with major personality problems.  Mary Bell lived a normal life after her crimes. Her killings were personal (strangulation) and brutal. Yet she never showed any signs of major personality disorders or similar (despite an initial diagnosis of ASPD, which was later overturned) and in fact according to recent books received ""no more therapy than a child attending weekly sessions"". Burke attended weekly sessions into his late teens, and possibly still does. The Jamie Bulger killers, aside from a conviction for child pornography, both were considered to be ""needlessly detained"" in a mental hospital. Of course we don't really have anywhere to put children who kill, so perhaps it was best for them. Nevada-tan in Japan has no mental health problems and was released. Most child murderers, far from having ""major personality disorders"" and suffering for the rest of their lives with untold demons, turn out to not actually understand what they've done. Mary Bell and Bulger killers both were ""oblivious"" of the extent of their crimes. Nevada-tan had no idea what she'd done. You see, we want to see these children as the most evil of the evil, when actually; they're just children.   You're very good at ignoring the evidence and wording things like what you've said is the definitive answer, but you make several errors here:   JonBenet was not raped.  Burke was strong, and large for his age (early reports pegged him as 11 and 12, which is also what BPD assumed). He could pick up JonBenet because Patsy talked about him carrying her around on his back and giggling.  The blow to her head wasn't so much about force; it caught her in the right place. Tests done in a controlled environment showed it didn't require much force, and could have been done by almost anyone. Several factors played into that, including the batteries being loose inside and aiding the power of the swing slightly.  Hunter refused to sign the following: ""all questions relating to the involvement of Burke Ramsey were answered to myself and the police's satisfaction"", ""Burke Ramsey is not, and has never been a suspect in the investigation"" (here's a picture of that). What he did sign was saying that they had never engaged in any talks with the Ramsey's with regards to Burke's involvement. Isn't it somewhat suspicious though that he exonerates every single family member except Burke? No evidence there, obviously.  The Pineapple is a point because of this: The Ramsey's act like it doesn't exist. When questioned about it they got very angry. Pineapple was found in JonBenet's stomach; Burke Ramsey's fingerprints are on a dish found on the side containing pineapple, along with fainter prints of Patsy's that they believe got there form putting it away. The reason the pineapple is significant is why are the Ramsey's so weird about the pineapple? Like you said, it's a totally innocent object that could be easily explained away; why nto say ""Burke must have woken up""? Unless they knew something and could't say Burke had woken up - Why not say ""JonBenet had pineapple yesterday"", why act like it doesn't exist and refuse to answer questions about it? It's weird.  Yes, Burke being the only person who spent a lot of time in the basement isn't evidence of any kind. Even though the fact that the housekeeper was unaware of the Room JonBenet was found in seems to suggest it would have to be someone intimately familiar with the household, even more familiar than the housekeeper, which basically leaves family members. The pubic hair and the DNA - you missed off the hi-tec footprints too. They are outliers, and puzzling ones because they're so incongruous to everything else, but District Attorney Mary Keenan Lacy exonerating the Ramsey's based on small amounts of DNA, a hair and footprints was called ""surprising"" by the FBI, so excuse me if I hold back on calling the people who gave up on finding their daughters killer after two years (they removed the reward and dismantled the website).  EDIT 4/21/15  The ""pubic hair"" was sourced to Patsy Ramsey. The ""unknown hand print"" was sourced to Melinda Ramsey. Just the micro, microscopic DNA traces and the hi-tec footprints to identify now EDIT: http://www.acandyrose.com/s-evidence-prints-hand-foot.htm   Footprint: several people owned hi-tec shoes, including Burke Ramsey Handprint: Melinda Ramsey Hair: Patsy Ramsey's underarm hair. DNA tested.   Oh, about that Evidence, what did Beckner say?   Sorry, I can't provide the rebuttal, as I agree with Jim Kolar. Exonerating anyone based on a small piece of evidence that has not yet been proven to even be connected to the crime is absurd in my opinion. You must look at any case in the totality of all the evidence, circumstances, statements, etc. in coming to conclusions. Mary Lacy, the DA who said the DNA exonerated them made up her mind years before that a mother could not do that to a child, thus the family was innocent. Even though we pointed out that it is not unheard of for mothers do such things.....and you would know that if you just watched the news.  The transcript of the 911 call:    "" 'Help me, Jesus, help me, Jesus.' That was clearly Patsy's voice.  'Please, what do I do?' Burke said.  'We're not speaking  oto you,' Hickman heard John Ramsey say.  Patsy screamed again. 'Help me, Jesus, help me, Jesus.'  And then, more clearly, Burke said, 'What did you find?' ""   Clearly, no evidence there of anything. Again, if Burke had got up, why did the Ramsey's lie and say he didn't? Ok, how did the person get in, baring in mind all the doors were locked, the house had an incredibly unusual layout (owing to having been expanded upon both up and outwards), bearing in mind that the BPD considered it ""implausible"" that someone would have been able to find the basement without knowing where it was (it was obscured by being at an odd angle), further bearing in mind the light snow fall revealing no footprints, further bearing in mind the total lack of those all so important ""hi-tec"" footprints in the rest of the house, further bearing in mind that the lightswitch was in an usual place and BPD found it ""implausible"" (that word again) that an intruder would have been able to find it, further bearing in mind that the broken window had spider webbing and grass growing between it proving it hadn't been disturbed, further bearing in mind that John Ramsey suddenly decided he'd left a door open that night that the police had found locked and bolted in the morning... so where did this person come from? I'm assuming they were already in the house, and this is simply a Hinterkaifeck style case in your eyes, otherwise I can't see it.  I admit, I got parts of the Beckner and Kolar AMA's up. My fault. I have PTSD, so my short term memory isn't awesome. He did say this about Kolar:   Well, I thought Jim Kolar's book, Foreign Faction was very good. Not sure I accept his theory, but he lays out the evidence very well and tells it without the emotion that others have done.  Beckner very, very clearly implies it's someone in the house.  We've never seen the Grand Jury transcripts, all we know of them is what Kolar said, so I'm ignoring everything you've said there. The case was considered strong enough to go to trial, Alex Hunter refused to because he was ""afraid of the consequences to his reputation"". Why would he be ""afraid"" for trying the Ramseys (which they had enough evidence against according to every source I can find), unless there was another element that we were unaware of? Your boy scouts point? I saved this til last, because you're going to love this one. The tourniquet instructions were changed in 1994, to bring them in line with modern first aid techniques, and Burke Ramsey's year would have been amongst the first to use them. They also introduced the bridge building, with the tourniquet, at around the same time (bridge building has always existed, but it was a clever idea to tie in the first aid training to it). John and older scouts would have tied it differently, but Burke would have tied it just like that. Burke was also at that stage in his training as he had his pen knife. Now evidence there though.  I leave you with Burke's psych interview, which disturbed the doctor enough for him to ask BPD if Burke was a suspect. Imagine that, someone having that theory years before Kolar wrote his widely-praised, best selling ""highly irresponsible"" book. Oh and the Burke playing doctor stuff was originally reported to BPD (according to the Bonita papers) by Patsy Ramsey's mother, who also told them that Burke hit JonBenet in the head with a golf club (the same golf clubs John Ramsey demanded from the house.. in December? Huh. Weird. Almost looks like ""evidence"" of some kind, but like you said there is none) I love how you discounted the books, which suggest Burke was acting out and fit with her frequent doctor visits and reports of him attacking her as ""low even for me"", someone you have never interacted with previously, as far as I know, so its shocking you know the depths of my apparent depravity.    There is evidence against Burke Ramsey. What you're saying is the evidence is circumstantial, and you feel not definitive. I personally can't really say much for Mary Lacy's ""findings"" as her entire team (apart from Kolar) was ""Ramsey approved"", made up of people they'd either hired at one point or had interviewed. That's not corrupt though. Not at all."
UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,therealac,2,Sun Jul 19 09:36:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Furthermore, I have to comment on this from oldspice75:   ""The Grand Jury did not charge the Ramseys with murder because the case against them was never at all definitive. Probably they charged them with child abuse because they nevertheless wanted to charge them with something after all their shady behavior and/or because they thought the treatment of Jon Benet as a pageant girl was exploitative, abusive and led to her endangerment. That is not evidence against Burke at all, and the Grand Jury never made any indication of Burke's guilt.""   In my opinion, the GJ didn't indict the Ramsey's for child abuse or endangerment that had anything to do with the pageants. The pageant aspect has never fleshed out to ANY promising leads whatsoever and in my view has simply showcased the unhealthy dynamics within the family itself more than anything. The GJ indicted the Ramsey's for knowingly endangering the safety and well-being of their child, for putting her in unsafe situations that eventually led to her death.   What sort of situations could this be? Well, there are certainly multiple scenarios but I think we have to think horse vs. zebra here. The GJ had enough evidence to indict the Ramsey's for child endangerment but not enough to indict them for murder...well, if they endangered JonBenet by putting her in an unsafe situation with another adult, wouldn't that adult be mentioned in the indictment?! Wouldn't they be charged themselves?!   But when you think about the totality of the evidence and the way the GJ phrased their indictment, Burke being involved makes a lot of sense. The Ramsey's knew of whatever inappropriate behavior was happening between Burke and JonBenet. Whether the golf club incident was an accident or not, they knew that Burke had hurt JonBenet in the past. They knowingly allowed JonBenet to be placed in danger, and the only person they could have been continually placing her in danger with, that wasn't another adult who would have been indicted themselves, is Burke."
UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,AnnonMiss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:52:33 2015 UTC,In regards to the room in the basement....just because the housekeeper did not know about it means absolutely nothing.  We have a housekeeper but we only have her do the main house.  No housekeeper has ever been in our finished basement.  So the housekeeper not knowing of the room doesn't mean anything.
UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,therealac,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"I actually believe an intruder murdered her. I started out believing Burke did it but after doing research I actually came to the opposite conclusion.   Patsy and John, by all accounts, adored JonBenet and doted on her.  The idea that they found her unconscious, with no obvious head injury and staged a violent murder and sexual assault, then wrote graphic language in a three page ransom note about beheading her is so hard for me to believe.  Had Burke struck her in the head and rendered her unconscious, there's no question in my mind that, based on how they treated JonBenet, they would have simply called 911 and tried to revive her.   Kolar dismisses the DNA profile admitted into CODIS, but his book notes that tests done on freshly opened underwear revealed DNA that was 1/10 of the strength as the profile found in JonBenet's underwear. Not only that, but the DNA profile was found commingled with blood on her panties AND on the waistband of her longjohns. It was found on two different articles of clothing.  The profiles found underneath her nails could be anyone she encountered in the days before her murder. The TDNA found on wrist bindings and garrote could be from accomplices, or anyone who handled the rope in the store or at the intruder's home.

UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,therealac,0,Mon Jul 20 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"I don't believe JonBenet's parents had anything to do with her death either. FBI agent John Douglas, in the last chapter of his The Cases That Haunt Us, made a very convincing case for the intruder theory. If  I remember right, he was initially an adviser to the Ramsey family, so that does make him biased, but how else do we explain the DNA found on her things?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3da1rd,thesevenages,4,Tue Jul 14 23:10:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Kolar asserts that it's from someone in a sweatshop - but I just don't buy it. The DNA in her underwear tested positive for amylase, the enzyme found in saliva, but Kolar dismisses that as a a false positive. It would make sense that someone orally assaulted JBR and the DNA mixed with the blood as it dropped. You have to contort a lot of evidence to make the Burke theory fit. People who believe Patsy wrote the note dismiss any irregularities between the handwriting samples as Patsy ""disguising"" her handwriting, even though the note is consistent throughout. So the note matches her handwriting, but also doesn't match because it's a disguise? That just doesn't make sense to me."

As the Wikipedia article notes, following his acquittal for the first murder, he received a ""hero's welcome"" in his hometown. Shortly thereafter, a second murder was tied to him, and public opinion finally turned against him.  In 1941, after serving about 20 years, Jones was released from prison; he died in 1971. Little is known about his post-prison life. However, several of the Jack the Stripper murders were committed within two blocks of his home.  This is a very well-done documentary about Jones.

This fits with something being put in her mouth. And Darin is the only person we know was outside that night. 4) Motive: Darin was in trouble financially. He had a 250k policy on Darlie. 5) Opportunity: he was home, everyone was asleep downstairs 6) Means: the knife used came from inside the house. 7) Darlie's description of the ""intruder"" black hat, long hair, tall, jeans. That describes Darin, the black hat was found, he was wearing jeans. 8) Darin's extremely odd behavior, noted in his affadavit. He fled across the street when LE showed up. He then went back across the street again after the bodies had been taken out. 30mins after the ambulances left, Darin is still there. What is he doing? 9) It's not Darlie's story about what he was wearing that changed--it's his. He says he came down w/o jeans. Then he changed it to wearing jeans. 10) He flopped a polygraph and I don't believe his story about how he was manipulated into taking it, or how it was ""rigged."" And his story makes it clear he did not take an early polygraph."

I'm not totally convinced either way, but the fact that he admits to some pretty seedy insurance scams already, and was in dire financial straits/feeling the pressure of a growing family, makes it seem at least somewhat possible. He's also maintained Darlie's innocence all along, even though they divorced -- could be loyalty, could be a guilty conscience."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,fondlemeLeroy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:39:34 2015 UTC,"The insurance scam thing is a fraud concocted by the family, I'm pretty sure, to try to make Darlie look innocent. I believe this mostly because I have a hard time believing that an insurance scam they recently talked about (at the time of the murders, that is) was brought up a few years after the original case, and not during the initial investigation. Wouldn't that be the first thing you might mention to investigators if they asked you if you had any idea who might have done this?"

Apparently, it was one of the things they had argued about in their discussion that night, because the Jaguar being out of commission left Darlie home all day with the boys, unable to go out anywhere. I'll also mention that Darlie and Darin initially denied they'd had an argument earlier on the night of the murders, but then later changed their mind about that as well.  I don't think Darin stabbed the kids, but I definitely think he knows who did at the very least, if not helped stage the crime scene. He definitely has some involvement (or at the bare minimum, knowledge of what happened) in my opinion."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,SeekerReigen,21,Tue Jul 14 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"This one is hard for me. I don't think she caused her own injuries- I do believe it was either the husband or an intruder (possibly hired by the dad).....   As a nurse, I highly doubt that neck wound would have been placed there as a decoy- that was meant to kill her plain and simple. By some miracle it was 1-2 mm too shallow.   You just don't cut there if you are trying to fake injuries and not kill yourself. That is what makes me think this wasn't her own hand.....   As far as involvement, I don't know... haven't read enough about it... I totally suspect the dad though just based on his history.   Losing a child is traumatic. Losing one to a senseless act is even more so. I don't think the graveside activities proves anything. I think she was traumatized and possibly on the verge of a mental breakdown.   One ER case that still blows my mind and makes me very cognizant of the fragility and capability of the human brain..... An older man comes in via ambulance middle of the night from his home. Full code- heart attack..... We tried and tried but he didn't make it. His wife (who I think called 911). Went into absolute shock at this- her husband was the love of her life. We tried to tell her he passed- she went in and viewed him. INSISTED it was NOT her husband (it was). She was calm as can be. Grown children were there by that point and it was most certainly her husband and he was very recognizable, not like some traumas- he just looked sleeping. For over two hours she insisted it wasn't her husband, and actually left with family like that. THAT was confusing and mind blowing to us nurses and docs.   Your mind is a powerful thing. It can shut down to protect you, it can totally deceive you... It can make you remember things and details in slow progression. What I mean is the details of the events can be blocked and slowly return, or get mixed up, etc. Honestly if you ask me with cases like this especially involving children- there really should be a way to somehow keep the family (possible suspects) away from the investigation for a couple days before they even begin to question them. I know this will never happen but take this with a grain of salt....   Based on what I read there does seem to be that reasonable doubt...."

It never should have been used as trial evidence.   with cases like this especially involving children- there really should be a way to somehow keep the family (possible suspects) away from the investigation for a couple days before they even begin to question them.   This would've been a useful strategy in so many cases we obsess over here! Someone mentioned JonBenet, which is so true. That crime scene, and the supposed witnesses, were all trampled."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,SeekerReigen,9,Tue Jul 14 15:05:16 2015 UTC,"Totally agree that the graveside activities are nothing - people handle grief in so many different ways, and I don't find it disrespectful. A child's funeral has so little precedent in our lives (most people, luckily, don't have to plan them or get involved with them) who knows how we'd handle it. A couple of adult funerals I've gone to have tried to have a more pleasant feeling, not a full on 'party' atmosphere but some songs that were just favorites of the person when he was alive...even if the songs weren't really funeral appropriate. Just like ""Gangsta's Paradise"".  One thing I think about her injury - to me, I don't rule out that she had initially planned to kill herself alongside the kids. Either she psyched herself out in the middle of it (therefore the mere millimeters away from death...) or she just plain and simple was unable to finish herself off. Frequently parents kill themselves alongside their kids. First example I can think of is Josh Powell, but there is always more.  It's hard to say - because what would be either parents' motivation to kill their children? Was there a history of mental illness, drug abuse, anything like that, for either of the Routiers? I think I recall that they both had rather minor legal troubles before this. Wikipedia says she may have been motivated by money - as in, the kids were costing her a 'lavish' lifestyle. That sounds pretty ridiculous to me - can't say I've heard of that 'motivation' before in an infanticide.   Could it have been a stranger? Certainly possible...but again, the motive just isn't there for me. Fact is, when a kid dies we usually look to the parents first - and that's for a reason...So yeah, I'm suspicious, but I hardly think there was enough evidence to convict from what I've read."

Josh Powell is a good example. There have been a few others in the news the past few years, but I can't remember the names.  There are some references to motivation throughout this thread. Pretty much what you said, plus just being overwhelmed by 3 small children. Rowlett is not exactly Highland Park, but there are some nicer neighborhoods and I think a lot of the people in them are more ""aspirational,"" as opposed to family money. It's also just across the lake from Rockwall, the wealthiest county in Texas (also the smallest), so there's the added influence of feeling the need to keep up with things like boats, tennis, golf, SUVs, etc., moreso than if they lived in Richardson or Allen.   If it was a stranger, he/they were extremely lucky, since they apparently left no solid evidence of their presence.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,hamdinger125,5,Wed Jul 15 12:48:50 2015 UTC,"I always wondered that too, because infants are more work and they would've had less time to bond with them."

She would have been way too dangerous to him if she were still living, and once you've brutally murdered your own kids, why stop at your wife?  Also, again, why spare the little baby?

Then perhaps when she slashed her neck, she figured if she died, that was fine, but if she lived, that was even better. Only Darlie knows what happened that night...and possibly Darin, because he failed his lie detector test, probably because he either suspected Darlie had done it, or he had a part in staging the crime scene. Darlie's lie detector results were never revealed, presumably because she failed it as well. If she had passed, her family and supporters would have spread the news to the four corners of the world by now.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,Mrs_Fonebone,3,Mon Jul 20 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"I don't recall but I'm pretty sure even if there were policies, they probably couldn't collect on them because of the investigation."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,Mrs_Fonebone,7,Mon Jul 20 03:10:51 2015 UTC,"This is going to be long, but bear with me. The details are necessary.  I believe Darlie is guilty, for several reasons that don't add up to her innocence to me:   She did not attempt to aid her sons as they were dying. While it was observed by the first officer on the scene that Darin Routier was attempting CPR on Devon (where it is detailed that he would blow air into the little boy's mouth and blood would seep out of his chest), Darlie was never observed to have been assisting her children. Even when the officer asked her to put a towel on Damon, she remained on the phone, with a rag put to her own neck. As a father, I would not care if my throat had been cut or not, I would be on the ground with my son, applying pressure to the wound and doing everything I could to save him...or at least trying to comfort him in his last moments. There have been numerous lies where Darlie claims she HAD been doing so, and even wetting the towels. Investigators found no evidence of this whatsoever, and they tested many towels in the home. In fact, this case has had more DNA testing done on it than most murder cases. She wrote a letter in prison claiming she ""knew who did this"". When that was brought up in court, she dissolved in tears. She then later conveniently claimed she had amnesia. Her story has changed so often that I find it hard to believe she's innocent. In her first statement, she had fought the intruder, but when there was too little evidence to suggest she seriously struggled with someone, she then claimed that where she had said ""I was fightin'"" on the 911 call to be ""I was frightenin'"". She claims she slept downstairs because Drake (the infant) rustling in his crib woke her at night. Yet, she did not wake up when a man broke into her home and brutally stabbed her two children, who lay right near her. She also claims she woke to Damon crying ""Mommy, Mommy"" for her, but didn't wake up when he was attacked?    Evidence on the bodies of the boys suggests they struggled with their attacker, so it's not like he came in and silently stabbed both of them. Even though Devon died pretty quickly after being injured due to how devastating his wounds were, the autopsy shows he sustained a stab wound of the ""posterior left thigh"". The only way this is possible, considering he pretty much died in the spot he had fallen asleep in, while being stabbed in the chest, is that the boy had his legs up, presumably to try to kick off his killer.   Yet somehow, Darlie (who is a light enough sleeper where a baby's rustlings woke her up) did not hear this man brutally butchering her two sons, who lay so close to her. Devon lay within arm's reach of her and clearly had injuries on his thighs despite being stabbed in the chest to show he struggled with his attacker, yet she did not hear him and did not wake until after he had been attacked.   She claimed that Damon cried ""Mommy"" (which woke her) and even walked with her to the kitchen. This is a five year old boy that was stabbed four times in the back, with those stab wounds perforating his right lung and liver. When the first officer on the scene arrived, Damon could barely breathe, only gurgle.  This kid wasn't walking around or saying anything. In fact, from the way the scene looks, the boy had managed to drag himself across the room and the prosecutor believes based on his position that he was trying to reach the stairs, to get to his father. Yes, he dragged himself, not walked. I don't think I know any five year old child that can walk around after being stabbed once in the back, much less four times.    I really don't believe Darlie. Knowing what I know and how she comes off to me now in interviews, I feel distinctly like she's trying to deceive me."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,Mrs_Fonebone,5,Thu Jul 16 10:37:08 2015 UTC,"I feel this is how the Jon Benet Ramsey case would have gone if the parents were not so wealthy (one parent in jail, and speculation regarding the motives of the other).   My personal opinion is that Darlie is either guilty or has some sort of mental issue that causes her to protect the guilty party even though she is more an accessory and not directly responsible. However I am open minded and could be swayed.   I think the ""silly string"" incident probably garners a lot of sympathy for her from people who have been through the grieving process and recognize how differently each individual grieves. I do not feel this exonerates her and I cannot say what true impact this may have held on the jury during her trail obviously.  It would be worth a re-trail without the silly string coming into play and more of the physical evidence, though that said I feel the physical evidence makes her look quite bad and may be the real reason why a new trail doesn't occur (for those who think she is guilty, combined with new science, it will only make her seem guiltier; for those who think she is innocent no science based on current evidence will change their mind)."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,Pris257,9,Tue Jul 14 01:15:14 2015 UTC,"I do not feel this exonerates her    I don't think anyone would argue it does. Personally, I believe it's a huge red herring.    or has some sort of mental issue that causes her to protect the guilty party even though she is more an accessory and not directly responsible   That could explain why she swore up and down Darin wasn't involved.    However I am open minded and could be swayed.   Same here. I truly do not know what happened to that family! I want to believe she's innocent, but I'm far from convinced."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,biggrizzlydealz,4,Tue Jul 14 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"Actually, most of the arguments I have read indicate that the silly string is what convicted her, because it was such a bizarre thing to do at a gravesite.  Like having a party when your kids are dead.  I think she is guilty, but I don't think she should have been convicted just because of the video."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,missxfebruary,5,Tue Jul 14 04:15:49 2015 UTC,"To me, the graveside party just doesn't seem all that odd.  Thankfully I've never lost a child, but when I lost a close friend my first instinct was to literally cry until I threw up and then refuse to leave the house indefinitely because his loss deserved to be mourned.  After only a couple of days I realized it was insulting to his memory to focus only on the sadness because that's the opposite of what he would have wanted.  I feel like a lot of people try to force themselves to celebrate someone's life rather than wallow in their loss.  It's easier said than done though, obviously."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,wanttoplayball,4,Tue Jul 14 19:20:39 2015 UTC,I remember this well. No reasonable doubt in my mind.  The trouble with that kind of sociopath/narcissist is that they have no idea what a genuine emotion is and they fake them; and they come across as inappropriate in word and deed and don't realize that normal people are cringing in horror and disbelief. Leave it to CNN to focus on this case when there are so many others where genuine questions exist.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,angeliswastaken,17,Mon Jul 13 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think the graveyard behavior comes close to counting as sociopathy.  Stevie Branch's mother did almost the same thing at his gravesite and she's not a sociopath and one of the few people we know didn't commit the WM3 murders. I've seen entire families have picnics on gravesites on important days, including plenty of beer and piñatas, and all that showed was that those people had a decided lack of Protestant grimness where death is concerned."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,angeliswastaken,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:30:14 2015 UTC,Was it Stevie's mom that squealed with excitement that she was going to be on tv?  That was the first thing I thought of when I read about the silly string party.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,hamdinger125,5,Tue Jul 14 09:50:34 2015 UTC,"I don't recall the squealing with joy part but it wouldn't surprise me.  She wasn't a bad person but she was pretty rough around the edges and was... well, completely blitzed when she held that cemetery party.  And I don't judge - if your kid gets brutally murdered you can have all the Xanax you need to function, but it sure can make a grieving mother seem more like a crazy opportunist.  :("
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,oddthingsconsidered,2,Tue Jul 14 21:17:29 2015 UTC,"The Pam Hobbs interview was extremely awkward.  I just watched it again. Right before they start the I terview she says something like ""oh my god, I'm going to be on tv.""  And she is smiling and laughing.  As soon as they start the interview, she gets very somber.    For Pam, it was probably more of a nervous reaction than anything.  Not my place to judge a grieving parent.  I would die if anything like that happened to one of my kids.  I would hate for anyone to judge anything I did for the next month or so because you would basically just be looking at a fucking crazy person."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,angeliswastaken,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:01:23 2015 UTC,Apples and oranges. And a jury of her peers found otherwise.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,angeliswastaken,4,Thu Jul 16 02:32:55 2015 UTC,"It's a great system we have in the USA but it isn't infallible.  The recently deceased Joyce Ann Brown would have a lot to say about juries of one's peers in Texas. It's estimated that nationwide 4% of people on death row are innocent and Texas has executed people who were actually or likely innocent - Carlos de Luna, John Garrett, and Cameron Willingham, just off the top of my head. Worse, since 1994 there have been at least 49 actual innocence exonerations in Texas alone. Perhaps the defense ran acted in a way a jury found inexplicable and nefarious motives were attached to that behavior.  Worth considering.  I suspect that the vast majority of people in prison were rightfully convicted but the reliance on a jury's final authority really doesn't help prove anything one way or the other about this case.  And let's see - two blonde women, with countrified origins, from the American South, close to the same age, with slaughtered children, behaving in an exuberant manner at their child(ren)'s graves.  Not so much comparing apples and oranges as comparing medium red delicious and large red delicious.  Apply sociopathy to one based on a very specific behavior, and you need a pretty convicting argument to prove why it isn't applied to the other."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,Alexandur,4,Thu Jul 16 05:28:50 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the blood spatter analyst has been involved in several wrongful conviction cases. Blood spatter as a whole is junk science, but Tom Bevel specifically has testified in several trials that ended in conviction who were later discovered to be innocent. There was a lot of evidence that should've been left out at the trial. I have no idea if she did it or not, but there certainly isn't proof beyond a reasonable doubt when you exclude the garbage that should never have been presented to a jury."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,angeliswastaken,7,Thu Jul 16 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"I know I've said it here before, but you can't judge someone by their actions after having lost a child. I used to work as a hospice volunteer, and have seen many people going through the grieving process. There is nothing like the grief of a parent after having lost a child. I have seen many behaviors that most people would think insane. They really do act in bizarre ways sometimes. But that's the thing, they all do it. So, it's actually pretty normal for a parent who has lost a child to act in seemingly bizarre and insane ways. Coping with pain like that is just unimaginable, and you can't really draw conclusions from what they do/don't do while they are experiencing it. I'm not at all saying Darlie is innocent, as I am on the fence. All I am saying is that you can't use this to decide her guilt or innocence."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,alane999,-3,Tue Jul 14 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"And the odds say that a certain % of those parents are, per national statistics NOT normal themselves; they're a cross section of people. I know about pediatric hospice too and there are some people who are just so ""upset"" they never even come to see the dying child. Guess what: some of them are unbalanced/sociopaths. They don't feel it."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d6nn1,alane999,3,Thu Jul 16 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, I'm not denying that. Like I said, a lot of people use the graveside thing to try to 'convict' her, and I don't think it proves her guilt. I have seen far stranger behavior than silly string on the birthday of a dead child."

He was such a beautiful person; I find it so hard to believe that someone could not recognize him. I'm sure in life he was stunning and he has a face that would be so hard to forget.  The fact that no one has claimed him or identified him (at the very least) implies that he either had no one and was alone in this world, or that he had no one who cared about him so he may as well have been alone. Either one is a sad reality."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,lilmonstertruck,11,Mon Jul 13 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"I said this on a thread about Lyle Stevik in this sub months ago and basically got shot down.  Amanda Park is on a reservation, and while it is my understanding that this particular tribe has very low membership and would notice if one of their members were missing, it is possible that he travelled there from another reservation looking for his ""roots.""    Also, I've actually been to Amanda Park...it's a VERY VERY small place, not a place you go to unless it is intentional, IMO."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,Wuornos,10,Tue Jul 14 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"I live in WA and had never even heard of Amanda Park until this, knowing it's on a Rez makes me like 99% he's Native.   My thing is, I was showing my boyfriend the NSFW photos and he mentioned that the baggy clothes reminded him of someone who had just been released from jail because if you go to jail improperly clothed they give you what they have on hand when you're released.   But since he's not in the system it makes me wonder if it wasn't a mental health situation, like he tried to commit suicide and was brought through the ER instead of the jail and was eventually placed in a facility, which upon release gave him proper clothing.   It's just a shot in the dark but I wonder if Amanda Park was like his ancestral home and he went there to kill himself."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,lilmonstertruck,6,Tue Jul 14 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"I actually was saying something about him possibly being institutionalized or in prison, but you're right, his fingerprints would be in the system if he had just left prison.  I only know where Amanda Park is because when I was in high school a friend's family moved there so her dad could take an extended substitute teaching job.  There is literally NOTHING there, just a small town and a reservation (I remember a phone conversation not long after she moved there where she was telling me ""literally every teenager is pregnant or already has a kid"").  That's what makes me think this guy had to be Native, but not necessarily directly associated with the local tribe.  Your line of thinking is similar to mine, though, in that this place had to be significant to him somehow...maybe he knew his heritage had originated there."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,Wuornos,5,Tue Jul 14 22:15:05 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm more inclined to believe he would have been institutionalized. I spent 4 days in a mental health facility in my late teens and they certainly didn't DNA swab or fingerprint me. While I was in there 2 people were admitted with improper clothing, from what I gather they both arrived in only their underwear, and they had to wear paper gowns. I was released before they were (into the care of my family so I had my own clothing upon release) so I don't know how they were dressed when they were released, but I can't imagine the hospital letting them stroll out in a paper gown, ya know?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,lilmonstertruck,7,Tue Jul 14 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"I think there's some weight to your theory about him entering through the ER, possible on a mental illness hold.  That would explain the general lack of personal effects and the poorly fitted clothing.  It is possible that he didn't really have significant weight loss, it's just that he was wearing someone else's hand-me-downs."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,Wuornos,3,Tue Jul 14 22:44:17 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much how it went down for me. The police were there when the ambulance came, but I went directly to the ER where they did their business and told me I could commit myself or they would commit me. There was no jail involved even though I was admittedly being completely out of control. I also wonder if they've checked with like halfway houses or whatever in the general area (WA, ID, OR, BC, etc) to see if anyone went missing from them around this time. It stands to reason that if it was a mental health situation and he had no family or whatever to be released to that he would've been found placement in a group home or something."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,lilmonstertruck,10,Tue Jul 14 22:23:45 2015 UTC,they ceratainly do have an accent.  Some communities are also more mixed (race?) than others so he could have had white blood that muted the native traits some which might have set his description off a bit.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,lilmonstertruck,7,Mon Jul 13 23:05:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a weird dialect thing.  I can definitely see confusing it for a Canadian accent.  I have family on the Reservation in Cherokee, NC, and for the most part, everyone around there has a strong Southern accent typical of that area.  But there's a distinctly Native American lilt to it, even among the younger people who only learned Tsalagi later in life.  It seems like it's fairly similar between different tribes and regions."

That's always made me wonder if he had arranged to be picked up by someone at the motel (which would explain why he arrived without a car and why he traveled so light -- he didn't expect to be there long) and then that person never showed, driving him to despair and suicide. The other thing that makes me think he was expecting someone is that he was originally placed in Room 8, which is the farthest room from the road.  He was insistent about being moved and ended up in Room 5, which from the view in Google Maps of the motel appears to have a much more unobstructed view of the highway.  He didn't specifically ask for a better view, but any room other than 8 would have given him a better vantage point to watch the passing traffic."

When Lyle Stevik was first mentioned in the sub a few weeks ago, it caused a lot of drama within the community because the opinions were so split. Lots of people said they would have loved to work on it. There were more positive responses than negative, if I recall. I'm sure they'd love to help in the future!"
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,SnittingNexttoBorpo,8,Mon Jul 13 20:04:05 2015 UTC,I always thought it was strange that they settled on AJD when there are so many UIDs who didn't specifically ask to remain that way.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,suzyclueless,3,Mon Jul 13 20:09:43 2015 UTC,"I mainly lurk over there, I have only posted once or twice, so I'm not exactly sure how they go about choosing cases before presenting them to the sub for discussion. I found it a little strange as well, considering the bit of drama after the first time Lyle was mentioned. But, cases like AJD and Lyle Stevik also force us to step back and examine our morals and discuss ethics, which I think can be beneficial overall. Plus, it's possible these people that wanted to remain unknown have families that are still looking for them and need closure, which of course, is also an important factor in all of this. Heavy stuff, but the majority of gratefuldoe were very civil and respectful when discussing it since they know cases like this shouldn't be taken lightly."

When choosing a case, we basically ask for input from the community regarding what cases they are interested in and then try to pick one that we feel is comparatively solvable and would spark the interest of the community.    We were reluctant to do AJD due to the concerns people have raised but she was by far the one that was requested the most.   As you mentioned, the issue of focusing on Does who try to hide their identities is very divisive. However, we feel that both stances have their merits so we try to reach a balance."

I've seen so many comments from women/maybe some men about how handsome he was, they wonder how could no one miss him, one person said she wanted to run her fingers through his luscious hair. I can't really put my finger on it but it kind of creeps me out. These admirers don't imply it's more sad because he was handsome looking, it's just something else. But maybe it's a good thing too, just different. This case reminds me a lot of the short story ""The Handsomest Drowned Man in the World"" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Lyle Stevik does stick in my mind because he was so handsome, but not because of his attractiveness per se; it's more the fact that he was young, very good-looking, and (according to the autopsy) other than the weight loss he was in perfect health.  Even his teeth were perfect.  He had so much of what so many people wish for -- youth, looks, good health and strength -- but none of it seemed to make life worth living to him.  The situation reminds me a little bit of the poem ""Richard Cory"" by Edward Arlington Robinson."

It actually drives me nuts with missing/deceased cases, when people say ""she was so beautiful"" or ""this beautiful child is missing!"" That doesn't matter! Sometimes people will say ""well every child is beautiful."" Okay, then it's redundant to mention. That would be like saying ""missing human child Madeleine McCann."" Not necessary!"

I also noticed ""Lyle Stevic"" was a handsome man. If someone is particularly beautiful or handsome, people will often remark upon it, I guess just because it's out of the ordinary - in the same way you'd notice and remark upon weather that's out of the ordinary."

When you see someone who went to a hotel with a false name and was in enough pain that they decided to kill themselves and no one ever claimed them or gave them a name... Eh. That kind of makes you feel a certain empathy. You want to hug them, or pat their head, or hold their hand and tell them it's not so bad. But it's too late.   I think that the ""luscious"" comment is super inappropriate though. I just see a person who is, in their own way, at peace.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,TheBestVirginia,5,Thu Jul 16 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"I did some digging around Charley Project (as I'm sure countless others have done) and found some entries that may be of interest.    None of these really stands out to me as a strong possibility, but there is enough resemblance to warrant at least brief consideration.  Note: I allowed some leniency on height (from 5'10"" to 6'4""); on age (usually +- 5 years or so); and on suggested ancestry.  I also considered a few different eye colors since hazel eyes are notorious for looking different colors.  I paid most attention to the ear lobes (it seems LS has smaller ears and attached lobes, which is genetic) and tattoos (dismissed any MPs with tattoos).  I also tried to bear in mind that people look different when they smile vs. not smile.  LS is shown not smiling.  I think noses especially look wider when we smile, it stretches our nostrils out and can change the appearance of the tip.    One other note is that none of these MPs are listed as having had an appendectomy; however, exclusion of this doesn't mean that the person didn't actually have one.  Especially if they were reported missing by an employer, landlord, recent friend, etc. as any of those individuals may not know about the surgery or hadn't seen him without a shirt.  Links:  This man had surgical scars not noted on LS  This one is listed at 6'4"" so maybe too tall  This one surprisingly doesn't have a true photo, just a composite  This one I do think has a decent resemblance, seems well-read, and has a history of mental illness  This one is an insulin-dependent diabetic, though since the death was not diabetes-related, perhaps the ME wasn't aware  This one isn't the strongest resemblance IMO, but the accent might be explained and he has a history of depression  This man has very little info and is a bit shorter but the ears look similar and I think he has a cleft chin  This man is the shortest one I included and is unlikely, but he had lived in Canada, was Alaskan, and may have some Native ancestry  This one has little info and one photo, not likely but hairlines are similar  This man has some resemblance though I suspect he did meet foul play in FL  This one most likely died in an accident, but maybe not, his brow line is a good match  This one I looked at for quite awhile because I didn't see a resemblance, but I tried to imagine a different hair cut and no glasses, also he seems to have a mole on his face in the same spot  This one bears the least resemblance, I guess his eyes look similar to me, maybe if he lost a lot of weight it's possible but I doubt it  This man has very little info and blue eyes, but I thought he was worth mentioning  This man doesn't appear to be a good match either by looks, but I tried to see him clean shaven and with a photo not taken at the angle it is which might change the nose appearance  This young man went missing years before, but he is an Irish national which might explain the accent, I tried to picture him more gaunt and without the ""baby face""  And lastly, this man would be over the age by several years and went missing well before LS was found, but there is a resemblance"
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,TheBestVirginia,3,Fri Jul 17 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for linking this, I wasn't sure how.  The more I look at these, there are a few that I at first thought ""no way"" but now am taking a closer look at.  Like Cory Weiss.  at first glance, the photo really doesn't look like Lyle.  But when I try to make mental adjustments to the hair, remove the smile, darken the hair a bit, take the glasses off, and take off some weight, then I see where it could be a possibility.  Except he wasn't quite tall enough.  I think that we have to consider these ""changes"" in trying to solve this one.  If there were an MP with a publicly available profile who matched Lyle in every single way, this would have been solved.  Countless people have pored over this case, professionals and armchair investigators alike.  We really need to be pretty open about some of the aspects of his appearance and mannerisms."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,YesHunty,4,Tue Jul 14 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"I could kind of see a resemblance.

He stood up a friend at a concert on August 7, 1988 and he hasn't been heard from since. His belongings were left in his Vancouver apartment, where a sad poem addressed to ""loved ones"" was found lying in his room.""  That stuck out to me. ""Lyle"" chose his name based on Joyce Carol Oates, so it doesn't seem farfetched that a poem would be left in Canada.  Edit: Lyles ears don't look pierced, so I think that rules this fellow out."

I wonder if it is some clever riddle.  It is said he had no signs of being outdoors or any physical labor.  So perhaps he was a very cerebral type.  Possibly even a genius who worked in some type of science or research.  Maybe he had high functioning autism and was incredibly intelligent but lacked social skills so he never really made friends.    I wonder if he lived alone with a parent in the middle of nowhere and the parent passed away.  Maybe the parent was also a bit of a recluse.  I also wonder if he was from another country and his speech was affected because he was trying to do his best American accent to not be detected as foreign.  He sounded strange enough that the woman noticed he was not local.   Another crazy angle would be that he broke into a home of a larger man and stole some clothes which would explain the larger sizing.  Maybe he was in a hurry to hide.  Maybe he killed someone and his clothes were bloody.  Maybe he killed the person whose close he stole.  Maybe he was running from he law after he murdered a lover.

To a depressed person, the idea of being someone else - even just a little, just for a little bit - might be appealing. So he checks in under a fake name, but then he realizes he's always himself, fake name or not, and ends up killing himself. Or maybe he was up to no good, using a fake name for that end, and then something happened that led to him killing himself. Obviously I have no idea what his thought process was, but I don't think it's clear that he wanted to never be identified."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,gfjq23,5,Tue Jul 14 11:55:36 2015 UTC,"Ah. It could be, but personally I think Lyle was Native American. I live in an area that has many natives and that nose/forehead slope in the profile is distinguishing. Unfortunately if he is native or from a reservation they might never find him. They usually don't report missing persons outside the BIA and that is assuming the family is even interested in finding him.  It would also make sense as far as some of the things he did regarding the suicide. In some tribes suicide is not taboo at all. In fact, if you are too far ""from normal"" or greatly disappoint your family it was encouraged. The person would leave the tribe to ""go hunting"" and never came back. The person was meant to quietly reflect on their actions (would explain wanting a quieter room) and leave this world with as little inconvenience to others as possible (the money, covering the window so others didn't see, and the pillows to not disturb his neighbors). If he did something to cause shame from his family they wouldn't be looking for him.  Sorry I don't have a cite for that. I was told about ritual suicide in Native American culture from my husband whose father was an archaeologist and anthropologist and worked with our local tribes until his death."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4hz2,Wuornos,6,Tue Jul 14 12:19:44 2015 UTC,"This.  Native American's that have lived their entire lives on reservations not only have an ""accent"" their families tend to be extremely distrustful of non-tribal law enforcement.  If he was reported to tribal police, it is possible that report never made it off the reservation.  I am also convinced that he is Native American.  Since Amanda Park is such a remote place, I have a theory that this man was traveling to the area to seek out his past.  Perhaps he was raised by relatives somewhere else (which could explain the deep depression that lead to suicide...the not knowing ""who he is"") and went to Amanda Park to try and connect with what little of his background he knew."

In in the case of Calkins himself, he's known to have materially lied and to have changed it's story.  Isn't it funny?  Nothing much you can do about it though.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4tnr,autowikibot,28,Mon Jul 13 20:52:53 2015 UTC,"This entry on the Doe Network has always bothered me, mainly because of the cause of death (I have no idea, but I cannot imagine that it was a quick and painless end, and picturing someone actually doing this to her makes me ill) and the investigators' belief that she was likely the victim of yet-unidentified serial murderer.  Plus, Wyoming only has a few Does period so it must bother them to not have this one solved.  From the entry:  ""The cause of death was listed as an ice pick or similar object inserted in the victim's left nostril, penetrating her sphenoid bone. Examiners also found signs of strangulation, beating trauma to the face and jaw, as well as anal and vaginal sexual assault.  The sophistication of the killing points to the possible involvement of a serial offender. Detectives have determined the killer's blood is type O.""  Edited to add that one of the few other unidentified Jane Does in WY had suspect DNA that matches what was found with the first victim.  So a serial was horribly murdering and dumping the bodies of young women in WY (and possibly elsewhere) and has yet to be identified.  Scary.

But the person on the floor turned out to be Reber's 14-year-old daughter Peggy. The girl had been beaten and viciously bitten on her upper body. She'd been strangled with either an electrical cord or a scarf (depending on whom you asked afterward), sodomized with a mop handle or a jar (again, depending), and sexually assaulted with an archer's bow, the pointy tip of which came to protrude from her upper chest.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4tnr,greatgildersleeve,2,Tue Jul 14 09:52:18 2015 UTC,That's not necessarily true. Search teams often use this method for finding remains in the forest. The hole only has to be an inch of two in diameter.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4tnr,cbblue,3,Mon Jul 13 23:15:09 2015 UTC,"Well I think that if you control one person and threaten their well being or life the other people are more likely to be compliant and do as you say out of fear for that person. Then once you have all three people being compliant & quiet it's really just a matter of murder, cleanup, and disposal of the remains. It would be so much harder to leave such a pristinely fucked up situation if you had people yelling, fighting, scratching, kicking, and just all around working against you. But if you control them with fear I think that's most of the battle, imo."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4tnr,autowikibot,3,Tue Jul 14 09:54:01 2015 UTC,"That's the part that gets me though, because controlling with fear makes sense in family abductions...but one of the girls was just a friend. Maybe I'm just a bad friend, but if someone held a gun to my friend's mother's head, I'd still be running for the door.  Then again, people do just freeze up all the time in abduction scenarios. We have this idea in our head of what we'd do, but in reality, we don't know. Well, most of us don't.  This one sticks to me too, it's so strange. I think it's definitely someone who was already in the house when the girl's arrived, or was watching them come in. I think the original target was the mother, but when the other two came along, he took the opportunity. All this can also be quite well explained by there being more than one abductor...A two-person team like the Speed Freak Killers, for example."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d4tnr,JWsWrestlingMem,5,Tue Jul 14 12:45:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, I like to think that if I was in that situation I'd be like ""Dippity doo, bye!"" and be out the door, but then at the same time... Who knows? Maybe I'd freeze. Maybe I'd pass out. Maybe I'd choke up and be paralyzed and unable to do anything at all. I think until we find ourselves in this situation we don't know we'll react. And let's be real -- no one wants to test this theory for themselves.  I think that you're probably right in that whoever did this wanted just the mother and the girls were an afterthought/loose end that needed to be tied up. I never considered it being a two person team, though. I find that often in cases with multiple parties one person gets sloppy and leaves evidence OR one of them can't keep their mouth shut and they get busted that way. But it's interesting to ponder over!"

Essentially someone got away with the perfect crime, and I'd bet the farm that it will remain unsolved forever.  http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/t/tengelsen_carlene.html"

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4tnr,autowikibot,10,Wed Jul 15 16:10:33 2015 UTC,"The strange disappearance of the boy from Somosierra, Spain. I wish I could find a link with a decent translation but they all pretty much suck. It happened during the mid 80s, a truck driver in the town of Somosierra, Spain; promised his 10 year old son that he would take him on one of his trips with him if he did well in school. The boy did and the dad kept his promise, taking the mom and the son with him on a long trip in which he would be transporting a huge tank carrying 20,000 liters of sulphuric acid. They made several stops during their route, and everyone remembers seeing the boy with his parents. Something that no one has been able to explain happened at the end of the journey, because the dad, who was an experienced truck driver with a spotless record, began driving erratically and at a very high speed in a stretch of the road full of dangerous curves. The truck did not make it, it crashed and overturned spilling the 20,000 liters of sulphuric acid all over the road and contaminating a nearby river. The parents died instantly, their bodies were completely charred.  A massive containment operation began. When the authorities called the family to notify them of the death of their relatives, the family asked for the boy, but he was nowhere to be found. There was no trace of him at the accident site--according to some sources his shoes were found but this has never been confirmed. The police retraced the truck's route and spoke to several witnesses who assured them there had been a boy in that truck but he was never found. Many thought that the sulphuric acid had dissolved the body but the Spanish forensic authorities conducted several experiments that proved this was scientifically impossible.   Witnesses later reported that they had seen a white van with a ""tall and pale"" man and a woman around the accident site and they were carrying a lump.  The boy from Somosierra was never seen again."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d4tnr,lesterquinn,8,Tue Jul 14 03:25:49 2015 UTC,"Section 5. Little Miss 1565 of article  Hartford circus fire:       The best-known victim of the circus fire was a young blonde girl wearing a white dress. She is known only as ""Little Miss 1565"", named after the number assigned to her body at the city's makeshift morgue. Oddly well preserved even after her death, her face has become arguably the most familiar image of the fire.  Her true identity has been a topic of debate and frustration in the Hartford area since the fire occurred. She was buried without a name in Hartford's Northwood cemetery, where a victims' memorial also stands. Two police investigators, Sgts. Thomas Barber and Edward Lowe, photographed her and took fingerprints, footprints, and dental charts. Despite massive publicity and repeated displays of the famous photograph in nationwide magazines, she was never claimed. Barber and Lowe spent the rest of their lives trying to identify her. They decorated her grave with flowers each Christmas, Memorial Day, and July 6.  After their deaths, a local flower company continued to decorate the grave.  In 1991, the body was declared to be that of Eleanor Emily Cook, despite the fact that her aunt and uncle had examined the body and it did not fit the description they provided. The Connecticut State Police forensics unit compared hair samples and determined they were probably from the same person. The body was exhumed in 1991 and buried next to her brother, Edward, who had also died in the fire.   In 1981, Lowe's widow announced that Lowe had identified the child and contacted her family, but they had requested no publicity.  In 1987, someone left a note on 1565's gravestone reading Sarah Graham is her Name! 7-6-38 DOB, 6 years, Twin. Notes on nearby gravestones indicated that her twin brother and other relatives were buried close by.

When people say there is a group of ""powerful and high profile"" murderers and they can recount specific details about the children or the people or the place that these instances occurred... you would think that they'd be able to say 'Yea, so we were in the dining room and there was blood everywhere."" and they'd be able to find some sort of physical evidence to validate what they are saying.

By the way, while I don't know of any books written about the murders I mentioned in my original post there is a book called Deadly Dose that you can have shipped to you (used) for $4.00.  It's about Ann Miller Knotz who killed her husband, Eric Miller, with arsenic.  In the book the lead investigator in the Miller case was also the lead investigator on the Vinson case so some details of the Vinson case appear here and there.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,eyehorror,10,Mon Jul 13 19:41:29 2015 UTC,The backpack full of rocks is weird but maybe if he himself didn't want his body to be found for whatever reason he could easily have done that himself. And if he killed himself in or near the river the gun could have been swallowed by mud or washed down river in the two months between his disappearance and the discover of his remains.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,The_Rampant_Goat,10,Mon Jul 13 20:47:40 2015 UTC,"I agree... the backpack full of rocks is just... odd. The only way this is plausible is if he shot himself in the water or as he was jumping in. I don't know much about the current of the river he was in, but it seems plausible that the gun could have washed down river, and that's why it wasn't found with his body.   I can't put too much stock in family members saying that the person was not suicidial and had everything to live for. Man, depressed people can hide it and hide it well. It's not something plenty of depressed and/or suicidal people broadcast.   With all that said, I do get a hinky feeling. It's nothing more than a feeling, but I'm not sure this kid killed himself."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,ttho10,4,Mon Jul 13 21:01:52 2015 UTC,"I agree about the family members saying it wasn't suicide. Regardless of the low level crime situation people have been murdered over testifying about shoplifted steaks though so, who knows. I want know more about two things: 1. The bullet wound to the head. What position was it in? Like temple, back of the head etc.   The rocks themselves. Was it a few large rocks, or was it a bunch of smaller rocks? Because no matter what happened, murder or suicide, I don't understand why someone would take the time to gather a bunch of smaller rocks instead of using one or two large rocks."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,lilmonstertruck,2,Mon Jul 13 22:56:00 2015 UTC,agreed... it all seems SO strange.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,ttho10,3,Tue Jul 14 13:21:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm certainly not saying he definitely killed himself, just saying it's possible despite all the weird shit. But I get that feeling too, something isn't right here."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,The_Rampant_Goat,5,Mon Jul 13 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"A kid near where I live committed suicide by jumping into the ocean with a backpack full of rocks. It's not super unusual, I'd say"
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,LizzardFish,4,Tue Jul 14 00:06:56 2015 UTC,"It's not unusual. Some people REALLY want to end their life and come up with very inventive ways to ensure their demise, like they want it to be foolproof. There was a local guy who stood on a chair with a rope around his neck and shot himself in the head, so if the gunshot didn't kill him, the hanging would. No known family members, but neighbors said he was happy, seemed fine, etc. He left no ""typical"" suicide note either. I believe there was a note or something that just said ""Take care of (dog's name)"" on or near the chair. Sadek certainly may have been murdered, and the backpack filled with rocks may have been done to with the body down to keep it from being found, but suicide isn't out of the realm of possibility."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,MoreThanBadKarma,3,Tue Jul 14 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"No, The rocks aren't unusual. It is the shooting himself and the rocks combined that are weird to me."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,gfjq23,4,Tue Jul 14 21:08:49 2015 UTC,The only reason he agreed to be a ci was to hide the fact of his pot use from his parents. I am firmly a supporter of le but feel it is wrong to use kids as a ci. He may have been 20 years old but was horrified of his parents finding out. When le pushed him to produce more information our they were going to refile charges he snapped and I think this is the result. In a way it was murder after so much pressure was put on him. The people involved in him becoming a ci should never work in le again. Just my 2 cents.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,stltoday2,3,Sat Jul 18 14:45:21 2015 UTC,"Do people who smoke pot kill themselves as often as people who don't? I assume there are too many variables to really know but doesn't it typically lessens anxiety and symptoms of depression? I can't wait for legitimate research into risks and benefits, because it seems the only risks come from criminalizing something that lots of people do and making kids rat on real criminals."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,vajabjab,2,Tue Jul 14 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of any study linking marijuana use to suicide. The only plausible connection between the two IMO would be if someone already had an underlying condition that was amplified by drug use, such as depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, etc."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,Meow__Bitch,2,Thu Jul 16 15:03:08 2015 UTC,I doubt very much the suicide angle. He was offed by someone he was finagled into telling on.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,vajabjab,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:12 2015 UTC,"I agree it's totally fishy. Doesn't sound like a suicide to me, especially due to the rocks. Additionally, as I said in the above comment, I don't think smoking pot would have any thing to do with him wanting to commit suicide for some reason."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,Meow__Bitch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"Smoking pot can aggravate conditions like psychosis, which could explain a slightly odd method of suicide. If delusions were involved, it's a possibility.  I personally think there's more to it than that, but it's an interesting angle to consider."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,misty_donna,2,Sat Jul 18 11:48:45 2015 UTC,Maybe Thomas Bearson should be included. He was also a CI for NDSU b/c he was caught with a little weed on him.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,vajabjab,-6,Mon Jul 20 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"This sounds like another one of the supposed ""Smiley Face Murders"". Anytime you hear about a young male college student going missing in the midwest, they always end up dead in a river... I used to think this was a silly theory, but it just hapoens all the time now. Read up on the Smiley Face killer(s) and tell me this case doesn't fit the profile."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d5vvm,Coolaid213,3,Tue Jul 14 18:31:02 2015 UTC,"Considering the guy was shot in the head and had a backpack full of rocks, that means it doesn't fit the smiley face murders at all.   The thing about the Smiley Face Murders is that the men who die all have no outward signs of violence. All of them have simply drowned. Now whether that is due to some serial killer, like some people believe, or just because drunk young men and water rarely mix is something that can be debated, but the fact that this dude has a gunshot wound to the head (whether self inflicted or not) means he doesn't fit the pattern."

He did show evidence that he'd been trained as an engineer, or had natural affinities in that direction (there's been a couple really good posts in this forum regarding Chandler, with photos of his apartment as police found it...interestingly it was bereft of fingerprints, even when they tried to dust two books sitting on his desk next to the ziploc baggie full of bullets)  Edit I also dunno if it's worth pointing out that he dressed up for the costume party as an ""old-style"" gangster from the pre-1960's era (at least that's what I assume he was dressed as given the hat and loud suit)"

A person on the run from the law in 1989 with HIV? It was hard enough to get the medication you needed then, and AZT was only marginally effective and not even for everyone. I believe the big breakthroughs didn't come til about 96. A fugitive with few known economic resources and an intravenous drug habit probably didn't do much of a good job dealing with that. The chances of him being alive when he was removed in 2000 is very low at best."

I think she was killed in a California hotel, and it seemed like she was a prostitute. I also think it mentioned the presence of track marks on her arm. But it was the description of her clothing that stuck out: multicolored bell bottoms, a minidress, and white boots that seems like the epitome of late 1960s clothing to me.  I think the Doe Network page also stated that he may have been the Crewcut Killer, unless I'm conflating two cases. Actually, here's the link to the killing: http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/333ufca.html I wanted to double check before posting."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d2vck,TheBestVirginia,22,Mon Jul 13 06:30:47 2015 UTC,"Just read the link. Avid outdoorsmen , hunter and fisher... lived in a state that bordered Mexico. I think there's three likely options:   Least likely IMO - He has been living mostly/completely off the grid in a rural area where he can mostly live off the land. Considering he snapped and killed his whole family he may have gone off somewhere and killed himself. It's fairly common in these situations. Though if this is the case it's surprising a body hasn't been found at this point. Most likely IMO, he jetted across the border to Mexico and disappeared."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d2vck,Dcowboys09,6,Mon Jul 13 08:57:48 2015 UTC,I've wondered about the suicide theory.  I would think it comes down to a formal FBI profile.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d2vck,RealFruitSnacks,7,Mon Jul 13 05:24:40 2015 UTC,Do you have any theories? maybe they turned rats and went into witness protection?
UnresolvedMysteries,3d2vck,Yanns,27,Mon Jul 13 02:31:45 2015 UTC,"For some of the older ones, I think it was a lot easier to assume a new identity back then. So that could be a possibility.    It is also likely that some of them died shortly after making the list and were never discovered."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d2vck,theinfinitejess,8,Mon Jul 13 02:45:06 2015 UTC,Couldn't they just be making room on the list for someone who is more dangerous and more likely to be found?

UnresolvedMysteries,3d2vck,Bluecat72,2,Mon Jul 13 18:22:00 2015 UTC,Are the ones where the charges were dropped considered to not have committed the crimes?
UnresolvedMysteries,3d2vck,idwthis,11,Mon Jul 13 12:44:25 2015 UTC,"No, not necessarily.    In order for the feds to help search for a local criminal, there must generally be a federal warrant out for their arrest.  Many of the Top Tenners have committed local crimes, and their federal crime is ""Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution""(UFAP) or something similar.  The feds can dismiss UFAP charges without the underlying charges being dismissed.  This would make the person ineligible for Top Ten inclusion, but wouldn't absolve them of the underlying crime."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d3j8y,ManFromMu,11,Mon Jul 13 06:03:07 2015 UTC,Great post!!  What a case!  I can understand the father-in-law being involved in killing the husband. But why do harm to his own daughter and granddaughter?
UnresolvedMysteries,3d3j8y,Cecilia_Tallis,5,Mon Jul 13 14:22:58 2015 UTC,"My first thought was that maybe her father had sexually abused her and was possessive of her (that is common for kids who are molested by a parent, as the abuser prohibits them from having boyfriends, dating, etc...I had two friends growing up in this circumstance) and once she married and had a baby, he realized she was no longer ""his"" so maybe the ""if I can't have you, nobody will"" way of thinking in domestic violence.  Just a thought."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d3j8y,TheBestVirginia,4,Mon Jul 13 21:26:32 2015 UTC,Or that she was afraid the kid was the next target and called out the dad who then killed them so as not to be found out.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d3j8y,tydalt,4,Mon Jul 13 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"Also, it was implied that it was done by some hired hand not by her father. If this guy isn't a professional contract killer but rather just someone willing to kill for money you could see how it could easily go wrong. I'm also not sure if ""professional contract killers"" actually exist like they do in the movies and its possible even a seasoned vet could screw up considering they are someone low enough to kill for money."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d3j8y,Ky_kapow,6,Tue Jul 14 04:24:41 2015 UTC,I had the same question. But I guess it's just as hard to imagine the husband doing it to his wife and daughter right? Somebody was sick enough to do it.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d3j8y,dragthewaters91,15,Mon Jul 13 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"The letter to her daughter sounds like an unfulfilled mother to me. She probably loves her daughter, but having a new baby is so incredibly difficult. Who knows what her home life was like, or if she had any support?  This is what is says to me; they had another long day, but they made it through. The ""squirrel cage fantasy"" could be in reference to the tedium and drudgery that can be a new mother's day, but it's a fantasy because motherhood is glamorized and doesn't often live up.   She feels ""baseless"" because she's without direction, or purpose. Her husband, Edward, says their daughter should be her foundation, her purpose. But it's not enough, even though all she does is for her daughter.   Just my interpretation."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d3j8y,osmanthusoolong,6,Mon Jul 13 12:07:45 2015 UTC,But why use such obtuse prose in a letter? When I first read it it seemed so disjointed that I figured it was either the ramblings of someone in a psychotic episode or some sort of code. But based on your read it could have just been a sort of poem she was writing rather than an actual letter. That would likely make it irrelevant to the murder.
UnresolvedMysteries,3d3j8y,allgoaton,14,Mon Jul 13 14:05:51 2015 UTC,That was the writing style in the 60s if you were trying to sound artistic.

The writing is even a style that I am familiar with, not quite uncommon. So it certainly could be poetry more than an actual letter. But... alone it is strange. Does she have any other writings in some of her personal posessions? Would her family members or friends know she liked writing? If it is poetry, it has such specific language that I doubt it would be in isolation."

UnresolvedMysteries,3d0waa,Pastor__of__Muppets,49,Sun Jul 12 16:56:47 2015 UTC,Reward money wasn't a factor in the Unabomber's brother turning him in. He recognized his brother's crazy rankings in the manifesto published. I'm sure he would have turned him in regardless.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d0waa,ajack652,69,Mon Jul 13 02:55:07 2015 UTC,"I live in Southern California, surrounded by desert. Last year a man left in the morning to ride his ATV in the desert, and at nightfall he still hadn't returned. His wife reported him missing, and a search was underway that lasted all night. The following morning a search and rescue team found his body next to his overturned ATV in the desert miles away from any houses or anything. It was assumed that he wrecked the ATV and hit his head or broke his neck. He was still wearing his helmet.  When the autopsy was performed, it was discovered that he had actually been shot in the head. A search was done at the scene and a shell was found that was determined to be from a long range rifle. Everybody was baffled. This guy was a family man, with a wife and kids. He volunteered as a softball coach, and was reported to be an all around great guy. He had many friends, all who had nothing but great things to say about him. He was known to be a genuinely friendly and caring man. Police had absolutely zero leads. This guy had no known enemies, and where he was found was surrounded by nothing but desert for miles.   A reward was offered for any information on the murder. Months went by, and nobody came forward. The police department decided to raise the reward by several thousand dollars, they figured somebody had to know something.   Finally, somebody came forward claiming they knew who did it. It turns out the man who shot him was a known felon with gang affiliations. He was in the passenger seat of his friends car, and said he wanted to try out his new gun. It had a scope on it. The friend pulled the car over and fired 2 shots, one hitting the ATV rider in the head. The friend who was driving is saying that he did not know that the guy was aiming at anything specific and just thought he let off a couple shots randomly.   When he got home, he told his girlfriend that he killed somebody, and she didn't call the police because they both had outstanding warrants. They were both heavy meth users. I don't know who turned him in, but I am guessing it was the girlfriend who ended up testifying against him in court. I suspect they made a deal that if she testified they wouldn't arrest her for her warrant. He was arrested and charged with the murder. So basically a man who was enjoying life, riding his ATV on his day off, was murdered because a meth head wanted to try out his new gun with a scope. If the murderer had not been out driving that day, that man would still be alive and at home with his family. It was so senseless."

I've been doing research for my dissertation, and the other day I was looking at numerous cases that were solved after tips from civilians came in and they collected rewarded money.

UnresolvedMysteries,3d0waa,Zickefoose,5,Sun Jul 12 23:43:19 2015 UTC,"Since you've done some research...  I was wondering if this has ever backfired.  For example, the police put up a $25,000 reward for tips leading to the arrest and conviction of a unknown murderer.  I would think people would be trying to cash in on that.  Maybe they have an ex that screwed them over or they hate their mom and try to pin it on her.  Then the police have to wade through all sorts of bullshit."
UnresolvedMysteries,3d0waa,aherewego,2,Mon Jul 13 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"You have to do more than just phone in the tip though -- police have to investigate and find it warranted, right?

UnresolvedMysteries,3d0waa,Zickefoose,6,Mon Jul 13 03:06:26 2015 UTC,I'm not saying anybody has fraudulently collected reward money.  I'm saying that I'm pretty sure some people have tried to turn in people they didn't like for crimes they didn't commit to get the reward money.  The police will obviously figure it out but that distracts from finding the real criminal and I'm sure the police would get pretty riled.

I was there the night Unsolved Mysteries was filming at the stairwell on the university's campus.

I think the same thing when I read of how a body or bodies were found and people living there had no idea...like the fairly recent story of the woman who had been murdering and hiding her infants' bodies in her home or garage and the husband didn't know (sorry no link, I can't remember where either).  I think after a period of time, the odor goes away and the person just becomes bones or is mummified."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cxhns,TheBestVirginia,3,Mon Jul 13 20:37:18 2015 UTC,"I know the case you mean, and I remember thinking the same thing about that too. It was definitely the garage. I always imagined she put them in a chest freezer, even though I'm*  pretty sure she didn't. I figure bodies must stop smelling eventually but I always wonder how it gets past that stage without people noticing. Had a number of cases in my locale with old people dying (of natural causes) and no one realising until a neighbour complained about the smell or the power getting cut off. One time some old guy died in an apartment, no one noticed for like three years, and then the next old guy to live there died too but neighbour smelled it."

Totally off topic, but I have a deep affinity for the elderly and have actually thought about trying to organize some type of charity group where local police officers (of various jurisdictions) act as voluntary ""lookouts"" for the elderly in their area who live alone.    Basically, that the officer will have a number of elderly individuals that he will check in with maybe once a week or every other week, making sure their utilities are on, the house is in live able condition, that they don't have some low-life grand kid or great nephew using the home to run drugs or what not.    I'd prefer it be law enforcement because they need to come inside the home, and if civilian volunteers are used, it might attract someone with bad intentions.  Kind of like Meals On Wheels, but more like Welfare Check on Wheels.  Anyhow, that's my idea but I don't know how to set it up.  Thanks for letting me vent a bit here!"

The Ramones use of Germanic/Nazi imagery comes from Dee Dee growing up in Germany with abusive parents: the only people who were kind to him would have been ex-Nazi's so Dee Dee spent pretty much his whole life trying to reconcile how kind they were with what they had done. Joey picked up Dee Dee's nazi references, and Dee Dee picked up Joey's repetitive structure (which in turn came from his OCD). Johnny and Joey shared a neighbourhood, but didn't like or know each other that well. Joey was in a glam band called Sniper(? I think) and was supposed to be the Ramones drummer.

Johnny and Joey also had different types of cancer, if I remember rightly. Arturo Vega, their designer, didn't die of cancer either, I believe it was complications from HIV that killed him. I think it's simply that it's a common cause of death and we're looking at people who spent decades weakening their bodies (Joey was an alcoholic for example) and I think that plays into it.   Are you referencing that End of The Century scene where he talks to himself? Poor DeeDee indeed. He's never going to get credit he deserves for his role in the Ramones I don't think, Johnny never managed to totally hold Joey back because Joey was the singer but he did a damn good job of hiding DeeDee's contributions and talent. DeeDee had a simple way with words, but he could make them hit home when he wanted to, and he had a bad ass ""1-2-3-4!"" let's be honest. I almost wish his Rap career had taken off (almost)."

Doug had been shot, bound and beaten nearly to death, but Nance still stabbed him in the chest with an oak-handle kitchen knife, puncturing one of his lungs. The killer then left to have his way with Kris, most assuredly intending to kill her afterward, as he had done with so many of his other victims. Somehow, Doug managed to muster enough strength to break loose from the clothesline that bound him. He grabbed the Savage, loaded it, and waited, knowing that if he headed upstairs for the bedroom, Nance would surely use Kris as a shield. Doug banged the butt of the rifle against the wall to get Nance’s attention. The ploy worked. Nance raced back toward the basement stairs, and as soon as he came into view Doug let him have it with the Savage.  In the meantime, Kris had managed to free herself except for one arm. Hearing the shot, she feared that Nance had killed her husband. Doug managed to stumble up the stairs, and when he saw the wounded Nance begin to rise, proceeded to pummel him with the butt of the rifle. As Nance crawled toward the bedroom, Doug continued to beat him with the gun until the butt splintered. By then, Nance was in range of the still-tethered Kris, who began to kick and punch him. Nance pulled his gun from its pouch on his belt and fired at Doug, missing him. His second shot caught Doug just above the knee, but Doug kept coming, beating Nance with the barrel of the rifle. In the process, he knocked the lamp off the bedside table, plunging the room into darkness. Doug heard another explosion, and as he lunged for the table where he kept a pistol, he hit the switch for the overhead light. When he grabbed the handgun and trained it on Nance, who lay on the floor convulsing and twitching, Doug saw that the criminal had shot himself.   I really hope this jackass' last thought was ""Boy, did I pick the wrong house."""

He was shooting the weapon blindly in the darkness when Doug smacked him, sending the barrel towards Nance's skull just as Nance was pulling the trigger.  Of course, by then Nance was already dying from the rifle wound, and would have expired soon, but the fact remains: the genius criminal accidentally ventilated himself."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cu3p3,cdesmoulins,5,Sat Jul 11 16:13:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's a stretch. Henley's not locked up for being Dean Corll's victim.

I know brainwashing is definitely a powerful thing, I also know that Henley's family was poor and he needed money, which Corrl gave him. Yes, at the end he was a willing participant, and perhaps even grew to enjoy it, but he would never have been there if Corrl hadn't victimized him first. If he was a woman, I think his case would have been viewed differently."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cu3p3,Psychopath-,8,Sat Jul 11 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with this mixed assessment -- as far as I can tell, Henley was both victim and accomplice. Forcing someone to participate in the victimization/abuse of another person is a powerful tool to compel their further compliance, and the way Corll brought Henley into it (the whole story about the sex slavery ring, then revealing to him during the murder of Frank Aguirre that he was already an accomplice to rape and murder) seems to have consciously exploited this. It sounds as if Henley also had the (fairly reasonable) fear that Corll might go after one of his brothers if he tried to leave him -- whether this was a real possibility or not, these are all factors that come into play even with less prolific crimes."

The crimes, which became known as the Houston Mass Murders, came to light only after Henley fatally shot Corll.  Corll was also known as the Candy Man and the Pied Piper, because he and his family had owned and operated a candy factory in Houston Heights, and he had been known to give free candy to local children.   At the time of their discovery, the Houston Mass Murders were considered the worst example of serial murder in American history.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cs6q8,taylightly,133,Fri Jul 10 10:01:11 2015 UTC,"From India. This case was big when it happened. I believe they charged the parents with the murder last year.   Edit: Details that got to me. (IIRC)  1) The girl had a blow to the head and her neck was sliced. Whoever did it dressed up the body by cleaning the blood, putting her favourite toys next to her and her vagina was swabbed clean.   2) According to the logs, the murder happened sometime around 11pm, but the interesting thing is that someone SWITCHED OFF the WiFi router that was kept in her room, two hours later. Can you imagine that scene? Murdered girl in the room, blood everywhere. You need to be messed up in the head to walk past all of that just to switch off a WiFi router.   3) The initial investigation had a lot of things that were sketchy. The police didn't investigate the roof for a day or so, when they discovered his body. They allowed the parents to clean up the ENTIRE room where she was murdered. Also swabs for semen detection were tampered with.   4) The parents were in the adjacent room, and claimed they heard nothing. A blow to the head, neck slit, and no screams that awoke them. They claim to have slept blissfully unaware.     Edit II:  When it happened, we all believed it was the parents. They were the only other people in the house. The girl and the manservant had the same cut on the neck, which was done surgically. They were both dentists (IIRC).   The most popular theory was that the parents woke up hearing a noise, and found the girl and the manservant in bed together. Dad hit him with some sort of blunt instrument (golf club or something, I forget.) and on the second swing, hit the girl by mistake. The manservant was bleeding and they dragged him to the terrace by wrapping him up in a bedsheet (they found bloody footprints on the stairs and a bloody bedsheet.) where they slit his throat with their surgical instruments. They then came down and did the same to her, and dressed up the body.   All these details and more in the wiki. It's a fascinating read."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cs6q8,bonniethecat95,11,Fri Jul 10 12:27:11 2015 UTC,"There are strong counters to some of these points: 1. The dressing up of the crime scene: Neither the original investigators (the UP Police) or the first CBI team claimed this had occurred. It wasn't until the second CBI team took over and chose the parents as lead suspects that 18 months later that this claim was made. As for the cleaning of the body/vagina, the post-mortem makes no mention of this until again, after the second CBI team took over, it was changed multiple times to add new details. I highly recommend reading Avirook Sen's book, pages 62-78, which covers this in detail. 2. The router: The CBI claims there was activity on the router, but never provides more detail then that. This link http://ptlb.in/cfrci/?p=63 provides a very concise explanation of the emptiness of this claim by the prosecution. 4. The noise. Sounds tests conducted by the CBI itself concluded that with the AC on and the door closed, it is entirely plausible that the sleeping couple did not hear a commotion in Aarushi's room."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cs6q8,VidhyaKumar,13,Sat Jul 11 04:57:44 2015 UTC,Why would they kill their own kid? I can understand the embarrassment and shame on their part but why would they take the most extreme measure and kill their own daughter? Did this happen in a rural area because if it did then it would make some sense. Rural areas are seemingly way more conservative in these aspects.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cs6q8,gwevidence,23,Fri Jul 10 21:54:58 2015 UTC,"That's (part of) the reason I'm doubtful the parents did it. Both parents were well-educated and they actually had an inter-caste marriage, so not your typical traditional ""country bumpkins.""   Furthermore, if the parents did it, why did they do such a crappy job of covering up the murder? I believe they may have been involved in trying to cover up sexual evidence - trying to give their young daughter some modicum of modesty after her murder is understandable to me - but I'm not convinced they brutally killed her. What would be their motive in that case?  I'm on mobile so I can't quote the wiki, but it provides some explanation for holes in the parents' stories, like why they didn't hear the murder, why was the door locked, etc. Furthermore, the parents were wearing the same clothes all night, and weren't covered with blood, as I imagine somebody who bludgeoned and slit the throats of two people would be. Both parents also passed all lie-detector and brain-mapping tests.  Again, none of this is conclusive. But the evidence against the parents is circumstantial too. Anyway, I think either way, this case is going to be hard, or even impossible to solve, ESPECIALLY given the incompetence and flat-out corruption of the investigating officers."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cs6q8,humachine,4,Tue Jul 14 12:13:18 2015 UTC,Are their any Hindu instances of honor killings?
UnresolvedMysteries,3cs6q8,ReginaldDwight,14,Sat Jul 11 06:34:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are Hindu instances of honour killings, but the label never really fit in this case. An honour killing is not a crime of passion, but a deliberate decision, usually taken by the entire family, that the killing must take place to protect the honour of the family. The prosecution alleges that Rajesh Talwar killed both Aarushi and Hemraj in a state of rage, so then it's a crime of passion (leave aside the fact that there is no evidence Hemraj was in Aarushi's room at all). I also find it very difficult to believe that both the parents would decide to kill their own daughter, who by all accounts they cherished and spent years trying to conceive, even if they had caught her in some indecent act. Yes, Rajesh Talwar is a Punjabi, but he hardly fits the profile. He married outside of his community (Nupur is Maharashtrian), which would not happen if he was so traditional, and they were urban medical professionals living a life that anyone living in a major urban centre in the world would recognize. Nothing's impossible, but I just find it highly improbable."

If the girl was hit in the head while she was a asleep there wouldn't have been much to hear since she wouldn't have had a chance to scream or struggle.  Also, if the original theory was that the servant murdered the girl they apparently were willing to accept that the parents hadn't heard anything when they held that theory so why is it suddenly impossible once the servant is dead.  Again, I think the parents sound shady as hell but that one thing doesn't sound like evidence of anything."

I became really engrossed in this story because it's really crazy and amazing.  There are so many valid questions and whatifs that a reader can ask throughout the story.  It's just a shame that the investigation and evidence-collecting was such a fuck up, destroying the lives of many people that may be innocent.    I'm pasting below my original thoughts (edited below for better readability and theorizing) that I had back when I read this case a year ago on this sub.  Warning: Very long!    That wikipedia page, wow.  10/10.  Full of details, good chronological order, lots of explanations, even a diagram.  A few but negligible issues in ease of reading (in terms of the written English).  But one of the best, if not the best, wiki pages I've ever encountered on these kinds of mysteries.  I highly recommend readers to read that wikipedia page.  It's really lame that it seems most of the other commenters here didn't bother and are just giving their kneejerk opinions on honor killings.  Yeah, yeah, honor killings are bad, no shit.  But that's only 1 possible piece out of like 50 pieces to this case that can be argued over.    I'm going to have to come back and think about it again but my initial thoughts:    Did the three men (Krishna, Rajkumar and Vijay) confess to the murders before the narco analysis/truth serum?  I guess they can always deny it by claiming they were forced to confess under duress.  But it somehow seemed like there was a good amount of circumstantial evidence surrounding them (2 out of 3 of them were found with blood-stained items in their houses, although tests were inconclusive).  Given that they confessed (technically) and that the circumstantial evidence surrounding the Talwars aren't much better despite the Talwars being zealously pursued and then convicted in the future on that, I'm surprised the three Nepalese weren't charged/pursued further (although it sounds like they were treated very roughly by the police during their investigation.  But, it also sounds like anyone who was suspected by the police had to go through some really unpleasant shit).   The police/CBI are quite a clusterfuck.  And what's with the courts?  When the 2nd CBI team wanted to close the investigation, the Talwars appealed to keep it open to continue searching for the perpetrators, and then in response to that appeal the courts rejected the Talwars' appeal and instead move to arrest them??  CBI says ""Close investigation,"" Talwars say ""No, keep it open,"" and the courts say, ""No, arrest the Talwars.""  Then after that, the courts proceed to reject every Talwar request for more evidence, and then convict the Talwars even though it seems that the CBI's case wasn't that strong at all.  Geez.   With so many facts and claims flying around, it's sad that someone was convicted with such lacking evidence.  The main problem I have with the theory that the parents murdered Aarushi and Hemraj is that it seems to have been established fairly early that Hemraj was likely killed on the terrace.  It seems unlikely to me that Rajesh killed the two in Aarushi's room, dragged Hemraj up to the terrace, and then he and Nupur cleaned up all that blood inside right up to the terrace and then ""dressed up"" Aarushi's state or whatever.  I wonder if they found any of Hemraj's blood in Aarushi's room?  If they can only find Aarushi's blood, that should exonerate the parents IMO (unless one says that Rajesh talked Hemraj into going up to the terrace with him and then Rajesh killed him there).    Edit: Looks like the chance to check if there was Hemraj's blood in the room was lost since Aarushi's room was cleaned supposedly with ""undue haste"" by the Talwars, while the Talwars insist that they were given permission to clean up by the police.    Continued below."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cs6q8,typesoshee,4,Sat Jul 11 17:50:13 2015 UTC,"Other thoughts:  1 - A slight ""inconsistency"" in the ""Rajesh didn't want anyone going to the terrace"" theory.  Theory: so on May 16, it's alleged that when some people pushed the police to investigate the terrace due to what looked like bloodstains in the area and the police asked Rajesh for the key to the terrace, Rajesh was slow or claimed to not find the key. The door couldn't be broken down either, so investigation of the terrace was left to the next day. If Rajesh was the murderer, delaying the discovery of Hemraj's body helps him (let the police waste time and resources on pursuing Hemraj elsewhere, like his native village in Nepal), so the theory is that Rajesh deliberately slowed down any investigation into the terrace.  On May 17, Dinesh (Rajesh's brother) and Gautam are looking around the place. It's said that on the previous day, Sushil Chaudhury (Dinesh's friend, whom I'm interpreting as a family friend doctor brought in as a forensics consultant) tried to make Gautam expunge any mention of possible sexual stuff from Aarushi's post-mortem. The theory here is ""Rajesh's long-con"", which is that if, say, Hemraj's semen is found in Aarushi's post-mortem, that gives credence to the ""Rajesh killed Aarushi and Hemraj when he found them in a compromising state"" theory. Thus, it would be in Rajesh's interest if Hemraj's DNA is not found in a sexual way in Aarushi's post-mortem and instead DNA of, say, the three Nepalese men (K, R, and V) are found with Aarushi's body.  So, back to what I was talking about, the ""inconsistency."" On May 17, Dinesh (Rajesh's brother) and Gautam are looking around the place. Then, we are told by Gautam that Dinesh requested Gautam to push the police to get the terrace door opened. Thus, this is an inconsistency in what Dinesh's role is, i.e. ""which side is he on."" From the Chaudhury thing (expunging sexual stuff from Aarushi's post-mortem), it seems that Dinesh is trying to protect Rajesh by fudging with Aarushi's post-mortem report. But now, he's asking someone to hurry up and open the terrace door, which, if Rajesh is the murderer, is something that doesn't help Rajesh at all. IMO, calling for the terrace door to be opened seems like Dinesh is acting neutrally and genuinely wants the investigation to progress. His involvement in the Chaudhury thing isn't strong enough for me to be convinced that he's acting nefariously with Rajesh to try to protect Rajesh. Maybe he just wanted some ""dignity"" for Aarushi or something like that and so wanted to avoid any public sexual allegations.  If Rajesh is the murderer and you want to protect Rajesh, you would do whatever it takes to slow down discovery of the terrace, and Dinesh did the complete opposite of that.  Police were really, really lethargic about getting to the terrace that day, and Dinesh seems to have single-handedly sped up the discovery of the terrace.  If Dinesh were really trying to protect Rajesh with the Chaudhury thing, then his pushing for getting to the terrace is an inconsistency in his role.  Thus, it's more likely that the Chaudhury thing was just for Aarushi's ""dignity,"" and the terrace thing was him being genuine about pushing the investigation forward.    2 -   The police also photographed a blood-stained shoe print on the terrace; the shoeprint size was 8 or 9   and   The size of the shoeprint found on the terrace was 8 or 9, while Rajesh's shoe size is 6.[51]   to me is strong evidence that the Talwars were not the murderers. They need to find that size 8-9 shoeprint. Perhaps one of the 3 Nepalese?  3 -   Gautam saw three glasses, two of which had some quantity of liquor in them, while the third one was empty. He also found three bottles: Kingfisher beer, a Sprite and Sula whisky.[56] Later, DNA of Hemraj was found on the Kingfisher bottle,[57] although according to CBI's investigators, he was a teetotaler.[58]   Another piece of testimony that points away from Rajesh and towards the three Nepalese men. (Why would a housekeeper have three bottles of drinks, 2 of them alcoholic, and three unwashed cups left in his room?  Not to mention the Scotch in the living room.)  However, there seems to be some strange uncertainty in this section about whether Gautam is that convinced of the presence of three men that night, if you read that section of the Wiki page (""Hemraj's Room"", ctrl+f for ""On 1 July 2008, the first CBI team recorded a statement by KK Gautam"").  4 -   The key to the terrace door was never found. According to the Talwars, this key was present in Hemraj's bunch of keys, which went missing after the murders.[64]   This is interesting to me. Who has more incentive or is more likely to be able to make the keys disappear if they were the murderer: Rajesh (and Nupur) or the three Nepalese?  5 -   The phone records confirmed that Nupur called Hemraj's phone from the Talwars' landline at 6.01 a.m on 16 May. The call was picked up, but disconnected after two seconds.[1] This was the last call received on the phone, which was somewhere in the coverage area of the Nithari village cell tower 1362/254. The cell tower had a radius of around 1 km, and covered the apartment complex in which the Talwars (and Krishna) lived.[67][68] The police thus suspect that the killer was present inside the house or in its vicinity on the morning of 16 May.[1] Hemraj's phone was never found, but according to the CBI, the number was briefly active in Punjab.[68]   If the three Nepalese are the murderers, this all makes sense. If you got a call from your victim's phone the next morning, you'd freak and shut the phone off. Then get rid of it. If the Talwars are the murderers, we have to make up a story to figure out how all of this is possible. Nupur calls Hemraj's cell from the landline. Either she or Rajesh picks up the call in the apartment, hangs up, and then shuts off the phone ""to make it appear as if a murderer is out there with Hemraj's phone."" Then they somehow get rid of it after 6:01AM (when that call was made), while the police, the neighbors, and relatives start to descend on their house (which starts at ~6:15AM according to this source). I feel like it's more likely that it was one of the three Nepalese that had the phone at 6 AM that morning, but I suppose it's not impossible that the Talwars had it and were trying to fake a murderer, and somehow succeeded in hiding and later disposing Hemraj's cell phone.  Continued."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cs6q8,typesoshee,3,Sat Jul 11 18:20:18 2015 UTC,"Continued:  6 - Aarushi's phone being shut off at 9:10 PM (uncharacteristically early for her) is interesting to me.  The fact that her friend Anmol was trying to contact Aarushi later that night corroborates that Aarushi's phone indeed was turned off earlier than normal (simply because Anmol's actions corroborate that.  Why else would he try to contact Aarushi through her cell and the Talwars landline even after 9PM that night?). Her phone is later found by unrelated people randomly on the street.   It's hard what to make out of the phone being turned off early. There's always the possibility that Aarushi turned it off randomly for no reason. But if we're to believe that it was turned off forcibly or by someone else, it would point toward the Talwars.  We know that their driver Umesh, the last outsider to see them on the night of the murder, saw them between 9-10PM on May 15.  Thus, the Talwars as murderers are ""in control"" of the house from 10PM to 6AM. (The last activity of Aarushi's phone was 9:10PM, so it would have been shut off any time after that.)  If the Talwars are the murderers, it's in their interest to cut off communication with the outside that night that they can't control (i.e. Aarushi's cell).  (Nupur's cell being uncharacteristically shut off on the previous evening and then not turned on until a few days later can fit into this theory as well.)  Although this means that there had to have been some degree of premeditation that night (if not premeditation to commit murders, perhaps the premeditation to have some kind of intense discussion with everyone in-house about something, like to make sure that everyone will agree to keep scandalous family affairs secret or whatever that could have escalated to an argument and then murders), since we can assume that nothing really related to the murders happened before 9:10PM.  So after Umesh leaves, let's say they shut off Aarushi's cell and are then ""in control"" after that without being bothered if someone calls Aarushi's cell later that night and finds that she doesn't answer.  But Rajesh has a lot of mundane business and internet activity going on in the house until 11:30PM to midnight.  If we believe it was the three Nepalese that did it, any attack on Aarushi would have to have happened after Rajesh's mundane internet activity that was between 11:30PM and midnight. And if so, the house had to have been in peace up to Rajesh's internet usage that night.  That means, assuming the parents aren't the murderers, the only way to explain Aarushi's phone being shut off early (while the house is in peace) is either the battery ran out or Aarushi randomly decided to shut it off early.   The theory that the parents are the murderers, in order to include the circumstantial evidence of Aarushi's cell phone being shut off ""uncharacteristically,"" would be that some sort of conflict between the parents and Aarushi caused the parents to have her cell phone shut off early that night as well as the landline's ringer also shut off (after the call with the US at 11PM) to cut off contact from the outside (to allow themselves the privacy of some intense in-house discussion, or if the act had already been committed, cleaning up after the murders). However, Rajesh's numerous calls that night up to 11PM seem to show that nothing was going wrong in the house at least up to 11PM since his activity was pretty frequent - he was making calls every 5 to 10 minutes or so continuously up until 11PM. Not conclusive (it's possible that those business and internet activities continued while a verbal conflict was going on between the parents and A and H), but believable that those activities show that the house was in peace up to midnight, and thus hard to believe that the parents made Aarushi turn off her cell or they turned off her cell with premeditation even for an intense in-house discussion.   7 -    There was no sign of forced entry into Aarushi's room, which would usually be locked at night. Someone outside the room could open it only with a key usually kept beside Nupur's bedside. The parents could not explain how the murderers gained access to this key, which was found in the living room after the murder.   If the parents are the murderers, this is saying that they couldn't figure out a way to get rid of the keys to Aarushi's room.  Yet they figured out a way to get rid of Aarushi's cell, Hemraj's cell, and Hemraj's keys to the house, as well as the knife they used. If they could get rid of the latter 4 items, I feel like they should have been able to dispose of their keys to Aarushi's room as well (this is all assuming that they wanted to make it look like the murderers had possession of all these items and thus took these items with them when they escaped.  Assuming that the police searched their apartment thoroughly, the latter 4 items were indeed displaced from the apartment after the murders.). I'm tempted to think that either 1. Aarushi's room door was left open by Aarushi or the parents randomly that night, 2. the murderers simply knocked on the door and Aarushi opened thinking it was her parents or Hemraj asking for something innocuous/mundane or 3. the parents randomly left the keys to Aarushi's room in the living room that night and the murderers found them there.  8 -    Rajesh ignored the police's request for the key to the terrace door. An attempt had been made to hide Hemraj's body, as evident by the fact that it had been covered with a cooler panel and that the iron grill separating the adjacent terrace had been covered with a bed sheet. The police suspected that the Talwars planned to blame Aarushi's murder on Hemraj, and hid his body on the terrace for disposing it off later. However, the media glare and a constant stream of visitors made it impossible for them to get rid of the body.   This point is interesting because while Hemraj's body was concealed, Aarushi's was arguably not - while her body was covered by a blanket and school bag, the door to her room was left open (discovered by her parents, though). I'm not sure I believe that the perpetrator(s) planned to move Hemraj's body later - who leaves the scene of a crime where it's 99% likely that one body (Aarushi) will be found but plans to come back to dispose of the 2nd body later?  Of course the place will be investigated and searched by police after the 1st body is discovered.  And if it were Rajesh who was the murderer, he concealed Hemraj but voluntarily discovered and exposed Aarushi's death at 6AM on May 16? It would have been in his interest to conceal Aarushi's death until he figured out something better for Hemraj's body. (Although what precipitated events that morning was the arrival of the maid Bharati - but couldn't they have figured out some delaying tactic for Bharati instead?  Just lock the door to Aarushi's room and tell Bharati to just clean the common areas.)  The fact that Rajesh ""voluntarily"" discovered Aarushi's body tells me that he couldn't have had any special plans to dispose of Hemraj's body later.  Rather than Rajesh killing both A and H, concealing H, voluntarily discovering A's body, and then dilly-dallying over the terrace key to delay discovery of H's body (if this was his plan, again, he should just have delayed discovery of A's body for as long as possible as well), it's more believable to me if the 3 Nepalese killed A, didn't know what to do with the body so semi-concealed it, argued with H, killed him on the terrace, concealed H's body, and then scrammed.  Also,    The CBI later stated that the dimensions of the striking surface of the golf club bearing No. 5 were identical to the dimensions of the injuries on the heads of the victims.[139]    ...   According to Rajesh, the golf clubs bearing No. 4 and No. 5 were originally placed in his car. When the car was sent for servicing (before the murders), the driver Umesh placed them in Hemraj's room. This was confirmed by Umesh. Rajesh also says that he never tried to hide these clubs: they were always in plain sight of the investigators, and when he had moved to Delhi, all his belongings, including the golf clubs, were packed under the supervision of a CBI inspector.[5][118] However, the CBI states that in the photographs of room of Hemraj, taken by CFSL on 1 June 2008, only one golf club is visible and the other is missing.    So it sounds like the 3 Nepalese or any intruders through Hemraj's room would have had access to the golf clubs in question.   Continued below."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cs6q8,jilliefish,3,Sat Jul 11 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"9 -    Rajesh's driver Umesh testified that the clothes worn by Rajesh on the morning of 16 May were the same as the ones he saw him wearing the previous night when he came to return the keys. His description of Rajesh's clothes matched that of the maid Bharati, who told the court that Rajesh was wearing a red T-shirt and a half trouser, while Nupur was wearing a blue maxi gown.[16][105] There was only Aarushi's blood on Rajesh's clothes, but no blood of Hemraj could be traced on these clothes. There was no blood on the clothes that Nupur was seen wearing in the photographs taken by Aarushi on the night before.[12] This implied that the parents could not have committed the murders under sudden provocation, as speculated by the police.[5][106]   Believable for me. If they killed A and H in a fit of rage, H's blood should have been found on Rajesh's clothes, which he was wearing the night before and the day after. Thus, Rajesh couldn't have killed H in a fit of rage, and there is no reason to believe that he killed H in a calculated manner (e.g. involving changing into a separate set of clothes just to kill H).  If Rajesh couldn't have killed H in a fit of rage and it's not believable that he was calculated in his killing of H, I don't think Rajesh killed H.   The parents also pointed out that they would not indulge in something like honor killing, as they came from liberal educated families and had an inter-caste marriage.[107]   Believable for me because I'm not sure if the type of family that would honor kill would also give their daughter a cell phone to use on her own. It seems like they give her a lot of freedom (her own room, which implies her own internet as well, and her own bedtime - it sounds like the parents going to sleep before Aarushi went to sleep was a normal thing for the family). The parents giving her a camera that night sounds like they were on good terms. This would be even more conclusive if we knew that the parents knew Aarushi talked a lot with this male friend Anmol.  If it could be established that the parents didn't care that Aarushi might have had a boyfriend in Anmol, I don't see them being the type of people who would honor kill.  (Honor-killing types generally don't allow their unmarried daughters to have male friends, I imagine.)  Also, there were tabloid rumors that the Talwars were wife swappers. I feel like this implies that some in the Indian media did in fact perceive the Talwars as liberal people (education, profession, neighborhood, inter-caste marriage, etc.), not the honor-killing type. (Liberal people being wife swappers is believable.  Super conservative, honor-killing types of people being wife swappers is not believable, even for tabloid-readers.  If you suspect the Talwars, make a choice, are they wife-swapper or are they honor-killing types?  My main point here is that some Indian readership did in fact perceive the Talwars as liberal people, which is why the tabloids made up the wife-swapping story.  But if they're liberal people by Indian standards, then I don't see them being honor-killing types at the same time.)      Wow, that was a lot, but that Wikipedia page has so much material.  My final thought is that the court that convicted the Talwars seemed really biased and uninterested in finding and establishing new evidence.  That's stupid.  The hardest evidence (that depends the least on speculating about motives and intangibles) for me are the shoeprints, Rajesh's clothes, and the disappearance of Aarushi's cell, Hemraj's cell, and Hemraj's keys (as well as the murder knife) coupled with the non-disappearance of the parents' keys to Aarushi's room.  These all point to the innocence of the Talwars.  It's quite a failure that nothing conclusive came out of the supposed bloodstains found on the items of 2 out of 3 of the Nepalese when the police detained them at their homes."

The fact that her body was surrounded by toys and cleaned, and that all signs of potential sexual abuse seemed to have been purposefully obfuscated...that's potentially a parent feeling so embarrassed that something like that went on underneath their nose, in their own house, and trying to hide it even in her death."

What I mean is it is easier to get away with or conceal criminal activity in places such as India if someone can afford to pay bribes.  Sort of on a tangent, but in many cases, what we might call bribes in North America, another cultural context may see more as fines, service fees or compensation depending on the circumstances.   But back to my point there is unfortunately corrupt behavior as well as nepotism within the Indian government and police (as can be found anywhere in the world of course)... And in some parts of India this creates a situation where flat out bribery happens.   If this is mixed with the unfortunate misogyny law enforcement and government appear to uphold in the area (for example in their reactions and attitudes towards domestic violence and rapes)  I could see how a wealthy person that committed a crime against a woman might think they could bribe their way out of it."

Her heart was beating too rapidly to allow its chambers to fill before they pumped, so her blood pressure was plummeting.    These are the effects of arsine when exposed to a large dose. Along with kidney failure. Arsine smells like garlic. but how would she have come in contact with it?  reading here, http://fpnotebook.com/ER/Toxin/Vscnt.htm  I see that some of these agents have been used occasionally as chemotherapeutic medicine. Maybe she was trying to treat herself at home? Maybe a quack was selling her the stuff?  and this, this would be a smell associated with urea buildup in her blood, from kidney failure:   Welch sniffed the syringe and smelled something, too: I thought it would smell like chemotherapy, the way the blood smells putrid when people are taking some of those drugs. Instead, Welch says, it smelled like ammonia.   http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/833740-overview   It may also be produced inadvertently by mixing arsenic-containing insecticides and acids.   I almost wonder if there's some kind of chemical interaction that happened, where she was using an arsenic-based home treatment and the medications they gave her, or something else she was exposed to, caused a chemical reaction that produced this in the ER.  I'm no chemist and I'd love to hear why I'm wrong, this is just a crapshoot.  edit to add:  she had at least one industrial solvent in her system:   Dimethyl sulfone is a molecule composed of one sulfur atom, two carbons, six hydrogens, and two oxygens. It is manufactured as an industrial solvent,   so why not arsine as well? it's produced in industrial settings...~~  on further thought, DMSO. because yeah it wouldn't evaporate at room temp, but how hot does a defribillator get?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,resonanteye,11,Fri Jul 10 05:41:19 2015 UTC,"Dimethyl sulfone can be used as an industrial solvent, but it is also naturally occurring and is present in food and beverages. The LD50 for dimethyl sulfone is 17.5 grams per kilogram in rats. Assuming that Gloria weighed at least 45 kilograms (100 lbs), 787 grams or 1.73 lbs of DMSO would be a potentially fatal dose. I really don't see that being a likely cause of her death.  DMSO2 would probably not have any effect if inhaled by the ER staff.  Shallow, rapid breathing and the fruity breath could be symptoms of ketoacidosis. Arsine could also cause some of those symptoms, but it also causes one VERY important symptom that isn't mentioned in Gloria's case: Hemolysis.   I suppose that hyperammonaemia could potentially cause blood to have a slight odor, but it would actually be more indicative of liver failure than kidney failure, IMHO."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,Sam_Strong,24,Fri Jul 10 09:42:19 2015 UTC,"No, I don't mind at all. Be gentle; I'm a 16yo pulling two consecutive all-nighters. It's really long, though. I'm gonna have to post two comments. 😅  The long story goes like this. My mother was a young woman in the US during the mid 70's. She had dropped out of school in 8th grade to support her four other siblings at home; her mother was an underpaid businesswoman and her father was mentally impaired from a construction accident where he fell three stories.  My mother never went to school past 7th grade. What she learned before then has mostly faded, due to the poisoning or something else, I am not sure. Although a native English speaker, she has difficulty writing simple words even for a shopping list. Instead, she takes pictures of what she needs from labels at home or pauses the TV to take pictures of the screen. She wasn't always like that, though.  During a time where able-body employment was as easily obtained as walking in and lying about one's age, my mother bounced from job to job. Her first was the graveyard shift at a cemetery, disposing of dead flowers and making sure everything stayed put in the marshes of Florida. She often tells a story of where she tripped over a marker during the rain and stepped on a freshly dug grave and  sunk into the ground up to her groin. She calls it the ""closest encounter she's had to death"" then nervously laughs at her own joke.  Quickly, she found she was a jack of all trades and could get nearly any job involving labor; car mechanics, lawn care, painting, garbage collection, you name it. But what she really wanted to do was chemistry, having dreamt of it from a young age. To this day, sometimes she asks me to pull up ""the show with all the experiments"", the YouTube channel RedHotNickleBall. She'll watch the same videos for hours, saying over and over sometimes: ""I wish I did that. I want to do that.""  The classifieds drew her to a nice part of town to do pool upkeep. She figured the tips were good and she worked for the most wealthy people on the beach. When she discovered the nature of her work, she would steal pH strips, drops, graduated cylinders, chlorine and tabs to take home and play with.  When she fell pregnant from her abusive fiancé, she could no longer do this and decided to apply for a job where she could take it easy while still being outside-- the new industry of mosquito control.  During the 70's and 80's the thought of pesticides for commercial and home use was a big hit. Business exploded for a much-needed industry for a serious issue in Florida. Any business or home could have their property sprayed and be free from the hellspawn called mosquitoes. Counties across the state were paying top dollar to buy tanks and employees for the jobles. My mother was hired by a county that we'll call Palmtree, which is not its real name due to the nature of the story.   It was a mostly cut and dry job. A guy would drive a trailer-truck with a detachable tank on it and my mother would sit and spray the stuff while coasting at 5mph. In a tight space, they'd park wherever and go in and spray. All this was done with no gloves, no masks, nothing. Often from braking of the truck or simply from a leaky hoseline, chemicals got on near everyone's skin and clothes. At the end of the day, the pesticides were cleaned out of the tanks by hand.  Palmtree County's profits soared, and life was good. My mother made decent money and things seemed okay for her child in utero, minus the at-home abuse. Her status rose and she was able to work in multiple jobs in the Palmtree Utilities department including water and fecal collections from sewers and lakes as well as mosquito control, since mosquitos thrive on standing water. She was under the direction of my father, who back then was simply her boss.  During her 3rd trimester, mother grew ill during flu season. This was only a minor concern for her and the baby, yet she decided to see her doctor anyways. The doctor ran tests but found nothing wrong, yet my mother had vomiting, migraines, labored breathing, confusion, and weakness. She was assured it would pass so she continued to work.  The remainder of her pregnancy was difficult to say the least. Although she neither smoked nor drank, her son has Tourettes and severe behavioral issues that have lasted now into his late 30's. She will not discuss the details of his birth, but has said the doctors told her she would not be able to carry a child again. I know only from arguments in my home during my childhood that it is extremely painful for her to have any vaginal penetration.   After her son was born, she returned immediately to work as she had no other options for money thanks to her deadbeat fiancé. She assumed that her continuing illness was a result of the hospital environment or simply the stress of birth. Frequently having to take off work for her worsening state, she visited her doctor once again who assured her she could find nothing wrong, but did suspect otherwise.   We'll call her Dr. Emeline McClellan. My mother and Dr. McClellan had been friends since their teens; McClellan and my mother would frequent the same Mister Donut and at times would sneak her into the high school for lunch. One might say that due to their relationship, McClellan took extra care for my mother, as I always had thought. Yet after reading obituaries for her, I discovered how remarkably famed she was; she participated in Doctors Without Borders and travelled frequently to third world countries to educate on health and bring medicine. She was nationally known for her journals and research.   During their repeated and frequent visits, some of which were under the table due to my mother's financial situation, her condition worsened. It was upon my father's shoulders to dismiss her from the county.  My mother was ""diagnosed"" with many issues. Fibromyalgia, depression, ataxia and vertigo, high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, underactive thyroid, and numerous others. Around the time of her first diagnoses, she was showering at home when her entire uterus prolapsed. She consequently had a full hysterectomy.  Still no one had any idea what could possibly be the issue or where it stemmed from. From papers I have read, specialists my mother was referred to wrote caustic , backhanded remarks implying that she was falsifying her symptoms. I would imagine this ordeal would have only made her situation worse; I cannot imagine being so crippled, unable to raise your child or do things you love with nobody believing you but a doctor who doesn't even know what is wrong.  From here, my timeline is hazy. I have only small portions of stories that I have pieced together from my mother's constantly worsening memory. Please forgive me.  What I imagine was about two or three years later, McClellan read an article discussing a link between pesticides and death from areas like India and Malaysia. The exact correlation was unknown at that time. Everyone involved in the situation was astounded, mother says. McClellan was on a board of something or other and produced these findings to other doctors. Blood, urine, and fecal analysis were run on my mother yet again and sent to doctors not only in Florida, but the United States and soon internationally.   Although undeveloped in nature, research into the chemicals found in the pesticides used were found to be seriously harmful to humans. With McClellan's advice and financial support, my mother lawyered up with the small amount of money she had and brought a lawsuit against both the pesticide company and Pinetree County.  Soon my mother started receiving harassing calls and at-home visits from people she says, to this day, she did not know. Men in suits, she said, would come to her house wearing county nametags and tell her that if she told the media or even members of her family about the case that ""serious actions"" would be taken against her. She tells me sometimes she feared for the safety of her child and herself and that she recalls seeing county vehicles pass by her home numerous times a day. I do not know if this is legitimate information, as remember she is not all there anymore.  Completely without intention, McClellan's study was released in a scientific journal that made national headlines. It didn't take long for the local media to pick up on the link between a local csse and something big in national news.  With no fault of her own, her case garnered MASSIVE media coverage. I would have to hunt for them, but my mother has newspaper articles tucked away somewhere; her name was plastered upon newspapers and TVs all across Florida. I'm not sure if it her case specifically made national headlines, but if it happened now, I think it definitely would.  Legal battles I think are worse than a fist fight. Any little wrong move can break a case; if anyone loses their temper, it's over. It's all fine print and manipulation. My mother is not a smart woman and the best lawyers usually aren't the cheap ones. Unfortunately, yet unsurprisingly, my mother lost the suit."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,gushingly,22,Sat Jul 11 04:44:30 2015 UTC,"(part 2) However, the case led to a countywide investigation into the system involving the chemicals used in pesticides and wastewater treatment. A million+ dollar investment was shut down in less than ten years since its opening. Pinetree County was in serious financial trouble for years and was - and still is - under close supervision. They denied her worker's comp, insurance, and feigned stories and papers that ended up preventing her from obtaining disability or unemployment.  She lost everything. Her source of income, dignity, health, ability to work, and her then-husband. She was left to raise a child on her own who was already involved in gangs and drugs at 12.   So where are they now? My mother married the head manager of the utilities department, one of the only ones who had any remorse for her. They had already been friends yet their relationship was kept secret until the adoption of a child in 1999, myself. She is 59.  My father retired from Pinetree County in 2007 and receives $60k in retirement each year. He now works in the same position at a city near Pinetree.  My mother's son is currently serving 10 years in prison for domestic violence involving the duo of himself and his father against his young son.  McClellan was our family doctor until her death in 2012 from a skydiving accident. She had over 700 solo jumps and always said she wanted to go out with a bang.   I realize many of you reading this are much older than I. I feel like I have one chance to be able to speak to so many adults who in any other situation would not listen. I want to let you all know that more often than not, we take our intelligence for granted. We write incredible tales and make billion dollar movies about heroes that fly, turn invisible, and have super strength. We forget the wonders of the Earth that so many in history and even in other parts of the modern world would be incredulous of. The magic for the uninitiated is in the spark of electricity. In infinitesimally small, living creatures in a drop of water. In the wide array of colors possible in a flame. In chemical changes as simple as poisons to table salt.   And that's the story of how a grown woman with a 7th grade mind found herself in love with the same magic that will kill her. Thank you for reading her story."

Then more nurses start to have this allergy, and there are more signs. At one point I counted 10 signs barring people with any kind of scent from the floor. One night a co-worker and I were on the floor briefly and some old nurse comes running out sniffing my co-worker saying she was going to report her because she could smell her shampoo.  It became a witch hunt to punish people who didn't follow all their rules, and what I assume was a huge attention getting device for the nurses.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,Reckoner525,11,Fri Jul 10 08:14:41 2015 UTC,"Hazmat team found nothing, autopsy found nothing, paramedics who brought her in and had more contact with her than some of the staff (presumably) didn't get ill at all.  Mass hysteria does seem possible, accompanied by some sort of reverse placebo affect making people genuinely ill.  The chance of her body and medicines creating some freak conditions to make a deadly toxin that decomposed too quickly to be traced does not seem particularly likely (although not impossible)."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,tpeiyn,24,Fri Jul 10 12:24:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think that it was caused by DMSO, if she was even using that. It seems like the chemical reactions to convert to dimethyl sulfate are almost impossible.  I think that one of two things may have happened:  A) Gloria was using some sort of potential home remedy for her cancer. It was a pretty toxic substance (I think she may have suffered from keto acidosis, there are reports of her breath smelling fruity. The particles in her blood could have also been due to kidney or liver failure). Anyway, the substance may or may not have hastened her death due to it's toxicity. When she arrived at the ER, some personnel were overcome by fumes /whatever and reacted. Others may have suffered from a mass hysteria effect. I think some illness, like Gorchynski, wawad totally unrelated.  B) I don't know. I had an idea when I started typing but I lost it, LOL!"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,tpeiyn,19,Fri Jul 10 01:46:58 2015 UTC,"""Gorchynski, the most severely ill, spent two weeks in intensive care, where in addition to apnea she suffered from hepatitis, pancreatitis, and avascular necrosis, a condition in which bone tissue is starved of blood and begins to die. In her case the avascular necrosis attacked her knees, restricting her to crutches for months. It takes a really damn potent toxin to do all that, says Sheldon Wagner, a clinical toxicologist at Oregon State University""  I highly doubt that this was psychosomatic or mass hysteria. Its so weird."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,howwhenwhere,17,Fri Jul 10 02:28:22 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that Gorchynski's issues were totally related.  In fact, I think they were probably coincidental. I think she developed some sort of systemic infection that was not necessarily related to Gloria.  I believe that something DID happen with one or two members of the staff and they did faint or whatever. However,  I think that most of the remaining affected staff were victims of mass hysteria."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,tpeiyn,4,Fri Jul 10 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this wasn't just a worse case chain of events? She overused the DMSO, as well other medications because of the pain she was in, they gave her oxygen, and then performed an incision. The excessive amount of DMSO becomes DMSO2  with the high oxygen now in her blood, and with the incision it's released into the air knocking the staff off their feet. BUT one thing about using DMSO topically is that it allows toxins to more easily enter the body though the skin. So, anything this poor woman touched could have contaminated her blood. As she got sicker she kept using more DMSO. This really puts me off using home remedies."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,howwhenwhere,4,Fri Jul 10 14:30:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think that DMSO2 (dimethyl sulfone) could cause those problems, it is relatively harmless. I believe that DMSO4 (dimethyl sulfate) is a poisonous gas and COULD cause problems, but that it's formation was highly unlikely."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,tpeiyn,3,Fri Jul 10 14:49:16 2015 UTC,How is DMSO4 formed from DMSO?
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,howwhenwhere,5,Fri Jul 10 16:50:31 2015 UTC,"Not a chemist by any means, so take anything that I say with a grain of salt, but this is what I understand:  DMSO can be oxygenated metabolically or in the laboratory to form DMSO2. DMSO2 is pretty much harmless. Livermore Labs postulated that the electrical current from resuscitation attempts on Gloria could have caused DMSO4 to form from DMSO2.   Apparently, the formation of DMSO4 from DMSO2 is considered to be pretty much impossible and there is no scientific literature supporting that it can occur.   The Wikipedia entry for DMSO4 states that it can be synthesized in the following ways:  *The esterification of sulfuric acid with methanol  *Distillation of methyl hydrogen sulfate  *A combination of methyl nitrite and methyl chlorosulfonate  *The reaction of dimethyl ether with sulfur trioxide"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,JQuilty,3,Fri Jul 10 17:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right even she came in contact with half a chem lab she won't have gotten into all those necessary. This is so strange."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,Put-A-Bird-On-It,-22,Fri Jul 10 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"I think she may have suffered from keto acidosis, there are reports of her breath smelling fruity   That doesn't make much sense. Ketones are the polar opposite of sugary fruit -- they're fatty acids."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,sockerkaka,30,Fri Jul 10 05:47:27 2015 UTC,Fruity smelling breath is a telltale sign of ketoacidosis. It is something we look out for in diabetic patients. The best way I can describe it is very rotten juicy fruit.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,Put-A-Bird-On-It,3,Fri Jul 10 06:02:56 2015 UTC,"Is the fruity smell only associated with diabetic patients? My father is diabetic (type A) so I know what to be on the lookout for, but when I was on a strict keto diet myself, my breath smelled of acetone, not fruit."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,sockerkaka,2,Fri Jul 10 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not the expert on this, but to my knowledge ketoacidosis is directly related to diabetes, as it occurs when insulin levels are extremely low."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,ZodiacSF1969,2,Fri Jul 10 16:07:23 2015 UTC,"So I take it that's entirely different from ketosis, then? Makes sense. If ketoacidosis only affect diabetic patients, then Gloria Ramirez shouldn't have had the fruity breath because of it, right? Or was she diabetic?  Sorry about throwing a bunch of semi-rhetoric questions at you, I'm just trying to make sense of it."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,fm8,6,Fri Jul 10 18:03:37 2015 UTC,Ketones as a group include a very wide variety of different compounds.   Some of these compounds do produce a 'fruity' smell.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,verifiedshitlord,2,Fri Jul 10 06:32:05 2015 UTC,"As the other poster said, a person in ketoacidosis will have fruity smelling breath."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,resonanteye,12,Fri Jul 10 13:16:05 2015 UTC,Would Toxic Shock Syndrome make a person's blood toxic if exposed?   I'm thinking no but...???
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,itsalrightt,36,Fri Jul 10 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"Toxic shock is a bacterial overgrowth that takes over and makes a person go very septic very fast. It's not like an actual toxic chemical that could make others so sick, so quickly. It's basically a staph infection gone wild.  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/169177-overview"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,kittydentures,2,Fri Jul 10 05:03:09 2015 UTC,I was debating on posting this! I'm seriously interested in what was going on with her.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cqw7e,Jimbob50,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:35:02 2015 UTC,I've been intrigued with this case since I first read about it in that Discover Magazine story as a teenager. Thanks for bringing it back up for discussion! There's more here than the last time I looked into the case a few years ago.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cthov,bollykat,11,Fri Jul 10 17:22:43 2015 UTC,"So basically someone who heard about the Cicada 3301 stuff and thought it would be cool to do the same sort of thing, I guess. It's probably just some guy (maybe a few) with some spare time and a sense of humour trying to sound like a representative of a fake group possessing esoteric knowledge. I strongly suspect that if this person is ever actually found, a lot of people are going to be rather disappointed :)"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cthov,doc_daneeka,7,Fri Jul 10 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think anyone is expecting that there will be some wonderful secret knowledge that will be imparted to us. We're all just pretty stoked to know that it's actually a game, and not just the disjointed creations of crazy person.   The codes so far have been incredibly fun to unravel, and we've all become friends in the process. I don't think anyone will be disappointed. :)"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cthov,heyimatworkman,7,Fri Jul 10 20:03:33 2015 UTC,I'm already disappointed.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cthov,LittleMissChriss,5,Fri Jul 10 22:20:37 2015 UTC,"i have to admit, Loki made me think of it being some sort of weird marketing scheme for the next Thor movie but that doesn't come out until like 2017 and i can't really imagine marvel doing this xD"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,shuttlecox,15,Thu Jul 9 21:50:51 2015 UTC,the wig could possibly have been a scalp.   that's upsetting...
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,moneyonfire,10,Fri Jul 10 05:22:23 2015 UTC,"He scalped her and flayed the skin from her face. Makes me wonder if he cut them off together, then tried them on & decided to cut the face away from the hair. Yikes!"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,FormicaCats,11,Fri Jul 10 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"And the rest of them - now I need someone else to compare the photos because I don't have very good facial recognition skills.    Leicha M. Reilly, 1985, West Seneca (Buffalo suburb) Jeanne M. Scrima, 1980, last seen Erie, PA on way to Knox, NY and her car reappeared in Montgomery County, NY (1 hour northwest of Albany) Agnes Shoe, 1979, Glenville, NY (about 45 minutes northwest of Albany) (though even I can see that she bears very little resemblance to any of those pictures, she had red very curly hair) Sheryl Ann Tillinghast, 1973, Wassaic, NY (about 2 hours north of NYC and 1.5 hours south of Albany) (timeline should start in 1976) Maryanne Wesolowski, 1971, Glen Falls, NY (about an hour north of Albany) Karen Louise Wilson, 1985, Albany   So that was a pretty depressing break from working. But, all of these missing persons entries have very good pictures of the women so thought it might be helpful. I don't really see how he would have gotten his hands on portraits of his victims but even if none of the pictures match up, if he was prolific at all, the locations of all of these women are easily within reach of places associated with his crimes."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,TheBestVirginia,5,Thu Jul 9 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"I looked at NAMUS for women in both PA & NY, no one looks strikingly similar. The only thing that stood out was how many missing people have no photos!"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,anditwaslove,4,Fri Jul 10 02:14:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't finish going through both states, but I was on the same line of thought as you.  I used Charley Project.  I did find one entry from PA who somewhat resembles the girl in the lower right hand corner.  But the teeth don't seem right.  The pics aren't great quality, so it's hard to say.    Doubtful it's her, but I thought it was worth copying the link to share here.  Edit: the Charley Project (charleyproject.org) is a privately run site that pulls a lot of info from NAMUS but only posts cases with photos available.  If you haven't been, it is a great resource.  The admin is always adding new (even decades old) cases and she does cross reference with NAMUS.  She's even caught errors on NAMUS per her blog."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,FormicaCats,21,Fri Jul 10 04:20:20 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's one scary human being. Like that's the kind of F'd up that they make movies about. And you think to yourself 'yeah, right, as if'. Only he's actually real. I can't imagine what his victims went through, because I can't imagine him being the kind to mercifully kill them before torturing them. Makes me feel kind of ill. And I know you shouldn't judge on appearance... but he looks like one sick son of a bitch. You can literally imagine him sitting in an insane asylum, just laughing manically."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,autowikibot,7,Thu Jul 9 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"Those pictures definitely look like yearbook photos. also, post #9 on the websleuths thread makes a pretty startling comparison!"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,FormicaCats,5,Fri Jul 10 00:56:36 2015 UTC,"I agree!   Post #9 also suggests Beth Doe, and that one really makes me think. Her reconstruction doesn't look like any of these girls. She and her full term baby were found in December 1976, and I've read that her estimated time of death could have been as soon as 7-24 hours before she was found, with other sources citing up to a few days. A paper from New York was found with her body (she was found in PA), and it was dated September 1976. Mengel came to the US in November 1976, so there is such a slim timeline for him to have been able to commit this act. This would have been very unfamiliar territory for him, having to travel out of state."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,bokurai,6,Thu Jul 9 23:02:46 2015 UTC,He came to US from Guyana in November 1976 - so we can rule out anything being connected to him from before that time.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,champign0n,4,Thu Jul 9 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"Do you know where he actually lived? It seems a bit weird to me that he roamed like that across the state.   Western NY is like another planet from the Yonkers area - my sense of New York State geography is that if you're from Western or Central NY like my husband and I, your mental map doesn't really include anything between Albany and NYC, and really anything east or south of Syracuse is kind of murky. I would think it also works the other way, if you're based in NYC or Albany, for example, that would be the center of your mental map and probably cut off the most western parts of the state. It never seems right to me that New York borders Massachusetts!"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,Cucumberina,3,Thu Jul 9 23:38:46 2015 UTC,WestNY and PA are super connected though. (I grew up in PA)  It's creepy to recognize the area in that map.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,champign0n,3,Fri Jul 10 06:55:23 2015 UTC,An edge of that circle comes startlingly close to my home! I'm hoping he just made a very wide circle around those X's!
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,TheBestVirginia,3,Fri Jul 10 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure, but one article said his brother lived 6 blocks from the location where the 12 year old girl (who was later found murdered) went missing, which was Flushing. I think that Beverly Capone & the girl he (possibly) tried to abduct from the street who saw him with the 'wig' were things he did as he was fleeing from New York to Canada - people who just happened to be along the way.  One of the articles said that he traveled to Harrisburg to buy cars and to hunt, so it's possible he traveled to other areas for the same reason. I'll pull up missing females from PA, because of the map and the knowledge that he was known to have traveled there."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,TheBestVirginia,7,Sat Jul 11 05:21:54 2015 UTC,"There is actually not many more clues in there. It highlights that Mengel drove the cop's car and body 2kms away to dump them there... how odd?  The other info is that his brother owned a house very close to where the little girl (Antonella) used to live, and her remains were found on the road he would take to go hunting. So that made the investigators think he would be the one that killed her."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,Badger_Silverado,7,Sat Jul 11 08:04:44 2015 UTC,"Just when I think I'm familiar with most cases like this in the US, another one comes up.  Yikes.  He's a scary looking guy, too.  The girls' photos...have they suggested what time frame they might be from?  The black and white isn't helping.  They could be anywhere from mid 70s to mid 80s, and if in color then the makeup could provide a little more of a clue.  The curlier, ""bigger"" hair is more mid-80s.  I'm wondering if they were originally found as color photos?  But if they are senior class type photos, and what were found were actual prints made by the photography studio, the studio's name and copyright would be stamped or embossed on the actual photo and would be a huge clue (at least that was commonplace in the late 80s, but I don't have knowledge of whether it was done prior).  If what he had were already copies...I don't know what to make of that.  I haven't read through all the links, but do you know if any of these questions are addressed?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,TheBestVirginia,5,Thu Jul 9 22:27:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I went to Pennsylvania Missing & was surprised to see something on the front page I'd never heard of before. And something that could potentially solve some cold cases! Unfortunately, they have a short paragraph and the photo collage. Not much. Looking around online, I can't find any other pictures, just that collage. A lot of articles reference the crime spree alone with no mention of the pictures and map, which means no info on the photos. I don't know if they have a studio mark, etc.  I would really like to think that if these photos have been available to the public foe 25 years, people would recognize themselves or a classmate. The fact that so many articles don't make mention of the photos makes me wonder when they were released and if they got media attention at all."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cq5ft,Badger_Silverado,2,Thu Jul 9 22:49:20 2015 UTC,"Well if they were true ""originals""...as in what the student would end up purchasing from the photography studio to give out to friends and family...they'd have shown some type of identification as copyright property of said studio.    If investigators failed to recognize that, then they likely missed a ton of evidence because that would have been huge and only a very incompetent department would have missed it.  That leaves us with your question: what type of paper?  Was it newsprint or xerox copy paper?  This info is important.  I wonder if this evidence still exists in their possession?"

It seems far more typical for serial killers to keep trophy pictures of the victims once they have them in their control. It's strange too that no one missed them. Just from looking at the pictures, they do indeed look like posed pictures and not, say, something cut out from a newspaper. I can't remember the other serial killer who had a lot of pictures that were posted on the news and websites and it turned out that some were alive and had no idea how the guy had gotten their pictures."

The pictures in the paper were actually taken by the school for the yearbook rather than our senior pictures, and as far as I remember they didn't have a photography name on the front. Still though, backdrops and picture style can say a lot about where they were taken if a person recognizes something."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,shoggothsinthemist,11,Thu Jul 9 21:00:21 2015 UTC,That is some Jack the Ripper shit right there. Gives me the chills.   Unidentified bodies make me so sad. Was there no one who missed her? Or was she so far from home that no one made the connection? Is someone still wondering what happened to her? Ugh.   I have family in the St. Louis area. Very scary.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,shoggothsinthemist,25,Fri Jul 10 02:51:36 2015 UTC,"This is such a troubling and sad case. The link mentions not only that the uterus was removed ""as a part of extensive cutting, stabbing and mutilation"" but that her other reproductive organs were also missing. However ""there was no sign of surgical removal"" for those other parts. I feel sickened to type this - but is it possible the murderer simply stabbed her repeatedly in the abdominal area (death was caused by stab wounds to neck and torso) - and combined with the heat (she was found in July) and exposure of her organs from wounds, animal activity caused these parts to be devoured? I think this would be useful to know because it tells us much about the killer. Maybe the autopsy clarifies this.  I agree with you /u/oracle32 that she could have been drugged or intoxicated which explainsv the lack of defensive wounds. Another very disturbing possibility is she was bound and could not protect herself. I suppose binding the person would be consistent with a sexually motivated crime, and it is believed she was sexually assaulted in addition to the sexual mutilation.  She was murdered and found in 1990, is believed to be under 40 and had an upper denture plate. To me this is somewhat unusual for the time period and her age. The missing teeth suggest either struggles with poverty  or possibly drugs, yet these factors would be inconsistent with a dental plate. Yes it is possible she had a terrible fear of dentists or may have been in an accident that damaged  her teeth, but I suspect those possibilities are less likely. In America wold social assistance / welfare pay for dentures? Maybe a benefits package at work? Or does one pay out of pocket? It would be interesting to know the quality of the plate, as well as whether it could be traced. Natural and comfortable dentures can be extremely expensive to create. But perhaps there are very affordable options as well?  For those of you local to the area, is the place she was left in remote? Also, would the area be well known and easy to find for anyone, including those just passing through? Or is it a very out of the way and obscure location that indicates a local was the murderer?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,lowdiver,10,Thu Jul 9 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"The area she was left in - it's in the country but I wouldn't call it ""remote"". There are houses around there. Troy-O'Fallon road is pretty well traveled but not a major highway either. I guess a ""fairly busy back road"" might be the best way to describe it."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,videogamesdisco,9,Thu Jul 9 20:31:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the visual! I ended up on Google Maps exploring the general area. Based on the location, I would hazard a guess the murderer is familiar with the area and felt comfortable there. There are nice houses at regular intervals, and the area seems fairly well-maintained, with a semi-rural prettiness to it. So to me it seems less likely a stranger person passing through would confidently stop in the area. Someone who didn't know the area might fear a resident driving by, or encountering someone taking a night-time stroll / cigarette break / teenage mischief-making adventure. My assumption would be a person unfamiliar with the location would keep driving along backgrounds until there were no lights or houses in sight, or look for a stretch of empty highway."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,lowdiver,6,Thu Jul 9 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"I agree it is someone familiar with the area which is why it is so creepy.   My first thought when reading about the removal of reproductive organs was that perhaps this woman was pregnant and the father didn't want the baby being traced back to him. But, this was 1990 and DNA wasn't that well known. I seriously doubt at that time it would enter a person's thought process to remove a baby for that reason.  I'm assuming the autopsy/bloodwork would have tested for pregnancy hormones as well."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,Badger_Silverado,5,Thu Jul 9 21:14:42 2015 UTC,"It was already used at the time for paternity so a removal for that reason could be possible, or the killer feared she would be identified and her pregnancy would lead them to him/say he had a motive (if he was a significant other, which is most likely)"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,ThisIsntMyOldName,5,Fri Jul 10 04:46:44 2015 UTC,"I don't like the theory about the killer mutilating this chick because of a paternity issue or to cover a rape.    Here's why - if the killer were seriously interested in covering something like that, I'm tempted to assume that he'd have gone to better lengths to dispose of the body.  This doesn't disprove your theory or anything.  If he had really wanted to cover his tracks, wouldn't he maybe have rubbed off her finger prints, or knocked out her remaining teeth?    I hate to say this, but since he cut out her sexual organs, I'm leaning towards sexual thrills.  I know that's the easy solution to every homicide - sexual thrills, but I think it might explain this one.  If you need an alternative theory to that, consider that maybe her organs were removed for witchcraft purposes or something by someone from a primitive culture that maybe used them for a fertility ritual or something.  I'd guessing that it must be a lot of work to remove someone's organs unless you needed them for something.  If someone just needed to obscure her identity, incinerating her would have been a less messy way.    Thoughts?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,Sapphires13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:16:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the theory either- was just explaining the possibility shouldn't be easily dismissed under ""impossible"".

UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,kukukajoonurse,4,Tue Jul 21 06:42:57 2015 UTC,It's possible but you would think blood tests would confirm a pregnancy and that information would be available to the public to help identify her. I'm not really buying that she was pregnant.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,ThisIsntMyOldName,9,Wed Jul 15 19:00:25 2015 UTC,"I've known people under age 30 to end up with full dentures, simply because dental care is so expensive, and most insurance plans don't cover it.  Poverty is definitely a factor there.  A lot of people will have poor dental hygiene in their youth because they just don't care, and don't really think anything bad will happen.  But then years of not brushing and not visiting the dentist catch up to them, and their teeth are rotting out of their head.  Charitable programs, and medical cards will often only cover fillings and extractions, and nothing else.  When a tooth can be saved with a root canal for $700, or pulled for $100, pulling it becomes the more feasible option.  Saving a mouth of rotten teeth can cost tens of thousands of dollars, where simply getting them pulled and getting dentures will only run you a few thousand."

At one point, if you were poor and on welfare, (and you had chronic issues) they would just pay to have your teeth pulled and dentures put in.   I got dental implants at 25 because of suffering the same health affliction, and my dentist said it wasn't uncommon to see people between 50 and 70 with dentures who had had them since their early 20's, but it was remarkably uncommon to see it now."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cpabc,CuddlyCarrion,3,Fri Jul 10 12:33:10 2015 UTC,"Here's my armchair profiler thought:  If the removing of the reproductive organs was not done by animals, I would almost think it was someone that was not very fond of women.  The uterus and reproductive organs are very specifically female.    It could have been someone that refused his advances.    He could have been unable to perform and either had issues with it himself or got made fun of/laughed at?  If it was done by a person, and it was such an isolated area, it's very personal and it elicits a lot of emotion (anger/rage, you get the point).    If no one claimed her, it's very likely she could have been a prostitute.  They unfortunately are very high risk for things such as this.    And I agree with you guys, I don't think this was the only case like this.  While it was inherently messy, I don't think you start with this much damage.

Same goes for mutilating breasts or anything like that. They also don't start out doing things like this, it's an escalation thing. He has almost certainly murdered other people.   If she was pregnant and he took the time and energy to remove a fetus from her stomach, why wouldn't he remove her head and hands as well, to prevent identification.

UnresolvedMysteries,3corg5,ponponpunpun,19,Fri Jul 10 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"There was a really vuage post on the findingamy message board before it was closed that explained everything. Here's the gist:  A verified insider started posting on ws to drum up new interest in the case. A little while later the insider posted about a new lead that was discovered that lead the family to believe, with a good deal of certainty that amy was still alive, though they never explained what the lead was. The only info about the lead they gave was they no longer thought amy was involved in sex trafficking, but in some other trafficking activity.   Then a troll came along and made the thread unproductive, so a private message board was created, and all public info and posts about the case were copied to that board. The board was private in that only the insider could post.   The insider said they were still receiving messages from the troll, and one of the messages contained a piece of evidence that had never been made public (or something... the insider was vague about this). The insider thinks the troll was someone involved in amys disappearance, and was reading all of the information to see if they were close to being caught.   The insider made a post about how this was putting amy at risk, then shortly afterwards took the message board offline."
UnresolvedMysteries,3corg5,hamdinger125,7,Fri Jul 10 04:32:42 2015 UTC,Yikes. That's so creepy to think that someone involved in her disappearance would communicate with people interested in the case and who want her to be safe :(

She and a few of her followers claim anyone who questions her story is a ""troll"" who is working for the people who took Amy.  <eyeroll>  She has left Websleuths, was banned from Justice Quest, and was put on ignore on the Unsolved Mysteries board.  Then she made her own board on proboards which was shut down by the management there.  She's an attention-seeker, and I seriously doubt she actually works for the Bradleys.

Even though the insider was actually the one who first brought it up.  It's all ridiculous.
UnresolvedMysteries,3corg5,WifeAggro,5,Thu Jul 16 03:07:41 2015 UTC,"It's crazy surreal that there are thousands or even millions of families like the Bradley's in this nation waiting for an answer on their missing loved one. They wait and languish for years, decades to come.   As for Amy, that's one of my feared ways to go missing or die: fall off a ship; kidnapped in unfamiliar, international territory. The worst part is that her family was in the vicinity. Literally their vacation turned into a nightmare. It's just awful."

I hate to say it, but you can take one look at her and know that her case won't get much attention. I say that not as a conspiracy/crazy thing, but sadly it's true. Take a look at the attention the Amy Bradley case got vs. Natalee Holloway. And Amy was white too."

Isn't it far more likely she drowned, encountered a shark or met foul play at the hands of one or more of the people she was with?"

Maybe she was dead from the start, maybe she is alive now, maybe she was alive and is now dead. I'm not too familiar with this case, so I'm not sure but saying she went overboard is perhaps too easy of a conclusion to make. Regardless, I believe there are CCTV cameras on the decks of ships that would have recorded someone going overboard."
UnresolvedMysteries,3corg5,TrackmarksTrademarks,8,Thu Jul 9 19:47:23 2015 UTC,Too easy?  People fall off cruise ships ALL the time without being it being caught on camera.  She also disappeared before the ship docked.  I'd hardly say it's an improbable conclusion to reach.

UnresolvedMysteries,3corg5,bsmith7028,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:06:04 2015 UTC,Well I did suggest she could have been attacked that led to her going overboard :)

Not only that, I believe they recounted this sighting under oath while testifying in the trial where the Bradley's sued the cruise company.  I see no reason for why those two girls would commit perjury.  To me, this is the most important thing in the Amy Bradley case.  It would suggest she did not fall overboard and there was, in fact, some kind of abduction.  This isn't a vague, unverified sighting.  It was recounted in open court.    Of course it's possible they saw another woman who looked like Amy."
UnresolvedMysteries,3corg5,ponponpunpun,0,Fri Jul 10 04:17:10 2015 UTC,"People report ""sightings"" all the time of persons involved in unresolved mysteries on reddit alone..

I remember my first year or so of college I constantly thought I was seeing various people from high school around campus.  But they always ended up just being some look alike stranger."
UnresolvedMysteries,3corg5,threestardot,3,Fri Jul 10 13:02:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but why were the photos of ""Jas"" on the Brothel site removed as soon as people asked questions about Amy? They didn't specifically ask about ""Jas"" they asked if they'd seen Amy Bradley and if they could search the brothels for her. To me that seals it on Jas being her, and the elusive ""them"" having her.   Equally the WebSleuths' insider who was being trolled was very disturbed by whatever the troll had a hold of. Either new evidence or something only the abductor would know. In my honest opinion the sightings + this makes abduction much, much more likely. The FBI don't think she fell overboard either (""it's unlikely, given the evidence"") and beaware that we don't have anything close to all the evidence, so the FBI may know her path off of the ship and have just never released it because it doesn't help. A lot to consider, if it wasn't for everything else, I'd say yeah she fell overboard but there's too much suggesting she didn't."

I've been on more than 10 cruises and  I honestly don't remember CCTV anywhere but the casino and maybe the on-board stores. We've always had balcony rooms and I've never seen any cameras.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cot86,Yell99,22,Thu Jul 9 15:58:20 2015 UTC,"http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-12/news/vw-2459_1_royal-family   Full article is 3 pages, some excerpts below.   The princess of the long-extinct Indian kingdom of Oudh [the woman who eventually committed suicide] is having a very bad first year [1986] in her new ""palace."" It is a 600-year-old, crumbling stone monument called Malcha Mahal that has no water, no electricity and hundreds of bats.  The woman's children say Her Highness deserves much better, and that the government of India should be ashamed for giving her a home in such disgusting condition. To make sure a visitor understands how unhappy they all are, the royal family's 24-year-old son, Prince Ali Raza, orders a servant to jab a stick toward the ceiling in the dungeon-like main room. Bats flap and screech in all directions, leaving their droppings on the Oriental carpet.  ""How can we live like this?"" asked the prince.  Princess Wiayat Mahal, officially known as the begum of the Royal House of Oudh (pronounced ow-wud ), has for years been one of the more bizarre characters of India. In New Delhi, people call her the begum , a title for a Muslim woman of high rank. As far from regal as her surroundings are now, they are considerably better than where she was before. For a decade, up until she was finally evicted in May [1986], she lived with her children and a dozen snarling dogs in the New Delhi train station. Her purpose there was to shame the government of India into returning her ancestral property, which she said--and historians agree--was illegally seized when the British deposed her great-grandfather, the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, more than a century ago.  She particularly is seeking the return of the family palace in Lucknow, currently used as a pharmaceutical research center. According to news reports, it is decaying. Other family property is used by the government for libraries, courts and picture galleries.  The begum may be an eccentric case, but she is not entirely alone in her reduced circumstances. Many of India's great princely families, whose kingdoms made up a third of the country at the time of independence in 1947, have today lost all of the power and most of the wealth they once enjoyed. They used to receive government stipends, but these were withdrawn in 1971 because of political pressure on then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Still, the families have always been permitted to keep their ancestral homes, even if that meant turning them into hotels to pay for the upkeep.   ....   It was no less than Gandhi who, after being told about the begum during a visit to the train station in 1984, ordered the then-home minister to find the woman a more suitable residence. A site selection team was sent out to inspect possible homes. Malcha Mahal ( mahal means palace) was one of the few suggested that wasn't in ruins.  But now that Gandhi is dead, assassinated Oct. 31, 1984, nobody in the government is certain that the begum was even given Malcha Mahal. The former home minister said nothing was ever decided, and his successors don't know where to find the file.   ...   [T]he state of Uttar Pradesh offered her a modern home but she refused, saying that she wanted only what was rightfully hers, her ancestral property. ""Why, even my dogs wouldn't live in that,"" she said of the government's offer.  Finally, a new station manager who took over in 1985 said he threatened to shoot the begum's dogs and told her he would physically remove her if she didn't leave.  By this time, the Home Ministry had apparently told her that Malcha Mahal was under consideration for her new home, but that it needed extensive repairs. The begum does have a photocopy of a letter indicating as much. Armed with it, she fled the train station and moved in. Needless to say, the government repairmen have not yet materialized.   She chose to live in a train station with her children, and dogs, for about a decade. Also in the article her son says they'd rather be dead than working a job (""The House of Oudh does not appreciate trade, business and politics,"" said the prince. ""It is better to be in the grip of death rather than in the grip of a job.""). So they'd rather squat in a train station and shame the government into giving back their property. Now that they have some property, they'd rather live in a decaying ruin with bats than work. Those two had one screwed-up childhood."

The case was thoroughly investigated by the FBI, etc. and I really doubt an entire flight crew could manage to keep something like that under wraps and conceal;ed from the investigators.  You have to remember, back when this happened, in 1971, airport security was not what it is today...in fact it was almost non-existent, when compared to what we know now. Pulling off such a heist would have been relatively easy given the fact there was no ID checks for in-country flights then, few security cameras, tickets could be bought with any name, no ID and with cash....all of that made tracking ""DB Cooper"" extremely difficult.   Also, what about the $5,000 USD which was found by a riverbank, buried, in early 1980? Serial numbers on the bills proved they came from DB Cooper's haul, though the rest was never recovered...forensic testing of these bank notes proved they had washed to the riverbank and had not been deliberately buried there.  The only other evidence ever found was a sign from the airplane's back hatch door, which was blown off when he opened it mid-flight to parachute out--though that was not found until 1978, by deer hunters. That's about it...not even the parachute was found."

He died, and if only part of the money was found in the lake, it's because the rest was given to the staff.  However, I don't know why they would not have came forward (so yeah, maybe your theory is right after all, that they where in on it...Makes more sense). They never used the money, thought, as it would have been caught since they were all registered (the state had written down the serial numbers of each bill). Maybe they all waited for things to calm down, as to not be suspicious, before using the money, but the heard about the serial number thing and decided to NOT ever user the money, as it would have gotten them all caught."

I can't think of any aspect of the case which requires the invocation of any sort of supernatural/paranormal force to explain it, honestly. There's always a simpler, mundane explanation.  Even if we can't say that such a thing was definitely the cause, it fits as a potential cause and doesn't require making things up.

I doubt there's anything supernatural going on in most cases, but I also think we don't know everything, and it's fun to speculate. Here are a few of my favorites. Not all of them have ""supernatural"" elements, and they may not be what you're looking for, but I think all of them invite speculation and are good and spooky:   The Cash-Landrum Incident: Maybe my favorite UFO story. Was it a secret Soviet aircraft? A secret U.S. aircraft? Aliens? All three options are pretty scary, if you ask me.  The Beast of Gavaudan: Man-eating beast that terrorized the French countryside in the 1700s. Exactly what it was is lost to history. There's an excellent episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class about it, as well.  Mothman: A personal favorite since I was a little kid. I think these people saw something terrifying, but it's very unclear what it was, and I don't think the explanations they've come up with for it are super convincing. I also recommend the documentary Eyes of the Mothman, which is on Netflix.  Who Put Bella in the Wych Elm?: That phrase alone gives me shivers.  Villisca Axe Murders: Again, nothing really supernatural here, but there's a lot of little details in the crime that are strange and haunting. Stuff You Missed in History Class covered this, as well.  The Toynbee Tiles: I'd say this one is solved, based on the documentary Resurrect Dead, which is pretty great if you haven't seen it, but the saga surrounding them is bizarre and interesting.  Denver International Airport: Is DIA a secret base for the the Illuminati? Probs not. Though I'll buy that it might be a secret bunker for continuance of government in case of a terrible disaster (like the one that was built at the Greenbriar Hotel in West Virgina during the Cold War). Enjoy falling down the rabbithole of crazy!  Oh, and regarding Dyatlov Pass, which is also a mystery I enjoy a lot, read Dead Mountain by Donnie Eichar. His is the best explanation I've heard.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Geno_Breaker,3,Fri Jul 10 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, but to do it you'd need access to the cockpit and the knowledge of exactly how to do it on this exact model of plane.  Knowledge alone won't cut it, they'd have to overpower the pilots and later have to steer the plane on its final course.  A pilot wouldn't have the issue of overcoming the cockpit, except to lock the other one out or incapacitate him.  The combination of all factors makes it more likely to have been either of the two persons already in the cockpit.  Not saying it couldn't have been a different scenario, but most likely.  I'd like to pose your assumption to others: your theory, if I have this right, is that someone on that plane other than the pilots (everyone has been closely investigated, none were found to have the existing experience to do these things) gained this info via internet searches.    Any readers here who are good internet searchers, can you search online to discover how to perform every deliberate action that we think occurred mechanically (including use of autopilot, disengaging tracking systems, changing path of flight)?  And then with this info, provide a detailed explanation of how you could breach the cockpit, overcome the pilots, initiate the actions discussed, and get the plane into an autopilot end path that lasts seven hours?   I'm going to leave out the more questionable actions, and keep it to what is generally understood as fact.  While I suppose it's theoretically possible, it is not nearly as probable as this having been committed by one of the two pilots."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Cooper0302,32,Fri Jul 10 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with your analysis and comparisons. To be honest, all we can do is theorize. The rogue pilot theory has always made most sense to me. (Locking the co-pilot out of the cockpit, altering course towards the Indian ocean, disabling tracking, depressurizing cabin to incapacitate panicked passengers, etc). However, the reason I sided with this theory was because I was under the impression the pilot's wife had left him and taken their kids a few days before hand (I read this in a news article that now I realize to have been bogus). The report, which has since been released, finds no reason to believe either pilot to have been in any compromised mental state. Now I don't know what to believe. To me it has always seemed deliberate.   Edit: incapacitate"

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,pantspants,45,Wed Jul 8 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"I really like your theory. The circumstances are remarkably similar to those surrounding Helios 522. The only question that I have (I know very little about aviation, so bear with me!), is: Would MH370 have had some sort of Dead Man's Switch or something? If the pilot and copilot became incapacitated, would there have been some sort of warning system in place? I.E, if a person's weight is removed from the seat of a lawn tractor, the engine cuts off?  Previously, I leaned towards a suicide theory for MH370, but there doesn't really seem to be a lot of supporting evidence for that. I suppose it could have been someone besides the pilots, maybe a member of the flight crew, but I think there would have been some sort of Mayday call."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,pantspants,41,Wed Jul 8 20:38:19 2015 UTC,"It is similar to Helios except for a very important couple of facts. Once it went quiet it made several very pronounced turns over a prolonged time period. Not the sort of thing an incapacitated crew could do, nor turns due to bad weather conditions."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Cooper0302,39,Wed Jul 8 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"We cannot know for certain what happened until the aircraft is finally (if ever) recovered.  But, it is possible that the the the ""suspicious"" turns were a result of the plane flying without the autopilot being turned on. http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/16/opinion/palmer-malaysia-flight-370/   With the autopilot off, the airplane will adjust the pitch (the up or down movement of the nose of the plane) to maintain a speed set by the pilot. It will pitch up if it's going faster than the desired speed and pitch down if slower. This is called pitch trim. Anyone who has flown even a small aircraft will be familiar with this concept. Therefore, when disturbed, it will fly a series of pitch changes as it settles down on the trimmed airspeed.  Pitch protections built into the system ensure that the airplane never goes too fast or too slow. Temporary input on the control wheel, or changes in the airplane's weight as it burns off fuel, temperature and other normal atmospheric changes along the course can initiate the altitude changes as the airplane continues to seek its trimmed speed.  Heading changes are also what I would expect to see in an autopilot-off situation. The 777's fly-by-wire roll control law controls the tilt of the wings. The airplane would be subject to atmospheric disturbances that could act to tip a wing up every now and then, but built-in protections prevent the plane from exceeding bank angles in excess of 35°. While a conventional airplane would tend to spiral down in that situation, the 777 incorporates automatic pitch compensation, so the airplane could easily hold its altitude in these turns.  The fly-by-wire control system on the 777 makes it a very stable airplane, capable of flying for hours with the autopilot off without crashing."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,TheOnlyOtherRedditor,4,Thu Jul 9 06:35:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you're wrong, but I think the safest conclusion from the INMARSAT data is that the plane crossed certain arcs at certain times.   How it got from arc to arc in the time between pings is still a mystery."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Eddie_Hitler,5,Thu Jul 9 15:37:44 2015 UTC,"But we do have the military radar tracks from when the plane travelled across Malaysia that are more accurate, and they suggest an aircraft following set flight paths."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,guth86,7,Thu Jul 9 16:11:33 2015 UTC,No because whether and atmospheric conditions change all the time.

In addition, with the autopilot functioning like it should, there's not necessarily going to be a reason for pilots to do anything in the middle parts of the flight. They'll monitor instruments and talk to air traffic control, but they won't jiggle the handle.  Now, that said, the Helios flight and MH370 were both equipped with alarms that would have sounded (and did sound, in Helios' case) when something happened to the pressurisation. The trouble there, though, is that, by the time it starts sounding, it's entirely possible that hypoxia has already started to set in, and the pilots won't necessarily respond like they should. Plus, if there was a fire, that alarm could have been interpreted as a false alarm, or been lost in the confusion."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,jg1459,8,Wed Jul 8 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess the alarm would kind of be like having a carbon monoxide alarm in your house--you might realize that it is going off, but it is too late to do anything about it.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,bwana_singsong,6,Wed Jul 8 20:52:22 2015 UTC,"The masks are dropped when the pilots decide they are (it can be beneficial in a fire, for example, to not drop masks despite a lack of oxygen). Pilots have to decide to use oxygen in the cockpit."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,jg1459,2,Wed Jul 8 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"Only the oxygen masks in the cabin automatically drop when a pressure decline is detected, the pilot masks are stowed away and must be taken out by the pilots. This is one of the reasons the Helios crew did not realize there was a pressurization problem, but also it was that the pressurization alarm sounded similar (or was coming from) the same alarm as the take off configuration system, so they thought it was a problem with that and not the pressurization."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,bwana_singsong,7,Thu Jul 9 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"The Air Crash a Emergency episode on this case does provide some specifics of how the plane could be de pressurized and that technically, the captain could choose to depressurize and opt to not lower the masks for the cabin but wear one himself in order to get the plane on the course of his preference without any fight from passengers or crew, then could have eventually taken his own mask off (this works if homicide-suicide is the scenario).  Another interesting point they made was that while many tracking mechanisms had likely been intentionally disengaged, the automatic ""handshakes"" that the plane made with the satellite system (which is the only way we even know it flew for over seven hours) were, according to the owner of the satellite company, not something that an average pilot would know to exist nor could disengage.  Really interesting episode,mid you haven't seen it please watch it.  Free on YouTube."

In the 777 apparently it's in the back of the plane, and it's likely whoever did it didn't want to walk through rows and rows of people they just murdered."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Elgin_McQueen,2,Thu Jul 9 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"One of the main reasons behind the Helios crash was that the cabin pressure warning came from the same source as the take off configuration warning, so it was not that the alarm came on too late, but that the pilots misinterpreted the problem as something else."

I've never worked on planes before but I've worked on passenger carrying ferries and trains and as far as my knowledge is concerned there's always a dead man switch. I can't say for certain they're in planes but I would be very surprised (and horrified) if they weren't. It's not necessarily in the seat. It's usually built into all the controls and if the controller hasn't touched anything (a throttle/gauge/button whatever) in 15-30 seconds an alarm will sound. In the case of trains, if the driver doesn't respond to the alarm after another 30 seconds the brakes will automatically be applied. I don't know what the equivalent could be in a plane but surely there would be something."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,rythmik1,15,Thu Jul 9 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry, this isn't a thing for planes.  There was a case a few years ago where both pilots were fucking around with their laptops and they flew at least an hour past their destination, completely oblivious.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,TheBestVirginia,9,Thu Jul 9 05:55:53 2015 UTC,"Just a small side note and ""holy shit!"" if you read up on that Helios flight in Wikipedia.. this is the most chilling part to me, that this attendant was just watching from the cockpit at the end and waved to the fighter jets before going down. And also, I think, points to a reason why, even though your idea that this may have happened to MH370, I think it's at least a bit unlikely as it took the pilots to make multiple simple mistakes, ignoring warnings and alerts, plus the turn. But I got nothing better!    At 11:49, flight attendant Andreas Prodromou entered the cockpit and sat down in the captain's seat, having remained conscious by using a portable oxygen supply.[22][23] Prodromou held a UK Commercial Pilot License,[24] but was not qualified to fly the Boeing 737. Crash investigators concluded that Prodromou's experience was insufficient for him to gain control of the aircraft under the circumstances.[23] Prodromou waved at the F16s very briefly. Although he established contact with the fighter pilots, he wasn't able to do anything. The plane was helpless. There was nothing left for the F16s to do."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,TheBestVirginia,21,Fri Jul 10 03:04:17 2015 UTC,"I'm still on the pilot suicide train, and Germanwings solidified my beliefs.    The trouble here, though, is that turn as the plane left Malaysian airspace. A plane that fails to pressurise would keep flying on a set path, which would mean going towards Beijing. Why the turn? Who turned the plane?   This is the reason why depressurization is less likely than other possibilities. The plane made a turn in the opposite direction immediately after last radio contact in clear conditions. Additionally, it does not appear that the pilot speaking with ATC was impaired due to hypoxia at the time.   I believe that fire is unlikely for the same reason. I highly doubt a fire would destroy communications and transponder, but not controls or compromise the plane's structural integrity.   To me, the most logical explanation is that Shah locked the co-pilot out and then depressurized the cabin, flying the aircraft to as remote a location as possible to make the search difficult."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,foxh8er,10,Wed Jul 8 23:32:05 2015 UTC,What about Shah gives you the impression that he would do that?
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,TheBestVirginia,9,Wed Jul 8 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"Weren't there some financial troubles reported? Nothing about mental health though, nothing on the scale of the Germanwings pilot certainly.  Still it's one of the only theories that doesn't have any obvious flaws in it, along with the hijacking gone wrong (somewhat discredited by the pilots not using the silent alarms available to them).  The obvious flaws in the depressurization theory are that someone had manually disabled the various transponders and that the plane was being maneuvered after that."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Lucairian,2,Thu Jul 9 07:43:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I don't think there's enough evidence to suggest Shah is guilty of mass murder. Rather we can conclusively say that someone did it, but shouldn't blame a single person."

Per experts (see the Air Crash Emergency recent episode on this case), fire is essentially ruled out because the plane is known to have remained flying for seven hours.  Any fire bad enough to damage systems enough to knock out the transponder, etc, and be so overwhelming as to not allow for a mayday call, would be too extreme for the plane to continue flight for that long of a period."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,barto5,15,Thu Jul 9 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"That the pilot disengaged tracking devices (but not the satellite handshakes as he wouldn't have known how or that they even existed), and as the co pilot left the cockpit for some normal reason, locked him out.  Intentionally depressurized the cabin without releasing the oxygen masks, but used his own to get the plane in his chosen path.  At some point he took his off and let the plane go on autopilot while everyone lost consciousness.  I feel like the episode didn't just jump on this theory from the get go.  They really did cover other options and had various experts rule things in or out."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,moneyonfire,32,Thu Jul 9 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"I think the part of the MH370 story that never got cleared up was why did the Malaysian government mislead the investigation for so long? Are we forgetting they changed their story and knew of a direction the plane headed in that was contrary to what search partners including Australia were told? They refused to give up the cargo manifest, their story changed so many times and they failed to act appropriately after the plane supposedly went missing. The lack of effort on their part to try and contact the plane or ask other planes in the area to try and communicate with the plane, nor any attempt to scramble jets to the last known communication area, it all just points to something suspicious in my opinion.  We all accepted the rogue pilot theory when it was obvious the plane was not going to be found because it was the only reason we could think of, lack of wreckage or actual motive leaves very little in the evidence pool to pick from to establish a motive. But isn't this just the most convenient reason? Why were Malaysia so reluctant to not cooperate with the right information from the get-go? Were they protecting someone or did it perhaps to give them time to cover up a mistake they possibly made?  If you want to read a pretty insightful look into the story, including Malaysia's shady behaviour including the changing of story and making Australia switch up search locations every time they thought they might be onto something, read this article.  Until we actually find the plane or evidence to suggest a stronger motive, we don't know what happened to the plane."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Eddie_Hitler,9,Thu Jul 9 05:58:30 2015 UTC,"I think Malaysia's poor handling of the incident is explained by their general incompetence.   Immediately after the plane went missing, I remember reading accounts from a handful of Malaysian redditors saying they were withholding all this info and doing the wrong things because they had mishandled the first 6-8 hours so poorly and they didn't want the world to know how bad it was.  That makes sense to me. But who frikking knows."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,TheBestVirginia,90,Thu Jul 9 18:46:44 2015 UTC,I believe the pilot done it on purpose. Your theory about the Helios flight does not explain how all transmitters where disabled and the aircraft made several maneuvers long after.   This is what I think happened    Pilot Locks his co-pilot out the cabin  Disables all transmitters and communication. Turns plane around Sends the flight to a high altitude and enables cabin decompression. Puts on his oxygen mask while rest of the crew gets knocked out by lack of oxygen. Descends to a lower altitude and removes oxygen mask  Flys round the island he grew up on for some emotional reason.    8.Then heads south knowing the plane will be very difficult to find once it crashes.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,waffenwolf,15,Sat Jul 11 18:15:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this.

Basically, it should be immediately apparent what happened before even examining the rest of the wreckage.  The cockpit voice recorder might not have anything interesting, if the crew was incapacitated or dead for the final two hours of the flight. If something intentional happened and someone was alive for the final two hours of the flight, it may or may not help us figure out why this happened."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Mgregg85,29,Fri Jul 10 00:17:30 2015 UTC,Pretty sure there is only like 10 minutes of oxygen. Those masks are to get you to a safe altitude

But I know 100% the pilots have a much longer emergency supply of oxygen in their masks as its down to them to get out the emergency situation.

It is a big flat can the size of a flask that you rip the top off and the chemicals inside mix and start generating oxygen.  We would hook them up to a device that I cannot remember the name of but was essentially an atmosphere pack for fireman.  This was done because venting on a sub can be difficult, so bad atmo can stay around a while and we did not want to take up room with big compressed air bottles.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,dodgamnbonofasitch,13,Wed Jul 8 22:42:21 2015 UTC,I don't think this is the case. However pilots have an oxygen cylinder each that can last quite a while. The oxygen generators in the passenger cabin work on a chemical reaction and last only around 12 minutes per unit.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,dlogan3344,7,Wed Jul 8 23:00:58 2015 UTC,I would have thought so if the security door remained sealed. Also consider if the pilot locked himself in he can consume the co pilots emergency oxygen after his is depleted
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,waffenwolf,3,Wed Jul 8 22:50:55 2015 UTC,The security door can't cope with the pressure differential that would be produced. The pilots just have oxygen masks. Scary-looking oxygen masks.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,dlogan3344,8,Thu Jul 9 09:16:59 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. The entire aircraft is pressurised from the same source - the engines.  The cockpit crew have access to more emergency oxygen however, and the pilots oxygen masks are also effective against smoke as they cover the whole face.  In the cabin there is only oxygen available via the masks for 10 to 15 minutes, which is plenty of time for what the mask system is designed to do ie maintain consciousness in the event of decompression long enough for the aircraft to reach a lower altitude."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,waffenwolf,2,Thu Jul 9 03:46:52 2015 UTC,"Can confirm this is incorrect.  Entire fuselage pressured the same way, including the cargo areas."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,dlogan3344,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:55:11 2015 UTC,It is. I want to say the flight crew has something like an hour available to them.   Edit: I believe the cockpit and cabin are pressurized together. But flight crew have bigger oxygen tanks.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,waffenwolf,9,Thu Jul 9 18:49:09 2015 UTC,The passengers have 10-15 minutes oxygen yes. But the pilot cabins have a much longer emergency oxygen supply. The main pilot also would have had access to the co-pilots supply giving him a fair length of time.   Also with the security door sealed off would the pilots cabin be effected at all? Boeing 777 might be designed so that the pilots cabin has a separate air intake
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,dlogan3344,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:44:56 2015 UTC,I would imagine the masks would drop regardless if the cabin was pressurized. Cockpit doors open up outward right?

They are not even sure where it is, off of Indonesia, off of Australia, even though a crew reported hearing the blackbox off of Australia nothing has ever been found. How can you be so sure this plane flew there? Just because he played with a simulator? Why would he fly over his home island before suicide? Why would the other crew not respond? You start getting into complex problems trying to claim that he was able to climb and suffocate the others yet remain alert and unaffected in what was probably a fight. The simplest answer is usually the true answer, a fire makes more sense. I grant, yes it could be caused by other things like your theory, but it honestly just does not seem likely.

The pings never gave a gps location, nor really any information that would say much, other than how the engines were performing. The biggest thing with fire is suffocation, not burning to death, when you are in an enclosed space like this. Yes, sometimes uncontrolled planes either climb and stall into a freefall, or just dive into the earth, but they also just fly around as well. Again, if there was a fire, then the pilots would have taken off cruise control and tried to return to the ground as soon as possible. An electrical fire could have taken out the radios, locators, everything, probably even most of their ability to fly the thing fairly quickly. I just hope you see my point of view, that it very well could have been an accident and not foul play. That is what makes it more of a mystery, what did really happen to it?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Grubbyplank,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:02:09 2015 UTC,"A fire can cause the transponders to malfunction   That's the problem with fire theory - the engine transponder was in working order. If a fire would have taken it out, the manufacturer couldn't have contacted it, but they could. It was just set to not transmit."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,thatssomething,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:50:19 2015 UTC,"Fly, navigate, communicate.  Pilots do this in that order.  If a fire started and one of the pilots decided to try to put out the fires in the EE Bay, the other pilot may have only had time to fly and enter autopilot coordinates into the navigation before passing out.  The first pilot passes out, and you are left with a plane full of smoke and on autopilot.  One it reaches the destination it might continue to fly in that direction."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,TheOnlyOtherRedditor,2,Thu Jul 9 18:21:15 2015 UTC,Still does not explain.   How where transmitters disabled? cant argue the fire done it because satellite ping's where still being made.  How did the aircraft remain intact all the way down to the southern indian ocean without burning out and exploding? The pilots could easily put on their oxygen masks that would be the first thing they would do if smoke enters the cabin why didn't they? No distress signal or mayday. Why?    It don't add up

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,happilythree,6,Thu Jul 9 00:27:04 2015 UTC,Just a gut feeling based on the coincidental timing of the loss of contact. I've read every theory on the Internet and still just can't come up with a more decisive reasoning.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Malaria_AIDS,11,Thu Jul 9 19:04:32 2015 UTC,The hardest thing for me to believe about it being a purposeful descent due to pilot suicide is how much time that would leave for second thoughts and intervention from others on the flight. I think pilot suicide via decompression and autopilot is really the most reasonable answer.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,throwaway_thyroid,8,Thu Jul 9 00:40:22 2015 UTC,"When Air Crash Emergency reenacted different scenarios in their recent episode on this, the saddest part was recreating how things would have been for the passengers if the captain did lock out his copilot and didn't depressurize the cabin.  The thought of these people having six or seven full hours of fear and despair really hit me.  If he did that on purpose, he is quite the sadist as well as homicidal and suicidal.  I believe that he used lack of oxygen to incapacitate them while using his pilot mask to get the plane on his desired course.  At least I hope so, as it would have been the least horrific for the passengers."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Lucairian,7,Thu Jul 9 03:01:16 2015 UTC,When the communications stopped and the turns made before going out into the Indian Ocean make it seem to me that whoever was in control knew how to evade tracking on the ground. That makes it seem like it was deliberate action. Even if the plane is found we will probably never find out what actually happened since the voice recorder only records two hours. My crazy conspiracy theory is that the plane was hacked and someone not on the plane took control of it and crashed it in the ocean. I have nothing to back that up but nothing really makes sense with mh370.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Cooper0302,7,Wed Jul 8 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"This is possible I guess, but if someone not on the plane did this, wouldn't they try to take credit for it like in a terrorist attack?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,feraltarte,6,Wed Jul 8 21:24:22 2015 UTC,Maybe they hadn't intended for it to crash in the ocean and whoever is responsible didn't want to admit their failure or maybe the goal is for it to disappear? Or it could have been a test for future actions? Sadly no one really knows what happened and all we can do is speculate.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,TheOnlyOtherRedditor,5,Wed Jul 8 21:41:43 2015 UTC,If this is a hacking incident I would believe that loss of life was never a intention - more like someone was trying to prove it was possible to take control and disable communications and flight commands. The responses of the crew might have prevented a hacker from releasing control back to the cockpit.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cl8ap,Cooper0302,2,Thu Jul 9 14:02:07 2015 UTC,"Nobody is stupid enough to test this on a live, commercial flight loaded with passengers.

What distinguishes MH370 from the other cases is that the pilot tried to cover up the fact that he was a mass murderer in order to preserve his family's honour and so that his spouse would receive a life insurance payout or other benefits.  He was clearly successful in that as it's extremely unlikely that we'll ever find the blackbox, which is the only thing that might conclusively resolve this mystery. ""It is not an exaggeration, then, to say that the search for MH370 – the black box at least – is not just like finding a needle in a haystack, it’s a billion times harder than that.""

I can picture the news footage in my head, but not the details. It was a massive breach but the plane held together and was controllable.   Also pretty sure Mythbusters covered explosive decompression in an episode and concluded it was the stuff of movies. So perhaps a minor breach happened in the cockpit causing incapacitated crew, extinguishing the flare fire and the wandering flight path. The crew did crazy inputs thinking they were doing the right thing but were suffering the effects of hypoxia."

As the pilots fell unconscious, one of them disabled the autopilot, causing the plane to drift until it eventually ran out of fuel (although I like your possibility that the pilots were searching for a runway to land on).

Personally i think Malcolm and Warhol are too of the worst things to happen to culture in a long time, they're the very icons of and spiritual grandfathers to this notion that of art as a industry - where dada said all art was false they instead of embracing free expression and new paradigms just rubbed their hands together and decide to try and swindle an easy million... To them the realisation that art and culture was a spectacle simply gave them an excuse to push easy shit and hype it as much as possible with all the psychological trickery of counter-culture and cool - Warhol's shitty screenprints of everyday items became popular through the hype machine of celeb-culture, fame-hawking and media-manipulation; really though their attraction was a tacit covenant with the artist to keep things hip and safely detached - people wanted something to invest in but art is complex, what if you get something that other people with more advanced opinions don't like? how would you show off then?! Warhol came with a narrative, with a selection of hip celebrity endorsements - if someone from the old and established art world didn't like it then you could turn your nose up at them and sneer, 'don't you get it? it's very cool, Mick Jagger has one of his prints...' in the case of Warhol the celebrity status was much more important than the art, hence why today even people that know nothing about art know you're suppose to like warhol...    So the Pistols were exactly this, Malc decided to get some drug addicted rentboys and get them into the news as 'a sensation' this meant they had to be as extreme and shocking as possible, he dressed then up to look scary, fuelled their drug habits and fed their egos all the while egging them onto more and more into self-destructive modes of existence - telling them that being seen fucked up would be good for their image, telling them to make a show of their emotional problems by being unpredictable, by cutting themselves, getting crazy tats and anything else anyone could think of...    This was his fun little art project, of course it didn't matter to him that he was fucking up human lives because he's a massive egomaniac - as far as he was concerned anyone he ordains to interfere with is blessed by the holy light of his genius, the only thing he cares about in the world is himself thus whatever damage his games might do to to people directly or at large simply didn't concern him, or possibly amused and enthralled him. Personally i think he has that supervillion mentality of enjoying the power he had over people, enjoying his position in society and his ability to fuck with people, lead them down self-destructive paths and etc...    Well anyway, they did make some nice songs but nothing compared to the rest of the punk movement and they did inspire lots of much better and realer people - anyway, the point is Malcolm's a twat and his management style was deranged. For example 'I tried having her kidnapped in London'   Malcolm McLaren had Sid Vicious killed because he was exceptionally worried when it went to court not only would he be implicated in the supply of drugs but also other potentially career threatening revelations would come to light...   Who killed Nancy? probably sid, she probably woke him from his sleep and he went nuts killed her then took some more and went to bed - he was totally fucked up, like in every way fucked up. Maybe someone else did, though - maybe Malcolm paid someone to get rid of her because he was worried she was going to split up the band and ruin everything like Yoko... maybe he was just getting pissed off at rotten for some reason and thought it'd be good for the band."

Many times have i left a friend asleep somewhere only to return to discover they've got up and wondered somewhere or caused some disaster and many times myself in my youth i've been bollocksed on a handfull of something or other and a few lines of something that doesn't taste like anything should and slept face down in a ditch until being woken by something, rampaging to another quiet spot and falling again face down.  It's generally considered a good idea to pass out face down, that way the sick doesn't kill you so easily.     A close friend of mine once did a load of rohypnol so he could sleep after a day long coke bender but after an hour or so someone came and violently shook him shouting his name until he awoke - this made him fly into a rage where he bodily threw the geezer out the door, slammed it shut, punched a few holes in it then went back to bed only to wake up and wonder who'd fucked up his door.   The fact is rotten was addicted to blues, speed [english speed which is amphetamine sulphate], racket, and any tinklers [prescription drugs] he could get his hands on -- when you life this kind of life it's a constant upwards elevator of line after line until so wired the only possible way of snatching some sleep and fixing your head is to get heavy into rohypnol [as kate moss prefers] or heroin [as most poorer users prefer], if those aren't working then a handful of under-the-counter sleepers might just bosh you over for a while.    The likely chain of events is likely that he dosed up and flopped out, she went nuts screwing for a fix and harassed him until he was awake at which point he flipped out, stabbed her, rammed her into the cupboard and went back to sleep.    Yes a normal person taking a few sleeping pills will sleep, a normal person jacked up on smack will normally go to sleep at some point - a raving cainer whose mental balances were fucked up even before he developed an absolutely huge drink and drug problem? that person does not have the same biochemistry as regular folk, you can't tell what effect stimulus is going to have on any region of his body or brain because all the levels are already totally fucked up - taking more than one prescription medicine at a time can cause confusing and unexpected results, with someone living on nothing but madness and illicit highs pretty much all bets are off."

There's been discussion from others besides him that there was a Michael running around that night, who no one has ever been able to identify. Sadly, I lost my metaphorical balls and have never been able to bring myself to ask Howie what he REALLY thinks (he's done a ton of interviews about it, but ....)"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cng38,calexxia,4,Thu Jul 9 07:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it was the unidentified Micheal, not the actor who called himself Micheal that also lived there.   By Howie, do you mean Howie Pyro? Do you know him?"

He had dated Lydia Lunch for a few years, so he knew all of these NYC characters, like Rockets. Gene was/is a lot of things, but he was at his best an excellent judge of character and could dissect the most complicated people down to their bone marrow with stunning precision.

I'm sure others have as well.  Fun fact: as they were taking Sids' ashes through Heathrow, whoever was carrying them tripped and the ashes went everywhere.. You can probably still breath a litlle of Sid as you go through"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cng38,Fading_Giant,3,Thu Jul 9 13:36:42 2015 UTC,According to his wiki page his ashes were scattered over Nancy's grave.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cng38,ttho10,3,Thu Jul 9 17:43:34 2015 UTC,"depends  I also found this VERY interesting bit at the end of that article, which i had never seen before.  Rotten always thought Sid was killed, but never follwed up on it. Seems he MAY have been right:  ""Just before her own death in 1996, Vicious's mother, Anne Ritchie Beverly, confessed that she had deliberately injected her son that evening with a lethal dose, because she wanted to spare him from going to prison for the death of Spungen."""
UnresolvedMysteries,3cng38,Maccas75,2,Thu Jul 9 18:26:44 2015 UTC,"HAH! His mom sounds like a real nutter, and I wouldn't doubt she had deliberately killed Sid. I also am not sure that that Sid killed Nancy."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cng38,Fading_Giant,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:13:00 2015 UTC,Not surprised by that at all.  His mother used to smuggle drugs via her vagina while Sid was a kid.  She was perhaps not exactly the best mother.

A lot of people also forget that Sid was just 21 when he died, while Nancy was just 20.  These were basically kids which just makes the whole thing that more tragic - the ""27 club"" had like 6-7 years on these poor guys."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cng38,bedpan3,6,Mon Jul 13 16:16:57 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I believe the thin, blonde drug dealer ""Micheal"" did it. I've read that there were witnesses who saw him in the Chelsea after the time Nancy probably died, carrying a large wad of bills wrapped in Nancy's hair band (It was known Sid & Nancy had a large bankroll in the hotel room that was never found). After being seen in their room that night, he disappeared forever, despite having been living in the Chelsea hotel."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cng38,autowikibot,7,Thu Jul 9 07:13:40 2015 UTC,"My theory is exactly the same as yours.  Reading Alan Parker's book on Sid Vicious and watching Who Killed Nancy? led me to that opinion.  Almost no way Sid Vicious was the person responsible.  Numerous people in their room that night thought Sid wouldn't survive the night himself due to the amount of drugs he'd taken and the fact he was laying comatose the entire time.  Wouldn't be able to lift himself up off the floor, let alone lift a knife."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cng38,Jimbob50,2,Thu Jul 9 10:35:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when he had money he went all the way with drugs. And he had just received like $25k in cash a few days before. I seem to remember he was shooting hydromorphone (Dilauded) that night, which is stronger than heroin, and 100% pure because it comes from a pharmacy or hospital (unless someone cut it after getting it from a pharmacy)."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cmyeo,girlyfied,3,Thu Jul 9 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"Are there any bodies of water where she went missing? There aren't many places to hide a car, and she's probably with it, wherever it is.   Was his family rich or influential in town? Why did they share info with them? Could they have financially influenced the investigation?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cmyeo,Badger_Silverado,3,Thu Jul 9 06:08:17 2015 UTC,"I live around where it happened. Her family won over 3 million dollars from the city of Blanchard because they stopped mid-search of a pond where her body most likely was. The theory is that because of the bungling of this, someone snuck around and moved the body out of the pond and disposed of it in a way that made sure  noone would ever find it. On a side note, Vincent Doan was also recently in the news (at least around here, because this case still haunts all of Southern Ohio) because he was in a prison dog rehab program and the dog bit off his nose. So if you believe dogs are a good judge of people...."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cmyeo,rukiacouture,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:55:03 2015 UTC,"This case has been around for a long time.  I wish they'd find her.  I know there have been past cases where a car itself was buried to conceal a crime.  I wonder if he had access to the equipment needed to do this?  I'd bet they've searched many bodies of water but the car still could have been right next to them and they could have missed it.  Also if he had some access to a wrecking yard, the car could have been scrapped or crushed, possibly with her even in it.  You'd think they would have explored these avenues, but maybe not."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cmyeo,TheBestVirginia,2,Thu Jul 9 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"There was definitely a case like that. Lisa Marie Kemmel disappeared like that. Her car was buried to conceal the crime. It's not in the article, but I believe the (alleged) murderer said he was putting in a pool. Years later, they find her car buried in his backyard."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,ggchloe,12,Wed Jul 8 23:51:34 2015 UTC,"Anything on the condition of the bike when it was found? I immediately thought killed in accident, which a driver covered up by dumping the body. Running away at that age with no funds just before a major family event is too strange."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,claimstoknowpeople,7,Thu Jul 9 02:36:40 2015 UTC,"That's what I wondered too. Somebody hits him accidentally, freaks out, hides the body one place and the bike in another, and he just hasn't been found."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,Badger_Silverado,6,Thu Jul 9 05:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would be a big piece of evidence, and I'd assume if the bike was damaged at all it would've been mentioned somewhere.  I did find this bbc article, the last line of which states that one theory they had was that he had some kind of accident.  Doesn't say why they think that though (maybe just general theory, not based on anything).  Also might be hard to tell the difference between general wear from use and damage from an accident though depending on how long he had the bike."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,ving_rhymes,6,Thu Jul 9 23:27:12 2015 UTC,"From Carrickfergus here - this one always seemed rather strange to me too. At the time, I thought he has gotten into some difficulty near the sea (e.g. sat on a wall and fallen in somehow) and drowned and his body was not yet found.  Years later, I still think this is the most likely cause.  What I did find strange at the time as well was that they didn't release a picture of him online, only the picture of him on a bike. Very strange - I'm sure the TV news reports/reconstructions used a picture of him, but I never saw them. EDIT: found this from the time - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16385946  It reminds me of the case of Trevor Deely in Dublin in 2000. I worked in the same IT department he worked in years later in 2007. Very sobering thought to think someone can just disappear."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,Rossimac,5,Thu Jul 9 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"I always welcome stories from outside the US, as they are often things we haven't heard of here.  Interesting, and I don't much have a theory but I could see him opting to leave rather than ""end"" his marriage willingly."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,TheBestVirginia,3,Thu Jul 9 00:35:40 2015 UTC,I thought the general consensus was that he'd committed suicide in the water. The family might not want to believe it but it sounds the most likely scenario to me.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,Cooper0302,2,Thu Jul 9 18:32:32 2015 UTC,"It does seem like the set of circumstances is pointing toward an intentional disappearance but it is extremely difficult to ""disappear"" in today's world.   I guess people accomplish it, but to just to avoid embarrassment and miss out on your kid's life - seems strange."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,justincase25,2,Thu Jul 9 11:40:03 2015 UTC,I suspect he walked the rest of the way
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,railmaniac,2,Thu Jul 9 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"Almost nothing to go on there.  It would be quite possible for him to have hidden money over the years that his family didn't know about.  But, you would expect some hint of why to show up?  Plus, there is a difference between hiding a few thousand to get by on, and enough for a whole new life.  As others already said, a big thing is the condition of the bike.  That would easily suggest or disprove an accident as the main theory.  I wonder if he took his own life."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,Reckoner525,2,Thu Jul 9 14:35:31 2015 UTC,"I dislike the ""saved money for years"" theory.  It's complicated.  Let's say he met some woman, and decided he wanted to be with that woman.    And decided he wanted to abandon his family.    Or let's say...he was gay, and wanted to leave his family and didn't know how to tell his wife?  Well you know what?  This was 2012.  It wouldn't be that hard in this day and age to just go up to your wife and say ""Hey, I'm sorry this isn't working out for me.  I'm leaving.""    Why squirrel money away over the course of years rather than just hire an attorney and get a divorce.  It doesn't add up.  Here's my theory:  Guy goes out for a bicycle ride.  Some kids are driving around and almost hit him.  He starts yelling at them, ""Hey, watch how you drive!""  Let's face it some cyclists are very confrontational.  He ends up getting into an argument with these kids and then accidentally killed in a scuffle.  Irish kids can be very hot tempered.  Suddenly, reality kicks in for these kids, and they're like ""crap, let's steal his bike and hide the body.""  Later, they realize the bike is more of a liability than an asset, and so they dump it rather than having a piece of evidence sitting around in their garage.   No?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,videogamesdisco,2,Fri Jul 10 07:08:42 2015 UTC,"Not impossible.  I don't really buy the idea that hot-headed teenagers can hide a body succesfully though.  Also, kids tend to hang around in town centres, where there are witnesses, not out in the wilds.  Seems pretty likely to me given that other comments have revealed the route was coastal that he ended up in the sea.  In which case, personal opinion is suicide or an accident is more likely to have put him there than murder."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,Reckoner525,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:06:07 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  You know what really supports the idea that this was deliberate and preplanned?  The New Year's Day thing.  I mean, if you were picking a day to kill yourself and/or run away with your mistress, and you needed to choose one arbitrarily, New Years seems to fit.  ...you know maybe he did run away.  Odd.  Such a successful, normal, happy guy.  One with so many ties to the community.  It makes no sense."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm4jk,videogamesdisco,2,Sat Jul 11 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"How rural is this Glenarm area? Do they know where he was planning to bike?   The possibilities are pretty much anything. Fugue state, suicide, accidental fall into the water, mugging."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cmrbw,Hysterymystery,5,Thu Jul 9 02:55:35 2015 UTC,"And I believe the PI. Kilory's the most popular undergrad bar in town; I'm guessing most of that population has been there at least once. And Wilson disappeared during IU's biggest party weekend, when it was the most popular.   The idea that they both disappeared after leaving the same bar would have some weight, I think, if it was a small bar in the middle of nowhere, but that is not Kilroy's. Wilson's death seemed like the work of someone who never killed before."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cm7v4,EugeneBYMCMB,5,Thu Jul 9 00:18:00 2015 UTC,I found the part about the tower climbers pretty interesting.

I always thought it was solved until the disabled man confessed. I believe that they coerced the first confession, but that's just my opinion. I never realized how violent Carrollton is in general. We had several armed robberies and just plain old assaults at UWG last  year."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cki6f,TZMouk,8,Wed Jul 8 16:54:14 2015 UTC,I've never heard about this case. I like how you included photos of everything it helps put the story together for me.  This article is particularly heartbreaking. http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/11/ukcrime.features11  I'm trying to find out if anything came of her body being exhumed for DNA testing.  The poor little thing was stabbed 37 times! I don't think a person like that just goes on and does not commit more crimes.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cki6f,Cecilia_Tallis,5,Wed Jul 8 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"It's how I like to read posts on here, I'm just disappointed I couldn't find out more details, other than from second hand sources.  There was this thread on the local football forum, which has a few more details, which is a fairly interesting read. Also someone on a different thread on there has said ""I believe they've done an exhumation on her body and done DNA tests which are being analysed."" and that was on the 23rd of March this year. So hopefully more information comes from it soon.   I agree, I'm not an expert mind but from Criminal Minds (I know...) it sounds like rage and overkill. Also I don't know if it's mentioned on any articles I've posted but George Heron the original suspect had no other criminal offences whereas Steven Grieveson, the serial killer who was arrested for it, in 2013 (whilst serving life in prison) was apparently in trouble with the police throughout his childhood and notorious for getting in to fights and breaking in to houses."

Allegedly, you have to do a spinal tap. Would Mexico have done this back then?   If this guy she was with happened to be into psychedelics (owing to the Diane Linklater connection) he may have given her something, with or without her knowledge. Even if she was afraid of water she might have gone in during a drug experience."

I think it's more likely that by the time she died alcohol or a drug wasn't detectable in their sample, or Mexico simply missed it. I don't know what their forensic or drug testing was like for deaths in 1984, but I can't imagine it was up to current U.S. Standards for toxicology.   Anyway, I think she went to the beach in an inebriated state and entered the water willing. What happened next is hard to say."

UnresolvedMysteries,3ckeji,Badger_Silverado,6,Wed Jul 8 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"My grandmother's hairdresser was killed very violently several years ago and the police very heavily suspected his ex-wife of having it done. (Both he and his ex-wife were very religious, she was in a new relationship, and didn't really seem the type.)   Then about a year later they arrested a homeless guy who happened to have the hairdresser's driver's license, Social Security card, and something else on his person somewhere. They question him, and he said that he went to the hairdresser's church and had been paid $20 to stack some firewood and when he aw how rich the hairdresser was he thought it was worth $50 and beat him to death with one of the logs.   So while an extremely violent scene usually means it was personal, sometimes something bizarre can happen when somebody who's already a little off snaps. It makes me wonder if they encountered something similar."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ckeji,winnie_bago,2,Thu Jul 9 05:56:49 2015 UTC,Sad.  Maybe it was a case of some sort of elder abuse?  The part about visiting ATMs under duress makes me suspect this.  I wonder how much money was withdrawn and where the money ended up.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cln66,Spingolly,2,Wed Jul 8 21:36:32 2015 UTC,I doubt it. They probably needed more time to work on a story or something outside worked popped up. It was getting good response so I doubt that a new company like Gimlet would drop something that was just starting to roll.

If they updated it for podcasts, it would be this show.  -Indie folky music.  -Music plays on and off incessantly.  -Soft spoken host has a speech impediment.  -Calls itself Mystery but the mystery is like ""what happened to that old video store? my friend says it closed over night"" or ""my friend found a cool belt buckle when he was a kid"".  -She interviews locals, then random soundbites and plays sad music over them to show how ""profound"" the moment is.  I could probably go on, but the gist is the whole thing sounds like the result of what some teenager would think was good about podcasts and then try to do their own.   Honestly I listened to the first and made it about ten minutes into the second before I hit stop and deleted the feed. Which funnily enough, was yesterday."

I'm definitely attaching too much emotion to this due to my interest in cold cases. Maybe he kept the clipping because it was the strangest thing that ever happened to him, maybe because he felt sorry for the poor woman or attached to her. Maybe he even felt responsible for her in a way. I would hate to be considered suspicious for giving a shit about the unidentified. Someone needs to care.  Sidenote: why would anyone kill someone and then alert police themselves? Especially a month after the victim was killed and not found. It makes no sense.

The area came to light when new information was presented to investigators in relation to a man who remains a person of interest in Miss Butterworth’s disappearance.""  Further, in the other article it says a guy driving a loader unearthed a ribcage and didn't report it. Although I wonder how well he can recall the right spot after 40 years.  A final thought: For cases like this, they should involve local metal detecting enthusiasts. One of the articles says they hope they may find jewelry to identify the girl."

If you emailed him through his Morgus website, those emails may not even go to him, but to the person who designed the site apparently in the 90's. He may be better reached through his internet advocacy website: http://www.internetstoryclub.org./  And for reference, his name is Sidney Noel Rideau. He also goes by Sid Noel.  Edited to add: I just listened to Werewolf, and that's definitely him. I'd recognize that voice anywhere."

I posted that, and a recap of all of this, to my surf rock blog  In short, what we learned was   The Daringers did know Morgus, though not well  They were a family band, kids named Daringer, managed by their father  Still doesn't really tell us who they are or if they played anywhere else. It might be a good idea to not focus on Detroit, could be somewhere else nearby and Fulton happened to be the nearest place to make a record.  ALSO, there's a picture sleeve of the 45 out there, though it's insanely rare.

UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,AjaxkidRN,4,Tue Jul 7 09:47:12 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Morgus is a very old dude these days, so I had to send the message to an email on his website that he probably doesn't personally check. I never heard back, but I only tried once, so I'll probably try again. Maybe write a letter as well.  I think he has the best chance of knowing, but then again, the Daringers could've just been some session musicians the folks at Fulton knew. We didn't have Discogs or anything back then, so knowing who exactly played on a specific song before about 1990 is an uphill battle."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,MOONGOONER,6,Tue Jul 7 15:50:45 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting and it's different from the usual.   Did Morgus ever answer your email?  Those songs do sound similar. Could it be simply because it's the generic (for lack of a better term) surf sound?   I would wonder if someone with real hardcore music critiquing ability would be able to listen to it and say something like, ""Oh, well the guitar sounds like the same person because blah blah blah""... however, there is no telling if there was a change in band members between The Daringers and The Deadly Ones-- if they are indeed the same and if they aren't generic studio performers! So many possibilities!"
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,Goo-Bird,3,Tue Jul 7 11:22:57 2015 UTC,"That's a super big problem I've found with trying to track down the Daringers. A lot of surf music sounds quite similar, especially in the early 60s.  I do think the two bands sound more alike than any other groups I've tried, but a lot of my suspicion rides on the similar spooky theme, similar sense of humor, and the close proximity in both the date and the location."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,Goo-Bird,3,Tue Jul 7 16:04:18 2015 UTC,I really doubt the Deadly Ones have any connection to the Daringers. There was a whole lot of horror surf then and now and I simply don't hear enough of a connection between this one and the other Deadly Ones songs (which tend to be a lot more goofy than this one... lots of slide whistle).
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,MOONGOONER,2,Tue Jul 7 22:20:56 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't particularly think it's the same group of anonymous dudes. If there's any connection at all, it might be a shared session musician or two, but probably not the exact same people.  I'm pretty convinced at this point that the Daringers were just some local Detroit session musicians that Charles Fulton knew, and he just grabbed them to make a quick buck by promoting Morgus' syndication around that same time. But damn, what a great sound for something so simple."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,The_Chairman_Meow,2,Wed Jul 8 00:18:08 2015 UTC,"At first blush The Deadly Ones and Morgus Creep sound very similar, though IMST sounds 'cleaner' (by which I mean, doesn't sound like they were recording into a tin can). Dropping it into youtube doubler reveals that they aren't really that similar, though: http://youtubedoubler.com/fWft  As I said Daringers sound more tinny, but they also have waaay more percussion and a darker, slower vibe while IMST are much more upbeat. When you play the two simultaneously you realize that IMST is much more 'surfy' while their sound while Daringers aren't. I am no expert, but I don't think the bands are particularly related, they just work in a same-y sounding genre, like how so many pop songs sound similar because they follow the famous pop chords.   It's possible the bands may have shared a writer but over just the vibe of the two songs is radically different, one being much more avant garde for surf music as far as I know it."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,MOONGOONER,2,Wed Jul 8 04:04:07 2015 UTC,"Good analysis! That's part of why Morgus Creep is such an interesting song to me. It is ostensibly horror surf, but it's a really weird and unique sound that I haven't heard before or since. It's very emotive and dark, and the guitar style is really powerful and skillful. And this was back in '64, which is crazy to me.  I posted the Deadly Ones as more of an observation, and I don't really think they're directly connected, but I still think it's the closest I've heard to the Daringers style. On It's Monster Surfing Time, at around :41 (after the wolf howl) when it gets a bit lower sounds quite close, but then they pick right back up."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,alarmagent,2,Wed Jul 8 05:27:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a really interesting song. Honestly, it reminds me a lot of Inna Godda Davida, though obviously with a surf twist. It's that heavy percussion and grimy, trance-like quality. I love it, I get the feeling I'm going to be listening to it a lot as I ramp up to Halloween. Thanks for posting this for introducing me to a great genre at the very least!  Agreed that the two just have a similar style, but... if I were to describe the difference, it's that The Deadly Ones is Halloween on the beach during the daytime, when every is in costume and kind of messing around, while Morgus Creep is Halloween on the beach at night, when the party has wound down and everyone's silently sitting around a fire passing around a joint."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,nolacola,5,Wed Jul 8 06:53:57 2015 UTC,"As somebody that does a surf rock radio show in New Orleans, I never thought to look into this but now I absolutely have to know. I'm going to ask around.  Worth noting, Morgus had a number of New Orleans-recorded singles - none with as much of a surf sound. Frankie Ford and Dr John/Mac Rebennack both made appearances on them. Mac has done instro (""Storm Warning"", very Bo Diddley-esque) but I don't think this is him."

If I remember correctly, those singles came before Werewolf/Morgus Creep, and that's a real big reason why I don't think Morgus had much of a connection to the Daringers. If you have facilities to do that in New Orleans, why take your surf-rock buddies 1000+ miles to a soul label in Detroit?  Fulton also seemed to primarily record people they knew rather well, musicians that happened to be buddies with Charles and James, so I really think Morgus was the odd one out."

From what I've just recently learned, Morgus the Magnificent played only in the NOLA, NYC and Detroit markets. Maybe Sid Noel made some music connections while he was in Detroit in the late 50's/early 60's pitching Morgus the Magnificent to the Detroit station. And he likely just had friends in different places, stuff like that.  Honestly, I don't think you'll get an answer from Morgus himself. He is notoriously private, so much so that according to this Times Picayune article his own son didn't know he was Morgus the Magnificent. But I promise that that is Morgus speaking in the beginning of Werewolf. I grew up watching him. I had my husband listen to Werewolf and he agrees that it's certainly Morgus.   Edited to add: Here's half an episode of Morgus Presents so people can compare the voice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw1AIDbigGc  Everyone needs to watch it so they too can be of The Higher Order."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,The_Chairman_Meow,2,Wed Jul 8 02:23:21 2015 UTC,"I definitely think there's a lot of reason to believe your theory that they were just session men. I'll point out that from what I've gathered there was slim to no surf craze in New Orleans, so once again probably not New Orleans musicians.  I just took a look at surf historian John Blair's Illustrated Discography of Surf Music - one of the best reference materials I know of for surf. I was surprised that he did indeed list the Daringers. It's followed by a big question mark."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,MOONGOONER,5,Wed Jul 8 02:35:16 2015 UTC,"Ha, this is a super cool post. I wish I could help unravel the mystery, but I love the songs and the fact that this is a mystery. Detroit & Gary are definitely near enough each other with a shared enough culture that I can definitely see artists recording in both places.   Edit: I really wish we could solve this one - Morgus probably holds the key! What about reaching out to other musicians who would be into this style of music?   The Cramps would've definitely been fans of this spooky surf sound, and maybe sought out the musicians (to say thanks for being awesome, or whatever) & had better luck than us due to industry connections. Or, they just might know for some other reason! Kid Congo Powers is active on social media, and he's responded to me on Twitter once before."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,MOONGOONER,4,Tue Jul 7 12:39:41 2015 UTC,"I sent out a tweet to Hunter King, who runs Tulane University's surf rock radio program. I think Hunter might be able to get in touch with Sid Noel or someone else who might have been involved with it at the time.  By the way, if you like surf music, his show Storm Surge of Reverb is amazing."

If you notice, on the Morgus Creep side it just has Mills.  I'm not a music historian and I'm not a good sleuth, so that name could be anything, but I'm assuming since Noel isn't on the Morgus Creep side, I'm going to assume that Mills is a member of the Daringers. None of the names I have determined to be connected to the business side of Fulton share that name.  I searched through Discog's surf category for Mills, and I arrived at one very interesting suspect. Rick Mills, the guitarist from The Volcanos and 3-D Invisible. Take a listen.  It would be a stretch and a half, but I figured I'd post it.   EDIT: Rick Mills was kind enough to message me back, and he said it's just a coincidence and he doesn't know any more than we do. There is another Mills involved in surf, a man named Irving Mills who wrote a few songs by the Ventures, but that's about all I got."

And I just went and listened to Morgus Creep andd The Dead Ones song that was posted on better speakers and I'm 100% sure they're the same band. The guitar tones are too similar."
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,witch-wife,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:12:08 2015 UTC,Guitar tones doesn't mean they're the same. Otherwise every pop band that uses the four pop chords are the same band. Genre conventions can lead to very same-y sounds.
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,The_Chairman_Meow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I meant the actual sound of the guitars. Most guitarists will have their own tone, with specific treble/mid/bass settings on their amps, specific string gauges,specific effects pedal settings, all that kind of stuff. The guitar sound on the deadly ones and the daringers are really identical. Of course that likely means nothing at all"
UnresolvedMysteries,3ceblf,Spingolly,2,Wed Jul 8 07:10:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, so according to the Fox documentary, Detroit wasn't airing the New Orleans show. I was under the impression that you guys in Detroit were watching the same show at the same time as us in New Orleans.   Apparently, Sid Noel simply moved to Detroit and brought his show with him in the 1960's. He probably recorded this with session musicians while living there, so they're almost certainly not Dr. John, Frankie Ford and Jerry Byrne, who he recorded with as Morgus and the Three Ghouls. Sid Noel moved back to NOLA and resumed his show after living in Detroit a short while.  So I think the only clue to go on for the identity of the session players is Mills.

IF she did kill herself, it would be quite normal for her to cheerfully call someone to wish them a happy birthday. Suicidal people often declare their love for the family/friends and are very loving and nice in the days leading up to their suicide.   That being said, this does have some odd aspects to it that make me feel in my gut that it's some type of coverup. Why the hell is her autopsy NOT her family's business?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdjmr,ttho10,5,Tue Jul 7 13:43:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you both on that. I would say her telling her family to investigate if anything happens to her and the refusal to release the autopsy to the family as far more of a case against it being suicide.   On the other hand though, if it was a cover up, why wouldn't enemy or friendly fire be the perfect way to cover it up? Why would you change it to suicide?"

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdjmr,BiscuitCat1,5,Tue Jul 7 03:55:32 2015 UTC,Exactly. She may have uncovered missing money or money that was spent on things it wasn't meant for.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdjmr,miltonwadd,2,Tue Jul 7 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"That was just one example (listed on her Wikipedia page).  There were several others within the time frame of her confiding in her family and her death, but I had a heck of a time trying to chase down sources.  She also mentioned in an email to friends earlier in her deployment that another soldier had pulled a 9mm pistol on her.

Nor was I briefed about suicides when I was there.Even stranger was the fact nobody was around her or heard the gun shot. I think this lady was murdered. My opinion comes from once being in the military. People in the military are just like everyone else. Someone people want to have the idea that good honorable people serve but this is not the case. Just as you have those people in the society... there is plenty of them in the military. Often when the military says someone died a certain way.. they want to leave it at that and be done. They dont want to do a investigation like in the real world. There was a case on Dateline or 20/20 where husband and wife were both in the military and they told her one thing had happened but in reality something else... the pilots who were flying miscalculated badly and could not ascend fast enough and crashed into the mountains. The only reason she got answers was because she knew info before he had left for the flight and got the media involved.

Her weird behavior, such as asking for an easy bake oven for christmas, and mild social awkwardness screams she didn't have a proper childhood with a lot of social interaction. It was like she wanted to capture the childhood she never got the chance to have.   She reminds me of a real life version of Kimmy Schimdt"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,Shortymac09,3,Tue Jul 7 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"There has also been a few comments where people suggested she could be the missing Canadian girl Lori Kasprick, which is why she wasn't found on any database in the US. She also could be the runaway Cynthia Lorraine Perry. I don't agree with neither and think that she definitely was part of a cult or an abusive relationship, that explains her bizarre behavior, and paranoia. And her wanting an easy bake oven definitely says she had an awful childhood and wanted to relive it."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,TheBestVirginia,4,Wed Jul 8 13:51:26 2015 UTC,"True.. Going from her allegedly wanting a ""toy"" to ""this must definitely signify an abusive childhood"" is a huge and illogical stretch."

So she stuck to the west of the United States and has ties to Idaho (Becky Sue). And she had the knowledge to change her identity in such a way that a professional from Social Security can't trace her. I think she was in a militia group in Idaho or Montana. Part of the training she may have received was hiding identity. These groups are fearful of government and would explore how to hide their true identity so that even the government couldn't trace them. She used that knowledge to escape them, who knows for what reason. Mental illness? Trauma? Abusive relationship? Born into it and wanted a different life? It would also explain why there doesn't seem to be a missing person report. A militia would be unlikely to report her absence to the government they fear. She also killed herself with a gun, a relatively rare way for women to commit suicide. She seems to have had a level of familiarity with guns that would make it her choice of weapon. That's my theory anyway."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,TedBundyTeeth,3,Tue Jul 7 07:18:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but idk. I think I remember reading she had worked at a strip club, and had breast implants, so that makes me think she was involved in sex trafficking and was trying to escape that life.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,Hysterymystery,5,Wed Jul 8 03:25:33 2015 UTC,I think I remember that the strip club and breast implants happened after she changed her identity.  An easy way to make money when she had no work history that she could actually use?
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,TedBundyTeeth,3,Wed Jul 8 05:21:54 2015 UTC,That was my thought. Strip clubs are an easy way to make money without doing too much proving who you are. Don't need a SSN. Get paid in cash. Need no training. Get to use a fake name.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,LustsoftheLibertines,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:59:10 2015 UTC,I think it's definitely plausible.  I have no idea how one would go about trying to substantiate it though.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,xxxt,2,Wed Jul 8 02:57:06 2015 UTC,How significant is the Idaho drivers licence? Idaho and Montana were home to many survivalist/patriot militia movements during this timeframe. Does the fact she used that state's licence serve as evidence of a militia connection ?
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,ffflildg,3,Wed Jul 8 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"This case has always been so intriguing to me, it's definitely one that I've found especially haunting and has stuck with me for so long. I haven't thought out an extensive theory but I have to say that I've always shared the domestic violence ideas about why she changed her identity. As someone who was in an abusive relationship myself and who struggled to leave for a long period of time I found myself in many support groups and a common theme of leaving is setting up new identities. There was even a lot of discussion in these groups about changing your social security number and while I never knew anyone to steal anyone's identity illegally many of us who stayed in contact did assume fake names or move to different parts of the country."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,Hysterymystery,0,Wed Jul 8 00:15:05 2015 UTC,"But if she was fleeing just a violent relationship,  that still doesn't explain how no one has recognized her..."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,ffflildg,2,Tue Jul 7 23:51:19 2015 UTC,"This isn't the most exciting theory, but I feel like the reason she changed her identity is pretty mundane. She wanted to start a new life. We know she's struggled with mental illness. She probably has paranoia as part of her symptoms and has built up her past into something really awful that she needs to hide from when in reality it's just a run of the mill crappy childhood. There's probably no big mystery."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,electrobolt,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"Lori Ruff gets brought up quite a bit in these parts.

Personally, I think the pot of gold is waiting in the Mormon theory. A google image search of ""Lori Ruff Lebarons"" brings up some pretty interesting images... Also, she didn't ""choose"" the name Becky Sue Turner. She stole Becky Sue Tuner's identity.  I've ranted about this before and I'll say it again: There's only one thing that trips me up about Lori Kennedy's final name change, and it's the fact that she chose Erica as her middle name. That's not a thing. No one born in the late 60's/early 70's has a middle name of Erica. It was a trendy late 70's/early 80's first name. Lori Kennedy's final name change was in the late 80's, so I'm quite confident that in pre-internet times your average person wouldn't know or have access to such esoteric niches of knowledge as North American name trends, so she wouldn't know it's a little odd. She almost certainly heard a lot of parents calling their little girls Erica, decided she liked it and adopted it as a middle name. But as someone whose name is Erica, if I ever met someone whose middle name is Erica born before 2000 I'd be giving that woman all the side-eye."

Your theory would make sense if we were talking about a new name, something like Brayden or Mykynzie, etc. But Erica and Erika are not new names. They have been around since the 1600s!   Erica was consistently in the top 1000 baby names last century and in fact was in the top 300-400 as early as 1963. By 1970, it was in the top 100. It is not at all unreasonable that the woman we know as Lori Ruff could have known about and chosen the middle name Erica much earlier than the late 80s."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,The_Chairman_Meow,11,Tue Jul 7 02:57:20 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your point about the middle name - we already know Lori Erica is an assumed name, don't we? (not trying to be confrontational, I just feel like I'm missing something in your comment)"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,Catele,-6,Tue Jul 7 16:30:14 2015 UTC,"I think the choice of the middle name shows that she doesn't have any specialized training in changing one's identity. Just like Joe on Thinking Sideways said, everything she had done to change her identity could have been learned from reading spy novels.   I think if she were an expert or had been trained to do this, one of the first things she would have learned is to have a (not too) mundane name. If you meet a man born in 1983, his middle name is most likely not Jason. It would be extremely unusual to have that as a middle name during a certain point in time. If one were trying to, and had specialized training to hide in plain sight you would choose a middle name that was more common to give as a middle name in your year of birth.   Lori Marie Kennedy makes much more sense in terms of commonality. There are probably 1000 Lori Marie Kennedys in Massachusetts alone. But sounds pretty Catholic. I think she wanted/needed a secular middle name, but not being trained she chose a name she liked.   And before anyone says it, yes I know I'm generalizing about names. But I think when people are educated specifically about changing identities, they're supposed to generalize. They want to blend in 100%."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,IndigoPlum,6,Tue Jul 7 12:16:35 2015 UTC,"I wondered if the name Erica had special significance to her like if someone in her previous life was named Eric, she may have chosen Erica."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,ffflildg,2,Tue Jul 7 16:42:31 2015 UTC,I've often thought that. If you got the chance to rename yourself with no consequences such as an upset Mother you'd probably choose something significant to you.  Personally I quite fancy being a Verity or a Bryony.

It was identity theft, but it's not like she actually tried to live as BST for any significant time. I think that's a red herring.  Just because a name is unusual for a middle name, or doesn't sound great in that order, doesn't mean some people wouldn't choose it. I would bet a year's salary there are at least 100 women in the US with the middle name Erica."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,anditwaslove,5,Tue Jul 7 23:44:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, from this we can assume that, for whatever reason, it was absolutely not safe to use her real identity any longer.  So she steals BST's identity as quickly as possible and, knowing that eventually someone will connect the dots what with the whole ""died in a fire"" thing, she changes her name and branches to a new identity LEK that won't be as easily tied to BST unless someone does a lot of digging."

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,autowikibot,4,Tue Jul 7 23:09:31 2015 UTC,Erica is an older name than I thought being coined in the 18th century. And while not popular until the 70s/80s there are a few older fampus Ericas. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_%28given_name%29
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,The_Chairman_Meow,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:50:53 2015 UTC,"Erika (given name):       The given name Erika, or Erica, is a feminine form of Eric, deriving from the Old Norse name Eiríkr (or Eríkr in Eastern Scandinavia due to monophthongization). The first element, ei- is derived either from the older Proto-NorseZ*aina(z) meaning ""one"" or ""some"", or from Proto-Norse *aiwa(z) meaning ""fair"" or ""tradition"".   The second element -ríkr derives either from *rík(a)z meaning ""ruler"" or ""prince"" (cf. Gothic reiks), or from an even older Proto-Germanic *ríkiaz which meant ""powerful"" and ""rich"".  The name is thus usually taken to mean something along the lines of ""one ruler"", ""autocrat"", ""eternal ruler"" or ""ever powerful"".

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,imyourdackelberry,11,Tue Jul 7 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"It's not that unusual though. If it's a common first name then it can be a common middle name.

""Hey computer guy, run a check on woman this age with unusual middle names. What...ummm...no I don't think Erica is uncommon."""
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,SnittingNexttoBorpo,-3,Tue Jul 7 18:23:04 2015 UTC,I have never once heard someone with the middle name of Erica.  Especially not after Lori.  They just don't go.  It sounds like she picked them out of a hat.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,The_Chairman_Meow,7,Tue Jul 7 18:46:04 2015 UTC,They sound bad together but I think that's totally irrelevant to the mystery of who she really was. She just didn't have a good ear for picking names. Homegirl also loved high tea and worked as a stripper so we know that she had some odd tastes.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,TheBestVirginia,0,Tue Jul 7 23:38:01 2015 UTC,I think being bad at picking names could very well be relevant to who she really is. Someone who doesn't know or care about such tiny details could more likely have a background of being raised outside od modern society. I think it's another clue pointing to the cult theory.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,ManInABlueShirt,2,Wed Jul 8 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"Following the suggestion that the middle name is of most importance, it's worth then considering (my personal thought) that she might be a runaway named Cynthia Lorraine Perry, whose nickname was Lori.  It was important to her, so she kept it, and it wasn't her legal name, so she couldn't be traced by it.  Pics of Cynthia and Lori (as Becky Sue) side by side:  http://i.imgur.com/zCqQUuC.jpg"
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,penelopebrewster,2,Wed Jul 8 04:57:47 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with a middle name of Erica? I agree it's a name for women in their 30s now, but what would for off about someone called Jane Erica Smith if Erica just happened to be her parents' second favourite name?  I guess not everyone is named after a treasured relative.  My theory is that she may have been abducted as a child, raised under a false ID, homeschooled etc then refused an SSN at 18. A couple of years later - taking time to figure out a plan, get things done and build the necessary contacts - she becomes Becky out of necessity.  There's an outside chance of some personal connection but I can't decide if it's more surprising that someone happened across a perfect case in the archives or that there'd be a useful personal connection.  This is all too much strain for her family relationships and she cuts them off or simply drifts apart. Lori Erica may mean something or may just sound good to her. Outside chance, she was raised under that name it something similar.  As to who she is - Melissa Highsmith fits nicely with that scenario but she could almost be anyone including someone with mental illness and an otherwise mundane background."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,zaffiro_in_giro,4,Thu Jul 9 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"refused an SSN at 18   I think she was at most 16 in 1988 when she got the Idaho drivers license. She was 5'6"" in 1988 and 5'10"" was her full adult height. I am a woman who is 5'10"" and my adult height was reached by my 17th birthday.   For a female to grow 4 inches after her 18th birthday a medical condition would almost have to be involved."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,ffflildg,5,Tue Jul 7 07:37:31 2015 UTC,"I also think she was under eighteen when she got the Becky Sue ID. I know there's speculation that she may have been older than her fake ID claimed (explaining why she had trouble when she tried to have a baby), but plenty of young women have fertility problems - it's not necessarily age-related. And to me, one of the top reasons for stealing an identity when you're in your teens has to be to make yourself 18, with all the freedoms that brings. If you want to live out on your own - get a job, get a bank account, rent an apartment, not have anyone trying to send you back to your parents or guardians or into a foster home - it's almost impossible to do as a sixteen-year-old, but no problem for an eighteen-year-old."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,ffflildg,2,Tue Jul 7 12:27:44 2015 UTC,Most women are done growing about 2 years after the start of their period.  Usually by 15 they are full height.  It would be very unusual for a woman to grow much taller at all after 15.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,MT_Straycat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:01:37 2015 UTC,The thing that tips me off as this being professional is knowing to retrieve Becky's information. How would a girl in her teens know of a near perfect case to steal identity? Someone tipped her off on this.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,tfan10,3,Wed Jul 8 03:41:05 2015 UTC,Maybe but that also makes her give birth at age 53. I think we're looking at a birth year in the 60s.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cdko1,imyourdackelberry,2,Tue Jul 7 16:04:40 2015 UTC,I'm not deciding either way on her age but if she came from a fundamentalist mormon group this is something her or someone close to her may have some decent knowledge of. These groups live in a paranoia of the outside world and have been raided by the feds before. The larger groups have several compounds hundreds of miles apart in other states or even Canada and Mexico and travel back and forth. Considering this and that some don't even have SS numbers or Drivers License it makes sense that they would be heavily involved in fake ID's and documents.

This makes sense since hair is often cut or lost. I know they do analysis in archeological digs and are able to look at migratory patterns. For example, there was a highly publicized case recently where I live, where researchers were able to look at a 3000-year old body and figure out that he lived in one place from the time he was born, and travelled to where he died only days before his death."

Actually, I don't know if favourite is the right word, but it has stuck with me and I get frustrated and a little choked up just thinking about it.   Disappeared did his story justice but I wish more true crime docs would feature the case. There is virtually no chance that he is still alive but that doesn't take away from the importance of finding out what really happened to him. For the sake of his family, of course, but also because it is so necessary to uncover and understand how an elderly blind man can just vanish so we can prevent the tragedy occurring with other vulnerable individuals."

Also, his oxygen tanks were closer to the front of the cave. I'm torn. The whole idea of going into that cave at all is terrifying, especially the posters warning people to turn back.   *48 Hours/Disappeared Jennifer Kesse and Tara Grinstead. I especially find Jennifer Kesse's disappearance  frustrating because the likely abductor was lucky enough to be photographed precisely when the bars of the gate obscured his face.  *Amy Bechtel.

He was guilty, end of story. Then they found out that a local convicted felon was at the scene. So the prosecution had to rewrite their whole case to explain why a sex offender was hanging out at this crime scene when their original theory of the crime had Camm committing the crime alone. Then they had to re-explain again when even more of their case was disproven. Then he was acquitted and it turned out they basically framed him.   My favorite Dateline episode was the one about Travis Stay. Another interesting acquittal and, if you ask me, a great look at the prosecution getting tunnel vision. A really great example of why defense attorneys are so important. You can't always trust the prosecution to do their due diligence.   As for Disappeared...probably either Crime and Punishment (Felipe Santos & Terrance Williams) or Maura Murray. I also liked the Bill McGrath episode. (Missing by Design)"

If you're into podcasts Thinking Sideways is really good and covers a lot of the cases mentioned in the top reply.  Edit to add: the /r/gratefuldoe sub is also well worth a look at.

UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,Austin018,33,Mon Jul 6 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"Probably not connected, but another 19 year old white male went missing while living on the same street, about a mile away, about a month later."

UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,DantheManFoley,18,Mon Jul 6 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think it would be at least worth a second look. Omaha is not exactly a large city where many people go missing each week. There's quite a few things in common between the two with their residence being the most striking, at least in my opinion. Very little on the Sherman case seems to be available, however. It received less press attention than Jason's case."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,hotelindia,26,Mon Jul 6 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"You know, just to be safe, I'm going to go ahead and pass this information along to Omaha PD. I'm sure they must have looked at the possibility back in the day, but I might as well make sure."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,anthym29,2,Mon Jul 6 21:17:17 2015 UTC,Will you update us if anything comes of this?  I guess I'd like to know if they give any indication that they knew this information already or if it's new to them.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,hotelindia,5,Tue Jul 7 13:35:35 2015 UTC,Will do. Waiting to hear back.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,anthym29,4,Tue Jul 7 15:03:48 2015 UTC,Thank you!  And thank you for doing this.

UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,hotelindia,7,Thu Jul 9 00:47:09 2015 UTC,maybe a john wayne gacy type killer?
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,hotelindia,14,Mon Jul 6 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"That's the eyebrow-raising possibility. I found Sherman while looking to see if any other white males in their late teens or early 20s went missing in the same area and time frame. As near as I can tell, though, Jolkowski and Sherman seem to be the only two. All recent speculation along these lines online seems to stem from my post on last year's Jason Jolkowski thread. I'd think if there was a strong possibility of the two being related, someone else would have made the connection in the ensuing years.  Given that nobody is looking very hard for Sherman, and that the police would certainly have had the Jolkowski disappearance fresh in their minds when Sherman went missing, I think it's unlikely the two are actually connected."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,hotelindia,7,Mon Jul 6 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. What is more is Sherman had a job interview that day (which he went to) but never returned home. He lived on the 3600 block of Bedford Ave, close to Jason's family."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,ural8,6,Mon Jul 6 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"Right. It's unclear if he disappeared from the area around Bedford Ave, or somewhere else entirely. Nobody seems to be looking very hard for Sherman, though, which suggests they have a pretty good idea what happened to him, and the two cases are probably just a coincidence."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,JockeyOfDiscs,9,Mon Jul 6 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"there is remarkably little material about the Sherman case online it seems. Even other forum members note this. My feeling would be the authorities are withholding important information from the public to not compromise their investigation...or perhaps little was investigated. But there is not even a complete profile on him, though he about the same age as Jason and disappeared July 19th or 20th, 2001."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,Meow__Bitch,3,Mon Jul 6 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yep. Even today, there's no sketch, no photographs, no dental chart, and no DNA for Samuel Sherman. Did he fall through the cracks because he didn't have a family to advocate for him? Or is nobody looking for him because everybody is pretty sure where he is? There's so little information that anything is possible. It seems difficult to imagine that nobody noticed the possibility back when it happened, however."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,Meow__Bitch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"I have a thought on Samuel Sherman. They say he had just left a job interview. Usually a person who has a job interview has submitted an application that includes basic personal information, prior work experience and education. Maybe the police have this?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,verifiedshitlord,2,Wed Jul 8 15:13:36 2015 UTC,Has anybody tried to contact authorities to get them to reveal more about this guy's case?
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,N0_Soliciting,6,Wed Jul 8 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"With so little evidence available it is pretty much all speculation.... I do hope they looked closely at the coworker though, because that seems to be the only part of his day that was out of the ordinary. And the coworker is the only one who can claim Jason never showed up at the highschool."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,mybrainisasquid,10,Mon Jul 6 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"true, with so little evidence there is little to do but speculate. But, it does help keep his memory alive and people interested...someone out there knows something about this case.   As I understand, the co-worker who was giving him the ride was questioned extensively--more than anyone else in fact. The boss was also questioned numerous times, but neither could provide any useful details or neither, at least of what was revealed, were complicit in Jason's disappearance or knew anything about it...though, I would be open to the possibility of the employer being tied to the disappearance.   Nobody is really sure what exact route he took to the high school, or how far he got. Jason had to walk about eight blocks, in a zig-zag like pattern from his house at North 48th street and Pinkney Street to Benson High school, which would had involved walking along Bedford Ave for at least one to five blocks, depending on the exact route he took.  Benson High is bounded by Bedford, North 50th, Maple and North 52nd streets with 50th street being the least traveled/queitest residential street and would had made the quickest route from Jason's house to the high school....if you look at Google Maps you will also see a Spencer street and Wirt Street off N50th, which are dead ends by the high school fields...I wonder if Jason ever used these as a short cut? They are very quiet and secluded residential lanes. N 50th Ave leads right into the high school grounds, and it too is somewhat secluded/not very traveled...so, Jason could had taken any of these routes to the high school, if he got that far. I do think Jason got at least as far as crossing Bedford Ave.   On the other hand, we have a large park, Gallagher Park across from the front of the high school on N 52nd street and there is, at the immediate south-west of the high school very easy access to the NW Radial Highway (Rt 64) which leads out to I-680, 480 and Interstate 80 within ten minutes.  Maple street has another entrnce to the high school, with a parking lot and houses and apartments on the other side of the street.  However, nothing I have ever read has actually stated where the co-worker intended to meet Jason. It could had been at either the front, 52nd entrance or the Maple street side...Maple was closer to his house if he went by way of North 50th Street AND North 50th Ave (they are two different streets, adjacent)...a little confusing if you had to give directions!  Many articles mention Jason had a hard time giving directions, so the high school was a logical spot to meet. I have wondered if this too somehow factored in. But, lets remember there were a few things out of the ordinary that day: his car was in the shop--had been all week--he called in unexpectedly and he was about to start a new job.  While these could just be coincidences, someone he knew might had taken advantage of this changed schedule---I feel Jason encountered someone he knew along the way to meet his ride and willingly went with them, perhaps under the pretense of bringing him to the ride faster, or to work.  The one thing I would really like to know is did anyone (or how long until) did someone attempt to call Jason's cell phone---and did his co-worker-ride also have a cell phone? Remember, back in 2001 cell phones were hardly ubiquitous yet, so it really could go either way."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,thelittlewizardboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:10:34 2015 UTC,Where was he working? Do you know what type of job it was or where it was located?
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,Meow__Bitch,3,Mon Jul 6 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, the Italian restaurant Jason was working at, Fazoli's was located at 80th and Cass Streets in Omaha...it is still there as of July, 2014, according to Google Maps and Earth. So, it would had been quite a hike to walk from his house. Even from the high school it would be a drive of at least four miles, mainly by way Route 64, on to 72nd going south and then west on Cass from several more blocks to 80th. The restaurant is in a large shopping plaza, at a busy intersection where two major roads cross, so lots of traffic and lots of commercial/retail strip malls, etc."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,thelittlewizardboy,2,Tue Jul 7 01:15:54 2015 UTC,"At the time Jason disappeared, he was working at a Fizoli's Italian restaurant about four and half miles away from his home (I don't know the address), though he was due to start a new job the following week as a DJ for the radio station at the community college he attended part-time. (His current employer was aware he was leaving for the new job and he seemed excited to be starting it). It was not that unusual for his boss at Fizolli's to call employees in early or ask for them to change schedules time to time, so him going in early that day was not too surprising. He seemed content with his job there, no known problems with co-workers, etc."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,Reckoner525,11,Mon Jul 6 20:45:00 2015 UTC,I think someone drove by in a car and grabbed him. What they did with him... probably killed him. It could have been some people he knew and decided to play a joke on him and it got out of hand..  I could also see him thinking he may be late to work and accepting a ride from someone who said they would take him (provided he got to the pickup place a little late and his co worker was not there).   I don't think someone hit him with their car because he was in broad daylight and a residential area.. someone would have seen / heard something.   I would be interested in reading thru an AMA with his mother. I have read somethings from her relating to missing persons and what goes into looking for them.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,anthym29,8,Mon Jul 6 14:55:46 2015 UTC,"Idk how someone would drive by and ""grab"" someone of Jason's size"
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,hotelindia,3,Mon Jul 6 17:51:47 2015 UTC,"If they didn't literally GRAB him, but somehow lured/tricked him into getting into their vehicle as has been suggested elsewhere."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,wanttoplayball,16,Tue Jul 7 01:10:16 2015 UTC,"Wild guess, but I think that Jason was the victim of some random, horrible accident. One thing I learned in my college anatomy course is that the human body is terrifying frail. An otherwise innocuous fall can put your lights out forever given the proper combo of angle of impact/perfectly placed object/etc... Blood and/or post-impact drama are not needed. Boom, dead, end of story. Not common, but it does happen.  Perhaps some former classmates decided to prank him by lightly brushing him with a car (some sheriff insists that this is the solution to the Tara Calico mystery, but who knows) or threw a bottle at him and the unthinkable happened. There are no indications that he had any of the typical issues that would get a person murdered. A random thrill kill is statistically unlikely. There's no indication that the coworker had anything to do with it.  I have absolutely nothing to support this belief. Not a single shred of evidence. I suppose it makes as much sense as any other scenario. Unfortunately, I think this goes forever unsolved. That poor family."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,ural8,10,Mon Jul 6 17:03:22 2015 UTC,"But if an accident happened why would the perpetrators stick around to load a body into their car in broad daylight and take it elsewehere to dispose of it? That seems like unnecessary risk, rather than just driving/walking off."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,ural8,10,Mon Jul 6 17:26:12 2015 UTC,Panic? Stupidity? Maybe they feared something on the body would clue the authorities as to who did it. I honestly have no idea.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,CarlC259,5,Mon Jul 6 17:28:17 2015 UTC,"I guess really anything is possible with this case. Personally, I think he was abducted, but I suppose an accident might had occurred.  The one aspect which makes me open to such a possibility is if you look at a map of the area involved, from Jason's home to the high school, there are a few different routes he could had taken and each of them involve a fairly secluded area behind the high school, where Spencer and N 50th Ave lead from the neighborhoods into the school grounds. Say a car hit him, like a prank where kids where scaring him by chasing him with their truck, they hit him accidentally, killing him.  They quickly pick him up, throw him in the back and drive off. It could happen fast enough for nobody to see or hear anything out of the ordinary, especially if it happened as he was entering the school grounds via Spencer Ave, which looks like it would be part of the quickest route for him. The 'pranksters' later dispose of the body. I suppose something like that is possible."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,CarlC259,11,Mon Jul 6 18:54:14 2015 UTC,I'd suggest foul play and that the chance he is alive is vanishly small.  Beyond that...  Too old for the typical paedophile.  Seemingly not involved in anything suspect.  Assume a link would have been made if there was a serial killer in the area.  The only other outside possiblity is an accident.  If there was a river or other body of water of any size on his route I would bet a lot of money he ended up there.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,CarlC259,14,Mon Jul 6 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"My general impression from reading of this case is that Jason was perceived as a little younger than is actual age of nineteen (almost 20), despite his 6-foot frame at 165lbs.  I would not rule out a pedophile-like assailant completely--or more specifically, one who liked young males, not children.  After all, John Gacy had a number of victims who were in their late teens if not early twenties---so did Dean Caroll, who killed a number of young boys and men in Texas in the 1970s.  Jason was not known to be street smart and was generally trusting..and it could had even been someone he knew."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,CarlC259,4,Mon Jul 6 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"I read on his Charley Project that he also had a speech and language disability which often had people assume he was of below average intelligence.  He was actually above average, but in a normal day to day interaction with a stranger, the stranger may have assumed he was more vulnerable than he actually was.  Considering he's known to be trusting and not street smart, my mind is saying even more-so that I think something tragically sinister might have happened here."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,dragthewaters91,8,Tue Jul 7 13:43:19 2015 UTC,"If there was a river or other body of water of any size on his route I would bet a lot of money he ended up there.   There wasn't. Not even a stream, or a drainage culvert. It's just residential streets all the way to the high school."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,dragthewaters91,3,Mon Jul 6 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe he was lured into a home by someone he knew, at least casually.  Or someone who seemed helpless and actually wasn't.  He pops in to help the person with whatever, is overcome, or maybe is assaulted and fatally hurt.  The other missing teen in the area makes me wonder if there is someone nearby who likes teen boys."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,SunnySkies11,3,Tue Jul 7 00:14:48 2015 UTC,"ya, and the almost complete lack of publicity for the Sherman case, which happened only a month later is very, very odd. He lived close to Jason and the high school, was the same age. Which makes me think---did Sherman and Jason ever know each other? (Jason attended and graduated from Benson High, where he was supposed to meet his ride to work). However, it appears Sam Sherman did not attend Benson High, at least according to the school's 1999 yearbook, which included the juniors, Class of 2000. Sherman was born in 1982, so likely was class of 2000 or maybe 2001, but he probably went to another high school.  Jason would had known the area very well. I would think someone familiar, local to the neighborhood some how was responsible of at least Jason's disappearance."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,TheLeadDaisy,6,Tue Jul 7 00:42:03 2015 UTC,"This case seems baffling with basically no physical evidence. I think he was walking toward the high school as he planned to and was intercepted by someone. As he had been without a car for a number of days, it is possible he had been sighted and registered as a target. Perhaps some predator of some sort got him into a home/building or more likely into a car and tricked him and/or took him against his will. Another possibility could be that some local kids who knew him maybe offered him a ride and fucked with him and it got out of hand, or maybe someone was just a local psychopath. I would imagine that someone who did something like this would not be a one-time offender, and could be linked to other crimes."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,dragthewaters91,2,Wed Jul 8 04:16:28 2015 UTC,"I think the total lack of physical evidence points towards Jason leaving with someone willingly.  His car had been in the shop for at least a few days by the time he vanished and I think someone had observed him walking to work or to a ride, etc. in the days leading up and on June 13th seized the opportunity. Unfortunately, I can not find anything that tells us what Jason did in the previous days he did not have his car---did he actually go to work? Did he walk or was he given a ride? At one point Jason apparently planned to walk the 4.5 miles to the Fizoli's where he worked, but then asked a co-worker for a ride for 10:45am (which they agreed to meet in the high school parking lot). I think someone had watched him over the last few days at least."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,Meow__Bitch,2,Wed Jul 8 10:44:29 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I wish we knew more about this Samuel Sherman. It could be nothing or it could be something.   I wonder what known unsavory characters were living or passing through the area at that time. I still think someone who would do something like this would do it more than once.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,dragthewaters91,4,Wed Jul 8 13:27:25 2015 UTC,"I can't believe that I only heard about this case a few years ago. I actually went to Benson and graduated from there about a year after this. I know the area pretty well. The neighborhoods around Benson at the time were pretty quiet, but if you go a little ways east towards 30th you get into some more rough gang neighborhoods. I don't think it was quite as bad back then as it is now, but I know there was still at least some gang activity around back then."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,anthym29,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:46:33 2015 UTC,"Did you ever know a Samuel Sherman? He vanished only a month after Jason--he was also the same age and lived in the same neighborhood as the Jolkowskis, in the 3600 block of Bedford Ave, which would be close to Benson High....also, what sort of place was Benson High then? Was it large student body? Was there a close-nit student body or did it have cliques or other issues?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,Badger_Silverado,3,Wed Jul 8 10:33:32 2015 UTC,"No I didn't know him. Reading this thread is actually the first time I ever heard of him. I didn't know Jason either. Our years at Benson apparently overlapped some (in my sophomore yearbook he was a senior) but if I ever seen or talked to him I don't remember it. Benson didn't have a very large student body at the time, but it was apparently large enough that I still to this day get friend requests on facebook from people that went there at the same time as me that I have no memory of ever even meeting. I can't remember exact population size, but my graduating class of seniors in '02 was around 225 students, if that helps a little with perspective. As far as cliques go, most people had their groups of friends that they hung out with, but I can't say that I remember all that many conflicts between any ""cliques""."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,masanova,2,Wed Jul 8 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"I had read that Jason had been bullied at times in school--it had been ongoing into his high school years, apparently due to a speech impediment of some kind, which made some people think he was of below-average intelligence (which was certainly untrue--Jason was actually above average, was a good student).  So, the high school was not very small, but not so huge where one might get ""lost in the shuffle"" or not be able to get the guidance and support when needed, perhaps.  So, it looks like Benson High was about the same size, if not somewhat larger than the high school I went to: I also graduated in 1999, with a class of 180: there were about 900 students, in four grades in my high school then.  Some have wondered if his disappearance is liked to his tormentor from school days."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,anthym29,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:29:33 2015 UTC,It's certainly possibly. I'm sure things like that happen at most high schools unfortunately.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,bsmith7028,3,Thu Jul 9 00:46:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry I just checked my yearbook again, he was a senior my freshman year, not sophomore. So apparently our time at benson only overlapped by one year, not two. It makes more sense now why we wouldn't have met. We had a particularly large freshman class that year (I seem to remember it being around 700 incoming freshmen) so I barely talked to any upper classmen."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,anthym29,6,Wed Jul 8 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"THIS. I have always been bothered by the whole without-a-trace, close-to-home disappearance of Jason and the lack of details. Was his ride/friend ever questioned? IIRC he called to say Jason hadn't shown. What was the time span between when Jason left the house and the friend called? If there is a large gap there something could have happened. Then the similarities between him and Sherman, though according to the internet Sherman himself is more of a mystery than his actual disappearance. Furthermore, where did Sherman interview? The employers must have had some info on him. Did he know Jason? Did they have mutual friends? I hope all explanations were explored.  I often wonder about Jason's friend because, like Zebb Quinn, his friend was the last to hear from him. Granted Zebb's disappearance was a bit more dramatic. You can read about that here."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,anthym29,5,Tue Jul 7 00:45:29 2015 UTC,"The co-worker (his ride) was questioned many times, more than anyone else actually, along with pretty much anyone else with ties to Jason. He never actually arrived at the high school for 10:45am and jason's boss was informed of this by 11:30-noon when he called Jason's house to ask what had happened....only Michael, the younger brother, aged 13, was home to take the massage and told the boss he had only seen Jason leave for the high school. Nobody saw him after that and the security cameras were checked at the high school--none captured him on their tapes, either.  I doubt the co-worker had anything to do with it. I think Jason was intercepted along the way, before he got onto the high school grounds...it would be nice to know the exact route he took, as there are a few possibilities and two are probably the most likely.  Both ways have an area that's secluded has you enter the back of the high school grounds.  I do not know if Sherman and Jason knew each-other...I do not think they went to the same school, either. (Jason grad. from Benson High in 1999--Sherman was a year younger but he does not show among the jr. class of that school or class of 2000). Very, very little can be found of Samuel Sherman, not even a picture of him. He's almost as mysterious as the disappearance of Jason himself! Very, very odd case."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,moneyonfire,2,Tue Jul 7 01:24:46 2015 UTC,Sherman's case haunts me more because it's almost as if he was a young drifter. Not even an article on the missing teen. Weird.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,anthym29,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:35:27 2015 UTC,"ya, that's quite possible. The few things about him I can find say he was ""staying"" at a house in the 3600 block of Bedford Ave--no mention of family, school, etc."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,moneyonfire,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:07:46 2015 UTC,"Just floating around looking for a job, maybe couch-surfing. Pretty intense lifestyle for someone so young. He could have left on his own accord. There is no evidence of foul play...just that he vanished one day."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,cheese_hotdog,2,Tue Jul 7 13:41:21 2015 UTC,Jason Jolkowski's mom is very active in the missing persons community. Maybe she would be able to get more info on Sherman?
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,CitySizedBox,2,Tue Jul 7 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"Jason's mother has to know something about the Sherman case---I mean, she not only lived in the same neighborhood, but she has been working with missing persons cases for ten years now!  I would love to see a AMA (ask me anything) with her and see what she has to say about this case...apparently even a lot of Omaha residents interviews did not know who Sherman was and he might not had been living very long in the area."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,hotelindia,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:27:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I only started hearing about Sherman very recently after following this case for a while and it doesnt seem like anyone out of his family or friends is really advocating for him or publicizing his case.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,CitySizedBox,3,Wed Jul 8 13:33:43 2015 UTC,Maybe a random act of violence and they threatened him with a weapon to get in the car. Or someone he knows so he got in the car willingly .
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,talking_taco,3,Mon Jul 6 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"I lurk on the Project Jason forums so I am familiar with the case. Mysterious and heartbreaking, especially as a parent. I always pray they get some closure."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,AlexandrianVagabond,5,Tue Jul 7 01:46:19 2015 UTC,"What I find interesting is that he was originally planning to walk to work, which was 4.5 miles away, until he was offered the ride. That seems off to me. Maybe he was trying to buy more time until people noticed he was missing."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,talking_taco,5,Mon Jul 6 17:13:54 2015 UTC,It just seems unlikely that he would accept a ride and make a meeting place if he was planning on disappearing.
UnresolvedMysteries,3caxqg,AlexandrianVagabond,-1,Mon Jul 6 17:27:12 2015 UTC,Unless there was no logical reason to refuse and not accepting it would have raised more suspicion.

UnresolvedMysteries,3cbntj,indianacrohns,6,Mon Jul 6 17:34:25 2015 UTC,The Charley Project says there is speculation she may have been pregnant. What makes them think that?
UnresolvedMysteries,3cbntj,embossedsilver,6,Mon Jul 6 18:46:18 2015 UTC,I just skimmed through six articles about the case and the charley project is the only one I've found mention that detail.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cbntj,homehealthgirl,5,Mon Jul 6 22:34:55 2015 UTC,"Yes they are the only ones who said that. They just said there was speculation that she was pregnant but no evidence so was probably just a silly rumour which is horrible to spread. She was only 13 I know it is possible but maybe they were saying that as a reason to why she'd run away or because they found a letter saying she was upset and needed to talk to her friend and the rumour she was meeting a boy. I hate the way rumours start. Like someone says oh so and so is pregnant then they tell someone and then they tell someone else and then they tell another and then before you know it everyone is saying it is true and telling others like it is fact, just because one person said it. We always believe what we hear without proof,unless the person involved tells us we shouldn't believe it. My family was the victim of a nasty rumour. My mam found out she had cancer, she was only in her 40's and was told her breasts would have to be removed, she got really depressed, she hadn't told any of us yet. She went missing, we did not know where she was for three days, she went and stayed with my granddad's brother, he had no wife or kids. He only lived like 2miles away and we talked to him on the phone probably once a week and seen him at family gatherings but never thought to look at his place for her. My granddad got drunk and didn't want to go home to my nan because he knew she'd be crying and he didn't want to go to any of us because we were upset and he just wanted time away from it all so known his brother didn't know about my mam he got a taxi to his place and who answered the door only my mam. She came home and told her husband about her illness, we still didn't know yet. We just thought they had a fight. Then came the rumours she was found in a hotel with a married man, So while he was dealing with her illness he had to deal with people even his mates he drank with in the local thinking this and asking him about it. that was the one going around the area where we lived and the local pub. when my brothers girlfriend was shopping in the super market she heard my mam was in debt and was losing the house so she left and was living on the streets, because she didn't want to face us when they came to throw us out, I have no idea how these started , like who was the first to say it and why they even thought these things. Sorry for going on I just hate how someone says something and people pass it along like it is fact, I was also guilty of this, but now I see how easy rumours are believed even by people who knew you. It does so much damage. Like if the police believed she could've been pregnant they probably wouldn't have searched as much thinking she ran away with a man because of this and not see it as a 13yr old who was taken. I really think that site should remove that bit as they said themselves there is no evidence so why even mention it it doesn't help the case in anyway."
UnresolvedMysteries,3cbntj,Eatme18,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:35:40 2015 UTC,The only thing I can think of is maybe in the letter she said that she was upset and needed to talk to a friend who she was meeting at the campsite. I honestly have no idea. It seems really out there for them to even bring that up.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cbntj,ElectricGypsy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:14:01 2015 UTC,I wondered the same thing.
UnresolvedMysteries,3cbntj,TheBestVirginia,3,Wed Jul 8 06:29:45 2015 UTC,"Here is the Charley Project entry.  I'm most inclined to think it was an acquaintance, as in an adult who knew her peripherally.  Somebody she knew from maybe minor interactions, but whom she would ""obey"" since he was an adult who she had seen with other adults and so he had a position of authority in her mind.  Even if the pregnancy rumor is true, this is too young of a girl to have legally consented to either sex or an abortion (not sure of the laws in her state at that time).  The scenario could have included both: an adult male acquaintance who had been seeing her secretively and decided to ""take care of the problem"" when she became pregnant by him.  If they have not thoroughly vetted every single adult male in her world, even (and especially) the men on the ""outskirts"" of her life,(and I doubt they did if they thought she ran away at first), they need to go back and start over.  The answer is probably there."

UnresolvedMysteries,3catxz,verifiedshitlord,16,Mon Jul 6 14:52:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure refugees & asylum seekers in the UK don't need passports. He could've also been a completely undocumented person coming illegally via another nearer European country, via boat.   This is a pretty common way to reach Europe - Britain is often seen as the final destination, as well. I don't mean this politically, just explaining that it's possible to reach the EU without a passport, without much in the way of documentation.  As for why the poor boy died, I have no idea."
UnresolvedMysteries,3catxz,alarmagent,-7,Mon Jul 6 15:27:12 2015 UTC,I don't believe it's easy to reach UK as you say..
UnresolvedMysteries,3catxz,nunocesardesa,7,Mon Jul 6 18:27:34 2015 UTC,"People trafficking and illegal immigrants entering the country is, depending on the bias of the news source, either a terrible humanitarian plight or a tsunami of benefits scroungers - both are agreed that it is quite easy to gain access to the UK.   Have a look on Google News for the illegal immigrants at Calais in France - there's some shocking news there. It's quite a problem because there's several hundred people who have gone to fight for ISIL and have returned home via non traditional routes.   It's too easy to get access to the UK, much easier than you'd suppose."
UnresolvedMysteries,3catxz,snapper1971,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:58:57 2015 UTC,There's actually a really interesting partially unresolved mystery about asylum seekers in Calais: http://www.dagbladet.no/spesial/vatdraktmysteriet/eng/  The article does a good job of explaining how people make it into the UK.
UnresolvedMysteries,3catxz,gopms,-1,Wed Jul 8 01:38:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's be clear: It is not easy to get into UK, not even with an EU passport - I am checked everytime i go there.   Let's be clearer: it's not easy to get into any EU country without passport - travelling in a ragged boat through the mediterranean sea is NOT an easy entry to EU.   The people who went to fight for ISIL that were allowed return, which I am not sure it happened so much (10.000 in how many millions?) had EU or UK passports so their return cannot be stopped and they did not come back through any illegal means - they just need to cross the border with the passport/citizenship they already have is a specific case. Like we say in Portugal - ""Não mistures alhos com bogalhos"" (Don't mix garlics with galls).  Many of the migrants you see on that link you've given are not aiming for UK, that is a misconception, even the language barrier plays a role there - many come from french speaking countries so, france is the natural target or other countries which have better asylum conditions.   Here: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics  ""In 2014, by far the highest number of asylum seekers from outside of the EU-28 was reported by Germany (203 thousand), which was two and a half times as many as the number of applicants in Sweden (81 thousand) — see Table 3. Italy (65 thousand applicants), France (64 thousand), Hungary (43 thousand), the United Kingdom (32 thousand), Austria (28 thousand), the Netherlands (25 thousand) and Belgium (23 thousand) followed. The total number of persons seeking asylum in these nine Member States accounted for 90 % of the EU-28 total in 2014.""  So no, reaching UK is neither easy nor ""often"" the final destination, and ISIL/ISIS has nothing to do with asylum seekers - citizens or people who have been given VISA by the host states who have travelled to fight in Syria do not count as asylum seekers."
UnresolvedMysteries,3catxz,nunocesardesa,5,Mon Jul 6 22:22:21 2015 UTC,"All I was trying to say is that it's possible to get into the UK without a passport, or any formal documentation from the initial country you came from. It pertains to this case because it appears (to me) that this was undocumented child from West Africa who was murdered in the UK - the only reason I brought the UK up as a final destination in the first place. It may not be the first choice, but all I said was it is 'frequently' a final destination - not always, not even 90 percent of the time. By the way, looks like Germany is the top choice for asylum seekers, not France. Probably because the job opportunities are better there, and the conditions are more welcoming."
UnresolvedMysteries,3catxz,alarmagent,2,Tue Jul 7 08:44:06 2015 UTC,"In that sense, it could be. They are not the country which accepts most though, I think, that was Sweden or Norway but I can't find the link where it said so."
UnresolvedMysteries,3catxz,nunocesardesa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:30:00 2015 UTC,Couldn't they just sneak over on a boat though? A remote French beach to a remote beach in the south east?
UnresolvedMysteries,3catxz,welsh_dragon_roar,-5,Tue Jul 7 00:37:45 2015 UTC,"I guess they could, they could also migrate from boat from Norway like the Vikings did.  There is also the physical and mathematical possibility for ringworlds to exist, yet, we've only found them in spherical shape.  UK is not the best country to live in EU and each of the European countries themselves hold different treaties, agreements with their former colonies or even just have different policies toward immigrants, so let's not just believe that the reality that we are in the streets next to our house is the reality for the whole world"

UnresolvedMysteries,3caaif,theelectricspider39,9,Mon Jul 6 09:39:22 2015 UTC,"The 2009 report of the inquiry into the loss of HMAS Sydney examined the question of the body fairly extensively, and includes a forensic examination of the exhumed remains. It makes very interesting reading, down to the details of cloth fragments found with the press studs and the piece of shrapnel found in the body's head. From the perspective of someone who has had to do quite a lot of research on Australian navy uniforms of a later era, it doesn't surprise me at all that he was wearing a non standard-issue boiler suit (nor, from my experiences in interviewing ex-RAN on what they wore a few decades ago and the variations in their memories and in photographic evidence, am I surprised that ex-servicemen's recollections on what was worn often differ and contradict each other...I've found inconsistencies like this even when the period under discussion is as near the 60s-80s).   I think we can be fairly confident, as the inquiry concluded, that this man was a sailor from HMAS Sydney. He was probably from engineering. The piece of shrapnel in his head may not have proved immediately fatal, but we can only hope he died soon. I hope that one day he is identified.   I once listened to one of the marine engineers who did the forensic analysis on the wreck give a blow by blow account of what the evidence indicated the sequence of events was Sydney during the battle. It was clinical, logical, backed up with images of the wreck and a rigid analysis from a brilliant mind. It was only towards the end that the emotion came into his story, delivered as it was without mawkishness or hyperbole, and so much more poignant for that. It was one of the most powerful narratives I've ever heard, and it chilled me to the bone. What happened to those men after the bridge was taken out, as they continued to fight on with the chain of command destroyed, hardly bears thinking about."
UnresolvedMysteries,3caaif,woebegonewobbegong,12,Tue Jul 7 03:42:41 2015 UTC,I think that this is pretty clearly an Australian sailor/soldier. And the only progress that will come out of this will be from DNA. I don't think any of the recollections of clothes or shoes will produce anything.

It was normal to have your hair curled on Saturday night for church the next morning. ugh Some people did pierce their daughters ears as infants so they won't go through the pain of it later. (never made sense to me) But putting a red rinse on a child this young or painting her nails red would have been seen as strange behavior indeed. Some girls did get perms as children, but especially the red dye was harsh, (and smelled awful) and putting it on a little girl that age would have damaged the hair as fine as most small children have. It's been possible to get bottled hair dye in the U.S. since 1906, so even though a beauty salon probably would have balked at doing it, whoever she was with could have done it with a home-kit."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c84dp,sweetcarolinagirl,8,Mon Jul 6 03:51:37 2015 UTC,"Me neither! My friends and I were hyoooge nail polish fiends all through our tweens and teens. We painted our nails ten different colors at a time and had vast collections that were constantly being traded about. (Anyone remember Hard Candy nail polish? That was the HG status brand, at $16 a pop, and that was back in '96!)   Even as young as 9 or 10 girls  in my class would have mani-pedi parties at Beautique for their birthdays. We did tend to avoid red, not because it was verboten, but because it was boring!  The only reason I can imagine any personal parental aversion to red would be - if we didn't use a base first - it would stain our nails and even our skin.  It seems a tad hypocritical to consider one shade too ""sexual"" while otherwise allowing all manner of creatively painted nails. I suppose I'm being ..what's the word (sleepy?) ... maybe cynical, or unfair.  One could view the rule as a compromise, similar to allowing your 7-th grader to wear lipgloss and some powder foundation, simple stuff like CoverGirl or a nice Clinique, but drawing the line at eye makeup, etc. until high school.  I just don't see any more overt sexuality in red nailpolish vs. magenta, purple, or neon blue.   My nieces, 12 and 9, are super into polish lately. They each have these really cute and clever nailpolish organizer baskets from Pottery Barn Kids. A far cry from my old Caboodles! ;) Anyway I'm going to ask my SIL about red and see what her opinion is, and whether there's a prevailing opinion (or not) amongst the other moms.  Very thought-provoking cultural phenomenon!  Oh, and I'm in Houston, born and raised."

I know people who come from the sort of backgrounds we call ""white trash"" (I hate the term, but I'm just using it for short hand) and it's a bit more accepted in that community to dye children's hair at any age, or to paint their nails any color. Things that to others may come off as superficial or even as being sexualized, are seen more as just bonding & playing with/encouraging the femininity of a child.  I'd also like to know if they're even sure her hair was dyed, because as I mentioned earlier in this thread I had well water when I was growing up - and the heavy iron deposited in my blonde hair and gave it a very orange/red cast.

UnresolvedMysteries,3c84dp,thismeanswarlock,15,Mon Jul 6 02:43:34 2015 UTC,"I tried to find ""Old Alamo Road"" in Congress, AZ. I didn't find anything, but did figure out that a section of Rt 93 is called Alamo Rd northwest of town. There's a little road that diverges to the east and comes back to it and I think that's Old Alamo Road, probably a leftover piece that didn't become part of the straightened out highway.  There are a couple of washes named on either side of 93, but that little side road goes through ""Black Mesa Wash"" and just south of that is ""Lower Hackberry Spring"" which seems to be on 93 itself. So there's definitely water there at least sometimes. I think Black Mesa Wash was where her body was found partially buried.  If this is the right place, then there's a huge ranch just to the southeast of the area, called ""Date Creek Ranch."" It's one of the oldest ranches in Arizona. I assume there were no missing children from the ranch, or from any other ranches in the area. This leaves me with a couple of ideas - If you continue south on 93, it becomes 60 and goes right into Pheonix and its suburbs Glendale, Peoria, and Surprise (Sun City West didn't exist yet). Definitely possible she could come from one of those places. But if you continue north on 93, you get into Kingman, and then Paradise, Henderson, and Las Vegas Nevada. Also possible she's from those places. Less likely, but still possible, is that she was from a tourist family visiting the Grand Canyon, Lake Mead or even the Prescott National Forest (or some combination of those places). It would explain why no one knew her or reported her missing. Especially if they moved to another town immediately upon returning home."

I don't see many people in those days wanting to plan their family vacation around casinos and showgirls.  Vegas was booming - the population went from 24,624 in the 1950 census to 64,405 in 1960, more than doubling - and it almost doubled again in the next decade. It's possible that resources were very stretched and the disappearance of a little girl was completely missed by authorities - whether you're talking about school, child welfare, police, etc."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c84dp,asheva13,29,Thu Jul 16 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"No, it would have been extremely odd to dye a child's hair in this time period, unless it was lightened to pass for being white when they were another race. I don't get that feeling from the the article. I also do find it interesting her nails were painted, which was something teens did in that era to be ladylike and proper but not something a pre-pubescent child would have likely  done (though it was not seen as bad). The height, baby teeth and weight exclude the likelihood she was a teen or adult though. So I find the nail polish and hair dye interesting and either a sign her identity was being obscured before she died (parental abduction, and humouring her by allowing her to do grown up things like paint her nails) or she fell into the hands of a pervert who had a deranged reason for doing this to her. I would like to know how recent the tests were done, since it is possible they are inaccurate. Maybe she was an older teen? If it was an advanced state of decomposition as this post describes, perhaps the science of the 1960s interpreted it incorrectly? For example, we have a few cases in which we only learned of the gender being wrong (for an adult or post puberty teen) in the 2000s. A good example would be the two young teens found in Mendocino Count California in 1979 - thought to be a boy and girl for years (described as lovers that ran off) until recent DNA tests showed they were both young girls: http://doenetwork.org/cases/131ufca.html is a link to the first  girl identified  and the link on Doe Network to her companion is wrong and not updated. Maybe this is another inaccurate report? If gender can be mistaken  for teenagers in the late 70s, maybe age or height/weight of badly decomposed remains could also be read wrong in the 60s."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c84dp,shoggothsinthemist,14,Mon Jul 6 00:22:18 2015 UTC,"They noted that the face was recognizable, so I'm guessing that she also looked to be a little kid - her height was measured as 42"", so I don't doubt the age range - a teen that small would have issues seen on the skeleton. She was found ""in Sand Wash/ Creek Bed on Old Alamo Road, partially buried,"" and it was the end of July - sounds like some part of her body decomposed faster than her head. I don't know if there would be water flowing at that time of year, but if she was only partially buried because of erosion and water was still flowing around her, it would have preserved the part in the water.  The difference between this and your Mendocino County Does is the Mendocino County teens were skeletal when found and that's not the case here."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c84dp,missxfebruary,7,Sat Jul 18 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"I have a small base of knowledge of identifying skeletal remains. never in the field, but I've taken classes. Sex is almost impossible to identify on a small child without DNA. Puberty is what changes the skeleton to really have any differentiation. It really is a guess based on vague size and broadness of body parts. Even adults are a little tricky. The most reliable marker is an angle of the pelvis ""wide"" is female, ""narrow"" is male... But it is so unreliable. Wide and narrow is all you got, really, and despite professions having an eye for it, it isn't specific measurements. It's possible that this child was a boy, but probably not, because of the clothes and presumably she wasn't decomposed enough to lose the ability to differentiate genitals.   Age on the other hand is really really easy in a child. The fact that she had all baby teeth means she was definitely under 7 (which is on the old side). If this girl had her first molars grown in 5-7 seems right, maybe up to 8 if those molars are totally grown in. If she didn't have first molars, she could have been as young as three or four. The first molars are colloquially the ""six year old molars."" Additionally, even without teeth, the amount of fusion of all the growth plates are decent measures of age as well -- all arm and leg bones and pelvis are good at this. In adults on the other hand are really hard to age -- teeth and bones are done growing, the only thing you've got are signs of deterioration to look at. It's hard.   Because of this, my guess is that the 5 to 7 age range is right, even without use of DNA. If anything different, she is slightly younger than that, and I would edge on younger especially since it says ""all baby teeth""."

As far as her weight, the lower range of 50 lbs is the 95th percentile at 5 years old, the 75th percentile at 6.5, or the 50th percentile around 7.5. The upper range of 60 lbs is the 95th percentile at 6 years old, 50th percentile around 9 years old.

But it would it be likely? Not at all. It would be incredibly unlikely to have a teen or adult of very small stature (around four feet tall) and without adult teeth - it just is so unlikely it isn't helpful. I imagine growth plates are able to help in identifying whether a body is a child or someone who is of small stature, although I also imagine these were not looked at as her remains were not skeletal (and I doubt X-rays were taken).

If there was a missing person out there who is reported to be and adult of childlike stature with all baby teeth, then definitely looking at UID bodies of children would be something that couldn't be forgotten. The other way around... Well, again, I never said it was impossible, but ruling out missing children should certainly come first.   A lot of the time I think these children whose bodies then up and remain unidentified are children who are entirely unrecorded (no medical records, no school records, perhaps illegal immigrants) or who have somehow been lost in a foster care system (less likely, but possible) or who have crazy abusive and manipulative parents who made sure no one knew their child was suddenly gone.

It seems really unusual to me.  I wonder if the body was dressed/prepared after death.  Perhaps this was a unintentional death and the person/s responsible then applied the nail polish/hair dye, clothing and sandals as burial clothing.  The flip flops would be much easier than shoes to put on her.  Since they were male sized flipflops this makes me wonder if at least one the persons responsible was a male.

UnresolvedMysteries,3c8jp8,justincase25,6,Mon Jul 6 09:29:25 2015 UTC,"She might have had a dental phobia. I don't know, at-home highlighting kits are not expensive, nor are piercings. Much less expensive than dental visits without insurance."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c8jp8,Bluecat72,4,Mon Jul 6 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"Sure. You have good points. But it's also the psychology of it. To show vanity, to care about appearances in some ways but not others. It may just be financial as you say, which is revealing in itself."

Also, at one point I started looking for Un-Id cases in which the victims hair had been recently highlighted/stlyed, but the over-all general condition of the body showed neglect.  A little quirk of the guy who killed her? A way to win her trust? Because I don't think this is the first time he did this."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c8jp8,justincase25,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"Probably not.   It also shows she had influences in her life: maybe a peer group, a parent/guardian who'd take her to places and pay for things. Sure, she may have had those things done at home but still- not without a motivation to do so and help.   The shirt is interesting. It is also a vanity choice. I wonder if it fit her properly, indicating it was her own, or if it seemed to belong to another. Who made it? Where was it stocked and when?   Not sure if these questions have been considered.

UnresolvedMysteries,3c8jp8,verifiedshitlord,11,Mon Jul 6 07:32:31 2015 UTC,My guess would be because of the evidence of abuse on her body  and how no one seems to have come forward with any clues.

A feeling so few of us can relate to, being labelled old news, failures, flops, or irrelevant at the ripe old age of...under 18. One of my good friends growing up was a child actor, and he has nothing but negative things to say about that world. I think he would've happily given up the money if it meant he could've had a normal life, instead. Those formative years are so important, and there is a reason why as a society we don't put children in high-pressure situations where how they perform effects the livelihoods of others, or puts them in a situation where failure will result in mockery or the same miserable feelings we as adults have when we lose our jobs...agh, makes me so sad."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c70qj,theelectricspider39,44,Sun Jul 5 13:38:25 2015 UTC,"You forgot the last paragraph! It just gets weirder.   The Investigation  The criminal investigation showed that Stoll was injured before the crash, and must have been run down elsewhere and positioned in the passenger's seat of his car and driven to the location where he was discovered. It was also concluded that he was naked at the time he was run over. Other drivers reported seeing a hitchhiker at the Hagen-Süd exit. Neither the hitchhiker nor the person in the white jacket were identified. Suspicions regarding Stoll's holiday trips to the Netherlands, where he was thought to have made contact with drug dealers, proved unfounded.  The meaning of the letters '""YOG'TZE""' remains unknown."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c70qj,bokurai,12,Sun Jul 5 21:11:10 2015 UTC,"In light of that, it sounds like he had a psychotic break, got naked, and ran out of his car into traffic.  Everything after that point is less certain, but it seems as though somebody hit him by accident, then put him in his own car, and drove him elsewhere to try and cover it up, but maybe had another accident (perhaps this individual was drunk at the time, which is why they felt they might get in trouble for a naked crazy man leaping in front of their vehicle), and had to flee the scene?  That's my take on it. The other strangeness would be explained by Stoll having some kind of undiagnosed psychiatric issues."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c70qj,Luai_lashire,16,Sun Jul 5 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"To me it looks like a crazy guy got murdered.  Those are always tough cases to figure out because you have to parse the insignificant, crazy stuff from the significant clues."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c70qj,Portponky,13,Sun Jul 5 21:47:31 2015 UTC,"Well, murdered might be a strong word. It seems like he was having a serious episode/breakdown, was likely pissed as a fart too. Discounting the crazy shit that Stoll said to everyone, the crux of this mystery lies in two factors:   He was injured before the crash. People were seen mucking about at the scene.   So firstly, he was injured before the crash. People already saw him fall down and injure himself at a pub earlier. Then he was out and about for hours unattended. He may have passed out and fallen again, he may have started a fight, he may have crashed his car once but was still able to drive it, etc., etc. There are many unsuspicious ways a crazy bastard can maim themselves without assistance.  Secondly, the eye witness stuff... eh, yeah, it's weird. Eye witness stuff is notoriously unreliable. Maybe Stoll picked up a hitchhiker then crashed, the hitchhiker was wearing a seatbelt and survived the crash with only minor injuries and for whatever reason decided to leave the area rather than get involved with a crazy guy that just killed himself with a car?  I dunno, it's interesting, but it's hardly compelling to suggest that his paranoid ramblings turned out to have any truth to them."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c70qj,Eiyran,6,Sun Jul 5 22:01:54 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but with your hitchhiker scenario, why was Stoll naked and in the passenger seat? What kind of hitchhiker gets into a car with a naked guy? And then drives the car?  It sounds to me more like he was having a psychotic break, got naked, ran into traffic, and someone who hit him was trying to take him somewhere in his own car, or stage a second accident or something. But I do agree with you that the guy's obvious psychological issues are probably at the center of this."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c70qj,0913752864,2,Sun Jul 5 23:19:13 2015 UTC,"ran into traffic, and someone who hit him was trying to take him somewhere in his own car, or stage a second accident or something.   If he ran into traffic and was hit by a car, wouldn't have there been multiple witnesses to that? also the brazenness of the driver who decided to throw the victim into the car just to cover it up?   also how would the assailant would have known which car the victim was driving? grand theft auto charges didn't phase these assailants either I suppose."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c70qj,Portponky,2,Fri Jul 10 08:57:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, I forgot the passenger seat thing. Well if the hitchhiker was driving the car and crashed it killing Stoll, that gives an excellent reason for him to leave the area.  Why would a hitchhiker be driving? Well, here's an example scenario: a drunk and crazy Stoll picks up a hitchhiker and says he is a bit drunk and would like to rest. The hitchhiker agrees to drive because driving is much better than waiting by the side of the road. After a while Stoll gets naked and starts fighting with the hitchhiker causing a crash. The hitchhiker sees that Stoll is seriously injured and bails.  Ok, that's just conjecture. This case is definitely a mystery, I'm just arguing against any sort of conspiracy angle. Like I said before, a crazy self destructive guy can end up dead in many mundane ways."

But the fact that he wrote YOG'TZE and then immediately crossed it out is so weird to me. If it was something he didn't want recorded, why would he write it down?

UnresolvedMysteries,3c70qj,Luai_lashire,4,Sun Jul 5 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"I sometimes cross out something I decide is of no significance.

UnresolvedMysteries,3c8b3r,Cecilia_Tallis,3,Tue Jul 7 21:17:23 2015 UTC,"When I first read about this, watched the movie and documentary, I also said the mother and brother know something. I was thinking the brother killed him in a rage aka fight and the mother helped him cover it. So when they said we found your son they played along to not look guilty, like they knew Nick was never coming home. Look at how Nick looked when he went missing and how they expect he'd look today and then look at Fredrick, they look nothing alike, Even different colour eyes, different looking features. He said when he seen the missing poster it was in black and white, when he seen a different picture he said ""no way will I get away with this"" So the family if they did know what happened to Nick should have played along and been happy when they were told we have Nick he is safe, but as soon as they seen him would they have looked guilty like they knew something happened Nick if they said ""he isn't my son"", ""He looks nothing like him, what is going on here"", ""how could you do this to me I was so relieved"", where is my son"". I think they would look more guilty believing this person is Nick when it was so clear he wasn't. I don't think the cops would say ""oh they don't think it is him, they killed him it's obvious"". They did not look even similar in anyway so would it have been so bad to say he isn't Nick instead of going along with it, would it have made them look suspicious?. As far as I know they didn't have  a lot of money so my boyfriend thinks they took him back for all the interviews and help they probably would have got. I don't know it is very confusing. Didn't the brother hug him and say ""I know what your doing"" or something and then never went to see him again? I read after that in 2003 and 2004 he was still conning people into thinking he was a teen when he would have been in his 30's wtf are people that stupid, talk about gullible."

Her reaction to seeing her ""brother"" again is totally different from the mother and brother.    He was a scrawny 13 when he went missing. And this con artist was 23 when he came back to the US as Nicholas. This wasn't a decade or so later. It was 1997. N went missing in 94. Oh and BTW, his eye color was different because the pedophiles who had him, chemically changed their color. I guess they also gave him a dye job and nose job. And ignored the fact their sex toy was years past puberty.  Nicholas already had a juvie record and was due in court the day after he went missing. That's why I think cops didn't do a better investigation of the family. Poor kid never had a chance."

I do also agree about the physical differences. I mean they showed his passport picture side by side his missing picture and it's not even close to the same kid. I also think Bourdin's gap in his front teeth should have been a give away too. Barclay didn't have that gap, but in 3 years he just develops it?  And the accent?"

UnresolvedMysteries,3c6per,komatachan,16,Sun Jul 5 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"Going on a tangent, but an important one.   I've met five or six adults who are functionally illiterate. Most were guys I worked with when I was young and did manual labor in the summers. Another two I met when I volunteered in a literacy center. In every case these men were very careful and clever to hide their illiteracy--one of the men I tutored hid it from his wife for twenty years. Mostly they became very, very good at memorization. They could remember lengthy instructions from their work supervisors. The guy who hid it from his wife would pretend to write down shopping lists as she rattled off the groceries they needed. Then he'd go to the store and get a cart's worth of food, never missing an item.   In each case these were men who left school at a young age and who seemed to have some sort of physical impediment which kept them from learning to read. One of the men I did manual labor with had really poor eyesight and a heavy Southern accent--I think he had trouble making sense of the differences between what he said/heard and how words were written. One of the guys I tutored had a history of terrible ear infections as a kid and spent much of his life work around heavy machinery on a farm and in a factory. He wasn't deaf, but had a lot of trouble hearing clearly.   Back to the case at hand: given that McCormick's family called his writing ""nonsense"" I doubt he came from a family in which everyone was illiterate. If he did have a psychological condition it might have impacted his ability to read and write."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c6per,Yamnana,10,Sun Jul 5 20:15:57 2015 UTC,"Good point in regards to hiding illiteracy.  My experience;  Years ago me and my first wife had a good friend.  They knew each other since being toddlers.  His name was Tommy, and I only say his name because he is deceased now.  Tommy was a hell of a guy -- Hard working, and would give anyone the shirt off his back.  He was his mother's keeper, and long story short, he married a chick his mom hated, and she removed him from her will -- Soon after, she took ill and died, and his sisters seized upon the opportunity to basically use his illiteracy against him.  He was asked to sigh things, and of course he was a prideful fellow, but certainly not a man with his hand out -- He had worked many years at the local steel mill before all those jobs went overseas, and his life was his mama -- and her house reflected his love for her.  Six months later, I'm going to the market on xmas eve to get some last-minute items for the dinner, and I see his el camino parked in the back of the store.  He wasn't inside, so I walked up to the vehicle, and could see that he was making a home in that space between the bed of the truck and the floorboards.  I took him home for xmas, and he tells me everything.  I had no idea.  Illiteracy aside, I was amazed by his ability to get by without this ability -- He was an OTR truck driver, which meant he was dealing with GPS, and those little ipad-looking tablets that OTR truck drivers used, I asked how he did it, and  he showed me that he got a few of the connective words like ""the"", ""and"" etc., he also used symbols that often accompanied messages from his dispatcher, and stuff like that.  Frankly, I was amazed both that I never knew, and that he found similar tools within himself not to replace, but at least to mitigate his deficiencies.  Tommy got hooked up with some bad folks and disappeared.  I found his name doing that every-so-often check of the local obituaries, and was sad that my old friend had died."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c6per,Portponky,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:35:56 2015 UTC,"Just my 2 cents: I am not a handwriting expert, but it appears that there are 2 types of the letter e.

The second appears to have a curved left line almost like a letter c or sideways v with a horizontal line through it.

I suppose there's a chance the guy somehow hit on the solution but sucks at explaining it, though I'd really doubt it.  Most of it seems to just ad hoc reasoning of the ""well, X could be short for xylophone"" type. It could, but it could just as easily mean X ray or chihuahuas :)"
UnresolvedMysteries,3c6per,doc_daneeka,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"You're coming in with the soft angle of ""anything's possible"" but once you open that door, any bullshit solution is valid. That is not how you decipher things.  The content of this 'solution' is just the cipher with letters replaced with words. Every 'E' is replaced with 'Episode', every 'M' with 'Morning' and every 'S' is either 'Severe', 'Serenace' or just left as 'S'. This gives rise to such gibberish as ""A Latenight Weekday Latenight Day"".  To show that McCormick's note is an acrostic cipher with reasonable certainty, the first step would be to show that the letter frequency distribution in the notes is close to the letter frequency distribution of initial word letters in English. This solution doesn't do that, and a quick eyeball of the notes strongly indicates that this is not the case and therefore this 'solution' is a step in the wrong direction.  If it were an acrostic cipher, then the only way it could be conclusively solved is by matching it to an existing text, ala the Action Line cryptogram. Otherwise, it's speculative at best, and more likely a complete guess.  So, yeah, there are fucking good reason it's not correct."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c6per,Portponky,4,Sun Jul 5 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the important point of my statements, namely that we are absolutely in agreement that this isn't in any sense a valid solution. I was quite explicit about that.  The only thing I took exception to was that you implied it is not possible that this is the actual meaning of the message. As I said, it's entirely possible that it is correct. And as I also said, there's no reason whatsoever to believe so.   I agree with everything you've said except for that.  Again, literally the only thing I disagree with is that it's impossible that this 'deciperhment' has produced the correct result. A completely invalid method can produce a correct result. Is it likely in this case? Hell no. I'd bet a large sum of money against it. The odds are staggeringly high that it's just plain wrong in every respect. But the probability that it's right is non-zero. That's it.   Edit: note also that I am making a clear distinction  here between a valid solution (which this clearly is not) and a correct one (which it may or may not be, but is almost certainly also not).  A valid solution would be one that is produced by a consistent and logically valid method. This doesn't qualify.  A correct solution would be one that equals the intended text, as understood by the author, and whether or not the method used to find it was valid. This 'solution' may or may not be correct, but I'd be utterly shocked if it were."

You can say it's valid when the method is consistent and logical, as this particular one clearly is not.  The only way you can prove that  the solution is correct is to demonstrate that no other solution could be, perhaps by confirming it with the author in some way, or by mathematical means (this would be pretty rare, admittedly), or because the method appears to be valid and the solution it generates produces a text that clearly makes sense and fits what is known about the context, author, intended audience, etc.  That last option is sort of a ""you know it when you see it"" situation, and doesn't really constitute proof as such, but in the messy real world it's often the best we can do.   The reason I've dismissed this 'solution' is, as I've pointed out several times now, because the method used is completely ad hoc. You could probably produce a thousand completely different and quite contradictory messages using that method, so it's useless, and any solutions produced by it are staggeringly unlikely to be correct. You get this with Zodiac ciphers all the time, and I dismiss them for much the same reason.  The chance that such an invalid method might end up producing the correct plaintext is vanishingly small, but nonzero."

I wonder how long she was alive following her kidnapping, and why her grandparents didn't hear her call out or anything when she was taken by the stranger?  It appears that there's almost no other information online about the case, but it seems you can order some photocopied newspaper clippings from a library. Too bad they're not available to view on the site."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c81ai,bokurai,5,Sun Jul 5 21:38:02 2015 UTC,"Looking at Google maps, from where she was kidnapped (Kansas City, KS/MO) to where she was found (Sundance, WY) looks like at the most just 2 highways - the longest would be about 12 hours.  I suspect (obviously with no proof), that the robber(s) made the trip that same evening.  He/They could have robbed other places along the way, but on the one hand, the likelihood of that seems slim, considering there was a kidnapped child too.  Police would have had a lot of time to let other stations along the way know and would have likely been more keen to suspicious stuff....   ... but judging by the article though, it looks like they reached the limit of their searching pretty quick.  Within a few months of the kidnapping, they tracked down everyone with the type of car the robber(s) were thought to have left in, but only in Kansas and Missouri.  If the car was from out of state, this wouldn't have resulted in any positive matches.  Also, they thought the car would have been driving along state route 71 (now highway 29), so they set up a lot of checkpoints along that route.  The problem is that they didn't have the correct description of the car (from the guest that returned to the hotel) for at least 10+ hours (as stated in the article ""later that afternoon"") so cops could have driven right past it (assuming the robber hadn't taken a different route, swapped cars, etc.) on the highway and not known it was the car they were looking for.

Article is located bottom middle of page that starts with ""GI on leave, hurt in auto accident, dies"") from when she was found/id'd and it looks like it was from dental records."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c7k4l,theelectricspider39,15,Sun Jul 5 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"It's such a fascinating case. I have followed it for years but do not feel the spy theory is the strongest explanation. Based on the details and the era, I suspect she may have been a drug mule. At this time in South America and the Caribbean business in cocaine and marijuana was booming (for local use and export into the West) and America had a massive hand in the local politics which helped facilitate matters. Another likely possibility is she was involved in black market antiquity dealing, this made sense a generation after World War 2 when the original thieves were dying off or getting old and needed to unload their spoils. Also, while security on ships and planes were low to non-existent, traffickers did like employing pretty white girls for an extra layer of security.   My dad was a sailor (of Caribbean background) between the late 50s and early 70s. While he was not involved in the drug scene, many other sailors were, and there has always been a close relationship at the port/harbour towns between Western/Northern Europe and South America/Caribbean. He mentioned the ladies most interested in Caribbean / Latin men were of the North Europe countries because it was considered very exotic. This could be an explanation for how the Isdal Woman came into contact with those in the drug trade.   Her being a spy of course is very possible given the time period. But the dental work in Latin America, being nicely dressed, being physically attractive, and the travelling all over random places in Europe that have less access to quality drugs make me feel otherwise. I do feel the murderers, aware of fears regarding communism and spying, may have doctored the scene to throw off the trail."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c7k4l,shoggothsinthemist,4,Sun Jul 5 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"I LOVE this mystery--I only wish I knew Norwegian so I could peruse the documents and documentaries with greater ease.  It's quite possible she was a drug runner, though I've always found it difficult to reconcile her location--not just Norway, but the PART of Norway--with someone involved in drug smuggling...and the removing labels from her clothes seems excessive, although like the fingerprints, there might have been an element of post-mortem cleanup going on.    I wonder about the lack of fingerprints--I've never heard of a spy behaving in that fashion, as a lack of fingerprints would then become a trait that would instantly identify you as someone involved in espionage.  I could see it being done postmortem, however, either by the men who killed her or by an agency that wanted to prevent her from being identified.  Were fingerprints taken by customs in those days?  Or when traveling between European countries?    She seems like a good candidate for exhumation and genetic testing, for no other reason than to try and get a bead on where she was from, who her possible ancestors were, and if she was of possible Jewish descent.  One of the more entertaining ideas I've heard is the idea she was a Mossad agent involved in tracing Nazis hiding in South America (thus explaining the dental work).  As for why she was in Europe...if South American Nazis were selling off valuables via connections to the European countries she'd visited, penetrating such a network might help tracking them down, especially if there was a lot of liquidating of assets and abandoning old hideouts in the aftermath of the Eichmann ""extraordinary rendition"".  I've also heard a reverse theory--that she was a South American-born Nazi sympathizing agent sent to sell off various illicit goods on behalf of Nazi ""clients"" and was either liquidated by them, by frightened dealers, by anti-Nazi intelligence agencies, etc.    Also...while I have NO knowledge of dental techniques, dental history, etc,  I wonder what exactly the idea that her dentistry was ""south american"" is based on.  The metals used in her fillings?  The techniques used to fill cavities?  I'm asking this because I find it hard to believe that such techniques were localized not to one country or certain countries but to an entire continent, especially given the disparity between various South American nations.  It'd be like saying her dental work appeared African.  Certain countries might lean towards the idea of her as a spy, while others might point towards the drug smuggling thesis."

He might have a ""dumping ground"" that hasn't been found yet.  Chaining a person to a tree and doing what they think he did...this guy is sick and a danger to society IMO."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c3vk7,TheBestVirginia,5,Sun Jul 5 05:29:37 2015 UTC,"He wouldn't be on top of the list here because we were talking about killers who have gone unidentified. But, yeah, Conahan's almost definitely killed more than officially recognized."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c3vk7,Psychopath-,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:28:56 2015 UTC,The Fort Myers 8 killer has not been identified.  Conahan is suspected but hasn't been charged or proven.  I think he was only convicted of one murder and one attempted.
UnresolvedMysteries,3c3vk7,TheBestVirginia,2,Sun Jul 5 15:29:21 2015 UTC,"Yes... but we were talking about unidentified killers with the highest victim count, and the two I named had more than eight, which is why I didn't mention the FM8. If you consider that Conahan is the killer of the FM8, then his victim count does top ONS or LISK but he's no longer unidentified.  Conahan got the death penalty for one murder (and a life sentence for kidnapping, I think). He was initially arrested for the Burden attempted murder but when they searched his house they were able to link him to victim Montgomery and when they charged Conahan with Montgomery's murder, they dropped the attempted murder charge."

I heard some theories about a group trying to destabilise the Belgian government because it was turning too ""leftist"" (maybe with help from the gladio groups), others about trying to destabilise it because they wanted to split the country in two... The gang didn't get a lot of money from these high profile raids (esp. gun violence is quite rare here) that'd attract lots of police.  I think the most logical explanation is that the group blackmailed the supermarkets to give them money because else they'd create a lot of bad publicity."

The one thing that stands out about their last attack was that they killed a huge amount of people compared to all their previous attacks.  8 people were killed on their final attack.  The next highest after that was 3 on a previous instance, while the average seems to be about 1 or 2 per attack."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c1tnc,AtomicPunk,5,Sat Jul 4 03:23:57 2015 UTC,Definitely a sad case. The imagery of the scene from the articles I've read gives me goosebumps. The thought of doing your job in a remote area and being overpowered by two strangers out to do you harm horribly chilling. The driver's side door was hanging open; perhaps she was almost able to escape.   I also feel very bad for her husband. Apparently a note was left on his door from someone at the power station that urged him to call  because his wife had been kidnapped. Imagine coming home to that note :(
UnresolvedMysteries,3c1tnc,WeHaveAView,6,Sun Jul 5 17:49:05 2015 UTC,She's the one people have suggested looks like the girl taped up in the van with the little boy.

UnresolvedMysteries,3c1tnc,Pete_the_rawdog,2,Sat Jul 4 01:19:50 2015 UTC,"She looks like a much closer match than Tara to me as well. But she was born in '59, abducted in '87...her small frame/weight could contribute to her looking so young but do you think it's all that likely?

UnresolvedMysteries,3c1tnc,vulpe_vulpes,2,Sun Jul 5 12:30:27 2015 UTC,"I could go either way on it really being her. It's such a mysterious picture for it to be found 26 years ago and we still know nothing for certain about it.  I want to believe that it is someone we know is missing and will be solved one day. . . But I don't think it's very likely to happen at all.   I think if it is a missing person, like Julie Weflen, that the reason it's never been confirmed  by someone close to the missing because the picture looks like most generic brunettes.   As a generic brunette myself I could put tape on my mouth and would look similar to the polaroid.     To sum it up, I'm not sure who it may be but I want to believe."

They look more indifferent. And why would the kidnapper take a photo? If they did they would have to be a lot more careful than that. Take the photo and just drop it for anyone to find? And they drove off immediately after. But say it was a prank, they could not say it was due to the massive affect it had. They might be jailed or fined for something that large.  Just my thoughts on it."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,Cidiot,35,Fri Jul 3 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a case of low blood sugar? There's no mention of diabetes but it could've been undiagnosed. My brother has insulin-dependent Juvenile Diabetes. He had an incident at a family dinner where I first only noticed he was quiet while my aunt stole his fries - which he wouldn't let go by without comment.  I looked at his face and he was rigid, staring straight ahead, only his eyes would widen now and again, and beads of sweat were appearing on his forehead. He held his fork straight up in one hand and never dropped it. I said his name, shook him, then said his name louder and louder until I jumped up, knocking my chair over, and the whole family burst into action.   My aunt tried getting him to swallow some Coke, which he couldn't. We were at a hotel restaurant gathered for a family wedding, and as my mother got the waiter to call 911 since we didn't know the address, a cousin shot out the door, vaulted a stair rail, and ran to a fire station just up the street he'd passed on a morning run earlier that day. It was them who came and brought my brother around. He said he didn't remember a thing beyond coming down from our hotel room for a (apparently too late) late lunch, then woke up surrounded by EMTs.   He stared ahead, was rigid, and held onto that fork for throughout the entire incident, which lasted, from when I noticed at least, several critical, long minutes. Seems like such a thing could have happened to the driver.  Just a thought."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,meglet,7,Sat Jul 4 07:19:46 2015 UTC,"I think this theory is interesting because it could account for him not releasing the dead man's switch (lever) even though he lost consciousness.

UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,TheBestVirginia,5,Sat Jul 4 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if my experience is relevant, but I'll share it and perhaps it will be.  I don't have diabetes.  I never have been diagnosed with it or even considered for it outside of a few symptoms that line up with it (which are common and symptoms of thousands of other things), and my blood work has never indicated diabetes.  However, I have had several serious ""episodes"" that seem to be related to food intake and seem to mimic some diabetic-type symptoms.  Sometimes when I have a large meal that is high in starches/sugars, about 30-45 minutes afterwards I will become extremely faint.  To the point of passing out.  it can come on suddenly, and I can't fight it.  When it happens, I have to pull over and actually go to sleep in my car for a while to get past it (I travel for work, my car is my office).  It's a sudden onset of extreme faintness and exhaustion and even high amounts of caffeine can't stop it.  I guess my point is that for me, it is possible to have some diabetic-type reaction to sugars and carbs without actually being diabetic."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,justincase25,3,Sun Jul 5 05:54:07 2015 UTC,We only know that he recently drank milk before the crash. It's frustrating that his last meal doesn't reveal much.

Men in those days didn't always feel comfortable seeking assistance for any kind of illness, let alone depression and depression can be hidden. We don't know much about his life.

I googled this to back it up, but I couldn't find it again. I agree that a tox screen 4 days post mortem is probably not going to be reliable, but I wanted to throw out another possibility.

UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,alarmagent,8,Fri Jul 3 20:30:01 2015 UTC,"Excellent writeup. I've been involved off and on with software safety for 20 years and this will always be a classic - a system worked as designed and the design accounted for all reasonable failure modes, yet it still failed catastrophically.  I am not convinced by the ""drunkenness"" or ""suicide"" theories; the evidence is contradictory for the first and weak for the second. (Compare the Germanwings crash where, with the benefit of hindsight, there were red flags all over the place).  My big question is that, if someone has a stroke, could muscle tone be maintained in some unlikely circumstance? I suggest that the driver had a small stroke in a crucial part of the brain and was just able to hold things together for long enough so as not to let go of the dead man's handle. (If the stroke had been ""normal"" the driver would have let go of the handle and there would have been either no accident or a much less severe one)."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,Cecilia_Tallis,13,Sat Jul 4 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"Suicide. Doesn't matter that his family says they were unaware of any potential depression or illness. I've struggled with mental illness for the majority of my life. It isn't ""apparent"" to most of my family because my immediate family simply refused to acknowledge until this year, and they shamed me into not telling our extended family.  Im also not surprised that he had money for a big purchase later. Unfortunately, I've had great days, regular days and suddenly been in (what seems like) a crisis and a switch flips and I've felt like my only option was suicide. It's hard to believe how sudden it can happen, but when someone has a mental illness, sometimes they have a hare trigger, and their perception is different, and illogical. So what makes no sense to everyone else, seems like a viable option for the sick person."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,N0_Soliciting,4,Fri Jul 3 23:25:52 2015 UTC,The only thing that causes me to rethink the suicide angle is that he would take a full train of over 100 people with him. Just because you're suicidal doesn't at all mean you're homicidal. It seems a bit much -- couldn't he have committed suicide via train by waiting until it was empty?
UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,prof_talc,3,Sat Jul 4 16:25:25 2015 UTC,"Well of course suicide doesn't mean you're homicidal,  and I don't mean to imply all suicidal people wish harm on others. I was just pointing out how fast and certain the prospect of killing yourself can take over. It's very plausible he committed suicide, regardless of the people on board. Look at germanwings flight 9525. It's been pretty certainly decided Lubitz deliberately crashed"
UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,JakeGrey,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:40:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I see what you mean. You make a good point about how impulsive suicide can be.
UnresolvedMysteries,3c0h4e,waffenwolf,2,Sat Jul 4 22:12:23 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree, just because most suicides that are done in destructive, 'I'll take you all out with me' ways are usually done by people who've exhibited pretty obvious mental illness or severe depression in the past - Germanwings is a perfect example, really. The red flags are all there in hindsight, but we can't find them on the Moorgate driver.  Like you said, it's a leap to go from killing yourself to killing dozens of others at the same time. It's the kind of leap that someone who can't hide their instability takes."

The layout and lighting scheme at Moorgate looks a lot like another station that isn't a dead end, he's got a lot on his mind with his daughter's 18th(?) birthday coming up, he might have snuck a quick nip or two of his preferred tipple to keep the cold out on his way to work...   I've never travelled from Moorgate, so I don't know how much of a gap there is between the end of the platform and the tunnel wall, but those trains move pretty fast; 1938 stock are rated for 45MPH on the surface.

UnresolvedMysteries,3c04oz,octopusdixiecups,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:36:11 2015 UTC,"That's what I would've thought. However in New Zealand atm, there's a case of a missing boy, Mike Zhao-Beckenridge. His mother divorced his step father and due to some strange (undisclosed) behaviour, court ruled Mr Beckenridge could not have partial custody of his step son. He was very upset about this and apparently Mike was upset too. On march 13, he abducted Mike from school and there haven't been any confirmed sightings since. Beckenridge's car was found crashed in the ocean from atop a cliff. It was suspected originally that Beckenridge  committed murder-suicide to get back at his ex wife. However given the weather being atrocious, the car could not be retrieved for over a month after being found, and when it was, neither the step father nor the step son's remains were in the car. Therefore it looks like they likely boarded a ship to another country and disappeared from there. The thing was the family had lived in Dunedin and Invercargill, which may not even count as cities to the rest of the world (lol not sure) but there's no way that far south that they could still be there and not have been seen: it is mostly rural and they would be unable to live away from infrastructure given the possessions they left with and how freaking cold and inhospitable that part of the country can be. Also the media coverage of this case ended abruptly with no disclosure on what has happened, which I find weird, as it's concerning a missing minor.   So given the obvious thing seems to be that they sneaked off overseas, I don't understand why this boy is not listed as missing by our police, nor Interpol."

"" In 2012, Larry had given his power of attorney to his new wife, who was also in jail now. After being in jail for a bit and getting off of her drug addictions, she starts thinking clearly. She is MAD at Larry for letting her take a 12 year rap for things found in their house, a house they shared. Dawnica has lots of time to think. She gave her power of attorney to a friend of hers, Lori Struthers. . Lori, while looking for some of her personal belongings at the house that Larry and Dawnica shared in Concrete, Washington, found a backpack in Larrys attic. The back pack appears to contain some serious blood stains. It also appears to be the same back pack that Larry used during the hike in 2010, when Patti went missing. The back pack was given to Pattis Son and in turn he turned it  over to the Skagit County Sheriffs Office for DNA testing. This new evidence brought some renewed media interest and again, Pattis name and story was on Tv. This has brought us some renewed hope once again.  Larry found out his new wife was talking and co operating with FIND PATTI KRIEGER and he has since revoked her power of attorney. He gave his power of attorney to his family member, Matt Robinson, who was also on the mountain with them the day Patti went missing. Matt and the rest of Larrys relatives who were on the mountain have been less than co operative in our efforts to find Patti or her remains.""  I can't seem to find any info of DNA test results or if they were even done.   Interesting the boyfriend (now in jail) has some rather telling tattoos. Tear drops on the face and the police code for criminally insane on his neck.  And one of people that were on the mountain that day that wasn't a family member and who is not living in Larry's house rent free (while he is in prison), killed herself.  I think there should have been a more in depth investigation of the scumbag boyfriend. Before she went missing, Patti repeatedly found Larry to be in possession of a gun (he was a felon) and drugs. He blew up the second time she found his gun and requested he get rid of it. She also expressed to more than one person, she thought Larry would kill her instead of moving him and his criminal friends off her property."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,ittakesaredditor,3,Sat Jul 4 13:07:46 2015 UTC,"The back pack appears to contain some serious blood stains. It also appears to be the same back pack that Larry used during the hike in 2010, when Patti went missing.   This implies either a seriously stupid criminal or it's not human blood. Or it is and he keeps souvenirs, in which case there are probably more skeletons in his closet.   Also, unless someone took the dog with them, tied it up and starved it. If it was found remotely near the site she was last scene, it's likely she fell off something, died and the dog stayed wit her till it couldn't anymore. Dogs like Rotts, Dobbies, GSDs, BMs don't take too kindly with people being aggressive with their human (most of them bond to just one person). And they're fiercely loyal which lends more credit to the theory that Bear stayed by her body till he couldn't.   Suicide can come from multiple reasons, not necessarily covering up a murder, it could have nothing to do with the case at all. As for Larry, it sounds like he's a career criminal but a career criminal is far from being a murderer and you know what they say. ""The only way to keep a secret between 3 people is if 2 of them are dead."" There's NO WAY, a group of 5 people could have kept a murder secret for more than a year.  And honestly, if the family were hostile with Larry from the start, that could have a big role to play in his lack of cooperation. No one likes being accused of murder publicly.   As for the way they treated her possessions, they might have known she wasn't coming back but they might not necessarily be responsible for her death. If a number in the group were sketchy creatures, they would likely not report an accidental fall, because given the type of witnesses the cops were dealing with, it would have turned into a murder investigation pretty quickly. And people with multiple run-ins with the law tend to not like police attention on them, period.  I say they witnessed her accidental death (she's fit but an inexperienced hiker, doesn't sound like she knew the area well...not necessarily well-dressed for the activity and outdoor survival...it just sounds like she either wandered off and died from exposure or fell off one of the switchbacks, it does look like some exposure is involved), knew if they reported it that it would look suspicious because of their criminal history, decided not to and basically lived life at large at the expense of a dead woman for as long as they could. Scumbags for sure, murderers maybe not."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,hectorabaya,20,Sun Jul 5 07:37:32 2015 UTC,"I think it seems most likely that she fell victim to an accident. An inexperienced hiker who apparently isn't carrying any gear and is underdressed, upset about something, wandering off on a side trail (a game trail is also a likely possibility if there's only one trail up the mountain)...it's just such a perfect recipe for a wilderness accident.  The cover-up theory doesn't make sense to me, because what kind of accident would make them afraid to tell the police where she was? And the murder seems unlikely too, since everyone reports her going off alone and her boyfriend staying with the group. They'd all have to be accomplices. Plus they did report her missing (since the police already had a missing persons report from the day she went missing, it must have been the group), which seems like an odd thing for people trying to conceal a crime to do.  I think that people having her personal effects is a bit of a red herring. It doesn't sound like she was carrying a pack, and she was wearing jeans. If I was hiking in those conditions, I'd probably give people with more secure pockets/bags my license and keys to carry too, so I didn't have to have them in my pockets and be worrying about losing them. Especially if she planned ahead and didn't want to carry her purse, and like many women only had a larger wallet that doesn't fit comfortably in your pockets anyway.  Her boyfriend sounds scummy as hell, but her getting lost or injured and dying of natural causes just seems far more likely than murder in this case."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,hectorabaya,10,Fri Jul 3 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially considering it was a very large group to all be accomplices.  I think something that does make the murder theory more palpable is if you consider the four hour time gap. Two of them (Pressley and one of his relatives) went and allegedly got beer and burritos while the others grocery shopped. As far as I was able to find there was no official statement on where exactly the members were, and for four hours nonetheless.  Logically wouldn't you wait for someone you thought was separated from the group? Or even if you had someone who really had to go to the bathroom or needed to get something to eat, wouldn't you head straight back to the mountain? Why (possibly) leave her there for four hours?"
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,hectorabaya,9,Fri Jul 3 15:55:09 2015 UTC,"That was a big sticking point for me too, but it could be explained by them being annoyed with her for heading off alone, not realizing the danger she was in and thinking she had her cell phone and would call when she gets back to the parking lot (assuming for a moment they didn't realize that her phone was back at the house). I mean, they don't seem like the most levelheaded or responsible people, so I could picture them heading off to get something to eat, drink some beer and then going, ""Holy shit, it's been four hours! Where is she?"" I've seen people do that before. It always kind of boggles my mind, but people can be pretty dumb."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,savahontas,5,Fri Jul 3 16:13:59 2015 UTC,"From some of the reports I got the vibe that cell phone may have been purposefully left; perhaps because they were spreading ashes and she felt it was the respectful thing to do?   but people can be pretty dumb.   Honestly, based off what I know about her boyfriend I don't find it that shocking that he would find it funny/acceptable to leave her there for four hours while they went off."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,athennna,10,Fri Jul 3 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, based off what I know about her boyfriend I don't find it that shocking that he would find it funny/acceptable to leave her there for four hours while they went off   Yeah, absolutely, maybe he was mad and was punishing her for running off. Like, let her sit in that parking lot while we get beer/burritos and see how she likes it. Thank you for posting, this is a new one for me. If I have learned anything from this sub it is to take the woods VERY seriously."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,BiscuitCat1,5,Fri Jul 3 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the lie could be to do with why she left the group. If she had an argument with the boyfriend and stormed off, that would explain why he left without waiting for her, and why he took a while to report her missing - he thought she was just cooling off and would come back in her own time. Then, when he did report it, he didn't want to admit to the argument in case it made the police suspicious that he'd killed her. And the other people in the group might not have witnessed the argument, so they accepted his explanation that she left because she became emotional - explaining the whole 'five people can't keep a secret' thing and why no one's come forward with the truth since."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,jilliefish,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe they thought if she died they wouldn't get anything, but if she was ''missing"" they'd have time to steal her belongings. It sounds like she was wealthy, multiple cars, etc."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,hectorabaya,8,Wed Jul 8 10:02:58 2015 UTC,Very interesting. I'm not sure what to think as to what happened to her. Can't believe the boyfriend just left for all those hours without making sure she was ok.
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,helenayo,5,Fri Jul 3 15:43:06 2015 UTC,"Aw, I can't help but feel bad for the dog. He was likely with her when she died.  I really hope her family finds answers. I wouldn't doubt if it turned out she was murdered. Leaving someone on a mountain for 4 hours is really messed up, and if the boyfriend was separated from the group for most of that time, I can see him going back to find her.... Maybe yell at her for leaving the group and eventually kill her.  But still, even if that happened you wouldn't expect the dog to be lost for so long. Hm."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,shuttlecox,5,Sat Jul 4 22:05:12 2015 UTC,"The dog being found in poor condition in that area actually was the factor that really topped me over into thinking this was an accidental death where the scummy boyfriend just took advantage, honestly. I've been on a few suicide/accidental death calls where a dog stuck by the body until it (the dog) was near death. I guess it's possible in a murder, but i  figure Bear would follow someone he trusted (Pressley), or that a murderer trying to conceal evidence would remove the dog (and again this is a dog that knows the alleged murderer, so that should be easy). It just doesn't seem likely that someone could kill her, get what? 4-5 other people to stay quiet for years, and get her dog to stay out there without tying the dog up or something."

UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,dragged2death,10,Fri Jul 3 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"I definitely appreciate a longer post with a lot of details, as opposed to a here's a link and not much else type post."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,lemonquartz,4,Sat Jul 4 01:50:20 2015 UTC,Thanks!
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,luckylindyswildgoose,5,Fri Jul 3 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"I have to go with the most logical conclusion with this one. Patti most likely got lost and succumbed to the elements. It makes the most sense. Even if she was fit, even a small accident (sprained ankle, twisted knee) is much more likely to be life threatening for a 65-year-old out in nature. Also Bear being found on the mountain nearly a month later proves that even with searches, things are easily missed.   Even with that being said, her boyfriend obviously is a piece of work, who handled the situation completely wrong. Possibly their story about Patti walking off on her own isn't the whole truth... Maybe they walked way ahead of her because she was having trouble/going slow? They figured they'd go to the store and then return to the parking lot instead of waiting for her? That would imply some guilt on their parts."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,asafoetida,3,Sun Jul 5 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"She was definitely not an experienced hiker, which would explain why she might have taken what she thought was a trail when it was just a worn spot from people avoiding switchback."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c00m2,asafoetida,3,Sun Jul 5 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"I hiked this trail about a year ago. All I could think of was, how can someone possibly get lost here? The trail is very obvious. It's a short hike on a fairly small mountain. The majority of the trail is in the open as opposed being in the trees. However, there is another trail that spurs off from it near the top though it clearly goes down the other side to a small lake below. I really don't think she's on that mountain."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c19pm,ForensicIz,15,Fri Jul 3 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"I'm with the authorities, I think they're dead.   Can I just say though, that since becoming fully immersed in this sub, I'm suspicious of everyone. Just now, walking my dog I saw this man pull over and talk to this kid on his bike. The guy followed the kid home so he could put his bike away, he then got in the car with the man, and drove away. I wrote down the freaking license plate because I got a weird feeling about it. It was probably his uncle."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c19pm,ronniejean1,4,Fri Jul 3 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. This sub and letsnotmeet have made me a paranoid person.  I always feel like with cases like this, adoptive parents not informing the police the children are missing and continuing to cash the checks instantly says ""dead"" to me. I don't know who would care about children so much they'd go out of their way to bring kids into their home, who already have had it rough, and not completely freak out when the kid went missing. Even if the kid ran away and I knew it. It would be my job as a parent to do everything in my power to bring that child home to work out any issues they may have and keep them safe. While I know several loving adoptive and foster parents personally and don't believe the system as a whole is awful, something seriously needs to be done within the system to stop this kind of thing."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c19pm,lilmonstertruck,4,Sat Jul 4 09:34:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this happens so often. Horrible people adopt kids just for the regular checks for having them. They neglect the kids or abuse them in one way or another because all they care about is that check. there's no one there to stop them and they manage to get paid to basically abuse or neglect these kids. It's horrible."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c19pm,Thesevendaytheory,6,Sat Jul 4 09:43:08 2015 UTC,"A good friend of mine went through the entire process to foster and then adopt a pair of brothers, the youngest being an infant at the time and the eldest being about 2. While I don't know the entire story of their biological parents because she didn't want to put the boys business out there, I do know the whole process was incredibly emotionally draining and she was in court constantly for almost two years. The state was not messing around with the boys safety. I don't understand how some children slip through the cracks and others don't. It's so sad."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c19pm,lilmonstertruck,6,Sat Jul 4 09:49:49 2015 UTC,Yep... I was adopted at three years old out of a bad situation and my adoptive parents were constantly in and out of court and had random house checks and all that. Then they got stuck with me for a kid and they didn't even get a check every month. I think they got shafted.
UnresolvedMysteries,3c19pm,Psychopath-,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sadly it does. Just so messed up. I remember a few years ago we were riding into the neighborhood on the school bus and the side road was a news scene. Turns out this little girl (Alexis Glover) was killed by her foster mom and ditched in a creek in the woods by my house. The mom skipped town but they eventually found her. Scary thing to me is that I was walking my dogs to the top of the side road the night before, and I could've been the one that found her."
UnresolvedMysteries,3c19pm,bbyjp,5,Mon Jul 6 03:49:24 2015 UTC,The foster parents sound like pretty scummy people. My best guess would be that they killed them and hid their bodies or gave them up to somebody who put Austin and Edward in a bad situation.
UnresolvedMysteries,3bzeqs,mtvee,6,Fri Jul 3 11:34:41 2015 UTC,"It seems a young man got away with murder. It is strange that no one can identify, name, or even confirm the existence of the new man she was apparently dating before this occurred. Without finding the skeleton, I doubt this case will ever be solved."
UnresolvedMysteries,3bzeqs,HomelessBurrito,3,Fri Jul 3 13:51:46 2015 UTC,"It's a strange one, as the 'thin-air' cases tend to be"
UnresolvedMysteries,3bzeqs,homehealthgirl,4,Fri Jul 3 15:29:59 2015 UTC,"I find it really interesting that there are only seemingly rumors that she left with a young man that night:   the suggestion that she left her apartment on that notable day in the company of a young man who has never been identified and who has never come forward to authorities.   And yet they definitely seem to think it was a homicide, at the very least foul play. Not too much information is known though."
UnresolvedMysteries,3bzeqs,Duckspeedwell,3,Fri Jul 3 16:24:29 2015 UTC,It's incomprehensible that people can just vanish from an otherwise normal life and day in a well populated area without leaving a single ripple.
UnresolvedMysteries,3bzeqs,avalon18,5,Fri Jul 3 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, I grew up in K-town and I've never heard about this. Very interesting."
UnresolvedMysteries,3bzeqs,sinenox,2,Sat Jul 4 03:58:20 2015 UTC,"I never heard of this, and am a fellow Brock U alumni myself. So very sad, but an interesting read. Thanks for sharing!"
