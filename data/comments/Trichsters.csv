Trichsters,3dwqbk,ginopono,2,Mon Jul 20 04:13:49 2015 UTC,"Take a quick look at my album (I feel like I am a more 'advanced' puller than yourself). 27yo male: http://imgur.com/a/BihOA  Your skin can scar for all kinds of reasons. I think repetitive actions can cause scars, but I couldn't find anything good with a quick google. I can see a lot of scarring when I shave (but I actually dig at my face with needles).   You do irritate the skin when you pull our hairs, making the other hairs more 'enticing', thus pulling out others. Newer hairs will grow funny and then become more enticing themselves... a very vicious cycle.   If you haven't already I would check out some techniques for dealing with actual skin problems over at: /r/SkincareAddiction, /r/CompulsiveSkinPicking and /r/CalmHands.   Good luck and feel free to send me a message if you have further questions."
Trichsters,3dwqbk,codhopper,2,Mon Jul 20 07:53:43 2015 UTC,"I can vouch for all of that!  And looking at your pics, it's uncanny. You could be me. Albeit, having made some great progress. I'm still in the thick of it, so constantly dealing with a lot of fresh wounds (that telltale star-shaped sore, no?), discoloration, and puffiness.  To OP: I'm not seeing anything that would suggest permanent scarring either. You've got some redness and what look to be bumps, but I can't imagine actual scar tissue developing if you aren't breaking the surface. There might be some hyper-pigmentation - that's just the skin's natural response to trauma. It takes some time, but goes away on its own (assuming you aren't re-traumatizing the area). And yeah, seconding /r/SkincareAddiction for tips if you want to help the process along.  It really does become a vicious cycle. I started out pulling w/ tweezers alone, then it progressed to probing with a needle, and now the hair on my face (cheeks) just doesn't grow properly anymore. It always goes sideways instead of straight out, inviting more pulling/picking, further damaging the follicles, rinse, repeat.   The skin's ability to heal itself is remarkable. But it has limits, as I'm learning in the process of trying to assess just how much damage I've done over the years."
Trichsters,3dwqbk,Half-Invented,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"Scarring for me has been primarily from either a) digging into the skin to get an ingrown or super short hair which creates a scab OR b) the pore gets infected from me picking at it and I get a zit which I pop and do other gross things to.   I don't think tweezing or pulling on its own generally causes scarring, it's when you really traumatize the skin."
Trichsters,3dtrct,_dick_worm_789,5,Sun Jul 19 11:19:47 2015 UTC,Hey if it helps anyone who picks eyebrows alot I found these eyebrow molds on this app. called Wish.

Trichsters,3dhm7m,_meow_meow_meow,2,Thu Jul 16 10:56:59 2015 UTC,Good for you. Immediately after I read this I bent mine out of shape and tossed them. I just shaved my head short again and I'll actually go at it with tweezers. Same with my bikini line. That area is actually really scarred up from digging for Ingrowns with a pin. (Saying it out loud is actually grossing me out) and because the skin is so thick now from all my picking I get constant Ingrowns. I will have to see a dermatologist to fix this I think which may be a good idea for you too if you're concerned about your scars... Have you tried bio oil?   We can do this. its like quitting smoking. Do not go buy that pack ( tweezers ). As soon as you do you're off the wagon again. Treat yourself to getting your eyebrows threaded instead of waxed. ( oddly satisfying for us pullers ) my roommates are trying to help me so if I have a stray hair on my brows I ask one to get it for me. It hurts when somebody else does it and then it kind of kills the urge and you don't trance out.   We have a wicked support network on here! Start counting. Today is my day 1 as well.

Nobody really knows if you can burn your hair off with it, I'm sure you can, but they never really think too hard into it. This may not work for long periods of time though. I like to think I'll quit pulling and grow my hair back before they figure it out."
Trichsters,3d9gh5,wayfaring_stranger_,4,Tue Jul 14 15:22:12 2015 UTC,"I do this too. I haven't stopped completely but I'm a lot better now than I used to be. For me, pulling towards the end of the hair shaft was a way to keep me from pulling at the root. Honestly, the only thing that really helped was being self-aware about when I started pulling. Like if I'm driving or watching tv, autopilot tasks like that make me more likely to pull, so I kept stopping myself whenever I'd catch myself in the act. Finding ways to keep my hands busy at red lights and at home helped me too.   Hope this helps, OP. As for your left-side mullet, you could always go get your hair trimmed into a new style. That could give you that ""fresh start"" feeling that might motivate you even more to stop."
Trichsters,3d9gh5,Nicolioli21,3,Tue Jul 14 16:03:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, this all I do. I like the feeling of thick, coarse hair between my nails and let it break off at a weak spot. Had a spot on the back of my head on the left side that was about an inch long. I no longer due it as often as when I was younger, but my triggers are definitely stress, depression and when my hair hasn't been washed in a few days because I had straightened it."
Trichsters,3d9gh5,starstruck429,2,Tue Jul 14 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this will even help your situation...but recently, I have been trying to keep my hair as wet as possible. At home I keep it wet and down...at work it's damp and I can pull most of it up in a bun(it took me a few weeks or so because my hair is really short at the crown and right side...)  BUTTT I've noticed I don't play with my wet hair because I can't feel the course-ness of it an I can't really separate it to pull. Like I said, idk if it helps but it's been working recently for me. Good luck and keep us updated if you find a solution or something that works well for you!"

Trichsters,3d9gh5,count_scoopula,2,Wed Jul 15 05:01:19 2015 UTC,"Do you sort of twirl and twist the hairs? A ""tangle"" toy might be a helpful distraction/substitute to play with. It didn't help much with my pulling, but I pull because of the sensation it makes on my scalp, that quick sharp pinch. Maybe you'll have a better time with it because it sounds like you play with your hair because it's compulsive to mess with something with your hands and your hair became a satisfying target. I'm just sort of wildly speculating though so if that doesn't sound helpful, I'm sorry, haha."
Trichsters,3d9gh5,lurrz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yes I do this too, also just with my left hand so I usually have a big short patch on the left side, I just got it cut much shorter now though so it looks OK for the moment. I also pull out my eyebrows so I'm sure it must be related to trich in some way. I tend to be triggered by stress and lack of activity."
Trichsters,3d1r0j,Bread_Heads,5,Sun Jul 12 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"I use the app streaks to monitor my progress.  Not sure if it's the same thing, but it can be helpful, especially once you get momentum you want to keep the streak of not pulling going."
Trichsters,3d1r0j,gilbertlaroo,2,Sun Jul 12 20:59:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comment! I had been looking for app but couldn't find one I liked. I'll check it out!
Trichsters,3d1r0j,cptrafiki,3,Sun Jul 12 21:07:01 2015 UTC,"I also used streaks as a way to monitor my progress but it actually turned out to be really unhealthy for me because when I did pull, knowing I had to go back to the beginning I would have a crazy pull binge because I screwed up anyway so I might as well get all the tempting hairs out that had been driving me crazy. It's totally irrational I know but it got me every time. I like the method you are using to keep going on and mark how many hairs you pulled. There was another method I read online that I can't remember the name now but you put a smiley face on every day you don't pull and then rate the other days from 1-10 on your own personal scale of how good or bad that day was for pulling. For some people a 1 would be pulling 5 hairs and for others it might be just touching your hair in a trichy way. Thanks for sharing your strategy!"
Trichsters,3d1r0j,gilbertlaroo,2,Mon Jul 13 13:58:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response! You're exactly right--I was worried about getting too discouraged if I had to start over (let's be real) everyday. I like the rating scale--I might have to find that too!
Trichsters,3d1r0j,redydg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"What helps me is if I pull one day but can get myself to stop after a few hairs/minutes, I will ""cheat"" and allow myself to continue the streak the next day if I continue to not pull.  If I just keep pulling the next day, then I start over.   Helps a little to keep me on track and not beat myself up if I slip a little."

I've been struggling with trich for years, and I kept cutting my hair shorter to hide the damage/unevenness I'd done from pulling. After ruining my adorably cute blond bob, I realized that it was time to shave it off and start fresh.   I had planned on waiting until I got a wig to do it, but some loving encouragement from my amazing friends (plus the wine didn't hurt), and I just went ahead and shaved.   You. Guys. I have never felt so free, like I'm no longer chained down. The positive feedback from friends and family has been insanely overwhelming. I feel prettier than I thought I would, when I can't hide behind my hair, and random strangers on the street keep approaching me to tell me that few women could pull it off, but that I look great.   I'm really hoping this helps me learn to stop pulling, as physically I'm not really able to right now. I just wanted to share with this community because I know you guys know how hard the struggle is. The way my one friend put it -- I'm taking control back, and that's exactly what it feels like."

Trichsters,3crtqw,iwillfightyou,2,Fri Jul 10 06:55:50 2015 UTC,"Exact same thing happened to me. Suddenly the texture of both my beard and head hair changed and became very coarse and wiry, almost overnight. It started after a trial of androgel for low testosterone. I've read hormones can make your hair change but this really sucks. I'm no longer on the androgel and my hair feels dry and unhealthy. It seems the change is permanent and no amount of hair olive oil masks or supplements seem to help. Like you, the texture change is what got me pulling at age 34. Never even thought about it prior to that."

Trichsters,3crtqw,FuzzyBacon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:30 2015 UTC,"Are you using beard oil? If not, you should consider buying some and applying it every time you get out of the shower and maybe before bedtime as well (depends on how dry it feels). You should also be using conditioner once or twice a week and water washing it (don't use shampoo unless you get some specifically for beards, it's very different than head hair). Beard balm may help as well by helping hold the hairs in place and not get so wild. That makes it harder to isolate individual hairs to pull at.   That will help hair health a lot. It may or may not help with the pulling. It's a bit of a catch 22, but you'll see an improvement in health when you stop pulling, as well. Kinky and wirey hairs are pretty common in people with trichotillomania."

Try crafts, make jewellery, knitting, make headbans, macaronni boxes, whatever you want, something to keep your hands busy, and you can still do it while hanging out or watching tv. Get a new hobby, try going outside, meeting people, take a class, turn it into something productive! You can do it!"
Trichsters,3crhsn,ldrchubs,4,Fri Jul 10 09:11:27 2015 UTC,"Please don't smoke cigarettes. To say they're bad for your health is an understatement. They're also a stimulant which can increase your anxiety and make your urge to pull worse.  I do cross stitch and embroidery because it's a very focused activity that requires both hands. Cross stitch is really easy to pick up, and you can probay get all the supplies you need for less than the cost of a pack of cigarettes ;)"
Trichsters,3crhsn,turtree,3,Fri Jul 10 09:29:26 2015 UTC,"I don't have the same advice as most people, but I've found cigars to help tremendously. They're expensive, so a pipe (TOBACCO!! Don't do drugs) works just as well. You don't inhale, you don't get addicted (very easily) and it opens a world to collecting! It's a country mile better than cigarettes in my opinion, and it keeps your mind and hands busy. Plus it tastes and smells soooo good (unless you buy shitty cigars. Life's too short to smoke shitty cigars).  If this isn't up your alley, maybe try e-cigarettes? I suggest staying away from cowboy killers to be honest.  HOWEVER this is just trading vices for vices, y'know? What's helped me the most, honestly, is finding the roots of my anxiety--""I'm pulling, why am I pulling this time,"" I ask myself--and try to figure out if I'm anxious because of a test, because of work, because of friend/relationship problems. Whatever it is, I fix it. I'd apologize to my friends if that's what it is. I'd study my ass off if I'm anxious for a test. I'd say about half of the time, however, it's boredom. If I'm bored, I entertain myself. Sports, working out, reading (using both hands), driving, smoking a cigar. Rinse and repeat.

The trick for me is to never go against the grain when shaving.  And I stopped doing it every day.  Every 3 days works best for me.  Best advice I can give you is keep shaving so you have nothing to pick out.  And try doing it every few days.  If you don't do it often enough, your skin won't be used to it.  And if you do it too much, it won't give your skin time to recover.  Everyone is going to be different.  Scars will eventually go away if you are young enough.  I think you should just keep shaving to prevent more of it from happening.  Don't worry about it.  It's pretty easy to tell the difference between a scar and an STD.    Explain the scaring as a bad reaction to shaving. Reduce it by being consistant with shaving and finding the best habit to shave. Every other day?  Every 3 days?   I'm a guy btw.  I had issues with pubic hair when I was a teenager.  It stopped when I just shaved everything. I still have issues with my eyebrows and facial hair.  I dated someone for a year with massive scaring down there.  I think she said that when she was very young and started getting hair she freaked out and shaved the shit out of it completely wrong.  I mean there was massive, obvious scaring.  It did freak me out the first time I saw it.  But as a guy, guys stop noticing it very quickly.  I'm curious to see a picture of how bad you are talking about so I could compare to this person.  I'm willing to bet whatever scaring you have isn't that bad at all.  You're probably over thinking it.  I hope this advice helps."

Trichsters,3cn7m8,SurrealBird,2,Thu Jul 9 09:51:54 2015 UTC,"I've been with my boyfriend for over two years now, and I definitely worried about this at the start of our relationship (my pubic area was the main place I pulled). He did ask me about the bumps and scars once, a few months in, but I shrugged it off as razor burn and he never asked about it agin. I don't think it really freaked him out or anything, he was just curious! I finally told him about my trich maybe six months later, and he was completely understanding and supportive. I've mostly stopped pulling now and have grown out my pubic hair thanks to his help and vote of confidence, so in the end I'm happy I ended up being honest with him, though I do think it's something to save until you're more comfortable in your relationship. Saying it's razor burn isn't going to freak most guys out, and most probably wont even ask, so just be confident!"

You have no reason to be ashamed of yourself or to be afraid of ""scaring your partner away."" If your SO isn't supportive or gives you a hard time for your suffering, then is he worth it? You shouldn't let stigma creep into your relationship. Perhaps after telling him, you can show him some educational material? Trich is more common than you think. I would personally wait until you're comfortable enough around him and are sure you're serious about each other."

Vouching for this one here; I have a bad habit of pulling at my facial hair, and I like having a beard so I didn't want to just shave it off. I discovered beard balm recently and ever since I started using, my pulling has more-or-less stopped."
Trichsters,3cj0iz,Aldairion,2,Wed Jul 8 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"I know how you're feeling. One thing that I found helpful growing out my brows, is that when I found one that I wanted to pull I'd let myself get that one to ease the impulse. Then I'd go and draw on my brows in the shape I'd like them to be one day and allow myself to tweeze any brow hairs outside of that. Cold turkey didn't work for me, but that did.   You might want to head over to /r/makeupaddiction if you haven't already. They'll be able to help you with products and application to make your brows look more natural and be durable. What products are you currently using?"
Trichsters,3cj0iz,mouldypeaches,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:29:32 2015 UTC,I've been using an eyebrow pencil and a paint brush. I'm an artist so getting the shape right and a natural fade isn't too difficult for me.. But god damn I would love to figure out how to make them more permanent so I don't have to worry about them rubbing off.
Trichsters,3cj0iz,mouldypeaches,2,Wed Jul 8 16:05:24 2015 UTC,Anastasia Beverly Hills Dip Brow. If you're confident in your drawing abilities then this is the product for you. It's pricey but it lasts a really really long time and it does. not. budge. At all.
Trichsters,3cj0iz,jhartsfi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:38:25 2015 UTC,"This!! Anastasia dip brow has saved me from feeling so embarrassed in public!! And I'm not even that great at the lines just yet, but this stuff is amazing in every level!!"
Trichsters,3cj0iz,jjaebum,2,Thu Jul 9 05:03:41 2015 UTC,"This happened to me about a year ago, I used to have at least 1/4 to 1/2 of my eyebrows (the inner parts) but then after one night, I didn't even think I had done that much, they were just gone. Since then they haven't grown back at all, so there's just nothing there. I don't really have any advice for you... it sucks drawing them on every single day. And if you're anything like me, you can never quite make one look exactly like the other, and they tend to look different from day to day. I feel like people must notice this, but I've never had even a single person say anything about it. I dunno if that makes you feel better about it or not, it does for me sometimes. Just knowing that people are nice enough to not mention it or they just don't really care whether you have eyebrows or not because it's not like it really matters is a nice thought."
Trichsters,3cj0iz,jjaebum,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:08:34 2015 UTC,"There have been a few instances where I was in a rush and overdid my brows (I have dark features so I use a black brow pencil) and boy it must be noticeable. The only people who have the balls to tell me are my family, who will immediately call me out on it.  My boyfriend knows about the problem and oddly enough his (now passed) mother was a trich. He said she used to spend hours plucking every hair from her eyebrows and drawing them back in. It's comforting to know he doesn't care and still thinks I'm beautiful.. But at the same time I don't want this to continue well into my 30's, 40's, 50's, etc.."
Trichsters,3ccn6z,Boo_X,3,Mon Jul 6 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"I have just gotten mine back out to what thickness I want them!  It's taken me a long time.  I had to put away the 10x magnifying mirror and tweezers except for once a week.  I then drew with white eyeliner pencil where I want my brows to be and ONLY plucked outside the lines.  I constantly was trying to ""make them even"" and eventually overplucking to the point where they were almost gone!  They're still thinner by normal standards, but look great compared to what they used to be.    If you're a makeup user, use eyeliner pencil the same color as your brows and draw a section on your hand.  Take an angled brush and pick up the color from your hand and fill in the area with small strokes mimicing the natural hair growth patterns.  *edit: before and after photos"

Trichsters,3ccn6z,ANerdAward,2,Wed Jul 8 13:20:00 2015 UTC,You need to start with small goals.  Build up to a full bush of brows.  You can do it.
Trichsters,3ccn6z,th3whom,5,Mon Jul 6 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"Can't relate exactly but I can somewhat. Last time I managed to keep my hands off my eyebrows for a little while, the regrowth was not encouraging at all. The eyebrow hairs were basically growing above and below where the eyebrow should be, and not at all where they should. I felt like there wasn't even a point to trying to let them grow back since they only looked worse and I still had to draw them on with makeup just like I normally have to. So I gave up and started pulling again (not that I gave up simply because of the way they were growing back. I mostly gave up because I was simply too tempted to pull)"
Trichsters,3ccn6z,jjaebum,3,Mon Jul 6 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"I over-plucked a long time ago. It's really as simple (and difficult) as being patient and giving them time to grow.  During this time, you could practice filling them in. There are hundreds of tutorials available, given the huge eyebrow trend. (/r/makeupaddiction, for example). You could also dye them the same shade.  What you shouldn't do is beat yourself up. It's just as important to be kind to yourself as it is to be kind to others. Imagine treating someone else the way you treat yourself. You don't deserve that. :)"
Trichsters,3ccn6z,DumpyDoo,2,Mon Jul 6 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"If you're struggling, perhaps you could look into less natural alternatives? You could learn to fill them in with makeup, or you can get eyebrows tattooed on fairly realistically. I'm pretty sure you can also buy false eyebrows (like false eyelashes) that could be an option if you're struggling :)"

Trichophagia is something that can't really be understood unless you're a ""trichophagist"" (let's totally make it a word). I've told some people about the reality of my trichophagia, though.  Like, although my boyfriend (and any others I have told) doesn't usually notice it, when he does, he'll tap my hand. I feel incredibly guilty and angry that I can't finish chewing on the piece, but in the end I know it's the best. It's some refreshing hard love.

Trichsters,3c9eqc,RedDwarfian,2,Mon Jul 6 05:11:06 2015 UTC,"The best recourse is to try not to feel guilty.  It sounds like you're appreciative that he's helping you out, and that's good.  Don't beat yourself up over lapses.  Refocus it as ""It's fine, I'll pull less [insert future timeframe here].""  My boss just throws a pack of gum in my general direction when he notices me doing it.

However, opening up and saying you have it too is really brave of you, and something I appreciate.  I've told some people I'm close to about my trichophagia. This is mainly because I want them to stop me if they notice I'm pulling. I might mention I pull my hair to other friends, but not that I eat it. I don't think they understand the extent and do the whole, ""Oh, I do that sometimes too!""  I've seen one therapist before (God, was he the worst), and when I mentioned it, he didn't really know anything about it. And I don't think he would've ever put the effort into looking it up in order to help. I pulled my hair in front of him and he never even thought anything of it."
Trichsters,3c9eqc,Cruxie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:54:48 2015 UTC,"The unfortunate thing about the first therapist I saw is that she is actually the one who planted the notion of eating the hair. During one of our sessions she asked if I ate the hair to get a better diagnosis and until that point, I hadn't. After that, I started rubbing the follicle on my lips (like another commenter mentioned) and then the eating.  I'm not glad others have trichophagia, but I am glad I was able to get that off my chest after all these years. Best of luck."

I don't know you but for me I spent so many years hiding my pulling that when I finally decided to be open about it I just lumped in the eating it part.

You can put it on eyebrows just like you do with lashes and it has seriously helped me grow mine back in pretty quickly when I have a bad pulling spell. You can also add some vitamins to your regime (of you're not taking them already). Omega 3, B Vitamins and NAC of course!  Also, I've noticed that if I stave off plucking altogether, like, no shaping or tweezing strays, I have a better chance of pulling less. And then I can reshape them for a better frame when they are grown out completely! Good luck!!"

Trichsters,3c2dff,8serene8,5,Sat Jul 4 03:02:13 2015 UTC,"I have no idea where it came from but I imagine it started with my high anxiety that began around Sophomore year of highschool. I've realized that anxiety and being extremely anxious sitting in one spot makes me pull. For example: 2hr classes are my hell. I'm stuck in a room for 2hrs. I've never had a teacher who wouldnt let me get up and go to the hall or bathroom when I needed to escape though.  Studying is bad too. Unless it's something extremely interesting or intensive, I get nervous and anxious and pick.  I've started to find cures and ways to curb it for me, but I've a long way to go."

I don't pull my eyebrows (that shit hurts) but I pull my beard. A lot. Which, if I keep up with my shaving, can be slightly prevented for a couple hours.

Trichsters,3c2dff,lurrz,4,Sun Jul 5 00:05:33 2015 UTC,"I just remember sitting on the couch when I was probably around 11 years old, pulling my hair out mindlessly while watching tv, and then being like ""...I have no idea why I'm doing this..."" I recognized I'd been doing it off and on for a while (I've no idea how long. Maybe even my whole life?) but that I'd never really realized I was doing it.   I remember my mom telling me that she used to pluck the very front of her hairline to get rid of her ""widow's peak"". But I'm fairly sure that she told me that after I'd started pulling. I also know my aunt had trich to the point where she now has a permanent mostly-bald spot covering a large portion of her head. So I think for me it may be a ""runs in the family"" kind of thing.  I've never been big on pulling hair that's not on my scalp, but I know I've also always mindlessly gently ""pull"" my eyebrows by gently pinching a portion between my fingers and pulling just hard enough to clear out any hairs that come out easily (like hairs that are about to shed so are already loose). I also recall taking tweezers to my legs to pull all the ingrowns I'd get and then just randomly plucking leg hairs out."

Trichsters,3c2dff,orcawhales_and_owls,5,Sat Jul 4 13:28:42 2015 UTC,"I don't really remember the order but I do remember these as major events?  One of them was because of a combination of a super dry scalp and lice - my head was super super itchy, and I scratched a spot on my scalp till it bled. Then I worked out I could get extreme relief by pulling the hair on top of that spot and so I did, and then I pulled a few out. Then I noticed the little follicle bulb thingy on the end? The ones from directly on that spot were red, and the others weren't,and I was curious about the red ones. So I kept pulling, hoping for more red ones.   Another memory is because my friend used to inspect her hair for split ends and cut them off if she'd find any, and I was like huh, I have split ends, I should do that. Except I didn't have scissors most of the time, so I'd just bite the end off. Then I think I started pulling out the bits with split ends because why not just get rid of them?   Around that time, I had a very stressful event at school. I was working with a group who weren't...great at group work, and then on the last day I was like ""yo has anybody planned anything for our major presentation?"" And they were like ""you can do it"", so I spent a hour sitting in a school hall stressed over this, pulling out hair after hair because of the ""split ends"". It was enough that my mum even noticed /:  And I started eating it because I pulled out so much that there was always hair on the ground, and mum would see it and criticise me for it, not understanding.

Trichsters,3c2dff,jjaebum,3,Sat Jul 4 13:26:29 2015 UTC,Mine isn't from my scalp so it's not so bad but I started when I noticed darker random hairs on my face. There would be a stray black one and I would pull it out and it was actually really long which was cool. So I'd go for them every so often until I noticed there was slightly darker white ones if I looked close. Then I started noticing the long white ones. So now I have tweezers pretty much every night absent mindedly pulling all those white hairs like peach fuzz off of my face. It's therapeutic for me and if I don't do it for a few days I have an urge to do it.
Trichsters,3c2dff,ThePancakey,2,Sat Jul 4 08:28:55 2015 UTC,"I would do the same, hairs that do not belong on the face must go. I have one that appears under my chin...it comes out of nowhere I swear."
Trichsters,3c2dff,vickevlar,3,Sat Jul 4 12:19:48 2015 UTC,"So interesting how most everyone's story seems to have a catalyst - some kind of physical or mental trauma that set off the disorder. In my case, I developed a fixation over the hairs on my cheeks and jawline after a couple of bad staph infections four years ago. I had really dry, flaky skin that was super sensitive to breakouts. It was especially bad that winter for whatever reason, and I guess excessive touching (not picking or pulling anything at the time) led to a gnarly infection. It was embarrassing and gross, but a round of antibiotics knocked it out. I was super paranoid and hyper-vigilant about it happening again and noticed some minor inflammation on my cheeks one night. I picked up the tweezers and plucked out every last hair, thinking there was some kind of connection. No idea why. It was of no benefit physically, but I felt a little relief from the anxiety I was experiencing in that moment. From then on, it's just been out of control. The hair doesn't grow as it should anymore, resulting in a lot of in-growns, which makes the impulse so much worse.  I'm 31 now, so this started in my late 20s. I know it's an anxiety thing. For as long as I can remember, I have lived with severe, often crippling anxiety. Literally nothing helps with that, long-term.  As for how bad it is now? Well, worst it's ever been and somehow getting worse. So I'd say pretty bad. I haven't gone a day without picking/pulling at least once for an hour or longer in... I don't even know how long it's been. I can't leave the house without my face coated in Neosporin, which looks awfully bizarre, but less alarming than the alternative. There are times (like right now) when I really, really think I should be institutionalized because I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind. Buuuuuut, I start with a new therapist on Tuesday, so I'll try to settle for that!"
Trichsters,3c06in,8serene8,3,Fri Jul 3 16:01:16 2015 UTC,Great start so far! I've been 32 days pull free but whenever I get married I'd hope I'd also be in a period of not-pulling. It's so hard but stick with it!
Trichsters,3c06in,KittenImmaculate,5,Fri Jul 3 19:09:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's weird, I have periods where I don't pull and I can stop myself but the. All of a sudden, bam! Sometimes it's stress induced but other times there is no reason. Drives me nuts. And you know it wouldn't be such a pain if the hair didn't come out so easily =\ Thanks I am trying!"
Trichsters,3c06in,KittenImmaculate,3,Fri Jul 3 20:49:23 2015 UTC,"What happens to me is if I pull or rub one day... And then the follicles are irritated which makes me want to touch them more. If I leave them alone for even a day, I'm less likely to touch them because they aren't irritated. But now that mine are mostly all back I get to actually groom them and pluck/cut appropriately and shape them."
Trichsters,3c06in,jjaebum,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am hoping that mine grow in decently. I have seen horror stories of not all the hair growing back leaving bald spots from pulling so many years. I have even found a solid white hair on my head at age 27 and I am positive its from pulling. I have white eyelashes too.   Also, yes same here when the follicles get irritated I have to pull for it to stop."
Trichsters,3c06in,KittenImmaculate,2,Fri Jul 3 23:32:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah the last time I went a week without messing with my eyebrows, they just didn't grow back right at all. The hair seemed to grow in the wrong places. Like, it grew just above and below the eyebrow line but not at all where the eyebrows are supposed to be. ugh, so frustrating. Yours seem to be growing back really nicely though"
Trichsters,3c06in,KittenImmaculate,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:12:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I am hoping they grow out more. I am just worried about the growing out phase. I have not been able to let them fully grow out in a very long time. I was able to successfully stop touching my eyelashes and eyebrows for about 2 months when eyelashes started falling into my eyes again (I had this issue way back before I started pulling) and so it began -.- Two months in they weren't fuller as in growing past where I have been keeping them shape wise, but the middles where I have been pulling the most filled in. It was a step, now I need to try again and hope to keep it going. I want to be able to see my eyebrows in my wedding pictures lol."
Trichsters,3c06in,KittenImmaculate,2,Sat Jul 4 13:38:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I have a small inner patch on my right brow that I think I killed the follicles. 😕 that's what makeup is for

Trichsters,3bdkwb,ginopono,2,Sun Jun 28 05:19:13 2015 UTC,"It's strange how these things get started, isn't it? You mention having an injury; in my case, I had legitimate (minor) dermatological issues about four years ago - dry skin leading to these little sores, leading to entirely too much scrutiny, leading to a full-blown staph infection on my right cheek. Took care of that, but somehow developed a fixation on hair growth. I came to haaaaaate the whiskers on my cheeks and jawline. Would go after an occasional ingrown at first, but now every stray whisker sets me off. Seeing and feeling hair in these (arbitrarily assigned) ""zones"" drives me bonkers. It's to the point that I'm extracting them as if they were splinters - like they aren't supposed to be part of my body. That, naturally, leads to even MORE ingrowns, aggressive tweezing, rinse, repeat. I rationally know how damaging and exacerbating the behavior is - and visibly wear the signs all over my face. Makes no difference.  Like you, I have areas that are basically bald, but that's inconsequential in comparison to the resulting skin damage. I don't care at this point whether the hair grows back or not - I just want out of the cycle. If there's healthy regrowth and I can live with it, great. If it's gone forever, fine. The pulling was symmetrical enough (unintentionally - go figure) that it wouldn't look too unusual if nothing grew there ever again.  I'll echo the sentiment that it isn't your fault you can't stop. It's like trying to resist scratching an itch that never goes away, y'know? The worst of it for me is the feeling that there's no end in sight. Looking ahead to the future and thinking not necessarily that I'll be managing better or worse than I am today, but that it's still there. That it will ALWAYS be hanging over me, no matter what else is going on life-wise. A conventional illness, a broken bone, those you can endure by telling yourself, ""Well this really sucks right now, but in three months I'll be all healed up and will never have to think about it again."" Not so with this. Recovery feels so out of reach and is a constant battle for those who get there. It's such an exhausting fucking drag on your system."

Trichsters,3b0j6r,-Indigo-,8,Thu Jun 25 00:09:01 2015 UTC,"I only started going to a hairdresser recently (cut my own hair for years, which was a bad idea), and the way I handled it was to very briefly explain trich to the stylist. She was pretty cool about it, and now she knows, so I'm about to make another appointment with the same person. I figured it was better to be honest about it, and that if I could find someone I liked and could be a repeat customer, I'd only really have to explain it once. And when she asked what kind of style I wanted, I told her she had free reign as long as she could do something that would hide the spots I'd pulled but not make me look like Miley Cyrus. Best haircut I've had in my life, hands down."
Trichsters,3b0j6r,bookwithoutpics,5,Thu Jun 25 00:31:40 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel :( I usually briefly explain it like it's no big deal with limited info. Something like- "" I have this thing where I loose parts of my hair. You may notice some unevenness"". I usually add that's it's kind of embarrassing so I usually don't like to talk about it. The last part usually clues the person in that I don't want to continue to make small talk about it. I use to be a cosmetologist and honestly I know that the hair dressers really don't give a shit about trich- by this I mean, they aren't judging you. Remember they are professionals and part of their training includes how to make a client feel comfortable.  With that being said I can totally relate how you feel. I've only dared to go to a handful of hairdressers in my life time who I've carefully selected with assurances we don't have any acquaintances in common. I really don't  like my current hairdresser but I don't  want to  face this whole conversation all over again.  On a positive note. Literally every hairdresser I have been to shares a personal experience of someone they know with trich. That usually puts me at ease."
Trichsters,3b0j6r,Brainkissed,3,Thu Jun 25 01:43:46 2015 UTC,"I don't say anything.  After 5 years I became close to my stylist and told her I had TTM.  She said she knew and could t tell and she had other clients with the same issues, so she did the best with what she had to work with and never made it awkward or asked questions!"
Trichsters,3b0j6r,ANerdAward,3,Thu Jun 25 01:45:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you all! It really helped me. :) I don't know if I'll come outright and say it, but I'll probably say something like, ""I'm losing my hair, and I really want to get something that will hide it."""
Trichsters,3b0j6r,notasuit,2,Thu Jun 25 04:24:43 2015 UTC,I try to be very matter of fact when I share it with people. I find that my approach to it impacts their reaction. Good luck!
Trichsters,3b0j6r,SurrealBird,2,Thu Jun 25 04:29:55 2015 UTC,"After a few bad experiences at the hairdresser's, I learned to always call beforehand and explain that I have a hair loss condition. You can say that you feel self-conscious and would like to see a hairstylist that's understanding and knows how to deal with similar customers. It might be worth it asking if they have a private room for you where you can’t be seen by other people. Many hair salons will have those rooms for brides."
Trichsters,3az30i,Half-Invented,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"That does sound more like trich to me, as someone with ongoing fairly severe trich who's also had some skin-picking issues in the past (and still with my acne, but not so much other than that). I feel the same way about my pubic hair (sorry, TMI?) with regards to needing to dig for the barely-visible hairs under the skin (and the resulting sores and scabs from attacking them with tweezers). Your appearance afterwards may be similar to CSP, but if the urge is motivated by removing hair, I'd definitely classify it as trich. And the need to fix ""imperfections"" can definitely be associated with trich as well, which is part of why so many of us go after thicker or darker hairs that stand out as imperfect to us.  That being said, I think CSP and trich are similar enough in nature that it really doesn't matter which it is. And of course, I'm not a doctor, I have no experience with this other than my personal struggle with it and the reading I've done about it, so don't take this as some sort of diagnosis of trich or anything."
Trichsters,3az30i,Soramke,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:34:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the perspective. Very CSP-ish in presentation, but internally my fixation is ENTIRELY on the hairs/whiskers. To be honest, nothing would make me happier right now than if all the hair on my face just stopped growing altogether. (Even the bits I don't pull. Screw it.) Would I make up for it by finding other ""imperfections"" to single out? Who knows. I just don't feel I'll ever be free of this so long as the opportunity/temptation is still there.  This is something I've never really considered before, but I guess it's another reason why I haven't been able to exclusively identify with classic trich. For most pullers, the pronounced baldness certainly isn't the goal in and of itself -- and indeed, is considered undesirable -- it's a byproduct of the compulsion. I'm way OK with the hairs in question NEVER growing back. (But they always do.) I suppose in that respect, I'm ""lucky.""   No such thing as TMI as far as I'm concerned. That (long!) thread about pubic-area plucking, leading to rashes, blemishes, and ingrown hairs sorta prompted me to reassess, as I am wont to do. It's pretty much the same, just directed at my face. As if, y'know, regular living didn't have enough moments of invalidation and social stigmatization on its own, we have these lovely disorders."
Trichsters,3az30i,Soramke,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about my pubic hair, in that I'd be perfectly okay with it never growing back. It's just too much trouble. I definitely don't feel that way about my scalp, though, which I've pulled from far more extensively in the past year or so. The nature of the pulling is exactly the same; it's just that I wouldn't mind sacrificing my pubic hair to be free of pulling, whereas my head hair is far more important to me and my goal is to grow it back, not be rid of it entirely.   I think your desire to have the hairs never grow back is more a byproduct of the location of pulling. It's socially acceptable to not have facial hair, and if pulling your hair is such a pain, of course that would be preferable. Same goes for pubic hair for me -- it's acceptable (or even encouraged) for girls to remove their pubic hair, so I wouldn't mind at all if it never grew back, and then I'd have no urge to pull it. But I don't want to be bald, no matter how many hours of pulling it would save me from. I've shaved my head a few times, pretty much as short as it can go, but the goal is always to grow it back out.  So again, I think that wishing your hair would go away entirely isn't really a deviation from ""classic trich,"" it's just a response to your particular situation."
Trichsters,3axk8a,DoDaDaTheIdiot,3,Wed Jun 24 08:34:40 2015 UTC,"You're realizing that this is normal behavior. That's step one, so congrats!  This is not undefeatable. Think about what triggers you to do this, whether you pick under immediate stress or whether it's an underlying pursuit for perfection or whether you have compulsions or one of a myriad of other facts. Then, go to a therapist.   I'm serious. I know you didn't want to hear that. I know you don't want to pay or don't want to tell your parents if you're living at home. But a therapist can help you deal with the underlying issue that is prompting you to pick, and you will have a heck of a time winning this without one.  There are affordable therapists through universities, if you're in college. You can check your insurance for coverage, if you're younger/older than college age. There are even support groups, which will let you meet others struggling with this and keep costs down."
Trichsters,3axk8a,meggawat,3,Wed Jun 24 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"Well, when I'm not pulling, I'm doing other things.  For example, I have some very similar habits to pulling.  If I can't pull, I'll bite the inside of my mouth skin.   If I can't pull, I'll play with my ears and fold them over and around and just generally mess with them.  If I can't pull, I'll scrape the undersides of my fingernails with my other fingernails.  If I can't pull, I'll use my school ID card to scrape oil off my face and see how much I can get.  If I can't pull, I'll use my fingernails to scrape alongside my hairline to see how much buildup I can get under my fingernails."
Trichsters,3axk8a,Party_Pantalones,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to read this for me. I have had trich since I was super young to the point where I used to be almost completely bald. It was really bad until high-school. I was in (still am) in therapy as long as I can remember. I don't pull out my head hair almost at all anymore but I'm still obsessed with body hair. What you said about finger hair is exactly the same situation for me. Dark hairs on a light background and light hairs on a dark background. I own more pairs of tweezers than I do t shirts probably. What is most interesting is everything else you do I also do. I bite/pick at my inner lips and tongue until I bleed and also have a thing with face oil. I never once thought or was told that these symptoms were related to my trichotilomania but your comment makes me feel a bit more normal about it. What I've noticed is my symptoms get worse with caffeine and stress. If I drink coffee or energy drinks almost immediately I am picking at my face or body. If I am stressed or anxious I start biting my lips and tongue to the point where I don't even want to kiss my girlfriend because I'm scared she'll feel my bumpy, scabby tongue with hers. Therapy helps but stress relief works better. When I go to the gym I don't pull/pick/bite/pluck all day almost. I also try to avoid caffeine whenever possible (it's hard because I work 24 hour shifts) so I don't agitate whatever causes me to fuck with my skin or hair. The one thing that never goes away for me is constantly feeling my upper lip for stray hairs. It's become involuntary almost. To make a short story long, try an excersise program or join a gym and do lots of strength training. Something that requires some serious exertion of energy. And try to cut caffeine completely from your diet. You will never be ""cured"", but people are very understanding. Every girlfriend I've had has let me pull out their finger and toe hair lol. Anyways, hope this helps."
Trichsters,3aux2q,noworryhatebombstill,3,Tue Jun 23 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Since no one else has commented, I thought I should say thanks for your post. I've been taking Vitamin D3 supplements for the past two months and I've stopped pulling completely. If I stop taking for a couple days my eyebrows feel twitchy and I have to rub them again. My parents are always asking me why I keep popping pills haha. I take 5 1000IU daily after experimenting with different doses."
Trichsters,3aux2q,retrojungle,2,Tue Jun 23 22:42:54 2015 UTC,I hope someone does a real study about this! It's great to hear that it's helping you too. :)
Trichsters,3aux2q,Half-Invented,3,Wed Jun 24 16:58:12 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, you may be on to something here. I've had extensive blood work annually through my employer for the past five years. The lab results have ALWAYS come back with vitamin D in the red zone (I just looked through each of them). Been pulling/picking since 2012.  And wow, I feel you on the SSRI shit show. I've taken quite a number over the years to help manage my depression but all they've ever done is help me become fat, stupid, and suicidal (or see http://www.reddit.com/r/CompulsiveSkinPicking/comments/3a1tlr/not_ok/cs9vp2w). In other words, depressed.  Buproprion/Wellbutrin caused some, ah, rage issues, but I honestly feel like I could live with - or take measures to mitigate it - at this point. If it's part of the package that gets results, that's still preferable to living like this (as trading one problem for another goes).  I notice that NAC is not listed as part of your regimen, but you've had experience with it? I started on 1200 mg about three weeks ago and so far it's doing fuuuuuuuuck all. Working my way up to 2400. I know from the ONE clinical study done on the efficacy of NAC on impulse control disorders that participants reported positive results at about the nine-week mark. So, sticking with it, but I'm super skeptical. (Reverse placebo effect at work?) I dunno, it just seems like snake oil.  My experience with Xanax is identical to yours. I use it as needed, and it certainly gets the job done, but pay for it the next day in the form of feeling like I was run over by a truck. Never taken Clonazepam. What you describe is the effect that Valium/Diazepam has on me. Same rapid relief as Xanax, except I come right out of it w/ no fatigue or mental haze. But Xanax has unfortunately been the go-to for every provider I've ever seen...  Anecdotal or not, it's worth a shot. Given the appalling dearth of research, qualifications, and proven, effective treatments for this disorder within the medical community, you kinda have no choice but to go the trial-and-error route. (Which largely describes my experience/frustrations seeking treatment, in a nutshell.)  Vitamin D deficiency isn't all that uncommon, but maybe in concert with depression (check), severe anxiety (check), and other markers of a brain chemistry out of whack, makes for an especially poisonous combination in certain segments of the population. Gonna start pounding the vitamin D, and we'll see what happens. At worst, I'll be out a few bucks.  At what point did you start noticing a difference? Was it a gradual reduction over the entire six months, or like hitting a more dramatic milestone? In any event, THANKS for offering another avenue to explore!"
Trichsters,3aux2q,Half-Invented,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:23:23 2015 UTC,"I hear ya on everything you're saying.  NAC doesn't seem worth it for me, at least not on its own. I've tried it 3 or 4 times in like 3 month stretches, usually at 2400mg/day. Sometimes I went up to 3600mg/day. It maybe helped a bit with the urges? Hard to tell. But it certainly didn't get me anywhere near pull-free. The amount that is thought to make a difference makes the regimen pretty expensive, and while this may be a bit stupid, I found it exhausting to be swallowing so many of those massive horse capsules every day.   I do think your point that Vitamin D deficiency is very, very common is one that needs to be amplified. Most people in industrialized countries are Vitamin D deficient, but most people in these places don't have trich. Vitamin D deficiency is not THE cause of trich. But I think it has something to do with it, somehow-- my layperson's hunch is it interacts with trichotillomania through its role in glutathione levels. The only pulling episodes I've had since starting this routine have been minor ones when I'm really hungover. After drinking too much the body directs all available glutathione to help the liver in sopping up the harmful byproducts of alcohol.  Hmmmmm....  The difference was pretty sudden. I noticed less pulling within a week, which is before the buproprion reaches effective levels in the body. By a month in, it was starkly obvious that this was working.   As a funny aside, it has other benefits-- one morning about a month after starting this routine, my partner and I were laying in bed as we were waking up and he asked me if I'd forgotten to take my makeup off the night before. I was like, ""No, why?"" And he was like, ""Because you have no dark circles at all."" I got up and looked in the mirror and it was true. All my adult life I've had these big blue-purple bruise-ish circles under my eyes, and now it's just normal skin. It's pretty crazy.     Good luck! Just remember that the max recommended daily dose of Vitamin D is 4000IU. :)"
Trichsters,3aux2q,bookwithoutpics,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:45:16 2015 UTC,"Cool. You're not kidding, the quantity of NAC you're supposed to take in order to see any sort of therapeutic benefit is rather prohibitive. Not just in terms of cost; I keep thinking one of those giant-ass pills is gonna slide down my windpipe. Two are bad enough, but swallowing four (or more) is getting absurd.  On the Vitamin D, I have no way of knowing, but I've probably always been deficient (as there's no reason why this would have radically changed). But, I certainly haven't always had trich. That only got started a few years ago. While not a cause, maybe it's a factor that majorly doesn't do us any favors once the wheels are in motion. And once corrected, will help push the reset button and/or make resistance much easier.  And wow, I'm surprised how rapidly it kicked in for you. I don't want to make too much of your singular experience, but I'm very curious and will be picking up a bottle this evening. I'm cautious about taking too much (in light of that study about the risks of excess Vitamin D... right on the heels of everyone hearing about how deficient they were, leading to the general sentiment of ""well fuck this"" that inevitably follows any seemingly contradictory medical advice. But I digress.) I used to take a multivitamin, but I believe it was limited to 1000IU of D3. Gonna go straight to the source now, so 2000IU it is.  As for alcohol: not that it's out of control, but I keep finding new reasons and reminders why it would really be for the best to reduce my intake. One thing at a time though...  I've never in my adult life not had dark circles under my eyes. It doesn't bother me, but I wonder if I'd recognize myself without them. Ha."
Trichsters,3aux2q,notasuit,2,Thu Jun 25 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting! Last time my doctor did a full physical she noticed that I was pretty vitamin D deficient as well. This is something I'll have to look into!  Also, while we're on the subject, what's been your experience talking with doctors about trich? I haven't yet, mostly because I have a busy schedule as it is and throwing extra appointments into the mix feels like it would stress me out enough to outweigh the benefits..."
Trichsters,3aux2q,Littlecat22,3,Wed Jun 24 13:05:45 2015 UTC,"I really do wonder if there's a connection between trich and Vitamin D deficiency. I was poking about on Google Scholar and I can't find any studies looking into it. If I understand it correctly (and I may not-- this is coming from a history major, haha), low levels of an antioxidant called glutathione are associated with a whole host of psychiatric issues, trich among them. Boosting levels of glutathione seems to help reduce trich symptoms-- that's one of the ways that researchers think that NAC helps with trich. What I find interesting is that one of the chief effects of Vitamin D is the exact same thing. It increases glutathione in the blood and brain! But again, I lack the expertise to judge how significant this is.   My experience talking with doctors about trichotillomania has been largely bad. I don't need to be treated with kid gloves since I've been dealing with this shit for so long, but they were totally unsympathetic and treated me like a freak show. Most were not familiar with current research on the disorder. They hadn't heard of the NAC trials, for instance. They defaulted to pushing SSRIs very aggressively even though those are no longer recommended for treatment of trich. I also got a whiff of condescension from them when I indicated that my experiences with SSRIs have been so terrible (terrifying brain zaps, dyskinesia, and intense suicidal urges) that I am not willing to experiment with them any more.   However, my new psychiatrist is amazing! First off, he's... uh, shall we say, on the spectrum? He's such a wonk about pharmacology and the brain that his response was something like ""Fascinating! I wonder how that works!"" I actually found this super comforting because it made it seem like we were exploring this weird phenomenon of trichotillomania together instead of like I was weird. He didn't have much offhand knowledge, but he read up on it in between my appointments. It was his opinion (and it has been my intuition for a long time) that all of my disorders and symptoms share a root cause or causes. He's holistic in a rigorously scientific way, which I appreciate. And he also quickly realized that research on trich is relatively sparse and that we might need to experiment and think outside of the box to treat it.   So I don't know what to recommend. My doctor now is so amazing that it makes up for all the shit I've gotten from my previous ones.   I hope that helps! :3 You should try the Vitamin D if you've already confirmed that you have a deficiency. It's pretty much as low-risk, low-side effect as you can get."
Trichsters,3aux2q,_voodoo_child,2,Wed Jun 24 16:55:46 2015 UTC,This is interesting because I ran out of Vitamin D about a month ago and I kept forgetting to buy more. During the time I didn't have any I had way more urges to pull. I finally got some a little over a week ago and my urges have gone way down. Interesting.
Trichsters,3aux2q,icekittensurprise,2,Wed Jun 24 18:37:22 2015 UTC,Thank you!!!! I've also had bad luck with ssris. Definitely going to keep up with vitamins and keep the med in mind for the future if anxiety or pulling gets out of control. Do you think doctors would let someone recommend themselves a medicine because of this?

Trichsters,3agfln,shinymetalass,10,Fri Jun 19 23:06:05 2015 UTC,The one thing that made me stop was permanent neck damage from the strain of looking down at my pubic region to pull. I wish I had stopped sooner when the strain was taking its toll but I didn't. It really didn't show up until I was almost 30. Maybe thinking about the potential for chronic neck problems could deter you. I know it's hard because the follicles are the most interesting but it will real havoc on your neck.
Trichsters,3agfln,RadioIsMyFriend,2,Sat Jun 20 03:05:00 2015 UTC,"Holy crap. I'm so sorry. What exactly happened to your neck? Muscles, tendons?"

Trichsters,3agfln,RadioIsMyFriend,2,Sat Jun 20 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"I know it's hard to quit. Sorry you are saddled with Fibromyalgia. If it helps, things are always more connected than they seem. No disorder ever stands alone so to speak. Fibromyalgia, restless leg, fibroids. It all runs in my family too as does OCD, ADD, anxiety and depression. Your pulling is most likely connected to your nerve disorders. I say most likely because nothing is official yet. Just food for thought so maybe you see what you have in a different light. It can help sometimes to see the bigger picture. :) I've been reading up on gAMP/cAMP ratios and how it impacts our lives. Tryptophan has been a major help for me. I'm not a weirdo I swear, Lol.

I will be more careful in the future thanks to it.  Btw, have you tried acupuncture, OMM, or trigger point injections? Those things have worked pretty well for me in the past for muscle/nerve problems."

And nobody ever understands how we could pull out our own hair. it makes you feel lonely and gross.  It seems like you're going through so much, and you don't have the support from your family. Do you see a counselor or anything? It might help to have someone to talk to consistently. Best of luck to you, remember that you are beautiful despite the trich, and also you're worth helping."
Trichsters,3agfln,ANerdAward,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I have a psychologist. I talked to another this week because I thought mine wasn't helping anymore and she said it's just so many life issues I'm dealing with. She said it would make anyone depressed. My psychologist told me I'm overwhelmed and my usual coping strategies aren't working. That must be why I've upped the pulling ante.   When I pick, but especially when I pull my pubic hair, it feels so good and releases the stress. I remember once living at home, I got into an argument with my father. Afterwards, I went for my tweezer and locked myself in my room to pull. I purposely went for it because I knew it would help me. :("
Trichsters,3agfln,orcawhales_and_owls,4,Sat Jun 20 01:01:38 2015 UTC,"i know exactly what you mean. i could sit in front of my mirror with tweezers for forever. to the point where my neck hurts from angling my head so many weird ways.  i know this is something that i am not supposed to suggest, because its so controversial. but one thing that ACTUALLY helped me, like as much as pulling, was smoking weed. I dunno what your thoughts are on it or if you smoke or not, but it's there."

I smoke on occasion but not recently because my depression got worse and if I'm in a poor mood already, it seems to amplify whatever mood I'm in.   I could try when I'm feeling neutral or numb, or maybe once I get the urge to pull, go for a spliff instead."
Trichsters,3agfln,Soramke,6,Sat Jun 20 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"Ugh I would lock myself in the bathroom for hours tweezing my pubic hair stubble!  Then I would be left with red, inflamed skin.  I would grab a piece of toilet paper and pluck them out in sections and place the plucked hairs on the toilet paper. That way I could flush it all away.  I got laser hair removal/reduction which helps because it targets the darker, thicker hairs.  Thankfully with medication my urge to pull my pubic hair is lower.  I still pull my scalp though."
Trichsters,3agfln,Soramke,2,Sat Jun 20 02:40:24 2015 UTC,Glad that the medication and hair removal helps you. I do stubble too. I fought the urge to go for the tweezer last night. I only scratched at the ingrown hairs there.

Trichsters,3a2nq3,Beingmyself247,5,Tue Jun 16 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"Just to weigh in here, while I'm very open about my trich and other afflictions, I probably would not open communication with a new roommate by drawing attention to my trich (as /u/KittenImmaculate suggested). I would wait to meet the person.  Like another commenter said, some people just shave their eyebrows off to fit an aesthetic -- OP, I doubt that when people see you, their first thoughts are going to be negative.   I know that communal bathrooms seem scary, but if it is any relief, not everyone is going to be in the bathroom at the same time, people are usually focused on their own thing, and because they are communal... people usually just do what they have to do and leave.   Also thought it was worth mentioning that I met a trichster in real life recently who pulls her eyebrows and eyelashes. She has neither, but uses makeup to fix that. I spent half a day with this person and at the end of the night, she asked ME if I was a trichster (verbatim!) because she noticed the specific way I had been playing with my hair all day. And then she came up very close and showed me her eyebrows. I was shocked at meeting someone with the illness and impressed at how it went right under my nose, but then I realized -- no one, usually, is looking for these things, and trich is apparently more common than is believed.   I'm sorry if this turned into a rambling mess. I used to be so scared of my trich, and people finding out about it, and after a while of dealing with it, it just stopped becoming such a private issue because it's exhausting to worry about. And to be frank, people don't care! They have their own issues and insecurities too. If you do get looks or questions, try to embrace them bravely. People get curious about things they don't understand. I've been asked about bald spots in the past, and it's personally easier to be open and honest about my condition than to make up excuses. (One more thing I remembered: about half the time I've been found out by someone and explained trich, they'll bring up someone else they know who has a skin picking problem, and then I tell them about dermatillomania. Interesting!)  Best of luck. You will be okay. Let us know how the supplements work out!"
Trichsters,3a2nq3,terrevasts,5,Tue Jun 16 20:46:51 2015 UTC,"That's a good point - people aren't usually looking for things as much as one of us is. I've definitely noticed friends of mine with missing eyebrow or beard patches and I'm super curious, but don't want to ask and make them uncomfortable. And again, it's up to OP to decide if she wants to let it kind of go under the radar or broach it with the new roomies. I'm sure I would've been singing a different tune back when I was 18 (30 now)."
Trichsters,3a2nq3,KittenImmaculate,2,Tue Jun 16 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"Age plays a role for me too! Trich became obvious and problematic for me right before I started high school, and it was my best kept secret -- once I hit university, I was kind of like... whatever (23 now). I'm not sure what elements of my life made the topic easier to address over time, especially because my mother reacted very negatively to the disorder. Having it is troublesome enough, but I'm happy that I'm able to discuss it this transparently and freely if I feel like I must."
Trichsters,3a2nq3,terrevasts,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:10:14 2015 UTC,I started at  11 and didn't know it had a name for a very long time. My mom has it too. Kids made fun of me in high school for it. In college nobody ever commented on it (before I even knew about makeup). Now that I've had periods of not pulling (15 days according to my flair!) I feel more comfortable talking about it. But even with really close friends I don't always discuss it unless it comes up
Trichsters,3a2nq3,KittenImmaculate,4,Tue Jun 16 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"You know, there are some people that actually  shave their eyebrows off or dye them and it falls off.  You could just say either of these excuses.  I don't know.  I would recommend  to take up knitting  or some excercise  so that you are  busy most of the time and don't have the time to pull."
Trichsters,3a2nq3,th3whom,3,Tue Jun 16 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"Fellow eyebrows-only puller checking in - I would 100% do this. I don't think a little white lie while you're getting to know new people and starting a new part of your life is a bad idea. You'll make some very close friends that you'll be honest with. In the meantime, though, if anyone even dares to ask, or gives you a funny look, just casually say you wanted to experiment with shaving them off, or say you lost a bet (come up with a good story of course, haha). Be as casual about it as you can, and try your best to be relaxed while you're putting on makeup in front of everybody. Remember they are all freaking out about their own body stuff too and not paying as much attention to you as you might think they are.   Good luck at school. Hopefully you'll be so into classes and friends and things that your pulling slows or stops altogether. Hang in there!"
Trichsters,3a2nq3,heifandheif,4,Tue Jun 16 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"It's tenuous, yes. I never actually told my old roommate (post-college) that I had trich but I'm sure she was puzzled about my lack of eyebrows when she'd come in to tell me something (too lazy to grab makeup when I was at home if she knocked). Either you just let your roommate think what she thinks, or you tell her what's up. If you know her contact info before hand, it may be simpler to write an email or send a message rather than having to do it in person. ""Hey ____, I'm so excited to meet you soon! I just wanted to let you know that I have a hair-pulling disorder called trichotillomania. It sucks and it makes me pull my eyebrows uncontrollably so sometimes I don't have any left!"" It's up to you, but a light, friendly email might ease some of your stress."
Trichsters,3a2nq3,KittenImmaculate,4,Tue Jun 16 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"I'm another eyebrows-only person, and only one person in over ten years has ever asked. I'm sure most people eventually notice, but no one ever says anything. I wouldn't stress over it at all. And this is through two degrees, several jobs, you get the picture.   I'm sure most of my best friends have noticed me enough to understand why I don't have any, but no one has said anything or ever made me feel weird about it."
Trichsters,3a2nq3,Usamimi,2,Tue Jun 16 22:03:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe this isn't the answer you're looking for, but I've found that it's really helpful to just stop caring about what people think (waaaaayyy easier said than done). I've found that once I start pulling, I feel bad and embarrassed about the new bald spot that's on my head, so I seek comfort, which leads me to more pulling. By taking out the ""feeling embarrassed"" part, I'm breaking the cycle. I'm trying not to pull for me, not for what other people may think of me.   If people notice that I'm walking around with bald spots, they can either ask me about them (and I'll gladly tell them all about trich, OCD, etc), or they can talk about me behind my back and now they're the asshole-- and do I really care what an asshole thinks about me?"
Trichsters,3a2nq3,frizzlechicken,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:07:25 2015 UTC,"In the bathroom, people are probably only thinking about themselves to be honest (how much time they have to shower, how awkward they feel, etc.) so I'm sure most people won't even notice. I would do your makeup in your bedroom instead of the bathroom; I used to keep all my makeup in one of my desk drawers.   If your roommate asks or you feel like telling her, I would just be honest. I find that usually people are more fascinated than anything else when I talk about it. Unlike other people, I have had people ask me what was going on with my eyebrows so I've found it's best just to be frank and tell them what's up. If you make them feel awkward, it will become a bigger deal to everyone. Don't freak out! :)"

Other uses include sulfate repletion in conditions, such as autism, where cysteine and related sulfur amino acids may be depleted.   Acetylcysteine is a derivative of cysteine where an acetyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom. This compound is sold as a dietary supplement commonly claiming antioxidant and liver protecting effects. It is used as a cough medicine because it breaks disulfide bonds in mucus and liquefies it, making it easier to cough up. It is also this action of breaking disulfide bonds that makes it useful in thinning the abnormally thick mucus in cystic and pulmonary fibrosis patients.

Conversely, when I smoked an abnormally large amount like during the summers (somewhere around 1-1.5 ounces a week) I didn't pull at all so for me it was pretty volume and setting dependent.

Trichsters,39lqsc,CamaroM,2,Sat Jun 13 11:20:19 2015 UTC,Smoking just makes me dead tired!  I'm on anti-anxiety/anti-depression medication which seems to help.  I'd be down to smoke more weed to not pull though!
Trichsters,39lqsc,Nightman55,2,Fri Jun 12 18:10:43 2015 UTC,Wow I am new here and have been smoking for a long time. I would say that it could be a toss up for me when I smoke when I am stressed it helps a lot and allows me to pull my self together but sometimes when I am just watching TV I do unconsciously. I am going to start paying attention more now.
Trichsters,39mkcc,depressed1988,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:14:14 2015 UTC,"yes, but i don't make that excuse. and i haven't really pulled lashes in over 5 years.  if you can find a way to do it, you should see a psychologist. there are specialists here: http://www.trich.org/treatment/treatment-provider.html and a lot of other resources on the main page of that site"
Trichsters,39mkcc,spthirtythree,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:56:04 2015 UTC,"I pull my eyelashes but I always just said I do it because I am weird basically, I just recently found out about this condition."
Trichsters,39jyqz,cgupster,2,Fri Jun 12 06:47:46 2015 UTC,if you don't mind my asking-  how were you diagnosed?  what were your symptoms before removal?  how serious of an operation/recovery was it?
Trichsters,39jyqz,crisis_cakes,2,Fri Jun 12 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"There were a few weeks where I was lethargic, running a fever, and vomiting hair- which is what prompted doctors to run an ultrasound. The operation was moderately serious, basically as routine as trichobezoar removal can get. I've had this operation twice at the ages of 5 and 6 and I remember it being pretty painful. Recovery wasn't terrible though, I think it took me 3-4 weeks before I was back in school.  I was diagnosed in 1998, which was when trichotillimania was basically unheard of. No one in my home city knew what this was, my mom eventually found one specialist on the other side of the country from me who knew about this disorder and had him work with my primary doctor at the time. I pulled and swallowed my hair, so the diagnosis was by the book trichotillomania and trichotillophagia.  It's hard dealing with questions about my scar and I hate talking to people about it. I've opened up about it before and I always get the ""Oh! So you're like that girl on My Strange Addiction?!"" No one in my sorority, close friend group, etc. knows that I've go through this."
Trichsters,39jyqz,crisis_cakes,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Glad you've been able to move past it. I was curious about your symptoms because upon reading up on trichobezoars, I found out that apparently one may not display any symptoms until its really severe. That was super scary to me because I've had trichophagia for years and now I'm feeling like I should get my stomach looked at."
Trichsters,39jyqz,bookwithoutpics,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:46:02 2015 UTC,"If I were in your place, I'd just say something like ""I had surgery as a kid and was too young to remember it."" You don't need to say more about it than that."
Trichsters,39j67p,LetsBriHonest,3,Fri Jun 12 02:21:52 2015 UTC,"If you are able to add questions I think maybe a question to identify which type of trich would be helpful. For example, I don't need things such as weaves or wigs because I pull out my eyebrows."
Trichsters,39j67p,aerogirl11,2,Fri Jun 12 02:57:34 2015 UTC,Agreed; same type of trich. Not much you can do other than makeup.

I had to start wearing makeup earlier than most girls. then I thought by switching to my scalp, that no one would notice because I thought I could never pull enough to create a bald spot. :l"
Trichsters,39aewc,pseudoscienceoflove,2,Wed Jun 10 21:24:29 2015 UTC,Congrats! I'm amazed you can wear mascara. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to again because it's too tactiley tempting.

I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone who subscribes here that can't empathize with some, if not all of what you are going through and have gone through.  So before we go any further, know this: you are not alone.  We feel you.  Now take a deep breath, and listen to this carefully: you need to talk to your doctor.  Keep it simple:  just get a referral to a psychologist.  If he asks why, please list the emotional trauma you mentioned above.  That should be more than sufficient.  Then do a little research and find a psych who specializes in OCD.  Hopefully you find a few.  Then the interviews begin!  You need a doc you can trust and confide in.  That might not be the first one you go to and THAT'S OK.  Once you find a good doctor, you'll be on the road to health.  For what it's worth, I spoke to 3 difference docs before I found mine, and I've been with mine for 5 years now.  It's a game changer.  Have I stopped pulling?  Not entirely.  Have I stopped hating myself?  Entirely.  Check in with us any time you need.  We're here for you."

Trichsters,38mj7t,vickevlar,5,Fri Jun 5 04:28:15 2015 UTC,"They probably just thought you have been brushing your hair a lot at your desk (I get huge piles when I brush) and some cleaner was like ""this bitch..."".

I didn't think it was necessarily that they were making a statement about trich specifically, more just a general, ""ew, you're gross"" for losing hair all over the place. But that makes more sense.

AN i really doubt that anyone in your office did this or even know abotu trich. I told my 3 best friends that I had trich a couple years back, and it was funny and weird to me that they had no idea. I would be pullling right in front of them and they didnt even notice. they all had their own little ticks that they paid attention to and not mine. so I Know that if feels like verybody knows but trich is almost invisible if you think abobt it."

If she reaches for her hair, go play with her and keep her hands busy. Eventually she will stop reaching for hair altogether because the process is repeatedly broken.  I feel your pain, and I truly hope this helps."
Trichsters,38j7hx,Westmang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:23:24 2015 UTC,"The exact same thing happened to me with my daughter when she was about 18 months old. I felt such shame and self-loathing. After a few days of deep distress, I resolved not to do it in front of her again. It wasn't easy, but that image in my mind of her making that motion was enough to motivate me. I have never stopped pulling, but never again have I done it in front of her, and quickly she stopped doing it. Not saying this is the healthiest way to deal with it, but it is one less layer of shame. I like Westmang's suggestion too."

Trichsters,38g9n6,gingerminussoul,2,Sun Jun 7 03:27:40 2015 UTC,"For me it's very similar.  Are your kids itchy/crusty/red? If they're not, it's probably just the Trich to be honest.  It's a trichy bastard (ha-ha-ha).  The trigger for me to pull has always been an itching feeling, like the itching will somehow be soothed by the pulling when in fact the pulling just makes the itching worse.  I don't know if that will make you feel better or worse.  But you probably don't have blepharitis unless you have inadvertently caused it by pulling your lashes out (but I've never heard of that).  Some of my coping mechanism is to clean my hair.  I pull far less when I have just cleaned my hair.  Maybe try some of the lid scrubs they have available or washing your face more often and see if that helps?"

Pretty sure I don't have it and the internet was just trying to scare me again. I think you're right and the pulling is making the itchiness worse. It gets to the point where I can't tell whether it hurts or itches. I'll absolutely try washing my face more often and look into better ways to clean my lids.  Good pun, by the way. ;D"
Trichsters,38dzj9,ihaveapentax,2,Wed Jun 3 16:24:07 2015 UTC,"I have trichotillomania, and although I am no expert, I would say the inclusion of other areas (brows, lashes, and pubic hair) would indicate that it is a form of trichotillomania. May I ask what you do with the hairs once they are extracted? The key for me is to see the follicle bulb and feel it. If this is what you are doing then that seems definitive."
Trichsters,38dzj9,RUGoin2TheMallLater,3,Wed Jun 3 16:36:24 2015 UTC,"Also not an expert, but I think it would have to do with whether or not it is an impulse?  Playing with hair to occupy your hands vs. a need to do this"

Trichsters,38dzj9,Calimie,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"It's mostly idly running my hands though my hair. I do know I'm a compulsive picker, though... Fingernails, cuticles, etc. Scalp itching has always been relaxing for me."
Trichsters,38dzj9,KittenImmaculate,2,Thu Jun 4 01:17:39 2015 UTC,I'm not a doctor but I'd say that running your hands through your hair is probably related to the picking. I believe the two of them have common or similar causes.

Trichsters,37u1p8,maggymac,2,Sun May 31 02:06:32 2015 UTC,"Hi fellow trichster! Welcome to the community :) First of all, I also have Trich and am not proud of it.  It has been a struggle since my teenage years all the way up until now at 25 yrs old. I just wanted to throw my perspective out there on the mom situation since mine did the same thing for so many years... My mom was the first to notice my eyelashes getting lighter and lighter back in high school. She would always kinda get on me about it and ask why I wouldnt just stop.  One day when I was at home visiting from college, my mom brought up my eyelashes.  I couldn't handle it anymore so I sorta shouted at her ""Mom I can't just choose to stop. If I could I would, but for now it is impossible."" I explained to her how it is an anxiety disorder and just by her bringing it up would probably result in me pulling more. Once this was all explained, my mom has been much nicer in approaching my trich. She buys me fake lashes and brow pencils just to be supportive.  I wouldn't know this since I am not a mom but I think even though our mothers don't know how to approach Trich, they bring it up because they are concerned. If you talk with your mom about how much it bothers you, she'll probably see how important it is to you and calm down a little.  Hope that helps a little OP!!"

My klonapin is really take as needed for my actual anxiety issues, but since I pull when bored or during every day things not just anxiety, regular anti anxiety medicines were not helping.

Trichsters,37luwe,th3whom,3,Thu May 28 20:26:21 2015 UTC,I actually wore it in a thick headband for a long time. I did blunt bangs too but that stopped working.

Trichsters,37luwe,Bubbleroo,3,Thu May 28 20:42:06 2015 UTC,Holy shir!! How did you do it?
Trichsters,37luwe,Bubbleroo,5,Thu May 28 21:39:24 2015 UTC,Honestly I started counting the hairs I was pulling. Once I really started doing that I wouldn't let myself get over 50. Also I tripped some acid and had a big breakthrough that I was the only one who could change it. I'm not recommending this for anyone or anything it's just what happened. I've been fighting it for at least 10 years.  Anyway nowadays I still count and only pull about 2-10 hairs a day on a bad day. On a good day I catch myself twirling and never pull. Just being conscious of my hands all the time really makes a difference.
Trichsters,37luwe,ophelia_jones,2,Fri May 29 00:45:58 2015 UTC,That's amazing. I had an amazing mushroom trip a few months ago that really helped put me on a path to less anxiety and better treatment of myself. I'm still pulling though. I know I can kick trich's ass though! My biggest worry is that my hair wont grow back the way it used to be. Do you mind me asking if your hair is coming back as thick and strong?
Trichsters,37luwe,librarianglasses,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:51:10 2015 UTC,I don't mind at all! As far as I can tell it is growing out the same. It is damaged and weak where I pull but that's to be expected. I deep condition it a lot though. That seems to help. If I have an urge to pull I will just slather conditioner all over my pull spots too and that deters me!

Trichsters,37druw,imaperson25,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:47:44 2015 UTC,My boyfriend (now husband) figured it out on his own.  He was cool about it and did a lot of reading about it on his own to learn about it.    Getting through this is a long process; it's part of who you are in this chapter of your life.  Don't be ashamed of who you are.
Trichsters,37druw,maggymac,1 point,Wed May 27 00:52:40 2015 UTC,Ah thank you. I think he does suspect something but I dont think Im quite ready to tell him yet.

Took a year to be completely honest with him but now he is the most supportive person about it! At first he didn't understand why I pull but after explaining that it is sort of something I can't just stop, he has actually helped me be more conscious of when I am pulling.  If you think it's gonna be long term with your bf, I suggest telling him when you feel its right. If he is as awesome as my bf, he'll totally understand. Good luck!"

If he's in a relationship with you, you already know he wants to be there for you.

Trichsters,36qt2a,Sawl916,1 point,Thu May 21 11:59:56 2015 UTC,Hairstylist here.  Have you tried a high bun? If you have long enough hair just put it all on top of your head. Maybe tease the inside near the bald patch to make it appear fuller.
Trichsters,36qt2a,KellynHeller,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"The key is finding a place that knows what trich is. If you can call ahead of time and check, it can save you a potentially uncomfortable situation. Happy you took the plunge and that the results were great!"
Trichsters,36qt2a,trichgiddy,1 point,Tue May 26 03:23:59 2015 UTC,"That was my original plan, but after three or four days in a row or regrowth turning into awkward frizz, I got to the point where I didn't care what they thought as long as they could fix it and get me in that day. And I'm crazy impressed with how they did... I feel considerably less reliant on my clips to hide stuff, and less self-conscious in general. And, equally importantly, I have a stylist I feel comfortable going back to."
Trichsters,36schc,ilifan,2,Thu May 21 19:00:00 2015 UTC,"I just had mine cut professionally for the first time in a good 10 years, and was freaking out beforehand. Totally worth the awkwardness though, because even with the spots I have to hide, I look in the mirror and like how my hair looks. That's what I kept telling myself while I waited--that this was a positive thing and the hairdresser has certainly seem worse."
Trichsters,36schc,bookwithoutpics,1 point,Fri May 22 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely anxious about it.  My hair grows about four inches a year, and it's about two feet long--so my short hairs are insanely noticeable. Sometimes I look like a cockatiel. At a point, I had so many short hairs on the back of my scalp that I could form them into bangs (which I have never had). Probably the worst is when they ask what I want done...And when they run into the short hairs, I just have to tell them not to bother with it. My hairdresser cut off a year's length of growth, and now I'm too anxious to go back. I might as well make up for my lack of hair with length. You're definitely not alone, haha."
Trichsters,36prih,undugie,1 point,Thu May 21 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"Since you said you feel like buzzing it makes it worse- I'd say just continuing to grow it out. I have two about quarter sized spots where my hair doesn't grow back correctly, and I just prefer to let my hair grow out and cover them. Ultimately, go with what makes you feel most comfortable."
Trichsters,36prih,Rogue_of_Void,1 point,Thu May 21 05:31:03 2015 UTC,"Just now seeing this! If you're hair stops coming in on that area, you might have put too much of a constant pull on the hair follicles and which means regrowth may take a while. If your looking for a fast solution you could get like some really black dark colored makeup and put it on that spot so your head showing isn't as noticeable. Just an idea. :)"

Trichsters,36ak9g,courtabee,3,Sun May 17 20:37:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't ever take Adderall for my ADD but I did take Concerta. It actually helped because I didn't even pull until I was off of it. I'm not on it anymore just because I don't need medicine anymore. I am on Lexapro (it's an antidepressant) and they upped my dosage to help with the trich, so far so great. Not completely stopped but definitely less than what it used it to be"
Trichsters,36ak9g,redydg,3,Mon May 18 01:26:51 2015 UTC,"Gotta mention that Lexapro happened to be the SSRI that I took when my own trich finally got under control.

Trichsters,36ak9g,Sawl916,2,Thu May 21 12:08:19 2015 UTC,"I've taken many different ADHD medications in the last eight or so years since I was diagnosed with trich. I changed meds every couple months or so because EVERY medication seemed to either make the trich worse, or didn't help my attention at all. However, the worst was definitely Adderall. It would make it so that the ONLY thing I could concentrate on was pulling my hair out for HOURS. Bald spots everywhere and it was just a mess and made me feel neurotic. I really hope your case isn't that bad! You could try lowering your dosage, which has definitely worked for me, or if you're really struggling, try a different drug. Good luck to you!"
Trichsters,36ak9g,HemophilicHamster,1 point,Mon May 18 02:14:50 2015 UTC,"My case was definitely that bad when I was taking Adderall every day. Now I haven't had anyone to prescribe it for the past few months (which means I haven't had anyone to prescribe any other medication for any of my other issues either...) and while I hate my constant state of brain fog, I have noticed that I don't pull out nearly as much hair. I mean, I definitely still pull, but I'm not sitting there for hours unable to do anything but pull my hair out."

I have a ""mild"" case,compared to so many on this thread (only pluck eyebrows) but it go considerably worse on all of my ADD meds. Vyvanse seems the worst for me, with Adderall a close second.   Best thing to do is make sure you do work/activity as the medicine kicks in (try to stay away from activities or anything that will involve triggering you)  Video games help me on my days off.. the controller keeps my hands busy"
Trichsters,36ak9g,_voodoo_child,2,Mon May 18 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"Hi, I also take adderall but at a low dose about every day. I don't think that it helps or that its the cause of the pulling but it does tend to make it worse. However, there are some days that I don't take it that it is also really bad.   It's not bad enough that I feel I should stop taking the adderall because it has its own benefits. But it certainly doesn't help the situation."
Trichsters,36ak9g,projectemily,2,Mon May 18 15:59:07 2015 UTC,I'm currently taking the lowest dose of non-extended release adderall and it definitely has made my trich way worse.

Trichsters,35w88u,beefyxfrog,8,Thu May 14 00:57:47 2015 UTC,I'm with you. I don't see many people post about the beard issue though. I don't chew on mine but I always like to stare at them when I pull them out between my fingers though. It's annoying because there is a specific spot on both sides if my face where I pick so I've got patches on both sides where i pick at it.
Trichsters,35w88u,Undercover_nerd87,3,Thu May 14 03:51:39 2015 UTC,This is what I do exactly. Couple that with some scar tissue from my acne when I was younger and you get about half a beard with a pedo-stache.
Trichsters,35w88u,Alexandurr,6,Thu May 14 05:37:41 2015 UTC,"Guilty.  I don't pull from anywhere else on my body, just the beard hairs on either side of my chin.  I have to shave for a couple weeks when the pulling/stress gets really bad.  If I catch myself starting to pull more than one at a time, I will usually just shave before I pluck a bald spot.  Helps avoid the pulling altogether so I don't fall back on it during a bad stress spell.  What have you guys done to help stave off beard/whisker pulling?"
Trichsters,35w88u,Hsyrn,1 point,Thu May 14 06:21:51 2015 UTC,"Once in a while I have a ""bad session"". I could have a decent beard going before that (although short... long beard hair drives me absolutely insane, I must pull it). But yeah I try to keep it minimal and symmetrical, and also in areas that can be easily shaven (like cheeks or certain parts of beard on neck that can be shaved and still look good).  I haven't had a shaven face since high school and I'm 32 now. So I never go full shave. But if I have done some damage one evening, the next morning I'll wake up and set the trimmer to the shortest setting and do the whole face. This makes it harder to continue picking.  I will usually keep it really trim for a while so the patches fill in with stubble, and then attempt a short/medium length beard again. Usually works for a while, then one night i won't be able to resist and we're back to square one."
Trichsters,35w88u,treeskier82,6,Sat May 16 02:55:10 2015 UTC,"Right with you. I constantly feel for rough or misshapen hairs and pull them out. It's not as bad as it was when I first started growing out my beard, but yeah, it's there. You aren't alone."
Trichsters,35w88u,Mughi,6,Thu May 14 11:26:31 2015 UTC,"27/M here. I am a big (almost reformed) beard picker (amongst other things, dermatillomania). I have done a few things for my beard which I feel have helped a lot.   Ingrown hair serum (Legole, an Australian brand) has worked well. I think the active ingredient is borax, but I may be really wrong.   I have another product that I use, something like 'no more bumps',  but I don't think it is as good as the legole stuff.   I also switched from an electric razor to a beard trimmer (with plastic guard) and trim it to 1mm. I have also started using a double edge razor every few weeks.   Another big one is hygiene. Keeping my pillow cases washed, sheets changed frequently, washing my hands,  washing my face with a gentle soap and using an acidic exfoliation cream. Staying clear of bad foods (but that might be my imagination).   Remember that the pulling creates more problems and you get into a vicious cycle.   Check my comment history and you should be able to find some of my progress pictures. I will try to take some more soon."
Trichsters,35w88u,codhopper,5,Thu May 14 06:41:51 2015 UTC,"30/M - I can't not pull my beard!  I've been trying to grow something on my face for a few months, yet as soon as the hairs are grabbable I'm going to sit at my desk all day yoinking them out.  I just pull a bald patch, shave it all off and start again.  Few weeks ago i flipped my keyboard upside down and the amount of chin hairs that fell out was absolutely disgusting.  I don't bite or eat them, I just roll them in my fingers till i drop them, and then pull another. All. Day. Long."
Trichsters,35w88u,TheBestWifesHusband,1 point,Thu May 14 08:24:44 2015 UTC,"So I guess we established that I may not be strange for pulling it out, but I may be the only person on earth that eats them. Ugh great!"

I want a luscious beard but I pull and eat when driving, sitting at my desk, and other times especially when I'm stressed. Long car drives require post drive shaves (like 6 hours) and I wish I could stop. I try to, and my gf stops me, but it's just so damned hard and I like the feel of a beard hair rolling between my teeth. Ugh."
Trichsters,35w88u,not_good_at_lurking,2,Thu May 14 18:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yep.  It's the main reason I have to stay clean shaven.  If I try to grow a beard, within a week, I'll have pulled half of it out.  I'll even stop pulling my other areas I usually pull from, and focus entirely on the beard until I shave it off."
Trichsters,35w88u,BigBlue615,2,Thu May 14 11:40:00 2015 UTC,"Until recently I had ONLY been a scalp puller, but in the last few months I've started pulling from other places.  Specifically in the last few weeks I've been pulling from my beard.  I've found that getting follicles (the main thing I'm pulling for as I'm sure a lot of you are) is REALLY easy from there most of the time."
Trichsters,35w88u,Magnum3point14159,2,Thu May 14 13:47:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm a beard puller, to the exclusion of all other areas except my right calf. I had been growing a big beautiful beard since November last year, which was such a big deal for me. Then a month ago somehow just stayed up til like 4am compulsively 'fixing' the bits that felt weird, and finally went to it with scissors and the razor just to stop pulling and get some sleep. I thought I had honestly gone insane. Unfortunately I'm already back to pulling the growth I have right now, but I finally booked in with a psych to address some anxiety issues, so hopefully that will help.  Like most of the answers here, I just typically roll the hair around and drop it. But sometimes I bite out my moustache hairs and eat them, so you're not alone with that. I don't think it's particularly uncommon for people with trich to do it, but just be careful because I've heard it can ball together in your system and cause some problems.  Anyways, good luck to everyone dealing with this. It really sucks, but it's good to know that we're not alone."
Trichsters,35w88u,muchgreaterthanG_O_D,2,Thu May 14 14:58:56 2015 UTC,"Same. I always touch my beard, feeling for rough hairs that might signify a split end to pull out. I also like to put my mustach in my mouth and use my teeth to pull out hairs. I don't swallow them though."
Trichsters,35w88u,darrylmacstone,2,Thu May 14 18:21:14 2015 UTC,I've had the same issue for the last seven years or so. Chew on the hairs and do all that save the swallowing. I know it sucks but the best thing to do by far is to just shave it off and keep it off for awhile. After going clean shaven for a month or so I usually can go awhile with the beard back in before I eventually cave in and start pulling again.
Trichsters,35w88u,gillyboatbruff,2,Thu May 14 19:29:04 2015 UTC,"I constantly pull hair out of my chin.  I really enjoy it, and I don't really have any consequences for my actions because having bald spots on my chin isn't a big deal when I shave every day.  I'll do it in front of my friends, and if they ask why, I'll tell them.  I actually feel kind of guilty that I can enjoy this and not face the consequences that most everybody else here does."

Trichsters,35w88u,treeskier82,2,Thu May 14 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"Beard puller here. I always keep my beard short. If it gets too long it starts to become obvious where it's been thinned out.  My strategy is to pull as symmetrically as possible. Lately I've been pulling more from my cheeks, so I try to pull as high as possible and then shave it later. Sometimes I end up with more of a chin-strap beard than I'd like, but at least it looks intentional.  Lately I've also been hitting the sideburns. For whatever reason I focus on the same areas. Again, I try to keep it symmetrical, which also reduces the amount pulled on both sides. I trim it short frequently. I don't even really do sideburns anymore, and I let the hair above the sideburns grow a little longer to cover up the thin strip. And now, those hairs that cover it are my favorite to pull. Go figure.  It's definitely an exercise in self control. There's plenty of times when I have a nice full short beard going and looking pretty good  -- my confidence goes way up.... but damn is it satisfying to pull hairs and hard to stop once I get started.  Usually I do it in the evenings and many times evaluate the damage in the morning and then it's time for a trim down to stubble and cleaning up around the edges with a razor."

It was difficult to conceal and I was ashamed from the comments of my family and classmates, so I stopped. When I picked up the eyelash habit years later at 16, I also pulled from my brows. But I got tired of having drawn-on eyebrows that also got me negative attention, so I eventually stopped.  I think what makes the eyelashes so difficult is that, even though it's on the most obvious part of you, it's so easy to conceal with eyeliner! I wear a sort-of cat eye thing, so no one ever notices unless they're REAL close to me. I want to throw away all my eyeliner and be forced to go out and face everyone like this... maybe I need to feel the shame I felt with my bald spot and my fake brows...

Trich is actually an obsessive compulsive disorder so your 'symptoms', or whatever you want to call them, are right on the mark.  I began pulling as a teen by only plucking hairs that were not in the right place... according to my mind.  Eventually my trich moved onto pulling eyelashes and eyebrows.  My biggest suggestion to you is that if you can get rid of the hair all together with laser hair removal AND avoid the plucking, then do it! But I know I would have a hard time breaking the physical habit of getting the urge to pull/plunk and not going through with it on other hair... Which is what Trich does to most people. So I guess what I am saying is that if you can control it with removing the hair then thats awesome since most Trichsters can't! Wishing you the best of luck OP!!"
Trichsters,3596im,maggymac,1 point,Fri May 8 14:14:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I do pluck from my head, but the way you explained it is pretty much exactly how I feel. I only pull the hairs that feel wrong and out of place and weird when I tug at it. I also only pull out single hairs at a time and it takes me minutes to find the ""right"" one, or in my case the one that feels the most ""wrong""..  I don't think it means you're crazy, but it is an underlying symptom of some kind of anxiety or stress you probably have. That, or I'm also crazy."

Trichsters,356kn0,ANerdAward,3,Thu May 7 15:55:24 2015 UTC,Yea I was thinking mid-length and shorter layers towards the top.  Adding some lighter high lights on the top area will help give the illusion that your hair is fuller instead of contrasting with the paler color of the scalp.  The shorter layers at the top you can kinda scrunch up and play with more volume to help cover up any thin spots.  A cut like this would be versatile and look good wavy or straight!  http://hairstylesweekly.com/images/2012/10/Ashley-Benson-Medium-Wavy-Hairstyle-with-Layers.jpg

Another thing that I do to work on this is to avoid any dandruff on my scalp. I have a mild allergy to shampoo, and even the most benign shampoos or medicated shampoos haven't really helped - the only one that seemed to help had salicyclic acid in it, hence my inspiration to try scalpicin. SO I do No Poo (it took me years and years to get started with No Poo, it is not insignificant). Google it if you don't know what No Poo is. As a part of that, I scrub my scalp with conditioner, before rinsing and doing a regular full-length conditioner treatment.  Hope this helps."

In the matter of an hour or more . She drew it in with an eyebrow pencil first and cleaned it up with a w q tip. I didn't really debate on it too much because it felt really confident in what she was doing and she actually addressed some of my insecurities ( my hair was growing back underneath my natural brow bone so she placed them a little higher which I love ) that and it luckily ended up like my natural brows were, but nicely thinned. She got up in my space but she did it so it fits my bone structure . I guess finding someone that is good helps the nerves. And honestly just HAVING brows there seemed to be bigger than the shape. I was super nervous and didn't sleep the night before but it wasn't as bad or indecisive as I thought I would be  It also helps to know that after the first trip it does fade quite a bit so it was really easy to add onto it with the second layer of pigment .

Trichsters,34jso8,tidal-wavve,6,Fri May 1 19:28:46 2015 UTC,"Over the last few years I found a sort of acceptance with trich. I still pull, sometimes to the extent of having my hands in pain, but definitely not as much as I used to. I found some comfort here, just knowing that I was not alone and that this is a real thing. Not just some effed up thing that I do. I have a disorder, I can do little about it, I try to avoid pulling, and I should try to not feel ashamed when I fail. I still get feelings of shame and regret but this mindset has helped. I just kinda shrug it off and not stress over it. I pull more when I am stressed and I get more stressed when I pull or obsess over not pulling.   Edit: I don't want to come accross as saying ""give up"" and let the storm swallow you.

It helps to put it in perspective and help me realize that it may suck, but it's not the end of the world. The other thing that I've started doing recently is to pamper my hair a bit... doing a nice hair masque or something makes me feel like I'm taking care of my hair even though I pull it and it's thin, if that makes sense."
Trichsters,34ig7o,AlexisAmory,3,Fri May 1 12:52:50 2015 UTC,DON'T pull out your other brow - that will just set you back more. Do you have any kind of eyeliner that matches your brow color or a brow pencil? For now I would just draw your missing brow in using light strokes. I think it's much better to have a slightly mismatched brow than two missing ones.  I've found that Anasstasia Dipbrow is great for drawing in my brows - I follow this tutorial and it looks fairly natural.
Trichsters,34ig7o,JessiTee,3,Fri May 1 13:25:56 2015 UTC,"Same advice as Jessi- use an eyeliner pencil to draw/fill it in. I use a brown scroll - up pencil thing from Clinique. If you want, PM me and I'll Skype you to show you how I do it. :)"
Trichsters,34ig7o,cinemachick,2,Fri May 1 13:32:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't pull out the other eyebrow, just pencil/color in both. When I have brows in (more or less) I use Benefits brow zings, and when I'm brow(s)-less I use an eyeliner pencil (light brown, I can't recall the brand at the moment but it's a drug store brand that is made to match blue eyes and is slightly darker than my hair color) and a light brown shadow over it. I don't do super-defined eyebrows, just a basic blunt end on the inside tapering off toward the end. I feel like the pencil/shadow combination and less defined edges looks more natural, personally. Also, if you aren't used to drawing in eyebrows & don't know where they should end, here's my go-to tip: hold a pencil from the edge of your nostril and line it up with the outer corner of your eye, and where it hits on your brow ridge is where your eyebrow should end.   Hope that all makes sense! Best of luck!"
Trichsters,34ig7o,sigmasunshine,1 point,Fri May 1 13:31:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! I have naturally ginger red hair, but my brows are a more like a medium brown with red (they've gotten darker after so many years of pulling). I saw a tutorial that looked simple enough where you use some kind of eye pencil thing that looked like a rounded blunt pencil to get the shape of the brow and then she went over it with a super pointy liner thing to mimic tiny hairs. Any ideas on products that could work for me? Sorry I have so many questions, I'm pretty clueless about makeup haha. Thanks again!"
Trichsters,34ig7o,sigmasunshine,1 point,Fri May 1 16:20:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I only just saw this reply!  I'm dirty blonde but have dyed my hair red at times and actually found many of my products match better, so I hope some of these work for you! The pencil I mentioned using when I'm brow-less is Almay i-color (the one to ""match"" blue eyes). It's in a plastic case, though, so it won't really get super-pointy, as you just twist it up. If you're looking for a thick pencil, I use a Milani one that's actually called an eyeshadow pencil, but it's great for getting in the broad shape, as you said. For a smaller pencil you can sharpen, I just get Rimmel soft kohl ones and a sharpener to keep it at a nice fine point. I'd suggest a translucent powder (Almay or Covergirl, they sell them in skin tones but the lightest will just be color-free) to set it all, too.   And, if you have the time (sorry again! D:) I'd suggest trying all this a day in advance of your interview. Not only will you be able to get your technique figured out, but you'll have a day to get used to the feeling, which for me means less creaking out/wondering if everyone is staring at me the day in question. Best of luck in eyebrow and job-related realms!"
Trichsters,34ig7o,KittenImmaculate,2,Mon May 4 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"When I was missing most of my brows, an Anastasia pencil worked well. It has a tiny tip that you can make little brow like marks on there in an eyebrow like fashion. Sorry you pulled it all out! I know how embarrassing it can be.

In a worst case scenario if you can get past the awkwardness, places like Sephora will do 10-minute makeup touch ups, etc."

I am actually totally unaware of other people's eyebrows. I never look to see if they have any or not. If I saw someone without eyebrows, I have no idea if I would notice - the same way I don't notice or care if someone isn't wearing makeup, actually. I only notice if it is very obviously there, or smudged or something.  Even though I am just one person with a particular view of the world, what I'm saying is, it's probably more an issue for you than for anyone else, and I can only think of a handful of jobs for which your candidacy could legitimately be rejected for 'lack of eyebrow hair.' Win people over with whatever other qualities you have at your disposal, whatever the situation, and no one will care."

Trichsters,33ncji,dezeiram,3,Thu Apr 23 22:43:03 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you're going through a rough patch. At least you have periods of non pulling. I've been a lash puller for 18 years now and have only ever had one two week period of non pulling. You're doing better then some.
Trichsters,33ncji,caracakes,3,Fri Apr 24 04:40:12 2015 UTC,"Willpower is a big factor, but as we all know it's definitely not the only thing that will keep you from pulling. Think about how you stopped in the first place and what strategies you used to use to stop.  I also pull at my eyelashes and I know not everything works for everyone but I find a few things have helped me:   Wearing my glasses. Or fake ones. Whatever works. But you can't pull your lashes if you can't get to them Finding something that mimics the sensation I try and get from pulling. When I'm searching for the right eyelash there's a certain tactile stimulation I like. I try and find things that I can simulate that feeling with Washing my face with cold water. Seems to help somewhat. Sitting on my hands and meditating for a few minutes   Obviously these won't work for everyone but I'm in the thick of exams and pretty stressed and these have been working (somewhat) for me lately.

Trichsters,33hrs5,clothesgirl,6,Wed Apr 22 22:47:01 2015 UTC,"PREACH.   I've had this disorder for 21 years. If my trich were a human it would be able to go drinking with its buddies Anxiety and Self-Loathing today.   NOTHING has cured me. Nothing will. It is not an addiction and it does not feel good. It hurts. I can use strategies to minimize the time and suffering involved, with some success- but nothing and I mean NOTHING has helped me as much as having a partner who isn't weirded out. This is what has helped me: having a husband who thinks I'm beautiful despite the patchy bald bits, who will hide the tweezers for me if I want him to but who doesn't really think it's necessary unless that's what I want. I'm not over the self-loathing but I am beginning, finally, to accept that this is part of my neurological wiring, a stress-release valve of some kind, and hating it or being ashamed of it is similar to being ashamed of my left knee."
Trichsters,33hrs5,verdantthorn,5,Wed Apr 22 22:52:00 2015 UTC,"Wow. I'd never heard of that link between trich + lack of safety around caregivers before, but it's true in my case. I don't know that I want to place some of the responsibility on anyone else for my condition, though. I think it's maybe more complex or less complex.  In any case, I accept I'll never stop, which ironically makes me trich less."
Trichsters,33hrs5,TSOAPM,4,Wed Apr 22 23:55:06 2015 UTC,"There is no responsibility being placed on anyone for the condition; the condition just is, like many disorders. However, there is a strong correlation between trauma and attachment problems and trichotillomania, and that's a fact that goes missing entirely in treating it, as that Buzzfeed article demonstrates.  I find this is a massive gap in the treatment of the disorder. Instead of trying to treat the symptoms, which parents seems to react to with hysteria and anger and militant action, we should look harder at what this stems from. Most sufferers indicate they had a major loss or trauma in childhood that went unaddressed and that they didn't have parental support, and that they are highly sensitive by nature. Yet we rely mostly on a highly punitive and shame based model of treatment. Nobody seems to put education in place for the almost always angry parents, who treat it like nail biting or thumb sucking, and this further distances the sufferer.   This article puts it into the best explanation possible: http://www.pullfreeatlast.com/trichotillomania-facts/beneath-trichotillomania.html. I realize it's anecdotal, but it has to be remembered that with so little research and with such shame based management techniques in place, getting a good clinical picture of a trichotillomania sufferer is next to impossible, as they get obfuscated by symptom treatment alone.   I think we've been blamed long enough for our ""choice"" to have a ""bad habit"". It isn't about placing responsibility on others, but it's about taking the blame squarely off our shoulders and for once considering the psychological roots of the disorder. It's been ignored too long."

I've managed my trich with gabapentin, and she didn't send me to a psychiatrist. So, some primary care drs can help, but it is hit and miss with medication that they prescribe.

I told him that I had been pulling my hair compulsively and after doing some research on my own, I believed I had trich and wanted help with it.  His reaction was supportive and understanding. Since then he has been helpful in prescribing medicine to help with the anxiety associated with it and we talk about how I can work to manage my trich and ADD when I see him every month. I still try to educate myself about it and work on it on my own as medication alone has helped a bit but I feel compelled to pull a fair amount.

I just flat out said,"" I pull out my hair, it started because of stress but now I do it out of habit.  I have tried to stop several times, but I have no control over it"". She asked me several questions, and I was referred to a psychiatrist.    My advice: -Don't wait last minute in the appointment to tell your doctor.. Leave yourself plenty of time to discuss whats going on  -Go in prepared.  If you don't know already... really look at what makes you pull & when you pull (this will help them match you to a specialist OR if your new doctor knows how to treat it, they will be able to prescribe the right meds.

I will often pull a lot of hairs around the target, which will have a deep root.   It's only after I start with one that I can't stop.

As trich is a mental disorder it's hard to make broad, generalizing statements, but it's basically the sense of relief after pulling a hair from the body. In a sense it's very similar to an addiction, as the brain releases dopamine when the anxiety associated with that pull is soothed.   There are medications available. Some choose them, others don't. I personally haven't but I know people have had success with a variety of them.  Some symptoms very often associated with trich are shame, guilt, etc. This is a place where you don't have to feel those things, and can learn not to feel that way about your trich outside of the internet. Hopefully you can find the help you need out there in the real world! I'd say your best bets are a solid, supportive group of family or friends, a mental health professional if available, and some willpower to overcome it! Best of luck!"

Trichsters,333dpb,helix19,3,Sun Apr 19 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"I think the point was to display how trich doesn't affect your whole life. There are so many articles that solely face on trich itself, and not actually showing that someone doesn't have to be defined by trich."
Trichsters,333dpb,thepanichand,6,Sun Apr 19 23:49:45 2015 UTC,"This article illustrates everything I hate about the behavioural therapy model of treatment; the remark by the doctor about when she'll ""be ready to stop trichin"", and her parents bursting into her room and shrieking at her to stop just show that shame is currently the basis of every trichotillomania treatment and approach we currently use. And that's totally, utterly wrong. It isn't a goddamned choice to have this compulsion, and while techniques to avoid it can help, it's not an addiction to be beaten. It is a primal self-soothing behaviour, and attaching shame and anger to it only makes it worse, making a tenuous attachment to your parents even more strained, and reinforcing that even those who are professionally trained to help us can't be trusted not to make us feel ashamed.  I'm 40 and have had the disorder for 25 years. I'd never go near a behavioural therapist, and yet I'm nearly pull free. Part of the reason for that is that I accept I can only exert a certain amount of control over it, and that I cannot stop the compulsion to do so. I refuse to feel ashamed of this or like it's a bad habit; it's how I survived really bad periods. Every time I've been shamed or scolded for it, it's reminded me that treating someone like that shows a real lack of love. You aren't supporting the person with the disorder, you're alienating them further by hating what is an integral part of who they are.   One of the reasons trichotillomania appears is because there is a lack of secure attachment in their lives. We should instead be shoring the sufferer up emotionally and making them feel valued and connected to their family and professionals; they're really doing more damage frantically trying to stop it. I won't even subscribe to the sub because I can't stand to hear the shame, both self and other inflicted. Nobody should feel like this over a *psychiatric disorder *."

I shave my arms and legs, to prevent pulling there and minimize appearance. As a male I'm not really expected to have beautiful eye lashes. As such, I am almost never questioned about it even by very close friends, although I do beat myself up over it and sometimes feel it makes coworkers uncomfortable when they look me in the eye.  The only issue was my parents calling attention to my eyelashes, and some embarrassment I feel going to work or out on a first date without any eyelashes after a rough evening. I do feel lucky that as a guy, in that there are pretty much no standard of eye beauty/appearance.   On a lighter note, I did try mascara when I stated college.

Trichsters,32zklq,anxiousdummy,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:30:49 2015 UTC,"I understand how you're feeling. I've felt the same pressure from my parents over the years. When I was younger, my parents would take me to doctor, but back then trich wasn't widely known and there wasn't a lot of research so my doctor basically just put me on random medicines that were ""trial and error."" My parents were so frustrated that I wasn't getting better and I didn't know what to do so I basically gave up. I thought everything was my fault and although my parents were trying to help me (however, they were going about it the wrong way by yelling at me to stop and jerking my hand away from my head whenever possible), I could see they were also hurting thinking they had done something wrong that made me have this destructive behavior.  A few years ago I was reading an article where they discovered that trich is something that one doesn't just get rid of; it's something that can be calmed and controlled but can never be cured. I told my mom about this and she seemed skeptical, as if I was lying or something.   After finding this subreddit I was so happy to have found a support group that actually understands what I'm going through. Some threads really encouraged something I was very hesitant to do: shave my head. I mentioned this to my SO and parents as something I was interested in doing, and although I got tons of support from my SO, my parents were less than supportive. They would make excuses and list reasons why it was a huge mistake to do that, and they would also tell me it wouldn't work and that I basically couldn't go through with it. My parents are pretty conservative, so anything unconventional freaks them out and they're quick to criticize. Anyway, that made me super upset because I look to my parents for acceptance a lot of the time, and it's not always openly given when I want it to be.   However, I do love my parents even though we don't always see eye-to-eye on scenarios. I know they think they're trying their best when handling my trich, but the way they thought they were helping me has hurt me over the years. I know it's difficult not to get support from parents, but honestly I'm used to it now and I don't really talk to them about it and only go to the people I know will support me. If you have any questions or ever want to talk more, feel free to PM me. r/Trichsters is an awesome subreddit full of support, and I've gotten a lot of positive feedback from them so posting here is a great resource!

Also, go bold on hair accessories."
Trichsters,32s6af,imalittlemeatloaf,6,Thu Apr 16 07:40:04 2015 UTC,"There are claims of serums, shampoos, and other snake oil that want you to believe hair can be regrown faster, but I don't believe any of these voodoo remedies have any basis in science.  When my damaged areas finally regrew, the color and density of the area was very different from what it was. I'm also getting older so it might be partially age related.   It'll take a while to start the entire growth process over if you've ripped them out by the root. It's also possible to damage the follicle but even then, it will grow back but at a reduced rate due to the damage.  Here's am absolutely ugly website recounting one trichsters knowledge gained from a conference on trich led by an alleged hair biologist.    http://home.intekom.com/jly2/ttmhairgrowth.htm  Myths vs. Facts (from the website above)  Myth - There is a pervasive, erroneous worry out there that ""root"" pullers damage their hair more than the ""other"" pullers.  Myth - If/ when you pull and get the ""white"" thing, you won't get their hair back, or higher probability that you won't get your hair back.  Myth - If you see blood, or other stuff attached to the root, you won't get your hair back, or higher probability that you won't get your hair back.  FACT - If the hair comes out, the root IS out, and ALWAYS is out, no matter what is attached to it.   FACT - It DOESN'T matter anyway, because the old root DOES NOT generate the new hair.   FACT - The MAJORITY of us can have TOTAL regrowth!  FACT - VERY IMPORTANT - What you may or may not see attached to the root has NO affect on possibility for regrowth. It is NOT a sign of permanent damage! People see all kinds of weird things on the roots - and there are tons of things that go in that make the root look different at different times in the growth stages - size, shape, color, stuff attached to it, etc.  FACT - Pulling lots of the white things means you are pulling all the ""Youngest"" hairs. It may mean it takes longer for those hair follicles to gear up again since they normally wouldn't regrow until that hair died and fell out naturally.   FACT - Pulling the kinky hairs will probably make them even more kinky - further SLOWING down the healing process for that follicle.   FACT - Pulling the extra thin (peach fuzz) hairs makes the healing process START over, you would have to get a new extra thin (peach fuzz) hair, before you could get a regular hair, so you are SLOWING down the healing process.   FACT - You can see above how our own pulling patterns can make us think we are not getting our regular hair back, when in fact we ARE!"

Trichsters,32s6af,StrangeQuark1,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:03:30 2015 UTC,"I would think that if they are the beginnings of a new / young hair, that yanking it would mean starting the entire process over again."

There's going to be a period where it has to start the entire growth process over and perhaps those follicles are damaged or not in a growth period. Just my semi-educated guesses."

This is a similar idea, but was written specifically for skin picking http://www.trich.org/treatment/SkinPickingStrategies.html  Basically figure out where you are pulling, are you pulling on your couch in the evening, in your car while driving, while laying in bed reading?  Think about each of those situations and figure out what your 'triggers' are.  Use the SCAMP model to figure this out: Sensory, Cognitive, Affective(Emotions), Motor, Place/Environment. Once you think you have an idea what your trigger or triggers are, come up with two or three strategies for each of those times you are pulling.  Here is an example for me: I pull in the car...I figured out that I am pulling because I am bored in the car, and because it's become an automatic behavior.  I am going to use the following strategy: listen to upbeat, singable music in the car, keep a fiddle toy, like a Tangle on my steering wheel, and try to actively keep both hands on the wheel."

I had a few years of college where my trich was really bad, and then for some reason I managed to not pull (other than small things, but not big patches or complete baldness) for about a year... and that streak ended with my beginning lexapro.   I'm thinking that it partially has to do with dissociation and pain levels - I was very dissociative and felt numb (albeit with some general all over pain that was hard to distinguish) most of the time until I started lexapro. Once I had started, I get a lot of tension in my jaw along with clenching/grinding at night and eventually my jaw locked which was super painful.. I think the pain might contribute to the pulling, as I've been trying to be super conscious of when I pull since I made this post and I've noticed that high pain levels = high pulling action.   So maybe not directly related/caused by the medication, but some of the effects brought back my desire to pull through causing me to experience/process more pain.. I think!"

My psych and I talked about cymbalta as an option in the future if I feel like the lexapro isn't enough, especially because it has indications for treating pain (which definitely increases my pulling, which maybe is part of what triggered this episode). Do you think the cymbalta was just a bad match for you?"

I have trich and I am a professional hair stylist and I absolutely hate when I hear these stories about other hair stylists calling you weird because of trich.  I got so lucky growing up. Obviously my hairdresser recommend I stop, but she never was rude about it and would cut my hair to hide it.  I actually had a couple clients with trich. I end up doing their mothers and their mothers tell me how much they love my thick hair and then I tell them that I used to have giant bald patches. Then they are like MY KID DOES THAT TOO. It's so hard to get the child to actually come in. :(  Anyway, the bald looks awesome on you! Hope it works. What worked for me was being able to play with other people's hair every day. Good luck!

Trichsters,32agwb,noshoesrequired,1 point,Sun Apr 12 06:53:06 2015 UTC,"when i am actively trying not to pull i will play with a pen or spin a ring in my hands. it might have to do with the fingertip stimulation.  it is very noticeable and people have commented on how much i fidget with my hands. but at the end of the day i would prefer to look fidgety than to be pulling at my hair, so i guess it seems worth it."
Trichsters,32agwb,senor_fox,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:20:26 2015 UTC,"Me too! I put a hat on when I manage to try and stop myself from pulling and/or try to prevent myself from pulling. But the urge will just eventually migrate to my eyelashes/eyebrows, then biting my nails and the skin around them. Or I'll chew on the inside of my cheek and pull skin off my lips.   I tried habit replacement a couple of different ways, but I think the only thing that's really kept me from doing any of those things is standing up and going for a walk/run. Fresh air helps relieve some of my urges."
Trichsters,326n62,Mary_V,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:59:17 2015 UTC,"Bipolar as well. I'm on lithium too and some other anti-psychotics. I've found that I still get anxious, it just makes it more bearable to deal with. It's easier for me to rationalize and do other things to decrease the anxiety I have. Personally I try to do other things to keep my hands busy, like write or draw.  I have bad days still, and will still pull occasionally, but it's definitely helped. Word of caution though, lithium can dehydrate you, make sure to drink plenty of water and don't skip doses. It can mess with the levels in your blood."

Right now I'm doing the benzodiazepines in the evening, but I can't work/drive while on them. They also aren't really helping with the hives."

Trichsters,326n62,thepanichand,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:16:13 2015 UTC,Lamictal plus NAC. I've learned NAC works better if you dose at eight hour intervals as it has a short half life; I dose 1000 mg three times a day and with that combined with Lamictal have next to no pulling. It's awesome.
Trichsters,323coe,thebaneofmyexistence,2,Fri Apr 10 06:20:05 2015 UTC,"Mine seems to be somewhat related to a combination of boredom, anxiety, and depression.

Outside of this time I will pull when I am either bored or experiencing high anxiety"
Trichsters,323coe,rockyrikoko,2,Fri Apr 10 06:49:55 2015 UTC,"This is similar to my experience.

But I have often thought if the true root of it, was something related to Body Dysmorphic Disorder.  I found that my hair pulling usually stems from an underlying feeling that I have hair out of place and I have to fix it, which leads to me playing with that hair, which leads to me pulling that hair out - because it either feels weird or out of place."
Trichsters,323coe,diadexus,2,Fri Apr 10 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"Mine is a complicated self-soothing gesture I think.   When I was younger, until about the age of 13, I sucked my thumb until my parents succeeded in shaming me into quitting. I figure I began pulling at my eyelashes soon after (I only made the connection recently, I'm 21 now). It's calming and grounding to have my hand resting on my face, and reminiscent of sucking on my thumb.   It's probably got something to do with the safe feeling of having my face party obscured, despite only pulling in private and before going to sleep."

Trichsters,323coe,TheAdvisor336,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"There is one thing about the energy release theory that has always stumped me. When I'm rubbing and pulling or if I'm in any other kind of compulsive trance, my muscles get tense, I get short of breath, and my chest gets tight. It's like it causes the energy to mount and mount but never release. Yet I can't stop. I can try, and I will say to myself ""Okay, this is it! I am never doing this again!"" and within five minutes I have already started rubbing again (scalp) without even realizing it."
Trichsters,323coe,mkl67,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"I believe there is a biological basis for this disorder related to auto-immunity. When my daughter first started pulling at 6 years old and I took her to the doctor, she tested positive for strep. Apparently there is a condition called PANDAS where one's own immune system attacks neuropathways in the brain instead of the virus. She took a 10 day course of antibiotics but continued pulling, and tested positive for strep again. A different antibiotic cured the strep but the pulling continued. Eventually PANDAS was ruled out because she did not have the intermittent waxing and waning that is necessary for the diagnosis. Around age 7 she stopped pulling out of the blue. She said the urge to do it just went away. After a year of no pulling she had a swine flu vaccine...pulling began again with a vengeance within 2 weeks of that shot. I'm not an anti-vax person but I can't shake the thought that there was some connection. She also had an auto immune related blood disorder called ITP when she was three. So of course I brought this all up to my doctor and she said it's possible there is some connection, unfortunately it simply hasn't been studied enough. But there are some studies that suggest Tourette's and OCD may be linked to the immune system. It's a fascinating topic and I wish I was a lot younger so I might be able to get a real education and study it in more depth."

In fact, we have the same pull pattern minus the sideburns since I'm a lady.  My behind-the-ear pattern resulted at heavy re-training because having a ginormous bald spot on the top of your head is all kinds of traumatising as a woman. Behind my ears is much easier to hide with longer hair. Still pull from the crown, but it is lesser these days."
Trichsters,323dob,rabbita,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:22:46 2015 UTC,"Behind the ear's puller here too, just for the reasons you described.

I had straight hair as a kid but around age 13/14 it started to become curly/wavy. I've heard of people whose hair has changed in their 20s or after having kids. I don't pull from my scalp so I don't really know if that would effect it or not. Your hair could also be too long to curl everywhere. I grow my hair out and donate it about every 4 years and when it gets to the point where its long enough to donate, its usually too heavy to curl anywhere but the bottom."

Trichsters,3215ec,Naninana,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:52:11 2015 UTC,"I've actually seen this topic discussed multiple times in this sub and most people agree that the damage to the follicle from pulling causes the hair to grow back curlier. Personally, as a kid my hair was a wavy mess. Then I pulled heavily from 2nd grade through about 5/6th grade (to the point people thought I was having chemo) when it grew back it was tight ringlet curls. It stayed as curls until about 10th grade and then it slowly started growing in as the same texture as when I was a kid. But as PigsJillyJiggs said, other things can change it too and your hair might just be curly now. I know my mom had stick straight hair most of her life but after having kids her hair has been super tight curls for some reason. The fact that your hair is only curly at the bottom could either be because the follicle is recovering and the newer growth is straighter, or because the weight of the hair pulling it straight."

In all my reading of others experiences, I've identified with many aspects however, never I have I come across anyone with a similar pattern or technique if you will.   Again, I was adopted a few days after birth, and did not meet my biological mother again until early adulthood, and this discovery came several years later- long after we'd identified all we had in common. Genetics are one thing, but it makes my head spin when I try to make sense of how it manifested itself in the exact same way."

Trichsters,31qca8,random-42,4,Tue Apr 7 09:41:36 2015 UTC,"The first thing that I tell anyone who is asking how to help someone with trich is that shame, guilt, and embarrassment are symptoms of trich. You cannot make trich better my making someone feel embarrassed about their disorder! Would you try to solve anxiety by giving someone more things to be anxious about? Her mother did a HUGE disservice to her by treating her daughter the way that she did. That kind of damage is huge and can last years.  Trichotillomania is pretty harmless except for the mental duress caused by people's embarrassment and all that, but trichophagia is actually very dangerous. I hope that she realizes that and seeks help. Medical attention and a very good therapist are in order (and she needs to be honest with the doctors and tell them that she eats her hair.) I hope that this is also a wake-up call for her family-- they have not been supporting her in the right ways and they need to start. My mom tried to ""cure"" my trich my smacking me in the head if she saw me pulling my hair, yelling at me, and forcing me to let her take pictures of the back of my head and show them to me. Ten years later and guess who still has trich?  It's good that she has you and that you're reaching out and trying to help. Just be kind and understanding, don't do anything to cause her any extra stress, but also make sure that she knows how serious this is and that she gets help."

When I finally went to the ER I was shivering not and totally pale (I'm a brown woman). If she is still in this pain and cannot put much into her body, she needs to go to the hospital NOW and say she's concerned of something is lodged in her stomach. And as much it will be hard for her to do, she might have to admit to what she does  Due to my life-threatening status, they did my scans. They asked me if I ate my hair and considering how I had never told anyone before, I lied and said I didn't. They'll know though.   Bezoars are serious. Mine took up the whole volume of my stomach"

In addition to pulling out the hair on my head, I also obsessively pluck the hairs under my chin and on my jawline (yay hirsuitism!), I am a lifelong nail and cuticle biter, I crack my knuckles to the point where I think I damaged one, I pick at scabs and ingrown hairs, and I do violin and flute fingerings on my thumbs or palms (I played both instruments growing up).    I've known for many years that these are all related, just instinctively, but I never really knew what to do with them.

Hair pulling generally comes at stressful times for me, right now I'm trying to pick a grad school, and holidays are much more stressful for me too.  I always get sick around the holidays too.    Since I've had some successful in dealing with the nail biting, I noticed for awhile the hair-pulling got worse because I needed an outlet for the energy.  I talked to my therapist about this yesterday, we're going to work on some ways I can cope with this.  I really love my hair :(  I really don't want to pull it all out of my head!"

I used to pick mostly when I was bored or anxious. The worst was when I was anxious and also not doing anything. Some silly phone games to keep my fingers active has helped as well, I think.

My mom and brother have both made comment to me in the past about my pulling, they would tell my how disgusting it is and how I have no self control, ect. One day I lost it l, I snapped and I told them they were actually making it worse for me, that when they say those things it upsets me and I end up going to my room and pulling even more! It took a few days after I snapped to talk to my mom, I didn't even want to see her she has hurt me so bad and had no idea! I explained to her how those things made me feel. Once we opens up our lines of communication and actually talked about my big elephant in the room (Trich) things were much better. Not long after this blow up I started seeing a new Thespis and I told her the story, she even had my mom come in to a few session so she could get a better understanding of what I was going thing though, my thoughts, my feelings, my personal battles. My mom had no idea! I hid all those things just like I did my pulling! So maybe you could sit down with you mom and tell her how it makes you feel when she says those things. I hope for the best for you"
Trichsters,316cfc,mouldypeaches,2,Thu Apr 2 12:56:49 2015 UTC,"She probably doesn't know that trichotillomania is an actual disorder that causes you distress. Most people haven't even heard of trich or realize it is far more than a quirky habit! Unless you've talked to her very openly about your pulling, how it makes you feel and how it affects your life, she probably has no inkling just how hurtful her words are. A lot of people can't imagine that something as seemingly trivial as pulling out a few hairs can be so devastating to the puller.   It can be REALLY hard to talk plainly about what you're going through but perhaps it will make her understand how inappropriate it is for her to be pointing it out like that. While my mother is aware I have trich, she does not know how miserable it used to make me (I'm nearly recovered so I don't feel like there's much point in discussing it now). I'm sure if I sat down and told her how embarrassing, frustrating, humiliating and distressing my pulling is she would be a lot less flippant about it when it does get brought up in conversation.   To be clear, I'm not victim-blaming here. I personally don't think a mother should be picking on her kid's ""flaws"" like that, whether it is just a funny habit or a full fledged disorder. It's just mean and it serves no purpose other than to make you feel bad. However, from her point of view she probably doesn't think her ""playful teasing"" is causing that much harm. I really do hope you sit her down for a chat. Keep your chin up! I'm so glad to hear that your eyelashes have grown out! :)"
Trichsters,316cfc,mouldypeaches,2,Thu Apr 2 13:33:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you, you're absolutely right. I think I'm just kind of surprised that my mom would be like this- I'm used to looking up to her and seeing her as a smart, understanding person and this is so out of character for her. She doesn't make fun of my sister's Tourette's or something like that (which so many people do) so I'm just kinda like ""what the fuck, mom..."""
Trichsters,316cfc,maggymac,3,Thu Apr 2 13:41:18 2015 UTC,If it's out of character for her then that's a pretty clear sign she probably has no idea how it's effecting you! It sounds like your mum is a pretty sensitive and aware person so I'm sure if you open up communication about your disorder she'll apologize and change her tact.
Trichsters,316cfc,Throwawayaccount097,2,Thu Apr 2 13:52:29 2015 UTC,"My mom use to be very passive aggressive about my trich.. She would always have some snide remark about my missing eyelashes but would never directly talk to me about why they were missing.  I started pulling in my early teens and am still pulling today at 25.. I believe it was about 3 years ago, I was home visiting my parents and my mom said something about how I have to stop pulling my lashes & brows.  I remember turning to my mom, making eye contact, and just saying ""Mom if I could stop pulling, trust me I fucking would!"" She was in absolute shock. I don't think moms(or any family members) understand what it feels like to loose control over something like pulling your hair so they don't know how to help or even how to approach the situation.  I explained it to my mom as an impulsive control disorder and she has really stopped with the mean remarks. I know all parents aren't going to react in a good way but at least try explaining to her what you are struggling with. Hope this helps OP!"
Trichsters,316cfc,herUggy,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:14:01 2015 UTC,Agreed... most of the time they just don't understand and wouldn't be so cruel if they knew how hard we were trying!
Trichsters,316cfc,bittersweetdromedary,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:05:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this will help, and I apologise in advance for the essay!  I've had trich since I was about 12, i'm 21 now. Like you, it's never overly visible as it's fixable with makeup. I pull from my eyelashes, as well as my eyebrows and hair, I shave everywhere else as I know i'd probably pull there too. I honestly think it's just your mums way of dealing with it. My mum used to get upset and shout at me whenever she saw me pulling, it used to make me feel even more useless and pull more. She tried taking me to a psychiatrist about it and telling my family so that they would tell me off if they saw it. She sat down with me and talked about it all the time and she wanted to understand it, and on one occasion I mentioned that her shouting at me as well as my family telling me off made it worse, and it made me feel embarrassed. She felt so bad about how she made me feel, that ever since then she just calmly reminds me of what I'm doing, or nudges me to stop. (She never wanted me to feel that way, but she thought that telling me off for it would help me stop) Talk to your mum, I'm sure she doesn't realise that she is hurting your feelings, its just how she deals with it, she's probably hoping that if she makes it a lighthearted thing you wont feel bad for pulling. Tell her how your feeling, maybe even go up to her and say 'hey, I'm sorry we fell out the other day, it's just I find it hard when people point out that I may be missing a few eyelashes, it makes me feel embarrassed'.  You should be so proud of yourself for growing out your lashes! and carry on! It will get better, but unfortunately trich takes time, as I think we all know! Hope this helps! :)"
Trichsters,316cfc,kittyminky,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"This is what I would tell her.  ""Hey mom, I would like think that as my mother, you want the best for me. You keep making fun of my trichotillomania, and I think you're doing it either because it's a very foreign concept to you or because you think that shaming me will help me stop. In fact, shaming me only makes my disorder worse. The only way I can overcome this disorder is if I can depend on my family to treat me like a normal person and be supportive. Trich is actually very common and I'm not some kind of freak, but your comments show me that you think that I am. I'm asking you to stop, because I don't find your comments helpful or funny. I am already dealing with a lot of shame from my disorder and I don't need this kind of treatment from my own mother.""  My mom used to do this kind of stuff. She'd even smack me when my hand was reaching up to my head, hard. It took me flipping out and yelling at her for her to stop that, and after having a serious conversation about how her approach was unhealthy for me she finally stopped mentioning it altogether.  Just remember: feelings of shame and guilt are a part of trich, so anything that triggers feelings of guilt and sham will only make your trich worse. What you need is compassion and support. Avoid people who make you feel embarrassed about it or have a discussion with them so that they'll stop."
Trichsters,316cfc,Naninana,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"I've been dealing with trich since I was about 12, although I'm mostly recovered now (I'm 25). I never felt like I could talk to my mother about it, if anything I felt like my issues were a burden on her. She was mostly passive-aggressive about it, but there were a few more direct jabs in there (ie, at the optometrist at age 14, the technician commented on my lack of eyelashes. ""Oh, she pulled them out."" In a tone that suggested it was a personal affront to HER, never mind how humiliating it was for ME). I stopped going to therapy when I was in high school because she made it quite clear that she and my dad didn't want to keep paying for it. Honestly the best coping mechanism I found was to just ignore her...nowadays we have a strained relationship at best, but there's no way I would have kept what little sanity I have left if I had tried to engage with her. She wasn't too supportive in other aspects of my life, though. Most recently she told me she didn't understand why I was bothering to upgrade to go back to university, since apparently I'm ""not cut for it anyway"" (thanks, mum). Your relationship with your mother sounds better than mine otherwise, though. I think you should try talking to her about it. Maybe she genuinely (somehow) doesn't realize how hurtful her comments are. Best of luck to you. xx"

Personal my bad spots are my temples and I currently wear a wig because it's become comfort for me even though I've been pull free for a year, I have nothing there and sadly never will"
Trichsters,30pdac,dogmanbirdgirl,2,Sun Mar 29 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"trichy     FTFY    but in all seriousness that really is quite interesting how you can have that level of knowledge about this aspect, and it's really awesome that you are able to help someone else improve their self esteem.

Trichsters,30l6j7,cvillemade,3,Sat Mar 28 10:16:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a man with trich who has successfully grown a pretty full beard. It's fucking hard but doable. I have 2 small beard combs one of which I wear around my neck all the time. If I find myself pulling I grab the comb and brush my beard instead, this way I'm less likely to find an individual hair that needs to go. I wash and condition my beard 2-3 times a week, and I have a special beard moisturiser that I use every day. This helps to make sure the beard hairs are not so wiry, as any that feel ""wrong"" get pulled out. I get my beard trimmed at a barbers every 3 weeks. This keeps the ends from getting to straggly, as any that stick out in the wrong direction will get pulled. I've had two false starts, but my current beard is just over a year old now. Last time I had pulled a pretty visible patch, and shaved the entire thing off. My wife cried and told me to grow it back, not wanting to do that again also helps control the pulling.  I'll update with proper formatting and pics when it's not 4am and I'm out of bed."
Trichsters,30l6j7,StuartLeigh,2,Sun Mar 29 03:18:57 2015 UTC,FYI you're washing your beard way too much. You generally want to just rinse it with warm water in the shower daily and condition it (don't shampoo unless you buy shampoo for beards) once a week.
Trichsters,30l6j7,FuzzyBacon,5,Sun Mar 29 12:57:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pulling at my beard right now. It helps just a bit to think about how shitty it's going to look if I pull the next hair. But once i find a good one, it's coming out. God damnit."

I have to shave my face at least once a week or I start pulling at it too. I was convinced to do the No Shave November thing a year ago and that helped a little bit, just to have two people rooting for me. I learned that friends can help and that my face is not suited for beardyness."

You won't be disqualified and if anything, they won't even notice. As long as your hair is pulled back and tidy, they can give you no shit.   The only positive thing to come out of basic and tech school is that you're so busy with all this crap around you that there's no time to even unknowingly pull.   You'll be okay.

Trichsters,30lpvk,ambiguousness,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:06:46 2015 UTC,Thanks! It's awesome to know that there are others in the military with this issue. Is it hard to do your hair? do you have any visible bald spots you have to cover up? What kind of products do you use?  Sorry about my 20 questions
Trichsters,30lpvk,Afdavis11,2,Sat Mar 28 23:00:11 2015 UTC,"I'm retired military. Air Force.  I'm a guy.   You'll be fine, although I would absolutely keep your situation to yourself.  The military is not the place to try and dump your personal problems, particularly in the first 180 days.  The only significant issue is your security clearance.  Keep the issue to yourself, and you'll be fine.  Share your problem with others and you'll face the chance of losing your clearance or getting discharged.  You'll learn quickly to solve problems privately or not let them start in the first place.    There is a good chance you'll live with a roommate or 6 a few times during your military career.  Keep them all in the dark about your private personal issues.  They are your's and your's alone.  The only exception is if you plan on hurting yourself or others and I highly refute that trich creates issues for anyone else.  You might have to effectively dispose of your hair in a barracks/roommate type situation. Although you'll be ""enforced"" in keeping all of your area clean.   The military does provide stress in your life, so be careful about letting the problem overtake you.  Everything will be okay if you just let it, and the military is a great option to help you grow up and get started in life with some skills and discipline.    Feel free to check in if you ever need help."

I don't have any other problems attached to it that would affect it like self harm, panic attacks, etc. I would like the support of my recruiter, but not with my career at stake..."
Trichsters,30lpvk,micraig56,2,Sat Mar 28 22:52:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure.  You'll have to find someone with better, more current, info such as another recruiter to be certain.  When I went through the process I found that being honest in answering the questions was a pretty good policy, however if they didn't ask a specific question I saw (and still see) no reason to volunteer information that wasn't asked for."

Keep busy with projects and forget about your brows to avoid impulsive set backs. If you're worried about regrowth, castor oil at night helps, and if you have the money, Revitalash or NuSkin brow serums work too. You can do it!"

Trichsters,30c5kt,sadiehoney,2,Thu Mar 26 04:02:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked into the hair component much, but I did read somewhere that smelling sandalwood does reduce the time skin take to heal (or something similar). I have been thinking about getting some to smell, but I think it would be more effort than it is worth.   Keep in mind that this is regarding /r/CompulsiveSkinPicking (dermatillomania)."
Trichsters,30c5kt,codhopper,2,Thu Mar 26 05:45:38 2015 UTC,I use essential oils while meditating (eucalyptus/mint). I always made sure to smell them while i was relaxed. Now when i scratch ill put on the oil as a reminder to breathe. Conditioning this way has helped me control my hands...or at least stop myself when its a major attack.
Trichsters,30c5kt,banderson346,2,Thu Mar 26 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"I can't really give tips on how to quit since I still do it myself, but for regrowth I use tea tree oil after I shower. A few drops on my fingers and rubbed over my scalp, and it seems to be working so far. (: I also have a bead bracelet that I keep on to fidget with when I feel the urge, but that might not work for you depending on how often you do it."
Trichsters,30c5kt,kitsunegari101,2,Thu Mar 26 19:10:25 2015 UTC,"Lavendar is an irritant! Don't use it on your skin. No sure if the others are irritants as well, but essential oils are very potent and often need to be diluted before you use them.  In general essential oils are just a fad, they're not the miracle products that some people claim they are. If you're using them for aromatherapy that's one thing, but don't apply it to your skin and do a lot of research to make sure it's okay.  I use castor oil on my scalp sometimes (partly because it's so sticky that I won't pull my hair if it's on my scalp, it's too unpleasant) and I avoid harsh shampoos with sulfates."
Trichsters,30c5kt,bittersweetdromedary,2,Thu Mar 26 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"ive recently started using Neutrogena body oil (or the target brand body oil) in the bath and after a shower. I'm not sure about helping with growth, but it has been very soothing for my very dry skin. It has actually helped a bit with skin picking which is something else I do. This was an unintended side affect but I'm definitely happy about it. Today I put some in my hair before I washed it. I let it sit in for about half an hour. It definitely felt nice on my scalp and my hair looks great. All positives, I just don't know if it actually helps it grow."
Trichsters,30aoun,ShittyDuckFace,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:04:49 2015 UTC,I thought it was during either a cleaning or a restoration attempt that the layer of paint which included her eyebrows was destroyed.  Though a lot of people don't have eyebrows for reasons not always related to trich; it looks odd on some and completely normal on others. I don't have brows due to trich but even when I do let them grow in they're so blonde you can't see them (and I'm not a blonde).

Trichsters,303jhn,veronicamars82,3,Tue Mar 24 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"posting on a throwaway  I've tried these before. As a brow puller I was so excited to try these. I was, however, very disappointed. The plastic(?) part that adheres to your skin is very noticeable. From the middle part to the tail the plastic isn't obvious, but the other half it can't be concealed by makeup and it looks exactly like what it is: a false eyebrow. I wish the part that adhered to the skin was more flesh toned instead of being clear plastic. It was also hard to ""customize"" them to fit the shape of my face. In hindsight I was being too hopeful that I risked the $60 I paid for them. Because of the price I would say to not risk it and to stick with using eyebrow pencils/gel."
Trichsters,303jhn,areviewingtrichster,2,Thu Mar 26 22:08:44 2015 UTC,"I just got mine and tried them for the first time and you're right, the plastic backing is definitely more noticeable than I would've liked. Not sure if I will wear them in public."

I'm actually not taking it right now because I moved recently and haven't wanted to broach the issue with current doctor, but your post has inspired me to try to get help again.  Growing up, my mom suggested that my pulling was related to attention problems but I've always been a star student without any treatment.  I wonder if I've been using hair pulling to cope with mild adhd.  Really nice to hear I'm not totally nuts for thinking this.  Thanks again for sharing"
Trichsters,303lqi,llucidslide,2,Tue Mar 24 16:42:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for reading, and I hope that you look into it!  I guess I forgot to add that I when I changed schools my grades changed dramatically (my private school was shut down by the state for many reasons) I graduated HS in the top 10%.  I wasn't aware of what was going on, I thought I wasn't trying hard enough if I didn't do well.    Everyone is different and not everyone with ADHD pulls their hair out, but adderall has allowed met to think clearly and less compulsively in many ways.   I did try vyvannse, but I found myself staring rather than focusing. For example,  I almost rear ended someone because I was staring at their license plate rather than focusing on driving."

I'm hoping to get evaluated for ADHD soon. It would be great if I could stop pulling in the process. Glad it worked for you!"

It's like a forcefield. I just got one two months ago and I literally cannot get at the hair underneath.   This video just shows Laura's hair growth after an 8 month period."

Trichsters,2zb67k,prune-tang,2,Tue Mar 17 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a very mild case of trich to me. Some people develop trich after some kind of event that affects their hair or scalp. I've known people who only started pulling after their hair became damaged from being bleached or burned by a straightening iron. I personally started pulling my hair when I was little and I hit my head on the playground and had a scab on my scalp. I kept picking at the scab, and eventually it turned into me picking at my hair, and now I have full blown trich. Just watch your hair pulling and try to stop it before it gets serious! You might not have too much trouble breaking the habit if you try very hard now, but once you've been doing it for years it becomes very difficult."

Trichsters,2z90m7,emalen,3,Mon Mar 16 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"that's definitely true, thank you"
Trichsters,2z6zmh,veronicamars82,8,Mon Mar 16 03:03:10 2015 UTC,"This is really tough. I always live in fear that someone will call me out on having fake eyebrows/lashes. I'm sorry you're going through this.  I try to focus on bettering myself (mentally, emotionally) so that maybe people do notice my fake eyebrows first, but that's quickly replaced with my smile or positive attitude. It's really hard to do, but I genuinely believe people would much rather be around someone who is fun, intelligent, and caring than someone who looks incredibly gorgeous.  Have you considered faking eyebrows? A brow pencil or there's even stick on false eyebrows that might help you feel more attractive and confident. There's some great youtube tutorials on how to draw on eyebrows."
Trichsters,2z6zmh,kitlekap,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:28:00 2015 UTC,Thank you. So sorry for the delayed response. I'm just now exploring faking eyebrows. I'm going to try to watch some of those videos because every time I've tried drawing them on they look horrible!
Trichsters,2z6zmh,kitlekap,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:01:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely watch some, but if it helps I have really dark hair and I just fill it in without drawing any fake hairs and no one can tell the difference.  Also, feel free to pm me if you need any help or suggestions with this! I've been doing it for a year, so I have some tips that might help."
Trichsters,2z6zmh,fingerpies,10,Sat Apr 4 22:32:14 2015 UTC,He's an asshole. Fuck him. I'm so sorry he said that. You are more than your eyebrows. You are more than your trichotillomania.   I'd be obsessing over it too. That's a huge fear of mine. But try.  Try to remember youre so much more and he's not worth your time.
Trichsters,2z6zmh,molove143,1 point,Mon Mar 16 11:27:04 2015 UTC,Thank you! Sorry for the delayed response. I think it's especially hard for us right now since pop culture is SO focused on strong brows. I saw an article on Buzzfeed the other day about what celebrities would look like without eyebrows and how important they are and it just annoyed me so much.
Trichsters,2z6zmh,maggymac,8,Sat Apr 4 04:02:52 2015 UTC,"If you go to sephora or ulta (if they have those in your area.. Or other make up places)  they can help you find the right stuff for you! But, that dude was just trying to be hurtful. I'm so sorry."

Trichsters,2yzxs7,undugie,1 point,Sat Mar 14 06:41:23 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel. I have been suffering for about two years now and I also have a quarter sized bald spot on the top of my head. Most of the people closest to me know about it but I style my hair so it's always covered up. I also don't understand why I want to pull my hair out.. Dating also makes me very anxious, but if you can get the confidence to talk to a girl and go on a date, if she's the right girl for you and you feel that you want to tell her, she won't judge you. If she does, she isn't worth it because the right person will love you no matter what.This comment may seem pointless because I wish I could say there was something I could do to help, but I do understand. I have been seeing a therapist and the only thing that helps me sometimes is constantly having something in my hands to play with. During one of our sessions she noticed that I was playing with my hair elastic the entire time. Hope that helps a little bit."

Trichsters,2yzxs7,pueblokc,1 point,Sat Mar 14 23:15:28 2015 UTC,I go after facial hair and shave so it's not noticeable that I have completely bald spots. Luckily.
Trichsters,2yzxs7,KamikazePrincess,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"I tell people who I trust. Luckily, mine is not super noticeable. I pick at this spot right where my hair meets my forehead. It is about the size of a penny, maybe half a penny.   I try not to feel ashamed of the condition. I am pretty open about therapy and things like that already, so it isn't much of a stretch for me to tell people that, yes, when you see me playing with my hair, it is because I am stressing out.  Something that has been helping me is to keep my hands occupied whenever I am entering a ""trigger zone"". Whether it be emotional or environmental, my trigger zones cause me to pull or pick my split ends without fail. I have been playing with rubber bands and anything that takes some creative thought to play with."
Trichsters,2yzxs7,KamikazePrincess,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:52:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah stress definitely triggers pulling for me as well. I too try not to feel ashamed about it, but the one day that I didn't wear my hat I got quite a few comments about it, which stressed me out even more causing the pulling to continue. College kids can be pretty mean about it... In particular, I remember one guy telling me I should get a ""reverse bowl cut, use a cane and go for the old man look"". I know it was just a joke, but comments like that sting. Oh well, fuck em."
Trichsters,2yzxs7,caseyracer,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:15:10 2015 UTC,"That's a good attitude to have about it.

I am not saying that I am okay with my pulling, I hate it. I am just not as anxious in social situations as I used to be."
Trichsters,2yzoys,mannepiper,3,Sat Mar 14 04:46:31 2015 UTC,Anything that would make me jittery makes me anxious I think which makes it worse. I rarely drink high sugary drinks anymore and don't drink caffeine  than 1 glass in a day.

Trichsters,2yrrwh,thebaneofmyexistence,3,Thu Mar 12 06:56:02 2015 UTC,"I can relate to this for sure. Sometimes my pulling comes when it seems like nothing is going wrong in my life at all to trigger it. I think it could be one of two things (or both or something else entirely, who knows‽): accumulated stress catching up with you, like when you get sick because you've been pushing pushing pushing for a while and are finally taking a chance to breathe (this happens to other people, right?); or, anxiety about something upcoming, even if it's good. It's like, yeah, this hot guy asked me out! ...wait, what if he hates me on the date or what if I put my foot in my mouth in front of him or what if he turns out to be a horrible racist etc. It's like good news just leaves lots of room for the anxiety to grow, right?  Anyway, that's just my take on it. :)"
Trichsters,2yrrwh,sigmasunshine,3,Thu Mar 12 09:08:16 2015 UTC,"Stress is stress. Good stress (wedding, moving, etc.) is still stress.

Trichsters,2xv2yp,rockyrikoko,19,Wed Mar 4 02:40:28 2015 UTC,"This is all stuff that has worked for me! I mainly pull from my head, but I’ve had issues with eyebrows/eyelashes in the past. Your mileage will vary a lot, but these are all ones that have helped reduce my hair pulling or helped someone I know.  Target the scalp/problem area. Impeding or discouraging hair-pulling by making the hair-pulling difficult or unpleasant.   I find that pulling hair is unpleasant if my hair is wet, so I’ll either take a shower or spray my hair with water. This is only possible to do at home, however. Wearing a hat, scarf, wig, or a hairstyle that makes pulling difficult (like a pony tail, or any hairstyle that requires a lot of hair gel/hair spray.) You have to resist the urge to take the hat/scarf/wig off though! If I’m having a particularly bad hair-pulling day, I like to pamper my hair and scalp by slathering it in coconut oil or JBCO and covering my hair with a plastic bag for several hours (sometimes overnight) and then washing it off the next day. It keeps hair healthy and soothes my scalp when it’s irritated, and pulling hair while it’s so greasy is so unpleasant that I’m never even tempted. Back when I pulled at my eyelashes, I would wear waterproof mascara because it feels horribly sticky and gross, so I would leave my eyelashes alone.   Target the fingers and thumb. Many, if not most, of hair-pullers say that they pull hair partly because feeling the texture of the hair on their fingers feels pleasant, so preventing yourself from feeling the texture can help.   Wear gloves. Pretty self-explanatory. I find this gets really annoying so I don’t do it often. Wear medical tape/band-aids around fingers. Using a roll of cheap medical tape can be a lot more budget friendly. I’ve known people to use masking tape as well. I haven’t done this in years and I’m not sure how safe it is, but I used to put a very thin layer of superglue on the pads of my thumb and index finger. It creates a barrier so that I couldn’t feel the hair between my fingers, which kills the desire to pull. However, trying to remove it is a BAD idea, and you should wait a few days for it to naturally fall off on its own. There are better solutions than this. Get acrylic nails or grow your nails out. This obviously doesn’t work for everyone, but I got acrylic nails several times and really loved it because it meant that I could give myself amazing scalp massages and pulling hair was more difficult. It was too expensive for me to keep up, though. There are these “thimble” stickers you can find at some craft stores, which are great because they’re meant to go onto the pads of your fingers and create a barrier. The ones I’ve used looked like this   Target your general health. Trichotillomania, like any disorder, can be exacerbated by outside forces that make you feel anxious, stressed, depressed, etc. Focusing on mental and physical health can help in surprising ways.   CUT DOWN ON CAFFEINE AND SUGAR. I cannot stress this one enough! It finally clicked with me after several years that my hair pulling is way worse after I’ve had a lot of coffee in the morning or eaten candy all day. Once I weaned myself off of daily coffee, I found that my hair pulling was halved.  When hair pulling is getting bad at home and you’re frustrated with yourself, drop down and do 10 pushups or crunches. I found that this helped if I really stuck with it, mostly because I hate pushups. Seeing a behavioral therapist who knows what they’re doing is a great help to some people. I personally never benefited from it much, but others have. A lot of people claim that taking NAC vitamin supplements helps them. I’ve personally suspected it was the placebo effect, but a LOT of people really swear by it, so who knows? Avoiding anything that makes you feel “jittery,” like caffeine and sugar as I’ve mentioned above, or lack of sleep, and always going into a stressful situation (a plane ride, a test, whatever) armed to the teeth with whatever helps keep you distracted from hair pulling. Work on your own feelings of guilt, shame, embarrassment, etc about your trich. These feelings are a symptom of trich, and a misguided person trying to help can accidentally try to “help” by using pressure/shame/guilt, but they will very likely just make your trich worse. You can’t stop by making yourself feel bad about it. Remember that the hair pulling isn’t your fault, you’re not “weird,” you don’t look like a freak, you just happen to have a very common disorder and you probably know a lot of other people who are hiding their trich too. Unpacking those feelings, being more open about it to people you trust. Journaling or joining online forums is very helpful. Look up youtube channels, check out r/trichsters, find one of the many many websites out there about trichotillomania. Taking care of your skin and hair! Showing your hair a lot of love and care even if you don’t feel that it looks its best can be really therapeutic, and your hair just might grow in healthier and faster because of it. Taking measures to reduce split ends, making your hair shiny, giving yourself a scalp massage, deep conditioning treatments, etc have all helped me change my attitude toward my hair. I felt that it was permanently ruined and that attitude just made my hair-pulling worse. I try to redirect my pulling urges into combing my hair or massaging my scalp instead. Do anything that works for you to reduce stress. Drinking tea, meditating, stretching, massaging my face, hot showers, and writing in a journal help me out a lot.    Redirect hair-pulling urges into another activity. One of the best ways to prevent hair pulling is to make your hands busy doing something else.   Spinner rings seems to help a lot of people. I wear several normal rings because I think spinner rings are ugly, and I twist them around and play with them to distract myself in class. Wearing a necklace with a metal chain and then running your fingers along the chain can help. Wearing an inconspicuous bracelet with a texture that is pleasant to your fingers is a good way to distract yourself without drawing too much attention.  Adding a keychain with something that’s fun to play with to your keys gives you a good distraction, and no one will ask obnoxious questions about it. Carrying a stress ball around school or work isn’t something that most people want to do, but a stress ball keychain isn’t so bad. They make all kinds of keychains that are worth looking at. Some stress ball keychains are cleverly disguised to look like tiny footballs, hamburgers, animals, etc. Instead of playing with hair near the root, play with the ends of your hair. This obviously only works if your hair is somewhat long. It’s harder to pull hair out from the end. When you feel the urge to pull, drink a glass of water and by the time you’re done, see if you still want to pull. When you feel the urge to pull, give yourself a scalp massage instead. When you feel the urge to pull, comb your hair and use the comb to massage your scalp as you do it.  Sometimes the scalp feels “itchy” until you pull, and combing or massaging the scalp can help. When you feel the urge to pull, write something down instead and make sure you’re keeping both hands occupied as you do it! I sometimes doodle what I imagine I will look like with a full head of hair, and sometimes I just write why I think I might feel the urge to pull, if I think it’s caused by stress or worry. Some people like to wear a very cheap wig at home and “pull” the fake hair from it. I have tried it, but I feel very silly doing it. I have worn an old hat with a lot of fraying yarn on it and pulled the fuzzy bits out, and that helps. If you have an old coat covered in lint or dog/cat hair, pick it out with your fingers.  Doing any kind of arts and crafts, like making jewelry or drawing, helps calm me and keep my hands busy at the same time."
Trichsters,2xv2yp,bittersweetdromedary,3,Wed Mar 4 04:20:33 2015 UTC,Thanks a ton! So much of this makes sense and I can already see things that I think will really help. Namely putting tape on my fingers and resisting playing with my hair around the root
Trichsters,2xv2yp,emalen,2,Wed Mar 4 06:37:11 2015 UTC,"It is also very important that you talk to your doctor since there is the added component of pica for you. Hair can actually form balls inside you if you eat enough, so it's important to be vigilant about that and keep your doctor informed."
Trichsters,2xvh2t,bittersweetdromedary,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:41:54 2015 UTC,"Apparently the brand ""Mane n Tail"" is awesome for hair growth! I haven't tried it myself but have seen others results from it and it seems to be good! Relatively inexpensive too. And don't worry, it's not actually horse shampoo.   Edit: oh and also!! Apparently lying on a bed with your head over the side and doing a scalp massage for 4 minutes (roughly) is very effective too."
Trichsters,2xvh2t,alllu438,1 point,Wed Mar 4 07:05:14 2015 UTC,I used to use mane n' tail for years! Maybe I should go back to it.   I love scalp massages because it helps calm my pulling urges too. Double effective.
Trichsters,2xvh2t,alllu438,1 point,Wed Mar 4 08:07:38 2015 UTC,"Perfection! You could even try do the scalp massage with castor oil or coconut oil (this one in particular is great for conditioning your hair!).   I'm dealing with a similar problem at the moment so I understand how you feel! I haven't pulled in just over a week which is a recent record haha! I actually found some white hairs where I've damaged the follicle from pulling so much, and that has scared me shitless (don't wanna be going white so early :'( ) so have managed to stop cold turkey..for now! I hope it continues!"
Trichsters,2xvh2t,alllu438,2,Wed Mar 4 08:22:23 2015 UTC,"I found the exact same thing today! I have these really sad, wispy, gray hairs that I'd never noticed before. I've pulled for over a decade and never noticed this happening before."
Trichsters,2xtf7m,emylime,2,Tue Mar 3 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"Good for you! Talking to 1. a counselor and 2. my partner has been invaluable for me. I am so much less likely to pull when I am open about it and, thus, the shame is taken out of it. Also, for me, it is helpful to not even touch my lashes/brows; can't pull if you're not touching. Good luck!!"
Trichsters,2xtf7m,emalen,2,Tue Mar 3 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"Next month my insurance kicks in again (I moved and had to get special privileges and stuff) and am going to start going to one. Also, I have an irl friend with trich, so I've started actually talking to her about it which I think will help a lot.   Today I have been rubbing my fuzzy spots but haven't pulled. I still need to find a way to keep my hands distracted during down times :/"
Trichsters,2xtf7m,emalen,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:52:31 2015 UTC,"Good plans! I like coloring (yup, with a coloring book and crayons). It is something I like that is relaxing but keeps my hands busy. Some people knit/crochet/sew. Some people wear gloves to remind themselves not to touch and make it harder to pull."
Trichsters,2xtf7m,bittersweetdromedary,2,Tue Mar 3 22:54:08 2015 UTC,"My advice is that guilt, shame, and embarrassment can really fuel the urge to pull, so try not to beat yourself up about your trich! And if you do accidentally pull a hair or two, don't let it discourage you.  Also, stay away from caffeine! It makes hair pulling way worse for most. Same thing with sugary foods."
Trichsters,2xtf7m,ttmthrowaway,1 point,Wed Mar 4 05:10:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I ended up pulling two hairs last night and wanted to keep going but I stopped there and it was great that I could. But I stopped wearing my beanie so I could be more accountable, even when I'm in public. Its like giving me fuel to stop instead of hiding. You can always cover your spots but it's much harder to prevent them and let regrowth happen"
Trichsters,2xv3vn,BrookeKassandra,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"Fucking sucks. I'm pulling my beard out, one sweet sting at a time. I have no suggestions. I wish I could switch to pubes or armpits or something less noticeable. How do you pick the right hair, out of curiosity?"
Trichsters,2xv3vn,thousandlegger,2,Wed Mar 4 04:26:41 2015 UTC,I usually go for the hairs with weird textures. I have tried to switch but I always go back to scalp.. It's so hard. How Long have you been pulling? Have you tried to just keep your face shaved?
Trichsters,2xqqcy,valchacha,4,Tue Mar 3 02:30:02 2015 UTC,"It sounds pretty likely that you do. You should also look up dermatillomania-- basically the same but ""skin picking"" rather than ""hair pulling."" A lot of people have both.  My advice is read a lot of blogs/forums/etc and watch a lot of youtube videos from people who have overcome trich. Everyone has their own ways of stopping (or slowing) trich, and trying out the same stuff and seeing what works for you is the best you can do.  Some people feel the need to see a behavioral therapist, but honestly it's never done diddly squat for me. I pull almost exclusively from my head, and the things that have helped me are either obstructing myself from pulling my hair (wearing a hat or gloves, putting band-aids on my fingers, etc) or making it ""unpleasant"" to pull my hair. I hate how it feels when it's wet or greasy, so if I'm at home and I notice my hair pulling is getting bad I'll take a shower, wet my hair with a spray bottle, or put on a hair mask. I've been putting jamaican black castor oil on my scalp for a few hours every once in a while, because then it stops my hair pulling and it's supposedly good for hair growth and health. I do notce that my hair is shinier and thicker, but there are areas on my head where hair hasn't grown for years and it's hard to tell if the JBCO is making a difference because I can't see those spots in a mirror. Another thing that has helped me before is getting acrylic nails, but they're so darn expensive that I had to stop.  You should also try to redrect the compulsion to pull/pick into something else. Some people like spinner rings or playing with yarn. I like to play with the ends of my hair instead of the roots, or spend a while doing something that requires both hands, like painting my nails. When I have nail polish on sometimes I'll pick the nail polish off to keep my hands busy instead of pulling my hair out. There's a lot of advice out there that I haven't tried yet."
Trichsters,2xqqcy,bittersweetdromedary,2,Tue Mar 3 10:07:07 2015 UTC,"thank you! I've been reading up on it and noticed a lot of people go for ""bad"" damaged hair like me. I'll try the nails, I've never gotten them done but I've read that it helps. Thanks again!"

I thought I was damaged beyond repair as well, as I pulled for around 8 years before taking major strides toward stopping.   The urges aren't totally gone, but my lashes are so long that I've been asked if they're fake! Don't give up hope! Each piece of hair you resist pulling is a success in itself.  I believe in you and message me if you ever need encouragement! :)"
Trichsters,2xcyff,Shelbalia,2,Fri Feb 27 22:25:50 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling. I rarely pull anymore and try to catch myself before I do. It's a very hard internal struggle to keep yourself from doing it. I'm very glad you've had success, good for you! :)"
Trichsters,2xcyff,Chimiichenga,3,Sat Feb 28 04:26:02 2015 UTC,"Yes it will grow back, it will take some time but it will grow back. I've been pulling since I was 7, I'm now 30. 6 years ago after having my son I started coaching myself to not pull. Hardest decision of my life. With time it has gotten easier. 6 years into I haven't pulled and my hair grew back on the spot that I always pulled. A bit finer at first, and this year I've noticed it's getting thicker.  So in due time your hair will grow,  just frustratingly slow at first.  Patients and time. Give it a good couple of years. You're doing good."
Trichsters,2xcyff,Naninana,2,Sat Feb 28 12:36:07 2015 UTC,"i pull since i was 13 too and now i'm 20 and my hair is growing back. i was totally bald on a large spot on my head, and i decided to shave it when i was 18. my father did it for me about every week that he shaved it with a razor, not with an electric shave thingy. he put shaving cream all over my head and shaved everything with that razor so no hair was left and my hair grew back a few months after. and the strange thing was that on my pulling spot everything grew back darker and thicker, its so strange but im really happy that its truly growing back but i still havent stopped pulling yet. so if you dont have a problem with shaving your head and wearing wigs or whatever you did, try it. shave your head with a razor and shaving cream."

The ""switching zones when you get a noticeable bald spot"" thing is spot-on for me, as well. I've had gaps in my lashes, gaps in my brows, moved my hairline back about 1/2 inch, pulled until I almost looked like I have a widow's peak (I don't normally), and had a small round bald spot at the crown.

I am not sure what your hair is like, but if you can find a salon and spare the money, get your hair done. Cut it, wash it, dye it (this especially! I know when I dye my hair, I feel less likely to pull it!) and ask the stylist to message your scalp under the water. It is treat yo'self day because it sounds like you need it!  Before you leave ask the stylist if there is any hair product that tastes awful, but good for you hair. Hair spray is one, but I find the 'roughness' at the end of the day to be triggering. You will not want to eat it. Hair gel will work too.  Everything will be okay. Just take it one step at a time. The stylist has been trained to deal with problems like this (a very good one too).

Trichsters,2wydhg,Alypius,6,Tue Feb 24 05:39:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry to see it dude, I've been pulling A LOT more recently.  Fighting the urge is hard, BUT you DID IT for A WHOLE YEAR.  I still pull every day, whether it's one hair or more.  You'll get back on track. Don't worry!"
Trichsters,2wydhg,steelcitykid,5,Tue Feb 24 11:42:59 2015 UTC,"Just shave it off - no harm, no foul. Sorry about your relapse but congrats on the progress leading up to that. Try to figure out (if you don't already know) what triggered you, what caused the fear or anxiety and try to find a conscious way to solve that issue. I always feel trich is a secondary symptom."
Trichsters,2wydhg,comradeyugostan,3,Tue Feb 24 13:00:35 2015 UTC,Ah the higher we climb the farther we fall.  I can't imagine what could of triggered this but at least try comfort yourself knowing if you've gone a year you could go for two the next time.   What helped me personally when I relapsed was to remember that hair will always grow back but if we beat ourselves up ovee this the scars can last a while.
Trichsters,2wydhg,thevengeance,10,Tue Feb 24 08:37:59 2015 UTC,"OK Tough love time. Thats a lot of pulling man.  So, you managed a year, that lot must have taken a fair amount of time to pull, there's no way you didn't at least for a second consciously realise what you were doing, but you chose to continue.  Next time FFS when you start, move, do something else, speak to somebody or go and be with somebody. If nobody around go to a busy place, there's no way you'll keep doing that there.  Own the problem, identify when it's happening and make a change to stop it.  You are clearly in the extremes dude, I feel for you, drastic times, you're going to need to get a handle on this now or it'll fuck your life up.  Peace and Love, but don't be the victim. That's the last time that happens, got it?"
Trichsters,2wydhg,basedbananasx,6,Tue Feb 24 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"I knew what I was doing every second of it. I went to the common area and continued doing it in front of my roommates. I do it in large lecture halls during class in view of lots of people. I go running to relieve stress, I use my hands to draw and craft instead, I have shaved my head 5 times to stop the pulling, but my finger nails start to break and bleed from trying.   I get on skype with my friends and siblings and still pull while I talk. I keep putting my hands down, and the pressure to do it builds up like holding my breath underwater. 2.5 hours every week in group and individual counseling. I have talked through it many times. I see a psychiatrist as well. I have a keep a schedule of meals, exercise, study time, and relaxation time to keep my stress as low and manageable as possible.   I have had this problem for 9 years, managing it as best as I can, and it is not fucking my life up. I'll be graduating with a double major in 3 more semesters. I have received several academic and music scholarships and awards. I met my fiancee at a time where, from trich and skin-picking, I looked the worst I had in years. I was just accepted to a competitive research position that I was under-qualified for compared to other applicants. The interview got me the position. The interviewer had never met me before, and my uneven hair did not color her impression of me.  I overcame years of self-mutilation. Compared to that, trich is an improvement. For anyone who might see this, the yardstick is how you improve your perspective and attitude, not how many hairs you pull."
Trichsters,2wydhg,Ipadboy,2,Wed Feb 25 06:44:18 2015 UTC,I'm so proud of you for going that long without pulling. Heck yeah its okay. We all relapse at some point.
Trichsters,2wydhg,averyatthedisco,2,Tue Feb 24 15:01:00 2015 UTC,Definitely shave it all off. Leaving it like it is can put you in a very destructive mode. Shaving it will make it like it never happened

Trichsters,2w7pfx,StrangeQuark1,4,Tue Feb 17 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"Hey. False lashes will not cling to your eyelids, they need hair to cling to (I've learned this the hard way.) I personally find eyebrows more important than eyelashes so I would maybe focus on getting an eyebrow pencil that matches and go from there. Do you wear glasses? Because you could just leave those on. If not, I wouldn't worry about the eyelashes for an interview unless you feel it's terrible noticeable. Any makeup (eyeliner) or false eyelashes may draw more attention to your eyes."
Trichsters,2w7pfx,ElissaLove,4,Tue Feb 17 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"um...i've pulled my top lid of lashes out since i was 14, false lashes DO stick to your skin. if they didn't, i'd be screwed."
Trichsters,2w7pfx,rugmuncher,1 point,Sun Feb 22 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's what I was worried about. Unfortunately (fortunately?) I don't have glasses. I honestly can't tell how noticeable it is to other people. And you're right, any kind of eyeliner would just draw attention.  I don't normally make a lot of eye contact with people due to shame/self-hatred etc...  But in this kind of situation, it would be unavoidable and we would be in close quarters, so I'm not sure how bad it would be.  I'm sure rexall would have an eyebrow pencil that I could buy, I'll just have to convince a girl friend to come with. I am a VERY shy person and I hate this so much..."
Trichsters,2w7pfx,emalen,5,Tue Feb 17 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, even if they do notice, they will 99% of the time just assume it's a medical thing and not ask. I would focus on a winning smile and solid answers. Those will outshine eyelashes 10 times out of 10."
Trichsters,2w7pfx,ElissaLove,3,Tue Feb 17 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"you're right. It's so outlandish that a person wouldn't have eyelashes, that people wouldn't even think to look or question. Even if they noticed, they probably wouldn't care that much, just think I have short or unnoticeable eyelashes."
Trichsters,2w7pfx,emalen,3,Tue Feb 17 18:28:17 2015 UTC,Maybe you could find non-prescription frames and that'll make you more comfortable?  I fill my brows in daily (I have almost none) and my eyelashes are non existent and glasses help me feel more calm about not wearing eye makeup (it sometimes makes my eyes itchy and itchy = pulling.) Be confident in your interview! They most likely won't even notice the eyelashes!
Trichsters,2w7pfx,emalen,1 point,Tue Feb 17 18:13:16 2015 UTC,That's a great idea! I can wear the glasses when my eyelashes aren't so great. I'd probably save them for special circumstances though since I'm one of the few people I know who doesn't wear glasses (they comment on it).
Trichsters,2w7pfx,emalen,3,Tue Feb 17 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"No lashes are not that noticeable. I've had hardly any lashes for 12+ years, and if it ever comes up people say, 'oh, huh, you're right, I didn't notice'."

I like it because it makes me feel calm and comfortable. Its a good worry stone.   I actually havent worked with hematite much.  But i read up on it, and it sounds pretty perfect for the situation. Here's what I found =)  Hematite it is particularly effective at grounding and protecting. it dissolves negativity and prevents negative energies from entering the aura. psychologically hamatite is strong. It boosts self-esteem and survivability, enhances willpower and reliability, and imparts confidence. This stone removes self- limitations and aids expension. It is a useful stone for overcoming compulsions and addictions.hematite brings attention to the unfulfilled desires that are driving life. It treats a overearing, smoking, and any form of over indulgence. Hematite helps you to come to terms with mistakes and to accept them as learning experiences rather than disasters. mentally hematite stimulates concentration and focus, it enhances memory and original. it brings the mind's attention to basic needs and helps sort out problems of all kinds""."

I became obsessed with plucking them out, which persists to this day.  I can spend an inordinate amount of time plucking, or attempting to, and it drives me crazy when I can't get a hair out.

When I started wearing a clip on hair piece my pulling got way worse when I would take it off.

It's been so long that I honestly can't even remember any more. I haven't had eyelashes or eyebrows since that age, which made life as a teenager very fun until I learned I could cover it up with make-up.  Anyway, I absolutely notice a direct correlation between happiness and minimal pulling, vs. anxiety and facial hair desolation. That's not to say there aren't times that I'm seemingly content and still pull, but being anxious is like throwing gasoline on the fire.  Best of luck with dealing with the stress in your life; I know it's tough. Remember to not beat yourself up too badly when you find hair on the floor. Being angry with yourself is a vicious cycle of anxiety; if anything, just remember the feeling of your own disappointment the next time you notice your hands fidgeting. Stop yourself, and try to find something else to keep your hands busy. It's what I do, and sometimes it works (though I wish I could find an adequate long-term substitution that's non-destructive, as I'm sure all of us trichs do.)

The first time I vacuumed with this new powerful device I cried. It was mostly my hair. Just globs and strands of my foot long hair. I did the same thing cutting and pulling it all out of the vacuum in absolute shame. Now even though I haven't had any hair to pull in weeks I'm still finding hair in my vacuum.

Pain and pleasure are essentially the same, just have different though processes attached to them. Both assist with survival in different ways.   I still have trouble with dermatillomania and creating sore patches to pick. I might gently feel an area a few times over an hour. That will progress to prodding,  poking and tugging on hairs in the area.   I have a lot of trouble when I am successful in pulling out an ingrown hair. It is like a massive victory and I want to just dig at my other problem spots as if I will solve them all by pulling a mythical ingrown. I have been working on the problem. Using a bright torch to verify if I can see an ingrown underneath the skin,  only digging if I am confident that there is one (hard part), covering the area with sudocrem if I decide not to follow through and dig. I have also been using ingrown removal liquid for about a month and have had massive reductions in the amount I pull and pick.   I pull my beard and sometimes my eyebrows (if I have an infected follicle or pimple on them) and find the hardest part is regrowth too. I feel tempted to just pull out all the new little hairs because they feel useless and my skin is irritated.  Anyway, if you are in private I would cover my eyebrows with sudocrem or maybe Vaseline. Not sure about public.   Good luck making progress."
Trichsters,2vmyor,codhopper,2,Thu Feb 12 12:27:58 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the urge to pull is overwhelming, and I have a few go to spots. Sometimes I can distract my hands.  Lately I've taken up crochet to keep my hands and mind busy so I can't pull.  But other techniques I've used is putting band aids on my thumbs so I can't feel and pull hairs.  I have played with play-doh or koosh balls.  I've painted my nails. Anything to keep my hands busy. I haven't been entirely successful- some days are better than others."
Trichsters,2vmyor,vanillasky22,2,Thu Feb 12 19:01:45 2015 UTC,"I only pulled my lashes, so I can't speak for the other areas. But when those get super itchy like that and you feel like you just HAVE to pull? Well don't even touch! Don't second guess yourself! Just run to the freezer, grab anything, and press it to your closed eyelid(s). Even works with a can of soda or something from the fridge. The cold is instantly soothing. After that, I would go to the sink and splash my face with cold water, dabbing it on the lashline too. Felt so good, and afterwards the urge to pull was gone. Don't give up!"
Trichsters,2vlrxp,juhesihcaaa,3,Thu Feb 12 01:45:03 2015 UTC,Are you me?!    Seriously...  I've been pulling for as long as I can remember.   I remember my mom smacking my hand off of my head before I started school.  I constantly had bald spots somewhere.   Tried wearing hats all the time but then I just pulled at the sides.   Went to buzzing my hair super short and been that way since.  I still pull on occasion but it's so much harder. I end up with little notches in my finger nails from trying to catch my hair perfectly between them to pull it.   Now my 6 month old daughter is starting to grab at her hair...  I know she's too young to be able to tell but damn if it isn't upsetting to watch.   I just hope if she does end up having it that I will be able to support her better than my parents did with me and that she will be better off for it.
Trichsters,2vlrxp,kavalrykiid,1 point,Thu Feb 12 11:25:04 2015 UTC,Holy crap. Same exact story here. My mom would yell at me over and over for playing with my hair.  My daughters are almost 4 and only one of them is playing with her hair (the one with autism) so maybe her sister will be able to help keep things in check.
Trichsters,2vjtmw,Wisky_Tango_Foxtrot,2,Wed Feb 11 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"awh it sounds like you are being overly hard on yourself- it's not a fuck up, it's just a relapse and these things happen! Glad to hear you are doing so much to make things better, sounds like you are doing awesome!!"
Trichsters,2vjtmw,Sadie79,4,Wed Feb 11 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"Trich is a really tough thing to deal with.  When I was younger I used to pick parts of my scalp bald, and I pull from other places as well.  I did my own research at the time and found out that a few anti-depressants can help with the urge to pull.  I took Prozac for 6 months and it made me feel HORRIBLE, but during those six months I was able to get some type of control over the trich so I stopped making bald spots.  I've been dealing with Trich for more than half my life and nobody in my family understands.  Nobody has bothered to look it up or be there for me, they just dismiss it as annoying and distracting to them.  Keep your chin high and you'll be able to reach your goals.  Try not to let trich dictate your moods."

Trichsters,2vesna,Elsie980,3,Tue Feb 10 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"Hi Nina, welcome to Trichsters.  I'm sure if you read other posts here, you will find that there are lots of discussions around what has helped us along our paths.  Depending on your situation, getting professional help is always great.  This is something that can take time, as you need to find someone who not only is knowledgeable about OCD and CBT, but also someone you feel comfortable with.  So you'll probably interview a few before  you find one that works.   I would also suggest that you start changing your internal monologue about this.  You are right that this is an illness.  You are wrong to think you can just 'stop' it.  I mean, you'd never tell a person with cancer to just stop having cancer, would you?  Of course not.  You'd expect them to get treatment, medication, help.  You'd expect it to take time, to take self care, to take effort to heal.  Give yourself the same effort and credit, and you'll be on your way to healing.  Above all things, forgive yourself.  Once you can do this, you can do anything.  You are not alone in this.  Post here any time."
Trichsters,2vesna,clothesgirl,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:50:40 2015 UTC,I also tend to get really upset and cry when I see the results after not being able to take my hand away from my hair for a while. Usually happens at night though.

Trichsters,2v1m36,swingline926,2,Sat Feb 7 00:42:20 2015 UTC,"Pulling less, even if you still pull every day, is about as good as it gets with this disorder. Whether that's worth it for you is a personal decision. I would say yes, but explore other options with your doctor. Do your research and ask lots of questions. I take luvox too...but it's been years, I can't remember what it was like to not take it. I also found out (again personal experience is all we can go by here) that I have hypothyroidism, and when my thyroid is underactive, the pulling gets much worse. Just an example of weird underlying conditions that can change how much you pull, which is why you should try to look at the problem from all angles. And I apologize if this last bit of advice is unwanted or what-have-you, but I've been dying to share this with someone who might benefit from it...but you know how psychologists insist the only way to solve this is with a replacement habit? I finally found a decent one: smoking an e-cig! I was never a smoker before, but man does it help when I want to pull. It occupies a hand and the small dose of nicotine is self-satisfying in a similar way the pulling is. Just a thought, but talk to your doctor, ask about alternative drugs and your reasons for dissatisfaction with the luvox. Best of luck. =)"
Trichsters,2v1m36,snuggle-butt,1 point,Sat Feb 7 20:57:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info!! I really appreciate it!  My psychiatrist actually told me the same thing about smoking. I am a smoker and he said if I quit, my pulling may worsen because the nicotine addiction is combating the pulling. Without the nicotine and the fixation of doing something with my hands, it could get worse. So basically, which is the lesser of two evils?  The pulling won't kill me, smoking can. But an e-cigarette is an alternative option.   He is worried that trying to quit two addictive behaviors at the same time will be mentally and emotionally difficult."
Trichsters,2v1m36,snuggle-butt,2,Wed Feb 18 05:47:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely try an e-cig, but it won't be identical to smoking. I mean I far prefer peach flavor over cigarettes personally, but I hear the tobacco liquid flavors are crap, just a heads up. Different nicotine levels mean you could gradually try to quit, though."

My pulling drastically decreased, but i still pulled a few hairs most days, sometimes i went without, that was rare though. But, considering i pull CONSTANTLY, i consider it a success. I never had any side effects, and it helped curb my urges. The only reason I stopped is because I'm dealing with my anxiety issues holistically, but my trich is in full force right now, so my doctor said I should go back on it, even just for my trich.  that's the only medicine i have tried that has ever put a dent in helping to curb my urges to pull"

Trichsters,2uxskb,violaceous_trogon,6,Fri Feb 6 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same problem, actually.  I pulled out about the first inch of my hairline about ten years ago, and it still doesn't look/feel the same. It's kinky and frizzy and I cannot have a hairstyle without bangs it's so misplaced.  I had a hairdresser try and sell me on biotin once, but as far as I understand it, it doesn't really do much."
Trichsters,2uxskb,caryatiddreams,4,Fri Feb 6 01:59:56 2015 UTC,"Hairdresser here, I'm not sure if it's scientifically proven, but here's my take on the situation.  I think that pulling it out slightly damaged the hair follicle. Causing it to grow all kinked and frizzy."
Trichsters,2uxskb,KellynHeller,3,Fri Feb 6 17:16:13 2015 UTC,"I believe it can. Life long puller here, about to turn 31! I've noticed that on my crown that after about almost a full year of recovery that the hair is not only a different texture, the color is noticeably different. I'm starting to go silver-fox and the damaged regrowth is definitely closer to my original brown color."
Trichsters,2uxskb,steelcitykid,2,Fri Feb 6 14:04:22 2015 UTC,"I had really bad trich in elementary school-middle school for about 5-6 years (to the point that I had almost no hair and people thought I was a chemo patient on the regular). When it finally stopped almost completely all of it grew back in as ringlet curls rather than my usual mess of thick waves. It stayed as ringlet curls for another another ~6 years until it slowly, steadily went back to being waves. Now however many years later at 22 my hair is mostly just waves but in spots that I still pull a little it definitely grows back curly. My recent gray hairs are also more common in these spots but that's probably just coincidence. So in my experience it isn't permanent but the damage to the follicles could have more lasting effects in some people than others I suppose."
Trichsters,2uxskb,projectemily,1 point,Fri Feb 6 15:12:18 2015 UTC,I've had nearly the same experience
Trichsters,2uxskb,PredictableChick,2,Fri Feb 6 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"The way I've heard it, it damages your hair follicle and you need to stop pulling and let it heal. I have been pulling since infancy and have a lot of kinky hair like you describe (while the rest of my hair is of medium thickness and very straight.) The upside is, my hairs will only grow this way for 4-5 inches and then will straighten out. I assume the time it took to grow the 4-5 inches of hair has allowed the follicle time to heal.  The downside is, I tend to specifically seek out/pull the strangle-textured hairs, creating a cycle. I still pull, so sometimes I try to replace the pulling behavior by clipping out the textured ends of my hairs with scissors, but for someone who is trich-free the behavior might be triggering."
Trichsters,2uxskb,ilove_Gingers,1 point,Fri Feb 6 22:57:19 2015 UTC,"I don't usually comment on posts for trich  so I decided to message as a reply to your question. In my personal experience I feel like it also depends on your hair type. Mine is quite thick but I have noticed in the spots that I pull the most and most frequent the hair grows back either frizzy like literally spring like or extremely thin and brittle. That's only a few hairs tho, more of my hair grows back as normal but I don't know how long that will last for.   That's why I cut my hair so short, it's pixie length and where I pull the most is pretty short as to not give me the ability to grip it well enough to pull. I still struggle daily though, but it has gotten better over the past year of wearing short hair. Hope I helped. If you're ever looking for tips for yourself or your loved one who struggles with this I'd be glad to chat via pm anytime."

I also have spots that grew back in baby fine (I have thick, course, dark hair) and not to be discouraging but I have spots that I did so much damage to that they will never grow back."

I part my hair to the side and fold it over where I pull from and pin it there to add some difficulty when I want to pull.  There are lots of ways to cover up, hats are good, headscarves, headbands to hold down the flyaways.  where do you pull?  It's so hard to stop, I have literally not gone a single day without pulling for 15 years.  I have managed to reduce my pulling though, that's key.

Trichsters,2uo8f1,silvernarnia,1 point,Tue Feb 3 23:16:04 2015 UTC,"I've never changed my haircut really, so I have no advice there.   As for techniques to interrupt the pulling, I wear stuff on my head a lot - hats, scarves, etc. The physical barrier is big help. Bubble wrap actually got me through a pretty bad period of urges, but obviously that's not always a viable option. Hmm, what else...I do fiddle with random stuff. Things like pompoms that I can pick at but don't make a huge mess are helpful.  This isn't a behavior, but it still might be useful for you. In high school, taking Inositol along with 5-htp got me pull-free for a year or so, but unfortunately the effects wore off for me. That doesn't mean they would for you though! You can get both of those substances OTC. Do your research though if you plan to try this; if you're taking any other medications, make sure there won't be any adverse reactions."
Trichsters,2ulxk9,silvernarnia,1 point,Tue Feb 3 05:53:27 2015 UTC,"You're not going to find any judgement here, so welcome, and please feel free to talk to anyone you want. =)   Someone the other day put it really well. Answer a few questions for yourself: Is it a compulsion, you have to do it, or is it just a habit? Does it cause you mental/physical/emotional discomfort if you try to resist the temptation to pull? Does it negatively effect your life or your health in any way? If you answer yes to any of these, you probably do have trich, and my suggestion is to see if you can find a doctor/therapist near you who knows about it and can help you explore your options.  I can tell you things that have worked for me in the past. You won't necessarily have the same reactions to the same things. A combination of Inositol and 5-htp had me pull-free for nearly a year in high school, but those effects did end up wearing off. Antidepressants had no effect whatsoever. Wearing something on my head as a physical deterrent has been incredibly effective; I've learned to love hats and scarves and such. Frequently applying moisturizer to my hands is also helpful, because I don't want to get that greasy feeling in my hair or on my face.  Really, you're just going to have to start doing research, try to find a professional if you can, and start trying things to see what works for you. Trich doesn't make a ton of sense, so you kind of have to wing it, with or without professional help.  I do have a question for you - do you eat the entire hair, or just the root?"
Trichsters,2ulxk9,silvernarnia,3,Tue Feb 3 20:57:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the responses, best way to describe it is an unconscious habit, do it when I'm talking to people, watching tv, reading books etc and yes I eat the whole hair, I nibble it into tiny pieces with my front teeth, no idea why but I do, occasionally I twist the strand around until its all twisted up then nibble on that again no idea why, I also bite my fingernails (although never till they bleed) and bite and eat the skin at the tips of my fingers which I guess is related to the whole hair thing too."

Trichsters,2ul0sj,CrassNurse,7,Tue Feb 3 01:09:51 2015 UTC,"There's a book called The Hair Pulling ""Habit"" and You written for children with trich. It's basically a guide that can teach her to recognize when and why she's pulling, what steps she can take to prevent pulling, and how she can cope when she's struggling. There's also a parent guide that could help you understand how best to support your daughter. I was a bit older than the target audience when I got the book, but it was still very helpful for me.  I would keep trying to see a therapist; can you see another pediatrician for a referral? If her school has a therapist (or even just a nurse) they may also be able to point you towards some free or low-cost therapy."
Trichsters,2ul0sj,felicitations,3,Tue Feb 3 04:09:55 2015 UTC,"I think you talking to her would at least be a good step in that she'll know that you're on her side and want to help her. The problem is that you telling/asking her to stop may not do much if she's compulsively pulling.  I think your best bet would be to find a psychologist/psychiatrist for her to chat with and find out their perspective on the issue. The earlier she can begin to deal with her trich before puberty and such, the better prepared she can be for when she feels the compulsion to pull and the sooner the pulling may stop.  But most of all, it's just about making her feel comfortable with herself and knowing that it's not necessarily her mind that's telling her to pull, it's her brain, and she may not have much control over it. You sound like a supportive parent, and that's really about as much as you can do for her outside of letting her decide what kind of help she may want to receive."
Trichsters,2ul0sj,_janada,2,Tue Feb 3 02:59:53 2015 UTC,Thank you. I've asked for a psych referral from her pediatrician and they said it was not necessary.  I'm unemployed at the moment and she has medi-cal (government assistance health care) and I can't afford to pay out of pocket. I ask her why/when she does it and she just starts crying saying that she doesn't know. She says she doesn't even realize when she does it. I'm just scared that maybe there is an underlying issue that I'm not aware of.
Trichsters,2ul0sj,usenrame_typo,4,Tue Feb 3 03:08:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I know you're just trying to help, but the types of questions you say you were asking were the very same questions I dreaded most as a kid growing up with trich. I HATED it. I was already very self conscious of the habit itself, the bald spots on my eyes and head, and having my parents ask me questions was petrifying-- it made me just feel like I was doing something really wrong even though I had no control over it. They got me counseling sessions, they got me the haircuts I wanted to hide the bald spots, but I hated when they just asked questions about it. It was basically the most personal thing about me-- It was the last secret I ever told my girlfriends about myself. The counseling was a waste of time for me. It may be of value to others. Supposedly cognitive behavior therapy shows improvements in some people. The only thing that had worked for me is N-Acetyl-cysteine. I started taking it 2 or 3 weeks ago and my urge to pull is gone. Nothing else, no amount of willpower or extrinsic motivation/pressure did the slightest bit of good. It sucks, but that's the reality of it for me. I'm really hoping the NAC helps long-term, and I hope it works for everyone else. It really would be life changing for a lot of people."
Trichsters,2ul0sj,axelroarings,1 point,Wed Feb 4 05:08:04 2015 UTC,Dosage/form plz? Tried NAC years ago to no effect. Notice any other cognitive/behavioral changes?
Trichsters,2ul0sj,usenrame_typo,2,Sun Feb 8 17:59:25 2015 UTC,"1x 1000mg tablet each morning. This is my first time trying it. Could be the placebo effect but I really doubt it. I honestly haven't pulled since I started. Within the last couple days I got a scratch on my eyelid right where my eyelashes are and it gave me the feeling that I used to get after I had already pulled a few--a feeling that used to encourage me to pull more (I.e like something was wrong with that spot and that I needed to pull my eyelashes to alleviate that feeling (when in reality it was the pulling that caused that feeling to begin with)). In spite of this scratch and the sensation that it caused I have still managed not to pull at all. I would say that this has been the closest I have come to having an urge to pull but still I have managed not to and my eyelashes are really filling in. My level of stress at work has also been extremely high lately, I've been very tired, and yet I still haven't pulled. Something is definitely working for me, and I think it has to be the NAC because sheer willpower never did it for me before.   No other behavioral changes to speak of really. I used to be a bit compulsive about popping zits also and I feel like that has  somewhat tempered lately, but my skin has also been clear so the occasion hasn't really arisen either. I was initially concerned that the NAC ""flattened me out"" mood-wise but that doesn't seem to be the case."
Trichsters,2ul0sj,axelroarings,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome to hear. I tried a much lower dosage before and didn't give it much of a chance, assuming it was a placebo out of hand. Hopefully that was cynical and dumb. Thanks."
Trichsters,2ul0sj,_voodoo_child,3,Sun Feb 8 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I started pulling my lashes out at around the same age. At first, my parents were very confused and I think feeling helpless made them angry. This made me want to pull even more, and keep it a secret. I was very ashamed. Not only did I have to deal with kids at school asking me where my eyelashes were, but my parents made me feel bad about it too. They got me into therapy and I started taking an anti depressant. I believe it was Celexa in liquid form that I would drink with my juice each morning. My pulling did stop a few years later. One of the most important things was that my parents understood after seeking counseling that they were not going to to make me feel bad or ashamed for what I was doing. They accepted me and that helped me stop doing it on my own. However, I started to pull again at various other time in my life but that first experience really shaped the way that I now tackle the issue. Best of luck"
Trichsters,2ul0sj,esharkin,1 point,Tue Feb 3 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"I started pulling around this same age as well, I'm 25 now and still have occasional relapses but have been able to keep it pretty under control. I wish my parents had noticed and tried to help me, other kids parents would see me doing it and I remember being shamed for it several times (which only made it worse.) I also thought I was a freak and the only one who did this until I was in my twenties and saw a show about a woman who pulled her own hair out. Let her know you care about her and that this behavior is normal but not ok to continue. She needs to learn healthier ways to self soothe and deal with stress. She will probably always pull to some extent, I just accept this as a fact of my life but it can be better. Treat her to a manicure, keeping nails short and painted makes it more difficult to pull, also it's relaxing. Good luck to you and your daughter."
Trichsters,2uktff,princessrachie,4,Tue Feb 3 00:12:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it to me, particularly the aspect where the offending hairs are the weird different ones and not being able to feel relief until they are gone."

Trichsters,2uktff,JellyBeanKruger,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:52:11 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand. Mine was at its worst during my mid-teenage years/early twenties. Couldn't go a day without tweezing SOMETHING.  Nowadays, I can handle not over-tweezing, but I have a tendency to pick at my head more than I'd like to. I have to part my hair in a way I don't want to and I have hairdressers ask embarrassing questions which makes me sad. But hey, self control takes lots of work and I feel like I'm doing alright! I wish you the best, it's a daily struggle for everyone here and you have our support! :)"
Trichsters,2uktff,bendelaganza,3,Tue Feb 10 05:43:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would say this sounds like my experience with trich. I started pulling the thicker, more textured hairs out first. It's common for people with trich to gravitate towards ""bad"" hairs they feel need to be removed. I definitely get tense if I misplace my tweezers when I get the urge to tweeze my brows."
Trichsters,2uktff,bendelaganza,2,Tue Feb 3 02:58:24 2015 UTC,"Yes that's how I feel, that they are ""bad"" hairs. I have to inspect them once they are out too.  I guess my question is what should I do? Try to manage this or carry on regardless?"
Trichsters,2uktff,bendelaganza,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:51:02 2015 UTC,"Attempting to manage it is worth a try. It could progress. However, I'm not one to talk to about that because I haven't been doing so great with managing it myself.

Ok I know in my rational mind it won't do me any harm but I couldn't contemplate leaving it.  Would rather walk around naked than let those bastard hairs keep growing! Agh!  I guess maybe I need to leave it to try one or two days without pulling it and see if I can get more and more days? Is that how it works? The thought petrifies me!"

If it's causing you discomfort in your every day life, you have every right to talk to someone about changing this habit.   The first step is identifying your compulsion, the second is deciding whether you want to seek help for it or not. You're halfway there and there's no wrong decision."
Trichsters,2ukubv,_janada,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:02:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, I don't feel like I'm hurting myself, per se, but it certainly is something that I became hyper-aware of when reading that sidebar (I was brought here by a link... I don't know, somewhere. AskReddit maybe) and I realized that my cheeks are pretty knotted from scars and I often spend a lot of time trying to pull off loose skin that I bit off, even pulling my cheeks to get a better angle.   I think it's stress... I doubt putting a stop to it would really help with anything. But at the same time it's not exactly a good realization."
Trichsters,2ukubv,_janada,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"I mean, I think it's good in the sense that you at least know what you do has a name. I know that was big for me when I discovered I had trich.  But if it's not something you find inhibits you from leading your every day life, then maybe getting help isn't the option for you, or isn't the right option for right now. It may get to a point where you realize that you're spending a lot of time doing something destructive to your body and you'd like to change that. That doesn't have to be today or tomorrow, but at least when that day comes you know there'll be a community of people, online or not, that can identify with you on that level."
Trichsters,2uekkk,crunchy_wumpkins,10,Sun Feb 1 13:16:54 2015 UTC,I do the same thing and often have gaps and sparse lashes. I find that tight lining with eyeliner can help hide gaps but I usually resort to false eyelashes when things get bad. PM me if you want to chat. Good luck. :)
Trichsters,2uekkk,_nancywake,5,Sun Feb 1 14:43:25 2015 UTC,"I too pull my eyelashes. Unfortunately, I do so to the point of not having any. I agree that using a little liner helps to hide the gaps and make it less noticeable that I don't have eyelashes (I can't be bothered to wear fake ones).  I have found that mascara often makes me pull more, as the weight of the stuff makes me notice my eyelashes more, which leads to more pulling. Sorry I couldn't be of more help, but know you aren't alone."
Trichsters,2uekkk,1cataway,4,Sun Feb 1 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's also harder to wear strip eyelashes when you have none of your own, as they don't have the natural lashes to kinda sit against."
Trichsters,2uekkk,_nancywake,6,Mon Feb 2 00:19:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a guy, and I started out pulling my eye lashes when I was about 10 (now 26). I actually tried mascara, to make what was left them seem more full. Needless to say, it only drew more attention, so be grateful you're a girl. On the flip side, only about 2 people who I have never been around have ever asked me about it. Not sure if people are just too uncomfortable to ask or they just don't really notice because I am male. What is your experience with people noticing?   I have pretty much always had allergies and worn contacts. I got lasik a few months back and had to stop wearing contacts. I instantly notice my pulling dropped and for the first time in over a decade I actually had eye lashes. Between wearing my contacts for prolonged periods of time and my allergies made me notice my eye lashes and target them. I still pull occasionally, though no where near as much as I have.  My advice, maybe try to get any allergies taken care of to reduce eye swelling to begin with. This will kind of keep them out of mind, since you're not always rubbing your eyes. Also, I found using a pair of tweezers to get that one eyelash that was out of place much more effective than just trying to get it with my finger nails, which would only damage more, and make me pull more out.  Hope this helps."
Trichsters,2uekkk,cablebent1988,2,Sun Feb 1 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear you're doing better with it. I think you're right about trying to get them off of my mind. Ironically I think it's wearing mascara that makes me think about them some days, so maybe finding a good mascara is the exact wrong answer. Sometimes my pulling starts with me thinking that I just want to strip the mascara off so I start pulling at the chunks and then continue pulling hard and getting hairs with the makeup. I don't think that my eyes are bothered by allergens, but maybe the makeup... I wear makeup maybe two or three days a week."
Trichsters,2uekkk,thewronggiants,2,Sun Feb 1 19:53:26 2015 UTC,"I just reread what I wrote, I hope i didn't come off as dismissive when you read it!"
Trichsters,2uekkk,edle67b,2,Sun Feb 1 19:59:18 2015 UTC,"I've been pulling out my eyelashes for about 11 years or so and the amount of eyelashes I have fluctuates pretty heavily. I never use mascara because it makes the gaps more noticeable, but I always wear eyeliner. Every day I wear black liquid liner which can help fill in the gaps and makes it harder to notice any uneven-ness in the lash line. Since it's liquid it also never gets into my eye which I always worried about with more powdery liners. If you aren't going outside, don't put on eye make up or fake lashes though because the mix of pulling and foreign substances can give you an infection on your eyelid.  As far as stopping the pulling altogether I don't have a solution. I've been in therapy which helps a bit and I'm starting to take the NAC supplement which has been known to help some people stop having the urge. Good luck! I know how frustrating pulling out your eyelashes can be, especially as a woman where those features are more noticeable."
Trichsters,2uekkk,_nancywake,3,Mon Feb 2 00:58:57 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. I have found that using a waterproof liquid eye liner to line my eyes (in a bit of a cat eye fashion)makes any lack of lashes less noticeable. /r/MakeupAddiction is a fabulous resource for this, and posting there may be helpful in terms of getting tips on how to cover up and hide this with products - if you feel comfortable!  Wearing mascara along with the liquid eyeliner can be helpful, and I've found that certain brands make me more liable to pull than others. For me, I found that CoverGirl Falsies was extremely unsatisfying to pull from, because it remains oily and smears on your fingers when you reach up to your lashes (rather than, say, Clump Crusher, which hardens and makes firm pieces of mascara that are easy to grip on to).   I have not used fake lashes, and I don't want to (I think for me, it might make me more liable to pull, knowing that i have a backup option). But that's just me.   Ditto to the comment as well from /u/cablebent1988 about allergies and contacts. I found that I'm more likely to pull when my eyes are dry (when I'm tired, around something irritating like dander, or when my contacts have been in all day). Taking out my contacts and putting on a pair of glasses serves as a physical deterrent for me, and often relieves the urge, too."
Trichsters,2uekkk,FuzzyBacon,3,Sun Feb 1 22:18:52 2015 UTC,"I thought of something else - like others in this thread, I pull off my mascara which can end in a big pulling session. When I have the presence of mind to do it, I'll remove my makeup and rub a little coconut oil into my lashes. It makes them soft, I figure it can only be good for my skin, and it's slippery so hard to grip lashes."
Trichsters,2uekkk,palmtop_tiger,3,Mon Feb 2 05:57:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know how I stopped, I think it was mostly switching to pulling out body hair (which is far from ideal, but at least it's less visible. Sounds like you're a girl, though, so that's probably of limited utility). On the plus side, they all grew right back after 3+ years of pulling them out."
Trichsters,2uekkk,whovianinthetardis,3,Mon Feb 2 00:17:38 2015 UTC,"Get yourself a really, really good waterproof liner. Though it is more expensive, it's worth it. I personally recommend Urban Decay's 24/7 liner in either liquid or pencil. When you dont have eyelashes to help hold the makeup on, it comes right off if it's cheap. I got a set of fake nails that basically prevented me from picking, but when I was bald on my lashes, this helped a lot."
Trichsters,2uekkk,atomicSOLDIER,2,Sun Feb 1 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"When I have no eyelashes, I do a cat eye eyeliner look with with blackest black liner. It's harder to tell that I haven't used mascara and that I have no eyelashes."

It's good and sad to know I am not the only one
Trichsters,2uekkk,atomicSOLDIER,2,Sun Feb 1 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"I have various types of eyelash pulling, and here's what works for me. Keep in mind that I typically use an eyeliner crayon, unless otherwise stated.     Chunk missing from center of top eyelid: Use eyeliner on the top eyelid, all the way across. (For all techniques, mirror the makeup for each eye.) Go across the top of the inner eye quick, too, and on the outer third of the lower lid. Use mascara only on the outermost third of your upper eyelashes. Don't put mascara on the super-long lashes just before the gap starts- you're trying to minimize the big drop-off of lash length. Also apply to the outer third of your lower lashes. Then, draw with your eyeliner out from the outermost quick of the eye in the shape of your upper outer eyelashes. (You're trying to mimic the swoop of what your eyelashes are already doing- think a small accent, not a thick line.) The overall affect we're going for is similar to a cat-eye, emphasizing the lashes you do have to draw attention away from the little ones. This works best with eyeshadow and other makeup you'd normally wear; it's a bit dramatic for a plainer face. Missing inner third of upper lid: Same as the first tip, but use mascara up to halfway point of upper lid and 1/3-1/2 of lower lid, depending on what looks best for you. Missing inner third/middle third of lower lid: Same as the first tip, but use mascara across the entire upper lid and for outer third of lower lid. Missing outer third of lower lid: Draw a line of desired weight on top, and line the bottom lid from the outside to halfway in. If you have a steady hand, you can use a hair dipped in (a moderately un-smudgy) mascara to draw false eyelashes on your lid. You basically want to draw little fake eyelashes where your real ones would normally be. Not a full forest, mind- draw about 1 per millimeter. I can post a picture if you'd like. Otherwise, apply mascara only on your top lid, or not at all. Emphasize what you have, not what you don't. Missing outer third of upper lid (this also goes for complete bald on either lid): Ditch the mascara entirely. Today is strictly a liner-and-eyeshadow day. Give a little lash flare as described in the first tip to give the illusion of the missing lashes, but don't try the hair-and-mascara trick- it won't work. Rock a cool pair of shades and tackle the day (if you so choose- see the last two bullet points). Low-key coverup/generally patchy: Add a medium-weight line across the upper lid using an eyeliner pencil (not crayon, since they are a little dull for this kind of work), as close to your eyelash roots as you can. Fill in a little extra below for where eyelashes are missing. Don't go cat-eye, just like what you'd wear with eyeshadow. Only, don't put any shadow on. You're trying to pass for plain-face makeup, with just the liner. (And maybe zit coverup if you want, but don't put on blush or anything.) This is intended to be a run-out-the-door, ""didn't try today"" look that deceives the viewer into thinking there isn't anything on. Good for a quick makeup day! I personally don't use a cat-eye look in my [limited] repertoire (it doesn't suit my face) but give it a go, perhaps? The intent is to ""make up"" for lashes anyway, so it might work for you. Tsukema tsukeru- let's put on falsies! I can't say I've ever used them, but I've started considering them. I don't know if the glue would be a trigger in and of itself, due to the stickiness (mascara is often one for me) but this could be a way to keep you from pulling. Wouldn't want to remove the whole set, after all! Maybe ask around if anyone here has used them... For any situation where coverups are impossible or inconvenient, use your makeup/outfit strategically to draw attention away from the problem. This isn't the time to use dramatic eyeshadow! Focus on a popping lipstick color, a cute barrette, dazzling earrings, or funky shoes. Make the first thing that draws your viewer's eye something other than your eyelashes, and you're halfway to victory. ...But don't feel like you have to hide it! You can be yourself and be accepted. People might notice, and some (well-meaning and/or rude) people may point it out, but that doesn't have to stop you from expressing yourself the way you want to. Wear makeup, don't, hide it, flaunt it, the choice is up to you. You are an important human being, no matter what your eyelashes look like. Unless you're a mascara model, practically no one cares anyway- and even models wear falsies! To sound like a beauty ad, ""love the skin you're in"". Or lashes, in this case. :)   I will admit, I wear makeup very sporadically in my everyday life, but these have worked for me when I needed them. PM me if you have any questions?"

Trichsters,2uekkk,bishie,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:24:23 2015 UTC,Right now I only have like an inner 1/3-1/4 of my lashes so I tend to forgo the mascara and just use some liquid eyeliner and then tight line with a black eyeliner.  I find wearing mascara sometimes makes it easier for me to grasp and pull so I try to use that only on special occasions.  Also I find when I'm wearing makeup I tend to want to keep my hands away from my eyes so I don't ruin the makeup so it deters me from pulling sometimes.

You could order it online if you don't want to face anyone at the makeup counter. They sell it at sephora or ulta. You'll also need an inexpensive angled brush to apply the product. There are tons of YouTube tutorials using it if you are unsure how to fill in your brows.

God forbid I get too lazy to trim the entirety of my giant head one week and my hair actually gets just long enough for my fingers to grab at it - any growth I'd achieved in the thinner areas immediately gets put at risk until I can muster the willpower to bust out the clippers.  I wish I had my old hair back; I'm also tired of hearing people tell me ""it doesn't look that bad.""  All we can do is persevere and try every trick in the book until we've killed the habit in the presence of growth. Breaking your hands won't accomplish that!"

Trichsters,2tupoo,whatpoem,3,Wed Jan 28 01:07:27 2015 UTC,"Stay strong!  have you looked into NAC?  It's an amino acid that was found to have stopped the urge to pull in a small study.

I was the photographer at the Trich conference in LA last year (i have trich and also happened to be their photographer)-- there was a professor from Stanford there who had great things to say about NAC. You can take it in supplement form, and you can also eat foods that are rich in  NAC-- Here's a link:  http://www.livestrong.com/article/531520-food-sources-of-n-acetyl-cysteine/  Wishing you the best xo"
Trichsters,2tupoo,gillyboatbruff,2,Thu Jan 29 18:18:24 2015 UTC,Have you ever tried getting acrylic nails?  It makes it much harder to pull hair.

Trichsters,2tupoo,codhopper,2,Tue Jan 27 20:56:12 2015 UTC,"I always thought this too! Then, last January I had surgery on my dominant-hand's index finger to remove a suspicious lump, and in the recovery phase I couldn't pull because of the pain and bandage and stuff. I kept the bandage on for 5 days more than I needed to purely because I had relief from pulling, I felt calm! Then it came off. And it restarted. Guh. However, all things considered, although it was great to not pull, I couldn't do anything. Typing was insanely difficult, couldn't make food, or eat it easily for that matter, couldn't write or draw, couldn't unlock doors easily by myself, etc. The lesson to learn: don't break your hands! The relief just isn't worth it, sadly."
Trichsters,2tupoo,gilbertlaroo,2,Tue Jan 27 22:19:43 2015 UTC,Not just broken. Sometimes I wish I could just take them off entirely. I know I would just find a sneaky way to keep pulling with the stubs...   I hope you find a way to improve the situation without sticking your hands under a bus.

Trichsters,2tusgo,whatpoem,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:15:07 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you're having such a difficult time.  I'm 23 and also started pulling at age 11! When i went to the trich conference last year, most of the people i met had the onset of age 11.    Try looking into an NAC supplement (talk to your doctor first) - its an amino acid that was found to have some positive effects in a small study.  you can also eat foods rich in NAC (link below)--  I ate NAC rich foods and took a supplement for about a month, and i actually had good results...the urge subsided a bit.  In the long run i found it was more convenient to shave my head. keeping my head shaved has kept me pull free for 2 years now.

Trichsters,2tg8sa,lyleeleigh,2,Sat Jan 24 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you thank you!! <3  The first few days were really rough, but once you can get the momentum of not pulling going it gets easier and easier. I tried to be very aware of whenever my fingers were ""searching"" and when it happened, I would stick my fingers straight out (like a high five) and actually come down and pat my leg a few times. Eventually I could stop my hand on the way to my head, and now finally I've stopped searching almost entirely.   Once your hair begins to grow back you just feel so much more motivated to keep the good work up. Really. You don't want to go back to being semi-bald. And trust me, that spot I'm showing up there? The top/back of my head was just gone. It was so thin and I started wearing my hair in a really deep side part as a kind of comb-over to cover it.   I think they say it takes 21 days to break a bad habit. If you can make it 3 weeks without pulling, the odds of succeeding get away higher. I even did this during finals week - stopped pulling 11/4, finals started 12/10 - and managed to control it.   This has gotten really long, so bear with me! My final advice is to drink lots of water (I know, I know) and to make sure you're taking any prescribed medications properly!! I have two hormone replacements and when I don't take them properly/on time/etc my urge to pull goes through the ROOF. I've heard the same said for anti-anxiety meds, antidepressants, etc. Really keep on top of your body and you'll be so much closer to succeeding :)   I really do believe that everyone can do it. We get stuck in it as a comfort mechanism and even when we want to stop, we still kind of want to continue. Don't let that get you down!! :)"
Trichsters,2tg8sa,lyleeleigh,1 point,Sat Jan 24 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your reply! I've been trying so hard but after a few days of no pulling, something inevitably makes me want to pull. I've picked up all kinds of toys to fidget with and I'm taking NAC. These do help a LOT, but sometimes I just find my fingers wandering and it's so hard to stop them even though I'm taking myself to stop.   I'm not giving up though. Never. I pulled when I was a kid for a short period of time and managed to stop then. I've been doing it for about 5-6 years this time and I feel like I've tried everything. While I know I've made progress, it's sometimes hard to not be hard on myself when I feel I have failed by pulling even one hair."

Then I just explained, ""I have kind of an OCD thing where I compulsively pull my hair out when I'm nervous or in deep thought, and it's kind of ruined my hair.

I had been having my mom cut my hair for years, and I was starting a new job and wanted to feel stylish.  The hairdresser was very compassionate as I explained my situation.  When I arrived for my appointment, she took me into a private area, so other people arriving for their appointments and other hairdressers wouldn't see me.  I loved that she was so discreet.  I just explained what trichotillomania is and how I've struggled with it for over 18 years.  It was very liberating! To talk about my struggle, and to feel great with a new haircut!"
Trichsters,2t8zc8,vanillasky22,3,Thu Jan 22 13:56:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a hairdresser with trich.  Before I became a stylist I used to go to the same girl forever and in the beginning I just told her straight up about trich. She was understanding and cut my hair to hide the spots  I've had 2 clients with trich since. One woman and she told me in the beginning and I cut her hair to mask the spots.  The other was a little boy whose mother was horrible. She was yelling at him saying ""WHY CAN'T YOU JUST STOP. ITS SO WEIRD!"" I felt so bad for the boy. Even though he was a kid I wrote down the name of something to help him and told him to get someone else to buy it for him. I actually used some of my own toppik powder on him and his eyes lit up. I almost cried after he left. I felt so bad."
Trichsters,2t8zc8,KellynHeller,2,Thu Jan 22 14:49:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly just tell them straight up. I explain to them where the spots are and how long it's been going on for. I just started getting my hair cut at a new salon and the hairdresser was super understanding about it. He even told me that he's had other customers with trich. But you could always call ahead/email them and let them know before hand. If anything, the hair stylist/barber should be very understanding about it because it's their job to deal with hair."
Trichsters,2t8zc8,redydg,2,Thu Jan 22 14:50:33 2015 UTC,My barber was the only other person I have ever told about it besides my parents. Lol he is this old Greek guy and had no clue really what I was saying but he related to the word trichotillomania because it had some greek root words in it?idk. I always tip him good and I think he works extra to help shape out my pull areas. I say be honest and hopefully a barber will understand and maybe work with you to help you. Tell them about your condition. I am sure most would be happy to learn a bit about a new hair 'issue'. Dont be embarrised of telling the barber what you are going though. Who cares what they think. good luck homie!

I slowly relaxed as we chatted, and by the end of my appointment I'd nearly forgotten about my balding spot. When she turned me around to face the mirror, I almost cried; without saying a single thing, she had actually cut what we now call little ""back bangs"" that I could brush over the spot to cover it. It looked fantastic, and actually gave my hair some cute ""oomph"" without looking like a crappy combover. I've been going to her ever since - not only does she cover it without a word, she's also a curly girl with hypothyroidism, so she REALLY understands my hair. I got lucky, but I would just say to find someone that makes you feel comfortable right off the bat and go from there."

Umm, for the most part. I did have to pluck a few out because they were growing upwards, but when they grew back again they grew back correctly. So now everything is fine. I do find that the eyelashes are a little more flimsy and straight after pulling them out for so many years, but they still look normal."

Trichsters,2svsnf,silvernarnia,4,Mon Jan 19 01:04:20 2015 UTC,"how did you do it/overcome trich?   I just kind of stopped one day. I know it's a mindless task, but there's still a little part of you that knows what you're doing. The hardest part was when it was growing back and I put my fingers to the stubby eyelashes. I could feel a stinging sensation all the way down to the roots that usually I would alleviate by pulling them out with tweezers. I suppose I made sure to put my tweezers in another room, so that if I really wanted to use them, I'd have to go and get them, adding another step so it wasn't as mindless. Like I said before, it's a mindless task, but you still at the back of your head know what you're doing. I still kind of pull on my eyelashes, to dislodge loose ones and get dirt out and stuff, but I don't pluck them anymore by getting tweezers or using my fingernails.   how old are you?   I am 23 years old   did a different tick develop?   Not really. Actually, I've found that since I stopped pulling my eyelashes, I've also stopped biting my nails. As to whether the two are related , I don't really know. I've always cracked my neck and knuckles, still do.   was there an event that made you change this habit?   Yes! I went to see if I could get LASIK done. The optometrist noticed my eyelashes and made mild jokes about it. They told me that if I wanted LASIK done I wouldn't be able to touch my eyes for a couple of months afterward. Later, I was having a conversation with my mom about it and she said that if I could stop pulling my eyelashes, she would help me pay for LASIK. That arrangement really helped me and I am very thankful. I think I would still be pulling if my mom hadn't made that offer.   Are you happier now?   I don't know if I would describe myself as happier, my happiness level is pretty constant. I would say less stressed out. I feel more confident blinking, I can play marco polo without being embarrassed, when someone tells me to close my eyes I don't have to cover my face with my hands (although I still do, force of habit). It's just one less thing to worry about, and although I am happy that I finally was able to overcome it, on a day to day basis I don't think much about it anymore."

Trichsters,2sra5d,kittenpockets,1 point,Sat Jan 17 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"If you're in college and your school offers a mental health centre, starting there is always a good bet.  Finding other ways to occupy your hands is a good start. And just remembering that it's not ""you"" that's pulling (in that you may not want to be pulling, but you do anyways). One part of your brain ""holds"" conscious thought, while another part of your brain is responsible for habits and pleasure. Unfortunately for people with trich, the habit centre is nestled in with the pleasure centre, which can cause extreme habits like trich to become more and more ingrained into our daily lives as pulling becomes positively reinforced in the brain. Knowing this doesn't really help in the short term, but being able to make strides to ""rewire"" your brain by changing the habit may be helpful. That involves noticing the urge to pull and either not pulling, or finding an alternative.  If you're not comfortable with talking to your friends about something like this, that's understandable, but just know that this kind of stuff is more common than people let on. I've become more open about my trich lately and during one conversation about it my roommate looked shocked, and told me that she had started picking at her eyebrows when she was stressed and was convinced it was the most abnormal thing in the world. Chances are you know someone who does it, or who knows someone else who does it. And if they make fun of you for it, then what kind of friends are they? Not being ashamed about it around other people can really lift a weight off of your shoulders."

Personally, I just bite the bullet and tell them before they start!

Trichsters,2slw3r,nettiebean,2,Fri Jan 16 18:51:11 2015 UTC,I'm a hair stylist with trich. And I've had a client with trich. She just told me right off the bat. Obviously I knew and was super cool about it.  But when I was a kid I went to a girl and just told her what it was straight up. She had no idea what it was so I explained and she was great with my hair.
Trichsters,2slw3r,bringfightintrousers,2,Fri Jan 16 13:02:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like it would be awesome to go to a stylist with trich, I bet you know all the ""trichs"" haha"
Trichsters,2ski71,ferocity562,5,Thu Jan 15 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"I can't help with regards to treatment, but I can give you a good tip:  Don't let them feel ashamed of it.  It's okay if you slip, just stop it now you're aware of it.  Don't set ""Pick free week/day"" goals, go for ""less picks than last week/yesterday"".  Setting the former and picking once means ""Oh well, I failed, might as well keep going.""   Getting on their case about the picking merely gets them more stressed about it."
Trichsters,2ski71,RedDwarfian,1 point,Fri Jan 16 02:30:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback!  I will definitely keep that in mind.
Trichsters,2ski71,ROGUE_KID,3,Fri Jan 16 02:52:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly these are some hard questions to answer because, for me at least, everything I try is hear-say shots in the dark. I haven't tried medication/supplements yet, so I can't give much feedback on how they work but I can tell you when my urges to pull become hard to manage. For me a lack of sleep is a time to be careful. If I'm tired I feel uncomfortable, so I pull to soothe that bad feeling. Something else that I finally faced was a relationship that I deep down knew wasn't working out and I was fighting that inner voice to move on. The harder I tried to ignore that gut feeling, the more stressed out/upset I became and I pulled whenever I would think about what I truly needed to do. Leaving the relationship was extremely hard, but I'm glad I finally listened to myself because it feels like a weight has been lifted and my urges to pull have virtually gone away since. Not sure if that's an answer you're looking for, but I was surprised how my urges were coming from my inner self being out of balance."
Trichsters,2ski71,llucidslide,3,Fri Jan 16 01:32:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing!  That is a very helpful perspective.  I like that idea of thinking of it as being ""out of balance"" rather than putting more labels like ""stress"" and ""anxiety"" on it.  Whatever you want to call it, it is your inner self seeking balance."
Trichsters,2ski71,gingerminussoul,3,Fri Jan 16 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen a number of different treatment providers for trich over the years, and I feel like they often weren't thinking about how their suggestions would play out when you're in a school/workplace environment where others are watching. Snapping yourself with a rubber band when you pull might be great in theory, but I wouldn't be comfortable explaining it to observers.  I think this is going to be especially hard for kids because their classmates would probably notice most things.  I've had success with taping the tips of my pulling fingers with the clear nexcare medical tape; subtle enough for my shared office but not sure if it'd work for the kids.    I've been pulling since I was 10 and I remember the first time my mom asked the doctor about it.  I was awful.  I made every excuse I could think of to not have a ""disease.""  It was really eye opening to me when I got to high school, looked it up online and realized I wasn't alone and it was ok to have this ""label.""  I wish a doctor had helped me see that, though I suppose the awareness probably wasn't there 15 years ago!"
Trichsters,2ski71,gingerminussoul,2,Fri Jan 16 01:35:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing!  And you are right.

Trichsters,2sh630,hereagainnow,6,Thu Jan 15 03:10:34 2015 UTC,"I've actually been contemplating starting a group where I live. There aren't any close by. I see the support group as being more of a place to talk to (and support) others who actually understand what it's like to be a hair puller. A lot of us feel alone, isolated and ashamed. Maybe it would be a place to discuss techniques or what works for some but I mostly imagine that it would be nice to talk with people who have experienced Trich themselves. It could also be a place where people feel like they can share openly and not feel ashamed in any way. That's what I would hope for anyway."
Trichsters,2sh630,SchmiahMiah,5,Thu Jan 15 04:28:25 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way- you have absolutely nothing to lose by checking it out. Go with an open mind, knowing full well that there might not be anything there for you, and if you make a connection and find a new support system, then you've come out ahead. If not, no harm no foul. At the very least, you've taken a step to improve your situation, and that always counts for something."
Trichsters,2sh630,clothesgirl,2,Thu Jan 15 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"I use OSPA( obsessive skin pickers anonymous) as my support group. They're not exclusive to skin pickers, hair pullers welcome! The structure is just like AA. There's usually a topic each meeting you can talk about, or just talk about what you want to talk about. But what I love most is having people to reach out to when I have an urge, or having people reach out to me. It's so vital! Just a simple text is all...

Trichsters,2sh630,todaywasagood_day,1 point,Thu Jan 15 07:50:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've been to a support group for trich. It was very small and all women. We did a few exercises and talked a bit about it. I didn't find the exercises helpful -- I've been in therapy for over a decade and tried CBT for a few years. The best thing was being around people who understood the struggle. Unfortunately, the group only met once a month and attendance was spotty at best.  I participate in general group therapy once a week. Been in the same group for over 5 years! Even though no one else has trich in the group, it is a safe place to talk about it. Unlike the trich group, I know and trust these people and it helps to open up to them.  Like others have said, you have nothing to lose by going. Good luck!"
Trichsters,2s41ee,aquaticunicorn,12,Mon Jan 12 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"26 male here. I pull hairs from my beard which end up creating more ingrown hairs. The ingrowns get infected,  making me pull out more hairs. A very vicious cycle.   It is literally pleasurable for me to remove the hairs (and squeeze pimples/infections - -  Dermatillomania see /r/CompulsiveSkinPicking). I have been working on improving the health of my face to remove the 'want' to pull. I don't think I will ever get rid of the nice feeling of actually pulling.   I have found that it isn't really the hairs which I want to pull. I slowly grab at hairs (which irritates the skin underneath) and then they become enticing to pull out. The same sort of thing happens when I have an infection or pimples. The skin underneath the hairs becomes the target of my attention. I can pull a hair out and it feels really good. The area of irritation increases and then I pull more. All because of some tiny red bump.   Moisturiser doesn't help my face (I think it makes it worse due to reinforcing the skin rather than letting the dead skin fall off).   Anyway,  try to find out why you pick. I have cut out picking from frustration,  procrastination,  boredom and I am trying to get rid of my stress and 'repair' picking.  I have approx.  3 bald patches on my beard which are regrowing right now. It has been about 3 weeks since my last big pulling session."
Trichsters,2s41ee,codhopper,5,Mon Jan 12 02:08:53 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've definitely got trich.  To answer your last question - there's nothing inherently wrong with it, I suppose. It bothers a lot of people (me included) because we don't like the way we look when we've pulled (I pull eyelashes and eyebrows, so it's pretty obvious). But if you're OK just shaving off your beard and you're not getting bald spots on your head, then it seems you don't have that problem. It's probably also not great for your hair follicles - others have mentioned ingrown hair and irritated skin. Sounds like your only problem is the time it takes.  It's not 'normal' behavior in that not everyone feels the need to pull or satisfied when they pull the way people with trich do."
Trichsters,2s41ee,WonTwoThree,4,Mon Jan 12 07:53:10 2015 UTC,"I've done the same thing to my pubic area. Literally hours wasted doing it. I started taking antidepressants for anxiety and pull A LOT less. Also, I'd consider trying to shave completely or even getting waxed."
Trichsters,2s41ee,cheestaysfly,3,Mon Jan 12 03:35:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's necessarily normal but what is normal? It's normal amongst this sub yes. It's very common. I recently came out about it to my friends and family (because I have a bald spot that is sometimes visible now no matter how I try to conceal it.) but I had like 4 or 5 people tell me they all pull hairs too. There's most likely nothing ""wrong"" with you, this is a disorder that has been linked with OCD and anxiety and those are both diseases that can be controlled pretty simply with regular doctors appointments and medications. Trich sometimes is not so easy to control. The impulses can be too much at times. Most of the time I don't realize I've been doing it so much until I see my spot in the mirror. Just try to be aware of it, honestly that's the best way for me I can control it. Try to alwYs know what your hands are doing. Start a hobby or play video games more during times you're relaxed. I took to painting my nails and Mario kart to fill the empty times when I can't stop pulling. Hope this answers some of your questions."
Trichsters,2s41ee,OsoBarbilloso,3,Mon Jan 12 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, grooming to some extent is normal. If it starts impacting your life negatively, it's kind of a problem.   But yeah, I pull out my hair much the same as you do. I am extra gratified by the ones with big follicles, and I'll eat those after playing with them. I shave my head to make it less obvious, but for years and years I had long hair and would avoid activities that I would have loved to do, like go swimming with friends/do active things in the wind/ have my hair braided at sleepovers, etc. I would avoid going to get my hair cut. It caused me a lot of anxiety and personal distress.  The worst part was that my mom thought I was doing it for attention/ ""to get back at her"" for whatever, and took my pulling personally. I couldn't talk to her about it, and I didn't get professional help until college, which was much too late to salvage anything. She'd yell at me when there was a lot of hair clogging the vacuum cleaner, etc. I cried a lot. Those were lonely years.  Besides for occasionally making strangers uncomfortable, being a bald girl is nowhere near as bad as being a girl with long hair who had an extreme case of trich was for me."
Trichsters,2s41ee,Mokitty,3,Mon Jan 12 02:14:40 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one. My brothers both do that with their beards. I also have on many occasions spent hours in the bathroom with tweezers plucking the ""danger zone"". And seeing the follicle or the sheath of cells around the base of the hair is very satisfying. Usually I also get the urge to bite them or peel the clear sheath/follicle thingy off the hairs after I've plucked them.  So yeah it sounds like you have trich, but it's not inherently bad. Plucking the hairs repeatedly over a long period of time may end up damaging the follicles and making the hair grow funky, and of course when plucking you have to deal with some ingrown hairs, but it's not like that's going to seriously damage your body. Ultimately it's up to you whether or not this habit is one that you want/need to quit. For me, personally, I'm trying to quit for my self esteem and appearance. But yeah it's up to you."

Trichsters,2s00vf,Eunoic,3,Sat Jan 10 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way in the past.  Growing up I had no idea that compulsive hair-pulling was a mental disorder - my parents yelled at me and made me feel like a freak.  I thought I was the only one in the world who had this ""weird, disgusting and shameful habit"".  I only found out this was called Trichotillomania a couple of years ago when I was reading about Pica on Wikipedia (I used to chew on the hairs I pulled out).  After discovering this sub I felt slightly less alone, knowing I was not the only one.  This sub also led me to taking NAC which has helped a lot.  The guys I've dated have never been understanding or sensitive about my disorder.  I think they simply cannot relate to something they haven't personally experienced.  My current partner said to me the other day ""I've never seen you with lashes"" -- this was hurtful to me and blatantly untrue.  My pulling was largely under control for the first few months when we started dating, but I had a terrible episode where I destroyed half my right brow and most of my lashes a couple of months ago.  When I showed him the photos from last year when I did have all my lashes, he said ""those are fake"".  When I tried to argue, he said ""I've seen your fake lashes in the bathroom.""  I've only worn false lashes on three occasions last year at parties and weddings.  The rest of the time it was all my own lashes with mascara!  I think he was just trolling me but it was actually quite hurtful.  But I guess what I'm trying to say is that I've never had a supportive boyfriend who understood my suffering so don't let him tell you you're weak-minded or lack will-power.  The urge to pull and our corresponding will-power waxes and wanes over time.  Some days are easier than others.  Sometimes I can go for months without pulling and then one bad day at work and I've lost half an eyebrow again.  You're not a failure as long as you keep trying to overcome your disorder!"
Trichsters,2s00vf,FeeSimple,1 point,Mon Jan 12 06:51:18 2015 UTC,thank you so much for this :) I feel the same way. will power is definitely a fluid thing. As long as im staying strong enough to keep trying and not give up hope I should be doing great
Trichsters,2s00vf,leelakitteh,2,Mon Jan 12 08:09:33 2015 UTC,"Much like drug addiction, there is a psychological side to this. You don't have the ""willpower"" of someone with a normal brain. Lots of people have disorders; I like to think of trich as a fairly mild one. Try to explain to your boyfriend that it's a medical condition that millions of people have. If he keeps blaming you, dump his ass. He's just not very smart, then."
Trichsters,2s00vf,CbcM03,1 point,Sun Jan 11 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the way he explains it helps me, sometimes it just makes me feel bad and blame myself and get confused. Now is one of those times. :c"

Trichsters,2rzsed,leelakitteh,2,Sat Jan 10 20:36:29 2015 UTC,"Hi there - just read your post. I have only ever been on antidepressants for my trich - I found other habits that eased my urges and I thought I would share, hope I give you some inspiration!   Knitting - I know. I know. But try it! I bought a small set of cheap wool and wooden knitting needles so they make this lovely clicking noise. I make tiny teddies out of boredom and blankets when I feel adventurous. Keep your hands busy with something productive - make something that could mean something to you. I made a few cute hats to cover my hair.   Gaming - picking your hair is addictive, and I find getting lost in either a console or PC game just as bad! But using both hands to play and altering my attentions to the game helped me :)   Gym - exercise is great as a mood booster! The hormones that are released into your body after exercise make it impossible to be feeling like crap, some studies show you can run yourself out of depression.  I know these aren't pills or an immediate solution, but there doesn't seem to be one for our compulsions. I can only hope I give you an alternative outlook. Take care"
Trichsters,2rzsed,nettiebean,2,Mon Jan 12 22:34:02 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that you comment on Naltrexone. I was on it for the same reason and the increase in hair pulling made me get off of it so quickly, so that was a good and bad thing.  The only thing that has worked for me so far is taking extended release xanax. I hope you have a doctor that you are able to talk to about this. Extended release isn't as hard to get as instant. Since you seem to have tried everything else, maybe the doctor will be understanding.   I hardly pull at all anymore. When I am under a lot of stress, I do still get balding spots, but this is so much better than it has ever been.  Good luck!"
Trichsters,2rkf7a,terrevasts,3,Tue Jan 6 23:17:50 2015 UTC,You look great! I'm jelly at you for taking the leap. I've been dreaming about that for a long time.

Breathe,  relax and calm down a little."

Trichsters,2r9sll,CanadianBFRB,2,Sun Jan 4 04:29:42 2015 UTC,So i definitely want to educate myself more on this....but does anyone find reading this stuff triggers?
Trichsters,2r9sll,PigsJillyJiggs,1 point,Sun Jan 4 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"Yes. I find that reading anything about disorders (especially any that I actually have) brings out the triggers because I'm just sitting there, staring at these words that are making me freak out, and my idle hands travel to my eyebrows. It's a cruel twist from the universe."
Trichsters,2qybfk,gingerminussoul,3,Wed Dec 31 21:10:09 2014 UTC,"Hi, I actually have dermatillomania, but still very close to trich. I have used NAC for the past 8 months, and I think it helps. It's no cure by any means, the best way to describe how it helps me is that it makes me feel like I have more of a CHOICE when I have an urge to pick. Whereas before I felt powerless over my urge, I can now choose not to pick. I have no side effects, but I heard someone say it gave them headaches and someone else say it burns their stomach. I would start with one supplement in the morning w/ a full belly then add one to dinner after a few weeks so your body gets used to it. I don't think it changed my mood or anything like that... If you're an absentminded puller I highly suggest you start making a log of when you pull, just to get your awareness caught up with your behavior- it's extremely helpful. Therapy( CBT or ACT) + NAC + support group( OSPA recovery) has drastically changed my skin picking. I can now go out with no make-up- unheard of before I started my recovery. Hope this helps!"
Trichsters,2qybfk,melanmeal,3,Thu Jan 1 01:48:58 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the same story I have. Skin picker and hair puller. I have been taking NAC (I started religiously taking it about 3 times a day (600mg per)) for about 3-4 months. Lately I have been taking 1200mg in the morning and 600 in the afternoon (most days). Sometimes I skip it or take 2 lots of 600mg during the day.   I didn't see a drastic decline in picking or pulling, but I did feel more empowered to not pull. As if a note on my desk saying ""not right now"" had no effect beforehand, but afterwards I could look at it and say to myself ""not right now"" and just not pick.   It may be a placebo, but damn it feels like it is helping."
Trichsters,2qybfk,codhopper,2,Thu Jan 1 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"I found out about NAC on this sub as well and I'm so glad I did!  I've been taking one to two 600 mg capsules a day for a month and I'm happy to report that I have not intentionally pulled out a single eyelash or eyebrow hair since then.  I have lost a lash or two from rubbing my eyes when itchy and I still ""play with"" the hairs sometimes - stroke them, feel them against my fingertips etc. but I have not pulled one out yet since taking NAC.    I usually get the urge to pull when I'm stressed out at work (the hand subconsciously creeps towards the face while I am focused on reading things on my computer), so I keep a bottle on my desk at work and take it first thing in the morning and then again after lunch - and an additional capsule as soon as I feel an urge to pull.  Like other users have mentioned, the urge to pull still arises but I am able to overcome it with willpower or distracting myself, whereas before NAC it didn't matter how many times I willed myself to put my hand down, it would invariably find its way back to my face.  This speaks volumes because I've been under a lot of stress at work recently and normally I would've easily lost half an eyebrow by now.  The only side effect I've experienced is heartburn - but it's fine if I take it with food, and the burning subsides fairly quickly.  I have this sub to thank for discovering NAC.  I talked to my psychiatrist about it beforehand and he said it was worth a try.  I did have trouble finding it in stores (in Australia) - the health food stores refused to sell it to me without a ""prescription"" from a naturopath.  So I ordered mine from eBay - I bought the Swanson 100 capsules bottle for $20.  To anyone considering NAC - I say just go for it.  From what I've read on this sub, some have had success with it whilst others have not.  But if there is even a chance it could work for you, it's worth a shot.  It's not expensive to buy - but being able to finally wear mascara again after several months is priceless!!  I also regularly monitor my lash and brow regrowth in the mirror to remind myself not to relapse.  I've suffered from trich since the age of 13, and clinical depression and career stress really took it to the next level.  This is the first time in my entire life that I have made any real progress towards recovery with the aid of NAC.  Feel free to PM me with any questions and I'll do my best to answer.  Best of luck to you!"

Trichsters,2qv4pp,thekatiefilms,4,Tue Dec 30 23:35:30 2014 UTC,"Thrichster here. Started pulling at age 13 when I pulled one hair to perform a 'dandruff cause' test that I saw on TV. I am 32 now and still pulling, but I can say I'm much more in peace with myself so I am going to share the steps that I've taken. Hope it helps!  The first step to deal with trich is to accept yourself with the condition you have. You are not a freak because you pull your own hair. Ignore what everyone says and know you are not alone. It is estimated that 2% of the world population has trichotillomania and we do not know if this number is higher due to the fact that many trichsters hide it throughout their entire lives. I know it's hard to 'see' there's other people out there that get you, so I recommend you to seek a support group online. I am part of this one on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/trichotillomania. There's other ones out there too so don't be ashamed to look for them and join.   Second of all, adjust your expectations. Trich is a poorly studied mental condition and there is no known 'cure' for it. People talk about being 'pull free' but the expression is debatable since it creates the illusion that it'll just go away. You are actually never free of the urge, but you can manage it to a point where you have control. That being said, people who have acquired such level of management over their urge are the minority of the trichster population. Knowing all of this is important because then you'll understand that there's no reason to blame yourself, to be ashamed, to let depression take over. You'll have ups and downs, pull free times and pulling hard times (I myself have been twice 'pull free' for over a year only to regress later to a much worse state). Don't let yourself go but don't beat yourself up if you fail sometimes.  Another important step is to learn to not care about other people's opinions on how you manage your hair or lack of it. My family thinks I am crazy because of my pulling and over the years I've learned to say 'so what?' to anything they say or what I know they think. See, by the nature of trich, your hair becomes a huge thing on your self esteem. You become very self conscious of bald spots and you do what you can to hide them. If anyone says a thing, it probably triggers you pulling more, right? Now, listen to me: You have the right to do what makes you feel better with yourself, and if that means shaving your head bald, go ahead and do it! If it means wearing a wig, a hat, bandanas, scarves, if it means using a baldness concealing powder, if it means rocking the bald spots, or putting on dreadlocks, just do it. When you join a support group, you'll notice many trichsters have exquisite hairstyles and colors, use fancy accessories, or like big wigs. There is absolutely nothing wrong in that. Whatever makes you feel good about your hair is what you should do, no matter what others think of it. Don't be ashamed to love yourself even when others don't understand.  Lastly - and I put this last because of all steps I'm describing this is  what didn't work for me personally - seek medical help. Both a psychiatrist and a psychologist combined. It'll take some trial and error because most doctors don't have a clue of how to deal with trichotillomania and they'll treat your symptoms of depression, anxiety, etc, and not the cause. Often trich coexists and is further triggered by these mental conditions, but they are not what makes you have the urge to pull. When you find the doctors that understand this, they might help you in your treatment with a combination of medication and cognitive behavior therapy (there are no meds for trich specifically, but some depression and anxiety meds can help you manage).  I have been suicidal before and I know how that is. I know well what it is to feel hopeless and rejected like you are the worst of human beings. But like I got over those dark times, I believe you can do it too :)"
Trichsters,2qv4pp,ThighsLoverGirl,2,Wed Dec 31 03:19:27 2014 UTC,I'm sorry for all the horrible things you're going through. :( If i knew how to help you I would but then again I would have already helped myself. Are you taking any medication for the depression or trich?
Trichsters,2qv4pp,todaywasagood_day,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:14:56 2014 UTC,Medication for depression. Thats it.
Trichsters,2qv4pp,snuggle-butt,2,Wed Dec 31 03:17:05 2014 UTC,"Well you have support here. I'm so sorry your family hasn't been helpful. It is okay, you are a worthwhile person with a little problem, it is really not as big a ""flaw"" as people are making it out to be. I hope you are able to seek counseling."
Trichsters,2qv4pp,codhopper,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:55:16 2014 UTC,"Your parents sound like they are unintentionally awful. They are probably great people who just don't know how to help you. Your brother is probably just an arse who learned all of his social finesse from your parents, no doubt.   My big brother teases me about things (I crashed mum's motorbike once...), but never my hair pulling (on my beard) or my face picking (dermatillomania). I get upset, but remember that he is just that way.    I would try to focus on your pulling (not the nasty people in your life). Have you considered trying a supplement like NAC. There seems to be quite a bit of evidence to suggest that it helps with compulsive behaviors. It is also fairly cheap (and safe as far as I can tell).  There was also a fairly recent post about stress and how people respond to it. I pull when I am stressed, but understanding this has really helped me stop pulling a lot. I know I find pleasure pulling out hairs. I know that I shouldn't do it. I still manage to do it anyway.   In regards to finding it (pulling hair) pleasurable, I found it amazingly useful to read The Pleasure Instinct. I have also cut down sugar/chocolate consumption since reading that too. It was really helpful all round to improve my life. I think I've even started enjoying smells (never really enjoyed smelling things before) and feeling things. I can usually not pick now if I have something nice to touch, like a bit of velcro or my headphone cord.    If you are game, try reading this document: http://www.dsm5.org/Research/Documents/Stein_Trich.pdf. I don't know how comfortable you feel with talking about this with your parents (I still haven't told my parents, after knowing about it for about a year), but it might be worthwhile sharing this with them. It is a problem, and as far as I can tell it is treatable. I suspect you're still at home and still a dependent. Your parents may be the best bet you have to stopping (They might be able to help supply you with a therapist, different shampoo/conditioner or some NAC).     I have a friend in hospital for what I think is suicide watch. I have been super scared to talk to him in case I make things worse. I hope you have a lot of supportive friends out there who just don't know how to confront the issue and talk to you. I would really love to offer him some help, like see if he wanted some books/magazines to help pass the time, but I just don't know how strange it would be.   I stalked your comment history a bit. I didn't even know a subreddit was dedicated to shiny pokemon until now. Also, how is your kick boxing going? I have found that yoga was great for helping motivate me to stop picking.   Have you considered cutting your hair shorter like a pixie cut, but not shaving it all off. It seemed to work for a bunch of famous people like Emma Watson, Natalie Portman, Jennifer Lawrence and Felicia Day. (Tip #1 for looking good, be attractive; don't be unattractive). Sorry if that is bad advice for a girl**.  I hope this helps even slightly. If you want to talk about anything just PM me. I am a strange 26yo male from Australia.   P.S I use picking/pulling interchangeably because I pull hairs and pick in the same areas (my face) (/cryface)."

Trichsters,2qit6n,Brandi9514,3,Sat Dec 27 09:54:19 2014 UTC,I'd let him know that trich is a thing and let him take care of it.  Telling him not to pull isn't going to so jack shit so you can stop wasting your breath. Your best bet is to just let him know he's not alone.
Trichsters,2qit6n,juhesihcaaa,3,Sat Dec 27 13:17:07 2014 UTC,"If someone reminded me to not pull my hair it would just make my brain go ""Oh hey hair that's that stuff I like you to pull out you should do that. Right now. And now. And now. Pull pull pull!"" But that's me. It's possible he doesn't know/realize he's doing it, but if you've told him multiple times today he probably does.  I second the suggestion to tell him trich is a thing. He can google it and find out if any of the solutions out there might be right for him."
Trichsters,2qit6n,PredictableChick,1 point,Sat Dec 27 13:44:36 2014 UTC,"My mom yells at him all the time because of the eyelashes and eyebrows so I was just trying to keep him out of trouble. I'm never mean about it. I'm just like ""Oh, dude, you're pulling your hair again."" or I just tap his arm if we're sitting on the couch. I read here that you guys get stressed out if you can't do it, didn't mean him any harm by it. Just didn't want mom to see his new bald patches and flip out."
Trichsters,2qit6n,Oreosmooshy,2,Sat Dec 27 16:40:20 2014 UTC,I second (third?) the other comments. Reminding him will only cause stress and make it worse. But do tell him that this is a legit thing and that he's not alone. Maybe direct him to this subreddit?
Trichsters,2qit6n,chinestoner,3,Sat Dec 27 16:17:33 2014 UTC,"I don't know if I should direct him. He's 11 and I don't know if hes old enough for Reddit.  I only remind him because our mom will scream at him if she catches him with more lost hair. So I just nicely, and gently as possible, say ""Hey man, don't pull. Hey, remember, don't touch."" I think she stresses him into doing it more, I was hoping to prevent that.  He finally grew back one set of lashes and then overnight pulled them all out. When he woke up in the morning and came into the living room my moms jaw dropped and she let out this gasp and yelled ""LITTLE BOY! WHAT DID I TELL YOU! WHY DO YOU DO THIS?!"" So, I'm really worried that if he gets bald patches on his head she'll really get mad."
Trichsters,2qit6n,ladypicker,1 point,Sat Dec 27 16:44:02 2014 UTC,"The trich might be a deeper problem like anxiety or something. Whether it is or not, the best thing is to have someone that he can talk to and not be ashamed about it. I would explain to your mom that screaming at him isn't the solution, and she should try and figure out WHY he is pulling out his hair, instead of just screaming at him not to. He's only 11."

Trichsters,2prdsi,averyatthedisco,5,Fri Dec 19 05:10:54 2014 UTC,"Hi! This is a throwaway account and I have never posted here before, I usually just lurk. I stopped pulling cold turkey about 9 months ago, and for a while I struggled with this as well while the shorter hair was growing in. To deal with it, I bought a very tiny flat iron and I used that to sort of curl the hair downwards if that makes sense?  I bought mine as part of a two-pack (1 large and 1 mini) at target, but I can't find it online anymore. I found this similar pack on overstock. Also, here is a another one on a website I don't recognize, but there is a hand in the picture which is helpful for size reference. After I would sort of curl it downwards I would do my best to comb my longer hair over that area, and then hairspray it.  I know it is a pain now, but in just a few months your hair will be much longer and it will look AWESOME! Good luck, be strong! For me the hardest part of quitting was the first few months, and it looks like you're already over that hurdle :) Also, taking prenatal vitamins should help your hair grow in faster. You can buy them at any pharmacy. Hope this was helpful! Best wishes!"

Trichsters,2pmnre,ladypicker,1 point,Thu Dec 18 00:05:29 2014 UTC,"Hey, I pick in exactly the same place.  You may need to just start using headbands or hats if you've picked back too far.  Put an anti-bacterial cream with pain medication on the picked area.  Bactine/Bacitracin work well.  If you don't want to use medicated creams, try coconut oil.  These will help the area heal and soothe the urge to pick at it. You can try styling your hair differently, but hats and headbands will also help deter picking in addition to covering the area.  You'll be okay, it's just part of having trich.  Focus on helping it heal instead of stressing about how it got that way."

Pulling at eyebrows and eyelashes, have been going through a rough spot right now while studying for finals.  a) you are not ugly. It's hair. It grows back, and I'm sure you're pretty skilled with that brow pencil.  b) Think about the progress you made. It's not that you destroyed that progress, it's that you were able to make it, and that means that you can do it again. Finals are almost over, and hopefully you have a nice stress-free break. Don't let this stress you out. I know it sucks taking a big step backwards, but use this to start making small steps forwards.  c) If your school offers it, try and use their mental health program or counselling. I'm starting mine in the new year (hopefully). If not, try and see if there's a feasible option external to campus.

I know this might be hard to embrace, but you will never escape it because it's part of who you are.  The more you try to reject it and punish yourself for it, the worse it will be.  Relapses are just as much a part of being a person with trich as regrowth.  You're not disgusting or ugly, you're beautiful and you're most certainly not alone.    I pick often when I'm reading or studying.  I use one hand to write or scroll through pages and the other to pick.  I've started wearing hats and headbands and even putting a glove on my free hand when it's bad.    Trich isn't like a sickness where you cure it with a pill or some clever trick.  It's part of who you are.  You have to learn to identify the patterns of your picking and come up with your own ways to combat them.  You can do it, don't lose hope.  Don't be ashamed of who you are."

Trichsters,2o4s9h,TrichyHands,3,Wed Dec 3 06:39:00 2014 UTC,"This is an excellent idea. One of the most useful things my therapist suggested was keeping a log of when, where, and why I'm pulling at my hair. She told me to note down what I'm doing at the moment (i.e. sitting at my desk, driving, watching TV, etc.) how many I've pulled, what my thoughts and feelings are at the time, and of course where I'm pulling from.   Keeping such a log has helped me become more conscious of when my hands even go near my hair, and having it as easily accessible as an app would be incredibly useful. Your ideas offer a lot of expansions on the key points my therapist mentioned as well. You could utilize this for nose picking or nail biting too.  Great idea. I hope you can find a way to get it moving!"

Trichsters,2o4wyn,louisb1304,4,Wed Dec 3 11:13:55 2014 UTC,I told my gilrfriend and she is very supportive.  She reminds me to stop when I start picking... and she lets me play with her boobs whenever I want so my hands have something to do other than pull my hair out.  Edit:  I should probably mention it was initially very difficult for me to tell her about my problem.  I was really nervous and worried about what she would think and how she would react.. but she was very cool about it.

It was really difficult because I've only ever told one ex-boyfriend before and he handled it awfully and told me it wasn't a huge deal (it is to me!), everyone has habits etc. but my current boyfriend was sweet about it and did his own research so he could understand and he is patient with me. Perhaps you could be like 'hey, I came across this really interesting piece on hair pulling' and broach the subject that way? I'm glad I'm open and honest with it about him because I feel more relaxed and he gently tells me to stop and why to stop if I pull in front of him. Plus he also lets me pull out his sweet beard hairs, that's also a bonus ;)"

Probably didn't notice til I told him. I did ask him to tell me when I was picking at my hair because alot of times I don't even realize. That went on for a while (been dating 4+ years), but was not a good idea to ask him to do that because I never would stop because I can't and would start arguments. I just told him not to worry about it and now he just never says anything which makes me feel more comfortable. Just something I've accepted about myself."

I'm a facial hair puller as well and shaving off for me has had the same effect, but I've relapsed several times unfortunately.   My gf doesn't know about it or hasn't said anything but I'm pretty self-conscious about it so I pull more in solitude anyways.   But yea, still awesome for you! My only advice would be if you ever feel like you're about to relapse back into pulling, just shave it back off! That's been my biggest problem from previous experiences.  Good luck!"
Trichsters,2nv6f0,lovesiicles,2,Sun Nov 30 19:24:02 2014 UTC,I do this too. I have one strand of hair that I constantly play with and when I see it has broken ends I snap them off so now that strand of hair is about half the length of the rest of my hair and far more damaged. I don't actually pull out the hairs much. I do pull out my eyebrows though so it could be related.

Get a decent exfoliating face wash, or even a warm damp face cloth and rub the area (during/after a shower) in gentle circles then apply a nice thick moisturiser to keep the skin hydrated after sloughing away the top layer. For another (probably cheaper) option, a thin layer of coconut oil in place of moisturiser is awesome too."

I eat mine too (there's a huuuuuge story to go with that) and I think it really adds to the level of self-loathing/disgust/hate/etc that comes after a session. God it is awful. And then it just really devolves into a huge spiral of self-hate... But thankfully you've got a whole community here that understands.  13 is a really hard age to be pulling, i did it then too. Teenage years are rough enough, and then add this to it. :( I'm so sorry. You can definitely draw in some eyebrows (check out /r/MakeupAddiction !) and that will help a lot. Being able to feel like you look ""normal"" really helps you get through the day.  Some people, like myself, really utilise the guilt that comes after a bad session. Whenever it happens (which it does...) I take and remember that feeling and remind myself of it when I start pulling again the next time. But make sure you do not make yourself feel horrible about this--trich is an every day battle, and blaming yourself only makes it worse. Just remember how pulling made you feel afterwards and ask yourself if it's worth it. It doesn't work for everyone, but it's one of the things I do now.  I find I really really need to do something with my hands. Try going to brush your teeth when you get an urge, or clean your room, something like that. Sometimes I don't even care and pull anyway, but when I DO do this, it seems to help.  You lost today's battle. But you were doing great before, which means you can do this!

When people have anxiety issues and OCD people don't know what words can do to them.

If you're feeling confident enough, you could respond with ""I have a condition that causes me to not have very many eyelashes"".

Freaks them right out; bullies aren't used to being confronted and, in the case where it's a genuine inquiry, it gives them the chance to extrapolate on the question (i.e. 'why are you wearing falsies?  I've just never seen them being worn in the day before etc.') which allows you to reply as you see fit ('Oh, i just love the drama they add to my eye make-up, i feel so pretty in them!).

Some people think it's weird when people wear false eyelashes daily because they think it's only for nights out and whatnot.  If I was asked that, I would just say it's because my eyelashes are short(true) and I like the way my eyes look with longer lashes. No harm there."

Why are you wearing lashes is like...why are you wearing nail polish?  A) why not?  B) do you have some sort of problem?  Am I wildly effecting your day? C) I always felt asking someone why they have chosen to do something personal in such a blunt way is almost accusatory. Like saying ""lashes? EXPLAIN YOUR SELF"". It can put you on the spot and feel VERY uncomfortable. Makeup is a choice, hair cut and color are a choice, clothing is a choice.   Don't ask people why. Its accusatory.   Tldr: I'd be mad too. Shits rude."

Trichsters,2n8cwq,megnification,3,Mon Nov 24 04:34:42 2014 UTC,"To me it's irrelevant if she wasn't self conscious -   ""Why do you wear makeup?"" ""Why do you wear button up shirts?"" ""Why do you only wear flats?"" ""Why are you so thin?""  It's bothersome in any context."

As other posters have said, difficult to tell without tone, but generally I like to think the best of people and imagine they're curious not cruel.  I wear extensions and my go-to response if/when someone notices is simply to say something like 'because they're awesome'. Kinda shuts down the convo and the the other person generally feels obligated to say how good it looks...hehe"

Remember that you're under no obligation to explain yourself to rude people, or anyone else for that matter. A good rebuttal to that kind of rudeness is to just say, ""It's none of your business."" Because it isn't. You don't need to justify your choices to random people.   If other people say they look good and you think they look good, they look good. Rock those eyelashes."
Trichsters,2n93zc,Snickbobbit,1 point,Mon Nov 24 10:29:16 2014 UTC,"I started taking NAC almost 6 weeks ago, and I've had the opposite experience so far. I had tried it inconsistently back in the spring, and had a similar experience to what you describe -- my pulling back in the spring couldn't really possibly be any worse than it was, but I did feel like it somehow increased even further after a few days on NAC. It was discouraging, and I stopped.  But now that I've been on it again for a solid length of time now and have been taking it consistently, my pulling has definitely decreased. I think it did get worse for the first week or so, perhaps because I was thinking about it more in anticipation of a change due to the NAC, and the more conscious of my hair I am, the more I pull at it. But after about two weeks of taking the NAC consistently, my hair pulling decreased significantly. I still definitely pull, way more than I'd like to, but it's not taking over my life anymore like it was before. The one major study on NAC for trich notes that significant improvement was first reported after 9 weeks of treatment, so I remain hopeful that my pulling might decrease even further over the next few weeks. Regardless, NAC clearly isn't something that'll give results overnight.  This isn't to invalidate your experience, but just to report my own. It might be worth a try to stick with the NAC for a while longer and see what happens, unless you feel that the increase in pulling is so severe that you simply can't continue, because like I said, I also experienced an increase in pulling before a decrease."

Trichsters,2n5sra,hurricaneallegra,3,Sun Nov 23 11:53:26 2014 UTC,"How eerie, this is exactly how I started too!  Scratching my head til it bled, and getting scabs!  Then I think I pulled out a hair by accident and it had a big bulb so I started to try to get more!  When my mother noticed both, I did my best to stop scratching so much, and I distributed my pulling more evenly, so it's more like I have thin hair, rather than bald spots.    I keep my hair pulled back most of the time to stop myself from pulling, that helps me.  Possibly that would help you if your hair is long enough?  It does take a huge amount of self-restraint!  I've been doing this since elementary school, I'm 25 now, but I've been able to quit for periods of a few months at a time.  I always start again after a while though :(  But I'm doing my best!    Maybe try to quit pulling for a short period, like a week? See if you can do that?  Then if you can, just try to continue it?  I wish I had better suggestions, I know what a pain it is.    I'm starting to face the possibility that I have more general anxiety too, just based on other features of my personality and ways I react to things. Good luck!"
Trichsters,2n5sra,thebaneofmyexistence,2,Mon Nov 24 05:30:28 2014 UTC,"I have started wearing my hair up sometimes when I am pulling a lot, and it's led to me wearing it up a lot more in general. I don't really like how my hair looks up most of the time, so I usually only do it at home, aside from putting it into a braid when my hair is too dirty to wear down and go to school or work that way. Even when it's up, depending on how it's up, I find ways to pull or pick at it. Yesterday I had it in a bun on the top of my head and, although I can't really pull it off, I did find it made it very hard to pull. I may have to wear it like that more often.  The way you said I should try to stop for just a week and then see if I can keep going reminds me of how I became a vegetarian 9 years ago. I told myself to try out being vegetarian for a week, and I just kept going after that. Maybe I will try that. Thanks :)"
Trichsters,2n5ecz,honeybeeMA,6,Sun Nov 23 06:59:09 2014 UTC,"I'll echo what /u/1cataway says: It's probably one of the more effective ways found to help you deal with trich (and a host of other behaviours). NAC has been showing positive   Getting started (the layman version):    Get a rubber band (or something similar). Put it on your wrist The moment- The very moment you realise you're pulling, or starting to go into that (you know what I'm talking about) mode where you drift or get anxious or wound up, you snap that bugger.   The physical shock/pain causes a type of ""reset"" action that has been found to be incredibly effective at reducing hair pulling. And apart from a welt (you don't have to snap it that hard, though), it has very little side-effects, unlike the earth-shattering effects that Wellbutrin can have. As medical sciences go, medication for trich is hit-and-miss, with lots of side-effects for minor long-term benefits.  Come back here to share your success (or failures)."
Trichsters,2n5ecz,snorbaard,2,Sun Nov 23 17:44:52 2014 UTC,"I am so sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you.   Firstly, I have not received CBT as of yet, despite my best efforts to seek help, doctors keep just putting me on antidepressants (Prozac). They've been completely ineffective. Getting a referral for CBT has not been easy to do as I move a lot as a student and don't have a regular physician.   As a graduate student, I have access to a lot of research regarding treatment for trich, and CBT comes out far ahead of all other forms of treatment (antidepressants work for some, but not for most). My understanding from reading the academic journals is it will start with creating more of an awareness for why and when you pull (triggers, activities, etc). From there the therapist will work with you to help you develop more positive coping methods in those situations.   Again, I haven't received this treatment, as getting someone to take me seriously or offer another treatment aside from drugs, has been nearly impossible. I've pretty well given up on trying to get help until I settle down in one city."

It's perfectly normal to have these feelings after something as traumatic as losing a parent.  It may seems silly, but identifying myself as somebody who pulls, and will most likely pull for the rest of my life, has at least CURBED my pulling. Go ahead and try CBT, it can't hurt, but just remember to go easy on yourself, and hopefully you can come to terms with your loss and your pulling."

You did a really great amount of length, focus on how well you did.   I also pick out my eyelashes when I'm stressed. I used to pull until I had visible gaps which I would hide to an extent with thick black eyeliner. Now I have enough control to stop myself going to that extreme but I still pull and end up thinning out my eyelashes.   I really want to stop pulling though. I'm worried about possible damage it could cause! I don't have any tips other than keep going and don't beat yourself up if you fall off the horse from time to time!"

It was a very confusing time in my life.  I have always been a very anxious person.....Type A if you will. Straight A's, stress, worries about unimportant things. Sleeping has always been a problem and I've even pulled my lashes and brows while asleep. Several years ago my therapist prescribed Ambien to help, but it just made me feel drunk.   I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 6 months ago. At the time I had a goiter and a nodule about 1 cm. Since then, I've grown a second nodule that is 2.5 cm, and they will take a biopsy Monday."

I know that my thyroid numbers were in the ""normal"" range, but pretty close to the edge, but I'm not sure if it was hypo or hyper... That  was also done when I was pretty young.   I wish I knew how old I was when I started pulling and if I started menstruating at the same time... But I feel like I started pulling earlier.    Oh. And adderall. Please be careful. At first it seemed to help so much. I thought I was almost cured! But then it just got worse and worse.   I might honestly be ADD but who knows because I manipulated myself into believing it and giving all the right answers because I wanted my fix."
Trichsters,2m55ip,fingerpies,1 point,Thu Nov 13 05:08:23 2014 UTC,"I had never thought about this...I started pulling about a year before I started menstruating.

Perhaps a combo of both. I don't know.  I have hypothyroidism. I have sleep problems. I have ADHD. Never had mono."
Trichsters,2m55ip,eekasaur,1 point,Thu Nov 13 05:17:13 2014 UTC,"Interesting connections to make. My mom (who definitely does not have trichotillomania) had mono when she was 16 or so, and has also had ongoing energy problems. I have similar energy problems, but I've never had mono. I just turned 19, and I've had trich issues since I was 7 or 8 to varying degrees (much, much worse in the past 7 months).  I have ADHD, primarily inattentive type, diagnosed about a year and a half ago. I'm convinced that I have Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome as well, although it isn't anything I've ever pursued a diagnosis for. But I've also found that my pulling is worse at night.  I think Adderall has made my pulling worse. My big increase in pulling came shortly after switching from taking 20 mg Adderall XR 1x/day to 20 mg 2x/day, although there may not be much of a connection there. If anything, I find myself pulling more when the Adderall is wearing off. It helps so much in other areas, though, that I'd rather just continue taking it and explore other options for controlling the pulling.  I've been pulling a lot less over the past 2 weeks or so than I usually do, and I associated that with having started taking at least 1200 mg of NAC every day, which I think has helped a lot. But I've also had my period since November 1st, which is not at all normal for me and is kind of concerning, as my blood pressure is low and I think I'm becoming anemic. But it might imply some sort of hormonal imbalance that could potentially explain my lack of pulling lately too."

Now that you bring it up, I did start pulling right around the time I started getting a period.  How strange.  I guess that's pretty common, it would appear.

Trichsters,2m4trz,adenrules,4,Thu Nov 13 10:57:03 2014 UTC,"Shaving is a good idea.  I think if you went in to a hairdresser's, they could do it close enough that it would be minimally noticeable.  You sound like you do want to try a new style, though, so see if you can make it work!    I think it'd be best to call ahead and explain that you're missing some hair on one side of your head, and ask if they'd be able to help you figure out either a style that could work around it or help you do a close shave.  If they say no (not likely), you save yourself time; and if they say yes, they've already got an idea of what's going on.  You can tell them that you'd appreciate in advance that they not ask about it as it's a sensitive matter. Even though it might be hard to say over the phone, it'd be easier in person.  It would also keep them from having an initial reaction of ""oh hey, you don't have hair in these spots!"".  If they ask, just reiterate that you'd rather not talk about it as it's a sensitive matter. If they press, which they won't if they have any professionalism, state more firmly that you don't want to talk about it.   Good luck!"
Trichsters,2m4trz,sealifelover5,3,Thu Nov 13 02:25:28 2014 UTC,"I went about 5 years with long hair that I trimmed myself so I wouldn't have to face a hairdresser. After a tough situation with some people who I thought were my friends, I needed a fresh start and decided to finally get a proper haircut - and a major one. I went back to my old hairdresser who I had always really liked, her first comment was on how thin my hair had gotten and I explained that I pick at it. She was super casual about it, just sort of said yeah, I see that a lot, but you should really try not to! and proceeded to ask about what kind of hair cut I would like. I wanted to donate my hair but couldn't because there was too much variation in length, but I still cut off about 8"" leaving me with a super cute bob. Unfortunately I've still been picking since the haircut, but it was definitely the most confident I had felt about my hair in a long time (I think I stopped for like a day). I've gone to 2 other hairdressers since then for trims and both have been not at all judgy about my patches. So I guess moral of the story is it's the hairdresser's job to help give YOU the haircut you want, and even if you feel alone they have probably seen other trichsters before and will hopefully be professional/nice enough to help you out!   also one last tip - for anyone else who cuts their own hair, definitely invest the $20-$30 on a proper pair of hair scissors! otherwise you will end up with split ends, dryer hair, and inevitably more picking.   good luck with the cut!"

Whenever this happens, I try to just take everything one second at a time. First thing I'd do is try to go back into a relaxed/calm place.. maybe leave the room I'm in, or go look for something to eat or do.  One of the most important things to realize is that it's okay to cry, to express this stress/emotion in a more safer way (I threw a few things on the floor, but my goal was just to just leave my body alone).  Every individual may handle this situation differently. I really believe that people's focuses depend on their personality and lifestyle. For me, I try to get my emotional/mental state in a calmer place, before trying to solve my physical appearance. Since I don't know you personally, I can't say what advice is right or wrong, but I really feel that it's important to handle one situation one at a time.  First, handle the situation of you feeling like you're at rock bottom. Whenever I felt like I hit this place, it was mostly due to anxiety of how others would react to what I did to my hair. Other times, it would be because I was angry at how I couldn't stop when I wanted to. When I was aware of what was giving me this anxiety, I was able to freeze everything I was doing, step back from reality, and just do things that made me happy.  I also believe it's important to love yourself for how you look now (it's extremely easier said than done for me though). In my own opinion, sometimes I believe that when I grow my hair out, that I'll get my confidence or self esteem back. But, I can't really continue this struggle unless I have the confidence now in order to begin.  Sorry for the long post, I just feel like our emotional/mental state has a lot to do with what causes these triggers for us. Taking baby steps might take a while, but it can help in the long run."
Trichsters,2lxzhw,TrichyHands,1 point,Tue Nov 11 10:19:07 2014 UTC,"I can't really speak to growing back lashes, as my areas of picking have often been my hairline and my eyebrows.  I did however, have a really serious relapse a few months ago.    I tweezed about 1/2 inch into my hairline across my entire forehead.  It was really bad.  I was so embarrassed I said it was a grilling accident.  My partner was really understanding this time, but I remember when I first told him that I have trich.    I had thinned out my eyebrows so much that he was visibly shocked when he saw them.  My eyebrows are black and thick usually, so I looked really different.  I was really hurt and shamed by his reaction... he realized how bad it made me feel though and it helped us open up a dialogue about my trich.    I would suggest using coconut oil to soothe the picked at area and soften the new growth, so it's not prickly.  Just remember, it's okay.  Don't be too hard on yourself, it will just make you more likely to pick at your new lashes.  We are who we are, relapses and all."
Trichsters,2luatq,bandofcats,3,Mon Nov 10 07:45:16 2014 UTC,"It's my experience that scalp stimulation makes me more likely to pull, not less. But those things feel amazing, especially on my trouble spots."
Trichsters,2luatq,PredictableChick,3,Mon Nov 10 13:18:51 2014 UTC,"I bought three of these, and you have to be extremely careful when using them. As mentioned by u/PredictableChick, the stimulation can bring more sensation/attention to your scalp/head. This can end up going both ways, either a positive sensation, causing you to feel relieved and stop; or, give you unwanted sensation, making you want to continue.  When I first purchased them, I stopped for a good week or so (which was a big jump for me). The only downside is how large they are, so having them around is a little more difficult to manage. Sometimes, I'd get carried away by my work, so I'd forget to use the massager, since it was farther away from me, and my hands were closer to my head.  If you do decide to use one, make sure to get one with weak/rubber tips on the ends of it; if it's too strong/tight, it could scratch your scalp too harshly."
Trichsters,2luatq,TrichyHands,2,Tue Nov 11 09:55:35 2014 UTC,"ive never used a head massager...but I have noticed that the days I use my Clarisonic Mia (fancy face scrubber) I do not pull my eyebrows as much. Since noticing, I make sure to go over my eyebrows and really stimulate the area with the Mia. I can't use it everyday because it over exfoliates and irritates my skin but it has been great for my skin in general and the reduction in pulling has been an added bonus!"

Trichsters,2lpgra,throwawayawayhair,17,Sat Nov 8 21:31:54 2014 UTC,"It is related to ocd in that in is within the ocd spectrum, but it is classed as an impulse control disorder. I have both, so I will tell you the difference I've experienced. In OCD, you have an urge to do something followed by a feeling of dread/anxiety or fear  that something bad will happen if you don't fulfil the urge. Trichotillomania and dermatillomania consist of only urges, like an itch that needs to be scratched. They stem from normal grooming urges that all animals have, except the sufferer overdoes it to the extreme point of causing damage.   Trichotillomania and dermatillomania are distinct from self harm behaviour because in self harm, the object is to injure in order to feel relief from endorphins or to punish one's self. In trich and derm', however, the object is to remove the blemish/scab/pus/hair as it is seen as an unwanted imperfection. The damage/balding is an unwanted side effect."
Trichsters,2lpgra,veganmua,3,Sat Nov 8 22:33:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks, that paints a much clearer picture of OCD for me. Your description of trich is definitely how I feel.  I guess my other question is how do I find a healthy line between grooming and trich? I've already got a lot of hair on my face and looking at my grandpa it looks like it's only getting worse."
Trichsters,2lpgra,veganmua,1 point,Sat Nov 8 22:43:33 2014 UTC,"Hmm now that's a tougher question! I usually pull from my head, so I have my hair in plaits most of the time to stop me finding hairs I want to pull. In your case, I would suggest maybe finding a beauty therapist/barber to trim or remove facial/eyebrow hairs. Also find something to keep your hands occupied, like a stress ball or a fidget toy."

I'd randomly share information about how people can suffer through anxiety/stress/depression; then mentioned a few times of multiple forms of compulsive conditions; then shared a few informational charts/graphs about Trich. Although some knew about it for a while (and didn't mind), others came up to me to tell me that they'd love me no matter what.

Trichsters,2lcxjr,TrichyHands,5,Wed Nov 5 11:39:27 2014 UTC,"I didn't have major problems with my beard pulling until college (In Australia that is our years 11 and 12, aged 16-18). It started off pretty mediocre,  with pimples and ingrown hairs,  but gradually it became an addiction. I wouldn't feel happy until I removed ""that annoying hair"",  or cleared out a patch of ""hairs which are causing me problems"". I am 26 now.   I didn't see it as a problem back then. I knew I did it more than other people,  but I thought it was pretty normal. I am horribly shy (because I feel like people just look at the sores on my face). I've been told recently that ""my face is looking much better"" which really lifted my spirits.   I suppose I digressed a little... I really mean to say that I am glad you're picking up on it early and looking for a solution.  Have you considered a radical change like a short haircut or undercut? Fidget rings or another thing to play with?   I would also suggest that you write down a journal of your feeling,  surroundings and motivators for picking. It should be easy enough if you have a notepad for jotting down notes. An example would be ""haven't washed my hair today,  I feel a knot near my ear. I just want it gone. This lecture is the same as last week's. Sitting near the window makes me want to sit outside in the sun.""   Keep us posted about how you are going.

A lot of people mentioned the journal thing (and myself to other people), I use it time to time and should probably stick to at least once a day or something.  Also, I feel like trimming my hair would lower my confidence, not sure why... It's just not who i am (if that makes sense)  Either way, I'm really glad I got a personal response. Thanks once again."
Trichsters,2l6796,mortalheavypresent,3,Mon Nov 3 17:11:10 2014 UTC,"I have been picking my face for about 10 years. Primarily pulling hairs and squeezing things around my beard. I have known that trich/dermatillomania have existed for about a year now. I have some tips which have helped me come a long way.    Shave with a short electric beard trimmer (1mm seems amazing for me, .5mm and 3.5mm were bad and seemed to foster ingrowns,  infectioned follicles or pulling). I tried double-edged razors and a cartridge pack,  but those weren't any better.  I think I am mildly allergic to a lot of soaps and fragrance. I have seen vast improvement just moving away from washing my face with soap all the time. I dig at ingrown hairs (and parches which feel like they might have one) with a needle and tweezers. Throwing these out helped me a lot (I got new ones which I use when my confidence rating is high,  95% sure there is an ingrown hair) Put a clock in the bathroom. Keep an eye on it. I used to pick for about an hour or more in a trance almost. The clock helps me keep an eye on the time.  Don't rely on your GF to have a magical solution. She can help a bit by reminding you that you are picking,  but she isn't your minder. I think you will need to train yourself to know when you are picking and why.  When you pick write a note in a book. Just something quick like ""The Internet is down,  super bored and pulling at hairs on right chin."" Train yourself to notice situations which may trigger increased picking activity. Fiddle toys might help if you sit around bored all day.    Just keep at it. Don't forget that you are trying to improve. Backwards steps happen sometimes. Experiment with things that work for you.   EDIT: Formatting and don't forget to change your pillow and sheets often."

I think I'm a little allergic to most soaps too, which is why I've been meaning to find a fragrance free soap in the hopes that it'll help. The ingrown hairs are the worst I find, especially because they never seem to go away. I'll have to try shaving with an electric trimmer to see if that will help. I'm glad I have my GF to remind me to stop when she notices, but I agree with you that it is more important for me to try and train myself to know when I'm picking. I think I'll try the little notebook idea, that seems like something I could do pretty easily. As for fiddle toys, I think that's a good idea too. Is there anything you would recommend that has worked for you?"

There has been some positive results from silly putty, but I've never tried it.   Check out /r/SkinCareAddiction and /r/CompulsiveSkinPicking if you haven't already.   I forgot to suggest so many things before.   Try taking progress pictures.  Trim your fingernails frequently (And clean them frequently with a scrubbing brush and some sort of cleaner (triclosan maybe (sp?) usually marketed as anti bacterial face wash). Mindfulness training. Try understanding what drives you (look at your life in the perspective of a coherent sack of chemicals used to propagate DNA). Origin of the Species,  Richard Dawkins' books,  'The Pleasure Instinct'. Adjust your perspective. Shift paradigms and all that.  Lose weight (or put some on),  make an effort to be healthier. Sleep more. Investigate the possibility that NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) might help. I have been taking it for a while. Seems to he working for me (or it is at least a good placebo)."

I also can't say I can give any definite advice because I really haven't beaten my trich either. I know when I pull I get angry as well, but use that anger positively. Take pictures after your next pull, and look at them from time to time, even when you don't have the urge to pull. It'll remind you that pulling's not worth it.  Find someone to talk to. A doctor can refer you to someone who has the qualifications to sit down with you see what methods you can take to try to change your behaviours. And it's a lot easier to do it with someone than to do it alone.  And finally, remember that even if you are having a bad day, you're still beautiful. Hope any of this helped."

You have a different personality, goals, and interests in life that nobody else in this world can come close to.  Don't look at your anger in a negative light. See it as a step forward, you seem to already have a good perspective on it since you know you want to stop.  You're still in a maturing phase, hair usually grows for years after years. Just take it a day at a time, (a minute at a time if needed)  Although my experiences might be different from yours, I'd recommend anything that makes you feel good in a positive, healthy way. Stuff like fidget toys, head scratchers (they look funny but feel good), getting nails done or different (different feeling of picking could make you notice quicker), or brushing/braiding hair (I personally wouldn't recommend anything that gets my fingers too close to my head though).  I haven't tried this yet, but I feel like having a fidget/spinning ring or bracelet might help out a lot, to keep my hands away from my head as much as possible.  Also, don't worry about messing up; (there's multiple battles going on at once) don't dwell on just what is seen. Your whole future is still full of small and large victories."

Trichsters,2knokf,22catch,2,Wed Oct 29 14:39:53 2014 UTC,Thank you so much for the recommendations. I'll check these out this afternoon. I visited a local gp and she didn't suggest anything and basically told me I would not be  able to do anything about the discolouration. So you've basically made my day :)

Actually I live near Byron Bay and it's a very popular and stunning part of NSW so I do not want to spend my summer hiding in my shame so to speak. (But gosh the women around here are beautiful, flawless creatures its hard to imagine any of them even have pubic hair) I have bio oil and I think it's helping. I'm trying to take progress shots to remind myself its actually getting better. They are strange photoshoots but I think it's a good idea. But it makes me guard my precious phone like a hawk. Thanks for the suggestion of swimmers, I already started looking - great advice :D"

Trichsters,2kdfyp,breathcomposed,2,Sun Oct 26 15:07:32 2014 UTC,What do you mean you failed? There is no failing in Trich. This is a medical disorder. It is real. We technically should have no control over pulling or not pulling. The days that we somehow do manage to not pull should celebrated! But the days we do pull are NOT failures. You are allowed to be disappointed but it is not a failure and you can only learn and grow from it. And the only one who can be disappointed is yourself. You are amazing and you are doing a great job each and every day.
Trichsters,2kdfyp,cptrafiki,3,Sun Oct 26 16:38:24 2014 UTC,"I haven't posted here in a while, and suddenly saw a new user posting about progress pics and I felt as if I'd been dethroned (although no one knew I started plucking again and I doubt anyone missed my posts... I'm just fucked up like that).  A month ago or so, I was high on inspiration and posted here about creating a pact amongst fellow Trichsters to not pull or pluck for 6 months. For the next several weeks, I posted pictures of my progress in hopes of motivating others to do the same. But I was too ambitious for my own good. I went about three weeks without plucking and then one day, had a field day with my tweezers (but within reason, for once). Now my eyebrows are fuller than they've been for years and they actually seem to have some shape to them (I have a natural arch?! who knew!) but it'll probably be a while before they get full enough to where I can get them professionally waxed and then I can simply maintain the shape with tweezing the stray hairs.  That's why I said I failed.  Thank you for your kind words."
Trichsters,2kdfyp,pseudoscienceoflove,3,Sun Oct 26 17:33:06 2014 UTC,"Oh, don't beat yourself up!  I have had completely absent eyebrows before, and after I was able to regrow them, I started to do a little of my own shaping. It was a while before I completely broke away from going to salons for my eyebrows, but now I pretty much just do them myself.  I don't really like pacts or counting pull free days, because for many reasons it's very, very discouraging for just a small failure. I still occasionally pull, but I now have a full set of eyelashes and eyebrows, and have had them for over a year. This is a HUGE success for me. And I get a little bit bummed when I pull out an eyelash absentmindedly, but I don't beat myself up anymore. Because guilt has never been a good motivator.  So keep on doing you. Don't worry about pacts, because one hair/spree isn't an overwhelming failure, and it doesn't mean you have to start completely over. It just means you still have work to do. And that's okay, because we all do."

I've discovered a while ago that caffeine really triggers my pulling (which is sad because I'm a HUGE coffee lover). Now that I've made the switch to decaf and have seen a major improvement in my urges to pull. And since making the decaf switch about two weeks or so ago, I've been able to see a lot of improvement on my scalp regrowth, where I typically pull from.   My goal for this upcoming week is to track what I eat so I can ensure that I am getting the nutrients I need for regrowth."
Trichsters,2kbm43,Random_Rules,2,Sat Oct 25 22:34:04 2014 UTC,Day six of no major pulling. Mentally preparing myself to buzz my head monday. The set back I had a month or so ago is a little too visible right now. It'll be nice to get a fresh start (and see my natural hair color)

There is no reason to feel worse about yourself simply because you either do, or do not have trich.  Focus on being relaxed and less stressful about yourself.  Trich is a buildup of anxiety and a sense that changing yourself will somehow compensate.  You are perfect just the way you are . . . you and your hair are awesome.

And did you respectfully explain to those people what's going on? Did they keep asking?  Remember that you deal with an issue on a daily basis that they may never have heard of before, and probably don't understand at all. Ignorant questions are highly likely.  If you wish to be treated with respect, you need to take a step back and answer the questions without emotion/embarrassment/fear/taking offense. Education is key here. Huffing about it is not going to help anybody.  And honestly, if people around you know what's up, it will vastly reduce the anxiety you have, which in turn are triggers."
Trichsters,2k5tnv,snorbaard,2,Fri Oct 24 13:47:41 2014 UTC,"I agree, I think if more people just asked me why and let me explain to them what is going on it would be fine.

If you made it to this subreddit, you have already made the effort, and found there are others like you.  If someone asks you a stupid or ignorant question, rolling your eyes is never going to change their mind. Instead of learning that trich is a thing that exists which affects people of all kinds, they might now just think of you as an asshole girl that bit their head off, or a weirdo dude that was fiddling with his eyebrows all the time.   I accept that I might have been a bit strong with the way I approached it, but I feel incredibly strong that education is the only way to find - if not acceptance - at least an understanding. Do you think homosexuals gained understanding and acceptance by hiding in the shadows and not educating heterosexuals? Or what about the stigma of depression? Until people started talking about it, public perception was nonexistent and just plain wrong (""why don't you just cheer up?"", ""snap out of it!"", etc.)  If nobody talks about it and educates those who do not know, trich will always stay a secretive and shameful thing. If more people know about it, the chances of an adult actually recognising it and helping an adolescent are so much higher."
Trichsters,2k5tnv,snorbaard,1 point,Mon Oct 27 13:35:04 2014 UTC,"I realised after I clicked send I didn't address your core question about how a kid should reply, and instead focused on what should happen in an ideal situation.  Of course reacting with embarrassment or silent when you don't actually know what's going on yourself is an acceptable response. Kids are kids, and they can be terrible. I know a kid who got a huge knot in his hair (crown, about the size of a coke can in diameter) after using a pencil to knot his hair, and in a panic cut the pencil out, leaving a huge gaping hole. The kid was 11, and had absolutely no idea what was going on. Wore a hat to school the next day (uniformed school so this actually stuck out worse), so the first chance the kids got they ripped the hat off and the whole class started laughing at him.   That's pretty much worst case scenario. He burst out in tears and ran out of class, right into a teacher.   Now your question is about how kids are supposed to react - and my answer stays the same. If they know what's going on, it is important to tell people. What they do with that information after that is their business. If they taunt/call names/etc., it's their business, and they would have done so even without knowing. But doing so makes them worse assholes, and you can make a value judgement on that.  What about kids who don't know? Well it makes no difference what I think, right? Because they won't know. But if they don't know, and someone else had heard about trich, things might change for the better.  I think you're either completely reading my statements in a different voice than I intend, or your purposefully focusing on something I don't address instead of the bits I do (and refusing to aknowledge it):   If you know that you're a trich sufferer, it's your responsibility to increase awareness about the affliction, nobody else's. If you don't educate people, they won't  learn about it by osmosis. They will keep asking stupid or hurtful questions, possibly teasing.  Also: Bitching and complaining about it here (it is a safe place after all) is perfectly okay, but will also trigger those of us who believe in education to reply.  And finally: I'm okay if people disagree with me. For me there's nothing more important than having the conversation - that way everyone learns (participants and observers). If someone's mind is changed, I consider it a step in the right direction."

Trichsters,2k5tnv,Texanjumper,2,Fri Oct 24 21:12:22 2014 UTC,"So recently I found something that works for me and I haven't pulled much in 8 weeks. I posted on Facebook and ""came out"" in regards to my trich.   Yesterday I was caravaning with my aunt (she was following me to my parent's house she is unfamiliar with) and at a light I took my hair down and had ones that had come loose/unattached (I shed like crazy). I rolled down the window and threw out the hairs. When we got to the venue, she asked if I was pulling out my hair, because if I was she was ""going to get onto"" me about it.   ... sigh I know she means well, but not your place."
Trichsters,2k5tnv,snorbaard,3,Sun Oct 26 15:19:11 2014 UTC,"She really meant well. But she probably has not idea what to do, and thinks that by bringing your attention to it that you will be able to stop.  Your aunt is unconsciously doing something that many cognitive therapists try to teach people with various trigger afflictions. Usually they tell you to wear a rubber band on your arm that you snap when you realise your getting stuck in an anxiety loop. The sharp pain of the rubber band snapping is oftentimes enough to pull you out of the ""pulling trance""  Big fist-bump on coming out on Facebook. That must have taken an enormous amount of courage."
Trichsters,2k5tnv,Texanjumper,1 point,Sat Oct 25 01:34:42 2014 UTC,"Thank you!

I know she's trying to help. She just....she's a space cadet. She does this stuff (comments) all the time. We've (family) learned to just look at each other and make an ""are you serious?!"" face and move on. It's just... That's not her place. We know that. It's been part of my life since I was 13 and it's still hard for my mom to realize it's not her place, even.   Thanks again. It really was hard.

I've also been migraine free for 8 weeks (when I'd get them weekly).

Trichsters,2k5tnv,snorbaard,2,Mon Oct 27 22:34:44 2014 UTC,I mentioned to my boyfriend once about my fears that I had trich. He told me that he believed he had trich too because he had a nervous habit that involved biting at the hairs on his knuckles.
Trichsters,2k5tnv,AlenaBrolxFlami,2,Tue Oct 28 08:56:48 2014 UTC,What. That's not even the same thing.
Trichsters,2k5tnv,snorbaard,3,Tue Oct 28 11:19:47 2014 UTC,I have to disagree. It's very similar. I know trich sufferers who do just that.

Trichsters,2k5tnv,AlenaBrolxFlami,1 point,Sat Oct 25 05:06:10 2014 UTC,But biting at hairs is definitely not the same thing as pulling it out.
Trichsters,2k5tnv,emprem,1 point,Sat Oct 25 20:57:44 2014 UTC,"Nah, but many trich sufferers also eat the hair they pull out. Some just pick at the hair and play with it. Some nibble the hair at origin (armhair, long hair). Some pull it off and break it, then nibble at it, and some chew on it. Some even accidentally/on purpose swallow it.  The human brain is such a complex and amazing thing that so many items overlap. While taking a nibble at your finger knuckle hair isn't the definition of trich, it's surely related, and definitely not something ""normals"" do. It's very likely just a bad habit, but at what point is a bad habit actually pathological?"

I don't even want to talk about my teenage days of using a black eyeliner pencil to draw in my very very sparse eyebrows! It was not pretty!  Edit: if you do it right, it's both easy and subtle. Bear in mind that messing with your brows after application can smudge them/make them look fuzzy, but I have found that that deters me from fiddling with them.  Also, don't worry about going with some “fierce power brow” shit, all you have to worry about is meeting the goal YOU wanna reach."
Trichsters,2k4gl9,ElissaLove,1 point,Fri Oct 24 08:26:37 2014 UTC,"Thanks, yeah I definitely wouldn't go with pure black. I just want to look like I have normal eyebrows as much as possible but not have anyone notice that I'm wearing makeup. If i wear makeup I do it only to give a slight enhancement and not to look like I'm wearing makeup"
Trichsters,2k4gl9,ElissaLove,3,Fri Oct 24 09:25:37 2014 UTC,Yeah. I pull from my brows and lashes. Always always need brow makeup. I use Anastasia brow wiz pencils and dipbrow (very little.) I spend the money on them because I use them daily and I need them to look natural and I need it to last!  Definitely try something more inexpensive to start with. I've heard NYX has great brow stuff.
Trichsters,2k4gl9,cptrafiki,2,Thu Oct 23 19:45:41 2014 UTC,"Honestly I browsed r/makeupaddiction and they have tutorials. I mostly browsed for product recommendations. My Anastasia stuff lasts all day. And I go to the gym with it on. Try not to touch it though because it could smudge. I've had A LOT of practice doing my brows. I used to use eyeliner in high school (a mess!) and the difference of proper brow pencil, etc is night and day."
Trichsters,2k4gl9,cptrafiki,1 point,Sat Oct 25 16:23:53 2014 UTC,"This pencil is relatively inexpensive, can be found at Target, CVS, etc, and has been working for me for years. I don't hear people talk about it much, but it has been a wonder as it is capable of doing light streaks or heavy depending on the pressure you apply which I find is very rare. It is also somehow waterproof so I never worry when swimming or for sweat while running and I barely have any eyebrows at all right now. I never use the gel side so it does seem like a waste, but the pencil part is so perfect I believe its worth it. I would definitely check it out at least. I use it in dark brown  and I have very dark brown hair that is lighter in the sun and it matches perfectly."
Trichsters,2k4gl9,cocacolahead,1 point,Sat Oct 25 16:58:18 2014 UTC,"Hey, that looks good and I think is available in the UK which is where I'm from but I have dark brown hair and my eyebrows are even darker so I think the darkest brown they have looks too light. It's a shame they don't have a wider range of colours."
Trichsters,2k4gl9,_janada,1 point,Thu Oct 23 19:59:18 2014 UTC,"I think you should try the dark brown, you'd be surprised. The pencil itself looks pretty light but you can get it to be pretty dark when you draw them on. My hair is almost black at times and the shade is perfect."
Trichsters,2k4gl9,kapelin,2,Fri Oct 24 07:53:04 2014 UTC,OK thanks. I definitely think I will check this out then
Trichsters,2k4gl9,sigmasunshine,1 point,Fri Oct 24 11:57:41 2014 UTC,"I've tried a lot, including things especially made for brows, even the $23 Anastasia brow powder.  I have been at times completely without eyebrows, and I currently have patches, and the best thing through all these years has been Maybelline's self-sharpening eyeliners.  I think the powder only works to define the lines of already filled-out brows.  I just apply Maybelline's ""Unstoppable"" in light, short strokes, and slowly build up the color.  It's pretty cheap and stays put during the day, but I always keep one on me.  I use espresso to match my naturally medium-dark brown hair.  The key with any of the products as another commenter said is light pressure and short strokes."
Trichsters,2k4gl9,KittenImmaculate,1 point,Fri Oct 24 14:31:36 2014 UTC,"I don't think Annabelle is available outside of Canada, but for anyone here who needs a good, cheap eyebrow pencil, this works wonders.  Also, for eyelash pullers, their eyeliners that aren't Kohl pencils have been my holy grail since I was 12.  Edit: formatting"
Trichsters,2k4gl9,HeatherMarMal,1 point,Thu Oct 23 20:22:54 2014 UTC,"This is from a comment I've left before:   I pull my eyebrows too. I use makeup whenever I leave the house and that has just been my routine for some number of years now. It's annoying and I would love to be able to feel confident in my own skin blah blah blah, but honestly I just feel better with makeup on. I have used Benefit's brow zings for years, but recently I picked up Too Faced brow envy at Nordstrom Rack and I love it! I recommend both and both will last you a long time (even if you use it multiple times a day, like I do). I feel like any amount of money (to an extent) is worth feeling comfortable leaving the house. Good luck, I hope one of those works out for you!"
Trichsters,2k3vzj,100_magic_rings,1 point,Thu Oct 23 16:26:44 2014 UTC,"I take them everyday and I am happy with the results, but they are not a cure-all. At most, they have helped me repress the urges and become more aware of them, but I still need to make the decision to not pull.   You can get NAC at health stores or online. They won't break the bank so I'd at least give them a shot."
Trichsters,2k3vzj,deegan258,1 point,Thu Oct 23 17:29:55 2014 UTC,"I have found that, for me, I must take them religiously at the same time everyday or I won't take them. I'll put it off or forget and then I find myself pulling again.   A side effect that I don't care for is bronchial spasms. However, if I take my inhaler right when I take the NAC then I'm fine.   My routine is: Max Green Alchemy Scalp Rescue shampoo and conditioner - this helps the tingling sensation I get on my scalp that make me feel like I need to pull. NAC - same time everyday. Spinner ring - when I notice a hand going towards my scalp, I switch the ring to that hand and start playing with it until my focus is off my hair."
Trichsters,2k2e0b,rayoflight824,1 point,Thu Oct 23 04:02:21 2014 UTC,Try nioxin or bosley shampoo. Pricey but it helps thicken your hair.  Or if you can help it. Try growing your hair out and using gel.  I'm a hairdresser and I have trich. I know a few techniques.  Or try a bandana or shaving the whole thing. I know more tricks for girls.. sorry.
Trichsters,2k2e0b,KellynHeller,2,Thu Oct 23 04:22:54 2014 UTC,"I'm currently taking biotin, but I'll try the nioxin shampoo. Shaving isn't an option because I'm really skinny and kinda tall so it would look weird."
Trichsters,2k2e0b,KellynHeller,1 point,Thu Oct 23 04:27:27 2014 UTC,"Would growing it out work? Then you could push and like gel the hair over the spots. Or is long hair a trigger? It is for me. So I keep my hair short.  Nioxin makes your hair appear thicker. And it's also just a good shampoo.  Biotin is great btw. Keep taking that! I wish I could. It makes me a super grease ball   Also I know you didn't ask for it, but I've been able to control my trich by taking anafranil. It's dr prescribed but it works for me. Just in case you wanted to know."
Trichsters,2k2e0b,KellynHeller,1 point,Thu Oct 23 04:33:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'm growing it out, but I was just asking for any advice regarding how to hide the patches while it's still growing out."

Trichsters,2k2e0b,22catch,1 point,Fri Oct 24 04:38:15 2014 UTC,Thanks for the help :) it really means a lot to get any support at all from other ppl with trich. I sometimes feel incredibly abnormal for struggling to deal with this.
Trichsters,2k2e0b,GraySpade,1 point,Fri Oct 24 05:23:44 2014 UTC,I feel the same way. But through my job I have actually encountered people with trich and it makes me so happy to help them. I've been able to overcome my own trich and I know it's incredibly hard. One of my clients actually told me about taking anafranil to stop it. So far it's working and I'm so happy.
Trichsters,2k2e0b,GraySpade,1 point,Fri Oct 24 09:30:23 2014 UTC,"You could try hair mascara. It is used to cover grey hair but if you use a light hand on the scalp and make sure it looks natural, it could cover up the patch."
Trichsters,2k2e0b,louisb1304,1 point,Thu Oct 23 11:15:39 2014 UTC,hey man i have the same issue. I only have one spot but its bad. honestly? I just wear beanies and bandanas. all the time. you could also try buzzing it. I like wrapping my hair around my fingers when i pull and when i can't do that I pull less
Trichsters,2k2e0b,rosegrove87,1 point,Thu Oct 23 11:52:57 2014 UTC,"I bought some hats at American Apparel that look nice, so I'll see how that goes.  I'd rather not shave or buzz it b/c it would like bad. But in the worst case, if I end not being able to wear a hat and the bald spots remain, I'll just shave it all off and endure looking weird versus letting people know that I pulled out my own hair... Ugh I hate myself for doing this -_-"
Trichsters,2k2e0b,ProsimiansOnPluto,1 point,Fri Oct 24 03:24:42 2014 UTC,i hear ya loud and clear... I really don't wanna shave my head either but oh well :/ best of luck to ya mate
Trichsters,2k2e0b,SurrealBird,1 point,Fri Oct 24 10:56:52 2014 UTC,"Give yourself a break. We don't pull because we want to do it. We do it because there's a bit of a short circuit in our wiring. In the end, though, it's just hair, we aren't serial killers or dealing with something debilitating, thank God.   Anyway, you say you were undergoing an enormous amount of stress that led to pulling, but I seriously doubt that the pulling you could have done in that time frame would have damaged the hair on your whole head. I mean, once you pull out a hair, it's out. It's not even long enough to pull again for a few months. Stress, though, can do a real number on your hair. Since you say that your hair on your whole head is thinning, and that regrowth is slow, then I'd say you are suffering the after-effects of all the stress you experienced.  Since you're a guy, you can get away with shaving it. Hell, tell people you're doing it for Movember and donate some money. Nobody will think twice about it. Anyway, whether you cut it or not is up to you, but you should also start some good hair habits.   Reduce stress levels. A regular exercise regimen is excellent here. I also have taken to taking 5-10 minutes where I just sit quietly with my eyes closed, no distractions, and clear my mind of my thoughts while listening to some calming music. It isn't quite meditation, but it helps you relax and come down from the stress of the day. Heck, if you know how to meditate, do that. Biotin supplements. You can find these practically anywhere. I've been using Costco's ""Hair Skin Nails"" supplement and it is quite inexpensive. You should also make sure to take a good multivitamin and to eat your daily RDA of protein.  A good quality shampoo and conditioner. It'll probably cost more than you're used to, but it will also be concentrated so you'll need to use a lot less. The stuff I use is really pretty pricy, but I've used Redken quite a bit and been happy with it, and you can usually find a sale on liter bottles pretty easily. It'll cost $30 for the pair but last you a good six months or more. If you're not a conditioner user then you can just buy the shampoo.  One thing I've also been doing is brushing my hair with a good quality paddle brush ($15-20 at Ulta) at night to stimulate blood flow to the scalp. Kind of relaxing, certainly doesn't hurt.   None of this is an instant cure, but it will get your body back on track. In the next several months or so, I'm willing to bet you will see improvement. Remember, stress doesn't just affect your hair--your hair is just kind of the canary in the coal mine. Stress also affects your heart, your immune system, your blood pressure, your digestion, everything. Your whole body will benefit from paying attention to these details.   So, to sum up: Regular exercise, get all your vitamins, a biotin ""hair skin nails"" supplement to maximize your hair's nutrition, a daily de-stressing routine where you make a point of relaxing quietly, and a good shampoo/conditioner. And patience."
Trichsters,2jx1ou,Tiph8uh5knee,2,Tue Oct 21 19:30:31 2014 UTC,"Anti anxiety-medication gave me the extra help to stop. It's hard to break the habit-pattern but it's doable! I got a lot of help from therapy, family and an ex-bf who would simply tell me ""No"", then take my hands away from the pulling. I think it got some negative reinforcements that were neccessary to stop completely. Like: ""This is bad, and I should not do it"". You have to take care of the reasons of why you are pulling.. and then work on those issues. And be proud of each minute you have avoided it. If you ""relapse"" one or two times it's okay, but keep working. I had trich from when I was a young teenager - to adulthood, and haven't pulled anything since about 2 years now. There is hope!"
Trichsters,2jx1ou,girlonthemoon,1 point,Wed Oct 22 08:02:45 2014 UTC,"(F/22 trich since 6th grade) my experience with medications is plentiful. Taking just an anti anxiety will help your anxiety, but I found that the compulsion to pull never really stopped or even slowed down. Try asking your dr about gabapentin. It cut my compulsions and addictions down ALOT."
Trichsters,2jqtek,AbomodA,2,Mon Oct 20 01:37:00 2014 UTC,I'm currently 9 months pregnant and noticed a dramatic increase in the pulling. A mix of the anxiety and hormones haven't been too kind with my Trich. I've been pulling for 12 years now and it's the worst it's ever been unfortunately. I'm hoping for a little bit of relief after the baby is here.

I never realised trich was so closely related to addictive behaviours, but it makes a lot of sense now I think about it. I live in the UK, so there's a chance I can get treatment without having to pay - but of course there are people with much more serious issues on the waiting list. I think I'll do as you suggest and look up some treatments I can try and implement myself. As I said the trich is mild at the moment, but I know it may not stay that way forever."
Trichsters,2jovhp,APoorEstimate,1 point,Sun Oct 19 14:21:16 2014 UTC,"Same boat here. Pulling for 20 years and the only sign is broken hair along my part. I keep coming back to a possible physiological problem. I wonder why it hurts to pull pube but feels great to pull hair and not just any hair. Why on earth would I pull a nape of my neck hair. That's idiotic! ;) I suspect I'll eventually find I have some kind of skin issue but in the meantime I try to pull discreetly and dispose of the hairs in a thrash bin, for my partner's sanity."
Trichsters,2jovhp,burtnayd,2,Sun Oct 19 14:44:13 2014 UTC,this is such a great response and makes so much sense to me in a way that I've never been able to explain. Thank you.
Trichsters,2jovhp,BlackCatsandTattoos,1 point,Sun Oct 19 20:22:14 2014 UTC,"I'm no scientist, but I think there is an underlying psychological issue that comes with trich. I say this because I started pulling my eyebrows when I was ~12 or 13 years old. Growing up I strived for perfection, and desired approval and praise from my family and friends. Whenever I was anxious due to school or something, I didn't feel like I was achieving perfection at that time because I was so stressed, which lead me to pulling to cope.  As an adult now, I suffer from depression and I think anxiety. Couple that with stress, and I go crazy on my eyebrows because I don't feel good enough and pulling gives that feeling of release."

I just told him the truth straight-up that I pull at them during periods of stress and anxiety.  He and my 3 other friends seemed legitimately interested and understanding, as they asked a few more questions about it, which I answered candidly for them.  They all seemed to be accepting and non-judgmental about it, which was great, and put me at total ease over the next 3 days of camping with them.  It was really nice not to have to try and constantly hide it with eyebrow pencils or worry about what they thought of me.  Interestingly, I don't think I had a single pulling instance the entire 3 day trip, which is unusual for me."

I'm very willing to discuss it at length if necessary and educate/inform. I say it with about as much levity as possible. I notice that people tend to take their cues from me in regards to how to react. If I'm nonchalant or humorous about it, they are too. I truly believe that judgement and bullying come from the fear of the unknown. I've even likened it so sucking a thumb on occasion and pretty much everyone knows someone or are themselves a scab picker so it's easy to branch from other BFRB type behaviours into trich."

Trichsters,2ive05,BadW01fRose,7,Fri Oct 10 17:13:46 2014 UTC,I would request an answer to this question in writing: Is it against policy to wear bandanas when afflicted with a medical condition such as cancer and trichitillomania causing hair loss?

Keep fighting, it's utter crap that you're receiving this kind of pushback regarding your trich. It's a DSM recognised disorder, and their conduct is shameful!  In the meantime, can you wear a wig?

If you're using a headscarf for a medical reason you should be allowed.  It's a recognized disorder and regardless of whether or not they are aware the medical community is.

Trichsters,2iv45x,palerghosts,1 point,Fri Oct 10 15:44:24 2014 UTC,"I don't know the length of your hair, but is there a way to part it differently to hide it? I usually pull from my eyebrows, and use a side part to hide my damage on that side. Maybe a different parting of hair can help?  Could also look into getting fringe? Again don't know what/where it is, but that could take the focus away.  I don't know of ways to make your hair grow faster. Just have heard that massaging your head while shampooing promotes hair growth. Also have heard cold water helps too, but I don't know if these actually work. Also have heard that getting your hair cut does initially cause hair to grow faster, but slows down to a normal growth over time."

I've tried to mess with it style wise to attempt to cover up the damage but nope, you can still tell. It's like, on the side of my head, and my hair is fairly short.

I never had the motivation when I didn't have full lashes but once I got them, I surprised myself with so much self control. It helps me to use my nails to take off mascara sometimes, sorta relieves the impulse without actually pulling (although the occasional one or two do come out). I also obsessively tweeze my brows but I've learned to let them fill in a bit before doing so. Pulling out the random stray hairs is definitely relieving!"

Trichsters,2hvu7z,mytalkinghead,2,Tue Sep 30 13:39:35 2014 UTC,"I read about this somewhere, and I'll link the article when I'm not on mobile. When you pull hairs and the black slimy root is at the end, it's not a root but the pigment to that hair follicle. Pulling that out can permanently damage that hair follicle pigment, so it grows back white (no pigment).  Edit: I found this website talking about it but I'm not sure this is a reputable site or if this is the one I was reading. It says the same thing though:   http://www.dailystrength.org/c/Trichotillomania-Hair-Pulling/recs/1816-hair-regrowth-facts"

So when you pull it out you've permanently damaged the pigmentation of your hair ergo no more color and it grows in white."
Trichsters,2huolc,Melvin8,3,Tue Sep 30 02:30:10 2014 UTC,"Well I can't say exactly, because I pull from my pubic area and my head, but when I shave all of my pubes off, I find myself reaching down there to pull really often, starting to go to pull but remembering, etc. it's very frustrating and makes me just pull more from my head I think."
Trichsters,2huolc,CeciliaLisbon,2,Tue Sep 30 03:49:58 2014 UTC,"For years I pulled almost exclusively from my pubic area, and then this past spring I started pulling an extreme amount from my head as well. Around the same time, I started epilating my pubic area, so there wasn't any hair there to pull. I had started pulling from my head shortly before I started epilating, so they're not necessarily completely related, but I do think not having anything to pull in my pubic area just made the scalp pulling worse.  Now, if I epilated ALL of my hair (not that I ever would; that would be awful and take forever), I don't know how I would compensate. When I shave my head, I think I tend to bite my nails a little more than when my hair is long enough to pull out easily."
Trichsters,2hu47z,Westmang,6,Mon Sep 29 23:16:15 2014 UTC,"I'm glad that that worked for you - but I think your girlfriend had her priorities way out of line. Having to explain to her family that her boyfriend has a BFRD? A little awkward, but not a deal-breaker by any means. It sucks that the stigma against any psychological condition is so strong that she felt it might be worth breaking up rather than, god forbid, talking about it.   I got to tell my family my husband had asthma and an allergy to shellfish. I didn't consider breaking up with him because of either of those."
Trichsters,2hu47z,WonTwoThree,7,Tue Sep 30 04:03:02 2014 UTC,"what happens if she breaks up with you for something else? you'll go right back to it. some people consider trich a form of addiction. if youre an alcoholic and you quit drinking for your girlfriend, your sobriety wont last. same for this. not smart.. you gotta do it for you."
Trichsters,2hu47z,ima_sickfuck,5,Tue Sep 30 04:23:52 2014 UTC,"Trichotillomania is an impulse disorder which includes addiction. If you think about hair pulling as an addiction, her ultimatum makes more sense. Many people, myself included, have been given ultimatums by loved ones to quit smoking, drinking, using drugs, etc., when things have gone out of control. Sometimes you need to be told how your actions affect people you care deeply about before you can be motivated enough to commit to a change. It's how I quit smoking.  Even if you liken trich closer to depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (i.e. a mental illness which he has zero control over) I still don't think what his girlfriend did was wrong. She has the right to decide whether she is able to be with someone who suffers from mental illness. In fact, I think it's extremely important that people are honest with themselves and their partners in regards to what they can tolerate. If she's done everything she can to support him and she is at her wits end it makes sense that she would give him one more chance to commit himself to quitting before walking away. I do agree that her actions were in self-interest but I don't think self-interest is inherently bad. As much as we need to look out for the people we care about, we also need to look out for ourselves.   Personally I think fear is a strong motivating factor for many people with trich. Fear of public embarrassment, fear of being caught or found out, fear of going permanently bald, fear of never having full control, etc. etc. Why is the fear of losing someone important to you any less valid? Of course it's shaky ground in terms of ""what if she leaves"" but life is full of variables and he'll have to deal with that if the situation arises. No treatment plan is infallible.  Do I think ""I don't want to explain to my family that you have trich"" is a great reason to break up with someone? No, I don't. It sounds incredibly immature. But I don't think the overall idea of his personal brand of therapy is wrong or something to be dismissed outright."

I've been pull-free for about 2 months now but even when I'm miserable with horrible eyebrows, my boyfriend is there for me. How dare your girlfriend give you an unreasonable ultimatum. To me, it's like ""Stop having diabetes or I'll dump you."" Trich is not an easy ""I'll just quit forever!"" Even pull free, I still get the urges all the time.   edit: also ""I have to tell my family your problem, so fix it!"" Maybe she should get over her own worries and deal with telling other people. Or not tell them. She's taking all this as if she's the one who's more embarrassed."

I would think not being able to feel the sensation of pulling hairs on my head and not having the feeling of an irritated scalp could help deter pulling."
Trichsters,2hh3b5,throethecourier,3,Thu Sep 25 22:37:22 2014 UTC,"It definitely sounds like trich, but it's only an issue if it's an issue to you. I pulled my pubic hair for years without it really being much of a problem; it only really became a concern in the past year or two as I started to feel like I really NEEDED to pull, and would pull for large chunks of time without being able to stop myself. I didn't seek treatment until this past spring, though, when I started pulling from my head and wound up half-bald. There are all sorts of self-esteem and anxiety issues that come from going half-bald as an 18-year-old girl that were never really a problem when it was just pubic hair.  So I guess my opinion would be that if it doesn't bother you, it's not really a problem. But I'd suggest monitoring it so you can notice if it starts to feel out-of-control or taking up a significant amount of your time to the exclusion of other things."
Trichsters,2hh3b5,Nyxness,2,Fri Sep 26 06:52:58 2014 UTC,"Whether or not it's ""an issue"" is relative, mostly, to how you perceive it. I (M24) have had TTM for 17 years with increasing severity and typically have little to no eyebrows -- despite my optimism and refusal to let it affect important aspects of my life too much, it has absolutely affected every social interaction I've ever had. The only real ""issue"" is the distress resulting from pulling episodes and the anxiety that I experience, despite trying to ignore it, when other people notice. Usually this stress is minor and even subconscious, but I have definitely considered throwing furniture occasionally. These I cannot imagine to be positive stressors, certainly emotionally and perhaps physiologically. Anxiety and impulse control disorders, by the way, are commonly paired, and they definitely don't help solve one another.  I've heard it suggested on several occasions that one might be ""lucky"" to only target the pubic area, but of course this may at some point cause you social distress as well. It is also possible that this learned behavior can migrate to other areas that are more visible in day to day social interactions (which was the case with me).  It isn't too uncommon to have this type of compulsive behavior, but for the sake of avoiding the above it is probably worth addressing it. If you have other anxiety issues, even if minor, you may find that a little research and some effort might improve your quality of life. Despite being unable (yet) to eradicate my pulling (kind of hard to do after almost 20 years of reinforcement), I've found that things like hypnosis, yoga, etc. have reduced my anxiety level and made me happier in general.  Also I don't know of too many people with TTM who feel any real sense of physical pain, or at least it is very minor compared to the odd satisfaction resulting from it (and I'm pretty pain-aversive).  tl;dr, is it ""normal"" to pull out hair? Not really, but it isn't rare especially when minor. Is it an ""issue""? It depends on how you feel, but if you are uncomfortable with this or really anything in your life, it is worth taking the time to address it. The fact that you've found this sub probably means you're willing to do just that."
Trichsters,2hfrwq,not_my_real_name_626,7,Thu Sep 25 15:35:43 2014 UTC,"I'm glad that you realize that shaming her isn't going to be productive. She actually has an enviable advantage- she has a parent that understands what she's doing and why.   You should talk to her. I know she's 7, but 7 year olds can be pretty perceptive. Tell her that you do the same thing and that you wish you had learned not to when you were younger. Consider getting her a fidget- rings or a fun bracelet that she can play with when she feels the urge to pull and explain to her that when she notices that her hands are up near her face that she should try to play with the fidget for as long as possible instead of touching her hair or eyelashes.   Let her know that you're not criticizing her behavior and that it's not her fault, and let her know that you'll never punish her for pulling.   It'll save her a lot of grief in a few years if she knows she has you in her corner."
Trichsters,2hfrwq,OsoBarbilloso,3,Thu Sep 25 16:02:10 2014 UTC,"Thank you.  I'll look for something for her to fidget with.  For the most part, she says she isn't pulling them out but that her long, full eyelashes are ""bothering her"".  Which I understand, I get some hairs stuck together or something sometime.  Mine aren't even that long or full, so it's probably a real deal for her.  But I also think she causes some of that by pulling on them, causing a curl or for them to feel different, which causes her to want to pull it out.  I've never told her not to pull in an intentional shameful way.  Its always been a direction, ""Don't do that"" type of thing.  But I recognize it could be causing shame.  She'll be 8 in December and is really smart, but also has OCD traits (which I share).  So I see this potentially becoming a part of her.   I will be supportive, what else could I be?  But hopefully I can prevent her from fully developing this disorder, or to control it better than me.  Thanks again.  I appreciate it!"

If she starts swimming, or being in a sports team, wait a few months and see what happens. Also, try to remove everything in her life that could be a source of stress/anxiety.  Good luck with all that, I hope she'll be fine!"

This post spoke to me because I was around 7 when I developed my first trich habits. I was hoping to offer some insight, maybe even some advice to help see if you can't aid your daughter in overcoming this.  I started pulling out my eyelashes when I was around that young, but it took up until my teenage years until I could finally overcome the disorder.  I understand from your post that your daughter says she pulls them out because they bother her, but see if there isn't more to that statement. My eyelashes bothered me too, but I realized later on that my high anxiety and stress levels made me some form of hyper aware. I felt like I could feel EVERYTHING. Eyelashes and hair unfortunately, got the short end of the stick and I started pulling them out. Even better if you can discover the cause of her anxiety, whether it be pressure in school, pressure in home, etc. I know as the oldest child my parents had a ton of pressure on me to be the breadwinner (not saying you're doing that to your daughter!) but it went to my head and I felt that I couldn't say no and I couldn't show my face unless I was the best in everything. If she feels that way too, it might be a cause of stress.  Repetition helps, you've mentioned she has OCD-like traits and enjoys collecting things. See if you can't find her an activity, even if it's something as simple as an iPhone/iPod touch game where she does the same thing over and over. If anxiety or stress is her problem, or even if it's the need to have a repetitive activity, then that should help. A game like connecting the dots or in the style of Candy Crush could work well.  Finally, if you can, get her to see a therapist. I know, she's young, but honestly, my therapist helped so much in the long run. Just having someone outside of my family to talk to really made a difference, and she helped figure out my causes of stress and anxiety, as well as my habits that I felt like the trich was fulfilling.   I hope these suggestions help and I wish you the best in treating your daughter's trich. It's not a pretty disorder, but you know that. The best thing to do though is be supportive and work with her through this, not against her."

Trichsters,2h6yiy,suddenly_pants,7,Tue Sep 23 06:51:01 2014 UTC,"OK. Sorry it took a while for me to get back to this. Like I said, my wife has trich, but it is a thing we deal with together.  First of all I had to understand that trich is a compulsive disorder, which means it is NEVER her fault if she pulls. She's not doing it on purpose (not always the case. Some people do pull out of habit as well as out of compulsion, and this is another issue). It sounds like you already don't try to guilt trip her when she pulls which is very important. However, what trich isn't, is an excuse to pull even when she knows she's doing it. She hates the way she looks without hair, so not pulling has to be a priority. It really seems to help her when I can provide extra motivation for her to stop.  The first thing we had to figure out is how I could improve my wife's chances of not pulling. I don't mean telling her to stop futzing with her hair, or forcibly remove her hands when she is hovering, as this always has a negative effect and makes her feel ashamed. Negative emotions like shame or stress exacerbate her trich, so flat out calling her out on it leads to more stress, and less hair (same thing you have witnessed with your girlfriend).  What I like to do is keep an eye out for trich factors, and try to minimize the chances of pulling. We communicate over chat sporadically throughout our day, and I ask her how her day is going. If she is having a stressful day I try to get her to stand up and move around. Go get a drink of water, walk around the block. Anything to get her out of her desk and her hands away from her face. She is ok with this because we have talked about trich as being a thing WE have to try to control, and she appreciates my looking out for her. I just ask her ""Hey, you keeping hydrated? How about you go get a drink of water?"" Or ""Hey hun, feeling tired? Maybe getting up and talking a walk would help get your energy back."" She knows I am trying to keep her from pulling, but my suggesting she move herself away from the dangerous situation seems to motivate her instead of get her down. Obviously this might not work for you guys, but it might be worth a shot.  Another thing I like to do to keep her motivated is goal setting and milestone rewards. At first when she is having trouble not pulling we set small goals like go a day without pulling and I will get you a chocolate after work. A day turns into 5 days. If She can go a week without pulling I get her a massage. After a week she can get a massage every two weeks she doesn't pull. Then its if she can make it to 30 days she gets a small gift I know she wants. I keep the gift a secret to keep her curious. When she is having trouble breaking the 5 day mark, or even staying away for a few hours I send her a little email with a cute picture or gif at noon every day only if she hasn't pulled that day. I keep a list of cute things from /r/aww and other such subreddits to give her every day.  Really all you can do is be available, and let her know in as friendly a way as possible that it is important that she dedicate time to think about trich and try to separate herself from her triggers. Take a breather, work and life will be there in 5 minutes.  When things are really bad I will sometimes ask her to wear really light athletic tape on her finger nails so the tape rubs against her face and she notices when she is pulling (""Do it for me?"" works wonders if she doesn't want to, but we're married and have been together for a while, so careful with this one =P). The idea here is to make it as noticeable to herself that she is pulling. If she is consciously aware she is pulling she has a fighting chance to stop. Can't fight something you don't notice.  Once we get to a better mental state where she doesn't hate the way she looks anymore I ask her to tell me every time she notices herself pulling. I asked her to sends me a chat message or an email every single time she catches herself pulling. I told her I will never ever ever be mad if she pulls, but I will be sad if she notices she's pulled and she doesn't tell me. There is not judgment, no pity, just a team effort. She loves me, and hates making me sad, so even if she is ashamed she will tell me so I don't get sad. I always make sure to thank her for telling me, and thank her for stopping herself from puling even more. I tell her that pulling isn't bad, what's bad is pulling, noticing you're doing it, and just letting it happen anyway. If she tries to break the pattern by stepping away from her desk or something like that I always praise her, even if she pulls more anyway when she comes back. I find this setup helps her keep up the good times and gives her hair some time to grow back.  Basically do whatever you can to find small ways to help her stay motivated. Beating trich is an overwhelming task. You have to break it up into lots and lots of manageable chunks. Keep her spirits high by giving her positive reinforcement for all the little things she does well, and never dwell on the mistakes.  TL;DR: Farmville the shit out of her trich. Help her find really small tasks to motivate herself throughout her day."
Trichsters,2h55vv,gerrsbabe,10,Mon Sep 22 17:18:07 2014 UTC,"It's the only area I pull hair from. I feel as though others cannot see it so it's alright. The area is now so scarred, I've had multiple infections. Sometimes I dig for hours so I can pull out the entire hair follicle. One time it got to the point where I was pulling out fatty chunks of skin from the subcutaneous layer. I have cut down on the pulling a lot, but sometimes the urges are still there.  It's hard to try to cut back a lot, I try to limit myself to only three hairs. Also, trying not to dig for the hairs I can see under the skin.  Leave notes everywhere reminding you not to pull, remove tweezers from the room where you tend to pull the most. Bandages over fingers, etc. Maybe even getting a full wax might help, since you wouldn't have any hair at all to pull. You'd have to go cold turkey in a sense."

I usually twist them round until the hairs in a knot type form and just pull. Of course it hurts, but I know the pain is only temporary so I let it happen. I usually come out with a pretty nice chunk of hair in the end.   Good luck with trying to overcome it, it's difficult. I'd recommend shaving or trimming, that way you can't get rid of so many hairs at once."

Trichsters,2h55vv,cocacolahead,2,Mon Sep 22 22:59:37 2014 UTC,"I pulled pretty exclusively from my pubic area for years, until this past spring when I started pulling from my head again. My head pulling is out of control now, but I have managed to really limit my pubic hair pulling by epilating instead of shaving... It has the same result as pulling in that the hair is pulled out at the root, but instead of sitting for hours pulling my hair and hating it, it takes care of all of it at once and then takes a lot longer to grow back, which has significantly reduced the amount of time I spend pulling my pubic hair and the damage I used to do in digging for ingrown hairs and pulling even after I've just shaved.  Obviously that's not a solution if your goal is to grow your pubic hair, but if you don't mind being hairless, you can't pull hair that isn't there to pull. Waxing would have a similar effect. (I would warn to make sure that you don't just move on to somewhere where you DO have hair... I started pulling from my head shortly before I started epilating, but otherwise I might think that the two are related)."

So, my hair (light brown/red, very fine and straight) is growing back dark and coarse. I learned through research, though, that it just takes a while for the hair to grow back it's normal type. Hurray! So just let it grow out. I've noticed some hairs that have grown out all coarse at the tips from when it was ""recovering.""  Hopefully you'll do a better job than I am right now, because coarse hairs are my weak points. Good luck!   Edit: I have heard that there have been cases where some seriously serial and long-term pullers have patches of hair that will never grow back normally. I'm assuming you're not at that point.

I once ran across a study on infant trichotillomania, and they concluded in every case there was some degree of poor attachment between mother and child. Obviously you can't do too much harm to a child during infancy while being watched by doctors in a psychological study - but little things add up.  However, I wouldn't call that site reputable. I don't think there is ONLY ONE way trich can be treated. Different things are going to work for different people - NAC works for me when I'm not pregnant, but there's no info on usage in pregnant women so I'm stuck at the moment.

I track my symptoms regularly anyway, being screened for autoimmune disease for the past 2 years, we're pretty sure I have something going on. At this point the trich I've always just pushed it aside as a side thing, but after having to have surgery on my arm, and it still consuming me throughout the day whenever stressed, somethings gotta be done directly to address it. Going to give NAC a try."
Trichsters,2gshs7,_LMiller,1 point,Fri Sep 19 00:50:44 2014 UTC,"There was a bit of physical punishment but nothing extremely traumatic. It was mainly mental. Lately I have really been noticing my pulling trances and while pulling, I will start asking myself really tough questions about why I'm doing what I'm doing. For me, the answers I get revolve around never feeling good enough and needing to punish myself, to pick at myself  In other words, to try and take care of myself how I was never taken care of. To not pick myself apart and overanalyze every little flaw.   Holy crap, thank you so much for sharing...are you me just 5 years older? This sounds incredibly exactly like what I'm doing, and questioning my thought processes, I get caught in a self-punishment ""analyze yourself"" loop. I'll frequently be pulling when reading a psychology article, or any trash out there on the internet dealing with interpersonal relationships. I'll immediately put myself ""on the spot"" for these questions and immediately begin pulling without fail.   I don't say this to be vain either but I and many women consider me very attractive...the emotional abuse from my childhood ran very deep.  I also noticed that some users here, as well as the pullfreeatlast.com site mentioned that this seems to be a child and mother issue, but haven't seen mentions of bad father abuse anywhere.  Mom issues story; I would like to simply also mention in light of that insight, my abuse entirely correlates with my mother. My Mother kept me at her brother + his wife's house for early childhood. As a sort of daycare in between formal daycare. I was raped by their 16 year old son and regularly molested, whether my aunt + uncle knew or not I have no idea. I was under their roof so they were responsible for me, and I hold extreme grudges against them too to this day. One day my dad picked me up, and had to take me to the hospital I was bleeding out my ass so bad. Long story short, my mother pretended the whole fucking thing never happened, defended her sick family, and my parents almost split over it. My dad at least made damn sure I never stayed with them again, and has always been the better of my two parents. Mother is a narcissist, and spoiled me growing up (only child). My only real ""triggers"" are hearing her mention her brother or his son, nonchalantly (denying to my face what happened, in a very subtle way), and having to grow up pretending everything was fine with her side of the family really fucked with me. Still does as a grown man. My dad formally told me when I was 21 because he felt I should know, but made me swear to never tell mom that he told me. I appreciate him having the balls to finally tell me, but someday I will confront her, she's an idiot for thinking I just don't remember either. And to end this on a bittersweet note...my cousin/rapist is the reason I believe in karma. None of us really know where he is, except he's just committing random crimes/doing random dumb shit, in and out of jail over the years, and slowly dying of AIDs. I don't seek vengeance mainly because I know this.   I absolutely am in the middle of seeking professional therapy for this, just need to find the right person. Thank you as well for the warm wishes, and thanks so much for the reply, and thanks for sharing+letting me share - I appreciate it beyond what the text can capture. Seriously, thanks so much."

That's not to say this invalidates the theory that trich can be related to childhood abuse.   I started pulling my scalp hair when I was 8 or so, then stopped for a few years before moving on to body hair when I was maybe 13 or 14, and now at age 18 I pull both scalp and body hair, mostly scalp, and I'm more than half-bald now. I was also very anxious as a child (and still am now) and also had some OCD-type symptoms that were worse when I was a kid. I also have a lot of the other emotional/self-esteem/sexual problems that are commonly associated with past child abuse. So I have no idea why that is, but if my mind is intent on acting like I was abused even though I wasn't, then I guess the trich fits into that too."

My hairdresser mentioned the hair loss a few times, but I just laughed it off and quickly changed the subject.

As a hairdresser, and also as someone who suffers from trich, I would NEVER ask about shorter hair patches on a client.

Every person is different, and different things help different people in various ways. Technically, I don't suffer from trich, I suffer from dermatillomania (skin picking). While it's not the exact same thing, they are comparable. Ever since I began smoking pot, my compulsions have been better. I have taught myself to notice the sensations in my body that occur right before I want to pick at my skin. My heart rate increases slightly, I get jittery, and I become hyperfocused on wanting to pick. It has taken me a while to be able to notice these things. Pot has helped me tremendously, if I'm able to get myself to smoke before I pick. It doesn't work every time, but it has helped!"
Trichsters,2gopu6,CheesyRomanceNovel,1 point,Sat Sep 20 17:32:33 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. Everyone deals with things differently. My wife and I have nothing against smoking pot. I do agree that dermatillomania is very much so like trich, or any other compulsion based disorder. I'll pass what you have said onto my wife and see if she's open to it. She's more into edibles but we'll see what happens. Again, thank you for your reply and sharing your method. All feedback helps."
Trichsters,2gopu6,CheesyRomanceNovel,2,Sat Sep 20 19:54:48 2014 UTC,"Glad I could give you my feedback! While edibles can help with anxiety (or make it worse for some people,) I prefer smoking because I can get the pot into my system faster, and help train my brain to focus on something else other than wanting to pick. I use a vaporizer. I'm actually considering getting a pocket vape to help manage my compulsions when I'm not at home. I wish you and your wife the best in dealing with this horrid thing."
Trichsters,2gopu6,Alypius,1 point,Sat Sep 20 19:59:41 2014 UTC,"If I had safe and reliable access to cannabis, I would use it as I have found it significantly helps with my anxiety and sleep... which in turn help with my self confidence and reduces my pulling.  At the moment I try to comb my hair instead of pull or pick.  Or I have my girlfriend comb my hair or play with it.  I also find things to occupy my hands with, like video games and cooking.  I'm not so good at the cleaning part, but I'm sure it would help too... if I did it more consistently.  I am currently looking into using essential oils to act as a deterrant from pulling as well as provide nutrients to damaged hair and skin.  Ihave not tried it yet though.  Best of luck!"

Trichsters,2gmqfv,killedmypassword,1 point,Thu Sep 18 05:20:39 2014 UTC,"For me, it's all about the Villain.  I am usually set off by a single hair. The Villain. I typically identify this culprit via sense of touch (since my main focal area tends to be my face). After my target has been located, I begin to obsess. I will do anything to remove the subject. I would hew the skin from my face if need be. All the while, I'm fighting blind. I'll pull and rip and shred and every time I go back to gently touch the surface of my skin, I can still feel him. My arch nemesis. The one hair that won't play nice.  Pretty soon, my flesh is a barren wasteland of red, puffy wounds where hair used to be.  So to circumvent the hours of misery and self-loathing, I go into the bathroom, use a mirror and tweezers, and cleanly remove the rebel leader. One pluck, one kill.  This doesn't solve the issue, but it does allow me to rest. After the Villain is gone, the battle is over. The rest of the fledgling hairs will do as I command and need not be plucked from the herd. That similar nagging feeling won't go away for some time, of course. I'll keep checking every few minutes to make sure I really got the fucker. But this typically saves me from having an episode to begin with (unless I've already torn apart half my face before I decide to go into the bathroom and get serious), or it at least puts an end to an episode after it has begun. And the satisfaction of knowing that I murdered the opposition, the hair that I blame for setting me off in the first place, enables me to go about my normal life without such a dedicated focus on fucking with my face.  I hope this helps, but as I'm writing it I'm realizing that maybe I'm doing more harm than good. I hope that I didn't just send a dozen people into their bathrooms to pull out every hair that they possibly can..."
Trichsters,2gmqfv,rcoop020,1 point,Tue Sep 23 22:49:34 2014 UTC,"I have a love/hate relationship with tweezers and mirrors. I need to keep tweezers around to groom my eyebrows, because my pulling from my eyebrows is primarily cosmetic, nothing out of the ordinary, but if the parts I pluck start growing back in too much, I become overly aware of them and wind up pulling from my eyebrows in a trichy way rather than a cosmetic way. So I need tweezers to prevent that from going too far.  However, they're also a major tool of destruction for my scalp hair. Even when I've just shaved my head and the hair is too short to possibly pull by hand, I can attack it with tweezers. I frequently notice one specific hair that I NEED to remove, and I know that if I try to go for it by hand I'll wind up pulling all the hair out of the whole area before I get that one, so I figure I'll cause a lot less damage by just getting the one hair with tweezers and being done with it, just like you described. Except that once I'm in front of a mirror with tweezers in my hand, I can't stop. I'll get that one specific hair, and then immediately notice another ""one specific hair"" that I just need to remove. And so on, until a few hours have passed and I have a nice shiny hairless bald patch. I just can't stop it once I start it, but otherwise I'd just be driving myself crazy pulling it out by hand anyways.  I'm frequently absent-mindedly pulling while reading or whatever, which isn't as bad but can easily lead into a full-blown pulling episode where I do nothing else. And tweezers or no, those episodes always have the same effect."

Instead, try to be proud that you managed a period without pulling at all, and try to focus on extending that period. Trich is so hard to beat, you should be so proud of yourself for controlling the urges at all. If you don't mind going to the hairdresser, I always found getting myself a nice new haircut (when I still had hair) really helped when I was feeling awful about the state of my hair.

I know it sucks when you think that maybe you've beat something, only to have it creep back up on you.  This isn't an easy thing to fight and it in no way reflects poorly on you that you lost a battle.    Why?  Because it was only one battle and you won many of them in between.

It's hard, but it's important to pick yourself up and do the best you can, no matter what that might be. But a good place to start is to get to those meetings. They're not as bad as you might think.  And you're not gonna be happy overnight. But being alright? Being alright is also a good place to start.

But it can be so, so helpful if you can manage to make it to even one appointment. It gets easier to seek help once you've taken that first step. And if your pulling is impacting your schoolwork, having your campus counseling center on your side to help you talk to your professors and possibly even arrange academic accommodations could really save both your mental health and your GPA.  I know how difficult it can be, but please keep trying to see somebody about this. Also, if you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me. I'd never suggest chatting with someone on Reddit as an alternative to counseling, but I'd be happy to offer some support as someone who's going through similar issues."

They tend to realize that they made a mistake and back off totally.  I'm in a relatively stress free environment, so I don't pull as much anymore. Also, my hair is long and thick enough to cover any bald spot I may have. People don't notice with me anymore because there's nothing that they can see.

I recently started seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist and for the first time in my life I've been pull free for a week. I've pulled for 18 years... now I still battle with urges and when I'm anxious or tired I feel my fingers trickle back up to my head,  but we're better than trich.

Even if I only pulled one hair, I couldn't write that check mark.  It's such a small thing, but it was rewarding to be able to tick that day off.  I don't know if it works too well, though, since I've probably gone a full year without having a pull-free day.  But when I was actually trying, I went about a month."

Trichsters,2g3voa,SharkRaptor,2,Thu Sep 11 14:50:03 2014 UTC,"Yes, definitely. On previous posts a lot of us have agreed that it started similar to what you're saying; started with pulling random hairs and then it became localized. I started pulling course ones when I was 11 and now it's extremely localized to a specific part of my head.   The first step is to identify why you might be pulling. Is it an anxiety thing? Do you just enjoy the texture?   We are a very understanding and helpful community, I think. Most of us have felt alone and like something is wrong with us for years, until we found this group of people that do the same thing.   I'd you're looking for treating it, NAC is a popular. I personally have never tried it for an extended period, but if you search the sub you'll find tons of info on it.  Good luck!  Edit: also look into getting a spinner ring to keep your hands busy."

The primary purpose for diagnosis is to determine a treatment plan that will help you control your illness and mitigate the desire to pull, as well as give you a good ""google search term"" to aid finding pertinent resources (such as this subreddit!). At the end of the day, whether or not you have a diagnosed mental illness, if you wish to rid yourself of the impulse to pull, we are here to help!  Treatment for trich is pretty new and not as well clinically tested as methods for other disorders. I'd recommend checking out treatment for impulse disorders in general, as well as anxiety treatment which is often linked to pulling. Depending on how severe your symptoms are some methods can be self-administered. For example, mindfulness is something worth reading up about that can help reduce impulses and make you feel more in control when the impulse does strike."

The psychiatrist attempted many different drug treatments but honestly none of them really helped the trich. Treatment really is way more involved than just what a tiny pill can fix. From my experience and what I've heard from many others it ends up being a heavy amount of work at self awareness and behavioral control which a psychologist would be just as good at, if not more experienced with."

Trichsters,2frj8n,fuckedsleep,2,Mon Sep 8 01:58:34 2014 UTC,"It is listed as an issue that can arise due to trichotillomania. I was thinking trichophagia would get it's own entry in the DSM, but I guess one must pull their hair first in order to consume it, which makes sense why it's only listed under trich."
Trichsters,2frj8n,fingerpies,5,Mon Sep 8 02:38:25 2014 UTC,"This sounds pretty damn accurate to me!   I'm not a fan of lumping trich with OCD, but that is what it is.   I'm not really sure how they would classify an attempt to stop though. Is me saying ""I'm never going to pull my hair again."" an attempt? Is me stopping from pulling out a hair at the last second decreasing my behavior?   I feel like they were trying to explain the compulsive aspect but did it in a weird way."
Trichsters,2frj8n,Nyxness,2,Mon Sep 8 02:49:59 2014 UTC,"I think they meant, as is the case in many medical conditions, that it causes people distress. Ex: if I'm distressed by pulling out my eyelashes (ppl notice, it hurts, makes me self-conscious), then I'm probably going to want to stop, try to stop, or make various attempts to prevent the behavior from occurring again. Where, if I'm ok with pulling out my leg hair because I don't like leg hair, then I'm not going to be distressed and want to stop doing it. True?"
Trichsters,2frj8n,gillyboatbruff,1 point,Mon Sep 8 03:04:38 2014 UTC,"I think it's more about the lack of control... Like, if you've tried to stop pulling your hair, but continue to pull it, that implies you have no control over it. Whereas if you can just successfully decide to stop without a problem, that's not trichotillomania because you have control over it. Or if you never try to stop at all, that implies that it isn't causing significant distress."
Trichsters,2foh08,tway36,6,Sun Sep 7 00:17:28 2014 UTC,"I have never looked into hair transplants, mostly because I pull from eyelashes and eyebrows only, but my immediate thought is that you might want to put the brakes on going through an expensive (and dubiously effective) procedure until you've consistently broken your pulling habit. You don't want to undo your investment."
Trichsters,2foh08,edle67b,1 point,Sun Sep 7 11:51:25 2014 UTC,"Don't do anything drastic! When you stop pulling, your patches will grow back. Mine have - twice - just give it a while. After 8 months without pulling, I had about 6 inches of hair, and after a year of regrowth it was down to my shoulders in line with the rest of my hair. You probably don't have hair as long as mine, so it'll come back quicker, just have patience :)"

I am not sure what causes it, but would love to figure out how to fix it cause then maybe I would stop pulling.  I first noticed it on my chin when I was looking in the mirror and saw something weird on the hair. Looked closer and saw one hair with 3 pieces at the end. Looked like it was more delaminated over breakage so I pulled it out and pulled it apart. When I feel through my goatee I know it's one of those just by how thick and feel of it. Feels like a plastic paint brush bristle and I yank it out right then and there. Put it in my mouth and grind on it with my front teeth and little to no pressure. The saliva would help it separate more enough to where I would just bite down on it and grind it more.   I hate myself"

But when I'm alone in my room working all night, because everybody else sleeps at normal times, it's when I'm most likely to pull.  Even on the rare occasion where I do get enough sleep at night, though, I still feel groggy during the day. It's as if I'm actually nocturnal. I think it's called Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome."

As far as hands down the pants, say you had to rearrange. All women know men have to rearrange their stuff like women have to rearrange their breasts sometimes. It's a simple explanation that could make you seem less pervertrd and more socially acceptable, even in public. You can't help having things fall out of line!"

Trichsters,2eckgz,fuuuuuuuckk,5,Sat Aug 23 06:45:59 2014 UTC,"A genetic predisposition can be present in individuals that suffer from mental disorders. There was a study that examined families that had two or more members with trichotillomania, and they discovered two mutations in a gene present in the relatives that had trich, but not those that didn't. However, many trichsters don't have these two mutations.  For what it's worth, my brother and I both have trichotillomania. I discovered that years after I started pulling because for some odd reason beyond my human comprehension, my family decided to hide that from me and instead shamed me and told me I was the only person in the world who had trich when they knew I wasn't. But I digress.   You're not alone in this. What your mom has could be dermatillomnia, a skin picking disorder. Some trichsters are skin pickers as well.  Your body is releasing endorphins in response to the pain you feel when you tear out your hair, and that gives you a feeling of relief and euphoria. That's why you can't stop pulling. You get crazy urges to pull out your hair, and just like a mosquito bite, you can't help but scratch it, but once you scratch it, you can't stop doing that because scratching offers a temporary feeling of relief.  Learn as much as you can about trich. Knowledge is power. Get treatment, but also be mindful of that. My doctor told me to wear a rubber band around my wrist and snap it every time I pull. That might work for some, but it was counter-productive and just made me hate myself even more and reinforced the idea that I was doing something bad and deserved punishment. Observe your behavior, try to understand what triggers your pulling so you'd avoid it. I used to keep a journal of what happened before I pulled, how I was feeling and how many hairs I pulled. I started to see a repetitive pattern eventually. Keep your hands busy, get a stress ball or find anything to distract your hands with, shave your facial hair if you must, eat healthy, but most importantly, love and accept yourself the way you are. Trich doesn't define who you are.  Hang in there. :)"

I would check out /r/CompulsiveSkinPicking for some more advice if you also scratch/pick blemishes and pimples (and scratch/squeeze ingrown and infected hairs).   Keep powering on. Now you know that it exists (rather than an odd quirk with yourself) you can read advice and talk about your feelings with strangers on the Internet.   Firstly I would suggest getting a diary to keep notes about how you feel and take some photos for comparison at a later date. You might feel bad at a point of time,  but seeing that you have improved may be enough to help you along."

I will probably seek counseling at some point as well."
Trichsters,2dky40,commanderjarak,3,Fri Aug 15 00:01:47 2014 UTC,"Possible trigger warnings in pictures.  I'm right there with you man. The wiry outliers, the uneven, out-of-place hairs, the split ends. I have a beard which I constantly pick and and I cannot stand it. I like how I look with a beard, but I have to take it off every time I notice bald and thinned patches forming. I just shaved this weekend actually. I keep thinking that I'll curb the habit when I have no facial hair, but as soon as it's long enough to grab, I'm right back at it.   I found a therapist who specializes in compulsive behavior, i.e. skin picking, hair pulling, nail-biting, etc. I located her through Trich.org. She suggested I keep a log of when, where, why and how many I pull. I haven't been good about that, but I'm determined to start using it once my hair starts growing back. Recognizing the conditions, environment and feelings surrounding when you pull your hair can make you more conscious of your actions. Hair pulling is pretty mindless, no? I can recall many times where I think I've just been stroking my chin, pulling a stray hair or two out, and then looking down and seeing this.   Two other things she suggested are taping my fingertips with medical tape. It makes it difficult to grip the hair, and honestly I really enjoy the texture of it! I wrap my thumb, index, and middle fingers, and then spend most of my time just rubbing my fingers together. She also suggested I try N-Acetyl Cysteine, an amino acid supplement that you can find in any vitamin store. Read more about it here.   Just do your best to be open with your doctor and ask if he/she can refer you to a psychiatrist or a therapist who deals with compulsive behavior management, or do like I did and seek one out yourself.   I love rocking a beard so of course I hate myself for systematically tearing it apart, but step by step I'm managing to learn new methods to reign this behavior in, as well as reach out to whatever resources I can access. I wish you all the best!"
Trichsters,2dky40,Aldairion,2,Fri Aug 15 00:26:56 2014 UTC,Well I'm learning so much today. I have spent so many hours of my life going through my beard. I didn't know a picture of a split end could get an audible reaction out of me. Thank you for sharing with me.  I'm living in a new area with no money and no job. I applied for state aid when I couldn't think of any other way but they denied me. I've found a free clinic that has been helping me with other issues/symptoms. I will bring this up at my next appointment. Although this sucks to have...I am so happy today to find out about it. At least now I know.
Trichsters,2dky40,Aldairion,3,Fri Aug 15 00:41:34 2014 UTC,"At least try to do the log, and maybe pick up some NAC and see how it works for you. You won't stop pulling overnight, and it might take a while with a consistent dosage before you start noticing any effects. I've barely gone through a third of my bottle so far.   For your log, keep a section for where you are, what you're doing, what time it is, your thoughts and feelings at the time, and how many hairs you've pulled. Also try to give an answer to why you're pulling, even if you don't have an answer...just say you don't know. At least you're aware that you're doing it.   It's certainly refreshing to have people to identify with. I'm glad I could help somehow. Again, all the best!"
Trichsters,2dky40,coletastrophie,2,Fri Aug 15 00:48:13 2014 UTC,"I have the same issue, I love my beard and feel I look like an infant without it. I found that if I do maintenance on it that it helped out a ton.  Tea tree oil, coconut oil, argon oil. Put in in a shaving scuttle and use a brush to put the oil in. It will help keep the hair healthy and prevent split ends.   It also made my fingers a bit greasy when I went to pull. Made it harder to get to the hairs, and was kind of irritating to have to wash my hands every time I touched my beard.  Good luck!"
Trichsters,2dhrie,lovinglogs,7,Thu Aug 14 00:50:35 2014 UTC,Yup! Welcome to the club nobody wants to be a part of!
Trichsters,2dhrie,Oreosmooshy,3,Thu Aug 14 15:20:33 2014 UTC,"That's pretty much me. I always pull from the same few concentrated areas on my scalp. It used to be a quarter sized area but it's branched out a bit over the years. But yeah. Pulling until the skin is exposed, then scratching and clawing at the skin, causing scabs, picking the scabs.... And yes, the root pieces are always the most satisfying. I've developed the urge to ""swipe"" it on my lips.   Congratulations on finding a name for what you have and a place to talk about it, but I'm very sorry you have to deal with this too."
Trichsters,2dhrie,lurrz,3,Thu Aug 14 12:26:03 2014 UTC,"Yes, welcome.   It can be very hard to resist the urge to pull/pick/scrutinize. I continue to struggle to this day even though I have made good progress. It's like the desire never completely goes away, it's something that must be constantly managed."
Trichsters,2dhrie,kuiperbelle,2,Thu Aug 14 02:11:30 2014 UTC,I would say it lines up well with my understanding of trich. It also sounds like dermatillomania (check out /r/CompulsiveSkinPicking) thrown in.
Trichsters,2dhrie,codhopper,2,Thu Aug 14 05:50:08 2014 UTC,"Yes, this is similar to what I experience. I love to feel the root pieces in my hand."

Trichsters,2dh3lt,cocacolahead,2,Wed Aug 13 21:59:53 2014 UTC,"HAVEN'T PULLED TODAY! Yesterday was great! I shaved my head again so it was nice and smooth which meant I couldn't pull, and my therapist left me feeling very optimistic so I also got a lot of work done! Ended the day with some fun sexy activities. ;) Now I feel the day old stubble coming back, so shaving tomorrow morning!   Oh oh and I also gave my tweezers to my boyfriend to keep, so I can't use those anymore! Hurrah. Been applying my hair lotion every night, as well as taking my prozac. I also have vitamins needed for hair regrowth that I need to take that I've been avoiding because it scared me for some reason (I guess fear that they would never work).   New goal - no pulling by Sunday! I can do this!!"

CSS is not the same in every browser or media type (tablet, phone, PC, etc) which makes it challenging to get consistency at times. Currently in Chrome, the subreddit looks a tad busted, in the header specifically.   Personally I find the font-face you chose difficult to read. I'd prefer Calibri or some other sans-serif font."

Trichsters,2d7mbq,KittenImmaculate,1 point,Mon Aug 11 16:59:59 2014 UTC,CSS has gotten pretty complex over the years but it's still a valuable design tool. Don't give up. Learn some simple HTML and then make a stylesheet for it. You can do some pretty impressive things with HTML5 and CSS3.
Trichsters,2d628c,tell_me_im_funny,6,Sun Aug 10 19:20:22 2014 UTC,"I don't do it consciously, it's definitely in response to stress and anxiety.   yeah, probably trich. I'd make a conscious effort to quit while you're ahead. get a stress ball or spinner ring."

Trichsters,2d4966,TrimmTheGreat,3,Sun Aug 10 02:46:14 2014 UTC,I use little rubdber finger covers that people use for counting money at banks. It makes it difficult to pull.
Trichsters,2d4966,abradolph,2,Sun Aug 10 04:39:57 2014 UTC,"I like the super glue idea,  but it isn't overly practical if you need to type with both hands and use the mouse frequently.   I would suggest a more permanent fidget toy,  like a bucky cube of magnets or a spinning ring. I would also suggest writing in a diary when you pull,  what you pull and how you feel at the time. For example:  11:35am feeling hungry,  network is slow again,  just got out of a morning teleconference and I've pulled a few hairs from near my right ear.   You may notice patterns in what is causing your pulling. If you can adjust to avoid these things then that is your best bet. If you can't change it (for example the teleconference is always guff and a total waste of time) then learn to accept it.   Try out smiling minds for your phone. It might seem silly to begin with,  but soon you'll have a few exercises to run through if you are feeling bad."
Trichsters,2d4966,codhopper,1 point,Sun Aug 10 12:42:52 2014 UTC,"this is my main issue too, because things get so stressful at work I always manage to start pulling. I've started snapping rubber bands on my wrist and that has helped a little. Maybe breathing exercises?"

I spend that time reading, on reddit, doing crossword puzzles, etc.   I find that during periods of critical thinking as well as times of boredom I pull the most. Today I am wearing a head scarf that fully covers my head but also looks super cute.  I am going to attempt to wear the head covering for the entire shift and see how it goes. I am concerned that I might go insane, rip the scarf off and go to town on my hair, but for now it seems to be 1) reminding me that i am trying not to pull and 2) keeping me from grabbing a hair when my hand goes to my scalp. Good luck to you (and to me..)"

Trichsters,2czuo7,mandino788,2,Fri Aug 8 17:14:26 2014 UTC,I used a spinner ring for about a month or too and it did help a lot. It helped when I was stressed because I used to just immediately reach up to my hair and twist it but I forced myself to change the habit and play with the ring. I stopped using it when I stopped forcing myself to stop touching my hair so really I should get back into it and wear it more. It was an excellent investment and I got compliments on it too.
Trichsters,2czuo7,cptrafiki,2,Fri Aug 8 19:38:56 2014 UTC,"No, but I think the problem is with me rather than the ring."
Trichsters,2czuo7,Oreosmooshy,1 point,Sat Aug 9 23:49:21 2014 UTC,"Yes! I have one that's a bit too big for me, so I only use it at home, but when I'm reading or using the computer it is a life (hair?) saver. I still don't always remember to use it, but when I do it is a huge help with pulling urges. I put it on my index finger and spin it with my thumb."
Trichsters,2czuo7,allifrack,1 point,Fri Aug 8 21:49:41 2014 UTC,"I've had a spinner ring for 2 weeks and it's been great. Every time it get the urge to pull, I spin it a few times, hoping to condition myself to do it automatically.   I bought mine from amazon for like $5. It's a really nice design that goes well with my other jewellery as well."

Trichsters,2czuo7,Alypius,2,Sat Aug 9 01:52:30 2014 UTC,"Usually a ring that you wear with a later that rotates around it that you can spin with your finger, or a ring with a rotating bead. They're used to distract your hands."
Trichsters,2cxbi4,MelissaChops,1 point,Thu Aug 7 22:10:51 2014 UTC,"Hey! I recovered without medication nor therapy. And I really worked for it, it didn't 'just happened'.  I really need to go to sleep right now, so I'm just going to explain very quickly what I did. If you have questions / want me to explain more, don't hesitate.   TTM is partly due to stress / anxiety. I decided to go to the gym twice a week, in ordre to evacuate the stress and be less tensed. Obviously, you can find another way to relax, the one that will be the most efficient for you. TTM is often due to inner personal issues, it is a way for us to express negative feelings. So TTM is the consequence of previous events. I say 'events', but I don't mean something that happened at one point in time, rather a long process that we didn't acknowledge, but that deeply hurt us. TTM is our way to exteriorise it. In my case, it took a lot of introspection to understand what was happening in my life when I started pulling. It was mentaly painful to remember this period of my life, to understand how I was treated and how it led to the self-depreciation I had when I still had TTM. Don't hate yourself for having it... You are absolutely not to blame. TTM doesn't heal fast / easily. At the moment you begin evacuating the anxiety and trying to understand why you started having TTM, you have done a great step, but not the final one. It can take weeks or months to recover. At the begining, I did felt better, but I kept pulling. It eventually stopped.   I had TTM from when I was 13 until past november (so during 7 years). I've been TTM-free for 9 months... Again, do not hesitate to ask me any question! I hope I can help!"

Trichsters,2cxbi4,RedheadBadassOctopus,1 point,Mon Aug 11 03:02:41 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but in some cases, months. It's important not to think that you'll never make it, or to think of ways to replace your trichotillomania with something else (e.g.: getting a relaxation ball, putting a beanie over your head so that you can't access your hair).  I said months because I personally spent years trying to do the aforementioned things, and not knowing how to recover. Was just not working, and not really helping. And when I started with the right methods, it only took me two months."

Trichsters,2cxbi4,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Mon Aug 11 15:36:21 2014 UTC,"If you want my honest opinion, I think that trich is something that some, if not most people have their whole lives. I had it when I was 10, then stopped for a while. Then I got it again at 17, stopped again for a whole year. I got it again at 18 and am fighting it currently. It's classified as an Impulse Control Disorder, so I guess that technically it's seen as something that can go away or be relieved, but I think differently. Everyone I've heard of with trich goes into remission and then under stress or just randomly starts pulling again.  That being said, I think one major goal that a trichster should have before they even start thinking about becoming ""pull free"" is to detatch the disorder from how they value themselves as a person. This means that a girl who pulls her hair or eyelashes doesn't think of herself as ugly because her hair is different. A man who pulls doesn't hate himself for lacking the self control to stop pulling at his face or brows. A person should not think less of their goals/actions/successes just because they have one area of their life that is somewhat out of their control. Trich is a medical condition, not a bad personality trait.   Anyways, this is just what I've been thinking up lately as my trich comes back worse just before I leave for Uni. I hope that when I'm sitting alone in my dorm, tearing out clump after clump that I don't develop the self hate I've had for myself in the past."

What I have found that helps was getting a stress ball or fidget toy and messing with that instead, but do slip up from time to time. I understand how hard it is to break the habit. Don't get discouraged or bring yourself down because of it! Just try to do better each day and resist the urge or replace it with another activity."

Trichsters,2cjoxm,spottedcat7,2,Mon Aug 4 04:36:17 2014 UTC,"So, I'm the opposite. I was on Zoloft, and then Celexa, and I heard about Clom for OCD & Trich.   I tried it... and it was literally the most anxiety-inducing thing I have ever experienced. I'd take it at night and it would knock me out, no problem-- but then it made me AFRAID to do ANYTHING until about 4pm.   Psych meds! Such fun!!  your mileage may vary, I am sure you and your doctor can decide if you're liking it or not :)"
Trichsters,2cjoxm,mec05160,2,Mon Aug 4 06:12:37 2014 UTC,I'm not on the med but just thought I I'd share that I'm on prozac which really helps with obsessive thoughts and pulling as well as gabapentin which I was just prescribed for anxiety. Gabapentin works by repairing overactive gaba receptors and for me it has been a miracle drug. It has helped so much. I still twirl a lot but you should see my tufts!

Trichsters,2ce45u,EmoKarot,1 point,Sat Aug 2 02:13:20 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry you had a nasty spell. I had one as well last week with my eyelashes. I've been doing so well, but I found out a friend of mine is in hospice care, and it was like I lost all control of my left hand. I use an eyebrow powder/wax when I have bald spots on my brows. It works as nicely as it can. I've never been good at putting false lashes on, so I don't even bother with that anymore. I've never pulled from my head, but I'm afraid someday I might.  Any medication takes time to build up in your system before it can start to work. NAC won't cure you of Trich after taking it a couple weeks (if ever). Definitely keep on the NAC and give it time. This is just a bump in the long road to recovery."

Does one day of accidentally skipping it after taking it every day for weeks put me back at square one?  The pulling from the head was my last straw. I've had trich since I was 9-10 years old and I'm 25 now and only in the last year have I started pulling from my head. I've got a few bald spots that I can cover up decently well, but it's super upsetting. I shall hope for you that it never gets to that! I don't pull at my eyelashes as much as I used to, but I've never tried penciling on my eyebrows before. I can add it to my makeup routine, but it would be very sudden EYEBROWS and I feel like if I did that I'd have to answer a lot of questions....."
Trichsters,2ce45u,raviax,1 point,Sun Aug 3 20:47:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I figure sudden eye brows would... raise some eyebrows...  yyYYYYEEEEEAAAAAAAHH!  Anyway, I really don't think missing 1 day would set you back to square one. Missing a week or more may be a different story though. One of these days I'll give it a try. I just need to double check with my pharmacist and doctors to make sure it's ok with the other drugs...er, I mean, medications I'm on."
Trichsters,2ce45u,raviax,1 point,Sun Aug 3 21:13:09 2014 UTC,"Hahaha well played!

I figure I'll take half of what I normally do when I get home from work and then start right back up again tomorrow. I'm seeing a psychiatrist at the end of the month for the first time (been putting it off way too long) so if I can tell him if NAC does or doesn't have an effect, I think that would be helpful. By the 28th, I should have had it in my system long enough to have decent feel for it, yeah?"

If the psych puts you on any meds, let me know how they work for you in regards to the pulling. I've been on far too many to remember, but haven't had any luck (with the pulling that is)."
Trichsters,2ce45u,thewronggiants,2,Sun Aug 3 22:09:50 2014 UTC,"I tried meds once like 8 years ago, but at the ripe age of 16 I wasn't ready to really put myself into trying them, so I didn't stay on them too long and just said ""they hadn't helped."" So now that I'm ready, I'm hoping something will help, even just a little. I've got some kind of depression, too, so hopefully something somewhere will give! I'll for sure let you know if/how well anything helps, though!"

Trichsters,2cb6fk,DesMordeaux,3,Fri Aug 1 05:04:24 2014 UTC,"That is a tough question. I am extremely sensitive about people noticing and bringing it up. I usually brush them away with a statement such as ""it's personal"" or ""I don't like to talk about it.""  That being said, I once was at a house party and a girl I had met that night approached me and asked me about it. I gave her the usual ""I don't want to talk about it"" and she apologized and said that she only asked because she thought she knew why because she did the same thing too. I was shocked because this was a few years ago and I never knew anyone else with trich. We ended up talking the whole night, it was just this instant connection I had never had with anyone else before. I had told a few friends about what was going on, but I know none of them truly understood what it was like without being in my shoes.  I only saw her a few times after that. She unfortunately passed away about a year and a half ago in a car accident. Despite only meeting a few times, it was quite hard because I lost that person I had such a unique connection with.  I digress... To sum up what I am trying to say, I think you should mention it to her. It could be really nice for her to have someone to talk to who understands exactly what it is like. And honestly, she might not even know she is not the only one. The girl I met had no idea there was a name for what we were both doing.   EDIT: I forgot to mention, I agree with the other commenter who said do it in a personal setting, not at work, if you do bring it up. I was very taken aback when she first asked me since it was in a somewhat public situation."
Trichsters,2cb6fk,veronicamars82,2,Fri Aug 1 18:47:36 2014 UTC,"Tough issue. I saw a friend playing with his eyebrows once and then noticed some empty patches. Hard to see because he's blond. My reaction was strictly internal like ""huh wonder if he has trich."" I don't think bringing it up is a good idea. I fill in my brows and if someone noticed and commented I'd be upset they could tell. Not everyone wants to talk about it. Your only route would be to mention you have trich and let her say ""oh really me too."""

It took me awhile to decide if I should bring it up to her bc I don't pull very often around new people. But one day she was pulling and I told her I have it and she was super excited because neither of us have met someone irl with trich. It's tricky because it could be triggering but also expressing that you struggle regardless of location or degree of the pulling could be bonding"

They smelled like sulfur/dirt and tasted about the same. On several occasions I actually threw up after taking them, solely because of the taste and texture.   As for the pulling, absolutely no effect. I kept going up on dosage to see if it would help, but it never did. Just a whole lotta nasty.  Additionally, the supplement  was heralded as the panacea for all addictions-- I kept seeing articles about meth addicts who reached full recovery with it-- so that made me feel really shitty when it didn't work for me."

It took two full weeks for me to notice a difference. At that time the urge to pull was dramatically decreased! I am currently 4 months pull free! I do still find my hands in my hair too often and I cut split ends some days, but I am not pulling at all! After 25 years of pulling, NAC has been the most successful!"

Trichsters,2cadhg,Pinkie_Plague,3,Sat Aug 2 18:30:12 2014 UTC,"I took it for awhile and it worked great. I think it took a few days to a week to notice that I wasn't really pulling much of anything, maybe like 3 hairs tops (which was a great improvement from how it usually was). It felt like it was easier to stop myself from continuing to pull when I took NAC. It did help a lot but it gave me excruciating heartburn so I had to stop taking it. This post inspired me to start taking it again because my pulling has gotten really bad as of lately with losing my job.   I think the more you take it and have it accumulate in your system that it would help. Maybe try taking the largest dose around whatever time of day your pulling is the worst? Mine is usually in the morning so I would try to take the largest dose in the morning. It sucks since this is all somewhat experimental that there aren't normal guidelines for dosing but I've read that it's mostly a 1200-2400mg range. I tried taking 2 pills in the morning, 1 at lunch and then 1 at dinner for a total of 2000mg.  I wish you luck and I hope it helps you with your pulling. You're in a good and judgement free zone here. Stay strong <3"
Trichsters,2cadhg,otonik,2,Fri Aug 1 03:31:10 2014 UTC,"Thanks :)   I am in the middle of a particular bad episode, literally right now at this moment as I type there are eyelashes everywhere. And this is one week and two days into taking 3 grams of NAC daily, religiously. I wonder if this last week would have been worse without NAC, or if NAC is somehow making things worse, or if it hasn't even kicked in yet at all.  I am also experiencing the heartburn, but I am sort of used to it, I used to be overweight and have heartburn all day, and I just sort of learned to ignore it. Not to mention the fact that in my current situation I'd take physical pain over emotional pain easy."
Trichsters,2cadhg,Aldairion,1 point,Fri Aug 1 04:50:39 2014 UTC,":( Try putting a hot rag on your eyes, sometimes that would help me. The tricky thing with NAC is that you kind of have to figure out how much to take. I don't know too much about NAC to be able to give advice but I think the trials lasted over 9 weeks so I say hang in there. I'm sorry to hear about your eyelashes, it's a struggle every day. :( There would be times where I had to try to restrain my hands and cover them up or blindfold myself because it got so bad :/ What kind of things do you do to cope with it or redirect your tension?  Lately mine has gotten really bad that I have a spot on my head towards the front. I can't really cover it up with my hair but I wear wigs every day so it's manageable. I just try to keep things covered up for the most part.  Stay strong, I know you can do it. Just remember that you aren't alone. No matter how bad you feel, you're not alone in this. We're all here for you."
Trichsters,2cadhg,KraftyPants,2,Fri Aug 1 05:26:59 2014 UTC,1200 mg for 6 months now and completely stopped pulling even when I'm stressed/anxious. 1 pill in the morning on an empty stomach and 1 at 6pm. Good luck trichsters

Try covering the bumps in Amlactin since it sort of stings if you pop the bump, since the lotion has salicylic acid, you aren't as likely to pop them! Also wear long sleeves shirts and long pants when you feel the urge to pop them.  Amlactin and coconut oil have been said to help to reduce KP, if there aren't bumps there's nothing to pop."

They don't really need to know what your condition is--it's really none of their business. That's how I found one Trich-friendly lady who cut hair right in her salon attached to her house.  I understand how you feel though, and I hope you can find someone who you can work with. Hell, when I stopped pulling and my hair came back in full force, I still didn't enjoy my time getting my hair done with this particular hairdresser. My hair is thick and curly. The whole time I was just hearing her moan about how thick my hair was... I WAS going to give her a good tip since I know my hair is crazy, but I quickly changed my mind.  Good luck! I'm trying to go hunting for a new hair place myself. The last time someone has touched my hair was probably back in November/December."

My patches are bad- completely bald on top and very very thin on each side.  Daily I wear a scarf to cover my patches.  But I wanted a REAL hair cut!  I have worn wigs before and that allowed some re-growth so I was able to get a real hair cut/ style before my wedding- 8 years ago!    I wanted a real hair cut.  I wanted to feel pretty (or at least like a professional!) I know a hair dresser and for years I have agonized over just asking her about trichotillomania and if she could do anything with my hair.  Finally one day I couldn't stand it and I called her.  I explained over the phone and she was so nice, understanding and compassionate.  I asked if she had a private room so I wasn't out in the open for other patrons to see.  She even accommodated me by doing it later in the evening when they are slow.  She was very patient and sensitive to my situation.  When I took the scarf off and revealed what she would have to work with, she just patiently and professionally took a look and got to work.  My stomach was in knots.  No one had touched my hair in YEARS!! I felt so vulnerable!  But it was over and I felt AMAZING! I still have to wear the scarf (which does limit the style) and I probably will until I win my battle with trich.  But you can do it.  Ask friends for recommendations of hair dressers.  If your friends know about your pulling, you can even ask them for recommendations.  I went with my sister a few times and almost asked the hairdresser many times about my situation.  Maybe you can go with a friend when she gets her hair done just to see if you would be comfortable with that hairdresser working with you. You can go to www.trich.org to find a hairdresser in your area.  If you're not comfortable with a bigger salon, maybe a smaller hairdresser.    There is someone out there who will be professional and kind to you, and not treat you horribly! I hope you find that person! Best of luck to you!!!!"

I'll keep looking, thankyou <3"
Trichsters,2c1fsn,vanillasky22,2,Tue Jul 29 23:23:48 2014 UTC,"I did ok with the wigs. I buzzed all my hair off, got a wig and started over.  However, once I stopped wearing the wig, I pulled again.  Sometimes I felt really self conscious with the wig...Like I thought everyone could tell.  Which is odd, because I wear a scarf every day and obviously people can tell! It was nice for job interviews/ weddings/ etc where I didn't want to wear a scarf.  But they get hot and itchy, so I always felt uncomfortable.  And they are expensive.  But they definitely helped with re-growth.  Unfortunately, my success didn't last long.   I get scarves from a website www.garlandsofgrace.com. They are actually head coverings for religious women, but their designs are really cute, feminine and flattering. This covers my patches and prevents some pulling."

Trichsters,2bk3su,raviax,1 point,Thu Jul 24 15:38:55 2014 UTC,"Wow. You've inspired me! One of my excuses for continuing to pull was that it would take seemingly forever for the hair to grow back, if it did at all. You have proved me and my impatience wrong!"
Trichsters,2bknvh,Renneth,2,Thu Jul 24 06:37:16 2014 UTC,"I think it adds an interesting twist to Picard. If he's pulling because of stress, to the extent that he's shaved it all off (or pulled it all out), then that tells you how tough his job is. It also gives us a very honorable example of a sufferer who is much beloved"
Trichsters,2bknvh,abradolph,2,Thu Jul 24 13:46:48 2014 UTC,I've been to the point where I shaved my head because I was so pissed about my trich
Trichsters,2bl1h3,willpowerIHAVEIT,2,Thu Jul 24 10:46:35 2014 UTC,"The only way you could get a hairball is if you're eating your hair. Even then, it'd have to be pretty large to get stuck in your digestive system. Since you stopped a long time ago, any possible hairballs you might have had would have been passed a long while ago."
Trichsters,2bl1h3,OneEyedOneHorned,1 point,Fri Jul 25 00:12:41 2014 UTC,"I had a bezoar and nearly died from it. I take them very seriously as such.  I pulled for about 8 years before I needed the surgery. I recently had another upper GI exam to make sure everything was okay since it had been 8+ years since the first surgery. I was in the clear!  If you DO have a bezoar that's of serious concern or threat, you're going to have a very very small appetite, have a hard time keeping food down, and probably not be able to comfortably lay on your stomach. Oftentimes you'll pass hair normally through the digestive system but if you eat TOO much, it will definitely get stuck.   I would say you're probably okay. Since you've stopped, any bezoar wouldn't have had enough ""food"" (if you will) to grow anymore and if it had been a problem, you would've known before now. If you're still worried, see if you can get an upper GI or talk to your regular physician. Mine was actually discovered when they were doing abdomen feels and thought I had hepatitis from an enlarged liver. Nope! Just a hairball. Have them feel around, explain the situation. They might feel something slightly off but not know that it could actually be an issue. If they feel anything a little too large, they'd be able to order the GI scan.  Good luck!"
Trichsters,2binrx,throwawaypicking,1 point,Wed Jul 23 18:26:25 2014 UTC,"That's similar to how my cowlick on my right forehead feels. The hairs are shorter and feel coarse or harder. I twirl and pull them until they knot and when they knot I feel the absolute NEED to fix the knot. Which 99% of the time means pulling those hairs off my head. It feels better, but it leads me being pissed at myself."

Trichsters,2bgwqx,Tiph8uh5knee,7,Wed Jul 23 05:17:18 2014 UTC,"This sounds a lot like Trich to me - I pull my lashes and brows and I definitely start pulling because hairs feel 'wrong' - too thick, or out of place. At the time I don't think I'm doing it to relieve stress, but in retrospect I often pull during stressful times - keeping a record might help you be more aware of that.  Maybe getting a solid trim would help you re-set and not think the hairs are so damaged?"
Trichsters,2bgwqx,WonTwoThree,3,Wed Jul 23 07:10:28 2014 UTC,"It certainly sounds like trich.  I pull hairs that feel wirey and ""wrong.""  I recommend first maybe getting a hair cut and see if that helps you with the texture.  If you keep noticing the behaviors, mention it to your doctor.  Visit the Trichotillomania Learning Center at (http://www.trich.org).  Get some solid information you can take to your doctor so you can get it under control while it's still early.  He/she might be able to refer you to a clinician that can help you get through this difficult time and ease the behaviors. In the meantime, try to keep your hands busy- knitting, typing, etc.  My worst times are when my mind is wandering- I'm watching tv or reading and have nothing to do with my hands. Good luck!!"
Trichsters,2bgwqx,vanillasky22,2,Wed Jul 23 12:49:51 2014 UTC,"Sounds like Trich to me, I always end up pulling whenever I find eyelashes that feel too thick or hard. I think self-control is the only way to solve the problem, but someone else might be able to give better advice than me."
Trichsters,2bgwqx,z_m_7689,2,Wed Jul 23 11:08:32 2014 UTC,Stress doesn't always cause or affect trich. This definitely sounds like it is trich.
Trichsters,2bgwqx,JizzBeef,2,Wed Jul 23 11:13:31 2014 UTC,"It sounds like EARLY stages of trich, so it's not too late to start re-training yourself!  You're right, it's unusual for it to start at 28, so chances are you can fight back pretty easily by choosing a replacement habit for when you notice those odd damaged hairs.  Chew gum, knit, something, anything.    My most recent (highly controversial) replacement habit is smoking an e-vaporizer, but this is after 6 years of trying everything and nothing else helping.  Being able to choose low nicotine or even NO nicotine is nice.  Taking a deep breath to unwind the tension I feel when I NEED to pull is one thing, adding a little nicotine to it to chill me out has been helpful.  Have you ever been a smoker?   A friend told me he would get nervous ticks whenever he tried to quit smoking, which is what gave me the idea to try this.  So far I have mixed success, which is an improvement over no success at all.  Not saying you should start smoking, but finding something EQUALLY addictive to pulling those distracting hairs, something else to distract yourself, is what you want.  Good luck, let me know if you want feedback for ideas or have questions."
Trichsters,2bgwqx,snuggle-butt,2,Wed Jul 23 17:35:12 2014 UTC,Thanks. I've never been a smoker.  The only thing I do is play games on my phone which easily turns into playing with one hand while I pull out hair with my other one. :s but I'm going to get a hair cut like many others have suggested and go from there.

Trichsters,2bgomi,snugglebutt,1 point,Wed Jul 23 03:43:34 2014 UTC,you could try a spinner ring. that's what i use. i still do pull my eyebrows out and feel them but a spinner ring is a pretty good distraction.  this is the one i have.

Trichsters,2bf97i,Biyxtren,2,Tue Jul 22 19:33:19 2014 UTC,"I haven't done it myself, but maybe covering them in something like Vaseline? If you're like me, they don't feel good to pick when they're wet or sticky. Might help..."
Trichsters,2bf97i,KittenImmaculate,2,Tue Jul 22 20:39:29 2014 UTC,"I pull my eyebrows too but unless I keep up a 100% effort to avoid pulling, I usually end up with no eyebrows (like now).  I can tell you a that have seems to help as long as I keep up with it:   Cloth Gloves.  I would buy these cheap, soft white gloves at the drug store.  At first I wore them at night, and it worked, but I found that they made my hands too hot and I wouldn't wear them.   ""Glove Thumbs"".  Then I decided to just cut off the thumb and only wear that part.  I realized that without my thumb being free, I couldn't grab a hold of any hairs.  This seems to work well, and it has the added benefit of keeping me from picking the skin on the side of my thumbs (I do that too...OMG WHY??) I recently tried NAC (n-Acetylcysteine) at 2400 mg doses and I had the longest period of resisting pulling in years.  My eyebrows almost grew completely back in.  But then I ran out of the NAC and didn't get a new bottle for a few days, and now... no eyebrows. Again.  I just started taking the NAC again, so I'm hoping it will start working again for me.  Until then, I'm just a dude using an eyebrow pencil to hide my shame."
Trichsters,2bf97i,Dr_Alopex,1 point,Tue Jul 22 22:55:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much for your response!  The cloth gloves definitely sound like a good idea in the winter, but I do think they'd probably be too hot for summer.  Did the glove thumbs actually stay on? That's an interesting idea. Maybe even one of those rubber thingies (that Elliot wears in Scrubs to help her turn the pages, haha) would be a good idea. (Also, I did that as a kid! Switched from that to eyebrow pulling.)  I had read about NAC, and I wasn't sure if it actually worked. But since it seems that we have a lot in common, I'll have to try that. Is it very expensive?  Thanks again for all of the info!"
Trichsters,2bf97i,kapelin,1 point,Wed Jul 23 04:04:27 2014 UTC,"I pull my eyebrows too. I use makeup whenever I leave the house and that has just been my routine for some number of years now. It's annoying and I would love to be able to feel confident in my own skin blah blah blah, but honestly I just feel better with makeup on.  I have used Benefit's brow zings for years, but recently I picked up Too Faced brow envy at Nordstrom Rack and I love it! I recommend both and both will last you a long time (even if you use it multiple times a day, like I do). I feel like any amount of money (to an extent) is worth feeling comfortable leaving the house. Good luck, I hope one of those works out for you!"
Trichsters,2bf97i,kapelin,1 point,Wed Jul 23 01:57:35 2014 UTC,"I was considering starting to do that, but I am just not a make-up kind of girl (I seriously wear it like twice a year), so I have no idea how to do it. :\ There is a girl at work that draws hers on though, so maybe I could ask her how to do it. Do you have any pointers?"
Trichsters,2b9n8i,cheekybrat,1 point,Mon Jul 21 04:16:30 2014 UTC,"You should talk to a dermatologist about daily antibiotics or any other potential treatment.  My dermatologist is one of my greatest allies against my trichotillomania.  Actually a general practitioner could prescribe the antibiotics if you go to the right person, but it sounds like a dermatologist could help you a lot.  Don't be afraid to talk about your problem either, the more your doctors know, the more they can help you."
Trichsters,2b7fyx,SurrealBird,5,Sun Jul 20 12:49:33 2014 UTC,"I am sorry that you feel so badly. Just remember that we are living with a life-long condition, so having a bad day or two (or more...) is ok, and you will survive and move on. If you beat yourself up every time you have a relapse you will only feel worse. Take a deep breath and move forward; tomorrow is a new day.  I try to use mirrors to my advantage. I pull my eyebrows and specifically I pull the hairs that feel out of place. I find that if I am really going at it and make myself get up and go look in the mirror, I show myself that the hairs don't actually LOOK out of the place, even if they feel that way. Sometimes that helps calm me down from feeling like I have to go after every hair.  I apologize if you weren't actually looking for advice in which case you can ignore everything I just said. Just remember that you are not alone and we are all here for you and WE are not frustrated with you!"
Trichsters,2b7fyx,kapelin,3,Sun Jul 20 18:23:06 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the uplifting words. I'm really happy you've found something that helps you and that looking in the mirror can be a positive thing for some. I've never done that. Might as well give it a try. I don't pull my eyebrows, but I definitely know what you mean by hairs that feel ""out of place"" and need to be pulled.    WE are not frustrated with you!   You have no idea how really comforting it is to hear you say that. Sometimes we just need to feel that we aren't just another disappointment. It's nice knowing there are people who understand. Thank you. <3"
Trichsters,2b7fyx,kapelin,3,Mon Jul 21 06:37:22 2014 UTC,":) Hang in there! I am trying really hard to not feel frustrated with myself when I lapse, and I find that it is the most helpful thing I can do. It's nice to know there's a group of people out there who are there for us when we can't seem to do that though."
Trichsters,2b7fyx,mytalkinghead,4,Mon Jul 21 10:21:03 2014 UTC,"We all know that emotion that comes over when we pull, but only you know how it feels for you. I haven't had a pull free day in close to a decade, so a month is definitely something to be supremely proud of! I'm sorry you're feeling so down though, I hope you can take solace in knowing you aren't alone with all of us here for you. Stay strong, friend."
Trichsters,2b7fyx,Remome,2,Mon Jul 21 02:27:33 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry you haven't had a pull-free day in such a long time. It's a constant struggle, but being pull-free for even one hour is an accomplishment to be proud of. Something that sometimes helped me was promising myself some kind of reward. I would deny myself something that I've wanted for a long time and then pamper myself if I stayed pull-free long enough.  I apologize if I sounded overemotional. I was feeling distraught.  Have a lovely day. <3"
Trichsters,2b3rr7,cptrafiki,5,Sat Jul 19 03:10:29 2014 UTC,I have celiac and I can tell you that a gluten free diet has done nothing for my trich. : /
Trichsters,2b3rr7,hejhejhejhejhej,1 point,Sat Jul 19 15:46:55 2014 UTC,When did you start the gluten free diet compared to when you started pulling?
Trichsters,2b3rr7,hejhejhejhejhej,1 point,Sun Jul 20 16:06:05 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I don't pull enough to have bald spots or anything like that, but I touch my hair constantly and pull anything that feels abnormal, like I'm always searching for something that feels weird so I can pull it out. I've done it as long as I can remember. I've been gluten free for about a year and a half."
Trichsters,2b3rr7,Oreosmooshy,2,Sun Jul 20 16:40:15 2014 UTC,"Unless they've done some scientific experiment to prove it, it sounds more like a placebo to me than something that actually changes your body chemistry in such a way. But of course, a placebo improvement is still an improvement, even if it came from your head rather than your diet. If you'd like to try it out I'd say go for it!"
Trichsters,2b3rr7,RedDwarfian,2,Sat Jul 19 03:23:12 2014 UTC,"There has been some scientific scuttlebutt about the lectins in modern wheat causing an inflammation reaction in ALL humans, not just celiac or wheat-allergic people.  There was also a double-blind study that showed that people with IBS who ate modern wheat showed IBS symptoms, while those same people who ate ancient wheat (with a fraction of both the gluten and the lectins as compared to modern wheat) showed significantly reduced symptoms.    I can search for the latter if you'd like.  I seem to have lost the former.    Regardless, IBS and inflammation in the gut (theoretically) caused by wheat are a great source of stress in the human mind, which can lead to all sorts of fun issues, like depression, anxiety, and potentially trich.    Personally, I'm gluten-free.  I decided to try it a few years ago, and when I tried to go back on it, my stomach felt like it was turning inside-out.  Since I've gone gluten-free, I've had quite a bit less stress, and minimal depressive symptoms.    I also made a conscious choice to switch to a lifestyle with a lot more saturated fats, balancing the sources of calories to roughly 40/30/30 fats/carbs/protein, but I'm not going out of my way to count.  Meats, coconut oil, eggs, fresh fruits, etc.  I'm listening to my body as opposed to listening to my taste buds; your body knows what it needs; your taste buds will lie to your face.  I've also lost 40 pounds, but that's beside the point.    With regards to a Trich cure, I'd say that removing this source of gut inflammation is a good way to remove one stressor in your life.  However, the most important ingredient you need to remove from your food is guilt.  Don't feel guilty about indulging yourself with that ice cream.  Don't beat yourself up if you can't meet your dietary requirements.  Doing that only makes you more stressed, which will lead to Trich."
Trichsters,2b3rr7,KraftyPants,1 point,Sat Jul 19 06:14:48 2014 UTC,If I have soda I find I get over stimulated and am more likely to feel keyed up and pull. So yes if I agitate my nervous system with stimulant stuffs I find I am way more likely to pull.
Trichsters,2b1qzf,MacKenzieLaura,3,Fri Jul 18 14:28:05 2014 UTC,"Do you eat the hairs? BTW, welcome to the club new friend!  I used to think I pulled because I was bored or dwelling on something, turns out I have ocd that eventually morphed into impulse control disorder because I would pull while my thoughts raced in circles. Now I go into a trance and do it whenever I think about anything.  Anyways, it feels good to talk about it 'round here. It helps a lot actually."
Trichsters,2b1qzf,mytalkinghead,1 point,Fri Jul 18 21:30:48 2014 UTC,I don't eat it but I totally feel that trance feeling you're talking about. And I 100% do it when I'm bored or really when I'm anxious cuz I have an anxiety disorder as well. I appreciate the warm welcome :)
Trichsters,2b1qzf,SarcasticOptimist,2,Sat Jul 19 05:00:16 2014 UTC,"NAC is very popular, and does calm down that itching-like excitement. I also had started with lashes and eyebrows, and diverting it to less-seen areas (legs? upper arms?) is a good way to cope when the habit's uncontrollable."

Trichsters,2b1qzf,Remome,2,Fri Jul 18 18:56:49 2014 UTC,"Did you see a doctor? In the DSM-V, trichotillomania is defined as an Impulse Control Disorder (ICD), not OCD or any form thereof. Most psychiatrists believe they are closely related, but they are absolutely not the same thing."

Trichsters,2b0a9a,cptrafiki,5,Fri Jul 18 01:15:32 2014 UTC,This seems very suspicious. Are there any links to scientific papers backing up this approach to treating trich?
Trichsters,2b0a9a,StrangeQuark1,2,Fri Jul 18 04:42:53 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't expect there to be much science to back this up since this is not a very well-researched disorder in general, but I COMPLETELY AGREE that this is woefully unsupported and seems very arbitrary. Caffeine I'll buy, but the rest of it? I guess we are expected to believe that the survey evidence is there even though they're not showing it."
Trichsters,2b0a9a,drdisco,1 point,Fri Jul 18 10:50:11 2014 UTC,"It's not scientific in any way other than John Kender testing these foods and coming to these conclusions. It has however helped hundreds of people and is worth trying at least for a little while. The primary thing I would focus on is cutting out sugar as this seems to be a huge trigger for many people, including myself. As for the others, I think it really depends on the person but again it is worth a shot."
Trichsters,2b0a9a,drdisco,1 point,Sat Jul 19 02:30:55 2014 UTC,"Testing these foods on himself? Testing these foods on hundreds of people? How rigorous is this? Is John reviewing symptoms along with consumption data? I don't get it -- and I want to because I am fascinated by the concept of a fungal commensal influencing our behavior BASED ON OUR DIET, but really, it's reasonable to be skeptical of something without more explanation. Is it even plausible? How do any of these foods stimulate or discourage the growth of Malassezia? There isn't enough visible support for the assertions made here. I'm always willing to consider something anecdotal, because that is really all we have at this point, but I don't see that either. I'm bothered by the way it's put together -- assertions without real support, it just seems like more noise."
Trichsters,2b0a9a,aerogirl11,1 point,Sat Jul 19 02:52:36 2014 UTC,I'm not sure on the specifics to be honest and was hoping for more discussion generated by posting the link on here. I searched all over the internet for more information and can only find scraps here and there. I also found some things about gluten and I'm not really sure what's truth and what's not but I feel like all of this is onto something and that food does have a factor here in some way.

Trichsters,2aw5kj,PredictableChick,1 point,Thu Jul 17 01:42:59 2014 UTC,"I started taking Topamax last spring. After a couple of months, I noticed that my skin was considerably clearer than I could ever remember it being, without me having made a conscious effort. By that summer my legs were completely clear, though I was still picking a bit at my face. I guess you could say I relapsed a little during the winter, my skin gets itchy and dry and I wasn't making an effort not to pick. Still overall it wasn't nearly as bad as it was before medication. For the summer I decided to make an effort to let everything heal, which was surprisingly easy. I pick at my face and chest some, but not obsessively. Today I am almost scab free, except a few on my back from a sunburn."
Trichsters,2aw5kj,TokiDokiHaato,1 point,Thu Jul 17 03:09:28 2014 UTC,"I'm at peace with my trichophagia. If I could negate the physical side effects (hair loss, damaged regrowth, hair stuck in my teeth/gums) I'd happily chew hair all day long for the rest of my life. I don't suffer socially or emotionally from it, since I've been pulling and chewing hair since infancy and no longer give any fucks what people think. But the physical effects do exist, so I try.   NAC worked well for me. It seems like a fairly benign course of action - it's just a supplement. I haven't tried any anxiety medications and probably won't. I've tried being conscious of the habit or occupying my hands doing other things. Apparently Silly Putty will irritate fingers if you play with it too long. I look forward to taking NAC again, but there's no data on using it during pregnancy, so I'm holding off for now."
Trichsters,2aw5kj,TokiDokiHaato,1 point,Thu Jul 17 03:50:04 2014 UTC,I guess a really important thing is to be a peace with it and not let it affect other areas of your life. I will look into NAC now. Thanks!
Trichsters,2avax1,lehtolapsi,3,Wed Jul 16 16:23:38 2014 UTC,"I know I (female) pull less (I pull from my head) when I have my nails done so maybe find what works for you. What if you shaved or trimmed so it's harder to pull? Obviously this doesn't get to the root of the problem, but can be a fix, at least short term."
Trichsters,2avax1,Texanjumper,3,Wed Jul 16 17:17:57 2014 UTC,I pull my pubes too. Actually damaged the skin there because I pick at the ingrown ones. It's pretty much bald there since I don't give them the chance to grow back.
Trichsters,2avax1,Remome,2,Thu Jul 17 12:52:48 2014 UTC,"Thank you for sharing ive been pulling my hair for around 4 years and i pull everywhere except for pubes or armpits so personally I don't have much experience with pulling out pubic hair specifically but I have seen some posts floating around in this sub that have addressed it. Its a lot easier to stop, if you're interested in stopping if you know what the cause of the pulling is. Try to find what triggers you, for example, stress, obsession, just plane boredom, are some of the most common triggers I see! If you're more interested in this try browsing around and finding tips on this sub or message/ reply to me. Hope I helped a bit, sorry for the lengthy response"
Trichsters,2avax1,GraySpade,2,Wed Jul 16 16:32:42 2014 UTC,Please don't be embarrassed or shameful. I pull everywhere! Even my nosehairs and pubic area. A lot of posts recently have mentioned NAC as an over-the-counter supplement that seems to be very helpful with taking the urge to pull down a bit. Look into it if you can.
Trichsters,2avax1,mortimusalexander,2,Wed Jul 16 23:08:54 2014 UTC,"Dude, you'll be surprised how many there are of us. It's weird, but it's not something to be overly ashamed of.   With the complete hair loss, I'm not sure how long it takes until the hair doesn't grow back. I stress about this because I pull my hair right along my hairline, and if it doesn't grow back I'm going to look reeeeallly weird. Follicle damage does happen, and it's possible it could happen to you."
Trichsters,2ato09,TokiDokiHaato,3,Wed Jul 16 02:41:26 2014 UTC,Congrats!!!! I am a NAC user and I just hit 3 months pull free :) It is so rewarding to start to see re-growth! Keep it up!
Trichsters,2ato09,mashel2811,2,Wed Jul 16 14:37:29 2014 UTC,"Awesome!  I would say I've gone from pulling 100s of hairs a day to pulling maybe 5-10?  Which is huge for me.  I think with more time and habit breaking I can be 100% pull free.  I honestly never thought it'd work but it has been.  Even at 2 1/2 weeks I can already see regrowth coming in which keeps me hopeful I haven't done too much damage (even the bald spot I just pulled, I can feel tiny hairs coming in).  I'm sure it'll be a few months before it's anything really noticeable though."

I have my first appointment with a therapist this month, specifically to address picking-related behavior.   A couple of times I've bitten them off or set them on fire (I know the latter sounds weird, but my best friend's mom growing up used to do it just to show that the hair wouldn't catch fire, so not weird/scary a concept to me) and it's not so much exactly what I was doing but the fact that I couldn't just not remove the offending split end. Like there could be other people around and it wouldn't matter. Just knowing it was there would bother me tremendously.   Just writing this I truly see how obsessive/weird it is. =/"

I'll seek them out and break them off, sometimes I'll curl the hair with my nails and when it's curled I pull it then run my fingers over it for a while. The hairs that are split up the shaft are the ones I spend the most time with. I'll tell myself that as long as I have that one messed up hair I can keep playing with it and won't pull anymore...except that doesn't work and I pull again :("

The hairs that are split up   So you are trying to make it split, or looking for splits that already exist?  I go outside where it is sunny because the weak points are easier to see in the sunlight. It's easiest to stop myself from looking for splits at night because I know they're harder to find...but that just makes me justify doing it during the day when I need to give my attention to more important things. Some people go out for cigarette breaks, I take my dog out and look for splits."

I haven't been able to do it since I cut my hair fairly short 2 years ago (it's been growing out but isn't quite long enough to search through.) I find it way healthier than my usual trichophagia.   I've been considering picking the habit back up. My trich has gotten worse lately and I'm afraid to use NAC since I'm newly pregnant. It would certainly be much better for my hair/scalp than near-constant pulling."
Trichsters,2ap37e,alleeexxxx,1 point,Tue Jul 15 00:09:03 2014 UTC,"All this came about for me because I decided to see how long I could grow my hair and also keep it healthy. I used to have short hair, like a pixie cut, so it wasn't even a possibility.   I've definitely bitten them off before, and I'm ashamed to say I've done it around other people. Like I knew if someone saw me do it there was a good chance they would be grossed out but I simply couldn't let it be.   I've asked people to borrow their scissors, or simply used their kitchen scissors when they weren't paying attention."

My curiosity is genuine, and some others in this thread suggest that cutting the ends is a gateway behavior to pulling them out. So I was thinking if I better understood why it might stop me from going there myself.  Honestly no judgment to you! I know what this subreddit is about, and I have other compulsive habits that are just as irrational as hair pulling. So I do kind of get it in a roundabout way."

""But what if you just pull the hair out?""   ""Then I guess you're one hair short.""  Been pulling ever since. Cut my hair to a pixie, it's growing out and I'm getting better...

Trichsters,2a7zp6,NthThrowawayThisWeek,7,Wed Jul 9 07:30:12 2014 UTC,"Big hugs :c Don't hate yourself. Recovering from trich is always going to have set-backs. And even when you have 'recovered', you may go through some stress and find that you relapse a little bit. But just think, you've gone through a 'handful of months' without pulling! That's fantastic! And your eyelashes for 'seven or eight months'! That's really incredible!  So, if you've done it before and managed not to pull for that long, then you'll do it again and maybe for longer. c: Give yourself a bit of a break and try to be fair to yourself, you've done fantastically well, you've just had a bit of a setback. And even though you've had a minor set-back, you were still able to stop yourself, snap out of it, and have a rant on reddit instead and express your frustration in a less harmful way. You've done really well! Set-backs will happen. But by the sounds of it, they're getting few and far between. So do something nice for yourself today, and be proud of yourself, not angry with yourself. Frustration will only hurt your self-esteem more and create that anxiety which impells you to want to pick more. So, instead, I command you to have an indulgent day and give yourself a break. Be fair to yourself!"
Trichsters,2a7zp6,Jo-rmungandr,1 point,Wed Jul 9 12:45:44 2014 UTC,"Aww man, mad props for even making it as long as you did without any sort of relapse! I hope you can find some moments to be proud of yourself instead of disappointed in your relapse. I can only hope to find the strength that you have to overcome pulling for that long! I understand the disappointment though, of course. Once, in my 12 years of pulling, have I been able to regrow lashes to the point of them being visible, and when I relapsed and pulled them all in one fit... NEVER have I hated myself more.  But I'm working on viewing it as ""one day at a time"", and have faith that I'll reach that point again. And I have faith that you will, too!   Chin up, m'dear. You'll get there <3"
Trichsters,2a6eqr,GrilledCheeseMcGee,2,Tue Jul 8 20:56:19 2014 UTC,Great idea.  Did you think of writing down how many hairs too? That might make it hit home even more.  I always say I should do this and then I never do because I don't want to be depressed :(  How did it make you feel to see this?
Trichsters,2a6eqr,kittiesgomeow,1 point,Wed Jul 9 02:01:45 2014 UTC,"It was one hair each time I pulled. I immediately regretted each one I pulled. Honestly, it made me see that I don't have the control that I thought I did, but I did see a pattern. I noticed I lose focus every ten minutes average. This helped because by the end of the two hour period I was able to recognize that lulling trance feeling that I slip into when I pull and stop it before my hands could touch my head."

I posted this in Vancouver Trichsters and thought this had a bigger following --  I'm a longtime trich sufferer, long time lurker (:/) of the trich subreddit (finally signed up today). I saw this video of Laura Cuthbert a couple days ago. (who is freaking amazing, if you don't know who she is you should join her group on facebook, she's like the trich godmother). It's amazing, I've never seen anything like this before and Laura seems so happy.  A great thing about this video is that she concisely describes what trich is without it making it sound like she's a complete victim (one thing I hate is being treated like a victim). I'm definitely going to inquire and see if these can really make a difference in the long term..."

Trichsters,2a1fhi,somatox,1 point,Mon Jul 7 10:54:34 2014 UTC,"I can relate. The pulling of hair on my head was actually me ripping split ends off part way. So sure, my hair got a bit thinner and raggedier but I didn't exactly have bald patches. Back in the thick of my obsession with pulling, I would also lose whole evenings completely zoned out, finding split ends.  I brought it up with a doctor a while back and all she had to say was 'just stop'. I really think that doctors should be more learned in this area of disorders and take them more seriously. Especially how they relate to other problems. One's issues are generally more complicated and interwoven than it seems at first glance.  Another example I have to support this is that I have had an addiction to chemical smells for seven years. I would buy correction fluid pens at school from the age of eleven, and decorate paper with them while taking in the 'gorgeous sweet smell'. The worst part is that my friends would buy me new ones when I ran out, and others treated it like a quirk of mine. Hell, they didn't even consider that I was solvent abusing. Though I wasn't doing it for the high - it was the smell. Fast forward to this January, I get diagnosed with anaemia. Turns out if you have a vitamin deficiency you can start developing elements of pica. I went on a course of iron tablets and my compulsion to smell these scents disappeared.  After struggling with other interrelated mental/hair issues I cut my hair from waist-length to shoulder-length. This has helped dramatically - though I still occasionally pull. Unfortunately I have also turned to pulling split ends off pubic hair. A remedy for that is waxing the whole area, which I do occasionally but not enough because it hurts so much.  I wish people would understand that impulse control issues are not a joke. Our health quirks are not a joke.  I'm not really qualified to give advice, but my suggestion is that you keep trying to get treatment for at least the ADD, and with any luck you might get an improvement with the eyebrow touching as well. If not, maybe you could look online for any fidgeting tools or support groups that might help."
Trichsters,2a1fhi,hairsofstromkirk,1 point,Mon Jul 7 12:49:48 2014 UTC,"Generally I'm rubbing my eyebrows with my fingers/nails more than actually pulling (though I have some bare spots because of this). I manage to avoid this in public settings (including work) but right now as I'm typing this, I'm rubbing them. I can also zone out and do it for like 5 minutes without doing anything else. Best tip I can say if you're so focused on it at work is maybe to put a gel or wetness of some sort on your eyebrows to make it less appealing to touch. I don't touch mine after showers until they're dry."
Trichsters,29ss8i,mytalkinghead,2,Fri Jul 4 03:37:10 2014 UTC,"You're certainly not alone. I'll go for a few days without pulling and think I'm finally making progress then completely wreck a month's worth of self control and pull out two big patches of my beard. I finally starting pulling my mustache, the one thing that had always been safe until recently. On worse days, I'll dig at an ingrown until I know it will scar and I'll just keep going. It doesn't matter where I am or who I'm around, sometimes it just happens. However, I've been doing it less and less lately and I've been pulling for over ten years. Just keep trying, we can get better."
Trichsters,29ss8i,Fonksquid,2,Fri Jul 4 06:25:39 2014 UTC,"I can absolutely relate! I can grow this huge, red, lumberjack beard that really does look nice, but I pull out giant patches of hair once I feel an ingrown. The ingrown has to be clean of any hair growing out, but I know it has to regrow as part of the healing process.   I'm scared to shave my head because of all of the scars, but to make matters worse, I'm experiencing male pattern baldness and have been since 16. So once I started to get out of the pulling phase at like 18, I went to go get a haircut one day and my barber mentioned how much thinner I looked even though I hadn't pulled for three months.  Since that day, I haven't stopped and I'm finding that I continue to pull from areas that I know I'll get a root from, coincidentally the most painful places.  I recently had to quit my job because of the shame I felt for not being able to stop pulling and picking scabs on my head, and a host of other panics/worries/anxieties."

I'm still personally struggling with it, so I apologize for not having too many words of wisdom, but I'm here if you need to talk things through!"
Trichsters,29ss8i,mtbackos,2,Fri Jul 4 15:34:59 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words, I'm 25 and have been pulling since 12/13. SSRIs only exasperate my irrational thoughts and make me contemplate suicide on a more serious scale. Most doctors I talk to haven't heard of my pair of trich diagnoses and are shocked when I show them all of my dermatophagia scars and sores.  I had an ex that thought she understood it because one of her best friends had trich, but when we moved in together after two years she lost it on me. She couldn't take seeing me harm myself and left, but me sensing her distress made me pull more, and her breaking up with me through a text sent me off the cliff.  My parents don't get it, they see themselves as having done everything perfectly when raising me, but they forget about all of the negative things that they've said towards me over the years. They talk about me in clear earshot, calling me irrational and continuously asking each other ""What on earth is he thinking? Doesn't he see what he's doing to himself?"" To tell them ""I don't think when I pull."" is entirely unacceptable, because it's the one thing that lets me stop living in the roundabout of circular thought inside my head.  I'm unemployed and entirely reliant on others because my host of other mental disorders rarely let me leave the house without putting on my full suit of emotional battle armor. I'm not used to this; I have three years completed on an agricultural engineering degree and have had two successful career building jobs. Yet, like everything else in my life, my irrational thought and obsessions drive me away before I can finish my goal."
Trichsters,29ss8i,veryfunbags,2,Fri Jul 4 17:39:06 2014 UTC,"I'm so sorry that this has taken such a negative toll on so many aspects of your life. I can relate to the issues with your parents. With my mom and dad both recovering from substance addictions in their late 20s, you would think that they would have at least a small idea of how hard it feels to stop.  Especially when the substance is constantly growing from your own body.   I was always a well-behaved teenager, but my hair was the only thing I would fight with them about. ""You're being ridiculous, just stop already! That's what you get for sneaking out and drinking beers with your friends, the stress of lying has made you do this!"" Ugh I don't even want to think back to it.   Just keep taking it day by day and never let it make you feel like less than you really are."

If we ""relapse"" then we have to reset it back to zero and start over.

She knew a good amount about trich and talking to her made it way less intimidating and much easier to understand! That, and I joined some online communities (such as this) for support, which has probably helped more than anything else. There isn't an actual set treatment for trich, unfortunately, but there are different things that help different people cope and recover. Recognizing what situations typically make you pull is a great start, though! I wish you the very best."
Trichsters,29sd6z,Shelbalia,2,Fri Jul 4 02:50:47 2014 UTC,Thank you so much for your advice!
Trichsters,29sd6z,edthomson92,1 point,Fri Jul 4 16:34:38 2014 UTC,"First: keep track of how often you pull in a journal for a week or two, so you can get more familiar with your triggers  Next: find something to keep your hands busy: stress ball, tangle, or spinner/fidget ring."
Trichsters,29s87w,veronicamars82,3,Thu Jul 3 23:29:47 2014 UTC,Hmm. Do you use makeup to fill in the hair loss and make it less noticeable?   It seems like you have a lot of anxiety about having this problem (which is common) but do you have coping methods like makeup tricks?
Trichsters,29s87w,idiosyncrassy,1 point,Thu Jul 3 23:36:04 2014 UTC,I use eyeliner so you can't really tell about the eyelashes unless you're up close to me. I have some eyebrow pencils but I never use them because I always end up looking ridiculous. I tried buying a stencil but still never got the hang of it.
Trichsters,29s87w,idiosyncrassy,5,Thu Jul 3 23:51:43 2014 UTC,"I, too, am not gifted in the makeup arena. Luckily, I'm only an eyelash puller, so there's only one area to spackle over for me. :) I do like those YouTube tutorials for practice, though. It's like step-by-step instruction that you can view in your own private time.  That said- that guy was being an asshole. Just because your [lack of] eyebrows is apparent, or that it's kind of a unique compulsion doesn't mean he had some sort of right to ask rude questions. Did he go around emailing other girls about the size of their nose or the zit on their face? Because that's what that kind of question is like.  But there will be a certain percentage of people who are rude, esp. on the internet. Some people will have no social skills. And there will probably be a certain amount of trolls who think it's super-funny to ding people on their problem areas just to be jerks.   So you might need to start a ""fuck you file"" for people like that, instead of internalizing their criticisms. Come up with a snappy, sarcastic response, like ""My eyebrows? They got shot off in Vietnam"" or ""There was a horrible Thanksgiving deep fry incident I'd prefer not to talk about"" to put them in their place.  Nobody's perfect. We aren't, and Mr. Jerk sure isn't. Trich isn't something you're somehow required to defend or justify to strangers, anymore than if you had crooked front teeth or big ears."
Trichsters,29s87w,h0neybadgerdontcare,2,Fri Jul 4 01:04:50 2014 UTC,Wow.  Thank you so much. I just needed to vent and was not expecting such a helpful and thoughtful response!
Trichsters,29s87w,lildrummerliz,3,Fri Jul 4 02:27:44 2014 UTC,"Tell him that you have trich. Educate him a bit, and even make him feel bad if you absolutely must.  He could have been genuinely curious, but the way he worded that was rude, and if his focus is just your appearance, he's not worth your time, anyway.  You could even add to your bio: ""In case you're wondering where my eyebrows are, I suffer from trich.."" and explain it. Link an informational site, too.  Once again, educate people.    You have to convince yourself that you're beautiful regardless.  Someone worth your time will think the same :) My boyfriend was informed right off the bat of my trich, and has been supportive but not condescending."
Trichsters,29s87w,ProsimiansOnPluto,2,Tue Jul 8 04:14:37 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much :) That's wonderful to hear about your boyfriend! Another reason I've been hesitant to date is because I've only told a few close friends about my trich and I'm worried about the reaction a potential boyfriend would have.  I think I am going to respond. My initial reaction was to curse them out, but I think I am going to be a bit more diplomatic. Educate the person, but also let him know his message was rude."
Trichsters,29s87w,lildrummerliz,2,Thu Jul 10 16:41:30 2014 UTC,"Everyone has insecurities about the way they look. You took a risk in putting yourself out there- so you should be proud of yourself for that!  I would look into getting something that looks like real eyebrows so you can get some self confidence. I would look into /r/MakeupAddiction for resources on creating an eyebrow with makeup.  I don't pull my eyebrows, but I do pull lashes. Last month I found some really good fake lashes and wore those. I feel like they really helped me for a number of reasons. For one- I didn't feel insecure about having gaps between my lashes. But another thing- I would pull at my lashes, end up yanking at the fake ones, then immediately stop so I wouldn't mess them up. It actually helped me to stop pulling!  Find confidence is tough- but not having eyebrows isn't something you should worry about. Good luck :)"

Every day has it's challenges, but you just have to be positive and don't look at little slip ups like they're the end of the world, it's just a little speed bump. Because my pulling was mainly that bottom corner, I decided to cut about 6 or 7 inches of my hair off, and for some reason that was really helpful for me."
Trichsters,29mpxe,creepycrepes1990,1 point,Fri Jul 4 00:33:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah I've kept my hair between a pixie cut and a short bob since I was 14 because it seems to help. After my last bad pulling session behind my ears, I took advantage of the undercut style and had the sides shaved and the top kept long. It isn't a long term solution, but at least it looks purposely done :)"
Trichsters,29mpxe,haylestotheyeah,1 point,Fri Jul 4 15:22:46 2014 UTC,"I have always thought about shaving a side of my head, to make it intentional, but I work for a lawyer (and future father-in-law) and that would be so tacky. He would never let me do that to my hair.  Even when/if you slip up, just don't get down on it. That's the worst thing you can do. Everybody always has a slip up.  Just remind yourself to stop, go find something else to do for a few minutes, and do not ever mope over a little setback. That's all I can say about it.   I really hope you've been doing well and holding as strong as possible. You can always pm me if you want to talk more."

Trichsters,29kadr,KittenImmaculate,6,Tue Jul 1 14:07:20 2014 UTC,"Generally literature refers to it as an impulse control disorder and the new DSM is calling it an anxiety disorder. I believe a disease would be something more medically relevant, i.e. trich is not eating away at my body or affecting my bloodstream. But there are a bunch of people in the comments for that link that keep insisting it's a disease."
Trichsters,29kadr,raptorcorn8,2,Tue Jul 1 14:08:36 2014 UTC,Disorder is a subcategory of disease. You are equating disease with infectious disease.  Typically mental health officials prefer to use the term disorder as it is less stigmatizing than disease or illness.
Trichsters,29kadr,arwenface,1 point,Tue Jul 1 20:39:19 2014 UTC,It's also not contagious or caused by bacteria/virus.
Trichsters,29kadr,Lunatic721,3,Tue Jul 1 17:21:27 2014 UTC,"Neither is alcoholism, but that is considered a disease."
Trichsters,29kadr,raptorcorn8,2,Tue Jul 1 20:22:40 2014 UTC,I believe when medical professionals refer to alcoholism as a disease they are referring specifically to physical alcohol dependency. Substance use disorder is a diagnosis in DSM-V dealing with the mental and emotional dependency.
Trichsters,29kadr,Elsie980,3,Tue Jul 1 20:52:48 2014 UTC,"I would call it a disorder as well (but I am not a doctor).  Regardless of the ""controversy"" in the comments, thank you for sharing.  It's helpful to see that I am not alone."
Trichsters,29kadr,yogo4froyo,2,Tue Jul 1 16:07:42 2014 UTC,None of us is alone! It's a daily struggle (I just spent 10 minutes trying to get my eyebrows even). I definitely prefer disorder because it could theoretically be healed by really intent thinking/therapy vs a disease which requires medical intervention and can't be healed in that same way. (Not saying trich is ever really healed well).
Trichsters,29kadr,pseudoscienceoflove,3,Tue Jul 1 16:13:23 2014 UTC,BFRB (Body Focused Repetitive Behavior) is another term I think is more appropriate than disease.
Trichsters,29kt86,KraftyPants,3,Tue Jul 1 17:21:21 2014 UTC,"You are doing amazing - 4 weeks! I can't even imagine that progress! Moments of weakness are just that, moments. You've been doing so well for so long consistently, find something to reward yourself with because you deserve it. I myself am a big fan of baking things/eating things/food in general (which my personal trainer hates me for but who cares! FOOD!!!). Try a new recipe, go for a jog, spend a couple hours in that place you've always said you wanted to go but have never taken the time to! You are amazing and I wish I had the discipline to get to where you are."
Trichsters,29kt86,whatsitallabout3,3,Tue Jul 1 21:07:39 2014 UTC,Good for you! I hope this helped!   I've never gone more than a few days without pulling (from my head).   What are you doing? Just being more aware or something specific?
Trichsters,29kt86,Texanjumper,2,Wed Jul 2 01:48:05 2014 UTC,"Self-cognative-behavior stuff. Basically I repeat thoughts and even statements to myself like ""I don't pull."" I also try to internalize reactions that people give me normally as my own. Like ""that's weird"" ""that must hurt"" etc. I try to think like I don't have trich and it has worked really well for me. I still ""feel"" for hairs but haven't pulled before today.   Other things that help are keeping my eye area moisturized and then exfoliating occasionally with a wash cloth to make it easier for new hairs to surface. I play video games pretty regularly and that keeps both hands occupied. I figured out maybe a year ago that I pull when I feel over-stimulated and keyed-up. So by being aware of that I can plan to be playing games accordingly. I also pull when I'm tired, so when I would start to pull (feeling around) I'd start getting ready for bed.   So i guess I'm aware of why I do it when I do, and I have specific game-plans for if I do it. But the huge game-changer has been the internalizing the ""I don't pull. I don't do that. That's silly, haha!"" attitude."
Trichsters,29lg1b,mtbackos,5,Tue Jul 1 21:04:51 2014 UTC,"While dealing with trich can be a shot to our own self esteem, I find most people I tell about it don't find it to be shocking or disturbing.  If your boyfriend has an adverse reaction to your pulling then I say good riddance. Just because we live with a (in the grand scheme of things) minor disorder doesn't make us any less normal than everyone else.  Explain to him its something you deal with personally and all you want is for him to be aware of it. If he seems comfortable with it, maybe point him to some of the trich resources in the sidebar (are they there? I'm on mobile and can't tell) which I know helped my girlfriend understand what was going on and how she could help.  Remember, in life we can make decisions based in either fear or love. Don't approach a situation because you were driven there by fear. Instead tell your boyfriend because you love ( or extreme ""like"", wherever you are in the relationship) him and want to share yourself with him.  Good luck and much love."
Trichsters,29lg1b,stev0205,2,Tue Jul 1 21:24:18 2014 UTC,"The last part about making decisions based on fear or love is so true, such a great mindset to go into this with, thanks :)  I definitely want to stress that this is something I'm dealing with personally and that I don't expect him to treat me any differently because his mom has had major struggles with depression and anxiety that have created a messy divide in his family. I don't want him to get the idea that being with me will be difficult because of trich."
Trichsters,29lg1b,whatsitallabout3,2,Tue Jul 1 21:40:47 2014 UTC,"Hi! I think your best bet is to approach it in a very casual, ""this is normal day-to-day chatter"" type of way. It isn't something that deserves to be stigmatized - everyone has felt anxiety at one point or another in their lives, and everyone copes with it in their own way.   When I told my boyfriend I just threw it in there during a conversation about anxiety like ""Oh yeah I know what you mean, sometimes I just pull out my hair."" which lead of course to the whole conversation about it. He didn't judge me for it at all, he just wanted to help me, and I think that's just how it goes with people who care about you. Don't worry about your boyfriend's judgement! He will just want to help. Good luck!!"
Trichsters,29lg1b,whatsitallabout3,1 point,Tue Jul 1 21:22:33 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much for the response! I like the idea of keeping it light, for some reason I felt like I had to sit him down and have a very somber talk.

I've been pulling for 15 years and I notice my lashes and eyebrows especially grow back better when the area is moisturized well and monthly exfoliated lightly to allow the little sprouts to push through.
Trichsters,29f84e,KraftyPants,2,Mon Jun 30 14:12:54 2014 UTC,"Oh thank you! I suffer from dry skin so this may be why. I've been pulling these areas for 8 years. My scalp for 20.

I honestly don't have any experience with eyebrow/eyelash extensions. My situation is the exact opposite; I used to pull my eyelashes for years, then my hands moved to my scalp. It's been like that for 20 years. Are you a member of the Trichsters group on Facebook? That one is more active.

Trichsters,297usr,DiscoApocalypse,5,Fri Jun 27 05:08:29 2014 UTC,"I also have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and CSP (compulsive skin picking).  For me, as the anxiety gets worse, so does the trich and the skin picking.    I bit my nails first, for about 2-3 years.  Then at some point I switched to picking my cuticles instead, for the past 6 years or so but a lot worse in the past year or so, due to increased stress.  When the skin picking got worse, trich started noticeably becoming an issue; prior to that it was just a little bit on occasion.  Basically, anxiety leads to skin picking and hair pulling.  Which increases anxiety and leads to more skin picking and so forth.  Fun cycle."

Trichsters,297usr,mtbackos,1 point,Sat Jun 28 04:17:25 2014 UTC,"Anxiety and depression are known for their co-morbidity, i.e. the two tend to be related and/or present at the same time."
Trichsters,297usr,izuchat,1 point,Sat Jun 28 04:30:27 2014 UTC,"Section 22. Comorbidity of article  Generalized anxiety disorder:       In the National Comorbidity Survey (2005), 58 percent of patients diagnosed with major depression were found to have an anxiety disorder; among these patients, the rate of comorbidity with GAD was 17.2 percent, and with panic disorder, 9.9 percent. Patients with a diagnosed anxiety disorder also had high rates of comorbid depression, including 22.4 percent of patients with social phobia, 9.4 percent with agoraphobia, and 2.3 percent with panic disorder. [citation needed] A longitudinal cohort study found 12% of the 972 participants had GAD comorbid with MDD.  Accumulating evidence indicates that patients with comorbid depression and anxiety tend to have greater illness severity and a lower treatment response than those with either disorder alone.  In addition, social function and quality of life are more greatly impaired.  For many, the symptoms of both depression and anxiety are not severe enough (i.e. are subsyndromal) to justify a primary diagnosis of either major depressive disorder (MDD) or an anxiety disorder. However, dysthymia is the most prevalent comorbid diagnosis of GAD clients. Patients can also be categorized as having mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, and they are at significantly increased risk of developing full-blown depression or anxiety. [citation needed]  Those with GAD have a lifetime comorbidity prevalence of 30% to 35% with alcohol abuse and dependence and 25% to 30% for drug abuse and dependence.  Sufferers of both GAD and a substance abuse disorder also have a higher lifetime prevalence for other comorbidities.  A study found that GAD was the primary disorder in slightly more than half of the 18 participants that were comorbid with alcohol use disorder.   In addition to coexisting with depression, research shows that GAD often coexists with conditions associated with stress, such as irritable bowel syndrome.  Patients with GAD can sometimes present with symptoms such as insomnia or headaches as well as pain, cardiac events and interpersonal problems.   [citation needed]  Further research suggests that about 20 to 40 percent of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have comorbid anxiety disorders, with GAD being the most prevalent.   The World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease project did not include generalized anxiety disorders.  In lieu of global statistics, here are some prevalence rates from around the world:   Australia: 3 percent of adults  Canada: Between 3 and 5 percent of adults [citation needed] Italy: 2.9 percent  Taiwan: 0.4 percent  United States: approx. 3.1 percent of people age 18 and over in a given year (9.5 million)    The usual age of onset is variable, from childhood to late adulthood, with the median age of onset being approximately 31 (Kessler, Berguland, et al., 2005) and mean age of onset is 32.7.  Most studies find that GAD is associated with an earlier and more gradual onset than the other anxiety disorders.  The prevalence of GAD in children is approximately 3%; the prevalence in adolescents is reported as high as 10.8%.  When GAD appears in children and adolescents, it typically begins around 8 to 9 years of age.   Populations that are at an increased risk of GAD are individuals with low and middle socio-economic status, separated, divorced, and widowed individuals. Women are twice as likely to develop GAD as men. This is primarily because women are more likely than men to live in poverty, be subject to discrimination, and be sexually and physically abused.  GAD is also common in the elderly population.   Compared to the general population, patients with internalizing disorders such as depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have higher mortality rates, but die of the same age-related diseases as the population, such as heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and cancer.

My dilemma was the same: wanted short hair to possibly stop my pulling for a while, but didn't want the glaring bald patch at the crown of my scalp to show. Went ahead, hairdresser noticed it, got a pixie cut. I stopped pulling for a month and four days, but ended up continuing... As of right now I'm actually a week clean!  I say go for it, if it's not huge patches, but if you want you can go for something like a layered bob to keep it covered if you can. The best of luck to you!"
Trichsters,295r70,lunaticlove,1 point,Thu Jun 26 17:09:24 2014 UTC,"Just yesterday I had most of my hair shorn off, it's pretty much a buzzcut now, a little longer on top but still only about an inch long. I feel fantastic with it like this, I haven't pulled yet (which is actually pretty good going for me), and haven't even had the urge to, and besides it's too short to get a grip on! I know it's pretty drastic, but I honestly feel better about my looks like this. I have a few small bald spots but they're not all that noticeable, even with my hair like this. I felt more self conscious about them with shoulder length hair because I knew that if a certain part moved a certain way that my scalp would be visible and it would be much more obvious. So I was constantly anxious about it. Now they're out for the world to see, and the world hasn't taken any notice yet.   At this point I've been pulling for nearly 15 years, and by now I care less about people noticing my bad patches and more about stopping it altogether. So this haircut works for me. That may not be the situation for everybody. So I will say that, over the years, my pulling has always been worse with longer hair, and shorter hair is really stylish right now, so OP, I definitely think you should go for it."

I'm a guy and always have had short hair until the past couple years when I decided to grow it out to donate it. I constantly get compliments on how beautiful my hair is but hidden within are these hairs. Some are very thick, I'm talking twice the thickness of my average hair, they're very stiff, sometimes the ""waviness"" in them is very deep like an ""S"" other times very tight and shallow like in the picture. It's so satisfying to pull them out though, I feel like I'm cleansing myself of these unnatural things. And I noticed they're very common at the crown of my head so I'm assuming they're like that because the follicles were damaged in some way when the skin was fused together as a fetus or whatever. Unfortunately, the habit of pulling them out has led me to pulling out any hair which isn't very smooth and uniform and I commonly find myself with a large pile of hair on the floor next to my bed or couch(I pull when I'm relaxing and watching TV generally). from what I've read this can be brought on by depression or anxiety, which fits me as I've always been a very deeply depressed person and this somehow brings happiness to me even though I feel weird about and my family doesn't quite understand who I do it. Thankfully my hair grows fast and I have a lot of it so it isn't super noticeable with bald spots and all that, I try not to focus too much on one are for that reason.

It's kind of the same thing here. I've just really started working in more praise for myself, whether it's about small hair pulling achievements or just every day things, like doing chores I dislike or completing assignments. I also told my fiancé that my therapist made this suggestion, so we give each other more high fives now for the things we do, big and small :)"

Trichsters,28m7j3,jellygoesoink,1 point,Sat Jun 21 04:24:54 2014 UTC,"I don't pull hairs unless they feel ""wrong"" (thick and wiry/kinky).   I often pull to feel better. It is one of the only ways I can get a quick catharsis when I have no other options (not allowed to shout/scream, raise my voice, etc).   In fact, pulling directly came from two places:   1) a mom who demanded that I never react to anything no matter how abusive she became.   2) I have an itchy sensitive scalp/dandruff issues and my mom made me paranoid about lice/fleas at a very young age. Every time I feel like I can feel a crawling itch in my head, I want to pull out the hair and catch the bug.   I have been checked out by a dermatologist so I know I don't have lice or fleas. I'm just very very sensitive on my head.   If I don't brace myself for the sensation, the feeling of water on my scalp is almost unbearably sensitive. It's almost like touching an erogenous zone.   I'm not sure therapy will really help me. My pulling activates when I am stressed or anxious about big things that I can't do anything about. It does help me somewhat, though. I exercise, eat well, do deep breathing exercises and try to relax (not often with kids and a full time job).  But pulling satisfies a deep need that I fear would instead be used for things like cutting or drug abuse. So I pull just enough and make rules for pulling. And it kind of balances, ya know?  Do you have any experience with people who don't cure/go bald from pulling but just find a balance?  I'm lucky I have thick quick growing hair. I haven't had a bald spot since childhood."
Trichsters,28m7j3,jellygoesoink,1 point,Sat Jun 21 00:15:28 2014 UTC,"I don't treat people with trich, but it's my opinion that the goals people have for trich are totally a personal decision. Whether you want to stop at all or to what degree is up to you. I also don't think everyone has to participate in therapy to improve. But it has worked well for me so far.    You mention that therapy may not help you because you are stressed or anxious about big things that are out of your control. Therapists don't focus on finding the solutions to all of your problems. They may do some problem solving with you but they mostly focus on helping you build coping skills (i.e., skills to tolerate distress, relax, reframe the way you think about a problem, be mindful of how your body is feeling, etc). So hair pulling is one way to cope, but therapists can help you figure out what other ways work for you.   Even though I study clinical psychology and have my own clients, it's been really nice having another person's perspective. I don't resonate with every suggestion or thought she has, but she has certainly provided a lot of insight that I don't think I could have discovered on my own."
Trichsters,28lkxy,supergoat69,3,Fri Jun 20 00:12:27 2014 UTC,"Simple little things you can do include: - wearing a hat around the house (make sure it's not too tight, that may only add to the problem) - meditate for 5-10 minutes whenever you feel yourself leaning towards another pulling episode - keep your hands constantly busy! knit, draw, or fiddle with rings/bracelets - anything to keep your hands constantly moving and away from your hair."

Trichsters,28l3pv,bonheursenfantins,5,Thu Jun 19 21:10:26 2014 UTC,"A more productive view of this would be to think that you actually managed to do two months without severe pulling. The longest I've been able to do is maybe a week or a two. Congratulations of the two months. Now, try to beat that record! :D  This actually makes me think of my mother who is a inactive smoker. She has smoked most of her life but managed to stop smoking periodically when I was a kid. At first she would last 2 or 3 weeks without a smoke. When I was a teenager there were about 2 years between ""smoking episodes"". And now a days it's probably 3-4 years between episodes."
Trichsters,28l3pv,johannesg,3,Thu Jun 19 22:44:17 2014 UTC,"A relapse is not a failure, it is a learning experience.  How did you feel before you begin to pull again? Is anything in your life right now stressing you out? What can you do to calm yourself again?  And what about your diet? ""You are what you eat."" Food affects us both mentally and physically - have you eaten anything different lately? Is it time for you to take a step back and reevaluate how you eat? I highly recommend reading this ---> myglutenfreequest.com/glutens-role-in-trichotillomania/  You can PM me anytime. I usually check Reddit two or three times a week."
Trichsters,28l3pv,Konalatte,2,Thu Jun 19 22:30:45 2014 UTC,"Every minute you don't pull is a victory--you made it two months, you can do it again! It feels like failure right now, but don't give in. It's not over."

Trichsters,28gxzr,Aldairion,2,Wed Jun 18 16:20:37 2014 UTC,"I saw a therapist but it was on the NHS and Im not convinced of how quality the therapy was. See my pulling comes in cycles, sometimes I'll go months with no eyelashes and eyebrows, and then I'll have a good spell for a couple of months. I went into therapy in a bad spell then hit a good spell, whereby the therapist decided I was cured, and the therapy stopped. Been back to pulling since with no change. not sure it was too helpful anyway but maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind for it, I just wanted a quick fix and you cant expect that.  Good luck with your therapy, I'd be interested to hear about it. Oh and your bald spots aren't noticeable to me, even from that angle. Its just nasty trich making you see problems where there aren't any, trust me, I know!!"

I pick my head + pubes which causes embarrassing ingrown hairs. Like you, I've tried to quit so many times and the longest I've ever lasted was about two weeks.   I contacted a psychiatrist who specializes in impulsive disorders and he said that he'd have me in for a clinical assessment so I am going to see him soon. Good luck to you, it's good to know others are in the same boat as me."
Trichsters,28h9xh,Westmang,1 point,Wed Jun 18 18:12:49 2014 UTC,"I have had trichotillomania for 20 years. I'm 27 now and I cannot count how many times I have felt the desperate hopelessness you have K expressed in your post today. I'm so sorry for your pain, but I want to share some things that have worked for me when I use them religiously.  The first may seem the most extreme but I found it the most useful: a low carb or low sugar diet. I've noticed that when I eat a lot of refined sugars, such as ice cream, cookies, etc., within about 15 minutes I will start having strong urges to pull that will last typically for the rest of the day. Because of that I limit sugar and have noticed a drop in pulling urges, some days I don't have any at all.   Next, I would recommend a couple of supplements that have been shown to be useful in treating OCD symptoms and trich symptoms specifically. These are NAC, which stands for n-acetylcysteine, and inositol, a b vitamin. I had a few months where I was pull free, and during those months I was eating a low carb diet and taking NAC 600 milligrams twice a day.  LINKS: About NAC and Trich - http://kickthetrich.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-n-acetylcysteine-works.html?m=1  About Inositol and Trich - http://www.wsps.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=70:inositol-and-ocd&catid=36:ocd-and-related-subjects-by-frederick-penzel-phd&Itemid=64   Again, I think diet makes the biggest impact, but the supplements are irreplaceable, and fairly cheap considering. I suggest, if you're going to try them, use them for at least a month, if not two, and to take them with food. Pm me if you need anything."
Trichsters,28h9xh,notbre,2,Wed Jun 18 21:21:21 2014 UTC,"I have been on a keto diet for just over a week now, I wonder if this is going to be an unexpected bonus! I have been pulling for almost 20 years as well, I will definitely been looking into NAC as well!"
Trichsters,28h9xh,notbre,1 point,Thu Jun 19 03:17:59 2014 UTC,"When I was pull free, I was doing <20g carbs a day. I, of course, lost weight but I was most surprised after about a month to find that I hadn't pulled in at least a couple weeks. It was amazing. It was the first time in my life that I had had a recession of pulling unintentionally.   I know another lady with trich who has done a program called whole 30 where you cut out all refined sugars, grains, Dairy, and soy for 30 days to help determine food allergies, and as long as she adheres to this diet she doesn't have any urges either. She has been pull free for months, if not longer by now. Her name is Jessica O. If you search for her name + whole30, you can find her testimonial on whole30's website.  She has been in contact with a professor at UC Berkeley who is doing studies on mice with hair pulling/excessive grooming tendencies. Low carb diets have been shown to be effective at reducing or eliminating excessive grooming behaviors.  I have also returned to a keto diet over the last two weeks or so, though I fell off the wagon during some dinners and suffered for it.  I am hoping to reap the benefits I mentioned before again. A couple tips if you're new to keto: drink broth, eat more salt, take 400-800 mg magnesium a day. The mag helps with anxiety, trouble sleeping, muscle cramps, and constipation. It is the bomb diggity."
Trichsters,28fz54,commanderjarak,3,Wed Jun 18 07:56:33 2014 UTC,"Same boat here. I find that if I shave less often and use clippers for a .5mm trim it isn't too bad. Most of my skin picking is caused by an infected gland,  ingrown hair or something equally ""annoying"". I've taken up exfoliation with an acid wash (SHA I think?) and using some acne cream to avoid infections/pimples/cysts(maybe,  not confirmed yet).   I would have a sexy beard if I didn't keep plucking the hairs out of it...  edit: For me it isn't the hairs which are wrong,  it is the patch of skin they are attached to. I will use tweesers to pull out hairs with red follicle areas etc."

I still have to get rid of a couple, but I'm doing much better with this beard/moustache than my last one.  One of the things I've found helps more than anything else is getting a little beard comb. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kent-A81T-Small-Moustache-Beard/dp/B0043DVTXW and carrying that around with me (though I think I've recently lost mine) it means I spend more time brushing my beard than playing with it, and then I don't feel the ""wrong"" ones with my fingers."

I also seem to start pulling at my hair if there's a zit underneath.  I've taken to taping my fingers while I'm at work. Taped fingers can't grip my hair so I'm more conscious of when my hand goes to my face. I've also been using a leave-in conditioner for my beard and trimming it when I can.   I still revert to pulling every now and then, so I've finally decided to see a therapist. I'm happy to share some details about my session when it happens!"

It certainly helps to have my hair shorter, as some of the anxiety associated with uncontrolled urges is taken away, but I do often find that as soon as my hair is long enough, I start pulling again. That said, everyone handles things differently, and it might not be the same way for you. While a lot of aspects of trich are similar amongst individuals, every one deals with it in different ways, so what works for one may not work for the other. You could try using the time you have your hair cut short to develop other strategies for coping with the urge to pull- a good psychologist may be able to help :)  I hope I've been of some help, feel free to ask more questions if you have any."

Trichsters,286bkq,madagent,-1,Sun Jun 15 13:53:30 2014 UTC,"Seriously? You're going to be the first? Why, because you just have so much more willpower than the rest of us or something? I hope you do manage to stop pulling, but telling people here that you have 100% confidence that you're going to be able to do what everyone else here struggles with so much is just condescending."
Trichsters,285axw,pillowise,3,Sat Jun 14 18:31:05 2014 UTC,I've been pulling on my lashes for 17 years and I've always hoped I'd rather want to pull on my leg hair. Didn't know it could look like this :c
Trichsters,285axw,ayanae,5,Sat Jun 14 19:49:42 2014 UTC,I think we can all say....we just want to stop pulling hair from anywhere alltogether :) It seems like it sucks no matter where you pull from.
Trichsters,285axw,ayanae,2,Sun Jun 15 03:59:20 2014 UTC,They can really grow back? I haven't had much luck growing my eyebrows...
Trichsters,285axw,ayanae,1 point,Sun Jun 15 05:20:50 2014 UTC,Thanks for all your tips. I'll have to try the eyeshadow trick. I actually groom my brows but they've grown a lot during the past years. I don't really like fake eyelashes because I have very oily skin and no lash glue seem to stick for more than a few hours. Instead I use black eyeliner and I think it looks fine. Most of my friends have said they didn't even notice I didn't have lashes until I told them about my trich. This is how I look with and without makeup from a decent distance. It's my everyday little makeover.
Trichsters,285axw,racheltinker,3,Sun Jun 15 09:12:47 2014 UTC,"To be honest it really doesn't look that bad to me, I think you could rock those shorts."
Trichsters,285axw,LilithImmaculate,2,Sun Jun 15 16:43:18 2014 UTC,"I do wear shorts actually! I started wearing shorts 4 years ago (hadn't worn them for 9 years prior to that). I'm just currently learning how to not give a fuck... Usually it's okay, but I often catch people staring at my legs for an absurdly long amount of time. :\  I think I hate it the most when I'm in public and I have to pull hair - I'll scratch and dig for the hair (since they all grow ingrown now) and then my leg will start to bleed. Kind of embarrassing to walk around and not realize you've got streaks of blood down your legs!!"
Trichsters,285axw,LilithImmaculate,3,Sun Jun 15 17:49:41 2014 UTC,Looks just like my Keratosis Pilaris!
Trichsters,285axw,Konalatte,1 point,Sun Jun 15 00:54:09 2014 UTC,Yeah! I've had people say that before - doctors too when they take a glance at it. Another dermatologist thought I had severe folliculitis (he had such an surprised expression lol).
Trichsters,285axw,Sawl916,2,Sun Jun 15 03:57:47 2014 UTC,My legs look like that and I don't pull leg hair. In fact a lot of people's legs look like that
Trichsters,285axw,Thisisnotliz,1 point,Sun Jun 15 01:19:48 2014 UTC,"That's really comforting to know - thank you. I've just gotten a lot of negative reactions from it in the past, it's made me pretty self-conscious."
Trichsters,285axw,Thisisnotliz,1 point,Sun Jun 15 03:55:17 2014 UTC,I asked my doctor once because I thought I looked like a lizard. I was basically told to moisturize and deal with it. Haha.  I know of some women who fake tan their legs to help even out the tone
Trichsters,282z36,KittenImmaculate,5,Fri Jun 13 20:55:57 2014 UTC,"What are you currently using? Pencil, gel, powder? Have you checked out r/MakeupAddiction? There are so many supportive and genuine people on that sub, and I have learned so much about filling in my brows from them."
Trichsters,282z36,racheltinker,1 point,Sat Jun 14 02:59:22 2014 UTC,Currently eye shadow.... It's usually too thick.  I'm not great at makeup in general
Trichsters,282z36,racheltinker,6,Sat Jun 14 04:11:16 2014 UTC,"Patience is key, watch YouTube video tutorials. Also, if you have a little bit of spare cash, I recommend Anastasia Beverly Hills brand brow products, sold at Ulta and Sephora. Depending on the severity of your trich, stencils may be a good way to figure out a good shape if you've lost sight of your natural shape. If you're on a tighter budget, I recommend NYX Cosmetics. Either way, I see brow products as an investment in myself. It does get better, it's worth the effort. I have to say that working on my eyebrows was one of he best things I ever did for myself. I felt more confident, and found myself thinking about pulling less because I was proud of them and wanted them to look great. I still struggle, but it definitely curbed some of my smaller desires to pull and pluck."
Trichsters,282z36,racheltinker,1 point,Sat Jun 14 04:20:06 2014 UTC,"I'll definitely watch some videos. What type of product is the Anastasia one, like a pencil, cream? My mom has some sets at home (also has trich) so maybe I'll ask her when I go home for Father's day. Thank you!"
Trichsters,282z36,22catch,1 point,Sat Jun 14 10:23:58 2014 UTC,"I use the newer Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade, but they have basically everything: pencil, gel, powders, etc. It's all about personal preference."
Trichsters,282z36,lurrz,1 point,Sat Jun 14 13:05:43 2014 UTC,I bought an Anastasia eyebrow pencil yesterday. It's great! Worth the money. The little marks look much more like eyebrows. Thank you for the brand suggestion!

Trichsters,27z5oz,mandino788,3,Thu Jun 12 16:42:55 2014 UTC,"Good for you!  Be aware, that the SSRI's beneficial effects may not be long term, so monitor your dosage and keep open communication with your doc so that you can tweak the dosage as required.  So happy for you, bud."
Trichsters,27z5oz,clothesgirl,1 point,Thu Jun 12 21:23:11 2014 UTC,"Do you have experience taking Xanax with trich? I'm considering trying it soon. How was your experience with it, if so? :)"
Trichsters,27z5oz,wanderlust707,0,Fri Jun 13 03:46:15 2014 UTC,"Not Xanax, but Prozac.  Both are SSRIs.  I experienced some very marginal  benefits and upped my dosage twice in 6 months before I had to admit that it wasn't working.  Then the detox side effects were so bad, it took me 2 years to wean myself off."
Trichsters,27z5oz,clothesgirl,2,Fri Jun 13 19:49:35 2014 UTC,"I thought that Xanax was a benzodiazepine, not an SSRI? Celexa is the SSRI in this situation."
Trichsters,27z5oz,Nyxness,1 point,Sat Jun 14 19:06:01 2014 UTC,"Hmm, my initial google indicated it was an SSRI and I didn't dig further.  You could well be right."
Trichsters,27z5oz,clothesgirl,2,Mon Jun 16 16:14:11 2014 UTC,"How does it make you feel?  Just as sharp, in terms of brain power/intellect, as before?"
Trichsters,27z5oz,Bmenk001,3,Thu Jun 12 18:43:29 2014 UTC,The Xanax almost feels like taking Percocet for the first time. Fuzzy but not super bad. I was able to take it at work and do just fine
Trichsters,27z5oz,alsoknownasanonymous,1 point,Fri Jun 13 04:15:00 2014 UTC,Hey congratulations!
Trichsters,27yo9q,vanillasky22,2,Thu Jun 12 13:37:18 2014 UTC,"Hmm...you could print out some info on Trich for your hairdresser, but I have a feeling that the spoken word will go a lot further in helping them understand. Good luck and we are proud of you."
Trichsters,27yo9q,_Action_Bastard,2,Thu Jun 12 17:45:18 2014 UTC,"Congrats for working up the courage! Sometimes my trich isn't super noticeable so when I get my hair cut, I usually just tell the person on the spot. I try to just say it in a matter of fact way- because that's really what it is, it's a fact that I pull from my head so my hair will be noticeably thinner when she cuts it. It's also a fact that people who pull, still benefit from trims to keep their hair healthy, so I deserve to have a good hair cut. You should decide how open you are to talking about it, answering any questions she may have, etc. I think the big thing for me is that I'm not apologetic about it."
Trichsters,27z35x,HeatherMarMal,2,Thu Jun 12 16:17:51 2014 UTC,Congratulations!  They look good!  For some reason I pull the hairs from the other side of my brow.  Mine are starting to grow back in now as well.
Trichsters,27z35x,alsoknownasanonymous,1 point,Fri Jun 13 06:08:17 2014 UTC,"Dang, that's some good looking growth! Color me jealous. I hope I have half as many active follicles left as you; I'm stuck at the no-tail stage right now. :("
Trichsters,27z35x,dankdutchess,2,Thu Jun 12 22:40:55 2014 UTC,Ohhh that's such an awful stage. I hope you havw twice as many as me!

Trichsters,27xy9q,rilliam,3,Thu Jun 12 05:26:53 2014 UTC,"I can't, but I've never really paid attention. But I can tell when people are wearing wigs from my 3+ years in them."
Trichsters,27xy9q,ProsimiansOnPluto,2,Thu Jun 12 07:44:12 2014 UTC,"Yes.  I can pick it out in no time.  Sadly,  it's not just the hair loss,  a lot of times it's the way someone holds themselves.  Then I start looking for what they're hiding. They oftentimes aren't making eye contact or are trying to hide their face.  But then again I'm easy to pick out, since I have a shaved head.  No one ever approaches me about it though,  it's as if we all adhere to the Trichster code.  Even the girl at the salon who my hairdresser introduced me to  (this is Pluto,  she has trich) -  seemed uninterested in speaking about it.  I would have been happy to help her with her makeup,  which could have used improvement,  but she said nothing.  It was weird."
Trichsters,27xy9q,ProsimiansOnPluto,2,Thu Jun 12 12:18:03 2014 UTC,If someone did approach you and mention they noticed and offered some sympathetic secret handshake would you be offended?
Trichsters,27xy9q,vanillasky22,1 point,Thu Jun 12 13:08:03 2014 UTC,"Hell no, shake away. I'm open about it.  I make jokes about my face melting in the rain,  and how if I had any hair left to pull,  I'd  be pulling it.  I've been pulling for 27 years,  so my level of openness and acceptance is going to be different than your average hair puller.  Which is why I respect the code. I can't really expect others to be as cool with it as I am,  and I don't want to make someone uncomfortable because I noticed. But anytime someone compliments my makeup,  I make it  a point to say that I have trich and explain that if I didn't paint my face on with the shaved head that I'd be on the receiving end of ""oh you poor cancer patient"" comments. Which has happened, quite a lot. So to avoid cancer pity, I proudly own my trich. You'd be surprised how many people know someone with trich."
Trichsters,27xy9q,Misstarin,1 point,Thu Jun 12 13:19:14 2014 UTC,"I can notice wigs/makeup, etc.  But that's not always a sign of trich only.  There could be other reasons for using those things. There is usually shame/embarrassment, even on my part and I've pulled for 18 years.  So even if I did notice I wouldn't say anything even though I share the same affliction.  I wear a scarf to cover patches. If someone asks about my scarf, if it's someone I know well, I tell the truth.  But if it's just a stranger I usually don't say anything about trich. :/"
Trichsters,27ttiw,Misstarin,6,Tue Jun 10 22:46:53 2014 UTC,"I pull less when I'm wearing makeup. I'm a lot more aware of it when I'm about to pull or my hands are near my eyes and it's easier to resist because I don't want to mess up my makeup. My lashes are finally growing back and I have enough to wear mascara again and if the urge to pull is really strong, I'll let myself brush my lashes back and forth or sort of wiggle them to get rid of the itch."
Trichsters,27ttiw,Roehok,1 point,Wed Jun 11 00:06:34 2014 UTC,This is so true. My lashes on one eye are in the process of growing back and I put on makeup every day (despite being allergic) just to stop.
Trichsters,27ttiw,ShittyDuckFace,3,Wed Jun 11 14:55:25 2014 UTC,"Mascara is a good way for me not to pull - it took a while to get back to the stage where I could wear it, but now I have enough lashes, I actually prefer to wear it because it's such a good deterrent for me.  I think it's a combination of the unnatural texture reminding me not to touch it as well as the desire not to look all smudgy."
Trichsters,27ttiw,pantherwest,1 point,Wed Jun 11 00:28:15 2014 UTC,"I can definitely see that. It's sort of like how some people will wear tight fitting hats all the time to try to stop the pulling (or maybe that's just my friend and me). It's like having something put pressure or weight on the skin helps relieve the tickly/itchy feelings, for me.   I don't pull my lashes much but I gently tug on them sometimes to sort of ""pull"" any already loosened ones. You know, the ones that are on their way out anyway and just come loose in your fingers. But I don't do it when I wear mascara because the mascara gets all over my fingers and clumps up on my lashes and is all over just an annoying experience. So maybe it helps you make the decision in your mind to not pull because of the downsides?"
Trichsters,27ttiw,lurrz,2,Wed Jun 11 17:27:53 2014 UTC,"Ya it's strange but if it helps I'm all for it, I cane to that conclusion yesterday as u didn't wear any and omg a huge difference, I went on a pulling spree and it was just ridiculous but I couldn't stop myself"
Trichsters,27qh7q,jillystrunk88,3,Mon Jun 9 22:12:32 2014 UTC,"i hear ya. i think that exact scenario is common, at least with me too. everything is going well, and then for no reason at all sometimes, there it goes. i get frustrated because all the 'progress' can just be gone in an afternoon or a long drive.  keep at it! i know its hard."
Trichsters,27qh7q,kittenpockets,3,Tue Jun 10 00:16:09 2014 UTC,"Welp. I was just going to come on here to look for some reading consolation/write about the meltdown I had last night. For the first time in 15 years, I finally had lashes again. Then started pulling one here and there over the last few days (went out of town without NAC, which I think really made a difference), and last night went to town in that trance-like state that I'm sure you all understand.   I read on here, somewhere, the other day a quote that read, ""Progress, not perfect"". And whilst I'm sure I've read it before, never has something resonated with me so strongly. So much so I feel like I want it tattooed down my arm! Haha  Be happy for the progress you made, and don't beat yourself up over it (though I know that's easier to say as advice than to make yourself feel). Try and focus on the strength you had for that period of time. That was a significant accomplishment! Congratulations :) And perhaps try and figure out what stressed you out so badly, and try to figure out a way to work around that. Take a walk when you're upset, do some yoga, pet a dog. I unfortunately think that we don't ever completely beat this trich thing... I think we just work on developing the strength to conquer it one day at a time."
Trichsters,27qh7q,wanderlust707,2,Tue Jun 10 01:14:47 2014 UTC,"It's amazing how quickly the destruction happens...and I like your tattoo idea, I've actually thought about getting ""one day at a time""."" My dad is a recovering alcoholic and that is also an AA mantra.  Thanks for the positive vibes and the empathy :) and I really hope things go better for you too"
Trichsters,27qh7q,_Action_Bastard,2,Tue Jun 10 01:35:17 2014 UTC,"Im sorry partner. I know the feeling. It feels so good to get a significant chunk of non-pulling time under your belt, and then it is a disaster when you relapse. Ive been doing it for over 30 years...the disappointment in yourself gets easier."
Trichsters,27n2lu,csparks1024,8,Sun Jun 8 20:06:49 2014 UTC,"""let's exchange emails."" ""let's chat and open up to each other about our issue."" ""exchange some pics."" Sorry if you're actually wanting someone to confide in, and want someone to get better with. The fact that you're looking for specifically a female, too, just says... You're probably not looking for someone to help you, not with trich."
Trichsters,27n2lu,lunaticlove,5,Mon Jun 9 01:24:10 2014 UTC,"It's sad that nobody has commented, but that's probably because you said you're asking for pictures. Just so you know and are aware, not just sitting here wondering why people haven't replied."
Trichsters,27i5j3,dezeiram,3,Fri Jun 6 21:38:55 2014 UTC,right on! i wish i could you one of those AA coins for being almost 6 months in. keep it going. :) i myself just got passed 8 months from pulling anywhere and a year from my head.
Trichsters,27i5j3,Killareapa4,2,Fri Jun 6 23:40:36 2014 UTC,Curious as well :)

Trichsters,27hk15,flegmaattinen,3,Fri Jun 6 18:01:09 2014 UTC,"It sure sounds like it.  Trich show up in all kinds of forms, not just pulling from the root (although that is common).  This is an OCD, has several treatments that can reduce severity, and I encourage you to seek treatment, since it's probably tied closely with your PTSD.  Welcome to the 'club', friend."
Trichsters,27hk15,clothes_girl,2,Fri Jun 6 18:36:17 2014 UTC,"Heh, thank you. I am just happy to have a word for it I'll bring it up with my therapist a bit more urgently."
Trichsters,27hk15,fantastic_lee,2,Fri Jun 6 21:10:35 2014 UTC,This may not be trich but it's definitely OCD and it's entirely treatable. As you know it's triggered by anxiety in your life and it would be beneficial to talk to a therapist about it.
Trichsters,27e846,ProsimiansOnPluto,1 point,Thu Jun 5 16:50:09 2014 UTC,I'm going to buy them in bulk! Do you know if they stick on bald eyelids at all? I don't really have eyelashes...
Trichsters,27e846,ayanae,1 point,Thu Jun 5 23:03:57 2014 UTC,"I have zero eyelashes. That glue from headcovers is the only one that will stick to my bald lids.

Trichsters,27e846,abrightly,1 point,Thu Jun 5 23:06:25 2014 UTC,Do you know where I can find the ingredients for the lash glue? They don't seem to have it listed on the site....I have lots of allergies and don't want to order unless I know that I can use it!
Trichsters,27ckwo,SticksandScars,8,Thu Jun 5 02:34:15 2014 UTC,"Hi there, I'm sorry you had a rough day. I know how you feel and I know how hopeless and tired and anxious and depressed you must feel right now. Dealing with Trich has been the most challenging aspect of my life and I've been pulling out my hair for 16 years now. It's not easy, but I can tell you, it's easier if you can find a way not to blame yourself. I've been working really hard at it for about a year now. It's not our fault we can't control the urges to pull. If we could, we would. But what we CAN control is how we react and how we pick ourselves up and try again. Whenever I've gone for any length of time without pulling my hair, I start to think ""oh no, does that mean a relapse is right around the corner? What will happen if I have a pulling spree again... It's been so long."" But when I stop to consider it, the absolute truth is that there's a 99.9% chance I will pull again, but does that mean I will give up on myself forever? No. It doesn't. Maybe I will pull one or two or five or ten hairs out. Maybe I will pull a huge bald spot out and I won't be able to control myself. But absolute worst, worst case scenario is that I do pull and I have to start over. I've actually found that counting pull-free days puts too much pressure on myself.  So I tend to pay myself on the back when I feel good and when I have bad days (and believe me I do) I ask myself why I'm having a bad day, and is there something other than pulling that could possibly make me feel better or relieve stress?  I hope you don't take this as me trying to lecture you. I'm not trying to belittle your situation or devalue your feelings and emotions. But I understand what you are going through. I feel for you and I hope you can find a way to forgive yourself, take a deep breath and try again. You are stronger than you think."
Trichsters,27ckwo,SchmiahMiah,6,Thu Jun 5 03:41:17 2014 UTC,"Hey, I'm from Serendipity, but someone very close to me is a trichotillomaniac and has expressed almost these exact words to me several times before. Suffice it to say that seeing this post made me tear up a bit.  Let me just tell you that it's not your fault, and you're a fucking brave person. Hardly anyone has to deal with what you do, and just getting through a year of it, well, you have my utmost respect. Every day you prove you have strength of will.  I can't offer much advice, but I really, really hope you feel better soon, and I wish I knew anything to say to help you.

But trying to be completely ""pull-free,"" even just for a day, is counterproductive for me because it leads to awful relapses like you described.   What works for me instead is trying to limit and control the pulling, not get rid of it entirely. If I pull out a few hairs, it's no big deal, and if I'm having trouble stopping, I try to distract myself with something else to do with my hands or something. If I feel like I'm on the verge of not being able to stop, I just go to bed (this is usually in the middle of the night anyways), where I can keep my arms firmly under the covers and away from my head. But again, if I just pull out a few hairs, it's no big deal. This works a lot better than trying to be completely pull-free for days and then feeling like a failure for pulling out a single hair... which, of course, causes stress, and then causes a huge relapse.   So, basically, my focus is on limiting the destructive hours-long episodes that cause most of my hair loss, rather than avoiding any pulling at all, which helps to limit the associated anxiety that just causes more pulling. Again, though, your mileage may vary."
Trichsters,279zx5,theNACdiaries,3,Wed Jun 4 08:41:37 2014 UTC,"The way you described it's effects on you, that hair pulling is no longer interesting to you, is exactly how NAC has affected me. I ran out of NAC two days ago and I'm having pulling/picking episodes again, without even realizing it. I didn't even think that the NAC would be so helpful, but it's definitely changed my life. I hope it keeps working for you!"

After 3 or 4 days of not taking it I've noticed my moods get worse and worse, but I just received a new bottle today, so we'll see if that does anything!  edit: something weird about your post, you mention that you mess with your split ends a lot. When I first started taking it, instead of pulling I would peel my split ends. But I don't do that anymore. Definitely less harmful in the long run though, haha."
Trichsters,2792jt,notperky,17,Wed Jun 4 00:51:16 2014 UTC,"Don't, DO NOT, directly approach her. Do not say anything along the lines of ""hey, it looks like you have trichotillomaniia..."" She could have alopecia for all you know. Any direct confrontation or questioning is super awkward and none of your business.  The only way you can broach this topic is to somehow talk about your own struggles and rest easy knowing she can reach out if she needs to. Saying something like ""guys, I just had to tell someone how well I'm doing with my trich right now. I actually have eyelashes!"" Let her then follow up with ""oh man! No way! You have trich too? Any tips about controlling it?"" This will always be a better conversation starter than putting this poor woman on the spot about something we all find sensitive if not embarrassing."
Trichsters,2792jt,nihil504,5,Wed Jun 4 01:38:54 2014 UTC,I completely agree! Thank you for taking the time to reply. I like your approach. Talking about my own struggles might be the solution I was looking for.
Trichsters,2792jt,dance4days,5,Wed Jun 4 01:46:59 2014 UTC,I think it's important to consider that she might not even know what trich is. I was pulling and thinking I was some sort of freak for years before I found out it's an actual disorder with a name. Just mentioning the name of the disorder and saying that you have it might be a huge help to her without anything more said between the two of you about it.
Trichsters,2792jt,theNACdiaries,3,Wed Jun 4 02:53:27 2014 UTC,"I once saw a stranger on the train go through the same routine as me, fiddling with hair, searching, finding, then pulling. There was no way I could say anything. She noticed me doing the same, we shared a look, and that was it.    The advice here is the best. It's a compulsion controlled by shame and secrecy, so the only way you can reach out is an empathetic way."
Trichsters,2792jt,adagirlshel,3,Wed Jun 4 03:09:41 2014 UTC,"I think if you were alone with her and, just in passing, said something about your struggle.If she has questions she might feel comfortable bringing them up to you. Kind of ""plant a seed""."

Once, at the height of finals/two jobs stress, I pulled a bit at the front hairline underneath my bangs.   I had other compulsive disorders already, but the eyelashes started at 14, very soon after I started high school."
Trichsters,278d1v,kittycoww,2,Tue Jun 3 21:01:31 2014 UTC,I remember the first time I pulled exactly. I was in third grade and a kid bet me he could pull out more hair our of his head than me (?). I just reached up and grabbed a wad and pulled it all out. It didn't even hurt. He just looked at me with wide eyes like I was crazy or something. After that I started pulling out my eye lashes picking my skin. Whenever I'm stressed I just can't stop. I currently have no eyelashes. :( I wish I did though...
Trichsters,278d1v,JizzBeef,2,Wed Jun 4 08:00:20 2014 UTC,"2nd grade, because my mom found a grey corkscrew shaped hair sticking out on my head and she pulled it out and I wanted to play with it. It felt really good to run it through my fingers, so I started trying to find more kinky hairs. My mom blamed my dad because he has trich too, but I didn't know that until I started going to therapy for it and she had mentioned it to my therapist.   In the third grade I had school approval to wear bandanas to cover up my bald spots. In fourth grade I got pit hair and puberty grossed me out so I pulled out all of the hair the day I first noticed it.   Seventh grade was when the pubic pulling started, and in high school it got so bad that it had left scars. Alsoi couldn't stop plucking my eyebrows so they were always way too thin. Now I'm just back to scalp pulling, though it's much less frequent."

I have been able to stop myself pretty well for the last few years, though I'll still go through streaks where I do pull.  I started out pulling from my head, but I'll also pull from my pubic area, and I have some hormonal hair that doesn't really belong on a woman, under my chin, which I pluck out with tweezers every single day.

Eventually I just kind of stopped pulling, or at least did it significantly less, until I was 13 and started pulling pubic hair instead. That's continued since, with varying degrees of intensity, and now at age 18 I've started pulling from my scalp again, beginning about a month and a half ago."

Trichsters,278d1v,GraySpade,1 point,Tue Jun 10 22:40:56 2014 UTC,"I [F] was sleeping over at a friend's house when I was.. 10 or so? And her mother found out I had lice. She sat me down and started picking my hairs out randomly one by one.  Then I started doing it on my own.  It's been 13 years since then, I'm 24 and still pull on occasion. It's not nearly as bad as it used to be (I'd pulled out nearly half my head of hair when I was a young teen...), but I currently have bald spots on the very top of my head, and at the parting of my bangs ( I know). Something about the parting of the hair does it for me, and triggers a need to pull. I usually don't pull hairs at the front of my scalp anymore, but it's been an unusually stressful and scary week, and I guess this was a way to try to deal.   I also pull hairs on my legs and pubic area on occasion, but it's not nearly as satisfying, really. The stress mostly causes scalp pulling.  Over the years it's slowly, slowly been getting better, and I have hope.. but it can be hard to deal with sometimes, for sure."
Trichsters,272zv0,human4409819,9,Mon Jun 2 03:35:31 2014 UTC,"Oh wow. I never thought of it. But that feeling... When the follicle comes out cleanly. It's so satisfying. Thinking about it now gives me chills, yet I've pulled too much today already. I like how the root interacts... It clings to things. Just the feeling of releasing it is the feeling that I am getting the entire hair out. It's... Perfect."
Trichsters,272zv0,nihil504,7,Tue Jun 3 20:35:50 2014 UTC,"This is completely unscientific and is only a personal hypothesis, but perhaps seeing or feeling the root gives a sense of accomplishment. If you remove the root, the whole and complete hair has been removed. It's a job well done to the brain and maybe that causes a serotonin and dopamine release?  I also have dermotillomania and I know I can't stop myself from picking a scab until it's completely gone, which might be the same concept of not being done pulling a hai until I see or feel a root. Could be utterly wrong, but it makes sense to my trichy brain."
Trichsters,272zv0,speckledspectacles,3,Mon Jun 2 13:39:12 2014 UTC,"I have dermotillomania too and for me it's that lack of smoothness that gets to me. Like, run your hand along a leg or arm that has a scab on it and you know exactly where that scab is. I think on some subconscious level I'd rather be bleeding than have that sudden roughness.  I never felt that way about the root, though I don't even look at the hair most of the time. For me I just pull at hair on the wrists and forearms as a nervous compulsion. If I pull one out, I don't examine it, I just pull more."
Trichsters,272zv0,flyrtildeg,3,Mon Jun 2 15:02:42 2014 UTC,that makes a lot of sense.. thank you for the answer :) hopefully we stop this soon

Trichsters,26lwg1,tripping_right_now,3,Tue May 27 14:37:09 2014 UTC,"Howdy again. It’s been 13 days since I submitted my last post about preventing my eyebrow pulling while I’ve been home from college.   While I have plenty of days where I did pull my brows, I had more that were “zero days,” or days when I don’t pull a single one out.   The first 7 days were very rough—one day I wouldn’t pull, the next would be two, the following zero, the next I’d get one…and so on. On the 7th day I pulled 3, and was disappointed in myself, to say the least. So the second week (the last 6 days) have been “zero days” entirely :) It’s not as if I was able to snap out of it. I just said to myself internally, everyday, almost every time I pulled at my brows, “I don’t need to touch my brows. I don’t want to pull them. Let’s do something else,” and I would do a different activity from what I was doing.   I kept a log of my daily progress, with the categories: Time, Urge to Pull (out of 100), Duration of Touching, What Activity, What Place, What Was I Feeling.   After reflecting back on my recording, I’ve been able to see the following trends in my pulling:   Most often happens right when I wake up, or in the late afternoon/evening  Happens very often when I watch TV, sit on my computer, or talk on the phone When I felt bored, anxious, mindless, tired, sleepy, guilty, nervous, shameful, I pulled  Often played with my brows for short, spastic durations, each lasting about 30 seconds to one minute, before I’d put my hand down. Sometimes I would pull/stop for nearly 10 minutes before I was able to say enough is enough.  Especially throughout my last 6 days, I found had pulling episodes maybe 2 or 3 or 4 times a day (less than I figured)    Although over the course of the last 13 days I did pull out 10 eyebrows, I feel as if this is a victory. Learning more about trich and the patterns I go through to pull is another step in a long path of recovery. I’m realizing that I may be 20 years old, but this is an issue I could face for the rest of my life. I better learn how to handle it now, while I have the willpower and resources to stop ruining my brows and self esteem!   I hope this update has been helpful to some of you. My advice: keep a log every day of when you pull!! Sometimes it sucks, writing about the bad pulling day you had. But figuring out these pulling and stress patterns has really helped me become more strategic about combatting pulling episodes, and I know it can help others!"

Trichsters,26ksm3,ProsimiansOnPluto,2,Tue May 27 04:19:21 2014 UTC,"Actually it doesn't, there's a distinct difference between defeat and overwhelming professionalism. If you go the defeat path, you're already setting yourself up for failure. If you are unwaveringly eloquent, polite, and cool under stress, then you won't be perceived as a target. You will be the one person who can deal with crazy people's nonsense. I've been that person at every job so I can tell you that it's good advice when properly executed. Properly being the operative word.  Of course any advice can backfire if you go about it the wrong way. This manager had been around for years acting this way, and the fact that she's still employed means that upper management finds her valuable. On the other hand, a new person who can't take the stress is expendable. She is more valuable at this point to the company than you.  How do you fight this? The trick is to make yourself useful, helpful, and reliable to managers and coworkers. Be calm, be well spoken, be known for this. Having a tantrum won't help. Complaining, ditto. Acting like a more mature adult than the tool having a shitfit at you from her home phone? That's the ticket.  Edit: you can control you, not her. Get some anti-anxiety meds if you need them, but you're going to encounter difficult people your entire career. Think of her as your social experiment. Her behavior isn't personal, and you shouldn't take it personally."

It actually looks very pretty, especially when you dress it up with a bit more eye makeup/ cute earrings.   Also, considering we're coming up on summer, you can tell friends and family that you decided to shave it off to be cooler.   Other than that, you could get a few scarves to cover your scalp. It's pretty easy to find a few scarves in the $5-10 range.   Best of luck!!"
Trichsters,26j1h7,ntogether,2,Mon May 26 16:28:37 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't mind shaving it off (well, okay, I would, but no more than I mind how it looks now; I just haven't had hair shorter than chin-length since I was 2). My biggest worries with shaving it all off are 1. Wouldn't the places I pull still be obvious because the hair there would be less dense? Considering that not every hair I've pulled has grown back in. And 2. I also have mild dermatillomania that primarily affects the areas I pull from, so my bald patches are covered in little scabby sores that look awful. It would look like I have a skin condition.  I guess my best bet at this point is to get a job and then get a wig. Does anybody know anything about where to look for wigs? Online, in person, etc."

Forever 21 has cheap and pretty scarves!   Yes it's going to feel a bit awkward and vulnerable at first but having it shaved will make it difficult to pull and knowing that your scalp is exposed may help deter the picking."

It was cheap, though, so I'll get some more when I can! I guess it'll be interesting going back to school in the fall; I'm used to having the longest hair of my friends.

(And I probably shouldn't say that; just a few months ago I was thinking how lucky I was that I ""only"" pulled pubic hair and nothing from my head, and look where I am now.)

I often felt more stressed when he didn't know because I didn't want him to actually see me pull and be like, ""wtf are you doing? You're crazy!""

I'm incredibly embarrassed by it and still think of myself in a negative way. For the most part, SO has rarely if ever actually seen me pull.

I always get bored of one hair growth area and move on to the next, so my center of focus is down there right now. I always go for kinky, thick-rooted pubes, and the ingrown pubes. My pubic area is almost in a constant state of healing because i mess with ingrown hairs and acne so often. At this moment, it's smoothed over pretty well. I've let my hairs grow out, so its like a messy forest instead of a garbage dump.  I have noticed that sebum and ingrown hairs develop more often. White spots, maybe a little.  Something interesting I've learned from my situation is that hair often grows in pairs and triplets! Other than that, fuck. I constantly think about how my first sexual experience will go down. I'm super self-conscious about my pubic area, but I'll deal with it.   Sorry you have trich."

It's called pili multigemini, apparently, and noticing that after the first time I shaved that area is what I think got me started pulling there in the first place.  I've also always worried about how my first sexual experience will go, both because my pubic area always looks so gruesome due to the pulling (especially the ingrown hairs) and because of self-harm scars on my hip that are otherwise covered by underwear. Thankfully my pubic area's looking a little better lately (mostly because I've been pulling from my head instead, so now almost the entire top of my head is bald and I have that to worry about), although the scars are permanent. I don't really have any solutions, but just wanted to say that I can definitely relate."

Then I explain I do, but not all of it because that would take forever. Ha."

Trichsters,265184,nihil504,2,Thu May 29 03:54:03 2014 UTC,I've never had a problem with this area (I'm a eyelashes and eyebrows girl) but get a Brazilian wax! It'll keep everything nice and neat and completely remove the temptation. You guys have the unique advantage that waxing your entire problem area is socially acceptable and considered sexy by some/a lot of men. There are also some creams and sprays that helps with follicle infections and ingrowns. Off the top of my head there is Coochy Cream and Vanish. I've used both and liked them.   Tl;dr wax that shit and remove the problem!   Unless your picking transfers to another area :(
Trichsters,265184,courtabee,1 point,Thu May 22 12:44:03 2014 UTC,"I have been pulling on and off since I was about 12. I pulled almost all of my hair out on the pubic mound for many years. Now it doesn't grow as thick as it does elsewhere in my pubic area. I tried shaving as a solution but I really hate the way it makes me feel, plus all the ingrown hairs. Now I shave rarely and have a pretty good system for not having ingrown hairs even when I do shave. The sides are kind of sparse though since it's where I do most of my pulling.   If you are worried about sex and what not don't be. I've had many boyfriends/lovers/one night stands over the years and not one has every said my vagina hair looks weird. For a long time since I was pulling more on the sides I was shaving off everything but the center so you wouldn't notice. Now I keep everything trimmed and it's really not noticeable even though I still pull and it doesn't grow in some areas.   Don't fret, you are not alone!"

The equivalent to the office of student life you're talking about would probably be the Academic Advising office, but I don't think they can really help with anything after the fact, just arrange accommodations for the future (and the amount of documentation they require for accommodations is kind of ridiculous, which is why I haven't received any accommodations for my diagnosed ADHD all year, because I'd need to drive an hour away and get 6 hours of additional testing to ""prove"" I have it, even though I'm diagnosed)."

Trichsters,25k466,goalong,2,Wed May 14 18:36:57 2014 UTC,"That was a really shitty thing for your last stylist to have done. I usually hop around stylists, and when I have visible bald spots, I'll mention it when booking the appointment.  Surprisingly, most know what I'm talking about when I mention trich (I think it's probably mentioned during their training, not sure if that's the case everywhere ) and are very professional and discreet about it. So I think definitely mention it when your calling /emailing and you shouldn't get any unwarranted comments on it. Odds are the stylist has seen something like it before.   On a related note, I've had trich for about twelve years, with my hair in a chin length bob for most of that (it sometimes got to my shoulders if I was lazy about keeping up with it). Last summer I got most of it chopped off so it's only a couple of inches long (Emma Watson sorta haircut) and I stopped pulling almost altogether.  So if your pulling is getting out of hand, it might be something to consider. Short hairstyles are really trendy right now, undercuts with shaved sides like you mentioned (Im considering getting a buzzcut), and personally, I've never been so happy with my hair. I feel much better about myself with it like this, and a big part of that is because I physically can't grasp it well enough to pull!   If you ever want to PM and talk about it, feel free."
Trichsters,25k466,segosha,2,Wed May 14 19:59:00 2014 UTC,"Not sure if this is something you'd be comfortable with, but I find it easier to lie and say I have alopecia?

Good luck with it, I hope you can find a solution to this! :)"

Trichsters,25k466,KellynHeller,1 point,Thu May 15 02:51:45 2014 UTC,I've had trich for ~18 years of varying severity but the last 8 have been the worst and I stopped going to hairdressers because they ALWAYS pointed out or asked loudly what was happening to my hair. It made me feel like shit. Well a couple years ago after not getting my hair cut in a few years I found a stylist who I informed of my trich and told her that I'm sensitive about it. She was very understanding and kind about it. She works for herself so it's usually just me getting my hair done while I'm there. She mentioned that she has a few clients with trich which made me feel a little better. The first time I saw her I had 14 inches cut off. And I've kept it relatively short (chin length) ever since.   I've been thinking lately of chopping more of my hair off in hopes that I will stop plucking. I'm also going to go in to my doctor to ask him his thoughts on NAC.  TL;DR; Find a hair dresser who works for herself or in a small shop who is understanding and won't put you on the spot. I emailed my hair dresser before ever seeing her and told her about my trich and that it's a touchy subject for me.
Trichsters,25k466,nauna28,1 point,Wed May 14 21:47:05 2014 UTC,Agreed on small shop. One that's not all flashy or super hip. I have a local barbershop and both of the barbers there do a fantastic job without making a big deal. Plus the hot shave is great.

If there isn't one nearby, calling up the salon and telling the people beforehand and asking if it's an issue might be a solution. I had to do that a couple of times before I started going to my current salon, but stopped when the stylist fussed quite loudly about my lack of hair. That instance was one bad out out of a hundred good ones, though."
Trichsters,25k466,shoesonmyfeet,1 point,Thu May 15 01:07:27 2014 UTC,"I used to go to high end salons, now I go to my local First Choice (it's like Super Cuts or any other small chain family haircut place). I go in with a photo that suits my face and generally say, ""I'm having some issues with my hair growth in a couple places, so I want a style that can cover the growth while it's happening.""  A good stylist will tell you if your photo idea can't be done and can make recommendations based on the rest of your hair length and type. For me, this is always gut wrenching and I feel embarrassed, but my hair always turns out well and the ladies where I go have never asked. Look for a less expensive  place that's been open a long time, return there often if you like it, tip well and soon it will be relaxing. :)"
Trichsters,25k466,Glams,1 point,Thu May 15 12:39:01 2014 UTC,"Hey OP. I met a friend a while ago who is a hair stylist. I trust her and she really helped cut it in a way to blend in the thinning sides, and gives it treatments to strengthen it overall. Besides her I seriously wouldn't let any hairstylist touch it. Find someone you trust. Seriously. It feels so much better."
Trichsters,25k466,chibistaba,1 point,Sun May 18 08:46:43 2014 UTC,"As a stylist and fellow trichster I tell my stylist before hand. I'm open and upfront with them, and ask them if they have any issues. This will give them the chance to either ask you questions, or ask someone else for help. I think taking this approach will make them more aware of what is going on. Your last stylist sounds awful, and completely uneducated. Before I begin any client I ask them about their hair and if they have any concerns to address, that way they feel more at ease to discuss and don't feel embarrassed when I stumble across a problem area and have to ask what's going on."
Trichsters,25j9af,trich_throwaway0,2,Wed May 14 13:11:29 2014 UTC,"Depending on the situation, all hope may not be lost. I've had areas in my lashes be bald for months only for them to start growing again. Give it at least 6 months, if you haven't already, since the follicles may just be sort of... shocked? Not really sure of the biology behind it but in my sample size of myself, they've come back. My problem is the lashes growing in at cockeyed angles (pointing into my eye, really?) which makes it really hard not to pull them out again.   There are also some topical agents that will help with lash growth. No personal experience with them but I've heard of other people having luck with them."

It made them really long, and oddly; the longer they are (for me, at least) the more motivated I am NOT to pull them.  It can be expensive retail, but I buy from alldaychemist or pharmacy.biz - waaaaaay cheaper."

Trichsters,25b4mn,amanangel95,6,Sun May 11 22:09:34 2014 UTC,"I only pull from my pubic hair and leg hair, actually. I didn't realize that most trichsters pull from their eyebrows/head/eyelashes until I came to this subreddit.   I started waxing my legs and pubic area so that I barely have any hair there to pluck anyway. I still get ingrown hairs every once in a while that I'll dig at for hours until I get them :/   That's awesome you have a therapist - it sounds like talking with her would be helpful for you. Just know that you're not alone!"
Trichsters,25b4mn,catsandcake,6,Sun May 11 23:48:01 2014 UTC,"I used to do this a lot when I was on Prozac. I'm usually tempted to pull out hairs in a zit or in an ingrown hair. I've since redirected my pulling to exfoliating the area in the shower instead to prevent the ingrown hairs, also it has a sensation that is, to me at least, similar to pulling, so I don't really have the urge anymore. But I used to do probably the exact thing, as you said ""digging under my skin,"" which is exactly how I would describe it.  Don't be embarrassed though, more trichsters do this than they may want to admit to it, which is totally understandable. I know how bad it can look down there after pulling, but having a significant other that is understanding really helps. As long as you explain to somebody that you pull out your hair you've done all that you can to help them to understand your condition. If they're grossed out don't take it personally, just know that they may not be right for you."
Trichsters,25b4mn,JizzBeef,3,Sun May 11 23:37:04 2014 UTC,"I pulled pretty exclusively from my pubic area until the past month or so. I started epilating the area, which has the same end result of plucking all the hair out but does it a lot more efficiently and with less damage, so that's cut down on my pulling in that area significantly. I still pull any hairs the epilator misses, but that's not nearly as bad and I don't have as many ingrowns. I was always too embarrassed to talk about it with anyone (therapist or otherwise) as well, but know that your therapist won't judge you."
Trichsters,25b4mn,Nyxness,1 point,Mon May 12 01:07:23 2014 UTC,"I get some ingrowns, but not nearly as many as I did before I started epilating. I would shave rather aggressively every day to try to reduce pulling, but that plus the pulling actually led to a lot more ingrowns. It could also be the brand of epilator you're using? Some are better than others. I have a wet/dry epilator so I can use it in the shower, and that might also make a difference. I use one of the Panasonic wet/dry kind, which are a little pricey, but you might find it worthwhile to look into them. Either way, I hope you find something that works!"
Trichsters,25b4mn,Nyxness,4,Wed May 14 23:21:55 2014 UTC,Me because my thing is kinky hair. I love the feeling and pull it almost exclusively. There's more in the pubic region.

This may not help you though.  For being in exams, I used to clamp my hand between my knees/legs (subtly or people might get the wrong idea ;) ). I would then become aware when my hand was moving. Some can go as far as to tying their hand to the table leg but I didn't.  Alternatively, start developing some sort of sequence/subtle fidget with your hands. Some would think this is a bad idea as it's moving one nervous tick tot he other but I personally think tapping your thumb against each finger over and over it a much healthier tick than pulling out your eyebrow hair.  This is what worked for me because I identified when exactly I did it. I originally just told myself it was all the time but it isn't - there are certain activities or certain anxieties which will cause you to pull. Figure out what they are and you can maybe use my examples above to help you :)"

Trichsters,25budw,palmtop_tiger,2,Mon May 12 20:35:31 2014 UTC,"If you're cool with doing this, get some fake acrylic nails. They don't even have to be THAT long, just long enough to wear you can't effectively pull out the hair. I almost grew my eyebrows back fully until the nails came off. I should have gotten them re-done. But yeah, that's what worked for me!"
Trichsters,25budw,Lemuriformesque,1 point,Tue May 13 05:03:24 2014 UTC,"If it's while you study I assume you're not using a mirror so the tape line trick won't help. Try wearing gloves or actively doing something with your hands. I find 'acupuncture rings' are helpful for me. I doubt there is anything remotely officially accupunturey about them, it's more just giving me something to fiddle with that feels sorta relaxing (and is super cheap on amazon)."
Trichsters,25budw,lap3,1 point,Tue May 13 03:27:55 2014 UTC,"Buy a koosh ball and keep it near when reading, watching tv, or whenever your hands might mindlessly wander toward a pulling site. I used to feel tension building when I would ignore my urge to pull, so instead I would stick my arms out and lock my elbows until the tension dissipated from that motion."
Trichsters,25budw,serrakat,1 point,Wed May 21 06:40:01 2014 UTC,"I end up setting guidelines. Like, I don't ""pull"" out the hair, I just sort of roll it around lightly in my fingers  loose ones will come out and that's it. It diminishes the actual pulling but you still feel like you are doing it."
Trichsters,25bij5,ThornberryL,1 point,Mon May 12 00:24:43 2014 UTC,"Cutting my hair shorter helped, headbands, tying my hair back, also having ""fidgets"" available to keep my hands busy. Recently starting keeping track of urges to pull (number of urges, situation, location, technique I used to stop). I'm also seeing a therapist that specializes in trichotillomania that I found through the trichotillomania learning center (on the side bar). Good luck!"
Trichsters,25bij5,BiscuitsMama,2,Mon May 12 01:50:01 2014 UTC,Thanks so much! It's just good to know I'm not alone. I'll definitely get hold of some headbands etc to keep control of it short term and then look into more long term measures like therapy for after exams. Thank you again.
Trichsters,254y0v,todaywasagood_day,6,Fri May 9 16:02:22 2014 UTC,"Ssris (e.g., citalopram) consistently worsen my trich, I've tried many at multiple doses.  I have to take ssris for mild depression, so I counteract this effect with low dose adderral, but most people on this sub say it makes their pulling worse.  Personally, it doesn't stop my urges but it makes it easier for me to stop pulling and focus on what I need to do.    Have you tried cognitive behavioral therapy?  I'd try that before the meds.  It's not a quick cure but it can help!  I sometimes also put pieces of clear, porous medical tape over my pulling fingers to keep myself from pulling at work in a way that does not attract attention.  A good cognitive behavioral therapist should have more suggestions like that.    Solidarity on the hand and wrist pain, I have that too, in a bad way. Best of luck to you."
Trichsters,254y0v,llucidslide,1 point,Fri May 9 19:07:53 2014 UTC,"Yea, I would say adderall significantly worsens my trich. When I'm on it I pull out a lot of hair and it's usually at the peaks of adderall where my forearms ache the most. I wonder how a low dose adderall would affect me.   When I first approached my doctor I thought she would send me straight to therapy or something but all I got was medication. I'm really open to any kind of therapy because I just want to be better. I have a follow up visit with her when my medicine runs out hopefully she decides to refer me to a specialist."

Idk we try all kinds of things like medication, stress relievers, and so on that maybe cutting hair isn't so dumb. What's the worse that could happen?

Definitely worth a shot, though!"
Trichsters,2528ky,Snapdragon86,2,Thu May 8 20:36:25 2014 UTC,"Hmmmm, interesting. I do tend to suffer from migraines so maybe I'll do more research. I've been trying to stuff myself with Biotin supplements in hopes of kicking my hair growing abilities into overdrive (my trich is focused on my lashes and brows) but it obviously doesn't help stop the urge to pull in the first place."
Trichsters,2528ky,Talia-AlGhul,3,Thu May 8 20:41:12 2014 UTC,"Mine is mainly triggered by larger amounts of anxiety, so I'm looking into treating that as well (hopefully without the help of prescription drugs, bleh). Maybe not good for people with migraines.    I quit smoking, so I'm gonna try treating it like that. See how many days I can go without pulling, try not to put too much pressure on myself, and maybe after a few days my competitive side will kick in and say, ""YO YOU GOT THIS FAR, DON'T FUCK IT UP."""
Trichsters,2528ky,Annielan,2,Thu May 8 20:49:43 2014 UTC,"This sounds all too familiar. I was prescribed Prozac for anxiety in hopes of helping calm my need of pulling but it didn't seem to do much. Sometimes I won't even realize I'm doing it, and when I finally do realize I'll even try to sit on my hands to try and physically stop myself. Or say out loud ""what the fuck is wrong with you, stop doing that""   And the whole seeing how long you can go without pulling thing totally rings a bell. I'll be pull free for what seems like a good long while and I'll notice my lashes looking really long and filled in and think to myself ""Would ya look at that! Proud 'a you! Don't fail me now!"" Then I'll have a bad day or night, and its scorched earth all over my eyelids. It's a bizarre thing, feeling that out of control of yourself."

I had no idea that you had trich too! I've been dealing with stress/anxiety-based trich since I was 13 and am still stuck in the wig phase (sigh) but I've had a lot of progress lately with NAC, GABA and acupuncture. Hypnotherapy is pretty rad too and super calming but it's a bit pricey so I don't go as often as I should. Castor oil has actually worked wonders for some of my more stubborn regrowth spots and is giving me a teeny tiny bit of hope for the future.  So many props to you for making a fresh start! I hope to do one of those in the near future :)"

I was thinking of cutting mine to do the same (it's currently to the middle of my back) it's like I have this weird notion that if I cling to all the unhealthy stuff that somehow it'll help? (it doesn't LOL) I also have the anxiety trich.  Have you tried the peripheral vision thing for anxiety? I don't know what else to call it >_> You like, put your hands palms towards your cheeks, so you can JUST see your pinky's while looking forward, you keep looking forward but shift your focus to your palms. It kind of hypnotizes the brain a bit and makes it so you're focusing peripherally and you can't really think about future/past/problems you're locked in the now. I also like it because it uses my hands, so no pulling <3  TL;DR PERIPHERAL SCIENCE"

Trichsters,24zyo2,Nyxness,3,Thu May 8 00:11:24 2014 UTC,"Have you talked to your parents about it? If you can, I'd let them know what's going on. Since you did it when you were younger I'm sure they'll be more understanding.   I also stay up super late trying to be productive but plagued by trich instead. Something I do is put my hair into a bandanna that completely covers my scalp. Even just wrapping a thin piece of fabric around your forehead and then using a hair tie to keep it back would work. Just keep your pulling areas covered. You'll find yourself touching your head anyways, this is fine. Just don't take off the bandanna.  Another thing I do is turn on some music and clean my room. It's weird, but it seriously helps. Clean slowly and take your time. Just jam out, don't listen to the sad playlist on your phone. Turn up some music that makes you want to dance or sing. Clean off shelves, wipe down windows and mirrors, just get busy with your hands. When I finish cleaning I plop down on my bed feeling accomplished. When I get on a roll doing something productive, it feels strange to go back to doing nothing. Maybe this will make it easier to get assignments done.  Trust me, I KNOW that feeling. I'm finishing up possibly the most stressful semester I've ever taken and my scalp has definitely taken a toll. PM me if you want to talk. It's tough, but you're almost done."
Trichsters,24zyo2,Snickbobbit,1 point,Thu May 8 01:58:09 2014 UTC,"I hate talking to my parents about this sort of stuff. My mom tries to be supportive, but then it's all she ever wants to talk about, which winds up being a lot more stressful. And if I ask her to give it a rest for a while, she gets really passive-aggressive about it. I mean, that's what she's like in basically every area of my life, not just mental health. Also, I'm not sure my parents really knew about my trich when I was younger. My mom noticed the hair loss, but she thought it was falling out on its own (I was rather unhealthy in a bunch of other ways too, e.g. severely anemic, underweight, etc., so my hair falling out wasn't such an unlikely thing), and I was too ashamed to tell her I was pulling it. Anyways, my parents made such a big deal about how I need to pull my grades up from last semester, and they'll be really disappointed regardless of what excuses I have. As stressed as I am here, I'm honestly dreading going home.  I don't have any bandanas here, but my roommate might have one I could borrow. I was also considering knitting or crocheting some sort of headband/headwrap or something that might help. I've been keeping my hair in a ponytail a lot, but when I have it pulled back all day I get a headache, which of course also affects my productivity.  I kind of want to just put on some music and fold my laundry that's been sitting here for days... but at the same time, I feel like, how can I justify taking the time to fold my laundry when I should be writing this paper or catching up on the past few weeks of Calculus homework? But worrying about that just results in not getting anything done at all (besides pulling out more hair).  I'm sorry to hear that your semester has been stressful too. I'd love to talk more over PM or something."
Trichsters,24zyo2,Snickbobbit,2,Thu May 8 02:18:51 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry about your parents. Anxiety runs in the family so you'd think I'd be okay telling them, but I know it'll sound so many warning bells if I tell them I think I have it too. They know about the trich but think it's just a bad habit-- not a condition. I noticed in your other comments that you feel like you have nobody to talk to about it. Your roommate sounds like a kind enough person, and I think she'd actually listen if you told her. I know that I'm the type that looks completely unapproachable when I'm working or thinking, but there's nothing I love more than people coming to me just to talk and get things off of their chest. Unless you have concrete evidence showing how little she would care, I would at least tell her that you're stressed. That's it, just that you're stressed. Or maybe tell her that if she sees you pulling to remind you to stop.  I also found meditation to be a huge help. I know that it sounds stupid or weird because I always thought people who meditated were faking it (you can't just think about nothing!). I just started getting up 30 minutes earlier than usual to meditate. I'd sit in front of this mirror in my room and stare at my face for 30 minutes. Sometimes I'd look at myself and freak out about my hair Sometimes I'd cry and be really hard on myself. Sometimes I'd be indifferent, but eventually I got to the point where I could just look at myself and think, ""Hey, she's doing her best and that's fine."" For me, meditation isn't always about clearing your mind. Sometimes it's about emptying it.   Fold your laundry. I notice on days that I take my car to the car wash I can't just go home and sit still. It's a sort of motivational momentum that I get going. The music might cheer you up, and doing a mindless task such as laundry will make you feel productive but won't be draining.   I once read this comment on reddit where a guy said ""Don't let yourself do nothing. Make every day a 'no-nothing' day. If you're looking for a job, just open a job search website. That's it. You can just leave it there. You've done something today. If you're stressed about homework, find the easiest assignment and do it. You'll be glad when you don't have to do it later.""  My anxiety levels definitely dropped when I realized that my anxiety was causing the trich and not the other way around. The trich was just making my anxiety worse, which made my trich worse. Get to the root of the problem. You have a little bit of time left in school. That's what's really stressing you out. The trich is just a symptom of your stress. Maybe tell yourself that you'll handle the trich after your finish the semester. Still cover your hair, but don't actively try to stop it until the real issues are out of the way.  Oh, the ponytail. Totally get that. I put my hair up into a loose do-rag that doesn't pull on my hair but keeps it all tucked away. Let yourself pick at the cloth; I literally tore holes in this scarf I used to wrap around my head. You gotta do what you gotta do! Keep your head up, really. You seem like a really genuine person who is doing everything that she can. Remind yourself of that often: you're doing everything that you can.  Again, if you need someone to talk to down the road you can totally PM me. I know what it's like to feel like there's no where to turn. Trich sucks. Anxiety sucks. But that doesn't mean you suck! :)"

I prefer yoga since I'm really bad at quieting down the static thought. Also I'm more flexible! I also find list-making therapeutic. I make lists of things that I can look forward to if I'm feeling down, or a list of things that are upsetting me so I can quantify my stressors.

Trichsters,24zyo2,baizoo,3,Sat May 10 07:08:08 2014 UTC,"God, this sounds just like me a week ago, almost every detail except my trich doesn't present like that.  Sleep is ridiculously important, I suggest it for sanity. Once you've gone a while without sleep, brains go a little crazy and while they function, they don't quite go back to normal until they've had rest. When I'm stressed like that, I tend to forget that there is even a normal to go back to, and until you've slept like normal for 3-4 nights, you might be like me and think that anxiety is your life now.  It's not! (yay!)  Counseling hasn't ever done a lot for me. I tend to keep a friend nearby (usually ones who know anxiety well) at all times. Literally 24/7 if possible. During those weeks where things are crazy stressful, it's a lot easier to have a person to tether you to reality. Mine remind me to eat and encourage me to sleep for an hour here or there and say words that keep me going.   In case you don't have a someone, please remember that the anxiety stops. The stress stops and the deadlines stop, whether you want them to or not, they will pass. Once the deadline has passed, you sleep and you breathe and whether you killed your grades or not, things slow down again. It's only the worst until it isn't.  You can do it, and even if you can't, it's ok.  PM me if you want someone to talk to. It's no bother. You're not a burden."
Trichsters,24zyo2,baizoo,1 point,Sat May 10 07:08:13 2014 UTC,"I don't really have someone here who I can talk to. I don't think any of my friends here understand anxiety too well. Even the friends who usually remind me to eat/ask me about it when I miss too many meals have basically stopped talking about it. I guess my roommate is the best person for me to talk to, and she's pretty understanding (also, she's my only friend who knows about my trich, which is a relief because I don't have to hide my hair when I'm in my room). But she's also not very talkative when we're just alone in our room, she's usually working on her own homework or something, and either way, she's not really one for talking about feelings. I think I'd just annoy her."

It's an impulse control disorder. I can control it just as much as a person controls their depression or bipolar disorder. Unfortunately you and I are stuck with the disorder that everyone can see.  Honestly I try not to think about it too much. But it is hard to ignore when I'm drawing on my eyebrows every morning and not jumping in the ocean with my friends because I don't want them to wash off. It is a very unique thing to have to deal with day to day but I keep telling myself that I've dealt with it my whole life and I don't foresee anything changing so I might as well get used to it.  Sorry there's no real advice here, I just wanted you to know I fell your pain."

I was doing very well with my eyebrows and now I did it to the point where i have a few sores near my eyebrow line... I know how you feel, its very disheartening to do it again after having been pull free for a while... hugs I find the best way for me to not do it is to try and just relax myself.. Have a nice hot bath and think of how I would look if I stopped pulling.. This helps for a while.."

My desk light bulb was also one of those weird painted multi color ones, not white. Sometimes you have to trick your brain by overwhelming it with other sensory info. Lots of sounds and lots of smells distract me from pulling my hair, since the pulling mostly happens when I have the ability to focus on it. I even have a couple of favorite movies that I like to play in the background, mostly classic film's British actors because I find their accents soothing.  Basically try depriving yourself of the ability to focus on pulling. Give yourself sensory overload. Instead of thinking ""I have to sit down and do all this homework,"" try instead saying I'm going to sit down and listen to this music and enjoy this candle/oil/whatever and do some homework while I'm here."

Now that I think about it some kind of balaclava might work well too. They come in lighter fabrics too so you don't get too hot.  If you have problems absentmindedly taking it off you can try sewing wig clips into it so you can clip the hat onto your head."
Trichsters,24rlt1,mandino788,2,Mon May 5 11:14:32 2014 UTC,"I remember when I first ""really"" noticed that I was pulling about the age of 10 or so. It was a super secret thing that I managed to lie about until I had a patch the size of my palm at around 14. I now realize that it has been a majority of my life. I just hit 26 a few months ago. In all that time, I have only managed one week pull free. I have been doing better the last two months but only because I have kept my head shaved, but now I am pulling elsewhere. I have heard of people having some success with NAC (N-acetylcysteine) on the subreddit, but I have not tried it yet. Personally, I think there is some genetic / hereditary aspect to this disorder for most cases. I have a brother with dermo and a grandmother that I suspect has trich. There was an AMA on here a few months ago of someone who was researching the topic. I hope he/she comes back. I wish both of you the best of luck!"

I'll also bring up another problem I find is simply that trich is a time dump, I can probably spend 10 - 40 minutes a day thinking about pulling or pulling. This is such a waste of my life and only adds to the stress of exams and I'd love to just stop but as I'm sure you know it is difficult, especially when none of my friends and family know. I guess maybe sharing with some close friends could give you a support group that could help.  Best of luck man."

Trichsters,24hgnj,Misstarin,3,Thu May 1 20:26:57 2014 UTC,I haven't really told anyone directly. I posted on my blog about it and 1 guy at work asked me about my face (beard pulling/dermatillomania).   I think however that everyone would be supportive. It isn't like you are negatively impacting other people's lives.
Trichsters,24hgnj,codhopper,2,Thu May 1 23:30:40 2014 UTC,People are surprisingly accepting of trich. Your friends will try to help. If anything she'll just feel bad for mocking it around you.
Trichsters,24hgnj,abradolph,2,Fri May 2 00:23:20 2014 UTC,"I never really told anyone. If they brought it up or it came up in conversation, I mentioned it casually. If they were curious, they asked, and I was glad to answer. If not, the conversation went on like normal. Most people kind of didn't really care or pay it much mind."
Trichsters,24hgnj,DiscoApocalypse,2,Fri May 2 05:52:57 2014 UTC,"For reference, I am 40 and have had trich a long time.  This is how I handle it.  ""I have this thing where I pull out my hair...  It's an anxiety or OCD thing that really isn't fully understood but I have it.  I'm cool with talking about it or not talking about it.  You're my friend so I figured that I'd just get it out there."".  I've never had anyone respond to it badly.  Sometimes, they ask questions like if there are medications for it or what I am doing about it.  The biggest factor on having it well received is being solid in your coolness about putting it out there.  If you are mellow and matter of fact about it, people will usually in kind - they will be cool if you are cool about it."
Trichsters,24hgnj,EtherBvnny,2,Sat May 3 00:01:09 2014 UTC,"I just told one of my friends in person for the first time last night. I had previously texted my best friend from high school about it (I'm in my first year of college), but this was my first time actually having a conversation about it. It was kind of an act of desperation, because we were getting ready for a dance and I couldn't figure out a way to cover my bald spot anymore. So I just showed it to her, she asked what happened, I told her about trich, and she was just like, ""Oh, yeah, I had a few friends in high school who did that"" and then helped me figure out a way to do my hair. No big deal. It honestly feels so much better just having someone who knows. I think if you do tell your friend, it probably won't be a big deal. Maybe you could even help her to understand people who do ""weird shit"" like that."

If I didn't pull for the whole day I got Starbucks the next day (living up to the white girl steretype, I guess).  It was hard for the first week or two, but by the second half of the month I was getting coffee about 5 times a week.   I stopped after that month because I couldn't keep rewarding myself like that (my poor wallet), and the trich stayed mild for a while."

I deal with dermatitis on my scalp and I'm testing a remedy where you cover your whole face/brows/scalp in a thin layer of raw honey solution for a few hours. If I feel I can't resist the urge to scratch, they suggest that you allow yourself to gently push on the spot instead. Sometimes this resets the nerves and it stops itching. Not wanting honey under my fingernails or on my fingers was a deterrent for sure. At first it seemed like allowing pressing was unsound advice, and it isn't an ultimate solution,  but imho it's a step in the right direction because you don't get that same level of gratification.  Since starting this treatment and not pulling at my brows my inflamed spot has healed. Now I just have my scalp to worry about. I know rubbing's not the same as pressing but I think it's still progress and worth rewarding! I would definitely be less frustrated with myself if I was only mildly irritating my scalp versus digging into it!"

I never thought about using it to help reduce my skin picking but I'm thinking about trying it. Basically you check in with data every day, and if you get too far off track from the goal you set they charge you! It has to be a quantifiable goal, so it could be number of hairs you pull out, or number of minutes/hrs/days that you engage in the behavior. Your first fail is free and your pledge amt gradually increases. They offer more intense/personalized services too."

Trichsters,24c8we,GiantJellyfishAttack,1 point,Wed Apr 30 21:17:11 2014 UTC,"Drugs are not the best way to overcome this and should only be used as a last resort. If you do eventually go with the drug route, you will eventually just be choosing between the lesser evils. The side effects or the hair pulling. It's a quick fix to something that can probably be actually fixed.  I suggest you do you're absolute best to figure out why you are a trich, what your triggers are and the best preventative measures before going through with this. The hardest part for me was actually noticing it when it started to happen. Before, I would zone out and start pulling. By the time I realized what was going on, it was usually too late.  You might be able to kick this habit by something as simple as getting something to occupy your hands when you get the urge. I personally have a ball that I just hold and fidget with when I get the urge. It works wonders. I keep telling myself ""is this worth it? Remember what you are going to look like after you do this"". Or I just completely stop what I'm doing and walk around for a bit.  Just to get my mind off of it.  I'm not totally sure on your situation. And my Trich wasn't as severe as others. But I have almost stopped pulling completely now. So that's just my general advice to you."

Whenever I took adderall recreationally my pulling almost completely subsided, once I got a legitimate prescription and took it regularly (while also taking ~2400 mg NAC/ day) my pulling eventually went back to normal and slowly got worse. After I got off the uppers, there was a minimal decrease in pulling.   Now, I'm an addict, so there were plenty of other drugs involved, and plenty of stress associated with that, but generally amphetamines will make pulling worse, and can even make people without trich start pulling out hair."

Your nose hairs are designed to keep foreign bodies (including bacteria) out, so introducing dirty fingers on a regular basis plus ripping out hairs and possibly irritating the skin (causing an open sore) just seems like a bad idea."

However, millions of people pick their nose, and there's a ton of bacteria on/under your nails.

(pp345–346)Due to the special nature of the blood supply to the human nose and surrounding area, it is possible (although very rare) for retrograde infections from the nasal area to spread to the brain causing cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis or brain abscess.  This is possible because of venous communication (via the ophthalmic veins) between the facial vein and the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus lies within the cranial cavity, between layers of the meninges and is a major conduit of venous drainage from the brain.   It is a common misconception that the veins of the head do not contain one-way valves like other veins of the circulatory system. In fact, it is not the absence of venous valves but the existence of communications between the facial vein and cavernous sinus and the direction of blood flow that is important in the spread of infection from the face. Most people, but not all, have valves in the veins of the face.

I usually draw the shape in, fill it, go over again to increase opacity, then set it using an angled eyeshadow brush and some matte brown powder.

Trichsters,241dwe,Glams,2,Sat Apr 26 16:23:05 2014 UTC,I take 300 mg of magnesium per day and while it has helped with digestive troubles  I don't have any evidence to signify that it's helping with impulse control. The alkaline water device is debunked here but I recommend a good mineral water with high mineral content. I like Gerolsteiner for its high Mg count but when I can't find it I drink Fiji or Pellegrino. Pastured eggs and liver from grass fed cows are outstanding sources of vitamins and trace minerals. When I don't eat either for a while I seem to notice a difference in my energy level and sense of well-being.
Trichsters,241dwe,jackie_o,1 point,Wed May 7 02:56:44 2014 UTC,The system I'm using is dumping minerals into the water via a filter rather than ionizing it. Closer to products like Cellfood?  The theory behind taking inosotol for trich is that you're giving your brain access to more serotonin; my thought was that Mg might help alleviate anxiety in a similar way. Magnesium helps keep you relaxed.

Trichsters,23x9tv,CindyMae,5,Fri Apr 25 03:50:32 2014 UTC,"It really depends on the person, but in my case Adderall made it worse... And had other side effects I simply could not cope with. All stimulants did that to me, but Adderall was the worst.  I love Strattera, though. I don't feel any different. I just get shit DONE, and I'm so much less stressed."
Trichsters,23x9tv,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Fri Apr 25 15:11:13 2014 UTC,"Some background: I've had trich for about 6 years with varying degrees of intensity. The past two years I've been taking mental health seriously including medication and CBT. I've been on Adderall 20mg once or twice a day for about 8 months I think.  Thoughts: I have a ton of racing thoughts, a short attention span, concentration, ect, ect, basically ADHD symptoms which suggests my brain needs a good amount of stimulation. My theory is when I'm under-stimulated (or just anxious) I begin to pull/pick. The Adderall actually makes me feel like my thoughts slow down to a comprehendible level and the need for stimulation is reduced. For me at least, it makes me tolerate boredom better and I notice I pull less on it. It also could be I'm more focused on the task at hand and don't break to initiate pulling.    It is a stimulate though and it definitely has the possibility to make it worse depending on the person. It is a relatively short acting medication though lasting around 4 hours so you'll probably notice a difference and go from there. Good luck!"
Trichsters,23x9tv,postpasta,1 point,Fri Apr 25 04:06:19 2014 UTC,"I have been taking adderall xr for 8 years now and started pulling my hair roughly 4 years ago, only really coming to terms with it maybe 2 years ago. I honestly feel like the adderall helps me focus and stay on task and without it I feel like my thoughts would be scattered and my trich would probably get worse. I also take a mild anti-depressant to help with anxiety that seems to have helped a little too. However, it is also something I have been monitoring with my doctor when we meet each month. I have to meet with my doctor each month to get my prescription and for maybe 5-10 minutes we talk about my progress with getting control over my hair pulling.   Really for you it will depend on what you and your doctor think is best.  What if you asked your doctor if you could try it for one month? Trying it out for a short period of time might help you decide if it's best for you. If you find it is making it worse or not working for you, then talk to your doctor again about possible alternatives."

Trich is kind of like static thought for me, as is trying to focus on things in general without adderall. On it, it's like a motivational boost. I'm much more willing to stay busy or get up and move when I feel the urge to pull."
Trichsters,23x9tv,baizoo,1 point,Fri Apr 25 07:23:53 2014 UTC,"I've gone through phases with Trich since childhood, never been medicated for it but the pulling definitely increased when I started on Adderall two years ago, it seems to be mostly related to them wearing off though. I'll still pull occasionally throughout the day but when I get into fixated pulling/picking phases is closer to the time to have another dose or getting closer to bedtime."

I have more eyebrow growth than I've had in the last 25 years since taking Concerta.  In fact, I'm getting brave enough to go for a professional waxing!

Anyways, I've been pulling pubic hair on and off for years, but I started on Adderall for ADHD in February 2013 and it got a lot worse. I didn't really make a connection between the two. But I've recently started taking it 2x per day, and first the pubic hair pulling got worse, and then I started pulling from my head again, which I haven't done to any great extent since I was 9 or so (I'm 18 now). I don't know how much the pulling is related to the Adderall and I hadn't really thought of it before, but I think there's a definite correlation in my case."

Now (I'm currently 23 years old) I still take Adderall and am trying to conquer my fidgeting problem.  I don't pull at the scalp - only at the ends, so my problem is different than most people on this board.  Regardless of where I pull, my hair is much thinner because of this problem and I have bald spots in certain areas.  Always looking for new strategies to conquer this horrible habit."

Trichsters,23v063,mediumicereg,6,Thu Apr 24 14:25:15 2014 UTC,"Mine also started when my parents split. Best advice I can give to any parent of a trichotillomaniac is: do not ask them if they've been pulling, do not acknowledge that they have been pulling (outside of asking about stress or whether they need to go talk to someone about it). They know. They know you know. You can call attention to it if they're doing it in front of you, but otherwise, they are already doing their best not to pull out their hair. They don't want to do it!  And definitely don't yell at them for it! You'd think that would go without saying, but..."

Trichsters,23v063,Mywonderwall,1 point,Thu Apr 24 18:42:12 2014 UTC,"I remember being reduced to tears at one point because a family member aggressively pursued the subject when I didn't understand what was going on myself. I was 11, had a bald patch on my crown, knew exactly how it had come to be, and still couldn't explain it. The best I could do was that ""it itched"" so I pulled it out. I knew nothing of the disorder then, and information was kept from me by anyone who did know. I was told forcefully that I needed to stop, that I would have to see a doctor for blood draws and other tests to determine a cause if I couldn't, and generally felt at the time like it was something to be ashamed of. Add on the normal stresses of adolescence and having this disorder, and it's a wonder I never picked my whole head clean.  I didn't know the disorder had a name (and existed as such) until a casual mention of the name by my school counselor about five years later. Never knew it was a thing; I spent the years prior to that believing I was just a freak. The internet is a wonderful thing and has taught me everything about it my hands didn't save only for that name.  Nowadays, my family ignores it. I put some effort into concealing it; while it's still pretty obvious, nobody says anything. I think overall they came to understand how much worse it made everything. One of those ""road to hell, good intentions"" situations. I don't hold it against them; nobody else they knew had a similar case and the internet wasn't really an option for them at the time.   I suppose the short version is that I wish I'd had such communication and openness with my own parents about it. I am glad to see that it does happen. Putting myself in my parents' shoes, I can see how difficult it would be, and think it's wonderful that you manage as you do."

Trichsters,23re1l,JennyK13,3,Wed Apr 23 11:49:37 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure if this will help or is what you are looking for but I wanted to share my experience with this and hope that it will help you.  I am 22 and a female as well and struggled for a long time with this same issue, just different in that I pull from my eyelashes and eyebrows instead. I have always felt ugly and not-girly due to my at times complete lack of eyelashes and eyebrows and horrible attempts at hiding it with make-up. I also always strongly believed that it was not possible to love others until I loved myself so I thought why try or I shouldn't try until I get my hair back and can be pretty and confident.  So I ended up using my whole life waiting and never having the confidence that I should have had and never putting myself out there and of course nothing resulted of this.  Have you ever seen the movie Silver Linings Playbook? It's about two mentally ""damaged"" people who find each other and fall in love and find happiness. The first time I saw this movie I didn't like it because I thought the director and producer had just ignored the fact that they were broken people and took an easy way out with a romance without fixing anything. When I voiced this view to my friend, he told me his interpretation which has changed my entire life.  It's really simple but it's amazing that in my trichotillomania'ed sickened state, I had never thought of it this way. He said that the two people didn't need to be ""fixed"" really. The story is about them realizing that they could love each other even if they had those flaws and that show of love in turn, would help them realize that they could love themselves.  I really hope I am writing this clearly because this message really made me realize that I could put myself out there and be accepting and deserving of love from others which in turn could help me love myself and view myself as beautiful.  One month later, I met a guy from a dating site that I went on just to put myself out there. It's one year later and we are in love (which I never thought was possible for me, that was just for other successful beautiful people), and this past fall I did the unthinkable and told him all about trichotillomania and he has been nothing but pure support. I honestly had a bad night last night and have very few eyebrows and eyelash hairs now, but I talked to him and we are working on coming up with a new attack plan together.  Bottom line is, you do deserve love and you are beautiful, and I beg you to not be afraid or embarrassed and put yourself out there as you. If they don't accept you, then they aren't worth your time! You will find love I can promise you that, and it will be amazing. All the best."
Trichsters,23re1l,cptrafiki,3,Wed Apr 23 15:04:27 2014 UTC,"Hey, I pull from the same place.  I hate looking at myself without eyebrows. I think I look so strange.  My boyfriend is wonderful and I was pretty upfront with him (and my eyebrows were horribly drawn on when we started dating) and now he loves to ""steal"" my eyebrows when we are getting ready for bed by rubbing his face on mine to take them off.  It's hard, but the right person will be so so supportive."
Trichsters,23re1l,ElissaLove,3,Wed Apr 23 15:30:09 2014 UTC,That is absolutely adorable. I admire your bravery in letting him seeing you without make-up at night and being able to make light of it.

To piggyback off this, it's also worth thinking about the friends you love and what they struggle with.  Think about how you support them, how strong they are to have challenges that they live with and still carry on.  Then remember that that is you, too.  You don't resent helping them, supporting them, loving them.  And you deserve all that, too."

Trichsters,23re1l,cptrafiki,2,Wed Apr 23 19:57:23 2014 UTC,"This is a very good question that many people, not just trichsters, struggle with... How to feel like a sexual being when you've suppressed that side of you for so long.   Besides your hair, do you have a good relationship with the rest of your body? ""Coming into your sexuality"" starts with understanding yourself. Without getting too graphic: masturbate. Learn how and where you like to be touched. Self exploration is fun and once you know what you like, when you do have a physical relationship with someone else you'll be able to help guide them.  As for actually getting out there and dating, it's really what your comfortable with. Do you know men in real life you'd like to be with, would you be okay meeting someone at a bar, or does online dating intrigue you? I'm personally a fan of online dating (/r/okcupid!) because you get to know about the person before you approach them, it's informal, you don't have to respond to people you're not interested in, and you can take it as slow as you want. Coffee/drink meet ups are the standard so you won't get locked into long, scary dates.  Good luck, and if you have any specific questions I'd be happy to help. You should consider posting in /r/sex or even /r/relationships. I don't frequent either of those subs but I know they've got a big user base and since your question isn't limited to people with trich you might get some valuable advice there."

One thing that has helped me feel more like a woman is bellydance. I'd be lying if I said that it wasn't therapeutic, even though I can only dabble in it while I'm a busy college student.   I have tried online dating, but I have a preference where I like to be friends with someone first and get a feel for them in person before I meet them. I guess it's also hard for me to date because I won't go out with anyone who doesn't agree with me on religion, kids and to a lesser extent politics- I can't do casual dating, so I need to know that if I fall in love with someone they'll be the marrying type, not a fling.   In the end, it probably comes down to feeling totally comfortable in my body and accepting the good things. I have one green and one blue eye, long legs, and fit into a size 2. I should focus and treasure those things.   And actually, I've been moderately pull free since August, and I'm on day 45 of being pull free right now. I look so much better than I did last year at this time, I even have all my eyelashes, which I haven't had since age 16. Things are looking up.   Thanks for the advice!"

Just around that time I finally went to my doctor to talk to her about all my issues and I showed her that I bought the NAC based off my online findings. She sort of just shook her head and said it wouldn't help me. She feels that anxiety is my trigger and by treating the anxiety it well help with the pulling. She prescribed me citalopram which helped with the trich for the first two weeks but I find myself regressing back to how I was before so I am considering taking the NAC as well.

Trichsters,23dxjo,baizoo,3,Mon Apr 21 17:21:47 2014 UTC,"An exercise that's useful to me is building up this feeling that I can overcome the urges.  There are lots of ways to do that, but mine is to try to get myself to 20 minutes of not pulling because sometimes that makes the urge subside. It seems like an unbearably long time so I start by saying ""can I make it through 5 seconds?"" and when I do that I tell myself how spectacular I am and say ""awesome! If you can do that, surely you can make it to 10, right?"" and tell myself that I'm spectacular just for waiting that long.   When the time in between starts to feel overwhelming again, I either back up or start over my counter. An app could easily reproduce that kind of method/encouragement.   Since that method might not be useful to some people, sometimes keeping my hands moving is very useful- repetitive and slightly coordination-based things are great. There's an app I use where you connect colored dots (hint: the game is called Dots, I think it was posted here before). I'd prefer the zen-mode to a timed game, though the desire to beat my last score does keep me playing it.   Maybe the application could have people send encouraging messages to other people who are struggling so they can talk while they try to not pull?  Those are all of my ideas. Good luck!"

NAC, however, seems to do something - maybe it's placebo.   I have been a trichophage since infancy though, and it's mild enough not to cause bald spots or other immediately-visible problems. Ensuring you get the proper nutrients in your diet is always a good decision, whether it'll help trich or not."
Trichsters,23c71e,PredictableChick,1 point,Fri Apr 18 18:15:49 2014 UTC,I did the keto diet as well and lost a ton of weight. Didn't help the Trich. I still have to try NAC
Trichsters,23c71e,drkfaery,1 point,Wed Apr 23 23:21:25 2014 UTC,"Absolutely! I went through a detox of eating natural foods (nothing prepackaged, microwaveable, frozen, canned, etc. the practice was unintentional, I had started travelling internationally and that stuff was harder to get than natural foods) and I saw an enormous difference. It was the first step in helping me stop completely. However it must be a lifetime change, sensitivity drastically increases the second you cave and have a scoop of ben and jerrys or candy."

It could be two devices, one that is detachable and one worn on the arm. The other device detects if the bracelet is close, and could be pinned near the problem area, so say the collar or worn as a hair clip.  But, ideally, it'd be best as an all-in-one device."

Hats also make it harder to get in and pull. What about scarves like hippy headbands? I thought about that but I dress too tomboyish i suppose. have you thought of using those fringe (bangs? British English here) hair pieces and head bands? Maybe if you attached the hairpieces backwards under the headband and brushed them back to cover the thinner parts?

Trichsters,230we7,floofy_bunny,5,Mon Apr 14 18:35:32 2014 UTC,"I basically destroy my eyebrows every few months.  Once I tried coating them with petroleum jelly so whenever my hands would automatically go there, I'd feel the goop and realize it. But it was messy and I'd forget too often.   Started putting a little of this tiger balm stuff on my brows with a stiff dollar store makeup brush. Tiger Balm is sold at most pharmacies or online--it's basically just a gel with a combination  of tingly/minty oils like camphor-- lots of Asian cultures use it for headaches etc. I only use it for this, and have the very tiny (30g) jar will probably last years.   Originally did this because I read tiger balm works by increasing blood flow to the skin and I thought it would help aid regrowth of follicles--  Discovered the burning sensation for a few minutes helped me temporarily overcome urge to pull while I'm sitting at home -- basically stimulates  (irritates?) the sensors enough to mimic the pain/fun of pulling for a few minutes.   NOT for lash pullers! Keep it away from the eyes!! though honestly for me, the more burning sensation there is, the more my mental awareness of the area keeps me from 'zoning out'. I think it would be great if you pull from patches on your head (yay brunettes, the orange/red will blend in) or most other areas away from the eyes.   Temporary fix that works for me when covering hands and headbands would not, hope it helps someone else!  EDIT: TRICH only! NOT FOR SKIN ISSUES! tiger balm (or related stuff icy hot, bengay etc) on big areas of face or gentle skin does not sound wise ..."

Trichsters,230we7,codhopper,1 point,Mon Apr 14 21:00:23 2014 UTC,"Is it okay to put Tiger Balm on your scalp? Also, is it okay for long term use?"
Trichsters,230we7,codhopper,2,Tue Apr 15 03:28:24 2014 UTC,"I would think so in moderation. It's basically just a bunch of oils (camphor, menthol, wintergreen, cajuput, mint, clove, cinnamon) but at strong concentration that gets the blood flowing --people use it for joint and back pain and rub it on large areas after exercise, and on their temples for headaches, --those areas are just as or more sensitive than the scalp.   I've been using it for over a year, but keep in mind, it's not a cure for anything, just a temporary distraction from pulling, a way to calm the urge a bit when I feel restless and crave a sensation from the nerves of that region in particular, if that makes sense?   The sensation is well, minty burning for a few minutes. I put it on when I get anxious & restless on the computer and the sensation on the skin lets me calm my hands down and type again. I'm trying to break the mental sensory relief connection between my face and my hands! Usually after I put it on and focus on the burning while using my hands for writing or knitting or something active, I totally forget and the urge has passed. If not, I wipe it off with a tissue and reapply fresh ointment.   Plus the smell, think mint tea or Vicks Vapor Rub, is naturally calming and helps me breathe, so maybe thats part of what gets me through a rough patch too?  It's about 5 to 10 dollars at most US pharmacies, you could buy the smallest bit and if not, use it for sore muscles or all the other things people love it for? Or see if you already have something similar at home, like mint oil or ointments with camphor (bengay, icy hot, other pain relief stuff sold in the us) to test if this method is any good for you. The brand doesn't matter, just use whatever is helpful for yourself!"

Trichsters,22xeln,prolalollynot,3,Sun Apr 13 21:20:27 2014 UTC,"I suffered from trich for about 10 years. I still do during some periods, and I don't view trich as something that can ever completely go away. It's something that can be maintained, and treated..avoided but the urge still lies beneath the surface.. at least in my experience.  When I was fighting the urge tooth and nail, I experienced some of the symptoms that you are describing.. think of it like a withdrawal, you WANT to pull and you feel that you NEED to. The panic and anxiety are from not being able to use your coping mechanism anymore (pulling). I had to replace the habit with something else to lessen those withdrawal symptoms. For me, it was getting out of my normal environment where new coping mechanisms were able to form.  Hope this is of some comfort, again, can only speak from my experience."

Trichsters,22v0gn,lostreddit_traveler,6,Sat Apr 12 16:18:27 2014 UTC,"This is tough. I understand, as a fellow lash-puller and girlfriend, that it's sensitive and can be embarrassing, but she shouldn't get mad at you for pointing it out when she asked you to. As for being subtle, though, a gentle ""hey"" with a smile could suffice. Or if you're sitting near her, you could do something like put your arm around her or hold her other hand? It doesn't take much for me to snap out of the ""zone"" so hopefully that's enough for her, while also showing some loving support at the same time. :)   Edit: forgot to mention that it's awesome that you're being so supportive. My boyfriend's supportive as well and I can tell you that it makes a world of a difference. Makes me feel less weird and rids my mind of those self-loathing, irrational thoughts when I'm really insecure about it. So, good for you, wishing you guys the best!"

One small thing my boyfriend does for me when I get the urge to pull is hold my hand. When I grab his hand tighter than usual he knows not to let go until the urge has passed without actually having to say anything. If he sees me pulling, he will gently pull my arm down and hold my hand. Communicate with your girlfriend and make sure she is comfortable with you doing something like this beforehand. When you talk to her about it, explain that you're not doing it because you're ashamed of her actions, but because you know it's important to her and you want to do everything you can to help. I hope the two of you can find something that works for her :)"

You sound like a keeper, and I hope she appreciates how sensitive you're being about the issue!  I have exactly the same issues with my family and friends. I love that they're trying to help by telling me when I'm pulling, but most seem to think it's ok to just yell stop it, or give me an angry/stern look. Of course this only makes me want to pull more! I'd say doing something sweet when you see her pulling would be your best bet. Maybe a smile and a kiss on the cheek? Something encouraging! I hope this helps, and thanks for inspiring me to remind my loved ones that being sweet is much more helpful than being mean."

My pulling is brought on by stress, and school work is what stresses me out, which is when I'm on my adderall.

Trichsters,22o1gv,Reasonable_Excuse,1 point,Thu Apr 10 22:13:23 2014 UTC,"See if you can get an appointment with someone else?  You are the client so you get to determine what to work on.  State that your trich is really effecting your life right now.  If you're not comfortable going back to the counseling center, keep seeking out help.  You're not alone, and sometimes just knowing that can help a little."
Trichsters,22o1gv,universalmegacom,1 point,Thu Apr 10 23:51:28 2014 UTC,"I can't go to the gym because there's no way to put my hair up so people won't see my bald spots.   You can use bandanas and nobody will notice at the gym.  There's an expensive option of getting hair extensions. There are a few types, though I don't like the ones that you glue in or bond. I use the ones that are tiny beads with silicone rings and they are sort of knitted in to your real hair. You can wash your hair and go on your way. To cover up thin areas or even complete bald patches such as at the top of my scalp, there's this powder I use called Xfusion that I like quite a bit, and there's other similar products like Toppik.  I've shaved my hair off completely (I'm female) but I ended up wearing hats and bandanas anyway. It did help with the trich for awhile, but I'd have to keep buzzing my hair down to a 0 (shaving gave me awful in-growns) and you could still see the patches if I didn't shave it all every day, plus any scarring. If I let it get too long to get my fingernails any sort of grab, I'd still pull. Also, people assumed I had cancer which was really annoying. When I grew my hair back in, back came the old behavior.  I'm 40 now and have had severe trich since 3rd grade for eyebrows, scalp, eyelashes, knees (when I was a kid)."

My sister and mother, however, are the best. If my mom catches me pulling, she'll start holding my hand. It's subtle and loving. When my sister catches me pulling when we're with a group of people, she'll say something like ""SIS!"" and I'll stop and look over at her, and she'll say ""You look nice today..-wink-"""

I think you may need to have a serious heart-to-heart with the friend(s) in question, and then if it continues after that, reconsider just how good a friend they really are. I don't like advocating for cutting ties, but if they can't understand how much this bothers you, it might be necessary."

In a quiet moment when there has been no hat stealing and you and the offender are alone, clearly and politely explain that trich is an anxiety disorder and if they want to help you overcome that and if they want to respect you, they will stop with the immature hat stealing. Tell them that it is not funny and insisting that it is makes them cruel and a bully and you don't want those qualities in a friend. Tell them you realize that they probably just didn't realize the effect of their actions but that it needs to stop now.  If they don't stop, fuck that noise and remove their stress-inducing personalities from your life."

Even after talking to them seriously about it they were just too childish to stop. They were also jerks in a lot of other ways too and this was just one of them. Hanging out with them increased my anxiety, lowered my self esteem and as a result made my trich worse. Now I have a much better and respectful group of friends who help reduce my stress levels when I'm hanging out with them unlike the previous ones. If they don't stop and it's causing you anxiety when you hang out with them you may need to find more supportive friends for your own mental well-being."

This isn't a perfect system, but the more you recognize the urge, the better you will be at getting between it and the action of pulling.  Now, what is the best situation for you to be in to not pull?  Around friends, around family, just somewhere in public?  Get there.  Surround yourself with the support you need to get through this.  Life is full of hard times, but this too will pass.  Above all, be kind to yourself.  If you pull, tomorrow is another day.  Hair grows back. It's not the end of the world- just a frustrating set back.  You're not alone in this- we're here for you.  We stand beside you, shoulder to shoulder."

Start slowly with 1 or 2 rounds and gradually increase.Never force.Sit quietly for a few moments after you have finished.

Here's some pictures of my journey thus far.  natural eyebrows/minimal picking  picked eyebrows without makeup  picked eyebrows with self-drawn makeup  permanent cosmetic eyebrows the day after they were done  permanent cosmetic eyebrows healing/natural eyebrows growing back  I should clarify: They aren't fully healed yet and I have been told that the color will even out when the rest of the peeling/scabbing comes off. The down side, however, is that I can't touch the hairs growing outside the outline because it is too similar to pulling (even though there's an actual purpose to it in this case), and it will likely mess up the permanent bits in the process."
Trichsters,21v6t5,CuriousClam,1 point,Tue Apr 1 06:42:32 2014 UTC,"I think your self drawn ones look great. My spot for pulling is not my eyebrows but I have naturally short brows so I draw them in every day as well. I guess I like having the flexibility to draw them how I see fit, and I change the colored pencil shade I use to match the current shade my of my hair. I just like the flexibility of doing my brows every day with my makeup, but it is a pain in the but and an added five minutes to my routine every day."
Trichsters,21v6t5,KellynHeller,3,Tue Apr 8 06:03:07 2014 UTC,"Thank you!  I was told that they don't typically last long (2-3 years tops), so I thought it could be a kind of interim confidence booster while I focused on battling trich. I figured my natural eyebrows would have time to grow back before the tattoo faded on its own. We'll see though. I'm not sure if they can do laser removal on cosmetic tattoos since it's a different layer of skin. I haven't really looked into it.  I've also noticed that since I can't pull at my eyebrows right now, my urges have gone elsewhere rather than gone away, so be careful if you do decide to do it. I would also talk to the artist more before doing it. Mine was sort of rude about the whole thing and kept asking why I didn't ""just stop doing weird things like pulling out my hair because who does that kind of thing"". I didn't expect her to fully understand, but I also didn't expect her to say things like that as she was putting ink in my face. I would have left if she hadn't already started."
Trichsters,21v6t5,KellynHeller,2,Tue Apr 1 07:49:49 2014 UTC,"Wow that's horrible. I'm so sorry you had an experience like that.  I've thought about getting cosmetic tattoos on my head for my favorite tattoo spots. I haven't talked to my artist yet, but he was very professional and respectful when I had him cover up a nasty self harm scar from when I was a kid. If you are in Massachusetts and ever need other cosmetic tattoos, I know where to go. There's a woman who does tattooed makeup at the shop my guy works at.  Tattoo 122 in uxbridge mass is amazing."

Where do you usually pull?      I can't seem to put a finger on what it is that changes on the weeks that I manage to avoid pulling. I've had some success over the past couple of weeks - I almost have a full set of eyelashes! I've been waking up every morning and getting stoked about the thought of putting on mascara - it's still such a treat. Still no eyebrows to speak of but at least I've got some lashes WOO!

I just really told myself not to do it one day and managed to stop and I think when my eyebrows are less irritated, I get less of a desire to do it. Right now I definitely still want to pull/rub them but I've resisted.

The first three or four months are when you experience the most significant growth spurt, so use it every night.

I just remember being in science class in 6th grade and coming to. They were all gone. Every eyebrow hair, gone.    It was not easy growing up. My father would wake me up in the morning, pull me into the bathroom and under a magnifying glass, count and document each hair.    If one was gone, he beat the shit out of me. He humiliated me and every single day started like this. I told the kids and teachers it was karate class. Haha At night he taped my hands so i couldn't do it.   He once asked me why I was doing it as he pulled his belt off and screamed IT BETTER NOT BE ME!!  You should've heard the excuses i came up w. My favorite was the mysterious biker that brought me fucking razors.(wtf younger me?)  Everything was a trigger and i lived in fear, daily.   My mother took me to a doc to talk.  She told me not to say anything.   Ugh, my god was it hard to grow up.  Did i mention we were poor too?  All this while my mother was dying and my older brother was off doing drugs or in jail.   I've learned to cope by just suppressing it, having meaningless pointless relationships and just ""maning up"". I joined the military and went 4 years without pulling.    Now, I'm about to turn 29 i have an ex wife and two kids I don't see and I'm almost back to square one w the trich.  I . . . Think . . . I'm beyond repair though.    Sorry to ramble but I just found this sub randomly.   /vent"
Trichsters,21m5lx,jillystrunk88,2,Fri Mar 28 19:11:50 2014 UTC,I've been on hormonal BC for about 4 years and I honestly haven't noticed a difference. Right now I'm on a kick of not pulling (yay) but before I started I was equally as bad.
Trichsters,21m5lx,KittenImmaculate,2,Fri Mar 28 20:04:21 2014 UTC,"I started hormonal BC about three months ago. No particular changes in pulling. For a while I thought it decreased the urge because I went 4 months without pulling. Alas, then all my eyelashes were gone in like the span of an hour (which is unusually fast for me. usually once I start pulling, I can hold off for a few days before they're all gone.)"
Trichsters,21m5lx,baizoo,2,Fri Mar 28 22:58:09 2014 UTC,Interesting thought!   ...holy shit. The timing of when I started pulling from my scalp might line up with when I started depo shots.   It's a little hazy but maybe... I don't quite remember when I switched from pills to shots.
Trichsters,21m5lx,fingerpies,2,Fri Mar 28 23:16:41 2014 UTC,"Certain birth controls can really mess with your hormones, which could in turn be making you anxious which causes you to pull. Consider talking to your doctor and getting a blood test done to check your hormone levels."
Trichsters,21m5lx,cheestaysfly,2,Sat Mar 29 02:38:34 2014 UTC,"I know there have been some studies about it being hormonal related for some people which is why it gets worse during puberty.    Perhaps that's why I started pulling at 14. I've always been biting the inside of my cheek and I had some other compulsive habits, but the hair pulling didn't start until my early teens.   You're making me glad I'm not on BC."
Trichsters,21m5lx,h0neybadgerdontcare,1 point,Wed Apr 9 21:01:27 2014 UTC,My BC did not increase my pulling at all. I think it may be more due to stress and the seasons (winter is a bad time for me).

Right before an exam, when everyone is outside the classroom door or already at there seats, flipping through the text book and trying to absorb any more information, i usually put on headphones and play games on my phone or read a non school book. Not because I'm more confident in my knowledge but because all of their nervousness and ruckus makes me more anxious and then I can't focus during the test. I end up freaking out about how much I studied and if I know anything at all and I pick and pull for the entire hour 1/2. So instead I may lose out on whatever last minute information I could have gained and I definitely get dirty looks from other students who probably take it the wrong way, but it helps me get centered and in test taking mode."

Trichsters,21gaxr,holyhesus,1 point,Thu Mar 27 03:18:35 2014 UTC,"I totally agree, and was hesitant to download it because of the price. I figured a $15 investment on a possible positive return could be worth it, but I don't really understand how it works.   There's a section for tracking your urges, and it asks what is triggering you. But for me, the point is that I don't notice it. And the ""encouragement"" section is pretty laughable. The only thing I like about it so far is that after taking their extensive questionaire, they give you a break down of which aspects of your life trigger you most (anxiety, stress, touch, boredom, etc).  All-in-all, it certainly doesn't seem worth the $15. Unless I'm not using it to its full potential? I'd love some insight from someone with more experience with it. I'm going to make a separate post with this link, but I'll put it here as well. It's an article about a different mental health app that's free!"
Trichsters,21gaxr,cptrafiki,6,Thu Mar 27 19:20:17 2014 UTC,"I don't know anything about that app but from the comments saying its $15 that sounds insane.  I use an app called Streaks and it basically just keeps a running tally of how many days in a row you do something. So I made a calendar called Pull Free on there and X the day that I am pull free. I have been keeping it since August and it has been really cool to look back on my progress and see what days were the biggest triggers.  Through this app I have been able to pinpoint that my biggest trigger days are when I'm PMSing, right before my period, something that I had somehow never noticed before, and now I take extra precautions during this time.  I highly recommend it, its a good way to keep track and always have it on hand as well as it being very simple and easy to use without advertising outright that you have trich if someone ever grabbed your phone."

I think as far as your hands, I wouldn't immediately think it's off to not have any hair on your hands - people grow hair in weird places. Unfortunately I guess it would be a bit noticeable to shave your arms, as a guy. Also it's a little high up to wear bracelets if you're trying to hide it. Are you trying to hide it or is it not entirely bothersome?"

I started seeing a therapist for the Panic and mentioned TTM because it certainly has a place in your mind. It's linked to a lot of anxiety problems like intrusive thoughts etc. Mention it, I'm on a regimen now of therapy and meds that have me pulling significantly less.

Trichsters,216ofs,Snuggle-muffin,5,Sun Mar 23 23:17:39 2014 UTC,"Wow - 4 months pull free! Congratulations :) I know it is tough to have slip ups. Not pulling takes a lot of effort and just like anything, you are bound to make a mistake here and there. That doesn't mean that you weren't trying and it doesn't take away from all that you've accomplished. Think about how much hair you pulled in the previous 4 months compared to the past 4 months. I bet it's a big difference and that's something to be proud of! Sometimes people count the number of ""no pull"" days they've had. But think about it- if you pulled 15 hairs today, that's better than having pulled 16 hairs. Or 30 hairs. Or 100 hairs. So now your goal is to make it through the rest of the night having just pulled 15 hairs (or whatever your number is). Good luck and give yourself some credit. You deserve it!"

Still hasn't done much for my pulling, though. :(  I tend to pull more in bed at night, as well. When I feel myself starting to daze out into a pulling session I kind of just take a few deep breaths, maybe sit up and stretch a little bit to ease some tension in my body, and then curl up again and grip my blanket/pillow. To be honest, I frequently sleep with a stuffed animal, not only because I'm a huge weenie but also because it helps keep my hands away from my eyelashes. I know these are kind of basic things and it's not really a technique, but I hope it helps even a little bit. I saw a specialist years ago and she suggested things like silly putty or stress balls, but none of that ever really helped me. /:   I wish you the best!"

Trichsters,20xy7v,veronicamars82,1 point,Fri Mar 21 04:53:36 2014 UTC,"Your story is very similar to mine so I thought I would share. I just started seeing a therapist (no meds just therapy) and thought some of the things we work on could be helpful.   A tracker. Every time I pull I have to fill out a line in a tracker. I have to enter the time, date, where I am, what I am doing, how strong the urge was to pull (1-10), how aware I was of the urge (1-10), how hard it was to resist (1-10) and finally how many hairs I pulled. If I am honest it holds me accountable and makes me want to pull less. I have very strong urges to pull the stray hairs that grow in. To deal with this, I have to sit in front of a mirror and look at myself until the urge goes away. The idea is that when my anxiety gets high, I have the urge to pull to make the anxiety go down immediately. Instead I need to ride out the anxiety until it slowly goes away on its own. It's kind of like a form of exposure therapy. I have to get acclimated to the feeling of being anxious without pulling. Stress ball. Pretty self explanatory. Vaseline. I haven't tried this one yet, but I'm supposed to. Cover your eyebrows in Vaseline so that you physically can't pull. Sitting on my hands when I get the urge. This mostly helps when I'm on the computer at work and get stressed out.    I'm typing on my phone at work, so I apologize if any of these were confusing. I can clarify later or add more if I think of anything.  Good luck!!"
Trichsters,20vidx,Shelbalia,2,Thu Mar 20 03:47:01 2014 UTC,"I just wanted to share on a couple things that came to mind reading your post. On getting frustrated when you pull: I am with you, sister! It's so difficult to face (ha) when you relapse or binge on pulling at any time. My main focus is just on turning off that feeling so that it doesn't become a self-fulfilling prophecy, of sorts, where I'm frustrated because I'm pulling and then I pull because I'm frustrated. Find your zen distraction that can keep you away from that feedback loop!  On people not understanding: well, first, that's what the internet is for. It's so amazing that we have this community where we can share with people who can actually (even just a little) relate to what we're going through. Second, I have been lucky enough to find a few people IRL that can ""get it."" Not anyone I'm really close to, which is disappointing, but there was a girl in my high school who pulled, too, and recognized that I did it. We were barely even friends, but just having someone to make that connection with meant a lot. And similarly, a teacher I told about it mentioned he had friends who had bald spots from pulling head hair. I hope everyone would be lucky enough just to make these kind of small connections, just mentions, really, because they made me feel so much better and so much less alone, even if they were people I didn't talk to in depth about my problems or anything. And if you never meet anyone like this in your life, just knowing they're out there is, to me, a small relief.   Anyway I'm rambling, but, in summary: Hang in there, you're beautiful, believe in yourself and know that the internetz believe in you, too. :P Also your makeup is super cute."
Trichsters,20vidx,sigmasunshine,2,Thu Mar 20 15:13:07 2014 UTC,"I really appreciate your insight and support, thank you so much! :)  Yeah, it's easy to get into pulling-mode and sort of difficult to pull yourself out of it. Sometimes, I don't even realize I'm doing it, I'm just spacing out. I tend to try and take a deep breath and stop thinking, even for a few seconds. It helps me take a step back and realize what I'm doing and that I should proooobably stop.   And it's great that you and those fellow pullers found each other! I actually knew of a little girl, a daughter of my mother's friend, who pulled her lashes and brows. My mother doesn't really talk to hers anymore and I hope she's doing alright. It started after she was sexually abused by a ""friend"" of her older brother's. Ugh. It's so awful.

It's why I'm currently missing most lashes on my bottom lids, as well.   It's disappointing to come to terms with how we look after caving in to these urges, but just remember that you'll always have beautiful eyes whether there's hair around them or not, and that trich does NOT define who you are, or even totally how you look. Sometimes I feel so transparent when I have a pulling incident, like people automatically assume I have some issue when I'm missing hair in a certain place. In reality, when it's on a small scale like this, people don't really care. They may notice, but there's a lot more to us than that and there are plenty of other things to pay attention to.   Sorry for rambling, but I'm hoping that my words help you in some way. At the very least, know that others (like me!) feel for you."

Trichsters,20g6bs,projectemily,1 point,Mon Mar 17 00:39:33 2014 UTC,"Kneaded eraser:       The kneaded eraser, also known as putty rubber, is a tool for artists. It is usually made of a grey or white pliable material (though it can be found in many different colors, ranging from green to blue to hot pink) and resembles putty or gum. It functions by adsorbing and ""picking up"" graphite and charcoal particles. It does not wear away and leave behind eraser residue, thus it lasts much longer than other erasers.  Kneaded erasers can be shaped by hand for precision erasing, creating highlights, or performing detailing work. They are commonly used to remove light charcoal or graphite marks and in subtractive drawing techniques. However, they are ill-suited for completely erasing large areas, and may smear or stick if too warm.  Although kneaded erasers do not wear away like other erasers, they can become exhausted and unable to absorb any more graphite or charcoal. In that case a kneaded eraser will actually make marks instead of erasing them.    Image i - Two kneaded erasers. A newer eraser is on the left, and an older eraser on the right. The older eraser is darker due to the graphite and charcoal dust that has become incorporated into the eraser.

Trichsters,1zy787,IkeandMikes,3,Sun Mar 9 07:33:24 2014 UTC,"I know this isn't a positive comment but it is something that helps me. Stop caring about pulling your lashes for prom. The added stress of caring about them for prom will make you pull more. Prom is dark, and false lashes work while the lights are bright, and when they fall off or you take em off when the fun begins no one will notice. Keep a dark eyeliner in your clutch or purse to fill in where the patches are but these are only aids to make you stop stressing about your trich.   Stressed when you pull, pull because you're stressed. stop being stressed about pulling. I'm 23 and pull my lashes, I hide behind amazing eye shadow and liner and personality. I go days without make up to keep my skin and eyes healthy. What's the worse someone will day? If the words, ugly, mutilated, gross, come out of their lips, it stings but I know that they are describing their personality and shallowness.   Their words hurt, but it is my body and their opinion.

Try to find something to occupy your hands! Anything, sometimes I sit on mine if I start to pull. It's encouraging to see progress and I find that makes me more inclined to try to stop myself, so take care of your brows/lashes with Vaseline or something similar.

Trichsters,1zrkaa,OsoBarbilloso,2,Fri Mar 7 03:23:22 2014 UTC,"Don't dread it, it's perfectly fine. Honestly, hardly anyone cares enough about it to be worth worrying about. The worst anyone had ever said to me is along the lines of, ""why don't you just stop?"" Usually warranting an answer of, ""well damn, I never thought of that."" Then I chuckle, move on, and don't concern myself with it.   The most important thing is to find a stylist you trust and whose work you like. If you start you  appointment with, ""so I'm a compulsive hair puller and I'm having xxxx problems with my hair right now because of the pulling spots. I'd like a style that will help me cover them some but make the rest of my hair look awesome. Do anything you want to my hair, I trust you to make it hot and f-ing awesome."" (I can gladly say I've had almost every haircut and color ever created)  I have never been judged or received a hair cut I didn't love this way. Make your hair style about what you do have, not what you're missing. If you let a stylist be creative, you'll be on the winning end. You know you've got bald spots, the important thing is to own the rest of your hair. Make it kick ass. Because if there's one thing we all know as trichsters, it's that you hair will grow back."

I'd suggest something that will keep her hands busy/distract her; if you know if she's trying to do something specific to try to stop, it could be related to that. For example, I know some people who snap rubber bands on their wrists, I tend to fidget with/break paper clips - sort of in the same way that they say smokers trying to quit should have something in their hands to distract them/replace a cigarette. I hope you know what I mean.  If she's a makeup-wearing type and an eyebrow- or lash- puller, some new make-up might also be welcome.   Otherwise, I think just anything that just is a token of you supporting her would be good. It doesn't have to be actually ""helpful,"" but if you just gave her a teddy bear and a note saying you love her and wish her the best, I'm sure it would mean a lot."

Trichsters,1zh425,jean9595,2,Mon Mar 3 22:51:13 2014 UTC,"I do something like that with bits of paper, sometimes.  Mostly with a wrapper from something.  If it's long enough, I twist/fold it up into a long narrow piece and tie it knots.  I also enjoy unrolling lollipop sticks, and folding up my paper plates when I'm done eating.  I never thought about those quirks having anything to do with trich, but come to think of it, you might have something there.  Anybody else?"
Trichsters,1zh425,allergicfarmgirl,1 point,Tue Mar 4 00:12:37 2014 UTC,I think it's definitely some lighter form of the disorder. I just kept telling myself as I was growing out of actually pulling it out that it was better and I wasnt doing anything wrong so it helped me lessen the stigma.  Keeping your hands busy like unwrapping the lollipops and stuff will definitely help distracting you from pulling. Id suggest keeping something like that by you at all times to help out.
Trichsters,1zh425,TheLastHayley,1 point,Tue Mar 4 23:58:17 2014 UTC,I do! Twist into insane knots and then pull them out :\

Trichsters,1ze4jm,starregazer,1 point,Tue Jun 24 23:45:59 2014 UTC,Do you know why it didn't grow back?
Trichsters,1ze4jm,starregazer,1 point,Wed Jun 25 13:06:18 2014 UTC,"I pulled from mostly the top of my head for 10 years. I think I just caused too much damage to the hair follicles and that's why it hasn't grown back.  I also have a medical condition called PCOS, which might be another reason why it isn't growing back. I have to go see a doctor about it to see if they can tell me if that's the reason."

Trichsters,1z8ckh,Andgonetomorrow,6,Sat Mar 1 02:03:10 2014 UTC,"First: we are not medical professionals. Speak with your therapist if you feel that your hair obsession is not being addressed by your OCD treatment plan. No one in this subreddit is qualified to give you a diagnosis (even if they are a certified professional in the field) and to do so could be harmful to you.  That said, I can give you information about what constitutes a diagnosis for trichotillomania. Trich is an impulse control disorder. The DSM-V criteria includes:   A. Recurrent pulling out one’s hair resulting in noticeable hair loss B. An increasing sense of tension immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior C. Pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair D. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition (e.g. a dermatological condition) E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning   From what you wrote it sounds like you are anxious about and obsessed with losing your hair, and any form of pulling (e.g. running your hands through your hair to see if any come out) is an act of checking that hair loss. As Criterion D states, this could be another facet to your OCD. There are definitely aspects of obsession (recurrently pulling hair) and compulsion (repetitively pulling out hairs) to trichotillomania, but it manifests itself in a different way than OCD. Specifically, for most people with trich it's difficult to control the impulse to pull out our hair, consequences -- such as hair loss -- be damned.  All of that said, the point of diagnosis is to formulate a treatment plan. It is easier for doctors to create plans when there is a clear label to slap onto the symptoms because then they can research it and speak with other professionals about it. However, disorders aren't cut and dry. It's challenging for a doctor to say ""oh, this symptom is just an unusual expression for this disorder"" or, ""oh, this client actually has co-morbid disorders"", especially when the symptomatology overlap. In the end, what's most important is that you speak with your doctor if your current treatment plan is not helping reduce this obsession."
Trichsters,1z8ckh,mouldypeaches,1 point,Sat Mar 1 04:23:28 2014 UTC,"You guys are amazing here, so incredibly helpful. Honestly thank you so much; it's good hear these things. With this information in mind the next time I go in for CBT I will ask my therapist what he thinks of my hair checking and pulling.  Again, thank you."
Trichsters,1z8ckh,mouldypeaches,1 point,Sat Mar 1 04:32:13 2014 UTC,"You are so welcome! For what it's worth, I am a (mostly) recovered trichster and I used CBT to get here. Your therapist may not have to alter your treatment much to address this issue. Good luck and try not to stress too much about the hair loss. You sound like you're actually losing less hair than the average person does on a daily basis!"
Trichsters,1z8ckh,ThatsATallGlassOfNo,1 point,Sat Mar 1 04:40:18 2014 UTC,"In my opinion its not trich, but it definitely an impulse/anxiety disorder. For me personally, I have to pull the hair out. I mess with my hair and I'll tug out the extras, but the feeling is a different world when I'm checking for strays, and searching for that one piece of hair that will make all the pain go away. However, if you read the resources in the side bar, you will find this:   Most recently, it is being conceptualized as part of a family of ""body-focused repetitive behaviors"" (BFRBs) along with skin picking and nail biting."

Trichsters,1yxtg0,Toofywoofy,1 point,Wed Feb 26 05:04:31 2014 UTC,"Hi there. I also had a bezoar removed from my stomach at the same age. Unlike you, I did not get any information on my bezoar... So I don't know how it ranks against yours. Haha.  I do think that my pulling is definitely more related to phagia(eating) than the mania(pulling) really. I do have a trance-like feeling when I'm grazing my hair for the ""right one"", but I just about always have to put it in my mouth. Never do I just pull.  Due to some diet changes, my urges have gone down a lot.  I think it's also important for readers to know that these hairballs did not come from the occasional hair or two. They did not come from just biting off the roots. Imagine all the hair you pulled that formed the bald spot. Imagine ALL of it in your stomach. Although hair is not digested, it can be passed just like anything else small. But when you ingest something that can naturally turn into a ball and if you eat it enough, you'll have an obstruction.  Anyway, thanks for sharing OP. I didn't really see other people posting about a bezoar back when I first joined this subreddit."
Trichsters,1yxtg0,Toofywoofy,2,Wed Feb 26 01:00:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, I kind of rushed to posting this because I got excited about there being a subreddit for trich. n___n  I understand the eating, I think that how I used to be, now to substitute I often end up ""flossing"" my teeth with hair, which breaks hair, but it's easier to discard and and I'm deathly afraid of root damage.  It's really nice to know other people go through the same thing~"
Trichsters,1yxtg0,hedgehog543,1 point,Wed Feb 26 04:50:28 2014 UTC,"Oh! Not a problem.  Hm. Never really flossed with my hair before not would it substitute my urges. A lot of it have to do with the texture on my tongue. I'm usually either fully doing it or not. Lately I've been extraordinarily good. I just get concerned if for some reason the trich hits with full force with my hair getting longer. When the bezoar formed i definitely had my originally thick, long, kinky hair.  Glad to hear from someone else though! Having a bezoar so big you need surgery is rare. (Doctors first tried going through my mouth and I imagine it can help some people) Unfortunately it left me with my first keloid scar so it's something I can't always hide. :/"
Trichsters,1yxtg0,kf4ypd,1 point,Wed Feb 26 13:42:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah, my scar is big but old (they did it exploratory surgery to make sure there wasnt anything else going on) so it isn't really noticeable! People will often ask me and I just give them vague questions, although I'm overcoming my habit to just lie about it and have been opening up to more people about it.  With the flossing, it's a substitute for eating the hair whole, I think. I sometimes eat my hair but I have better control on that and I dont eat huge pieces anymore, I'll bite small pieces up and try to spit though sometimes I instinctively swallow. I'm worried I have another mass but I'm 95% sure it's just my paranoia- for years after the surgery I thought my stomach would rip open at any moment lol.  Trich is a shitty thing to have >____> But I still have hope that it'll one day disappear (with  lot of work though)."
Trichsters,1yxtg0,kf4ypd,1 point,Wed Feb 26 21:58:20 2014 UTC,I didn't know that hair could do that. That must have been terrifying. Congrats on no bald spots. I'm still working on that part.

Trichsters,1ytr4p,cptrafiki,1 point,Tue Feb 25 14:36:30 2014 UTC,"I think the key is getting a color that matches your hair and skin tone well. For way too long, I was picking out ""dark brown"" colors that always looked red on me and I cringe when I look back on those pictures. A lot of my friends that I show pics of me without eyebrows said that they had absolutely no idea I drew my eyebrows on. That was such a relief to hear.   Also I feel for you with people not being accustomed to seeing guys wear makeup. It is an unfair standard. I can't draw my eyebrows on ""clean skin"" without them looking off. I have to have some sort of foundation on for it to look right.   I'm curious - has anyone ever asked you if you draw your eyebrows on? If not, then they might look natural and you are the only one thinking that it doesn't. Best of luck!"

One thing that I tried, that worked in the 1980's was an elastic on my wrist.  I would snap myself, when I caught myself pulling.  People would ask and I said the band was there as a reminder of something I needed to do.   Being busy helps.  Stress is murder.  It got a lot better when I stopped thinking.  I am serious.  I just don't care about stuff  like I used to. Thankfully, none of my kids have this compulsion.  Failing eye sight has been a blessing.  I can't see the hairs anymore without a magnifying glass.  Best Wishes, I hate this part of me and hope you can leave it behind."
Trichsters,1ys49g,wonderloey,5,Mon Feb 24 08:29:22 2014 UTC,"I got my wig a little more than 150 days ago (obviously I'm counting as I have pulled my hair since).  What let to my decision to shave my head (!) and buy the wig was simply, I couldn't effectively cover the bald spots any longer. I work in an office and headbands were no longer cutting it--nor were hats as it wasn't dress code appropriate. All this led to very stressful days, I hated the way I looked b/c of the need to wear hats, headbands, etc. and the fact that I continuously had to act like that was my style when I really didn't have a choice. I say ""had to"" b/c I know I COULD tell others but this is my issue and I should make the decision who the hell I tell about it.   Anyway, I talked with my husband about the possibility of getting a wig (always a humbling conversation) and he supported me taking this step. I found a hair replacement salon whose website mentioned having trich. client experience--so I figured there was some foundation there and I could feel less awkward. I went for the free consultation and I'm so glad I did!   They were very professional and welcoming. I immediately could tell they had trich experience as there was ZERO SHAMING and just a helpful demeanor. They tried several wigs on me and showed me the various pricing for each one. The better the wigs, the more expensive it is. I learned a lot about wigs that day. I went home and come back a couple of weeks later.   In the end I got a scalp-illusion wig that is made with real hair. It's color matched mine. It's about shoulder length (the longer the hair the more expensive as well). I absolutely love it! Shaving my head was tough but not too tough to deter me. I knew that the wig would change my everyday life. And boy it has! It's beautiful hair---prob. better than my own had I not ever pulled. The end price was approx $3000. My parents paid half. If I take care of it--it will last many many years. They taught me how to wash it and care for it--I can do anything in it. It's very secure and I can swim and whatnot if I wanted to.   Obviously, people have noticed. They've complimented me and commented on the lack of hats now.   Now, I know I had a decision to make: to tell everyone or not. Or tell some. Well this is where I KNOW it's different for everyone. I chose to continue to lie to friends and co-workers. It's none of their business to know if I don't want them to. Now, my parents obviously know as they helped pay. My husband as well. I only recently told my two sisters (who always knew I pulled but rarely talked about it as they were as confused as I was). That was a big step--telling my sisters. I think for me it was harder BECAUSE of the history.    Anyway, I am so glad I did it. It makes everyday better and best part---the drastic measure of shaving my head to the scalp as caused me to be pull free for over 150 days. I cannot believe it. Now, I don't fool myself to think this struggle is now over. It's an everyday choice to not pull--some easy some days hard. But my hair is growing in great (though I have far more white hair than I ever thought! Even at 27 haha). My plan is to let me real hair grow to about chin length and then cut it and stop wearing the wig. If I relapse--my beautiful wig is there.   I hope I will never pull again. I do not know if that will happen. If it does, I tend to think I'll be more open with others about it but who knows.  Anyway, that's my story in a nutshell (despite the length if the comment!). I wish you the best in your deduction! I hope my perspective was even a little bit helpful."

I wore hats and bandanna's for most of my school years, started wearing costume wigs in 12th grade (because that's what I could afford).  I wore wigs up until 4 years ago, when I started some really great therapy and got myself to the point where I could grow my hair out a few inches.  Wig care:  Wash, air dry, no heat styling (i.e. foam rollers).  Good luck!"
Trichsters,1ys49g,clothes_girl,1 point,Mon Feb 24 17:22:37 2014 UTC,"Cosplay Wigs are incredibly cheap to buy. Sometimes they come with free wig caps, but wig caps aren't that expensive either. Sometimes even wearing a wig-cap can help (the little fish-net ones are good for hot days) but the wigs itself can make you a bit more confident.  I have about 4-5 wigs at the moment, I prefer the shorter ones as you can trim them, but I'm not fond of the curlier ones as the up-keep is difficult. I prefer ones that aren't as shiny since they can look a little synthetic but it's a way of buying wigs that won't break the bank so to speak.  You can buy wigs that are far more expensive (and I've done so) which look amazing and can be treated like normal hair (if it's human hair) but it all depends on what you're looking for.  Personally, I now keep my wigs for actual cosplay, but when I'm a bit stressed or I've had a bad week/month (etc), I'll wear wigs on a normal basis for my own self confidence."

Trichsters,1yjy62,907WallFlower,2,Fri Feb 21 18:15:50 2014 UTC,"A little back story- From my previous posts I’m sure you can tell I’ve struggled with trich for years, earlier last year I was pull free for six months and was able to get away from the wig I hid behind for so long, and onto a one piece clip in extension, then I had a pretty awful relapse and had to slip back into hiding with my wig, now I’m on seven months since that relapse, and am finally able to wear my hair naturally again.  Another big step for me, in addition, I opened up to my three closest/best friends last night about Trich and wearing a wig etc which was a really great feeling because I’ve only ever told my husband, and my family and even so it took me years to finally tell my husband. I feel like I’m in a really good place emotionally and mentally and just wanted to share my success and encourage others to!  I do currently take NAC which I fully believe helps with the urges/triggers, I also adjusted my diet, and am focusing on my personal weight loss- not sure if this plays any part in it but hey it is what it is! "

Trichsters,1yl24b,907WallFlower,3,Sat Feb 22 00:45:15 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for posting this ! I've struggled with trich for over 25 years, and have been pretty much shamed for it, and ashamed about it, for most of my life. It has only been in the past year or so that I've managed to come to terms with it and accept is as just part of who I am and not hate myself for it. In that time I've had to open up to two separate hairdressers regarding my issue, and I was so shocked that they weren't-- they didn't treat it as though it were a big deal at all. I was so surprised by their lack of reaction, it really helped me feel like less of a freak. I hope your post will help others to accept themselves and love themselves despite the quirks."
Trichsters,1yl24b,make_it_beautiful,2,Sat Feb 22 20:40:21 2014 UTC,"Well my girlfriend knows because I cannot control my impulses in front of her. My family has never noticed or asked, but they know I have always had compulsive behaviors (pacing, touching things multiple times, OCD-like symptoms). I don't at all blame my mom for this, but she kinda started it. When I was young, around 10 maybe, I had one long hair growing on my cheek. She would get tweezers and pick it. It was painful and I didn't like it. However, after a bit that hair grew back black and much thicker. This led to me picking it and getting gratification because it is often hard to actually pull small facial hairs out with your fingernails. Anyways, I would often accidentally pick the hairs around the big hair while trying to pull it. This would hurt at first, but eventually I started getting this gratification from any facial hair I pulled. This moved to my chin probably because they are the easiest hairs to get. It would hurt when I pulled the first hair from a new spot, but the whole area would numb afterwards and the hairs around wouldn't hurt nearly as bad and caused more gratification. I have never pulled any hair not on my face. I have never pulled eyelashes. Sorry for high jacking your other thread, I have high anxiety right now and am trying to occupy my hands at the moment......"

In my high school, I was the only one and was a bit of an outcast because of it. When I went to CGEP (In Quebec, we have that between high school and University), there was another guy in my group that had dealed with it before. All of a sudden, I no longer felt like a freak because I realised I wasent the only one. I met another student that had it too and they told me about /r/Trichsters and now I can talk to a whole community of people like me."

Trichsters,1yip3k,Melkly,2,Fri Feb 21 12:30:32 2014 UTC,"It's strange to me how many phases of technique I went through. When I was a child, I would just take a section of hairs between my thumb, index, and middle fringer and twist them back and forth like a sewer's knot might be made, and then pull.  When I got older I would just yank a few directly. I remember one time I would use the pads of my hand and press hard, then swirl my hand around so it would sort of dread it up, then use a brush to rip the hairs out. I was pretty destructive at this time.   These days I just find that one wiry hair, very selective, and yank it. I had to shave my head recently, work stress put me over the edge and I've regressed pretty hard."

Not sure if that's a healthy mindset or not, but I don't have the extreme level of stress over the bald spots as much as I used to. I got really fed up with the stress and I burnt the hat I wore everywhere for years as protection. Most of the stress was just based upon fear of losing my hat. I just accept myself now. It's my problem, not anyone else's, so if they can't keep rude comments to themselves I just ignore them.

Trichsters,1ygbfp,UnicornReality,2,Thu Feb 20 22:21:09 2014 UTC,Every doctor or therapist I go to seems to ignore the fact I pull out my hair. I had CBT for my OCD which didn't really work.
Trichsters,1ygbfp,clothes_girl,2,Tue Feb 25 23:30:04 2014 UTC,"I've had great success with CBT, and very limited, short term success with the Prozac.  Paxil was the f*ckin devil, I'd recommend staying away from it.  Really, the serotonin inhibitors only kind of worked for me, and the side effects were awful.  What has been surprisingly successful for me is high doses of probiotics, but I'm also someone who has suffered from IBS my whole life, so I'm sure that my OCD is gut related.  /u/fuzzykittenisfuzzy is right, the key to CBT is thought management.  While I originally considered my pulling an unthinking act, the more I monitored myself the more I realized that I did have intrusive thoughts during the day which led to pulling at night.  With that being said, I've been pulling for 20+ years, and only started therapy for it 4 years ago.  Within 1 year I stopped wearing wigs.  The hardest part about Trich is that it looks a little different for everyone."

But yes it does manifest differently in everyone. I have yet to find anyone who picks their facial hair like I do. It's embarrassing to have a huge bald spot on my chin and spots on my cheeks. If I could pull all my facial hair rather than shave, I definitely would. And for some reason it is really hard to bring myself to shave. Often if I can get myself to shave, I will compulsively pick the hairs I missed, and if I can't find or get any hairs, I get extremely frustrated and my anxiety goes insane.... At least head hair pickets can wear a hat. Most people just think my facial hair grows funny, but I often get ""dude wtf why did you only shave your chin""?"

Trichsters,1ygbfp,Amisl17,1 point,Sun Feb 23 18:24:20 2014 UTC,"While I haven't had experience CBT, I was put on Prozac when I was 11 or 12 and it was the most devastating time in my life. It didn't really help with my anxiety and it gave me mild depression and I cut myself, which led me to going to a psychiatrist. However, that was about ten years ago when there wasn't much research on trichotillomania. I also do not think I should've been put on such a medication at that age, but I digress.   Honestly I think that certain medications and behavioral therapy may work for some and not others; everyone may react differently depending on how their brain reacts to certain chemicals. Even though I reacted negatively to Prozac, that doesn't mean someone else with Trich will experience the same results. I think I've seen a lot of trial and error with trichotillomania, and some people (like myself) have not found what exactly works yet. I hope this helps somewhat!"

The honest answer is, there's nothing to replace it really that isn't equally destructive in one way or another. I used to poke my skin with needles to keep from pulling that spot, but that's not any better. The best trick I know is to ice the spot that's bothering you. Reduce the blood flow, relax the nerves in that spot, and make the pulling not so pleasurable. If you can't feel it, what's the point? That's about as good as I've figured out, and I've been pulling for 26 years. Well, ice and Ativan/Klonopin. They really help with the anxiety and keep me from noticing the urge to pull."

Trichsters,1xoun6,pullasaur,4,Wed Feb 12 06:51:06 2014 UTC,"i used to have several bald spots and then i changed the way I parted my hair which made a world of difference. Not only did it look better, but it actually helped reduce the urge to pull from the spot that I normally chose. Its been about two years now and in comparison with the length of my hair (its long, almost to my butt!) there are noticeable shorter pieces. The longer the pieces get the easier they are to disguise by straightening them, pinning them, gel... Anyway, point is hang in there! The progress of your former bald spot is a gratifying reminder that you have better self control now and its motivation not to pull more. And changing your part might really help."
Trichsters,1xoun6,crisis_cakes,2,Wed Feb 12 15:44:59 2014 UTC,"The progress of your former bald spot is a gratifying reminder that you have better self control now and its motivation not to pull more.  Yes! While the crazy little hairs are kind of annoying and not super attractive, they are a good reminder of my progress. I really don't want to ruin the improvement I've made so seeing that growth is helpful (when I'm not frustrated by it lol). I think changing my part is a good idea. If I do, it will help cover the weird spot and it will keep the spot I used to pull from inaccessible. Usually when I pulled it was around a particular section of the part because for some reason the hairs came out very easily there."
Trichsters,1xoun6,ThatsATallGlassOfNo,3,Wed Feb 12 16:42:22 2014 UTC,"My suggestion is to start styling with a side part.  It will probably start sticking up once it dries so use a little bit of product(hairspray, gel) to kind of pat it down and make it heavier. Once it grows out a little more it will start to sit flat on it's own.   You could also pin your bangs back like this but less exaggerated."
Trichsters,1xoun6,flyingpanda32,2,Fri Feb 14 16:43:50 2014 UTC,"I had a huge bald spot right on my crown when I was about 11-13 but I wasn't able to wear a hat to cover it up at school-- no way was I gonna let my middle school classmates see my self-induced bald spot. So I started parting my hair a little deeper on the side of my head and invested in a bunch of bobby pins and cute hair clips to make sure my combed over hair stayed in place. My hair was a bit shorter than shoulder-length and very fine and was generally cooperative in staying how I styled it. On days it wouldn't stay put, I would backcomb and tease the piece of hair that was covering the bald spot to give it some body and use a little hairspray to keep it in place. If you're open to coloring your hair you can also bleach/dye it to a lighter color so the contrast between it and your scalp is less dramatic. In addition to styling my hair as I described, I bleached it platinum blonde to diminish the starkness of my pink/light scalp.   I hope this is something you can do to help you move along with your life :) I totally understand how stressful college can be and your trich should be the last thing on your mind. There are way more important things to concern yourself with, like making friends or bitching about dining hall food."
Trichsters,1xoun6,flyingpanda32,1 point,Wed Feb 12 08:51:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the idea! :) I've thought about parting my hair a little deeper before. My hair can be kind of wavy and unruly with a mind of its own at times, but today when I woke up it was being fairly cooperative. I'm not super skilled with pins and clips but I like the idea of using some cute hair clips! I love cute little accessories like that so I may be motivated to learn ;) Today I just put the rest of my hair back in to a pony tail after I parted the top and I think it worked out ok. I actually got a compliment from someone today on my ""new"" hair style, so that made me feel pretty good :D Thank you so much for the inspiration!"
Trichsters,1xoun6,LavenderZombie,2,Wed Feb 12 16:33:15 2014 UTC,If you're a ponytail type you can also try headbands!
Trichsters,1xoun6,LavenderZombie,2,Wed Feb 12 22:37:55 2014 UTC,"I did this every day for about 4 years -pulling the hair from the very front of my head to the back trapped most of the hairs, and bobby pins worked to keep any springy bits down. It did mean I had all my hair scraped away from my face every single day, which got boring, but at least it was hidden :)"

What did you do with your bangs? Did you pull them back too or do something else? I'm not sure that mine are long enough to fully pull back."
Trichsters,1xoun6,floofy_bunny,2,Wed Feb 12 16:36:28 2014 UTC,"I didn't have any at the time! You could probably pull them back or leave them down, it depends on the style."
Trichsters,1xoun6,Oreosmooshy,2,Wed Feb 12 18:15:42 2014 UTC,"You could also try twisting or braiding them into the rest of your hair to keep them in place and mix it up a little! Also, never underestimate the power of a simple ponytail/bun!!!! They're quick and easy and I, for one, pull a lot less when my hair is back and out of the way and harder to ""get"" to! I'd also suggest poking around on YouTube for hair tutorials and picking out ones that will work toward hiding specific areas; I highly recommend this channel -- she's amazing! I find putting in time to style my hair is really therapeutic, as it gives me an ""excuse"" to touch my hair a lot and, once I'm finished and have it looking the way I want it, incentive to not mess with it! Hope this helps -- good luck!!!!"
Trichsters,1xoun6,Oreosmooshy,2,Sun Mar 2 02:00:14 2014 UTC,I have this problem too. Really strong hairspray helps to keep it from sticking up. Or if it's mostly in one place you could change the parting in your hair. Hoping that someone else has a better answer because I'd like to know too!
Trichsters,1xoun6,PresidentRaggy,2,Wed Feb 12 20:39:14 2014 UTC,I have a bunch of bald spots and the only way for me to cover them all is to carefully put my hair in a ponytail and then hairspray/brush the short ones down.
Trichsters,1xo2jo,emylime,3,Wed Feb 12 01:42:38 2014 UTC,"Knitting has helped me a bit, or maybe silly putty? Anything to keep your hands busy! I started painting more, and I also paint my nails often because I can't put my fingers in my hair when my nails are wet."

Trichsters,1xlnir,MissSpookiness,4,Tue Feb 11 09:28:09 2014 UTC,"No need to apologize, OP.  I think all trichsters can relate to the myriad feelings that come from discovering you're not alone.  Talking about this helps! So, don't feel badly about sharing your experience. I've been pulling (technically, I obsessively split my ends. OBSESSIVELY) since I was 12 years old. When I was 19, a college therapist diagnosed me and I remember feeling a huge sense of relief at the fact that I wasn't the only one.  I'm 34 now, and I still struggle, but I don't let the fact that I've been dealing with this for so long dishearten me. I've had good points and bad points w my trich, but acknowledgment and validation ( i.e. talking about it and knowing I'm not alone/crazy)  have been super helpful. So keep posting! The community in this subreddit is supportive and helpful. Good luck!"
Trichsters,1xkg20,courtneyj,3,Tue Feb 11 00:35:06 2014 UTC,Thanks for posting this. Always been curious if that would make me stop pulling or exacerbate it.
Trichsters,1xkg20,YellowFeatheredNurse,2,Tue Feb 11 08:29:27 2014 UTC,Me too. I think it's very beautiful but it does not have to be triggering.
Trichsters,1xkznu,trichaddict,2,Tue Feb 11 03:47:29 2014 UTC,"My mom helped a lot with this when I first started working in corporate.  She bought me a bunch of magnetic toys I could play with, stack, organize, whatever when I needed to occupy my hands.  I was a customer service rep, so there was lots of work on the phone (hands free, then) or waiting for the phone to ring (so definitely hands unoccupied).  Here's a couple Mom found for me: http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Whack-BOW30-Ball-Whacks/dp/0911121013/ http://www.amazon.com/American-Science-Surplus-XB60-Magnetic/dp/0911121064/ http://www.amazon.com/Tegu-Tints-Pocket-Pouch-Piece/dp/B004WMCZGY/  Play-Doh was great, too -- and cheap.  And I got super proficient at an old Etch-A-Sketch.  I wonder if a stress ball would work too -- if you're working with one hand and squeezing with the other, then you'd have both occupied."
Trichsters,1xkznu,OneHasLepers,1 point,Tue Feb 11 04:17:36 2014 UTC,"The fiddle toys are a good idea, I have a Tangle. Spinner rings are another option. It also helped me to keep track of my pulling by forcing myself to put a tally down for each hair as soon as I pull one. I used to just use a sticky note to do this, to be more discreet I would have a blank sticky note on top of the one I would write my tally on for each day. Now I use a phone app to track it."
Trichsters,1xkznu,Puffalump,1 point,Tue Feb 11 10:53:49 2014 UTC,"I don't have a desk job or so but I always bring with me thin cotton gloves when I study. If I notice that I have a lot of urges, I just put them on.  If anyone asks, you can always just say that your hands are cold or that you are moisturising them.   The cotton gloves that i have are the ones that you can buy in pharmacies for moisture or eczema. I used to have ordinary ones but felt that they were too thick and warm and itched when I got sweaty.   It works well so far provided I actually wear them. Pulling with them on doesn't have the same feeling and I can write and type while I wear them. I also use them when I read (huge riskzone) but it has become a bit problematic because I'm reading a lot on my tablet or phone these days and the gloves aren't compatible with touchscreen :-\"

It's easy to hide and remove quickly, doesn't make my hands sweat and does not significantly impact dexterity.

Trichsters,1xkznu,PresidentRaggy,1 point,Thu Feb 13 04:32:33 2014 UTC,"I lose myself in hair pulling some days at work. It is a distraction from doing the mundane tasks I am not in the mood to complete. Thankfully I sit alone on my side of an open office setting, so no one can see me pull. I get depressed when I look in my trash can and see so many strands. I tried keeping tallies of each hair that I pulled, to slow myself down or guilt myself in to stopping...but sometimes I just zone out and completely don't realize how many I have pulled."
Trichsters,1xkznu,CuriousClam,1 point,Tue Apr 8 06:34:14 2014 UTC,"Sitting at a desk all day has been a nightmare for pulling, and I found that the constant pulling was making my anxiety so much worse and I would just pull more. I tried all sorts of things: band aids on my fingers (worked, but super expensive and I couldn't type as well), gloves (I would just take them off subconsciously), stress balls works while I was actively thinking about it, but the second I lost my concentration the pulling started back up. In the end I decided to go back to wearing a wig while at work. I had worn them in the past when I did a head shave. I have now even started wearing the wig around the house because I will pull around hats and I find that the full head coverage of the wig makes me not want to/incapable of pulling."
Trichsters,1xby4y,myaltacctisthisone,6,Sat Feb 8 04:04:42 2014 UTC,"sorry this is so graphic.  It still grosses me out to look at it sometimes... but other times looking at it, and 'reading' it in order gives me the same feeling as if I'd actually done what I drew.  so I thought it might be worth sharing, gross as it may be.  backstory for the leading-up panels is a little complicated.  I was diagnosed with celiac disease and strong-armed into moving back home from grad school for the semester (back on my own now, hallelujah) and hated everything about it and myself.  I mean, not that I don't still now.. but yeah, just please don't talk to me about food.  anyways, the panels:   had to share a room for the first time in years and couldn't sleep. which is unusual, for me, and meant I was a zombie the next couple days 10/24 had a meeting with a nutritionist and had to talk about my eating habits in front of my family.  it was very stressful and embarrassing for me because 1) still hated everything about food at that point, and 2) after some things my parents had told me I did NOT want them listening in on that 10/25 had to go to a banquet (parents, again, given no choice in the matter. I would've gladly stayed home). knew in advance there would be basically nothing I could eat, and surprise! there wasn't. it was a thoroughly miserable night watching everyone else eat steak and cheesecake and thinking this is my life now and forever more 10/26 after the preceding lovely experiences (oh, and a morning spent talking about EVEN MORE stupid food junk with a caterer for my sister's upcoming wedding) I was sitting in my room texting my boyfriend and feeling gross about everything.  mom comes in and lectures me to stop being unhappy and get over it already. so, of course, that was super helpful   the rest as you can probably guess was my routine at home. so that's the story!  thanks for letting me vent."
Trichsters,1xby4y,codhopper,3,Sat Feb 8 04:28:33 2014 UTC,"I like how gross this is because it's honest.  This is what we do to ourselves, and sometimes we don't realize it while we're doing it, so it helps to have something to give us an outside perspective."

Trichsters,1x1dzv,emylime,5,Wed Feb 5 01:13:01 2014 UTC,"I know what you mean...A lot of times you pull without meaning to. What I would do is explain to the child that it is a bad habit and should never be done. Then explain that we love our bodies and don't want to hurt ourselves. If he pulls your hair say"" OW THAT HURTS...we don't do that to people"" Honestly it might just be a thing he did before he even knew you were doing it, a lot of kids do. I would try very very hard to not let him ever see you do this again though."
Trichsters,1x1dzv,mec05160,2,Wed Feb 5 03:57:11 2014 UTC,"I know how you feel. Its on odd phenomenon too, because as a pure eyelash puller, somehow my sister got the impulse at a very young age to pick her eyebrows"
Trichsters,1x1dzv,RadioActyve,1 point,Wed Feb 5 13:28:12 2014 UTC,"This may not resonate with everyone, but I don't believe trich is contagious at all. Maybe to some small degree kids are impressionable with behavioral quirks but if you buy into that trich is an impulse control problem aka OCD, well, how many other OCD's have you seen transfer just from observation?   I've had trich my whole life, none of my siblings or other family has it. I seriously doubt you're the reason why they pull their hair. If you're genuinely concerned for the kiddos I would talk to their parents, they may be able to correct he behavior early and save them a lifetime of frustration."

Trichsters,1x1dzv,Mywonderwall,1 point,Wed Feb 5 16:48:31 2014 UTC,I know how you feel. I babysit my niece a lot and noticed that she has sometimes played with her hair like me.

Trichsters,1x169a,BridgetC,3,Tue Feb 4 23:59:09 2014 UTC,"Yes, I have used it. It works very well (ie, people complemented me on my lashes, and they were long and thick). I recently quit using it, but I'm starting to use it again after noticing the difference.  It doesn't help me quit pulling as much as it helps me keep from pulling after I've already regrown them, because I'm more likely to pull sparse lashes (yay follicle damage) than a fuller set of lashes.  I started using the Latisse during the regrowing process, so I already had nice lashes by the time they fully grew back."
Trichsters,1x169a,pseudoscienceoflove,3,Wed Feb 5 04:41:54 2014 UTC,"Were there any negative side effects that you noticed?

Trichsters,1x169a,JellyBeanKruger,1 point,Wed Feb 5 04:48:13 2014 UTC,"Only side effect I noticed was a little darkening of the eyelid. My irises are the same. As for the price... Full disclosure. I use Lumigan, which the EXACT same thing as Latisse, except it's marketed for glaucoma and it's cheaper. I think you have to have a prescription to get it..."
Trichsters,1x169a,pseudoscienceoflove,2,Wed Feb 5 13:54:42 2014 UTC,"I've used it and it works very well. However, be advised that lash enhancement serums in general synchronize your lash growth, so that at the end of the growth cycle you tend to lose a bunch all at once as opposed to one or two. This exacerbated my pulling (personally) and pretty soon I was back to zero.  I never experienced iris changes or irritation, but because of the increased blood flow to the follicles, my eyelids get a little red."
Trichsters,1wo4hx,maxuelmaxuel,6,Fri Jan 31 20:02:10 2014 UTC,"Every once in a while when my friends let me know I'm pulling I mentally fall back on that concept. I really just try and remember that is something that I want to stop doing. Kind of like a smoker trying to quit. They want to stop but sometimes the urge is too much to handle and they will usually say something along the line of, ""well I wanted a cigarette so I smoked one, don't tell that I shouldn't smoke."" Just try and remember it is something you, personally, want to stop doing. Best of luck friend."
Trichsters,1wo4hx,IkeandMikes,5,Fri Jan 31 22:31:43 2014 UTC,"I do find that sometimes when I'm in the middle of a bout of pulling, but never before/as an excuse to start. When I am trying to figure out why I'm doing it mid-act, sometimes I fall into a place of ""I'm doing it because I'm manically compelled to,"" though, if that's sort of what you mean?  But, before I knew it had a name, I would be panicking mid-pulling because I thought I was a weirdo/freak for doing it and someone would see me and call me out for being gross or something (which then stressed me out and led me to continue). So I think what's most likely is that when I'm pulling, my brain goes to a depressed/panicky place and anything that pops into my head will be something that makes me keep going. Sorry I don't have a solution for you! :( Although, just in case it does work for you, the wondering why I'm doing it does come from a psychologist I used to see, who suggested that I question what is stressing me out or making me feel compelled to pull. And sometimes I can pinpoint something and stop myself before I start/it gets too bad."
Trichsters,1wo4hx,sigmasunshine,3,Sat Feb 1 04:56:50 2014 UTC,"Accept that all you've done is learned a new word. You already knew something was wrong. You already knew what that something did to you. Be blunt about it to yourself when you feel the excuses coming on.  I can't speak for you since I don't know, but it's hard to say if you're falling on the false logic where you're increasing your habits or you're now justifying them in a different way. If it's the latter it may not be a bad thing because, quite frankly, it's better than thinking ""I'm such a freak"". The best way for you to really snap out of those feelings is by exploring treatment options and getting active in changing things in your life.  edit: also I don't mean to be dark but this kinda reminded me of south park :)"
Trichsters,1wo4hx,Pinctada,3,Sat Feb 1 12:21:38 2014 UTC,"tl; dr: Labelling it can be either good or bad, depending on how you think about mental problems.   I think this is a good way to think of it: ""Mental illness is like fighting a war where the enemy's strategy is to convince you that the war isn't actually happening."" In that way, it's very important to understand that there is a very real war going on in your head, and that it is constantly being fought. There's power to knowing your opponent, and that trich is something you can actually fight. Knowing the label empowers us to research the problem and develop methods to combat trich.   I think that some people can think ""It's ok for me to pull because this problem is bigger than me"" and it can be really discouraging to feel that way, especially when the urge is right there biting at your thoughts. It's kind of like your thoughts actually conform to what your body wants to do and it leaves people feeling hopeless about whether they are even in control of their choices. It sucks. I also think there are people who can use the label ""trich"" to reduce their problem rather than feel defeated by it. If you can use the label to acknowledge your opponent rather than feel defeated by it, it can be very very helpful to making steps towards recovery."
Trichsters,1wo4hx,baizoo,1 point,Sun Feb 9 05:33:12 2014 UTC,identifying it helped me feel like I wasn't a freak. It showed me that I am not the only person in the world who has these urges that feel uncontrollable and frustrating. I guess it's about understanding that what you do makes sense in its own way.

I really want my hair to be long again, so I think I'll just ask her to even it up with taking off the minimal amount, and to style it. If I have to, I suppose I'll just be honest about it. I just don't want to gross her out, because I know pulling bothers other people."
Trichsters,1w9g7x,Puffalump,1 point,Tue Jan 28 01:34:47 2014 UTC,How did it go? I also just got my hair cut professionally a few days ago after 3 years of awkwardly cutting it myself. It was a bit difficult at first but I decided to just be honest with the stylist because it would allow her to style my hair the most appropriately. She was really accepting and talked with me about ways to help make my hair look thicker. In the past I have also called the stylist ahead of time and told her about my issue. That way when I came in I wouldn't have to talk about it in front of other strangers. It also keeps you from worrying about whether she will notice it and ask you about it during the haircut.  Don't worry about grossing out your stylist. They've seen a lot of heads of hair in all sorts of conditions and as long as you have good hygiene I doubt patchy hair would be considered gross in the least bit!
Trichsters,1w9g7x,Puffalump,3,Fri Jan 31 22:50:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks for asking! I was just thinking about posting an update. It went really well! My husband was getting his hair cut before me and by the same stylist, so he was there, which made me feel more comfortable. I told the stylist and she was really sweet about it. She told me that she has a cousin who pulled for a few years, so she was pretty familiar with trich already. I really, really want long hair again, so she only cut off enough to even out my hair. Now, my hair is at my jawline, which is kind of scary short for me, but I'm treating it as a new leaf, and haven't pulled since my appointment on Tuesday!  When I got home I freaked out a bit, once I was able to get a good look at it in my bathroom mirror. The hair cut is objectively great, but I was worried that it made me look old or like a middle-aged mom (no offense to the moms out there!). This might also have something to do with the fact that I'm turning 29 soon, haha. But, my husband talked me down and told me that he really loves it. The cut is growing on me, and certainly makes my hair look so much thicker, which has given me a boost of confidence.  I don't know if you use any volumnizing products, but my stylist used Aveda's ""pure abundance"" style-prep which worked really well and isn't weighty and doesn't make the hair too stiff.  Thanks again for asking--it means a lot to me that I have a group of people here who know what I'm going through and can always be counted on for advice, confidence, and perspective :)"

I've made one eyelid really sore trying to get really short new growth out. :(  I don't mind when I do it from the scalp so much cos it's coverable, but my lashes :(, I love doing makeup and stuff, now I have to wear false lashes every day. When I was a kid I pulled out ALL my top eyelashes and my grandma noticed and was super shocked and started parading me around the family ""Look, she's got no eyelashes!!"", from that day (about 9 years old) I swore to never do my lashes again.

Some tricks that might help: Get fake nails. It's harder to pull when you have gels or acrylics on. Also, try not to use mascara for a little while. Mascara makes it easier to get a good grip on them. I also have posted pictures around my room of people with great eyelashes, so when I start to pull I'll look at them and think about it and stop myself.   Hugs to all of my fellow eyelash pullers! We can get over this! :)"
Trichsters,1w10es,Nickilette,3,Fri Jan 24 20:24:30 2014 UTC,"I feel like the exact opposite - mascara helps me not to pull because it feels so different from a real lash that it's an instant reminder not to do that.  Different tactics for everyone though, and whatever works for you is the important thing."
Trichsters,1w10es,blackwatersunset,1 point,Fri Jan 24 20:30:56 2014 UTC,I feel like posting here helps me not to pull cos I feel ashamed when I look at the pics.

Trichsters,1vp4m3,trichkingme,2,Thu Jan 23 08:15:00 2014 UTC,"Aw that's just not right! Just because you had one bad experience doesn't mean they all have to be like that. Many women are extremely caring and understanding and guess what, other people have their own shit going on too. I have always been nervous to talk to my friends about it (who are all women) and everyone one of them has ALWAYS been understanding. Perhaps you could use a little make up to cover up. I use this: http://www.benefitcosmetics.com/product/view/brow-zings and with a little practice it can look pretty normal.  Anyway I hope that one bad person won't ruin your life forever. Don't let her get to you. We all have some baggage and it's just about finding someone who can help you carry it. It goes both ways, though.

(he says) He's been good about other things so far, but that hasn't happened yet. I think he means well, and he certainly knows why I do it (stress or habit from a coping mechanism I formed to deal with my family as a 13-year-old), but we haven't talked about it a whole lot."

My hair used to be halfway down my back. Over the years it has gotten shorter and shorter, first to shoulder length, then a bob, and now a pixie cut. And with every hair cut, I started pulling less and less. I have had my hair in a pixie for over a year now, and I only ever pull very occasionally, usually when I have very stressed or very bored, and even then it is usually only a hair or two before I quickly stop myself. Short hair grows remarkably quickly, so I wouldn't stress too much about the tufts, they will quickly grow in :)"

Trichsters,1vdseo,projectemily,5,Thu Jan 16 21:10:59 2014 UTC,"Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about Kneaded eraser :      The kneaded eraser, also known as putty rubber, is a tool for artists. It is usually made of a grey or white pliable material (though it can be found in many different colors, ranging from green to blue to hot pink) and resembles putty or gum. It functions by adsorbing and ""picking up"" graphite and charcoal particles. It does not wear away and leave behind eraser residue, thus it lasts much longer than other erasers.  Kneaded erasers can be shaped by hand for precision erasing, creating highlights, or performing detailing work. They are commonly used to remove light charcoal or graphite marks and in subtractive drawing techniques. However, they are ill-suited for completely erasing large areas, and may smear or stick if too warm.  Although kneaded erasers do not wear away like other erasers, they can become exhausted and unable to absorb any more graphite or charcoal. In that case a kneaded eraser will actually make marks instead of erasing them.  Different colored eraser ...  (Truncated at 1000 characters)     Picture - Two kneaded erasers. A newer eraser is on the left, and an older eraser on the right. The older eraser is darker due to the graphite and charcoal dust that has become incorporated into the eraser.  image source | about | /u/projectemily can reply with 'delete'.

I can't grab them to pull them out; They're too short. So my hands stay occupied and I don't lose any locks! Try it! And stay strong.  I totally get what you mean about the hair everywhere. I pull a lot in the car and also when I study (which is like 24/7). Take it one day at a time and try explaining to your husband that you're trying.

Anyway, back to your concern. I twirl and run my fingers through my hair a lot as well as pulling, and I noticed my son twirling his hair at about two or three years old while we were in the car (I think that's when I pull most, driving). He did it a few times that I noticed and I haven't seen him ruffle or twirl his hair in quite a while, he's five now.   My hope is that he won't pull and doesn't notice me doing it, but it's not like I hide it at home either. I just try to keep my hands busy with crocheting or knitting while we watch tv at night.

Trichsters,1v9bme,Inkbyamanda,6,Wed Jan 15 07:17:24 2014 UTC,A week is an incredibly short amount of time! That's no where even close to a reasonable length of time to decide if it works or not. The studies were several months and researchers thought they were too short. Don't be so upset so soon! You need to give it more time.
Trichsters,1v9bme,Puffalump,2,Wed Jan 15 15:11:50 2014 UTC,"I was just curious.   It took about 4 weeks of HIGH dosage for it to affect me.   However, from the research I've done it really depends on what 'kind' of puller you are."

I'm glad there are other lash/brow tuggers on here, otherwise I'd feel really strange..  Definitely reassuring to hear that yours seem to be regrowing normally/quickly. Would you say that they're less ""naturally voluminous"" than they were before you started pulling? (If you don't mind me asking, of course.)"
Trichsters,1v54w7,_nancywake,3,Mon Jan 13 23:51:51 2014 UTC,"Don't be silly, of course I don't mind. I found at first that they were a little thinner and also shorter, but they seem to be coming in fine again now, and I too have been pulling for years. Do yours seem this way?  There are absolutely lash/brow pullers here. It really is hard, I only managed to stop because I was so 'bald' on my eyes that I was humiliated. I think the inconvenience (and expense!) of constant fake eyelashes/drawing on brows scared me straight, but it is still a battle to keep my naughty fingers away. Keeping busy has helped me a lot as I seem to pull in idle moments.   You're definitely not alone, hang in there and don't hesitate to ask for support. :)"
Trichsters,1v54w7,_nancywake,3,Tue Jan 14 00:02:56 2014 UTC,I know exactly how you feel. I am so aware of eyelashes now. And looking in the mirror every morning to see if there is any growth? Taking forever to get ready because you have to apply fake eyelashes? Blergh.

If you don't want to stop there is nothing anyone can do for you. Honestly, you will probably relapse for the rest of your life.  My suggestion: find a place where it is ok to pick. As a woman, groomed eyebrows look better so I focus my trich on my eyebrows, sure I relapse here and there but that helps. Weed has also helped(but I don't think that is an option for a teacher).

(I'm not a trich, but do have a few other slightly less obvious conditions of the same nature)  But that's what it always is with me when I go on a spree. Generally takes some major sitting down with myself to figure out what's bothering me... Last time it was vaguely ignoring how my boyfriend can sometimes say incredibly hurtful things without meaning to.... (I tend to be oversensitive to rejections, which I know and thus ignore/repress when I feel that way which apparently isn't so great)  However, while I'm not formally educated in psychology (meaning I have no degrees) I would suggest it's actually pretty damn obvious even to me that the whole ""not caring"" about the relapse is kind of an indication that there's something rather major going on, because honestly...   This is a condition that will impact your social life, the way people perceive you, etc. For you not to care that everyone is going to notice something major.... It kind of indicates a cry for help from a deep subconscious place. I either don't know you well enough or am not educated enough to tell you what that cry for help is about, but... I think it's probably supposed to be a wakeup call.   I think it might be time to see a doctor and have a talk. It could be depression (apathy is actually much more common than feeling actively sad) and it's really important to remember that depression often has nothing to do with how awesome or not your life is... Because it's just an imbalance in brain chemicals, often quite easily helped with a simple antidepressant, though maybe a psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist might be a good person to see."

Trichsters,1uumow,checkthebasement,8,Fri Jan 10 02:32:11 2014 UTC,"Personally, I like to think that as long as I wear eyeliner and haven't pulled out too many it isn't that noticeable and I can pass it off as just having sparse lashes. Then again, people could just be polite and not saying anything.  I did have a co-worker ask me what happened to all my eyelashes once. I ended up telling her that I didn't like the ""feel"" of them sometimes and I pulled them. She put a positive spin on it, stating that she could understand that. She herself didn't like hair in her face so she never wore bangs and she guessed it was kind of the same thing. It was probably the nicest thing anyone ever said to me about it. Most of the time I just had my mother yelling at me to leave them alone."
Trichsters,1uumow,kuiperbelle,6,Fri Jan 10 05:25:28 2014 UTC,"I am an eyebrow and eyelash puller, and two people have noticed without me telling them in my... about 10 years of pulling(?). I don't know if it was the eyelashes or the eyebrows that they noticed (or don't recall), but I can also say that a friend was putting mascara on me once in middle school and even doing this noticing that I had few/no eyelashes (it wasn't right after pulling, so there were some very small regrowths here and there), she didn't make the connection that I'd pulled them. She just assumed my eyelashes grew that way (??). So, my experience has been that if it's not something you're already familiar with/looking for, you don't notice it."
Trichsters,1uumow,sigmasunshine,3,Fri Jan 10 03:49:18 2014 UTC,"Before my pulling days, I was a counselor at a kid's summer camp.  I had a girl in my cabin, about 10 years old, and I noticed something was a little strange about her face, but couldn't quite put my finger on it.  After a week, it hit me--she didn't have any eyelashes.    A lot of people have sparse or short or light-colored eyelashes...if you're not a heavy makeup wearer, I think it takes a trichster or an incredibly observant person to notice the absence.  Most often, when I pulled, people would say I looked tired or stressed and leave it at that.  Maybe polite, maybe waiting for you to share if you're comfortable doing that."
Trichsters,1uumow,alliezoomzoom,2,Fri Jan 10 03:23:16 2014 UTC,"My cousin's friend is an eyelash puller, and I had no idea.

Trichsters,1uumow,kdoh25,2,Fri Jan 10 04:08:54 2014 UTC,"In 8th grade, one of my classmates noticed and made a huge deal out of it, yelling for everyone to come and ""Look how weird this is! [ManaMoogle] has no eyelashes!!"" They did. It was pretty traumatizing. They kept asking questions so I just said it was genetic, and pretty soon they probably forgot all about it. But since then I wore eyeliner if they were bald and no one said anything. (Until college- that classmate and I met up and she mentioned my eyelashes grew back so I told her the truth. She felt pretty terrible for having yelled it out like that when we were kids.)  Like sigmasunshine said, I think people only notice it if they're VERY observant/interested in every little detail, or if they do it themselves. Once I realized what trich was, I noticed it in two other people at my school (one teacher!) when before I wouldn't care to notice someone's eyelashes.   Related: I'm 9 months pull-free, woohoo!"

I was just curious after reading the following on Wikipedia: "" When trichotillomania begins in adulthood, it is often associated with other psychiatric disorders, and referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist for evaluation or treatment is considered best. The hair pulling may resolve when other conditions are treated."""

These are what they are: Anxious/jittery Angry/irritable Fearful/worried Lonely/sad Recognized/understood Comfortable/peaceful Feel connected/in touch Urge to pull out hair or other body-focused behavior How many pulled Time spent  This helped to build awareness.  For some reason by just evaluating the urge and giving it a number, I gained power in the moment.    She also helped with relaxation techniques.  I'm sure there was more but that was what I found most helpful.  I was able to be pull free for about 4 glorious months then I fell back into it after going off NAC.

I can't say I've stopped pulling, but my hair is cropped short and looks pretty good, although I certainly have some thin patches.  A few tips: 1) You have to be ready to change.  Something deep inside you has to be ready to make some hard choices.  If you are there, you are ready for therapy. 2) You have to be ready to be completely honest.  COMPLETELY honest.  You can't hold back, you've got to be able to tell the doc everything- for me, this was the hardest part, because this shit feels shameful.  Everything from how much I pull, where I pull to the root eating.  If you can't be fully honest about the problem you're solving, you won't get anywhere.  3) you have to find a doctor you have rapport with.  If you can't build a relationship of trust, this isn't going to work.  Finally, 4) You need a doctor with knowledge and experience with OCD.  They need to be able to have experience with CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) because in the long run, drugs alone aren't enough.  I actually called the professional association in my province, got a list of recommended doctors, and as I contacted them, had them make me recommendations of their peers.  That's how I ended up at my doctor.  Good luck on your journey!!"

Trichsters,1uonze,Theran23,4,Wed Jan 8 05:01:53 2014 UTC,"Hey, I struggled with trich for 8 years - from 4th grade until just before I graduated high school. I know exactly what you are going through - the shame, self-loathing and just not being happy with yourself. I was there - only, I ripped hairs from my head, not my eyebrows/lashes. I had a huge bald spot and I was so afraid and embarrassed of it, it really impacted my life. I wouldn't even tell my best friend. My mom found out, she made it so much worse... put me down about it, made me feel ugly unless I had a weave in. This went on for years, until finally I was able to quit. Sometimes I still think about pulling, and even dream about it... but I feel so disgusted to think about ending up back where I was. I can actually run my fingers through my own natural hair now... which is truly amazing. It grew back out kinky and weird, but its my own hair. Anyways, I think that opening up to people was really what helped me the most. Not feeling ashamed about my problem. Learning that people generally don't give a fuck how much hair you are missing if they really care about you. Maybe it was just my time to quit and your situation is not the same... but I think its important with trich to gain some confidence. You don't have to love yourself, or even like yourself... just be okay with yourself and you may notice a difference.  I don't know. I am just speaking from personal experience.

Trichsters,1uktq6,yogo4froyo,3,Mon Jan 6 23:45:26 2014 UTC,The worst is that they are such loudly curly and the rest of my hair is straight.   I have to straighten my hair before I leave to house.
Trichsters,1uktq6,Puffalump,3,Tue Jan 7 00:07:24 2014 UTC,"I have straight hair and my side tufts get all curly too if I let them air dry. Congrats on the pull free days! I've never had much success being pull free, less than 15 in a day is a win for me. Maybe I need to increase my NAC dose."
Trichsters,1uktq6,Puffalump,2,Tue Jan 7 03:28:57 2014 UTC,Go for it!    I took a really high dose of NAC.   2400 mg I think.   And I also paired it with Inositol.   It helped more then I could have ever imagined.
Trichsters,1uktq6,kittenpockets,2,Tue Jan 7 03:30:52 2014 UTC,"So you're not taking them anymore? I'm only taking 1200 mg a day, two pills in the AM. I think I'll start adding one more before dinner and see how it goes. How much Inositol did you take? I tried it a while back on its own and it gave me some digestive issues at the full dose so maybe I should eventually try adding just a little with the NAC."
Trichsters,1uktq6,shembus,2,Tue Jan 7 03:50:39 2014 UTC,"I stopped taking them about a month ago when things seemed under control.   I take them every so often when I know my day will be stressful (I'm a tattoo artist so days can get hectic and long).  I was taking 2400mg of NAC and 1200 of inositol.   You definitely have to slowly build up.  To be frank, inositol have me some stinky farts which my boyfriend didn't appreciate but my body adjusted.  Good luck."

Trichsters,1uktq6,_Action_Bastard,3,Tue Jan 7 02:04:04 2014 UTC,Now that they're long enough I can straighten them.   They stay down fairly well.   Mostly I try to ignore it because I can't do much except wait for them to grow longer.

I want to so badly that sometimes I cry when I learn I have to part my hair a different way to cover up the patches I pulled out. So far I have made it 8.5 hours without pulling. Ugh. Worst part is I am a man, so I cant complain about it to my friends."

In my early goings I was using a lot of upper body to move vertically when I should have been using my legs. I've never had a forearm pump like that before or since. Good stuff."
Trichsters,1ubg6v,SomeChicagoan,3,Fri Jan 3 16:12:10 2014 UTC,"Some people do find that their pulling is stress-related, which could be very much related to her ""past"", as you put it.  Sometimes, pulling increases during times of increased pressure/stress, or it may have initially started during an event of extreme stress.  You are right that she needs to make the step to seek help.  Professional help is available, if she's interested.  I think, however, that your ability to help ends with letting her know that you're open to the discussion.  She's probably well aware that she's hurting herself or causing herself embarrassment.  Repeatedly bringing it to her attention would probably be more hurtful than helpful."
Trichsters,1ubg6v,steelcitykid,3,Fri Jan 3 18:42:29 2014 UTC,"Change has to come from within, no matter how much you care or want her to stop for her own well being. When she's decided she wants to stop, only then can she effectively seek treatment.  Trich isn't the type of affliction like a disease you can get a shot of medicine over. In fact, there is no known cure at all. There are treatments to help manage it, and some people have managed their own very well, some even quit. However because of our lack of understanding surrounding it, what works for one person may not for another. There are medication options that have shown to have some effect on impulse control, and for others cognitive behavior therapy can be beneficial.  You could open dialogue about it, but be sensitive to her own shame or embarrassment surrounding her problems. Most of us know what we're doing even if it's semi-conscious, and may react unexpectedly when someone even close to us tries to help.  The best advice I can give is to be supportive and talk openly with her about what she wants. Be prepared too that she may not want to talk at all about this."
Trichsters,1ubg6v,skamnorth,3,Fri Jan 3 19:50:15 2014 UTC,"I know you probably mean well, but don't try to ""fix"" her, it may just make her feel like you think she's broken (and hence she blocks you out.) In addition, if she does seek help wanting to change for you, and the pulling doesn't stop, she'll feel like a even bigger failure.  Just hold her and be there for her, and create a safe space for her to stress down in. Dont push."
Trichsters,1ubg6v,cinemachick,2,Fri Jan 3 20:25:10 2014 UTC,"The other commentors are correct: Change will start when she wants it to, no sooner. If you don't think she already has a trichotillomania diagnosis, maybe direct her to this subreddit. You could actually preface a conversation about it with this post, saying you've explored what we've said and know what the condition is. Check out the links in the sidebar as well- there are a lot of great resources for learning about these disorders.    Ultimately, creating a safe and loving environment is the best thing you could do for your girlfriend. Let her know that you care about her, even if she pulls her hair, and that you are there to support her. Try not to scold her or yell at her if she pulls around you, as that can raise her stress levels and make things worse. Asking her what she needs from you to be safe and happy is the best advice I can give. Every person is different, so just ask!    And just in case it's not clear, the fact that you're here asking this question is a big sign that you are an awesome boyfriend. :) Best of luck to the two of you!

Trichsters,1ubg6v,Puffalump,1 point,Sat Jan 4 02:24:51 2014 UTC,"Thank you all for you constructive answers! And until now, I understood them all :) It's kinda hard for me to understand this. I just combine her problems with hair-pulling disorder. Don't get me wrong, I don't feel like I have to fix her, I just see that she can't handle, for example, pressure before finals. We talked about it, she is aware of her problem but she doesn't feel like she can't do anything about it or professional help would get her further. I just can't understand how you can ignore those symptomps. Long story short: I'm just afraid of she's building something up and can't let it out like she has to. We didn't talked about for about 2 months now. But I watched her head and I clearly saw it getting worse. I think I'll just wait after finals and ask her if she's allright.  :) Thank you very much for your help guys!"
Trichsters,1u998p,cinemachick,3,Thu Jan 2 20:58:44 2014 UTC,"I agree with clothes_girl: Cover up and distract your hands during the interview, then disclose it to your employer before starting the job. I would add that you should especially take care if your job has anything to do with food prep or serving- if any hair got into someone's food, it could be an issue. But, as long as your pulling didn't get in the way of your normal duties, I don't see why it would impact your ability to perform in the job. Keep a cool head and a loving personality, and you're sure to come through! Good luck. hug"

I've given up trying to cover it up. When I graduated last year and started interviewing, I had the same fear. Luckily, I was proven wrong. I went to the interview for my current position and met with my boss and everything just clicked. I've never pulled in front of other people so I'm not sure about pulling 24/7. I also never disclosed the fact I have trich, but I have been considering it.  Be confident and charismatic and I don't think it will be a problem at all! I think one of the most important aspects of interviews is how you carry yourself. You'll do great!"
Trichsters,1u998p,steelcitykid,2,Fri Jan 3 03:34:15 2014 UTC,"My hair is really thin, all over, with some bald-ish spots here and there. I've also worried about this, but have landed some temp jobs following interviews. Just haven't landed any of the permanent jobs for which I have interviewed, but I don't attribute that to my hair."
Trichsters,1u998p,clothes_girl,2,Fri Jan 3 06:17:40 2014 UTC,"I'm a male in a professional setting. Maybe that gives me some leeway with having bald spots but it's pretty obvious this isn't typical male pattern balding. I have thin spots on front, and a large, unnaturally shaped spot on my crown and it extends backwards a bit. So my point is that I look pretty bad right now. However, I carry myself with confidence, speak confidently, address people directly, and I've never had anyone say anything to me. I'm short too, so I know everyone can see it and while I'm self conscious about it, I've learned to just go out and do my thing, other people's thoughts be damned.  If anything, I would say our unique affliction gives you little boost of empathy towards other's suffering that would go a long way towards being a good camp counselor. Chin up and go get 'em."
Trichsters,1u998p,clothes_girl,1 point,Fri Jan 3 13:58:44 2014 UTC,"ok, I have a few questions/comments for you.  1) Are you a gentleman or a lady?  Either way, due to the nature of this job, you could probably shave your head and be fine.  If you are a lady and don't think this will fly, please consider a wig, or a cute hat (can't go wrong with a classic Panama style, and it's sun safety!)  2) Re: Will the act of pulling out your hair work against you?  Well, when do you pull?  Are you worried you'll pull during the job interview, or when you are actively working as a counselor with the kids?  Because that gets more complicated.  If you are worried about pulling in the interview, I'd be bringing something to put in my hands, like a paperclip, to keep them out of my hair.  If you're worried about pulling on the job, I'd disclose my condition after getting the job, but before starting it (i.e. so they can't not hire me for a disability...but I'm Canadian, so I have protection under the law.  Not sure what the rules are elsewhere).  Good luck on the job application!"
Trichsters,1u998p,clothes_girl,1 point,Thu Jan 2 21:08:46 2014 UTC,"1) I'm female; the rest of my hair is chest-length, but the parts that I pull are barely an inch or two. I typically wear beanies. Although they don't hide the hair very well, it sometimes keeps me from pulling  2) I pull nearly 24/7, though if I can control it for the duration of an interview. I'd most likely be pulling all throughout work, though.  I live in America, so although I can file for disability, I don't know if my condition qualifies as a disability. It'd more likely be seen as a distraction to the workplace and an unclean appearance"
Trichsters,1u998p,clothes_girl,3,Thu Jan 2 21:13:53 2014 UTC,"Pulling 24/7?  That's really tough, sorry you have to deal with that.  Have you gotten any help with this?  Pulling in public is something that is going to make the career portion of your life extremely difficult (don't mean to point out the obvious, sorry).  Would a hat help?  Or the super short haircut?    I'm thinking that an OCD diagnosis counts as a medical reason not to fire you, if you can do everything else that a camp counselor does. I mean, you wouldn't consider someone with Cerebral Palsy a distraction in the workplace or unclean in appearance because their condition makes them look and act differently than you or I.    Ideally it doesn't come to that, though, because you're going to nail the interview and be so awesome at the job, no one notices :D"
Trichsters,1u998p,ThatsATallGlassOfNo,1 point,Thu Jan 2 21:23:13 2014 UTC,"I've tried therapy but a lot of therapists I've been to kind of brushed over the pulling issue and focused more on everything else they could (maybe they didn't know how to handle it?) I wear hats almost every day that I'm out in public. They don't change how noticeable it is, but it reduces my pulling. It doesn't fully prevent it, though.  If I could apply for disability, I would in a heartbeat, it makes perfect sense. I'll have to look into it more :)"

I want to stop but don't currently I think I don't have the motivation to, since I'm depressed and don't have any peers whose impression of me I care enough about to make it worthwhile. A few years ago, however, I was forced to go to a horrible therapist for a few months. She would tell me that it was impossible for me to just stop on my own; that I would have to do tracking and planning and all this junk. And I thought, ""Mmmn, no, that's incorrect."" And I stopped. Once I had a real reason to do it, it was a cinch. All was good for maybe a year and a half until a particularly stressful time when I just went, ""screw it,"" and threw it all out. So here I am again.  But good luck, and keep that motivation up!"

One is compulsive, and one is laziness.  Be supportive understanding about his trich, but don't let it impact your own quality of life. I have trich, and I would feel like crap if I were leaving a mess around for someone else to clean up.  I would say that you should definitely address the issue with him, but make sure he understands that you're only taking issue with the problem that he has control over. Gently."
Trichsters,1ttmmz,Paladin4Life,2,Fri Dec 27 20:48:02 2013 UTC,"Well, being a slob about it isn't cool. Instead of cleaning up his mess yourself, tell him to get in there and clean up after himself. Maybe he doesn't ""see"" what kind of mess he's leaving, but that should enlighten him.   Also, being late to work and such- that's a pretty negative impact. It's one thing to be a puller, but it's another if pulling starts to take up your day. I would honestly suggest he start manscaping, either shaving or better yet, waxing. (Less bumps)"

I have my pulling almost completely under control and its so minimal that no one knows I do it anymore. But it is the worst when the spot feels irritated. I start getting this twinge on my scalp and I know deep down there is this bad hair and if I keep pulling I'll find the infected piece and suddenly everything will be better. I thought this way for a long time until I told my SO about it and he gently told me that it didn't exist.

For destroying the hair, I didn't really have any disdain for the hair, but I would chew it up very fine and swallow it. I know, gross.

That is the only time I get satisfaction.  This, of course, results i pulling many other hairs out to get to that prize root.  And when I get that root, I normally eat it, but I have been known to smear it on paper (it looks oddly like black ink), run it against my skin (it feels oily) and I've even burnt one in a flame once (the stink took all pleasure out of that).  For some reason, eating it is the best reward for pulling that perfect hair.  The hair itself gets tossed.  Then I have a shower and the remorse sets in after I feel the bald spot that pulling fest left behind.  This is really a sick disorder.  My thoughts and prayers are with all of my fellow trichsters who suffer from it."
Trichsters,1t8flp,prettyprettynohair,3,Thu Dec 19 07:43:37 2013 UTC,Sorry I can't help.  No physical pain when I don't pull. No paranoia or fear of cameras and no subreddits that come to mind.   Hope you find some help. <3 a fellow puller.
Trichsters,1t8flp,codhopper,2,Thu Dec 19 09:50:11 2013 UTC,That's okay! At least you clicked. :)
Trichsters,1t8flp,SarcasticOptimist,3,Thu Dec 19 14:06:09 2013 UTC,"1 Do any of you feel real serious pain when you can't or won't pull?  No, it's more an urge or compulsion. It's not quite like hunger, more like snacking. Sometimes, though, I'll have periods when I don't bite my nails or pull, but then catch myself doing it absent-mindedly.  2 Do any of you feel extremely afraid of leaving your house?  No. It might be a separate issue, unless it's because you have awkward patches on the top of your hair or eyebrows that is noticeable.  3/4 Do you any of you feel extreme paranoia? Do you think this is related to trichotillomania?  No to either."
Trichsters,1t8flp,graceofapolarbear,1 point,Thu Dec 19 19:32:54 2013 UTC,"Thank you for answering! And for the second answer, I wear hats but it is still noticeable... But still, thank you."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,ICDresearcher,10,Tue Dec 17 14:50:39 2013 UTC,Why do I feel like only certain hairs need to be pulled? Why do I feel the need to chew and swallow the hair I pull?
Trichsters,1t3a5f,no_apologies,5,Tue Dec 17 17:38:28 2013 UTC,"Think about the hairs that you are pulling. Where are they located? What do notice about them? Some people are attracted to certain types of hair such as a unique texture or color. Some people like scalp hair because there are obviously different colored hairs that can be pulled out. Some people like underarm or beard hair because it's so course. Some people also do it due to location and are very cognizant to pull in places that are easy to hide. The hairs that are normally pulled are ""different"" as in they have a funny texture, are kinky, are a strange color. It is almost like the hair doesn't belong there, it's creating perfection and for some people it creates symmetry.   The chewing is somewhat common, but the swallowing is something called trichophagia. I do not mean to cause alarm, but trichophagia can be dangerous. What it does is create a trichobezoar, which is essentially a human hair ball, and can cause something called Rapunzel Syndrome. Unlike cats who get hair balls, humans don't just cough it up or digest it. It sticks in our stomachs and can cause some very nasty side effects and may require surgery to remove. If you swallow your hair very often and are experiencing bad abdominal pain, I would recommend seeing a doctor. Either way I would recommend seeing someone due to the severity of problems that trichophagia can cause. I do not know your specific case or how much you ingest, so I cannot tell you how bad or not bad it is. Here is some more information that I would recommend you check out:  (Trichophagia) http://www.trich.org/dnld/Trichophagia_2012-TLC.pdf  (Rapunzel Syndrome) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689422/  --->This last one is not meant to scare, it's meant to inform."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,StrangeQuark1,3,Tue Dec 17 18:39:07 2013 UTC,"When I pull my eyebrows or eyelashes, why do I touch the follicle to my tongue? I don't eat it, I just rub it on it for a bit and throw it away. I also enjoy seeing a larger follicle or if any  gunk comes with it. God why???"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,StrangeQuark1,1 point,Tue Dec 17 23:47:35 2013 UTC,"It's a lot more common than you think. The ""gunk"" (usually a root or something) can be a sign of accomplishment for some people, a battle is won. Chewing and putting hair in your mouth does happen, same as rubbing it against your face or other areas. I'm not entirely sure what the reasoning for this is, but it may have to do with hair texture. It's almost like an inspection. That's a speculation though."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,Toofywoofy,1 point,Wed Dec 18 04:29:58 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I think the only reason why I use my tongue is because it's so sensitive. It feels better if the hair is thicker and the root is bigger. I think you're right about the reason why I enjoy it when there's more gunk, it feels like I'm excising a cancer; something that isn't meant to be there. It just feels so good to rid myself of it when it was inside my body this whole time.   It really is a sense of accomplishment, the problem is that it makes me want to do more, and there may not be any more that would feel as good..."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,no_apologies,1 point,Wed Dec 18 13:43:04 2013 UTC,"Ah well see, that's where the problem is. That's why some people call trich a ""behavioral addiction"". Feels good, feeling accomplished...well then you keep doing it. Almost like alcoholism in some sense. It's a hard cycle to break, I hear it!"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,blackwatersunset,1 point,Wed Dec 18 14:47:16 2013 UTC,"DO see your doctor especially if you're ingesting at a steady rate. I am one of those cases that had to get surgery for a bezoar. It's a serious thing and you don't want to have to go through it. My situation probably could've been helped, but I was ashamed and in denial since I was just a preteen so I was going at it for a long time. It did not help that I had thick, curly hair."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,oneanddone72013,1 point,Tue Dec 17 18:44:26 2013 UTC,"Thank you for doing this and especially for this answer. I have been pulling for years now (since the age of 14 or 15) and I must've started chewing and swallowing pretty early on, I think (I'm 22 now). I chew (or bite) the hair into very small pieces. I guess I can't be sure but so far I haven't had problems or noticed any abdominal pain.  I definitely want to go see someone but haven't been able to get myself to do it due to anxiety (not just concerning trich but also doctors etc. in general).  Again, thank you very much for your work and taking your time to do this.  Maybe a follow-up question: Is there anything you can say from your research concerning the causes of trichophagia? Is it psychological e.g. like ""hiding the evidence"" or ""punishing the odd ones out?"""
Trichsters,1t3a5f,lurrz,1 point,Tue Dec 17 20:17:36 2013 UTC,"I unfortunately haven't done much research on trichophagia, nor do I know  of any research off the top of my head that concerns the causes. The only theories I have heard of are it was originally due to iron deficiency or a self destructive underlying.   [reference]  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X08000734"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,kdoh25,1 point,Tue Dec 17 21:12:19 2013 UTC,Is there the same risk with much shorter hairs eg. eyelashes?
Trichsters,1t3a5f,lurrz,2,Tue Dec 17 23:14:12 2013 UTC,"Not necessarily, though many people do pull from their eyelashes. That might be more of a texture thing since they are generally fairly thick."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,PaidInKissesAndHugs,9,Wed Dec 18 23:15:18 2013 UTC,Thank you so much for doing this AMA. You're my hero!
Trichsters,1t3a5f,fuckedsleep,2,Tue Dec 17 21:37:48 2013 UTC,"I'm happy I have been well received! It's a underappreciated line of research, but I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,fuckedsleep,6,Tue Dec 17 22:22:20 2013 UTC,"Please be aware that a lifetime of trich issues completely disappeared for me when I hit menopause. It's as if the whole obsession never happened. So, for me anyway, there seems to have been a hormonal component."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,fuckedsleep,12,Tue Dec 17 15:27:50 2013 UTC,"Yes! We do believe there is a hormonal piece of this puzzle. A majority of folks with trich are women (there are plenty of men though!) and often claim that their pulling occurred right around puberty. This would indicate a hormonal component. Other women also claim changes around pregnancy and menopause. There haven't been any conclusive findings about that, but it's a strong lead right now.   A lot of women still carry it past menopause, started well before or after puberty and had no changes with pregnancy, so right now it's more of a case-by-case idea."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,jillystrunk88,2,Tue Dec 17 15:37:18 2013 UTC,"Now that I think about it, my hair pulling went from zero to a million around the time my birth control ran out. So there's that, too, while we're on the subject of hormones."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,TokiDokiHaato,3,Tue Dec 17 23:11:16 2013 UTC,"I just realized that my pulling got really bad when I started taking birth control. Definitely seems like hormones could be to blame, I never thought of that! I wonder if I should stop taking the pill then?"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,gummibeartwist,3,Wed Dec 18 00:24:33 2013 UTC,"Don't alter your medications without first talking with your doctor. These are theories, but nothing has been proven at this point. Always always use medications under the recommendations of a physician!"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,helix19,1 point,Wed Dec 18 04:31:14 2013 UTC,"Obviously not the expert here but you could try switching to a different birth control! Not all the pills are the same, and then there's other options as well, so it could be you just need to switch it up."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,TokiDokiHaato,1 point,Wed Dec 18 22:21:17 2013 UTC,"I got really bad when I got pregnant with my son. It's been 6 months since I have birth and the urge isn't as bad, but it's still there."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,xd25lw4273314,3,Tue Dec 17 23:51:39 2013 UTC,I am planning to go on testosterone soon (I'm trans and female assigned at birth) and my trich is kinda bad. Could going on T be a big enough hormonal change to stop it if it can be stopped by hormones?
Trichsters,1t3a5f,helix19,3,Tue Dec 17 19:34:48 2013 UTC,"I would think it's unlikely, but I can't say for sure. Men DO get trich and even with added testosterone there is still a likelihood that the trich will remain. It's a good question though and I would be interested in finding out the answer. There is a study done in mice that estrogen decreased the hairpulling in mice (barbering). I can't find the full article though:  http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI1479803/"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,_Action_Bastard,5,Tue Dec 17 21:27:51 2013 UTC,I read an article long ago that said a faulty grooming gene could be the culprit.  Have you studied into that aspect at all?
Trichsters,1t3a5f,_Action_Bastard,7,Tue Dec 17 18:36:58 2013 UTC,"We do have a genetic component to our research and are excited to get results in! I know of a couple studies that have also looked at the genetic component. We are mainly interested in the familial genetic component right now to see how trich and other impulse control disorders show up in families. There are also some genes that regulate impulse control that we are excited about.   http://publichealth.doctorsonly.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2006_2_5.pdf  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627301005645  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1322243/  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajmg.b.30897/full  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662730100575X  A lot of these are done in mice, but exciting none-the-less!"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,lurrz,2,Tue Dec 17 21:19:19 2013 UTC,"Thanks!  Very exciting indeed. I am glad people are studying this. It would bring me some sort of inner peace to find out a cause. I have also wondered about the family line. After a bad session 15 years ago I had to ""come out""  to my family and I discovered my maternal grandmother has the condition as well."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,She_Spock,8,Tue Dec 17 21:48:51 2013 UTC,"Very very common to run in families. Trich, skin picking, nail biting and cheek biters run in families pretty often.   It's an underappreciated research field (except by the lovely people that are afflicted by it), but I love it and I've dedicated my life to it."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,cinemachick,6,Tue Dec 17 22:18:25 2013 UTC,I'm sure that I could speak for many of us by saying that you have no idea how much this means to the community even though you are not a sufferer yourself.
Trichsters,1t3a5f,cinemachick,7,Wed Dec 18 00:57:48 2013 UTC,I am actually a former sufferer and sometimes pick it back up from time to time. NAC has been a wonderful thing for me.
Trichsters,1t3a5f,Inkbyamanda,1 point,Wed Dec 18 05:13:21 2013 UTC,"Do you think these could be learned behaviors? My mother doesn't have trich but she is a pretty obsessive skin picker and nail picker. Both my sister and I pick skin, nails, cheek bite and I pull eyelashes and eyebrows. I have strong memories of my mother standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom obsessing over her skin."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,helix19,1 point,Sun Dec 29 05:16:53 2013 UTC,"These traits usually run in families, though they don't always manifest themselves the same way. A good chunk of people with trich have family members that either also have trich, pick their skin or bite their nails. Some also have people with OCD type qualities to them. We don't really think it's learned, but rather genetic. There's some interesting new research that is budding about this topic right now!"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,SarcasticOptimist,1 point,Tue Dec 31 16:32:29 2013 UTC,"No one in my family bites nails, has trich, skin picks, etc.  Am I just a weirdo then?"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,SarcasticOptimist,1 point,Wed Dec 18 03:28:02 2013 UTC,"Not at all. First, you might not know if people pull, pick, bite, ect. They are usually closed topics for a lot of people. Also, these things do pop up, I mean, all these things start sometime, correct? You are certainly not strange for having something like this when the rest of the family members aren't displaying overt symptoms."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,schubear,6,Wed Dec 18 04:32:53 2013 UTC,"Sometimes when I'm in close contact with other people or animals I get insatiable urges to pull out 'out of place' hairs from them.  I never do it with the animals, but I've been unable to resist sometimes and ended up pulling from another person's head (somebody who I was close to, but still).  Is this common?  I'm really worried I'm going to be standing in line behind somebody one day and end up pulling one of their hairs out because I just can't resist it."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,SarcasticOptimist,5,Tue Dec 17 23:42:19 2013 UTC,"A lot of times we just call it ""pulling by proxy"". That can be interpreted by other researchers as someone else pulling the trich person's hair, but I normally use it as a trich person pulling someone's hair. It's fairly common (somewhere around 15% of trich folks, I think)...heck, people without trich do it! If there's one kinky, strangely colored hair poking up from someone's head, I'm sure a lot of people would be bothered by it. Don't worry about the animal thing either, I've heard that several times from folks.   If you are pulling due to irregularities in your own hair, then it does make sense that you might do it to someone else. A strange hair is a strange hair, doesn't matter who it's on. You are not alone in this urge."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,schubear,3,Wed Dec 18 04:46:31 2013 UTC,"Skin picker here. I get the urge to pick at other people's skin all the time. Often after sex I'll go for the blackheads on the guys' chest and back. Surprisingly most guys seem ok with this. When they're not, though, seeing the imperfections in their skin causes me a lot of distress."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,TokiDokiHaato,3,Wed Dec 18 05:34:47 2013 UTC,"It's similar to what I mentioned before about the imperfections with people pulling ""by proxy"". You see something abnormal on someone else, you don't even like it on yourself, so you try to remove it...even if it's not you.   It's also a grooming thing. Look at animals. Grooming is a social behavior and well accepted among animals, such as chimps. Most research on trich and picking come from animal research (usually called grooming disorders or ""barbering""). The distress is where the disorder part sort of comes in, it's just grooming taken to an extreme."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,coletastrophie,2,Wed Dec 18 14:53:56 2013 UTC,Oh god this...my cat is black with a few stray white hairs.  I always have the urge to pull them.  I don't but it's definitely there.  Same with gray hairs on my boyfriend's head...I don't know why.
Trichsters,1t3a5f,um_hi_there,2,Wed Dec 18 03:37:44 2013 UTC,See above. It's not as uncommon as you think!
Trichsters,1t3a5f,snerv,3,Wed Dec 18 04:48:05 2013 UTC,How far has trich research come since it was first recognized as a disorder?
Trichsters,1t3a5f,snerv,4,Tue Dec 17 16:07:52 2013 UTC,"Light years. It really wasn't until more recently in the grand scheme of things that trich was even recognized as an official disorder. It was usually just clumped together with something else. We know SO much more about trich now that we ever did before. The diligence of the trich researchers of the world has really paid off and trich is finally being recognized more and more people are doing research on it. The new wave of trich research has been neuroimaging, which is amazing! We can finally get to the neurological basis of what trich is and even possibly design better treatment options. Trich treatment research is still buzzing and it has helped that more and more celebrities are stepping into the spot light to announce they have trich and/or support it.

Trichsters,1t3a5f,iamaquantumcomputer,1 point,Tue Dec 17 16:24:41 2013 UTC,"Why was trich and Excoriation disorder under researched for so long, considering how common they are?"
Trichsters,1t3a5f,longtimetrich,3,Wed Dec 18 05:30:58 2013 UTC,"This sounds bad and I don't mean it to be offensive. A lot of people just don't really think about trich and picking. To a lot of people, it just seems like a disorder that you can sit on your hands and break the cycle. People think of nail biting and think ""well, I overcame that as a kid, you can get over this"". Ok well yes, maybe YOU did that, but not everyone can. Also, nail biting can get REALLY bad for some people, even into adulthood. Trich and picking aren't ""attractive"" disorders, as in they are unusual sounding, but they don't have the ""bang"" that like, say, schizophrenia has. A lot of people also thing they don't cause severe damage or potentially serious damage like other disorders (i.e. depression-suicide, addiction-death, ect.), but we all know that not to be true. Also, for a long time they weren't even acknowledged as being disorders. So there's that. I share in your frustration."

Trichsters,1t3a5f,LavenderBluue,3,Tue Dec 17 22:22:44 2013 UTC,I have found that if I put my hair up into a few mini pony tails with rubber bands that I have zero urge to pull....its just not very reasonable seeing as I am a 31 year old professional man.
Trichsters,1t3a5f,RoRo87,2,Wed Dec 18 19:03:35 2013 UTC,Are you able to wear at hat or beanie at work? That might produce a similar effect.
Trichsters,1t3a5f,RoRo87,3,Wed Dec 18 23:16:26 2013 UTC,"(Trigger warning or self harm) Are there strong links between trich/derm and self harm? I've struggled with both since 9-10 years old and always figured they were tied somehow. They feel very similar as far as the sort of ""release"" you get, like for trich it would be that feeling when you pull just the right hair is very similar to when self harm feels good.   Also, I've stopped pulling, but have moved on to pretty much clawing my scalp off. I scratch at it until it bleeds, then get immense pleasure at scratching off the little scabs. I think it's what is causing some really bad dandruff for me, like layers and layers of it on my scalp. I've always had mild dandruff but now it's just crazy. I don't know if it's quite your area of expertise, but what can I do to help reverse the damage I'm doing, while I'm still trying to control myself? Dandruff shampoos don't really help, I've tried sulfate free shampoo and the ""no shampoo"" methods, but nothing helps (and all makes the more sensitive spots itch which makes me SCRATCH MORE)."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,KateEJHS,2,Tue Dec 17 23:26:24 2013 UTC,"The scratching is branching into excoriation disorder. It's in the same family as trich. It's a release of tension and normally most people report it as ""pleasurable"". Sort of like an itch that you get to scratch on your leg is similar to pulling and picking.   Many people with trich and/or picking report depression and anxiety as being in their past or present life. Trich and picking are self-injurious behaviors like cutting, ect., just in a slightly different way. Since there is a relationship to depression, it may not necessarily be that the trich is what is related to the self harm, rather the depression itself. I don't claim that all trich or picking is an intent to harm oneself, but there is a theory behind that.   It's hard to say with treatment of the scratching. The OTC medications I've mentioned may help with that behavior, but the dandruff is another thing. A dermatologist would be your best bet on that one, it's a little outside my realm of knowledge."
Trichsters,1t3a5f,levonbulwyer,2,Wed Dec 18 04:57:38 2013 UTC,What treatment has shown the most success?
Trichsters,1t3a5f,yogo4froyo,6,Tue Dec 17 15:17:22 2013 UTC,"Difficult to say since it seems to be different for every person (family history and personal biology plays a big roll). Some people have found relief on anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs and ADHD medication (ADHD medications have been thought to make hair pulling worse though). That's what a lot of doctors prescribe who aren't as familiar with the disorders.   Currently, there has been a lot of success with N-Acetyl Cysteine (a hot over-the-counter medication for impulse control disorders right now). What's nice about NAC is that you can buy it at grocery stores and online and it's relatively inexpensive. Here's a popular article on this:  http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=483113  Other people have found success in behavioral modification, such as cognitive behavioral therapy.   It all depends on the person, which is an unfortunate answer since there is no ""cure all"" at this time. NAC is probably the most popular medication being used in research at the moment though."

In my experience, eye lashes don't take very long to grow. It's possible that you did do some damage on that one side, especially since there doesn't seem to be any signs of eyelashes growing in in some areas after four months."

Trichsters,1smc6j,adya_saje,3,Wed Dec 11 07:29:40 2013 UTC,"One thing that works for me is covering my hair in products to make it too slippery to pull. If I have to study, which is the time I pull the most, I coat my hair in leave-in conditioner and it prevents me from pulling for several hours. Olive oil also does the trick it makes my hair much too greasy for me to enjoy pulling it, and on the upside when I wash it out the next day it leaves my hair much softer than before. Neither are great if I want to leave the house because I feel too self-conscious to go out with super greasy/gunked up hair, but it works really well for me when I'm at home."
Trichsters,1smc6j,steelcitykid,1 point,Wed Dec 11 19:50:16 2013 UTC,"Those are both interesting tactics. I'm pretty sure my sister has used olive oil before (though she's going into cosmotology so she experiments with everything. She cured her trich for the most part)  My issue is always leaving the house, when I have to look presentable. I could even see myself wearing a swimming cap during the day since it's so tight that I can't stick my hand in it, but I can't run around town with that on, lol."
Trichsters,1smc6j,steelcitykid,1 point,Wed Dec 11 20:04:59 2013 UTC,"I believe the outward trich is a sign of inward anxiety and a lack of resolution towards the source of that anxiety. If I'm stressed at work for reasons beyond my control, I notice I pull more. Once I resolve those issues through the proper channels I am much better off.  Have you ever tried meditation? Nothing mystic of new-agey, just quiet thoughtfulness about yourself -  you wants, needs, dreams, life. Give it a shot, don't worry about how to meditate, just try to relax and give yourself permission to think about whatever you want thoughtfully and be honest with yourself. I find it to be calming and while nothing has ever cured my trich, I have found meditation to help me attack the sources of my anxiety much more effectively and in turn, that seems to have a positive effect in suppressing my trich. Good luck and don't hate yourself."

When I was a kid (~3 years old, no joke) I would ""twizzle"" my hair by just pressing my index finger against my head and stroking in tight circles, until the hair underneath my finger would sort of ball and knot up.  I gave myself bald spots at an early age doing this! Then my trich receded mostly until just last year, when it started going NUTS. Now I cannot stop pulling my hair out."
Trichsters,1siwvg,Toofywoofy,2,Tue Dec 10 14:27:41 2013 UTC,"Yup. Mine started with twirling.  A lot of us have our own ""rituals"". For some of us, we don't just pull ANY hair, it often depends on texture and other similar variables."

Trichsters,1sfyf9,bengool,4,Mon Dec 9 05:22:39 2013 UTC,"I've been an eyelash puller for at least 20 years.  I transitioned from really bad eyelash pulling back to mostly full lashes by trying to just scratch at my eyelid with a fingernail rather than pull when I felt that itch to do it.  If that didn't help, I got up from whatever I was doing and went to a mirror to see if there was actually a stray lash to brush away rather than pull blindly.  Not saying I didn't have a couple setbacks, but knowing how improved I had gotten from my bald eyelids was definitely motivation to try to keep improving.  When I finally got most of my lashes back, I tried being really diligent about wearing mascara.  Part of this is a vanity thing (I hadn't been able to for so long), but I find that the texture of the mascara is an automatic reminder not to pull - it doesn't feel the same at all and I'm really careful when I do touch it (because who wants smudging?), but once I feel that unnatural texture, I pretty much just put my hand down and don't have the urge to pull at all anymore.  For eyebrows, if I catch myself wanting to pull, I get up from what I'm doing and find a mirror.  I know it doesn't work for everyone, but if I can tweeze the one or two bothersome hairs, I can usually get back to whatever I was doing.  Good luck!  I hope you find something in the replies that helps you."

I don't wear mascara often, but if it irritates me I'll using my fingers to tug for any loose hairs that may be causing irritation.   I carry a mirror and tweezers with me everywhere, especially work. If I feel a hair out of place, I will pull at it relentlessly. Tweezers speed up the process and are better for my nails."
Trichsters,1sfyf9,ThatsATallGlassOfNo,1 point,Fri Dec 27 22:21:05 2013 UTC,"I think you just gotta get past that hump. I pulled my lashes for a really long time as well. Started when I was 13 and only stopped earlier this year at 21. Lashes have been in for a few months now and aside from a few nights, I haven't had the urge to go crazy and pull. The hardest part for me was when the hairs were short and stubby. They had this texture that when I put my finger to them, I could just feel it to the roots. But I like this goal you set for yourself. I had a similar goal, and my parents helped as well. I wear glasses and one day I decided that I wanted to get LASIK eye surgery so I wouldn't have to wear glasses anymore. I went in for a consultation/eye exam and the person commented on my eyelashes and kind of made a joke about them a few times. I admit that is strange but tell him it's a stress relief and he kinda gets it  but still makes a few passing comments about them and laughs them off. He tells me that if I want LASIK then I wouldn't be able to touch my eyes for a few months after the surgery at least. Turns out that the surgery is really expensive, but I talk to my mom and she says that if I can grow my eyelashes back that she would help me pay for half (she never liked the fact that I pulled. We've had issues about it before, but from what I hear, that's fairly common). So that was the final ticket. I knew it would be hard, but I figure I could do it for help with the surgery. I have since backed down from the surgery, but still maintain my lashes. I did break once or twice, but I stopped myself before causing any real damage. I'm going to wait a few years to get the surgery. If I can keep my lashes for that long then I know I've beaten it. It's finals now and usually I'd be going to town on my eyelashes, but they are still intact and I love it. Good luck!   tl;dr: Set yourself a goal. I know it's a mindless task, but let's be honest, you still know when you're doing it. Stop it. Persevere. Get help from others. Reward yourself if you do it. Have a special thing set up if you complete your goal. It gets easier, trust me."
Trichsters,1sfyf9,Highdea001,1 point,Mon Dec 9 10:51:40 2013 UTC,"I used to do this, then transitioned to eyebrows, now isolate it to my upper arms. Doing positive things to your eyelashes and brows (like using a brush) means it won't stick one place or another. Sometimes vigorous face washing helps, as sometimes the stray lash will fall off naturally. If you have an oral element to your pulling (I like feeling the root with my lip), it could be satisfied then.  Playing with hand exercisers and getting tactile feedback from things like mechanical keyboards, guitars, and making bread also keep my fingers satisfied."

In terms of make-up, your friend can draw in her missing eyebrows with a good eyebrow pencil and it can look pretty natural.  Since this is new for her, and she is stressed, maybe you need to work with her on stress reduction techniques like exercise or meditation?

In this past week, I'm graduating. I've been worrying about getting graduating/walking completed; getting a new living space set up (I lived on on-campus apartments); getting a resume/portfolio site updated and making it look nice; worrying that I might be totally jobless long enough that I'll be forced to live at home, etc. Least to say, my eyelashes took a toll. They're 85% gone right now. Although this really sucks, I can either keep letting stress affect my pulling or I can start taking steps so my eyelashes can recover.  How did you do it before? If it was all of this new stress that's triggering the pulling, covering your hands/keeping your hands busy when you are feeling stressed might be helpful.

My wife kicks ass at life, and I'm sure you do, too.  Eyelash and eyebrow pulls are pretty easy to mask, or at least my wife has a real knack for it. Hopefully some of the other folks here have techniques to share.  (Also, it helped me to learn that I'm not even remotely alone in my condition. I have seborrheic dermatitis on my face. Basically, I get dandruff and big red blotch right smack in the middle of the face and a couple other places.  After years of being mortified about it, I just... stopped caring. I mean, I still treat it, moisturizing constantly, wear glasses and have long bangs, etc to minimize it. But if someone seems to notice, I own it. The breakthrough for me was I had a bunch of one-on-ones with a whole lot of my friends, told them about it, and then fished to see if they had anything thing they were mortified about. Holeeeeee sheit. Something like 40% of my friends owned up to an amazing array of conditions, mental health disorders, and other things they were awfully embarrassed about. Most were convinced that everyone else noticed and were put-off. I even learned I had two skin condition buddies!  Knowing that a vast number of people are in the same boat, albeit perhaps with different afflictions, totally helped me get over my shame. I don't know if that helps you, but it's all I got.)"

I would suggest trying this a few times with a darker brow pencil, then going over it again with some powder in the same fashion, then lighter pencil again to make it look like you just filled in your brows.

I stopped pulling for three months this summer but I'm back at it again and had to shave all my hair off (AGAIN).  The three things I need to remember are:    Avoid ""trance"" pulling sessions.  I stop these from happening by making myself aware of what I am feeling when I want to pull.  I concentrate on the physical sensations of the EMOTIONS instead of the physical sensation of feeling, finding and pulling.  Am I freaking out?  Am I over thinking?  Am I bored?  What does that feel like PHYSICALLY? Breathe.  Breathe through the urge and whatever uncomfortable sensations that come from NOT pulling.  Breathe through the anxiety of not pulling.  Breathe, breathe, breathe. Only touch my head with an open palm.  Kind of a petting motion.  I read this somewhere on this thread and it has helped me immensely.  Be super aware of when I am touching my head and that I only use an open palm.   Of course, these are my goals--not my reality.  Bad days happen.  In two days, I can and have caused severe damage.

That is AMAZING, and I fully congratulate you on that. And that's what you need to look at, what you need to remind yourself. You went X hours without it, not that you ""couldn't make it a day"". Baby steps, seriously. As /u/abbeys13 said, you have the will to stop, and that's step 1. That's a big step. The first step, while it doesn't always seem it, is always the hardest."

Trichsters,1s2dx5,courtabee,8,Wed Dec 4 08:29:32 2013 UTC,"I have found that winter is the perfect time to put on a hat. I wear a beanie around the house to keep from pulling, plus it keeps you warm! Get a fidget toy or puzzle or something to do with your hands to keep yourself from missing the hair under the hat.   I know it feels like you are ""weird"" or the only one who does this, but I promise we all have our own struggles. Many of us pull hair, some people pick their skin or their nails, some people deal with anxiety by drinking or taking drugs. You are very normal for feeling things like depression and anxiety. Having those feelings is what makes you human. Since we are all unique we all have different solutions for how to cope, so you just have to find what works for you. Be patient and don't get discouraged, things can get better. Good luck!"
Trichsters,1s2dx5,kapelin,4,Wed Dec 4 11:44:49 2013 UTC,"Yes, wearing a knit cap helps a lot ever since I've been living in the Arctic. It's gotten worse with my SAD, so having a hat on hand is really good. Know you're not alone, and the fact that other people are commenting on this confirms that. I suggest taking up something like knitting/sewing/cross stitch to help satisfy your wants for messing with fibrous things, and you can do it while you watch TV and whatnot. I know that I've really benefited from cross stitching and knitting, plus, you can make some cool stuff.  Best of luck."

If you need/want to keep a beard, just like anything else it's a matter of controlling yourself, keeping your hands occupied, keeping stress manageable - and therein anxiety at bay.   Do you find yourself playing with your facial hair more in certain situations? I've noticed that male trich is less common than female, especially in adults. However, I have noticed that LOTS of men around the office twirl, pick, and pluck when they think no one is looking. These are guys that I've never see missing lashes, brows, hair etc though.

The clinical studies were about 9 or 12 weeks long I believe? And the researchers said that that was barely long enough because that's when the effects became more constant or consistent or something like that?

Trichsters,1rg7g4,shoesonmyfeet,3,Tue Nov 26 00:33:41 2013 UTC,"As I understand it, the clear portion is known as the follicle. The follicle comes out only sometimes, depending on the age of the hair. Newer hairs have the largest follicle and they get smaller until they disappear as the hair gets older. The colored tip at the end is the bulb, and is where the blood supply connects to the follicle."
Trichsters,1rg7g4,catsandcake,9,Tue Nov 26 01:00:57 2013 UTC,"It's actually called the sheath; when you pull a hair out you don't remove the follicle, you remove the contents of the follicle."

Trichsters,1rh2n9,AVA605,6,Tue Nov 26 04:38:34 2013 UTC,"My hair pulling always gets worse as the school year goes on, so I totally understand how it is. I'd like to apologize in advance for the length of my post, I write too much :P   What are urges to pull like, and what causes them (if anything)?   For me, the urge to pull is pretty much just that. I just really, really, really want to pull even though I know I shouldn't. Like, if I'm in a place where I can't pull, I'll literally start fantasizing about getting to my car and pulling.   As far as causes, everybody's triggers can be different. Caffeine, boredom, high stress, lack of sleep, and being upset are a few of mine. There are a lot of different triggers, so you would have to ask her to get her specific triggers.   Those who have recovered almost completely, what was the process like and what helped you to stop?   My hair pulling used to be a lot worse before I figured out that I shouldn't be doing it. It took some hardcore willpower to reduce it to the point where I have it now (a few hairs a day at the most). The biggest step for me was constant awareness of where my hands were and knowing that it was bad and I should stop. Honestly, I felt like a total freak and that helped motivate me a bit. Depending on the severity and the type (which I'll explain in the answer to the next question) different tools/methods may be required. If it's severe, I would definitely recommend a therapist. If it's moderate, a therapist would still be recommended, but she might be able to lessen it without. If it's mild, some simple things can greatly help.   I personally, have it mildly unless it's really acting up (then I consider myself on the low end of moderate). The [Trichotillomania Learning Center](www.trich.org) sells some little toys/stress balls that can help, but you could definitely find some stuff that could help at a toy store or maybe even Wal-Mart or Target. Spinner rings can help as well. I have a spinner ring, a Tangle in my car and one on my nightstand, and three stress balls.   Can pulling become a completely subconscious habit?   First, I will say that you may want to be careful with the word habit. I don't think it would offend most people, but there are some people out there who think of this just a stupid/silly habit and if someone with trich has encountered an individual like that (especially if the individual was vocal about it), they may not be too happy with the word habit. I use the word behaviour just to be on the safe side.  Anyway, this behaviour has two forms, focused and automatic. A lot of people have it both ways. Focused means the individual knows what they are doing and they're typically looking for a specific type of hair ('dat texture... it's not just texture that people look for, but that's a really common one). Automatic means that the person doesn't even realize what they're doing. They might just ""wake up"" from a hypnotic-like state, look over, and see a pile of hair. So yeah, this behaviour can be subconscious; though again, many people will deal with both at some point. I almost exclusively deal with the focused type, so if anyone should see something wrong with my description of automatic, please correct me.   Is there anything that I could possibly do to help my girlfriend?   Some of this stuff might be different for you and your girlfriend, this is coming from the perspective of a guy who is ridiculously stubborn when he's upset.  Honestly, there's not too much anyone other than the sufferer can do to lessen the behaviour. BUT you have a VERY important job... Be there for her. Hair pulling tends to be a private behaviour, so unless you're around her 24/7, you can't stop everything. When you are together, you might try to plan activities that keep her hands occupied , help her avoid triggers, etc. But again, there's only so much you can do in that sense.  Back you your IMPORTANT job. and for more emphasis, this job is IMPORTANT. Accept her, no matter what (sounds like you're doing a good job, I just gotta emphasize this). Relapses are very common. I went about two years with a minimal level of pulling then my depression started trying to come back last month and my pulling went way up (I'm talking two massive bald spots and a small one, one that was about 1/3 of my stomach, one in my pubic area, and the small one on the back of my head). It can make you feel like absolute crap. Here's a glimpse into my mind after my relapse... Ahem You've gone so long without pulling (or in my case, barely pulling) and then suddenly you're right back where you started. What's the point in trying to stop? It's just gonna come back if you work at it. It's not worth the effort. End Scene  A relapse can bring total hopelessness. This is where you come in. Don't make her feel like a freak for pulling (again, it doesn't sound like you are, just emphasizing) and be there for her. Sometimes, just letting her vent can do a lot.  I think I covered everything that you asked. If you have any other questions, let me know. I'd be more than happy to help you understand this condition better.  Oh, and if she has tweezers, maybe think about hiding them. I kinda wish someone would hide my tweezers."
Trichsters,1rh2n9,classiccriminal5805,3,Tue Nov 26 17:04:23 2013 UTC,"School and computer work have that perfect combination of tedium and anxiety that inspire pulling sessions (I've found, anyway). That's why it's always easy to fall back into bad habits after a summer of being active and physical. Urges to pull...have you ever watched the movie Arachnaphobia, where the spiders breed all over and fill up that guy's house and start attacking him and his family? Did you notice that after watching that movie, it felt like you had bugs crawling all over you (even though you knew you didn't, really) and you HAD to scratch yourself to rid yourself of that bug-crawling feeling? The urge to pull is like the urge to scratch yourself after watching the movie Arachnaphobia. You realize there's no physical reason to do it, but you can't help yourself. Pulling can be a completely subconscious habit. Some people can ""trance out"" and start pulling their hair without realizing it, like while watching TV and stuff. Conversely, it also can be a very focused, almost ritual habit at other times. Sometimes it's both at once! Those seemingly opposite situations create difficulty for identifying and counteracting triggers. ""I'd better watch TV/use my laptop while running on a treadmill so I don't pull my hair out..."" Needless to say, sometimes there are no perfect solutions. Living with trich: Even if you don't suffer from significant social anxiety from it, it's always kind of a hassle. I'm sure all of us probably would rather have something much better to do than count hairs and pick at ourselves half the day, yet here we are. Then there's the makeup tricks and other camouflage devices that take time to deal with. Then there's the awkwardness of talking about it in situations where people will invariably notice, like during swimming or at the hair salon. It's a pain in the ass! Honestly, the best thing you can ""do"" is act like it's not a big deal, that you don't think she's a freak show, that it's just one of those things. Which it is, when you get down to it. It's like people who clear their throat or adjust their junk rather more often than others.    ""Why don't you just stop"" is a particularly non-constructive thing to say, since DUH, we would if we could! It's not like a weight problem when you ""just go on a diet."" It's more like telling someone who gets a bad reaction to bug bites to ""make them not itch."""
Trichsters,1rh2n9,idiosyncrassy,1 point,Wed Nov 27 00:17:58 2013 UTC,"What are urges to pull like, and what causes them (if anything)?   Like OCD, it's just one of those things you feel like you have to do, and until then, you feel kind of anxious and uncomfortable. Sometimes there is a feeling of euphoria after pulling out hairs which contributes to the psychological reward system.   Those who have recovered almost completely, what was the process like and what helped you to stop?    I don't know how possible this is. My trich goes into remission for years but it seems to keep coming back. Along with that, the compulsion has a tendency to manifest itself in other ways (like picking at my skin or scalp). I'd suggest trying to transfer the habit into something that isn't so p potentially damaging. Something to relieve the need to perform the habitual action. There's gotta be something out there, like a stress toy or something.   Can pulling become a completely subconscious habit?    Yes.   Is there anything that I could possibly do to help my girlfriend?   Just be supportive and understanding. Personally, I hate when I'm pulling/picking and someone tells me to stop, but it works for some people. Ask her if that's something that could help. Also, if it's stress-related, try and help her relax. Back rubs are nice!"
Trichsters,1rh2n9,welshcorgis,1 point,Tue Nov 26 18:15:19 2013 UTC,"I always find it helpful that my roommate lets me know when I'm doing it. I do it subconsciously so if they tell me I am doing it I can stop myself. Just don't try to be the one who gets her to quit. My roommate gets upset with me when I've been doing it too much because I told him that I want to quit, so he's trying to help but it's in a negative way.   Keeping myself busy has helped me slow down. If I play video games or do anything that involves both hands I tend to not let them wander to pull.  Honestly for me, the urge is just the fact that my eyelashes exist (I'm a lash puller). I am constantly aware of them and it kinda drives me crazy."
Trichsters,1rh2n9,stacyeatstoast,1 point,Wed Nov 27 00:47:39 2013 UTC,"Reading this post I felt like you were my boyfriend due to the insane similarities but I pull my eyelashes and eyebrows only so definitely not me. My boyfriend has wondered the same and honestly I never know what to tell him. When I'm around him I never pull and I'm happy and have been doing so much better with him. But when the stress kicks in....it's the struggle of your life. I have finals today and tomorrow and just had an insanely bad night and shot him a text at around 4am just to let him know I was having a hard time. The hardest part for me after a hard night is facing other people, especially those you love and who want you to succeed, and letting them see that you failed. That you did this to yourself yet again. And all that hard work that you had, all those days of growth and not pulling, were gone in one single stupid night.  So the most important thing for you to do is honestly love her unconditionally and giver her a big hug and let her know that she is beautiful, that everything will be okay, and that you still believe in her and always will. Tell her that she is learning more about it through each experience and getting stronger. Tell her that she can do it, and that every one has bad days, and not to beat herself up and there is only so much she can do with the stress.  Tell her that one day the stress will end and she will be able to spend nights with you helping her and not having to worry about finals and tests. Tell her that no matter what she is beautiful inside and out and that trich does not define her, it is just a battle she has to face, everyone has a battle.  Tell her that I'm rooting for her and that I wish her the best. She can do this, although it will be hard, and it will always be a thought present in her mind forever. It will just be controlled. You are an amazing boyfriend and I am so happy she has someone like you. You have no idea what it means. Trich is a very lonely and hopeless disorder. And you are that hope to her."

Trichsters,1raxvc,longtimetrich,2,Sat Nov 23 19:55:48 2013 UTC,"Hi there! I don't know if you've done this already, but I find it useful to keep a journal of the exact instances I pull. Knowing what situations are triggers can help you prepare. Catching yourself will be easier once you've identified at least some problem areas.  I also seem to limit myself to split ends/knotted strands. What may help is keeping your head hair/facial hair trimmed in order to limit the amount of splitting. Using conditioner/moisturizer will be especially helpful toward this end.  I also keep a stress ball in my bag to take with me when I'm in class, studying or wherever - it's just something to keep your hands occupied.  And if you can, I'd recommend seeing a therapist - especially someone well-versed in impulse-control disorders.  Hope some of this helps!"

As soon as you notice yourself running your fingers through your hair, tell yourself ""is this really what I want to do? No. It's not"". Most of the time I don't really realize I started pulling untill it's too late. So this has helped me lots.   And then have something to keep your hands occupied does wonders. I have one of those koosh balls at work to just hold in my hands when I feel urges. Works wonders for me. I managed to grow a mustache for November because of this. Usually it would be patchy/half missing by 3 days because of all the pulling."

With patches and uneveness, I can usually only wear wigs (if I bother to cover them at all), since my hair is too short for weave. This has lead to some scrutiny over the years, though I'm sure my issues are not unique to me/black women.   This is especially the case when it comes to the issue of having family not be understanding. I've had this since middle school; I'm a college senior now and they still refuse to believe there is anything wrong with me or my sister (who almost assuredly has a form of OCD)."

Trichsters,1r8jj3,purpleoreo,1 point,Fri Nov 22 22:53:09 2013 UTC,"That's really interesting. I know I have a complex around the way I view my hair, but I think my pulling stems primarily around anxiety. Has the plucking been easier to manage with time?   While the family may not be supportive, it's gotten at least a little bit better for me after I maturing and becoming a bit more accepting of my hair and appearance. Still, the family aspect is important to self-acceptance; cultural norms especially are firmly entrenched in the defining factors that determine self-worth."

The patches on my scalp are easier to hide if I straighten my hair and wear extensions, so my issues are a little different than yours, although I definitely understand how hair affects your life. It's almost a social thing with the women of colour that are in my life, so sometimes its embarrassing when they want to play with my hair or extensions.

I don't know the date of my own current progress, but I am also an eyelash/eyebrow attacker and recently got much more controlled than I ever have been - didn't know the reason but was just really pleased. Your post makes me realize that the timing correlated with changing my shift at work, and because of the time adjustment, it has resulted in me quickly rubbing at my eyes in the shower rather than scrubbing at them with water and a washcloth in front of the mirror. Not the sort of thing that you would ever think would make a difference but... Just wanted to thank you for bringing my attention to the possible cause of improvement. Hopefully we can both keep the lessened pulling up!"
Trichsters,1r74gp,pantherwest,2,Fri Nov 22 06:38:15 2013 UTC,Glad I could be of an assitance! Definitely try to avoid putting water on your face. I feel like it dries out the eyes/eyelashes and leads to the discomfort.

I recently started again (few years back in high school) after another wave of pulling came again. I've always struggled, but it got pretty intense in high school- I'm on my eyes, eyebrows, and top of my head. I'm on anxiety meds, see a therapist, have a spinner ring, a bracelet, wash my face in the shower, and still. I guess it's different for everyone. I just have less impulse control.

I think a lot of us have gone through years without knowing what was the problem exactly, just feeling like what we did was freaky, shameful and gross.  I found out via a episode of CSI funnily enough. And that was after I had consulted with a professional - who dismissed it as ""just a bad habit"", and I guess its easy to write it off as such - but painful when you feel shame for doing something and you don't know where to turn for help.    Stress and anxiety tend to make it worse - So try not to beat yourself up too much for doing what you are doing. It is a actual impulse control disorder that is listed in the DSM-V. There are treatment options if you wish to pursue them, the diagnosis is more commonly known in the medical field these days - and if not it is so easy to teach them with the resources we now have.

A group of researchers investigated and found that it might be able to treat trich in some cases.  From the study: ""Patients assigned to receive N-acetylcysteine had significantly greater reductions in hair-pulling symptoms as measured using the Massachusetts General Hospital Hair Pulling Scale (P < .001) and the Psychiatric Institute Trichotillomania Scale (P = .001). Fifty-six percent of patients ""much or very much improved"" with N-acetylcysteine use compared with 16% taking placebo (P = .003). Significant improvement was initially noted after 9 weeks of treatment.""  So, while the sample size was small, it did have an positive impact on people after around the 2 month mark of treatment A potentially harmful effect of NAC is tat it might damage the respiratory system at high dosages (http://www.jci.org/articles/view/29444).  I'm being treated by the Dr. who wrote the paper. He's currently doing a study on inositol and its effects on trich at my school.

Trichsters,1r59i0,StrangeQuark1,2,Thu Nov 21 18:40:37 2013 UTC,"I've had trich since before I can remember. I had a brief hiatus in grade 5 for a few months which was amazing, but it came back soon enough and since then my record has been 11 days without pulling hair/picking at my skin.  I tried cipralex a few years back for a few months, but it had no effect whatsoever for my condition. Unfortunately it had a problematic side effect so I didn't take it religiously after the first two months or so which means that I may not have given it a fair chance. I noticed no change except for this one side effect which was frustrating since intuitively, if it can do one negative thing for my body, it should also have it's intended effect.  I've considered trying other medication, but I haven't had time to visit a  doctor/the psychiatrist I was seeing before I started my new job."
Trichsters,1r59i0,daddio48,2,Thu Nov 21 21:26:46 2013 UTC,What was the side effect?
Trichsters,1r59i0,daddio48,2,Thu Nov 21 22:18:57 2013 UTC,"Well if you must know, it made my penis numb. Made anything sex related not fun"

Trichsters,1r46i7,HeySagey,10,Thu Nov 21 04:10:58 2013 UTC,"I think its safe to say you are. For most diagnoses Id say no to self diagnosing, but really there isnt much other options then trich if your problem is what you say it is.   So yes, you belong! Telling your doc could be beneficial so you can be referred to a behavioural program or talk about treatment options. But a lot of trichsters never seek medical attention due to shame and stigma, just like you.   If you do pull and eat however it could be pertinent for you to talk to a doc as that should go on record (due to possible gastric problems)."
Trichsters,1r46i7,skamnorth,8,Thu Nov 21 04:27:42 2013 UTC,"Yes you definitely are. I've never told anyone that I pull/eat my beard and body hair, and noone has noticed or asked. But reading others' experiences here leaves me in no doubt that I am,  and you are also based on what you've said."
Trichsters,1r46i7,Bandit72,4,Thu Nov 21 09:49:23 2013 UTC,"I'm the same, never mentioned it to a doctor, I've recently (since discovering what it's called) become quite open about it with friends and family, but never really seen the need to talk to a medical pro about it.  My doctor may not know, but my chin and pubes sure do!"
Trichsters,1r46i7,TheBestWifesHusband,2,Thu Nov 21 09:51:08 2013 UTC,"I started pulling 4 years ago now and didn't see a doctor until last summer.  I have a ridiculous aversion to shrinks, and besides my hair pulling, I've been physically and mentally fine.  But I ""self-diagnosed"" myself with trich on the grounds that I spend hours every day pulling my hair, have had several large bald spots, and anxiety related to pulling, etc... .    When I did finally go to my GP last summer I just told her that'd I'd be pulling my hair and that I was pretty sure I had trich. She did a quick inspection of my hair and prescribed me fluoxetine and a recommendation to a therapist. No questions asked- I pretty much told her that I had trich and she just went along with it.   The thing about trich is that the symptoms are all physical, even though the causes may not be.  There may be borderline cases where your manifestation of symptoms is not 'severe' enough to be diagnosed, but I'm sure those are few and far between.  So if you do pull your hair out, I wouldn't hesitate to call yourself a trichster, for better or for worse."
Trichsters,1r46i7,querdertch,2,Thu Nov 21 21:05:39 2013 UTC,"There's very few mental disorders you can ""self-diagnose"", but trich is one of those things you can. If you're pulling hair out for no good reason and a lot of it, it's trich. I was never diagnosed (mom thought psychologists were pointless), but I think the fact I was eyebrowless for some time pretty much explains itself."
Trichsters,1r46i7,IgnorantThrall,0,Fri Nov 22 05:26:50 2013 UTC,Why does it matter? Its not some exclusive club.
Trichsters,1r46i7,MilkVetch,4,Fri Nov 22 04:24:23 2013 UTC,"I honestly don't know why it matters. It probably doesn't. But for some reason being undiagnosed just fills me with unnecessary anxiety being on the trich subreddit, forums, etc. I was just looking for some reassurance because my anxiety was getting to me. That's all."
Trichsters,1r2mme,bringfightintrousers,4,Wed Nov 20 17:49:20 2013 UTC,"I was 7 when I was diagnosed and this was a while back when only a few people we're even talking about trich. To begin with my mom somehow found Dr. Fred Penzel who happened to work in Huntington, NY. They decided it was time to drive from NC and ""visit my grandparents"" in Saint James.  There he helped them (and me) understand what was going on and recommended what we do next. My parents then found a wonderful child/family psychologist for therapy who consulted on a regular basis with a juvenile psychiatrist.  At the time because trich wasn't understood very well there weren't many drug options and the ones they put me on basically had a zombie effect and I didn't stay on them for long and most of my treatment consisted of therapy sessions. Even though the therapist had never had a trich patient she was amazing with children and did her research and made sure to contact specialists for advice when needed. Trich is complicated but a good psychologist is a good psychologist regardless of what condition their patient is asking for help with.  That being said, I believe medication can do a world of wonder and I know it has helped many people. But for me the most helpful thing was having an incredible therapist that I could talk openly with and (eventually) understanding parents. As a kid you know appearance matters and that other kids may notice you look weird but having parents that yell at you to get your hands down or berate you over ""why can you just stop?"" just makes it a thousand times worse and you begin to stress over letting them down and end up hiding your actions instead of letting your parents help you fix the problem. Just support your child and be there for them. If they question why you're taking them to doctors/therapists tell them the truth. Tell them you love them and worry that something is wrong and think they might benefit from outside listeners. Tell them they're beautiful no matter what and that it's not about how trich affects their appearance, its about them coming to understand why they have trich. If they start subconsciously pulling in front of you instead of yelling at them throw them some tinkering toys or silly putty and they'll understand. You don't need to say anything just give them a loving grin. Basically, talk to some specialists, read some books, give your kid someone to talk to and just be there for them. The bigger of a deal you make this to be the more freaked their going to get and it will just make it worse.  Oh, and with the therapists, often at the end of the appointments while the kid waits outside the room they have the parents give them a run down on how things are going and how the parents themselves are dealing with things and recommend tinkering toys. Tell the kid this. Even at 7 I was paranoid enough to think my therapist was spilling everything I told her to my mom. They had a good laugh when I refused to utter a word because of this."
Trichsters,1r2mme,projectemily,2,Thu Nov 21 06:36:58 2013 UTC,"This is extremely helpful. Thank you.  I do my best to be supportive. No yelling or berating.  Have explained to her that I know she is not purposely doing it and suggested that if she realises she is, to find something else for her hands to do. I also acknowledged that's hard.  When we first started taking her to the doctor we explained that it was because we were worried that her skin might get infected and we wanted the doctor to check it out, and now, we explained we're going to the counsellor to get some ""tips and tricks"" on how to help her distract her hands. I didn't think of the ""someone to talk to"" part of it and I will tell her that today.  Again, thank you.  It is good to have a perspective from someone who has been there."
Trichsters,1r2mme,projectemily,2,Thu Nov 21 12:04:49 2013 UTC,"Glad I could help. Also, my favorite thing in school to keep my hands busy with was a kneaded eraser because it was kind of like silly putty but less sticky and since it was technically an eraser it didn't draw much attention to myself and I could mash it with one hand while I did class work with the other. When things were really bad and I was almost bald I began wearing thin gloves at home because if I couldn't feel the texture of my hair it was far less enticing and eventually my mom helped me pick up crocheting which definitely kept my hands crazy busy when relaxing with the family in the evening."

I would actually suggest starting with cognitive behavioural therapy (http://trich.org/treatment/options-cognitive.html) because it's found to be most likely to work if implemented early on in treatment. I would ask her provider if they have experience in CBT and if they don't, if they could recommend someone in the area who does. I wish you luck!"

They include serious drowsiness, confusion, anorexia, and it's known as ""dopeamax"" by those who have used it because it makes you stupid. I had moments where I literally could not remember my name. I would not recommend the use of that drug on a young child."

Trichsters,1qyqni,KopiteKing13,2,Tue Nov 19 08:15:58 2013 UTC,"Have you thought about just buzzing your head really close or shaving it for awhile?   I've had it for five-ish years (only on facial hair) and I had the same dilemma; keeping it long and pulling because it would start to be noticeable if I left it short. Finally I saw a therapist, started taking NAC and shaved it all off for a couple months (I also look like a small child without a beard). I think the combo of NAC plus having no hair to pull was really crucial for me. Now it's grown back in and I'm almost two months pull free.   Just my opinion, but I think being away from home for the first time could give you more freedom to maybe step outside the box and really give yourself the best chance possible to getting to no pulling. I'm also not even two years removed from school so once I moved out into a big city I just decided one day that I wanted to put all I had into trying to stop my trich. I know it's not easy and I still have my vulnerable moments but it can be done!  Meditation also helped me out a lot, even though I didn't think it would and I know it might not be for some people. But that's the key, finding out what works for YOU. Good luck!"

Trichsters,1qxolq,crisis_cakes,2,Fri Nov 22 04:30:08 2013 UTC,"I think the most helpful catalyst was NAC and Inositol.  (Both are found at drugstores/supplement stores).   My urges didn't disappear but it did make them controllable.  Also, sadly I think part of it was just self-will.  I was at the point where I was considering a wig, and I just made a snap decision that I wasn't going to go down that road.   I've found that taking every day minute by minute and hour by hour, instead of setting huge goals is extremely helpful.  I even have a little calendar where I use stickers to mark my progress!

Trichsters,1qus39,unitedjumboband,3,Sun Nov 17 23:21:43 2013 UTC,"Seems like you have a reasonably good attitude about it. Just keep in mind, don't beat yourself up if you fall off the bandwagon and start pulling again. It's okay, we've all been there. Just pick yourself back up and try again.  This is why I don't like counting ""pull free"" days, because as soon as you fail JUST ONCE it seems as if you're back to square one, and it's a very frustrating self-defeating system.   Also, good luck! :D"
Trichsters,1qus39,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Mon Nov 18 00:50:19 2013 UTC,"I definitely identify trich as a disease, like alcoholism and addiction. You may not have an addictive personality, but hair pulling is a chemical addiction. Your brain releases endorphins or something when you pull which it then develops a craving for. It's a similar theory to other forms of self harm like cutting. Willpower alone isn't always enough. Not saying that you shouldn't try! Just give yourself a break and don't focus on the negative."

Trichsters,1qh1ss,helix19,2,Wed Nov 13 01:57:46 2013 UTC,"While it is hard to do, I think you want to tell him because you want to be sure you are marrying someone who supports you.  Trich sucks - A LOT - but in a marriage, there is a high chance you will have to face something even harder/worse together.  Injury or illness or incompatible desires that emerge later (such as if you each find a ""dream job"" in different cities).  If he can't handle your trich, he is not the man to weather all those other things with.  That first paragraph is the ""tough love"" part.  The good news is that I think he will be able to handle your trich.  He has noticed something about your hair already - he might realize it already or he might be relieved to know a diagnosis.  It might take him a couple days to fully come to terms with it, or he might say some hurtful things on accident in the beginning, but I think it will turn out just fine."

In my personal experience, I'm just as likely to pull in public as in private.  I realize it makes me look like a crazy person, but the urge is VERY strong for me.  If people look at me, I just look at them back, like ""this is what I am doing right now, deal with it.""  I wish I was more susceptible to social pressures, honestly, but I'm not.

Trichsters,1qcj1v,mildly_stressed,2,Mon Nov 11 13:18:27 2013 UTC,Thanks for that. I had done an app search but thought maybe someone had tried one that didn't have 'trich' in the title. Perhaps one for breaking habits etc. I also saw that expensive one and am keen to give it a try but hoped maybe somebody had already been the guinea pig with it? Thanks for your help though!
Trichsters,1qabdo,Hayleyfire,3,Sun Nov 10 03:25:21 2013 UTC,"It depends on how long you've been pulling, how often, and just the overall quality of your hair. The quality of each strand of hair will go down as its root gets more damaged after each pull. You can see this when hair gets unusually crinkly or super thin. One thing I do know is that if the pulled hair has blood at the end of it (like a red dot), then you completely destroyed the root and no hair will ever grow from that pore again."
Trichsters,1qabdo,shoesonmyfeet,2,Sun Nov 10 05:02:44 2013 UTC,"Mine always grows back well enough, and pretty fast, but not immediately. I can hardly tell where my patches were before. The thing is for me trich comes and goes, so no one spot is pulled from for longer than a few months at a time; however it's always the same spots. So for me, even with that amount of damage off and on for the last 10+ years, it comes back in better than I could hope for. There's always hope! For now, if you can, just find a good place to part your hair to look more even (I always put my part to the left now). Look into the best hair care routines you can manage and treat your hair nicely- the better you treat it, the more you'll want to keep it up AND the faster and thicker it will grow in."
Trichsters,1qabdo,lurrz,2,Sun Nov 10 04:40:39 2013 UTC,"Hair is extraordinarily resilient, and I doubt that you have done too much to destroy your hair. Eyelashes, on the other hand, after a while will not grow back (I pull both, and while my hair is totally fine, I've noticed that it's usually eyelashes that take longer and longer to grow back) You can also look for tips on the internet to style your hair, and get a new haircut/style so that trich is hidden while your hair grows back!   If you need anything, feel free to PM me :)"
Trichsters,1qabdo,ShittyDuckFace,1 point,Sun Nov 10 20:38:50 2013 UTC,The fact about the pore or root bleeding after pulling is true.  Source: Esthetician in family and have been pulling for almost 10+ years (so far every type of hair has grown back).
Trichsters,1qabdo,GrilledCheeseMcGee,1 point,Sat Nov 16 08:01:30 2013 UTC,"I used to pull clumps of hair from the root. I attacked the sides of my head, mostly. At first the hair grew back thin and wavy. They stuck out and looked terrible. I decided to get my hair cut short to even everything out. Miraculously, my hair ended up growing out looking even better than it had before I developed trich. I am currently 12 years trich free and my hair is totally normal. I would recommend getting as much control as you can over your situation and then getting a real short haircut to kind of ""start over."" Best of luck!"
Trichsters,1q7kwm,Inkbyamanda,6,Fri Nov 8 23:04:22 2013 UTC,"YOU GO GLEN COCO.  But for serious, good job!  I find that coloring my hair darker works best for me (I am naturally blonde and mainly pull coarse dark hairs). Bleaching your hair generally makes it thinner so if you want to try something like that, it might work?   Otherwise, with other pulling, I've mainly stuck with a goal-and-reward method. ""If I don't pull for x days, I get to do/have y."" If you have a therapist, ask them for suggestions. If you don't, think about talking to someone and asking for suggestions."
Trichsters,1q7kwm,fivefootpantsgator,1 point,Sat Nov 9 05:50:54 2013 UTC,Thank you!   I find that the reward method helps.   I do dye my hair frequently.   It has something to do with being happy with my hair that gives me a little more motivation to not to pull.

Trichsters,1q4o9r,Inkbyamanda,1 point,Thu Nov 7 22:57:27 2013 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as /u/Inkbyamanda. I've been taking NAC for maybe two months now & what I have found (so far) is that is hasn't taken away the urge the pull but rather the intensity? (if that makes sense) I find that if I am pulling I can stop & I also don't ""attack"" my lashes with the same fury that I did before taking NAC. To keep my hands busy I have found that Silly Putty works well for me; has the right consistency & texture, not sticky & it molds well. Hope this helps! Wishing you only the best of luck :)"
Trichsters,1q4o9r,darrylmacstone,1 point,Fri Nov 8 00:01:22 2013 UTC,I took NAC for a while. It reduced the intensity at first but then I gradually started pulling more again. I think it has to do with the fact that I take hormone supplements and anti tumor meds. This may have reduced the NAC's effectiveness.
Trichsters,1q4o9r,stupid_likeafox,1 point,Fri Nov 8 02:12:50 2013 UTC,"My only pull zone was facial hair (for about 5 years) and I've been on NAC for a couple months and coupled with shaving it all off for about a month, I'm pull free for about two months.  The toys also work, I've got a mala bead bracelet that I wear around and helps me out (plus it looks good!).   Another think that at least I think helped me become more aware of when I was doing it was by practicing some meditation and/or breathing exercises. It's probably not for everyone and I didn't think it would be for me but it calmed me down and made me more cognizant of what was going on rather than being zoning out and letting the pulling get triggered.  Good luck! It can definitely be done."

If I act casual about it like it's not big deal I get a casual response. I used to stay away from hairdressers because I was afraid of the response I could get, like they would react in a way that would make me feel like a freak, but that has never happened.  In fact, the handful of hairdressers I have been to over the years have all known someone with trich in their friends or family. I think it's more common than we may think."
Trichsters,1pry9m,Brainkissed,5,Sun Nov 3 03:43:35 2013 UTC,"I don't pull from my head, but I pull my eyebrows so I had this experience when I went to get my makeup done. I basically said, ""I have a condition that causes my eyebrows to be very thin, and I am very self-conscious about it so I would really appreciate if you could just fill them in to look as normal as possible"". The woman was really sweet about it and didn't ask any more questions. She filled them in and asked what I thought, I asked if she could fill in more on the really bald spot and she did and I went on my way. I gave her a very good recommendation on the optional survey."
Trichsters,1pry9m,kapelin,4,Sun Nov 3 15:06:34 2013 UTC,"i've had amazing conversations with my hairdresser about trich. she actually has a sister who pulls her eyelashes and eyebrows so she was really happy to be able to ask me questions, since her sister was very self-conscious about her trich. i think the more open and honest you are about it, the better. in my opinion, hairdresser should know about disorders that can affect hair growth, so the more information they get, the better. i was not treated like a freak or a weirdo and i enjoyed my haircut for the first time in over ten years."
Trichsters,1pry9m,sparklezombie,4,Sun Nov 3 15:07:05 2013 UTC,"Wow, I forget how much I can relate to people when I visit this sub.   When the whole Trich thing really started to become noticeable, I was at the hairdresser, who is a long time family friend, and she was like ""your hair is thinning out on the top. This is so odd. Do you sometimes keep your wet hair in a pony tail right after you shower? Lemme get your mom"" and it was from that point on I knew something was wrong with me. So I went home and researched it and that's when I knew I had Trich.   When I was on a cruise, I told the hairdresser that I wanted my hair straightened for formal night. I knew once he took my hair out of it's bun he would see my spot so i prewarned him. I didn't say what it was, I just told him that I have a big bald spot on the back of my head. He asked if I've seen a doctor, i said yes. When he straightened my hair, I asked him to style my hair in a certain way that would cover my spot, and he did.   I agree, you have to act casual with it because the hairdresser will be casual with you too."
Trichsters,1pry9m,RachelBabyCakez,2,Sun Nov 3 15:11:34 2013 UTC,I usually say it's from chemical breakage from trying to straighten my hair... I have a pretty small spot though.

I barely went to get my hair cut but I managed to get the same lady again but eventually I was rotated, and I had to deal with that BS again explaining.  Sometimes I wouldn't bother telling people as my hair was getting better. It was still annoying dealing with the hairdressers complaining my hair. It was ""uneven here"", it was ""thinner there"", and ""you have a bunch of split ends"".  Over time, I stopped going but then my trich got a lot better. I was pull free for a very long time and my hair was down to my shoulders (straightened). I rewarded myself to a haircut, and I had to deal with hearing complaints about how my hair is so thick and hard to deal with. (curly, ethnic hair) That was discouraging.

Luckily I've stopped for half a year so far and my lashes are back, but they grow straight now. I use an eyelash curler if I'm going out. I've always had this one lash on my lower lid that grows sideways (even before trich), and I pull it out whenever I notice it but it hasn't stopped growing sideways. So I think it's more likely that with tweezing it'll stop growing at all than for it to start growing normally. I found this interesting condition, trichiasis, which I'd never heard of and could be relevant."

Unfortunate for me, the lashes that grow back are not soft, but very stiff, kind of like horse hair, when I run my fingers over them. It's prompted me to pluck out the ones that ""don't belong"" and aren't soft and have a pointed tip to them. These just seems as though they've been cut off with scissors. I cannot offer any advice, as I don't know, but from experience, I believe those that are growing in odd directions have to do with the pore on the eyelid. I have a couple of pores that are very near my eye, so the eyelashes grow diagonally towards my eye. I pluck those out for health reasons (I think.. or I may just pull them out.) I hope you find the answers your looking for!"

You may also try a shorter lash, this way it doesn't have the extra weight bringing them down. Don't forget to let the glue set for the required amount of time before applying to your lash.

Trichsters,1pcqhi,jdv2121,10,Mon Oct 28 01:28:36 2013 UTC,"I'm commenting because the other comment is not helpful.  Cut it and wear a hat until it grows in.  Take Biotin to help it grow.  Wear a hat at all times, if you can, or a scarf tied kind of tight.  Ball your fists when you want to pull.  Fight your brain.  Tell it no.  Say it out loud. It's an unpleasant feeling, but your body can take the anxiety.  If you can learn to recognize the feeling before you pull, you can stop pulling."
Trichsters,1pcqhi,jenlyn1123,3,Mon Oct 28 10:52:11 2013 UTC,Always carry silly putty with you! It helps keep your fingers busy. Best of luck.
Trichsters,1pcqhi,ThatsATallGlassOfNo,3,Mon Oct 28 12:17:25 2013 UTC,"This might not be the best advice but focus somewhere else. When you get the urge to pull, grab some tweezers and pluck at pesky leg hairs. I used to have no eyebrows, eyelashes, and a large bald spot on the top of my head. The urge has never gone away, but I've managed to focus it mainly on eyebrow hairs(more like incessant grooming) and leg hairs. My eyebrows are always neat now."
Trichsters,1pcqhi,Maloxxa,2,Thu Oct 31 22:03:58 2013 UTC,"One thing that has helped me was to really work through every tiny piece of the process to find out where the biggest joy lies. For me, while pulling by itself is satisfying, it is playing with it afterwards that is the biggest factor. When I told myself that even if I do pull, I won't get to play with it it helped to not do it in the first place. I have no clue if this is how it works for anybody else but it was helpful to me"

I plan on sharing my own story soon, as I think it would be rather cathartic to do so. Anywho, we're not alone! Some people have had great success with a few tactics. Keeping your hands busy during idle time is very important for me. I have a set of bucky balls (magnetic spheres) that I try to entertain myself with while watching movies.

I won't go into details about it but suffice to say it's become a very draining and time consuming ritual. Sometimes it will make me late for things... My hair is probably about shoulder length now. Or longer. Not sure, I keep it up a lot so it's pretty wavy. I blow dry it sometimes but I only straighten it maybe a couple times a year (usually just to see how long it really is). I fantasize about shaving my head so often."
Trichsters,1p7cy3,terrevasts,3,Fri Oct 25 17:20:39 2013 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! It feels really good to know I'm not the only one.  People don't really realize it but I just can't control myself- if my hair is down, I can just see the little white ends, tell-tale breakage signs, and I go crazy. I could sit for hours in my bathroom at home, going through my hair with scissors in hand, trying to find every one.  I think the worst part is knowing that I can't stop mainly because I can't accept what it's doing to me. I'll sit there and think, ""It's just getting rid of split ends, that's GOOD for my hair, isn't it?"" And it winds up feeling almost productive, twistedly enough."
Trichsters,1p7cy3,SeaBeggar,2,Fri Oct 25 17:28:56 2013 UTC,"I know what you mean! I have never pulled my eyebrows but my hair on top only. And it's bad. When my hair was long I had scissors with me to cut my split ends and would always ""hunt"" for them as well. Once you get going, it's hard to stop looking for those white balls.   I have a wig now (quite expensive, yay for being an adult!) and after shaving it, I've not pulled in 2 months (w/the help of the wig). I'm cautiously optimistic as I've had non-pulling sprees in the past but always relapsed.  Sorry I don't have more advice for you but I say, cut your hair if you find your trich getting out of control. :)"

I think if I can start short and not pull it then maybe I'll be stronger by the time it grows out again. I'm going to miss my long hair, is all.  It's quite long, fine and naturally pin-straight, and I always have people telling me how lovely my hair is. I've nonchalantly sort of murmured the idea out there and already I've heard people say ""WHY would you want to cut your hair off? It's beautiful"" etc. I don't walk around telling people I have trich (and unless you are familiar with it I don't think anybody would realize it) so nobody really understands why, I've just been telling them that I can't stand it anymore. I'm not doing it to be fashionable. But I'm not going to explain that to everybody. I mean I'm sure they'll all be supportive and tell me how 'great' my haircut is, but I can already hear the whispers when I'm not around saying ""It looks nice, but it looked better long."" /sighs/"

Trichsters,1p5xvu,trichaddict,3,Fri Oct 25 01:31:32 2013 UTC,"I just found this subreddit--I've been at trichster for almost 17 years (since I was ten). I have a wig now (it was quite expensive) and lie constantly to everyone around me except my parents and husband. Do you ever feel fake when you lie to others? I've tried, but I feel an overwhelming shame and uncomfortableness when thinking about whether I should tell people what trich is."
Trichsters,1p5xvu,SeaBeggar,4,Fri Oct 25 07:29:20 2013 UTC,"Just to clarify, if you are wearing an expensive wig, who are you lying to?  I mean, I wore wigs for many years, and most people had absolutely no idea.  If there is one thing Trich has taught me, it's that people don't see anything they aren't looking for."
Trichsters,1p5xvu,clothes_girl,1 point,Fri Oct 25 16:37:09 2013 UTC,"Thanks for responding--I just got the wig almost two months ago (I'm 27 now) and it's changed my life. No more bandanas or hats (at work).   I lie to people when they comment on my hair. My (wig) hair is actually quite beautiful (I like to think this is what my natural hair would look like if I had never pulled, but who knows).   So, somewhat irony here, with my new wig, people have commented on how nice my hair looks. I've lied about who my hair dresser is, how it's so shiny and whatnot. Of course I feel embarrassed about volunteering the info about my trich but I also KNOW it's a disorder and that I SHOULDN'T be embarrassed---I just don't feel like they need to know. Or that I owe them the information. So I lie to them. But I do feel guilty b/c even though it may feel like a justified/understandable lie, I still lied and I do have a moral compass. So here I am. I'm obviously more okay w/lying (omitting) about my hair but I feel the weight of not being truthful. I think that I don't want people to judge me on something they know little about, so I err on the side of caution and protect myself.   I just hate that before I got the wig, I had to pretend that I was this person who loved wearing hats. That it was ""my style"", when it wasn't. Far from it. If I never have to wear another hat, I'd be so happy.  But people (my in-laws, my friends, friends from college, co-workers, etc.) constantly commented on my hats/headbands/bandanas and that made me super defensive and protective. So I got really good at lying. Even typing this I know what I should do and what guilt I shouldn't feel. And yet, knowing is not the same as feeling that way. I'm so thankful/grateful that the person closest to me, my husband, knows and is my advocate. I love him dearly. It's just not happening to him. He really thinks ""it's no big deal"" ""people will understand""--ergo, I should feel comfortable telling them. I just can't. Moreover, I don't want to. The hair place I went to was the first non-family environment that I showed my head to. I'd like to say it was freeing/liberating/comforting and it was to a certain extent, but I did only b/c I knew I wanted that wig. And I do feel comfortable w/them now. Another thing to be thankful for for sure.   Since my wig these last two months, I haven't pulled, thank God. Though my husband is thrilled, and I am too---albeit, I'm just more cautionately (sp?) thrilled. I've been here before. Gone though stages of non-pulling. My hair would grow back, I'd feel great and then BAM. Bald once again. I don't want to be bald. I hate it. And yet, that's what trich is. No one wants this, I know. So here's hoping the wig makes enough difference to keep my streak going. A big difference this time versus the other times, is they shaved my head for the wig. That was huge and seeing all the hair grow in evenly (mostly), is different. Even though now I have much more white hair than I realized (even though I'm 27!)."

I felt likethe dishonesty about my appearance was affecting my ability to have intimate relationships. I've been in therapy for about 3 years now, and I've gotten to the point where I don't need to wear wigs anymore (I wore them for about 10 years). The one thing I took away from wearing them was that no one with great hair has it natually. Cuts, colours, extensions. Hell, women with full heads of hair wear wigs to change things up :) if someone compliments you, smile and say thanks. If they ask about your stylist, tell them he's not taking on new clients right now. Then change the subject and forget about it. And keep in mind that it's distinctly possible that you've questioned someone about something they had no desire to discuss, and they politely deflected.

Trichsters,1p6hi1,Flamsterette,2,Fri Oct 25 07:01:04 2013 UTC,"Try to let go of feeling bad about it. I had an abusive home life as well, which of course correlated with and exacerbated my trich as a child.  Try to let go of the shame of trich. You are a survivor of abuse and as you said, trich was a coping technique to help you get through it. The key words being that you got through it. You are still here. Whatever coping techniques you used obviously worked for you if you are even a remotely semi-functioning individual today. It may not be everyone else's choice of a coping technique but the fact is that you got through what you went through because you had whatever coping techniques that worked for you. You are not broken, you don't need to be fixed. Obviously life is still hard and we fall back on our old coping techniques to survive. There is nothing wrong with this.  The best advice I can give is to get help for the underlying mental illnesses and stressors that drive us to use our 'undesireable' coping techniques. There are certain types of therapies (Cognitive behavioral therapy, rational emotive therapy just off the top of my head.) that can help us retrain our thought patterns and find new coping techniques and new ways of dealing with the stress and trauma in our lives.  The way I look at trich in myself- especially in the really bad points in my life- is very much the same way a lot of mothers choose to look at stretch marks during and after their pregnancies. Yeah, they're not attractive and it's not 'great', but it was something necessary that couldn't be helped and it helped to bring about great good. In my case, I probably could have hurt or killed myself if I didn't have the coping techniques that I had to get through the really hard spots in my life. It wasn't my fault that I didn't have the medical help or skills to deal with it in a different way that didn't impact my appearance as much as it did. But I'm still here and I'm grateful to anything that got me through the dark times.  As soon as I let go of the shame and the blame and started appreciating my survival skills and started re-training my brain in regards to how I felt about my trich I started pulling much, much less. I am not pull free nor will I ever strive to be so. But I look normal or close enough and that's good enough to me. For me, when I do pull too much I look to it as nothing but a sign that my brain and body are sending me to say that I need to brush up on my mental health skills and start taking better care of myself. It's my canary in the coal mine and I'm grateful that it's there.  I know that none of this may help you but sometimes I think that having a different perspective and putting a positive spin on things can be the best treatment for all sorts of unhealthy coping techniques that we pick up along the way. We may not always be able to control what we do, especially with near-compulsive disorders like trich, but what we can control is how we react to them and how much we let them control our lives.  I hope that you find something that works for you."

Of course the hardest part is the initial getting up, because I feel almost glued to where I am sitting, but if you can break past that and just get yourself to move it might make a world of difference. I find a change of scenery really helps. Go for a drive. Go for a walk/run. Go to the grocery store. Just get yourself out of that seat, however you choose to do that.

Trichsters,1oyhzk,OsoBarbilloso,2,Tue Oct 22 12:41:56 2013 UTC,If you find that some part of it is needing something to do with your fingers it might help to get some silly putty or a stress ball. On my desk right now I currently have two stress balls. Whenever I feel myself getting the urge I just pick them up and play with them. You can also pick up a pair of soft cotton beauty gloves and wear them when you frequently pull - for me it's reading or watching tv because my hands aren't really doing anything.   It's not by any means a cure but it seems to help some people keep the urges in check. Kinda like how chewing gum can help with quitting smoking - it gives the mouth something else to do when the urge is there.

Trichsters,1owy53,clothes_girl,6,Mon Oct 21 17:38:05 2013 UTC,"I'm in the camp that doesn't even shoot for being pull free. I completely accept my trich. I'm very open and honest about it, thereby reducing my sense of shame. My main goal has been to 'pull less' and stop fixating over it. As soon as I realized that it's been part of my life since I remember being me and it likely wasn't going anywhere, I found that I did better. I don't feel broken. I don't feel like I need to be fixed. It's a coping mechanism which has in its own way helped me get through some hard stuff either by being a stress-reliever in and of itself or by serving as a warning sign that I need further mental and emotional support in dealing with the challenges in my life.  I don't know if it works, but it works for me. As soon as I gave up trying and setting goals (which inevitably ended in failure) I noticed that I pulled significantly less. I now have a full head of shoulder length hair (first time since 12) and while it's patchy it's also goo enough and I forgive myself for it/see nothing wrong with it."
Trichsters,1owy53,iristhevirus,2,Mon Oct 21 20:35:34 2013 UTC,"Thank you!  Yes, I don't have goals, per se, but I really try to take care of myself enough to manage my pulling.  Like you, it's a sign to me of other, bigger, stressors."
Trichsters,1owy53,snailtaxi,4,Mon Oct 21 21:27:27 2013 UTC,"Wow, this is such a great question and I wish I had worthwhile advice; I think all I can say for certain is that I struggle with this, too.  And trich is such that you can easily undo weeks of work in one day - especially me, because ""new growth"" hairs are often particularly appealing to me to pull.  I suppose there are ways to hold yourself, ""compassionately accountable.""  Like, instead of saying to yourself, ""I screwed up by eating crap food"" you would say, ""the food choices I made didn't serve my goals well, so what can I do to set myself up for success in the future?""  I just have a hard time with getting in that compassionate mental state."
Trichsters,1owy53,snailtaxi,2,Mon Oct 21 20:30:21 2013 UTC,"Thank you for your answer.  It's such a challenging balance to strike, isn't it?  I'm not really mad at myself, per se, but I am dissapointed that I undid so much hard work."
Trichsters,1owy53,pantherwest,2,Mon Oct 21 21:28:21 2013 UTC,"Yeah - from your other responses, I think we might be similar.  I've also fundamentally accepted my pulling and have also been pulling for about 20 years.  I don't have any goals of being ""pull free"", but at the same time it is so frustrating to pull a lot in one session.  My worst sessions follow a pattern where I actually won't even notice I am pulling until I have done significant damage, and then once I notice, an ""f*** this"" mentality sets in and I just keep going."
Trichsters,1owy53,pantherwest,3,Mon Oct 21 21:45:54 2013 UTC,"It sounds like you're being awfully hard on yourself, and stressing out rarely makes not pulling easier.  You say that if you don't hold yourself accountable, you don't progress, but why the need for such self-blame?  I think trich is more biological than psychological - it's like being really angry at yourself for having brown eyes instead of blue ones.  I think maybe working to accept the situation and thinking of tactics that help you be less harmful would be better than thinking of it like an addiction, which the words you use imply you are (""accountable,"" ""weak position"" and ""shame spiral"").  I can give you examples of my trich - one of my trouble areas are my eyebrows.  If I go after them with my fingers, half of one can be gone before I know it.  So if I catch myself wanting to pull, I go to the bathroom and look in the mirror.  Sometimes another hair is caught on my eyebrow (one from my head that's gotten out of place, or a bit of cat hair from having pet the cat and then touched my face) and if I brush it away, that ""tickle"" of wanting to pull goes away.  Other times, I use tweezers and just get ""the bad hair(s)"" rather than indiscriminately yanking out clumps with my fingertips.  I find that looking in a mirror really helps slow me down, because of that visual of what you are doing to yourself.  You can always stash a small one in your handbag or desk drawer if you find yourself pulling more away from home.  I have always pulled for as long as I can remember, whether it was skin or hair - and I know I am always going to want to pull.  I don't try not to so much as I figure out the best ways for me to manage it, and over the years, it's worked into various techniques that I definitely do myself less harm, pull a lot less overall and have a lot fewer instances of huge patches being yanked out.  I believe in management over cessation, basically - I think it's more realistic.  I'm sorry you had a bad pulling session.  We've all had them and know the disappointment of a spot that we'd finally gotten to fill in being bald.  AGAIN.  And the worry that this time it won't grow back (it will).  You know you went weeks and weeks before, and that's great.  You start over and try to to it again, tell yourself that it will get better again, and that's all there is to it.  And you know what?  It's October.  Rock a cool hat or a scarf over where you pulled in the name of autumnal fashion, and have an awesome time on your date."
Trichsters,1owuo2,flagellum94,4,Mon Oct 21 16:58:27 2013 UTC,"Canadian here- I guess my fist question is, what kind of medical coverage do you have?  I ask because I go to my psychologist for monthly session, but be aware that most plans are very limited in their coverage.  I don't think you necessarily need a referral for a diagnosis - talk to your GP.  I'd approach them very matter of factly.  A simple 'Hey Doc, I've been struggling with some compulsive behavior for a couple years now and when I looked into it, it appears to be trich.'  They should ask you a number of questions to qualify the OCD, and will either refer you to a psychologist, or try some SSRI's to see if some medication can help you out.  Good luck my friend!  Remeber- we're here for you if you ever need an ear to bend :)"
Trichsters,1owuo2,clothes_girl,3,Mon Oct 21 17:55:22 2013 UTC,"You're in good company here.  I don't really have any tips about getting a doctor's word to set everything right (the last one I talked to hadn't heard of it), but there's a lot of support here.  I think it's hard for people who don't have it to understand - even if you explain, you'll still get some ""but why don't you just stop"" replies, and it's more important that you're at ease with it (stress doesn't help) and that you find things that are helpful for you, rather than worrying about what other people think.    I had a friend at work who I could ask ""hey, if you see me starting to go for my eyebrow, can you just point it out to me?""  And if I did, she would just say ""hey"" and kind of gesture to it or ""do you know you're pulling?"" - depending on the situation, she might get a sigh and ""yes, I know"" or a ""thank you.""  So even if they don't get why you do it, a good friend can still support you if you ask them to."
Trichsters,1owuo2,pantherwest,2,Mon Oct 21 21:34:13 2013 UTC,"It sounds to me like you have a great deal of self-awareness about derma-t and trich. When I started going to a counselor, I walked right in and self-diagnosed with trich. The therapist asked me to describe my behavior and agreed, 'Yup, that's trichotillomania.' So, I don't really think that oodles of analysis is required for what we have. Our goal isn't so much identifying the problem because many of us already know what we've got. So far as your family dismissing your assertions, they are simply not well-educated on either of the conditions. You can absolutely have trich if you are pulling from other areas than your head. Could you use an alcolholism analogy to help them understand? What I mean is that it's pretty rare that an alcoholic is diagnosed as such by a trained professional, much less a psychiatrist. Many of them know exactly what their problem is once they are prepared to confront it and they don't wait around for official diagnosis in order to get treatment. I'll finish where I started: you are very self-aware about what you're dealing with and it is having a profound impact on your quality of life. You have identified the need for treatment and a trained professional can help not only you, but those close to you to understand the full scope of your problem(s). Continue to advocate for yourself until your family hears you. Best of luck, friend!"
Trichsters,1otjy4,steelcitykid,3,Sun Oct 20 05:03:58 2013 UTC,"I'll tell you the same thing I tell everyone else: self confidence is just that; confidence you give yourself. If your confidence comes from someone else's approval of what you look like, how you handle anxiety and/or stress, then it's not truly self confidence.  You're a human being deserving of love and respect the same as everyone else. Our disorder sucks but it's our flaws that make us what we are. We're not robots, we're not perfect, and we're not supposed to be. Anyone that would look down on you for your trich is really making a much more powerful statement about them-self than you.  Are you seeking a therapist or pysch for treatment? Have you tried medicine? I'm currently seeing a therapist as well as a psych, and reading a book on cognitive behavioral therapy that I hope to give my opinion on in the short term future. Take care!

Trichsters,1oq8bm,pantherwest,8,Fri Oct 18 17:58:57 2013 UTC,"My brain works the same way - I pulled at cuticles for years and then moved to hair - eyebrows and eyelashes are my main vice.  I know some people here aren't fans of allowing yourself tweezer access, but it really helps me to use them.  I'd rather pull out just the hair(s) that I find objectionable and be done - I find that if I use my fingers, that's when I do heaps of damage and find myself missing half an eyebrow.  If I catch myself starting to pull, I get up and go to the mirror to make myself look at what's going on and that way even if I do need to take a couple swipes, I find it helps me be more controlled.  I also find that when things are grown back to a normal state (and I empathize with how hard a place this can be to get to, especially when you feel like the regrowth is itching and you want to stop it by pulling it back out) that putting mascara on really does help discourage me from pulling. I think some of this is vanity, but also the feel of the mascara is different from the lash and reminds me not to pull.  Good luck. It's a process, but this subreddit is really supportive."

Trichsters,1om17k,Excalib,13,Thu Oct 17 00:45:05 2013 UTC,"Is there any way you can find someone to help advocate for you? Perhaps a counselor or relative or even a friend's Mom or Dad?   I understand that they may feel that you're too young for make-up in its typical form, but in your case you'd be using it more like in the sense of a prosthesis. If you had a breast removed I'm sure they'd be okay with you wearing a prosthesis even though you may not be sexually active or 'need' them per se. Same with make-up to cover up a large scar or birthmark. No, of course it's not always completely necessary, but it makes the individual feel better and feel better about themselves. With trich especially it's important to avoid shame spirals.  I'm wondering if part of it is also that they may be worrying that you'd use it as a crutch/cover-up and still continue to pull. Are you undergoing any kind of treatment for your trich? Can you assure them that you fully intend to continue with whatever preventative measures or treatment you are doing?  Would they perhaps even allow you to wear false eyelashes? That would literally be prosthesis. High quality ones can even be very natural looking. The danger in them is that any misses or activity along your lash line can cause damage and inhibit growth. I would personally see make-up as a very acceptable alternative.  As well, I'm not sure of your hair color but there are a lot of very light or neutral eyeliners that aren't anywhere near as noticeable or gaudy as some of the brighter/darker colors. A 'blonde' pencil provides neutral color similar to most mid-ranged natural hair colors. Could you perhaps assure them that you will be going for nothing but a natural look and have no intentions of looking 'made-up'?"

But that's off topic. I think they just want me to stop. I think that wearing false eyelashes would help, because then I couldn't just reach up and just pull out my eyelashes.   I think they think I want to wear it just because. I want to explain it to them but I don't think they like talking about my trich.

Perhaps you have some anxiety over life after highschool? Maybe choosing a college or a career is worrisome. Maybe it's Prom. I remember how anxious I was as a senior, and these were my worries and fears.  As far as the damage you've done, try to keep your hands occupied some other way.

If you're going to actually shave it, that is, with a razor, go really slow and don't shave against the grain to start.

Trichsters,1oh7z1,Bodobleep,1 point,Wed Oct 16 01:49:39 2013 UTC,"Interesting. When I pulled as a kid I would twist the hair into a small knot first, then yank the knot removing anywhere from 5-15 hairs I would estimate. As I got older, I became much more of a texture hunting puller and would seek out the ones that felt thicker and wiry-er. To pluck these ones I would just repetitively twirl that lone hair over and over until it felt even more right, and when I yank it, I almost always get the thick bulb with the dark root attached.  I always assumed that was the entire 'hair' and that it would take longer to grow back as there was nothing to start from. Is it possible that you have some form of folliculitis or similar? I've never bled to my knowledge. I do enjoy using tweezers now to grab just the white ones. I will have no grey or silver hairs, I'm going from medium brown to white overnight it seems, heh.

I'm sure it's different for everyone, but it's inevitable that pulling out your hair is going to damage them.  I'd suggest that shaving your head allows the hair to grow back evenly, but patches that have been pulled will take longer to grow.  I did not find that wearing wigs impeded growth, but rather increased it because of the heat generated by the wig (sweaty, uncomfortable things!).  I've also applied essential oils to my head to help protect the skin, and that has helped reduce irritation from pulling."
Trichsters,1oh7z1,KellynHeller,1 point,Tue Oct 15 20:07:09 2013 UTC,"This is excellent information, especially about applying essential oils. I just read a life-hack today that said rubbing aloe vera on your head will speed up hair growth. I wonder if there's anything to that. Thank you!"
Trichsters,1ofnh5,user25261,3,Mon Oct 14 16:37:05 2013 UTC,"What i like to do after my day is done, and i dont haveto leave the house, i like to spread some vaseline on my eyebrows, it helps a bit, it mostly stops me from pulling, cuz i go up there to pull, and then my finger gets all oily and what not, reminding me not to pull.  Plus ive read(i dont remember where) that it helps them grow back."
Trichsters,1ofnh5,Yesthatstheone420,2,Mon Oct 14 18:03:04 2013 UTC,"Product in your hair to make you aware of the pulling via the textural change. Cotton gloves to take away your grip, or tape over the fingertips.   If you eat them then keep bubblegum handy."

Trichsters,1o5lbr,Dalisca,5,Thu Oct 10 16:49:13 2013 UTC,"Are you using this already, or are you hoping it will work?  I'm asking because temporary tattoos often have an unnatural flat reflectiveness to them.  They might not stick well or could flake off in a weird way unless your brows are completely hairless.  Also, if they do work I would suggest still using a bit of shade (tan eyeshadow) over them.  One issue I've seen with real eyebrow tattoos is that they're too often monochromatic, while human hair has varying colors and opacities.  Because of this the tattooed versions have too much contrast between where the hairs are drawn on and the skin between the hair lines.  I'm subscribed to this subred as a derm (not a trich), but I'm assuming that the point is to disguise the habit and not draw attention.  Tattooed brows (fake tattoos or real) can have the opposite effect unless you're using a high-end artist who really knows what they're doing to get the job done.  In other words, someone looking at you with these things on might interpret them the same as one would the old trend of the Sharpie brow.  You might wind up drawing more attention than you would by going as your natural self.  Seriously, you might have better luck getting a few (read -- no less than 3 per brow) stencils made and a cheap airbrush with some diluted inks.  Then, layer them with slightly different shades to keep them from looking drawn on."
Trichsters,1o5lbr,She_Spock,2,Thu Oct 10 18:08:38 2013 UTC,"I am using them now, after doing brow stencils for quite a while. I found they work pretty well, and don't look too ""fake.""

Trichsters,1o6aw2,Nickilette,1 point,Sun Oct 13 00:21:30 2013 UTC,"My situation is extremely similar to yours, and I can honestly say that after everything that I've done, I have a decent set of eyebrows. I can't guarantee this will work for you, because hair growth and types are different for everyone, but I really recommend trying this anyways.  Been plucking since I was 12. It started out slow, but by the time I was 15 I had no brows. This lasted two and a half years, because I stopped a few months before I turned 18. I penciled them in every single day, same old story. I made a long post about how I stopped and everything, but to make your life easier I'll just tell you what I did.  First off, be aware. I know it can sometimes be a completely zoning-out thing, but you have to believe in yourself. Don't hate yourself if you accidentally slip up now and then, because it's a long process in which baby steps are required.  Second, clear up those pores. I was so ashamed of my brows that I didn't even remove the makeup before showering. I grew so accustomed to my face with penciled eyebrows, that I forgot what I really looked like. The night that I finally removed my makeup after keeping it on for years was the biggest emotional hit for me. But, as a constant reminder, I made it a routine. I removed my brow makeup every single day and exfoliated. You can do this by just getting an EXTRA SOFT toothbrush, and just putting some pore cleanser soap on there and GENTLY scrub your brows before you go to bed. This gives them the time to breathe and heal, and the blood that goes to them from the gentle scrubbing can stimulate hair growth as well.  Third, wait. I never used hair enhancers like rogaine, latisse, or castor oil. I've heard reviews from them like eye color change, hair growth in unwanted places, and even hair falling out that scared me away from anything unnatural. I'm not saying they don't work, but I just personally didn't want to take the risk. Waiting for brows to grow back can be EXCRUCIATING, especially since you have that constant ""I have to pencil in my brows"" reminder every morning. But they WILL get better.   Fourth, try to use more natural brow products to boost your confidence. Because I didn't have brows, it was easy for me to overcompensate for that by drawing them on with the darkest brown pencil. Try and get used to your face by gradually going lighter up in shades. First do pencils, but I would really recommend powder. It does look the most natural, and it doesn't take as long to apply in the morning!  And finally, to conclude these steps, the fifth is a disclaimer. My eyebrows never grew back to the bushy level they were when I was a child. They are indeed more sparse than normal, but don't give up. I've been regrowing my brows since the beginning of this summer, and they do get new hairs gradually. Just give them time and some good ol' TLC.  TL;DR: Exfoliate."
Trichsters,1o6aw2,Nickilette,1 point,Sun Oct 13 00:52:32 2013 UTC,"I have to admit, I do the same thing. I'm so ashamed of my brows I NEVER take off the makeup. The few times I have I've cried and it was not pretty. But I will try what you've suggested. It's going to be rough. :/ But I do want my eyebrows back. It's a struggle because it isn't just the hair it's the emotional baggage-crap along with it."
Trichsters,1o6aw2,KellynHeller,1 point,Mon Oct 14 03:01:58 2013 UTC,"Oh my goodness, I know every single one of those feelings trapped inside of you. Please trust me, even though it's going to hurt. The first time I took mine off, the emotional damage had me so, so devastated. I just stared in the mirror and cried for hours. I couldn't get over the idea that what I was looking at was my face...  The emotional baggage will fade with the familiarity of your actual face, new eyebrow hairs, and growing confidence in the solidifying of your routine. It's gotten to the point where I feel comfortable enough to go out without bangs covering my forehead anymore, the most liberated I've felt in a long time. I wish you the best of luck."

God that pain felt so good, the next few days were hell though.  I eventually sought out a podiatrist and have them removed so I couldn't do it anymore. It was the smart thing to do for me.

Trichsters,1nunxl,JellyBeanKruger,2,Sun Oct 6 17:28:11 2013 UTC,"They look great!  When I was around 11 or so, I too started with my eyebrows... I would tweeze obsessively to where all I had were thin lines left. I have always pulled a little from my head, but once I let my eyebrows alone I completely destroyed the hair on my head and had massive bald spots that I had to like comb over. That was when I had moved out of my parents' house into my and my boyfriend's first apartment and stated working retail full time, living on ramen and gained a ton of weight...  I totally empathize with you, am very happy you are doing better, and thanks for sharing your picture and story!  You are a lovely lady!"
Trichsters,1nunxl,JellyBeanKruger,1 point,Sun Oct 6 20:53:57 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words!   That sounds really similar to my story. Once I stopped with the lashes I went full hog on my hair. Thank god I have always had very thick hair. And it seems to grow back thicker and more course than before. Now its so hard to resist pulling the short, course hairs. They are so satisfying. If I could just let them grow past 5 or 6 inches I would be golden. Just being patient and trying not to pull for that long is killer.  When I look back at my life chronologically, Trichotillomania has had a really big negative impact on my life and self esteem. I just want to see others out there overcome this, or at least reach a point that they feel is manageable."
Trichsters,1nunxl,steelcitykid,2,Sun Oct 6 22:08:01 2013 UTC,"The course hair growing in is exactly what happens to me too. They're like crinkly and annoying. If I run my fingers along my scalp, it is nearly impossible to leave those things there.... It's such a vicious cycle :/"

Not everyone is supportive or helpful, but never met anyone that blatantly rude.   I'm sorry, but if he's not understanding of your trich, much less supportive of helping you, he shouldn't get to stay."
Trichsters,1ntypy,Texanjumper,9,Sun Oct 6 10:05:45 2013 UTC,This was my thought; the guy sounds pretty rude.  This is the most troubling part of OP's post:   I don't want my own lack of self control to be the reason this relationship ends   Your S.O. is supposed to be supportive and encourage you to better yourself if you're going through trouble -- not cast you aside. THAT is what will ruin a relationship.
Trichsters,1ntypy,MJMohan,3,Sun Oct 6 10:24:48 2013 UTC,"Great comment. OP, I think if he wants to know what he can do, tell him not to leave or get distant just because he's bothered, because that hurts you and stress/anxiety/guilt might even trigger the habit more. Suggest that he can distract you from the action. Interrupt with a tickle or a well-humored pinch, and/or help you find something else to busy your hands with. Gotta work on it together!"

I thought it'd be something like medusa, your hair turning into snakes at night or something"".   I just wanted to tell you this so you know that the reaction your BF had isn't representative and that you may be having a problem but he's the one making it his problem.  About him asking what he can do.. Whenever me and my SO is in the couch, cuddling and my hand start gravitating to my scalp and he notices, he grabs my hand and holds it. Not a word said. No stern looks. Just holds my hand as if the timing was completely coincidental. It feels like a act of love and care, not because he's repulsed. I sometimes get a little frustrated (being stopped in my track, so to speak), but I don't want to pull either so its all good, the frustration passes quickly."

By posting this it sounds like you're already pretty upset/anxious about his place in all this and that's only going to make it worse..  Having trich is kind of just like having any other addiction. You can't have the major people in your support system making you feel bad about trich. If he is repulsed by it, he may not be the best person for you. There are many great guys out there that will not only accept you for you but be there for you while you're trying to beat this. You know that grossly overused quote, ""if you're not there for me at my worst, don't expect to be here at my best""? well in this case it actually applies because you're not only this disease.  And that's what he is only seeing is this disease.   I mean, it's his own decision to be the partner of someone with ANY kind of problem. Whether it's trich or cigarettes or schizophrenia or what have you. If he doesn't want to be there for you, you should let him go because that's the last thing you need in terms of getting better.

Trichsters,1ntypy,idiosyncrassy,2,Sun Oct 6 16:57:53 2013 UTC,"The best thing that ever happened to me, trichtotillomania-wise, was being open and honest about it, especially to my husband, who doesn't give two flips that I pull my hair out (I'm a trichophage too, he doesn't care.) He even thinks it's cute. Er, ok. Whatever floats his boat. But this opened up my home as a safe place to pull, opened up the possibility that my friends wouldn't care either, opening up prettymuch every social opportunity as a safe place to pull. Not having to hoard of pulling desire for later made it easier to pull much less.  I have been doing this since infancy, so it isn't very reasonable to assume that I am going to stop completely and forever ... ever. As long as I limit the habit enough to not hurt myself, I think it's ok.  It's unreasonable for him to assume that the doctor can prescribe you a pill and immediately cure you. Surely, you would have pursued that avenue already if it were possible. We all would have.  The only way I could pardon him is if there is some underlying reason why he just can't watch. Is he otherwise squeamish? Is it something he could get over? Obviously you can't find this stuff out unless he consents to actually TALK about it.  Bottom line, you aren't hurting him by having under-control trich. He is hurting you with his response to it. That's not ok."

Anyway- It sucks that he's putting his aversion all on you, though. It's not like he's perfect and you're the only weirdo. You could both be taking pills for that, but geez Louise - if you compulsively pull, and he as a compulsive aversion to hand gestures related to pulling...not sure that's gonna really work out for you two, especially if his favorite solution is making you feel like shit about yourself. That won't help a thing.  I suggest you look for alternative housing. I honestly don't think it'd be healthy to move in with the one person who has a specific aversion to your compulsive behavior."

Your SO should be the person that you feel most comfortable with other than yourself, and they should support you through any and all troubles you may have along the way.  If you are having doubts about moving in together, you should probably listen to them. Living alone together will mean a lot of one-on-one hang out time, which will inevitably mean some pulling time. It will be a heck of a lot easier to get out now than later when you realize you can't handle his scrutiny anymore.   I hate to sound morbid, but I think it is really important that you take care of yourself and feel comfortable IN YOUR OWN HOME. Do whatever it takes to feel happy, even if that means feeling sad for a little while. You are young and college is a great place to surround yourself with people and activities, so now is a great time to do what is best for you.

Trichsters,1nns0s,She_Spock,1 point,Thu Oct 3 20:34:52 2013 UTC,I would love to hear your review after you try it.
Trichsters,1nns0s,lauraisbored,1 point,Mon Oct 7 01:07:54 2013 UTC,"So I bought it and I've been using it for a few days, and it's pretty good. It won't magically give you brows if you don't have any, but it enhances what's already there if the hairs are really fine or sparse. Best result was with two coats. It's very much like a volumizing mascara for eyebrows."

Trichsters,1nn7l7,mec05160,5,Thu Oct 3 09:36:02 2013 UTC,"I pull out my eyebrows so you can probably imagine they're a mess most of the time due to being thicker and bushier than most and sometimes I forget to put my eyebrow pencil on when I go outside...  You know, most people don't even notice or care. If they do say something and you mention having a disorder they kinda tend to shy away from it(unless they're mega assholes)...  If you want to quit its a long hard road, but it can be done, this sub is AWESOME for support(give yourselves a hand)...  But just know you have friends here, people who understand, people who know exactly what you're feeling...you'll be ok, just don't give up..."
Trichsters,1nn7l7,steelcitykid,2,Thu Oct 3 13:32:20 2013 UTC,I totally agree...most people don't notice that it's happening or that you are even missing hair or if they do most people are decent enough to not say anything.  Everyone has a battle they are fighting...ours is just more noticeable than others.
Trichsters,1nn7l7,clothes_girl,3,Thu Oct 3 16:00:22 2013 UTC,"Right there with you. About 3 weeks ago I had a full head of hair. Fairly certain that most of my office has noticed that something us up, I didn't just spontaneously gain a bald spot in that time frame. Sucks but all I can do is try to stay mindful.  My psychiatrist recommended the book The Feeling Good Handbook and it's being delivered today. He mentioned this when I asked about cognitive behavior therapy as any and all medicinal routes I have undergone have proven ineffective for me.  If you'd like, I can update you as to my thoughts after having read it.   Take care and don't beat yourself up. You're a human being deserving of love, respect, and happiness.

Trichsters,1nf0s4,raviax,1 point,Mon Sep 30 03:26:38 2013 UTC,I just picked the cheapest one I could find and took the proper dosage recommended for people with trich. The proper name for it is N-acetylcystine! I've heard a lot of good stories about NAC but personally it didn't do much for me.. Best of luck to you!!
Trichsters,1nf0s4,dayleymaze,1 point,Mon Sep 30 04:03:24 2013 UTC,"GNC brand reeks. They either have a crappy odor absorber, or none at all.   I use twin pines because I can get it at Giant (in the organic aisle). It's a lot more expensive online though. No odor.   I would suggest getting several small bottles instead of a large one. I can tell it's not as effective when I'm reaching the end of the bottle. I think it has something to do with oxidation, but don't quote me."
Trichsters,1nf0s4,fingerpies,1 point,Mon Sep 30 10:01:42 2013 UTC,We personally use Swanson Pharmaceutical grade NAC for all of our studies. You can buy it right through them or on Amazon. Please let me know if you have further questions about NAC as we have run a few studies on it!
Trichsters,1nf0s4,Thinkingformyself,2,Mon Sep 30 16:10:26 2013 UTC,"I have sone questions.  What dose do you use?  Is there a dose-dependent effect, ie a greater effect with increasing dose? Is there any benefit to stopping therapy and them restarting at certain intervals?  Is there a risk of vitamin/ mineral depletion while taking NAC? Does a multivitamin prevent that? Finally, is it synergistic with inositol? Thank you in advance"
Trichsters,1nf0s4,Thinkingformyself,2,Mon Sep 30 17:05:33 2013 UTC,"Here is a fantastic article on the use of NAC, I really recommend reading it:  http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=483113  Literature has found that 1200 mg-2400 mg to be effective (you take half the dose in the morning and half in the evening), with a period of 2 weeks or so between ""bump ups"". The article goes into more depth about this. It's not necessarily getting a greater effect, for some people it is and for some people they just hit that magic dose and everything sort of happens at once.   There is no benefit of stopping at any time. It passes through your system pretty quickly, so it needs to be continuous. Also, I am not aware of any vitamin or mineral depletion with NAC, at least in recent research. We have never combined inositol and NAC together, as they are similar and I don't really think they would boost each other in any way. I would recommend those as separate treatment options, at least from what we know right now."
Trichsters,1nf0s4,RejectKid89,1 point,Tue Oct 1 00:14:56 2013 UTC,Thank you so very much. I will peruse the article now. Thank you for your research efforts in this important area if unmet medical need.
Trichsters,1nekha,tessh6,1 point,Sun Sep 29 23:29:16 2013 UTC,"You could talk to your professors and let them know about your trich, and ask if you can have more time to take a test or do an assignment. If they don't let you, go to your campus health center or disability center (not that it's a disability per se, but it might fall into that category if it's hindering you academically)."
Trichsters,1nekha,kdoh25,1 point,Mon Sep 30 00:52:54 2013 UTC,"I haven't let any professor know about it since middle school, but I would give it a shot. It seems so silly to feel like I need more time, due to being easily distracted by the urge to pull out my own hair. But unfortunately its true. But I have considered talking to the disabilities center.  I have been to the university counseling to try and see if they could help - I only really got more aware/treated for my anxiety, and very little help (other than stop smoking -rubber band on your wrist- type habit breakers) was given for the trich specifically."
Trichsters,1nekha,cinemachick,1 point,Mon Sep 30 06:18:31 2013 UTC,"I have only been sucessful in re-directing my attention to doing something with my hands with another OCD habit. If Im not pulling my hair, Im focusing on my hands by picking my cuticles or biting my nails! I swear if its not one thing its the other lol. Id rather have bloody fingers than thin spots, but I suppose its still self destructive and not really that good looking.   I will try and think of something else to do though. I have seen someone say they make friendship bracelets, and I am a fan of macrame. So maybe I will keep something pinned to my backpack."
Trichsters,1nekha,ashrevolts,2,Mon Sep 30 02:32:19 2013 UTC,"Have you ever tried origami? I've started folding cranes during my classes. I've memorized the pattern, so I can fold them mindlessly while listening to lectures. Plus, I get to take them home or give them away afterward. (I'm going to give a jar of them to each of my professors. :3) If you aren't familiar with origami, you might want to start with a simpler fold such as a Crown or a Lotus Blossom that's easy to memorize & fold. Best of luck with your studies!"
Trichsters,1nekha,soinuit,1 point,Mon Sep 30 06:13:29 2013 UTC,"Not sure if this would be helpful, but can you maybe get permission to wear a hat?

Trichsters,1nekha,Aingeala,1 point,Mon Sep 30 21:39:52 2013 UTC,Putting my hair in a top bun or wearing a hat gets me through studying and lectures. Also coffee.

Again today I'll swear I'll never pull another hair again (for the 100th time or whatever). She'll definitley notice this, what do I say? I can't blame it on the extensions no more. Cos it's fucking bald, not short as if extensions wore it away/snapped it or whatever.  BTW; anyone else seek out new growth? I 'love' getting tiny short hairs out. :( sick of this."
Trichsters,1ncbh5,projectemily,5,Sat Sep 28 23:47:20 2013 UTC,"Honestly I would just tell her the truth. A lot of hair professionals have either seen it in their other clients or have learn about it and don't judge you for it. Personally I think it helps having your hair person know about it and any high-pull areas because then they can maybe work with you to find hair styles that work best at hiding these areas. Either way, someone who works with hair every single day should be able to address the problem professionally, you just have to be honest with them. And I know I know. Easier said than done, I used to be mortified about getting my hair cut when I was younger because of my bald patches, but after I told him and he talked with me about it, it became much easier to deal with."
Trichsters,1ncbh5,bonnster,1 point,Sun Sep 29 01:35:42 2013 UTC,I completely agree with you. I've been seeing the same hairdresser for 8 years and we've become very good friends. It was only last year that I confided in her about my trich. She was very kind and understanding and didn't make me feel like a complete weirdo for it.   Don't be afraid to talk to those close to you about it. It's nice to have someone to talk to if you've been pulling a lot.
Trichsters,1ncbh5,MirLae,1 point,Wed Oct 23 17:14:06 2013 UTC,"I do the exact same as you, I love pulling out my short hairs, I also pull out my hair exactly where you do too. I'm glad I can cover it somewhat, but I hate how thin and flat it makes my hair."
Trichsters,1ncbh5,skamnorth,1 point,Sun Sep 29 01:16:43 2013 UTC,"If you feel up for it, tell them. Theyve probably seen it before. Get a hairdresser you can trust with the issue so you wont have to explain every time you go in.  My hairdresser is awesome. I get extra scalp massages because it promotes hair growth.  If you dont feel up to talking about it yet, I understand. I have told people it is alopecia before (autoimmune hairloss illness, common) which quite fit with the spots. Ive never had anyone question it. I dont like lying but we all know the feeling of shame that comes with this illness and alopecia isn't something you csn control at all, so I used to like that excuse."
Trichsters,1ncbh5,Discordant_Concord,2,Sun Sep 29 02:41:59 2013 UTC,"Tell your stylist. I guarantee they have seen it (or at least heard of it) before, and a good stylist can teach you ways to style your hair so that it won't show. And yes, I absolutely go after new growth. Pokey loners are the most fun to hunt down."
Trichsters,1ncbh5,mcc661,1 point,Sun Sep 29 03:03:28 2013 UTC,"Even within this community, that's a problem I've never really faced. Being a guy, and rarely going to a barber (and never a stylist), the worst I've really faced there is having to shave it all off again to make it even. Then keep shaving it weekly (at least) until it grows in more evenly.  To me, something like this would be a nightmare. I shave my head myself to avoid other people ever seeing what it looks like. Having to submit to another person looking over my head with any sort of attention to detail frightens me. I don't like attention for the most part as it is.  I have to agree with what's already been said, you might have to tell them. I know that's far easier said than done, and I'm not sure I could, but it does seem to be the best option. The only barber I ever actually told that knew (my mother told him) was able to do kind of a fade effect for my hair, hiding the damage for a little longer. As short as I keep it, this wasn't easy for him.  And I definitely agree on the new hairs. Not so much on my scalp, but other places tend to take longer to regrow because of this.  Edited to correct a faulty memory."

Trichsters,1n6jjn,helix19,2,Thu Sep 26 15:27:28 2013 UTC,"Two things- Compulsive skin picking is classified in the DSM-V under the name Excoriation Disorder. I have been on literally just about every psych medication available. The only medication that has made a difference in my picking is Topamax, which is an anticonvulsant. I still pick, but the urges are markedly less."
Trichsters,1n6jjn,PredictableChick,2,Thu Sep 26 23:58:58 2013 UTC,"You are correct, Excoriation Disorder is now the newest name via the DSM-V release in May. I have heard that Topamax works for some folks, I'm glad to hear it has reduced your urges! Hopefully it reduces the thoughts about picking as well for you."
Trichsters,1n6jjn,germily,1 point,Fri Sep 27 13:20:58 2013 UTC,I can't find any data on NAC use in nursing mothers - are there any studies in the works for this?   Are there any substances similar to NAC whose excretion into human milk is known that I can look into?
Trichsters,1n6jjn,helix19,1 point,Thu Sep 26 17:30:12 2013 UTC,"We generally say to not take NAC while pregnant or lactating for that reason: we don't know what the long term effects are. I am not aware of any studies currently running for NAC and women who are nursing off hand.   There are a couple other products that are similar to NAC, but they all come with the warning not to take them while nursing.   I think this is probably not what you want to hear, but it's generally better to just wait until you are done nursing to try NAC or anything similar since we really don't know what sort of effects it will have on your baby."
Trichsters,1n6jjn,iristhevirus,1 point,Thu Sep 26 18:12:39 2013 UTC,"My psychiatrist prescribed me seroquel for my trich, but I refuse to take it since one of the most common side effects is weight gain..."
Trichsters,1n6jjn,imtallerthanyou,1 point,Thu Sep 26 19:15:57 2013 UTC,"I started taking Topamax to treat my depression and anxiety. It's an anticonvulsant, but my psychiatrist thought it might have some mood altering benefits, and I have not responded to traditional antidepressants for my mood disorders or skin picking. To my surprise, Topamax has noticeably decreased my urge to pick. It causes weight loss as well."
Trichsters,1n6jjn,mec05160,1 point,Fri Sep 27 00:02:34 2013 UTC,"Seroquel greatly, and I mean GREATLY helped me. Not all people gain weight and you can tailor your doses so they stay small.   I still pull, but I'm a very functional trichster and now have shoulder length hair for the first time in nearly 20 years (and I'm 30). Pull 'comas' just don't happen for me anymore. Seroquel's an antipsychotic so it really helps with the dissociative states where mass pulling occurs.  I take it for other reasons and just noticed its effects on my trich as a huge benefit. For me, it helps take care of a lot of the underlying psychological issues that contribute to my pulling.  I have not noticed any weight gain, but for me I'd take a few extra pounds over being bald any day."
Trichsters,1n5msn,kiitten,3,Thu Sep 26 04:18:02 2013 UTC,"It really is an subconscious action. A person that picks or pulls hardly even notices it.  What he needs to do is figure out his so called subconscious areas. Such as driving, sitting on the couch, so on and so forth. Once he does that he can try and focus on not touching his face.  This is just my advice of course.  It is something he will need to improve on, and your support could help in that matter. I talked to my friends and gave them the okay to let me know when I  am pulling and it can be embarrassing then. So think about that next time you tell him to stop and bring it up to him. It's embarrassing for you, but even more so for him.  His stress is something he will have to work out. Just like the rest of us. And when I say let him know, don't yell his name, don't grab his hand, just use whatever name you call him at a normal level to get his attention. Nothing pisses me off more when people yell at me about it. That will wake him from that subconscious state and he should stop   TL;DR it's subconscious. Talk to him about it. It will always be a thing in some way or another. Accept it or get over it."

Trichsters,1n230p,Excalib,3,Tue Sep 24 21:35:46 2013 UTC,"You're having an adverse reaction to the stress building up inside of you. That's why the negative, judgemental thoughts are bubbling to the surface- your inner 'happy-go-lucky' self is being stomped on by your 'dread and anger' self. You need a healthy way to let the stress out- and it appears the letter-writing is too emotionally-wraught to use as a means for relief. Does your school have a counselor you feel comfortable speaking to? Or, would you be interested in having an introductory meeting with a therapist? You can also mention your concerns to your doctor/pediatrician, who may have suggestions on places in your area to seek help.    One thing to focus on in the meantime is reducing your reaction to stress. For me, it's easy to let my stress ramp up how I feel about an unsolved problem. My mind races, my heart beats faster, I get an overwhelming sense of gloom and doom- and none of that's healthy for long periods of time/at high frequencies. When you're in the moment and bad things are happening, try mentally rating the seriousness of what's going on. Pick a number from 0 to 10- zero being something insignificant like a leaf falling off a plant, 10 being a horrible thing happening to the person you love most (or something of that nature- make it personal only if that sits well with you).    After you've given it a rating, consider your mental/emotional/physical response to your situation. Does your reaction make sense with your situation? Are you reacting at a 7 when your surroundings are more like a 3? Could you work your way down to a 5, even for just a little while? Do you need to take a break and calm down, or can you work in the moment? Once you've given yourself a mental check-in, find ways to relax. Take deep, slow breaths. Repeat a mantra or count in your mind. Focus on something or someone positive. Let the tension out of your muscles. Then (and only then!) reframe your thoughts toward finding a solution, rather than churning in the problem. This gets you away from spinning your wheels mentally, and aims you toward finding a resolution for your stress. It's not always easy, but it's a start.    I'm not sure if that advice is applicable, but I hope it helps. Please feel to PM me if you ever need someone to talk with. hug I hope you feel better soon."
Trichsters,1n230p,cinemachick,3,Tue Sep 24 22:35:30 2013 UTC,"Hey there,  High school is a difficult time in a lot of young people's lives for a number of reasons. Oddly enough, my trich was almost gone during highschool which is usually stressful for lots of people. It was far worse for me in grades 5-8, and then again in college and into today. You're not alone though, lots of people have problems with anxiety, panic attacks, stress, and of course trich!  It's unfortunate that your parents are being dismissive of your trich. How have you approached them in the past? Perhaps you could point them to some resources in a plainly worded email asking for help. Maybe a link to the wikipedia on trich, some NIHM resources and things of that nature. Tell them that you're bothered by your behavior and have problems with impulse control and that you'd like to seek treatment for it. If they unable or unwilling to help in this matter, I would recommend talking to a school counselor about your problems, and feel free to talk about other issues too. Please be aware that because you're not an adult, anything you tell the counselor may make its way back to your parents.   Take care!"
Trichsters,1n230p,steelcitykid,1 point,Wed Sep 25 13:09:47 2013 UTC,"Well to be honest, my parents think I've stopped. I don't think they actually look close enough to notice what I've pulled and what I haven't. If they have, they never said anything. My parents are kind of hard asses, have very strong opinions, and weren't very pleased with me when they first found out. So it is either nut up or shut up, and I've chosen shut up. When things aren't happening to them they have a hard time understanding why anyone would do what they do. Even if they have information on it. Thanks for the advice. I'll try it and hope all goes well."
Trichsters,1n230p,steelcitykid,1 point,Thu Sep 26 02:28:11 2013 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear they've taken such a selfish approach when it sounds like you are actively trying to get help.  This may sound crazy or even preachy (I hope it doesn't come off that way) but do you exercise regularly? I started lifting weights about 5 years ago and it has done wonders for my stress and anxiety. I've found that for me, a good workout lets me un-focus my mind on all of life's worries and just be present for a little while. It's also been quite a nice boost for my confidence."

Trichsters,1mpaa1,ayanae,7,Thu Sep 19 10:19:45 2013 UTC,"Sure thing!  Essentially I found this subreddit and saw all the crazed NAC.  So I was like what the heck it can't hurt.  Based on the research out there it looks like 1800mg - 2400mg is what we ""trichsters"" need.  So I found the NAC real cheap online at Piping Rock.  As far as when I take it, I just take it at 6am, noon, and 5p.  aka around meal times.  It tends to stay in my system about 4-5hrs.  Now I won't lie to you it's not been 100% cure all.  At one point I estimated a 97% reduction in the ""urge"" but I'd lower that to about 85% probably now after 4 weeks.  For some reason that ""urge"" we have just seems to dissipate for the most part.  Heck I even find myself sometimes just looking at hairs/lashes/brows that I'd normally pluck out and just thinking ""what's the point?""  Which is THEE Best feeling!  I hope this can help you and anyone else on here!"

Trichsters,1mpaa1,Texanjumper,2,Thu Sep 19 13:10:26 2013 UTC,"Ha ha yeah I hear ya.  It definitely smells awful.  I've been taking all natural men's multivitamin and a B-Complex 125 for the last 2.5years so the smell doesn't bother me too much.  My wife though agrees with you, in that it's the worst of the bad smelling pills I take.  I workout each morning and so far no ones ever said anything?  And I can't smell it, so I'm not sure.  I'd rather have a little bad smell and have hair imo, but to each his/her own."
Trichsters,1mpaa1,Lungsquaw,2,Thu Sep 19 13:25:55 2013 UTC,Maybe it was just in my head that it smelled/seeped out of me. I just remember opening the bottle after holding my breath.  Maybe I'll get around to trying it again.

Side note:  smells can seep out of you from sweating (but I doubt it from a small pill of 600mg).  Had a shrimp eating contest in HS (I won...ate 87 pieces of shrimp scampi).  Yep then went to play tennis.  I was a pure garlic sensation!  87 shrimp vs 600mg pill  dont worry it was prolly in your head lol

It takes a bit of getting used to, but the powder method is really nice, and doesn't leave a harsh line like pencils often can.   I know that many use their brow whiz (lightly!) and then the powder over that to mask the harshness of the lines drawn.  You should check out r/makeupaddiction for some products, tips and tutorials.

When they see that this is something significant in your life, I imagine they'll try to be supportive to the best of their abilities. Maybe send them the website. But I would definitely talk to them. Trich isn't something a person can work through on her own. Therapists and psychiatrists know about it and are there to help you! I used to be embarrassed talking about it to doctors but they've seen it all. I'm proud of you for taking steps to overcome this!

As far as prevention, I cut my nails extremely short (to no avail, it seems) and for a while I couldn't turn on my bathroom light. Might have to go back to that! I don't pull from my scalp; my obsession is with leg and pubic hair. But since I'm going through laser hair removal treatments, there isn't hair to pull so instead I dig and dig not for the hair but for the empty follicle itself. Leaves scars. Hurts my fingers. Satisfaction is minimal. Gah!! Sometimes I wish I was just a nail biter like most everyone else."

I know what it's like to get into that manic, yet almost hypnotized, state where you get into the haze of focusing on the hair/ follicle. Have you ever thought about trying acrylic nails? It sucks to have the added expense, especially if you don't prefer the look of fake nails, but it really makes any sort of gripping/ digging feel less satisfying and more difficult to do overall. Otherwise, I would suggest trying to wear stretch leggings for a while so picking takes that extra step to get to (and giving you a chance to stop yourself/ lose interest). Just some ideas! hugs"
Trichsters,1lhefv,BiscuitsMama,1 point,Sun Sep 1 02:31:19 2013 UTC,"I have considered getting acrylic nails. A couple times I got gel manicures when my nails were really long--not only was gripping more difficult and more painful, but I thought I'd be hesitant to pull so as to not mess up my perfect (and pricy!) nails. Nope. I was left with a bajillion nail marks that scabbed over. Woooo. I'm highly considering making myself wear puffy winter gloves all the time. They'll look nice paired with my old lady orthopedic sneakers! Thank you for your hugs; Internet hugs from strangers are oddly comforting! :)"

I hope that as she matures she'll have the ability to control it better and still have all the confidence and self-respect she deserves as a young adult.   My family only semi-shamed me, more joked about it than anything, and I was a quiet kid so I never vocally protested how embarrassed I was or how hurtful it was. We want to feel normal because we are normal, there's nothing wrong with us, we just have this strange behavior we can't really control but we're alienated in school (kids are so damned cruel) as that kid and made to feel less human.  More than anything I wish I had known another kid like me, but I didn't. Are there support groups near you or within a reasonable distance where she can be among others with her condition? I think that would have made an awkward change of life for me, less awkward. Good luck!"

Trichsters,1l7e71,cinemachick,4,Wed Aug 28 00:09:54 2013 UTC,"(The following advice is actually for you- I misread the prompt and assumed you wanted personal advice. I'll include something for Jimi at the bottom.)    The biggest thing I wish I'd had from my mother was support. A lot of times, I felt like my mom couldn't 'handle' the fact that I wasn't normal. My pulling really stressed her out, and she relayed that stress to me, which heightened my stress and made things worse. Rather than going to my mom for comfort, I felt like I had to shield myself from her in order to maintain my emotional stability.    As a mom, you serve as both a caretaker and a source of love for Jimi, among other roles. For the sake of Jimi's health, sometimes scolding her behavior will be necessary. But when she's emotional or stressed and just needs a hand to hold, be able to step back and give her the hugs and kisses she needs. Let her know that you'll be there for her, even if she makes a mistake, and that how you feel about her disorder is separate from how you feel about her. Become a safe space for her to let out her emotions and her fears, where she can be reassured that everything will eventually be okay. Knowing she has someone who can soak up her pain and give her a smile can be one of the most liberating feelings for someone with this disorder. Judging by the fact that you're posting here, I'll bet you're already doing this. :)    Advice for Jimi: One of the ways I've dealt with my trich is handcrafts. I like to make small crafts such as origami or friendship bracelets to keep my hands busy. They feature simple, repetitive, unobtrusive movements that I can do while completing schoolwork. Plus, I have something fun to give away at the end! If you find yourself pulling when reading or watching TV, this may be something to try. Chewing gum works, too! I hope you have a great start to your new school year. hug"
Trichsters,1l7e71,cinemachick,1 point,Tue Aug 27 20:07:46 2013 UTC,"I like to think I balance the role of disciplinarian and friend well but you never know.  She's at the age where there are days that I can't do anything right.  She's also very, very ADHD with a lot of stress here at home with 3 little sisters.  Things spun out of control when their father and I divorced.  I do what I can.  4 is a lot to maintain.    she's a wiz at origami and loves friendship bracelets.  the main pulling is at night, in bed.  i've started slathering her hands with greasy lotion at night.  she just picks.  she has ""the scab"" that has been there for about a year and a half, at varying degrees of bloody mess.  when she can't pull, she has to pick.    she'll beat this one day.  right now, she's not very stimulated by school, has skipped a grade after being held back one grade because of her surgery so she's just getting reacquainted with kids she was in class with 2 years ago. she started band so that gives her something new and exciting to do."
Trichsters,1l7e71,fazalazim,1 point,Wed Aug 28 00:07:31 2013 UTC,"Has she tried wearing a nightcap or set of gloves to sleep? That's not a time I usually pull, but I know others on this subreddit have their own techniques for nighttime pulling. Something my therapist has recommended is cutting off technology for at least an hour before bedtime. Maybe have Jimi read a book in bed for the last thirty minutes of each evening? That way, she has a relaxing way to cool off from the long day (stress), has something to get lost in while stimulating her intellectualism (ADHD/gifted), and something to keep her hands busy (holding the book, instead of pulling). Just an idea.    Regardless of whether each day is perfect, you obviously have a lot of love for all your children and care enough about them to seek the best care you can give. That counts for a lot, trust me. She will thank you when she's old enough to understand. :)"
Trichsters,1l7e71,helix19,1 point,Wed Aug 28 02:58:30 2013 UTC,"Hi! First off: You're doing an amazing job as her mom! Keep at it :)  Since you mention ADHD: as a fellow ADHDer/trichster, I've found that my ADHD meds have a MAJOR impact on my trich. I don't know if she is diagnosed with ADHD and is on any meds, and if not, if that is an option. But I can give you my experiences with them and maybe they are useful in figuring out how to beat this. With my meds, I found that on a low dose of methylfenidate (ritalin, 10mg every 4 hours), my trich disappeared completely. On a slightly higher dose it is manageable; I still pull, but not to the extent that I have any bald spots. On the highest dose I had (Concerta; a slow release methylfenidate, 54mg) I found it increased my pulling. I've also seen some people mentioning here and there that they have increased pulling behavior on any of the amphetamine based meds.   Just thought I'd mention this, as it might be a way she can be helped!  Also great advice above from cinemachick, I first came here to write something similar about the handicrafts. I thought it might be helpful for the times when you have a hard time seeing her pull, and not telling her to stop. What you could possibly do instead, is invite her to do things together that keep her hands busy. Like drawing, painting, baking. This way you don't have to tell her stop, but you can distract her from the behavior by doing something fun instead.  Good luck! I wish you guys all the best, and Jimi: you're pretty awesome for having such great self confidence despite your trich! That is very impressive for someone your age :) Never give up, you can beat this!"
Trichsters,1l7e71,llucidslide,3,Fri Sep 6 10:03:43 2013 UTC,"Does she WANT to stop pulling? It's unclear from your post. If not, you need to be clear with her about the damage she is doing to her health. She is still quite young, which is good because it's easier to ""rewire"" thinking processes. She is very lucky to have a mom like you that understands her disorder and wants to help."
Trichsters,1l7e71,llucidslide,2,Tue Aug 27 20:54:09 2013 UTC,"Agreed.  It's a really hard position to be in, because on the one hand it makes things worse if she's stressing out and self conscious of the pulling.  But there ARE lasting consequences to trichotillomania.  I have been pulling since I was 10 and developed really bad repetitive stress injuries in my hands and wrists that have seriously negatively impacted my life, just from the repetitive motion of pulling hair out and feeling it in my fingers. I wish my doctors and parents had been more aggressive in getting me to stop because I am now permanently disabled.  Granted, back then trich was even more unknown and mysterious than it is now, so I'm not sure what would have been done anyway.  It's cool that your daughter is so confident, but that needs to be balanced with the reality of the situation.  She might be ok with it now but she's destined for health problems down the road if it continues.    Does she have aspirations of what she wants to do when she grows up?  Perhaps that's something that could be brought up to her.  As in, ""this could hurt your hands and make it impossible for you to do what you want!""  I had to give up years of schooling and career building to take a job that's not very fun because it's one of few options conducive to my messed up hands.    Edit: added things because I pressed enter too early"
Trichsters,1l7e71,darlingdisaster,1 point,Tue Aug 27 22:11:49 2013 UTC,"Exactly!  There's a fine line between reminding and harping on her. The thought of another bezoar scares the bejeezus out of her and she'll stick her fingers in her ears and yell about ""Don't talk about it"" when I mention it.  Luckily, the chances for another is small since I'm aware now.    I'd also talked to her about permanent follicle damage.  It's not anything she can control.  Right nw, we're working on her eyelashes.  If she can grow a little in, I'll let her start wearing mascara and a little eyeliner to middle school.  I'm also trying to get her to redirect her pulling to herl egs.    We've done journals like crazy...how, when, where was she when she pulled.  She has her Trichy Box, away from all of her sisters that has all of her fidget toys and activities.  Her high pulling times are at night, before goign to sleep.  I've started sitting in the room with them, readin gto her younger sisters and she tends to drift off with them.  But I can't do that forever.    I never thought of anything like carpal tunnel.  Wow.  That certainly makes sense.  She also has physical disabilities (syringomyelia...cyst-like structures in her spine and scoliosis) that prevent her from doing sports and strenuous activities.  She can't help but feel different, no matter how equally she is treated."
Trichsters,1l7e71,OsoBarbilloso,1 point,Wed Aug 28 00:23:17 2013 UTC,"Kid sounds like she's got a lot of struggles and it's really awesome that you've done so much to help her!  Mascara worked magic for my eyelashes so I hope that is something you are able to try soon.  One thing I've been doing lately is taping my fingers with clear, breathable medical tape to help me stop pulling.  You've probably heard all the tricks but figured I'd mention it anyway.  I like it because its not as invasive as gloves so you can still turn pages in a book and do most other things with your hands.  That also relies on cooperation from your daughter though.  I can relate to her because I was totally in denial about my problem for many yearsand didn't really want to listen to the little help parents and doctors offered.  I think I may have felt differently if made aware that the trich was going to ruin my ability to do things I love, like playing instruments and sewing.  I wish it were carpal tunnel-thats fixable!  I don't know exactly what I've done to myself but it's some kind of tendon damage."
Trichsters,1l7e71,Keladry,2,Wed Aug 28 22:05:57 2013 UTC,"I guess it really wasn't clear, was it?  Yes, she wants to quit.  I want her to, too but don't express it as much as I used to because she was hiding her pulling and lying about it.  I didn't want her to feel like she was disappointing me  anymore so right now, we're focusing on her eyelashes.  I keep her head shaved very short.  Once I see a new bald patch starting bc she can grasp it, I'll acknowledge it and say, ""Looks like time for a shave again."".     Thank you for the compliment.  I like to think I'm doing well with this. I often feel badly then snap out of it because that's really, really selfish.  This isn't on me.  It hurts my heart for her but it's not mine, I can never understand this.  That's one reason I thought I'd post here.  Maybe you guys can verbalize things that she cannot just yet.    She has a LOT of doc appts.  She recently had her yearly upper GI to check for obstructions.  Some dark spots but not an opaque black blog like it was with the bezoars.  Besides that, weekly therapy, OCD specialist/psych every 2 weeks, and monthly medical doc appts to check her belly, keep an eye on her weight.  She was only 48 lbs and 10 years old when she had surgery. Within 3 months of taking out that monster, she'd gained 33 lbs and is still there, around 81lbs.  The bezoar was preventing her from getting nutrients.  At least we know now.  When it was discovered, it was close to being a solid mass, with no passage at all for food/fluids.  It's a lot for me, I can only imagine for her.    Plus, she misses her daddy terribly and I can't fix that.  I've tried and tried but he just disappoints.  We're learning to move on without him."
Trichsters,1l7e71,Annielan,2,Wed Aug 28 00:16:57 2013 UTC,"I have trichophagia as well as trichotillomania, and I can symptathize.   Im just glad you know and understand what this is - I never had anyone that did, and I went into my late teens before I found out by ""accident"".   I pull more, eat more when Im upset. I don't need to be crying or have a panic attack.. its more as if my baseline is uneven, if that makes sense. Like Im constantly uncalm.   What I wish someone had told me is that there is help. I wished someone had told me that its okay to feel sad about it, because disallowing myself from feeling sad just made my feelings of guilt and shame all the more bigger, as I felt I was letting everyone down. I'd be really strong in front of people but when I was alone it'd just come crumbling, and huge patches of hair would disappear... and in the morning, my throat would be coarse.   I understand your motivations for not telling her to ""stop it"", but that is something you need to do. You need to help her stop it. Bring her to a behavioural psychologist and look for ways for her to turn her behavior, because this isn't something that you can do on your own. Not with trichophagia, not when its this severe.   (PSA: I am currently typing this with cotton gloves on my hands, because I tend to pull when I'm by the computer.)   I get upset when people tell me to stop. Partly because I don't like being found out, and partly for being interrupted in my ""ritual"". But I recognize that they are doing it to help me. My SO does this thing where instead of telling me to stop, he just takes my hand, kisses it, and holds it so I don't get to keep pulling. The frustration kind of drowns out in the sweetness of the act. Just make sure that you help her stop while not shaming her.   I hope that she'll be able to control it. I really, really hope so."

I just wanted to thank you for your support.  I'm sure it's immensely valuable to Jimi.  I think that you know that threats are obviously not the way to go.  My mother used to threaten to cut my hair short when I chewed on all the front pieces.  I think that this prompted me to start pulling so that it would be less obvious.  I now sport a pixie cut because shorter hair is not as satisfying (for me) to pull.  No real luck on cutting out the eating.  I do think it was better when I was on adderall and anti-depressants, but then again, I only started taking those as an adult."
Trichsters,1l6y67,PresidentRaggy,4,Tue Aug 27 15:36:34 2013 UTC,"Tell them the truth. I look at what we have like a disease with some therapies but no cure, yet. We're not 100% in control of this and especially when we're stressed, we harm ourselves in this way.  I'm at a point in my life where I'm done making excuses and pretending this away. I don't think anyone ever bought into my excuses anyhow. Maybe you're not here yet so perhaps a firm and friendly ""I'd prefer not to talk about it"" is your best bet. Your lie isn't unbelievable, but for me there was a lot less stress about the entire thing because I pull from many visible places. So for me, telling the truth about our condition makes anyone that knows less likely to bring it up, as they can sympathize with my situation more.   Good luck!"

In the last year, I have gone through some trying times, and have alienated friends by being honest with them. I know, they're not good friends, etc. So I'm trying to make new friends. I don't want to tell everyone everything about myself, especially when I haven't known them long. (People see things like this as a red flag and run away, and frankly, if I don't get healthy human interaction, I'll only get worse.) Instead, I equivocate: I tell them ""it's a reaction I get sometimes, don't worry, it's not contagious,"" and that usually solves that. If they press, I use its medical name, and if that doesn't shut down the questions, I will be completely honest. I figure, if you're prying that much, and the answer makes you uncomfortable, you deserve to feel that way.   I'm just doing my best with what I have.  Edited to say: I don't feel I'm being dishonest when I say it's ""a reaction."" It is a reaction-- to stress, to fear, to anxiety, etc. I don't even realise I'm doing it sometimes. (Someone in another thread here said they ""trance"" while picking, and I completely relate.) I also find that this approach makes it easier for others to understand. If they see it akin to a nervous tic, it stops looking threatening."

Trichsters,1l4hto,ke28,1 point,Mon Aug 26 23:10:20 2013 UTC,I'm new to this subreddit and hearing that someone else kinda for those ones (thick coarse hairs) makes me feel a lot better. I constantly feel my hair hoping to have one to pull.
Trichsters,1l4hto,dcsmith2010,2,Thu Sep 12 16:19:37 2013 UTC,Absolutely I've had this. My two 'high-pull' spots are behind my ears. The regrowth is thicker and I have noticeable ringlets in those spots only. The rest of my hair is straight/wavy. The same thing happens with regrowth after chemo for a lot of people. When the root/follicle is damaged (or pulled out/regrown) it can take a while for the hair to get back to normal again. For some people it never does.  I chose to take the thicker/coarser regrowth bits as a blessing. Thicker hair balancing out the thin! :p
Trichsters,1l4hto,iristhevirus,1 point,Mon Aug 26 21:37:25 2013 UTC,I have dead straight hair and pulled behind my ears for about a year in primary school.  It grew back in ringlets.  Same with the patch at the top when it grew back after a different pulling phase.  was all a bit weird.

Trichsters,1l4hto,soinuit,2,Sun Oct 6 16:57:15 2013 UTC,"Oh ya! I remember the new growth being the most satisfying to pull. What helped me let the lashes grow past this stage was fake nails. They inhibited my dexterity and made it really hard to grip the tiny lashes. I don't know about you, but I'm a real tomboy so getting fakeys was pretty bizarre. And all my friends were confused by it. But it worked for me, and hey they looked pretty good."

These are intertwined for me, as I have mild ADD, which I self medicate with caffeine since I stopped taking a prescription stimulant. But my anxiety is made worse with caffeine. Have you ever been diagnosed for ADD/ADHD? Do you consume caffeine? Have you notice any correlation between your symptoms and caffeine consumption?  Welcome to the club, by the way. You'll find no judgement here."
Trichsters,1l3bvb,lizzyshoe,2,Mon Aug 26 05:54:43 2013 UTC,I've always wondered if I was slightly ADD...I hate saying that though because it seems like everyone is diagnosing their kids with ADD/ADHD nowadays when the kid is actually just being a kid. I can get hyperfocused on to specific things and never had too much trouble keeping focused in class though so I hesitate to say I am.   I've never liked sodas much and I only recently started drinking coffee in the past...two years? I think. And even now it's just one cup in the morning and I can go without (I just like waking up with it.) I haven't noticed a correlation between them...but I'll keep a closer eye on that.

Yes, ADHD has a stigma but it is a very real disorder with very debilitating consequences. I didn't believe that statement 100% myself until about 45 days ago when I was put on a new ADHD med that FINALLY fixes me!  I'm a 42 year old woman who has had serious ADHD symptoms since I was a child, but didn't seek treatment until ten years ago. That's how long it's taken me to find just the right meds.  Ironically, after my meds started working this time, I had the courage to ask my psychiatrist about my dermatillomania for the first time."

Trichsters,1l356q,Trichthrowaways,2,Mon Aug 26 00:44:30 2013 UTC,"260813 is right, though they are related ""cousin"" disorders.  The subred that covers your issue exclusively is /r/compulsiveskinpicking.  With either condition it can be considered less something you ""have"" and more something you are or you do.  It's a compulsion, an addiction of sorts.  Someone with an alcohol addiction doesn't typically think of themselves as having alcoholism; he or she is an alcoholic.  It's similar with trichotillomaniacs and dermatillomaniacs.  It sounds like I'm arguing a semantic, but I'm really not (and there is a point, I promise).  Having a condition or disease removes the possibility of controlling the issue through willpower, discipline, and personal strength.  All these things are required in abundance to get it under control even with medical assistance.  If you feel that your skin picking is problematic then you should head to the compulsive skin picking forum.  Whether you're a dermatillomanic is based on whether the behavior is negatively impacting your life in some way and you still continue it.  Just about everyone picks and pulls a little here and there, but the compulsion, the inability or extreme difficulty in controlling one's actions in that regard is what sets it apart."
Trichsters,1l356q,Dalisca,2,Mon Aug 26 08:48:06 2013 UTC,"It's not trichotillomania. It may be dermotillomania. /r/Trichsters welcomes those who have trichotillomania, dermotillomania, rhinotillexomania and so on."

Part of the reason I haven't rushed to do it is because people just finding us often feel a huge sense of relief and will post their story and specific questions they have. And the wonderful people on this sub happily respond to the ""new here"" kinds of posts. Personally, I think those threads are wonderful and not redundant enough to try to put an end to them. People in this sub need to know they're not alone and need to experience the support we all can provide.    If I saw a lot of abandoned threads from newbies, I would feel that it's more urgent to create a specific FAQ for us. I'm on my phone atm, but if I recall, TLC's website is linked in the sidebar (if it's not I'll fix that) and that website is amazing and full of a lot of the information we would cover in the FAQ.   Edit: additional thought, I could edit the side bar to make TLC's website more prominent, like add some info about the website, or if they have an FAQ type of page, link to that directly, too, and mark it as such, etc. I'm glad you made this post!

My main concern is connecting people who want to learn more with as much information as we can provide. For someone who's unfamiliar with reddit's layout or doesn't feel comfortable making a post, having a link in the sidebar to a collection of member responses may be an alternate solution.

Trichsters,1l1i4j,aivlys,1 point,Sun Aug 25 16:13:07 2013 UTC,I used to destroy my nose as well -- same problem.

You aren't damaged goods, you're a human being with wants, needs, fears, and desires. You have every right to feel scared sometimes, you have the right to learn how to master your feelings, and you have the right to feel good about yourself. If this is your first time to the subreddit, welcome- you've come to a safe place.    Are you still seeing a therapist? It seems you have a lot of issues that are causing you stress and anxiety. Given the abuse you have faced in your life, I would hope that a good therapist would give you tools to confront the negative feelings these experiences cause. As you've figured out, trich is usually a stress-induced disorder. The insomnia and PTSD are causing anxiety, which leads to pulling- not to mention the added stress of pulling itself. It's a hard cycle to pull yourself out of, and extremely difficult to do alone.    If you aren't with a therapist, I hope you have a circle of people that you trust and talk to about your issues. Having someone who understands and can talk you through a stressful period is immensely helpful and highly beneficial to recovery. I've built a small group of people, mainly close friends and family, that I can vent to on a bad day and receive encouragement from. You know who to ask- sometimes it's a parent, sometimes it's a friend, sometimes it's a counselor or religious leader. Someone who knows when to be firm and when it's better to comfort. If you don't already have this network in your real life, please feel free to reach out to the members of this subreddit. We all know what you're going through and want to help. You can PM me anytime if you'd like to chat, about trich or otherwise.    As for specific tips: I am a lash/brow/'down south' puller, though I used to comb through my hair looking for 'loose ones'. The best place to start is identifying when and why you pull. Is it right after dinner when you're on the computer? With one hand while you're reading at school? After a big argument, or a stressful situation? Late at night when you're tired? Knowing your 'risk factors' can help you find strategies to reduce pulling. I figured out recently that I was more tempted to pull my lashes when my contacts were dry. I've started using eye drops at night, and my pulling has decreased significantly. If you can figure out what situations, times of day, or emotional responses trigger your trich, it's easier to find ways to combat the pulling urge.    Please PM me if you ever need someone to talk to. I wish you the best of luck. hug"

It's a constant struggle that I hope one day to beat, and I hope you can too. My goal is to stop pulling before I have kids because I don't want to pass on the ""habit"" to my children.

Trichsters,1kjc6d,adellaguardia,6,Sat Aug 17 05:43:22 2013 UTC,I know exactly what you're talking about.  The only thing I've found that sort of helps is dripping cold water on that spot on the eyelid.  It cools the itching slightly but the change in sensation helps as a distraction.

Trichsters,1kjc6d,jillystrunk88,2,Sat Aug 17 13:45:44 2013 UTC,A thin layer of Vaseline usually helps me...also stops me from being able to do more damage because the eyelashes are then too greasy to pull...just be careful not to get it on your eye

Trichsters,1kglg7,helix19,2,Fri Aug 16 01:51:57 2013 UTC,"Thanks for your answer.   Exercise seems to be really important. From my memory of my teenage years to now there is probably some kind of pattern. In times where I did a lot of exercise life was more bearable and enjoyable. I've stumbled across the (pop-science and unfortunatly unsourced)  Spark book and it mentions functional neurogenesis and anxiety relief.   My problem is at the moment to get into a routine again. It's just shitty to not show up in your sports clubs for weeks / month then show up again and when life gets difficult you disappear. But it's a challenge I have to take I guess. I'll take a look at the blog.   Also exercise seems to work best for me if I'm totally sweating at least once or twice a day. E.g. I've noticed effects of running in my life only when I started to run daily and ran longer distances (10km). 5km 2 or 3 times a week did not had much effect.   I've never got a diagnoses for depression, got one for general anxiety disorder and did a behavioral therapy which helped to certain degree. There are for sure also signs of ADHD-PI and depression in my life but at the moment I'm thinking these symptons are connected to my lifestyle (too much chaos) and vanish once I sort that out. However sorting that out turned out to be difficult.  Thanks for the heads-up regarding the dentist/docters. It's really the shame and the related emotions that making your life misable not the fact of trich itself...   Regarding NAC. I've found here some drink tablets with 600mg in each. In the study regarding trich they used doses between 1800mg/day and 2400mg/day. What would you recommend? I've thought about starting with 1200mg to 1800mg a day. Is just drinking the tables effective for the nac intake? I'm a little worried to put so much cough expectorant in my system. But on the other hand in comparison to coffee and cigarettes it's probably the least of my worries.   As for triggers - Coffeine is definitly triggers it for me too as does staying up late. But the most intensive trigger is really stress in the form of duties or interaction with other poeple e.g. work emails or beeing late on an assignment. That is hopefully to a certain degree manageable and I've made some progress in that direction.   Also Best of luck for you and thanks for taking the time!"

Trichsters,1kglg7,tripping_right_now,2,Fri Aug 16 12:30:22 2013 UTC,Go to a nail salon and have them cover your nails in a coat of clear acrylic.  You will not be able to bite or pick them.  It also makes pulling your hair out much more difficult.  The acrylic is almost impossible to detect.
Trichsters,1kglg7,tripping_right_now,1 point,Fri Aug 16 23:28:51 2013 UTC,"I seem to follow pulling pattern that is very similar to yours. When I am on the computer or reading and my mind is wandering, I pick. I used to bite my nails ferociously, but as my trich developed around age 16 I stopped biting. I too sometimes pick around people I'm very familiar with, like family, and it gets embarrassing... But when I am totally at ease and with friends, I never have an urge.   In addition, maybe look into a prescription medication. I had a conversation with my aunt (who I recently discovered suffered with trich for her entire life) about her hair pulling habits. She told me Prozac and Zoloft have both worked wonders for her; I am going to look into a Prozac prescription soon.   But for right this moment, the best advice I can offer is: block your hands from reaching your [head/face/etc]. Use gloves, wear a hat, do anything you can to make sure your fingers cannot touch that hair. I pick my brows, and rub castor oil on them to help prevent my picking. I've also began to play with the rings I wear or my watch to distract myself. Sometimes, when I'm alone and can't be embarrassed, I wear rubber finger pads--like page turners for books.   It's hard to admit, but a lot of preventing pulling is mind over matter (obviously easier said than done). Meditation and relaxation techniques sound like exactly what you should be doing to reduce your stress levels. I actually purchased a book on meditation today and will be incorporating it into my daily life!   Best of luck with beating this with us all! Luckily this community is very supportive."

Trichsters,1kct9s,Captncoke89,2,Wed Aug 14 16:17:49 2013 UTC,"The lashes will grow back, the impulse to pull them out will probably stay put. I've been pulling since the age of 5 or 6 as far as I know, and I'm 29. I pull my hair and eyes primarily. We all know the feeling too well of 'the one' - that one super dark, super wiry, thick hair that just HAS to come out.  Not that it would work for you, but I found owning up to what I deal with to people close me took a lot of the pressure off of me. My family knew, but now my friends know and I tell anyone that wants to know what's up. Why hide it, it's obvious to most?  Have you considered talking to a mental health professional? There are lots of therapies to try ranging from cognitive behavioral modification, self awareness / meditation, prescription medicines, OTC supplements like NAC. Blunting your fingertips with bandaids or tape can also help you not to pull.  I think one think most of us agree on is figuring out what's triggering you, usually something stressful, and work to reduce that influence.  Good luck, you're not alone and the damage is temporary. Don't be too hard on yourself, your disease is real and will power alone doesn't work for most of us."
Trichsters,1kct9s,steelcitykid,1 point,Wed Aug 14 16:48:59 2013 UTC,"Thank you for your response!  I guess I'm kinda scare & somewhat embarrassed to admit to family & friends my ""issue"". When I was 14 I pulled all of my eyelashes out & my mom & dad paraded me around to their friends saying ""look what Captncoke89 did to her eyelashes! She pulled them all out!"" which of course lead to them asking why I did that & being 14 & not knowing myself, I just kinda internalized everything & I vowed never to let anybody to see me like that again. It didn't help that a couple of years ago my sister brought it up at the dinner table "" hey, remember that time you pulled all your lashes out? You were such a fucking weirdo back then, lol"" little did she know that I just had a particularly bad episode of picking the night before. So coming out to family is going to be a little tough, I want to be able to articulate it in a way that doesn't make me sound like a hypochondriac; the struggle with trichotillomania is very real for me.  I have actually considered seeking help in the past but I've always dismissed it on the bases that I had enough willpower to stop. And again, it always came back to fear, fear of rejection, being labeled ""crazy"", or just what people thought about me. Also seeking help meant admitting I have a problem, which I spent years hiding, thinking it would just ""go away"" or fix itself. Talking about it today on reddit has really help, & yes, I will be seeking help from a mental health professional in the very near future.  I do have quite a bit of stress going on in my life right now & I'm damn near positive that's probably what set off the pulling. I've been upping my workouts as a way to combat the stress, but as you know you can't do that 24/7.   Thank you for your kind words. Just knowing I don't have to go through this alone anymore has already been a huge load off my shoulders. I've been on the subreddit reading quite a bit & I do feel better already. :)"

You are not alone. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 6th grade, over 10 years ago. However, in 2nd grade, I began pulling my eyelashes. No one has ever really made an issue about it, and I didn't know anyone else did this until about 6 months ago. In middle school i moved to my newly earned facial hair. (I would pull my mustache hair, except for the sensitive middle spot, giving me a lovely hitler stache... lol?) How I love a smooth face... Once I'm clean shaved, it's like I don't have trich, just some weird obsession with my jawline. I'm almost always touching my face to either feel how great I shaved it, and hopefully not, finding a stray hair. If I do, it's right to my fancy expensive tweezers in front of my total lighting, 7X magnifying, make up mirror until I get it.    and if it's an ingrown hair.... I can't stop myself, so I'll dig as deep as I need to until I get it. I got a lot once, and dug them all out, scabbed up my skin, and looked like a meth head for days. I'm lucky they didn't scar.   What do use to shave? I've spent (too much) time figuring out how to get my shave so close, it feels like its tweezed, to my standard. Also, it should stay too short for a few DAYS so you can't get it. If you want me to give my routine or resources, just pm me. That goes for anyone else. Can I ask you something?

Trichsters,1k2vb1,thrichmaybe,5,Sat Aug 10 07:31:57 2013 UTC,"hug   Here are some suggestions: keep those nails short! And get rid of those tweezers if you can. If you feel you need them to groom your eyebrows (sorry I'm assuming you're a girl) consider getting them done professionally instead. You're in highschool though, so you might now have the money, or it might feel like a lot of money, but if you're doing that much damage to yourself with the tweezers, I think it'd be worth it.   Trichsters and derminators often get into a zone of just pulling, pulling, picking, picking, pulling picking.... try to snap yourself out of it as quickly as you can. Physically remove yourself from where you are. Go chug a glass of water, go do some yoga, or go for a walk, or eat some fruit, or anything else that's healthy to try and get your mind and body out of ""the zone."""

I have a family vacation coming up and I'm leaving them at home. Again, thank you for the response.

Trichsters,1k2vb1,Jo-rmungandr,6,Sat Aug 10 18:11:49 2013 UTC,"I've also found that its satisfying to find an alternative sensory experience to pulling/picking.  For example, I use a slightly abrasive cloth when I wash my skin in the shower, and a rough towel when I dry myself. I use exfoliating creams which have rough particles in, and when I'm sitting watching the TV and my hands are idle, I find that it helps to have something rough or textured in my hands (a beaded necklace, a keyring, a rough comb or hairbrush) which I can use to distract my hands and also get the same sensory experience that I might get from exploring my scalp/cheeks for rough skin etc.  You might find you need to find a whole number of new routines or things to avoid triggering yourself to pull. You won't be able to stop right away, it will be frustrating and you will most definitely relapse now and again, but that's ok, everyone does. c: Keep going, buddy, you will find ways of coping.

Both of my trials stopped my pulling, but also left me flat, anhedonic and sexually averse, and then the pulling begins anyway. I've known no pullers with particular success with them; the logic is that trich and OCD can be similarly treated, but they really aren't the same.  The only stuff I've had luck with is the antipsychotic Zeldox, and with the anti-epilectic lamotrigine, in combination with 1000 mg bid of NAC. The lamotrigine works vastly better, which I think lends credence to the belief that trich is more neurological than mental illness, but who knows.  Regardless, you'll never have 100% success with medication if you are an older puller, breakthrough pulling still happens. Progress, not perfection, should be the motto of trich as well as AA.

Trichsters,1jo559,raindead,1 point,Mon Aug 5 04:34:53 2013 UTC,Doubled my cipralex dose to 20mg about a month ago. I believe my trich has worsened in that time. But my depression and anxiety are way better. I feel like a few occurrences of bad picking/pulling happened following a missed dose.
Trichsters,1jgg3w,ShittyDuckFace,7,Wed Jul 31 23:27:37 2013 UTC,"Get a jar.  Every time you think about pulling but don't, put a penny in. (or a paperclip. or a shiny pebble. whatever.)   Don't take any out when you pull.  Each moment is a new start."

Trichsters,1jgg3w,poopzie123,4,Thu Aug 1 04:05:04 2013 UTC,Just grew my hair out a little after sticking with a short buzz for a couple months. Started pulling again a couple weeks ago and now the big bald spot is back.  Shit most certainly sucks. Might need to revisit the buzzers...

Trichsters,1jgzhj,Brainkissed,3,Thu Aug 1 03:54:11 2013 UTC,Interesting.. I have hair and I actually dream of the opposite. My dreams involve me pulling all my eyelashes out and that scares the shit out of me cause it feels so real.
Trichsters,1jgzhj,Heligkebab,2,Thu Aug 1 06:28:29 2013 UTC,"Yes.  I dream of having the thick, blonde bob I've always wanted on a very regular basis.  It's actually my default ""image""; when I have dreams that occur in third person (a lot of them do) I always see myself with my ideal hair rather than what I have right now.  I have yet to notice what my dream self sees her eyelashes and eyebrows looking like, though.  Though I have had dreams where I was embarrassed for not shaving my legs, which is a bit funny but unrelated."

I'm going to try meditation and yoga to start so I can relieve my stress and anxiety. My friends have been more supportive lately. I don't know whether it's because I've been more vocal or because they can see that I'm making progress, but it's really been helpful to have someone to talk to if I'm feeling like I'm going to pull. :) And thank you!"

Trichsters,1jdup7,Theycallmemaybe,5,Tue Jul 30 23:31:31 2013 UTC,"Hi! Ok, I gotta ask, as you don't seem to be clear here, do you or do you not pull hair? Answer honestly, if not to us here then to yourself. Think about it. Even if you don't intend to do it, do you physically pull out the hair? I think most people with trich don't have intent to pull. It just ""happens"" and then its shameful afterwards. (It is, after all, a impulse control disorder.)  But a lot of people have tendencies to play with their hair without it being something harmful. You do say that ""more hair comes out then usual"" though, you mean your natural hairloss have increased (you get more hair in your hand when you play with it, but you dont actually pull out the root yourself) or that you are actually increasing in PULLING? Your story is not really untypical for trichsters though. Starting young, as a playful thing, and increasing in puberty.   But if you aren't pulling then it isn't trich.  Even if it isn't trich and its indeed still bothersome for you then you should try finding something else to do with your hands? /r/calmhands could maybe help you out there.   In the case you are actually pulling, and you've been doing it for nine years and it is increasing; yes, I think you should seek help. Good luck!"

So much to think about!  So much to do!  What a big change!  Take a deep breath.  Don't be scared that your trich is ""coming back"".  It's not like cancer -- you don't have to wait with a huge question mark about whether or not you'll go into remission.  YOU are in control of this situation.  You've defeated it before and now you are aware that the bad habits are returning.  You are able to nip this thing in the bud before it becomes a serious issue again.  If you're worried about your eyelashes (and only your eyelashes) give yourself a reminder not to fall into that old stress habit, even if it feels like you're greeting an old friend.  So, make it not feel like an old friend.  In other words, do something that'll remind you about the fact that you're fighting a habit you've already defeated.  Go all hipster and get yourself some glasses with non-prescription lenses (or wear your glasses for a while if you normally wear contact lenses).  Go to a salon and get acrylic nails so your hands will feel a little different.  The point is, do something that'll make the process not feel normal.  Whether you can beat it again on your own is entirely up to you.  It couldn't hurt to talk to someone about it, so if you feel inclined to go that route then don't hesitate.  We're all human beings here, all beautiful creatures full of faults.  There is no shame in feeling like you might need a little help with something -- it's the end result that's important.

Trichsters,1ipwt7,amime24,5,Sat Jul 20 22:45:16 2013 UTC,"Hmm.. you sound a little like me. I started pulling for ""cosmetic reasons"" -- there was an eyebrow, eyelash, or hair out of place, and I pulled it because I thought it looked weird. But now I pull like all the time and have missing patches on my eyes and brows... SO what I'm trying to say is I'm not sure you have full-fledged trich, but you could be headed that way, so stop yourself before it gets worse!!"
Trichsters,1ipwt7,kdoh25,3,Sun Jul 21 00:26:50 2013 UTC,"I started the same way and completely agree with you. At first it was for cosmetic reasons, except I constantly found new reasons to pull and eventually stopped caring about reasons and did it regardless."
Trichsters,1ipwt7,LeaperToad,3,Tue Jul 23 19:27:40 2013 UTC,"I think it's more become a habit for you than actual trich.  Habits are still hard to break, though, which is probably why you're having problems!  I would say it's not, because it's only ""loose"" hairs that would fall out with negligible force, whereas trichotillomania usually involves pulling out rooted hairs.  Not to say you can't benefit from some of the behavioural techniques posted here to try and deal with it!"
Trichsters,1ik50r,rilliam,5,Thu Jul 18 14:07:34 2013 UTC,"I think it depends greatly on the people involved and how well you know each other. Personally, if someone I didn't know very well asked me ""how come you only pull this area?"", it would make me feel very self-conscious and while it might not trigger me to pull in another area, it would probably feel pretty shitty for being called out like that, even if the person didn't mean to make me feel that way.   At the same time, if it was one of my close friends who was open to getting to know more about the disorder and how I handle it, I would respond quite differently. I might explain that I've always had issues with my eyebrows and that I have pulled elsewhere but that the eyebrows are just... convenient? That's not the right word, but I'm not sure what else to use right now.    Obviously I cannot speak for all trichsters/derminators, but for me the areas I pulled/picked did change depending on the situation and possibly how ""in control"" I was of my trich at the time."
Trichsters,1ik50r,fingerpies,4,Thu Jul 18 14:40:57 2013 UTC,"I don't know if I completely understand the question, but here's my response anyway...   For the first years of my Trich, I was an eyelash/ eyebrow and pubic puller only. Then after highschool, the type of stressors in my life changed. To be completely honest and open, it was once my group of friends started doing heroin regularly that I started pulling from my scalp. (I never got addicted, thank god. But I started drinking heavily.) Over time, I stopped pulling my eyelashes regularly.   The few people I've told don't really ask me about my Trich at all. My mom has once or twice asked if I still feel like I need to wear a hat. But I think it's more her way of checking up on me, and showing that she cares, but she doesn't really understand and doesn't know how to help.   If my boyfriend notices me pulling or playing with my hair, he'll just lightly tap my hand.   We don't often know that we're pulling.   Talking about Trich can be incredibly uncomfortable. It's embarrassing! And we often have no control over it."
Trichsters,1ik50r,llucidslide,4,Thu Jul 18 15:04:37 2013 UTC,"It is possible to change pulling behavior.  I started off pulling only my eyelashes but moved to eyebrows because of the eye infections I was causing (trading one bad habit for another, I know).  The change was not instigated by anything anyone said to me.  Personally I would not be offended at all if anyone asked me about it and could actually give them some explanation for the location of the pulling.  However, I've had the disorder for a looonnggg time now and it's part of my personality that I don't care so much about what people think.  I'm sure others may be more sensitive about it so you may want to be careful, depending on whom you're asking."
Trichsters,1ik50r,clothes_girl,3,Thu Jul 18 15:08:04 2013 UTC,"I would suggest that there is no real rhyme or reason to where people pull from, other than perhaps visibility (if they pull from non-visible places, it's easier to hide the problem).  With that being said, I would compare it to any illness affecting one area of the body, it's possible it will spread to other places, it's possible it won't."
Trichsters,1ik50r,pseudoscienceoflove,2,Thu Jul 18 20:46:38 2013 UTC,"People asking me about my trich doesn't bother me at all. Depends on the person, though. So, you asking me about me pulling my eyelashes wouldn't trigger me.  When I'm nervous or anxious when I'm talking, though, I play with my hair in a very distracting manner. The reason I don't pull, probably, is because I wouldn't be able to pull without realizing because I need to maintain eye contact."
Trichsters,1ik50r,ihavetrexarms,1 point,Sat Jul 20 04:09:40 2013 UTC,"It might change, but you'll probably find that most stick with one or a few specific places. I have always been an eyelash and eyebrow puller, and if someone asked me why those where the places I pulled from, my answer would be ""I don't know,"" the same answer I would give if someone asked why I pulled in the first place. How bad my pulling is may vary due to external stressors, etc but I've never really extended it to other places on my body with the exception of a few occasions."
Trichsters,1ik50r,KaylaAnne,1 point,Thu Jul 18 16:24:37 2013 UTC,"I haven't opened up to a lot of people about my trich. Recently a few more know because I shaved my head. When those close to me ask questions about my trich, although I might be a little uncomfortable actually talking about it, I know the questions come from a good place and they are just trying to understand.  For me at least, although trich is different for everyone, my pulling spots vary. My strongest urges come from my scalp, and I have a very large bald spot that is starting to fill in (thank goodness) since Im now 16 days pull free from there. But when I try to ignore the urges there, it helps me to pull from other ""less harmful"" areas such as my legs, my under arms, and even my pubic area.   By less harmful, I mean that even if I pull a significant amount, it wont bother me. Obviously a bald spot on my head is pretty noticeable, but if I plucked every hair off my leg no one would notice. It is my goal to stop pulling completely one day, but for now it is a good outlet so that I can let the hair on my head grow back.  But to answer your question more directly, I dont think that asking a person a question about their trich would cause them to pull elsewhere (Im generalizing from my experience though, I could be wrong). For some, depending on how bad their trich is, or where they are in the recovery, it can be triggering to talk about trich though. I know I get urges more frequently when I am talking or thinking about it, or if Im just scratching an itch up there it can turn into an urge.  It depends on your relationship with the person with trich. If it is someone who you are close to and who probably trusts you, maybe start off with ""Is it ok if I ask you a question about your hair/trich?"" If they want to talk about it, this can be very helpful. I know I want to talk about it a lot more than I do, because I worry that not everyone wants to hear it, or I just dont know how to bring it up. To be this direct though, it is probably best that you are close with the person involved, so that they are comfortable enough with you to be honest if they dont want to talk about it."

I kid myself. Some how tricking myself into thinking I am pulling in moderation and not making a bald spot but I always do. Trich is a impulse control disorder. I simply struggle with the impulse to pull my hair when I feel anxious or over stimulated in order to self calm.  I have does this for 23 years. It's weird where I pull on my head. I have four spots that feel good. Some spots on my head feel painful and I couldn't force myself to pull in those areas even if I tried. May I ask why you are curious? Is this research?"

I guess they just wouldn't sell enough of it to justify keeping it around.  Mine are in capsule form, and rather large for capsules at that.  Here's the most in-depth article about it.  Note the dosage recommendations, I'm starting with 1,200 mg myself.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044191/  This is the article that convinced me to go ahead and try it, otherwise I wouldn't have been quite convinced."

Trichsters,1i41o3,fingerpies,4,Thu Jul 11 22:06:46 2013 UTC,"This is going to sound terrible as well, but I feel I should add: I've started smoking cannabis. And while I am high I feel abosolutely no urge to pull. At all. It is wonderful when I can smoke a few days in a row because I'll look in the mirror and I'll have a full set of eye brows. It's obviously a crutch, and not an easy one to keep up because I hate being high all the time. So obivously if there is something that I can do, I am open to the suggestion."
Trichsters,1i41o3,marblecargirl,3,Thu Jul 11 22:11:54 2013 UTC,"There's actually scientific data to back this up. Another person in this sub was prescribed a THC pill that significantly helped with their Trich. So maybe that's not ""scientific"" because I can't quite remember the anecdote."
Trichsters,1i41o3,She_Spock,4,Thu Jul 11 23:37:33 2013 UTC,"I prefer smoking THC oil out of a vaporizer, than the actual cannabis, it's easier on my lungs, and the high is much more productive."
Trichsters,1i41o3,steelcitykid,3,Fri Jul 12 14:43:13 2013 UTC,"I so wish it had the same effect on me. Reading this is making me so depressed. I smoke for my fibromyalgia pain, but it actually seems to make my pulling worse. I will be doing pretty well with my eyebrows, but as soon as I hit the vaporizer, an entire eyebrow is gone before I know it. I am so bummed that it has the opposite effect on me :("

Trichsters,1hwaq5,Ukulehailey,2,Mon Jul 8 23:27:28 2013 UTC,"Sure, I've read quite a few. The first one I ever read was Self-Esteem by Matthew McKay and that one really changed my life. My other favorites are mostly Buddhist-oriented such as Pema Chodron's books When Things Fall Apart and Start Where You Are. Thich Nhat Hanh is another wonderful Buddhist author who wrote one of my favorite books, The Miracle of Mindfulness. Oh, and if you haven't read Christina Pearson's book Pearls, it's a must read for all hair pullers. She's the founder of TLC and Pearls is like a daily devotional, meant to be read a page a day."

Trichsters,1hungn,MybuddyWill,1 point,Mon Jul 8 07:08:49 2013 UTC,"I think we've all felt this way at one point or another.  That final push into feeling like it's never going to get better is terrifying, but I promise you that you will find yourself having better days than today.  Have you tried talking to your husband about what he can do that's more helpful for you?  I've found that telling friends (or those who I trust enough to relate my pulling to) that they should, for example, grab my hand and lead me if we're walking somewhere and they notice me reaching for my hair, or suggest a dextrous activity like video games if I'm getting antsy in the same way.  No one that I know likes being told ""hey, stop that""--as if we know we're even pulling half of the time!  And I know everyone's not a fan of this suggestion, but if you really do have other underlying destructive behaviors and loathing about your pulling, it might be time to talk to a professional.  I know that cycle well, and feeling bad about pulling only leads to more pulling.  Anyways, we're here to help. Don't apologize for getting all of that off your chest. :)"
Trichsters,1hungn,caryatiddreams,1 point,Mon Jul 8 20:02:10 2013 UTC,"I've talked to a professional before about depression and tried a few medications but none of them ever affected the hair pulling. And I mentioned it to the doctor but he just seemed to focus more on if I'm going to harm myself in a more direct/severe way or making sure I wasn't suicidal which I really wasn't. I don't know if he just doesn't see it being as bad as it actually is because I don't know how to talk about it or if he just doesn't think it's much of a concern. I had to stop going because I didn't have anyone to keep my kids during my appointments and they don't need to hear me talk about the things I needed to talk about.  If my husband catches me doing it, he'll say stop, and he has suggested other things like video games, or cleaning or puzzles- anything that I'll have to use my hands to do. He's even just held both my hands to keep me from pulling which makes me feel a lot better.  The problem most of the time is that I will almost obsess with pulling on my hair until I'm able to get that certain one or until I can't ""feel"" my hair there screaming at me anymore. (sounds absurd, I know.) As much as the physical sensation is there, it's also in my head."
Trichsters,1hungn,caryatiddreams,2,Mon Jul 8 21:03:11 2013 UTC,"Well, the idea of trying to find an underlying cause to your stress/depression seems like the right idea.  For most people, pulling is a symptom of a greater underlying issue, so it seems reasonable that figuring out the root cause of the pulling would help illuminate why you choose to pull or self-harm in any other way.  Also I'm fairly certain a therapist's number one goal is to make sure you're not hurting yourself, so, for someone who's not very attune to trich, making sure you're not doing immediate, long-term, fatal damage to yourself is probably more pressing than pulling your hair.  Sucks, and I've been there, but it's understandable.  Have you tried cognitive therapy?  That might be more up your alley.  And no, does not sound absurd.  I know that feeling.  That feeling has lead to bleeding pores and hangnails and other gross inflammation. :\  Edit: Also, medications taking away pulling is sort of a mixed bag.  Medications aim to lower stress or even out mood shifts, which should in turn make a person less apt to pull because they aren't feeling the pressures they used to.  The muscle memory, however, takes longer to deteriorate, and so does the rush of finding the ""perfect"" hair.  Another disease/symptom issue, pardoning the term."
Trichsters,1hungn,PresidentRaggy,1 point,Mon Jul 8 21:58:07 2013 UTC,"I haven't tried cognitive therapy, I need to read back up on it and see if I can find a doctor who maybe is more familiar with trich either as it's own issue or a symptom of something else. I just can't explain it to people I know because they just get this weird look on their faces like... uhm, okay.   I had something for a while that made me feel a lot better but it always just ends up with me not being able to make it to the appointments and just running out or tapering myself off. I'm still in a much better place than I was which I'm glad for but I'm afraid it's going to get back to how it was and blah blah blah. I didn't think they had any meds that would magically cure trich. :/ A girl can dream though, right? ha.   At least there are people here who know what I'm talking about. Thanks, strangers."

I feel terrible for saying this, but, honestly, if that was in my noggin, I would have pulled it too.  THAT RELIEF!

Trichsters,1hr8er,pseudoscienceoflove,2,Sun Jul 7 01:16:39 2013 UTC,It's a bouquet of roots.  Probably a collection of the plucking or she felt like one good yank to a bunch would be worthwhile.

I'm one of those trichsters that has to play with/eat the roots, so I pick out all the ""bad"" hairs and bunch the ""good"" ones together. It's pretty gross/satisfying.   I feel like it would be easier to stop if I didn't have to play with and eat the fat follicles. I also find them to be more satisfying to pull out -the sensation is different."

Trichsters,1hnpze,happilyemployed,1 point,Fri Jul 5 03:01:18 2013 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! I think I thought (or more... had the naive thought) it was helpful with the picking itself, as it can be helpful in helping people quitting smoking and stuff like this.   I recently moved to a big city in another country, but I don't speak the language... so on top of having trouble finding help I also have to find some help available in english.   I have a friend with the same problem and her therapist once suggested hypnosis but I was wondering if there is any difference/advantage compared to any other type of psychoterapy."
Trichsters,1hnpze,worldclasshater,1 point,Fri Jul 5 07:38:53 2013 UTC,"I think it probably could help with the picking. I specifically told her I was more interested in the underlying issues than in stopping. Plus I am fairly resistant, so she needed to tread lightly."

Trichsters,1h9fkd,Rerellison,3,Fri Jun 28 18:00:04 2013 UTC,"Everyone is different in what helps them, some people, like me, have found success with behavior modification, others with substances like NAC, and others with things that keep their hands busy or create barriers around the pull site. It's really something you'll have to experiment with. A good first step in general though is knowing what your triggers are - for example, stress, lack of sleep, boredom, the kinky hairs, and most negative emotions are triggers for me. So with that I can determine when I'm most likely to pull (I'm in high school) so during tests, when I go to bed late/get up early, homework, boy troubles, etc.  When you know your triggers, you can reduce or combat them. So for me, I can set aside time to reduce my triggers. Such as reading, listening to music, going to bed earlier, taking a nap, eating well, etc. However, this will only go so far.  Another big thing is to forgive yourself when you do pull, because chances are that if you obsess about your 'failure', and let it get to you, you'll pull more. You should check one of my recent posts on here called ""How I've Been Bald Free for Over a Year"" I think is what it's called, and see if what I did may be something that could potentially work for you.  I should also say, please do not expect to see results right away. It takes many of us years to figure out what works for us, and many people still don't have relief. Don't be discouraged by this, just know it's going to take work and forgiving yourself is the best thing you can do. And maybe you'll be one of those gems who sets an example for the rest of us about how you fought off your trich :) Edit: Also, if you want more detailed information on barriers, things to fiddle with in public, etc, just ask and I can tell you about what I've tried/ what I've heard :)"
Trichsters,1h9fkd,Melle515,1 point,Fri Jun 28 20:49:23 2013 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply! Some great information here.  Generally I've been able to identify my triggers as when I'm feeling anxious, nervous, or sad, if it's an emotional trigger. It can just be a kinky hair though which leads to every hair needing to come out.  The thing on forgiving yourself is excellent advice. Over the past year I've been dealing with a lot of issues with depression and anxiety and one of the biggest things that has held me back is beating myself up for not progressing. I guess I need to apply that to my hair pulling too!  Thanks so much! =)"
Trichsters,1h9fkd,Melle515,2,Fri Jun 28 22:02:40 2013 UTC,"Truly I think forgiveness is one of the best, if not the best, thing I ever did to help combat trich. It can quickly become cyclical and feeding itself because you get down about the 2 hairs you just pulled or 35 or 103. See what I'm saying? It's so easy to just give up because you've already done a lot of damage and the frustration is the worst. Just chilling out and recognizing that I could pull more but I didn't NEED to helped me so much. I wish you the best :)"

I have a lot of grey/silver hairs and they tend to grow in in the areas I pull from most.  Probably not the news you were hoping for.

Trichsters,1h9eih,worldclasshater,2,Wed Jul 3 07:07:54 2013 UTC,"I have dark brown hair and pull from specific areas of my scalp. I've been mostly pull free for about a year and I'd say 1/5 of the hairs that have grown back in are white. I'm in my 30s and first started pulling over 20 years ago. I think it does depend on the person and how long you have been pulling as well as genetics, nutrition, and other factors. I'm in a support group and many of my group members have seen white or gray or persistent bald patches from many years of pulling, even after they stop pulling for a significant amount of time."
Trichsters,1h9eih,steelcitykid,2,Mon Jul 8 21:29:57 2013 UTC,"I don't believe so, not directly. However stress can and we can safely say that our stress levels generally affect our propensity to pull. I'm 29 and have a few white ones here and there."
Trichsters,1h9eih,melini,1 point,Fri Jun 28 18:16:16 2013 UTC,"Not likely.  Melanin-producing cells (melanocytes) are the reason you have pigment in your hair, and the loss or migration of those cells are what result in grey/white hairs.  Pulling should not have any effect on the activity of the melanocytes.  Most likely, you just lucked out on genetics, but vitamin deficiencies and hormonal issues may also be at play.  And by the way, this isn't truly considered premature - it would have been premature greying if it happened before you were twenty!  As an aside, people here have been mentioning stress.  Non-injury related stress has not been shown to promote melanocyte migration.  I know it's a popular idea, but emotional or mental stress haven't had any implication in going grey thus far.  Edit: I accidentally a word."
Trichsters,1h9eih,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Fri Jun 28 23:26:10 2013 UTC,"My eyelashes are MUCH lighter than they used to be, and I'm just eighteen...  You sure pulling doesn't have anything to do with it?"
Trichsters,1h9eih,melini,1 point,Sat Jun 29 14:12:32 2013 UTC,"I haven't done a study on it, but pretty sure!  Eyelash and eyebrows lightening also has to do with age, by the way - overall pigmentation and contrast in your facial features and hair decreases as you age.  You may be young for it to be drastic, but I really doubt it has to do with pulling.  My habit is eyelashes, too (and it's been fifteen years now), and they're as dark as they ever were."
Trichsters,1h944d,trichaddict,3,Fri Jun 28 15:31:39 2013 UTC,"You could try setting a timer of some kind for yourself. Some kind of audible alarm so that you have an outside cue telling yourself to stop. It could be on your phone or ipod or whatever. And get rid of your tweezers or any tools you're using to pull.

My situation may be different from yours because I pull mainly at work.  My job is intellectually intense and I read a lot...if I tried to stop pulling it took all my concentration and I couldn't keep up with the workload.  Low dose adderall helps me to be able to concentrate without the pulling (it's like I can just think ""stop"" and I stop and I don't become tense and use all my effort!).  Also I put small pieces of clear medical tape on the fingertips I pull with....subtle, cheap, and super effective.  Low dose risperdal also works well for me but I couldn't deal  with the mild mental cloudiness. Hope that helps!"

Trichsters,1h89n7,llucidslide,1 point,Tue Jul 2 18:34:05 2013 UTC,"My eyebrows are a problem for me as well. To avoid pulling, I use other things to distract myself. Easiest is being around people, because I'm always too embarrassed to ever pull around anyone. Wearing a bracelet or watch with an interesting texture is easy to play with on the go to distract your fingers from your face. Rings are good too. When I'm sitting at home on my computer or reading (two times I most often pull, due to hand-boredom) I play with silly putty. A stress ball would work as well.  Good luck breaking the habit! It all comes down to self discipline I say!"

Trichsters,1gvmue,LinkerGuy,1 point,Thu Jun 27 21:20:52 2013 UTC,"Deja vu :)  Vaseline, Castor Oil and Vitamin E are the most popular and cheapest methods for eyelashes/eyebrows re-growth. I've tried Vitamin E but wanted a serum and use L'Oreal's Lash Boosting Serum for both eyelashes and eyebrows (loved the results). It's over the counter, so it can't change eye color like Latisse or other prescription growth serums, and is cheaper than those, but more expensive than the aforementioned oil/vitamin/jelly. It has a ton of great reviews and lasts about a month or two.  I've heard of another serum specifically for eyebrows; typically recommended for over plucking. It's called Brow Doctor I think? I've also heard good reviews on that. Some mascaras also come with additives like Vitamin E and advertise healthy lashes. I have dark hair, so I can get away with lightly brushing my eyebrows with it. (Fills them in slightly, keeps them neat, and now those additives are on my brows.) There are clear mascaras which would work great for less eyebrow hair or lighter colored brows; I'm just not sure any come with additives."

Trichsters,1gt0gd,caryatiddreams,2,Fri Jun 21 17:27:10 2013 UTC,"I looked into a lot of different oils and serums and such when I first started re-growth. Vaseline, Vitamin E and Castor oil are the ones most frequently used for lash growth, so they're worth a try and are really cheap, and some people swear by it. I tried Vitamin E for awhile out of liquid capsules but it left a lot of residue and didn't feel the greatest if it accidentally got into my eye. I also didn't notice much difference.  I decided I wanted a legitimate serum and so I went searching online for awhile. I use L'Oreal lash boosting serum. It's over the counter so it won't change eye color and it had a TON of great reviews online. I didn't notice extra length or fullness or anything, but it did help a terrible problem. When I finally had my lashes back, I loved using mascara. However, when I went to remove it, about three eyelashes always fell out on each side and, man oh man, it was FRUSTRATING. This stuff really helped strengthen my eyelashes and they don't ever fall out outside of their natural cycle. I've also noticed the hair tends to grow back faster and the serum never hurts (even if I accidentally get it in my eye). I also use it on my eyebrows :) Prices vary on location, but a tube is usually around $10 and I can get it to last a little over a month if I use it twice a day or over two months if I use it once a day.  If you wear mascara and it isn't one of your triggers, some mascaras come with Vitamin E and other helpful ingredients in them: such as Maybelline Full 'N Soft or L'Oreal Healthy Length or Healthy Volume (the first two are very soft and don't get those mascara bumps but the healthy volume does feel a little more bumpy and probably has a higher chance of being a trigger, if that's a concern).  Disclaimer: please don't try to hasten re-growth if you're still pulling often. It will only damage the follicles further and bring you closer to the threshold of the hair never growing back. Rare pulling is alright, but I couldn't suggest hastening re-growth in good conscience if it was going to be worse off in the long run. Edit: paragraph breaks"

Being female, I tend to pull at my eyebrows and eyelashes and like you, it always starts innocently enough with grooming or rubbing my eyes from my allergies.  My triggers are stress and boredom, so my therapist suggested trying to retrain my hands to do something else when I feel the urge to pull... Squeezing a stress ball, playing with a rubber band or paper clip, etc. I've only been trying the stress ball for a week or so but it seems to be helping so far!"
Trichsters,1g9dmz,historygirl82,1 point,Thu Jun 13 11:43:09 2013 UTC,"Boredom is the other major trigger for me, too. A stress ball is a great idea - I have ADD and never fully outgrew my childhood fidgetiness. Idle hands are the Devil's plaything, as they say.    If anything good has come from this, it's helped to give me some insight into the thought process of addicts who feel compelled to do something bad for them for a quick rush.    Here's a pic of today's damage, in the lower left. Nothing too major, but still a sign of a problem. I think I'm going to keep this photo and look at it whenever I feel like pulling."
Trichsters,1g9dmz,diadexus,3,Thu Jun 13 14:05:08 2013 UTC,"If you're anything like me, the difficulty in stopping the pulling is correlated to the feeling of the actual pull.  The sensation of the hair follicle coming out is a ""relieving"" feeling for you, helping relieve some of that tension and stress you're experiencing.  In the last two months, I've started a new job (my current one was really awful, and I didn't realize just how bad it had gotten until a few weeks into my new position).  I've also been getting bi-weekly professional massages.  My super supportive boyfriend moved in three weeks ago, helping out around the house, and getting rid of those stressors.  Since all of this, I've noticed my pulling has significantly decreased.    So, while the next two weeks may really suck for you, try not to beat yourself up too much about the pulling; the self-loathing will only make it worse.  Instead, after the portfolio is done and over with, try to concentrate on removing the stressors in your life, or finding ways to deal with them better.  For me, it was getting rid of my awful job, adding the professional massages, and having my boyfriend cook healthy meals for me.  I often wonder how closely related trichotillomania is with Body Dismorphic Disorder ..  Hang in there, buddy."
Trichsters,1g9dmz,Bread_Heads,1 point,Thu Jun 13 13:22:28 2013 UTC,"Yes, the addiction definitely centers around that feeling of relief. It's the split second of pain, those few seconds of numbness, and then those first few seconds of touching the plucked area. You hit the nail on the head.    But then I inevitably find another one, and I can't stop thinking about it and tugging at it. So I zone out for half an hour or so, and the next thing I know, there's a pile of two dozen beard hairs on the table. It's like an addictive high that only lasts 5-10 seconds.    I've read a little about body dysmorphic disorder, but somehow never consciously made the connection to trichotillomania. Looks like I have some reading to do.

Trichsters,1g9dmz,stubby_g3,2,Thu Jun 13 14:31:32 2013 UTC,"Hey there! I'm also in grad school, and also suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and mild depression, and of course, trich! Good to meet you!  My trich, like the others who have already commented, is related to stress and boredom, and since I've been at it for a number of years, simple habit. As historygirl82 suggests, and as my counsel suggested, finding a physical substitute for your hands to play with can be very helpful. I have some thin wires that are coated in plastic and are very malleable. I would take those to class and play with them during seminars to keep my hands busy, or during conferences when I have to sit for long periods of time. I've never been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, but I am quite fidgety (always bouncing my legs, playing with my hands, etc.), but since you've mentioned that you have ADD, finding a ""toy"" to play with would probably help. Silly putty has also been suggested to me.  As a grad student, you probably (if you're anything like me) consume a lot of caffeine. I find that I have to watch my caffeine consumption because if I'm highly caffeinated, that can contribute to my urge to pull. So if you like to have some coffee/black tea/Redbull while you're working, you might want to pay attention to your pulling frequency when you're caffeinated, just to see if that could be contributing to the problem.  The other day I read this post and have found that the technique the OP suggests has been very helpful for me for the last few days. I find that making an exaggerated pulling/jerking motion with my arm makes me more aware of what I'm doing, as I often pull without even thinking about it. It also kind of feels good to make a hard pulling motion because it almost feels as though I'm releasing some pent-up energy in my arm. Granted, I've been doing this in the privacy of my home and not in public, so I can make the motion as silly looking or dramatic as I want :)  One last suggestion--as a student at my university, I have free access to counselors/therapists. If you're not already seeing someone and you have such an option at your uni, it might be a good idea to talk to someone trained in behavior modification.  I hope some of these ideas help! Best of luck to you!"

Trichsters,1g8c0b,fingerpies,3,Thu Jun 13 00:13:59 2013 UTC,"Absolutely.  And though I've controlled my pulling fairly well these days, it is still indulgently satisfying to pluck the stray hairs in my eyebrows, and it's sometimes difficult to not just keep plucking."

Trichsters,1g8c0b,pantherwest,5,Thu Jun 13 03:39:04 2013 UTC,"No. I can't tweeze or wax my eyebrows for the life of me but I can pull and pull and pull from my head without any pain whatsoever. I realized this very early on (I only pull from the head). I've even 'tested' whether or not it's just because I'm pulling singular hairs, but I've literally had babies and adults grab handfuls of my hair and yank HARD (enough to pull my head to the ground in the case of one particular toddler and enough to make other adults nearby squeal for me because they assumed it was hurting me) and I've never experienced any pain whatsoever.  I don't know if it's because I have trich or because I had a lot of bad perms as a toddler that burned me (I can stand home perms too when a lot of people think they burn; same with bleaches) but I definitely don't experience any pain when it comes to my scalp.  The hairs tend to literally slide right out with the root every time. I don't know what it is. I almost wish it DID hurt so maybe I'd be less inclined to pull? Who knows."
Trichsters,1g8c0b,PresidentRaggy,3,Thu Jun 13 04:02:08 2013 UTC,"Sometimes, depending on the place. But eyelashes/brows and the like rarely hurt."
Trichsters,1g8c0b,StrangeQuark1,3,Wed Jun 12 23:55:44 2013 UTC,"It used to hurt (eyebrows and eyelashes).  Now, not so much.  More of an anxious, pleasure release.  The NAC I take dulls the pleasure, so it just feels like I'm pulling something out and not getting anything from it haha.  It is a good pain tho, when it hurts.  But I haven't pulled my eyelashes in a week! Yay!"
Trichsters,1g8f67,halooney,3,Thu Jun 13 00:07:50 2013 UTC,"When I read about people going through it for years, it breaks my heart. It is really a big, hard to kill monster, isn't it? I don't know if I'm too bad. Let me tell you my case. I am a 25 year old guy. I remember the day I discovered you could pull out your hairs, but I don't know when it was. I do remember though, I had just shaved, I must have been around 17. I looked at myself at the mirror a while after, and I hadn't shaved one annoying hair in the middle of my face. I wished I was home to shave it but I wasn't, and I don't know how or why I tried to pull from it, but I remember I was very surprised when it came out. It wasn't a problem there though. The first time I have the memory of being conscious about it, I was at a very sedentary and idle job at a small hotel's receptions desk, at about 20. I honestly don't think it had been going on for long, it feels like it was quite recent. But once it started it never stopped. I pull hairs from my beard, almost exclusively. I like feeling my face after shaving and I always find a irregularity, no matter how I shave. It just feels such a damn pleasure to pull the longer-than-average motherfucker out. Fuck, as I write it I know I am so fucked up inside. Why can't I stop? What wire is loose inside of my head?  But...I don't know, what do you think? Am I a rally bad case? I have phases, I can sometimes go a few days, and once probably about a month, not too long ago, when I first know it had name, but after that I've never had the will to try seriously again. It really creeps me that I get to do it in public, nonworriedly, secretly grasping desperately with my nails to the notion it might be not noticeable. True is that nobody has ever made much reference to it, but it doesn't escape me that it might feel too weird for them to talk about. On bad days, it can be horribly evident, but I desperately look around to see if anyone's looking at me but they aren't. Still, I hurt myself, always getting to a new milestone of an uglier and bigger scar, so through this path it will be too evident at some point. One thing that gives me hope, is that I've managed to keeps the habit to beard hairs exclusively, and mainly from certain well-established areas. I did try some other places on occasions, like one time I pulled from my chest. But luckily, they just didn't feel so good, although I enjoyed the outing. By the way, I also peel the skin of my lips, when it's dry and cracky. Not as often, but definitely too much. I guess it's the same demon?   If there's anyone who read until here, I'm already immensely thankful. In any case, it's the first time I tell a recount of my problem, and it sure felt really good. I'm afraid fear paralizes me to tell it in the real world =/"
Trichsters,1g8f67,RationalMonkey,1 point,Thu Jun 13 00:36:03 2013 UTC,"Hi, I'm also a facial hair puller.  I started when I was 19. I was standing in front of the bathroom mirror and I saw a pair of tweezers on the counter and next thing I know, I've cleared half my chin. The years since then have been a cycle of trichotillomania leading to ingrown hairs leading to dermatillomania etc etc.  But now I'm 26 and I haven't pulled obsessively in almost 6 months! I still pull the occasional hair, but it's not the old situation where I would suddenly look down and my desk/book/keyboard would be covered in little hairs. These days if I pull it's one ""loose"" hair every few days.  Now this might not be a solution for everyone, but I can control it because I funnelled that OCD grooming energy into growing and maintaining a beard. Now I obsessively trim and maintain my beard and play with it constantly but pulling out hair becomes something negative."

Trichsters,1fywsz,swim13,3,Sun Jun 9 14:32:35 2013 UTC,"The side where I pulled the worst still isn't fully healed. The hair is much coarser, darker, and has a higher porosity. It's a lot better than it used to be though; they used to be so weak, you could very very lightly tug and they'd come out. So long as its still actually growing back, I bet they'll heal in time."

Trichsters,1fywsz,Bread_Heads,2,Sun Jun 9 14:43:23 2013 UTC,"The bit about not dwelling on mistakes is especially important I feel. That only causes more anxiety and leads to the dark side. Focus on what you can accomplish from the present forward, or how far you have come overall.  I haven't done exactly what you're describing, but one of the most effective things for me has been replacing pulling with twirling. I always keep a nice long lock of hair near the front of my face out of my ponytail for twirling. I think habit replacement works so well because it's much easier to divert enough willpower to alter your fingers motion to do something a little different than trying to avoid touching your hair altogether.  Congratulations on your progress!"
Trichsters,1fywsz,Bread_Heads,1 point,Sat Jun 15 16:44:14 2013 UTC,"Thanks for sharing this--I'm going to start doing this! I haven't been pulling for as long as you (about 3.5 years now), and I'm really nervous about the quality of my hair as it starts to grow back. It sounds like from your other comments that your hair went from being quite fine to being more coarse. Is it now more like your hair that you didn't pull? Is it blending in well? I'm really looking forward to being able to go to the hair stylist again instead of trimming my own hair. Also, is your hair able to grow long? I used to keep my hair longish, and while it was never really thick, it looked pretty good. I'm afraid that my hair will be too weak or thin to grow very long or that it will be very thin and limp."
Trichsters,1fywsz,Bread_Heads,2,Sun Jun 9 21:17:48 2013 UTC,"I've always had pretty thick hair, and the side where I pulled less was just like the side that's still healing, but it slowly became the same thickness and consistency as everything else, and really soft :) The new growth on the still healing side is not a good coarse, imo. However, the hair shaft toward the root does feel a bit different from the hair shaft toward the tips. Good news, it seems as though it is getting better. Genetics plays a part in how much someone can pull before hair will quite growing back, however, it still takes quite a long time. I pulled for years (13) with very rare healing periods of maybe 3 months maximum (when I was littler and somehow managed to fight it off for a bit). I imagine someone could do permanent damage, but again, I have a hunch it would take quite a bit of aggressive pulling for very long amounts of time. I have curly hair and the new stuff is insanely curlier, the curls are so tight and do not stayed straightened for long. (I recently gave up any damaging heat to help hair growth; trying to embrace my curls and /r/curlyhair helps :) it doesn't look bad however and I think it does blend well. The stuff under my ears was worse, but is mostly covered by other hair. The stuff above my forehead was just kind of weak and thin at first and healed really quickly. I've never had my hair long, and that's my first new goal with my hair :) I imagine if the follicle is really weak, it may drop the hair if its too much weight for it to hold, but the follicle would have to be pretty damaged like mine were.  My eyelashes were really weak at first and would fall out when I removed mascara (even when I was being gentle! I was verry frustrated). However, I started putting this per the counter formula stuff on them and it helped strengthen them and they are back to how they used to be :) I had no noticeable difference in eyebrow health.  If you want, I can get on a computer and tell you how I tell scalp follicle health with some sources."

If there's anybody who shouldn't think it's ""gross,"" it's trichsters.  Noting when you pull and avoiding it as often as possible is the key. Find something else to do with your hands - a fiddle toy, the fringe of a scarf, anything. Chew gum. Tap your fingernails on a flat surface.   And honestly, as someone like you whose pulling is not so out of control that it changes my appearance, sometimes I just pull/chew anyways. There are times when I've just GOT to do it and trying to avoid it will make the difference between pulling 2 hairs and pulling 20. Being  comfortable with the idea that I pull my hair has been the best thing for reducing pulling so far (20+ years of pulling under my belt.)"
Trichsters,1fvhki,PredictableChick,1 point,Fri Jun 7 21:27:42 2013 UTC,"Set realistic goals for yourself and don't feel ashamed. It sounds like you're a pretty functional trichster. You're not eating the full hair so there are unlikely to be many negative health consequences. You're not pulling enough to alter your appearance. Absolutely seek help for the underlying causes such as anxiety & boredom etc. but please don't ever think that there's anything wrong with you. Think of it as a variation of normal and a coping technique that you've used to get through whatever you've gone through (you mentioned other issues?). Your survival techniques have got you to the point where you are now and while they might not be something that you like- they've worked, you're here now.  For myself, by going through treatment and life changes to address the underlying causes that were making me pull to the point where my appearance was being drastically altered (to where I shaved my head on more than one occasion etc.)- I've progressed to becoming a 'functional' puller where I have a ponytail for the first time since I was 12. That was my goal. Am I pull free? No. But I forgive myself because I still met my goal. Be kind to yourself."

I remember thinking ""oh no, what if it hurts this bad forever!""  I had a blanket that I was born with and picked to pieces that I would then cuddle against my nose and suck my thumb. I believe that when I outgrew the blanket I started picking elsewhere for comfort.  I'd like to see more studies done on very early development and trich.  I start pulling hair around 1st grade and continued through until highschool. I stopped then, and resumed in college. I still pull today at age 29."

Trichsters,1ex633,LinkFixerBot,3,Thu May 23 21:38:48 2013 UTC,"I use falsies when my lashes are too patchy to ""hide"". A lot of women I know are scared to put them on themselves, but I promise with a little bit of practice, they are quite easy to apply! They can even look very natural if you pick shorter ones and add mascara over them to bond with your own lashes. I also do a small line of black liquid liner over the base of the falsies to cover the excess glue and the dotted look the base can sometimes have. Good luck!"
Trichsters,1ex633,imtallerthanyou,2,Thu May 23 23:32:34 2013 UTC,"I stick to black eyeliner. I use eye shadow like normal, and line my eyes with black liner. Depending on my mood, I'll either go lite or heavy. I've been on an upper lid only kick, with a slight wing. I also always use mascara, even when I have literally 1 or 2 lashes left. I dab the mascara over the liner to make it appear like lashes."
Trichsters,1ex633,adellaguardia,2,Thu May 23 23:03:02 2013 UTC,"This is what I do when I have patches missing from my eyelashes. I do my makeup just like normal, put on mascara, and wait for my lashes to become somewhat tacky. I then take tweezers and carefully stick two eyelashes from the sides of the patch together in the middle. That way the patch isn't half as noticeable, because at least there's two lashes there sticking together to form one."
Trichsters,1ex633,Nickilette,2,Fri May 24 04:14:40 2013 UTC,"I use a dark brown eyeliner, because that's closer to the color of my eyelashes than black. For patches in my eyebrows I've found an eyeshadow color that I can brush in using a cheap, stiff, thin eye makeup brush to make the patches less noticeable and give a smoother shape to my eyebrows. I go with the ""less is more"" motto, try to keep it looking natural. Stand back a bit while applying so you're getting the overall effect when looking in the mirror. I only apply these when I'm wearing regular eye makeup too. I swear by Urban Decay's eyeshadow primer."
Trichsters,1ex633,lizzyshoe,2,Fri May 24 04:38:50 2013 UTC,"Black eyeliner (just on the top lids) and normal eyeshadow.  Dark brown shadow to line the lower lids instead of eyeliner, seems to create an illusion of eyelashes.  I don't do mascara because it irritates my eyes and just draws my fingers in, but whatever works for you.  If you do wear mascara, try getting a lash comb to separate and arrange eyelashes."
Trichsters,1ex633,snuggle-butt,1 point,Wed Jun 12 00:29:20 2013 UTC,"I tend to go for an over-the-top, borderline theatrical look, but I find that wearing false eyelashes helps curb the pulling. You definitely have to wear makeup with them, though."
Trichsters,1ex633,arwenface,1 point,Thu May 23 23:45:01 2013 UTC,"I usually just stick to black eyeliner.  I have oily, hooded lids, so I need stuff that STAYS WHERE I PUT IT!  NARS smudgeproof primer is THE BEST at doing this.  With the primer, my favorite eyeliner is L'Oreal infallible gel liner.  Without the primer, my favorite liner is Urban Decay 24/7 liquid liner in Perversion (pricer, but that stuff stays very well).  I rarely wear mascara because   1) I rarely have enough lashes to put it on and   2) it makes me want to pull my lashes out more because of the texture and the itchyness/dryness.  If you only have a few gaps, then falsies would cover that up nicely. I personally don't wear them because they're difficult to apply on bare lids and I'm sensitive to the glue."
Trichsters,1ex633,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Sat May 25 03:48:10 2013 UTC,Hi im a makeup addict and Trichotillomaniac for about 8 years now... i know a few good fix-its and tips to help improve the look of spacers and bald spots... AMA (:
Trichsters,1eud5o,riss3r,4,Wed May 22 16:46:12 2013 UTC,"I started like this at 5 or 6, right after my parents divorced and my mother and I moved into a trailer. I think anxiety triggers it. I picked at my leg and arm hair. Eventually I just kinda zoned out while I was doing it and I picked out all of my eyelashes. When my anxiety peaked (puberty/middle-school) I started picking at my scalp and ended up half-bald. With the scalp picking, it was at first due to dandruff, then I started picking big chunks of dead skin off. My scalp tingled wherever it needed picked, and eventually the tingle/itchy feeling got so intense the only thing that relieved it (I tried anti-drandruff shampoos, scalpicin, hot oil treatments, prescription shampoos) was physically injuring myself by picking the dead skin off entirely or pulling out my hair a strand at a time  so that the bulb was out. I eventually found out that the bulb appears to be the source of the tingling/itchy feeling.   As of right now (age 25) I don't have any bald patches, but my hair is of uneven lengths.   It's gradual."
Trichsters,1eud5o,chinchillazilla54,3,Wed May 22 19:55:29 2013 UTC,"My dad said to me when I was about eleven, ""Wow, your eyebrows are really bushy!"" As a bullied girl, I thought, man, if even my dad thinks my eyebrows are bushy, maybe that's why people pick on me!   So I started trying to shape them, but I had no idea how. I would go too far on one side, so I'd have to pull out a bunch on the other side to even them up.  It might have ended there, I dunno, but then my parents split up and my anxiety went through the roof. I pulled out all my eyebrows and eyelashes and moved on to my scalp. As you might imagine, the bullying did not improve.  Now, I'm 23, and I'm... I don't want to say over it, because I still pull, but I manage it. I mostly pull hair from my legs and arms instead of places where it'll look bad. And I sometimes will take out half an eyelid's worth of lashes, but that hasn't happened for over a year now."
Trichsters,1eud5o,Lexahkiin,3,Thu May 23 03:39:20 2013 UTC,"I forgot to mention that I like the feeling of pulling the root out when picking but I don't always get the sensation when I pull the root/hair out.  The stinging sensations feels good to me which might sound strange. When i'm in my picking fits I don't stop until I get the ""right"" pull meaning the good sensation and the root."
Trichsters,1eud5o,helix19,2,Thu May 23 17:08:43 2013 UTC,"I didn't notice at all until my mum commented on how my eyelashes had thinned out. At one point I got stressed in her presence and unconsciously pulled at my eyelashes -- then everytime it happened again, she'd scold me, which alerted me to the problem. I knew it wasn't normal as soon as other people told me it wasn't...but really, I didn't notice I was doing it at all until I was told.  It must've been happening for weeks until I noticed, maybe even longer, but it all started when my life got more stressful than usual, with emotional abuse type stuff going on. It's gotten to the point where it seems I have no eyelashes, they're that far-gone.   I do find things to keep my mind occupied now, though, so I pull alot less -- especially as I now have someone in my life that makes me really happy. :)"
Trichsters,1eud5o,pseudoscienceoflove,2,Thu May 23 00:08:07 2013 UTC,"I'm a Derminator, but I've picked consistently since puberty. Some periods of time are a little worse, but I think it's more dependent on what's already on my skin to pick at than anything else. Before puberty that I think it cycled, but I don't remember very well."
Trichsters,1eud5o,diadexus,1 point,Thu May 23 04:05:29 2013 UTC,"I definitely enjoyed pulling my hair out before it became a diagnosable problem.  I pulled strands of hair out and tested how ""stretchy"" they were when I was bored in class.  I remember someone telling me that you grew five eyelashes a day, so I limited myself to ONLY five eyelashes a day.  Pulling my hair out wasn't a problem.  I just fidgeted a lot, and hair-pulling felt nice.  Then, when I was twelve, BAM, one bad night I pulled all of my eyelashes out.  Since then, it's been a cycle between okay, and ohmygodimhairless.  For reference, I'm an eyelash-eyebrow puller, but it's worse with my eyelashes."

Trichsters,1epl00,Ihearthuckabees,3,Mon May 20 21:53:40 2013 UTC,"Thank you! The things that have been helping me this time are:  1) Trying to be really self aware. A couple months ago I started keeping a spreadsheet and listing how many times I pulled each day, and I think it's finally paying off. 2) Distractions. I have a hacky sack at my desk to pay with now. 3) Tape - it's super annoying, but on days when I feel stressed I've been preemptively putting tape on my thumb so I can't easily pull with it.  I hope some of these can work for others!"
Trichsters,1epl00,suddenly_pants,3,Tue May 21 14:48:08 2013 UTC,"I am not the OP, but she used my account to reply to comments accidentally. Just wanted to say that she has now blown past 50 days without pulling and is well into 60.  If she can do it, so can you!"
Trichsters,1epl00,suddenly_pants,2,Wed Jun 26 23:56:12 2013 UTC,"You are amazing!!! This is not an arbitrary milestone by any means! I hope you're proud of yourself, because this random internet stranger surely is!"

If we have anything else in common besides our condition, then it's either finals week for you or it just passed. If that's the case, I'm very interested in any tips you might have to offer, especially during times of high stress.  Keep it up!"
Trichsters,1epl00,suddenly_pants,2,Tue May 21 12:30:16 2013 UTC,"Fortunately I'm beyond the phase of life with finals, but that just means I moved on to the phase of life with quarterly deadlines. In either case, I've noticed that when I'm really stressed I tend to put treating trich as a lower priority and let things slide. Recently I've been trying to tell myself that trich is important and it's OK to spend time on it (for me, this means walking away from work for 5 minutes if I notice myself starting to touch my eyebrows or lashes). It takes a little time away for studying, but the pays off when I don't have a time-consuming breakdown later in the day.  Good luck!"
Trichsters,1epl00,terrevasts,1 point,Tue May 21 14:53:19 2013 UTC,"Hahaha, I understand.  That's an interesting tactic, allotting yourself a certain amount of time to pull.  I'm not really sure if I have the self control to try that.  I feel like it will just turn into another episode.  At least you've found something that works for you!"
Trichsters,1enyms,helix19,5,Mon May 20 01:02:32 2013 UTC,"Wow, this is really interesting. Thanks for doing this. I was wondering if I was the only Derminator hanging around here, guess not!"

Trichsters,1enyms,EtherBvnny,2,Mon May 20 01:03:30 2013 UTC,I'd love to see a graph similar to last year's that shows the overlap of where people pull from.  I thought that one was particularly interesting.

Trichsters,1ej49v,fingerpies,1 point,Fri May 17 18:04:02 2013 UTC,"WELCOME! I'm also currently in recovery. And it's actually helped me to think of trich as another addiction. Obviously there are a ton of differences and the analogy will fall apart, but what's interesting, is that treating trich recovery, like drug/alcohol recovery, is actually a pretty effective method. Check out this lady's website. I've had to learn to accept my trich, and not let myself get super worked up over it. Reading through old posts here, you'll find a TON of information.   Welcome again!"
Trichsters,1ej49v,karoop,1 point,Fri May 17 19:34:53 2013 UTC,"I personally have only had to fight nicotine and alcohol addictions so I can't really relate, but comparing even to these two common problems, fighting trich (I used to pull from my beard) was very easy once I realised that I wasn't alone.  I'm still on /r/Trichsters because I feel that I haven't recovered completely and I feel that my hands still want to do this, but now that I see that I managed to consciously stop it for a while with just knowing that other people are going through similar or worse fight, I hope that one day I will be able to become completely free - and I wish you the same!

Trichsters,1eec9p,steelcitykid,2,Wed May 15 18:34:45 2013 UTC,"I was in CBT therapy for several years (mostly for other issues, but we addressed my trich as well). It helped immensely. My therapist was wonderful and I was able to reduce my pulling quite a bit... not as much as I'd've hoped, but still. Sessions were usually about 30 minutes to an hour. I had to stop going because I could no longer afford transportation to and from my therapists' office, but if it were an option then I would've definitely kept going.  I absolutely recommend giving it a shot, but keep in mind that your experience will depend entirely on finding a therapist you mesh well with. That can take a lot of trial and error. Check out this list of trich specialists for a good starting point."
Trichsters,1eec9p,felicitations,1 point,Thu May 16 01:14:08 2013 UTC,"I didn't find it helpful, despite the fact I love my therapist and find CBT useful in other aspects of my life. I've been in therapy a long time, seeing my usual therapist weekly for years and other counselors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and so forth many, many times. I feel I've got a good understanding of the benefits and limitations of therapy. CBT may be able to help with your trich, but don't expect a miracle."
Trichsters,1eec9p,helix19,2,Thu May 16 16:24:36 2013 UTC,I had a great experience with it; it helped me greatly reduce my pulling and I've since stopped wearing wigs :)
Trichsters,1eec9p,clothesgirl,2,Thu May 16 04:32:00 2013 UTC,"CBT is the first line of action that is taken for someone with trichotillomania. It has a greater pulling reduction than using pharmaceuticals, and it healthier in the long run. I would personally recommend it as I've seen the positive effects. Sessions time will vary based on the individual, but the first step is to make the patient aware that they are pulling, and this may take some time. The next step is to use habit reversal training. All the while they should be helping you in other ways (i.e., emotional/mental). That's a pretty broad explanation though.."

Trichsters,1e5r2q,Dark_star07,2,Sun May 12 01:09:00 2013 UTC,"The easiest way I've found is to simply shave your head bald. Obviously, not everyone wants to do this, so I'm not pushing it as the only solution period. Trying to keep your hands busy is usually helpful, and (for me) the scratching like you mentioned in the comments actually helps. It redirects the impulse somewhat, and calls my attention to whatever place ""itches"", hopefully before I pull there. Knowing when the impulse is coming on is far better than ""finding out"" halfway through a new bald spot."

Trichsters,1e5r2q,Cruxie,2,Sun May 12 03:10:44 2013 UTC,"Yeah anything to keep my hands free, I dunno, the more I think about it now, it's really the feeling of the hair pulling free (burning/stinging in a small pinhole concentration) that I like...

Trichsters,1e3xjr,UsernameSoFunny,2,Sat May 11 07:58:26 2013 UTC,Had eyeliner applied a couple years ago and have never regretted it.  I chose a medium/thin line which is perfect for most days. For a night out I can add a thicker line or alternative colors with regular eyeliner.  The process took a few hours and a couple of appointments and hurt like hell but I got over it. It was worth every minute and every penny.

Trichsters,1e0s0s,_Action_Bastard,3,Thu May 9 20:34:35 2013 UTC,BAM I just wrote you a message detailing how this was a great idea  YOU'RE SO ON TOP OF THINGS! you're the best!!
Trichsters,1e0s0s,whovianinthetardis,3,Thu May 9 21:06:51 2013 UTC,"Haha yaaayyy! I tried to use similar questions to what you did last time, and I looked up the old suggestions too, and then I added some."
Trichsters,1e0s0s,Aldairion,1 point,Thu May 9 21:29:44 2013 UTC,"Just filled it out, looking forward to the results!"
Trichsters,1e0s0s,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Thu May 9 20:43:36 2013 UTC,Done.
Trichsters,1e0s0s,clothesgirl,1 point,Thu May 9 22:53:17 2013 UTC,I am newish to this sub. Took the survey. It would be cool to see results :-)
Trichsters,1e11or,Sallysaurus,2,Thu May 9 21:52:44 2013 UTC,"I don't have a specific product, but would a small ball maze toy (something like this) work?  I see them in dollar stores all the time, they're very cheap, and the metal ball rolling around makes a nice racket.  I'm not sure what to suggest for noise-making.. clicking a pen?  Do you play any instruments, maybe?  My sister actually got me a ukulele for this reason. (random, possibly crazy idea - castanets?  I've never actually used them, but they are basically tiny finger cymbals, and there's some pretty cheap plastic ones on Amazon.)  I hope you can find something that works well for you!"
Trichsters,1e11or,myaltacctisthisone,1 point,Thu May 9 23:34:02 2013 UTC,"Thanks, I'm actually looking for something with parts that I can physically fiddle with, and can't be doing that with my guitar in the middle of lectures etc ;P that maze toy might not be a bad idea for times when I can focus on a distraction. This needs to be something I can do absentmindedly, if that makes sense?"
Trichsters,1e11or,myaltacctisthisone,2,Thu May 9 23:37:21 2013 UTC,"Oh, gotcha.  In that case.. I usually end up fiddling with rings, hairties on my wrist (you can take them off and knot/un-knot them, too), pushing the lead in and out of mechanical pencils, stuff like that."
Trichsters,1dysfb,gillyboatbruff,2,Wed May 8 23:40:18 2013 UTC,"ACRYLIC NAILS.  Brilliant.  I was on the verge of getting hipster glasses that covered my eyelashes and eyebrows, taking the chance that no one would take me seriously ever again."
Trichsters,1dysfb,pseudoscienceoflove,2,Thu May 9 01:09:26 2013 UTC,"If you try it, let me know how it goes.  I'm wondering if someone who pulls out eyelashes needs their fingernails to do it or not.  With shaving every day, fingernails are pretty much a necessity to pull my hair out.  But hipster glasses....you must be desperate.  :)"
Trichsters,1dysfb,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Thu May 9 01:51:21 2013 UTC,I do need my fingernails to pull... but I'm thinkin' that fake ones might make the task more difficult (hopefully).  Yes.  Yes I am. ;)
Trichsters,1dysfb,TylerKnowy,3,Thu May 9 02:06:35 2013 UTC,I do not know how you guys can keep track of the hairs you pull...
Trichsters,1dysfb,DarthVaderette,2,Thu May 9 18:38:51 2013 UTC,"My problem was I would pick at the acrylics instead. Add some oily nail beds in and they don't last more than 5-7 days on me even without picking at them. So in addition to having bald spots, I'd have ripped up nails too. But yes, it is harder to pick with acrylics, but a determined tritcher WILL find a way unfortunately."
Trichsters,1dysfb,TicaVerde,1 point,Thu May 9 01:01:53 2013 UTC,"I like that idea. Take the choice out of pulling, and it becomes easier to stop."
Trichsters,1dysfb,StrangeQuark1,0,Wed May 8 23:47:49 2013 UTC,That's the way that works best for me. I just find it demoralizing because it means that I don't have the willpower to stop by myself and that I need an external mechanism to force me to stop.
Trichsters,1dysfb,TicaVerde,1 point,Thu May 9 06:42:46 2013 UTC,"But it was your willpower to put a stop to it. I see it as like a mental slap I'm giving myself to say ""ok this has to stop now""."
Trichsters,1dysfb,Kapowrinow1,1 point,Thu May 9 11:50:04 2013 UTC,I am on your exact page except i usually shave ever 2 or three days and cut my nails ever other day so i cant bite them and my hairs are so short i cant pull them out but ya i tried the acrylic but just not for me ... good luck
Trichsters,1dyqxn,chickadont,3,Wed May 8 23:21:30 2013 UTC,"Silly putty or playdough, or even kneaded erasers are good to play with!  Personally, I've started wearing rings and found that to be helpful, especially when I'm out and mushing putty around in my hands wouldn't go over well.  One of my favorites is a simple twisted band, which has texture to occupy my fingertips and I can twirl around discreetly.  I've also heard people suggest crafts such as knitting or crochet, which might be something you can do while watching movies, on the bus, etc."
Trichsters,1dyqxn,myaltacctisthisone,1 point,Thu May 9 00:38:02 2013 UTC,"I should bring some play doh from home (which I still have, untouched, for no apparent reason other than I love play doh and it smells awesome). I could probably leave it on my desk at home. Something that only requires one hand would be helpful cause usually I'm sitting here (like right now) typing and intermittently playing with my eyebrows."
Trichsters,1dyqxn,PretzelMeister,3,Thu May 9 13:56:12 2013 UTC,"I use a Tangle. I just wrap it around the hand I would use to pull my eyelashes or eyebrows, and I then I just fiddle with it. It's pretty fun, actually! I also crochet."
Trichsters,1dyqxn,fingerpies,1 point,Thu May 9 16:54:32 2013 UTC,"OH! That's what a tangle is! I saw a bunch of tumblr posts about tangles when I looked up the trichotillomania tag, and I had no idea what it was."
Trichsters,1dyqxn,fingerpies,2,Thu May 9 19:54:10 2013 UTC,I have a small beaded keychain that I've used. The beads are an interesting texture and it doesn't get boring.  EVERYTHING can be a tool. :)
Trichsters,1dyqxn,thatgirlsthings,2,Thu May 9 01:55:42 2013 UTC,I knit.
Trichsters,1dyqxn,cat-holic,1 point,Thu May 9 13:21:50 2013 UTC,it might not be exactly what you're looking for but I keep a bag of those flosser tools next to my bed so whenever I'm sitting here feeling anxious I will grab one and go to town. Then I have clean teeth! If the feeling passes... great.. otherwise.. yeah. Hope it helps.
Trichsters,1dyqxn,cat-holic,2,Thu May 9 00:46:39 2013 UTC,"I floss as it is...not a horrible idea, but I feel like it'd get unwieldy to be sitting at my desk or with my patients just flossing in the middle of a conversation haha. I feel like it's only something you'd do in private."
Trichsters,1dyqxn,GoSharkDogsGo,1 point,Thu May 9 13:53:28 2013 UTC,"agreed, there's no kind of personal grooming that's really appropriate in public. sometimes i twirl a pen when i'm talking to people but that probably also becomes annoying after i drop it the tenth time :)"
Trichsters,1dyqxn,_Action_Bastard,2,Thu May 9 15:09:15 2013 UTC,Me too! I taught myself how to twirl it in college and do that frequently...but also drop it a lot.
Trichsters,1dyqxn,_Action_Bastard,1 point,Thu May 9 20:57:27 2013 UTC,"I wear a ring constantly, so I can play with it / twirl it with my hands.  It's a little thing that isn't hard to always have on!"
Trichsters,1dyqxn,907WallFlower,1 point,Thu May 9 02:17:49 2013 UTC,I wear rings too...I probably need ones with better textures - can't really play with the two main ones I wear.
Trichsters,1dyqxn,oni_baloni,1 point,Thu May 9 13:54:21 2013 UTC,Are you in Chicago as well? I used to live near the Lakeshore learning center.  I try to tap the tips of my fingers with my thumb until the feeling passes...either that or I have to get out of the house.
Trichsters,1dyar7,Ipullfreely,8,Wed May 8 20:00:53 2013 UTC,"Whatever you do, don't let yourself think that you can pull just one. It's never just one and I've found that if I can hold myself off from the first one the urge eventually goes away but if I try to ""only pull one"" then it is downhill from there.  Also, using the HALT method works well for me. When you're having the urge to pull stop yourself and ask, am I hungry, angry, lonely, or tired (I also add in bored)? Sometimes the urge to pull comes out of one of those situations and by fixing that instead you will help lessen the urge.  Stick with it!! You can do it :)"
Trichsters,1dum37,KaylaAnne,1 point,Tue May 7 07:20:22 2013 UTC,I find that meds did not help me much. But maybe other people have better experiences? Have you tried shaving your hair?
Trichsters,1dum37,Compasguy,1 point,Tue May 7 08:30:50 2013 UTC,"I have thought about it, but I really want to avoid that. Its a serious step for me. Plus, I defiantly want a wig if I do that and I cant afford one at this moment. Another thing that holds me back is even if I get a wig (which I do want to anyway) I cant wear it all the time. I work in a kitchen and if I tried to wear a wig I would get heat stroke or something. But, all things considered, shaving is tempting some days..."
Trichsters,1dum37,steelcitykid,1 point,Tue May 7 08:43:08 2013 UTC,I take anti-depressants. It does absolutely nothing for my trich. I've also tried anti-anxiety meds to some lesser extent and had a bad reaction to them.
Trichsters,1dum37,helix19,1 point,Tue May 7 11:50:11 2013 UTC,"I'm not really a Trichster, I'm a Derminator. I've been on every antidepressant, anti-anxiety, mood stabilizer, you name it. None really helped me, but I've heard they can be helpful to some people."
Trichsters,1dum37,diadexus,1 point,Tue May 7 15:30:10 2013 UTC,"As people have said, the effectiveness of medication for trich definitely varies from person to person. SSRI's did nothing for me and the side effects were so bad that I chose not to seek further medication."
Trichsters,1dum37,gillyboatbruff,1 point,Tue May 7 16:13:02 2013 UTC,"Tried an anti-depressant but had a nasty reaction to it.  NAC helped.  Also, lowering stress levels (new job, bi-monthly professional massage) and exercise has significantly reduced my pulling."
Trichsters,1dum37,zulofritter,1 point,Tue May 7 17:53:42 2013 UTC,Meds haven't helped me stop pulling at all.
Trichsters,1dum37,chickadont,1 point,Tue May 7 18:47:01 2013 UTC,"It can help, but it's not a silver bullet. You need a comprehensive strategy."
Trichsters,1dum37,fazalazim,1 point,Tue May 7 19:39:21 2013 UTC,"Doesn't work. I was depressed bc I had trich, not the other way around."
Trichsters,1dum37,fazalazim,1 point,Tue May 7 23:19:28 2013 UTC,"I started taking zoloft recently for some underlying anxiety and my doc wants to keep upping my dosage slowly to see if it'll help the trich/derm. Problem is, as my therapist agreed, i enjoy the feeling of rubbing/picking so it's really difficulty to stop..I currently just went up to 100 mg. No change in my trich yet."
Trichsters,1drgzy,PretzelMeister,4,Mon May 6 00:48:41 2013 UTC,"Join ussssss!  I had to go through the whole senior portrait thing pretty recently, and I wish you luck.  I highly recommend that you subscribe to /r/makeupaddiction.  Even though the sub isn't specific to trich, they really helped me improve my makeup routine.  I've since learned how to do my eyebrows better, encouraged me to try winged liner, and I'm currently seeking help with false lashes for my graduation.  Also... see if you can schedule your senior portraits later in the summer, so there's time for you to try regrowing them at least a bit.  Summertime is about the only time I am able to regrow my lashes, and I'm not sure whether or not your trich follows the same pattern."
Trichsters,1drgzy,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Mon May 6 01:01:29 2013 UTC,"I shall! Ah! This subreddit will definitely help me. I usually don't wear makeup (because I'm too lazy), but I'm thinking about experimenting with it this summer. I did buy some eyebrow liner for prom, but I think it's a lighter brown than my eyebrows actually are. I guess mistakes are a way of learning, though. :) I have until August 31 to get my senior portraits done, so I think I have plenty of time. I also have a whole bottle of almond oil that I think I'll start using on my eyelashes and eyebrows. I had used it earlier and it helped them grow faster (unless it's just a placebo)."
Trichsters,1drgzy,skamnorth,2,Mon May 6 01:10:39 2013 UTC,"Hair typically grows faster during summertime too, and luckily the eyebrows and eyelashes doesn't take that long (although it feels like forever) before you can start doing some really neat tricks with make-up."
Trichsters,1drgzy,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Mon May 6 02:40:22 2013 UTC,Seriously.  A little bit of eyebrow makes filling them in so much easier and convincing.
Trichsters,1drgzy,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Mon May 6 03:03:29 2013 UTC,"I'm actually using vitamin-E oil on my eyebrows and eyelashes.  Actually, I've been using body oil all over my skin.  Even if it doesn't make my hair grow faster, it makes my skin feel niiiiiiice!"
Trichsters,1drgzy,pseudoscienceoflove,2,Mon May 6 01:13:30 2013 UTC,"I'll have to get some of that after my exams are done! A few weeks ago, I switched from using regular hand sanitizer to hand sanitizer that's also a lotion, and my hands are so soft now. They feel soft like a baby!"
Trichsters,1drgzy,WonTwoThree,1 point,Mon May 6 01:16:14 2013 UTC,"Niiiiice!  I'm thinking of switching from body oil to body lotion with SPF for the summer... because while my skin feels FANTASTIC, it won't after I get sunburnt.  I'll probs say hello to my body oil again in the winter."
Trichsters,1drgzy,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Mon May 6 01:23:08 2013 UTC,"Ah. Wise decision. I usually forget to put sunscreen on, so I get major sunburnt. Then I never leave the house again, hahah."
Trichsters,1drgzy,pseudoscienceoflove,1 point,Mon May 6 01:30:21 2013 UTC,"Hi back, welcome! I guess try to use those senior portraits as a way to stop yourself when you notice you're pulling, but don't beat yourself up too much if they're not great - you can always get a studio to do another portrait later."
Trichsters,1dny5u,pseudoscienceoflove,3,Sat May 4 05:11:04 2013 UTC,You look lovely :). And the last picture made me laugh :D...Big cheery grin and a thumbs up hahah :D

Very Doe Eyed :D  I usually use Duo; it's available at MAC, but it's used in the theater world to attach all kinds of hair- mustaches, hair pieces etc.  It's the most reliable glue I've used, and lasts a looong time."
Trichsters,1dny5u,clothesgirl,2,Sat May 4 19:39:07 2013 UTC,NICE!  How much does it cost?
Trichsters,1dn3ne,pseudoscienceoflove,2,Fri May 3 20:46:20 2013 UTC,Sounds like you're allergic to something in the lash glues.
Trichsters,1dn3ne,bearbuster,2,Fri May 3 20:52:17 2013 UTC,"Maybe, but I just wanted to give falsies another try before I just give up."
Trichsters,1dn3ne,BadW01fRose,2,Fri May 3 20:54:57 2013 UTC,"Most lash glues have latex in them, so you may have a latex sensitivity. Look for lash grips latex free formula :)"
Trichsters,1dn3ne,BadW01fRose,2,Fri May 3 21:43:59 2013 UTC,"How could I test out whether or not I have a latex problem?  I've never had latex gloves or the like bother me before. O.o  I'll certainly look for something latex free, though, to see if it works :)"
Trichsters,1dn3ne,ammcurious,2,Fri May 3 21:56:23 2013 UTC,"Your eyelids are very sensitive, I don't have a latex allergy, but my eyelids are sore after a few days of lash wear. Red and puffy. But a latex free alternative is great for sensitive skin. Check with sephora or Mac for a waterproof alt. The latex free stuff tends to be less waterproof"

Trichsters,1di27t,pinto761,6,Wed May 1 19:45:02 2013 UTC,"The problem with transplants is that its a temporary solution. Do you think you will be able to keep yourself from pulling them out again?   If you could save out some of the lashes, there's also the option of getting eyelash extensions to help you fill in the gaps and make them thicker. Not a permanent solution - but perhaps it can work as certain hairextensions do for those targeting the scalp. (They feel there's extensions there when the hands wander and so you catch yourself in doing what you shouldn't do)  I haven't done anything like it, but I know the UK actually have quite a lot of options for trichters (specialized haircare etc.) at least in comparison to the rest of Europe.   Hope you find a good option!"
Trichsters,1di27t,skamnorth,1 point,Thu May 2 01:11:15 2013 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to reply.  Unfortunately I do not have enough eyelashes that will grow to make extensions work no matter how long they are left for. I have a few on either side of my eyelids, and absolutely nothing in-between. This is the same for both the top and bottom of my eyelids.  I am very confident that I will not pull them out if I were to have the surgery, I just couldn't imagine putting myself through that all over again. It's not a decision I am taking lightly. I have recently contacted a surgeon here in the UK that specializes in this and currently waiting for a reply to get more facts about the procedure and all that it entails."
Trichsters,1df594,hairsofstromkirk,3,Tue Apr 30 16:52:15 2013 UTC,"i used to spend my days at school try to seach for every split end. i felt more accomplished the more id find and the higher i could split them. when i started using different hair products/got a much shorter hair cut, i started to actually pull them out much more, and then when i couldnt find split ends id find the thicker texture hairs ( or the way ones) and would pull those. but this consumed me, like you i would be engrossed and be zoned out. im trying hard to grow my hair out again, and i keep it up mostly, but then that brings attention back to partial hair strands or ones growing back that stick out, and i pull those.  now that im not in school and i work in a deli, my pulling my head hair has slowed down"
Trichsters,1df594,emylime,3,Tue Apr 30 23:10:52 2013 UTC,Good luck! I have a habit of pulling my split ends too.

Trichsters,1df594,SuddenlyBritish,0,Thu May 16 01:00:29 2013 UTC,The lip chewing thing immediately made me think of Tourette Syndrome. Do you think your behaviors could be tics?
Trichsters,1df594,helix19,1 point,Wed May 1 01:56:16 2013 UTC,I don't think so. Mostly because I've been able to battle the habits in the past. It's just this one has been here for the longest period of time yet. I'm pretty sure a relative of mine has a tic though.

My mother didn't wear make-up and I never had much interested in learning.  I really see this stuff as an acquired skill.  I love the way your eyes look in the last pic.  My eyelashes (and sometimes my eyebrows) are my main trich focus.  The sad thing is, I feel like I could beat the urge to pull, but my eyelashes always grow back in a weird way and I can't help but repull them because it's so irritating.    It's great to see tips like this, thank you so much!  I can't wait to try out these products :)"

Trichsters,1db1j9,theblogperson,2,Thu May 2 04:43:50 2013 UTC,"Another tip: Buy something that helps the makeup stay on during the day. It costs about $2 at Target, I forget what it's called, but it makes sure that everything stays intact for the entire day!"

Trichsters,1d9fm9,helix19,7,Sun Apr 28 07:00:38 2013 UTC,"Cognitive distortions are not a medical condition or psychiatric illness. You cannot be diagnosed with them. They are simply negative, unhealthy, unhelpful or illogical ways of thinking about things. I can't see any way they would be linked to trich more than adding to general anxiety and depression."
Trichsters,1d9fm9,idiosyncrassy,3,Sun Apr 28 07:25:59 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say that there's a certain amount of cognitive distortion involved. Historically, I always felt an excessive amount of secrecy and shame about it, like trich was a SUPER WEIRD THING TO DO THAT MUST BE HIDDEN AND NEVER SPOKEN OF, lest someone call me out on it. And the shame game would make pulling worse, and harder to deal with, etc.   I realized that the shame game and denial was keeping me from treating my pulling periods practically, which was dumb. It's like, if you had frequent headaches, you would feel one coming on be like, ""Oh shit, my eyes are getting blurry, I'd better pop some Excedrin and lie down for a bit."" You wouldn't be like, ""Headaches are shameful. I'll pretend I don't get headaches, and if someone wonders why I'm green and look like I'm going to pass out, I'll make something up. Because I wouldn't want to get caught taking Excedrin and lying down, what would people think?!""  A few years ago, I decided to dispense with the shame game and just deal with pulling from a practical standpoint. I got tired of bringing myself down over it. I pull out my hairs, big deal. I don't sneak onto people's farms and try to have sex with the animals, ffs. (No offense to those folks.)   If I feel like I'm super-weird for pulling, I ""talk myself out of it,"" by deliberately counteracting negative thought patterns with positive ones, like Stuart Smalley affirming himself in the mirror. ""I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and dammit, people like me!"" Because let's face it- pulling hair might be weird, but it's not any weirder than any other weird shit people do, whether they can help it or not. That's something we all need to remind ourselves.  Now, instead of pretending otherwise, I just admit I'm going through a pulling phase, and need to go to the store and stock up on lash strips. If I manage to let everything grow in and have a good few months, good for me! If people ask about my lash strips (and not to brag, but usually they're asking how I'm so good at applying them), I say, ""Meh, when I get stressed, I pull out my eyelashes. I wear strips to help me not do it. Weird, but what are you gonna do.""   I wouldn't say it's easy talking about it like a normal subject, especially if you already have social anxiety. But every time you treat it that way, it becomes easier to deal with. I wish I hadn't waiting so long before changing my attitude on it."
Trichsters,1d9fm9,Dalisca,2,Sun Apr 28 17:20:27 2013 UTC,"Reading through them, they just seem to me like the kinds of negative thoughts most people experience.  I'm not a doc, but you sound more OCD than anything else.  Perhaps you should read up on it a bit -- it's not always as obvious as ""gotta flick the light switch 3 times before bed"".  Some professionals classify trich and dermatillomania as sub-categories of OCD.  Just some food for thought for you to munch on, but you would likely benefit from talking to a real doc about it."
Trichsters,1d9fm9,Ziruu,1 point,Sun Apr 28 07:58:01 2013 UTC,"I wouldn't think these cognitive distortions are completely congruent with TTM. And I definitely do not think you are using them as a coping mechanism, as cognitive distortions are just exacerbated thoughts. They could potentially fuel TTM, but that's just a wild speculation.  I would agree with you though about TTM not being caused by anxiety. Research into the etiology of TTM is lacking (not without reason, it's just hard).  Cognitive behavior therapy is the first line of defense for most people with TTM, especially by using habit reversal training."
Trichsters,1d9fm9,GoSharkDogsGo,1 point,Sun Apr 28 21:10:46 2013 UTC,"Cognitive disorders are negative thought processes that impact your daily life.  Maybe you're thinking about the cognitive thought processes that create mood disorders, such as anxiety or depression?  I suffer from depression.  Shortly after I became depressed (about 6 years ago) I started pulling.  Now, I'm finally ""okay"" and feeling a bit better, but I still pull.  Less, but still.  So yes, I would say there is a connection."
Trichsters,1d8fmv,KellynHeller,2,Sat Apr 27 20:33:29 2013 UTC,Maybe a swim cap? They come in all sorts of different materials.
Trichsters,1d8fmv,prolificsalo,1 point,Sat Apr 27 20:54:16 2013 UTC,"But those are so ugly. >.< I'm  a 21yr old female, I can't pull off the swim cap.  Thanks though.  I normally just use a bandana but I wanted other options."
Trichsters,1d8fmv,prolificsalo,1 point,Sat Apr 27 20:57:10 2013 UTC,"Sorry. My trich is elsewhere. I have to worry about scars more than thin patches. I like to wear these a lot though. They're like a cross between a headband and a bandana. I buy them from Midnight Sun here in Jacksonville. I don't see them on their website, but everyone there is really nice, and I bet if you called, they would set it up so you can order them. They have literally about 100 different colors and patterns."
Trichsters,1d8fmv,fingerpies,1 point,Sat Apr 27 21:11:10 2013 UTC,Oooh. Those are cute. I think I can find some here. Thanks
