The curious thing is it has an expression control as you can see him step on an exp pedal at 0.18 and the rate speeds up but I cant think of many choruses that have that.  It doesent sound anything like a small stone. Small stones have a thick chewy sweep. Its a chorus/flanger.

guitarpedals,3e4lj3,Sexperienced,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"Wish I could give a decent demo of the Gunslinger, but it sounds a bit shit through my phone.  After anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Gunslinger, I find myself somewhat disappointed. It could be my amp--and it could be that I'm running it at 9v instead of 18v--but it's not anything special so far. It's a typical distortion, really; there has been no ""wow, holy shit"" moment, even in the dawn of the honeymoon. The distortion sounds too dark (not muddy), but there's just something about the voicing that is a little off to me. Even after adjusting my amp and guitar tone controls, it never sounded fully rounded(?)...it's hard to describe. The GS is very loud, too: taking the level past 9 o'clock enters you into a world of ear pain, which makes it more difficult to work with the gain control; but in the end that's a minor issue. I will say that the clean up control is outstanding. Working that volume knob cops out some good tones, and the Low and High respond how you would expect. Overall it's a good distortion, not a game-changer; but hesitate to trust me, as I have only played it through my VHT Special 6, and it could very well be the greatest thing when using a more powerful amp and when ran at 18v.  Phasor and Boost are awesome."

This can result in a lot of noise at times.  Just make sure your supplies can provide an amount of current equal to or greater than the pedals connected. If sum total of current draw from all pedals is greater than the sum total of current supplied from the source, you have a problem.  As for voltage, voltage needs to be matched. The voltage of the supply shouldn't be over or under, but exactly the same as what the pedal says it requires. Usually, this is 9v."

guitarpedals,3e3c8a,INGESTIGATOR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"Underpowering a pedal will not hurt it, it just won't work right.  And manufacturers sometimes overstate actual current draw.   Providing too much power, in the form of voltage, can damage a circuit.   Excessive amperage (mA) is not a problem - the pedal will only draw what it requires.  IMO, spending enough on an isolated supply (many, especially imports, are marketed as isolated but are not) is a lifetime investment in clean, noise-free power.     There are cables available from voodoo lab that allow you to sum the output of two barrels to one pedal, allowing you to run a high-draw pedal from theoretically any power supply (not just voodoo labs).  BBE supa-charger seems to perenially be the least expensive isolated supply on the market."

It's not released yet, but pre-orders are happening and they should be shipping out soon.  Your pedals will only draw as much as they need, meaning plugging a fuzz pedal with a 3mA draw into a supply giving 300mA will not be a problem. You can even daisy chain multiple effects to one outlet so long as you don't exceed the mA output of that outlet."

It just takes it up to 11 basically. It's not for high gain tones or amps.  It's more for taking a Twin Reverb type amp that is clean and getting some dirt out of it. Works great for leads.

There's no way to turn it on without noticing it dramatically take over your tone (it boosts the mids and rolls off the low end) no matter how you set the knobs.  The OCD is transparent because (depending on the settings) you can roll back the volume knob on the guitar slightly then kick on the pedal on and it won't sound any different. It's literally undetectable. Then when you roll up your volume the gain ramps up. It's more gain (and compression) without changing the tone of the guitar.   I'll add, the OCD (or almost any pedal for that matter) can be set up to be non-transparent if that's the goal. Extreme gain and tone settings can easily produce tones that sound nothing like the bypassed tone."

They boost the lows to make it smoother, the mids to make it sing out a little more, and the highs to make it sound tighter, while adding a touch of compression which mimics the effects of the speaker and tube compression and even a bit of the grit (depending on the pedal) you'd get at a much higher volume.   Also, in a gigging environment I might want my amp at 6, but at a small venue they might say I can only play on 3, the transparent overdrive will do the rest of the work. I'm really appreciative of how many times my transparent OD's have saved my tone on a gig."

guitarpedals,3e19s5,skeddestheinsane,2,Tue Jul 21 08:08:09 2015 UTC,you can hear the delay on the tele pretty well in the moment he does the fast slide (for time and level) a little bit of hall reverb seems to be on there as well with a low gain drive.

guitarpedals,3dxmhj,TheMSPaintKing,6,Mon Jul 20 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's really a solid fuzz pedal, I like it a lot more than the traditionally recommended classic Fuzz Face or Big Muff style fuzzes. I don't have a ton of experience with fuzzes in general but this is definitely a really great sounding pedal and it's ridiculous that it came to me at such a low price.   I think my favorite setting is Damage at 10% and drive and tone at 3 o'clock. It's got decent note clarity with chords and can get really percussive as I said. Throwing the damage at 0% makes it a bit smoother and less piercing like maybe a Big Muff.   Damage at 100% can get crazy too, but not in a gimmicky way at all. It sorta bends the notes in chords and makes it more compressed/gated in a way for single notes. But you already know that obviously, I guess I'm just continuing my writeup. I really like this thing a lot."
guitarpedals,3dxmhj,must_be_the_mangoes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:24 2015 UTC,I had the FZ7 for a while but could never dial it in. Gave it to a friend once I got a germanium fuzz face. This kinda makes me wish I held on to it.
guitarpedals,3dxmhj,INGESTIGATOR,5,Mon Jul 20 19:33:35 2015 UTC,Nice! I think these pedals are totally underrated. I think many guitarists see the plastic exterior and clicky knobs and automatically assume it sucks.   I like the fact that they thought to print the current draw on the pedal..this should become standard for pedals IMO.
guitarpedals,3dxmhj,INGESTIGATOR,5,Mon Jul 20 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"They're not even plastic. They're metal like Boss pedals and other Ibanez ones. The knobs are plastic but I mean most knobs are anyways.  Yeah they're really well thought out and full featured for the most part. I've only ever had an issue with one of them and it's not even the fault of the pedal, it's just awful house wiring where I live. No amount of power isolation will help me with that."
guitarpedals,3dxmhj,INGESTIGATOR,3,Mon Jul 20 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I was wondering if that was metal or not...I saw that the knobs were plastic so I assumed the rest probably was too. Geez, that's actually...awesome. You can see I've never actually played one of these before.   So I bought 9v batteries for the first time in a while yesterday. Noise-free? Maybe? So $18 for a pack of 4. Um,...yeah never again."
guitarpedals,3dxmhj,koalaroo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:22:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I can run the PM7 on 9V but I'd rather wait for a sustainable solution for it honestly. If there's someone who can rewire it or fix it or if I just have to wait until I move for it to work well again.  The maddening thing about it too is that I had it working noise free the other day on power. Then it just started buzzing again. I know it's something having to do with the pedal's design because the same issue persists with the three different ones I've tried. The noise also disappears in repair shops and friends' houses.
guitarpedals,3dxmhj,koalaroo,3,Mon Jul 20 16:27:17 2015 UTC,"I'm dealing with a cloth-covered wire issue..Which I think is culprit of my noise. I think you're in boston too? Whenever I go to the cellar to do my laundry, I'm just reminded by seeing strands of black and white cloth waxed wires stapled on the ceiling overhead, wires like the kind in vintage 50s guitars. It's giving me more motivation to get better a job so I can move out."
guitarpedals,3dxmhj,easychairmethod,3,Mon Jul 20 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"Yep. That's where I am, and that's the exact issue for me too. But I don't think it's necessarily just the wires themselves- other peoples' apartments in the area don't have the same noise issues and their houses are just as old and have the same wiring materials.

guitarpedals,3dxmhj,GuitarAnthony,6,Mon Jul 20 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"I got more ToneLok in the mail and on Craigslist this past weekend.  The TC7 is like the CF7's chorus mode, but with a few more options for stereo chorus. Mode 2 gets really fast and weird. I think it's a cool chorus, but so is the CF7 so I'll be keeping that on my board.  The FZ7 is a really, really cool fuzz pedal. The ""damage"" switch says that it's supposed to be for emulating broken speakers- it's kind of more than that. The higher you set it, you get more of a trebly and percussive sound on chords, and it can almost make mild ring mod sounds up high on the neck like some really intense fuzzes have. There's also other settings you can use to make it more like a Big Muff/Fuzz Face/etc. but I don't know why you'd want to. This might replace my Metal Muff on my board.  ToneLok is cool. Send me your pedals. I still have a spare PM7 for sale or for trade if anyone's got anything cool. PM me 4 dealz"
guitarpedals,3e05gm,doctorfunkerton,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:30 2015 UTC,You probably won't experience tone suck from daisy chaining as much as some background buzzing. What pedals are you using? Might be worthwhile to put a buffer in your chain somewhere.

guitarpedals,3e05gm,Magical_Bananas,2,Mon Jul 20 23:59:54 2015 UTC,"Ummm what guitar are you using?

guitarpedals,3e05gm,koalaroo,4,Tue Jul 21 00:06:30 2015 UTC,"Could be the cry baby. Wahs can suck a lot of tone (I've experienced this with mine as well).  Take it out of your chain and see if that sounds better.  Usually insufficiant power would cause buzzing problems and not tone suck. Also, having all true bypass pedals can be the cause for degradation of your signal. Try placing a buffer at the front of your chain or a pedal with a good built in buffer like a Boss tuner or something."

Also the benefit of having stereo in means if you have say a chorus or delay pedal that runs stereo you don't have to recombine them. It can be a cool effect in the studio but it's not a big deal at all running in mono.

guitarpedals,3du1dc,koalaroo,18,Sun Jul 19 13:41:06 2015 UTC,"My first EQD pedal arrived yesterday! Nate from RGS set me up with a good deal on an open box so props to them for their customer service! I also got this new Epiphone es 335 pro on Friday that I can't stop playing so that's in the picture as well :D  First, some looped improv using my new 335 and the arrows. I know how much you guys like delay too so I squeezed some of that in there as well (from the way huge supa-puss I got for my birthday). Every overdub (excluding the first layer) in this track uses the arrows.  There seems to be a total of about 10 written reviews for the arrows (half of them not helpful), so I'm going to do my best to give you my thoughts in detail for those who are interested:  I bought this to replace my EHX lpb-1. While it sounded great with single coils, there was some muddiness/unwanted bass response when paired with humbuckers or a hot signal (OD's stacked before it). Enter the EQD arrows. Earthquaker is very accurate in their description of this pedal: it's not a flat, ""transparent"" boost, it has a bump in the upper midrange/treble frequencies and helps tighten up the bass response. I don't hear it ""cutting"" the bass per se like a tubescreamer or rat, but it's not flubby and it's not overwhelmingly bassy. It's in the goldilocks range: just right and perfect for a solo boost, whether you're using it before your OD for a gain/sustain/dirty boost, or after for a loud, clean volume boost.   One of the things I was worried about before buying it was that it would sound like an absolute ice pick with single coils. Not true. The treble frequencies are boosted, but I think the pedal does a good job at hitting that sweet spot of a good bright tone without sounding thin (even with a tele). I think you can hear this coming through well in the demos I posted. It definitely gives a bit more beef to single coils, in a very subtle, but beautiful way.  My amp is a little on the dark side (Marshall class 5) and with the arrows set around 10:00 (unity), I get a nice presence boost. The useable range on the dial is a lot better than the lpb-1 too. Makes it very easy to dial in the perfect amount of volume.   It also sounds great pushing another OD pedal. I cranked the dial on it to about 3:00 and ran it into my sd-1 for a really great sustaining and cutting lead tone. I would love to run it into a fuzz pedal, but my muff is out for the count with some insanely loud buzzing problems :( Placed after an OD, it can help EQ your sound without adding extra gain until you get around 2:00 on the dial (but that could be my amp just breaking up). I could definitely see this as an always on pedal if you like to use boosts that way, however, it is brighter (but not thinner) than something like the EP boost, or even the Zvex SHO (I think it actually beats the SHO at its own game in terms of ""sparkle""). If you have a muddy neck humbucker, the arrows really helps to clean everything up and bring some clarity without loosing that great, warm neck pickup tone.  Where it's really supposed to shine though is in a band setting, so I can't wait to try it out tomorrow for my gig!     …And we've all seen the posts calling for more demos, so I thought I'd get the ball rolling with a new segment I'd like to call…   Shitty Sound Samples! (crossing my fingers that this catches on :)  I recorded these on my phone, but hopefully they will be less shitty in the future. Please excuse the sloppy playing.  The first part of each track is without the arrows, then you’ll know it’s on when you hear a loud click.  (playlist, 3 sound clips) arrows with humbuckers  (playlist, 4 sound clips) arrows with single coils  I promise it sounds better in real life, but I think these are good enough to get an idea for what it does."
guitarpedals,3du1dc,Ultramerican,5,Sun Jul 19 13:41:21 2015 UTC,"To the ear, it sounds like you kicked in a compressor pedal with the sensitivity rolled off and the volume to unity.  I guess that's just the same kind of sound as pushing the signal harder into a preamp tube, compressing it in a warm, natural way.   Thanks for the demos."
guitarpedals,3du1dc,Ultramerican,3,Sun Jul 19 15:03:19 2015 UTC,Hmm interesting. I think part of that was me trying to keep the levels down so my phone mic wouldn't clip. But there's definitely some sort of compression happening with the lower frequencies. Sounds quite nice in person!
guitarpedals,3du1dc,iamadogand,2,Sun Jul 19 15:21:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly - it sounds identical to my Dyna Comp's low boost effect when you roll the sensitivity all the way down, but a little bit subtler.  It's a good sound for sure."

It may also be wise to try to get the paint inside removed if you think it's causing problems  The disintegration may just be well from use. It happens from time to time. I've had a Big Muff since '97 and had to fix minor things a few times.  Actually, if you're going to try anything, try squirting some electronics cleaner in it.

guitarpedals,3dqr4g,Matttt25,6,Sat Jul 18 15:26:16 2015 UTC,That's a pretty sweet combination of a Marshall head with an Orange cab. Do you get a better tone using the Marshall and Orange? Is the Orange more of a blues based cab?  I'd love to see a video of you setting it up. A lot of players would learn from a video like that.  Anyway...  Beautiful rig sir!
guitarpedals,3dqr4g,turk500,3,Sat Jul 18 19:28:49 2015 UTC,I've been rockin a Marshall M100 and Orange 4x10 cab for years and I love it. The sounds really gel well together and mixing my pedalboard in with it just puts it really over the top.
guitarpedals,3dqr4g,psadler,3,Sun Jul 19 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"Hey that's different. Great combo of the Marshall head an Orange.  Let me ask you this Psadler, does the type of music you play have a big effect on what amp head,cab and pedals you use at all?"
guitarpedals,3dqr4g,turk500,3,Sun Jul 19 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"My setups fairly versatile. I could play a lot of different styles. It's really the guitar itself that I use to give different tones for different styles. For example, I use a Fender Blacktop Tele to play pop punk/easycore (my preferred style) and I use a Squier Jazzmaster for Indie/Southern rock, my American Fender Strat for blues and my Gibson SG for classic. The guitars what I change to get different tones. But I do tinker with the pedal settings as well."

Oh well, it was like $17 new, I'll keep it.  Only got to play it for a few minutes, but my first impression is that it's very usable.  The only issue is that the gain has ridiculous amounts of painfully sharp high end of the tone knob is basically anywhere but all the way down.  With the tone knob turned all the way down, though, it just barely gets into a totally normal tone balance.  The gain sounds like it's based on a Distortion+, if I had to guess, but maybe with some different values in there.  The build quality is actually awesome.  It's made of metal, with a brushed metal top texture, and a flat black paint (stain?).  The top's edges are beveled, and the top comes off to access the circuit board.  I'll try and add a gut shot later today when I get a screwdriver and some time at home.  Will be ordering the chorus now to get the pedal I started out wanting to try.

guitarpedals,3drhji,turk500,10,Sat Jul 18 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"In my opinion you can't go wrong with a tube screamer. I know there are almost as many people who hate the TS circuit as there are people who love it. If you like the sound though it's perfect for blues, classic rock, indie, punk, any thing short of high gain drive needs. If you don't like the TS sound try one of these guys: Boss SD-1 or BD-2, Fulltone OCD, or something Klon related like an EHX Soulfood. All of those pedals are held in pretty high regards. They will all cover the blues and classic rock needs with ease. I currently have a TS9 and an OCD on my board and love the combination of the two. Hope this helps. Good luck and have fun chosing what's right for you!"
guitarpedals,3drhji,KK2691,6,Sat Jul 18 20:24:34 2015 UTC,"if you don't like the TS sound, try the Boss SD-1   Not the best advice. They are essentially the same pedal, minus the difference in clipping form. But other than that, this guy covered it all. Knowing what amp and guitar you have would help though."
guitarpedals,3drhji,theflyingjib,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, are they? I never knew that. I guess that makes sense though."
guitarpedals,3drhji,KK2691,2,Sat Jul 18 22:59:18 2015 UTC,"They were developed at the same time. Boss beat Ibanez slightly to it and patented the Assymetrical clipping, so Ibanez just modified it the TS to have symmetrical clipping. As a result, the Boss is slightly gainier with more treble, but they both had that same mid boost and smoothness we associate with Tube Screamers though. For my money, the SD-1 is better for a starter. Cheaper and built like a tank."
guitarpedals,3drhji,theflyingjib,2,Sat Jul 18 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"Asymmetrical and symmetrical are completely different in regards to tone. When viewing an asymmetrical compression, one side of the wave gets more compressed than the other, usually the treble side of the wave. This allows the bass to pass unfettered through the signal. When you have symmetrical clipping, both sides get clipped evenly, which is why people often complain about lack of bass when using tube screamers."
guitarpedals,3drhji,easychairmethod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:00:48 2015 UTC,That's pretty cool actually. Thanks for the info. I've never played an sd-1 but now certainly way to try one out.

guitarpedals,3drhji,theflyingjib,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:18:23 2015 UTC,"Hey KK, thanks for all the possibiles OD wise including a TS. The TS seems to be a running theme for players OD wise. I require something more high gain definitely. So you're right on that. But the EHX Soulfood sounds interesting. I've never seen one.   But I'm going to experiment with something more high gain,and simple. I don't like 5 to 10 dials. Makes no sense for me.   Thanks again"
guitarpedals,3drhji,emptyshark,2,Sun Jul 19 03:40:19 2015 UTC,"The Soul Food isn't really a high gain OD. It does the light transparent thing or the clean boost thing well, but you'll want to look elsewhere or get something in conjunction with the Soul Food."
guitarpedals,3drhji,theflyingjib,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:54:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for recommending the SF Emptyshark. I feel the need for some beef and dirt still in my OD. So it's either an MXR Berzerker or a Seymour Duncan Dirt Deed. I think you can still get cleaner sounds from a Berzerker or DD if you tweak them right with your amp and axe. Much respect and play the SF with love man.
guitarpedals,3drhji,TeleFilm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:49:46 2015 UTC,"It is worth looking into the Fulltone Plimsoul. I've never played an OD that does low gain and high gain both really well (they always excel at one end), but the Plimsoul is the closest I've found. Definitely higher gain than a TS which is also pretty mild."

guitarpedals,3dq15c,threetwomany,5,Sat Jul 18 15:08:12 2015 UTC,It'd go first in the chain. It helps prevent tone loss from having your signal run through so many pedals.

Just solder a resistor that's 1M or larger between the effect input and ground. It will drain off the excess voltage that gets trapped there when you switch into bypass.

I dont actually think boosting a fuzz with an overdrive gives you many benefits, but using the fuzz into the od lets you use the tone control of the od to control the sound  of the fuzz and give you a nice fuzz into dirty amp sound."
guitarpedals,3dpase,pnadora,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:44:04 2015 UTC,I disagree with there not being a lot of benefits for OD into fuzz.  I use a way huge green rhino into a silicon fuzz face clone and it gives me an awesome out of control kind of fuzz tone.  It's prefect for playing Maiden's Two Minutes To Midnight.    I'm sure it just depends on which fuzz and which OD you're using.

I'm thinking of getting an AB switcher to see if I can totally by-pass 4 or 5 pedals when I want to. (all the pedals are boutique-y True Bypass types)"
guitarpedals,3don1p,GuitarBOSS,2,Fri Jul 17 23:59:12 2015 UTC,you might get some noise depending on the pedals.   would you be ok with spending a little more and getting a power brick like the BBE power supply? the cost of 2 one spots would be about the same as one of those.

I believe it's 2500 mA for the standard One Spot. As long as you are reasonably below this maximum value you should be fine.   Remember, if you have an intolerable amount of noise, an isolated power supply won't always fix the problem.   I power my pedalboard with a 1000mA power supply daisy chained:  PolyTune > Jimi Hendrix Fuzz Face Mini > CryBaby Wah > Blues Driver > Tube Screamer > Voodoo Lab Micro Vibe > RC-2 looper  Most of the noise from my signal comes from my single coil pickups."

guitarpedals,3do8lv,Buoie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think the noise is unbearable, for what it's worth.  I think the smaller footprint off the X2 is probably better, all things considered.  What kind of complains to people have when it comes to the Ditto's unreliability?  Faulty switches?  They're easy to replace, I imagine, albeit a pain.  There are some places that are doing some blowouts on the Akai Headrush E2 on ebay you might want to look in to for a lot less coin, here's the search, just check on the sellers credibility first.  I bought one for a friend across the pond (UK) and got it no issue.  Kinda wish I had taken it out of the box to fiddle with, TBH.  But for the price, hard to beat, and they're pretty coveted."
guitarpedals,3dmn9e,MichMusic,10,Fri Jul 17 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Shnobel does some good comparisons between all three. Check out his YouTube reviews. However, foregoing that, I would say get a DD20. Way more robust build quality, the DL4 is known for switches breaking. And the tone is a bit better than the TC. That said, you could also check out the Flashback x4, it gives you the option of making your own delays and saving them."
guitarpedals,3dmn9e,easychairmethod,5,Fri Jul 17 14:53:43 2015 UTC,"The Dl4 is also known for breaking because so many people own them and don't know how to diagnose/fix them. A little know how and a little bit of care with them goes a long way. I'm convinced that people have cinder block feet in addition to other issues- Boss and Digitech PCB mounted switches in the same vein are always fine after the years so it's probably people knocking springs around most likely.  Oh but I should note, I don't recommend the DL4 for other reasons. I don't think many of the delays are really worthwhile, I always thought their strength was the looper more than anything. The M9 definitely has higher quality versions of those delays and a better looper, though it's definitely more expensive."
guitarpedals,3dmn9e,holladaddy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:01:42 2015 UTC,"I would trust Nick Reinhart to know how to take care of his DL4, but he's gone through at least 3 of them in 10 years. And I've personally sold a bunch to people looking to replace their broken one. So, I have a first hand experience with them breaking. I brought up that fact with my Line 6 rep, and how the market is coming out with things that do what the DL4 does but better, and his response was ""well we're not changing it."""
guitarpedals,3dmn9e,easychairmethod,2,Fri Jul 17 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"I've seen Nick literally sprint up from the back of the stage and stomp his DL4 in concert. Which was awesome. But yeah, I don't think that it speaks to literally everyone's experience. He's mentioned on Tera Melos' page that he fixes his a lot on his own though definitely.  They are finicky. But I don't think they deserve the rep for being so unreliable that they get. I'm honestly more concerned with the software/weird power glitches I hear about more than the switches."
guitarpedals,3dmn9e,holladaddy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:22:38 2015 UTC,"I remember when The Worm was in the band and they were so poor/broke they were asking if anyone knew anyone at AT&T because they had such huge overages due to touring! Good times. But yeah, switches aside, I've only heard a few things about the glitches. Then again, I've never bothered with owning one so I never truly investigated everything that could go wrong. I just know people are very vocal about the switches."
guitarpedals,3dmn9e,easychairmethod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah back when they had their second guitarist I know they went nuts more. But I saw Nick do this at a concert last year, too. I'm glad they still have good energy on stage like that, even if Jeff isn't around to climb onto the ceiling with his guitar anymore.  People are very vocal about the DL4 switches, yeah. I think part of it is just that it's earned a rep for being shoddy over the years because of being around for so long and having such a large user base.   I've heard of new owners of DL4s modding their switches for like $150 more out of the box just because they're scared of the switches breaking. That doesn't make any sense to me honestly, and I think it speaks to the irrationality/amount the criticism is overblown in general. It just seems like if it were a huge issue, people wouldn't still be buying these pedals with all the other delay modeler options out there these days, and Line 6 would've done something to improve on the product if it were a truly common and serious issue with their QA/warranty, etc.  But anyways, I still don't think the DL4 is that great for a delay box. It's a cool looper and one that has a few uncommon uses/functions, but I never really stepped on anything other than the ping pong or reverse delay."

I own an Akai Headrush E2 and a Digitech Timebender. They're both awesome, separated in price by quite a bit. The Timebender's just the best delay I've ever owned. If you can find a good deal on one ($150 is a steal- I somehow found it lower) I'd really recommend it.  I also own an M9 and have owned a DL4, they're cool but I didn't ever use the DL4 for delay.

guitarpedals,3dklu6,Elaw20,2,Fri Jul 17 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"Joyo overdrive is my favorite. Lots of clarity in its packed punch. I enjoy combining it with fuzz, ocd or the distortron for various higher gain/feedback/distortion shaping. It's very straightforward and to the point but when combined with other pedals can be quite versatile.   The flanger has a decent range but it can take a while to dial in something you really like. For myself, it's useful for light subtle warbly sounds. Combining it with some reverb and chorus sounds great for open tuning chords. I just wish it had a wet/dry knob to make it easier to dial back the intensity of some of the settings. If you're looking for something really specific, then I might suggest looking elsewhere. Otherwise, great pedal for the price and if you spend some time tweaking to your liking."

guitarpedals,3dkqvx,BloodOnTheTracks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:22:09 2015 UTC,"It's got more sputter than you'd ever need, to be honest. Anything below 9 o'clock makes your guitar hard to play because of how much the signal cuts and fries. But above 9 o'clock it spits beautifully. Also, volts knob works dynamically with the bias knob, making it very versatile. More bias = more sputter. High bias + low volts = chaos. It's great.  Even disregarding the volts, the pedal has a thunderous, growling distortion with a great bottom end to it. Like the regular Big Muff, it's got sustain for days too. So far I'm in love with it and would definitely recommend it."

guitarpedals,3dkvyx,Crease_Greaser,3,Fri Jul 17 02:28:35 2015 UTC,"Ok so let me say I am aware that this pedal has a weird rep. This is that big clunky one from the 90s. Saw it marked at $25, checked online and saw that the cheapest used I could find were $40-50+shipping. Kind of tested it out to make sure it worked, then came at the shopgirl sideways offering $16 cash to disarm her. She stammered and told me that was too low (duh). Ended up getting it for $20 even with a power supply thrown in.  So the thing about this pedal is that it's very high gain with no gain or distortion control. It does have a ""fab"" knob that idiots who review it online refer to as a gain or distortion knob but it is definitely not a gain or distortion knob. This thing is kind of like a fuzz that is always set real hot, and the Fab knob kinda pushes and pulls the texture. I think Danelectro tries to say it controls sustain. Whatever. The other thing is, I compared it to a fuzz, but, it's not. I'd call it a distortion. It sounds like distortion, it just is big like a fuzz and hard like a fuzz.  Behaving like a fuzz: this thing gets really dynamic when you start to play with your guitars volume and tone knobs. You can tame it down to an overdrive in that respect. Your guitar controls work as a really great extension of the pedal's controls and are really what keep this from being a one trick pony. None of the reviews I've seen online make mention of this.  The 2 eq knobs, treble and bass, are extra sensitive and function more like boosts than anything. You can make this thing so shrill or overt boomy if you feel inclined. Cutting them both down and boosting the level did not produce the overdrive effect I was hoping for, but I guess that setting could have applications.   If you see one cheap, go ahead and get it."

Here’s a quick demo of both pedals for those insistent peoples: https://soundcloud.com/prof-woland-1/ultra-dan-vibrato-echo-electro-demo  Delay is by itself through the solo, then vibrato and delay are together until the end. The distortion pedal used in solo is a (gasp) DS-1  The settings in the picture are the settings in the demo  These pedals are pretty gosh darn great. I prefer a subtle vibrato, but it’s sometimes fun to do that wunderbar wibble und wobble. The Dan Echo sounds just as good as any expensive delay. ‘Hi Cut’ knob takes it from digital to warm tape. Good stuff, yo.  And if you’re interested, here are some properly recorded songs I done did a while ago with a friend: https://soundcloud.com/badmoon-4"
guitarpedals,3djwj6,gretasgotagun,4,Thu Jul 16 21:34:27 2015 UTC,"Man, those pedals sound fantastic. I always laugh whenever somebody puts down Boss or other inexpensive pedals like these because they aren't booteek and expensive so therefore can't possibly sound as good.

There was a blind-test thread on some forum of the Timeline versus the Zoom MS-70CDR, and people voted on which pedal they believed the Timeline to be (because obviously it would sound better). The majority voted the Zoom to be superior. I wish there were more blind tests like that, to put to bed that kind of ignant thinking."

guitarpedals,3di3v6,Darkkaiden,8,Thu Jul 16 13:29:34 2015 UTC,"This came in a couple days ago, but have been pretty busy lately.  From the little bit I've played with it, this pedal is pretty great. The random modulation on the repeats is pretty cool, and gives them a nice lush feel. The record level knob is also really cool, because you can have a clean dry signal, but the repeats will be distorted. It makes for an interesting pedal.  Also, the bamboo front is awesome too. Another great pedal from Catalinbread."
guitarpedals,3di3v6,DodgingMonkey,5,Thu Jul 16 13:32:25 2015 UTC,"That bamboo front is sick! I've been looking for a pedal that does what the Belle does since I sold my Eleven Rack. It had a great tape delay based on the Echorec aswell, and I really want this pedal now! :)"
guitarpedals,3di3v6,gretasgotagun,4,Thu Jul 16 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"Catalinbread has an Echorec too haha. I got that one a while back, and it's a great delay as well. I've got my delay needs met between these two pedals. Catalinbread makes some fantastic stuff!"
guitarpedals,3di3v6,gretasgotagun,3,Thu Jul 16 14:15:42 2015 UTC,If you had to pick only one which would it be - the  Belle Epoch or the Echorec?
guitarpedals,3di3v6,bolanrox,2,Thu Jul 16 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"That's a tough choice, because they are pretty different. I think I'd choose the Echorec, though. The variable rhythm patterns give it a lot of versatility, and I like having the tone control too. I will say, I do prefer the random modulation on the Belle Epoch opposed to the straight LFO on the Echorec's modulation."
guitarpedals,3di3v6,bolanrox,3,Thu Jul 16 15:16:25 2015 UTC,I have the Echorec as well and was curious which one someone with both would choose. I love mine. I have a Flashback X4 also and I've always been into cleaner delay sounds than those with tape warble but your description of the Belle is making me want to give it some consideration.
guitarpedals,3di3v6,bolanrox,2,Thu Jul 16 16:17:40 2015 UTC,there is a trim pot for the modulation of the echorec also if you ever want to reduce or increase it
guitarpedals,3di3v6,bolanrox,3,Thu Jul 16 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, messing with the trim pots is one of the first things I did, I'm just saying as the delay trails you can hear the LFO just going up and down in a constant rate, where the Belle's random modulation means that it's a bit varied in how it sounds."
guitarpedals,3di3v6,INGESTIGATOR,2,Thu Jul 16 16:48:21 2015 UTC,"I really really want the Echorec, but for the money unless the reviews are horrible on the dd-500 i would be getting that as my next delay, if i do get another."

guitarpedals,3dkvsw,Urumiko,3,Mon Jul 20 18:26:58 2015 UTC,"I think you are talking about ""volume swells"" using a volume pedal in to reverb or similar modulation.  e.g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL3Z0baAvu0  Stick any sustained sound through a volume pedal then in to a reverb/delay effect. make sure the volume is down when you pluck then quickly bring it up after plucking.. This looses the percusive sound of the pluck, leaving you with a more synth like sound.  If you dont own a volume pedal the guitars volume knob can be used but ideally you want a vol pedal just before your time based effects."
guitarpedals,3dho91,RavenOwl,10,Thu Jul 16 10:29:10 2015 UTC,"This pedal is the single most important thing on my board and is on all the time.  So important, I have two.  If you use single coils, this compressor really shines.  It doesn't have the pump and squish of a Ross or Dynacomp.  It very smoothly boosts up the lower signal and really rounds out the tone.    Go find some clips of Will McFarlane.  If he's playing a single coil guitar, he's using one of these.  He's who convinced me to get one.    I've sold two people on these simply by playing them my clean sound both with and without the Mirage."

guitarpedals,3dho91,oneilldom,4,Thu Jul 16 18:09:47 2015 UTC,Fellow noob here also wondering. Though from reading other comments I think it makes the bass a bit less bass-y and rounds out the treble a bit too. Maybe someone would be kind enough to explain instead of down voting.
guitarpedals,3dho91,TrendyGame,6,Thu Jul 16 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"They narrow the dynamic range of your signal by reducing the level of any sounds above a set threshold and then using additional gain to raise the overall signal level. This is useful if your playing is at all uneven, especially if you need something consistently tight and equal. You can also adjust the note attack to make things more percussive - think funk, country etc. Compressors are also useful for increasing sustain on notes without resorting to overdrive."

guitarpedals,3dijq0,lunatictumor,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"when I had the voodoo's under the board, there was no avoiding some of the patch cables running near the units.  Well, there was some avoiding, but that caused long runs around the edge of the board and longer runs was not ideal either.  After many hours of trial and error, I found that the noise was completely eliminated when I moved the voodoo's to the back of the unit.  I probably could have kept my patch cables mostly above the board if it weren't for the bypass looper on the front row leading to a bunch of pedals on the back row.  It was an interesting learning experience.  I'd love to know if others experience anything similar.  I haven't read about it if so.  I've tried thicker patch cables with more insulation and nothing seemed to fix it until I moved the power supplies."

Even if you don't want exactly what he has, it can give you an idea of where to start. If it were me trying to get this sound, the first thing I'd try is a low wattage tube amp with a light overdrive or clean boost set loud to drive the amp harder."

guitarpedals,3dfmbp,RushofBlood52,2,Wed Jul 15 23:21:13 2015 UTC,"I guess. The PM7 has waveform shape controls and an additional ""mode"" (which I think is fake phase stages).

I'm also trying to eventually gather all of the ToneLok compact pedals. But not in a ""Boss Pedal Project"" kind of way. I'm just screwing around because they're funny and cheap and there are a ton of them that are actually great.  The PM7 is my favorite. I've actually owned three and have two right now... one wasn't working well with my house wiring, but I think I found a place in my chain where it doesn't make any noise at all. The square wave phase is one of my favorite modulation settings. The saw wave settings are also crazy and get into ring mod territory, and the sine ones make your more typical phaser sounds, but with a really high degree of craziness if you don't dig being subtle. It'll do that too if you really want.  The PH7 and AP7 are pretty straightforward. I like the options on the PH7 a little bit more, but the option for 4, 6, or 8 stage phases on the AP7 are really nice to have too. The PM7 is pretty capable of most of these sounds though, it's really the best of the three hands down if you ask me.  I currently own these three and the DE7 and CF7. My TC7 is in the mail.

I mean I don't see a really compelling reason to keep my extra one around apart from ""I really like this pedal and it was kinda cheap"".  edit:  I should have clarified/added details. I've owned three. I sold one because I didn't think I'd get anything working with it. They all are weird with my house wiring (even on an isolated, filtered power source) but not in other peoples' houses. Recently I found a spot in my chain where it doesn't make noise (after a ton of buffers and other shit). As long as you don't live in a shitty old house in Boston with awful cloth coated wiring, I think you'd be fine. And even then, you'd probably be fine.  All three of the PM7s I've owned have done this. Why did I buy another one or two more? I got great deals and I know they're worth more than what I got them at. I wanted to make sure my one pedal wasn't a defect. I just really like it, too."

guitarpedals,3dfmbp,Hookenfranker,3,Thu Jul 16 01:09:06 2015 UTC,"Also, also, it does fixed phase, so you can get a kind of parametric EQ going if you're a purist about tone or trying to mix."

Personally, I use sawtooth on Mode 1 with the Manual at a little before noon for a bright mid boost. It's not a usual feature of phasers; it's a selling point of the bad stone, and I assume high-end phasers like the Whetstone offer it. Dirt will bring out all the weird nuances of the effect."

I'm sure if you dig a little for some info, you can find it.    I made a quick attempt and came cross this blurb from a post at TDPRI -    ""Paul C's tip is to point the Drive, T & B knobs in the same ""clock"" direction. I.e., if you like the Drive at 11 am, point the T&B there too. Then tweak each until you are happy. Reversing the labels won't work and would be more confusing, unfortunately. They are passive cut knobs so cutting the bass definitely does not add more treble. Just thins out the tone.""  Another tip is that if divide up the sonic spectrum into lows, mids, and highs, turning down lows and highs is the same as turning up the mids, in a sense.  Keep that mind while experimenting with the Timmy.  Hope that helps.  I love my timmy.  Can work as transparent or colored boost and go from super light dirt to a nice medium overdrive, which you can also sculpt to your liking."

If you have a soldering iron and are comfortable using it just desolder the pot from the PCB and replace it with one from Mammoth Electronics or PedalPartsPlus (there are lots of places but I use those two most frequently).

Totally kick-ass! I really need to get/build a speed control for this.)  -BYOC Confidence Boost (was my first build and probably the most most useful. Not sure why it's turned all the way down in the pic)  -Dunlop Fuzz Face (I've read a lot of people saying these things suck. Maybe I got the one good one. IDK. This thing fuckin' rules. Haven't been able to build or find another fuzz that I like as much, mainly because of the way it cleans up and is so touch sensitive, and so I keep wasting money and killing the earth with batteries.)  -Snark tuner (replaced the silver Korg I used for about 10 years cuz it's true bypass and plays well with others more than the Korg. Since this was taken I've gone back to the Korg because it's more accurate.)  -Strymon El Capistan (after the tuner so I can let it make noise while I tune.)  -Peavey JSX. I leave the amp on the clean channel and just use the amp's footswitch to turn on/off the effects loop which goes through a Lexicon MX200 for random occasional effects. Positioned so I can hit that and the Fuzz at the same time. Boost and delay are positioned strategically for that reason also. When I fly I bring a Zoom MS70CDR instead of the MX200."

guitarpedals,3deu6o,bolanrox,3,Wed Jul 15 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"Well there is obvious praise to give it for it's durability and good construction that applies to any Boss pedal. Beyond that, I think it's a decent chorus. I think it excels as doing really thick, distorted chorus with little warble. It's when I've tried to take it into that really wobbly, modulated style that it becomes weaker. I dig it though. Cork sniffers always like to talk shit about boss, but they are the lifeblood of the pedal world I think. I'd wager more than half of the boutique chorus pedals out there are based on the old Boss CE-2 circuit."

I don't really notice too much of a volume drop when it's being played back or anything.  Great pedal for the price.  Especially since they used to be $150-$175 new.
guitarpedals,3deamc,TeleFilm,6,Wed Jul 15 16:40:51 2015 UTC,"I'm right here! I got mine on some kind of deal for $55 shipped and new. It's awesome. They're regularly $70 new at this point which makes me wonder how there are still listings for higher that would sell. Oh well.  Yeah I agree with everything you said. I think the looper function is really great too for a few other reasons. It essentially has undo function built in for overdubs- you can start overdubbing again from the start if you hit ""overdub"" again while playing over your base loop. you can also use that function to build off a base loop and then add in other parts on the fly. It's really, really great. If it were a bit smaller I'd be happier but for a cheap looper and great tape delay emulator I can't really ask for much more.  Something something Strymon El Capistan sux"
guitarpedals,3deamc,holladaddy,6,Wed Jul 15 17:18:31 2015 UTC,It's also worth mentioning that Thom Yorke uses one live to loop his vocals with.
guitarpedals,3deamc,RattaTatTat,3,Wed Jul 15 17:00:27 2015 UTC,Greenwood also uses one for looping and I think as another delay.
guitarpedals,3deamc,TeleFilm,2,Wed Jul 15 19:35:02 2015 UTC,Hey! /u/TeleFilm! I forgot you had the headrush! I think I will be picking it up then!
guitarpedals,3deamc,TeleFilm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"Hey what happened to you?  I never hear from you anymore!  Anyway, the Akai is great.  However, I recently bought the new BOSS DM-2w and it has so much character and depth to it than any digital delay I currently own."
guitarpedals,3deamc,TeleFilm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"Haha, I don't know! Those waza dm-2's look sick. Analog delay is so different from digital though. I recently got a supa-puss and it's super tasty!"
guitarpedals,3deamc,Bellyheart,0,Wed Jul 15 19:48:11 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly.  I feel like analog just has more character to the delays whereas digital is just simple and clean.    I miss using the Akai Headrush though.  I've been thinking about making a mini board though with my left over pedals.  Maybe just a board with 3 delays!
guitarpedals,3deamc,analogmoon,3,Wed Jul 15 21:06:18 2015 UTC,I had one for some time. I loved it and only sold it so I would stop looping as my way of making a song.   Delay sounds great and it functions as it should. They were going for 50 on eBay a month or so ago. Everyone seems to be clearing house with these.   The angled stomping might take getting used to for some but isn't a serious issue at all.   One thing to note is it does not oscillate. Not sure if that matters but to some it does.   The multiple outputs is very fun but I never found a use for it with guitar but in a studio setting it'd be a cool post pro effect.

I really like it because it is really easy to use and the algorithms sound very natural (Well in comparison to my old Boss RV-3 and the Strymon Flint). The paint scheme is pretty cool as well. It is just a great simple to use reverb. Couldn't recommend enough.  This is more of an aside, but what really surprised me about this pedal was how fast it got to my door. Only took 11 hours from when I ordered it for it to be delivered, and the one day shipping was free."

guitarpedals,3dcliy,Discojuan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:40:57 2015 UTC,"Muddy? What was your signal chain at the time?   Nonetheless the CB Echorec is a good pedal, had one for a while, but sold it because of the lack of a tap tempo. Solid pedal though and that was a sweet deal there."
guitarpedals,3ddxe7,maximumrocker,3,Wed Jul 15 14:49:56 2015 UTC,Yeah it does great in your chain. I used to play heavier high distortion music and it cut out all the buzz from my fuzz (lol) and when I hit a chord it would just be sexy fat tone. I will warn you it does kill sustain but that's to be expected if you have it set to a high threshold.  If you just need to kill some light buzzing I also used it for my treble pick ups on a single coil for a jimmy rigged recording sesh and it worked great to take out all buzz. I assume your pedals would do the same.

It's on sale for that Prime day sale for $28, and it's the exact same thing with different branding.  Neither are fully isolated.  However, it is regulated, so it's a step up from a daisy chain.  I like these because none of my pedals have a huge mA draw, so this cancels enough noise for me.  However, if you use a lot of digital pedals that pull a lot of power, this isn't gonna cut it.  BBE Supa-Charger is probably the cheapest you're gonna get for full isolation.  It's $88 on amazon."

I wouldn't describe it as being the most distinctive and amazing fuzz sound I've ever heard, but I enjoy using it.    With the fuzz and tone knobs low it's a more mellow sounding fuzz, kind of bluesy with some of that transistor-y buzz of a fuzz pedal.  With the tone turned up it's got a much harsher, raspier sound, nice for obnoxious garage rock.  I like the octave effect too - it's not a true octave up in the traditional sense, but what it does is gives the signal this very squelchy sound, that's almost synth-like.  The effect is really noticeable when playing two or more strings at the same time.  full chords are muddy when octave is turned on - but it can be useful if that's the sound you're going for.  one more note is that the units all shipped with a couple capacitors installed in the wrong polarity, which greatly reduces the ability of the octave effect.  search online for Voodoo Octave mod, you can find some links on how to fix the problem, if you know how to solder."

guitarpedals,3dc364,theflyingjib,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:51:10 2015 UTC,"I have the Vintage Phase and the Tremolo. Both are great pedals for the money and sound as good as anything twice the price in my opinion. It's really the lower build quality where the lower price comes from, but if you don't recklessly abuse your pedals, they should be fine. However, the Voodoo Octave Fuzz is widely considered one of their worst pedals in its stock form with a really weak octave effect. There is a mod to fix it, but if you're like me and don't know about that stuff, you might be screwed.  Edit: typo"
guitarpedals,3dc364,McBuggered,0,Wed Jul 15 21:39:53 2015 UTC,"""mellow"" is not a word I'd use to describe the voodoo octave. It's a nasty, aggressive, sharp fuzz.   On the other hand it sounds badass when run into a big muff."
guitarpedals,3dc364,I_only_post_here,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:38:05 2015 UTC,"It can definitely get nasty and sharp with the tone turned up, but I've also found if you use it with mid-cut turned off, and fuzz and tone knobs set around 10:00 or so that it has a much more tame, vintage 70's-ish fuzz sound.  Not the same sound as a fuzz face or a mosrite exactly, but it is definitely a more mellow, bluesy kind of fuzz in that setting."
guitarpedals,3dcx3l,GrampasGuitars777,3,Wed Jul 15 07:53:59 2015 UTC,Open it and look for obvious signs like loose wires or broken parts.  But if you have another TRS cable you should try that first.  Troubleshoot the easy stuff first.
guitarpedals,3dcx3l,duffmcshark,3,Wed Jul 15 11:21:38 2015 UTC,These should be fairly simple devices inside. I'd open it up and just wiggle the wires until you find one that's come loose. If there are no obvious ones take a picture of it open and I might be able to help you more

I do have a weird thing that happens sometimes though and I don't know if it's just mine because I got a lemon, or if it's a thing that happens with all of them, but every once in a great while, I'll record a loop, it'll cycle through a few times with no problem but then suddenly, it starts playing previous loops I've played on it. Not even whole parts of what I played though. It literally will take bits and pieces of every loop I've played through it, mash them together and just start playing them all at once. I cannot figure out why it does that. I've cleared every loop I've ever played, it's been powered off and there's no way to store loops on it, so I'm baffled. It's super creepy actually because it happens out of no where. I'm considering picking up a Ditto Stereo now because of this problem."

guitarpedals,3da7ye,RocKiNRanen,4,Tue Jul 14 19:46:46 2015 UTC,"I love it, a lot actually. I was so against fuzzes for the longest time because they all sounded the same to me. No matter which ones I tried, it seemed like you could get either a high end gainy sound from them, or a low end crunch. The Haunt on the other hand is a gated fuzz so you can get a super ""squishy"" almost wet sounding fuzz, a light distortion and everything in between. I am a pretty big OBNE fanboy though and they're one of my favorite builders. I'm saving up for a precession right now, as I am also a big reverb nerd. The hold function on it is incredible."

guitarpedals,3da7ye,_TurboGro_,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:20 2015 UTC,"I plan on picking the Procession up as well in the near future. I want to see how it's hold function reacts with the reverse setting on the Polara. Also, I can't have too many reverbs on my board, and having three (including the Afterneath) would give me just about every type of reverb I could want without too much knob fiddling. Also, I want a tremolo and the Procession has such a great sounding tremolo mode too."
guitarpedals,3da7ye,LeMoure,2,Wed Jul 15 21:23:02 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'd think the Polara would be a bit underwhelming for an Afterneath owner. Personally I only use my Polara as an always-on 'verb since my amp doesn't have reverb. I find the Afterneath to be much more conducive to creativity, but maybe I just haven't found the sweet spots on the Polara yet. What settings do you use the most on it?"
guitarpedals,3dbyb9,Nerpt,6,Wed Jul 15 02:06:37 2015 UTC,"You need mids, the lack of mid-range in the Big Muff is what makes it notorious about losing that clarity you mention. It'll still be noisy, but you get some mids going into or after the pedal and you might just fall in love again. You can try before it in the signal chain in order to ""push"" the Muff, or like I prefer, after it in order to focus the sound and give it a bit more bite. Play around with the settings and see if it brings some love back. If not, it's always good to have a Tube Screamer and the Muff is a good starter fuzz but there's a whole world of them out there. Maybe do some research, save up and find another one. Good luck! :)"
guitarpedals,3dbyb9,wabisabi218,5,Wed Jul 15 08:19:56 2015 UTC,"It's all about HOW YOU USE IT. It's dismaying to me that nobody is addressing that point. People are complaining about the EQ lacking mids, but if you want to lay down a thick bed of fuzz and sing over it and have the vocals be nice and audible, the Big Muff is actually perfect for that. If you want all the nuances of your guitar playing to be audible, the Big Muff is not good for that. I would say listen to the classic Big Muff bands like Dinosaur Jr and Smashing Pumpkins to hear how the pedal is best used. If that's not the sound you're going for, maybe you have picked the wrong pedal."

It's one of those things not a lot of people think about or realize it's there but you'd notice if it wasn't. Just having one and keeping it on all the time does so much to bring out a good tube amp's natural punch and dynamics or make a solid state amp growl. I love that pedal and I don't even own one.

My only real complaint is that it is a little too compressed on most settings so sometimes you can get a volume drop depending on what settings you run your other pedals and amp. The ""sub"" switch is awesome though, and it is a really useful pedal in the studio."
guitarpedals,3dbapv,yertles,2,Wed Jul 15 00:29:23 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with the compression being too much, most of the settings I use have the pulse width knob close to 7 or 8 o' clock."

guitarpedals,3dbapv,Deathwish_Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"Prescription Electronics Experience is the one I'll never part with.  It's a boutique fuzz/octave/swell pedal meant to replicate the classic Hendrix Octavia and Fuzz Face tone in one box, and knocks it outta the park.  Knew of it for years, but never actually tried one until I found a used one for 90 bux at GC, which is pretty much unheard of.  Even used they regularly go for 300+.  Sounds absolutely fantastic.   It has a nice warm, wooly fuzz tone , but you can always hear every note of a chord.  And when you kick on the octave, it just fuckin screams.  The swell isn't quite what I was expecting, it actually took a bit to figure it out because it's sensitive to your attack so you have to pick lightly, and you can get an almost violin-like sound.  The only other fuzz I've owned is one of the old Sovtek EHX big green boxes that are so sought after now, but I gave mine away to my old bass player because I didn't like how the lows devour everything else and I thought he'd get more mileage out of it.  IMO, the Experience's single flaw is that it's battery op only, but I can live with that."

It works and sounds great on both settings, and I think is well worth the money for the versatility and real estate it saves on my board. Solid pedal."

However, the enclosure is plastic, which is concerning seeing as how I'll be putting some body weight on it. Also there is a piece of foam that prevents plastic-on-plastic contact when the pedal is in the heel position. It's pretty thin, but just thick enough to not let the pedal get to zero volume without my foot actively putting the right amount of pressure on it. Kind of annoying - especially when you can hear the initial pluck when doing volume swells, or if you want to completely mute the guitar and walk away from your board, but I guess the foam can be removed. However, I use the wah function almost exclusively."
guitarpedals,3dca84,joeheadface,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:45:42 2015 UTC,It baffles me when a company like Hotone decides to sell a volume pedal for $100.  My suggestion-- say fuck that. Buy a used volume pedal for $40 somewhere. Or if you want to get a mini one I think AMT makes one.   It just bugs me that Hotone even sells any of their pedals for more than $50 honestly.

guitarpedals,3dca84,spencerkopp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:03:13 2015 UTC,You're correct. I think paying $100 for a Hotone volume pedal is like spending $50k on a Hyundai

guitarpedals,3dca84,spencerkopp,5,Wed Jul 15 11:29:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to be cryptic. As a consumer I don't take their brand seriously enough to consider spending $100 on their gear. They're a company I would seek out if I was looking for a $50 solution.  Yes, I realize this is just my opinion, and it's based on my perception of the brand and not an actual brand experience. But brand perception is important. I see Hotone as a novelty company because of their reputation for munchkin size, peculiar looking pedals (as opposed to critically acclaimed tone/interior craftsmanship).   While one can certainly argue that a company known for tiny enclosures would be the best place to turn for a tiny volume pedal, it doesn't translate that way from my perspective because I don't see the company as experts in their field.  Just my 2c, I'm not trying to be disrespectful."

It takes a second or two to register what note your playing once it's engaged and it emits an audible beep as the status LED blinks which is quite audible if you bypass with a distortion pedal after it

Tremolo is pretty prevalent with the Arctic Monkeys...I noticed a fast but subtle trem on a lot of their tracks.  Personally, I think single effects boxes are better than multiple-in-one, but the multi units can be good for trying out different sounds.  For delay, I love my Diamond Memory Lane Jr. Tap tempo, beat subdivisions, and press-and-hold feature to double the delay rate. Versatile but also really simple.

guitarpedals,3dbt0s,Ashsgtr,2,Wed Jul 15 03:29:17 2015 UTC,"Response from EQD  When we got the Aftneath the pedal was shorting out due to a loose jack. The jack ground the pedal to the metal emnclosure. If the jack is loose, it will cause a ground loop. When we tightened the jacks, everything was functioning as normal.  The hiss you are describing is normal. The drag control slows the clock down and reduces the fidelity of the signal as it pulls the delay lines apart. There is always going to be some small amount of noise that increases as you reduce the drag. This is not a problem with the pedal, rather it is how the effect is achieved.  The least noisy setting is with the drag control all the way clockwise. When designing the pedal, we knew the noise wopuld be present when the drag was  all the way down but did not find it exsesively noise compared to other delay and reverbs.  The buzzing you may be refuring to is the self osilation of thr drag and reflect (that what the prevois video you sent was demonstration.) The self-oscillation point will change passed one the Length, Reflect and Drag controls. You should start with the length and Reflect controls all the way down (CCW) and with the drag control all the way up (CW.) This will give you a good starting point to then start tweaking. The pedal can be very strange and unpredictable at time, but this is what we and many other users like about it. It is more in the realm of expreimental sounds and many settings. We understand this may not be for everyone, and if you are looking for a a quite standard reverb it may not fit that bill.  Let me know if you have any more questions.  Thanks, -Karl"

guitarpedals,3d8q4j,stringsandwinds,11,Tue Jul 14 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"I can't believe I ever tried to fake a bass guitar using a microPOG. This works so much better. MicroPOG added this clicky chimey piano-y sound that I could never get rid of. The Drop is the opposite, actually, it seems to roll off a bit of high end as it goes lower, which actually works in its favour as a bass emulation. Slight bit of volume drop as a result of the loss of high end when you go as low as an octave, which I think is natural and expected. Drop tuning seems to work well. Your tone does change (not lost, but changed) a bit. You know how when you play a note on the 2nd string, and then play the same note on the third string, it sounds tonally very different, but is still the same note? This is like that with the lower drop tunings. It isn't as drastic when tuning down just one or two steps though -- the tone change is pretty subtle. With distortion the tone change is pretty much undetectable. I haven't noticed any latency really, although I only ever notice latency on the MicroPOG when I have the dry signal in there too as I hear the upper octave as a slight delay. So it's hard to tell with latency... I don't play very fast so I might not be the best person to make a judgement on that.  Overall I'm pleased with it. I got it to emulate a bass guitar for recording and I think it will do well for that (MicroPOG would have been unusable). I got it also because I'm going to be recording a song with a key change down two semitones and for purposes of recording a demo I wanted to be able to keep it simple and just transpose the same playing. Plus, I think the differences in sound from the drop will be smaller than the differences would have been if I chose to transpose my actual playing and therefore have to play some notes on different strings.  Edit: Some more playing. Definitely feel a volume drop on drop tuning and a slight bit of high-end roll-off, noticeably mainly on clean playing. This is the sort of thing that could be a slight turn-off for some but is easily adjusted for with your amp EQ. This is only when drop-tuning, as the pedal is true bypass so it doesn't ever affect your dry tone. Also, I'm not certain but I think there might be slightly more latency on this than the MicroPOG. And although I haven't noticed any glitching or obviously bad tracking, I do, for some reason, get this slight feeling that the Drop is more likely to glitch than the MicroPOG -- with the MicroPOG I feel completely secure and confident that it will never glitch, but not so confident with the Drop. But again, I haven't actually experienced any obvious glitching. But overall, for simulating bass, the MicroPOG is a terrible choice and Drop is a great choice. So I'm really happy with it right now, despite the slight niggles. If you were looking for octaves and want a more organy sound, the MicroPOG is an awesome choice. Haven't tried the pitchfork but if it's like the MicroPOG I'm sure it will have great tracking and latency, but maybe a less natural tone than the Drop. I'd love to try one and might pick one up to replace the MicroPOG."
guitarpedals,3d8q4j,holladaddy,3,Tue Jul 14 12:02:23 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't this just sound more like a baritone guitar? IMO simulating bass is never great. You can ""kinda"" get there but I don't think it's worth neglecting just having a bass guitar close by, especially if it's for recording.  I use a Whammy V and I've tried an octave down and it's cool for a few things, but doesn't do a great job even compared to my shitty $100 Squier P bass. They're just two very differently voiced instruments."
guitarpedals,3d8q4j,holladaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:19:54 2015 UTC,"you are right, but space is a factor. i dont really have room for a huge bass. but if i wasnt interested in playing drop tune and i only wanted this for bass... then youre right maybe buying a cheapo bass would be better. but this does sound pretty damn good for simple bass lines. i dont want bass to do anything complicated in my songs so its fine, but if i wanted some nice smooth jazzy bass in there or something then id probs buy a bass"
guitarpedals,3d8q4j,holladaddy,3,Tue Jul 14 19:22:16 2015 UTC,"I think it only really really sounds kinda decent for fuzzy/distorted or otherwise trebly, dirty bass sounds. Other than that its just kind of a guitar in a low E tuning. But if it works for demos that's probably all you needed"
guitarpedals,3d8q4j,holladaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:25:48 2015 UTC,"well the kind of bass lines im thinking of is where you cant even really hear that the bass is there, its just playing root notes, no melodies. just using it to fill out the low end of the track to balance it out and not sound too thin. so thats all i would use bass for, i dont really intend to play it in any kind of melody or whatever. do you know what i mean? so it doesnt have to sound exactly like someone playing bass really, just something to fill out the frequency space that the bass occupies and not draw too much attention to itself. the problem with the micropog is that it draws attention to itself by sounding chimey and organy."

guitarpedals,3dah9q,sti_carza,7,Tue Jul 14 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"Get the AC-3 if you do! I used to love mine--it had a really cool feature the AC-2 didn't have, which was the direct out, which you could use to send to a mixing board (or another full-frequency system/amplifier, or even straight to a DAW), and then when you bypassed it, it would just act ""normally,"" sending your signal straight through the AC-3 onto the other pedals in your ""normal"" chain (buffered, I'm sure).   I actually got mine for a very specific reason that most guitarists don't use this for, though, which was to get Alex Lifeson's clean tones from the late 80s Rush albums like Hold Your Fire and Presto. I found out later that he was actually using some active single coil pickups on his guitars and either going (1) to a super-clean amp (like a Roland JC-120, on Hold Your Fire) or (2) direct to a mixing board (Presto) to get these sounds, but the AC-3 pulled off these sounds amazingly well! The only reason I got rid of it later on was that I eventually got better EQs (MXR 10-band) and the same preamp that Alex used (Gallien-Krueger 2000CPL--yes, they used to make guitar gear!), and I didn't have much of a need to emulate real acoustic sounds. I did enjoy those, however, and there were three different ""models"" of acoustic guitars + a ""piezo"" mode (which I'm guessing was for running a piezo-equipped guitar straight into--something I never got to try).   If you do try this, I would suggest you do it with (1) an all-single-coil-equipped guitar, (2) an H-S-H or S-S-H guitar (so you can use ""position 2,"" i.e. the bridge and the middle coil together), or (3) a dual-humbucking (H-H) guitar with a split coil feature (John Petrucci gets good sounds this way by using the middle position, in split coil mode--I think his guitars are maybe wired that way so he doesn't even have to pull a knob out to engage that when he switches to the middle position). Those kind of sounds naturally lend themselves to a more ""acoustic,"" ""trebly"" sound that works well with the AC-3.  One thing I should mention--it can sound really good as part of a normal guitar chain, with certain amps, but the ""acoustic"" sound almost always sounds better in the Direct Out mode, through a mixing board/flat-frequency amp/etc.  Considerably less hiss/noise too! It just works perfectly like that, and if you can layer some stereo chorus on that too, it sounds REALLY great ;)  I still remember jamming on some old Panic! songs with my friend using the AC-3--I would wire the Direct Out straight to my computer and the regular chain through my amps, so I could play the intro to one of those songs (""The Only Difference..."") with the ""acoustic"" sound and then switch right away to the full-on distortion blast (courtesy of my Nady TD-1 tube overdrive at the time) just by hitting the AC-3's footswitch. It was a lot of fun! Kind of wish I still had it ;)"
guitarpedals,3dah9q,analogkid85,3,Tue Jul 14 22:32:08 2015 UTC,"I have the AC-3 and loved the sound when I was playing it.  However, it is finicky.  You will read that some get a loud hissing sound and the tone is horrible.  When I first bought it I had an AC-15 and a cheap Crate practice amp.  It sounded GREAT through the AC-15, just sounded ok through the Crate.  I have since moved to a POD HD500X for simplicity reasons and I can't get any sound other than the high pitched horrible hissing sound that a lot of people complain about (I have used it in front of the pedal or as a pedal through the effects loop, which I have positioned in many places in the chain.)  It really sucks because I was using it for the exact way you want to use it, it was very versatile.  Just haven't found the right settings, if there is any, for my POD.  Good luck, hope your amp is one that works well with it because it really is a great pedal."

The only pedal that would be on in front of it could potentially be a compressor.  But I'd that gives issues I can just click the comp off"

guitarpedals,3dah9q,theflyingjib,-1,Tue Jul 14 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"Another option could be to have a piezo pickup installed under your bridge. In my opinion, they sound significantly better because they are actually using the microphone to amplify your guitars natural acoustic signal, and not processing it digitally to sound like an acoustic. With installation, they might be pricier, but you will always have it there with no need for the pedal and, I think at least, that they sound significantly better."

All I'm doing is (as the guy says in the first comment in the 1st review you posted), not playing the loop back immediately.

guitarpedals,3da15e,Zodsayskneel,8,Tue Jul 14 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"if you are going for an always on, you might be better off with an optical compressor.  less squash and coloring."
guitarpedals,3da15e,bolanrox,4,Tue Jul 14 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"The CS-3 doesn't get much love around here, the older CS-2 is more highly regarded.   I have a CS-3 and hardly ever use it, but compressors aren't really my scene as far as I can tell. I run mine off a Pedal Power 2+ now and haven't noticed much noise since I switched to this setup."
guitarpedals,3da15e,SpaceCat902,8,Tue Jul 14 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"The noise: Your compressor is doing its job. It is boosting the lower volumes, including the hiss that exists at those dB levels. The hiss is always there, it's just usually quiet enough that you don't notice it. A noise gate isn't likely to help either because when you have compressed the different volumes, the hiss will exist at a same dB level as many of your notes, so a noise gate would likely cut out some of your playing with it. Noise is just the name of the game with compressors. All compressors are going to do it, so all you can do is try and use batteries or some other cleaner power.  In general though, the CS-3 isn't a bad compressor it all, it's just coloured. Same with a Dynacomp and Ross compressors that came around the same time. Transparency didn't used to be so much of an issue when these pedals were first designed, so they all add their own tonal characteristics.  The Boss clearly isn't what you are looking for, but it's not bad either; it's just different. If you are desperate for a compressor, just try a more transparent one. I don't think any of them will solve the noise or dynamics issues you are concerned about though. Those are just things that compressors inherently do."
guitarpedals,3da15e,theflyingjib,3,Tue Jul 14 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"hmm wow i may be the ONLY person here who LOVES the CS-3.  However, I play in a synthpop band and guitar is meant to be another mix of instruments and nothing overly out there in terms of leads and need of ""pure"" guitar tone.  I actually tend to use the CS-3 as an effect over a tool.  Lots of squash through two clever bits of gain, chorus delay and reverb."

Here's a shot I took yesterday.  http://i.imgur.com/jxMBSR2.jpg  Chain is as follows.  Tuner--->CS-3--->Pink custom Tubescreamer with FAT and LED top end switches. more like an 808--->Tribute Audio KLONE--->Ibanez CS9--->Line 6 M5 for delays--->Digitech Digiverb (underrrated!)--->Ditto.

guitarpedals,3da15e,creep303,4,Wed Jul 15 13:25:44 2015 UTC,"The CS-3 was awful for me too. My apartment is bad too, but it wasn't worth putting up with or hoping that I'd move some day and it'd work well. I think the CS-3 is generally regarded as ""not great"".  I haven't looked into compressors since because I don't really think I'd like a functional/better one, but yeah if you wanna give it another go it'd be better with other options. Or you could get a noise gate or something.  BTW if you're going the Othling/ambient route I wouldn't take literally everything he does as gospel. There's a lot of cool stuff he does but I think ambient/reverb heavy guitar effects can be achieved a lot cheaper and usually in a slightly more unique way from what he does."
guitarpedals,3da15e,holladaddy,2,Tue Jul 14 18:34:51 2015 UTC,MXR's Dyna Comp is a pretty good BOSS alternative.  I found it to be less noisy when dealing with single coils.  Earthquaker's The Warden is very quiet and makes single coils absolutely sing.  It's a bit more expensive than the CS-3 but leagues better in terms of sound quality.
guitarpedals,3da15e,Cptn_Howdee,2,Tue Jul 14 21:31:24 2015 UTC,"I know what you're talking about. I had a CS-3 to begin with and the noise was atrocious. I thought a compressor was a waste of real estate on my pedalboard; until I bought my Walrus Audio Deep Six. Yes it's boutique, yes this sounds like a commercial, but seriously. This thing. It's always on and is now the foundation of my tone. Compressors went from ""waste of space"" to ""foundation of my tone"" due to this thing. Also check out the Wampler Ego. The key for me is the blend knob (a feature on both), which allows you to blend together your unaffected and compressed signal."
guitarpedals,3da15e,TheMightyCupcake,2,Tue Jul 14 21:41:46 2015 UTC,CS-3 isn't even the worst Boss pedal. Not when the X-tortion exists.
guitarpedals,3da15e,GuitarAnthony,2,Tue Jul 14 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"Trying not to add to the rabble, but maybe my two cents is worth that much.  Comps are crucial to my sound, so I've been on binge for a while to find what's right for me. If you're not impressed with the CS-3, I can't say I blame you. Yes there are better comps out there, one is bound to suit you better.  The raising of the noise floor: yes that's a thing that compressors do, but some excell phenomenally better at dealing with this than others.  I agree whole heartedly with the optical comps being preferable for always ons. Personally, I prefer them generally when we're talking about pedal comps. Obviously this is subjective, and reasonable people can disagree.  Not knowing what your budget looks like, I'd point you toward the EQD Warden. It simultaneously has enough (of the right) features to sound whatever way you need it to sound while being intuitive enough that the six knobs really shouldn't be intimidating or too much to overcome.  For the pricepoint (two hundredish new new, one fiftyish used), so long as you don't go down the compressor rabbit hole, you can buy one pedal and pretty confidently figure out if comps are for you or not. Unless you're after a specific sound like an old dynacomp, if the Warden isn't working for you you're pretty safe in writing off the effect as not for you (boardwise, not studio, as if that need be said). I don't own one right now, so I'm not pitching a pet favorite pedal; I'm just reading what you wrote and trying to come up with an answer that suits you. That said, if I was only ever allowed to use a Warden for my comp needs I wouldn't bat an eye because it really is a stellar, stellar comp.  TL;DR - Mid-priced, one and done with the search, pedalboard compressor = Earthquaker Devices Warden"

guitarpedals,3da15e,ekump,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:36:15 2015 UTC,"If you have noise issues with your rig then a compressor is going to exacerbate the issue, even the quieter ones.   If you are after sustain and not much color might I suggest a compressor with a blend knob? I have a Wampler Super Ego. You can set the attack to a not-too-fast setting, set the sustain high, and blend in the dry signal to taste. It allows the transients through while compressing the tails of your notes and giving you that sustain you're looking for."

Most of the ones in that video sound better than the stock CS-3, and don't have that ""clicky"" quality it has (which also plagued Digitech digital compressors in the 90s--though it's not as bad in the Boss)."
guitarpedals,3da15e,nikkidikki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:41:04 2015 UTC,"I think the secret to a good always on comp is a blend knob. I have my tone press set to about 10:00 on the blend knob and it adds fatness and sustain without ripping apart all that makes chords sound delicious. I also don't experience any extra noise with it on (I have the old version), even at more extreme settings.  I'd highly recommend the tone press. The old ones are great and can be found for <$100 used all day.  You could also try the Mooer yellow comp which is a clone of the diamond compressor (optical). It's supposed to be more transparent than Ross style comps, but I haven't heard one for myself so I'm not sure how it stacks up to the tone press.  The tone press is definitely worth the small investment though!"

guitarpedals,3da15e,Excuse_My_ADD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:49:16 2015 UTC,"One thing that no one seemed to mention here is the pedals settings.  These make a huge difference and are a little counter-intuitive.  Placement in the signal chain is a factor too.  The closer to the guitar the better.  Some like it later on, but the general rule is at the front.  Back to settings... Let's go backwards:  The Sustain:  Like others have mentioned, the noise in your rig will be amplified.  It is already there, you just don't notice it.  The higher the sustain knob is set, the more you will hear this noise.  For me, I start hearing it around 1 O'clock.  So, try keeping it between 11 and 1 o'clock.  You are getting the compression and sustain, but the noise will not be too bad.  Attack:  This you can set anyway you like.  I dime this knob as I like a fast attack.  This one you can play with to see what works best for you.  Tone:  You have some options with this knob.  If you want that high end clicky sound, crank it.  If you want a more transparent sound, set it so it matches your tone when the pedal is off.  You can do a lot with that knob.  Volume:  This is like the tone knob in many ways. You can match your volume to the volume of your rig with the pedal off, or you can dime it for a volume boost.  Keeping it down a little will help with the noise a bit as well.  So in the end, play around with the settings and you might get something you are more happy with.  A compressor pedal is not so much an effect as it is more of a tone shaping tool.  Some do use it as an effect though, and that is valid.  The C-3 might not be the best compressor out there, but it is not too bad once you dial it in."

The warp and twist modes both do crazy stuff if you hold the left pedal down while playing. One kind of freezes the note that's playing, and one sends you into super loud bizarre oscillation. I forget which is which.   You can change the Tape mode from one head to two by holding down the left pedal and turning the big knob. Subtle change, but cool. Similarly, you can change the length of the short delay on Dual mode the same way.   Holding the Tap button will change the display from milliseconds to beats per minute, which is great for recording.   If you turn up the Effect level all the way on Reverse mode, it's just the reversed sound which is weird and kind of hard to play with but also super fun.   Really nice board too.

Most tuners these days are really accurate, so if you're have the same problem between two pedals I'd wager that it's not the pedals that are the problem."
guitarpedals,3dakvv,PantslessDan,9,Tue Jul 14 20:11:42 2015 UTC,intonation was my first thought as well
guitarpedals,3dakvv,KevinBarbie,6,Tue Jul 14 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to third this.  If your tuner says you're out of tune on the fifth fret, it's generally because you're out of tune on the fifth fret, not because the tuner is faulty. When tuners have issues, it's usually with tracking, not with accuracy.  Also, questing for perfect tuning everywhere on the fretboard is a bit of a fool's errand. No guitar will be perfect (especially teles with barrel bridges), as it's the nature of a string instrument and the myriad factors at play. The important thing is that you're not hearing any major wonkiness while playing."
guitarpedals,3dakvv,wholetyouinhere,2,Tue Jul 14 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that my tuner was telling me I was in tune, then when I played 2 strings against eachother (open G, 5th fret on the D) I'd heard quite a substantial difference in pitch, in the form of the two notes beating against eachother quite quickly.  I'm not so bothered about being perfect upward of the 12th fret, but even my open G and C chords are sounding really off when I trust the tuner.  I will give the intonation a check though. I just got it set up, so I didn't expect to have intonation issues .."
guitarpedals,3dakvv,wholetyouinhere,5,Tue Jul 14 20:47:42 2015 UTC,"Forgive me, I'm trying to better understand -- are you saying you tuned your open strings, and then when you played, 5th fret on the D was out of tune with the open G? Because if that is the case, then it's almost certainly an intonation issue, since introducing a fretted note is causing the issue.  Are the strings old? Old strings cause these exact problems. Also double-check how hard you're fretting -- I know that sounds like condescending noob advice, but anyone can fall into the trap of accidentally fretting too hard while checking tuning. It's also worth noting that at the fifth fret, no guitar is perfectly in tune. It just isn't supposed to be noticeable to the ear.  If you just had it set up, then there shouldn't be any intonation issues. But you never know, some techs don't do what they should, some bridges don't do what they should. There's also weather -- if it's hot where you live, that could have messed up the intonation real bad, real quick."

I didn't even realise that was possible. I've been playing bass for the past few years and I'm just getting back into guitar!  I'll give the intonation a look though as well, just to be sure that's not playing a part.  Thanks for the advice."

guitarpedals,3dakvv,PantslessDan,2,Tue Jul 14 20:49:46 2015 UTC,"There's oodles of guides on YouTube that will explain it better than I can, but the gist of it is that you get the string in tune then check the tuning when you press on the 12th fret. If it's sharp or flat you adjust the string saddle accordingly. It really doesn't take long, nor is it particularly hard to do, but like wholetyouinhere said it will never be perfect. You can also pay a local shop to do it for you."

guitarpedals,3dakvv,minty901,2,Tue Jul 14 21:09:45 2015 UTC,How's the action/string height? You can raise it a bit to make you have to use a bit more force to fret the strings. I used to have my bass's action set super low to match my guitar.
guitarpedals,3dakvv,chilfhunter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:13:31 2015 UTC,"My action is pretty low, but I love the feel of it. I find it quite tricky to do tricky chord shapes with high action.  I guess I'll just have to get used to fretting more softly if I want to keep it.  It's really surprising to me now how little force you actually need to fret. My poor guitar, I've been essentially strangling it.  Thanks for humouring my stupidity."

guitarpedals,3d84l1,3string,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Some pedals use small computers (layman's terms) in them in order to process the sound. Reverbs almost always have them. The problem with these is that they usually require really smooth power in order to operate correctly. I've had this problem myself with a few pedals.  The solutions I found were either to A: run off batteries (if your pedal doesn't take them, you can easily solder a battery clip to a power plug) or B: get a better, smoother power supply. Some power supplies run a bit hot, (tested a ""9V"" supply the other day that turned out to be 12V) some run a bit low, and still other don't have very good smoothing capacitors in them."

guitarpedals,3d6xp6,LukeRobert,2,Tue Jul 14 00:42:33 2015 UTC,"I'm an advocate for a pedal tuner (you know, since you were asking for pedal suggestions) as it can also be used as a mute pedal.  Everyone's got their own favorite; Boss TU-2 is a solid, and extremely reliable, choice, but I also see a lot of fans off the TC Electronics Polytune (and mini).  I had a Fender tuner that did the job just fine for a number of years that was half the cost of those options. Thought it had died a few years back so I ordered a TU-2 for myself. After it arrived, I discovered it wasn't the Fender tuner that had died, but the power patch to the tuner. So that was an embarrassing mistake. Sold the Fender tuner for $20 after that, so at least it wasn't too expensive a mistake."
guitarpedals,3d6xp6,theflyingjib,3,Tue Jul 14 23:40:49 2015 UTC,"For a live situation, a pedal tuner is the best. A clip-on tuner is affected by all vibrations, so a noisy room can mess with it, and they usually aren't bright enough to read on stage. In a bedroom, they are fine. If you want a pedal tuner, the Boss TU-2 is the king. Incredibly durable and reliable and I've never found them to be off in accuracy. They are also incredibly easy to find for cheap. If you can't get one, the Korg Pitchfork is a good alternative."

For what it's worth I have had none of the problems you described. I gig 3-4 times per week with a full band. Mostly bars but an occasional outdoor event as well. My pedal tuner was definitely less dorky than my clip on but otherwise it's worked flawlessly. I tried a few different clip ons but ended up back at the Snark.

Then I guess if you're going to take two pedals with you to a gig, you may as well get a small board with room for an overdrive and a reverb pedal. That's about as minimal as I'd go for a performance.

If I could bump that up to four pedals, I'd add a tremolo and go ahead and trade my clip-on tuner for a pedal tuner.   Here's a post that includes my full board. I'm a fan (generally) of what I've got on there, but I'm considering a hunt to maybe add a low-gain OD so I can have some variety, as well as I'd love to add a digital delay to the board.   Other than to speak as to what I use and my own preference, I'm hesitant to make any statements about any one specific pedal being a requirement over any other as it all depends on what sound you're going for, as well as what on either end of those pedals - the player, guitar, and amp."

I don't know if it's cause I play at bedroom, or if my amp just doesn't match them. But since I bought the Katana Blues Drive I was instantly in love with it. It just makes the tubes of my Blackstar sounding like heaven. My last baby is the Mad Professor ""1"", and this one is just crazy. I loved it. It gives the tone of my favorite guitarists from 70's and 80's. About the Memory Toy, well... I'm not an expert about delay. It's my first delay pedal actually, and I'm just start learning how to properly using it, but I can say it's doing a great job. I just don't get it the right way to use the Dyna Comp (or maybe I just realized I don't like compressors). If I put lots of Sensibility, it gets a good sustain and ""lots"" of noise. If I keep it subtle, I just can't tell the difference. And I don't like the way I lose my volume when treading it. Maybe I'll just sell it and try another things."
guitarpedals,3d60l9,Ultramerican,2,Mon Jul 13 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"A Dyna Comp with the sensitivity at 0 will have a huge effect on the EQ profile of the guitar signal.  It will have a ton more low midrange, if memory serves.  It will also lower the dynamic range of the signal quite a bit even at 0."
guitarpedals,3d60l9,theflyingjib,4,Mon Jul 13 20:34:15 2015 UTC,Some times I think it has effect on EQ even when it's off. u.u
guitarpedals,3d60l9,Ultramerican,4,Mon Jul 13 20:47:32 2015 UTC,"That is entirely true. Dynacomps have a hardwire bypass, so what you are getting is not the straight guitar signal you get with true bypass, and they don't have a buffer to correct this."
guitarpedals,3d60l9,theflyingjib,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:40:43 2015 UTC,What's the difference in the signal?
guitarpedals,3d60l9,Ultramerican,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:05:43 2015 UTC,"In a true bypass pedal, the signal is going directly through the pedal as if it isn't even plugged in. In a hardwire bypass, the pedal is passing through the mechanics in the pedal, often resulting in tone loss. In a buffered pedal, the signal is passing through the mechanics of the pedal, but using the buffer to correct the tone loss."
guitarpedals,3d60l9,theflyingjib,2,Tue Jul 14 01:09:10 2015 UTC,"What exactly is it passing through?  If it were passing through the entire board normally, it'd be ""on"".  If it's just a foot more distance worth of resistance, that's not a tone loss I really care about because I have other buffers."
guitarpedals,3d60l9,Ultramerican,2,Tue Jul 14 01:46:55 2015 UTC,"Hardwire bypass is fine most of the time. It depends on the pedal usually. I use some with no buffers and never notice any change, but some are notorious for being worse , the Dynacomp included."

guitarpedals,3d60l9,dragonitedestroysyou,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:29:04 2015 UTC,"I love my Dyna Comp. It's probably not for everybody, but here's how I use mine.   Output almost all the way up. Sometimes all the way up. I have an MXR Distortion+ that does the same thing, I can barely hear it unless the volume is maxed. Not sure what it is about those, but that's what I've noticed. Then Sensitivity almost all the way down. If I'm doing tapping stuff or something subtle like that, I'll turn it up about halfway at the most. Quick way to remember is to just make those two knobs point at each other.   Definitely a sweet pedal. If it doesn't do it for you, maybe check out the Diamond Compressor (have used it, incredibly amazing) or the Keeley Four Knob."
guitarpedals,3d5fvf,winter_beard,2,Mon Jul 13 17:50:24 2015 UTC,"I got the Pitch Bay off of CL for $140. I used to have a Whammy and that was my only experience with any sort of pitch shifter. I have been having a lot of fun with this so far.  I've been wanting a Fuzz for quite a while, and finally took the plunge after reading up and watching several reviews on the FF mini germanium.  Question: Where should the FF go on my pedal board? (this is an old setup I currently have Tuner>Pitch Bay>Cry Baby>OCD>Tremolo>Env Phaser>Vibrato>Delay>Looper. I was reading that the Fuzz should go first? Even before the Pitch Bay?"
guitarpedals,3d5fvf,jtm5098,3,Mon Jul 13 17:58:48 2015 UTC,"Nice setup! Fuzz Faces typically perform pretty poorly after other effects, especially buffered, so the recommendation is to place them first in the signal chain, even before your tuner as it has a built-in buffer. I'd use your ears to determine what you like best but word on the street is that this is generally the best way to approach it."
guitarpedals,3d5fvf,TimmyPage06,3,Mon Jul 13 18:20:21 2015 UTC,"The fuzz face has no input buffer so it HAS to go first and see a direct line from your guitar, at least to use it 'normally'. The way to use a fuzz face is actually to turn the gain to 3 o'clock - Max and then turn the volume up until it matches the level of your normal signal.   You now have complete control over the fuzz, when your guitar is on 10 it'll be a full out balls to the wall fuzz, on 9 it becomes more of a heavy distortion, by 6-7 it's more of a light overdrive and 4-5 and it'll be almost clean (or at least as clean as your amp/pedals after it). It's SUPER controllable by volume knob. If you put it after any buffered pedal you lose that control and it'll sound like it's on 10 at all times.  Also, if you take the back off the mini you'll be able to see a little internal trimpot that you can adjust with a screwdriver. Turning it to the left makes it thinner and splattier, and to the right makes it warmer and smoother. Adjust to taste, when I got my Hendrix FF I thought it sounded awful until I turned the internal trimpot to about 11' and got that cool splatty fuzz face tone. Well worth adjusting."

The ability to toggle the voltages can also be useful for pedals that don't mind being cranked up to 18v (i.e. OCD).  For the amount of pedals you are looking to power (and even if you get a few more) you will have no problems at all.

By boosting the lower volumes, your compressor is also raising the volume of the hiss that exists in those regions. The hiss is always there, your compressor is just making it loud enough to here, and since it is compressing all of your signal to a relatively closer volume, a noise gate won't be effective without cancelling out a lot of your signal, including the notes you are playing."

guitarpedals,3d5aeh,mxtrav,2,Mon Jul 13 17:12:40 2015 UTC,Only way I think you can use a looper effectively is to put the looper after. Record your rhythm guitar with trio into the looper. Then turn off the trio and play lead.
guitarpedals,3d5aeh,nepperz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:18:37 2015 UTC,That's a good idea.

Overall I think it's a lot of fun, and I've been using it some for late night sessions with headphones. Pretty solid clean sound to jam with the rest of my pedalboard. Also great for practicing solos and just noodling around. Hopefully they release some firmware updates for the features people would like to see."

This would be a trivial fix for someone who knows how to do it - desolder the broken bit, solder on a new one. BYOC has great starter kits and directions if you want to do this yourself. Look on YouTube for soldering/desoldering components.  You may also want to contact EHX - I'm sure they would be happy to do the repair, though shipping may be prohibitive. At the very least you could buy an 'official' replacement part."

guitarpedals,3d1sof,rdmdcne,9,Sun Jul 12 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"Sure! I will say that two of the three switches don't do anything anymore. They both used to work with an onboard active preamp that I've since decoupled - the third switch is simply a phase switch for the neck pickup. Nothing too fancy.  There are a few other bizarre/questionable mods that this poor Tele has suffered through over the years - less-than-traditional tone circuit wiring, different saddle types/materials, not-so-strategic paint removal, and having various parts made to certain specs that I prefer - mostly stuff like that!"

guitarpedals,3d4kjj,bolanrox,3,Mon Jul 13 13:57:23 2015 UTC,"This. All of the extra noise and tone suck (at its most extreme, but not usually) come from daisy chaining. If you just took the 1spot and used only the main connector it would just act as a standard isolated power supply, just with more juice than a normal 9v boss style wall wart.

guitarpedals,3d4kjj,theflyingjib,2,Mon Jul 13 14:29:47 2015 UTC,"If it is only hooked up to one pedal using just the standard single plug that comes on a 1 spoy, it will indeed be isolated. Picking up radio signals will be your only concern now."

There might be a tiny, barely perceivable difference between the two but it won't be a problem.  What I mean by dirty power is poor or unshielded wiring in your house/gig space which can introduce more noise into your signal. Though given electricity codes and standards in North America I feel like this was more of a problem in Europe than in NA.  TL;DR 1spot is not ""perfectly"" isolated if used as a wall wart but unless your house desperately needs some electrician work you probably won't notice."

guitarpedals,3d3nko,legal_rye,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:58:07 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, you want to run from your amp's FX send into the loop switcher and then from the loop switcher to your amp's main input (not the FX return). This is not good. If you're talking about going back to your amps FX return, then you're golden, though it only really helps you if you have effects in the loop switcher's loop that you can engage or drop when needed (always on makes the looper pointless, but not harmful).  The loop switcher is really only for cutting effects out of your signal path when you aren't using them. That's true in the amp's fx loop or in front of the amp, just don't try to go from the loop back into the front of the amp.  Am I misunderstanding your goal?"
guitarpedals,3d3nko,reid-o,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:55:27 2015 UTC,"I think so. I was thinking one of the loops would go in amp input and out fx send then the switcher output goes in fx return. Like the amp's gain stage is one of the loops, so some pedals can be before it and some after while still all being controlled by the switcher."
guitarpedals,3d3nko,reid-o,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"That won't work because the fx send is after the preamp (and its gain stages), so it would endlessly loop back on itself and never get to your power amp and speakers. Whatever you use the looper for it will still ultimately keep the same relationship to your amp, some pedals are before amp, some in fx loop.  The whole point of a loop pedal is to allow you to engage / disengage multiple effects with one click; secondarily, it is to shorten your effective cable length when you need fewer effects. Trying to use it as a signal router is usually not going to behave like you want it to. Even with a proper signal router, you can't / don't want to try to send a signal through the same circuit twice - if that's your goal, you need 2 of that circuit.  Back to your problem - if you need more gain or more gain stages so you can cascade one into another, what you need are dirt pedals (OD, Distortion), preamps, or any pedal / unit that offers a gain stage. You can run that in front of the amp or in the loop (if that's your preference)."
guitarpedals,3d3nko,reid-o,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"On further thought, you're trying to put the preamp in a loop. Yes, you can do this, but you're going to need a different power amp.  Edit: imagine you have 3 combo amps, all with fx loops. The preamps from amps A and B could be in loops 1 and 2 respectively, and the loop out goes into the power amp input (FX return) of amp C. This would allow you to choose which preamp you're running, or even both. Does this work? Yes! Is it a little crazy and weird? Also Yes! Might you damage a preamp by running way too hot a signal into it? Yes. If this is your goal, consider preamp pedals instead and either run them with a flat EQ on your amp, or buy a dedicated power amp."

I take it the looper switching system also sends midi out for certain loops to allow patch changes on the Timeline and Mobius? Pretty cool!  What are your thoughts and feelings on the empress phaser? I'm pretty curious about it, and it looks to have more than everything I'd love in a phaser. You like it more than the Mobius phaser?   Loving the board man!"
guitarpedals,3d0dpk,korpret1,2,Sun Jul 12 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  You're exactly right. The looper patches pedals in and out per your presets and allows for saving midi presets to those banks. All the headache of tap dancing is removed.  I really love the empress phaser. I use it a lot as a slow auto filter that's an always on pedal and rely on the Mobius for the heavy lifting in terms of variety. I definitely built this board to make it so that I have to touch it as little as possible to get a bunch of parameters to change. But that super slow phasing it adds an incredible richness to my sound that you can't quite put your finger on if you don't know exactly what it is you're listening too. It's subtle and warps my sound enough to make everything I play dynamic without my having to work really hard. I really prefer the analogue sound to cover that range and in terms of how I'm using it I couldn't ask for a more fine tunable, multi-functional phaser. Of course it's also great as a primary phaser but I wouldn't say I like it more or less than the Mobius. I'd say that the functionality of what I'm looking for is well met by this combination of fine pedals."

guitarpedals,3d0dpk,Batdru,3,Sun Jul 12 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"Right, so obviously the board is built around the crocodile tail loop switcher. It's guitar input is through the expression pedal into the top of the looper. From there I have have a pretty traditional chain, the OB-1, to Overdrives, (LGW), (OCD), to the Octavious, to the Empress. At this point I patch in a dummy signal on the looper because the output is actually stereo to a pair of amps that play off each other. That dummy signal runs into the Mobius and then Timeline alongside the original signal, which picks it up as a second input and outputs it as a second processed signal. Now I have the A and B signals run back into the looper and then the two signals master out through Hall of Fame and Blue Sky to the amps. The thing about it is that everything before the dummy signal I can isolate and remove because everything is on it's own controller loop. So instead of turning pedals on and off I just have program banks that add and remove pedal loop channels. That's where the midi presets come into play, I can save midi presets on the Timeline and Mobius to the looper and recall them with one touch. There's also a unit that's compatible with the Empress phaser for midi recall but I haven't had need. The looper has a tuner out which runs into the polymini that is fabulous cause it shuts the thing up real quick when it all gets to be too much. The programming is super simple. The bitch is in running cables. I managed to get it pretty clean, but the underside of the board and the two power units under than shelf are mad. Yeah!"

guitarpedals,3d1a4t,jonelder1,4,Sun Jul 12 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"When you go into the editor, the M5KmHall Custom (or something along those lines) is really good. It's similar to the Big Room With a View with its tri-chorus modulation, but with the tone control also affecting modulation. I made my own tone print based off of this that can do everything I want from a reverb. First I'll describe it, then I'll show you screen shots of the exact settings.  Decay controls decay and can go really long. I also made decay control the wet level. With decay below 9:00, it's 100% wet. Between 9:00 and 3:00 the dry signal is in there. Then above 3:00, it's 100% wet again. This is because I like to have all-wet reverb with short decay to simulate someone playing guitar in the distance. I also like 100% wet with long decay for ambient drones. So setting it up like this makes that possible.  As with the tone knob, I kept it how it is from that modified hall preset I mentioned above. At minimum it's dark, and brightens up until noon. Then from noon onwards it starts to add some modulation and a bit more brightness. I like it just above noon most of the time for a bit of modulation but not too over-the-top. But you can dial the tone knob back just below noon and it gives you a very smooth plate.  With this tone print I can get pretty much any reverb sounds I want, except for extremely subtle reverb, so for that I go to the ""ambient"" setting on the hall of fame -- that is great for subtle room reverb.  Here are the screenshots of my reverb setting: http://imgur.com/a/Tsc2E  The pictures all have the same settings in the right pane obviously, but I put multiple pictures so you can see how each knobs taper has been set."

guitarpedals,3d1egy,Maerang,2,Mon Jul 13 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"The two pedals that have been on my board the longest are my Hardwire RV-7 and my T-Rex Crunchy Frog.  The RV-7 is a reverb from Digitech that is Lexicon licensed. Studio quality, stereo reverb in a pedal. Perfect for adding subtle roominess or depth and ambience. Trails max out at about 3-4 seconds.  The Crunchy Frog is a TS clone that has a blend knob and an independent clean boost. The blend lets you mix in the unaffected signal to give you more dynamic response and bring back some of your low end. The clean boost is totally separate, and adds a bazillion dB of gain to your signal...Way more than I'd ever want to explore. Great for pushing your amp into a tube-like breakup and getting louder for solo's.  Both discontinued, RV-7 ~$80, Crunchy Frog ~$60"
guitarpedals,3d1egy,ndlundstrom,2,Mon Jul 13 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"I guess more of a company really.  Daredevil pedals is a brand out of Chicago that makes some awesome stuff.  Mostly dirt pedals.  I have the Gold Leader which is based on a silicon fuzz face circuit, but tweaked to cut through a bit better.  It's also cool because, unlike the orginal fuzz face, you don't need to have it first in your chain.  It's the main foundation for my tone, plus it sounds great with my Green Rhino in front to push it.  Their stuff is pretty inexpensive when compared to other independant pedal makers as well."

guitarpedals,3d34cg,house_haunted,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:54:25 2015 UTC,If you want to stick with the ehx vibe get a small clone for your chorus. Also you can get a great fuzzy tone with a big muff by slightly rolling back your guitars volume knob. It gives it a warm fuzz without a being super harsh. Most of the time my muff is on and I just roll the volume knob to where I want it to be. Even for cleans. I also use an MXR Micro amp to boost into the Muff for a gnarly tone sometimes.
guitarpedals,3d34cg,namedude,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:03:38 2015 UTC,"The Small Clone is a great chorus, as /u/namedude suggested, especially for the price. My only complaint was the depth switch as it basically has two modes - lots of chorus and LOTS of chorus, nothing subtle. If you go with the Small Clone I'd recommend looking into a mod that adds a Depth control knob, there are several companies who do it for cheap but I did it myself very easily in about 30 minutes. Made a HUGE difference and its much more usable now. The Way Huge Blue Hippo is probably my favorite chorus right now and it already has a Depth control with a cool Vibe switch, but at $170 it certainly isn't twice as good as the $80 stock Small Clone."

guitarpedals,3czeqy,Darkkaiden,3,Sun Jul 12 05:08:55 2015 UTC,"I have! I run my OCD into my MXR Super Comp. Usually I keep the gain below 12 o'clock on the OCD and keep the sustain low on the comp with the attack reasonably high. I love being able to use my volume knob to go from bluesy drive to snappy cleans with very little volume drop. And the added sustain is killer for both clean and dirty. I play a Strat most often, but it works great with my LP and Tele as well."
guitarpedals,3czeqy,Jamesyy,3,Sun Jul 12 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"I've been doing the same, blues driver into a dyna comp. It's really fun being able to control feedback and crazy sustain in the middle of a solo just by increasing the knob"
guitarpedals,3czeqy,koalaroo,3,Sun Jul 12 04:44:15 2015 UTC,"Me!  Well, I run a blues driver into a barber tone press, and then have the rest of my drive section after that because I don't like squishing my higher gain pedals.   I don't think it makes sense to have a touch sensitive drive like a lot of people do just to place it after a compressor. I keep my bd-2 on almost all the time so it just makes more sense to run it before. Plus, a loud clean boost sounds really great going into a comp :D"

guitarpedals,3czeqy,bolanrox,3,Sun Jul 12 09:30:32 2015 UTC,"I do, ever since watching a gig rig video about compressor placement. If you think about it, most gain pedals sound best going INTO a loud amp.  A cranked amp fundamentally has a bit of compression, both in the circuit and from the speakers. With a compressor pedal after your gain pedal you are tricking you ears into hearing it played through a much bigger, louder and more compressed amp, while still having all the advantages, nuances and tonal benefits of letting the pedal ""hear"" your natural signal.  I like it better that way but it's like.. Gain-comp is a gain enhancer, comp-gain is an ""effect"" where you are looking for a very specific sound."

First are the footswichable dual gain pots, allowing for two different settings accessible at any time. The Gain 1/2 stomp switch is tied to the midrange frequency switch to allow for a hi mid channel at one gain setting and low mid channel at another gain setting. In addition, there are three clipping modes: Green LEDs, Red LED/1n34a, and D9Es (which some of you might recognize as klon diodes, which are cool old Russian germanium diodes).

guitarpedals,3cylul,trashboy420,2,Sat Jul 11 23:27:23 2015 UTC,"The 25k vp jr is for use with active electronics  and the other one (250k) is for passive electronics. If your pickups don't require batteries it means they're passive.   I think the MVP has minimum/maximum controls to set the parameters of the pedal. This means you can have it all the way heel down and be at unity volume if you wanted. You could also be all the way toe down and set it for a boost. I'm guessing that this function means that it does require a power source, but I'm not sure.  I have the passive VP jr. and love it. If you're just doing swells it should be perfect. I've put it in multiple different positions/orders on my board and haven't noticed any tone suck (even when using the tuner out). Generally people recommend you place it after a buffer so that it doesn't suck tone, but I don't think you'll have a problem with that if you're planning on putting it after your drive section.  All the way heel down is no volume, and all the way toe down is unity.  I think the MVP might be physically larger as well, but again, I'm not 100% sure.

guitarpedals,3cy6gf,dogratt,3,Sat Jul 11 21:07:52 2015 UTC,"This little killer pedal arrived nice and early today. I've had only about 15-20 minutes with it so far, so these are my initial thoughts. Bear in mind, the tone I'm lookinb for from this would need to fit 2 criteria - 1. Sound like a good cranked AC30 and 2. Find it's place on my board that already has a bunch of other OD/ gain pedals. It does #1 easy peasy...you don't even have to look for that setting. It's just there. You go from verge of breaking up AC30 to cranked AC30 to AC30 with a treble booster engaged, all as you turn the gain knob. Tonally for me, and ths is more to do with #2, I like it best as a cranked AC30. It's quite treble heavy and my amps are EQed in a way that it works best for me with the tone all the way down. What really gets me is the guys put a lot of thought into the dynamics of the pedal. Pick hard, you get a good grind. It's got that overdriven chime that you can only get from a big Vox amp. It helps that my VHT Special 44 is a good clean amp, but it's remarkable how Vox-like it can sound. Now here's the best thing (IMO) about the pedal. People love to claim their OD pedals are transparent. I'd say this one is faux-transparent. Pick hard, you get a good driven tone that's somewhat transparent. Lay off and the tone is even more transparent. Except this 'transparent' sound isn't of my amp when it's clean, it's a cleanish AC30 sound. This one is my second Catalinbread pedal and I really like what these guys put out. I got both used, although this one seems to have been barely played, all the packaging was pretty intact."

guitarpedals,3cxx4j,TeleFilm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:16:23 2015 UTC,"The term is ""swappable op amp design"" as a whole. An op amp (short for operational amplifier) is what's actually making the signal louder. It's the actual gain stage part of the pedal.  What the post is referring to is that the op amp chip is easily accessible by opening up the pedal, and instead of being soldered directly to the board itself, the op amp is seated in a socket and can be removed/replaced with a different op amp. This pedal is designed to have a swappable op-amp.  Why? Different op amps have different specs which theoretically affect the sound of a pedal, similar to how different tubes can affect the sound of an amp."
guitarpedals,3cxx4j,porcubot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"Based on the pedals I have, my guess is that most boutique op-amp based pedals have easily swapped, socketed IC chips. Buying a single replacement chip will run about $7.50 to $15 depending on the chip and shipping.  You can hear the difference going from a relatively noisy, low slew-rate chip to a hi-fi chip. Going from one chip to another of the same caliber, not so much."

Shane from the In The Blues youtube channel listed it as his fave OD a few years ago which why I tried it, and it's a pretty nice modded TS for $40-$55 depending on whether you get one shipped from China or not.

I think it just gave me a better understanding of what is better suited to what.  For example the Bellwether has such dark repeats that duck rather quickly, which can make such a nice washy soundscape behind what you are playing without getting overbearing, the only other pedal that does that is the keeley modded AD9, but that has very short delay times even maxed out and no mod.

The tone knob is like a hi cut, so the higher you turn it up the darker the repeats, but even when it's off, it still is very dark, and the repeats duck after the first few, so you can get long trails but they won't take over the mix.

guitarpedals,3ctdwe,rodentdp,3,Fri Jul 10 19:00:36 2015 UTC,It's actually gone from my current guitar rig and moved to my synth rig. I was using it regularly on one song with my band and occasionally in other weird spacy parts. This is the non-midi version. I got it before they released a midi one.  I think the midi one would be a lot more useful as you could synch the steps with other effects or keep it in time with other parts. It's a bit easier in the synth rig to feed it a CV and get the timing set that way.  You can here it a bit in the intro to this song.

Some stereo chorus pedals will send out vibrato in one channel if you trick it into thinking it's putting out a stereo signal. That should make it more wobbly sounding.

guitarpedals,3ct2au,DrinkyDrank,9,Fri Jul 10 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"Just got one, too. It's very cool, always discovering new things I like. I like to use it with an exp pedal, though I just use a small knob as my exp pedal to save room. Some things I've tried lately:  -Use with the latch off and pitch up 1octave. Adjust exp pedal to desired length and crank it on when you want your note/chord to fly up into the atmosphere. Sounds cool at the end of a lick. Or with harmonics.  -Leave it on but roll exp down, so effect is off. Roll in the goodness as appropriate.  -Organ sounds, especially cool with ethereal delays, ambient reverb, and volume swells. Also cool with choppy tremolo.  -Latch off. Pitch shift set at desired interval (eg. 5th up). Now playing harmonics gets creative and easier as you can quickly change what the harmonic pitches are.    There are plenty of other more obvious things you can do - just leaving it on for thickness or octaves or 12 string emulation."

This is the stuff I have been able to use musically with it so far. I'd imagine you could throw it in the effects loop of the Seymour Duncan Vapor Trails or EHX Super Ego and get some killer results from that set-up. The clearer the signal you give it, the better the tracking, always remember that with signal placement. A good fuzz before it will give you cool synth textures. A big spacious delay afterwards is fun with a fast use of the unmatched foot switch."
guitarpedals,3ct2au,YourFavBarPunk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:37:59 2015 UTC,On the one octave down setting with the blend at 100% try turning your guitar's volume all the way up and tone all the way down while using the neck pick up.  Thumb the strings while palm muting down by the bridge and you can get a pretty realistic thumpy bass sound.

guitarpedals,3ctl52,future_steak,7,Fri Jul 10 18:22:02 2015 UTC,"I think you are not far off the mark there! I've studied probably every Boss FX manual for all their gear going back to the mid-80s, and to me, they have always been stronger in the delay and chorus department than reverb. Lexicon, Eventide, and Quantec were the ""innovators"" in reverb back then, whereas Roland/Boss were more famous for their delays (SDE3000, Space Echo) and chorus (Dimension D, CE-1, etc.).   One tangible advantage that Strymon has is that some of their guys used to work for Alesis in the 90s (and I think the 2000s too), when they were doing some pretty innovative stuff.  Nevertheless, Boss does have some pretty good reverb algorithms, and I wouldn't be surprised if they are really tweaking these hardcore right now--and maybe coming up with some new ones--to be more competitive with what's out there now.  Check out my post I made the other day about this--I linked a clip of a Boss RSS ""surround"" reverb. If an RV500 comes out soon, I'm pretty sure it will have something like that onboard!"

guitarpedals,3crqkt,mxtrav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"Mids are just that, the middle frequencies. In general, amps have 3 EQ knobs that control the highs (treble), mids, and lows (bass).  Scooping mids means having your highs and lows turned up, and your mids turned down. This is common in metal guitar (think Dimebag from Pantera), not sure if it is done in any other genres much."
guitarpedals,3crqkt,bolanrox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"I know they're the mid frequencies I just couldn't identify them by ear.  My amp is set to 10,4,8 (bass, mid, treb out of 12)."
guitarpedals,3crqkt,bolanrox,3,Fri Jul 10 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"Turn up the mids, I'm sure you'll notice what gets louder.  Outside of metal (from what I've seen anyways), guitarists scoff at scooping mids because guitars are mid-frequency instruments, that's where they are supposed to be. If your mids are low, you can easily get lost in the mix of the whole band. Your highs will blend in and get overpowered by the cymbals and vocals, and your lows will get lost in the bass guitar and bass drums. Having your mids up will allow your guitar's natural frequencies to come through in the mix more because none of the other instruments usually are in that frequency range.  Edit: Also a disclaimer on this, I'm new to this as well and this is what I've gathered from reading online and playing with my own gear."
guitarpedals,3crqkt,plasticbaginthesea,2,Fri Jul 10 19:31:48 2015 UTC,"Muffs by default (minus some of the Russian Muffs of the early to mid 90's) have a scooped sound like you have now - which sounds fine on its own, but playing in a band context may cause you to get drowned out."

guitarpedals,3crqkt,kidlarge,2,Fri Jul 10 16:31:32 2015 UTC,"And just so you can think about it from a tech standpoint: Thr sound you make is made up of bass, mid, and treble frequencies. 'Scooped' is a common trait of many distorted tones, where the mids are lacking compared to the bass and treble. It sounds sick if you play by yourself, but tends to get 'lost' in a band setting because the bass guitar dominates the bass, and the treble is already being rocked by drum cymbals. So some people try to emphasize the mid frequencies of the guitar to get heard better. To 'cut through the mix'."

guitarpedals,3cqvv7,housebrickstocking,2,Fri Jul 10 13:09:54 2015 UTC,"Well it will always come down to chain... But that said...   The decimator is a hiss / hum gate with a tolerance.   If you have a ground hum that introduced the noise mostly you're right. If the hiss is your ""always on"" pre amp it should go after that. If the hiss is your boutique fuzz with no true bypass and noise filled bypass to ground put it after it. If you have a relatively quiet dry sound but you cop a big hiss because you stack gain put your gate after the gain stack where it comes in.   Basically I subscribe to the school of thought that says put the gate at the earliest part of the chain where the noise is prominent, but always before the delay, echo, or reverberation as they will draw out any noise and the gate will hurt them the most.   As always it's about the chain and sound though. Think of phase - three phase pedals - one before the wah, one between it and dirt, and one after that before the delay all sound very different and bring their own charm - there is only the final signal to judge what is right - but gate early and gate often with the gates being more specific is a good rule too."
guitarpedals,3cqvv7,elliott44k,2,Fri Jul 10 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"Ah. I understand. So if I were to place the Decimator after my Big Muff clone, the I shouldn't be getting as much hiss as I do when I engage both the Muff and the HM-2?  I'm running this through a Vox NT50 V2 and an Avatar custom 4x12 cab. My clean signal is completely quiet."
guitarpedals,3cqvv7,yomuthabyotch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:30:24 2015 UTC,"In that chain yeah that sounds like you could dial in the gate to strip the hiss out of the gain pedals... But beware the impact on the clean sound when the gain pedals were bypassed.   I've run a gate in a bypass  loop with my main two gain pedals in it, the gate and the bmp clone were always on with a booster that I'd engage separately, instead of engaging the bmp I'd engage the bypass loop and then solo with the boost down, stomp the boost to go back to dirt and stomp the loop pedal to get back to a good clean.   Hope that made sense, drunk sleep time here.."

There hasn't been a setting (even accidental ones) that sounded bad. It's authentic, natural, sustain for days fuzz. Best pedal I have ever had. I have played/had other fuzzes, but none has ever come close. I haven't gotten to play it with the amp at high vol, so stick around for my update.   Edit: so I finally had some time with this beast. Off the bat, zero feedback, zero noise. Maybe on high gain, fuzz, pre or lvl past 4-5 o clock. Clean sustained screaming fuzz, not overly saturated, or overly Saturated muddy fuzz. Wow. My mouth was literally dropped every second I played it. Went form clean fuzz pink Floyd, or dirty smashing pumpkins, to weezer, to jimi. Very articulate. By far my favorite on my board. This is the most versatile fuzz I have ever played and also the best sounding. Compared to hoof , I prefer the musket. However I paid 144 for the musket, not 200$. Before this pedal I had a tone wicker, it did not work at all for me. Too much feedback, couldn't really get more than a couple of sounds out of it, nothing great and everything at a low volume.

guitarpedals,3cng12,voidnexx,3,Thu Jul 9 07:06:01 2015 UTC,How does a brown sound pedal differ from a regular Marshall-in-a-box with the he gain dimed and the tone dialed in just right?
guitarpedals,3cng12,emptyshark,4,Thu Jul 9 08:21:35 2015 UTC,"Well I'd say the Marshall-in-a-box type pedals are purely to get your clean amp to that British crunchy distortion from the late 60's to the early 80's.  However the Brown Sound is more about honing in on that tone EVH had from about '76 on.  What he did with Power Attenuation on his Marshall essentially made the amp transform.  So I'd say that Diming a Marshall Pedal isn't exactly going to get the same desired tone.  Because EVH DID dime his amp, but he ALSO backed down the power. So he could ""run the engine on all cylinders"" while still being able to back down the master volume."
guitarpedals,3cng12,TommyGunGuitars,2,Thu Jul 9 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's the same principle. But I'm not a big fan of marshall pedals, I've tried some of them. (besides I really love their tube amps)"
guitarpedals,3cng12,marlowned,2,Thu Jul 9 08:23:52 2015 UTC,I love the Super Crunch Box because you can get that brown sound (and had the best clarity) and you can still dime it and get some JCM 800 sounds.

guitarpedals,3cng12,ChipOnly,3,Thu Jul 9 07:08:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of the Mad Professor because you can't really dial the gain down on it. I suppose if that's all you want though, then go for it. The reverb is good enough. I remember the first time I tried it I was really impressed, then I cam back and tried it again and was a little disappointed. The best part about it though is on Reverb you can regularly find them used for ~$100. So if you're only going to use it for that particular sound, it's definitely worth it, but it's kinda a one-trick pony. The others might be able to do more, but many of them are a bit more expensive."

guitarpedals,3cl3fp,tonybosca,7,Wed Jul 8 19:19:31 2015 UTC,"So interesting little story behind this one. It was one of the very first guitar effects/pedals that I owned. A family friend heard I was getting into guitar and gave it to my uncle to give to me. I had no clue how to approach this thing at that time. I was probably about 16 or so, and beyond it sounding novel and being nearly impossible for me to dial in, it was sort of set aside and mainly used for dicking around rather than any serious musical application. Years later, after getting into indie rock and noise, I tried ""playing it"" in a jam session, to see if I might get some interesting and usable glitch sounds. I had quite a few pedals during this time, and sort of knew what I was doing. It was the early 2000s, boutique effects were younger and I was awfully proud of my Keeley DS-1, Analogman TS and CMATMODS ross comp clone. ha! ...how times have changed. The project never really went anywhere and I had sort of left it in the possession of my friend. He had lent me his top loading NES (yes nintendo) and it sort of drifted into trade territory over the years. Flash forward... he has moved across country and I had been thinking about the synth since getting back into guitar pedals, and the new diverse world of effects out there... could I make better use of it now? So I asked him if he still had it, obviously he did. I had also found his NES when spring cleaning this year and we arranged for the exchange... and here we are right out of the shipping crate. I think about 10 years apart. So far it sounds better than I had remembered, super warm, super glitchy. I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with it now that ""I know what I'm doing."" ;)  He's an awfully cool dude for sending it back to me."

It has a very subtle octave built into it that fattens it up, and when palm mute playing or dialing back the volume, it gets this crazy ring modulation effect. It's one of the most versatile pedals i own."

guitarpedals,3ckwlu,daiguit91,2,Wed Jul 8 21:47:45 2015 UTC,I dont know about the DL4 but I have an Alter Ego x4 and it makes a click noise when the loop restarts. Its more noticeable when your loop is all ambient. I discovered this trying to loop an ebow drone and everytime the loop started again it made a little noise like clicking. Also it doesnt have the reverse loop function nor half speed.
guitarpedals,3ckwlu,SuperScaryBerry,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:04:34 2015 UTC,You might want to check how you power the pedal. I have no clicking problems with this pedal (Powering it through my Voodoo Lab ISO5).

I saw them in New Orleans for the first time a few months ago. They were just fantastic. I really appreciate bands that sound just as good live as they do on their recordings. I am going to see them again in Illinois and can't wait. I think it is their last stop before they head to Europe.

guitarpedals,3ckl11,bolanrox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:08:10 2015 UTC,"I've been giving a lot of thought to doing something similar; I want to pair my timeline with a big sky after it and a midi capable multieffect box in front for modulation and some other effects (pitch shifter, for instance), and still keep my dirt stage pedal chain intact, and control everything with a Boss ES-8, thus knocking out my HoF reverb, carbon copy, phase90, and harmonist from the board (might sell them, might make a flyboard with them on a pt-mini I have lying around.  Not sure yet.)  I've been looking at the line6 m9 but have seen a lot of boards with the h9, and obviously, Eventide has a great reputation.  Can you stack effects on an H9 preset or is it just one at a time?"
guitarpedals,3ckl11,technocraft,2,Thu Jul 9 11:13:28 2015 UTC,I had m9 and traded it for timeline. Unfortunately H9's biggest drawback is that it is just one effect at a time. But it sounds very next level compared to m9 of course. Thing with disaster area controllers is that they are built for strymons and are quick to set up.
guitarpedals,3ckl11,DABenStone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:21:34 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, as with most choices like this, it's a matter of different value for different priorities.  Onviously there's a threshold where the quality of the effects processing can't be dismissed regardless of the versatility on tap.  If the drop in sound quality from eventide to line6 is sufficiently manaegeable to my ears, I would value dialing in multiple fx per patch change from a midi controller over the quality of effect.  Kind of my logic behind keeping my dirt stage intact with individual pedals and not a modeling box (though I know the m9 can do dirt as well); digital emulation of dirt still has a way to go to match what's possible with digital emulations of delays, mods, and filters, I feel.  Thanks for the food for thought, though!"

guitarpedals,3cmqi7,King0fthejuice,4,Thu Jul 9 02:48:46 2015 UTC,Have you considered a clean boost in front of it? A Micro Amp or LPB-1 are good bets. They will boost the gain without altering the character of the tone or EQ.
guitarpedals,3cmqi7,theflyingjib,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:13:23 2015 UTC,"I second this.  I use the BBE Boosta Grande with my Green Rhino, and it's great.  I got it for like $40 on eBay too."

Would it be worth having the fb-2 and some other preamp?"
guitarpedals,3cmqi7,koalaroo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:19:41 2015 UTC,"Consider a treble booster before the rhino as well. That should add some grit while also changing up the sound so it really jumps out. Or you could try one after.

guitarpedals,3cmqi7,jtm5098,3,Thu Jul 9 05:46:33 2015 UTC,"I do this exact thing with a Green Rhino and a Pork Loin, the clean blend with some overdrive provides just enough dirt to make things interesting."

guitarpedals,3cjfit,PantslessDan,4,Wed Jul 8 18:57:56 2015 UTC,"Did they really corner the market, though?"
guitarpedals,3cjfit,RushofBlood52,4,Wed Jul 8 17:01:30 2015 UTC,Cornered was probably a bad way to make my point. Strymon and eventide accessed the market of people who want really feature intensive delays and reverbs and it seems like Boss is one of the first larger builders to tap into that market as well.
guitarpedals,3cjfit,PantslessDan,4,Wed Jul 8 18:57:14 2015 UTC,"I mean Boss has had the DD-20. And Eventide also having the TimeFactor goes against ""cornering the market."" And then there's still the DL4, M9, DelayLab and its successor, DigiTech TimeBender. Basically, this type of large delay multi-effects isn't a new market to penetrate."
guitarpedals,3cjfit,RushofBlood52,0,Wed Jul 8 19:26:06 2015 UTC,"Strymon definitely did at least help ""cement"" or ""solidify"" this market!   To me, ""Round One"" of ""superdelay"" pedals started around 2002, when Yamaha released the (brilliant!) UD-Stomp, but due to its complexity and ""old-school"" rack programming interface, it didn't really catch on, and I think it scared away a lot of companies from really making a ""deep"" delay pedal that could compete with rack units. After a few more years of some smaller delays with ""extras"" getting popular (like the DD-20), ""Round Two"" started with Eventide and the Timefactor (2007), and while that did really get the ball rolling, the introduction of the Timeline really proved that it was a viable market now, since both units sold so well (and continue to, with few upgrades!). I think the success of both of those pedals is what signaled to everybody that this was a safe bet now, and that's why Korg, Pigtronix, and now (finally) Boss have jumped in too. TC has jumped in too, in a different way though (with the added functionality of the Toneprint editor--which looks a lot like controls you'd find in rack units).  Why did Round Two work, and Round One failed so miserably, even with an amazing product? The difference, I think, had mostly to do with the fact that for these ""Second Gen"" pedals, if you found a preset you liked and wanted to do some tweaks on it, you could do so pretty easily, mostly with the same basic knowledge that you'd gained from using other delay pedals. However, on the ""First Gen"" pedals (UD-Stomp and the Magicstomp), if you wanted to make some tweaks, you would have to tweak modulation rates, depths, pans, levels, filters, audio phases, tap routing, etc. for EACH of the 8 delays on there, and know exactly what you were doing, or everything could fall apart really fast. If Yamaha had figured this out and at least made some more ""user-friendly"" modes and ""templates,"" it would have been a much bigger success, I think. Instead, it was kind of like using one of those big Eventides, but worse, since there were no custom-made menus or controls to make quick changes from (Eventide rack presets are deep but they are easily controllable from the front panel--a lot of their presets are just as simple to operate as pedals!).  One thing that really intrigues me about the DD-500 is that the website mentions it has ""separate control for each of the 16 delays lines"" in the Pattern mode. This sounds cryptic to me, and can mean a LOT of things, but I'm still holding out hope that it can replicate a lot of what the UD-Stomp could do. Even if it can't, Boss is really going to change the game with this pedal, I think, because it's adding some more optional complexity that some users will really appreciate, and add a lot of possibilities you can't find in any other pedals (the 4-band parametric EQ is brilliant!)."
guitarpedals,3cjfit,analogkid85,0,Thu Jul 9 04:41:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight!
guitarpedals,3cjfit,PantslessDan,-1,Thu Jul 9 13:23:28 2015 UTC,"Hopefully they are working on it as we speak! I'd LOVE to see an RV500--Boss/Roland have some really great reverb algorithms going back to the 90s (SRV-330 Dimensional Reverb) and even the 80s (DEP-5, SRV2000). They are definitely in a place to compete, but their algorithms (in my opinion) still need some tweaks and improvements to really get to the level of the BigSkys and SPACEs of the world. The one sound I really haven't heard from a Boss reverb yet is the super-diffused kind of sound you get in the ""Bloom"" model (BigSky) or the ""Black Hole"" (SPACE)--hopefully they are working on something like that, because that's very sought-after now, apart from the ""traditional"" verbs (which they already have a lot of experience with). Based on the clips I've heard, Boss is more than ready to make great shimmer sounds. Where Boss will really be head-and-shoulders above the rest, though, is in ""3D"" imaging, as they could implement their proprietary ""RSS"" surround algorithms (you had to pay BIG money for these in the early 90s! with dedicated machines just for that). To date, I think Boss might have this in one pedal (the Slicer--and I'm not even 100% sure about that), and this would be a great way to show it off again, since so many players are going stereo now with their effects and want the biggest ""effect"" possible. It would probably sound something like this demo, of an RSS reverb (Preset name: ""Blizzard"") from their SX-700 rack unit:   Boss SX-700--""Blizzard"" clip   (don't listen to that through your phone's speakers! headphones or desktop speakers are a must, otherwise you won't hear the effect)  That SRV330 I mentioned, I believe, is where the Modulate mode from the RV-5 came from! (there's a thread here that really goes into why I think this is where it came from). I'm sure that if an RV500 does get made, it will have this sound, but with a LOT of tweaks, just like in the rack version."

guitarpedals,3cjfit,holladaddy,3,Wed Jul 8 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"The PS-6 is just better than the PS-5 in much the same way.  Tracking, features, harmony options."
guitarpedals,3cjfit,Ultramerican,2,Thu Jul 9 03:50:53 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense. The way I use mine never really justified the price jump though I guess.
guitarpedals,3cjfit,holladaddy,3,Thu Jul 9 03:54:45 2015 UTC,"I would have never bought one normally but someone here posted that GC was clearing their store level Boss displays and had insane used deals.  I got a DS-1 for $15 and a PS-6 for $70.  I use it for static chorus (detune blend) and low octave fuzzy stuff.  The chorus effect is really clear and great for 80s sounds like The Cars.  I'll also use it to loop a bass line while jamming.  3 part harmony is really rad though.  Insta-Boston.  Edit:  also cool, Analog delays can do chorusy sounds by setting them at 0 delay time, one repeat, and blend evenly.  I like ghetto chorus setups apparently."
guitarpedals,3cjfit,Ultramerican,2,Thu Jul 9 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I used to do that with my Memory Boy. That was a great vibrato/chorus/weird octaver with the right settings.  That's cool though, I'm glad it works out. I got a ridiculous $60 deal on a Whammy 5 so I actually like the PS-5's t-arm and weird tracking in upper octaves because I have smooth tracking readily available."
guitarpedals,3cjfit,holladaddy,3,Thu Jul 9 04:03:24 2015 UTC,Is t arm like a whammy shift with the tweakable rise/fall time?
guitarpedals,3cjfit,Ultramerican,2,Thu Jul 9 04:14:43 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what it is. You can adjust the pitch it bends to and the rate it goes at

guitarpedals,3ckhrv,thesklopp,2,Wed Jul 8 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"This is my second Walrus Audio pedal, and it sounds great.  Been looking for a new overdrive for a while.  This one caught my eye because it can be fairly transparent while in low gain, but I can still crank it to get some heavy noise.  It is a little noisy, but I am using a 1Spot, which is discouraged with there pedals, but I hope to change that soon.  Plus I saw it came in pearl and gold to match my Deep Six, so how could I resist."
guitarpedals,3ckhrv,koalaroo,2,Wed Jul 8 16:58:17 2015 UTC,Love the matching colors! Haven't heard much about the harvester though. Is it like a lower gain version of the mayflower?
guitarpedals,3clawq,Magical_Bananas,4,Wed Jul 8 20:10:26 2015 UTC,"Also check out the VOX DelayLab. Delay with 30 different delay sounds, 30 different save-able presets (3 switches, plus 10 bank ups), and a 30 second looper on it similar to the DL4's. I got it a month ago and it's my new favorite pedal."
guitarpedals,3clawq,Arsid,4,Wed Jul 8 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"The Headrush is one of the most intuitive, easy to use loopers I've played with. If you're just using it for bedroom use the fact you won't be able to store loops probably won't be a disadvantage, but may be for most. But I love it live, from using it for loops to switching to delay modes. You could probably pick one up used and still have some leftover for a separate delay pedal."
guitarpedals,3clawq,EumenidesTrousers,2,Wed Jul 8 20:44:52 2015 UTC,The headrush is a great pedal but it is a 15 year old digital pedal and does show it's age. I will often bump up against the max loop time and it is annoying that you can't change the delay time without introducing artifacts. That being said you can score them for quite cheap and would definitely recommend it for something to get started and play around with.
guitarpedals,3clawq,scramblor,4,Wed Jul 8 23:03:37 2015 UTC,I must add the boss dd7. I use mine solely as a 40 second looper but the analog delay is great too. Pretty cheap and sturdy.
guitarpedals,3clawq,gadgetprop,2,Wed Jul 8 20:23:41 2015 UTC,Do you think the lack of a dedicated stop button hinders you? Or is it easy to loop anyway?
guitarpedals,3clawq,palle97,2,Wed Jul 8 21:24:14 2015 UTC,"I have the Flashback x4, with dedicated stop and record switches. But i think it won't matter too much in your bedroom. You don't need to go out of your way have dedicated switches"
guitarpedals,3clawq,the_who321,2,Wed Jul 8 21:52:50 2015 UTC,Try the Boss Giga Delay
guitarpedals,3clawq,Humus,3,Thu Jul 9 21:59:07 2015 UTC,"I'd go for a delay which has a looper on it, provided it's not too limited. I used to use a boss rc-2 which was so much fun. Really useful to be able to save stuff.   However, I recently bought a flashback x4 and i've been using the looper on that, and it's so good. It has a dedication 'one time' button (press it while your loop's playing and it'll finish and then stop instead of continuing looping, or you can press it when to start a loop and let it play once only) and you can undo and redo as well. It can't record loops quite as long as a dedicated looper, but it's pretty long (40 seconds, compared to the 16 seconds with the line 6 DL4). I enjoy looping stuff and playing over, and if I think of something I like, I quickly record it on my phone, so for me I have no need to save loops.   The only thing I find annoying on the X4 is that on looper mode you can't use the presets you have saved, but instead it defaults to whatever your knobs are set at, which is okay if you have time to dial something in. If you're willing to chuck in a bit more money I'd imagine it would be good to have a mini ditto looper, that way you can use delays you have saved without worrying. Also, you don't have to bend down to flick the switch between delay to looper - I know that sounds silly but in a live situation it gets annoying."
guitarpedals,3clawq,DodgingMonkey,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats a problem I spotted too. I believe the dl4 and dd20/500 allow you to use presets while looping so I may look into those, but the looping time (at least on the dl4) is much less. Do you end up using the toneprint feature quite a bit? or is it more of a gimmicky 'try once' type feature?"
guitarpedals,3clawq,DodgingMonkey,3,Thu Jul 9 04:38:50 2015 UTC,"""I believe the dl4 and dd20/500 allow you to use presets while looping[...]""  If you mean loop and use delay at the same time, the dl4 cannot do this."

guitarpedals,3clawq,housebrickstocking,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:51 2015 UTC,"Well, i've toneprint a few times, but I don't ever really have any need to because it's easy to just get what you want with the pedal, and most of the toneprints are just pretty regular sounding, anyway. I would recommend getting something that can record more time than the DL4 to be honest, it really is quite limiting. I can definitely recommend the X4 as an owner of one, and i'm sure the alter ego version is very good, too. Personally I went for the X4 because the alter ego leans towards modulation type delay whereas if I want a bit of that I have modulation pedals."

guitarpedals,3cjske,TeleFilm,3,Thu Jul 9 01:35:33 2015 UTC,"I crank the Gain on the BD-2 and lower the volume knob on my guitar to get a nice clean tone.  To get my crunchy overdriven tone I just turn the volume up on my guitar.  Thus, when my guitar is turned down its like a clean boost with a very light crunch to it."
guitarpedals,3cjske,RushofBlood52,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"I really like this use of it. It's a cool way to get two gain stages and then that saves the other OD for a lead boost. Although it nearly blew my head off when i turned the guitar from half volume to full volume with the pedal's tone all the way open! It's a surprisingly dirty pedal compared to what I was expecting. I was only intending to use it as an always on bit of crunch to my cleans, but it does a full gain tone incredibly well."
guitarpedals,3cjske,TeleFilm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:22:34 2015 UTC,You crank the gain but then remove it? What? Why not just not crank the gain?
guitarpedals,3cjske,TeleFilm,6,Wed Jul 8 16:59:48 2015 UTC,So I can have a clean boost and some gain by the turn of my volume knob.  Learned this trick from Tim Pierce.
guitarpedals,3cjske,mississippiboogaloo,2,Wed Jul 8 17:06:19 2015 UTC,I should also add that the BD-2 is the only drive pedal on my board.
guitarpedals,3cjske,RushofBlood52,4,Wed Jul 8 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"Because he then has more control over the gain via the volume knob.  The pedal can now produce multiple gain stages instead of full gain. Lots of players, including me, do this."
guitarpedals,3cjske,ZeligtheAxMan,2,Wed Jul 8 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't that also be a volume boost? Why not have a clean signal with volume knob up all the way and then crank both the volume and gain of the pedal? I get what it does and that it's an option, but it seems like more steps than necessary to handle the same function."
guitarpedals,3cjske,TeleFilm,3,Wed Jul 8 17:09:10 2015 UTC,Definitely not the same function. TeleFilm's technique allows for a range if sounds all controlled on the spot from the volume (and I assume tone) knobs of his guitar.  E.g. In a live play setting he can move from clean verse to dirty chorus with the flick of a finger. Then if he wants a medium gain boost for a solo he just back it up a little. Maybe play another verse somehwerin between those. It's all about dynamic control.
guitarpedals,3cjske,ZeligtheAxMan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't like the clean signal with my volume knob all the way up because it's too harsh/loud.  It sounds a little more well rounded with the volume rolled down a bit around 6-7.  I learned this idea from Eric Clapton.  Pretty sure he always has his volume knob around 6-7 and turns it up if he wants to be louder.    Hendrix would do the same thing with his volume knob and Fuzz Face.    I also learned this trick from Tim Pierce who is an amazing studio guitarist.  After realizing a lot of my favorite guitarists use this simple trick then I decided to use it as well.  It helps my BD-2 stay on all the time!"
guitarpedals,3cjske,TeleFilm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:42:56 2015 UTC,I wonder if you guys could tell me what guitars/pedals you use. I've often tried to give myself this kind of set up and come up short.  I wonder if the volume pots on my guitars just don't have a good sweep or am I setting up the pedals/amps wrong.  Whenever I try I go from very quite and weak sounding (like not usable). Straight to full on gain with not much in between.

There is no sonic difference between different types of normal silicon diodes and there is no quality upgrade to be made.

guitarpedals,3ciyod,owen__wilsons__nose,2,Wed Jul 8 12:34:00 2015 UTC,I was also about to buy a Timeline but got cold feet after seeing this! what do you guys think?
guitarpedals,3ciyod,analogkid85,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:34:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth the wait. I've been programming delays on rack gear for a few years now and I'm just salivating over all the features they put into this one, like the 4-band parametric EQ.  I'm probably going to make a special post soon, to take requests from people on what presets they might want, and then I'll post the files here. I'm pretty excited about the possibilities of this unit. From what I can gather so far, it's in ""God tier"" delay land as far as programmability goes, up there with only the Yamaha UD-Stomp and the Magicstomp. And it sounds gorgeous! The 32-bit sampling is just sublime. It sounds ""cripser"" than most other delay pedals out there.  Have you heard the audio clips yet?"
guitarpedals,3ciyod,SuperScaryBerry,9,Mon Jul 13 00:50:07 2015 UTC,Ah so this is what's replacing the DD-20.
guitarpedals,3ciyod,MinusTheFire,9,Wed Jul 8 10:37:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the official Boss product page if anyone wants more info like I did  This pedal has me incredibly excited now, as I've been missing the hell out certain features on the DD-20 but I didn't want to go back to having only 3 savable patches.  The DelayLab that I'm currently using has a ton of great features, but I've been absolutely sick of the thing's massive hulking size for longer than I care to admit.  I like the Timeline, but wasn't ready to commit to the money required to get one of those when I knew it still wouldn't have the few DD-20 features that I really wanted.  Basically, this thing has everything I've been wanting in a delay for a quite a long time."

guitarpedals,3ciyod,analogkid85,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"Oh it most definitely will have it! Boss puts this on all their rack stuff and the DD-20, so there's like a 99% chance that will be on there. Even the 20-tap delay from the VF-1 allowed you to select a subdivision for each tap!"

Standard—Clear digital delay.  •Analog—Emulates classic analog “BBD” delays like the BOSS DM series.  •Tape—Emulates the warm sound of tape-based delay units, including the Maestro Echoplex and legendary Roland RE-201 Space Echo.  •Vintage Digital—Emulations of early digital delays from the 1980s, including Roland’s famous SDE-2000 and SDE-3000 rack units and the BOSS DD-2, the original stompbox digital delay.  •Dual—Two different delay lines that can be connected in series or parallel.  •Pattern—Sixteen different delay lines that can be set independently for all types of unique rhythmic effects.  •Reverse—Backwards delay for cool psychedelic effects and other unique tones.  •SFX—“Special effects” delay with a highly unique sound character.  •Shimmer—Pitch-shifted delays for lush, heavenly textures.  •Filter—Delay with a sweeping filter.  •Slow Attack—Ethereal delays that fade in with playing dynamics.  •Tera Echo—Spacious, animated ambience effect derived from the innovative BOSS TE-2 pedal."

guitarpedals,3ciyod,analogkid85,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:55:42 2015 UTC,"You will probably get some reverb sounds out of that Pattern mode--it has 16 delay taps! The Strymon, by comparison, has 10, and that can already do some very convincing reverb sounds (check out Italo de Angelis' website--he has created some great sounds with the Pattern mode in his FX Soundworks section). Boss is no stranger to multitap delays (the SE-70 and VF-1 both had 20-tap delays, for instance), and if there are some nice ""bells and whistles""--modulation, filtering, diffusion, etc.--then I think it will be able to create some nice reverbs indeed ;)  Not the ""traditional"" halls and chambers and all that, but still some very inspiring spaces, ones that won't sound as resonant as the ""afterthought"" reverb on the (otherwise excellent) Roland Space Echo."

guitarpedals,3ciyod,ThaddeusRoss,3,Wed Jul 8 13:39:50 2015 UTC,"All modes have hold/twist plus a ""roll"" effect which slows the delay to half time."

guitarpedals,3ciyod,Mustachioshreds7,2,Thu Jul 9 13:15:22 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Okay guys, we all know this pedal looks amazing, but I have one very important question to ask before making an offer to purchase as you all should too before we call it a Strymon Timeline comparative.  Is this pedal a true dual delay? Meaning, can you have a dotted eighth note and quarter note delay setting to play simultaneously? Much like the Strymon Timeline. It says it has a ""dual delay setting"". I own the Boss DD20 Giga Delay and it has that same setting and I assure you that it is NOT a real dual delay.  Basically, if this new Boss pedal can do the TRUE dual delay function like the Strymon Timeline, I will buy this right away! I looked all over Boss's website and couldn't find anything about this topic. I fear they are dodging that. Thank you!!! I hope someone knows!"
guitarpedals,3ciyod,analogkid85,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"I think you are safe here--ever since tap tempo was introduced into the Boss rack units in the mid-90s (SDE-330, etc.), they have included a subdivision option for each delay tap on pretty much ALL gear released since then, with the exception of the single-sized stompbox pedals (DD-3/5/7/etc.). I would be shocked if that feature wasn't included here. The 20-tap delay on the VF-1 included subdivision options for all 20 taps!  I would also be shocked if the Dual delay function was not a true dual-delay--with two delay lines--like on the Eventide Timefactor, DIG, Nova Delay/Repeater, etc.  Almost every Boss rack delay--RSP550, VF-1, SE-70, SX/GX-700, SDE-330--has included a true dual delay (with two delay lines & independent feedback), always with high-cut filters (in the feedback path), and sometimes with low-cut filters, modulation, and even cross-feedback. I would not be surprised to see all of these features pop up here, because so far, it looks like they are ""pulling out all the stops""!  Even more than the pedal itself, I just wish they would release the manual! I hope they release it beforehand, so I can start thinking about how I want to craft the presets I want to build, and what the possibilities are."

guitarpedals,3ciyod,holladaddy,2,Wed Jul 8 22:41:48 2015 UTC,The looper on this is more readily available than the DL4 one and it looks like it has all the delay modes active when using it as well

guitarpedals,3chrui,_TurboGro_,3,Wed Jul 8 09:13:09 2015 UTC,"Looks great! Minor tip to consider: try noise gate before delay. It won't kill the quieter repeats that way, but it'll still kill the guitar/OD buzz. Do you like the mooer noise gate?"
guitarpedals,3chrui,jacksonprince,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:59:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. I like the mooer a lot. Does the job perfectly and is very compact. Would definitely recommend.

guitarpedals,3cj46t,richie_d,5,Wed Jul 8 08:49:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes guitarists think a pedal is not working properly when the problem really lies with the power supply. Batteries offer a cheap and clean solution.   Hope this video helps to demonstrate why.   Of course, this is just a simple introduction to the topic. What are YOUR preferences for pedal power?"
guitarpedals,3cj46t,2k4s,4,Wed Jul 8 08:53:26 2015 UTC,"I think an important thing to consider is that your pedals are part of an integrated system. The guitar, the cables, the pedals, the amp, the wall plug, the other things plugged into the same electrical circuit, all contribute to the signal path. Think of it as a river that we all live on the banks of and use for food and drink and transportation. If there is a factory dumping chemicals into the river, it's going to effect everyone to varying degrees depending on whether you are up or downstream, what you use the river for, how close you are to the bank, etc. Power and your pedals have a similar relationship. There could be one pedal that is poorly designed or malfunctioning which is corrupting the signal path for everyone, there could be noise coming from a power supply that most pedals can reject or isolate from the signal path except for this one pedal. There can be a pedal or guitar or amp that is not grounded or shielded properly. There can be a differential which is causing hum. Using a battery instead of a power supply could possibly fix one of these issues, maybe not. The more parts you have to your system the more complicated it gets."
guitarpedals,3cj46t,SuperScaryBerry,8,Wed Jul 8 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"While this may fix the problem. Once you begin to use upwards of 3 pedals this doesn't really become a cost effective solution. In my opinion - buy once, cry once. Get yourself a nice isolated power supply (Voodoo Lab, T-rex, Walrus Audio) that will last you a long time. You won't regret it, and neither will your wallet."
guitarpedals,3cj46t,SuperScaryBerry,2,Wed Jul 8 10:34:26 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. Of course, if you're only running a couple of overdrive/distortion pedals then rechargeable batteries are a reasonable solution."
guitarpedals,3cj46t,EumenidesTrousers,3,Wed Jul 8 10:41:51 2015 UTC,Yep that's true.  Fuzz Pedals are also very kind on batteries. My Big Muff Pi has lasted ages on one.

guitarpedals,3cj46t,ggyiay-oppay,2,Wed Jul 8 11:26:43 2015 UTC,I use batteries in the studio.  But live? On a regular basis? Fuck that
guitarpedals,3cj46t,ggyiay-oppay,3,Thu Jul 9 23:59:33 2015 UTC,"I think the important question is what power supply are you using? Is it a supply designed for pedals from diago etc, or a cheap multi purpose one that goes straight to the wall."
guitarpedals,3cj46t,holladaddy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:12:39 2015 UTC,"Cheap multi-purpose one that beginners would typically use.   Mind you, I have had issues in the past with more expensive power supplies, so it's something that can crop up at different price and quality levels.   You'd be shocked."
guitarpedals,3cj46t,holladaddy,8,Wed Jul 8 10:18:13 2015 UTC,"You'd be shocked.  Given the circumstances, hopefully not.  I would still advise beginners to pick up a proper supply. Not just because over time it will probably save them money but also because it's better for the environment."
guitarpedals,3cj46t,holladaddy,2,Wed Jul 8 10:30:26 2015 UTC,A good quality power supply can be an expensive item though. I see that in the long run you save money but in the short term many players might not have the cash.
guitarpedals,3cj46t,heidensieck,6,Wed Jul 8 10:44:51 2015 UTC,"If cash is an issue, batteries aren't a good option because they're a recurring expense. Getting something like a OneSpot and a good power strip/surge protector with some degree of filtering is the best option for budget players. Digital pedals will drain batteries in days, and batteries are cheap enough for a one time transaction- but over time you'll end up spending the same amount or more anyways. Better to go with the up front cost.  Even something like the inexpensive Joyo power supply seems to be a good enough option for people to consider. A lot of ground noise can come from a person's house or apartment wiring or a bad unfiltered surge protector."
guitarpedals,3cj46t,heidensieck,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:26:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for your thoughts. What's your experience with the Joyo power supply? My first instinct was that it was too cheap to be any good!
guitarpedals,3cj46t,ThaddeusRoss,3,Wed Jul 8 15:37:24 2015 UTC,"I don't actually own it. But I own both boutique Voodoo Lab power supplies and a OneSpot daisy chain and I can tell you the difference in noise isn't worth the $150 between prices on those. The OneSpot isn't convenient for pedalboard organization though, so that's where I get the feeling that the Joyo one will be fine for most people.  What's cool about the Voodoo Lab PP2+? The dip switches for variable current output and that's about it. And I only have about two pedals that matter for it. I wish I had been a bit more realistic when I bought my two of them because they really don't improve my sound or my organization that much."
guitarpedals,3cj46t,ThaddeusRoss,2,Wed Jul 8 16:01:03 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting, thanks for sharing this.   I will look into the Joyo, but I've also been investigating the Sanyo Pedal Juicer which is a lithium battery (or some equally scientific doo-dah) that you can charge up and then use to power pedals with clean DC power. One way or another I just love batteries!"
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,Excuse_My_ADD,13,Wed Jul 8 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"There is something to be said for strymon as a company though. They created most of the algorithms and dsp's from scratch, and each pedal is hand built in the states. Boss has been in the game for awhile now and probably repurposed a bunch of their existing algorithms (like the tera echo), and each of their units is factory made in China. I'm not saying one is better than the other, just pointing out some of the differences. I think strymon will be fine, and it may force them to up their game or lower their prices a bit."
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,PantslessDan,0,Wed Jul 8 20:17:16 2015 UTC,Strymon will be totally fine. I'm just wondering how they plan to address (or not address) people with Timelines who are prob gonna be like WTF.   I already know I'm an idiot so I'm not going to rage about being sold on hype
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,PantslessDan,12,Wed Jul 8 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"Strymon doesn't have to address shit. You willingly bought their pedal and it's not their fault if something you like better comes along in the future.   Also, the thing was just announced this morning so there's still plenty we don't know about how it will perform compared to the Timeline. The strymon may still have the upper hand in a handful of features or overall sound quality. Will it be $150 better? Who knows."

guitarpedals,3ckwm9,PantslessDan,-7,Wed Jul 8 20:56:41 2015 UTC,Do you usually buy inferior goods for inflated prices?  Seems like a bad M.O.
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,Ultramerican,2,Thu Jul 9 03:24:59 2015 UTC,"By what metric are you judging the Timeline as inferior? Expensive sure, but I'm also speaking in terms of money being little to no object.   I'm just referring to the fact that I prefer to support smaller companies that hand build their products in Canada or the US. I do it in all aspects of my life like clothes, guitars, other audio gear, etc. I generally don't substitute quality for location of production. Also, I'm not necessarily saying that strymon is better quality than boss, boss has a stellar track record when it comes to QC."

guitarpedals,3ckwm9,DrSlapstick,15,Thu Jul 9 04:01:59 2015 UTC,"I don't see why this is a big development. If anything, it shows just how inflated in price the Timeline was from the start."
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,holladaddy,3,Wed Jul 8 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"Or the cost was fine for when it was released.  It's been how many years now since it was initially released?  If I bought a car, and then four years later cars had more features for cheaper, it doesn't mean I made a bad decision back then.  It just means that from here on out you have more options :)"
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,DrSlapstick,5,Wed Jul 8 21:09:42 2015 UTC,"Cars depreciate in price when they're used for a ton of reasons, not just that newer cars are made.   Pedals that had the same features and quality of the Timeline existed when it came out too and costed about $300 less and arguably even in the case that they weren't as feature heavy at least balanced their price based on their relative function.   A Timeline is a DL4/FlashbackX4/AlterEgo/DelayLab/DD20 with slightly different presets, a different way to switch them and a MIDI command function. It's not like the DD500 is that different than a Timeline either- it's just not inflated in price as much because Boss knows how much it takes to produce that product and knows they can undercut it."
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,holladaddy,2,Wed Jul 8 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand my argument -  I'm not talking depreciation for used assets, I'm talking about the fact that the price made sense back then.  New stuff inevitably comes out that will make things designed years ago look dated and drive down the used price (and force Strymon to update things or pull down the new price).  If the price wasn't worth it, they wouldn't have sold so damn many of them.  I get that you don't think it's worth it, but that's an opinion, and evidently enough people disagree that they made a shit-ton of money off of it."
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,DrSlapstick,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"I just gave a good explanation of why the price wasn't making sense back then either. Stuff designed before the Timeline was still on par with the Timeline with features and audio/effect quality at lower prices.  Things don't sell on merit alone. Strymon is a company with great marketing. That's a good thing for them. But since I'm not applying to work for them, I don't really care that much about that."
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,bolanrox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"I know guys with tens of thousands of dollars of sponsored gear who paid for their Timelines because they wanted/needed the features.  If you think you can do the same thing with cheaper stuff, go ahead, but again, that's your opinion.  Even if your opinion is correct and it's just ""marketing"" or ""brand identity"", Strymon would have been idiots to sell for $300 what they can sell for $450."
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,negligibletalent,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:44:46 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you on either point. I bought an overpriced/probably overhyped pedal and they don't owe me anything.

guitarpedals,3ckwm9,DigitalMystik,7,Wed Jul 8 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"This pedal sounds really good, but with all guitar gear, you get out of it what you put in; Tom Morello has already done such amazing things with one simple DD-3 and a lot of imagination. I, one day, hope to live in a world where all delay pedals can peacefully coexist on boards without being called inferior to another. If you're viewing this thread, you probably agree that delay is awesome, but for most applications the audience won't give a damn or realize what difference a tweakable modulation section or analog vs tape vs digital delay sound will make in a live mix. All the best rock songs have already been written and you won't hear a timeline, timefactor, or dd-500 anywhere on em."
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,tonebreaker,-3,Wed Jul 8 20:13:19 2015 UTC,as ridiculous as this might sound...your very valid perspective is on the actual use of pedals and the type of value that transcends the price tag...whereas my commentary was strictly about feeling like I got shafted and not wanting to sound bitter
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,meowmeowman,4,Wed Jul 8 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I don't think you got shafted if you own a Timeline. I think the DD500 sounds will be on par with the timeline and the timefactor and the features and ease of use will dictate which pedal is right for the user. Plus, if the DD500 feels more you, you can just sell your timeline for $30 less than what you paid for it and buy a DD500. Not too shabby."
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,Redkid280,3,Wed Jul 8 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"I love my Timeline. I don't know that the DD-500 would have inspired me to create the things I have created on the Timeline. It may inspire me to create very different things, so I can't regret spending more than necessary on a delay unit since I feel I'm getting a good value return on investment from the Timeline anyway (though admittedly that return is not $$$)."
guitarpedals,3ckwm9,spencerkopp,7,Fri Jul 10 04:00:34 2015 UTC,"The thing hasn't even been put in customer's hands. Let's see how the reviews go. I've been a Timeline user for nearly 3 years and I didn't GAS over the DD-500. Looks cool, sounds cool. And who knows, maybe it will force the Timeline to offer significant firmware updates if it's really great.  On the other hand, Strymon hasn't lost steam. I just got the DIG yesterday and it is an incredible machine."
guitarpedals,3chp64,Lous98,3,Wed Jul 8 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"I love intensity hard left and speed at 9 O clock. Perfect for adding variation to a fingerpicking part or a short chord progression. I like a phaser to add color and variation slowly over time.    I think it sounds better pre dirt. There's definitely something to be said about a slow phaser after delay, though."

guitarpedals,3chp64,duffmcshark,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:11:07 2015 UTC,I like it pre-distortion.  As for settings... Just choose one of the four that you like the most at the moment and set the rate.  Slow and with the smaller circles is a good starting point.
guitarpedals,3cih0w,Killthekeywork,3,Wed Jul 8 04:07:56 2015 UTC,"Typically, yes, but the rat is versatile enough to use as a low gain boost for dirty amps or a roaring saturated fuzz into a clean tone."
guitarpedals,3cih0w,negligibletalent,2,Wed Jul 8 04:14:40 2015 UTC,"Like most have said it's all down to preference and your own experimentation. The pedal itself is really versatile and will take some punishment whatever.  I've been messing quite heavily with mine lately. I've come away with a few favourites setting the RAT at a key point (gain/dist set low at 9 o'clock, filter around 2/3 o'clock. All running into a Line 6 DT25 set up to emulate a Marshall Plexi with some the drive at noon, so far I'm mostly fond of;  Boss EQ > RAT - Using a humbucking guitar, if the EQ is rigged right it gets quite snappy and behaves like I'd expect a single coiled strat to so. Really good with a nice delay, and allows the light breakup to really shine through. Without the EQ you get much of the same, but obviously it's for you to tool around with the EQ to get something that you really like out of it.  TS9 > RAT - Big sound, ideal for big Alice in Chains sort of tone if you're pushing a guitar with half/full step down. Can't get enough of it.   Just mess with it and see what you come out with though at the end of the day, you can't really go wrong with it."
guitarpedals,3cih0w,frotographer,2,Wed Jul 8 15:01:04 2015 UTC,Yeah - pushing the clean channel on a tube amp is the typical dirt pedal use.  There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's though.
guitarpedals,3cih0w,Ultramerican,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:18:49 2015 UTC,Using the clean side will allow you to listen to the rat best.
guitarpedals,3cih0w,Chorizomebro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:18:00 2015 UTC,if you want?  it will work either way depends on what sound you like / are going for
guitarpedals,3cih0w,bolanrox,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:29:35 2015 UTC,The general principle is to use a distortion pedal into a clean amp so that you hear the fuzz of the pedal.   But you can do whatever sounds best to you in the context of whatever song or ditty you're playing.
guitarpedals,3cgceu,Tman5293,3,Tue Jul 7 18:17:58 2015 UTC,"With all due respect:  If you have that much money invested in a pedal board, you need both a noise gate/cancel pedal AND a much better power supply...you will notice an improvement in tone and a deduction is bypass noise instantly. Do yourself the favor!"
guitarpedals,3cgceu,bimmybommer,2,Wed Jul 8 04:31:14 2015 UTC,I will absolutely look into it. Thank you for the recommendation. I have been considering a power supply upgrade recently. Do you have recommendations for that or for a decent noise gate?
guitarpedals,3cgceu,bimmybommer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"Sure thing.  I recently invested in a Decibel Eleven Hot Stone SMD...it hushed my board like a crusty old librarian, post-book fair. Had to have been assisted by my pedal board wiring kit (lava cable ultramafic), both had a really good effect on increasing tone transparency and silencing noise.  As far as a gate/silencer...really depends on the sound you are aiming for. A noise gate will allow the noise through while your playing, but a canceler is most useful for cutting the noise out of the signal altogether. So if you are metal-ish and can use the noise....go gate (can't recommend, never used one). If you are doing something else that I can't imagine otherwise but is dope regardless, and want to lose some extra noise....go canceler (ISP Technologies decimator, imo)."
guitarpedals,3cgceu,bimmybommer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:53:46 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks again for the recommendations. I will have to consult my wallet before I buy anything though since I just bought the Strymon BigSky and a BOSS FV-500H. My wallet is not happy with me right now.

guitarpedals,3cgkov,bryantheyounger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"What would you use it for?  I have a radial bigshot ABY to switch between amps.  That pedal is nice because it has the isolation needed to get rid of ground loop hum.    This allows me to switch between my synthesizer [microbrute] and guitar.  Then I use the radial to go between amps, and after my amp chain I have loop pedals on both sides so I can loop bass lines on a bass amp, and guitar on my other amp."
guitarpedals,3cgkov,Spaceshipable,2,Tue Jul 7 22:05:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, I haven't logged in for a few days. I'd be using one for a similar application switching between a synth and guitar. I love how my synth sounds through my pedalboard and through my amp setup, so I just need a switch let me use only one at a time. This is just a really great size, price, and design."

Do you get lost in the mix with the Muff?  This fixes that.  Hate how you lose low-end when the tone knob is rolled up?  Bass boost fixes that.  These reasons make it better than any NYC BMP clone out there."

guitarpedals,3ci1xo,TeleFilm,6,Wed Jul 8 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"Get the Boss. Analog is cool but not necessary and digital emulation these days sounds really nice. The Ibanez Echo Shifter and the EHX Memory Boy/Toy/Deluxe Boy series is great for analog.  You mentioned long delays. Go digital. Ibanez DE7, Akai Headrush E2 (also a good tape sim), and DigiDelay are great and have good value. The Headrush is a huge value but takes up a lot of room."
guitarpedals,3ci1xo,holladaddy,4,Wed Jul 8 03:10:31 2015 UTC,"Analog is very limited in its functions. The only advantage it has over digital (other than using little mA) is that some will think it sounds better. But it depends on how you want to use the delay in the first place. Try out a carbon copy and a Flashback. If you find the Carbon Copy sounds so good and the Flashback can't get close... you need an analog. If you can't tell much difference -- get a digital, because the extra features and benefits of a digital delay are numerous."
guitarpedals,3ci1xo,minty901,3,Wed Jul 8 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"For analog Look up Hungry Robot's Moby Dick. Nice bare-bones delay with a tap.   BUT a lot of digital delays can get a nice analog sound, like the DD-20.   The biggest difference is the darkness/brightness of the delay repeats. Analog is darker and in my opinion is good for texture. Digital is bright (although some have a tone knob that can get darker) and is good for distinguished almost systematic repeats that won't necessarily get swallowed in the warmth of analog."

guitarpedals,3ci1xo,Infreez,0,Wed Jul 8 22:04:32 2015 UTC,"• it looks like it was crafted for a toddler that lacks the dexterity to turn a normal sized knob or the coordination to select a footswitch that's less than 4 inches apart from the next one  • the best sounds (in my opinion obviously) can be achieved with the settings in the smaller flashback   • the looper is basically just an excuse to charge another $100 when it's nothing special and makes the pedal even more massive  • the toneprint feature is great if you enjoy the piercing screech that comes out of your phone every time you want to load one on the pedal. Seriously it's not even annoying, it's painful.   • you can't even stack delays so you may as well get a couple different delay pedals and a looper for the same price. If one of them is the small flashback then you just got your toneprint capability back if you want it and most of the x4 sounds anyway"
guitarpedals,3ci1xo,Excuse_My_ADD,2,Thu Jul 9 03:25:31 2015 UTC,"The only detractor i can see that would make you pick the DD-20 over the Flashback X4 is the size and the lack of gimmicky effects (Twist, Warp) and considering you can get the X4 secondhand (Check eBay)  for basically the same price as a Flashback the pricing shouldn't be an issue either.   I don't understand your complaints about toneprints. Toneprints are the shit. You can emulate most other delays in one box as well as create a myriad of other wacky effects. I can turn my delay into a Flanger, Vibrato or Tri-Chorus pedal in a pinch. The tone print editor alone with the 4 slots on the x4 make it worth any additional cost it in my opinion. As for the sound, you could just plug it into a PC if you don't want to here it transmit. If you want stacking delays get the Flashback Triple.  These pedals are not as expensive as you're making them out to be."

The one major difference is that with analog delays you can do self oscillation whereas you cannot with digital ones."

However, I'm sure he also uses a TS pedal in conjunction with his Muff. That really helps to make the Muff less muddy.   And there are pictures floating around where he doesn't even have a Muff on his board, and its replaced with a Rat. So I would definitely check out getting a tube screamer, he has a TS9 it looks like, and a Rat."

I do something similar with a barber tone press running into a rat. Beefs it up and adds a nice bit of sustain."

guitarpedals,3cfp8i,ndlundstrom,2,Tue Jul 7 15:37:14 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad buy if you're not really looking for presets and MIDI compatibility. The main benefit to digital delays is that they're programmable, and they're often made to emulate those sought-after analog sounds. Some do a fantastic job at that, but it's still not true analog.  That's not to say that one is better than the other, but the Bellwether is geared towards those who want a true analog delay with all of those tweakable parameters, but don't need the bells and whistles that come with digital stompboxes.  I have an El Cap on my board and if I had the money to throw around I'd drop it on a Bellwether in a heartbeat and use both on my board."
guitarpedals,3cfp8i,ProfDrCmdrChang,2,Wed Jul 8 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"If you only were going to have 1 delay and were choosing between the Bellweather and the Timeline you'd go for the Timeline. I have lots of delays though, analog, digital, tape... One of my favourites is the E.A.R. AD4096 with the expand button - so dark and dense - but you absolutely need digital delays. Hell, I have a Particle just to have a granular reverse delay.   All that said, I don't think I'd grab the Bellweather because for me it would be redundant alongside the other stuff I have. If Chase Bliss comes out with a delay, or if the right company comes out with a reverse-centric pedal, I'll be all over it though."
guitarpedals,3cfp8i,that_magic,4,Wed Jul 8 04:31:08 2015 UTC,"Personally the Timeline (after owning over probably 20-25 delays) is hands-down my desert island pedal. The interface is intuitive (imo), the sounds are beautiful, and the sheer amount of versatility is just mind-blowing, it's a 10/10 absolute winner for me. That being said, I'm not crazy about the analog section of the timeline, it's excellent and better than most, but no replacement for the real deal. So I typically run an analog (Ibanez Echo shifter) along with the timeline and couldn't be happier. I think the Walrus is awesome and I can't wait to check it out, and I guess compared to the competition the price is fair but still a bit much for one delay IMO."
guitarpedals,3cfp8i,nickcasale,3,Tue Jul 7 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Walrus too much but at least they concentrate on getting a concrete effect with lots of options on it for their larger pedals. The Bellweather looks like a great analog delay that's a bit too pricey... but by that same assessment, so are the TimeLine and TimeFactor. You're saying that out of all those options in each that you'd really be paying for all of them and they'd all somehow be amazing?  I mean Strymon and Eventide are namedropped too. Strymon probably more than Walrus. I don't know why you'd be skeptical of that for one hyped company and not another.  If how you're assessing your purchase is by quantity of delay presets, I guess you could get a used DelayLab and an RE-20 or something and then have more options for cheaper. And those pedals sound amazing too."
guitarpedals,3cfp8i,holladaddy,3,Tue Jul 7 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"Analog is completely subjective. My 2 delay pedals are both analog emulation, and I love them. Do you need a ton of presets? Do you use delay feedback? The Bellweather is in a fair price range considering the rest of the tap tempo true analog delay market. I would never buy any of these I don't think, mostly because I don't need presets. It comes down to if you want true analog delay or not."
guitarpedals,3cfp8i,ElBeartoe,3,Tue Jul 7 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly,  I don't like or need presets, but if I was in the market for a pure analog delay with that much delay time the price is more than fair.   The same could be said about getting a nova, echorec, el captsion, disaster transport sr, fulltone tape, etc. If that's the sound or features you want they are worth it."
guitarpedals,3cfp8i,bolanrox,2,Tue Jul 7 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"For some people, that's the perfect delay with the exact sound and feature set that they've been waiting for. Justifies it for them."

I have the Stingray, which I would guess is pretty similar just with less filter options and more mod source options. It's built very well, despite looking like...ya. I don't wanna say it sounds bad, because it definitely doesn't, it sounds quite good especially for the price, but it leans more towards the ""do alot of things good"" than the ""do one thing great"" side of pedals. But that's what I wanted, I wasn't looking for an envelope filter with just a depth control that would become the cornerstone of my sound; I want a slow low pass sweep here, a high pass wobble there, a mixed in phase, etc etc.   Anyways that's my take, if you are looking for a filter pedal with options instead of a vintage-type-fast-low-pass pedal this is a great pedal. If you know you just was a simple autowah, then there are others more suited for that. If youre worried about build quality, don't be. Again I has the Stingray, not the envelope filter pedal, but I'm guessing it's similar."

It's a fantastic sounding studio quality effect. We live in an age where even Behringer can step up to the plate and make a great sounding reverb effect regularly available for $30 (The RV600 is bomb). With that in mind, other things in the $100-250 range always sound just as cool or cooler to me.  Even not just ragging on Strymon. From what I understand, the BlueSky has most of these options and a few more practically tweakable settings and features.  idk ""IMO"" get this if you run a successful recording studio or touring band with literal money to burn. But big reverb post rock bands like Mono and EITS who basically just do reverb and delay are fine with RV-3s, RV-5s, Digiverbs, Hardwire Supernatural and RV-7, and other high-value cost/benefit pedals.  I have a bit of a splurge on an Afterneath which is a really unique and adjustable ambient reverb, too. That's $225 new and not ""cheap"" but I can still pretend to be Andy Othling with it just fine without spending 2x as much.  Oh, and because I'm still doing this. The Line 6 M9 is a great multieffect where not only do you have a ton of preset options, but you can stack up to three of them. Plus you get an incredibly nice looper on it and all the DL4, MM4, the reverb one, and the FM4 settings and more."

guitarpedals,3cg1c3,holladaddy,3,Tue Jul 7 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter. Using too many true bypass pedals will weaken your signal. Buffered pedals replenish the signal. Lots of people say it ruins your sound to have buffered pedals but it's exaggeration and never matters. I have like like 15 buffered pedals in my chain and a a looper that can cut them all out of my signal at once and there's literally no difference in the clean tone of my guitar. This includes Behringer and old DOD and Ibanez pedals.  TL;DR people will worry about literally anything relating to their gear, buffers are sweet."
guitarpedals,3cg1c3,Ultramerican,3,Tue Jul 7 17:30:50 2015 UTC,Most overhyped and revered tone from a gain pedal of all time: has a buffer.  People literally sell its buffer as a pedal.  Holladaddy is right.
guitarpedals,3cg1c3,atdi2000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:54:40 2015 UTC,"It depends on the amp and how you play. Buffers effect tone, but so do truebypass pedals. If you have several buffers on certain amps it will add clipping on your bypass tone that you can't get rid of.  I have had this on several setups over the years and had to move some pedals around or put into the loop to minimize this issue."
guitarpedals,3cg1c3,jacksonprince,3,Wed Jul 8 03:16:44 2015 UTC,"Long cable runs have this effect called capacitance. It basically cuts higher frequencies out. Buffers counter this. Too many buffers give your tone a weird flat quality. True bypass just acts like a few more inches of cable. You could have a good mix. Basically, no one from stage can really tell and the only time it matters is in a recording situation.  Just use what you like. If a pedal gives you the option of buffered or true bypass make the decision based on the pedals around it and it's place in the chain. It's something people make too big of a deal about, really."
guitarpedals,3cg1c3,holladaddy,2,Wed Jul 8 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"So one or two buffered pedal won't make too much of a difference? My multi fx is a constant on for me, so that's not a concern of mine. I'm just worried that if I pick up more pedals and let them sit in bypass, my tone will suffer. Thanks for the info! I appreciate it!"
guitarpedals,3cg1c3,bluntsncuntss,4,Tue Jul 7 17:24:04 2015 UTC,"Your tone will never ""suffer"" because of buffers. Some older bypass methods like hardwire bypass might have a slight effect."
guitarpedals,3cg1c3,DrSlapstick,2,Tue Jul 7 17:36:08 2015 UTC,"The rule of thumb for cable length is around 18 ft is when the highs start to cut out.  So it really depends on cable length + add a few inches for each true bypass pedal.  I like to use 18 ft cables on stage, so I try to throw a buffer on my board to get the highs back before the next run of cable.  But like jacksonprince said, unless the cables you're using are ridiculously long, the only one who's going to notice is you."

guitarpedals,3ce8sf,StevieInternets,3,Tue Jul 7 11:34:20 2015 UTC,I basically just use it to run multiple effects combinations at the same time through one channel.

There are other things you could do with it but I've only had it a few months. The only problem is that it takes a lot of patch cables.

guitarpedals,3cgm0v,theflyingjib,2,Tue Jul 7 20:17:36 2015 UTC,"A lead boost would be good for playing live. I use a Tube Screamer myself, but a clean boost can work just as good. My biggest problem playing live was always trying get heard when playing a solo without having to set my amp so loud it overpowered everything. A good lead boost can fix this. It can give you a slight volume and sustain boost, as well as give you a better EQ so that you stand out more in the mix. It's essential for being heard in a full band setting."
guitarpedals,3cgm0v,LukeRobert,2,Wed Jul 8 02:40:02 2015 UTC,"I would consider looking into separate and distinct distortion/fuzz vs. overdrive if you want to be able to quickly pull up different tones, one for a shinier/cleaner overdrive and one for the super messy distortion/fuzz. A boost or volume pedal in conjunction could be helpful, too.  Depending on what kind of music you play, you can have fun playing with reverb, tremolo, or modular effects like chorus, flange, and phaser.   I've never used much compressor or equalizer, but I did use a suppressor for a while that helped keep buzz and noise down to a mininum on my single coil guitars when I turned my drives way up. The Boss NS-2 is a decent pedal that way with the ability to set the threshhold and decay at different levels, so when you're playing (or sending an ""active"" signal through your chain), it's wide open, but as soon as you stop strumming or picking, the signal cuts off. The decay allows you set how quickly that muting happens, which affects your sustain more than anything. You can also adjust how sensitive it is to that ""active"" signal."

guitarpedals,3cgm0v,UltimatePartyBoner,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"I swear by compression, personally, but it's not a flashy effect.  It's really more subtle and functional, but I think it goes a long way, especially for leads and complex, open-voiced chords.  I've had two of my friends convert from a strict No Compressor ideology to having always-on compression on their boards (a Boss Compression/sustainer and an Xotic compressor, respectively) after listening to me jabber about how much I lean on my compressor.  The only downside for an always-on comp is that it takes up valuable board space for something that you aren't going to mess with settings on.  I have a Barber Tone Press, so it eats up a large part of my board that I could be using to cram another delay into, or maybe a phaser.  EQ's are great for boosting certain frequencies that you want for different scenarios (jack the mids and highs for a solo, whatever), but I've personally never encountered anybody who I would say used an EQ pedal in a smart way, so I've never bothered.  Again, the difference is relatively subtle.  Something I would suggest, though, is a good chorus pedal.  I'm a recent convert to the Church of Chorus; I find it to be a very satisfying and useful effect."

No. Does it sound a hell of a lot better than the crate solid state I had? Yes. It doesn't just give you one tone like an overdrive pedal, it's designed to react like a tube amp so when you crank the gain on the pedal and roll back your guitar volume it cleans up. Actually it's a pretty great value, and sometimes I wish I still had it. Definitely use it in front of your amp. With a DI box I also used to play it through PAs which was super handy."

guitarpedals,3cgkv7,TeleFilm,2,Thu Jul 9 16:49:50 2015 UTC,You might be better off getting a SansAmp or Joyo amp simulator.  I've never played the 59 Bassman pedal but come on.  It can't be that good.    A BOSS GE-7 EQ pedal might also add more character to your solid state amp.
guitarpedals,3cgkv7,holladaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:05:21 2015 UTC,I'll look at those. I have a Vox Tonelab and the bassman emulator I use more than any of the others. I'd like to have it  in a single pedal. Used EQ pedals come up all the time in some of the local gear swaps. I may snag one.
guitarpedals,3cgkv7,holladaddy,2,Wed Jul 8 08:26:10 2015 UTC,Get an EQ pedal or mess with the EQ on your existing setup. Look up a Youtube video on how to dial in different EQ settings. Get an EQ pedal if it's not exact enough.
guitarpedals,3cgkv7,negligibletalent,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:04:41 2015 UTC,"Main reason for the bassman would be to turn my solid state to a kind of fake tube amp, without spending a grand for an actual tube amp that could crap out on me."

guitarpedals,3ccq5f,amnesiac808,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:10:26 2015 UTC,They take normal power. The Slicer is 9V and 110 mA. The RE-20 is 9V and like 75 mA. Boss is good about this kind of thing. Most popular power supplies will handle them and I'm sure even a OneSpot would too if you know what your current draw of that chain would be.
guitarpedals,3ccq5f,holladaddy,-1,Tue Jul 7 16:40:06 2015 UTC,EDIT: I was wrong.
guitarpedals,3ccq5f,holladaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:35:23 2015 UTC,What do you mean? They don't work on the power supply? Have you tried adjusting the dip switches for current on the PP2+? Those will give you current outputs of like 100-250mA depending on where they are. I've run things with higher power demands than them on mine.
guitarpedals,3ccq5f,holladaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"What? It doesn't switch voltage. It switches the current. I have two of the exact same model of Voodoo Lab PP. Those switches will give you the power you need for the big Boss pedals even if that's not the way you're using them currently. you could power a OneSpot from the power strip to cover a few more pedals instead of using the two adapters, I'd recommend that.  Outputs 1-4 can power the RE-20 if you switch the output it's on to 100mA mode, and if they don't work on the SL-20 you could do 5 or 6 which output up to 250mA. But I think you'd be fine even running it on 100, pedal manufacturers often overshoot these things, sometimes by a lot. My Whammy V runs on the 250mA output and it says on the side it needs like 3600mA."
guitarpedals,3ccq5f,RushofBlood52,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:46:16 2015 UTC,The 5-6 outputs of a PP2+ run at 250 mA. They're specifically for Boss Twin pedals. It literally says that in the manual.

guitarpedals,3ce586,holladaddy,3,Tue Jul 7 10:27:51 2015 UTC,"I like mine before a touch sensitive drive pedal to act as if I'm turning down the volume knob on my guitar to get some clean up. Technically I could just use the knob on my guitar, but I can't twist it live without screwing up what I'm playing while I'm playing it.  And uh... it's also fun for swells, although I never really use it for that."
guitarpedals,3ce586,koalaroo,5,Tue Jul 7 05:37:13 2015 UTC,"I have mine after my dirt, so my guitar volume controls the input level and my VP controls my total output level. It means I can clean up my ODs with my guitar, or pull the volume back with the ODs and fuzz totally blown out."
guitarpedals,3ce586,uncannythom,4,Tue Jul 7 12:57:52 2015 UTC,That's the way to do it. No reason to put the volume pedal up front. I think people don't really practice rolling off volume in a live setting enough.
guitarpedals,3ce586,Superfuzz-BigMuff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:36:38 2015 UTC,You can't do volume swells nearly as well with your hands. It works just as well as a pedal for really slow swells with huge reverb/delay but for shorter notes or things like envelope/velocity sensitive synth pedals it really matters that you have extra control with your foot.  Having a pedal gives you better control of the sweep from beginning to end as well if you ask me.
guitarpedals,3ce586,holladaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"That's not what I said. I use a volume pedal. What I'm saying is it's redundant having it at the front of your chain because it does the same job as your volume knob. Volume knob should be used to roll off input gain, volume pedal should be used for master level. Swells seem to work better that way too."
guitarpedals,3ce586,Superfuzz-BigMuff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:05:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't run my drives first in my signal so it makes more sense to me to have it first.

I mostly just don't use my volume knob, but I get why people with different setups do. I just don't see it as a practice issue for every player."
guitarpedals,3ce586,holladaddy,6,Tue Jul 7 17:34:58 2015 UTC,I just feel like anyone who doesn't use their volume knob is really missing out on a ton of tones you can't get anywhere else.

guitarpedals,3ce586,DodgingMonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:40:23 2015 UTC,For swells.  I've only been in our cover band for a few months so the lead guitarist has his shit down.  I'll back some of the main chords with swells and other little filler stuff. To kill my volume for tuning or to reduce signal input to my amp. My volume pedal also has an expression pedal in/out which I'm excited to use.  I plan on isolating the volume pedal (Dunlop Volume X) in its own loop.  It's passive though so the normal signal chain will run through the volume side and when the loop is engaged it will operate on the Exp side.

guitarpedals,3cdwd1,rdmdcne,15,Tue Jul 7 03:48:02 2015 UTC,"I think you'll already have an advantage by bringing in different players. I cannot stand when I'm trying to find a decent pedal demo but all the demos consist of is blues noodling. A variation of styles is key to a good demo in my opinion.  I also don't think it's necessary to spend 2 minutes talking about the specs of the gear when it's so easy to look that stuff up myself. When I watch a video, I want to hear how the gear sounds, not someone reading me text from the manufacturer's website.  This next one may be just me, but I always appreciate the reviewer giving their brief opinion near the end of the video just to give me a better idea of how it sounds in real life as opposed to over the video. If there's something negative about it, don't be afraid to say it.  If it's a pedal, it's always cool to see what your favorite settings are for it and how you use them.  Good luck with your channel and let us know when you've got some stuff up!"
guitarpedals,3cdwd1,koalaroo,3,Tue Jul 7 06:00:09 2015 UTC,I agree with all these points.  Nothing is more annoying than dudes trying to get clever and cute while taking forever to tell me the pedal uses a 9 volt battery. That German dude pisses me off so much. Justnick rules.

guitarpedals,3cdwd1,KevinBarbie,7,Tue Jul 7 04:25:42 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. I like to see the full capabilities of a pedal. No sense in keeping the knobs at noon the whole time.

guitarpedals,3cdwd1,RushofBlood52,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:41:43 2015 UTC,I guess for example something like this sound right here: https://youtu.be/u55ZkVWjlIg At like 52 seconds or so.  Just little noises that you can throw into songs instead of tones.
guitarpedals,3ce4t1,blacklaredo,7,Tue Jul 7 05:09:39 2015 UTC,"If you want something cheap, I'm a big fan of the Boss sd-1 and bd-2. The sd-1 has a little mid hump that gives it a harder edge while the bd-2 can get you some really nice broken up sounds and crunch while staying true to your amp's own sound.  If you can afford not so cheap, maybe a Zvex box of rock or distortron could be up your alley. Basically a Marshall JTM 45 in a box. The box of rock has an extra boost built in, and the distortron (while it doesn't have the boost side) has a few extra gain options. I've played the box of rock in a store and really liked it. Very dynamic with a wide range from just broken up to full out rock distortion and sounds great. The boost sounds awesome by itself as well."
guitarpedals,3ce4t1,koalaroo,5,Tue Jul 7 05:44:41 2015 UTC,For something cheap but totally awesome I'd try out the Joyo Ultimate Drive. It's pretty similar to the Fulltone OCD but at a fraction of the price.

guitarpedals,3cavrx,emdomi,2,Mon Jul 6 16:57:20 2015 UTC,I'd say the OCD is a much clearer sounding overdrive. The gain isn't as grainy as the BD-2. I was using the BD-2 as my main drive for years and then I stumbled upon the OCD overseas and it was exactly what I was after. I use that as my main drive now and the blues driver as like a boost/tone thing.

guitarpedals,3cavrx,ClearEyeColoredMind,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"I just bought it a week ago after spending about a year pondering whether it was worth spending over $400 on, but I am so happy with it. I use it to just add subtle pitch wobbles on chorus or flange mode just to add some colour to my clean tone and then I've been using the tape flange in it with the fuzz to get a really wild lead sound. I pretty much have the tape saturation on all the time, it just adds a little something and combined with the ocd it is an unreal drive sound. There's so much you can do with it though, every time I turn a knob I get a completely different sound."
guitarpedals,3cchap,Walewhale1,9,Mon Jul 6 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I love the El Capistan. However, if price is a factor, there are plenty of alternatives out there that can do a tape tap tempo. For example, the TC Electronic Flashback x4/Alter Ego x4 can let you create and store 3 different tape sounding delays, there's the Line 6 DL4, the tried and true Boss DD20 and RE20, the EHX Memory Man with Hazarai, and finally the Vox Delaylab (the big white one). You can snag any of these used for $100-$170.   As for Explosions in the Sky, they use nothing but Boss DD 3/5/6/7 and a DL4. I know Taka from Mono only uses DD3s, and he just added (3 weeks ago) a Flint. Caspian uses everything I've mentioned above. While This Will Destroy You uses the Memory Man and DD20. Honestly though, I would get whatever I mentioned that's cheapest, invest in a really cool chorus pedal (EQD Sea Machine, Rainbow Machine, Grand Orbiter etc) and reverb pedal (TC Hall of Fame, EHX Cathedral, DigiTech Polara). At least, that's what I'm doing."
guitarpedals,3cchap,easychairmethod,2,Mon Jul 6 22:00:42 2015 UTC,"I just want to add something, even though he is only asking about delay, the Boss RV-3 reverb is core to Explosions in the Sky's sound. All their guitarist have one."
guitarpedals,3cchap,hullabaleu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:02:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for this as well. I thought I would get a second delay first but obviously a reverb will be important in the future. I'll look into this one.
guitarpedals,3cchap,pylit,3,Tue Jul 7 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"Bands use all kinds of stuff in the studio. This will destroy you constantly switches it up live and explosions goes way beyond what they say they use in interviews. On their later records you can hear fuzz, tape echo, ebows, and all of the other good stuff. When they play live they seem to sample parts of songs that go wild like that and use their core stuff to focus on playing their 'sound' which is their melodies. The RV-3 is most definitely their core sound on their most popular tracks.   But to your point, if op wants to sound like explosions.. Get a strat, a fender tube amp, and an RV-3, and you could play 99% of every song they've ever made. With that said- there is only one explosions, so find your own voice, experiment, and have fun discovering it!!!"
guitarpedals,3cchap,hullabaleu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah a reverb stomp box is a crucial for the type of music you are aiming for. There are many options available beyond the RV-3, but compared to others it is pretty cheap, I got one for 85."
guitarpedals,3cchap,drknight,3,Tue Jul 7 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"I would say just go for it man, or look at an Empress Tape Delay. I don't own an El Cap, but 2 of my friends do, so I've used them quite a bit, and they are great pedals, I just prefer the Empress. When it comes to the Empress TD, I really like the sound, the controls, the built in buffer, the subdivisions, and the price-tag. You can't go wrong with either. I also play ambient guitar, sometimes at Yoga studios, and I am limited in my pedal options, and I always go with the Empress for my delay. Another one to look at would be the Boss RE20 Space Echo. Cheaper than the El Cap, and it's a helluva pedal. If you're looking to make ambient music, you can't go wrong with one of those three."
guitarpedals,3cchap,baudrillardwasright,3,Mon Jul 6 21:28:07 2015 UTC,"OP, I don't have any advice on the el cap, but check out Andy Othling's Ambient Guitar Tips on youtube if you want good beginner-level intro to the genre stuff."
guitarpedals,3cchap,minty901,3,Mon Jul 6 22:19:53 2015 UTC,for explosions in the sky they dont really use much modulation or tape delay or anything like that. their entire sound is done with a boss rv3 which is pristine digital delay with a touch of reverb.
guitarpedals,3cchap,ProfDrCmdrChang,3,Mon Jul 6 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"The TC Electronic Flashback is a great alternative if the El Cap's price is discouraging to you. For ambient stuff, there's plenty you can do with just two delays.  For a while all I had for ""ambient"" stuff was a DD-7 and a Flashback. The DD-7 I normally used for rhythmic stuff so it's always set to dotted eighths or quarter notes depending on what I needed. The Flashback I dialed for long delay times, plenty of repeats, and the mix turned down so the repeats don't crash into each other. The Flashback alone is great for ambient playing when dialed that way as it creates a wash underneath your notes without being overly present.  A decent reverb is also a nice addition, but you can live without it.   However, for all the hate the El Cap gets it's really a monster of a pedal. There are cheaper alternatives, but there are more expensive ones as well. As price goes it's really not bad, but it's definitely geared towards the musician who needs more than just a simple three-knob delay for that little bit of wetness. I've been loving my El Cap since I got it. You really can't go wrong."
guitarpedals,3cchap,Jhlong86,5,Tue Jul 7 02:31:03 2015 UTC,The El Cap has been on my board since 2012. Refuse to take it off. The pedal is amazing. Ambient shit for days and can do all the other stuff great as well.

guitarpedals,3cchap,parrot94,2,Tue Jul 7 03:01:05 2015 UTC,Don't own an El Cap or have ever tried one but if you're after a typical post-rock sound get yourself a decent reverb pedal after your delay. Very easy way to add some more atmosphere to your playing.
guitarpedals,3cchap,fart_toast,2,Tue Jul 7 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"If you want stacking delays then try the new Strymon DIG out . i have both the El Cap and DIG. If I could only have 1 and was going to play ambient it'd be the DIG hands down. http://i.imgur.com/FpBAx9Y.jpg  You can get standard single delay... stack some delays for nice melodic playing and that great swell. Also you can do faux reverb with the ""golden ratio"" time signature setting. All round great tool for ambient. I run the el cap before the DIG to get some imperfections into the signal and then slice and dice with the DIG."
guitarpedals,3cchap,holladaddy,4,Tue Jul 7 08:44:47 2015 UTC,"Want to test what tape delay is like to use? Grab an Akai Headrush E2. If you want ambient stuff like Andy Othling you'll probably want to try some kind of reverb with full wet mixing (Digiverb comes to mind, I think the T-Rex WhirlyVerb does as well, or even the Behringer RV600).  Ambient is about stacking so don't blow $250 on one pedal, blow $250 on like four or five. Reverb and delay and modulation will get you started. Andy Othling's sound is also heavily due to his Diamond Compressor and his Micro POG."
guitarpedals,3cchap,Ultramerican,2,Mon Jul 6 23:29:33 2015 UTC,"The Behringer RV600 is a pretty great reverb pedal and is theft-cheap.  The NUX Time Force is also insane for $56, I just got one because I don't use delays enough to justify $200+ on a big digi delay, but was fine with dropping $56 to get a really good sounding digital delay with a bunch of modes and a basic looper."
guitarpedals,3cchap,Malatesta721,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in an El Cap, I'd say just buy one.

The best part of it is that it's versatile, so you can get dirty and weird, but also clean it up.   It's also a very inspiring pedal to use, I don't think there are many other pedals around quite like the El Cap."

Otherwise, maybe remove the feet, screw some wooden boards to the bottom of the PT to elevate it a bit, then put the feet back on it. I don't know how much bigger the CIOK is than the room you have, but it's worth a shot.   Another solution is to put velcro on top of the power supply and put a pedal on top of it.

I understand the other comment with throwing a looper between a mic and the mixer/PA/whatever but I don't see why that'd be desirable given that the amp would be playing the exact signal from your guitar that you fed into it at first. In terms of ""preserving the amp's tone"" that seems sufficient. You could always run loops to another amp or in that described way though for a different effect.  Also I didn't know if you were serious or not- will resume GPJ jokes in the meantime"

That being said, I would still recommend keeping your looper at the end of the chain, if only for the ability to juxtapose/harmonize/blend as many different sounds as possible into the same field."
guitarpedals,3cehn3,snagglemonster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:08:23 2015 UTC,"I may not be understanding you correctly, but if by ""amp tone"" you mean can it loop, say, from your amp's clean channel and then some dirty channel over top of it (if it has more than one), it can as long as you put it in the effects loop (again, only if it has one). Hope that makes sense."
guitarpedals,3cehn3,outkastedd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"I run my looper last in the chain from my effects loop.

guitarpedals,3cc51o,heidensieck,4,Mon Jul 6 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"You need a mic preamp with a instrument 1/4"" line out between the mic and pedals but yes. I was playing around with my boss rc50 the other day which has a mic input, putting a chorus and delay between it and the amp then cranking the spring reverb on my amp. Sounded super cool."
guitarpedals,3cc51o,PantslessDan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"or a cable with female XLR on one end, and a 1/4 jack on the other. Not optimal, soundwise, but it'll work."
guitarpedals,3cc51o,heidensieck,2,Mon Jul 6 22:09:08 2015 UTC,"You need something to change the impedance and get the volume up to instrument up to line level though don't you? I have one of those cables, but last time I used it I got a loud buzzing and had to turn my amp way up to hear anything from the mic."
guitarpedals,3cc51o,PantslessDan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"Well, you need to feed low impedance into high. Most mics are low-, and pedal inputs are higher impedance, so that's not a big problem. The signal from a guitar is not line level either, so pedals can deal with the low signal. A bandmate of mine uses an A/B switch to select between a mic and a guitar into his pedals. Works fine. A guitar amp does not sound great with a mic, though. They have quite a different sound from a full range PA sytem. A mic preamp with a 1/4 jack out may sound a bit better for a mic to a guitar amp, but mic>preamp>effects>PA will sound even better, as you wrote. Or mic>FX>mixer>PA.  Does your cable have a stereo 1/4 jack ?"
guitarpedals,3cc51o,heidensieck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:33:31 2015 UTC,"It is a stereo cable, so that may be the source of the buzzing. Either way I no longer need to use it since I got the rc50."

I primarily use a looper live for rhythm while I play over it, and to stop the ditto or jamman, you have to double stomp, a big pain to do and keep tempo at the same time. The ditto x2 has an fx stomp with a dipswitch that can be set to ""stop"", perfect for what I use it for, plus it does some other cool things, plus top mounted jacks, making up for the slightly larger footprint."

Or if you want something that's tighter than a witche's cunt, you can always go for the old Meshuggah standard of having a tubscreamer with a dimed compressor. Perhaps wait for the EQD dunes (or get the huge Palisades) with your compression. I know they are not Death metal, but they have some of the heaviest tones on the planet.   Bloodbath themselves used the old Boss HM2, but if you go that route I recommend you either get it modded to accept 9 volts or get one of the many great clones that are out there. Perhaps email Dunwich Amps to see if they can build you something along that route.    Actually, the amp you have might also play a huge role on what else you'd need to nail those metal tones, what do you play through?"

Just download the preset from their app. Creating your own is a lot of fun because you can plug it in to your computer and adjust settings while playing.

guitarpedals,3cdavi,minty901,0,Wed Jul 8 03:19:28 2015 UTC,"No, this is wrong. You can't download any of the T2-specific reverbs to the HOF. You could try to painstakingly recreate all of then in the editor, but it will be a hell of a challenge, and still you would have to plug in with USB any time you wanted to change one."
guitarpedals,3cdavi,easychairmethod,0,Wed Jul 8 09:51:41 2015 UTC,"Let's see, setting IV is literally the church setting on the other two, while setting V is the Twister toneprint. Setting VI is more or less the Mod setting, and setting VIII is Hall. That's 4 reverbs the other two can do, that I know off the top of my head.  Have you actually played around with the toneprint app? It's intuitive and easy to use. And no, you don't have to plug your pedal in every time you want to change the toneprint. If you download the app on your phone, all you have to do is beam the toneprint through your pickups. It's stupidly easy."
guitarpedals,3cdavi,minty901,0,Wed Jul 8 15:21:46 2015 UTC,"IV isn't church, they're very different. Haven't tried the Twister toneprint so can't comment on that. VI isn't very similar to mod (though you did say more or less) and VIII isn't very similar to Hall.  The app is great I've created loads of toneprints on it. My comment about having to plug in every time was in reference to the fact that the HOF toneprints arent in the app already, so if you wanted them on the T2 you would have to create them yourself, and if you are able to create them yourself (or get close enough to it), then you would have to plug in every time you wanted to change. I'm aware you can easily beam one of the toneprints that are already in the app... but these aren't the same as what comes loaded on the HOF."

Just download the preset from their app""  Sorry for calling you out but this was a very misleading thing to say. You can't download a Trinity preset to your arena. There is no toneprint on the toneprint app that sounds anything like E2. And Not one that sounds very similar to E1. Each toneprint is unique in its own way and you can't download any ""stock"" patches onto any of the other pedals. As you said in your reply to me, there are approximate workarounds, but that isn't what you said in your comment, and I wouldn't want OP to be mislead by your comment so I had to call you out.  Technically, you were wrong when you said you can download any of the Trinity presets to the Arena (you simply can't), so when I said ""this is wrong"", I don't think that was unfair of me or worthy of a downvote. I just wanted OP to not be misled."

If the OP had read what you said, believed it to be true, and later found out that that isn't true, he/she might have been disappointed. It is better to make the truth clear.  If big room with a view is ""close enough"" to any of the reverbs on T2 (and it isn't), then that must mean you aren't very particular about how your reverbs sound... in which case why even bother with toneprint?

The cheapest setup would be to wire it to TRS socket and use ring for piezo then connect it to A/B switch and then into piezo preamp. You can buy one cheap from eBay. To top it off you need a PA speaker as it will nod sound good via guitar amp. Without a speaker this cost me around £50.

Right now, you're taking the already distorted sounds from the OCD and the MXR and making it fuzzier. The muff also doesn't have the output that your other pedals have, so by putting it later in the chain, you're really squashing your sound.

guitarpedals,3caly3,drknight,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, I think without any more information about your chain it is really hard to give advice. Also, do you have issues with overdriven/distorted sounds or clean ones?   On my board I run a distortion pedal right infront of the Timeline followed by a Bigsky and I have no trouble at all hearing the reverb or delay, depending on settings and what I want out of them. This is kinda relative and hard to answer definately.     I'd say for starters try running dirt before delay based effects (both delay and reverb are delay based), and if you are using your amps preamp for distortion/overdrive try the FX loop of your amp if you have one. Also in my experience reverb works better after delay."
guitarpedals,3caly3,easychairmethod,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:02:10 2015 UTC,"I had everything set up as you mentioned expect the delay was in the wrong position which I imagine was the issue. Never tried it in the loop since I only had one other pedal that would go into it and I was being lazy and didn't want to reassemble the board.  Thank you for the info I'm gonna try the next reverb I get my hands in after the delay and then in the loop in that order too.  PS I am hesitant to get more than one Strymon pedal unless I get a synth but I imagine the timeline/big sky combo is pretty cool. Do you feel like it's versatile enough to get ""natural"" depth or does everything come out like wind chimes and sprinkled gold dust (I mean that in a positive way)"

If you like it, do it. :-)  About your other question: I use them for guitars and I absolutely love them. Depending on what I want they can pretty much do both things you mentioned. I usually work with 3 presets on the BigSky and make my delay before affect the ""darkness"" of the sound, either that being a tape delay with a high frequency roll off for example or a clean digital delay."

DIG is about precision and clarity, and the ability to use single or dual delays without losing that sterility.  El Cap is about taking a digital sound that Strymon has engineered to already be modulated to sound like a tape machine as soon as the pedal is turned on, and then giving you the ability to further  tweak the parameters of that modulated sound.   Dig is meant to sound like digital rack mounted units (studio quality ""clean"" delay). As an added feature they have added dual delay controls--think of dual delay as a time-based feature not a tone-altering feature.    El Cap is meant to sound like a tape machine. Watch a YouTube video of a real tape machine delay. This is what the pedal is trying to copy the sound of.  Hope this helps."

People are down voting because they are sick of Strymon hype when there's tons of other options out there (which I understand). So here's my 2c:  If you see pedals as somewhat of a hobby, and you want to add a Strymon to your collection then do what makes you happy. If your pursuit of a pedal is strictly about achieving a desired tone based on the best price/smallest enclosure/tracking quality, etc. then it would behoove you to do your due diligence and study up on multiple brands.  Regardless, hype goes both ways. There's been plenty of times I've stupidly bought a pedal because of popular opinion, but there were also times when I wasted my time and money buying something different than what I knew I really wanted because I was discouraged from following the herd.  For more understanding of my perspective: I suck at guitar, I have a $40 compressor and a $450 Timeline on my board and I love them both. The compressor I like from a players standpoint and the timeline I like from a collectors standpoint."

Some great sounds out of it, it's a lot warmer and more versatile than the Strymon haters give it credit for, especially the 12-bit mode.  I recently picked up a Dig and it's knocked my other delays off my board, it just sounds fantastically pristine. The modulation is dialed in to be subtle but still adds the right amount of movement and depth. The El Cap sounds good too, but I don't need all those controls over wobble and tape degradation, in the end they just make it sound like a dying Yak at the more extreme settings.  I'm going through a bit of an experimental phase right now to try to find a good second delay to pair up with it. Malekko Echo, TC Electronic Alter Ego and Catalinbread Echorec haven't made the cut.

It's an unapologetically digital multieffects box that does some pretty bizarre and conventional sounds.   It does the digital fuzz thing beautifully (think Raveonettes) along with the broken wire crackle (NiN). My favorite effects are the bitcrusher and the one-second delay, which can do either pristine repeats or digitally distorted one that sound like an 80s delay.

guitarpedals,3c9cya,DodgingMonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:28:11 2015 UTC,"It makes it overall less harsh to my ears. Takes away some of the overly bright sound of the pedal.   Also makes it a bit lower gain, usable as an overdrive with the gain knob all the way down, and when you crank that gain knob, it sounds like a cranked Marshall amp to me.  Also if you're handy with a solder iron, it's entirely risk-free. You could just solder the diodes back in place."

guitarpedals,3c74yr,Vespaman,12,Sun Jul 5 14:29:25 2015 UTC,A tap tempo is not a necessary feature of a delay - it is just convenient. If your repeats were out of time with your playing/your band's playing then things definitely could have sounded messy. Try slowly adjusting the delay time until your repeats sync up with the music.   Also there is a chance that there was just too much going on in the song and having those repeats did make things sound too messy.
guitarpedals,3c74yr,ShreddyGnarGnar,2,Sun Jul 5 14:46:12 2015 UTC,I don't think Arctic Monkeys are concerned with using delay to sync up with the rhythm. It's 100% a texture thing.
guitarpedals,3c74yr,RushofBlood52,5,Mon Jul 6 14:06:08 2015 UTC,Don't think it's much to do with the tempo of the delay. Jamie Cook uses a DMM without tap tempo but the speed is set quite fast so it shouldn't matter too much.
guitarpedals,3c74yr,jpttaylor,4,Sun Jul 5 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"Jamie Cook uses a Deluxe Memory Man (I think he used two at one point and may have recently switched to a Boss RE-20) for the delay. But he also always has some sort of Big Muff on his board as well as a HOG or POG. Especially for Humbug, which was a very textured and effects-heavy album. I don't think he was using a reverb at this point in the band's time but it couldn't hurt to try it.  He has also used a Stereo Pulsar and some sort of compressor since almost the entirety of the band's lifetime. They're probably not on for Crying Lightning specifically (maybe the compressor for sustain), but he uses the effects a lot in general if you're ever doing more than just that one song."
guitarpedals,3c74yr,RushofBlood52,4,Mon Jul 6 14:44:19 2015 UTC,I don't think repeats necessarily need to sync up with the tempo to fit in a mix. It really depends on the kind of guitar part.

guitarpedals,3c74yr,WheezyLiam,3,Sun Jul 5 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"Alright so it sounds like a vibrato/tremolo plus a delay set to a short, slapback-type sound. I can see how this would turn out messy, because you kinda need to dial in the feedback and effect levels to where the overall tone sits well in the mix. If you play around with what you have, you most likely will find the sweet spot. It can't be too much or else it sounds messy, and it can't be too little or else you just don't get the sound you're looking for. Good luck, man!"
guitarpedals,3c74yr,KarltonSagan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:41:41 2015 UTC,what delay pedal do you have? Hardwire DL-8 is the most reliable delay for the price imho. You can never go wrong with the dd-3 either.

guitarpedals,3c3wam,KevinBarbie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:03:37 2015 UTC,I'm curious how this sounds compared to a poly chorus (which is my go-to postpunk chorus sound).
guitarpedals,3c3wam,SuperScaryBerry,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"i recently sold my big box polychorus that i owned for about 5 year. The only thing that made me want to keep it was the way the delay works in chorus mode. I have a big box Deluxe electric mistress, and an old Clone Theory and preferred both to the Polychorus. the chorus/vibrato on the CT is better and more usable than on the PC, and the Flange on the EM is far better than on the polychorus. I found i never used the filter matrix or the double track modes.   ultimately, if you use the PC in chorus mode with the delay/feedback turned up (to get those delayed pitch shifts) then keep it because the CT can't do that. but if you only use it for a standard chorus, then the CT in my opinion sounds better (though the PC ultimately has more flexibility)"

guitarpedals,3c5295,HopefulUtopian,2,Sat Jul 4 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of the criticism comes from bedroom players I'll add as well. (With the exception of people like Nels Cline who decidedly don't like it for other reasons) At low volumes it tends to be a bit nasal and weak (UNLESS you have a variation of it with a bass control or EQ functions in general). At middle-higher volumes it really starts to sing though.   I view this pedals as a classic, and it's been the tonal core of SO much music over the past 30-odd years. I think everyone should own one at some point just to get that basic sound in their head.  I'll add too that they are useful in almost every genre. Metal guys use them at low gain for tone shaping, blues and rock guys use them for singing sustain, I even know a few jazz heads who use them to focus their mids a little and give a tiny bit of grit/grunt to a cleaner amp."
guitarpedals,3c5295,TimmyPage06,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:17:04 2015 UTC,This is true of many overdrive/distortion/fuzz pedals. There's way too many YouTube videos of bedroom guitarists playing at low volumes and you just can't get the proper potential of a lot of pedals that way.
guitarpedals,3c5295,plus-size-male-model,8,Mon Jul 6 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"It's a really basic overdrive that a lot of pedals have been based off of. If you're just starting out I'd shoot for used as it's always cheaper that way, and always try pedals out before hand, or at the very least do extensive listening to demos.  The different price options vary with different functions and build quality. My personal opinion is that a Maxon od is better then any of the ibanez versions, though new it's usually more expensive. There are other quality ""knockoffs"" like EHX's easy river drive."
guitarpedals,3c5295,JacktheArcher42,8,Sat Jul 4 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in a tube screamer, then I'd recommend checking out the DigiTech Bad Monkey.

guitarpedals,3c5295,001146379,3,Sun Jul 5 04:30:26 2015 UTC,"If I had one pice of advice, it would be to wait a bit- watch a ton of YouTube videos on pedals, play a ton if you live near a good music store, and then make your decisions. The tube screamer is great- but it's just an overdrive, and there's hundreds of those.   If you know that for your sound, a chorus, an analog delay, and a great reverb are mandatory ( and an overdrive of course), research them. It'll make you a lot happier than having to sell a few pedals that you thought you wanted, but ended up not really loving.   Of course, I did the exact opposite, and I know we all have GAS and need to buy, so I don't expect anyone to take my advice.    Have fun. Building a pedal board is one of the most fun things a gear loving person can do."

guitarpedals,3c5295,porcubot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:48:46 2015 UTC,$20-$30 will get you a cheap clone (and it's been cloned so many times). For that price it's worth grabbing one because it's such an iconic pedal.
guitarpedals,3c5295,plus-size-male-model,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:20:02 2015 UTC,"So the Ibanez tube screamer is a regular old overdrive/ distortion type pedal that got a good name because alot of musicians got a taste for it and boasted its greatness. The other pedal that took that same role was the Boss DS-1, Boss's cheap shit basic distortion. They range in price because of condition, used/ new, issue, and they make one in a metal case, a plastic case, and the beetle case (from the mid 90's). They all do the same thing. I think there may be one with a true bypass button as well (someone can correct me on that).   I recommend buying a cheap used one in metal housing as an experimentation device. You put it between your guitar and amp, turn the gain on the amp 1/2 way up and 1/2 way up on the pedal, then sweet spot the distortion by changing the tone and output on the pedal. Same thing for the DS-1. Its all about finding the sweet spot and working with 1/2 the gain on both because the gain (overdrive) becomes additive. Too many people I know get it and expect to use it as a straight distortion pedal and its just not that. They then turn the gain all the way up on the pedal and their amp and get straight feedback. They then take the pedal out of their loop and forget about it.   During the late 90's and early 00's, hardcore bands were buying the reissue and putting it before a 5150. An SG going through a tube screamer into a 5150 has a damn nice sound. Chunky, thick, and clean saturated distortion. On the other end of the spectrum was Phish where Trey Anastasio was running his guitar into it and then into a Boss CS-1 compressor. He tuned that just right and could get this bright clear sustained note that sounded great over the band. It was impressive hearing him sustain a note 16 or more measures while the band just kept playing.   I feel as though researching the pedal is really useless because you need to know how it sounds in your setup. Your gain isnt the same as any other setup unless you bought exactly what someone else did. Youtube compresses audio so it can transmit it over the internet. You might get some really awesome harmonics out of your rig. You might not. It may suck. You need to know and $50 damage is worth that experimentation."
guitarpedals,3c5295,duckquil,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:14:38 2015 UTC,This was incredibly helpful. I have a compressor and I just bought a Tube Screamer for 60 bucks just to check it out.

The craftsmanship is fantastic and the tone as well. I have one and love it and I play very high gain metal/djent and it gives me that extra push I need. I keep the tone at about 7 the level around 7 and drive at zero. It's a fantastic pedal for dirt cheap.

guitarpedals,3c3nhq,holladaddy,-2,Sun Jul 5 02:10:17 2015 UTC,I am that pressed for space and I doubt I could for two if I wanted too. That's part of why I said I liked the Wally better. Though I didn't look at actual measurements only went by pictures so perhaps it's not as small as it seems. If push came to shove I'd have it off the board.
guitarpedals,3c3nhq,JacktheArcher42,3,Sun Jul 5 03:10:26 2015 UTC,Just have a standalone looper off your board and don't sacrifice features. Trust me that they become nothing more than toys if you don't allow the space needed for a full featured and well-accessible looper. The Ditto is nice in theory but I'd rather have a Mooer looper at that size because even Mooer knows to put more knobs and controls on their mini pedals than TC.  But yeah. The only thing you'd have room for if you had a Ditto would be another mini pedal. Which I'm guessing isn't the goal. Making room for a Jamman XT Solo or something would be much more worth it.  The reason I mention the Wally is because it embraces the mini-looper limitations in as many ways as possible with the playback speed knob and such.

Basically whenever you need something distorted, it'll kick its ass.  However, Big Muffs need a LOT of dialing in, depending on what you're going for.

guitarpedals,3c57jf,mountainwampus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:36:48 2015 UTC,"It is mainly because of the market. There are only a few caps and resistors changed (or omitted) between all of the versions. So it is most likely because there are fewer clones of the Civil War or Green Russian, or because there are more people making the Triangle or Violet or what have you.   The top of page kinda shows you the circuit differences between the models: http://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_guts.html"
guitarpedals,3c57jf,holladaddy,-6,Mon Jul 6 19:35:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really trust the clones. What makes the green Russian so amazing is the quality of the components. They were military surplus parts and the quality is unlike anything else you can find at modern suppliers. It's definitely worth spending $300 on one of the early ""tanklike"" sovteks because you are getting better transistors and pots and the best Muff tone available. The clones use substitute parts on a cloned circuit, thus it's not nearly as sought after as the real deal and likely doesn't sound the same."

guitarpedals,3c57jf,RushofBlood52,-3,Mon Jul 6 02:52:56 2015 UTC,"There isn't anything complex about any of these Muff circuits, but those classic pots and transistors are unattainable these days. I've built and modded many Muffs. I even have a modded Muff circuit with socketed transistors to test them. Bottom line is that the mojo comes from those particular transistors in the civil war or green Russian. Clone makers use compatible transistors, but with different # and by different manufacturers, so they are not exactly what was used in original, so physics and electricity will apply differently. Also, those old pots are 10 times higher quality than what is affordable and available today. They have a larger drum and are resistant to dust, and are likely a superior alloy. While they have less effect on the sound, the curve on those Russian pots is completely different than any pots I have ever tested. They don't follow a linear path. The resistance follows an irregular bell curve instead. This allows me to get a clean tone on my green russian with the Pi all the way down, something I've never been able to achieve on any other Muff version or clone. The stuff that was available in Russia at that time was special military surplus hardware. McMaster and Smallparts didn't have anything close to that quality when I was building pedals."
guitarpedals,3c57jf,mountainwampus,3,Sun Jul 5 15:29:03 2015 UTC,Tons of pedals use log or reverse-log pots. Not everything is linear. What are you even trying to say?
guitarpedals,3c57jf,mountainwampus,0,Mon Jul 6 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"What I get when I turn these pots is different than all my other effects.

guitarpedals,3c3lg8,YouCanCallMeTheSloth,3,Sat Jul 4 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"This pedal is gnarly. I thought it might be broken until I started playing with the volume knob on my guitar, turns out that's the most important part of the whole thing. The volume stays pretty much wherever you have the pedal set, and the guitar's volume knob takes it from warm, Big Muff territory at its lowest settings to crazy, octave fuzz at its highest, with just ridiculous amounts of sustain. The ""chaos switch"" makes everything sound broken, you get seemingly random feedback and static, but when you set your volume low, the notes still pull through... It just sounds like you're playing through an old, broken radio or something. I love this thing."

I picked it up used for around $100, so it's relatively inexpensive, doesn't take up much space at all on my board, and like u/jeremydanger said, you get a lot of sounds out of it for being a two knob pedal. I play in a three piece and have a lot of space to fill, so I love big fuzz effects and controlled feedback, this thing's perfect for that."

Blue) so I don't use overdrives or anything.  The MXR Phase 45 does the subtle warble that adds a secondary texture to chords, or melodies.  I can control the speed with my foot, so it can sound different, depending on the song and application.  It adds just the right amount of depth and is not too invasive to the natural guitar sound.  I run a lead from the guitar to the pedal and on to the amp.  I've had a vintage block logo model, but it failed, so I sold it rather than try to maintain it.  I bought a new production model and it sounds exactly the same, with all of the same nuances.  Totally worth looking at.  I have a pedalboard with a Boss Hi-Band Flanger, Boss Chorus, Boss DD-3 and DD-7, MXR Phase 45 and a couple of dirt pedals for goofing off at low volume (RAT2 and some hand-made pawnshop overdrive that I have yet to identify the circuit).  I really like the Hi-Band Flanger as well.  It has a neat warble that isn't as in-your-face as a usual flanger; more like a phaser mixed with a very very subtle chorus/phase thing.  The MXR Phase 45 is my desert island pedal.    TL;DR: MXR Phase 45, because of the subtle warble and texture for chords and melodies.

guitarpedals,3c3esn,ploogle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"either the ehx holy grail or Wattson escape velocity overdrive.   holy grail I always have on my board, and it's almost always on. I just recently got a silver face super reverb so I've been using it more subtly to add more dimension to the amp reverb which is always on.   the escape velocity is a ts808 that's been tweaked to be a super versatile overdrive. it's got a switch for normal mid hump or flat response. then there's a knob to choose where on the waveform it starts clipping. kind of like a clean blend almost."

guitarpedals,3c3esn,eShredder,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:13:50 2015 UTC,"Fuzz factory together with Big Muff Pi. The fuzz factory gives an amazing texture to the tone with the right settings (usually with a relativily high gate setting to give it some umf when the pick strikes), but it really lacks the low end on the tone no matter what settings I use. I bought mine before the fuzz factory with a low end setting was released so nothing I can do about that really. But with the Big Muff Pi after it with some 2-3 o' clock volume, tone at whatever you feel like (works at any tone really, just depends on the song and genre) and sustain at just above 11-10 o' clock just to break it up some more. Oh dear god when I first found that tone, honestly lost my mind and kept playing for 2-3 hours straight. Could not get enough of it. I use a Vox amp on the clean channel if that matters. I found this tone when I was trying to replicate the tone of Daniel Lioneye's first album. Not really the same, but it is in that direction. I believe if I ever get a chance to really turn up the volume of the amp some time it can get fairly close to that tone."
guitarpedals,3c3esn,kidkolumbo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:22:25 2015 UTC,"The most unique sound I make is a synth pad with my Zoom MS50G, but my unique pedal is probably my Behringer Bass Synthesizer, a copy of the BOss one.  I have it set to blend in an octave down saw wave, under my bass tone, and it's the basis of making all my distortions sound ridiculous."
guitarpedals,3c3esn,kwikacct,2,Sat Jul 4 22:41:13 2015 UTC,I love the Behringer bass synth. That octave down saw through a fuzz gives some of the most insanely heavy sounds I've ever managed to make with a guitar.
guitarpedals,3c3esn,pangalacticcourier,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:08:45 2015 UTC,Toss up between my 4-knob Keeley compressor or my 1983 Ibanez Tube Screamer. Sweet tones.
guitarpedals,3c3esn,thefrenzee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"Nels Cline says it sounds bad through really high watt amps like a Twin.  The hotcake in my opinion sounds best through lower wattage amps.  Sounded great when I tried it with my blues jr.    Also, the Fairfield Circuitry Barbershop OD has become incredibly necessary to my sound.  I almost want a second one onmy board."
guitarpedals,3c3esn,Radiomuted,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:46:20 2015 UTC,"My tone is mainly dirty.  Overdrive/Distortion duties have been handled for years by the Fulltone GT500.  Lately I've been running fuzz as well. Blunderbuss and Fix'd Fuzz (not the twosome. The separate pedals).   I think if I had to choose one of those 3 pedals and drop the other 2, I'd probably cry."
guitarpedals,3c3esn,LargeLoser,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:26:17 2015 UTC,"I think the pedal that makes my sound is the Green Sovtek Muff. I love that thing to death. I also have the EQD Hoof for a larger range of tones. It cleans up better than the original and has a wider tone sweep and gain range, but for the classic sound, it's the original"
guitarpedals,3c3esn,TeleFilm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:09:18 2015 UTC,Mine is also the BD-2.  It's just amazing.    I keep it cranked and control the amount of gain that comes through with the volume knob on my guitar.  Similar to what Hendrix would do with this Fuzz Face.
guitarpedals,3c3esn,Superfuzz-BigMuff,0,Sat Jul 4 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"I ran a wicker muff until a few days ago. That was pretty much my sound, but I guess any really aggressive, muffy fuzz with spring reverb and analog delay over it is ""my sound""."

guitarpedals,3c2i19,bolanrox,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:59:02 2015 UTC,Holy. Shit. Must be one hell of a fucking pedal. I've heard it on KWS' old board and it sounded pretty damn good. But a two year wait? Why? Slow production and High demand? Scarce parts?

guitarpedals,3c350m,xBuhblez,4,Sat Jul 4 08:36:05 2015 UTC,"Congrats on making money doing what you love! I'm a semi-pro acoustic gigger, having done it in my spare time doing pubs, clubs and weddings. I have a unique board which caters for a wide variety of songs and styles. But some people think I don't need a wah or a delay pedal. I say, have whatever you want to make great music!  It all depends on what you want to do music-wise. The possibilities are literally endless. But a good starting point is a tuner pedal. A looping pedal is a very common choice since artists such as Howie Day, KT Tunstall and Ed Sheeran have famously used them. A reverb pedal will help add depth and life to an acoustic guitar.   I experimented with lots of drives and distortions, but feedback was a problem so I didn't really take that anywhere. I also tried tc electronic gear (voicelive2) but found it to be more trouble than it's worth.   I would say just try different pedals and see what fits your musical style. If you don't like it or it doesn't work, you can always sell it and use the funds to buy another!   Good luck and have fun!"
guitarpedals,3c350m,AHoddy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:27:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I already have a full band board! I have an EQ pedal, a Compressor, Flashback x4, and a korg pitchblack (among other things) was just curious if there was some general ""must haves"" for solo acoustic gigs. Like I was curious if I should snag a voice Pitch correction pedal, or anything along those lines, or if I should have an EQ pedal on my board to fine tune my Acoustic tone. Or am I looking too much into it? Lmao"
guitarpedals,3c350m,soccernick2112,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:53:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say if there's any ""must-have"" pedals, it'd really be a basic reverb and maybe an EQ. I second the loop pedal suggestion for sure though. Also had a VoiceLive Play GTX, was not a fan. Any of the vocal effects would have been too much for the type of gigs I was playing (bars, coffeeshops, etc)"
guitarpedals,3c350m,AHoddy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:24:45 2015 UTC,"Haha possibly! You'd only need s pitch correction if you're vocals aren't the best or you want the robot vocal style (IMHO). Depending on your pickups, you may want to invest in a decent DI or similar. I have a fishman aura spectrum DI which effectively makes it sound like the guitar is mic'd when hooked up through the 1/4"" Jack. I recommend that :)"
guitarpedals,3c350m,MorelloWorkaholic,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"THIS. This is what I was looking for. (Trying not to sound cocky or egotisticle) but I'm a pretty good singer. I didn't think I'd need a pitch correction, just didn't know if it was smart to snag one and throw it in the line before my harmony pedal, and set the correction to very little. But I will definitely look into a DI. Thanks for your help!"
guitarpedals,3c350m,0304200013082014,2,Sat Jul 4 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"If you start investigating about loopers and delays in acoustic music you'll find out there's tons of possibilities for you right there. It'll help your music sound fuller and richer if you take the time to adjust it to your style of playing and how you wanna sound like.  Also, the drumming on the body of the guitar being looped is a really cool trick that looks awesome for the regular, non-musician attendant."

guitarpedals,3c4r8f,gretasgotagun,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:55:36 2015 UTC,"The EQ at the end wouldn't fix the problem. If the signal is boosted right before it a louder signal will still pass though and will sound quieter again when it's turned off. What you could do is put it in a single true bypass loop with a simple volume box attenuator. Set the volume where you want it and then you turn the effect on and off with the bypass pedal.   An EQ would work too but the volume box would be cheaper. They are super simple to make on your own, same with the bypass looper.   http://www.amazon.com/Carls-Custom-Guitars-Volume-Box/dp/B004ZH0PPY"
