MilitaryPorn,3e28gj,Sausagedogknows,20,Tue Jul 21 12:32:29 2015 UTC,That's actually a pretty clever poor man's camo. If they were to roll around for a bit they'd absorb the color of their surroundings like a chameleon. I wonder if they do...
MilitaryPorn,3e28gj,justheretoreadtnx,4,Tue Jul 21 15:39:48 2015 UTC,"Unless they are hiding in snow, choosing white as the base colour for any camo, is far from clever.  They could choose a darker less noticeable colour, or they could just go with standard DPM which would also absorb the dust and dirt of their surroundings without having white patches showing through."

MilitaryPorn,3e28gj,theOSINTblog,4,Tue Jul 21 16:51:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, laying in the snow, wearing white makes a lot of sense, wearing white and then laying on a contrasting background, highlighting the fact they are there, makes no sense at all.  Granted it's probably a publicity shot, or a shot from a personal album, but still, it's a shocking use of cam."
MilitaryPorn,3e28gj,Sausagedogknows,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"If they're in an area where there's snow, even if there is a rough patch of dirt, it still works.  If an enemy is glancing over the area with his naked eye from a distance all he'll think that is is a dirth patch in an otherwise snowy area and the guys lying on there is a little bit of snow probably left there.  Environment matters. If they're wearing the all white in an area where there's absolutely no snow, then yeah, they stick out like a sore thumb."
MilitaryPorn,3e28gj,GreaterIndia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"There's no other background apart from white in Siachen. Perhaps a small splotch of grey or two, but that's about it.  Also, this is the Indian armed forces we are talking about. Unlike those of advanced industrialised economies, they don't have the luxury of choosing the perfect camo for every conceivable occasion. And the Himalayas make it dofficult ot maintain multiple supply lines for something as basic as a uniform. So once they bulk-procure high-altitude clothing, they tend to issue it across the board even though the colour contrasts with the terrain in some places."

While the Soviets tested IR for tanks in 1941."
MilitaryPorn,3dzvhi,skippythemoonrock,3,Tue Jul 21 13:16:52 2015 UTC,Russia alone was turning out more than 1200 T-34s a month by 1942.
MilitaryPorn,3dzvhi,chugs1984,-16,Tue Jul 21 12:55:42 2015 UTC,"They lost because the allies knew when to bomb critical Nazi supplies that they couldn't afford to lose.  It appeared random but due to Turing, some Polish cryptologists and bletchley park they were able to literally destroy the nazis at their weak points.  The Allies were losing. If Germany had managed to spin up Europe's manufacturing capabilities, and had held north Africa and Libya's special graded oils then the Russians, who were so dependant on allied aid would have been fucked.  With England knocked out, and Russia badly mauled/out the US would have had their hands full. Especially with Japan and especially if they didnt have allied support from the British."
MilitaryPorn,3dzvhi,macragge1,10,Tue Jul 21 11:22:23 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand how Germany is meant to 'spin up' Europe's manufacturing capacity any more than they did in our timeline. A few points to consider:   Germany had an appalling shortage of industrial manpower throughout the war on account of sending three or four million men on a sightseeing tour of the continent. Obviously they couldn't use women to replace them because this would be a vulgar perversion of their one true calling which was to shoot out babies. Therefore a huge amount of German wartime industry relied on slave labour which was at the very best woefully inefficient and at worst meant that they had a goodly part of their workforce actively sabotaging the stuff that they were producing. This was especially apparent when the Nazis got a hard-on for producing immensely complex machinery like the Panther tank at the top of this post; deliberate sabotage on the production line meant that a good proportion of these quote/unquote 'superweapons' never made it to the frontlines! The Reich's logistics train was also a total gangbang - even if they were to operate at the Platonic ideal of total industrial efficiency they would still be hamstrung by the fact that the Wehrmacht is supplied almost entirely by horses and the Deutsche Reichsbahn is using a great amount of its capacity to deliver women and children into the ovens. Germany had an appalling shortage of raw materials to go with their manpower problems. They had one actual oil refinery in Ploesti and had to try and make up the deficit with fairly sketchy synthetic oil; this gets so bad that during the Ardennes Offensive in 1944 we have SS Panzer Divisions pilfering each others fuel supplies so that they can actually get to the front. It's a pretty big leap to say that Germany would have done alright if they had held on to North Africa as if they didn't try to in our timeline - unfortunately the Allies had something to say about this - and the logistics to back these words up! It was essentially impossible for the Axis to stay in North Africa for any meaningful length of time; Rommel had some early successes (albeit totally unsustainable ones) but once the Regia Marina turned out to basically be comic relief and the Allies gained almost total naval and air superiority then the Afrika Korps is either going to die on the vine or be forced to high-tail it back to mainland Europe. Whilst the Allies' overwhelming crypto-superiority was without a doubt an incredibly valuable tool it doesn't really have a great deal to do with 'bombing critical nazi supplies'; the strategic bombing of Germany wasn't a cunning scalpel but rather a sledgehammer (occasionally the RAF or USAAF would hit the wrong country) - we could put more bombers in the air than the Luftwaffe could deal with and if they got shot down we built more of them. The Thousand-Bomber Raids etcetera were a brutal manifestation of our total, absolute, complete and utter industrial supremacy and far from picking out specific targets based on ENIGMA data we simply went over and tried to wipe German cities off the map. Whilst Western Lend-Lease towards the Soviet Union was undoubtedly vital - especially in the dark days of 1941/42 - to suggest that they were totally 'dependent' on Western aid ignores the fact that the USSR managed to move their industrial base halfway across the country, rebase it out of reach of the enemy and then start outproducing the Germans in almost every meaningful way. I don't see how there's any way the UK gets knocked out of the war - especially by the time we're talking about here which seems like about '42/'43; the Home Islands are utterly unassailable and the U-Boat threat to supplying them is getting thoroughly spanked - even if Germany had access to the dankest Libyan high-grade oil there's not much they're doing against the British here. Even hypothetically unlimited oil still wouldn't help the massive disparity between the industrial bases of good and evil; when the Allies come to finish the job in '44/'45/'46 all the fuel oil in the world isn't going to help the Axis."
MilitaryPorn,3dzvhi,chugs1984,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:13 2015 UTC,"Look the manpower issue is a factor but alone was it enough to sink the Germans? Was it more important than Ultra? I don't think it was. The German war machine was immense and it took over Europe in a staggeringly fast period of time. It had immense numbers of foreign recruits, and if the war had gone on longer these recruiting efforts would have furthered these efforts.   Yes it depended on slave labour for weapons manufacturer but this was partly due to losing immense numbers of men in campaigns that failed due to Ultra. Had those men survived, had they succeeded in their objectives then the war would have been completely different.   And it was just't battles that were altered due to Ultra. The Germans were feed immense amounts of disinformation that was based on Ultra intercepts. Confusing the enemy, giving them bad intelligence meant that the Germans were at a huge disadvantage.   This gave the Allies and the USSR enough time to spool up their industrial military complex. However, imagine if the Germans hadn't invaded the USSR when it did.   The crux of the war lay in North Africa. Rommel's north Africa invasion was about oil, and the number one reason why he lost was due to Ultra intercepts giving the allies precise targeting information on replacements, spare parts and supplies critical for Rommel's campaign.    ""Ultra decrypts from Bletchley Park provided Alexander with precise details of all shipping movements between Italy and NOrth Africa (to a level that Wavell and Auchinleck had never enjoyed), as a result the RAF managed to sink more Axis tankers than reached their destination"" [1]   The Germans losses in North Africa were immense, let alone what was destroyed enroute. 8,000 aircraft, over 130,000 Wehrmacht captured, and not just shitty reserves, these were the prime of the Wehrmacht along with its best commander. Over 340,000 Italians captured! 30,000 dead Germans and Italians.  Wounded of tens of thousands.   70,000 vehicles and 2500 Tanks destroyed in theater. These losses were irreplaceable. They were battle harden troops that would have been moved into the western front for the invasion of England had they not been lost.  Now imagine Rommel had won North Africa and imagine those numbers were allied losses. Imagine North Africa under Axis control.   Now think of the other really critical war at the time. The battle of Britian. As a precursor to Operation Barbarossa the Germans needed air superiority over England. Goeing's campaign to destroy the RAF had almost succeeded.   Though with the Luftwaffe fighting into two theaters they were stretched. Yet in my scenario the Luftwaffe is able to move several thousand aircraft back to the Western France.   The RAF were weeks away from annihilation already when the Germans began bombing civilian targets thus giving the RAF breathing space to recover and destroy the last of the Luftwaffe's offensive capabilities.  In turn RAF airfields were rebuilt, and operations changed from defensive to to that of strategic bombing.   Yet in my scenario Ultra doesn't exist. The allies don't have the confidence of knowing the Luftwaffe order of battle. They can't see the Luftwaffe beginning major operations. The confidence of the Allied planners and their success prior to Ultra was debatable. British Expeditionary Force is a really good illustration of how lousy the Allies were without Ultra.   The Allies made great claims about their radar capability to cover the fact they were using Ultra. This disinformation was used to confuse the Germans about the success of their operations on the RAF.   Ultra allowed the Allies to attack critical oil/fuel supplies which had the unintended consequence of pushing the Germans to launch against the USSR, with southern Caucasus oil as a primary target.   Had Ultra not existed the Germans would have destroyed the RAF. They would have had air superiority and in turn would have invaded England, moving forces from North Africa to assist.   Without fighting to fronts, without England as a staging point for Allied aid to the USSR, and with loss of England the Allied war effort would have been dealt a huge blow. Seriously think about England being lost. No Malta conference. No USSR being attacked for southern Caucasus oil.  I'm sure the Germans would have invaded the USSR but they would have done it much later and on their own terms and not because they were forced to do so.  Seriously who would have been left? The US, Canada and Australia. With the war in the pacific sapping a huge amount of resources and with German support who knows how Japan would have progressed? Without the British to provide scientific and material resources to the Manhatten project would it have been ready at that point?  With the Germans able to consolidate Europe, England and North Africa the entire war would be completely different. What would the US have done? Yes the US had a huge amount of manufacturing but the advanced weapons being built by the Germans were coming online. Strategic long range bombers, submarines, nuclear weapons research. All of that happening without any allied strategic bombing.   The English contribution to Manhatten was immense. Without it the US wouldn't have had made a bomb by 1945.   A lot of German aid to Japan was intercepted because of Ultra. Again imagine if this had not happened. Imagine Japanese aircraft flying with BMW engines? Flying with more armor on their fuel tanks. Imagine the Japanese had moved to Engima? Hell the US success against the Japanese was primarily because of intelligence intercepts as well.   Anyway I don't think you should shit on me as hard as you guys have. I think there is a huge amount of evidence that exists that the confidence that Ultra gave was massive for Allied planners. Knowing where the enemy was going to be, what they were doing, their posture, heading and numbers is a stupendously massive advantage.   There were a lot of battles that required Ultra in order to succeed.     [1] Destiny in the Desert: The road to El Alamein - the Battle that Turned the Tide  By Jonathan Dimbleby"
MilitaryPorn,3dzvhi,macragge1,5,Tue Jul 21 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"Clearly there's a bunch of stuff we disagree on but I appreciate the comprehensive and well presented reply! I've still got some stuff I'd possibly dispute so I'll offer it to you below!   Look the manpower issue is a factor but alone was it enough to sink the Germans? Was it more important than Ultra? I don't think it was. The German war machine was immense and it took over Europe in a staggeringly fast period of time. It had immense numbers of foreign recruits, and if the war had gone on longer these recruiting efforts would have furthered these efforts.   I would posit that the manpower issue - as part of the fundamental issue that Germany was just completely, hopelessly outmatched in terms of resources - was indeed more important than the Ultra deceptions. Granted, Germany made astonishing gains in 1939/1940 but as  these were either against almost helpless neutrals (Belgium, Norway, Denmark etc) or larger powers that hadn't yet caught up in terms of mobilization or re-armament (Poland, France, the UK). The Nazi economy had been geared up entirely towards war for several years and this meant that very early on they had something of an advantage. By 1941 the UK, the USSR and the USA have geared up towards total war and their industrial advantage over the Axis is literally unstoppable.  I would dispute the claim that the Germans had an 'immense' amount of foreign recruits; there were a substantial number, yes, but compared to the manpower available to the USSR, the USA and the entire British Empire (and eventually essentially the entire free world) they weren't particularly significant. I might also point out that a great deal of these foreign recruits were used in second-line divisions that weren't particularly well-equipped or useful in actual battle; the reliability of these formations under pressure is also extremely suspect  - see the mass surrenders of Eastern European 'volunteers' almost instantaneously during the Normandy Landings or the craven side-switching of the self styled 'Russian Liberation Army' in 1945.   Yes it depended on slave labour for weapons manufacturer but this was partly due to losing immense numbers of men in campaigns that failed due to Ultra. Had those men survived, had they succeeded in their objectives then the war would have been completely different.   I would disagree with this; the German war economy - even before the great defeats of '43 onwards - was suffering from serious structural issues; note how after the defeat of France in 1940 we had a large demobilization of the German armed forces to go back into industry and agriculture because even a few months of mobilization had brutalized the Reich's economy. Even at the apex of German military success immediately prior to Operation Barbarossa in mid-1941 Speer and Ley were having to pull 'guestarbeiters' from the conquered territories in order to keep the economy moving. Even when the Axis were winning in Russia it was still a commitment of three million men on the Eastern Front alone; this wasn't only a huge proportion of able-bodied German men, but a huge proportion of the population as a whole!  I would argue that there weren't any Axis campaigns that failed solely as a result of ULTRA; certainly it was an incredibly useful tool for the Allies to use - for defeating the U-Boats, for deceptions in NW Europe) but the Axis lost simply because logistically they were totally beaten by the Allies. The Germans could have won battle after battle and it would have made no difference in the long term.   And it was just't battles that were altered due to Ultra. The Germans were feed immense amounts of disinformation that was based on Ultra intercepts. Confusing the enemy, giving them bad intelligence meant that the Germans were at a huge disadvantage.   Agreed, but I would argue that it was far from the main disadvantage that the Axis faced.   This gave the Allies and the USSR enough time to spool up their industrial military complex. However, imagine if the Germans hadn't invaded the USSR when it did.   The Allies essentially had all the time they wanted to gear up for total war because the Germans couldn't even hope to touch the majority of their industrial base; Britain can be bombed and blockaded but this was ineffective and by '41/'42 the country is invulnerable. The USSR risked losing a lot of their industrial capacity so they just moved them across the Urals where the Axis couldn't touch them. The USA - an industrial base almost as powerful as the rest of the world combined is literally untouchable.   The Germans invaded the USSR in '41 because they had no real choice:   The German economy was a pilfering economy that relied on constant conquest in order to avoid collapse; Hitler needed the breadbasket that was the Ukraine, the oil of the Caucasus etcetera because the German economy would implode otherwise. Stalin knew that war with Germany was inevitable and was re-arming and re-organizing his army at an alarming rate; the Red Army was starting to recover from having been gutted in the purges of the late 1930's and the humiliations of the Russo-Finnish war in '39/'40. If Hitler didn't move in mid-41 then he would have to wait for mid-42; by this point Stalin will be ready to fight and America will probably have joined the war. Nazi ideology was based around a great showdown against 'Jewish Bolshevism' and as far as everyone in the OKW was concerned this was the one chance to defeat and destroy the Soviet Union        The crux of the war lay in North Africa. Rommel's north Africa invasion was about oil, and the number one reason why he lost was due to Ultra intercepts giving the allies precise targeting information on replacements, spare parts and supplies critical for Rommel's campaign.   I would argue that, far from the crux of the war, the North African campaign was a total sideshow. The Germans only got involved because the Italians had completely collapsed and were about to lose Tripoli; after this there was an immense amount of mission creep that meant ended up with the Afrika Korps trying to take the Suez Canal despite having nowhere near the logistical capacity to do so.  The crux of the war was the Eastern Front; between 75 and 80 percent of the German Armed Forces were engaged there and about 85-90% of casualties were sustained there. The Axis defeat in the North Africa theatre led to the loss of some materiel and Rommel's flight to the continent. The Axis defeat on the Eastern Front ended with the Hammer and Sickle flying overt the Reichstag.   The Germans losses in North Africa were immense, let alone what was destroyed enroute. 8,000 aircraft, over 130,000 Wehrmacht captured, and not just shitty reserves, these were the prime of the Wehrmacht along with its best commander. Over 340,000 Italians captured! 30,000 dead Germans and Italians. Wounded of tens of thousands. 70,000 vehicles and 2500 Tanks destroyed in theater. These losses were irreplaceable. They were battle harden troops that would have been moved into the western front for the invasion of England had they not been lost.   These losses were bad but nothing compared to what was being lost on the Eastern Front - Germany lost more tanks at the Battle of Kursk than they did in the whole North African Campaign. I would agree that the losses were irreplacable.  I would disagree that Rommel was the Wehrmacht's best commander; certainly he had tactical flair but the fact that time and time again he overextended himself and completely outran his supply lines means that he was a pretty awful General.  There is literally no chance that the Germans could successfully invade the United Kingdom; the idea that they could do it after the North African campaign of 42/43 is totally unthinkable; the German Navy's surface fleet was either sunk or in hiding and had no amphibious capability - even ignoring this, the UK is now the worlds biggest aircraft carrier and army encampment with countless fully equipped Commonwealth and US divisions - Hitler genuinely had more chance of conquering the moon.   Now imagine Rommel had won North Africa and imagine those numbers were allied losses. Imagine North Africa under Axis control.   Wouldn't really make a difference - just a lot of Germans kicking their heels in the desert whilst Red tanks storm into Germany.   Now think of the other really critical war at the time. The battle of Britian. As a precursor to Operation Barbarossa the Germans needed air superiority over England. Goeing's campaign to destroy the RAF had almost succeeded. Though with the Luftwaffe fighting into two theaters they were stretched. Yet in my scenario the Luftwaffe is able to move several thousand aircraft back to the Western France. The RAF were weeks away from annihilation already when the Germans began bombing civilian targets thus giving the RAF breathing space to recover and destroy the last of the Luftwaffe's offensive capabilities. In turn RAF airfields were rebuilt, and operations changed from defensive to to that of strategic bombing.   ULTRA intercepts certainly helped us tactically in during the Battle of Britain but the Germans were at a hopeless strategic disadvantage anyway - I'll reproduce some replies I gave for some similar points on the BoB recently in Part 2 but I'm at the word limit here!"
MilitaryPorn,3dzvhi,macragge1,3,Tue Jul 21 16:48:32 2015 UTC,"PART 2   Even if the airfields in the south were removed from the equation (which I might suggest is very difficult) the RAF can still cover the south of England from airfields further north that are essentially out of range of the Luftwaffe; the UK still has all the advantages in both fighter production and pilot numbers (much more effective training then the Luftwaffe, plus the fact that downed RAF airmen can get back into the fight whereas downed Germans are interned!) Hitler didn't become impatient and switch to terror bombing arbitrarily; after September the Luftwaffe had essentially been completely defeated in the air in daylight, losing half their total bomber and fighter strength. The choice to target cities - at night - was a reaction to the fact that the RAF had essentially won the major phase of the Battle of Britain.    Ultra allowed the Allies to attack critical oil/fuel supplies which had the unintended consequence of pushing the Germans to launch against the USSR, with southern Caucasus oil as a primary target.   The Axis had one proper oil refinery in Romania; I would posit that it didn't take a great deal of ULTRA encryptions to work out that we needed to bomb the shit out of it.   Had Ultra not existed the Germans would have destroyed the RAF. They would have had air superiority and in turn would have invaded England, moving forces from North Africa to assist.   Impossible I'm afraid.   Without fighting to fronts, without England as a staging point for Allied aid to the USSR, and with loss of England the Allied war effort would have been dealt a huge blow. Seriously think about England being lost. No Malta conference. No USSR being attacked for southern Caucasus oil. I'm sure the Germans would have invaded the USSR but they would have done it much later and on their own terms and not because they were forced to do so.    As I say the Home Islands are completely indefatigable and if Germany doesn't roll the dice in mid-'41 then it never gets a chance to attack the USSR.   Seriously who would have been left? The US, Canada and Australia.   India, China, New Zealand, Free France, Latin America, South Africa...   With the war in the pacific sapping a huge amount of resources and with German support who knows how Japan would have progressed? Without the British to provide scientific and material resources to the Manhatten project would it have been ready at that point?   The absolute unstoppable majesty of American industrial superiority meant that they were able to outproduce both the European and SE Asian Axis simultaneously; Japan's industrial weakness made Germany look like a complete powerhouse!    Given that the German Navy and surface fleet both really, really sucked I don't think there's any way they could meaningfully support the Japanese on the other side of the world; in our timeline a few subs with blueprints sneaked through but I wouldn't want to be the Germans going against the US Pacific Fleet and their 10 aircraft carriers.  Assuming all of the Brits in the Manhattan project are lost when the UK is somehow defeated (strange, given most were working in the US) then the Manhattan Project is slowed down but it's still gonna happen a hundred years before the Axis get the bomb.   With the Germans able to consolidate Europe, England and North Africa the entire war would be completely different. What would the US have done? Yes the US had a huge amount of manufacturing but the advanced weapons being built by the Germans were coming online. Strategic long range bombers, submarines, nuclear weapons research. All of that happening without any allied strategic bombing.   The Germans had strategic bombers and nuclear weapons drawn on the back of napkins. The Allies were destroying cities with them. Even assuming we handwave that the Germans somehow have fuel and stuff for all of these 'superweapons' it doesn't change the fact that the Allies can build thirty times as many of whatever the Germans put out. The Nazi's disdain for 'Jewish Science' meant that Germany was pursuing a complete dead-end in 'Heavy Water'. The Allies detonated their first viable nuclear device on July 16, 1945.   The English contribution to Manhatten was immense. Without it the US wouldn't have had made a bomb by 1945.   Maybe, but I still wouldn't want to be hanging round Berlin in 1946!   A lot of German aid to Japan was intercepted because of Ultra. Again imagine if this had not happened. Imagine Japanese aircraft flying with BMW engines? Flying with more armor on their fuel tanks. Imagine the Japanese had moved to Engima? Hell the US success against the Japanese was primarily because of intelligence intercepts as well.   Tbh the Japanese could have had Gundam Suits for all the good it would do once we got the Atomic Bomb; still wouldn't have had any fuel for them.  As with everything else, the US success against the Japanese was because America could put out 10 CVs for every one the Japanese did, 50 fighters for every Japanese fighter etcetera etcetera.   Anyway I don't think you should shit on me as hard as you guys have. I think there is a huge amount of evidence that exists that the confidence that Ultra gave was massive for Allied planners. Knowing where the enemy was going to be, what they were doing, their posture, heading and numbers is a stupendously massive advantage.  There were a lot of battles that required Ultra in order to succeed.    I wouldn't say we've shit on you; we disagree on a whole lot of stuff but I think it's been a pretty fair and friendly discussion!  I don't think anyone's disagreeing that ULTRA was a hugely useful tactical tool and had some strategic value. Essentially, though, it only won battles. It was the Allies' total, total,total,total,total industrial superiority and vastly superior logistics that was the key reason why we won the war."

Yet in my scenario the Luftwaffe is able to move several thousand aircraft back to the Western France.    You might want to have a look at the dates, X. Fliegerkorps only move to Sicily at the beginning of 1941.   The RAF were weeks away from annihilation already when the Germans began bombing civilian targets thus giving the RAF breathing space to recover and destroy the last of the Luftwaffe's offensive capabilities.   Highly debatable; the Luftwaffe were losing the battle of attrition, and never knocked out a sector station for a significant length of time, or indeed any airfield apart from, briefly, Manston. (Bungay, Most Dangerous Enemy; Overy, The Battle of Britain: Myth and Reality, Holland, The Battle of Britain).    Yet in my scenario Ultra doesn't exist. The allies don't have the confidence of knowing the Luftwaffe order of battle.    Even with Ultra, the RAF consistently overestimated Luftwaffe strength (in particular reserves, once front-line strength was better understood from sigint) (Cox, A Comparative Analysis of RAF and Luftwaffe Intelligence in the Battle of Britain, 1940)   Had Ultra not existed the Germans would have destroyed the RAF. They would have had air superiority and in turn would have invaded England, moving forces from North Africa to assist.    Even if the RAF are somehow completely wiped out, it's very unlikely Sealion would be able to land, let alone resupply, a powerful enough invasion force in the face of the Royal Navy."

MilitaryPorn,3dzw91,LaserGlitch,7,Tue Jul 21 11:31:43 2015 UTC,"The general principle behind a night vision device consist of three parts. First is a photocathode which is a screen that releases an electron when struck by a photon (of any colour, including infrared light, which is invisible to the naked eye).  You then amplify this electron (modern night vision uses a microchannel tube. You can think of this as an avalanche effect, where one electron drags more and more electrons with it as it goes through the tube).  The last part is a phosphor screen, which when struck by an electron will release a photon.  So when a photon hits the lens of the night vision device it becomes an electron, this electron is multiplied, and each of these are turned back into photons. So one photon (even of colours you can't see) will turn into a lot of photons of a colour that you can see (this is also why you can't see different colours through the device)  That is the general gist of how night vision works.  These very early night vision devices did not amplify the light, but they would still convert infrared light into visible light. They were therefore used with an IR projector, so you have a huge search light that can only be seen through the night vision device."
