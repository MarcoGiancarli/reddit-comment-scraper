PickAnAndroidForMe,3e23m1,Unlifer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:34 2015 UTC,don't touch the s6 if battery if your first priority.
PickAnAndroidForMe,3e23m1,acondie13,0,Tue Jul 21 18:38:15 2015 UTC,"Nexus aren't known for battery life and cameras... So no point waiting for a Nexus 5 refresh. Galaxy S6 doesn't have great battery life either.  G4 is good because it has removable battery and an excellent camera. Another option for you is Xperia Z3 and OnePlus One, these two phones have good battery life and good cameras."

PickAnAndroidForMe,3dz2ec,Outbackroo,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:00 2015 UTC,Any idea when that'll be announced/released?
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dz2ec,Outbackroo,3,Mon Jul 20 18:39:11 2015 UTC,October is when Google usually announces their phones. I know its a few months away but it should be well worth it
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dz2ec,Newcdn,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:29 2015 UTC,When do they usually release the phones?

On the tablet side, I'd recommend looking at the Nvidia shield, and Xperia Z3 tablet compact. Both about 8"", super fast, front facing speakers. xperia tablet can stream games from a ps4, shield tablet can stream from a pc (might or might not matter for you. Can actually do both with a little side loading of apps.) Ps4 additionally benefits from being waterproof, while the shield has a stylus. Both are excellent though."
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dy77r,acondie13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:53 2015 UTC,"I can't get the shield because it is unavailable here. I did look into the xperia one and it does look neat. I do have a question though.  Beside stats that I can check myself like battery life, I wondered about it's successor. I have seen the xperia z4 tablet, and wondered if there would be a compact version."

You may want to hold the search until we see the stats and price on the Two."
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dw4sl,disasterzero,4,Mon Jul 20 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"But the OnePlus Two will be too expensive for me, and I'm expecting a drop on the price of the OnePlus One when the two is released."
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dw4sl,disasterzero,4,Mon Jul 20 01:03:23 2015 UTC,"It's all a guessing game right now, but most articles I've seen have said it should be under 300 euros.    Edit: It's actually under 300 Pounds, not euros.  Sorry, I use dollars and got the symbol messed up."
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dw4sl,biersackarmy,3,Mon Jul 20 01:08:08 2015 UTC,"Customer support is definitely not as good as brand name manufacturers, but if you buy a OPO today it is HIGHLY unlikely that you will get the (mostly touchscreen) issues that everyone whines about for some reason without any personal experience with it. I've had 4 OPOs since they were first released and my 5th is on the way, never had an issue with any of them."
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dw4sl,biersackarmy,2,Mon Jul 20 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"That's some great news.  BTW, since you are so accustomed to the OnePlus One do you recommend me to root my device and install the Cyanogenmod 12s or the Oxygen Os? I don't understand much of these things but I would just follow the guides. Is it really necessary or do you think only hardcore users need it?"
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dw4sl,DEEPfrom1,2,Mon Jul 20 01:07:54 2015 UTC,"Mine was running stock 12S and I felt no reason to root it. All my other phones are rooted to either tweak visual options that are already available to tweak in CM12S out of the box, or to install CM altogether. With the OPO I find the stock ROM to be more then enough. Of course that's personally subjective, maybe you'd have different reasons you'd want to root yours.   Just a bit of advice I give to people who get an OPO, go into MaxxAudio settings for the loudspeaker, turn it on, set EQ to small speakers preset, MaxxTreble to 100% and MaxxBass to 50%. This makes the speaker sound MUCH better then it does out of the box, it's a night and day difference."
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dw4sl,FinibusBonorum,2,Mon Jul 20 02:06:38 2015 UTC,"It'd a wonderful phone.  I have had mine for 10 months,  without  single issue. I recommend it,  especially since it fits in your budget."
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dw4sl,anandroiduser,0,Mon Jul 20 08:54:13 2015 UTC,Good luck finding the OPO under €300. The website says 299 but stores and auctions list it at 429 - what a ripoff!   Sounds nice but way too expensive.
PickAnAndroidForMe,3dw4sl,anandroiduser,0,Mon Jul 20 15:39:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely pick the OnePlus One up while you can. Since OnePlus is a small company, the OPO will no longer be sold after the OP2 is released. I've had my OPO for a while and have never had an issue with it."
