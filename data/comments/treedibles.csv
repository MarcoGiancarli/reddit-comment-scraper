Why butter and not coconut oil? What's the pro of using the ice water bath?  Doesn't that knock off some of the trichomes?  I ask because it's a step in making bubble hash to do just that. Any concerns with inconsistent decarbing because the material is wet?"

To melt the chocolate I had a double pot with boiling water in the bottom and the chocolate up top. For chocolate I used Ghirardelli melting chocolate (dark) and mixed in about a tablespoon of liquid soy lecithin. Once the chocolate was melted, I took the bho out of the freezer and began vigorously stirring it into the chocolate mixture. Once the mixture had been sufficiently blended, I poured the mixture into a candy mold and then refrigerated until solid. 1-2 pieces = a trip to the moon. 3-4 pieces = a trip to bed."

treedibles,3dvc7l,dewbles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:54:56 2015 UTC,Thc tends to have a ceiling effect where after a certain point more doesn't elicit any extra effects it's best to wait to come off the first dose a bit before doing more   Also a good way to build a huge tolerance eat edibles all day/everyday  Should also clarify that eating more while high can prolong the high a bit more but will not increase it

treedibles,3dvc7l,laserbong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"I've never met anyone who doesn't get more high from smoking more. Though, I will say that whatever amount you intend to smoke, the faster you smoke it the better/higher the peak will be. But I wouldn't call that a ceiling. Maybe a soft ceiling - even though it has diminishing returns because you're already high, you can still get all the way up there by continuing to ingest more. This is seldom economical, of course.   I mean, unless the ceiling you refer to is the point where you fall asleep from it. I've definitely wasted a lot of edibles by surpassing that limit too quickly. Waking from trippy dreams, already too stoned out of your mind to stand up, not knowing what day it is or whether the time on the clock is am or pm is an experience, for sure."

I couldn't imagine that being my first time with the stuff at all. I made three nutella firecracker sandwich thingies. I originally planned on eating just one of them but said screw it and ate all three. It was...intense. The smell from decarbing/baking was minimal but I cooked just enough for what I was consuming. Check out http://www.thestonerscookbook.com/recipe/firecrackers and adjust for your oven/tolerance etc. I repeat, do not over estimate your tolerance one sandwich a piece should be good assuming your bud is half decent.

treedibles,3dhnlk,Biscuits4Lunch,7,Thu Jul 16 14:43:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that eating decarbed bud will get you slightly high but that's not what I was referring to. If you eat decarbed bud without dissolving it in fats or alcohol it get's absorbed into you bloodstream MUCH more slowly because it takes longer to break down plant matter than fats or alcohol. Because it absorbs more slowly eating it plain, you might get a slight high for a 6 hours rather than an awesome high for 3. It's like time release verses fast acting pills.

You can fit about a gram midgrade bud per tbsp fat so I don't think they have a high enough fat content to be able to do anything with unless you ate a half cup of avocado to yourself. Also you would need to let it absorb into the fat for a long time because they can't be cooked to speed up the process like you can with butter.

I won't argue that it's more micronutrient dense than avocado, because it's not, but there's still plenty of good stuff in there, vitamins/minerals, fiber, protein.   Real peanut butter is healthy food. I think one of the main reasons for its use, other than the obvious fat content and consistency which is great to mix with AVB, is that the flavor is so strong, and especially mixed with something like nutella, it masks the nasty AVB taste very well.

At the end, I rinse the oil in hot water and allow a pot of water and oil to cool in that fridge. The nasty green grassy flavors come put in the water which is a gross muddy color. This step lightens the oil in color and greatly mellows the taste.   Good luck."
treedibles,3dj0i8,Need4Trees,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:44 2015 UTC,"Yes,use coconut oil. It is 100% saturated fat verses around 80% for regular american butter (there are industry standards). This means you can fit more THC into a smaller amount of material. You could also go with clarified butter or ghee (Indian clarified butter which has been caramelized very slightly). Both are near 100% butterfat. I've never used soy lecithin but I've heard it works very well to increase bioavailability (absorbs more quickly into your bloodstream) I like water extraction: decarbed ground bud, a decent amount of water and coconut oil in a mason jar sealed. Place jar in a pot of water and simmer for 3hrs (what I do) or however long you feel is necessary. Strain through a cheese cloth and put in the freezer until the oil separates and solidifies. Pick up the butter out of the water and scrape off the brown stuff on the bottom (excess plant material). Remelt butter in a double boiler, add soy lecithin and cook for 1/2 hr. The double boiler will regulate temp for you, it can't go above 212°. I like this process the best because you can leave it cooking for a very long time without having to worry about overheating. A lot of ovens are inaccurate and get hot spots."
treedibles,3dj0i8,Cannabrew,2,Thu Jul 16 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"You've got 2 solid links there, either one of those would work wonders.  I especially like the video at 2:50, where it shows what you're looking for in the decarb.  The decarb is the most important step, as that's what makes your THC available for consumption.  You could eat a handful of bud right then and there if you wanted to and get the full effects, but cooking the bud in fat or alcohol will pull the THC away from the plant material.  I like to boil my decarbed bud with a stick of butter, since that makes for a more neutral flavored cannabutter, but that's just personal preference.  If you do take my route, just let the water mixture cool, strain it into a pitcher, and put it in the fridge overnight.  All of your butter will form a disk on top of some gross liquid (which should be discarded), and you can use the butter immediately, or freeze it after covering it with wax paper and plastic wrap for a rainy day."

If you've already got it, I believe the recommended amount is 1 tsp per stick of butter.  There are pepole who love Lecithin for giving their treats a stronger kick, and there are some who are worried about potential health risks.  I recommend you do your own research on Soy Lecithin, and come to your own conclusions.  Your butter will be awesome either way, I promise!"

So I usually melt a little bit of chocolate, (usually just enough for one person because this won't be extremely strong. Although it depends on how much bud you used) and then stir in the leftover weed. Then I'll pour it out into a cup lined with wax paper, or a silicone mold if you have one, and place it in the freezer. When it has solidified you have a little weed chocolate!

treedibles,3dettc,GreyBeardEnt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:24:42 2015 UTC,Correct.  A simple alcohol extraction like the ones in the sidebar will work well.  Ethanol has a fairly low boiling point (much lower than coconut oil and most cannaboids) which makes it easy to cook it off.

treedibles,3d5qm3,happyself,3,Mon Jul 13 22:45:25 2015 UTC,I de-carb 7 gs of bud. Place bud in cheese cloth and place in Mason jar. Add I cup of cocnut oil and one cup of water. Close lid. Place in crock pot half way full of water or more. Place Mason jar in crock pot. Allow it to simmer for 4-8 hours. Just a slight bubble going on. Remove Mason jar. Allow to cool just enough that you can handle the jar and content without burning yourself. Remove cheese cloth/  marijuana tea bag. Squeeze as much liquid out of tea bag as possible with other contents of Mason jar. Put in fridge and allow Mason jar to cool. Coconut oil and water will separate. Poke hole in coconut oil and drain water. You now have I cup of marijuana infused coconut oil. A batch of Betty crocker brownies calls for 1/3 a cup of oil in the recipe. You can get a decent dose off one third of cup. If you want them really strong add more oil but with one cup of oil you can make three batches and cut them into 16 pieces.

treedibles,3d5qm3,Not_So_Slim_Shady_,2,Tue Jul 14 02:47:34 2015 UTC,"You would close the lid on the Mason jar. Using a mason jar minimizes  the amount of clean up. Also you don't want to cook the oil, you want to heat it evenly for a long time. When you put all ingredients in the jar and then place the jar in a crock pot of water you are kind of heating indirectly. In cooking its called a ""bain Marie"" (Spelling?). Also using a mason jar keeps all the smell in the jar. You can also decarb your weed in Mason jars as well. This reduces smell. In order to get a good batch of marijuana infused cooking oil you have to decarb your weed. The potency depends on strain and how well you completed the process."

It did take like a full 2-3 days to dry right next to a window since I didn't have a fan so I'm worried a bit but this change in fluffiness happened while inside the jar and not after when in contact with air.  They were kept submerged by a 1 liter bottle of Coke that I cut in half. I made a couple holes with a knife and the mason jar I used was smaller towards the end so it created a good 'seal' to keep it in place while keeping every bud submerged."

If you're able to measure everything, go with Colorado's dosage recommendation of 10mg of THC per serving, then eat one serving every 1-2 hours until you're close to the zone you want to chill at.  Leave some tolerance room for the high to gradually climb up higher on its own too.    What should I expect as a first timer doing edibles   It's similar to the process of getting drunk:  It starts off social, euphoric, fun and energetic, then everything is in party mode for a few hours.

I know from experience, that decarbed flower doesn't have much flavor left.  This isn't a problem when you're gonna use in with strong flavored ingredients (chocolate, peanut butter, etc), but if you want the flavor of the flower to shine through I can see the reasoning for a shorter decarb."

I've also replied to /u/Cdresden down there, I'll paste it here for your convenience, because I would like a few opinions on this before I get started:   I follow the EdibleOnly's comprehensive guide in the sidebar, and that decarbs before the oil. I have a crock pot sized cooker I use for the oil, that will probably work for the tincture. How long will that need to be heated? Would vacuum purging it expedite the process, or reduce it too much?"
treedibles,3cxrna,dewbles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:15:29 2015 UTC,"Well I would be doing this with some concentrates and not flower or abv or something but I'm assuming you're working with flowers. What I'd do in that case is get some everclear preferably 95% alcohol, put decarbed flower into a jar with lid, add enough everclear to cover material . A longer soak will extract a little more green stuff and flavor but with vigorous shaking honestly 5 min with 95%will extract most of the goods without getting too nasty or leave it for a day or for a week. Then evaporate it down some til you have like an Oz of liquid or less and work with that.  If it's 95 and you aren't in a rush just leave the lid off the jar,  otherwise some gentle heating will help evap the alcohol. Then add the tincture to the stuff while you're mixing it. To even it you could mix half into the peanut butter and the rest into the choc/butterscotch topping"
treedibles,3cxrna,Cdresden,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with dewbles.  Decarboxylate the weed in the oven rather than in butter, then make a tincture using Everclear or 100 proof vodka.  Actually, 151 proof rum would also work great; a bit of rum flavor wouldn't be a bad thing in scotcheroos (or would scotch, for that matter, but you want to use a high proof liquor).  After the tincture is made, I'd reduce it down to where you're only adding a couple tablespoons of liquid (or less) to the recipe.  It's best to do this on an electric range, rather than a gas range.  Having a vent fan on above your stove will help remove the alcohol vapor.  If it does catch fire during reduction, that's not a big deal; cooks flame off the alcohol in a saute all the time.  If the tincture catches flame, just quickly turn off the heat and cover the pot with a cookie sheet or something, then let it cool down for a couple of minutes."

treedibles,3cxn3a,angelcake,3,Sat Jul 11 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"Decarbing is something you need to do as a part of your prep before adding the oil.  It makes your edibles much more potent.  If I had an oz, properly processed, I could make at least 6 dozen potent cookies.    Decarbing changes the THC into a form that your body can more readily use.  If you google ""cannabis Decarbing"" or check the sidebar you can get a more sciencey explanation  To decarb put the ground weed in the mason jar, seal it and put it in your oven at ~210F for 45 mins. Allow it to cool while still sealed and then add your oil, seal the jar, swish it to mix and carry on with the simmering process."

When the machine cycle is finished, the lights turn off and you can open it and pour what ever you made.   Some people say the magical butter machine isnt worth buying since plenty of people make canna butter and oil at home. I have it because my friend's gf didn't want it in their apartment so he gave it to me and i love it. You dont need it to make butter, oil, etc. but it does make it extremely convenient. It also decarbs the bud for you. Ive read that you should decarb your bud in the over first even if you are using a magical butter machine but i dont do that. I put everything in and push a button"

Can I infuse the abv and fresh stuff into the oil at the same time?   yes but decarb the fresh bud.   Would it be worth it to try and strain the oil before cooling it when it has that much plant matter in it?   you don't want to let the oil fully cool before you strain it, but you want to wait a little while to avoid burning yourself.  also look into lecithin to boost potency and also read about the version where you do 1 cook, freeze the unstrained product overnight, then thaw and cook it a second time.

treedibles,3cgrd3,Cannabrew,4,Tue Jul 7 23:25:16 2015 UTC,"Good advice.  FYI the psychoactive contents only need a very brief exposure to your solvent for this kind of extraction. Any longer than ~1 minute just extracts the nasties you don't want (like plant fats, chlorophyll etc) that give the final product a black colour, a nasty ass, harsh taste.  For best results with plant matter (ie bud or trimmings), freeze the finely ground plant material and alcohol for a few hours before so they're as cold as possible. Then, mix them together (in a glass jar, or whatever) and agitate for 1 minute then strain the plant matter immediately. The alcohol solution should be a nice golden colour for best results - not green or black.  You'll end up with a much cleaner, better tasting final product this way and the difference in yield is completely unnoticeable.  Cannabis resin readily dissolves in an alcohol solvent, when your bud is finely ground the alcohol dissolves the good stuff almost instantly.  I know your comment is directed for stems in this case, but I've been extracting this way for years and figured I'd help a fellow oil head out :)"

Soak it longer than a minute and you'll end up with a nasty, harsh black oil. The longer you soak it, the nastier it gets.  Think about it: what do you think a powerful solvent does to plant matter over time? Rookies with limited plant matter tell themselves they're getting a more efficient extraction with longer soak times (some people soak for 24 hours or more), but all this does is pollute the final product.  Dont take this anonymous internet stranger's advice though, try it for yourself. Split your plant matter into 2 (or more) batches and experiment. It's an incredibly fast, cheap and simple process. You'll very quickly see what I'm talking about: the look, smell and taste of a 1 minute wash produces a far superior product with a negligible change in yield to that of longer a soak.

Decarbing is definitely necessary as the THC-a decarbs at a much slower rate once infused into oil. Make sure your slow cooker doesn't have any hot spots that could overheat your oil. I prefer water extraction over using just oil as it protects the cannabinoids from overheating and allows the chlorophyll to be absorbed by the water.

treedibles,3camm7,the_goats,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"Here's what I did: I ground up a gram of hash, put it in the jar along with 75-100ml of coconut oil. I first boiled the jar for about an hour and a half, then i put it in the oven at 200C for half an hour. I suspect the oven might have been too much because there was quite a bit of smoke and the product was a lot darker than when it went inside. There's a bit of black residue on the bottom, leftover plant material I think? It smells halfway between toasty and burned."
treedibles,3camm7,elcoopadero,4,Mon Jul 6 12:28:01 2015 UTC,"200C is WAY too high to be decarbing at. The boiling point of THC is 157C, which means you likely lost a lot of it in the oven. Also, coconut oil will start to smoke and burn at about 170C, so that was the source of all the smoke. It won't hurt you, but it will taste like crap and likely not get you high at all. I suspect boiling the jar for an hour and a half (100C) was enough to decarb it all."

When you dial it in it's THE BEST, imo!  I know you've been burned on material the last few attempts (by the way, can any of that be salvaged for reuse?  Seems possible), but try using more material.  2g is kind of small for edibles.  Otherwise, skip all this processing, decarb your bud in the oven and eat it on a cracker (""Firecracker"") with peanut butter.  Per #3, are you 100% sure you're achieving the correct and consistent decarbing temperature?  Why not decarb in the oven first, as its own step?  Definitely use some lecithin too, for improved THC/body absorption.  And eat a mango 1 hour prior to consuming your edibles.  They naturally contain mycerene which has been shown to boost and lengthen the ""high"" effects.  Freezing!  Add two freezing steps to your process: 1, after grinding your bud, before adding the oil, and 2, after the initial couple hours of simmering.  Freeze everything then do another round of simmering.  I keep reading on these subs that the freezing step improves overall effectiveness.  GL!"

treedibles,3c3gdz,angelcake,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:46:30 2015 UTC,"The mason jar method is a good one, it's the one I use but to decarb your weed you would be better off to put it in a mason jar and put it in the oven for 45 minutes at approximately ~210 F. The hottest boiling water is going to get is 212F and it's unlikely that interior of the jar is going to reach a good temperature for decarbing.  It is perfectly safe to put a proper mason jar with a two-piece lid in the oven. I don't know if I would put it in at 300F but it's perfectly safe to do it at 210F  After I decarb I let the jar cool before I open it. At that point I add my coconut oil or clarified butter. The ratio I use is 1 cup of oil/butter to 1 ounce of weed. You can certainly do the math for your 2 g.  Once the oil and the decarbed bud are mixed together I put the jar in a pot of simmering water for 12 hours.  I remove it, allow it to cool, freeze it and then the next day I repeat the process, only this time I add the soy lecithin.  Once the second 12 hours is finished i strain the plant matter out of the oil [or don't strain depending when I making] and I get baking.  There are so many methods, mine is a combination of a couple different methods that have worked well for me. Whatever I'm doing I know I'm doing something right because my edibles are really potent."

The butter should not lose appreciable potency if you keep it frozen for a year.   Is it still okay for me to submerge the jar in water to make the butter defrost?   I wouldn't keep it frozen and repeatedly defrost it. Frozen stuff keeps best if it's only defrosted once and then used. You can defrost it in water, in the fridge, or even leave it on the counter...it's just butter (with benefits :-)   If I make a slice, how long can it store in the fridge? (Assuming I can't re-freeze it since I'd have already defrosted the butter).   Just like any other butter...for a few weeks or even months, depending on whether it gets contaminated by bacteria. We usually have one container in the fridge for a few months before we finish it."
treedibles,3buq4f,angelcake,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:42:55 2015 UTC,It was defrosted a little bit but not completely before being frozen. Should I assume that it has lost potency or is there no real way of knowing before trying it?

treedibles,3buq4f,Tatmom,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:17:26 2015 UTC,"Freezing and defrosting won't affect the potency. It will affect the butter itself, in the same way repeatedly freezing and defrosting anything will affect it. I think it's because the water cells inside the material expand when frozen, causing damage at a cellular level. Basically, shit gets mushy.   You also run the risk of increasing certain bacteria that thrive on the rapid change between hot and cold, resulting in a health issue - but not a potency issue.   From what I recall, none of the concerns in your original post are anything to worry about. Don't get it too hot, don't constantly defrost and refreeze (try cutting off chunks of the frozen butter, or freeze in several batches) and just use it like butter."

If so I suppose it would take ~105minutes from that chart?  I am just nervous about decarboxylating high quality expensive weed. Seems that if it was in a bath the whole time there is less of a chance to waste weed or not decarb enough.

So if you were to do it in 170~ F then it would taker forever.  If your keeping ethanol at its boiling point for even a few hours I think you would have trouble just keeping the level of liquid high enough.( there will be so much evaporation of ethanol is it even worth it to do it that way)  So from those reasons I would say ""just because you can do it, doesn't mean that you should"""

treedibles,3bnbru,Cannabrew,7,Wed Jul 1 03:36:20 2015 UTC,I suggest using whole milk or using coconut oil and then adding it to soy or whatever milk you want. Decarboxylating is very important part to making edibles or tincture.

Concentrating it to some degree is sometimes a good thing depending on what you are using it for. Stay at 180° (stirring often), this is when the protines in the milk denature and the bacteria die off which is what you want to do to pastureize the milk so it lasts much longer. That's how I do my cream for frozen custard."

High was hot to the touch(couldn't hold onto the glass bottle after bottling) but never boiled so was under 212F. Would being over 180 be a problem? Because I could just use a double boiler in order to keep a steady temperature and still be below the vaporization point of cannibinoids(If I'm not mistaken)  In any case thank you for being helpful rather than condemn me for being an amateur having fun.

treedibles,3bnbru,Kawren,2,Thu Jul 2 04:36:10 2015 UTC,"No problem. It's fine that you went over as long as you didn't burn it which would be hard to do. That process is called scalding milk and is how all milk is pasteurized. The higher the temp above 180°F the more nutty it tastes, which is ok for certain applications. That's why I keep it around 180°F to not impart any flavor. You're correct about the cannabinoids,  You would have to get up to about 250° fit it to be a problem. Double boilers work well."

treedibles,3blzax,2muchmonehandass,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:11:47 2015 UTC,Depending on what time constraint you have you could leave the weed in the vegetable oil longer. Can lead to it being a bit more potent.
treedibles,3blzax,Mycheesecake,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:56:52 2015 UTC,"If you're baking brownies that will cause additional and possibly too hot decarb issues.  Also, why not coconut oil?  It has more saturated fat content which will improve the cannabinoid bonding process, i.e. more THC/CBD to you."
treedibles,3blzax,happyself,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:32:41 2015 UTC,Im just using what i have ready and available.
treedibles,3blzax,happyself,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:14:52 2015 UTC,You have a serious problem ahead when your brownies call for the oven to be heated for baking.  Most likely the instructions will require too hot of temps and that will render your cannabis a lot less effective.
treedibles,3blzax,happyself,3,Tue Jun 30 22:02:01 2015 UTC,"I was going to compensate by lowering the temperature while cooking the brownies. I read somewhere that around 240 they will take longer, but it wont damage the THC"
treedibles,3blzax,happyself,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:12:31 2015 UTC,"Perfect!  Ideally, you want a total oven time (after pre-heating) for your material to be between 250f/30min - 240f/1hour.  So that may require you to not decarb and just bake-decarb.  I don't recommend decarbing some and then baking some as separate activities."

treedibles,3blzax,happyself,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:28:18 2015 UTC,"So far so good, IMO.  Either of the two decarb choices will be fine.  I just wouldn't recommend both though."
treedibles,3blzax,Cannabrew,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:35:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree, amount of decarboxylation that can take place after you have dissolved the cannabinoids in the fat is far less, even at the temperature you would normally decarb at. That's why you decarb fully before cooking, making tincture..."
treedibles,3blzax,happyself,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:53:13 2015 UTC,What are you disagreeing with?  OP said he already decarbed and then started simmering in oil.  I agree with you it's better to decarb in the oven vs heated oil.
treedibles,3blzax,Cannabrew,2,Wed Jul 1 21:30:17 2015 UTC,"That he should ""bake-decarb"". Baking is not really an issue because the cannabinoids decarboxylate very little as long as you keep it below 245°. That's why you have to decarb before baking to convert enough of the THC-a to THC Baking won't do it on its own."
treedibles,3blzax,fefebee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:38:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, I think I get it.  By the time it's baking, the cannabinoids are already in the oil, and therefore, they'll decarb much slower?"

treedibles,3bklo6,kaleyedoscope,2,Tue Jun 30 00:04:53 2015 UTC,You can evaporate the alcohol by putting it in a double boiler.

treedibles,3bklo6,happyself,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:15:30 2015 UTC,Serious question.  Why do you do this?
treedibles,3bklo6,smashingkitten,2,Tue Jun 30 05:07:41 2015 UTC,Winterizing increases the concentration of your tincture     The alcohol with the dissolved cannabinoids can't freeze and plant fats and chlorophyll can. Freezing lets the fats and chlorophyll solidify and seperate out so you can then strain them. Keeping It frozen while you strain is very important.
treedibles,3bklo6,Cannabrew,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:10:58 2015 UTC,Makes sense to me!  Thanks for the explanation.  I'm going to do this when I strain.
treedibles,3bklo6,smashingkitten,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"Just want to add, be very careful of the steam when you do this. It burns a lot worse than a normal, water steam burn"
treedibles,3bklo6,Cannabrew,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:10:38 2015 UTC,You would think it would burn less because alcohol boils at 173° while water boils at 212°. Causing a fireball or setting the Everclear on fire by spilling it is what I'm most careful about.
treedibles,3bklo6,OldHippie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the reason a steam burn hurts so bad is because of the energy contained in the steam itself, especially when it's changing phases. As in, faster moving molecules do more damage. So, maybe that's why alcohol burns worse? I only have anecdotal evidence as a cook. Steam burn takes about 3 days to heal on me, the one alcohol vapor burn I had lasted over a week."
treedibles,3bklo6,OldHippie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:16:43 2015 UTC,Heat is energy in the form of vibrating molecules. The faster they vibrate the hotter the  temperature. When something reaches its boiling point the material turns to steam and starts losing energy unless it's in a sealed container. At STP (standard temperature pressure) alcohol boils at 173°F and it can't get any hotter than that. Water can't get any hotter than 212°F at STP.

No idea if there is an actual difference however. Cheers!"

treedibles,3biubu,ChrispyK,3,Mon Jun 29 19:48:05 2015 UTC,"A ""sound operation"" means that he thinks your plan is good, and I agree with him!    Decarbing is the act of lightly toasting your bud to convert the natural THC-a found in weed into the THC that you get from smoking it.  A good starting point for decarbing is roasting your ground-up bud at 200* F for 30 minutes, or until your weed is light brown and very fragrant."

But making an alcohol tincture then slowly double boiling off the alcohol I was left with the thicker oil, similar to a BHO but you can't smoke it since it was made with alcohol, but perfectly fine to ingest. It's thicker than coconut oil and I didn't want my gummies to fall apart or be goopy."

treedibles,3bg65j,prang_interpreter,2,Mon Jun 29 00:32:22 2015 UTC,i find for pain relief i like to use a heavier indica strain like a OG variant and also find it helps to use AVB as the cannabinoid source.  that way you end up with more CBN than you might with an edible made from un-vaped cannabis.

treedibles,3bfrf6,CrudeDuude,3,Sun Jun 28 20:52:17 2015 UTC,You can but you'd save a lot of money by buying Soy Lecithin granules and powdering them. Make sure the SL in the capsules is powdered before you add it to the oil.
treedibles,3bfrf6,p984321,2,Sun Jun 28 22:11:42 2015 UTC,Why do you recommend the SL be powdered?  Doesn't the liquid version work the same?
treedibles,3bfrf6,happyself,3,Mon Jun 29 01:51:33 2015 UTC,Soy Lecithin granules dissolve into the oil a lot easier if they are powdered. Otherwise you get big chunks in the oil.  Never seen liquid SL caps. Just work out the dose per cap and multiply how many you need to pop.
treedibles,3bfrf6,p984321,2,Mon Jun 29 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"I ask because I am trying liquid sunflower lecithin this time, instead of powder soy lecithin.  The SL was giving me a slight allergic reaction, I think; headaches and sinus inflammation."
treedibles,3bfrf6,happyself,2,Mon Jun 29 10:51:47 2015 UTC,Soy Lecithin doesn't agree with some people. That is why it is advised to do an allergy test before adding it to a batch. People usually report gastrointestinal upset.

treedibles,3bfrf6,Skittle_Poop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:31:54 2015 UTC,Lots of people cook with water as well. The water can actually wash some of the nasties away during the cooking process. Additionally most double boiler recipes use water to help the oil from burning.  After cooking freeze the entire mixture then simply crack the ice layer away from your oil.

treedibles,3bcawh,_fourtwenty_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:50:31 2015 UTC,I used EdibleOnly's recipe on the sidebar. 7g nugs (roughly 5:1 CBD:THC) + 6 tbs coconut oil + 4.5 tsp sunflower lecithin.  Whole thing went pretty smooth even manually filling the caps. As for the effect it seems pretty good but with CBD its a bit harder to tell. Seems pretty potent though as i dropped the last bit (not enough for another pill) and numbed up my mouth pretty well. I'll know more as I use them since its my first time with CBD as a concentrate also.

I just cooked it in a small container in a crock pot just like the recipe I linked, idk if there is a better way to isolate the CBD. From what I've read it may be better to keep THC and other goodies in for the CBD to be more effective, so I didn't do anything special. With around 5:1 ratio of this strain I don't get high from the THC anyway. Felt pretty good from trying it yesterday but I still have to test dosage more."

If by 'good stuff' you mean the THC, then you don't have to worry about losing it through washing.  Seeing as all the good stuff in your decarbed weed that you want in your butter all binds to the fat that was already in the butter, washing it will only remove plant matter.  What I do(obviously you probably have your own method) is to boil the butter with some water, and then just keep it over heat just below a boil for about 20 minutes or so.  then place it in your container and let cool before you separate the butter from the water.  Helps a LOT to keep the weed taste your of your treets."

I make single doses on a scientific hot plate extractions into coconut oil and lecithin.  I have found it to be the most effective way to decarb for a few reasons.  The main reason is that you don't know the starting state of the thc in the plant you have.  Thc will naturally decarb over time at room temp, so you may have partially decarbed material to begin with.  This is an issue because you can only decarb to 70% before the degradation to cbn occurs faster than the conversion of thc-a to thc.  Also as far as bubbles, decarb is short for decarboxylation.  Which is the release of the carboxyl group in the form of carbon dioxide air bubbles, like soda.  Edit: I wanted to tell you also that kief will decarb more quickly than plant material."

treedibles,3b5hya,MNWNTRZ,2,Fri Jun 26 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"The alcohol is in there anyway so any bud you put in will be extracted no matter when you put it in, so the 1/4 of the total bud we put in in the beginning is still extracted. The bourbon is because it it's a common liquor that is used to fortify beer and tastes really good.  It doesn't mask the flavor just adds a hint of smoky bourbon flavor to your beer. I will usually often do a 50/50 bourbon Everclear mix."

treedibles,3b5hya,dewbles,2,Fri Jun 26 16:09:19 2015 UTC,"Any weed you add will not be 100% extracted, if you added flowers during boil or as a dry hop after fermentation, unless you're brewing 15%alc or higher.  There's not enough alcohol to dissolve it very well out of flowers. Even when you dry hop with hops for 2-4 weeks they're still covered in resin  Also there's no reason to boil the flowers,  there's no isomerizatuon of alpha acids, there's insufficient decarboxylation occuring, it's just a waste  Using some flowers in the dry hop for flavor works,  but to get enough thc into the beer effeciently you have to do other things  My method is to decarb good bho make a potent everclear solution with it and add measured amount to bottles before bottling. Use good oil and it tastes good.  Use bad oil and it tastes bad. You have to use enough everclear to prevent the oil from crashing out of the solution when the beer hits it too, or add something to help emulsify it and slowly overtime the thc will work into the alcohol but it stays cloudy for months usually cause of all the extra suspended oils in the beer.   100$/case 30mg thc per bottle usually"
treedibles,3b5a48,cafebandito,2,Fri Jun 26 02:14:01 2015 UTC,"First question. I suggest grinding your herb and sifting it before and after oven decarbing. People have different opinions about oven decarb vs slow cooking for decarb, but I think the consistency of the powder is important, and sifting will get the stem fibers out.   Second question. ""Enough to do the trick"" is a subjective question.  What is enough for me might make you want to call an ambulance.  So I recommend low doses that you can keep track of.  I made my latest oil at a 1 ounce to 1 cup ratio, and it is very strong and effective. You may not need it that strong, and at your ratio of one ounce per 2 cup I have made oil that was effective.  Question 3. I find that my oil is most effective when I don't include it in solid foods like baked goods.  Baked goods can burn in the oven, get stale, attract ants, and when eaten take time to break down in the stomach acids slowing and reducing amount of absorption.  I use capsules to regulate a dosage, and I also enjoy it in hot beverages.  But no, using half cannaoil and half regular oil if you find your oil to be too strong will not negate the effects. It just lowers the dosages by half.  For someone who has only been high a few times in your life, I encourage you to start off slow and have fun."

treedibles,3b3p7z,kobekramer1,2,Thu Jun 25 18:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's too hot.  Cook them at 245° then turn it up to 260 for the last couple minutes to brown the tops.  Cook them a bit longer than normal due to the lower temp. When cooking with cannabis don't go above 245° because that is when the cannabinoids start to vaporize.  The last couple minutes won't hurt though."

treedibles,3b3p7z,halfdisciplined,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you'll still get effect. The liquid in the brownies protects the cannabinoids from getting too hot to some degree. Did you make them from scratch? What kind of oil did you use?"

treedibles,3b3p7z,halfdisciplined,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"Did you decarboxylate? To decarboxylate grind weed, put in oven at 225 for 25 min. It converts the THC-A (non- psychoactive) into THC (psychoactive). I suggest using coconut oil next time. It has a higher lipid content so it can absorb more cannabinoids. My favorite way of making cannabutter/oil is the water extraction method.  It is the safest (in terms of not overheating) and most potent method imo."

treedibles,3b3p7z,halfdisciplined,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:02:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks. You can do the water extraction method in a crockpot if you need to do a bunch of butter and keep track of the temp, around 200°-220° is good.  I wouldn't do butter by itself in a crockpot because they get hot spots. .3-.5g of good bud per brownie is what I use depending on how potent I want to make them."
treedibles,3b251m,sparklemotiondoubt,2,Thu Jun 25 10:34:47 2015 UTC,So you like pesto? Replace the olive oil with canna oil. It's a raw sauce so there's no worry about cooking the the out. Serve it with pasta or mix with goat cheese and serve with crackers. I don't think there's a real benefit to baking it since you run the risk of the THC evaporating if you bake it at a temperature that's too high.
treedibles,3b251m,smoklahoman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:32:17 2015 UTC,Thanks! Do you think it would work with cannabutter? I understand pesto normally requires oil. I don't have canna oil (and can' t make it without the wholw apartment block smelling). I might experiment with using olive oil and adding cannabutter to the recipe. It would be very oily but I don't see how it could taste too horrible
treedibles,3b251m,smoklahoman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:49:52 2015 UTC,I certainly do! I say just make the pesto regular with the butter instead of the oil. I mean butter is solid at room temperature but once its all mixed in and you put it on warm pasta it'll melt up nicely
treedibles,3b251m,PushcartPops,2,Thu Jun 25 23:53:58 2015 UTC,I like to make green eggs and ham.  Put a tablespoon of cannaoil in the pan and make scrambled eggs. Gets the morning off to a good start.

treedibles,3axwds,AcaciaBlue,2,Thu Jun 25 10:55:53 2015 UTC,"Cooking with hash is a murky subject with little knowledge, most guides assume you have buds or shake or AVB.  Your decarbing level seems fine but what fat are you blending with?  If you don't let the THC absorb into some fat I doubt your stomach will process much of anything.  I don't think mint has any fat in it.."
treedibles,3axwds,BrippingTalls,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"I think most issues arise because it's too concentrated with too litte surface area, which is why I mixed it into mint leaves, so it will be a somewhat powdery consistency. I usually eat it with peanut butter, whipped cream or cream cheese"
treedibles,3axwds,p984321,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:18:21 2015 UTC,"Update: I just did my regular process on 100C for an hour and then 110 for another half an hour, and I just ate half of it, maybe 0.4g of it, straight with cream cheese and crackers. After smoking it both before and after the decarb, it got me higher but seems weaker and smoother than before the oven-bake. That might also be what I've eaten kicking in already as I haven't eaten anything else today"
treedibles,3axwds,BrippingTalls,-1,Wed Jun 24 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"You need to have some sort of fat for the THC to bind to when it is activated by the heat. Without it, you're just getting your oven stoned from the vapors that are being released as you heat your hash.  Edit: Downvotes for stating the truth and trying to be helpful? It's your weed to waste guys, enjoy it however you want."
treedibles,3axwds,AcaciaBlue,2,Wed Jun 24 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"My goal is simply activating the THC correctly without vaporizing it or converting too much to CBD. There's fat in cream cheese, whipped cream and peanut butter, no? Also, doesn't THC vaporize at 157C? EDIT: The mixture is very strong after it's out of the oven if it was on 100-130C when smoked"
treedibles,3axwds,BrippingTalls,2,Wed Jun 24 13:49:08 2015 UTC,The boiling point of THC is 157 degrees. Keep your cooking well under that temperature.
treedibles,3axwds,AcaciaBlue,2,Wed Jun 24 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"When it's activated, it wants to bind with fat asap. Sure, you can preactivate it, but exposing it to fat from the beginning is more effective.  There isn't any reason to prevent exposure to fat earlier in the cooking process. There is no reason to overcomplicate things."
treedibles,3axwds,Hello-Universe,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:39:28 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it can bind later.  I boil mine in water for about an hour before adding a liter of milk.  I'm a little high right now from like two mouthfuls.

It also depends heavily how long you keep the vape session going. If its a lighter brown then it'll be more potent if its really dark then you vaped more of the good stuff out in your session.

You may be over-decarboxylating. I do it 220° for 25min. Remember 246° is when cannabinoids start to vaporize. I do a 3hr water extraction. Water, finely ground decarboxylated bud, and fat in a closed mason jar. Put the jar in a pot of simmering water for 3hrs. Then strain the contents through cheesecloth and put it in the freezer for an hour. Remove the solidified separated cannabutter from the top."

treedibles,3axqn9,HeadGangsta,3,Wed Jun 24 10:09:35 2015 UTC,3.5 grams is 3500mg x .15 (average THC percentage) gives you about 525mg of THC in 3.5 grams. So if you cut them into 8 brownies that would be about 65.5mg per brownie. If it is your first time with edibles I would start with 1/3 of a brownie and wait a couple hours. Colorado recommends 10mg as a safe starting dose but I usually do about 20mg. Hope that helps!

treedibles,3akukq,pierceroem,5,Sun Jun 21 04:44:21 2015 UTC,Decarb your bud in a mason jar in a preheated oven at 240F for an hour. Let the jar cool some and then put it in the freezer to cool a little more. This will drastically reduce smell from opening the jar.   Take your decarbed bud and make your firecrackers. Wrap each firecracker in tin foil individually and place into a few mason jars. Only put a few in each so that they're not pressed together. Put the jars in a preheated oven at 240 for an hour.  Take jars out of oven and let them cool some. Place jars in freezer until firecrackers are cold (About 30 min). You have now made firecrackers with absolutely minimal smell.  I have plenty of advice for getting the maximum potency out of the firecrackers too if you'd like!

Mix that with a half cup of your peanut butter.  2) Use ORGANIC peanut butter as it has a much higher fat content.  3) Before decarbing, first POWDER and then FREEZE your bud.  4) Decarb for an HOUR at 240F in a PREHEATED oven.   5) Always make sure you cool your decarb container before opening to help settle back into the bud the few terpenes that vaporised during the process."
treedibles,3akukq,katza601,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:57:42 2015 UTC,What does the initial freeze stage add? I have never seen that stage before in a Tek.  I understand the need for a double freeze stage after cooking but I am trying to work out the benefit of freezing before cooking.  Also people should test whether Soy Lecithin will cause them gastrointestinal discomfort. SL doesn't agree with everyone.
treedibles,3akukq,p984321,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"I've actually never found definitive proof of this, but it is talked about that freezing the bud beforehand helps the THC pierce the cell walls of the plant or something like that. I figure it's an easy step to add to the beginning of the process and it certainly won't hurt it, so I do it just in case. I almost felt weird posting that step but I figured it wouldn't do any harm anyway.  And yes, absolutely see if the SL agrees with you first, but I doubt 1TBS in 1/2 cup of PB would cause gastric distress. It's much more likely that ingesting  the MJ would cause that instead."
treedibles,3akukq,katza601,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:43:01 2015 UTC,When I was reading about the freeze stage it mentions the same  processs but advises freezing after the cooking stage then repeating.

Do you make really good brownies from scratch?  Baking a bunch of brownies at once takes a risk of having stale product and potential waste.  I suggest making your oil and do your math for what your dosage would be per ounce, and then package it by a certain measurement. 10:1 is my oil to herb ratio that I found works very well.ś.6 Those packages can be frozen and stored indefinitely and used at your leisure for a variety of recipes.   So is this a pound of bud, or a pound of trim?  When you say ""front"", how much are you on the hook for?

treedibles,3aj35d,shake_junt561,2,Sat Jun 20 19:55:09 2015 UTC,Use ratios. If you use x amount of bud per y amount of coconut oil then you get x+y=z where z is the cannaoil. Say x is 1oz and y is a pound of coconut oil and you have a pound of bud you would need 16 pounds of oil and a huge double boiler.
treedibles,3aj15q,happyself,3,Sat Jun 20 17:47:33 2015 UTC,"I would recommend my usual procedure, which happens to work extra good in your current situation.  1) Decarb yo bud  2) Boil your bud in water to remove any burnt taste (and to kill any leftover mold).  Maybe repeat this step 2-3 times for 10 minutes apiece in clean water for each batch to be extra sure.  Don't reuse water between batches, especially if you're looking to get rid of mold.  3) Make cannabutter!  You can simply throw the butter into the water for your last batch, let it cool to room temperature, and then in a pitcher overnight in your refrigerator.  Or, you could make cannabutter using any procedure you like.  Or tincture!  The world is your oyster."

That's exactly my concern; the Aspergillus species in my buds, and it making mycotoxins that survive -- even after cooking or using alcohol."

When oven reaches Temp, put in oven for 25 mins. Don't open door during process or you can cause temp drops/spikes.   I use coconut oil. About 1 tsp per dose, so 20 tsp for 5 g. Boil some water in a pot, then throw in the coconut oil (the solid white stuff, not pre liquified). Now throw in the bud, reduce heat to a slow boil/simmer and let boil for 2-3 hours (stir fairly frequently).  Remove from heat, and pour through metal strainer, into pyrex container or metal salad bowl. Put in fridge overnight. Cana coconut oil and water should be separated and oil should be solid. Poke through a small hole and pour water from bottom.  Now store in a sealed container or Mason jar.  You can add 1 tsp to a coffee, which is really nice (mixing in magic bullet makes it frothy like a latte) or add the whole batch into a cookie or brownie recipe. If you do, be sure to keep Temp at 225-250f, and don't open the door.  Cheers!  Edit: another good thing with this is if the 0.2 is too much, just try half a tsp the next time.

treedibles,39x6li,Malakai5720,3,Mon Jun 15 16:20:50 2015 UTC,"Firecracker is basically 2 crackers, nuttela/Peanut butter/ or any other fatty substitute, Vaped weed, or decarbed weed and foil  Take each cracker, slap your PB or your fatty sub on each cracker. Then sprinkle your ABV or decarbed weed on each cracker. If you ask me how much, I cant really tell you, I used to do 1-2 teaspoons per cracker side, just make sure they stick.  Close the cracker, like a sandwich, and then wrap the foil around it, place it in the oven for 25 mins at around 275 F."
treedibles,39x6li,2ndaxct,2,Mon Jun 15 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"What would be the point of cooking it? Just wondering, if it's for the heat to make it toasty and hot or to make the weed stronger?"
treedibles,39x6li,donkey_rhubarb85,3,Mon Jun 15 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"In short, exposing weed to cooking temperatures converts THCA (a non-psychoactive chemical) into THC (the chemical that actually makes you high). That's why people vaporize or smoke weed, because it requires high temperatures to produce THC."
treedibles,39x6li,HorseMuzzle,3,Mon Jun 15 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if it's abv, isn't it already decarbed? Not needing anymore heat since the thc is already active? That's why i was wondering about throwing it in the oven."
treedibles,39x6li,donkey_rhubarb85,4,Mon Jun 15 19:38:01 2015 UTC,I'm with you on this one.. The baking is to decarb.. Baking avb would be redundant..
treedibles,39x6li,bigdicksam,3,Mon Jun 15 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, abv doesn't need to be decarbed. But he did say AVB OR weed.   Idk if you guys do this but when I make edibles I generally create an amalgam of kief, avb, shake, and maybe a little herb, so I always have to cook it regardless."
treedibles,39x6li,HorseMuzzle,2,Mon Jun 15 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"When I meant vaped or decarbed weed. I meant dont throw in non-baked weed in the firecracker as there is more potential to the weed.  When you stick ABV in the oven with your fatty substance, thats when the THC binds with the sub and then your body can ingest THC more efficiently. If you just eat AVB you might get high, but you need a big amount. Versus having a medium that facilitates it."
treedibles,39x6li,2ndaxct,0,Mon Jun 15 22:15:54 2015 UTC,This isnt true I think.  Ive heard the opposite.  Eating just AVB should get you higher than it binded to fats.
treedibles,39x6li,taketheshro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:04:45 2015 UTC,"AVB is like decarbed weed.   So is it better to skip making cannabutter or canna-coconut oil, as they take a lot of time to make and just eat the decarbed weed?"
treedibles,39x6li,2ndaxct,2,Tue Jun 16 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"I just posted a question about that because I dont know either.  From what ive read, just eating decarbed weed would be the strongest.    Cannabutter and Canna-coconut oil is basically just extracting the THC and all that jazz from the weed.  However, this means that it gets rid of the weed material so you wont really taste it.  I think it will be strongest just leaving it decarbed and eating that but people say it tastes like shit.  It seems the best temperature to keep it is 240 degress Fahrenheit for 60 minutes.  Then, I think you can water cure it?  Maybe?  Im still researching what that is"
treedibles,39x6li,taketheshro,2,Tue Jun 16 22:18:34 2015 UTC,It's to turn to turn the THCA to THC. Body can only use THC.
treedibles,39x6li,Groosed,2,Mon Jun 15 19:08:34 2015 UTC,"so the THC can bind with your fatty substance.  Its the same idea as cannabutter, why melt butter, then add your plant and let it sit for 45+ mins?   Thats in simple terms, I am no chemist so I cannot get down to specifics but thats as far as my understanding goes"

You would want a small pyrex dish, an oven thermometer, coconut oil, and granulated soy lecithin.  If you don't have that stuff I would just make firecrackers, firecracker recipes everywhere."
treedibles,39vnjn,Senor_Destructo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:11:42 2015 UTC,Thinking about making some oil with about 5g. I can go buy oil and lecithin tonight. Do you have to make the oil into something for it to affect you well? Could me and a friend just pour some in a shot glass and each down it?
treedibles,39vnjn,benDAmin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yes you could just drink it.  Heat the oil before you put the material in to 280 degrees.  Mix the material and the soy lecithin before you put it in, use about 2 teaspoons of lecithin to make it more bioavailable.  Bake it for 30 min.  Let it cool.  I eat the plant material with it because oil gets trapped in there."

That could be one of the issues right there.  Perhaps it was already too vaped and didn't have enough THC left?  That might explain the darker color and smell of your product."
treedibles,39u8iz,happyself,2,Sun Jun 14 22:29:57 2015 UTC,"I used 2/3 of a cup coconut oil, and around 1/2 cup of liquid soy lecithin. I tried to stick as close to the guide as I could, but my bf decided that there wasn't enough of the lecithin in it, and added a large glop on top of what I already had in the crockpot, so that might have had an effect on it.  The ABV did also have a bit of that weird ass smell that the oil had too, and at least 3/4 of it was apparently sitting in a plastic baggie at the bottom of my buddy's stash bag for about 2 months. The stuff was also a medium brown color, not a hint of green on it, so maybe the THC did get cooked out, I'm not sure."
treedibles,39u8iz,p984321,3,Sun Jun 14 23:47:39 2015 UTC,Water cure your ABV before ingestion next time. It removes a lot of the body load for a much more enjoyable experience.
treedibles,39u8iz,happyself,2,Sun Jun 14 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"Tell your BF to keep his damn hands out of the mix!  LOL  That's more SL than I'd use, especially with concerns about it causing gastrointestinal and allergic reaction symptoms (to some, not all) at higher amounts.  Since you already have the AVB, is it possible to eat it raw and skip all the processing?  You could water cure it to remove the foul taste/smell first.  Otherwise, I'm sure you'll get it after a few more trials.  Good luck!"
treedibles,39u8iz,cheftron,2,Mon Jun 15 11:26:23 2015 UTC,Bro your way off. Abv is good  but you need to double it. Brownie recipes take 1/3 cup oil and would lecithin granules.  I do 7g buds 1/3c oil 1Tbls lecithin and get 24 doses
treedibles,39u8iz,p984321,2,Sat Jun 20 13:01:02 2015 UTC,I cook with ABV weekly and get fantastic results. There are a lot of CBD's and even THC left in ABV.

treedibles,39syzo,happyself,6,Sun Jun 14 13:50:21 2015 UTC,Extract into ethanol (everclear 190proof alcohol) at 180f for 15minutes. Strain. Put ethanol in double boiler and evaporate until bubbles stop forming vigorously. Add a few drops distilled water and allow to boil off once more. Use honey or coconut oil to take the resin into suspension. Eat. Be merry.  I like to call this poor man's RSO (Rick Simpson oil).

treedibles,39syzo,MedicatedDeveloper,2,Sun Jun 14 15:42:51 2015 UTC,It's really quite great. Since I've moved from a medical state to somewhere getting even BHO is prohibitively expensive ($30+/g) I have had to improvise.   Ethanol is great for extraction as I feel you get a feeling closer to that of smoking bud versus how BHO/CO2 extract based edibles do. Other concentrates tend to make me much too paranoid and cause muscle spasms.

This also makes like 2 dozen of them so you can half or even quarter the recipe.  Also, even in prohibition places you can get good deals. Im in FL and paying 100 for a half oz but Ive been making contacts for a couple years now. A good way around the price barrier is using cheap weed to cook with. It wont have the same flavor but washing the butter helps. You can get like double the weight for the same price, so youll get more THC per dollar even though its less potent."

treedibles,39iu8n,Kuforman,2,Fri Jun 12 00:46:00 2015 UTC,"Good info.  One point to clarify is *how* they are decarbing in oil.  It takes a specific process and time/temp requirements to do so, not just simply simmering your bud in oil quickly, as the current perception seems to be."
treedibles,39iu8n,happyself,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:40:28 2015 UTC,Problem is most cheap labs run gc/ms which will decarb any cannabinoid by the way it works you need to verify with hplc to test thca vs thc that one test should have had something like thca 0.5% or something but didn't include any acidic forms leaving me to think it was a gc/ms test the other person (97% claim) has also not convinced me that their test was proper by only saying 97%
treedibles,39iu8n,dewbles,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's best to decarb while the material is in the oil.  You never know how much the bud has decarbed naturally.  You can see the decarb happen in an oil bath by watching the bubbles rise to the surface.  When the bubble production slows or stops (depending on the temp you use), remove from heat and it's done.  That's only part of the battle though, absorbtion is the trickier part."
treedibles,39iwc9,Immapuke,2,Fri Jun 12 01:03:45 2015 UTC,Six drops would be about 0.4 oz... of Everclear...  That's probably not going to be too much alcohol.

Pipe resin doesn't generally taste that good, so I would make something that might help disguise the taste (though you can't hide it completely)...  maybe extra rich chocolate brownies?  Best bet is to decide how much resin you're going to use, dissolve that into warm oil (the amount from your recipe) and then make your recipe as normal using this oil you dissolved into."
treedibles,39gnqd,RoadSurfer,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"That sounds interesting. Much better than melting it and smearing it over a biscuit or piece of toast.  How would I go about getting it into a usable state,  just melt it?"

treedibles,39gnqd,pkhorns27,2,Fri Jun 12 13:01:03 2015 UTC,What I would probably do would be mix the same amount of Coconut oil (eg 7grams of resin to 7 grams of coconut oil) with it. Do a double boiler technique stirring the mix for 3 to 4 hours. Let oil cool just a little bit. Get a dropper you don't want to keep (or clean it after) and drop it into capsules and make coconut resin caps. Just an idea would love to hear what someone would change/add to that procedure.  Edit: Just wanted to add I did this with 3 grams of reclaim from my rig one time for some caps to go to opening day and it worked pretty well. Makes it so you don't taste it initially but my friends complained of reclaim-y burps after taking a couple of them. Good luck and report back with how potent it is

treedibles,39cji6,Phoebeeee,2,Wed Jun 10 21:10:48 2015 UTC,"It would help if you were more specific about what you wanted to improve. Taste? Potency?  IMO, Using ABV is more of a crapshoot when making edibles since vape temp and how much you've hit it (light brown vs dark brown or some combustion) changes the amount of THC available to end up in your fat.   edit: Also 24hrs of already decarbed bud is prob overkill..."

Just get your oil nice and hot in the dipper, add your finely ground bud, and stir it as often as you can. You can do short runs in a few hours of you decarb, but I prefer to not decarb my weed and instead leave it in the Little Dipper for 24-48 hours, this ensures that all the THC has activated.

As someone else said, buy a decent brownie mix box.  Their only $1 more.  I like Ghirardelli Brownie mix.  Next time I would do the following steps:   decarb in oven for 45 minutes or so at 220. ( make like a little foil tent and break the buds up by hand)   2.Grind the decarbed bud as fine as possible. I use an electric coffee grinder for this. Use coconut oil because of the higher fat content for the THC to bind to. My brownie box mix calls for 1/3 cup so I use that much for 1/4 oz. Put the oil and bud (and some soy leichten, i find it helps out alot) in a little pyrex dish or little mason jar and put it in the crock pot on low for about 3 hours. Stir it every now and then.  3.After that 3 hrs, let it cool a little bit so not to crack the dish and then put it in the freezer for atleast 2.5 hours. Longer wont hurt it.  4.Let the frozen dish come up to room temp a little so not to crack it and put it back in the crock pot for another 3 hrs. Stir occasionally.   Strain the bud out through some cheese cloth and you are left with the goodness you were seeking.   Make what ever you want with the infused coconut oil. I do brownies because they dont seem to go stale as fast as cookies, but do what ever you want. And dont bake whatever youre making in the oven over 300 even if the directions say to, just extend the time a little longer.  I dont really make butter, because it is easier to burn, and the coconut oil will beable to absorb/bind with more thc beacuse of the saturated fats in it.  Hope this helps you next time. I know its hard because every different website has different answers to making butter/oils and everyone thinks their way is the best. Im not saying my way is the best but it is easy to do and cant really mess it up in the crock pot as compared to burning it accidently on the stove."

The lower ratio of cannaboids in the new flower to the already infused oil should allow for more cannaboids being transferred to the oil.  That's the theory, from pratice I can say I do see a benefit to second washes.  In your case, I wouldn't bother with adding more oil, just wash the ABV with the already infused oil.  This should improve the potency significantly depending on the quality of your ABV.  You can even wash the ABV a second time with new oil if you wish.  Soy Lecithin does improve potency by increasing bio-availability, however many don't use it as some studies link it to heart issues.  Do your research and make an informed decision."

So after following your instructions, there was no oil separation, I guess I'm really good at squeezing the rest of the oil out of the plant matter through the cheese cloth when I made the cannaoil. I dumped the water, leaving very dark brown plant matter (I suppose this step water cured the material...), dried it out, and ground it further in my magic bullet.  I then melted dark chocolate / regular coconut oil, added the plant matter, and chilled the chocolate in molds to make about 15 treats. The plant matter complimented the dark chocolate (85%) flavor very well. No gritty texture from the plant either.  As for strength of this left over plant matter- I would say if these were made with my cannaoil, 1/2 treat would get me buzzing. Using this left over plant matter, I'd say 2 treats would be needed. So Definitely glad I didn't toss the left over material. There's definitely still active cannabinoids in the material even after making oil.   TLDR: when you make cannaoil, don't toss the left over plant material. There's still cannabinoids in there to make additional treats!"

treedibles,3854lh,moneyxmitch,5,Mon Jun 1 22:41:48 2015 UTC,Before you can answer your question you need to decide how much wax & Everclear you want in each shot..  mgs_wax = the number of mgs wax you want in a shot.  oz_Everclear = the number of fluid ounces in a shot.   Then the equation for total volume of Everclear is:  (2000 / mgs_wax) X oz_Everclear = Total_volume_everclear   The first division (2000 / mgs_wax) tells you how many doses you'll get from 2000 mgs of starting wax.  The second multiplication will tell you how many fluid oz. of Everclear you need total.
treedibles,3854lh,RoadSurfer,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:39:56 2015 UTC,"Do you think if I decarbed the 2 grams BHO and infused in 2 oz of Everclear, the droppers will be potent?  I think the dropper size I have is 1 ml."
treedibles,3854lh,RoadSurfer,2,Wed Jun 3 09:49:04 2015 UTC,"So 2 oz is 59.1471 ml  2000 mg / 59.1 ml = 33.8 mg/ml   That's 33.8 mg per dropper  I don't know what your tolerance is, so I can't speak for you.    In my experience that's about right.  I typically enjoy 100 mg, but can go up to 200 mg on special occasions.    So that seems like a reasonable concentration - that is for me - it would allow me to modulate my dose effectively - 3 droppers for normal, and more if circumstances allow.  Make sure you decarb - that will REALLY affect the potency of your outcome."

treedibles,37pefg,angelcake,2,Fri May 29 13:58:57 2015 UTC,"Don't put soy lecithin in if you're boiling with water. Soy Lecithin acts as an emulsifier, having a fat-loving side and a water loving side. The Soy Lecithin will bind the water you used to boil with the fat in the coconut oil. So yes, there's probably still some water in there, but there's nothing you can really do about it. Just use it as is and leave out the water next time. Do you have an oven? That leaves out the guessing as far as temperature goes."

treedibles,37pefg,birdsRdinosaurs,1 point,Fri May 29 13:14:40 2015 UTC,Some people think that doing this with wet product shatters the cell walls and makes the THC more available for extraction.
treedibles,37pefg,Prinsessa,1 point,Fri May 29 15:13:18 2015 UTC,"The sticky in the sidebar directly contradicts you:   ""To understand why freezing is important, we need to visualize the plant cells within the cannabis.

Freezing them forces that liquid to take on a crystalline structure, piercing the plant cell walls and releasing the goodies.

treedibles,37pefg,birdsRdinosaurs,2,Fri May 29 13:37:18 2015 UTC,Decarbing changes the THC from it's original form to something that we can use in our bodies.  You can make edibles without doing it but they will be nowhere near as potent.
treedibles,37pefg,Prinsessa,1 point,Fri May 29 13:58:30 2015 UTC,Won't heating the oil and herb together to that temperature still decarb the bud directly into the fat? Or am I missing something important?
treedibles,37pefg,angelcake,6,Fri May 29 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"No. From the sticky in the sidebar:  It is a misconception that decarboxylation is unnecessary due to the heat provided once the cannabis is actually in the oil. Unfortunately, the carboxyl-groups fall off at a much slower rate once the plant matter is heating in the oil, slowing the rate of decarboxylation dramatically. This is why we decarboxylate beforehand, ensuring that most of our THCa will be converted by the end of the process."

treedibles,37pefg,PushcartPops,1 point,Fri May 29 15:26:31 2015 UTC,You would think so but apparently it doesn't or if it does you have to leave it in a lot longer. I would rather err on the side of caution and good results
treedibles,37l3h3,happyself,5,Thu May 28 12:30:25 2015 UTC,"The longer you leave it sit, the more the alcohol will extract out (up to a point) - regardless of what these recipes state.  In the first method, she used extra-fine ground buds and shakes in alcohol for a few minutes to maximize the breakdown into the alcohol.  With this method, you would want to use buds, probably high quality buds, and the quality of your tincture would vary a lot depending on quality of your solvent (alcohol) and your solute (buds, whatever). Even though this says only shake 3 minutes, longer will result in more absorption and a stronger tincture.  The second method encourages using Already Vaped Buds (AVB) and trimmings as well as buds if needed.  The longer time for this is due to extract more out of the AVB and trimmings, because they are less concentrated than buds.  Also, they don't mention of finely grinding these products, so more time is needed to absorb the THC from the AVB/trimmings due to a lower surface area.    I haven't done the 3 minute recipe to compare, but the slow and safe method works fine and is quite easy. For best results, combine both methods. Finely grind, shake a few minutes a day and store in a cool dark place (light breaks down THC) for as long as you want ."

Even though this says only shake 3 minutes, longer will result in more absorption and a stronger tincture.   How much more?  Noticeably so?  The 3-minute version is already described as potent so if I do that but wait 3 more weeks it will be insane potent?"

The question a chemist needs to answer how long it takes for each percentage to be extracted. Sorry, I know that doesn't answer your question, I just wanted to clear up any notion you might have that steep time vs potency was an infinitely linear relationship."
treedibles,37l3h3,scrambler2,2,Thu May 28 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"Good clarification.  I agree, this question needs --not just an answer-- a graph!  Decarboxylation has a popular graph on these subs, Tincture needs one also!"

Correct, the Green Dragon did not mention using AVB. I should have said the Old Hippie's Slow and Safe mode instead of ""the second method""   The tincture will increase in strength until the alcohol can't absorb more cannabinoids so it just depends on the strength of your alcohol solvent and your plant material.  Eventually it stops getting stronger."

treedibles,37m3n8,chasdabigone,1 point,Fri May 29 22:17:13 2015 UTC,"the reason for the induction burner is: you can set the temperature exactly. So, you can decarb with it, or decarb with the herb in the oil because you can set it at exactly 230 degrees or whatever you want. You can experiment with different temperatures/times and get different results. It is very versatile"
treedibles,37m3n8,chasdabigone,1 point,Fri May 29 22:21:01 2015 UTC,something else you can do to have constant stirring is use boiling water to constantly shake the container.

Ground an eight (3g) of weed to fine powder and put inside canning jar 2. Pre-heat oven to 240 or 250F 3. Put jar (closed) inside the pre-heated oven for 30-35 minutes 4. Let it cool for 15-20 minutes then open the jar (may have a minor smell in the immediate area that dissipates quickly). Open outside to reduce smell. 5. Put 1/2 stick butter and 1/8 cup of water inside jar and close the jar again 6. Boil a water in a pot and leave it simmering 7. Put jar in a pot of water at low simmering heat until butter melts and shake vigorously 8. Let it simmer 2-3 hours for best result, which you can reduce to 90 minutes if you're in a hurry. Make sure the water inside the jar never boils and turn it off once it boils then set it back to simmer. Shake vigorously every 20-30 minutes.

treedibles,37dp5i,GreyBeardEnt,1 point,Tue May 26 23:12:44 2015 UTC,I think you could get by with mixing some tincture into store bought sour cream.  It might be a bit runny depending on how much tincture you add.  A chunky guacamole could hold more.  You could even add some decarbed flower to Salsa Fresca and it would blend in with the other herbs.
treedibles,37dp5i,birdsRdinosaurs,3,Wed May 27 02:50:52 2015 UTC,Make some infused half and half or heavy whipping cream by adding decarbed bud to your dairy of choice and allowing to cook super low and slow (crock pot works best) for at least 3 hours but preferably six. Allow your infused cream to cool to room temp... refrigerate until yiu are ready to make your sour cream. Look up how to make buttermilk on the Internet (IIRC you just add lemon juice to regular milk and let it sit at room temp for like 10 min until thickened). Combine 2 or 3 tbs of buttermilk to 1 cup of infused dairy and whisk together. Let that mixture sit at room temp for one or two days and then refrigerate for up to a week after.

This allows the user to get high/get medicated without smoking and is therefore much healthier. However, not all of the THC/CBD/ other cannabinoids get vaporised in any given bowl. Therefore, the AVB (already vaped bud) can be used in cooking as the heat has already decarboxylated it.  Decarboxylation: The conversion of THC-A (inactive) to THC (active) using heat. Although this is done naturally when smoked/vaporised, weed must first be decarbed in an oven before cooking so as to maximise the amount of THC absorbed into the butter/oil/alcohol. However, one must be careful when decarbing the avoid vaporising any active cannabinoids. Wouldn't wanna wast any material!"
treedibles,37bt77,katza601,4,Tue May 26 16:28:53 2015 UTC,"I believe the biggest difference is the temperature.  Vaporizes work at around +300F which vaporizes many cannaboids, including THC.  When decarbing you should keep it under 300F (I set my oven for 240F and it swings from 200 to 275).  This will vaporize some terpines, but should leave most cannaboids (especially the THC)."
treedibles,37bt77,GreyBeardEnt,3,Tue May 26 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"Not much. When you vaporize, you de carboxylate your herb.  When you decarb in the oven, the herb vaporizes.  Decarb in an oven bag, and take a whiff. You'll get a serious hit.  Biggest difference is the oven in my kitchen is much bigger than the oven on my vaporizer, so if I want to decarb 8 ounces of herb for a batch of oil or something, it takes a long time to cape that much sugar trim."
treedibles,37bt77,PushcartPops,6,Tue May 26 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"If you're vaporising when you're decarbing, you're doing it wrong. It should not get you high if you were to take a whiff of it as you shouldn't be getting it hot enough to vapourish any active cannabinoids."
treedibles,37bt77,katza601,1 point,Tue May 26 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"Research terpenes.  There is some medicinal benefit, and they vaporize at 246."
treedibles,37bt77,PushcartPops,2,Tue May 26 16:34:39 2015 UTC,I always decarb at 230F for an hour. I highly recommend this.
treedibles,37bt77,katza601,1 point,Tue May 26 17:20:36 2015 UTC,Before vaping?
treedibles,37bt77,eelnitsud,2,Tue May 26 21:48:00 2015 UTC,No there's no need to decarb if you're vaping as the decarboxylation process is already happening instantaneously at Vaping temperatures. Decarboxylation is just for edibles and tinctures.
treedibles,37bt77,katza601,1 point,Tue May 26 22:20:36 2015 UTC,"Ok. No assertion as to why?   I personally prefer a less aromatic product, can you tell me why I am ""doing it wrong""?"
treedibles,37bt77,PushcartPops,1 point,Tue May 26 17:25:56 2015 UTC,Sorry I've been on mobile and busy. I have a bunch of stuff and long explanations in my comment history is you really wanna check. The best link I've found for explaining decarbing is http://www.marijuanagrowershq.com/decarboxylating-cannabis-turning-thca-into-thc/ .   As far as for why I said you would be doing it wrong if you got a huge hit from opening it up after decarbing is because that would mean you would be decarbing at too high of a temperature and therefore be vaporising some of your product. If you were to decarb at a lower temperature for longer you'd end up with more potent decarbed buds.
treedibles,37bt77,katza601,0,Tue May 26 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"I understand what decarboxylzation is and why I do it. You indicated that you bake at 230 for an hour and ""highly recommend it"". This in response to my comment that terpenes vaporize around 250, which is a reasonable temperature to decarb.  So apparently you have a smell free way of decarbing.  Could you at least give me a hint on how deep I need to creep through your posting history?"
treedibles,37bt77,PushcartPops,1 point,Tue May 26 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"Oh I said that because decarbing at 230F would avoid vaporising terpenes. My posting history is kind of irrelevent if you already know a good bit about decarbing. I arrived at my 1 hour at 230F method after a lot of research and experience, but the best info I have found came from that link I posted. Also, if you want it to smell less for a decarb, I recommend water curing and/or using a mason jar to decarb the bud in."
treedibles,37bt77,katza601,1 point,Tue May 26 19:46:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for the reply.  I didn't know if you meant that you evaluated different methods. I haven't ever heated for more than 30-40 minutes.  Just to clarify, I am not bothered by the smell of preparation, but some people don't like a strong cannabis smell in the oil."
treedibles,37bt77,PushcartPops,1 point,Tue May 26 21:30:54 2015 UTC,That is some bad information right there.  The smell when you decarb in a bag is from terpenes.
treedibles,37bt77,Senor_Destructo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:30:08 2015 UTC,"And?  Did I make an assertion that the lungful of vapor would have any particular cannabinoid composition?  Nope, just basically said that the vapor would exist.  And it does, in a strong dense cloud. I'm not trying to change anyone's mind about how they prep their herb, and Im certainly not trying to convince anyone that filling a turkey roasting bag with a couple ounces of bud is an efficient way of getting high.  I'm merely ELI5 the difference in the chemical process between decarboxylating in an oven and what happens to your herb when you vaporize it.  I didn't realize this was /r/askscience."

treedibles,377rlj,Angelsomething,6,Mon May 25 17:11:21 2015 UTC,"De are is a necessary and separate process from when the the binds with the fat in the butter. The process of decarb allows cannabioids to lose a molecule of carbon and thus bind with the fat. Check some guides online but basically you want to decarb your stash at 110C for 25min then, let it cool down and add it with to the butter, low flame for at least a couple of hours. Then filter the butter and freeze it (the freezing process will turn the water molecules not to crystals thus breaking the walls in the cells of the plant, releasing more THC in your solution).  This is me summarizing it. Check out some guides :)"
treedibles,377rlj,happyself,1 point,Mon May 25 18:30:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed with everything you suggested, except, the decarbing process is to convert the THCA molecule to THC, not to aid or affect binding with the fat, that will happen regardless.  The human cannabinoid system receptors are structured to receive THC-shaped molecules, not THCA-shaped molecules, hence the need to decarboxylate.  Here's a video illustrating it."

treedibles,377rlj,MedicatedDeveloper,2,Tue May 26 13:01:41 2015 UTC,"Decarbing happens at a higher temperature. There's a great chart floating around somewhere (here it is), but 20-25 mins at 250F (give your oven a good few cycles to preheat and be quick about opening and closing the door) works great once the bud has already been fully dried (bud you get a cured and thus a little moist, dry it first, then decarb)."

Schedule 1 means no testing so doctors aren't aware of any interaction info. Common drugs I would say they may know from experience with patients but most they won't know. I would always say try a tiny bit and wait. See how your body reacts. See how you feel. See if it helps.

treedibles,371f6t,CookInKona,-1,Sun May 24 19:40:55 2015 UTC,"Have you tested your residual material?  Coconut oil isn't really an ""extraction"" method, basically you are washing the herb off with oil. Not sure how oil would extract any cannibinoids that are not on the surface. Even if you grind down to powder, there will still be cannibinoids locked inside on a molecular level.  If you are using a solvent like butane, I would be more inclined to think that the residue is trash, but I threw away over a pound of trim before I figured out that the herb still has some use left in it. Sure, it isn't as potent as it was before washing it, but it isn't trash."

Check out more detail in this article, steps 1 through 7.   Decarb your bud in the oven at 250F/30 minutes, then grind it up. Add it to 5 tablespoons of liquified butter or coconut oil (much better potency and lasts almost forever).  (optional but will increase potency). Mix that in a blender for a minute. Put the mixture into a Pyrex measuring cup in your preheated conventional oven at the lowest setting (usually 200F, check with a thermometer to make sure it's within 20 degrees of that). Stir every 20 minutes or so, heat for at least an hour, preferably two.   Starting dosage is half a teaspoon. Do not take more until 45 minutes after you feel it, or after 3 hours of nothing, whichever comes first. If nothing is felt, double the dose and wait again. You can eat it liquified or solid, in capsules or not, with food or not."

The smoke itself isnt going to cause a problem unless the area is already dry.. i smoked durring my wisdom teeth removal. The issue is pulling on a blunt/cig because of the suction needed to draw in the cigs. The suction will pull on the wound and cause an issue.

treedibles,36rptn,gkline,1 point,Thu May 21 16:22:32 2015 UTC,"You don't decarb in oil because the temperature of oil can change rapidly on a stovetop. You probably vaporised (lost) most of your potency there. If you have an oven, there's not even a reason to do it in a pan, but if you did, you would use boiling water instead of hot oil and then place your mason in the water to decarb. Really you should just decarb in the oven at ~200F though. Afterwards, let the jar cool so anything that may have vaporised will settle back down.  You also did not allow nearly enough time for the BHO to be infused into the coconut oil. After you get done decarbing, you should infuse the coconut oil, soy lecithin, and BHO in the oven at ~200F for at least 30 min. Afterwards, let it cool again and then make your caps."

According the the journal of chromatography (that famous decarb graph) at 252 it takes 27 mins for decarb.  How long do you figure it takes your cracker and the mixture within to hit 252 once put in an oven?  5-10 mins?  I have no clue to be honest but I'd love to know.  At 250, without a decarb, I've had decent results between 40-60 mins.  Better results with a decarb for sure, pain in the butt but worth it...

treedibles,36da6l,Youlookcold,2,Mon May 18 13:51:29 2015 UTC,"I've only made firecrackers once and they we're the most potent single serving edible I've had to this day and that was back in 2011.   I took saltines, and did peanut butter or nutella on both crackers (I didn't mix and match like you did which sounds yummy) and took anywhere from probably a third of a g to a half of one and placed it on each cracker. I had no decarb step first, just smooshed weed inbetween peanut butter cracker (or nutella), wrapped in tin foil, and baked in my toaster oven on 250F for 25 minutes. They tasted extremely like weed and had me high for 12+ hours and I was absolutely couch locked (read paralyzed) for hours 4 and 5 of the trip.   Now these are probably not most people's ideal edibles but it really gave meaning to the name firecracker for me. While yours sounds like much more of a process, I'm sure the quality of each is much more consistent like you are hoping for as a medical user. Thank you for sharing your recipe OP and I have but one two-part question for you. It seems like most people lean towards coconut oil for edibles which I understand due to it's fat content makes for a good medium. Do you think that there isn't enough fat in the pb and nutella for the THC to bind to which is why you use coconut oil as well? Or is it more for the consistency of the batch and how the dose is released into the body which may make it more gradual and or smooth?   I hope this all made sense and thank you again for your in depth recipe for my all time favorite edible."

treedibles,36da6l,corbzz,2,Mon May 18 16:08:35 2015 UTC,"I'll try your method @corbzz.  I've tried to cook without decarbing first a few times and it worked but not to this degree.  At that temperature I've tried cooking for 47, 55 and 60 mins.  Perhaps I'm over doing it  Do you think that there isn't enough fat in the pb and nutella for the THC to bind to which is why you use coconut oil as well?  Probably but it's not as accessible as the coconut oil.  Tossing the mixture directly on to the coconut oil eliminates a few the variables of using pb and nutella alone.  In my mind I picture the pb and nutella acting as a barrier for the coconut oil, and adding to the mix as well.  You will notice the crackers are slightly saturated in oil after cooking.  I once tried using a tortilla shell and all of the oil ended up in the foil, well lots of oil....  Or is it more for the consistency of the batch and how the dose is released into the body which may make it more gradual and or smooth?  Consistency is something that is very important to me with edibles.  I've had a few situations where I double dosed instead of being patient and I paid for it!  The other reason is trial and error...coconut oil, for myself, has produced the best results.  I do enjoy the slow release of this edible, especially in the morning.  I'll eat a cookie about an hour after breakfast and it keeps me well medicated into the afternoon.  Zero anxiety etc....  Smoking this particular strain in the morning is a little too much for me."

treedibles,362k4u,DrizzlyEarth175,1 point,Fri May 15 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"This isn't really the case with decarbing unless you're decarbing a shitload. This is more the case when you're infusing the THC into fat. The longer you do it, the more THC molecules that will be binded to the fat molecules."
treedibles,362k4u,pheedback,4,Sat May 16 06:43:33 2015 UTC,Not gonna down vote you but it should be noted that this is not accurate. THC does not bind to fat molecules. It forms a solution - there is a big difference. This process does not take long. Decarboxylation is the reason cannabis should be heated for a significant amount of time.  Some people decarb through heating the oil and cannabis together. This takes a while because liquids absorb heat. Additionally decarbing cannabis in an oven prior to adding to oil may not cause complete decarbing. Heating in the oil can cause more decarbing.

I work with making dab-able extracts through various means and none of them take very long to be effective.  My research and experimentation with edible extractions echoes that same theme.  After the first few minutes, most people's butter or coconut oil or what have you has completely extracted the THC it is able to extract and after that it is just chlorophyll, terpenes, and other non-funstuff.  That's why my butter comes out gold and people say my edibles never taste ""weedy"" - I'm not extracting anything but the THC if I can help it!"

And have you tried increasing the temperature or time and tested if there is more potency?
treedibles,362k4u,katza601,2,Sat May 16 08:05:22 2015 UTC,"It very well may! To be honest, I don't well know the difference that decarboxylation may or may not apply to product that is extracted through different methods that follow. My stove has a large window of cooling and heating, so my method is to watch oven temps with a digital thermometer and turn it on/off when it hits a certain range over a period of time. Now that I'm comfortable with the process, my timing of balancing heat, rest, and time venting I am able to keep my temps within 5 degrees accuracy, albeit with a bit of attentiveness. I have tested with multiple temperature ranges, but not consecutively with product from the same group. I've simply found that my favorite range gave me the most consistent feeling experience between different products."

treedibles,35twot,lucifersrockingchair,6,Wed May 13 13:59:31 2015 UTC,"CBD and THC can alter the high depending on their levels.  Indica vs sativa isn't a good way to identify high CBD strains.  Most weed you buy is a hybrid and will have characteristics of both.  How high you get is all a function of your herb's cannabinoid profile (the percentage of each cannabinoid present, there's over 300 kinds!), and that mostly comes from genetics of the strain you have.    I have ""indicas"" with 20+ percent thc and no cbd, and also ""indicas"" with 4 percent of both thc and cbd.  These two strains feel way different obviously.  Mixing them also gets a third different profile and effects.  Most of us don't have access to these percent numbers yet, but someday it'll be a lot easier to understand what is going in, and by extension what kind of effects you can expect from your mix."

If you had a problem last time you decarboxylated then you likely decarbed too hot (thus vaporizing some of the thc  and losing potency). Try decarbing at 225 F for 25 - 35 minutes. If this was what your temp was set to last time, your oven may just run hot. Set it as low as it will go and devarb for 45 minutes instead. To your question of ""will it decarb in the oven while I'm cooking brownies?"" No it will not. The temperature of the brownie mix does not actually reach the temp required for the process to occur; your brownies will be weaker if you do it this way. Sorry for the rambling and typos, I'm on mobile. Let me know if this isn't clear or have any questions."
treedibles,35ryrq,birdsRdinosaurs,1 point,Wed May 13 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"Is it better to decarb to low just to be safe? Like if you decarb, but at a lower temperature, some of the bud will be decarbed, which is better than burning it, right?"
treedibles,35ryrq,AtomicTA,1 point,Wed May 13 23:49:34 2015 UTC,"So decarbing is a process that actually occurs naturally but takes a super long time (years). Adding energy to the slowly occurring natural reaction of releasing c02 and converting thca to thc speeds it up. So yes slow and low cooking will result in the same effect, but how long and how low?. For maximum thca to thc conversion you'll want to shoot for 240 degrees for 60 minutes. Now why did I recommend 25-30 minutes earlier? Because the last 30 minutes add something like 0.5% more thc conversion, so your conversion to time ratio diminishes significantly. But to maximize, go 240 for an hour. The reason most people recommend setting the temp lower around 225 is because the boiling point for thc and some other terpenes is 246 degrees. So setting the temp at 240 is flirting with vaporization and only should be done if you have a digital thermometer active in your oven (via a heat resistant cable). For home setups it's easier to just go 225 for 25-35 minutes and call it a day. For maximizing conversion, 240 (with close monitoring to avoid temp spikes for 60 minutes). The chemical reaction will occur at lower temps, but may take an unreasonable amount of time... however I don't have good data to know just how long."

I tried making caps from 15g of ABV and, probably f'd it all up.  Forgot to stir/mix the oil and powder upon initial mixing.  I can take 2-3 caps and feel absolutely nothing.  Or else, ABV was too dark.  Pretty much did the exact same thing you describe in your post above; I guess I can just do the same thing then.  I assumed (incorrectly) the process might differ"

Tonight I am taking two, and not using any other ROA until the effects have fully shown themselves.  I also made caps from 1/2oz of AVB (about 20). They're not very strong in the sense I didn't feel super stoned, but I'm thinking it's more of the other compounds (CBD etc) that are left. Waiting for the other half to get rid of her sickness bug to test their medicinal effects.  Also, I have heard taking an anti-acid (tums, remy) can help, as it reduces the acidity in your stomach and allows it to absorb the contents of the capsule better. I don't know if that's rubbish or not but worth considering :)"
treedibles,35l22d,5hawnking5,3,Mon May 11 16:54:03 2015 UTC,With oils it also helps to eat something on the fatty side first.  This slows down your body's ability to metabolize the oil which in turn means you absorb more of the THC.  There is quite a bit of THC which is either destroyed in your stomach from acids or just simply passes through your system without being absorbed.    Another good thing to add to your oil is a little soy lecithin as an emulsifier.  It doesn't add anything to to potency but it does increase your body's ability to absorb the THC.  I use this as reference tool whenever making oil and it's easily one of the best oil extraction methods I've seen.
treedibles,35l22d,your_login_here,1 point,Mon May 11 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"With my stomach, the tums would probably help.  All kinds of stomach issues with me.  The first and second time I took 1 cap, I kind of felt a SLIGHT euphoria for about 10 minutes.  Other than that, didnt matter if I took one or two, nothing at all.  Figuring I might pop 4 to see if that does anything and if not, just toss the batch.  Shame to waste it but, oh well."

treedibles,35l22d,your_login_here,3,Mon May 11 20:00:15 2015 UTC,does it make a difference if you freeze before decarbing?
treedibles,35l22d,your_login_here,3,Mon May 11 19:33:12 2015 UTC,The idea of freezing is to saturate the plant material with something that will expand slightly when frozen.  This helps to break down the plant even further to get to all the good stuff.  The order is not important but it is much easier to decarb prior to adding oil.  This also helps to dry everything out even more which makes for easier grinding.

treedibles,35ky1h,Saugenes,1 point,Tue May 12 23:51:58 2015 UTC,"Well, decarbing generally doesn't take hours. Set your oven to 240F, put the bud in a deep pan covered in foil, leave it in there for maybe 20 minutes, give or take, and you're good. It will smell but unless you're living with seasoned stoners, they won't even recognize that it's weed.  EDIT: Also, make sure you grind that shit."

treedibles,35j0ss,colenotphil,1 point,Mon May 11 00:19:45 2015 UTC,"no prob. i gotchya. yeah, that's basically what i do. I use a typical mason jar, which are used for canning, so they generally can withstand the heat.  Just make sure the water level in the pot is about the same level as the everclear in the mason jar. The temp is only 170F, so the jar touching the bottom of the pot isn't a huge issue. I did have one crack and break on me one time, when i took the jar out because the temp was getting too high (don't let it go over 172F, you want it +/- 2 degrees F from 170F) and i guess the difference in temp caused it to shatter all over the counter.  but it should only be a light bubbling boil, so it shouldn't be too dangerous to leave it in the pot. If you are concerned, i'd put a dishtowel or rag between the pot surface and the jar, just make sure it's level and the jar won't tip over."
treedibles,35j0ss,gandador,1 point,Mon May 11 04:13:43 2015 UTC,"Yes decarb it and I would recommend using the same process as am alcohol based hash but just don't boil out all of it , and it's all going to depend how strong you want it to be. Assuming .1 Gram doses (which are very light but the legal dosage in Colorado I believe) it should make ~70 doses.

I tried looking some up, but each one that I saw was really vague about the weed-alcohol ratio. I think the only non-vague one was 1oz per 1 quart of everclear, so should I use 1 cup since I have a quarter?"
treedibles,35j0ss,gandador,5,Sun May 10 23:46:47 2015 UTC,"Ok so I can't find the guide that I used so I'm just going to do my best at explaining my process.   1.) (This step is optional but GREATLY improves the flavor of your end product) Water cure your bud by soaking it in cold waterchanged every twelve hours. I typically change the water at least 6 time (3 days) but even just doing this once helps tremendously. This step helps extract a lot of the terpenes and chlorophyll without removing any of the cannabanoids.  2.) Grind your bud as finely as possible and decarb it (I use a coffee grinder to do this)  3.) Put the bud in a container that can be used for double boiling (I use a mason jar) and add enough everclear to reach roughly double the level of your bud (A cup should be sufficient for this)  4.) Now double boil the mixture over an electric hot plate (No open flames, do not breath in the fumes) until the mixture is roughly half of the original volume.  5.) Strain the mixture through cheesecloth and store in a colored glass dropper jar (most local health food stores sell them for other herbal tinctures and extracts)  Enjoy your product. Note that when using this high of a proof of alcohol the tincture can't really be taken sublingually because it burns like a motherfucker, take it from me.  I've never tried it for a tincture but when I make hash oil nowadays instead of boiling the bud in with the alcohol,I just violently shake it in a closed container with the everclear for 3 to 5 minutes and then strain it before the boil. I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way to do it but it might be worth trying since it extracts far less of the chlorophyll and other non-cannabanoids.  If you have any questions just let me know!"

It will take 7-11 min usually, I check at 5 min, take it out, spin the flask to make sure it's evenly heated, back in until the big bubbles stop, take flask out and add everclear and cool it with hot tap water (cold tap may cause glass to break) or cool with hot tap then add ever clear   Hot oil bath is the same, basically a double boiler but with oil that can reach more than 212f, you can do it at 250f but hotter it will go faster, put flask in hot oil, make sure not direct contact with pan or whatever the oil is in but only in the oil, thermometer in oil watching oil temp, watch the concentrate bubble, take out when big bubbles stop  Small bubbles from the bottom of the flask are me volatile terpenes boiling. If you see vapor coming off it may be a little too hot. Decarb bubbles form throughout the oil, bubbles like mad then ceases quickly, have to stop the reaction then. Don't stress the glass, never put it in cold water. Pyrex can take 280f to 115f but you risk breaking it with larger temp change,   http://skunkpharmresearch.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/decarboxylation-graph-1-11.jpg?w=584 "" I usually estimate between 60-70% thc depending on quality"

treedibles,350ws0,Explore411,0,Wed May 6 17:17:23 2015 UTC,"That's not how water curing works. Water curing separates the chlorophyll and other components from the already infused oil (since chlorophyll and other not so tasty chemical compounds are water soluble and water and oil are imiscible). Water curing prior to decarbing is essentially just washing your weed, which will remove crystal formations (kief) and make your final product less potent. If you are primarily worried about the smell of decarbing, grab some cinnamon sticks and/or clove at the store, toss them in a pot of water and simmer that shit. Your place will smell like Christmas moreso than weed. TLDR; don't wash your weed before decarbing. Mask the smell (or at least try to) of decarbing some other way."
treedibles,350ws0,birdsRdinosaurs,4,Wed May 6 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"Er, water curing is traditionally done to buds before smoking. The idea of using it for removing taste in edibles or oil is relatively new."

treedibles,350gzx,dewbles,2,Wed May 6 05:30:51 2015 UTC,"Well I'm guessing you're trying to make some sort of free flowing sugar like from the bag but coated/infused with weed and not just some hard candies  While sugar may not be soluble in alcohol 151 is 25% water which will dissolve the sugar and create a mess?   And even if you used everclear(95%) and successfully coated a bunch of sugar why?  What you can do with the sugar is limited since thc is more non polar and won't dissolve in water so you won't have much luck just throwing a spoon into your coffee/tea and if you are just going to use it to bake why not just throw the 151 with weed into the food. If you tried it in your coffee/tea without a bit of milk/cream with fat the sugar will dissolve and the thc and insoluble oils will glob up and stick to the container probably,  again if you're adding fat might as well add the 151 to the cream or with the cream not using sugar  Sugar is not a good carrier for thc for absorption though.  Oil,  alcohol,  a few other things will work as a carrier but not straight sugar like I think you're trying to do"

treedibles,34z6rm,lhatchy1,1 point,Tue May 5 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"1).  Yes, but let me explain why.  If you eat raw weed, you will not get high.  THC becomes available to you once it's been decarbed (lightly toasted), and I don't believe that process happens as efficiently when your weed is inside a sandwich.  On the flip side, weed is as potent as it's going to get post-decarb, so cooking it further may burn off some of your THC.  For the strongest firecrackers possible, decarb your bud, and add it to your fully cooked sandwiches.  2)  Totally depends on your tolerance.  I mean edible tolerance, btw, as it's very different from smoking.  If this is your first edible experience, I would recommend 1 teaspoon decarbed bud as an absolute maximum per person.  There's no shame in doing less.  I know you want to go to outer space here, but if you overdo it, you'll probably sleep through everything, or get really nauseous for several hours.    3) There really shouldn't be a lasting smell, especially if you have 3 days.  Just cook something smelly afterwards (Curry, Pumpkin Pie, literally anything which will make your house smell delicious)."

Be accurate at higher temp cause thc will more readily oxidize to cbn under too much heat but occurs more slowly with less heat,  but the decarb reaction goes slower too  With one of my methods I have to be fairly accurate but I decarb under rather high heat but very quickly,  takes usually less than 10 min,  if I don't watch it carefully and it over heats or is heated a minute too long im going to be making cbn, not usually desirable  One way to test your oven is put some cooking oil in a Pyrex cup or something else oven safe set it to a certain temp and then test the oil with a kitchen thermometer and see what Temps it gets to don't need anything fancier"

Mangoes,  how much myrcene do they contain? http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/15769159/Volatile-components-from-mango-Mangifera-indica-L.-cultivars. The total concentration of volatiles was approximately 18-123 mg/kg of fresh fruit. Terpene hydrocarbons were the major volatiles of all cultivars, the dominant terpenes being delta-3-carene (cvs. Haden, Manga amarilla, Macho, Manga blanca, San Diego, Manzano, Smith, Florida, Keitt, and Kent), limonene (cvs. Delicioso, Super Haden, Ordonez, Filipino, and La Paz), both terpenes (cv. Delicia), terpinolene (cvs. Obispo, Corazon, and Huevo de toro), and alpha-phellandrene (cv. Minin).  There's some other papers but their abstracts aren't as clear and I don't have access to full article  Based on http://ucanr.edu/datastoreFiles/608-376.pdf&sa=U&ei=SolBVZHuL4yxyATd6YGoAQ&ved=0CBoQFjAGOB4&usg=AFQjCNEXRiWWMyI1Q97hi0CydSY4Xs4CLw It seems like myrcene could be 10% of that fraction  1kg of mangoes would then have 1.8-12mg of myrcene  The papers cited in the Wikipedia talk about using 1-200mg/kg of myrcene to elicit certain effects in mice. Even if you are 45kg, you need at least 5kg of mangoes to get near that much,  and you'd need actually more due to bioavailability issues since in the papers myrcene is injected ip.  If you want to know about beer,  a beer, typical ipa 12oz, probably has about 1.5-3g of hops used in a dry hop per beer. Hops are at most a few percent oils,  again with myrcene only being a fraction of the total, maybe say 3% total oils being generous, myrcene is 10% of that again,  that 0.3% total of 2-3g is potential myrcene in your beer. That's at most 9mg myrcene in a beer,  and that's probably quite high really  So, yea,  myrcene..."

treedibles,34cbyq,angelcake,2,Thu Apr 30 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"You should be able to find an oven thermometer at any hardware store, I would be surprised if Home Depot didn't have one.  Keep in mind that every time you use it it gets a little bit less accurate because of the way they're made.  If you can find a setting on your toaster oven that is stable around 200 Fahrenheit you should be fine. At that temperature I would decarb for an hour.    I have never decarbed using boiling water in a mason jar, I do it in the oven not in a pot of boiling water. The contents of the jar will not get any hotter than the water. You have to make sure that the jar is sealed properly and completely covered with water - The same as if you're making jam - and you may need to put weight on top of it to keep it from floating.  Boiling is 212 Fahrenheit at that temperature you would want to give it about 45 minutes. The best way to avoid any temperature change issues is to start off with warm water, put a rack in the bottom of the pot if you can, the space will keep the jar temperature more stable, bring the water to the boiling point, and then start your timer from there. Once you hit 45 minutes turn the heat off let everything cool down. Do not unseal the jar until it's back to room temperature.   Again I have not decarbed in boiling water myself, what I wrote above is based on my knowledge of canning, decarbing and food science in general.  Make sure your jar is completely intact, inspect it for cracks and chips, you don't want to take any chances of it breaking.  Make sure you use a new lid so that the rubber seals to the glass properly.  You don't want to over tighten the lid, you basically want to gently turn it by hand until it is snug and not push it any further.  Because of the air in the jar it is critical to keep it covered with water at all times. You can buy very small canning jars, as small as 4 ounces, I would go with the smallest one that will accommodate your weed, less air, not as many chances of something going wrong."

treedibles,34bnaw,sfshia,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"Yes it's going to smell some when you cook with it.  No, the smell is not going to stick around - it's not like cigarette smoke.  You SHOULD be able to cook with it in the morning and clear the smell out by afternoon."
treedibles,34blo4,spicyenema,3,Wed Apr 29 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"You need to find the THC percentage of your bud and I'd also put 20-30% possible loss.  7g = 7000mg. Assuming your bud is 15%THC, then that would put it at 1050mg total. 1050mg/30pieces = 35mg/pieces. Factor in 20-30% THC loss, 0.8 * 35 mg/pc = 28 mg/pc OR 0.7 * 35 mg/pc = 24.5 mg/pc  I factor in 20-30% THC loss because you might not activate all the THC-A during your decarb, or some THC might be lost due to vaporization during decarb. Not to mention there is still possibility losing butter in the process (stuck to cheese cloth, loss due to boiled too long, stuck to hand, etc).  Now it depends on whether you want to make sure it's strong enough or weak enough. At least now you have a range where the brownies would be between 24.5 - 35mg/piece (low end at 30% loss, high end at 0% loss) with a higher likelihood being in the 28mg/piece (20% loss is pretty likely, unless you're very careless)."

Be safe, it may take up to two hours or more to kick in.  Edibles are a planned high/buzz, smoking or vaping is if you want to be high right now.  To actually do the calculations you want, put 16 for 16 oz (or this is the same as 32 for 32 tablespoons) of coconut oil in the ""servings"" option, then you will see how much you need to dilute it for your recipes.  http://i.imgur.com/zF3KXBW.png   This shows how much THC should be in one tablespoon of your coconut oil. I'd call this 10-15 servings. This means that 1 tablespoon diluted in however much oil you need in a recipe will be 10-15 servings of THC. Treat your infused oil as a concentrated way of dosing."

treedibles,343t5f,violentbocceball,4,Tue Apr 28 02:03:52 2015 UTC,"First we'd need to know how potent the nugs were that you used for your caps previously. If you're unsure, you can assume perhaps 10% THC by weight for regs, 15% for higher quality buds.  1.5 grams of bud would therefore contain between 150mg to 225mg of THC. Divide that by 10 caps and you get 15 to 22.5mg of THC per cap.  Now we need to estimate the THC content of your hash oil. That number can vary from 50% to 90%+ and is even more difficult to gauge because you can't tell solely based on consistency, color, etc.  Assuming you want your caps to contain 20mg THC, you'd need 20-40mg of hash oil per cap. For 10 caps that would be 200-400mg. Your estimate of 300mg is about as accurate as we can get :)"

Then stick the butter and herb in a mason jar and every 10-15 open the top to release the pressure that may build up.   Just make sure to be careful while handling it as the glass will be hot and mason jars can be temperamental when being heated so you dont want to shake it around too much.

treedibles,33qzs6,IMightBePaulasBitch,3,Fri Apr 24 20:11:12 2015 UTC,The boiling point of THC is 157 degrees celsius so you want to keep it under that temperature.

treedibles,33qzs6,deletedLink,2,Sat Apr 25 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"The things to think about here is internal temperature of the goods being baked.  If you are doing quick baked goods you can fully decarb the material before and work it into the cookie dough,  muffins, cake etc. since the temperature of those doesn't get as high as the oven is.   The thing is once you make thca into thc the thc will readily degrade into cbn at excessive temperatures (like 300f) but in baking,  etc.  The material rarely ever reaches that temperature.   When making caramel too you have to consider the time and the heat in the decarb, or you add your already decarb stuff after cooking the caramel,  and don't try and decarb it all in the cooking of the caramel cause the time/temp isn't sufficient for a compete conversion. I only know about making one kind of caramel for pecan turtles but if I was to make infused caramel I would cook the caramel then add the weed or extract or whatever you're trying to infuse after taking it off heat"

The most efficient temperature at which to extract THC from the buds (and maximize the potency of the extraction) Cooking with already extracted canna-butter or canna-oil.   For the best decarbing, you want about 235 F for ~25 minutes.   Once extracted, you can cook with it up to 340."

The coconut oil also pretty much meant that they didn't have to worry about the temper, but what's the fun in that?   I've used some amazing oil and the flavors of the chocolate that comes out is amazing.

But you are ONE of the stupidest people I've met because you apparently blindly believe everything you read online.   Let me help you:  I can search anything -- i.e. Chocolate and I will find thousands of references telling me that IT WILL kill my dog.   I like to ask ""why"" -- here is the answer.  The reality is anything if given in sufficient quantities will most likely kill something (i.e. a few people die each year from drinking too much water).   The science: Chocolate is a BAD CHOICE for dog treats. It doesn't taste the same to them, so they don't really enjoy it the way we do (they taste about 1/50th of what we do, and smell 300x what we do), also mouth feel for them is very different so chocolate doesn't really make sense.  They lack the stomach enzymes to digest oils and in sufficient quantities it will most likely give them the runny oily pool issues.  BUT MOSTLY it's empty calories, and if you fed your dog (or child) nothing but chocolate they will die because it is nutritionally void. TL;DR - your pooch will appreciate a milk bone a lot more.   But some dog lover decided I was too dumb to understand the science and it would be better to /simplify/ the chocolate+dogs message into ""chocolate will kill your dog"".    So friend, chocolate won't kill your dog -- they just tell you that so stupid people (like you) won't intentionally feed it to your dog.   TL;DR - don't believe everything you read online."

Calling me the stupidest person you've ""met"" because I happen to think weed is a horrible thing to feed to your dog? You sir are an ass. Google will tell you that LSD will kill you too but that doesn't mean you won't get the few results that actually know what they're fucking talking about. Sorry that Mr. Butthurt wants to get his dog high and is pissed off that he can't. Do you feed your dog chocolate for fun too? Don't be an idiot dude. This rant on chocolate has absolutely NOTHING to do with feeding your dog weed. I know chocolate won't kill a pet, because I've seen them eat it and survive, just like your dog isn't supposed to eat chicken bones but I've certainly come home to my family dog licking his lips after downing an entire tray of wings she pulled off the counter and she lived to tell the tale.

There are a lot of posts in this sub Reddit on that but I'll give you a brief rundown.  Dry your herb thoroughly and grind it in a coffee grinder or use a mortar and pestle, the coffee grinder is easier.  Put the ground material into a real mason jar [that is a jar that is made for home canning, not a leftover spaghetti sauce jar]. Seal the jar with the standard two-piece lid, snug but don't reef on it.  Put the jar in the oven at ~210 Fahrenheit for about 45 minutes.  Gently shake it a couple of times. Once the time has passed take it out of the oven and let it cool on the counter until the jar is completely cold. Do not open it until it is cold.  Melt your butter or coconut oil [don't use vegetable oil] and pour it into the jar. Reseal the jar, swish it around vigorously so that the ground and decarbed weed is mixed with the melted oil/butter.  Put the jar in a pot and add enough water  [or in a crockpot if it has good temperature control] to reach just below the lid ring on the jar. Cover the pot, bring the water to a simmer, somewhere between 200-210 Fahrenheit.  Let it simmer away, swishing it occasionally [being careful not to burn your fingertips blah blah blah] for about at least six hours, I usually go to 12.  At this point you can strain the oil or you can leave the plant matter in there, it will make for a stronger tasting product but it also leaves all the health green stuff in there.  I generally use a ratio of 1/4 ounce of cannabis to 1/4 cup of oil or butter."
treedibles,3397dz,just_for_kicks_2825,6,Mon Apr 20 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"Get a thermos that's rated for 6+ hours for heat and that can fit the amount you are trying to make. Boil water and butter in separate pot. Grind herbs and place in bottom of thermos while butter and water are heating. Once boiling, drain into thermos and cap it off. Can't tell you how many times I've done this, but smell free for the entire process until you open the jar 4+ hours later. The smell will smack you in the face  when opened so be weary of opening around those who aren't cool with herbs. Strain off plant material from butter and water into separate container. Let sit in fridge overnight to separate. Drain water in morning. Boom. Mostly smell free butter for those delicious treats that take you places"

Also simmer for 3hrs like you did, then put the oil/bud mixture in the freezer for atleast 2.5 hrs, then simmer for another 3hrs.

treedibles,338yr7,roadkingrm,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:05:50 2015 UTC,I figured since it was simmering for so long it wouldn't need to be decarbed. Oh well I'll know for next time.
treedibles,338yr7,EBulvid,2,Mon Apr 20 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"yeah the simmering is at about 200 or so so its not warm enough to turn the THCa into THC.  Try it in the oven at about 225 for half hour or 40 minutes.  It will be crumbly and slightly brownish now. Cover it with foil on a baking sheet or a dish or something.  It will smell up your house during this step though, but search ""decarbing in mason jars no smell"" and I havent tried it but I guess the smell is minimal if you have to worry about it."
treedibles,337dnx,redditchicken,3,Mon Apr 20 05:35:58 2015 UTC,"When you're making edibles at home it's very hard to guesstimate dosages until you have done it a few times. Every strain is a little bit different, decarbing makes a difference, baking temperature can impact potency if it's too high etc.  My advice is this. The quantities you are using will yield a fairly weak cookie however you can always have 2. My rule of thumb is try what you believe will be the right dosage and wait at least an hour. It's best to do this on a day when you don't have to be anywhere so that if you end up couch locked it's not a big deal.  Once you know how you respond to one cookie you can adjust the dosage from there."
treedibles,337dnx,angelcake,2,Mon Apr 20 11:30:04 2015 UTC,"This is it. Make sure you can try the cookies beforehand! Redosing is a dangerous area when it comes to edibles.

treedibles,337dnx,farfel00,2,Mon Apr 20 13:58:40 2015 UTC,"Hang on.    Do you want to make edibles for first time cannabis users, or first time edible users?  Those are very different questions.  I wouldn't feel comfortable making edibles for first time cannabis users, just because the high lasts so much longer.  Your friends are much more likely to have negative reactions with a 5 hour high than a half-hour high.  Even really weak edibles can easily overwhelm a non-user.  Make them hit a bong or something first, and if they think it's their kind of thing, then I would offer them edibles another time."
treedibles,337dnx,ChrispyK,2,Mon Apr 20 15:54:01 2015 UTC,"It depends on the quality of weed, we can guesstimate and let's say 15% thc. So 3.5g * .15 = .525g * 1000(conversion to mg) = 525mg thc total. 525mg/60(cookies)=8.75mg per cookie. So base on this depending on your quality of bud they can be ~8.75(+/-)mg per cookie. A single does is considered 10mg. If you add turmeric and lecithin into the butter when it's done/when it's cookie, you will get a lot more out of the butter. I would recommend using coconut oil if you have it, it has more saturated fat for the thc to bind to. The turmeric and lecithin will help with the absorption in your body, making the edibles extremely efficient. Also make sure you decarb. Always decarb."

As for mixing it directly into melted chocolate, I haven't done it myself but I have seen posts from people who have. Keep in mind that chocolate is extremely delicate, if you overheat it it will curdle.  What I would do is dry it, decarb it, process it with a small amount of cacao butter on a low temperature for a couple of hours and then mix that into your melted chocolate. Cacao butter is the fat from chocolate so it would not be detrimental to the taste and it would probably give you a better end result because the fat helps to separate the THC from the rest of the plant matter.  This is not a very scientific exclamation, I'm sure someone will come behind me and do a better job explaining this."

In a nutshell for butter or coconut oil they boil the weed for an hour in a pot of water, then chuck the butter or oil right in there, simmer for an hour, and recommend simmering three more times after a cooling at each simmer, why the cooling is relevant is beyond me, so I just follow the recipe but keep simmered for around three hours, the product, when used in baking even the simplest betty crocker cookies, gets me where i want to be. BTW water boils at 99.9C where I live (100C is sea level). Sometimes simple works best, you could get all geek lab about this, but seriously, is it gonna really make that much difference? There seems to be this fear that the THC vaporises away above certain temps, obviously this is true, but boiling THC where I live anyway is nowhere near the temps needed to vape the butter or break down the THC and anyway, the geeks are looking to make medicines, not space cookies for fun and giggles. No offence to any previous posters, but it just seems there is too much guessing and paranoia. Get a recipe from a reputable site, and stick with it if it gets you wasted, if tinkering was gonna make that much difference there would surely be an optimal recipe by now. I have heard 90C for 24 hours or 110C for 110 minutes, in the same recipe, I'm thinking 100C (give or take) for 2-3-4 hours (give or take) will all work well enough within the range for a good yield. bake and be happy!"

Basically fill the jar of avb with distilled water, let it sit for a few hours even and the water will turn brown, strain out the water, and repeat, letting it sit over night, until the water comes out clear. Then dry out the bud in sunlight, or in the oven on about 100F or something  As for tea i feel like youd be better off making some cream to put in it, i dont know how else to make tea as the active compounds are not water soluble"

treedibles,32nwnn,GordonS333,2,Wed Apr 15 08:15:14 2015 UTC,"The old rumor was that citric acid would potentiate psychedelics like mushrooms and acid, but I never saw any real science on that and I've always been pretty suspect. I would assume that avoiding strenuous physical activity would speed digestion. I mean I really don't know what I'm talking about here, but as I recall when you're exercising etc. blood is directed more toward your limbs (assuming you're running or lifting) and digestion slows down. I think this is doubly true if you're significantly stressed at the moment. So many like chillax and meditate or something?    The other idea, and again I'm really not positive on this stuff, would be to take something that might speed your system up a bit, like those weird blends people use when they go on a cleanse. I don't know if they work like that, but something with like lemon juice, cayenne, cinnamon, etc. might help with that. I haven't used anything in years, so there might be some cooler method on the scene now. I know shatter is supposed to be nice, maybe there's something you could do with that? Or perhaps eat a Leary Buscuit/Firecracker as you dose yo give you a little something while you wait?  What I can tell you is that in the end oral is one of the slowest and iirc least efficient methods of administration. You want to get those precious molecules in your bloodstream and hopping across the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) where they can work their magic. Shooting tends to be king for this (obviously), and then iirc its snorting, and smoking, eating and then finally plugging. Its been years since I was obsessed with drug science though. What I have read does indicate a correlation between the speed of onset and a substances relative addictiveness, so maybe you've got a hidden benefit here in terms of counteracting the habit forming tendencies that come with weed.      I used to have pretty good success with Green Dragon. I used Evercelar to make sure I was getting the max out of it possible. I think I put like a half ounce in a fifth plus random shake, stems, and trimming people gave me that I didn't care about. With that I was able to use a shot glass of the stuff in a can of coke and get nicely buzzed. Of course with that you have to deal with the effects of Everclear as well which if you're not an Olympic level drinker like I used to be, can really knock you on your ass."

treedibles,32nwnn,papanoir,2,Wed Apr 15 13:44:05 2015 UTC,"I've experimented with this for a long time. My findings were that capsules in general call for a different lifestyle than smoking. You have to ""plan"" your highs. And after months of experimentation, timing has become second nature to me.  On an empty stomach immediately after I wake up from my 8hr sleep, a capsule takes 30 minutes or less to kick in. This is the optimum and only guaranteed time to take it in which it will work. Mornings are my favorite. I take one every day before going into work (a very light dose). (Might be worthy to note that my metabolism is such that I take a shit every morning, so I know my stomach is purely empty when I wake up.)  Now, say you plan on extending your high a couple hours from that initial dose. Changes to your diet must be made if you are to adopt the capsule lifestyle. The key is to postpone breakfast/lunch to noon for me, so I can take another capsule at around 10am. My first capsule is taken at 7am and wears off by 10.  After lunch, nothing is certain. Depending on the size of the lunch you ate at 12am, you could pop another capsule then and not feel it until 8pm. This happens constantly for me. The key is to eat a small lunch, like a home made turkey sandwich. Then, 3 hours later, pop a capsule. By 5pm, on your way home from work, you'll start to feel it.   All I can say is treat this is one large experiment and document what you eat and onset times. Find a schedule that works for you. But if you think you can eat a large ass burrito bowl from chipotle and take a capsule and having it kick in anytime soon, you're kidding yourself. (Chipotle specifically delays capsule ingestion for me by over 4 hours).  This all may sound like a hassle, but I love the high from capsules so much more than smoking. And smoking makes my lungs feel like shit."

Because each capsule holds .95 ml then i need at least 20 ml of coconut oil (a little over a tbsp) Most people recommend 1 to 4 lecithin to oil ratio so thats 15 ml of oil and 5 ml of lecithin (i use liquid form)  Good results so far"

I think we're the same in that we have an idea of our own dose based on the amount of doses we make, but don't know the specific amounts of thc or cbd because these properties change tree to tree and we dont have expensive lab equipment. By leaving the strength of 1g flower up to the user everything else stays the same as far as weight.  Ie if a gram of mids kicks your ass dont eat a gram of kind next batch.  We all get different quality flower but we get used to our own tolereance so you can kindve guess what a g of 'better' or 'worse' would do based on our own previous experience.

Make your canna butter/oil. Prepare your edibles.  I generally estimate dosage by taking the number of servings and doubling those.  For example if your recipe makes two dozen cookies then start with 1/2 a cookie and go up or down from there.  I usually do this on a day when I have nothing else to do, just in case.  Eat 1/2 a cookie, wait at least an hour and see how you feel.  Base your dosage on that.   If you really want the math then I can't help you but this method has worked for me for three years."

treedibles,32mk16,reppinthe509,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"You need to find yourself some hard cracker or graham crackers if they are available... hard granola bars could work as well if you have any of those (you might since you are traveling).  If you don't, you can try making a firecracker without the cracker. I guess spread nutella on a piece of tinfoil and spread your finely ground bud - about a gram - on the nutella and seal the pouch. Leave enough room so that you aren't squeezing the nutella and bake it for 21 minutes are 315* farenheit (157 celsius). Then you can open the pouch and scrape up and eat the nutella/herb mix.   Alternatively, just decarb your weed in a tin foil pouch (just grind it up and seal it in tinfoil and bake at 250 degrees for 30 minutes -121 celsius). Once it is decarbed, it is similar to AVB and you can just eat it, but it will be kinda gross. To make it better, mix the nutella in the milk to make chocolate/hazelnut milk and add the decarbed bud.   I haven't really tried either method (I have made AVB milk... not decarbed bud milk) but I don't see why they wouldn't work."

I remember the article cited poor training for both officers and dogs, so hopefully it's just that and not widespread malice. It's a neat idea to have a dog sniff for gluten but I wonder how effective that is--Have you read anything about dogs getting confused by gluten being in practically everything around them?

But if you're like me and cant...From personal experience, whats really making things difficult is that the lecithin emulsifies a lot of the oil with the water, which changes how easily you can filter out any solids with coffee filters. a repeated freeze/thaw/reheat cycle where you filter out the broken glass and water is in your future.  I found that freezing was good at drawing the moisture back out of the frozen oil/water/ lecithin sludge.  it grew big fuzzy crystals on the Tupperware in the freezer that i could remove by hand. As fas as glass man. Dont eat it. Toss it.  If you're like me and won't...just make sure you dont eat any that hasn't passed through a paper filter without tearing. Dont eat it though."

treedibles,3237ld,trevaman12,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:52:16 2015 UTC,Now when you say 240 degrees for 90 min does that mean you stick the green in the oven and then have it gradually make its way to 240 or do you preheat the oven to 240 and then stick it in and time it out??
treedibles,320udf,Monsanta,3,Thu Apr 9 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"I would definitely decarb it first, but you want to make it ahead of time, and make extra so you can test it out before you go to the airport.     You don't want to accidentally make it so strong that it's not enjoyable.   This way you can also know that it will be effective as well -- I have screwed up and not decarbed ahead of time and then got no effect.    One way to do it is to get some pure grain alcohol (also called Everclear or Golden Grain)  or at least Bacardi 151 and do an alcohol extraction.    Then you can take the alcohol tincture and mix it in with melted chocolate or some honey and let the alcohol evaporate.    If you use the chocolate, you can then roll it in coconut and have some chocolate coconut balls to eat.    This method is super stealthy -- no one would suspect a thing."
treedibles,320udf,rebble-yell,2,Fri Apr 10 03:52:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Can you elaborate a bit on the alcohol extraction using just a small amount of wax? Also the process of getting the tincture to evaporate from the chocolate? I'm really just trying to convert one G of wax quickly and easily into an edible form, or even 1/2 G if possible. I'll be eating it right before I get to the airport, so stealth is less of a concern."
treedibles,320udf,rebble-yell,2,Fri Apr 10 11:45:49 2015 UTC,"Is the wax already decarbed?  If not, decarb it.    Then all you do is dissolve the wax into the drinking alcohol.    Warming them slightly helps.    Just take a little alcohol and your wax into a small container, and then heat them and mix them together -- the wax will dissolve right into the alcohol -- the alcohol is an excellent carrier of the wax.  Then use an eyedropper or pipette to suck up the alcohol-wax tincture you just made.    Then you just mix the tincture into the chocolate or honey, and heat that mixture to above 170 degrees F -- the boiling point of alcohol.   The alcohol will evaporate off, and you have the wax then mixed into whatever you mixed it in with -- cheese, chocolate, honey, etc.    Since you used drinking alcohol, it won't really matter if a tiny bit of alcohol remains behind, but it might be easier to get it all out.  You know you got it all out when the temperature of the mixture rises above 170 F -- until all the alcohol is evaporated, the mix will stay at around 170.  An infrared temp gun is very helpful to measure the temps here.    The honey is nice because you can take it sublingually I have heard (never tried it).   The THC is supposed to just cross your mouth's mucous membrane into your bloodstream -- never tried that, just evaporated the tincture into vegetable glycerine."

It turned out legit but there was so much conflicting info between recipes and there was a good amount of trial and error.   Look on the sidebar, should be a recipe for Green Dragon. I'd start there. I ended up using around 9 grams of kinda shitty material and have 2 oz of tincture. 2 droppers full got me to a 6 but I took each dropper full about 1.5 hours apart to test it out. I could probably evaporate off more of the alcohol and make it more concentrated but I'm good with what I got.   It was not easy though in my opinion.

treedibles,31nnwu,slirpo,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:41:50 2015 UTC,"It will work if you don't, but remember we all have our own little preferences. I like lighter capsules so I don't get too high, and Garyn (the  MBM designer) likes the effect of THCA (non-decarbed) so he included a 160F setting in the MBM2.  If you make oil at 160F and don't decarb separately and you're a recreational user, you're gonna have a bad time. If you use 220F for an hour, it will indeed work, but if you use 250F for an hour (to decarb) and then run it another hour at 220F, it will likely work even better.  I've been told that the new version of the MBM recommends separate decarbing. I've almost always decarbed every time, and the only times I don't do that are (a) when I run the MBM at 250F for the first hour or (b) when I'm using weed that's been lost in my back closet for 2 years, so it's already decarbed by time. Coincidentally, that's exactly what I am doing at this very moment!"

Edit: make sure you decarb.
treedibles,31mbbi,angelcake,2,Mon Apr 6 12:13:24 2015 UTC,"I thought that might be the case, my only thinking was as we have never had edibles and are both pretty sensitive that making them slightly weaker will give a little bit more control. Whats your opinion on that?"
treedibles,31mbbi,IceChinchilla,2,Mon Apr 6 12:16:26 2015 UTC,"Making them less potent is much easier. I tend to use around an eighth of crip for each stick to half stick of butter.

treedibles,31mbbi,IceChinchilla,2,Mon Apr 6 12:23:20 2015 UTC,"decarb in the oven. tin foil and oven bags will help with the smell, if you don't want to stink up your house that is. After you make your butter and it separates off, I second the washing technique. Wash it twice after the initial separation. The third time the water's just clear anyway. That ratio is fine, decarb will help. Just figure out what your dosage is. Also the quality of your herb has a lot to do with it also.. THC%"
treedibles,31mbbi,angelcake,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:40:24 2015 UTC,"I know the oven method works but have never actually tried the water bath.   That reminds me though, you can wash your butter by adding some warm water to your strained out cannabutter and stir. The water will pull out the chlorophyll and all that weed taste. Put it in the fridge and the butter and water will separate, sending the weed particles and water to the bottom while the butter hardens on top. Then you just pull it off."

treedibles,31haww,the_simple_ent,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:53:02 2015 UTC,Not at all! I've used darker AVB than that in firecrackers and they still get me to a solid 5-6. You're good!
treedibles,31haww,whatyouwere,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:59:18 2015 UTC,Never! AVB will almost always  still have  cannabinoids trapped in the fibers that vaping can't extract
treedibles,31haww,Cobalt_97,1 point,Sun Apr 5 11:56:03 2015 UTC,Yeah man most of my abv is way darker than that. You good
treedibles,31haww,backstageninja,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:32:36 2015 UTC,That actually looks like an awesome color for a great time with avb. You could even go darker if you want
treedibles,31ghbz,_Stay_High_,3,Sat Apr 4 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"Testing is easy.  Take a teaspoon of butter and wait 2-3 hours.  You will be tempted to eat more, but DON'T.  This way, you can calculate how much of a high your edibles will have.  There's nothing that says that you have to use only cannabutter in your edibles if you only want something that will get you buzzed for a few hours.  I would still tell you to use the same amount of butter suggested in your recipe, but supplement your cannabutter with normal butter as you see fit."
treedibles,31ghbz,ChrispyK,2,Sat Apr 4 23:14:14 2015 UTC,After your butter is done.. Pour boiling water over the butter and wisk for a few minutes after everything is melted again. Then let the water and butter separate in the fridge or freezer. When it separates pour out the waste water and melt it down one more time with hot water. This will filter out all the junk you don't want and help with the taste
treedibles,31ghbz,nonzeroa,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:32:41 2015 UTC,"OK, so half oz of decarb to half lb butter (2 sticks). Strained and stored.  It is dark because of that very long simmer, allowing the butter to extract more of everything including chloro.  It looks like you did everything fine. And the fact is that the butter isnt yellow but green already tells you got you something in it. All you have to do is find that dosage spot that works best for you!  Just use it as you would with any recipe that needs fats.  Congratz!"
treedibles,31ghbz,MaapuSeeSore,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:16:36 2015 UTC,You didn't decarb first?  It's probably not that potent
treedibles,31ghbz,The-Pussy-Whisperer,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:10:47 2015 UTC,"That's my fear, but I feel like the logic of 7 hours simmering decarbing the bud makes sense."
treedibles,31ghbz,The-Pussy-Whisperer,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:42:57 2015 UTC,Did you test it yet??
treedibles,31excp,nonzeroa,2,Sat Apr 4 12:36:49 2015 UTC,Yes. The THC needs time to bind with the fats. This is separate from the time it takes to decarb.
treedibles,31excp,derps-a-lot,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:18:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Simmering Three hours should be good? I plan on ""washing"" the butter another two times after the butter is made to remove unwanted tastes."
treedibles,31excp,theghostofkurtcobain,3,Sat Apr 4 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"I use coconut oil, but did the same simmer time and it always turned out good.  Then I read, and tried it, to freeze it for 2.5 hours after the simmer.  After 2.5 hrs simmer it again for 3 hours.  That way came out fantastic.  Oh and get yourself some soy lichten (in granular form) because that stuff helps out alot ive found too.  And always decarb."
treedibles,31excp,prang_interpreter,2,Sat Apr 4 14:38:26 2015 UTC,"i really want to try the freeze and cook again method, you say it was a lot stronger? when i started using decarbed bud and lecithin it took my edibles up a notch for sure, so i'm hoping this would be another improvement."
treedibles,31excp,theghostofkurtcobain,3,Sat Apr 4 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"yeah, my friends all said the batch with the freeze were better and Ive had no complaints before.  I am going to keep doing it this way."
treedibles,31excp,boogey_bogey,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:48:01 2015 UTC,What does the soy lecithin do?
treedibles,31excp,derps-a-lot,6,Sat Apr 4 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"Lecithin itself is just an emulsifier. Lots of it found in soy and eggs. Helps your body break down fats for faster absorption.  I add it to caps, but omit when baking since chances are I'm adding eggs anyway."
treedibles,31excp,theghostofkurtcobain,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"Im not totally sure, I think it helps in the binding process of the THC to the oil/butter fats."
