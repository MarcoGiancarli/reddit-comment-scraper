You could buy her gift cards to a salon if she's into that, or classes for healthy cooking lessons, or a new video game, or have her go out with the girls, it really depends on what she's comfortable with, I think support is more important than rewards, because feeling healthier and having those clothes get looser and looser is so rewarding"

But honestly, if you were to participate in healthy-living activities (exercise, cooking classes, grocery shopping, etc) that would do so much more for her. That is, if you're not already doing this of course. It's really hard to stay motivated when everyone around you is on a different page.

motivation,3dka41,metallichondaman,4,Thu Jul 16 23:18:06 2015 UTC,"Ooh! Let me answer this! This actually happened to me.  In October of 2012 my wife asked me to carve a pumpkin for her pre-K class. She didn't ask me to do it because I had any aptitude or experience with carving or sculpting--she just didn't want to do it. Figuring there had to be a better way of carving a pumpkin than the triangular-eyed, gap-toothed jack 'o lantern technique that everybody knows, I googled pumpkin carving. It was amazing how far artists like Jon Neill, Scott Cummins, and Ray Villafane had taken the medium.   That first pumpkin I carved was not the stuff of carving legends, but it wasn't bad for a beginner I guess. What it lacked in grandiosity it more than made up for in potential and motivation. Something about subtractive sculpture just . . . clicked with me.   After that point, an obsession with carving took over my thoughts. Just about all I thought about was carving and teaching myself how to carve and where carving might lead me. I managed to carve three or four pumpkins that year and then after pumpkin season was over I carved some of the gigantic carrots the sushi restaurant I used to work at would get, and then I moved on to carving candles into Buddhas and styrofoam blocks.  In April of 2013 my friend and neighbor gave me a piece of firewood from his firewood pile to carve. I took the inexpensive dremel tool I bought to carve styrofoam blocks with and worked on that piece of firewood for four months in my spare time. I'm sure friends and family thought I had gone a little crazy to spend the time and energy I spent learning this stuff but that's only because they couldn't see two years into the future like I could at the time. They only saw the sawdust and I only saw the piece of fine art coming out of that piece of wood. In the end I suppose I was right because That first wood carving sold for $1000 before I was even finished with it.  But there's only so far I could take this carving thing by carving small pieces, so my aim turned towards carving the biggest pieces I could. To do that I would need to use a chainsaw. Also, I would need to learn how to use one.   Being a dirt-poor restaurant worker for two decades did little to prepare me for a career in the art world. I had no training or experience with any of this stuff. In fact, I had never even used a chainsaw in my life until I bought one to carve with. Objectively what I did was pretty stupid.   But Instead of going on a nice weekend vacation or buying some new shoes I took that money and used it to fund my initial investment in chainsaw carving.  And it was the smartest investment I ever made.  Nobody really gives a shit if you can carve a pumpkin but if you can turn a tree stump into a neighborhood landmark then people will pay you for it.  In October of 2012 I found my true calling.  In October of 2013 I sold my first piece and vowed that I would make my living by carving. The goal I set for myself was to be fully self-employed in two years time. I am proud to say this goal was met seven months ahead of schedule. I have left my shitty job and I now carve stuff for a living. Hell yeah.  Art Hard, J  Pumpkins:  http://imgur.com/a/udeDE  Wood:  http://imgur.com/a/vEvSh"

motivation,3ceiul,LethargicSuccubus,0,Tue Jul 7 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"Fat shaming annoys me. I am by no measure overweight and I work out daily, but I don't think overeating is the problem people have. Overeating is a symptom. It can be caused by poor education, by poor habits learned in childhood, by poverty since unhealthy foods are cheaper, by clinical depression.  Shaming people and telling them that they need to eat less won't solve the problem. Overweight people are people, and people are different. Each person will need his or her own approach.  Overeating to me looks more like an addiction than simply self-indulgence. It is a perverse addiction, because you can't simply cut the substance - people need to eat or they die. I think it should be treated like an addiction, as a mental health issue, by mental health professionals.  EDIT: clarification."

Also I'm pretty sure smashing makeup and chemicals on her face won't help.   Perhaps she should eat really good food, get her weight up and get outside and exercise?

motivation,3bdgom,DaChodemasters,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:16:58 2015 UTC,"My single mother, at age 40, went back to school to become a teacher.  She worked, took care of a family and managed to get a Master's Degree in Education.  Today at age 80, she is retired with a pension and still gets cards and calls from former students.    Because I had seen it done, I went back to college at age 29 and got a doctorate level degree.  I was married, working and our first child was born two years into my education.  I now spend my working days helping people in a very real and tangible way.    There's always time at your age, but start now, do something, anything to get moving toward a goal, any goal.  A favorite proverb of mine, from the Chinese - The longest journey begins with a single step.  Every step matters, the first as much as the last.  I also have a question I have often asked my kids as they were growing up that helps illustrate this point  ""How do you eat an Elephant?""  Answer: ""One bite at a time""  You have the time, 24 hours a day just as Einstein, Helen Keller, Mother Theresa and Mark Cuban had to get done what needs to be done.  You have the ability, or you can develop it, and you have or can find the resources.  The question and the point where the rubber meets the road is, will you DECIDE to start?  Start the process, trust the process and enjoy the journey.  You may not end up where you started for, but you will end up somewhere other than where you are right now, and somewhere else may be just where you need to be.  Hope this helps.  Edit: Spelling"
