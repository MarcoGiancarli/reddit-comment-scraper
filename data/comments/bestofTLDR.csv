So about a month back I was getting pretty bored of the same routine of jerking it my hands and cleaning up with a sock. I knew that I was missing out and the clean up was just such a hassle. The idea of a fleshlight was so appealing, but as a poor college student living at home I didn't want to shell out the cash and couldn't even contemplate how to get it delivered to me. So one day whilst being a stoner with a boner I decided to try my hand at making my own fleshlight, after a bit of googling I found one that only needed one cup, two sponges, a latex glove and some lotion. This thing was amazing, definitely a game changer. It felt way better and the cleanup was super easy. All I would do was remove the latex glove and toss it out. One enthusiastic thumb up, it should be two but the other hand was busy. After I while however I got lazy and would just toss my jizz filled contraption under my bed and would replace when I needed to.    I was living the dream. That was until me and my family went on a weekend trip to Portland. See my Nana lives just a mile away from my house and when we go on trips like this she is more than happy to watch our dogs for us. But being a grandma she will sometimes go above and beyond. I absent mindedly forgot about her grandmotherly tendencies and when I got back and walked into my room and found it looking like a god damn Marriott instead of the usual shit hole my heart sunk. I immediately dropped to the floor and investigated under my bed. I couldn't find it so I decided to check my dishwasher to see if the cup was sitting in there clean but when I walked out of my room I saw it; on a desk across the room was the cup with the sponges, and in between the sponges were about 5 latex gloves because over the course of a month I had gotten so lazy I would toss those under my bed as well instead of waking the ten feet to my trash can. I know she knew, there is no denying that. I think that's why she didn't throw the gloves away so that I knew she knew. Now I'm laying in my bed planning on never looking my grandma in the eye ever again.    TL;DR: Fucked SpongeBob's asshole and my Nana found out.

This isn't your regular clean, tap water, but it's just a measurement of how much water a cow puts through its system in its lifetime. They don't go into your house to drink fifteen thousand gallons of tap water but they get it from grass, rivers, streams. Also, even if they did get their water supply from your clean, filtered tap water, there's still no fucking way of just transporting that water to someone in need half a world ago. If you wanna help people in need, go help devise new ways of helping impoverished people, but don't connect excessive water wasting like you're literally stealing water from the poor."
bestofTLDR,3cxihy,shutta,6,Sat Jul 11 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"Was thinking this also. Some group of people where I live are protesting a nestle water bottling plant saying it is taking from the reservoirs. Mind you, if they really cared to think, they would realize that it uses so little water year round that it would take almost 2200 years (or 72 seconds flow of the river the lake flows into) to use the same amount that the city uses in a day. In that same respect... the ranches are often not depriving any other places of water. And what do you know? Water replenishes!  As for using that water for the poor around the world... Is it worth spreading that much pollution through bunker and ballast water to get hardly anything to them? It works in a pinch but is no long term plan."

The poster thought it'd be funny if he sent one such message to the Boss (""World's biggest cocksucker"" or something to that effect), but he fucked up and wrote his personal info as the recipient, so when Boss got the potato, he automatically knew who sent it.

The OP then proceeded to coach a different player in how to better play the game. The first player, who had earned his rank through deceptive means, told the second one, who was being coached, that they were bad at the game. The OP then told the person that he was coaching about how he had helped the first player, in essence, to cheat. Hell broke loose."

bestofTLDR,34ec24,SakunaM,20,Thu Apr 30 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah so this happened about a year ago. My wife and I have two kids, a 4 year old daughter and a 1 year old son. We do not have any family nearby and we don’t really have a babysitter, so we never get to go out. One day I’m bitching about this at work to a new hire (Jen) and she says loves kids and would love to babysit one night. I jump on it, and we set a date for Friday and I make plans to take the misses to some fancy steakhouse that recently opened downtown.  Since we never go out I decided to go a little overboard and I order two bottles of very fancy ass wine right off the bat. Now my wife is really not much of a drinker so I basically polish off two bottles of vino by myself. Needless to say, I was pretty hammered. By the time we get home it’s pretty late, and Jen asks if she can sleep on the couch, which is fine, and I go to bed. This I where my memory ends. At roughly 3:30 the next morning, I wake my wife up and hand her my 1 year old son, who is obviously in some sort of distress. He is soaking wet and crying. She thinks that maybe he just wet himself and got upset but as she begins to change him she’s notices that his diaper is dry as a bone, and only his clothes are soaked. She also notices that he distinctly smells like urine. The next morning as I lay in bed horribly hungover, Jen mentions to my wife that she saw me stumble into the kids’ room, and heard me “urinating”.  She has never offered her babysitting services to us again.  TL;DR Got really drunk and pissed all over my 1 year old, in his crib, instead of the toilet.  Edit: Wow, some interesting comments. To all the nice folks who think I am an alcoholic, child abuser, I promise you I'm not. (Editor's Note: That is exactly what an alcoholic, child abuser would say.)  Edit2: Just to clarify, this is not a regular thing. Besides this event the last time I pissed on something was during college (10+ years ago), so don't get too worried about me. Also, I have another child that I have never once pissed on, and shes been around for 5 years."

She was also completely fucking crazy. This one time she decided she wanted to dye her eyebrows purple, so she starts on one eyebrow. Then she decides she doesn't want purple eyebrows, so she stops halfway through. By ""halfway though"", of course, I mean she has one purple eyebrow. So she walks around with one purple eyebrow for a few days. Then she decides she doesn't want to have one purple eyebrow. To solve this problem, her solution is to shave off her purple eyebrow. Not shave both eyebrows and just draw them on or whatever girls do. She shaves one and just does her thing with one normal colored eyebrow and one skin colored bald patch where the purple eyebrow used to be.  I was crazy about her though. She had really deep insights into things. (in retrospect, the things she had deep insights into weren't very deep.)"

This actually happened last night at round 11:30PM.  Me and my significant other have been exploring our sexual boundaries with one-another. He purchased a nice glass butt-plug for us to experiment with together and some coconut oil to use as lube. So here we are about to experiment with the plug. We get everything ready. we lay a sheet on the bed so as to not leave any oil stains on the sheets, he pulls out the oil and starts massaging my asshole and preparing me for our glass device.  Suddenly i feel like i need to fart REALLY BAD. I tell him this and he stops and we lay there for a moment waiting for me to fart. This was one stubborn fart that would not leave my anus and instead decided to go higher into my intestines (or so i thought), so I give him the green light to continue. He oils me up some more and adds a little spit for extra lubrication and started to work the plug in and out slowly working my asshole. There is still no sensation or >feeling that I need to fart by this point.  I roll over and now we are in the missionary position. The added pressure from the plug and being double penetrated makes me forget about my gassy sensation earlier. He starts making circular penetration movements by gyrating his hips and that puts me over the edge. I can feel myself reaching climax when suddenly PFFFFT POP! The pressure from him being inside me and from him being on top of me to not only fart but to shoot the plug out of my anus like a 'Fart rocket'! We both couldn't help but laugh hysterically and the laughing made HIM fart as well! so here I am all oiled up and hot and bothered rolling around laughing with him for the next few minutes.  TLDR; Felt like I had to fart, Thought it receded, Blew my cork."

bestofTLDR,2x8ctq,ergman,57,Thu Feb 26 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"That was me.  Here is what I wrote:  I usually just lurk, but I think it is time I told this story to someone.  This happened last year right after I got divorced.  My brother had just moved in with me, to help me after my divorce. He noticed how lonely I was and suggested online dating. I had been married for 9 years, and I had heard about it, but never participated. At the time I was only 29, so finding someone around my age should be easy. So I signed up for a popular site, perfected my profile, and started navigating my way through the endless women in my city. Things were going well, I talked to a few nice girls, but none of them really seemed like someone I would really want to meet in person. And in all honestly, I was really nervous to meet someone on the internet in person, so getting the courage to ask was the tough part for me.  Soon after, I though I might be moving out of state, so I started looking in the new state, so maybe if I found someone, we could talk and get to know each other before I got there. I instantly found a very attractive girl, that actually went to the same college as I did, and I wrote her. We hit it off instantly. We talked for a few weeks, and things were going great. Then, she dropped it on me. She had a boyfriend. But, they have been interested in having another man join them in the bedroom, and if I was into it, they would love to have me. Now, I had been married for 9 years, since I was 20. I didn't have any crazy sexual experiences before or during marriage, so after thinking about it, I decided that I need to go out and just do something crazy and out of my comfort zone. So I wrote her, and I accepted the offer. I said that I will be in her city in a few weeks for an interview, and I would love to get together. She was excited, sent me a mild dirty picture, and couldn't wait to meet me.  A few days go by, and this girl texts me that her boyfriend would be coming to my city for a business trip this weekend, she was coming with him, and that maybe we could meet up and have some fun. Hell yeah! I hadn't been laid since the divorce, and I was ready. They got in that Thursday, and she texted me as soon as they landed.  ""We're here! Would you want to come by the hotel tonight and meet my boyfriend so he can approve? I know he will love you!""  Not a problem. I tell my brother what is going down, and tell him if he doesn't hear from me in a few hours, to call. Again, I am super nervous. Not only is this the first time I am meeting a girl I met online, it is a threesome.  I head to the hotel, which is about 25min away. I get there, text the girl, and wait in the lobby. No response. I wait like 5 min and text again. Nothing. I am freaking out inside, but trying to play it cool in case she or he comes down. 10 minutes go by and I am about to leave. I am about to walk out, and she texts me.  Come to room XXX. whew. So I go.  I knock on the door and a handsome guy answers. ""Hi, I am So_wat_r_u_wearing"" I say with a smile.  ""Oh, hey, come on in!""  I look around and there is no girl in sight, so I ask, ""where is so-and-so?""  ""She walked down to the gas station so you and I could get to know each other."" Ok, I thought, seems fair.  So I walk in, and he stats that I am attractive, and that this should be really fun. I am feeling a little more at ease.  Then, he asks a question I didn't understand, but knew what the hell he was talking about. ""So, you wanna size up?"" Um, what?! Size up? He wants me to whip my dick out right now, and compare it to his, doesn't he?  ""I can throw some porn on so we can get hard, and then size up.""  I cannot emphasize how inexperienced I am at this sort of thing, so I think it is normal. Not normal for me, but for people that do these things. So I agree.  Dude busts out his laptop, which was preloaded with multiple videos ready to go. He tells me to make myself comfortable, watch, and get hard. So I do. He comes over to the bed I am sitting on, and sits next to me, dick in hand. I am so uncomfortable, that getting hard wasn't even an option. He looks over, and says, ""You OK?"" I nod in agreement. Well, do you want to size up? ""um, sure..."" So I pull it out, a little chub.  ""Do you want some lube?"" he asked. I say yes... which seems fucking retard now, but in the moment felt like the right thing to do, as it might help speed up the ""sizing up"" process, and get this girl in here to start the actual reason I was there.  He gets up, goes to his suitcase that was in the closet, and comes back, repositioning himself next to me. I am still sitting there, pants around my thighs, holding myself. He places a small amount of lube in his hand closest to me. I am thinking that he is getting some for himself, and then will hand me the small bottle. Nope. He puts the bottle down, reaches over, and starts to stoke me before I can even comprehend what the fuck is happening. He tells me how nice my junk is, and how so-and-so will love it inside of her. I have NO idea what to do. I didn't want to stop him abruptly, as 1. he has my dick firmly in his hand, and 2. i didn't come this far to scare him off and not be able to get some from so-and-so.  So I ask, ""when is so-and-so coming back?""  ""Oh, she is not coming back right now, tonight is just so you and I can get to know each other. Tomorrow is when we will have some real fun! So, are you close to getting off?""  WHAT THE FUCK?!  ""No.... I am not going to get off! I am straight. I am here for her, and I don't mind you and I doing anything with her here, but not alone!"" I stand up, pull my pants up, and tell him ""listen, I am more than willing to do anything with her in the room, but there is no way that just you and I are doing this. She is here right?"" He affirms his story of her being out for a walk to the gas station until he calls her.  So I say thanks, and that I will see him tomorrow. I quickly leave, go to the lobby and search around for this girl I had become so familiar with for the last few weeks. Not there. So I walk outside, and around the building. No one. I then get in my truck and start driving towards the gas station, looking around to see if I can at least see her that way I know she is here, and exists. I texted her about meeting her boyfriend, and that I would see her tomorrow. Nothing. I continued to drive around near the hotel, just to catch a glimpse. Still nothing. It is starting to sink in.... This guys is sick. He baited me into this. I just got jerked by a guy. WTF?!  I finally go home, and tell my brother. He is laughing hysterically. I mean I would laugh at him too if it had happened to him.  I couldn't sleep that night. I ended up going to work early just to end these thoughts in my head.  Finally, ""she"" texted me. ""We are leaving (my city) early, sorry, maybe next time"" and I never heard from ""her"" again.  TL;DR Met a girl online in person. He jerked me off."

This led OP to consider telling them that they should give her custody of the child, because K had told her before she died that she wanted her to be the custodian, but nothing was ever put on paper. Another reason for her to be the custodian would be that, aside from L's great-grandparents and a 20-year-old aunt, L doesn't have any other family.

bestofTLDR,2rfwhz,Wiinsomniacs,24,Tue Jan 6 01:29:45 2015 UTC,"Dammit, hate it when that happens.  Here's the saved text:   So...  some background::  Me and my sister became close after our parents died. Her boyfriend and I have become pretty good work out training partners and her and my wife get along really well. We often do double dates or couple things, just generally hang out alot together.  We are hanging out this morning and because of both my work, and her boyfriend's (lets call him Andrew) work we cant watch football on sunday. So we have gotten in the ritual of watching the taped games on monday, as we are both off. (on a side note my sister and wife both have jobs that allow them to be home most days, my sister works over night and my wife is a personal chef)  My sisters apartment,and therefore her kitchen, is a little small, so she uses the top of her kitchen cabinets as additional 'shelving'. (her cabinets stop and there is about a 8 inch gap between them and the ceiling which she uses as additional storage space.)  Andrew runs out on a last minute food / beer run. I am in the kitchen of my sisters apartment making fresh salsa. My sister climbs on top of the counter to grab the big party chip bowls from the top of the cabinets. Her hands are now full, Andrew is at the store and im in the kitchen so she asks me to help her down. I've been making salsa so my hands are covered in tomato gunk and without even thinking about it, I turn around and position one hand near the back of her leg so she doesnt walk off the counter and the other hand i go to grab her elbow, as she leans back to step down, my slippery hand lose grip and right up her skirt, where for god only knows why shes not wearing underwear. Somehow, OF COURSE a few of my fingers slide right up into her. Im completely frozen in shock but have no idea what to do. Before I do anything she freak outs drops the glass bowls trying to 'adjust' herself. With one hand Im trying to holding her up like a freaking puppet, and the other hand instinctively lets go to catch the bowls. As I let go of her she basically shifts herself, I lose my grip and drop her, she falls off the counter and slams her head against the corner of the stove where she falls on the floor knocked out cold with a big gash on her head.  My wife freaks out runs in, calls an ambulance, and Andrew meets us at the hospital, where she got 10 stitches and had a concussion. We both agreed that this was to not be discussed, and I havent been able to look her in the face all day.  FML, and salsa....  TL:DR I fingered my sister, then dropped her on the head.  EDIT 1 : Im not sure why she didnt have underwear on. But it seems quite a few female redditors have chimed in stating they also dont wear underwear sometimes even while wearing dress/skirts.  EDIT 2 : Im assuming she fergot she wasnt wearing underwear / simply wasnt thinking about it / figured everyone was busy and no one was going to notice / no one was purposely going to look- her skirt was long enough where i would have had to be like directly under her to notice, and got up on the counter because I was busy and 'Andrew' was not home. Usually, because both of us (Me or 'Andrew') are significantly taller then her we get the stuff down.  EDIT 3 : Alot of people seem to think the story is untrue, which i promise it isint (which i guess i would say regardless i suppose), just a horrible set of circumstances and bad luck. I merely thought that for once i had something to share and contribute on reddit rather then just lurking.  Edit 4/5 : The salsa wasn't really salsa yet, i was only cutting tomatoes at this point. And for those who are asking if shes ok, the answer is yes seems so. The doctor said it was mild but it would be best to have someone with her for a few days, and get lots of rest.  EDIT 6: for those who are sort of confused i will try to elaborate best I can as to exactly what happened. My sister is 5'3 ish or so im estimating, my wife is 5'1 and my sister is slightly taller. Im 5'8-5'9ish. Shes wearing a skirt about just above knee length. The counter comes up to my upper thigh area. (her hip area or so). She climbs onto the counter, but after she gets the bowls her hands are full. Because the kitchen is small the counters are not very big so theres not much room to move around. When i was helping her i had one hand like her elbow/ under arm area, one hand was kind of behind her, like knee ish area kind of just to prevent her from completely walking off the counter. while standing up on the counter, her skirt still came to like my mid chest area, it wasnt a short skirt, and as i said, unless i was like crouched down under her no one was going to see up her skirt to begin with. I was under the assumption she was gonna kinda like lean down a bit and jump off, and i only needed to really make it so she didnt lose her balance. But when she leaned back like it was going to be some weird trust excersice or something i went to grab her leg and things got really awkward."

Besides, like you said, that particular subreddit does generate a large amount of content, most of which (in my opinion) is quality and enjoyable.  Banning it would definitely cause this subreddit to lose a lot of activity, which I'm sure nobody wants.  For the time being, I think your personal best course of action would simply be to downvote submissions from /r/tifu and ignore them.

If the regulars of a subreddit (numerically fewer than casual visitors) need to enforce a rule, they must do it outside the downvote/upvote system. That's why subreddits have rules and moderators in the first place. Simply put, an automated system can be beaten by numbers, and only manual intervention keeps things as desired.  What I'm not meaning is that the sub should cater to me specifically; rather, that we should probe and see if there's a sufficiently large mass of people who think the same as I do.  So far, what I can glean from the responses is that some people acknowledge the detrimental effects, but they would rather not throw the baby out with the water, so to speak. That's fine."

Over time, the submissions from /r/TIFU have been growing and growing, even matching the number submitted from /r/AskReddit.  Of course, what action can be taken? Do we be like /r/bestof and ban certain reddits? More constructive comments and discussions on the TL;DRs themselves? Do we form, or have someone form an entirely new subreddit - /r/bestofTIFU and /r/bestofTIFUTLDR spring to mind - to handle the content? Honestly, I don't know.

When you shoot a rocket at it, it is a wasted life.  ncat.org estimates ca. 550 lb. of usable meat from an average slaughtered cow - even if you figure it's some skinny SE Asian animal, it's still enough to feed a lot of people.  Not to mention the wasted potential milk, or if you slaughter it anyway, the hide and other parts that could have been used.  I have no ethical or moral problems with slaughtering animals for food or other productive uses, but we are well capable of ensure that (a) they don't suffer while they live, (b) they don't suffer when dying, and (c) they don't die pointlessly.  This is fucking stupid."

Men and women (in vast generality) do seem to be somewhat at odds in how they perceive and react to things. I must admit that (to my shame) I have been in a similar situation as that guy before. What we've been taught from a very young age is that perseverance is important, but often we're not taught where the line is between perseverance and ""being creepy"". And, honestly, while this guy genuinely does seem like a douche who is only interested in the boyfriend's feelings, I can also understand why he did what he did.  How many times do you see things in movies about girls who are ""playing hard to get"" or genuinely just flat out ""not interested"", who after a few months or years change their mind and get together with a guy because he wouldn't ""give up on her""? It's only when you realise that you might be fucking up a relationship between two people, and not just trying to ""persuade someone"" to like you that you think about what's actually going on."

I've been in her shoes lots of times, so I'm pretty sympathetic to her situation.  Here's my view: what Mike did is straight up stalking. Tracking her down on multiple social media platforms is not romantic. At all. It's bizarre behavior, and honestly, did he see that she had a boyfriend when he stalked her Facebook?  I can't understand why this guy did what he did. Personally, I think it's very creepy if a guy persists to ask me out or contact me after I've expressed disinterest and stopped responding. I'm not sure why anyone of any gender would think that's a socially acceptable move to ignore her words and continue on.  What I think the take-home message for guys who have been tagged as ""creepy"" is that if she says she's not interested, stop asking. If you continue to be your usual awesome and she later changes her mind, well you can proceed from there if you feel like it. If she never changes her mind, you won't notice. Don't waste time and effort on women who  are not receptive of your attention."
