tarantulas,3e2lc3,TwangBanger,4,Tue Jul 21 15:49:40 2015 UTC,fuck i think you are right. I was prodding it thinking it was dying. I feel bad now but im going to leave it alone. I guess this is a Molt post now XD  *yep i see the molt inside the tunnel. Last time s/he left it outside.
tarantulas,3e2lc3,loginyousay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:54 2015 UTC,"Don't feel too bad, it's going to get over it pretty soon :-)   Especially with the first few T's I think everybody is scared/worries easily when something is different or seems unusual. I'm definitely guilty of having scared some peacefully sleeping T's to make sure they're not dead/dying because they looked weird."
tarantulas,3e2lc3,nyxin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:58 2015 UTC,"Slings man, slings. When I first got them I was always so worried about when they were about to molt. One time I had 4 refusing to eat for a few weeks straight. That was fun. Now it seems like every other week I find one that just go ahead and molts without warning. Wake up, well, I guess another one molted."
tarantulas,3e0r4l,Sweetsmyle,5,Tue Jul 21 01:53:56 2015 UTC,"There's something warm and comforting about a log sporting disembodied legs. OBTs are awesome and yours appears to fit the bill, but I'm only judging seven legs and the spider-abyss. How is the demeanor so far?"
tarantulas,3e0r4l,Nature_Lizard_Milk,2,Tue Jul 21 04:41:41 2015 UTC,Fairly calm comparatively from what I've heard. He/she did attack the paint brush when we went to rehouse him/her (was just in a deli cup that was just way too small). He/she's been out a bit after finding and webbing the hide. Let me get open the cage to get a better picture. No hissing or threat posturing. He/she did tear apart all the webbing on the hide today though to get at a cricket. That was fun to watch.
tarantulas,3e0r4l,Nature_Lizard_Milk,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:43:18 2015 UTC,"That orange fluff is too cute. I'd heard they were actively defensive (I'll call it that instead of aggression), but it wouldn't stop me from keeping one in the future, after I level my experience."
tarantulas,3e0r4l,ThisIsMyRedditLogin,4,Wed Jul 22 03:28:28 2015 UTC,"I recently got an OBT too, and a similar log hide as the OP.  I rarely see the OBT as she spends most of her time under her log.  I know she goes wandering at night though because there's always a fresh pile of dirt in her water dish."
tarantulas,3e0r4l,ThisIsMyRedditLogin,2,Tue Jul 21 08:35:15 2015 UTC,Mine seems to like to wander at night too. But I like to check on them before I go to bed so I was able to get a better picture.
tarantulas,3e0r4l,Shroom_lord,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:54:29 2015 UTC,That's a nice looking OBT.
tarantulas,3e0r4l,radiumcandy,2,Wed Jul 22 08:28:59 2015 UTC,Very nice! Looks like a beautiful T!

tarantulas,3dzxp7,t0xic4ttraction,4,Mon Jul 20 21:59:34 2015 UTC,"That substrate looks very moist, be careful as too high moisture can be harmful.   The legpsan rule is that the longest side of the enclosure should ideally be around 3x the diagonal legspan (the tip of one leg to the tip of the opposite leg).   Also, don't bother with the paper town. Like i said, it already looks like the substrate is way overmoistened and paper towls will just get moldy."
tarantulas,3dzxp7,r4cid,2,Mon Jul 20 23:20:23 2015 UTC,"I stick a small paper-towel square in there for the moister sometimes, I know I need a little bigger holes :p. I am wondering when to move her to a bigger home though. I don't understand the leg span rule, does it mean one leg? Or from one side of the tip of a leg, to the other?"
tarantulas,3dzxp7,nyxin,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:35 2015 UTC,"I've been keeping my spiderlings in these tiny boxes (they measure out to be about 3""x2""x2"") and they seam to work out for me a lot better than the pill bottles. I could never quite get the ventilation right on those no matter how many holes I had in them at any size.  They're incredibly cheap easy to construct, and I haven't had an issue with moisture of ventilation in awhile since I've started using them. I found them at staples for like $3 a pop. You can also find similar amac boxes which a a bit clearer online as well which I might try the next round of slings I get.  As for when to rehouse them from the pill bottle, I would say when the leg span is getting close to the actual width of the bottle at the latest, but if you are going to set it up in a ""sling enclosure"" similar to mine, do it as soon as you can so you don't go through all the same issues I had with moisture and mold in the pill bottles.  Good luck. =)"
tarantulas,3dyboy,radiumcandy,3,Mon Jul 20 15:08:50 2015 UTC,Pretty badass to molt upside down in the water like that.  You better keep an eye on that tarantula.  It has plans.
tarantulas,3dyboy,north49er,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"Do you think she really molted in the full water dish? If so, does that mean I'm doing something wrong with her humidity? I water the substrate once a week and keep her water dish full..."
tarantulas,3dyboy,north49er,3,Mon Jul 20 18:45:29 2015 UTC,"Nah- just cracking a joke that apparently missed the target a little bit.  It's far more likely your T molted near the dish, where the humidity was most comfortable for the process, and flipped the exuvium off into the dish when the process was complete.  One tip about watering the substrate, though.  Make sure you're letting it dry out a good bit between waterings.  If it never gets a chance to dry out, you're likely to pick up mold before too long."
tarantulas,3dyboy,north49er,2,Mon Jul 20 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"Ahaha, sorry. My worried spider mom mentality got the better of me there.  I do a sniff/dipstick test before watering, and both of my enclosures have copious side ventilation."
tarantulas,3dyboy,loginyousay,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're on top of things, then.  Good luck with your little blue predator!"
tarantulas,3dyboy,loginyousay,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:06 2015 UTC,She most likely didn't molt in there. Probably molted on a nice mat in her burrow and just cleaned up/kicked the molt out! Very nice of her to leave it in such a good condition :-)
tarantulas,3dyboy,umfrot,2,Mon Jul 20 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"You can't tell from the pic because I am the anti-photographer, but her little pink horror heart mouth and fangs were remarkably well-preserved. I really wouldn't like to be bitten by her, even excluding the potent venom!  Now I really want to know what she looks like after the molt, but not enough to mess with her."
tarantulas,3dyboy,MrDaveW,2,Mon Jul 20 19:59:26 2015 UTC,I know you say she/her but is it actually sexed yet? Depending on size you might have a good chance! If you carefully open it up so you can see the book lungs :-)  She'll eventually get hungry and come out. Feeding your T a little less (they can handle it and I think it's actually more natural) will cause it to be hungry and out in the open more often. They are more willing to take risks if they're not fully stuffed.
tarantulas,3dyboy,JedNascar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's really little - I call it a her and my A. geroldi a he out of ""prescience."" Probably way too tiny without a microscope - the molt is about 1""."
tarantulas,3dyboy,MrDaveW,2,Mon Jul 20 23:04:42 2015 UTC,"She's been acting pre-molt-y for a couple of weeks, but since she spends all her time in her very-heavily-webbed-over burrow, I figured I wouldn't know for sure any time soon. So good of her to put it right in the water dish!"
tarantulas,3dyboy,JedNascar,3,Mon Jul 20 15:11:07 2015 UTC,"Always a pleasant surprise, better than have to wait for your next cleanup to dig it out of her burrow, did she molt on the water dish or did she throw it out?  Also take pictures of her once she's out of her burrow!"
tarantulas,3dyboy,JedNascar,3,Mon Jul 20 15:54:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know, actually - I just found it in the water dish this morning. I spent most of yesterday in bed sick, so she could very well have done it all in the water dish without my noticing. It was full, though.  But yeah, I have 0 desire to go digging in her burrow. Now that I've seen how fast she moves, there aren't forceps long enough in existence to make that enjoyable!"
tarantulas,3dyboy,umfrot,3,Mon Jul 20 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"Thats not how it works. The spider leaves the molt in the dish, and the molt fairy takes it and leaves a cricket or roach in its place."
tarantulas,3dyboy,JedNascar,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"Well, what do I get out of the agreement then?"
tarantulas,3e0vp6,spedyrf,3,Tue Jul 21 02:30:59 2015 UTC,"Individuals may vary and I can only speak from experience. Very small slings (especially terrestrials) are way more likely to burrow than bigger Ts.   L.parahybana, makes nice burrows but is always out. Mine even molts outside.  A.geniculate, very self confident. Mine spent some time burrowed within the first instars but since about 1cm BL they're always outside. Avicularia spp., makes beautiful webs and are out all the time. May only be hard to see them when they've webbed up their whole enclosure.  Brachypelma spp, the slings do spend a lot of time burrowed but my bigger ones, about 2cm and up are always outside and don't even burrow.   Depending on how much/how often you feed, you could try to feed a little less. A hungry T is more likely to take the risk of being outside."
tarantulas,3e0vp6,loginyousay,3,Tue Jul 21 07:32:28 2015 UTC,Thanks! I guess I will probably go for an Avic next; they seem to have some excellent colors.
tarantulas,3e0vp6,loginyousay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:11 2015 UTC,No problem. They all have stunning colors (maybe except for A.laeta) and a great character! I love all of them but so far my A.diversipes sling has had the most interesting and widest range of color change with each molt.
tarantulas,3e0vp6,patchy_doll,2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:26 2015 UTC,"Seconding the LPara suggestion! I have two slings and they are the cheesiest, always put and ravenous, though manageable in speed and temperament."
tarantulas,3e0vp6,randomdrift0r,2,Tue Jul 21 22:11:50 2015 UTC,"C.cyaneopubescens (GBB) makes excellent display species in my experience. Always sits on top of her web or near to it. Plus they have stunning colours and are always hungry, making for an excellent display species .  I also like my X.Immanis due to excellent colours and a great appetite. It is however quite leggy (not good if you'd prefer a full bodied T) and may hide during the afternoon."
tarantulas,3e0vp6,patchy_doll,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"I love my GBB too, it's awesome to see how much webbing he does at night or when I'm at work - and the perpetual hunger never disappoints!"
tarantulas,3dzhuc,apussytera,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:36 2015 UTC,guess im just worried that I could have hurt the little t in the process
tarantulas,3dzhuc,nyxin,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:11 2015 UTC,I'm sure you didn't hurt it if all you did was destroy the web. C cyaneopubescens likes to web A LOT. I'm pretty sure all you did is give it an excuse to start building webs again. =)
tarantulas,3dzhuc,loginyousay,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:08 2015 UTC,"As long as you didn't physically squish the T it's going to be fine. They are after all wild animals and in the wild their webs get destroyed all the time. I've heard of people damaging webs on purpose to simulate this and to give the t something to do.   With misting it really depends on the species/individual but generally I would say there's no need to do it. Watering the substrate and maybe leaving a few drops on the side of the enclosure, on a piece of cork or the web is what I do, with the small ones I use a syringe."
tarantulas,3dzhuc,littlebidee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:43 2015 UTC,I accidentally dropped a mealworm right on top of my GBB slings web and when it squirmed it pulled everything apart. Poor little guy was frightened but nothing more really. I took out the mealworm and pushed whatever mess was left a little to one side. She's had no problem webbing over it/connecting the broken down webs and making a new web. Looks a bit cooler now actually. Gave it a more layered look.
