Remember that fish don’t breathe out of water. There's a right way to handle fish when out of water. In general, support the belly and the tail. Keep the body of the fish horizontal and near the water (to return it quickly). When returning the fish to water, hold it gently and upright, faced upstream in a slow current.

Portland,3e34p8,ororgtfo,14,Tue Jul 21 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"Chinook and Coho are stocked in Lake Michigan. There are self-sustaining stocks of pink salmon in Lake Superior. They were introduced to control the alewife populations, another exotic species. Alewives were so numerous that they'd die off by the billions and cover beaches. Their presence helps control alewife numbers and also has resulted in a vigorous sport fishing industry.  I've caught salmon in Michigan rivers. I don't know if they reproduce successfully on their own, but they go upriver during spawning time just like they do here."
Portland,3e34p8,modesty_blaise,5,Tue Jul 21 18:40:22 2015 UTC,"But they're not native to that area, we're were introduced artificially. People don't understand how hard it is for salmon to swim upstream, especially if you are from a flat area with no ocean."

Portland,3e34p8,Rick_Shasta,6,Tue Jul 21 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"I presumed by ""wild"" you meant a population that reproduces on its own with hatcheries. Pinks reproduce on their own. Kings and cohos do too, but not efficiently and they'd die out without hatcheries/stocking.  Steelhead are there too, and they reproduce on their own too.  If you mean by ""wild"" fish that are truly native and not introduced, the only wild salmonids are char, specifically brook trout and grayling. And grayling have been extinct in the Great Lakes for ~100 years."
Portland,3e34p8,duckduck_goose,4,Tue Jul 21 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"I doubt they're native, but they've introduced Atlantic, Coho and Chinook salmon.  I'm sure some of the fish get back to spawn every year.  So 'wild' but not wild I guess."

It all depends.  For-profit schools can also be a good thing if they generate competition that drives prices down. Instead I would argue that for-profit schools are easier to get into but are generally more expensive than public schools (and much less prestigious).  I tend to favor a more social approach where school is subsidized by the tax payers, but it has to be done right.

Portland,3e2rk3,thegrouchies,37,Tue Jul 21 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"That's a 6,700 square foot lot that is zoned R3.   That home is almost assuredly going to be torn down.   At .15 acres, they should be able to fit 2-3 homes on that site due to the higher density zoning.   The price here reflects the development potential.   To put it another way (assuming 3 dwellings are built):   $250k initial cost ~$80-90k in SDCs ~$7-15k in frontage and site improvements  ~$90-135k per dwelling unit constructed.    On the low end of the cost spectrum, you need to have at least ~$600,000 to develop this site at full density potential and if built out with premium finishes, or the site requires extra work/remediation it can get up to ~$760,000 to develop.   Look up the average price for an ~1,100 sqft condo/dwelling unit in that area and you can get an idea on ROI for the different development options for this site.   I'm seeing average prices of about $239/sqft, so I'll use that since this location will likely pull average at best.   That comes to a retail potential of ~$788,000.   It's unlikely these will be luxury condos in my quick guestimate scenario."

Portland,3e2rk3,mattpayne11,5,Tue Jul 21 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the 3.5%, but the 5% is just a standard loan.  You could go in and talk to a mortgage broker and see what they say.  It doesn't look like you need to be a 1st time buyer for an FHA loan.  It looks like there is a 3% down payment available through Fannie Mae and 0% if you are looking for an USDA area (suburban and rural).    Also, a ""first time buyer"" is anyone who hasn't owned in 3 years.  So, in 2 years you might magically be a first timer again!"

Portland,3e2rk3,epicrepairtime,-5,Tue Jul 21 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"Since this property was very likely a tear down, the ""scrap price"" is low-but with the zoning allowing higher density it is entirely possible that multiple developers got into a bidding war.   Realty is worth whatever the buyer spends, just like anything else  Think of it another way:  Right now, there are only about 6-8 lots within ~8-9 (thanks sc) miles of downtown that are under $100k. Most of them have development challenges and have been listed for a long time.   Would you pay $75k for a flat, buildable plot (with easy access to utilities), knowing that the average is closer to $100k?"
Portland,3e2rk3,salomoncascade,10,Tue Jul 21 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"Right now, there are only about 6-8 lots within ~15 miles of downtown that are under $100k.   Just curious here, honestly not trying to nitpick. But do you mean 6-8 lots for sale? Because I know you're well aware of my neighborhood is well within 15 miles of downtown and there are empty lots that I'm sure are valued under $100k (undeveloped land on a gravel road). I mean, hell, even this tiny teardown somehow only sold for $32k. It's obviously a unique scenario... I'm not even sure how you access it, but there's also stuff like this guy just sold a few months back for $75k. That one might even be liveable even if it is tiny."
Portland,3e2rk3,epicrepairtime,4,Tue Jul 21 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"I may have set the radius too high.   Downtown to 82nd (the real border for ""desirable"" currently) is only about 8-9 miles I suppose.   Basically, if you want to build inside the ""beltway"", you're going to spend over ~100k for most lots.   The market below that is very competitive and fast for relatively flat plots.   There are more sloped and challenging sites for under 100k than not.   I'll drop the radius."
Portland,3e2rk3,epicrepairtime,12,Tue Jul 21 17:42:16 2015 UTC,"Also, in '13 there were still a lot of people reeling from foreclosures (your 32k example was pretty common in that part of town even 2-3 years back).   If I had 300k to spend between '09 and '12-13, I'd be a VERY wealthy person right now.   The difference over the last couple of years is really tied to liquidity.   Lenders are back on board with development loans, and that makes a huge difference in the bottom of the market."

Portland,3e2rk3,Hopczar420,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"This home, judging by the photos, would likely struggle to get underwritten for lending (hence the low price).   Homepath is a type of loan where fixer/starters can be bought and improved by people. The catch is all the work has to be done by approved contractors and done according to the lender and program guidelines.   Initial price: $138k   Just off what I can see in the pics:   new roof and gutters: ~$18-22k siding repair and repainting: $9,500-12,000 interior remediation (can't tell, no inside pics-but the program requires everything to be brought to current code/working order)   Without knowing what the interior needs (could need wiring, furnace, appliances, flooring, wall or ceiling repair, dry rot remediation, mold remediation, etc) the house would cost between $165,500 to $172,000 finance via home path. Still quite affordable, but there could easily be another $10-20k in required work to qualify for homepath.   At the high side, this house gets up to $192k (assuming the inside matches the outside maintenance wise).   $192k is no longer an incredibly cheap home. Still cheaper than the replacement homes will be, but not nearly as cheap as the original price."
Portland,3e2rk3,epicrepairtime,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:08 2015 UTC,"new roof and gutters: ~$18-22k   Are you serious?  I'm looking at a new roof for my place that is somewhat similar and of the quotes I've got only one was close to 15k.  The one I'm thinking of going with is 8k.  Should I be concerned?

I won't spec lower end products or methods though.   8k is a very lean bid. I replaced the roof on one of my properties myself and spent ~$5,000 in materials alone, for a ~1,100 sqft home."

Portland,3e2rk3,epicrepairtime,9,Tue Jul 21 18:39:49 2015 UTC,"The estimate I'm looking at includes tear off of existing layers, install roof deck using CDX plywood, layer of underlayment, new drip and rake metal and starter course along perimeter, new exhaust vents and flashings, specifies 1 1/4 coil nails, 50 year shingles.  Should I be specifying those other things you mentioned?"
Portland,3e2rk3,Hopczar420,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"Thickness of plywood specified?  Does your home have a hip and valley roof?  Gutters? Fascia? Soffits? Lead paint related work (due to fascia and soffit)? Type of underlayment?  Basically, you've got your (seemingly narrower) scope, and are comparing it to another home with an entirely different (broader, as proposed by me) scope so the prices won't match up readily.   The length of the nails is important, but so is their composition. They are likely zinc electroplate, which is typical for coil nails and should hold up ok.   The 6 nail pattern I mentioned should be checked on (uses more nails and takes more time) because 40 year shingles are heavy and will perform best with the correct nail pattern for high wind zones.   An 8k bid is counting on a very quick job being done, and I'd be concerned about proper attention to detailing.   You mat get good value by increasing the scope with your low bidder-but if they do high volume, lower effort work then you may ask and pay for additional scope but not get it due to them being in a rush.   Also, what type and thickness of insulation do you have now?  Do you have soffit vents now?  Are they installing ridge vents?"
Portland,3e2rk3,Hopczar420,7,Tue Jul 21 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, as always you are a wealth of information.  It doesn't mention Fascia or Soffits or anything about paint nor the type of underlayment.

Portland,3e28m7,patrick38894,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"Comfortably Yum, they're one of the first to have done well in that cart for years.   And I highly recommend their hamburger and fries if you get the chance when they reopen. It's very fairly priced and is great quality. The fries are some of the best I've had.  Also, ran by a nice father and son operation with a friend (or two) who are always very courteous and friendly."

Portland,3e28m7,Panzr,7,Tue Jul 21 14:31:59 2015 UTC,The other day I walked past that building and I head them blasting Eye of the Tiger. I looked in the garage and they were all fake boxing and/or doing pushups. I think they were preparing for this.

As someone who has owned/operated/built/ several trucks and food trailers, I'm curious why you say they we all barely making it.  That place always had people there plus spillage from the couple bars in the area.  I'm just curious how someone couldn't make money there."
Portland,3e28m7,vetting_the_test,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:31 2015 UTC,Restaurant margins are low in general is what I meant.
Portland,3e28m7,Raxnor,5,Tue Jul 21 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough in a standard brick and mortar setting.  However, what many people don't realize is that an owner/operator of a food truck with one employee in a busy location will pocket an average of $350-500 daily, if not more.  It is actually very lucrative if you have your product dialed down and are in a a heavy pedestrian area."
Portland,3e28m7,vetting_the_test,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:47 2015 UTC,That's encouraging. Hopefully everyone bounces back.

It appears Rice & Noodle was the origin of the fire and it spread to some of the surrounding carts.  Note that Rice & Noodle's Exhaust Fan is missing, and I don't remember Fusion Box having one, so I'm pretty sure that's the Rice & Noodle fan on top of Fusion Box."

Notice that Rice & Noodle's Exhaust Fan is gone and the windows are shattered. Also, Krua, Rice & Noodle, and Comfortably Yum are the most damaged. Fusion Box and Phat Cart are barely hit, which would imply that the fire was in the middle, where Rice & Noodle is.  Disclaimer: Not a fire inspector."

Portland,3e28m7,plannersrule,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:54 2015 UTC,My money would be on Rice and Noodle that was always reliably dripping grease down the outside of the cart onto the sidewalk congealing into a small creek of aerated fried rice grease.
Portland,3e28m7,salomoncascade,0,Tue Jul 21 15:51:35 2015 UTC,Happened around half an hour ago. It looked like just a couple of them lit up. Maybe 3. Sorry for the bad image quality.

Portland,3e2npn,Solitune,6,Tue Jul 21 18:33:38 2015 UTC,I realize how great of a value AC is to comfort... less than a dollar a day over my 'normal' electric bill to keep my house ~25 degrees cooler than the outside.  That's the best money I've ever spent when i'm reaching for my blanket and it's 65 in my room at night instead of 80 like it would be without AC.
Portland,3e2npn,tongboy,4,Tue Jul 21 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's been hot. My bill doubled from May, but I work from home and have been running my AC a ton. And it's not bad... $85/mo to keep my home comfortable seems fair."
Portland,3e2npn,warm_sweater,4,Tue Jul 21 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"Mine was set at LO for most of July when I was home.  Had to pull out the onsie a few nights to stay warm.  Even had a few friends and pets that didn't have AC come over and crash on the couch.  For a little over a dollar a day, it's well worth it, not to mention my fridge is now stocked with 6packs from thankful friends."
Portland,3e2npn,detroitdoesntsuckbad,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:56 2015 UTC,Our bill was as expected - High. But we're fortunate to be in a new enough house to have the luxury of AC so I won't complain about the increase.

The concept of a show like Bar Rescue is great, but the execution by those meatheads is atrocious...it would be great to do the show right...you could really improve a city."

No one made any effort to contact her about the art being taken down as she would have much rather came and picked it up instead of being haphazardly stored by some laborer employed by the show. And in case anyone asks yes she was made aware about the show coming in and signed something so it had nothing to do with the show not having permission or whatever.

Portland,3dyeub,ranoutofbacon,21,Tue Jul 21 01:50:57 2015 UTC,St. Helens has been in trouble for years. One of the highest rates of poverty in the state and more people on SNAP per capita than the rest of Oregon.
Portland,3dyeub,springchikun,11,Tue Jul 21 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"A horrible place in general. Horrible schools, horrible meth problem, horrible people (predominantly), horrible police...the town is ATROCIOUS. Racist, backwoods, small minds with ridiculous delusions about themselves. I fucking hate that place. I was raised there and belong to one of the older families. I fucking hate my family."
Portland,3dyeub,Majorezytarget,11,Mon Jul 20 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"Horrible Meth Problem? I'll give you that, but when you drive through Longview, you start to think St Helen's is a ray of light compared to that shit hole."

Well, you alluded to another issue with the above quote, but to put a name to it: rampant cronyism/clan mentality.    I did 6 years in Saint Helens and I was warned more than once (and have heard more than one account) about what happens if you cross certain families in that town."
Portland,3dyeub,Kercharelli,13,Tue Jul 21 03:21:01 2015 UTC,"The same thing could be said about a lot of towns. I grew up in Scappoose, lived in Seattle for almost 20 years, and have been living in St. Helens for the past 5 years. Also, I'm queer, and very obviously so. I've had no real negative experiences since I've been back in Columbia County. You can find racist meth-heads anywhere. It's all about who you choose to associate with. Like my grammy used to say, ""You lay down with dogs, you wake up with fleas."""
Portland,3dyeub,urbanmermaid,6,Mon Jul 20 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"Right? We bought a house in St Helens almost a year ago and we love it here. Everyone has been super nice. We live in a nice, newer middle class neighborhood and haven't encountered any issues with the ""locals"". I haven't seen anything racist or ""methy"". We lived in Beaverton before and I'd say Beaverton was way more sketchy than St Helens.   We commute to and from Hillsboro for work and can't wait to come home every day. Lots of people are moving here and it isn't solely because housing prices are still low here.   I'd imagine that growing up here could kind of suck, especially if your parents didn't take you to other places on a regular basis and give you some perspective on why there are great reasons to live here."
Portland,3dyeub,springchikun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"I don't associate with them, they stain the entire shit hole and have since the 80's.

Portland,3dyeub,urbanmermaid,6,Tue Jul 21 01:46:19 2015 UTC,"Just to offer a counterpoint, I've lived here for almost a year and haven't encountered anyone openly racist, or any obvious meth heads. Sure there are some back woods type folks that I see occasionally in the grocery store but that's expected with any small town I'd say. I definitely wouldn't say that it's predominately horrible people. Everyone has been very nice to me and my boyfriend.   I like living here more than I liked living in Portland, Hillsboro or Beaverton. It's beautiful out here and it has small town charm. The people out here are really friendly in every day interactions, way more so than anywhere else I've ever lived. The schools out here are actually rated much better than most of the schools in Hillsboro or Beaverton, not sure about Portland because I didn't look at school districts in Portland when buying a house.   We bought a nice newer house in a middle class neighborhood so my experience is maybe slightly different than if I lived in certain other neighborhoods I guess. We also paid 200k for a newer 3 bedroom 2.5 bath and a good sized property, which is sooo much better than what we could have gotten anywhere near Portland. Our neighbors are all older people and younger middle class families. The most ""backwoods"" thing that is visible in our neighborhood is that most houses have American flags and a few have that stupid Libertarian/Tea party flag with the snake on it, oh and there are lots of pickup trucks I guess. We really like the area and love coming home everyday, we work in Hillsboro and commute every day. Even with the 40ish minute commute we absolutely love coming home."
Portland,3dyeub,warm_sweater,7,Tue Jul 21 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Even with the 40ish minute commute we absolutely love coming home.   Man, that's not bad at all. Same commute time my wife has from Beaverton to N Portland on a bad traffic night."
Portland,3dyeub,urbanmermaid,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:33 2015 UTC,"Right? It's actually only about 5-10 minutes longer than our commute when we lived in Beaverton (on Allen off of Murray) and worked in Hillsboro. The drive home now is much more gorgeous and a lot less stressful, even on the rare days where we get stuck behind a slow gravel truck on Cornelius Pass."
Portland,3dyeub,springchikun,-3,Tue Jul 21 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"That's one year. Give it time. I assure you, the place is disgusting. The higher than normal poverty rate should be indicative of that.   Your information on the schools is outdated or just wrong, or your standards are low. They're embarrassingly bad and the horrid graduation and inflating drop out rates hint at that. A year is barely enough to call it your home.  You're still in the minority. Its a dump."
Portland,3dyeub,urbanmermaid,10,Tue Jul 21 01:34:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure growing up here could definitely suck. Growing up in most small towns sucks though, I lived in a small town in Utah from ages 12-18 and I don't have anything nice to say about it either. I'll have to keep that in mind and take my future children out to other places often enough so they can appreciate certain things about here. Honestly if you hate your family, living anywhere with them sucks pretty bad though, I've been there.  I don't see our opinions on the area changing soon. We live in a great neighborhood where most people have lived here 10+ years and they still like it here.   The poverty rate is only 1% higher than in Portland...so it's really not significant and all of the real estate sites tend to use pretty accurate and updated data when it comes to schools but you're right...my standards are probably just low eyeroll  I'm not trying to argue with you or convince you of anything as I'm sure anything I say that opposes what you believe will be immediately disregarded, I just wanted to offer an alternate opinion of Saint Helens for others.   Have a great night :)"
Portland,3dyeub,springchikun,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:57:51 2015 UTC,"When you consider the poverty rate, based on population, being ""only 1% higher"" than a town where the population is SIGNIFICANTLY higher, that comment almost seems ignorant. Comparison to a town of comparable size, sure. Comparison to the largest city in our state- not totally pragmatic, is it? Real Estate sites can't be trusted as their job is to sell houses not keep current or even accurate records of the education situation there, eyeroll  Often they'll lie just to keep interest up, especially in a stain like St. Helens.   I lived there 15 years and moved because it's disgusting. The reason I hate my family is the same reason I hate that shit hole town- racists, small minds and deluded. They come from there, they embody everything wrong with it.  Your alternative opinion is based off of a year spent there. Hardly enough time to form your opinion beyond the bubble of your neighborhood. Great that you live in the Confederate capital of northern Oregon though, I'm sure it's just lovely everywhere you go (aside from the literal constant shit smell from the failing mill...or is it the actual shit lake on the edge of town?)!"
Portland,3dyeub,urbanmermaid,5,Tue Jul 21 01:23:27 2015 UTC,"Do I have to explain percentages to you? The population doesn't matter. x out of 100 is still x out of 100 regardless of if you're talking about a large sample size or a smaller sample size. 1% more means that there is 1 more person out of every 100 in Saint Helens, than there is in Portland who is in poverty.   Also I'm guessing you've never purchased a house or used a site like Zillow or Redfin. They don't generate the data. Even if they did...I wonder what interest they are generating by saying that certain schools in Beaverton and Hillsboro are rated a 1 and 2 out of a 10 where 10 is the best. Although you specifically are making me wonder about the quality of education here, I might have to do some further research.  I'm sorry you grew up with a shitty family and it's clearly impacted your world view. I hope you find some happiness where ever you ended up.   Also, realize that you can hate a place and other people can like it.  Again, I'm not trying to argue with you or prove anything to you. That would clearly be a losing battle."
Portland,3dyeub,springchikun,-6,Tue Jul 21 01:46:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right, I can hate a place and you can love it, yet like a typical small mind from St. Helens, as soon as someone didn't mirror your views, you became condescending (""eyeroll""). The bottom line, your ONE year in that DUMP of a town, makes your opinion completely irrelevant.   My shitty family WISHES they impact my world view. They WISH I was racist and homophobic like they are. They WISH I saw that dump as the center of the universe, likey they do. That is the precise reason I don't belong there and the precise reason I don't associate with them. They are St. Helens. They are 5-6 generations of what that town is all about and always has been. You are an outsider. You always will be. You might only see what other outsiders see. However, as I've said before: give it time. A year is nothing. Glad you love it though! I mean, you defend that landfill like its your first child, Hahahaha! That's like being incredibly proud of your house right on the water, complete with wrap around deck...on turd island.  Enjoy!"
Portland,3dyeub,urbanmermaid,5,Tue Jul 21 01:59:23 2015 UTC,"Ok sweetheart whatever you say. I only said ""eyeroll"" after you were condescending and said if I think the schools here are ok then my standards must just be low (which would make you the condescending one when someone's opinion is different, although it's not opinion...it's based on actual data), but like you said ""a typical small mind FROM St. Helens"" which would be you...not me. Like I said, you do actually make me question the education here. Your memory recall and reading comprehension aren't so great. You brought up the poverty rate first, then immediately disregarded the poverty rate when confronted with facts.   You don't have to be like them for them to have impacted your world view. I guess that's a high level concept though."
Portland,3dyeub,springchikun,-7,Tue Jul 21 02:11:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, I didn't say your standards WERE low, sweetie, I said, ""OR your standards are low"". Huge difference and more of an option. What was that you were saying about reading comprehension, yokel? The sad, egotistical truth is, you got offended because you don't like that I don't like the dump you live in and that was the only way you could justify being a douche.  I'm not going to sit here and post an infinite amount of data regarding the HIGH poverty rate or the horrid schools or any of the other reasons that place is a horrible dump. The reason? Its your problem, not mine. I don't live in that shit hole, you do.  I'm not going to waste my time convincing you of something I already know for fact (from experience) because your dumb ass will find out eventually. How's that for a high level concept? I guess Ill just sit over here with my STEM degree and just wish I was like you...all small minded and a super successful, over glorified taxi driver! I'm truly not concerned about you, your opinions or responses- you very clearly belong there. Maybe you love it because a predominantly white, low class town is exactly the utopia for you! To each his own.   You truly are king shit of turd island."

Portland,3dzcrl,flyingcaribou,2,Mon Jul 20 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember reading a long time ago that public art was being charged the same type of fees that advertisements like billboards would be, thus sort of tamping down the availability of public art.

Portland,3dzak9,ZippoInk,10,Mon Jul 20 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah three towers are under maintenance around town,  the biggest trouble maker being on the south water front.  For your s6 type (star) #(star) #4636#(star) #(star) into the dialer, then select ""device information, ""  scroll down to ""select preferred network type""  and select ""GSM auto (PRL)"".  This will switch you onto the 4g network that is working muuuuch better than the LTE.  This setting resets itself once you restart your phone.  Hopefully this helps,  that's what I've been doing on my S6 since there is no way to just turn LTE off easier.  Best of luck!   Edit: won't let me use star button on here...."

Portland,3dzak9,onionsman,2,Tue Jul 21 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"Full bars LTE and shit speed... Similar to a healthy wireless router and a modem that is on a network with 'tight butthole'.  Towers are broadcasting a good signal, but bandwidth is shit."
Portland,3dzak9,horsespower,5,Mon Jul 20 21:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yes it's total shit for everyone.  The built out LTE in Portland shortly before the iPhone 5 first came out. Since then a ton of new LTE devices have come online and there are just a lot more people it seems like downtown in general. Their network is failing miserably right now to keep up.   I finally gave up a month or two ago and turned off LTE, I get better performance on 4G. Will probably switch to Verizon soon."
Portland,3dzak9,anovaremnant,2,Tue Jul 21 02:46:23 2015 UTC,Verizon is just as crowded.  Come 1 PM I couldn't get anything above 1 Mbps in the office.  Then when you fall back to their 3G network it is just as bad.    T-Mobile seems to be the only solid performer in town right now.  10 Mbps download during peak usage times.  They also have a denser build out of cell towers that helps with the RF interference from other devices.
Portland,3dzak9,mechmuertos,3,Mon Jul 20 20:34:05 2015 UTC,I've got an Iphone 6 and I never see 4G anywhere and I live in SE just off of Burnside.  When I go downtown I don't get 4G.   It's pathetic.
Portland,3dzak9,imthethimble,3,Mon Jul 20 21:56:31 2015 UTC,Yup. There are several places in town where I get no service. A big one is Couch from maybe 20th to the burnside bridge. I take the 20 a lot and my phone goes totally dead.
Portland,3dzak9,plannersrule,2,Mon Jul 20 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is a big one. I take the 12, and it dies on me at about 20th/Sandy all the way down Couch to MLK."

It will look like your connection is fine, you'll go into Google Maps, walk/drive/bus somewhere, and halfway through the trip the map tries to update and I guess the connection fails and you end up with crap directions.

They tried to talk her out of it, so I kindly pulled out my TMobile  phone and did a speed test. At the time, I was being rate limited by TMobile and was still getting 12mbs down, 10mbs up. Her phone was getting 2mbs down and 1mps up. After that, things got a little awkward and they didn't try to convince her to stay any further.  We went I to TMobile afterwards, signed up for the 2 phone for $100 a month plan (with unlimited data), and now we both average something like 50mbs down and 30mbs up (can't quite remember what I was getting, but it is in this range)."

Portland,3e0eyn,Emosewa73,3,Tue Jul 21 02:18:40 2015 UTC,"Bogo = buy one get one (two tickets for the price of one). I've already got a taker, but it's a really good movie (at least, I love it) - I would totally recommend checking it out sometime. :)"
