DarkEnlightenment,3e1los,Nemester,18,Tue Jul 21 06:47:21 2015 UTC,"The whole idea of the upper middle class suburb was to make use of the money you work hard to earn so that you can live a life separate from the madness of the city.  By absorbing the suburbs into the city there will no longer be an incentive to work hard because everywhere will be the same.  In California this actually already happened...  A distant suburb of San Francisco was built up heavily during the housing bubble with rows and rows of McMansions.  These homes would have been considered ""Great Estates"" compared to the older ranch style of the 1950's.  So the housing bubble pops and there was no one to buy these houses, so eventually the prices drop in half and you get Africans that couldn't afford Oakland or San Francisco anymore who moved out there.  Guess what?  Crime went up.  And with Africans no less...  what a shock. (there are other non-Europeans there too)  So now you have what superficially is a suburb of McMansions, but the crime and culture is headed straight downhill.  Best advice...  sell your suburban home now before it loses value and move to a smaller town that isn't too near a big city.  What matters is your distance from a big city.  Plus it's time to get into a Northern red state if you can.  Don't count on a 2016 Republican victory to hold this back.  That's likely a fantasy because the numbers are going in the direction of the left and getting worse.  Hillary won't even need to do anything because these laws will be planted in secret now and only become actualized later and any criticism would be blamed on ""past administrations"".  Get out while you can...  the ethnically unified ""last stand"" of European suburbs is soon to die.  In California the ethnic suburbs have been shrinking and concentrating for decades and now this represents the final death of that process.  The delusion (which I observed in 2000) that you could ""escape"" the process is being shown to be a delusion."
DarkEnlightenment,3e1los,NeoreactionSafe,6,Tue Jul 21 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Growing up, I had family in a fantastic little suburb of Los Angeles which, in a matter of 10 years, transformed from a quiet, Baptist bedroom community of like-minded, hard-working elderly whites and Mexican-Americans into a low-income refuge for non-naturalized Mexicans. The quality of life in that neighborhood -- the local economy, variety of local businesses, upkeep of public utilities and crime rates -- all tanked.   The mid-sized cities of Middle America are the new suburbs. The American dream lives on there.   There are still great neighborhoods in suburbs and urban gentrification is bringing worthwhile cultural cache back to many of our downtowns, but the interim is where progressive ideologies come to roost -- unchecked crime, false economies and the dregs of society festooned with ""muh rights"" and ""muh welfare,"" crumbling schools and out-of-control taxes lining the pockets of lobbyists and bleeding-heart politicians who look at throngs of people sustained in a barely-livable state by welfare programs and drug money and say, ""This is justice.""

DarkEnlightenment,3e1los,MisterKlaw,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:10 2015 UTC,"Now, imagine if immigration had been a bit slower. Mexican families would still have been moving in, but with time to naturalize, they would set up their own social gradient with the truly whitewashed being above the fresh-across-the-line types, giving the latter something to aim towards.   Worked well here in Canada with Asian people, for the longest time, until we loosened our controls and were hit with more demand for immigration, causing the usual critical mass whereby newcomers don't have to naturalize anymore due to sufficient numbers of people that speak their language already here.   There's probably some upper bound for the rate at which a culture can absorb newcomers and continue to maintain dominance, likely affected a lot by the structure of the community. Since we don't really have communities anymore in white western culture, short of the tiny Bible Belt sorts of towns, there's really no way to even attempt dominance anymore."
DarkEnlightenment,3e1los,Dick-Tracy,0,Tue Jul 21 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"(This may go against the DE grain, but,) for me it's not about dominance but about acquiescing to the way things are done in the place you're trying to immigrate to. In the past handful of decades, Central-American, Middle-Eastern and East-Asian emigration to The States has been in full swing, too. But those groups seem to appreciate the American Dream inasmuch as we mean that when it comes to showing up with nothing, working hard and making a free life for yourself and your family.  Only the Mexicans -- who came over a fence, and brought their cartels and parasitic family structures and Catholic attitude toward birth control and their secular attitudes toward everything else -- really insisted on making the Southeast US ""Mexico with actual law enforcement."""

DarkEnlightenment,3e1los,Tsar_Moose,5,Tue Jul 21 16:39:25 2015 UTC,"My friends and I have had the conversation about whether or not it is worthwhile to buy a home as opposed to rent. We have discussed the pros and cons. The obvious pro for buying a home is that instead of rent money disappearing into the abyss, it goes into equity which you may eventually be able to get back. However, there are negatives as well. Once you get the home, you essentially become locked into a certain lifestyle. You have a mortgage that you have to pay every month, so you need to have a regular job that you can't leave easily. If you leave you can't pay the mortgage and you are screwed. If you want to travel, you are limited to very short durations of travel because you have to get back to your job to pay that mortgage. If you ever do decide you want to leave, you have to go through the whole hassle of selling the house. This could take a long time, and depending on the market, you might end up losing money anyway (home equity is of course a gamble). So, as a renter you have the option of jumping ship to something new at least every year and possibly earlier if the apartment allows you to buy yourself out of the contract. So the major pro with renting is increased flexibility with you life choices. This is difficult if not impossible to quantify financially. How can you put a price on freedom?  Though the government has been moving in this direction for a while, it seems as though they are accelerating an alarming trend which will make home purchase even less worthwhile. Many communities have been curbstomped and responsible citizens screwed because the government subsidizes poor people to move into communities they otherwise wouldn't be able to afford. Contrary to popular belief, it is not just wealth which differentiates different classes of people. The underclass is more criminal than the middle and upper class. They engage in violent behavior more often which reduces the safety of the community. They do not do as well in school and lower the quality for the children of the higher classes. So what ends up happening when you move the underclass into reasonably healthy communities is a large reduction in the quality of life for the more responsible previous residents and lowers the property values. If you buy into one of these safe areas with good schools, it is now very likely that in a few years your money will be lost because of forced re-location of the underclass in your community. The gamble on home equity is thus very bad at this point."
DarkEnlightenment,3e1los,Atavisionary,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good analysis. A lot of people miss the obvious boons of freedom to move around and so on. The major boons of staying put, like family and security are gone.  Interesting how the tone in this, and similar circles has moved from trying to change the decline, to just how can we live with it?"
DarkEnlightenment,3e1los,ForgeAndTemper,4,Tue Jul 21 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"I owned a house back when I was married.  It was a nice place in a good neighborhood that I bought because I used to believe that, as a man, I actually had children and a family.  The only reason I bought a home was so that ""my"" children would have a homestead to grow up in.  Now that I realize that I do not, never did, and never will actually have children?  That the woman always owns the children?  That buying ""myself"" a house for ""my"" children is just code for buying a woman a house for her children?  Why would I ever do such a thing again?  Now I own a 3 bedroom condo and rent out two of the rooms.  One of my roommates knows I own the condo but he is a close friend.  The other one doesn't know I own it.  The combined rent payments pay the entire mortgage, all the utilities, and net me around $150 that I put into savings.  With the current state of gender relations I think buying a condo and renting rooms out to men who spend all day playing video games is the way to go.  I really can't see any reason to buy a home anymore either.  I imagine that the housing market is only going to continue it's decline.  It can't be propped up forever.  And what happens when the baby boomers start dying off and trying to sell their homes?  Who is going to buy them?  There aren't enough people around to buy these houses.  Buy a condo.  Rent out the rooms."

DarkEnlightenment,3dz68g,Atavisionary,33,Mon Jul 20 18:43:56 2015 UTC,"To be on the receiving end of this kind of psychological abuse, as a mild-mannered, generally empathetic, imaginative young boy (read: MOST BOYS), is HELLISH. I experienced slightly less overt indoctrination in gradeschool ~a decade ago, but still remember how uneasy I felt every time we had these kinds of discussions. Am I like that? Sometimes I can be aggressive, and sometimes I'm manipulative too. Does that mean that I could hurt a girl like the creeps they keep telling us about? The answer is, of course, a resounding ""NO, THEY ARE PROJECTING THEIR OWN FEARS AND THE ONUS OF INTROSPECTION ONTO YOU, GENERALLY GOOD LITTLE MAN!"" But that isn't the message so the damage is done. I STILL get the thoughts when I have sex with a woman for the first time - ""Am I going to fast? What if she doesn't want this?! She just sighed, does that mean she regrets this?"" It's all completely irrational and neurotic, but the indoctrination is strong and that is my experience.  The thing nobody wants to realize: The majority of boys who actually would change their behavior due to indoctrination like this AREN'T THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. To repeat: The ones who are introspective and empathetic enough to actually listen are already introspective and empathetic enough not to rape, manipulate, physically abuse other people. The actual sociopaths who account for most rapes couldn't give a fuck less. Basically the indoctrination in the OP is there to fuck with the minds of otherwise good people and make them doubt and hate themselves. FUCK YOU, YOU MANIPULATIVE PSYCHOPATHIC CUNTS.  Another thing that bothers me: rape is always going to happen. NO matter how good the ""education"" is or how well you police things, people are going to rape other people, that's just how humans work. The feminist position denies this reality, opting for the unattainable 'should' - there 'should' never be any rape, and we ought to manipulate people so that rape never happens again. So, instead of teaching the obvious, practical solution ""Trauma is unavoidable, but the trauma victim can healthily cope with/grow from the pain (like fucking everyone has done since the god damn dawn of time),"" they go for ""WE NEED TO FORCE PEOPLE NOT TO CAUSE TRAUMA, IF YOU ARE THE SAME GENDER AS A PERSON WHO HAS CAUSED TRAUMA THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY A RAPIST.""   FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU. I've lived my entire adult life under that shadow of self-doubt, making up for the lack of introspection of people who have had unfortunate things happen to them by shaming myself, policing what I say and do. FUCK IT. But I'm not going to bitch. I'm not going to make a support group who goes around telling psychologically manipulative assholes to cram a fist up their ass. I'm going to go dig a ditch and then feel better about my circumstances, because I'm not a whiny cunt who feeds on validation and blanket blames everyone for the things that happen to me."

It is well known that children are generally ""gullible"", in that they believe what they are told by authority figures. To not believe what you're told and to reject everything continuously is a symptom of oppositional defiance disorder, these days.  Most people who have so-called True Faith were indoctrinated as children. It is exceedingly rare for someone raised in a skeptical tradition to form this same kind of faith without an exceptional personal experience that they are able to ascribe to the religion of their choosing.   Religion is a useful civilizational technology; that's one of the key tenets of the dark enlightenment. However, we must temper our recognition of the teleological values of memetically evolved traditions with our recognition of the excellent efforts made in philosophical enquiry over the last couple thousand years. There is no reason whatsoever to believe in the Abrahamic God; it's one thing to be a deist, but to go so far as to make falsifiable claims about the particular nature of that God is to open yourself up to damage from utterly trivial arguments.  It is, of course, entirely possible to be an atheist neoreactionary. You just have to be nice, and use the term Gnon, so as to show respect for those who disagree with you on this one key issue and are otherwise very similarly situated on most other topics."
DarkEnlightenment,3dz68g,curious97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"God in the Abrahamic tradition is more or less the same God deists believe in, save for a few philosophical issues (essence, immanence, permanence, etc.) except the latter is stripped of religion.  belief in God =/= religion  Which is why vehemently attacking the Abrahamic conception in favor of Deism is tantamount to saying religion sucks."

The Deist God creates the universe and fucks off to parts unknown, never to interact with his creation. A generalized theist God sticks around, doing what he pleases; but there is no guarantee of the three Omnis: omnipotent, omnipresent, omnibenevolent. Those three make up the Christian concept of the Abrahamic God.  Religion does suck. It is useful for helping to ensure that a civilization propagates itself, yes, and we recognize the values of the many traditions that contribute towards this within religions. Ultimately, though, it encourages a worldview that is not based on material reality, and does not adequately embrace the many tools that human have developed for divining truth in the form of scientific knowledge.   True progress, in my view, would be the genesis of a culture that learns from religion the best ways of ensuring propagation through generations, and learns from science the best ways of knowing the nature of the universe."
DarkEnlightenment,3dz68g,curious97,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:21:30 2015 UTC,"Those three make up the Christian concept of the Abrahamic God.   This is what I was trying to say in my comment: God in both of those approaches to theology changes only by the way we describe Him as doing/actions we ascribe to Him, i.e. how we conceptualize God (Richard Kearney explains an interesting idea about the Christian God being a God who might be. Going off on a translation of YHWH as meaning I Am who I Will Be and not I Am Who I Am as is usually said, he says that God is only a helpful force for Biblical characters when they assign even the worst misfortune to His benevolence. This is why so many pious characters experience a ""dark moment of the faith"", like idk Elijah or John of the Cross the spanish mystic guy etc. only to reemerge even more joyful and loving)  What I mean is, at the end of the day, whether you believe in a God that fucks off or a God that has your best interests at heart, you're still going to die of bone cancer if you get bone cancer, you know what I mean? The outcome is the same regardless of your worldview, and both traditions recognize this, except the Abrahamic one will reframe it as blessing/trial/testing/suffering inherent to the human condition which is a conduit through which we can attain theosis/Jannah/Salvation/etc. by having faith that He (God and all of his actions) is truly loving, [insert religion specific ideas], or that He is simply so large and powerful that our suffering is not much more than a blip in the grand scheme of things (this is essentially the whole meaning of the Book of Job)  The deistic tradition recognizes suffering (and I'm going to make a lot of assumptions here as I have never read anything resembling deistic theodicy, though it would be interesting) as something that we simply have to accept that God is either ammoral/too powerful to care/simply out of our lives. Just as believable, perhaps even more, but not as useful to an individual's spiritual life/comfort/etc.  We now get into the whole debacle regarding what is God's true purpose in sociological terms? Is it the comfort? Or is it the rules? In other words which is more important in making society tick and stick, Church or God? I'm prone to thinking that the rules and regulations put forth by a Church (word I use to refer to the institution of clergy/religious social constructors in all places of the world, not just christian ones) are more important than the whole comfort aspect but I am not quite sure about that.  I am happy you realize the value of religion, I think this is the first step everyone moving from edgy atheism to a more informed atheism or whatever position you arrive to has to make in these communities we frequent especially. However, I will have to take issue with your statement that religion necessarily encourages a worldview not based on material reality at all/does not embrace tools of science.  Religious societies are not built on purely materialistic (in the philosophical sense of the term) worldviews, no. But what is inherently wrong with that? Most humans we live with have a hard time understanding how atoms work, let alone forming their worldview on purely mathematical/natural science-based evidence. Not only that, but a lot of the things humans incorporate into their worldviews (good/evil/justice/growth/honor/merit/etc.) will never be proven objectively (yes I have seen the Sam Harris video). A non-objective, albeit true foundation of ideas has to be laid down in order for a society to function.  Religion also does not prohibit or even restrict the study of science by itself at all. A anti-scientific religion may do that, yes. But it is not a necessary characteristic of religion (or even of most religion) to do this. One egregious example would be the Roman Catholic Church. Founding universities, funding researchers who go on to write the Big Bang theory, building a damn observatory in their city-state, appointing scientists as ultimate representatives of Christ on Earth does not sound like the description of an anti-scientific religion to me. What the Catholic Church does do is be skeptical about certain advancements in scientific and technological progress in regards to their impact on human society, as any conservative worth their salt should.   True progress, in my view, would be the genesis of a culture that learns from religion the best ways of ensuring propagation through generations, and learns from science the best ways of knowing the nature of the universe   We pretty much have that already my friend. Though it should be reinforced and strengthened.  sorry for rambling a bit I was inspired"

It takes concerted effort to shift your own beliefs, even in light of evidence, and the vast majority of the belief-shifting material (aka propaganda) available to the average young man these days pushes them in the exact opposite direction from what we on the Right would like."

DarkEnlightenment,3dz68g,avian_buddha,-2,Tue Jul 21 22:44:33 2015 UTC,"I think that feminism is easy to criticize because to support feminism is to be politically incorrect. I know people don't want to hear that. But people can be simultaneously liberal and insult feminism, think of like the Amazing Atheist (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro1nkPAcIFw). Feminism and old school Marxism are the politically incorrect things to talk about. Anita Sarkeesian is the more politically incorrect one. Many liberals take positions that confer high status. A good sign though of a true believer leftist is if they believe in feminism.  Personally though I think egalitarianism that all the MRAs push for is feminism. I take the unpopular traditionalist opinion basically at the other end of the spectrum. What MRAs push for is irrelevant because at the end of the day it's egalitarian sausage, everyone puts a piece in and it tastes like crap. To me it's traditionalism or bust with none of the inbetween.  Lastly, I want to reflect that being raised in a feminist household is the worst. I'm glad I had my dad but he was far too passive. It's taken me years to undo all of the horrible conditioning, anxiety, and associated neuroses with being raised in that type of hell. It is still hard to shake the feeling sometimes. Going from your typical nice guy to being one where I could make demands took a lot of commitment but I got there. Further indoctrination will be worse but at least a greater number are awake.   Edit: Also article might be better under mildly interesting, it was kind of a dull read."

Article about the book here:   A pioneering new study of the fate of the Romans and other great civilisations such as the Ancient Greeks pins their collapse not on economic decline or war, as is traditionally held, but on biological causes. Historian and social theorist Dr Jim Penman suggests that the real cause of Rome‚Äôs fall in the 5th Century AD can be explained by a mass behavioural change in the population, driven by epigenetics.  Roman historians recognized what they considered to be a decay in the traditional Roman character from the late Republic onwards. Symptoms included a falling birth-rate, a growing gap between rich and poor, and declining attachment to ancient traditions. Modern historians have tended to focus on economic and political changes, but this new theory suggests that the root cause was, in fact, a mass change in temperament driven by prosperity.  With time this change in temperament led to the fall of the Republic and one-man rule, replacement of native Romans by more ‚Äúvigorous‚Äù provincials (who were, according to the theory, also affected in turn), economic decline, and military and political weakness.  Eventually the Empire was unable to function effectively or resist enemy attack, resulting in the sack of Rome in 410 AD ‚Äì the traditional date given for the collapse of the Roman Empire.  Dr Penman has dubbed his new theory, which sees human social and economic behavior as grounded in biology, ‚Äòbiohistory‚Äô."

Well the noxious fumes have not been stopped and the busy progs who've spent the last two decades mining away at civilisation are themselves starting to choke.   Leftist kickback is more important than conservative kickback, the latter is to be expected. I just wonder if it's too late. We might have reached peak SJW effectiveness. I doubt though that the numbers engaged in social justice on twitter, tumblr or reddit have peaked. The MTV show White People is likely the moment that history will point to to show when social justice and cultural marxism jumped the shark. If MTV is getting in on it, it's mainstream and therefore no longer cool. Hard to construct a victim narrative if adverts, tv-shows, books, politics are catered to your tastes.

I believe Swedes will get it in their thick skulls that you can not have both welfare and unlimited refugees. You guys hate Denmark so much but jealously is a more visceral emotion than rivalry.

Because then they can't swoop in and claim ""Oh look how we FREED THE WOMENZ."" Feminists have been taking over spaces but hey they reap what they sow.   It never ceases to amaze me that these communists who criticize ""identity politics"" can't see that class consciousness is their own ""identity politics"". That most people find that incredibly irritating because they support non-sense. It's absolutely pathetic they can't see this irony.   Communists are authoritarian, yea I know ""that's not real communism."" That load of absolute bs that shows a Marxist for what an intellectual coward they are. I have more respect for Marxists that at least have the balls to defend authoritarian regimes. Not snivel in the corner and say ""that's not real communism"" in order to avoid an actual debate about a subject, such liberal behavior. All of the Marxist revolutionary leaders wanted Marxism, I don't imply conspiracies. I just don't understand the idea that the dictatorship of the proletariat (official name) is not the same thing as communism. Makes no sense because by definition workers would own the means of production because their interests would be represented, right? No, I guess that's not ""real communism"" though.   Feminists are a cancer though, just all of left wing politics is a cancer. It never ceases to amaze me these left-wing types in the manosphere who only criticize ""feminism"" and ignore the hundreds of other bad egalitarian policies they promote. And conveniently ignore all of negative consequences of them, no I'm sure that feminism is the ONE and ONLY issue where the left is wrong. I'm fucking sure, bro. Uh huh.   But that's not real feminism. Those people can also fucking shove it. These people use that fallback on dictionary definitions and ignore the real conditions of which feminism has taken over. First of all it presupposes men and women are equal. Wrong. Then it claims on this false premise that laws need to make it more egalitarian. Wrong. And then it goes way beyond that and becomes a behemoth. Feminists get massive funding and grants from the gov't, universities, and even giant corporations (who want women in their to double the labor pool and make it cheaper). Off of feminism in the early 2000's you have the beginning of all of the terrible identity politics shit (white privilege, male privilege, etc.).   If you were to ask feminists on tumblr if they thought they were doing ""real feminism"" they would agree. Similarly if you asked members of ISIS if they were performing ""real Islam"" they would agree. So essentially the dictionary definition is meaningless, just as words on a page are meaningless, what matters is the ACTIONS (by PEOPLE) of the greater group. If their ACTIONS are simply anti-male and anti-family, then they need to be called out as such. This lazy copout of ""that's not real ________"". It's so tired, just give me a fucking break. But let me guess, that's not ""real feminism"". Where real feminism exists on this plane that has never come about in any country in history, just like ""real communism"" or ""real Islam"" or ""real Christianity"". Same tired excuses, I have too little time to deal with.   To re-iterate:  Identity politics = egalitarianism = feminism = communism  It's all the same shit at the end of the day and ends up with the same result."

Today the network announced they will reteam with Steven Spielberg‚Äôs Amblin Television for a Brave New World TV series, based on Aldous Huxley‚Äòs 1932 dystopian sci-fi classic of the same name.  Back in 2009, director Ridley Scott had acquired Brave New World for a film adaptation after chasing the project for a couple decades. But it seems like Scott got busy with all the other projects he has developed and directed over the years, or he just couldn‚Äôt crack it for the big screen. Maybe it‚Äôs the kind of story that shouldn‚Äôt be contained to a two-hour film.  While this sounds like a wholly exciting endeavor, there‚Äôs definitely a problem with adapting a sci-fi book from 1932. Because Brave New World influenced so much sci-fi in the 83 years since it was published, some of the concepts in the novel may not feel fresh to contemporary audiences. That was one of the problems with last year‚Äôs forgettable big screen adaptation of The Giver. The story just felt derivative and stale, despite being the one of the earliest stories of its kind. Here‚Äôs hoping SyFy and Amblin are able to make it work for modern audiences.     Done well and people might wake up a little.  Done poorly and it makes being ""the savage"" all the less of a threat because in effect this will have proven that the PC State is now so durable that even a movie designed to expose the workings of the SJW's has no effect.  ""He's the exception that proves the rule.""  The savage will pass unnoticed except for a brief fashion.    The easiest way to destroy Brave New World is to make it a romance between Bernard Marx and Lenina Crowne.  By making a ""love wins"" narrative they would actually reinforce modern marriage / gay marriage / marriage based on feeling happy.    After all ""feeling happy"" is the common thread between the Brave New World and the West today.  Expect the worst in that they will likely subvert the message, but if not it might be great.  ."

In Brave New World you would work around the difficulty of finding real meaning in a life filled with distraction.  That is the core message.  If life is just empty distraction then who needs history or struggle or truth?  Why care about knowing truth when the allure of distraction is stronger?  Why be a Neoreactionary who seeks objective truth when you could be a Politically Correct Social Justice Warrior where your ideology can change every day to create perpetual novelty?

Many really should be adopted: the colour orange, ""america is a communist country"",  quantitative economics is sorcery, revised caste system, royalist/formalist/Jacobite label, the 4 American republics, return to classic international law, etc etc. These are all not novel but serve as an intellectual foundation that people can rally around.  The author focuses on Moldbug's weakest writing, issues concerning a reset of USG and crafting neocameralism. Frankly, these ideas suck in comparison to his views on 20th century history, the Victorian sages, anti-democracy, and deconstruction of progressivism.   Moldbug is our Marx so his rhetoric will be around for a while. The far right on the internet talks in a modern adaptation of older Reactionaries, our rhetoric isn't new it's centuries old. Part of what puts the neo in reaction is making the necessary tweaks to the old dialectic. We don't need to make a new manner of speaking, it has already been crafted for us.

He has given the true right a minor morale boost. Dissociate now and then radicalize through true intellectual center. He is not that, but if anything a nice stopgap and perhaps even more tyan that, who onows.  I much prefer a very very careful distance from any endorsement because I personally suspect that any moment he could say something so stupid as to actually just make the ""progress"" he supposedly opposed appear to be more intelligent.

With supermarkets using just in time delivery systems, if the transportation system breaks down, in the cities you'll have starving mobs within 2 days. In the suburbs you have at least some storage space to stock up, you can collect rainwater, and put vegetables and chickens into the back yard when the time comes. This is how the Russians survived their collapse."

One is the slow, grinding, Russian style collapse (and recovery?) during which society suffers largely peacefully. People barter, and grow what they can. In this scenario cities < suburbs < farms.  The other scenario is the 'zombie apocalypse', which would result from a sharp breakdown of for example the transportation infrastructure. This would in short order lead to Ferguson to the n-th in major cities. This of course depends on whether the army is there to keep the order. If it's an army of females and trannies, then it's questionable how much order they could keep. Eventually as you say the (somewhat thinned out) hordes would start to venture outwards making both the suburbs and the countryside unsafe.

We use 35-40 billion barrels of oil per year, it is not sustainable by any stretch of the imagination.   The one change that is different is that oil is going to go through deflation, not inflation. When you run out of a good in one country, conventional economics tells you there will be inflation. That is true. But when we talk about a large global commodity that runs the world economy, a decline in world economic outcome comes with a decline in oil price.

He gives you Hell on Earth and offers your paradise in exchange for your soul damned eternally to Hell.  Another take:  The ‚ÄúFaustian‚Äù alternative to ‚Äúclassic‚Äù civilization really is no civilization at all. Goethe‚Äôs tragedy remains the great modern epic. Faust has exhausted philosophy and science before signing up with Mephistopheles. At the end of his misadventures, his final hope is to live among a free people on free soil, on land reclaimed from the sea, an existence so precarious that it would rule out the cardinal sin of complacency. United against a sea that at any moment might rush in, Faust‚Äôs people would live in a state of constant mobilization. One wonders if Goethe would have recognized his ideal in modern Israel. Tragically, however, Faust employs tyrannical methods to advance his project, which turns out to be delusional. Because Faust never ceased to strive through all his failed projects, Goethe allows his soul to be saved. That offers scant comfort to the rest of us, who observe that Faust left nothing but ruin behind him in all his striving.

Europeans had historically been ""desire self limiting"" (concerned with not practicing sinful behaviors) and that runs counter to most primitive societies like Africans who are ""desire fulfilling"".  So there is a basis in the difference based on history.  The Last Man represents the final ""Africanization"" of the European.  The progressives wish to make all men the Last Man and then have a small layer of rulers who are wise.  Europeans were once self governing and noble, but will become more and more degenerate and seek fulfillment of short term satisfaction.  Once we are all degenerate Last Men there will be no need for the tool called ""Racism""."

DarkEnlightenment,3dhw8w,NeoreactionSafe,4,Thu Jul 16 12:40:06 2015 UTC,"(Note: this post uses European terminology, i.e. liberal = libertarian, as it makes things clearer in my opinion)  Rothbard's critique is not directed at those conservatives who call themselves liberals, but at the equivalent on the left, the social liberals. It's important to distinguish those two groups.   I would define a conservative at someone who, when judging government action, primarily cares about results while disregarding intentions (favored by the left) or principles (favored by liberals). Thus, they generally support free enterprise, which creates better results than any other economic system, but quickly abandon its principles if they think that government intervention produces better results. A good example would be Singapore (a decidedly conservative government), which is often championed as a bastion of free enterprise and trade, yet it's illegal for people to buy or sell something as harmless as chewing gum. Similar cases are bans on drugs or sexual behaviors which are considered harmful to society. Those who share this view of ""results over principles"" are conservatives, not liberals, even if those two groups agree on many issues.  The group called out by Rothbard are those social liberals who call themselves liberals, but favor intentions over principles. They support issues like government sanctioned gay marriage, open borders or hate speech laws, based on the ideal of civil rights and equality for all, even if those government laws (""rights"") go against liberal anti-government principles. For specific examples just read the article.  It is interesting how in the U.S. this type of left-winger keeps trying to appropriate (triggered!) the terms that liberals use to describe themselves. ""Liberal"" has become synonymous with ""left-wing"" and liberals had to invent a new word, ""libertarian"", to refer to themselves. Of course, now more and more left-wingers describe themselves as ""left-libertarians"", forcing liberals to switch to ""right-libertarian""."
DarkEnlightenment,3dhw8w,DerMef,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:37:44 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that conservatives are ends-based. I think the difference is that conservatives believe in the natural law: that certain aspects of human nature must not be suppressed and others must be tempered that society may exist and thrive.  The difference between the right and the left is that we do not believe that man's nature is fundamentally changeable. We work with it and around it, not through it. You'll find that every aspect of NRx can be attributed to this principle: we see the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be. This principle of natural law is heavily present in Christianity, hence how Christendom managed to build such successful high-trust societies.  The left will try to indoctrinate a new Homo sovieticus and then blame everything but their flawed theories when it fails. Their theories always rely on utopian 'if we just' thinking."
DarkEnlightenment,3dhw8w,Lakey91,2,Thu Jul 16 16:57:27 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly anything but a fan of the left, which is why in my model they come off worst, only caring about intentions and ideas, not results or principles.  Rather than seeing the world, I believe the core difference between different political attitudes lies in how to treat the world. Btw, it's important to note that I'm only describing general attitudes, not actual party affiliations or positions on policies.  The libertarian principle is to leave the world alone.  The left tries to change the world according to their idealistic theories and ignores any negative results that those changes might have. This is also why they tend to not want to see the world as it is.  Conservatives try to manipulate the world to achieve better outcomes. This attitude can of course manifest itself in a wide variety of policies, depending on where you are in the world, what year it is or what situation the country is in."

Many of the ideas the Libertarians use were once abstract elements in conservative thinking (limited government of people who self govern) but when they are applied as Libertarians who reject the ""self govern"" part they become exercises in self delusion.  Things work best when people self govern and there is no external government.  Once the self governing ceases (degeneracy) it's necessary to end self rule (popular democracy) and begin the long road to rebuilding social capital with some kind of aristocracy that promotes culture.  Without self government the Libertarians hopes of ""freedom"" are unreal.  Libertarians are idealists...  not living in the real world.  (just a different flavor of liberal)"

This is why Dark Enlightenment / Neoreaction accepts that popular democracy is no longer a system that can benefit the people.  Democracy was actually best when the fewest people were allowed to vote...  basically just the aristocracy of the time.  The poor man who had no skin in the game was not allowed voting rights.  Women were also focused on family and not riding the ""Cock Carousel"" like today and didn't vote.

If other people make thermselves a problem to us (as in they commit crime which makes things worse for me) then we actually have an opinion and would seek action, but if two Africans (in Africa) decide to throw rocks at each other we aren't all that interested in breaking that up.    The Last Man  As a concept when we attain the Last Man of complete consumer driven degeneracy we stop caring about our ethnic differences because we have surrendered our identity completely.  This is how the progressives frame the Racism concept...  make all people so impulsive and degenerate that the satisfaction of desires takes priority over things like family. (this is also the Red Pill attitude)  The Neoreactionary approach allows us spiritual truth, our families, our tribe and then simple neglect for other world problems.

Seinfeld predated SATC by a good ten years, and despite being an adult when Seinfeld premiered, I can't recall ever watching a full episode of it, and only recall watching parts of a handful (master of my domain, the black-market shower head, and something that had a Pez dispenser in it).  I do recall finding JL-D more esthetically appealing than any of the SATC females other than possibly KD, and looking back, it's kind of odd that UnHolyWeird tends to do that in their casting ... putting the less physically-appealing woman in the role of a woman that is supposedly very physically-appealing, and vice versa.  OTOH, my wife and I watched a lot of SATC and enjoyed laughing at the weirdness and sickness of these characters, and looked at it as tragedy and something fairly typical of where society was headed.  From the comments at 28S, they point out that JL-D, despite playing a never-married, met her husband in college and had two kids kind of early.  I'm pretty sure that the creator of Orange is the New Black (never watched any of it), what's her name, Cohen something, is also married with children, despite pushing an agenda of sapphic sexual perversion which she does not, apparently, indulge in herself.

For those that don't understand what is going on here, schools have adopted a ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard for claims of on-campus sex assault due to a mandate from the Dept. of Ed. under Title IX.

In and of itself, this doesn't seem too bad, but it turns into a kangaroo court when coupled with the Kafkaesque definitions of ""assault"" and ""consent"" being employed and that fact that the accusers are not allowed to have an attorney present, not allowed to confront their accuser (that would be ""re victimizing"" the victim) and not allowed to present any extrinsic evidence as to what occurred before or after the sex act (that would be slut shaming).   What is ironic about these ""rape tribunals"" is that they actually reinforce the notion that women are helpless little princesses who need protection from the big bad males--i.e. the very stereotype SJWs are trying to overcome.   Tl;dr: 2 freshan get drunk, have sex; girl regrets losing her virginity, campus counselor convinces her its rape; man not allowed to present text messages showing she knew what was happening; expelled because he ""should have known"" she was too drunk to consent, even though he was drunk as well; man sues; jury finds in his favor"

DarkEnlightenment,3daybo,Kadmon_Evans,3,Wed Jul 15 01:41:35 2015 UTC,"The post-WWII conception of the nation-state is in many respects antithetical to neoreaction.   Indeed. In my mind, the ethno-nationalist model of the nation-state was the historic model, up until the 20th century, when, after humanity threw out ethnonationalism as a result of throwing out Nazism (really a ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"" situation), the ""French model"", as I think of it, was adopted. France has always been more egalitarian-leaning and radical than the rest of Europe; they offered citizenship to non-ethnically-French folk earlier than much of the rest of Europe. The idea that citizenship is more about papers and loyalty than ethnicity and heritage is a distinctly French idea, as far as I can tell.  We can then view WWII as being, among other things, a dual to the death between the old ways and the new ways. In Spain, the Reconquista, the forcing out of the Moors and the Jews, was less about ""these people are actively trying to kill us!"" and more about ""Spain is for the Spaniards!"". Indeed, it wasn't until a common culture (Catholicism) and ethnicity (Iberian) were imposed that modern Spain was even capable of congealing into a single unit.   Now that we're beginning to undo the process of cultural and ethnic unification that promoted the rise of the earliest nation-states of civilization, I think it's no coincidence that globalism, culture-exportation, radical egalitarianism, race denialism and communist internationalism are distinctly products of the post-WWII era."

You actually can't invent a concept like Racism without a baseline to compare it to.  The Last Man is the point when man is stripped of his identity and history and degenerates so far that further degeneration becomes impossible.  This is why it's being the last and and not the next to last man.  Racism always compares based on the final maximized degenerate state.  When we are all 100% degenerate beings then Racism goes away because you no longer possess language to have an identity.  The Racism concept attempts to the reach the Last Man state.  The end to Racism means the maximization of degeneracy.  Degeneracy ""up"", Racism ""down"".  Maximize degeneracy and there is no Racism.  How about?  Degeneracy Cures Racism  (the man outside of history cannot form the concept of family or tribe)  Without the concept of complete degeneracy it would be impossible to extrapolate the concept of Racism because there would be no concept of universal homogeneity.  It is from this ""Last Man"" who is the basis of this universal homogeneity that we point to the ""Next To Last Man"" and say:    ""Look !!!  He still knows his identity, his history, his tribe and wishes to direct action to it's benefit.  This cannot be allowed.

Some people think this is just a reflection of the reality on the ground, saying that women soldiers already are forced into combat because of their proximity to brunt of the action.  I'm not convinced, but I'm not against women having combatives training - after all, even our chefs and doctors will need to know how to fight if they're caught up in the mess of it.

That it would prevent one from doing many of the meaningful tasks in society, especially if it was severe. After all there are 2.5 million people living with schizophrenia in the United States and maybe 700,000 living with gender dysphoria. Long being the butt of jokes and having mental problems, there's a lot of ""social stigma"" against having schizophrenia. Perhaps the stigma itself is what causes many with schizophrenia to lash out on themselves and others. Many with schizophrenia in the past were institutionalized and considered mad. Maybe if there was a social fight to end the stigma against it, we would be in an even better place! Now that's some equality. You see how stupid this all sounds?"

DarkEnlightenment,3d53a6,beekelbub,4,Mon Jul 13 16:21:02 2015 UTC,"The reptilian in the room that is ignored by most of the Rightosphere is Reformed Judaism. It is essentially Unitarian Universalism, doctrinally progressive in all aspects. (Calvinism was also called the ""Reformed"" faith.) Reform sought to remove the ethnic hardlines of Jewish thought to allow them to better assimilate. Instead of being ""G-d's Chosen"" they would be just another sect among the multitude of Protestant denominations - who came to their faith through ""Reason"" and ""positive science"".   This came about as Orthodox Jews migrated in large numbers from the Pale Settlement into Central Europe, North Africa, and North America. These Orthodox Jews could in no way be mistaken for gentiles; their clothes, accent, superstitions and even smell clearly distinguished the Children of Moses. These immigrants often had to ""enter the Synagogue of the goyim"" and reluctantly confess Reformism in order to work in foreign lands.   What we can characterize as the ""international Jew"", ala /pol/ is clearly Reformed Judaism exerting its giant verbal IQ and spiritual zeal for crypto-Protestant ends. Issues such as sexual liberation, race mixing, human rights pity parties,  quantitative/Marxist economics, & mob governance DO NOT originate from the Talmudic tradition. The opposite is the case  - the cultural and political vices most promoted by the international Jew are those vices most resisted by their ancestors.   The Jews who most championed leftism [outside Lenin's cadre] in the first half of the twentieth century seem to be concentrated in the Rhine, New York, London, Paris, Vienna & Budapest. These areas produce the usual suspects who labour so hard for Mammon & Demos. Jews who retained their culture - mainly those from French North Africa, British Egypt, Russia and the old Ottoman empire now constitute most rightish Zionists. Likud is mostly composed of Russian descended Jews. In contrast, Israeli Labour is staffed by quarter Teutonic, red haired, soft handed Ashkenazim. Only by the virile birth rate of the traditionalist strata is Israel kept from the clutches of Socialism.    In order to tackle the Jewish question Reactionaries must form their own scholarship on the matter. National Socialists are our allies and willing recruits but will not flock until we have uncovered the Truth on this most critical matter. Most writing on the Question has been done by them - we must reign in this material to find a balanced and nuanced understanding."

One is a White Nationalist the other is a nationalist/nationalism apologist. One has been made a pariah the other is gaining respect in and out of academia.   In my mind Kaufmann's work is the Hegelian synthesis of previous nationalist writings (which should be appreciated as you say) and academic critique. It is in NRx's best interests to follow such synthesis. Remember your roots (20th century Nationalism) and your opponent (the Cathedral and marxist critique) but be aware of the destination: reactionary pre-eminence in academia, politics and popular culture.

Feel free to discuss the ""Jewish question"" to your heart's content. Frankly, I don't really buy it that jews are some monolithic entity capable of that level of subversion and control. Moreover, it is a regular criticism of eth-nats to say of blacks and hispanics that the problems they face are to a great extent of their own making. This is true. In the same line of reasoning, and though the problems are different, the problems whites face are to a fair degree also of their own making. Or at the very least, even in cases where Jews did spearhead some shitty prog propaganda it was still whites who freely decided themselves to agree with it. Whites who do not look out for their own interests are personally responsible for their failure. Just like black women having babies out of wedlock are responsible for their failure. Lastly, most of the seeds of universalism come from white protestant christianity. Much of the development of universalism was done by whites themselves without jews being involved. Jews may have participated in the development, but that to a large extent is because that just so happened to be the dominant cultural memeplex in development around them and almost everyone can reap personal benefit from the positive networking that comes from developing the dominant memeplex. Far more whites are guilty of pushing this sort of crap than jews just because there are so many more whites than jews. It is is universalist whites that are the main problem because without them non-white progressives, jewish or otherwise, wouldn't be able to do anything.   They still see themselves as Bible characters, and their ultimate loyalty and identity is to the religious narrative.   Most Jews I know are practically atheist.

Mathew 23 in particular has plenty where he calls them materialistic and traitors.  Benjamin H. Freedman wrote quite a bit about Jesus not being a Jew. I suggest going through his work for the evidence as this is all quite complex stuff that would take several pages to explain. Basically Judaism didn't really exist until the 8th century when the Khazars converted to Rabbinical Talmudism and rejected Christ. The Talmud in fact states the Jesus is in Hell for his sins.

White nationalism generally refers to European nationalism which is more in line with Germany, France, Netherlands, etc.  As Moldbug, I personally don't consider myself a Zionist but I support the right for Israel to exist as a state for Jewish nationalism. Which is what we should start calling it. Zionism is just a fancy word that makes it seem like it's somehow different or more special and ""chosen"" (haha) than other nationalisms. If it really is better than other nationalisms, I just really don't care. I don't know why white nationalists are so concerned with ""JEWS JEWS JEWS."" Who gives a shit. Worry about yourself and your own interests. If someone is causing issues, stop them from doing that. But don't just sit around obsessing about this supposedly malignant presence. Work on boosting yourself and your interests for yourself. And defend yourself against those who stand in the way. That's all there is to it.  Anyway, I support Jewish nationalism. I also support white nationalism. I absolutely don't see these things as being in conflict. Any individual member/group from the whole of either group which obstructs a goal can be considered on their own basis. That doesn't discredit the whole nationalism in and of itself and it does not speak for the whole. With groups, the idea of the individual and the whole is absolutely central. We have to learn how to really grasp that interplay in a more nuanced manner or else we will just keep failing and resorting to idiotic ideas.  Even further, I support other modifications of nationalism. White-Jewish nationalism. Asian-White-Jewish nationalism. Those are the other two great modifications that could produce good results. Some kind of strong balance there. Sorry if this is idiotic. I just think that there are many possibilities for experiment, and different ways of producing great societies. But they all have to be allowed to exist. Right now we are having to fight tooth and nails to protect monoracial societies from being made multicultural. And that's a serious issue.  But I also support the right of multicultural areas to exist.  I have some philosophy that says there should be space for several different ""communities"" with their own boundaries and right to exist and function as they want. I don't have time to really expound on this idea. It would involve discussion of what a community is, what its functions are, and why the makeup of a community matters, how it influences the community on both a day to day living side, as well as on the side of what that community is capable of achieving for itself and for the outside world and other communities.  And how each community might be run or racially balanced. I think we need to have more experimental communities with their own rules. People can choose to relocate to whatever community they find agreeable and work to grow it with other like minded folks.  As of right now all we have are multicultural communities, as well as more or less homogeneous monocultural Asian communities. There can be meritocratic multicultural areas, which I find actually quite important. But there need to be monocultural communities as well."

It's also awash in theologically-retarded and dishonest Christians and post-Christians who have moderately less power but do what Moldbug says they do: the Jews are not unique in their ability to disguise themselves and act as poison pills.  And in America, they don't even really predominate in that behavior. My anti-Semitism extends to the theological level - Protestantism itself is a Jew-minded reaction against Christianity.

Art in a sentence is the ability to pull a viewer into himself. Much like drinking a fine wine can call forth memories and idyllic scenes just from a sniff; A piece of art can instigate a flood of connections, making you think of a book you thought of in years, a betrayal you endured as a child, a painting you saw in the gallery you walked through 5 minutes ago.   Go to an art museum and find a piece that you cant stop looking at and makes you feel as if you are missing something. Research the artists other works, influences, contemporaries. Western art is one of the greatest things man has created. The question of what is beautiful might be the only worthwhile question asked in history.

I'm not saying absolutely nothing good has come out since then but most of it is crap.   The art thing has gotten to the point of disgusting, women using period blood, and people using feces to make ""art"".

It just keeps getting even more nasty. It's amazing I've watched two of those videos of the making of menstrual art, with an army of empowered women, and even you could see in the eyes of those white liberal manginas, the mistake they had made watching it.   In that video left by JeromeMorrow13 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNI07egoefc) it brought up a good point. The art in the past was subtle, nuanced, majestic, scenic, and had wonderful use of colors, shading, and background. If the art had a political message then it would also be hidden, left to the people to wonder and discover. Modern art punches you in the stomach with its awfulness, no nuance, no subtlety, just unoriginal, bland, awful crap spewed out. The art is the statement in the modern day whereas in the past the art would mean many different things to different people.   Now who is to blame? I don't believe in grand conspiracies but in general subjectivists and that tricky nebulous web of leftists (aka the cathedral).

DarkEnlightenment,3ctrt4,Aardopossadillo,9,Fri Jul 10 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"The ""culture"" mantra keeps coming up. The ""hard-working Northerners"" vs. the ""lazy Southerners."" This divide is a ploy. All of Europe is socialist when compared to the US/Asia.   So yes, the Greek spending is a part of the problem, but a small one. Greeks do retire early, but when in the workforce they toil longer hours than the Germans.   Sure, there's a tax collection obstacle too, but in my view these points are just diversions. These circumstances only serve as talking points for the plebs.   The whole conundrum comes down to basic economics. It's in the math. The German economy is heavily based on exports.   The Greeks need to import almost everything. When the ECB trashes the Euro, it becomes an enormous boon for the Germans and a strong headwind for the Greeks.   In this lies the reason the European Monetary Union is destined to fail.   Different countries have different economies, and thus need autonomy over interest rates.   The EU Monetary Union assumes that the European countries will act as one unified country like the United States, with some pseudo technocratic ""federal"" government in Brussels.   It only works on paper, just like Libertarianism."
DarkEnlightenment,3ctrt4,JeromeMorrow13,6,Fri Jul 10 21:51:13 2015 UTC,"One of these days I'll have to take the time and write a long post on the Greek situation. A few quick points:   The narrative says ""people in southern Europe are less productive than the northerns"". There are factories of German car makers in peripheral countries. They pay ~1/3 of what they pay to a German worker for the exact same work. If you drive an Audi TT, it's made in Hungary. So saying that people in the peripheral countries are less productive is utter BS. They are simply paid less working the same assembly lines. The narrative says ""people in these countries voted for lavish social policies causing indebtedness"". Let me explain how this works in reality. Certain NGOs, Soros and others pump a bunch of money into the most corrupt local politicians. As a result of overwhelming media spending, propaganda and lies people elect these fuckers. These kept politicians turn around and take loans and give monster contracts to their owners, incl German/Austrian/etc companies to build bridges/tunnels to nowhere. (and other similar BS projects) The locals derive zero actual benefits but are stuck paying back these loans. As an added 'bonus' these corrupt politicians push the progressive policies of their masters, and they have zero loyalty to their countries. On the macroeconomic level a good chunk of German exports go to the southern, Mediterranean part of Europe. What is debt in these countries is export surplus and income in Germany. Had these countries not taken these loans, the Germans would have sold a lot less. So no indebtedness in the south would mean no prosperity in Germany. (or a lot less)   I could go on but this post is already longer than I intended it to be. The narrative exists to shift the blame on the poor Greeks (and others in the future) and to distract you from the real culprits."

Saying that the Greeks work ""the same assembly lines"" doesn't mean much. Two workers on the exact same assembly line are not necessarily equally productive, even if we assume that those factories are built the exact same way.  Passing any and all responsibility away from the Greeks themselves as if they were totally hornswaggled seems odd to me. All of that lavish social spending was a bribe that got them to look the other way. While Greeks do work more hours than the germans, they spend a lot more time working to support the tourism industry, and far more Greeks own their own businesses, so most of those hours come from guys standing behind counters in cafes, not from workers hitting it hard in the factories."

Which really critical race theory having the words ""critical"" and ""theory"" is quite insulting to anyone who uses those words literally and has an IQ over 80.   2) MTV is unashamedly the worst television network on the air. I mean it. It took a while, from trendy music, to even breaking new waves into what we would call the ""sitcom"" genre. This show reeks of desperation for higher ratings, which they will get from SJWs as well as rightists looking to get pissed off. I'm not falling for it. MTV's had some other wonderful shows you might not know about, like they did a PUA/Seduction show. That flopped and was an absolute joke.   3) Just like everything else the media is more of reflection of the people. This idea that is molds the people is only partially true, the foundation of ideas for a show must obviously exist prior. For example you could not have a sci-fi show in the year 500 B.C. because people had no conception of rockets and time/space travel. They knew about stars but that was it. This show is just a great point for how much we have fallen.  4) Have you ever seen those show such as late night tv where they interview people on the street and the people they interview are idiots? Yea, that's probably because it's either staged or they purposefully picked the dumbest people out of the bunch. Obviously people not knowing that a triangle has three sides and stuff like that will get big laughs. My fear is that they will pick out sort of the worst of the white people to try and make us look worse/stupid (as if the media doesn't already try that). Of course any white person with a negative response will have to be shown as cast to say, ""look how horrible and racist and blah blah blah"" white people are. It's going to be bad."

Also your perception of Russia based on the Cathedral sources as ""stronk"" and ""totally anti-gay"" is a tad bit inaccurate.  The whole world's going to drain, but the best pick for now would be East Asia, if I had to guess: Japan, coastal China, South Korea, Taiwan. Admittedly, they aren't Western, but they aren't primitives either, and they borrowed heavily from us - and mostly good things.  Alternately one may choose: 1) Australia/New Zealand - simply for their remoteness - nukes probably won't fly that way. 2) Chile/Argentina/Uruguay - again, the tip of the South America near Magellan Straight seems like a good place to hide. And they're the most developed countries in the region. 3) Switzerland - good defensive terrain and very heavily defense-oriented mindset give them reasonable chances of survival. Getting residence permit there would be really tricky however (even for an American, whom I presume you are).  Israel mentioned in another comment would've been a terrible, horrible pick - 50 years tops and they're gonna be pushed into the sea. There's no way around that, especially if the West's gonna collapse.  As for the post - the fact (mentioned in the article) that they've completely plagiarized the flag from the French (payback for the Mistrals as we joked in Russia) really say it all. Gay or straight, if you steal someone else's work and don't give credit - you're a faggot anyway.  P.S.

But the author misses the point that they are not just pushing white privilege on the masses to establish equal ""privilege"" (however idiotic and subjective it is) but they are also using it as an explanation as to why things are the way they are for nonwhites. Blacks doing poorly in inner cities? Must be because white privilege - ignore genetic and fatherless factors. It's a cover up for real the explanation why. It's no wonder Lysenkoism became about in Russia's experiment with international socialism.   To put it very simply, in my opinion anyways, it's just another spin off of calling capitalism, or the system, a white power structure as the Marxists did; and asking the proletariat to rise up and defeat such evil foe, with state power of course. If only we can admit there is a white privilege then we can step forward to full racial harmony! Yet it only pisses everyone off because it doesn't work and creates more unrest. Ironically these things accomplish the exact opposite of what they supposedly do, it's almost as if progressivism is this self absorbing one size fits all ""solution"" to all the perceived ""evil"" in the world.

As has been noted elsewhere, Somalia has an abundance of liberty, but no peace, security, or law. Well, they have a bit of law through their local tribal customs and mediation, but it's not very strong.  Libertarians look at the liberty we have, see how peaceful and orderly things are, and suppose that the peace and order are as a result of liberty, rather than liberty being a result of peace and order.  The truth is that everything is about power.  Libertarians tend to be pretty smart folks, certainly above average. Because they tend to be versatile, they assume that just anyone can do what they do, which is false. They assume that rules aren't really necessary because surely everyone knows that rape, for instance, is bad. Everyone knows that. Right? ...Right? Well, it turns out that this isn't the case.

I don't know any libertarian who says that everyone knows rape is bad, or that rules are unnecessary. Most libertarians are statists to some extent, they believe in a government that enforces the NAP. Libertarians understand full well that people lie, steal, cheat, and defraud. They just believe that systems will naturally evolve to handle these problems.  This is in fact exactly what has happened over the past 200 years, it's just that the systems that evolved were statist; and when the state performs these functions, it crowds out private businesses that might otherwise fulfill those roles, which is why we have the FDA rather than a private organization that serves a similar role. The problem as the libertarian sees it is that a government subsidized agency has little pressure to be efficient or do its job well, and the fact that it is allowed to be inefficient means that private organizations can't compete.  I think what most people in this thread are arguing against is left wing anarchism, whose proponents believe that the solution is to give rights (both positive and negative) back to the individual (communities, workers, etc.). The libertarian is just interested in negative rights.  You can argue that libertarianism is naive to place its faith in private enterprise, but don't argue against a strawman."
DarkEnlightenment,3cklnw,ProblematicReality,2,Fri Jul 10 14:32:27 2015 UTC,"I was really arguing against a certain flavor of libertarianism, specifically voluntaryism and deontological anarcho-capitalism, who have no little or no concept of the absolute need to maintain cultural homogeneity in a region in order to keep social capital and mutual trust high. Their arguments, and those of many like them, amount to ""people in general don't do bad stuff; if someone does bad stuff, it's because of the state in one way or another"".  Their idea is that their specific flavor of deontological ethics will naturally resonate with everyone entering their hypothetical community because it's a universal human awareness that rape, for example, is bad; my point is that their beliefs systems (particularly open-borders voluntarists/ancaps) are not strongly enough fortified nor robust enough to be able to handle large waves of immigrants who may be hostile (either deliberately or inadvertently) to the stability of their system.  I apologize for the ambiguity; I've become used to using libertarianism as a catch-all term for various liberty-oriented movements, including Libertarianism (the party), anarcho-capitalism, voluntaryism, etc.,... and I believe that if one follows the libertarian train of thought long enough, anarcho-capitalism and/or voluntaryism are the natural results.

DarkEnlightenment,3cklnw,FatStig,15,Thu Jul 9 09:34:31 2015 UTC,"Check out The Believing Brain by Michael Shermer.  Short story: humans are hardwired for teleological reasoning.  As such, it takes considerable intellectual discipline to override this with logic.  Most people just don't possess the capacity to do this.  As such, most humans cannot function without some sort of worldview whereby teleological reasoning is applied, even though teleological reasoning is inconsistent with how the universe actually functions.  Religions provide a systematic and semi-coherent worldview that appeals to the teleological reasoning of the human mind.  How well or poorly the particulars of a religion cleave to reality is irrelevant.  What matters is natural selection, on the civilization level.  Those religions that reinforce functional behaviors within a society are selected over those which do not.    It is not therefore surprising that a few religious traditions (Abrahamic, Confucian, Hindu) have come to dominate.  Though none of these religions provide believers with any real understanding of the universe, they do provide societies with a set of norms that lay the foundation for sustained growth.  What you see in slow-motion collapsing civilizations, from Rome to the US, is a rejection of the norms that brought them success in the first place.  It is based upon a flawed belief by intellectuals (in modern terms this includes both leftists and libertarians) that, once freed from religion, the populace will somehow magically become a beacon of logic and reason.  As those of us here all know, all that happens is that the established religion is simply replaced with another one.  However, the upstart dogma has not been subject to the selective pressures of the more ancient one, and is almost always degenerate.  Thus, instead of heroes like Hercules and martyrs like Jesus, whose stories (true or not) exemplify the better aspects of human nature, you instead get Columbia's Mattress Girl, whose tale is nothing short of glorification of vice."

DarkEnlightenment,3cklnw,TragicHipster,8,Wed Jul 8 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"The reason libertarians are drawn to DE is because of its criticism of two things: egalitarianism and democracy.  Libertarians outright reject the sort of egalitarianism embodied in equality-of-outcome (from each according to his ability to each according to his need), so they're already skeptical of egalitarianism.  Descriptive egalitarianism is trivially false; some people are just better than others in some ways, which is why you go to a dentist rather than to your neighbour when you need a tooth extraction.  Egalitarianism in the moral sense--i.e. that every person is sufficiently equal in terms of moral consideration--is questionable; why should an unrepentant child molestor be granted any degree of moral consideration at all?  That said, most libertarians do believe in something like this, but it's far from self-evident, and often they come to question it when their anti-consequentialist intuitions are put under enough strain.  That leaves equality-of-opportunity which is probably the form of egalitarianism for which the strongest normative case can be made, though since the opportunities available to various individuals are clearly not equal, they have to rely on something like a consequentialist meta-ethical justification of liberty (even if equality-of-outcome isn't perfectly consistent, it gives the best results) which is at odds with many hardcore libertarians' deontological intuitions.  Egalitarianism and libertarianism are often in tension.  Libertarianism and democracy are also in tension, perhaps even necessarily so.  As much as Slate is a graveyard of ideas, they ran a piece whose main thrust was basically that libertarianism is anathema to democracy, and in the end it was right, if for the wrong reasons.  What all libertarians share to some extent or another is the idea that one ought to be free to choose one's own course of action unfettered.  What a belief in democracy entails to some degree or another is that one ought to be able to fetter the choices of others via the democratic process.  When understood in these terms it's obvious that there's a disagreement in principle here, and when one sees the way democracy actually plays itself out--viz. people voting themselves the fruits of others' labour from the public treasury--it becomes downright undeniable that the two are at odds.  This is in part why libertarianism has so much trouble gaining political traction in modern liberal democracies.  Even if one is the sort of consequentialist libertarian who's willing to tolerate a little bit of vice to maximize virtue, it's very hard to believe in the democratic political process when it seems to be a progressive downward slide into the tyranny of an irrational mob whose whims might change like inclement weather on a mountainside; now this way, now that way, never predictable, and certainly lacking any goal or unified purpose.  One can forgive the progressives of the Enlightenment for their having not been themselves embroiled in mature forms of democracy, but for the modern man to believe in it is almost certainly the mark of rank ignorance and unwillingness to look reality in the face.  So where do these egalitarianism-skeptical, democracy-weary libertarians turn to?  It seems there's not much place for them outside libertarianism itself.  Enter NRx.   In other words, libertarianism is flawed because of a false assumption about human nature--i.e. that people will act in their own rational self-interest and that they will leave others alone.    I've never quite understood this critique of libertarianism, because it's a strawman; Austrian economists, for example, don't assume that everyone is rational, but rather more fundamentally that people act in ways they think will benefit them, and that this (rather than econometric statistical models) is the best way to predict behaviour.  Note that the assumption is that they act in ways, not which are necessarily rational, but which they think will benefit them.  People are often wrong about what will benefit them.  The libertarian might say that a thorough-going minarchist society, once established, will be naturally resistant to the claims on other people of irrational, violent cells within the body politic.  It's pretty hard to usurp a monopoly-on-force whose sole purpose is to maintain order and nothing else when the public actually understands what the proper bounds of government should be.  That possibility doesn't seem as much a worry as the possibility that such a society will slowly slide into a democratic polity again after becoming the chubby, indolent victim of its own success, forgetting just what made those proper bounds proper in the first place."

Letting go of libertarianism is likely part of reaching intellectual maturity.   How do we achieve this? I have no idea. But DE seems to be the only group out there exploring these themes.

Libertarianism remains an ideal system for small homogenous nations and communities with strong social capital and an intelligent, educated citizenry. For most young men raised in upper-middle class lifestyles, it's seemingly obvious that libertarianism would work far better than any inefficient, dogmatic, and oppressive system in place today. It's a perspective born of solipsism.

You'd find Libertarians claiming that as long as NAP is 'accepted' any philosophy or political movement is Libertarian. For instance, if you are a christian and you believe that ""Bible supports NAP, and that's why I am a Libertarian"" then you're perfectly fine with Libertarianism. Same goes with left-libertarians, ""I believe society would be a lot more economically equally if not for govt intervention"", ""Racism is a problem created by the government, without govt intervention, there wouldn't be racism"".  Because of a lack of a foundation, sooner or later Libertarians reach a point where they are frustrated by the fact that their ""awesome ideas"" aren't accepted by the masses.

It's not that people despise inconsistency so heavily that they'd jump at anything consistent. Good ideas are consistent, bad ideas are inconsistent. Not all consistent ideas are good.  Also, lets not go overboard here, Libertarianism has not been rejected by the masses. Libertarianism rarely sees a turnaround like communism sees(there are so many people on the right who used to be ex-communist/leftist).  The problem with Libertarianism is faced by the people who have found the idea to be great(at least initially), but struggled against getting it adopted. Most libertarians feel that some people are just unable to see the merit of the idea, no matter how hard they try, so there must be a deeper reason for that.  Libertarianism is a movement of people who think ""Golden Rule"" is the universal principle and universal end of the knowledge. This is why they face problems when they argue with people.   Most of the people I've found on Neoreactionary circles who come from Libertarianism tend to favor a race/genetics based explanation, when it doesn't explain why so many people of the same race are so hostile to Libertarianism."

Almost all the logical positivists have move on to ""falsificationism"", that only those statements which are falsifiable are true. The problem they all have is the same, they say a universally true, unfalsifiable statement, about every statement must pass a certain standard, which the falsification principle itself wouldn't need to pass.

Treaties were broken all the time, the trail of tears was 5 broken treaties, removing the settled Native Americans from legally owned (treaties) tribal lands that were in the east and forcing them to walk to Oklahoma.  It was bad as it is made out to be.  Many of the Native American tribes make ISIS look like the care bears.   The Comanche were an eastern tribe that moved to Texas and colonized it essentially, they were known for Burning children alive, scalping, raping, slaves, etc.  Some other tribes were actually the peaceful noble savages they are made out to be.

DarkEnlightenment,3cm6xs,vakerr,7,Thu Jul 9 03:52:04 2015 UTC,"This may not be specifically what you were requesting, but here's a few of my opinions that can be of interest to readers here.  Liberals and leftists seek to deny red people any agency. As a result, our native ancestors become dehistoricized proto-hippies who were apparently all hyper-egalitarian, proto-Northwestern-European-Feminist, and infantile. These narratives are more dehumanizing than alternative narratives that recognize the dynamic, highly variable, sometimes shocking, and sometimes sublime elements of Amerind cultures. I recommend reading old accounts of Native peoples, especially ones written in Spanish about Andean or Mesoamerican peoples. There is plenty of disgust and confusion, but also a great deal of awe and respect.   Egalitarianism was more so the rule amongst those practicing hunter-gatherer lifestyles with minimal agriculture. The Iroquoian peoples were known for more developed practices of social organization and customary law, and also had matrilineal descent. Many of the Iroquoian nations were simultaneously renowned warrior groups, such as the Mohawk and the Cherokee. My point is that much contemporary historiography superimposes modern/liberal notions of gender equality and social organization upon these peoples in order to create a myth that can then be instrumentalized to be used against the type of people who vote for Republicans."
DarkEnlightenment,3cm6xs,nahuelkura,2,Thu Jul 9 06:55:36 2015 UTC,"Two topics that are usually not addressed by most: sovereignty and assimilation. It is fair to say that treaty-breaking was fairly widespread amongst both Euro-Americans and various indigenous nations. However, by the time many groups had given up struggle against the United States, there were several factors that were highly disadvantageous to native peoples.  Native customary law was not favorable towards assimilation, and American society wasn't exactly welcoming red people with open arms, regardless of whether or not they were educated or skilled. This would all be fine if traditional lifestyles were still sustainable, or if native peoples had any actual degree of sovereignty, but this was not the case.   I'm really more of just an anti-liberal rather than a ""neoreactionary,"" but most discussion of Native peoples in the US just degenerates into either crude utilitarianism or ethnonationalism (sorry, not an ethnonationalist, nor very anthropocentric), or blaming white people, which I refuse to do despite being descended from native peoples of the Americas.   In summary, yes both sides committed atrocities, yes treaties were broken. Whether or not you think it is ""good"" that white settlers supplanted the natives of North America is more of a question of whether or not you think industrial civilization and economic development are good in and of themselves. Also, it would be ridiculous to blame white people because the majority of native peoples from Canada to Tierra del Fuego were ravaged more by disease than by rifles. For me, the greatest tragedy of this whole affair is not lost wars or cases of slaughter ‚Äì any indigenous warrior would be willing to accept defeat at the hands of a competent foe. Instead, the greatest tragedy was the complete loss of sovereignty for remaining peoples, the inability to reconcile traditional culture and lifestyles with modern liberalism, and the resulting loss of traditional culture (language and spirituality above all)."
DarkEnlightenment,3cm6xs,nahuelkura,6,Thu Jul 9 06:43:09 2015 UTC,"W. H. Lecky Moldbug's rec on Revolutionary America paints a troubling picture. The French had much better relations with the Indians than the Protestant settlers. It was called the French and Indian War after all. English settlers especially in Virginia and the territories considered the native another forest beast. For good reason, they often killed without mercy. On many instances frontier settlements were just wiped out by bands of warriors. Parliament sought to station some number of troops for the protection of the colonies and taxed the Americans to help fund their defence. We know what happened after that. Generally speaking cruelties were committed by local yokels and the tiny governments strained considerably to reach just arbitration.  There's lots of Indian wars minutia to pick through both pre and post independence. Most historians tend to gloss over it with a Red brush ignoring the great complexity."

Native American civilization largely collapsed purely by accident. 90% of the population in places died in a generation. There was a huge vacuum for Europeans to expand into, in most places. Without this effect, colonization would have looked more like Asia or Africa.  As far as conflict goes, everyone was pretty shitty to each other. Native American's had lots of violent conflicts with each other, and the reasoning behind it extended to their instigating conflict with Europeans. Banditry, harassing unwelcome immigrants, etc led to Indian attacks on Europeans. Europeans responded in exactly the way you'd expect them to deal with bandits and groups of people committing violence on their community.  Europeans were proactive in instigating conflict when there was something they wanted. When the federal/state/territory/colonial/local government wanted something and thought they could get it most effectively from the natives by force, they certainly did. Treaties were broken, smallpox blankets were used, the Trail of Tears involved transporting tens of thousands of people to Oklahoma so that good farmland could be sold to plantations."

The Germans in Romania were not deported but were instead dispersed within Romania. Many left Romania for West Germany between 1970‚Äì90, and this trend increased in 1990.     .

Sure, there's the benefit of ""knowing thy enemy"", but all that really happens is that you're implied to be an oppressor. It is in this sense that there is ""no benefit"" to discussions involving racism and sexism. Feminists and racial rent-seekers usually aren't actually interested in a conversation; they're interested in garnering sympathy, showing their victimhood, convincing you of their victimhood, and utilizing the social capital they receive as a result of these things to further their ends-- whatever such ends may be. If you disagree, you ""don't get it"" or ""you don't understand""; worst case scenario, you get forced into sensitivity training and/or lose your job.  I mean, do you really believe that there's a great conspiracy of whites and institutional racism preying upon and deliberately victimizing blacks? Or do you think that black culture is large extremely dysfunctional and contributes to high crime rates, and that there may even exist a genetic component? The former is what the racial antagonists from the left would have you believe, the latter is what the data would seem to indicate.  Do you believe that men all conspire to keep women barefoot and pregnant, or do you suppose women get paid less than men because they tend to prefer working fewer hours, take more time off, end up with less work experience due to childbearing, and are statistically less likely to ask for raises (probably due to not having as much testosterone-- which is a good thing, by the way!)?

I get that you were doing it to effect rhetorically and I take your point.  However, I've never had anyone imply that I'm an oppressor in the way that you see a black revolutionary, like Malcolm X for instance, in some old interviews on youtube actually say that they were afraid of the wishy-washy-ness of white liberals and due to their tacit complicity in oppression that they were not invited to participate in their movement. That's never happened to me.   I have had people explain to me their position and describe ways in which they say that I benefit from some power structure that I wasn't aware of. (Either from just never having heard of it, or from a misunderstanding of it from prior conversations.) Did I believe them 100%? No. Did I think that they personally wanted something from me? No.   The larger question of if those power structures exist is interesting, however. I doubt that anyone has the completely perfect lowdown on something...especially if they think that somehow it's causing them to get the short end of the stick. People tend to conspiracy thinking in that situation and read intent and malice in places where it may not actually exist. The larger question of whether there are societal power structures that exist nebulously within and around the power of the state...I think that is very interesting and in both the cases of structural racism and patriarchy there are very valid points that are made in their support. Are the ravings of a freshmen feminine studies student a good representation of those points? No. Is a young black man on the streets of Baltimore going to eloquently describe white power structure? Probably not. If you read those arguments dispassionately, though, some things rise to the top.

Everything you say is 100% spot on, yet if whites continue only having 1 or 2 children then Western civilization will still be diminished by non-whites who think nothing of popping out 5+ kids.  It doesn't explicitly involvement in the arts and such to support and enable Western civilization. Take my grandfather for example, he had 7 children, worked his farm, and also worked at a cement plant his whole life till he retired from there. The man just turned 80 and he still farms and plays softball. He was never big on art and symphonies, hell he's never done much of anything except work hard, gone to church, and been an awesome father, grandfather, and now great grandfather.  He is a great man even though he's never done anything most people would consider exceptional. His contributions to Western civilization are in the form of his everyday deeds, his work ethic, and his children whom he raised to be like him.  Producing children and raising them right is more important, IMO, than to take an active role in the arts. No amount of art appreciation will save us from the current downward trend of white populations in America and Europe.  Edit: My wife and I had child #2 in January and we plan of having at least one more child, perhaps 2 or 3 more if we decide it's right. It tough sure, but we wouldn't have it any other way.

Unless you isolate yourself from all technological advances in the past 5000 years, you owe returns. Even an MGTOW style requires you to contribute to earn money; if it didn't, there'd be no society.   The last point is what we are now seeing: rampant welfare & tolerated decadence heralds the end of a society.   why do I have to do it as well?    Circling back to this, I will try to address this in terms of your ""no fucks given about anything except me"" reality:  You have to do it because it's easier for millions of people to do a little to survive than the alternative - for each and every one of them to individually service all their needs such as sanitation, food, medicine and more; more than 99% of people aren't capable of doing that individually, so we'd all be dead.

In the latter part of your reply, I think you're confusing me for some kind of a hermit. How would trying to fulfill all my needs by myself be a hedonist lifestyle? The point is that you should live your life in accordance with what you want, not some esoteric obligation to ""pay your debt"" to a civilization.

You need to get them out of your life immediately, we all have responsibilities and duties to save ourselves and the tribe. If they refuse those responsibilities then why should I try and be around them.

I agree we should try and make other meaningful contributions to Western culture. And I appreciate other cultures as well.
