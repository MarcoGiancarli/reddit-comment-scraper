""Each time, Legadema raced down to pick her up before the hyenas descended, and carried her back up to safety. The baboon clearly thought of Legadema as a surrogate mother. For several hours, they nestled in the tree.""  Unfortunately, without sustenance from its mother, the baby baboon did not survive the night, but Legadema's protection likely spared it from some worse fate."

Check back in a couple weeks or so and there should be a new batch. Also, videos can be found at:   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1DGyqEJlH3Xk7BXWtRnyjw  Edit #1: Oops, I just saw that Facebook links weren't allowed here, so I removed it.  I'm not sure if the Youtube and Livestream links are allowed either.  I guess I'll ask the mods.  Edit #2: Oh wait, those are rules for r/aww.
