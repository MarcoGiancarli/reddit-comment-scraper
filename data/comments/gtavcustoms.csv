gtavcustoms,3e1b1p,sammys87gnx_gta,3,Tue Jul 21 04:49:59 2015 UTC,Metallic Bronze with a Race Yellow pearl would match this pretty well.  I can't remember which one but I had one of thr brown's with a race yellow pearl and it looked like this too. Although it may have been darker.
gtavcustoms,3e1b1p,Mystic_Zombie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:05:00 2015 UTC,Gonna try it as secondary but looks tacky as primary imo
gtavcustoms,3e1b1p,Un-trollable,0,Tue Jul 21 10:59:05 2015 UTC,"Gold is obnoxious unless used as an accent, it's a less is more sort of deal.   If you paint your car completely gold you're telling everyone that you like to try too hard to impress people and it generally makes you look like a fucking pretentious poser but if you use a slither of gold you only hint at greatness and thus you come off as looking tasteful, classy and humble, it's best to be used in moderation as a secondary rather than a primary, like Matte black and chrome, it has to be an accent to something to look good to both the trained and untrained eyes.  Anyhow, you can find brushed gold in the metal tab in the respray option."
gtavcustoms,3e1b1p,Verbank,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:16:08 2015 UTC,The gold look I'm looking for isn't the one in the metals category I'm looking for a modded color that looks exactly like that because that's the Laguna seca mustang in not looking for the tryhard ( even though I'm above a level 100 ) I just like the way that gold looks because it's different then the games stock gold. Maybe I'll search enough to find a perfect gold.
gtavcustoms,3e1b1p,Verbank,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:50:25 2015 UTC,"then you'd use a metallic brown like sandalwood with a very rich, almost orange yellow as the pearlescent highlights, but brushed gold is a better way of doing things."

Edit: You can make it so you can have a missing hood and it shows the whole engine without the blowers.

It will look like a rally car if you give it a roll cage and suitable spoiler with a certain paint job like red primary and white secondary with white wheels and custom tyres. The most fitting wheels are Rally Master :O in the Tuner category.  Or go with the Brawler if you want more of a Dakar Rally car.

The main difference between the two is steering. The Osiris likes to understeer, so sometimes you simply won't make it around a turn without braking hard. The T20 oversteers and tries to spin on you, but you can pretty easily correct it and keep a tight line. The T20 also seems to want to stick to the ground a little more.   And who doesn't love a fancy pop out spoiler? Nobody, that's who."

Buy after-market offroad tires - any.  Paint them black.  Leave LS Customs. Put car back in garage. Bring it back out, go to LS customs, equip stock tires. leave LS Customs, put in garage.  Restart game. Now you'll have stock rims / wheels that are painted black (or any color for that matter)   You can use that trick for chrome wheels as well, giving some of them a tinted chrome color to them."

gtavcustoms,3d2pbz,catchydude,5,Mon Jul 13 01:22:30 2015 UTC,"That's tough. Everyone already knows the best cars in each class, so just because you don't do any visual mods, the fact you're using such cars should be enough of an indication that you know what you're doing, and therefore might be a threat.  With that said, I've made a couple sleepers that I've really enjoyed. Sabre Turbo looks great even without it's plethora of mods available, and if you drive it right, it does a pretty good job keeping up in muscle races. I also had a visually unmodded Elegy that I've won a few races with.  Some cars, as I'm sure you know, have very little visual mods available, yet are among the best in their class. For instance, the Carbonizzare might fool people if you keep the stock rims, and don't put a spoiler on. Bonus points for choosing a classic paint job that's available in the car select screen for races."

And what do you mean with ""it's a way bigger effort to just select every fucking thing at the end of the every fucking category""? Sounds like you wrote that in a fit of blind rage."

The Stirling sounds a bit better overall, though. I drive it more than I drove the Stirling but they are both beautiful cars.

gtavcustoms,3cohq8,Doktor_Elcaro,2,Thu Jul 9 14:32:02 2015 UTC,"Let me explain, if you're confused. The plate is a reference to The Binding of Isaac, where ??? is a playable character. There is also an item, named 'Fate' that resembles the character's head and gives you wings, and I thought that the wing decals could compliment the blue like it does in the game.  Regardless, it is a beautiful bit of kit, heavily competitive in races and it's just good to look at."

gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,ArizonaIcedOutBoys,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:15:04 2015 UTC,Not really. Like seriously I could go to my relatives house and find $5 in their couches. And to only have to drop that once a month? If you're paying for Xbox Live to play Forza there's no reason you can't drop $5 a month or a $25 one time free for a variety of cars. If you can't afford that you should probably sell your console cause you probably have bigger problems. Sure it's paid DLC. But it's fucking cheap. People just want everything in the world for free.
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,DoubleUTeeEfff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:11:18 2015 UTC,"I don't play on console anymore. I had all of the dlc for forza 4 and then I got the limited edition of horizon. When I saw that the preorder cars were paid dlc just copy pasted over for another 20 dollars when you already purchased them last game, I gave up on that studio. Then they had 300 less cars in forza 5 because it just had to be a launch title. Fuck forza, fuck xbox."
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,ArizonaIcedOutBoys,2,Thu Jul 9 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"It's not Forza's fault for Forza 5. Xbox pressured them into having it as a launch title. They didn't want to but Microsoft kept pressuring them and they ended up with a shitty sequel to Forza 4. Even the lead developer said that Forza 6 will be the true, honorable sequel to Forza 4."
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,DoubleUTeeEfff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"Like I said, sippin that koolaid"
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,ArizonaIcedOutBoys,2,Thu Jul 9 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"Copied and pasted from /r/forza. I mean you can hate on Forza all you want. But it's my favorite racing series and will continue to be, because nothing else compares. If you can't drop the small amount each month for a car pack well then I'm sorry.  ""Forza 5 is not a game T10 wanted to make, I'm thoroughly convinced of that...and also was their sounding board for frustrations at the people who made sure we can't have nice things. Coming off 3 and 4, T10 was tired of being the bad guy. They've wanted since day 1 for the game to be perfectly enjoyable for someone who isn't a racer...a place that celebrated car culture, not just cars. If you wanted to build custom cars and sell 'em, you could. If you wanted to paint designs to sell, you could. If you wanted to hunt for the rarest of the rare, you could. You didn't have to race, which sounds a bit odd in a racing game, but for FM2 and FM4, they managed to pull it off. The economy that allowed all that to happen was sacred to them. They were also very, very, very passionate about making sure that E rating stuck...that just because online was involved, didn't mean that it was no longer something everyone of any age could enjoy. Problem is, in 3 and especially 4, shitheads gonna shit and the rest of us couldn't have nice things as a result. Modded-in credits flooded the system, completely throwing the economy out of whack...to the point where the 'unicorns up for auction' became a honeypot for cheaters, not an actual auction. Design unlocking was rampant, and possession was 10/10ths of the law. You could collaborate with a friend on something, they could slip in a stolen design, and if you sold it, you were the one getting banned. Late in the game's cycle, someone figured out how to screw with the car database itself...leading to everything from 2500hp civics to cars with parts of their meshes deleted or swapped out for another car's [no bumper was pretty popular, as was manufacturer-only rims]. And again, possession was 10/10ths of the law; race one, or sell one, and your ass was grass. The AH was also useful for distributing prize money for leagues and things, which they turned a blind eye to as long as the cash was legitimately acquired...but they were always on the lookout for credit laundering. So come 5, T10 decided to take their ball and go home. Instead of a design storefront, we got that awful 'pay per use' thing. The auction house went away entirely. Everything they worked so hard for got thrown out, all because shitheads did what shitheads do best. Meanwhile, the vocal fanboys were the ones who wanted to be 'special' based on the things they owned in-game, which [when paired with corporate's push for tokens] led to the awful launch-day pay ratios. I was just plain sick of hearing 'BAWWW, too many people have the 330P/Daytona/250GTO, how am I supposed to be special now?' over and over again, and I can only imagine how much it must've gotten on T10's collective nerves. They also lobbied for the current engine swap setup...famous engines, instead of a selection from that same manufacturer, when really there's no reason we couldn't have gotten both. I imagine the 'mass appeal' push was equal parts frustrated customers wanting to come over from Horizon and corporate. On top of that, corporate [read: MS] was hellbent on a couple things. One was that XBO would 'bring the mobile economy to the living room'. Every single launch game had to have some sort of microtrans in it, and overtly so...hence why it went from 'Just in case you're impatient' to 'Which do you want to use' to 'Wouldn't you rather use tokens? Don't forget tokens! $999.99 best deal!'. Another was that every launch game had to push Azure [their cloud computing platform] in some way or another. In FM5's case, it powered the 'training' aspect of the neural nets that power the AIs, crunching the data so you didn't have to play a separate game mode ala FM1 to teach it [which is a shame, that mode was a ton of fun]. Thirdly was the push to use the Metro UI...live tiles, ugly boxes, that sort of thing, not unlike the XBO interface itself. Lastly, corporate was hellbent on having the game for launch, whether it was ready or not...and it most certainly wasn't ready. It was rushed out the door to meet an arbitrary date, and suffered for it big time. On top of it all, they saw how the GT series gets shit for choosing ""This car doesn't look so great"" over ""Where is [insert car here]!"", so went the other route, and didn't get any less of a savaging for it. I've had the pleasure of talking to Dan during the Game with Devs nights; the Dan Greenawalt that was giving interviews defending FM5 was not the Dan I had talked to. The Dan I talked to was more like the one who's giving interviews about 6. He's still toeing a company line, dancing around certain subjects...but you can tell just from comparing them that his heart's in this one."""
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,DoubleUTeeEfff,0,Thu Jul 9 19:13:53 2015 UTC,Like Im gonna even read a line of that.  I would rather drop the money on a quality multiplayer experience like iRacing.
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,ArizonaIcedOutBoys,5,Thu Jul 9 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"forza horizon 2 is my favorite racing game, but I think the new need for speed will take that place once it comes out."
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,4ever1der,2,Thu Jul 9 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"Imo need for speed hasn't been even close to what Forza offers.  I used to play need for speed when I wanted to rice a car and drive like a dick, in Forza I want to fine tune a racing machine. Since pro street the nfs series hasn't been the series I came to know and love.  However horizon filled that gap beautifully, free roam, tons of customization and cars while keeping the racing very entertaining. And if simulators is your thing Motorsport does it Fucking well too.  End rant"

gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,BeastMode797,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:50:08 2015 UTC,Have you seen the videos they've released of it? It is essentially U3
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,TheAsianTroll,0,Wed Jul 8 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"I have seen videos but Underground 3 isn't a confirmed name, hence the ""rumored"" part.  That being said, they better have the 1999 Honda Civic Si in this new one, if it is Underground 3. I decided to challenge myself by beating both current Underground games using just the Honda Civic.   On a slightly related note, this also made me think about why both games are so good: you don't need to use the best cars in the game to win. Even the starting options are viable."
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,BeastMode797,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:43:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised to see a Civic as a cheap early vehicle. And yeah the fact you can upgrade a car enough to keep it competitive is a great aspect of the game

It's not like he has a machine running the laps, he's a human, and those speed differences could most likely just be where he brakes a bit early or doesn't accelerate as much. The T20 is more than likely exactly on par with the Osiris and Zentorno, with the handling being the main difference between the trio."
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,ShawtySayWhaaat,2,Thu Jul 9 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"He usually takes every vehicle on multiple multiple laps, check out the video he makes on how he tests. On top of that, the difference is so minor it doesn't really make a difference, the f20 is only a sliver faster. I may also be mixing him up with someone else on their car testing, but broughy has been pretty reliable, but it still comes down to skill that wins the race, as I have always raced in my bullet and finished podium."
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,wicknest,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:01:43 2015 UTC,handling being better or worse in the t20?
gtavcustoms,3ckd3q,XStreamGamer247,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:27:22 2015 UTC,"The T20 has a ton of braking power, so you can brake really late into a turn and be just fine, but to me it feels like it's not quite as responsive as something like a Turismo-R and Zentorno when it comes to controlling while weaving through traffic. It'll be really good for tracks with a lot of turns, but I don't know how it would be in a long distance highway run."

Its my little love. I remember doing routes in Christmas, when the map was snowed, starting from west coast, all through the forest near river to sandy shores, then from sandy shores to the arounds of military base, going up to the mill and ending in the top of Mt Chilliad... was amazing. By that time, I had my Mesa in white and black.

And also does the removing the spoiler glitch work with the roof on some cars? (Also I'm sure it works with some of the bumpers on cars because I accidentally did that glitch with my ugly smart car lol)  Once again great video dude! Helped heaps!:)
gtavcustoms,3cbaxo,Thatcrazylemur,2,Tue Jul 7 06:18:48 2015 UTC,"BTW it's not double clutching. Double clutching is something you do when you're driving a semi that doesn't have a synchronized transmission. It's basically shifting to neutral in between gears, hitting the clutch twice between shifts as you do so. Idk why people call this double clutching. If you were to double clutch in a regular vehicle it would make it 10x slower..."

gtavcustoms,3cajzs,Blackraider700,2,Mon Jul 6 15:07:22 2015 UTC,"Well, let me put it this way. When the Guardian was released i was imagening it to have a really ""beefy"" disel like motor sound to it but when i acquired it and drove it for the first time i was really surprised to hear the sound that Rockstar gave it a weak ass pick up sound, hell, The Sandking has a better motor noise than the Guardian (In my opinion, the Guardian has the most misleading engine noise in the game). So to get back to your comment, Rockstar tends to really fuck up alot on the way they design a vehicle wether it be its design, mechanics, or sounds so theres no telling what they'll do to the rally car. I believe it will have a similar sound to the Bifta, or Bandit. Maybe a combination of both although there's speculation that it might actually be electric so all is up in the air at this point."
gtavcustoms,3cajzs,Bolt_Up_Bro,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:15:31 2015 UTC,I agree about the Guardian. The best noise for the Rally Fighter would be either the Slamvan or Rat-Truck IMO. Not sure what it sounds like IRL but that's just what I'd like. It will be a massive disappointment if it sounds anything like the Bifta or if it's electric.
gtavcustoms,3cajzs,T-BoneCapone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:56:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's gonna be great. I'm not bothered how it sounds to be frankly honest with you. I just hope it performs well."

gtavcustoms,3bz76m,Revolver559,7,Fri Jul 3 09:58:45 2015 UTC,Not much of a gearhead either but my guess is that the current model of the Coquette seems to be based off of the Chevrolet Corvette 'Sting Ray'. The Coquette Blackfin appears to be a throwback to the Chevrolet Corvette C1.
gtavcustoms,3bz76m,Tomuchan,7,Fri Jul 3 10:50:55 2015 UTC,It's definitely a C1 Vette

gtavcustoms,3bz76m,Claude_and_Misty,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:52:01 2015 UTC,The '62 is similar but it has dual headlights. Your link is a 50's model.

gtavcustoms,3br79c,TheAsianTroll,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on how specific you want to get, but judging by the base models of the osiris, vrigo windsor, and stirling they're completely new. Either way this is an unwinnable battle because neither of us work at R* however it is undeniable that creating the model for a new vehicle (whether it's built off of a blank or pre existing basis) is harder than reskinning, therefore by definition they are not ""lazy""."
gtavcustoms,3br79c,TheAsianTroll,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"I am strictly referring to the vehicles being released in part 2 of ill gotten gains, all of the new vehicles perhaps besides the coil brawler clearly have, at the very least, elements from other vehicles already in game."

Surely that's much easier than adding whole new cars."
gtavcustoms,3br79c,Drando_HS,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:16:03 2015 UTC,"Like you said the clean Rebel was always in the game, they never ""added"" it, they allowed people to buy it instead of finding it on the beach. As for removing the rust. It is simple however I was arguing whether or not they were as you said ""lazy"". I was not arguing whether or not they should do it. My first vehicle was the Rebel, and I would love to see a clean modifiable version come to GTAO."

But you have to admit it, it's kinda stupid for Rockstar to have rusty cars and not a restored or clean model you can find. It should be more like the Vigero in GTA IV, where you could either find a junky one, with bodywork and engine problems, or a clean, like- new model."

Only things I don't prefer is the wheels on the Coquette Classic, the blower on the Rat Loader, and the white walls on the Hotknife. I personally just don't think they fit. But everything else looks awesome. Love how you made the classics look like actual classics and didn't use custom tires on like everything. Up vote from me!"

But for good reason, it's godly and has the best exhaust note in the game.    But... It really depends what you want from the car.  You want to race?  Stirling GT >>> Monroe > Stinger GT.  The Stinger GT is god awful TBH.  Slow, feels very clunky.  Honestly one of the big disappointments in the game for me.    You want it for looks and flexin that bank account in free roam?  That's your own call, but I'd see it Stinger GT > Monroe > Stirling GT."

I don't have any pictures of mine atm, but unlike most people I've met online I havn't done much to it. I've kept mine looking like an original.  The Stinger GT is great fun though. But yeah, no classic has anything on the Stirling."

The cost doesn't matter so much because you will probs find a hacker online to give you 10mil anyways.

If you had to hold me to one and only one, then I would pick the Casco.  The Stinger GT feels heavier, it doesn't corner as tightly as I would like and it's a bit drifty if you're not careful. But in a straight-away it is king and in a pinch the Stinger makes for a pretty decent battering ram.  The Casco feels much lighter, it devours corners and with a fair bit of practice you can put the car into a four wheel slide around a corner with confidence because the car is super responsive. It doesn't have the weight to throw around like the GT but it also doesn't have the power to go with it."

gtavcustoms,3aymaq,arms-dealer,2,Wed Jun 24 19:50:04 2015 UTC,"According to what I've read, if you're on next-gen, the most recent update made any Hotknife that you purchase now come without fenders."
gtavcustoms,3aymaq,shit-post,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"Vehicle options such as the hotknife's fenders, where all options just change the part but none remove them, can be glitched off by first purchasing one of the non-stock options, then hold scroll up or scroll down in that part's menu(you should see the part start disappearing at least temporarily) and you want to try and get it timed right so the selector lands on stock when you let go of up or down.  Now buy that invisible stock option and the part should now be completely gone but it will still have a collision mesh like it's there. I did every single part on my panto like this and it now looks like a glitchy little rally car."

gtavcustoms,3av9b8,Thatcrazylemur,3,Wed Jun 24 00:07:19 2015 UTC,Shoot the bottom of the brake rotor until the car drops twice. You CANNOT have bullet proof tires on.
gtavcustoms,3av9b8,etp23,3,Wed Jun 24 02:13:56 2015 UTC,"PS: If you already know how to use Charles proxy, you can remove bulletproof tyres by changing the value of 11:1 to 11:0. I was fucking overjoyed when I found that the other day."
gtavcustoms,3av9b8,welchy720,2,Wed Jun 24 19:40:06 2015 UTC,There's mods out there and as Blackraider700 said there's a little trick you can do by shooting the rims/rotors if you don't have bulletproof tires. I find using a low power gun (AP pistol or Assault rifle) with a suppressor has worked out best in not blowing up the car and attracting unwanted attention.

TL DR anyway stirling is one of the best thats true, but i dont like these one side phrases :)"
gtavcustoms,3auj5w,Ramses_L_Smuckles,3,Wed Jun 24 13:04:31 2015 UTC,"Fastest on short curvy tracks, long curvy tracks, and short straight tracks.  3 out of 4 is pretty conclusive for fastest.  Most of the cars don't have big differences, it's true, but the Pigalle, the Z Type, and now the Stirling drive much differently than most of the class.  The Pigalle handles well and has decent acceleration, the Z Type has incredible top speed, and the Stirling has great traction and acceleration.  Edit: You also shouldn't go by the stats shown in LS Customs or on the car purchase web sites.  They're not accurate at all."
gtavcustoms,3auj5w,Bounkass,3,Wed Jun 24 14:36:33 2015 UTC,"Just depends what you like really. I'd probably choose the Stinger GT as I haven't owned one recently, or just get both if you can afford them/have the garage space."
gtavcustoms,3auj5w,Bounkass,2,Tue Jun 23 18:21:33 2015 UTC,Looks fantastic. Is this height achievable with lowering with the in-game suspension it or did you use mods or something?

As someone who is Allah who studies Akbars, I am telling you, specifically, in Allah, no one calls allah akhbars Allahu Akbars. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""allah family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Akbars, which includes things from planes to car bombs to RPGs. So your reasoning for calling a allah akhbar an Allahu Akbar is because random people ""call the black ones evil?"" Let's get Sikhs and Buddhists in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how the Qu'uran works. They're both. An allah akhbar is an allah akhbar and a member of the Allah family. But that's not what you said. You said an allah akhbar is a Allahu Akbar, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Allah family akhbars, which means you'd call bombs, guns, mortars, and other weapons Allahu Akbars, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

gtavcustoms,3apeid,_Trilobite_,0,Mon Jun 22 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"Hello young fellow. It appears to me that you are currently displeased with the situation. What is it, that is making your life so difficult at this moment? Is it perhaps caused by the recent roasting of your jeromes that so suddenly occured? I must say that this roasting is undeniably the strongest since the 2000 hoax. Do you have the slightest clue of why this particular roasting of your walters was so powerful? No? Well... I can for sure tell you the currently disclosed reason for this significant event. It was, in fact, ME who caused your displeasement. I can hear you trying to comprehend how is this possible. But, and I'm sure about this, you cannot process what has happened to you because it is far too complex for your understanding. Even God himself cannot fully understand this despicable and devilish work of trickery. It took me a lifetime to fully write out my evil plan and another to understand it. The complexity is even higher than that of a 14-faced dodecahedron. It all starts out with the day of this legendary ruse. The day of rusement so carefully planned and calculated on this exact day. The day where an astronomical constellation appeared that will never occur for another 35 eons. A constellation that has generated a powerful antimatter pool. This antimatter black hole does not only suck in matter, however. This antimatter black hole sucks in the well being of everyone living on this planet. But did you see anyone feel bad today? No? You see, my young fellow, that is because I have perfectly engineered an antimatter pool thats power is focused on you. It took me 15 years to construct this extremely complex lens and I had to combine the power of God with this lens to give it the ultimate focus. But enough with the past. As I'm not some novice ruseman, I have planned even more, a device of trickery sprinkled with lies and logical fallacies, meant to corrupt you and send you into a pit of despair. With my ruseman insticts, I sensed that you were typing your reply to the displeasing content you have viewed. At the exact moment you pressed the left button on your mouse, clicking send, you unleashed the machine of displeasure and ""not well being"". A machine that, once started, cannot ever be stopped. Not by anyone. Not even God himself. While your comment rushed through cyberspace you started to feel bad. Something in your brain was screaming but you just didn't listen. It was destiny that you fall for my trickery. You should have thought before you foolishly sent that comment to me. But what heightens the intensity of your mistake is that you unwittingly decided to argue with a MASTER RUSEMAN GRADE 5."

gtavcustoms,3apeid,Thatcrazylemur,2,Mon Jun 22 13:49:36 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"

gtavcustoms,3apeid,Cman1200,2,Mon Jun 22 15:12:40 2015 UTC,"Bean Bag Buccaneers is a two player children's game, the object of which is to pick up your treasure chest on the central island and sail back safely.  Each player has a giant sailing ship as their main game piece. Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.  To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.  This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s."

Your statement ""I have no problem getting laid when I want to, have three girls off the top of my head I know for certain I could call at pretty much any time."" is a common one, especially online. But could you say you could walk into a club and have hot girls, young ones, with perfect hourglass figures, beautiful plump breasts, tight cute little asses, be gazing at you wishing they could sleep with you? Flirting with you aggressively?  Or do you have to put in good effort to get laid, even if you can do it consistently. Therein lies the big difference.  Now imagine this is all true. How could it be stated without sounding narcissistic? It can't. So, that character judgement is irrelevant here, assuming I'm telling the truth, which I am.  As for sexual addiction, what if there is nothing actually wrong with me, and I'm simply not designed for monogamy? I don't use porn, I don't use prostitutes, I don't even masturbate much."

I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for. Thanks."

How to get the rose-gold paint job.   Put gold (metal) as your primary color. Go to the metallic paint section for primary after you paint it gold. Just hover over the metallic paints and do not buy. Back out and go to plates.  Change your plate and go back to respray. Go to the pearlescent section and scroll down to Salmon pink. apply & enjoy.

I'm decent at racing but not outstanding and I still manage to beat a lot of Zentornos and Osiris's. The Turismo's main downfall though is that it's so light and spins out very easily.  The Massacro Racecar is a must-have for any racer though! I think it would do well in a race against supers."

One of the least expensive, fastest, easiest to drive, and probably the coolest looking. The Stirling GT is my DD, simply because it looks fantastic, drives great, and sounds even better. Armored Kuruma is a must own for reasons that are obvious of you frequently play missions or heists. The Elegy RH8 is the fastest sports car, and it is very competitively priced. And finally, a car I couldn't live without; The Pegassi Vacca. Something about the Vacca is so charismatic. It feels like a proper Lamborghini. It's loud, brash, and mean, but surprisingly controllable around corners. With its short wheel base and moderately low power it won't win any drag races against its big brothers the Zentorno or the Osiris, but you will be having way more fun. Good luck deciding on your new cars, dude!"

I also did complete circuits of the entire map (going main motorways the whole way) and it was 10-12 seconds faster every time.

A dream car for me, it was designed to replicate the styling of American muscle cars but save on fuel on production costs, so as to appeal to an international market. At this point Japanese automakers were pretty unabashed about copying American and European designs, and the end result was something of GTA amalgamation in real life. This generation of Skyline initiated the double circle taillights that carry over to this day, appearing on the GT-R and Infiniti G35/Skyline (albeit much more subtly).

Stand at the front of the car and use the Heavy Sniper to shoot at the seam above each tire.   The first shot should pop the rear panel up a bit, then the next shot over the other rear tire should pop it up more.   Then aim on the underside of the body panel to 'push' the panel open even more.

I love the modelling of the car but it is not exactly quick. If I recall it is the 2nd slowest coupe due to poor acceleration however it is quick in a straight line. If you dont care too much about performance then by all means pick one up but note it will not win you races

Drift around corners like a boss, while maintaining a stunning look and a good top speed.  and then the sneaky dream-to-drive Blista Compact! I stole one of these while fucking around with a mate, and was instantly surprised by how fun it was to drive.   It's front wheel drive and tiny with a decent top speed. just Turbo-charge it and you'll have a great little car, with light handbreaking it's a seriously good racer. I love using it in impromptu races and winning against muscles and sports.  Everyone has a Zentorno, but it IS a great car. Kuruma is great for money making, lets you rush missions with ease. Both of those are good cars but very common.  Karin Sultan is a great start-up car. You can find it in the streets so it's ""free"" to get. It has 4 doors, and 40/60 FWD/RWD drive that gives it very good handling and a good top speed. The Kuruma also has this 4WD system. The Sultan is also nostalgic to some since it can be modded to look like a car from GTA 4.  A car people seem to not enjoy is the Coquette. It was my first car and I love it to bits. It's got great acceleration, handling and top speed for a rather cheap price. Fairly moddable as well."

gtavcustoms,39d5ur,Mid_1010,2,Thu Jun 11 03:36:59 2015 UTC,"I initially noticed that too, but the stats bar is just glitching out; the traction +/- sometimes shows up on the bar if you go in and out of the spolier menu, and it definitely shows up when you go to remove the spare.  Those stat bars aren't trustworthy anyway though. The real proof is in the driving, and with the Stirling the ""spoiler"" makes the difference between class-leading Sports Classic and 2nd tier Sports (Banshee/Carbonizzare/Alpha) lap time territory. Corners like it's on rails.  Edit: typo"

For the $2,000,000 price tag it should have vastly better performance than either the Zentorno or Adder. It is slower than the Adder and has less acceleration than the Zentorno.

gtavcustoms,39ck9h,tomjonesrocks,2,Wed Jun 10 21:54:14 2015 UTC,Agreed. And you can get bumped off the track easier racing than in the Zentorno.   Only benefit is the bill you stick other players with if they blow you up - but even that won't happen a lot as you're so vulnerable in it.   Disappointed as well.
gtavcustoms,39ck9h,mr1jon2,2,Wed Jun 10 23:25:21 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, it's a nice mix of the Zentorno, Turismo and Entity.  Pretty good at everything, not great.    In my brain though, I can't get past the notion that the Osiris costs a little less than all 3 of those other supers combined and that for any given race track, one of those other super cars would be better fit than the Osiris."

gtavcustoms,39ck9h,T-BoneCapone,2,Thu Jun 11 06:09:01 2015 UTC,The Stirling GT stood out by a mile for me. Fast and nimble and it's great at drifting (even though I suck at it in any other car) but it can hold it together around corners when you want it to. It's great off-road too. And don't get me started on how it sounds! That noise when you lift off the gas HHHNNNNGGGHHH!  For me it was between the Osiris and Stirling for which I was going to buy but after trying them both in SP it was no contest. The Osiris is ok but the Stirling is 10 times more fun for half the money.
gtavcustoms,39ck9h,Un-trollable,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:34:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know but the Osiris feels kinda slow. The Stirling on the other hand is a beast! Windsor is just as I expected it to be. Slow, heavy and over steer but I love the liveries"
gtavcustoms,39ck9h,LeFunkwagen,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:10:30 2015 UTC,"Love both the Stirling and the Windsor.  Stirling is easily the best handling sports classic, and likely fastest too. If not fastest, it's equal to the Z-type (note: the speedo reading on the ztype is completely inaccurate), but completely dominates it in terms of handling.  The Windsor is great. With it fully tuned up, its quite fast and handles really well for what it is, which is basically a building on wheels. Its seriously heavy and it hits really hard. Can't think of another car which can shove other cars out of the way as well as the windsor, Ignoring the armoured kuruma. Its easy to stay under control in a drift, as well.   Both of those cars are definitely on my favourite list, along with the alpha, z-type, and jester."
gtavcustoms,39ck9h,kankaswag,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"the osiris is officially the fastest car in the game, not by much compared to zentorno but still the fastest, the windsor is disappointing in terms of speed but its ok because it looks cool, the stirling is the fastest sport classic car now, the virgo is shit"
gtavcustoms,39ck9h,Mid_1010,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:18:44 2015 UTC,"The Osiris is one of the fastest supercars, but it has understeer. I think it accelerates faster than anything else. The Stirling is also a hell of a lot faster than any other sports classic, and it broke that whole class. You used to be on the pace in a Z Type, Pigalle, Coquette Classic, or Casco and could win if you were decent, but now it's all Stirling GT... The other two are not that great though, but they look good IMO."

It's much more active with the vehicle threads and has a ton more people who are actually good at taking photos and editing them.  Most of us are more active there than here.

It depends what threads you go on what subsections and such. Like if anything related to bitching and moaning, glitches, freeroam k/d and dlc will probably have an average age of 10-15. It's usually not as bad on the car thread since most of them are regulars, any of the non GTA:O sections are usually fine too.

gtavcustoms,3909n8,Thatcrazylemur,3,Mon Jun 8 08:38:48 2015 UTC,"P1800 was actually my initial thought when they announced the Casco. I think it's something about the placement and size of the headlights/signals, the thick chrome surrounding the grille, and honestly maybe more than anything, the lack of a huge badge in the middle of the grille.  Overall though it's a far better match for the 3500 GT. My guess is that Volvo engineers liked what the Italians were up to and took inspiration from it.  That said, I wouldn't argue if R* decided to give us a P1800ES style shooting brake version of the Casco."
gtavcustoms,3909n8,smojzore,6,Mon Jun 8 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"I can see your train of thought, but I'll argue that the Casco is closer to the Maserati 3500GT. The vents are in nearly the same place, and the roof shape is too square to be a P60. The single piece front bumper and the grille being a rounded rectangle rather than an oval just finishes off the argument.    But I will argue that the indicators are closer to the P60, mind."
gtavcustoms,3909n8,DreadZer0,2,Mon Jun 8 10:58:48 2015 UTC,"youre right. its the same story with the stinger gt imo. even though theres a lot of shelby daytona coupe going on the subtle similarities are what make it more of a ferrari. plus the engine note of the casco and stinger gt, paired with the manufacturer names are what makes them both italian"

gtavcustoms,38x7wr,barelyblurred,2,Mon Jun 8 08:37:57 2015 UTC,"Try out the Osiris in SP, if that is good then try that, if not I would recommend the Turismo. I own all of the top 3, the Zentorno, Entity, and Turismo, and the Turismo surprised me with how great it was and it has the best value for a top end supercar by far. The only problem is I don't like the front that much but that doesn't matter when I am racing and sometimes it can not go over curbs which is a major disadvantage because of how low it is, so don't lower it and it should not happen often. That car driven well can yield some pretty good results. For example, I did an endurance race on a track with no curbs to worry about, and without any practice and using a Keyboard, I was the highest placed non-Zentorno. I noticed while racing that the Turismo has great acceleration, especially if you mid-drive speed boost, and it is very easy to be consistent with. This track was fairly difficult and I watched many cars fall off cliffs, but I only had 1 small incident the whole 50 minute race. Definitely was surprised by it's performance and I understand why so many people drive the Turismo."

As for the Stirling GT...If people raced sports classics more, I'd get one - but i've only seen about 2 SC races since the PC release, so i'll pass there too.  Meanwhile, I still want to see a Club, GTA IV's Super GT, GTA IV's Turismo, the ZR-350 (or modernized into a RX-8, ideally), a modernized Euros, GTA:SA's Elegy (never liked the GTR, would rather have an R32), a Hermes, a Hustler, GTA IV's Tampa or a Uranus (with cosworth options) before I'll consider overhauling my garages."

gtavcustoms,38x7wr,Thatcrazylemur,3,Mon Jun 8 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"Well the Z Type is the best, so I bought one, but the Pigalle is much better value and is second. It's also front wheel drive, so it's much better through the corners, and it is good enough to win against a Z Type in a technical circuit, but if you are doing something like The Commute, the Z Type will win because it's the fastest car in the game in a straight line. For my second character though, I use the Coquette Classic but I rarely win. It's a fun car to drive, but I don't feel it is as competitive because it slides EVERYWHERE. There is also no spoiler, which makes matters worse.. It's still very fun to drive though, great for cruising. It has great acceleration though if you mid drive speed boost. I find that my driving style caters towards oversteer-y cars with acceleration, and I tend to do well with cars like the Comet which are usually very difficult to race competitively. The Coquette is a bit TOO slidey for me, though. I think overall though, the best choice is the Pigalle. If you have a ton of cash though, and don't mind driving a boat around the track, try the Z Type. I love the Z Type and you can definitely win races with it, even if the race is not just a drag.  Oh, also the Stinger GT is exactly the same as the Stinger, sadly. Buying the GT does not mean you have a faster car. If you want more info, watch Broughy1322's fastest cars in GTA V series. He tested every car, stock and fully modded, on a circuit with a good mix of straights and corners, so you can use his findings to confidently make decisions on racing cars."

Then just record a quick clip and load it in Rockstar Editor so you are able to get fine camera control. After I take screenshots, I do a few steps of post processing photoshop and that's it. Not 4k though, sorry."

gtavcustoms,38uihc,tunawhitenocrustt,-1,Sun Jun 7 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"Right, so that means the sub is totally fine and normal."
gtavcustoms,38uihc,TheAsianTroll,2,Sun Jun 7 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"Em, Guys.  You're both getting downvoted because no one knows what the fuck is going on.   Can't see any of the vehicles, except one.  White walls on a dirt bike. No.    That's kind of the point, since it presents a scene. It's not my bike. That's the point of being part of the scene, you do what you want."

It's basically a place where fat people who encourage that behavior are shamed for it. Most people think it's just pics of random fat people, but the pics are usually evidence of hypocrisy in fat people's excuses. Example: ""My fat doesn't affect anyone"" when they're almost literally spilling into the occupied seat next to them on a plane.  Most people think its a toxic place, and to an extent, it is. The only people who hate the sub and actively complain about it (like Thatcrazylemur) are people who are offended by the shaming that goes on there."

The stock chrome rims on both look really good, and IMO the bumpers/skirts available look like cheap body kits you'd see on a riced Accord, so minimalism is a good look for both."

gtavcustoms,38lrlc,4ever1der,2,Fri Jun 5 18:46:23 2015 UTC,"Check /r/HeistTeams you'll find better help there.   Also I'm not sure what you mean by    100% cut and carry that cash they have so whatever they drop that will come from their cut not others. Now you may be thinking ""oh this is a f*ckin scam"" you can think that way while others will join and get their money and you miss out on a sweet dollar.   since the only heist you can lose money from is the Pacific Standard Job. Just play it smart and use the Armored Kuruma, there's a good write-up on /r/gtaonline,  and if it goes smooth you'll lose very little and easily still have $1.15M+. In my heist group I'm the carrier and each time we've done it I've only lost a max of $40K, with a couple times losing $0.  Edit: Here's the write-up.   Just make sure one person takes all the money. Have the driver buy 0604 Las Lagunas ($126k) and put their Armored Kuruma that apartment's garage. One person collects all the money. The money carrier stays back when still in the bank, and in the middle when moving in the alley. Once at the bikes, everyone on a bike, then off the bike, and jump the wall to the apartment door, where the apartment owner enters through the apartment door and brings nearby players in with them. Then the driver goes brings everyone to the garage, and get in the Armored Kuruma. Profit.   In all honesty, doing it this way the payouts don't have to be 100% to one person. Its a team effort this way. Now if it was the bikes way, then yea, if the cash carrier fucks up on a bike then it's on their head, but the alleyway is still on everyone, not just the carrier.  And the only way I'd participate with 100% cuts for Pacific Standard is if everyone aside from you got their 100% cut before you, and you're last. If the others leave, after they get their 100%, it wouldn't  impact you. But if you start with the 100%, everyone else gets impacted if you leave.

Things is that i just couldn¬¥t follow the same path that u/mattverso drove with his Bodhi. Just couldn¬¥t, got stuck in same slopes that Bodhi went up without a problem.  My solution was to sell Guardian and use that money to buy and fully upgrade Bodhi. Even had some money left to make it rain. Then i went almost exact course up to Mt. Josiah.   Can you guess what happened?  It was up there without any issues, Bodhi just flies uphill where i miserably struggled with Guardian.  Guardian is great street truck, but when you¬¥re seriously climbing it¬¥s definately not good."

I have tested every single offroad vehicle on a course designed to strain even the best and the guardian was one of the best performers. If you have a different opinion whatever but with the people I've off-roaded with (all 120 of them) I have yet to see a bodhi outperform any of the decent offroaders.

gtavcustoms,387smk,grinder_man,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:12:46 2015 UTC,Looks like I'm getting rid of my guardian...
gtavcustoms,387smk,ch1k3n123,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:12:41 2015 UTC,Oh yeah that's just because of the driver.
gtavcustoms,387smk,Thatcrazylemur,2,Tue Jun 2 18:41:53 2015 UTC,"Not really, it's just not very good at climbing mountains. Way too top-heavy. Way too heavy in general. Loads of power though.   I have one myself, I just don't take it up the mountains anymore, after I learned how bad it is compared to my other trucks."
gtavcustoms,387smk,Thatcrazylemur,-1,Tue Jun 2 15:35:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much you offroad, but I know for a fact that I've tested every single offroad vehicle in every offroad situation in preparation of the Off-Road Tour. The guardian is by far the best truck for mountain climbing. The bodhi is also probably the worst pick up truck other than the dune loader, bison, and Sadler for offroad situations. One reason why you may have this opinion is possibly because you used the trail on the east side. Is that how you climbed chilliad?"
gtavcustoms,387smk,Thatcrazylemur,2,Tue Jun 2 15:56:25 2015 UTC,"I off-road a lot actually. I have an entire off-road garage with pretty much every truck/buggy in it. The Sandking is the best, in my opinion. The Bodhi isn't the best, but it's my favourite.   The Guardian is just way too heavy. It gets stuck where other trucks will keep going, and it falls over too much. Not as bad as the Merryweather Mesa but still not great."
gtavcustoms,387smk,Tal_S,0,Tue Jun 2 16:50:40 2015 UTC,"The Guardian is extremely heavy but weight doesn't directly corrilate to instability or traction in this game. The sandking (especially the XL) Rolls a lot more because it's higher off the ground and the weight is very concentrated in the mid cab. It also has a lot less traction than the guardian. If you take the northern crests in any truck the guardian will make it the farthest, and the sandking will be one of the first to go because of how rigid the suspension is. Also the AWD front to rear drive ratio is extremely rear heavy I'd say about 15 front 85 rear."
gtavcustoms,387smk,Thatcrazylemur,4,Tue Jun 2 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"I'm looking straight at the vehicle handling data and it's not correlating with what you say. The Sandking has a 35/65 front/rear split, exactly the same as the Guardian.   The Guardian has almost 1.6 times the mass of the Sandking with exactly the same drive force, so it had less pulling power overall. Their traction stats are identical. The suspension stats show the Sandking bump damping/rebound is much softer, and less bouncy.  Statistics aside, if you say you prefer the Guardian, I'll believe you, but don't claim it to be superior to the Sandking when the actual game files say otherwise."

gtavcustoms,37onm6,Testa_Inc,1 point,Fri May 29 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"its easily recognizable as a Pontiac Firebird. many people are going to want to model it as closely as they can to that, and theres nothing wrong with the fact that it simply looks great in those color combinations. i personally enjoy being unique, but i still stay realistic. im not throwing bright green, pink, chrome all over each car. ive had my Phoenix for quite a while and it had been sitting with its solid white paint job for a while as well until i took it out and gave it some fresh paint today. metallic black with gold(copper) stripes just like in the picture, and Dukes rims with a stock alloy color. stock grille, roof, and spoiler with a simple big bore exhaust."

gtavcustoms,37kwza,catoholmlund,2,Thu May 28 15:15:17 2015 UTC,It's so useful in missions. When I'm playing with friends I leave it in the garage and do things the hard/fun way. But with randoms when you're just grinding cash or whatever you often end up basically doing missions solo. The Karuma is pretty handy there.
gtavcustoms,37kwza,zdelusion,0,Thu May 28 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"IMO the only setup that the Kuruma is a huge benefit is the Valkyrie mission in the Humane series. The armored car makes that mission so much less of a PITA, every time I've done it without some guy tries to rambo his way through and dies before he even gets to the warehouse.  It is interesting seeing people's reactions in free roam though. At first they think I'm just another armoured Kuruma kiddie and run away/try to kill me but then they see the lack of armour. Some stop trying to kill me, others keep trying."

DO NOT put Bullet Proofing on the tires. Stancing will not work then. I normally shoot a few inches below the middle of the rim to keep from hitting the gas tanks on some cars that would blow up with direct shots to the middle of the rims otherwise. Just have to be careful your not too low and pop a tire, then you'll have to repair and start over.  This guy explains stancing and popping hoods/trunks.  Nice video too. Good music."

I don't really see where people are coming from with this whole promotion thing, this isn't exactly a large sub so there's not really a reason for them to be advertising anything. It's a style choice that unifies all his work while simultaneously adding a layer of protection from lazy assholes who can't take ten minutes to take their own screenshots. Sure they can be 'shopped out easily in most cases, but if you're lazy enough to steal it there's a good chance you're too lazy to edit it or don't have access to/knowledge of Photoshop.  Again, asking for permission and giving credit is one thing, just taking it without permission or giving credit is a totally different situation."

gtavcustoms,37bn3q,Mr_Astly,-1,Tue May 26 22:38:26 2015 UTC,Except those are very rarely opaque. This one has zero transparency and it's the brightest thing in the image.   Plus it's floating around in random spaces instead of sticking to the corners. And it just generally tends to be in places that draw your eyes away from the car and to the watermark.   It breaks all of the basic rules of how to use a watermark in photography. Even the shitty companies that plaster it on in tiles to make sure you buy it put it at about half or 1/3 transparency.
gtavcustoms,37bn3q,marcelothefellow,2,Tue May 26 23:21:52 2015 UTC,plaster it on in tiles to make sure you buy    How does ensuring your content isn't stolen make you a shitty company?

Lampadati is the in game version of maserati.  According to the GTA wiki page:   The Felon is inspired by the¬†fifth generation Maserati Quattroporte¬†as seen by its overall design,¬†greenhouse area¬†and side profile. Some of its details are inspired by the¬†Jaguar XF, such as a XF-R front fascia, large thin vertical wheel vents, front and rear lights, and rear chrome.¬†The Felon's features also take cues from the¬†second generation Saab 9-5as seen on the front end. The car's taillights have a resemblance to the¬†Tesla Model S.   To sum up although I agree that it looks more like a jaguar, rockstar say it looks more like a maserati."

gtavcustoms,378gyy,tunawhitenocrustt,2,Mon May 25 21:25:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, set the metal you want, then go to metallic paints and just look at one, then back out of paints and change anything on the car (like a plate), and then go back into the paints menu, click pearlescent, and it will apply it over the metal.

gtavcustoms,379ztp,laziecalvin,2,Tue May 26 02:04:22 2015 UTC,I really hate how Rockstar added overfenders to several cars and didn't even bother fixing the wheel offset.

gtavcustoms,379ztp,SMN_Design,1 point,Tue May 26 23:02:11 2015 UTC,If they fixed the wheel offset they'd poke through the fenders more.
gtavcustoms,379ztp,mattverso,1 point,Tue May 26 23:20:23 2015 UTC,"Well I'm sure they didn't really set the cars up so they work/look normal when you shoot the suspension out. Just another reason why they should've given us offset and camber options. Or just made the overfenders actually make sense, I mean really why put overfenders if you're not fitting wider wheels..?"
gtavcustoms,379ztp,SMN_Design,1 point,Tue May 26 23:26:08 2015 UTC,Just another reason why they should've given us offset and camber options   And the #1 reason they haven't? Because it's GTA not Midnight Club. Unfortunately.
gtavcustoms,379ztp,mattverso,1 point,Tue May 26 23:35:47 2015 UTC,"Is Midnight Club even relevant anymore? Haven't heard anything about it since LA. Either way, just having wheel options still shouldn't be near the level of customization the next MC game should have if there is going to be another. NFS went the simcade route for the Shift games, there wasn't offset but there was everything else. Even Forza 5, Horizon 2, and GT6 don't have offset for whatever reason. Imagine the uproar there'd be if Rockstar was the one to implement it in GTA of all games."

gtavcustoms,376xu6,CaptainPower-SOF,1 point,Mon May 25 15:33:35 2015 UTC,Yup. Cars you bought have no cooldown
gtavcustoms,376xu6,mattverso,5,Mon May 25 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"It's 48 minutes, not 45. 48 minutes is equivalent to one in-game day (2 minutes = one hour in-game).

I feel like parking the cars in there at an angle isn't really space efficient. I've always wondered how many more parking spaces there could be if you had the option to park them at a few different options. Lines going from door to computer area. Or backed straight in on the sides with spaces in between. Or show stance which would be the current configuration. Obvious consequences if you load it with cars, then try to change to show stance would apply. You're losing cars. So choose wisely."

I had sold a car from this garage, then stole the Sabre you see here off the street and put a tracker on it before putting it in the garage. When I put it in the garage it told me I needed to move a car to storage despite having just sold a car from in here. So I go to the selection screen to choose which car to move to storage and the Sabre is listed twice. Went in and out of the garage a few times and it made me ""Select a car to storage"" every time. Then I got in a different car, pressed the accelerator to leave the garage and ended up just driving forward. At that point I could move any of the cars in the garage. Super weird."

gtavcustoms,36ntfi,MeltyB,1 point,Thu May 21 12:39:50 2015 UTC,On paper the Z-Type is quicker but the Pigalle will absolutely destroy it through corners. It out-brakes it massively.  inb4 Broughy1322  I'm strongly considering getting a Pigalle.
gtavcustoms,36ntfi,Thatcrazylemur,1 point,Wed May 20 22:50:13 2015 UTC,"I have both, I race both, each has their own strong points (and both have exquisite engine/exhaust notes). The Pigalle is better at certain tracks but overall, if I could only have one, it'd be the Z-Type. The acceleration and top speed more than make up for any shortcomings."

gtavcustoms,36l55j,SunnyEddie,5,Wed May 20 04:47:32 2015 UTC,probably closer to like 800k. everything is always more than you think.
gtavcustoms,36l55j,tunawhitenocrustt,5,Wed May 20 10:40:28 2015 UTC,But you think it's going to be 800k. That means it must be One Mil... But then that's what I think. Shit.
gtavcustoms,36l55j,Thatcrazylemur,6,Wed May 20 12:00:36 2015 UTC,R* knew that they made a mistake when the beach bum dlc was entirely free. they bumped the prices up for the high life but mustve realised that the massacro and huntley s were great value and no one was buying shark cards - thats why everything in the 'im not a hipster' update was so stupidly expensive - a smart car for $80k? an amc pacer for $150k? its fucking ridiculous
gtavcustoms,36l55j,tunawhitenocrustt,2,Wed May 20 12:10:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that, I think they just weren't pushing the same kind of business model back then. The Beach Bum pack would have been very close to the original release, so it wouldn't have made any real odds to them how much money they could make off of the DLC cost. Changes like this happen because people in high places are questioning why the devs aren't earning a continual stream of revenue. They'll be given quotas to meet and this is their way of doing it."
gtavcustoms,36l55j,Thatcrazylemur,5,Wed May 20 12:33:30 2015 UTC,Beach Bum was kinda marketed as though everything was free to make up for the heists being delayed initially.
gtavcustoms,36l55j,Oggie243,2,Wed May 20 15:02:32 2015 UTC,That's another good point.
gtavcustoms,36l55j,Thatcrazylemur,2,Wed May 20 15:05:37 2015 UTC,"No one really knows for sure yet. If I had to guess, I'd say June or July. And the gullwing will probably be in the same ballpark as the Stinger GT and Stinger Topless."
gtavcustoms,36kq6t,SunnyEddie,9,Wed May 20 02:31:30 2015 UTC,"You buy them more for the sound, looks and feel than bring able to outrun people.

The Stinger GT is a great drive and quite the looker."

With that said, once the coquette classic is fully upgraded you could have easily invested $850,000. I personally bought it, then drove it a few times and sold it. It's nothing mind blowing, it does sound good though. Try and find a friend who already owns one and would be willing to give you a test drive."

gtavcustoms,36fxb5,_Trilobite_,2,Fri May 22 23:22:10 2015 UTC,I got beat in my Vacca three times by a dude in a Zentorno. At one point he was weaving side to side all over the road on front of me doing skids and I could barely even keep up

gtavcustoms,36fxb5,cats_rule_dogs_suck,2,Tue May 19 21:02:22 2015 UTC,"And the point is that if you know how to drive it, and the Zen driver or Turismo driver (etc) also know how to drive their car equally well, then those cars will beat it.  The big advantage of the Vacca is that it's behaviour is pretty consistent, so that beginners can learn it more quickly.

gtavcustoms,36f1f1,Thatcrazylemur,7,Mon May 18 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you. I debated a long time and finally said fuck it, it's just the internet"
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,Thatcrazylemur,-6,Mon May 18 22:15:39 2015 UTC,"I can understand because this is like the least hostile sub related to GTAV, but yeah it's not really an appropriate post. I feel like it may actually get attention in the main GTAV sub though, it's pretty funny."
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,DramDemon,2,Mon May 18 22:23:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you are joking or not, but the rules don't explicitely say it has to be a custom vehicle, and he's just making a joke."
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,Thatcrazylemur,-8,Mon May 18 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"Rules  All content must be directly related to cars/driving in Grand Theft Auto V.   The fuck's your beef?  And the subreddit is called GTAV customs, for fuck's sake. Are you fucking with me?"
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,DramDemon,2,Mon May 18 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"Again, I didn't know if you were joking or not, no beef here. It was a joke post, just like one of the top posts to this sub that has a truck pulling a cargobob. Was that a custom truck? It was funny, no reason to say it doesn't belong here."
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,Thatcrazylemur,-5,Mon May 18 22:35:37 2015 UTC,"I guess you could argue they customised the Cargobob to make it black. I'm surprised that got so much attention, it honestly doesn't belong in this sub. It's a cool picture, once again, but not really meant for this sub. Then again, the rules may have been different when it was posted."
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,DramDemon,2,Mon May 18 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"No, it was just a funny picture. At least this one is poking fun at trying to customize a vehicle. No reason it doesn't belong here, it's not like someone just posted a picture of the sky or their apartment."
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,Thatcrazylemur,-1,Mon May 18 23:00:22 2015 UTC,It literally breaks the first rule of the sub. Just drop it.
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,DramDemon,0,Mon May 18 23:06:26 2015 UTC,"And yet, it's still here. Even being upvoted."
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,telefight,0,Tue May 19 01:25:12 2015 UTC,"How is that justification for the post?  The undeniable fact is that it breaks the first rule of the subreddit. It does not belong, and /u/gtuned nailed it."
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,gtuned,2,Tue May 19 02:00:37 2015 UTC,What did I do exactly
gtavcustoms,36f1f1,Pwilson44,1 point,Tue May 19 02:05:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, most post on this sub are just people posting a picture of a cool scenic area with like the headlight of their car showing. Or just the car at night so all you see are headlights. At least I can see this car jet vehicle."

gtavcustoms,36ei14,MeltyB,2,Mon May 18 21:33:57 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! I was obsessed with Hot Wheels as a wee lad so I got some inspiration from those. And OCD helps a little too! :D
gtavcustoms,36ei14,Thatcrazylemur,8,Wed May 20 14:20:00 2015 UTC,i like the sultan's paint scheme.  really clean

Just so you know, you've got the glitched version of the ruffian than has both headlight options merged into one. Look closely and you'll see what I mean. I used to have one but swapped it for a dual headlight version. Here's what the normal single headlight model looks like."

gtavcustoms,36guro,KeyczV,5,Tue May 19 07:58:44 2015 UTC,I would not link a random account that a stranger has control over.   You can make a throwaway PSN account and link that.
gtavcustoms,36guro,evlwaz,3,Tue May 19 11:39:57 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you need to boot up the game with a linked social club account.
gtavcustoms,36guro,Thatcrazylemur,3,Tue May 19 11:38:46 2015 UTC,"Quick question, do the stallion, blista compact and dukes not spawn normally in traffic for returning players? Can't I just join a lobby with a returning player and then take one of the cars if they spawn?"
gtavcustoms,36guro,Testa_Inc,4,Tue May 19 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"They do spawn (albeit somewhat rarely), but like high-end vehicles, they cannot be stored legitimately."
gtavcustoms,36guro,smojzore,2,Tue May 19 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"If you really want it, get a trial membership for Xbox or use a ps3 and make a quick account round your mates. Complete the prologue then transfer the character. It should register that you've returned and you can progress as normal and buy the car. You should be able to delete the transfered character as well as you will still have your main one.   Do at your own risk by the way, I'm 95% sure this works."
gtavcustoms,36ey83,teckademics,3,Mon May 18 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the Intruder getting recognized as a JDM, although odd, it's still a ""japanese"" car counterpart.  The frequency of the Jester and Penumbra was really nice, as well."

gtavcustoms,36fksw,thesquatch84,5,Tue May 19 00:19:53 2015 UTC,keep em black. take off the brand on the tires. black out windows. and fade those blue neons. see how that looks :D
gtavcustoms,36fksw,rabbitLK,5,Tue May 19 01:25:46 2015 UTC,Keep black and tint the windows!

gtavcustoms,36fksw,Mid_1010,2,Tue May 19 01:03:12 2015 UTC,Stock rims on the Carbonizzare are some of the most attractive ones in the game.  Personally I'm a fan of minimalist changes to the stock look as the lines/headlights/cabin are so gorgeous already.
gtavcustoms,36fksw,Ramses_L_Smuckles,1 point,Tue May 19 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"Or you can try to paint them gray. As for me, I think black with black looks boring, like there is nothing special in your rims."

gtavcustoms,36dba1,telefight,2,Mon May 18 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not feeling that bastardized version of the intro, that's the signature motif of the song. Good content though, agreed!"
gtavcustoms,36dba1,terjr,2,Mon May 18 22:55:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I think! The intro REALLY hurt me internally, and maybe I didn't like all the vehicles, but overall it was really enjoyable."

gtavcustoms,36dba1,Testa_Inc,4,Mon May 18 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and yeah more are in the works. So far only PC has the Editor which allows for this kind of camera work, but PS4/One will get a version of the Editor, but not sure what it'll be able to do."
gtavcustoms,36dba1,Thatcrazylemur,2,Mon May 18 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the editor works just as well on consoles as PC and they don't tone it down too much. Can't wait to try my hand at some machinima, I know I've got the people to do it with I just need the resources.   If nothing else I'll be happy I can take better pictures."
