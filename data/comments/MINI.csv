MINI,3e4gbk,jadasmarjk,2,Tue Jul 21 21:50:47 2015 UTC,"As a new-used Mini owner and new r/Mini member I guess it's my duty to answer questions like these :) R53 are mechanically the most bulletproof years.  Supercharged.  More mods.  Not best gas mileage.  Lower stock power than turbo models.  Aim for an 05-06 as these years had some revisions (and fixes). R56 are newer turbo models.  07+.  Lots of issues, the biggest of which is the timing chain and chain tensioner failure.  Quieter, more refined interior, softer ride, more power stock compared to R53.  It's been said to buy only 2011/2012 years for this model. Depending on your location $9000 should be plenty.  I live in Socal and many members think I overpaid at $7800.  Supply is high in my region but condition and miles were not the best for $5K-6K range.  I paid a bit more for a car with good maintenance records, body, and 84K miles.  Motor will go as far as your wallet will allow.  Good luck!"

MINI,3e3p3t,salochin92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:46 2015 UTC,Yeah it's the power steering pump. They make noise.   Double-check the fluid reservoir and make sure it's not low. If they get low they can make more noise.   Unless MINI started using something different it should be Pentosin CHF-11S in a green tin.
MINI,3e3p3t,Audiontoxication,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:37:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, electric power steering pump. They are known to fail in the R53 and I believe they have an extended warranty that covers 2002 to 2005. I replaced mine last year myself in a couple of hours."
MINI,3e4eva,ToothpicDic,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"The wheel speed sensors are not compatible with the newer version, between the 2007-10 and 2011-2013 models they changed how the system worked. In your car, there is a receiver in each of the 4 corner's each receiving the signal from the appropriate wheel, when you reset the TPMS in that car, each antenna can only pick up the signal from the closest sensor and looks for it's identifying signal as the car moves to know it's picking up the correct data. This set up was overly complex in practice and often had expensive failures of one or more of the receivers and was abandoned with the LCI for the newer set up and sensors. The post LCI TPMS has one receiver, and when you reset the TPMS in that car it uses the rotational direction of the sensor to determine the left/right split on the car, and because it's located closer to the rear of the car can use the signal strength to determine the front/rear axle location of the wheel. Given the two systems operate in different styles the wheel electronics (TPMS sensor in not BMW speak) transmit data differently in each setup as well as the antenna's only looking for certain data makes them incompatible. However, you most likely could transfer the wheel electronics from the old wheels to the new set. Hope that helps and clears up any confusion as to why they're not compatible, the dealer isn't trying to rip you off, though without adequate explanation a lot of things BMW group can sound like they're just trying to take money.   Wait. You have an R52, IIRC that doesn't even have a TPMS sensor, it just uses wheel speed to check for flats.  The R52 is essentially just an R50\53 with a folding roof, the first generation cars didn't have true TPMS at all, they used an indirect TPMS set up which monitored for variation in wheel speed as a tire that has gone flat will spin at a different speed than an inflated tire, this however had the issue of 4 flat tires not registering at all with this set up as there was zero variation in wheel speed between the 4 wheels. That's why the progressed to the first direct TPMS set up in the R56  using sensors to check the tires pressure."

Though, there's one of two ways to proceed, if it has wheel speed sensors you should be able to transfer them on to the new wheels, if there's no TPMS sensor you don't have to worry about it just reset the flight tire warning as per normal"

MINI,3dz8w9,Fozee,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"The Cooper D gets exceptional gas mileage, in real life figures it often ends up being one of the most efficient fossil fuel cars on the road. You can eek out 50-60mpg pretty easily, and it's going to run about 75-80mpg during a highway cruise. I have no frame of reference for how the R56 diesel engine is in terms of reliability.   With the petrol version, you're going to get almost exactly half of that. It's still very good, you're still going to beat some of Volkswagen's diesels in efficiency while still being faster. 2012 is a good year for the R56 petrol engine, almost all of the serious reliability issues are ironed out.  As for performance, MINI focuses a lot on handling and torque. Between the two engines, torque figures (without looking it up) are going to be pretty similar, so the diesel won't actually be significantly slower or anything unless you're taking it to track day."
MINI,3dz8w9,Fozee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:25 2015 UTC,Also the diesel engine is more reliable than its petrol counterpart.  I average around 50mpg.  When I was doing lonnger motorway trips it was around 60mpg.

MINI,3dzp7w,tallakahath,2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:44 2015 UTC,There's a service bulletin out and about with the AC compressor causing rough running conditions which may impact your car and wouldn't be a bad place to start. The extended warranty only covers scheduled appointments or necessary repairs?
MINI,3dzp7w,Mumma66,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"As far as I know that's all it covers. I once called in to ask about some stiffness with my suspension that I was worried about, and they told me that to check it out would cost XXX dollars, and the warranty is only for scheduled maintenance...   I've found some relevant service bulletins, but I assume they're similarly not covered? I'll call my MINI dealer tomorrow regardless, but if this sub has some clarification as to what a service bulletin actually means w.r.t. extended warranty I'd be appreciative."
MINI,3dzp7w,Mumma66,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:17 2015 UTC,Service bulletins are designed to make people's lives easier essentially if there's a recurring issue with a certain set of symptoms it's a starting point for technicians that can save on diag time and misdiagnosis. Occasionally they will also contain extended warranty like the ones for the first generation models power steering or pre-lci R56 extending the warranty of the high pressure fuel pump.

MINI,3dvd3i,thezlog,-2,Mon Jul 20 07:17:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that Jeep has been a huge disappointment. We did have to put the boats on the roof at the take out (mine was at the put in) and it cracked the roof by the time we were home."
MINI,3dvd3i,SupplyAndCommands,2,Mon Jul 20 13:07:29 2015 UTC,That's most likely because you didn't properly set it up

MINI,3dwz0k,rwiddi72,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:41 2015 UTC,"I guess the first question is... what will you run off the amp. Im running the ""standard"" speakers of my aftermarket headunit then in the boot i have my amp wired to a 12"" sub and two 6x9 ive put into the parcel shelf. If you want to just run the ""standard"" speakers then is there much need for the amp if if extra speakers then i got of guys go for a boot install. You could make a false floor or mount it on a panel on the rear of the seats"
MINI,3dwz0k,Itachi431,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:48:52 2015 UTC,"Im running the 4 new speakers I installed, and eventually I'm going to make a custom box for a shallow mount 10"" sub, which will also be powered by a separate amp"
MINI,3dwz0k,DePiddy,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"Best place to mount it would be in the factory amp location, which is behind the passanger side quarter panel. It envoles removing the whole back seat. Also do you have the factory hardmon kardon system?"
MINI,3dwz0k,davechamp50,2,Mon Jul 20 06:50:56 2015 UTC,"That's what I did.  Alpine MRV-M500 on one side, MRV-F300 on the other side."
MINI,3dwz0k,energyinmotion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was thinking that, but its just a tad bit too big to fit in there. Probably just gonna put it under my seats"
MINI,3dw3bv,Goatmo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:42:53 2015 UTC,"Planted brackets made me some seat brackets for my corbeaus that sit 3"" further back than stock. It has created a dramatic difference, but I have a hard time reaching the steering wheel when sitting so far back."
MINI,3dw3bv,zr0z,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:10:45 2015 UTC,Have you tried raising your seat up using the pump lever? I'm 6'1 and notice that i have to make sure i raise my seat up so that my legs are bent more or I sit too far back to comfortably reach the wheel and shifter.
MINI,3dwzkv,ClayTaylorNC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:54:45 2015 UTC,"Removing the resonator is about the same as cutting a hole in the side of the box. Cutting up the airbox means you cant easily put it back to stock.   Also, most of the shortrams for sale for the r50 you could probably build from parts from Autozone/pepboys universal kits. The Mini doesnt use a MAF sensor in the intake track, so all you need is the nossel to plug in the breather for the valve cover. The other option is dig around on the NAM forums for a used one for cheap.  Looks like JCWhitney sells a very generic shortram for under 40 bucks http://www.jcwhitney.com/bolton-premiere-direct-fit-cold-air-intake-with-tube-49-state-legal-no-ca-shipments/p3047384.jcwx?filterid=d1622y2004g2j1 cant say how good it is really."
MINI,3dwzkv,Iheartbaconz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually got something similar to that. It doesn't fit mine. The piping is too long and the filter too big. After taking all the air box stuff out, the area where the filter would be is quite small."
MINI,3dwzkv,salochin92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:31 2015 UTC,"I've done this to mine, and I love it. It sounds so mean when you put your foot down. It made my baby rev a bit easier too, but mainly it's the gurgly throaty sound that makes it worthwhile. I've got my exhaust done too, and it compliments it so very well.  http://www.outmotoring.com/mini-cooper/DDM_works_mini_cooper_intake_system.html"
MINI,3dwzkv,salochin92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard good things about those. What type of filter is it? I would think I can mod the air box to create that wall, then get some tubing and the filter. And boom, all done (in theory). Do you have a link for just the type of filter? Did you install this with good sound results before the exhaust?"
MINI,3dwzkv,salochin92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:22 2015 UTC,It's a UNI filter (tube). Why would you need to mod it? It comes with a box made for our R50's. And the filter. It's good to go
MINI,3dwzkv,salochin92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"I mean mod my stock airbox that is on there currently, to fit the UNI filter and replace stock tubing with short tubing. Just to save some money. I just bought a set of coilovers so am out 699 bucks right now. But got the bug so trying to do a couple more small things."

MINI,3dvjkj,jpgwinn24,3,Sun Jul 19 21:52:28 2015 UTC,"Just get the OEM rack.  They're designed to fit and they have a higher weight rating.  If the clubman rack is anything like the R56 rack, it will pop on and off in under 15 minutes after the initial fitting."
MINI,3dvjkj,WhoIsPurpleGoo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"I bought a Yakima for my R56. It may not have have the same weight rating, but it was MUCH cheaper (craigslist), doesn't require permanent modification to the car (I didn't have roof rails), was a lower profile, and I was able to swap everything over to my R61 without having to worry about roof rails on it. It also installs/uninstalls in about 3 minutes."
MINI,3dvjkj,arsci991,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:36 2015 UTC,"there's no permanent modification for the OEM rails to fit on the R56.  the roof was designed with slots in it for the feet to fit into it. (the R50/53 roof rack required drilling).  i still would suggest the OEM rack.  i'm not saying there's anything wrong with a thule or yakima rack.  i would just prefer to have a roof rack specifically designed for the car, especially since it's available, rather than an roof rack that happens to fit."
MINI,3dvjkj,WhoIsPurpleGoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"I just looked up the load limits, the max limit on my Yakima is 165lbs, the same as what's listed in the instructions for the OEM R56 rack.   If you have the cash to drop on the mini rails and rack, sure, but it is expensive. The aftermarket racks are much more common and are much easier to find used (I bought a full ski rack setup for less than the cost of the base supports for the OEM rack). Also the oem rack sits fairly high and you do not have any kind of adjustment (the main reason I chose the Yakima over OEM). With the Yakima I can adjust it up and down, fold the ski racks back, and move the rails along the roof to fit what I need to carry. You do not have this option with the mini rack.   Also note the aftermarket racks don't just  ""happen to fit."" They are designed to fit specific vehicles. You buy the base kit that is designed for your vehicle."
MINI,3dvjkj,arsci991,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:23:28 2015 UTC,"It's exactly like the R56 rack. The Clubman had an option for factory rails, and if you got the factory rails then you needed a slightly different base support system, but if you didn't get the factory rails then you can get the standard OEM rack and the Clubman has the same roof slots to take it. Just pops in and out. Source: I have them."
MINI,3dvg8f,2313xx,2,Sun Jul 19 21:24:16 2015 UTC,"If you are risk averse, either find a well maintained R53, or pony up for a 2011 or later R56.  The 07-10 R56 S are as troubled as reported. Many owners get lucky and have no issues, others aren't so lucky. The odds are poor.  Didn't stop me buying an '09 R55S, but I went in eyes open knowing I might have an expensive problem to fix someday. So far I've replaced a thermostat, need to walnut blast the intake valves and I should replace my timing chain sometime in the coming year. I do the work myself so it's just parts and occasional special tools. If you pay others, expect to spend a lot."
MINI,3dvg8f,bratling,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"Some of these problems make it sound no different than owning an R53. Mine was an 04 and within 6 months of me getting it I had to replace the clutch and flywheel, few months later my coolant tank blew, then my oil pan (completely my fault for being too low and careless at that moment though), and I was planning on doing the tensioner soon. It's just that some of these stories make me feel like even if I found one that appeared well maintained I'd still be guaranteed problems."
MINI,3dvg8f,bratling,2,Mon Jul 20 01:41:33 2015 UTC,"It's a lot like the early R53's really. It wasn't until the last couple production years that BMW got most of the kinks out. The 2005-06 models are the ones that give the r53 its reputation for being such a solid machine. The first four years, not so much."
MINI,3dvg8f,420purpskurp,2,Mon Jul 20 02:16:13 2015 UTC,It seems like just like the R53 most problems are related to the oil being too low. If that's true I feel like I should be okay. I got used to checking the oil in my R53 and I've had a turbo car before. Of course a newer one would be nice but I can't see it happening without traveling very far.
MINI,3dvg8f,baruroot,2,Mon Jul 20 02:51:41 2015 UTC,i have an older R56 with the N14 and its been nothing but awesome. 110k miles and a stage 2 tune with no problems whatsoever so far. I even did a Blackstone Labs oil analysis and they said it looked better than average. I also drive my car very spirited. I'd say go for it!
MINI,3dvg8f,atheos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:17:35 2015 UTC,that's nice to hear about the miles+mods!
MINI,3dvg8f,denko_safe_cats,2,Mon Jul 20 02:54:01 2015 UTC,"Our 2010 R56 S with 26,000 ""spirited"" miles just came back from the MINI dealer and was diagnosed with a stretched timing chain.  Was given an out-the-door repair estimate of $2,500.  Going to a local mechanic (recommended by a MINI-owner neighbor) first thing tomorrow to get a 2nd opinion/estimate for comparison purposes. Lord forbid ours is one of the ""troubled"" few  :("

MINI,3dvg8f,tetshi,2,Mon Jul 20 02:52:14 2015 UTC,"I think I read somewhere that 1 in 30 of the N14/N18 motors self destruct.  I think that if you change/check your oil frequently and address the death rattle issue immediately after the symptoms develop, you'll be fine."
MINI,3dvg8f,mhtlwp56,2,Mon Jul 20 01:17:45 2015 UTC,"*'11 and up.  This is what I sent to someone who just bought an early r56  Congrats!! Copy/paste from another MINI thread I commented in: (not sure your level of understanding on the topic but anyway) This is gunna sound rough but I'm giving you tough love from a fellow mini owner. You bought what is referred to as an r56 with the n14 motor. The r56 with the n14 engine (07-10) are extremely problematic cars. If they haven't already gone, you can be guaranteed to have to replace your thermostat ($500), your water pump ($600), your gasket seals ($200-$300), and your timing chain ($2300). They take premium gas $$$ and burn oil bad, about a quart every 1000 miles. At about 10 bucks a quart, if you do 12 thousand miles a year, thats an extra $120 in oil outside of regular oil changes. The '11 to' 13 Cooper S's come with the n18 motor. Fewer issues but still high maintenance. Get a fund saved aside for when this stuff goes and hopefully you're willing to get under the hood and do some of the work yourself."
MINI,3dvgm7,Kenisis24,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"S model with turbo or is it a Justa?  If S model, you might have carbon build up on the intake valves causes poor running. $400-1500 to fix, depending if you are dealing with an experienced specialist shop (low end) or a dealer (high end)."
MINI,3dvgm7,bratling,2,Mon Jul 20 00:18:16 2015 UTC,Its not the S model. And I live very close to a MINI dealer.

MINI,3dr898,twoheadedhorseman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"I ordered them off rack-attack. They are just a standard Yakima base rack system. I imagine with a little thought you could get around even using that.  The base rack and fairing was about $330, which is still less than the attachments I wanted would have cost. So, I net it as a win."

I do have some rattles from the rack though, that need to be fixed by adding rubber pads between rack and bar, and some steel braces across the top to make it a bit more rigid.  Beyond that though, no complaints at all."

MINI,3dt7m6,Audiontoxication,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:56:23 2015 UTC,"The MSD coilpack has been on for months now, no issues. Why would it suddenly cause this? Is this code usually signaling a broken sensor? What could be a root cause other than faulty boots and disconnected tubes/wires?"
MINI,3dt7m6,Audiontoxication,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:35:16 2015 UTC,"The MSD coil has a bit of a track record for cracking and failing, I believe they have taken out a few ecu's. It's your car though, if you like it, cool.   The code most likely means there's an air leak or for some reason the map sensor isn't seeing the expected amount of boost. Hope you get it sorted, vacuum leaks are annoying."
MINI,3dt7m6,Audiontoxication,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"I had never heard of this, most vendors recommend the MSD as an upgrade when installing colder plugs as part of a pulley reduction kit."

The '11 to' 13 Cooper S's come with the n18 motor. Fewer issues but still high maintenance. Get a fund saved aside for when this stuff goes and hopefully you're willing to get under the hood and do some of the work yourself."
MINI,3dqc48,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:15:09 2015 UTC,"Very good advice.  If you do your own work it's not as bad. The thermostat is a $130 part (kinda outrageous for what it is) and takes an experienced mechanic a couple hours (but took me about four; the first time is always slow).  On the other hand, the timing chain can be DIY but the parts and the cam holder you need will run you around $700-800. And you probably will end up replacing the valve cover ($300 or so itself) while you're at it, because they tend to crack and slow leak oil."

The first time putting them on take a bit as you have to measure and stuff, but you can then use the enclosed stickers on the inside of the door frame to mark the spot for putting them on again.  Honestly though, I only put them on when I'm toting more than 2 bikes as I also have the rear bike carrier for the R60.

MINI,3djj1y,isamlegend,5,Thu Jul 16 19:53:57 2015 UTC,"The pulley will give you around 15-20HP. It is a very very noticeable mod. Mods build on each other. Cool air intake are only a couple HP at first and more as you add other mods. You'll get better power with a foam filter versus a pleated filter.  A good cat-back will give you around 6HP and another 6-8 for a good header. The supercharger will keep delivering as you add other mods that enable the engine to breathe easier.  Do all the mods I mention above and you should be just somewhere around 200-210WHP, add a cam to get to 215 or so.  By that time you'll need bigger injectors and a tune (you can't upgrade injectors without getting a tune) - the tune will likely add increase max HP by a little, but more importantly it will smooth out the power band and enrich the air/fuel mixture when at wide open throttle to protect engine internals when at sustained wide open throttle."
MINI,3djj1y,ModMini,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:38:23 2015 UTC,"Pulley is a definite increase. Intakes on the supercharged mini give a decent amount of power. just a muffler won't do anything for your power output. Putting an aftermarket down pipe in, however, would add a bit of hp even without a tune.   New plugs are good but ideally you'd want to go one step 'colder,' as in switching from the default iridium plugs to copper or silver.   this is a good write-up on plugs."
MINI,3djj1y,MrDaburks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:44:10 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind though that many people quote WHP not BHP. The r53 puts down about 155whp stock.

MINI,3djj1y,Audiontoxication,0,Sat Jul 18 07:31:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the pulley, but the CAI is probably good for 5-10 hp, a new high performance muffler would add another 3-5. Those two add more ""seat HP"", it feels like you're going faster since the engine and exhaust sound a lot more powerful. Plugs are probably a negligible increase but needed with the pulley."

It took a little while to get the spacing right and adjusted properly when I first got it. You can adjust how high it sits but I set mine pretty low so I had to make sure it didn't interfere with the sunroof opening. I usually leave it on all winter (except for track days) and when it's not in use I tilt the ski racks back like in that photo so there's less wind noise, but those can come off separate from the bars and as far as I know it's compatible with all their other roof attachments."

MINI,3di9lm,UnKnown_Mustang,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:17:59 2015 UTC,I'm not all that versed on the r56 but I know a tad about turbos. A quick google turned up that the k03 is a turbo from borgwarner that comes stock on Audi 1.8t and 2.0t engines. Over there on the 1.8 its rated for 150 or 180hp depending on the variation. I didn't see any super technical specs but I'm guessing your mini might stretch that turbo a little thin. That being said Borg makes great products. I would probably splurge for the ko4 which they rated for 220. On a turbo just because it's capable of delivering that extra boost doesn't mean it will by default.

I have an s with 6, the clutch has been making sort of similar creaking sounds since I bought it. Apparently it's the teeth on the pressure plate, a lot of people make it tens of thousands of miles with the noise, and some make it out of the parking lot.   That being said, I don't hear mine nearly as loud in the vid. I just sort of feel it in the clutch pedal and can lightly hear it with the engine off.   I wouldn't worry about it too much, unless you have the non s 5 speed. I've read that's a weaker overall clutch design.   That being said there's not much you can do, my clutch still grabs great and I just deal with the feeling/noise. Will probably need a clutch eventually, but hopefully not."

MINI,3deari,hotrods1970,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:43:00 2015 UTC,My clutch was making the same noise especially starting on a hill. Took it to mini and they said it was about $2000 to get it fixed. You can probably find a new one online for pretty cheap and fix it yourself if you are mechanically inclined. I had a 2009 clubman s though so it could be a different problem entirely.

MINI,3dei5o,Xipherisroot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:01:25 2015 UTC,I second this. Cheap tires are not worth saving a few dollars to sacrifice the handling.   It's really frustrating to want or need to put power down and get moving only to have them spin and traction control kicks in and shuts you down.
MINI,3dei5o,Audiontoxication,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:11:04 2015 UTC,"I would say you should certainly have the alignment done. As for the tires, I would have another person or shop take a look at them (once the alignment is done) to see if they need to be replaced. I don't want to paint them all with the same brush, but most shops will sense a lack of experience/knowledge and rope you into more than you need.   Half a degree shouldn't have much of an impact on your tires, certainly not enough to cause uneven wear that would be noticeable when driving.   If anything, just pop the worn tire back to the rear and the less worn resr tire to the front. I'm no mechanic though, so I would have them looked at by a third party."

MINI,3dei5o,salochin92,2,Wed Jul 15 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of people (for good assumption) think that you want your good tires in the front (especially fwd for acceleration) turning and braking.  That's fine and good but for the most part, in good conditions, even slick tires can handle that.    What you have to remember is that under high-intensity (for lack of a better word) situations, you need that traction in the back more.  Slamming on your brakes, fish tailing, losing the back end around the corner is going to be more dangerous and likely when your traction in the rear is compromised."

MINI,3dei5o,ClayTaylorNC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:51:43 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents as a tech/service salesman for 6 years. Nexen tires are not bad. They are middle of the road. People seem to think there is only great tires, and cheap tires. Not the case. Nexen tires will last a good while if you maintain them properly. I never sold a set of tires without at least recommending an alignment. If there is uneven wear, it needs one (if not some sort of mech. work to correct). If the Nexen tires are in your comfortable budget, get them. I had a set on a Mazda3 hatch for a few years and put 50k on them without uneven wear. And when I took them off they still had about 3/32nds on them. That's just about right at the replace line."

MINI,3dacy2,iChamrajnagar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:05:42 2015 UTC,"I had found some old music on my computer and figured I'd throw it on a little USB flash drive for the MINI as well (F56). The only albums  that showed up on the 'playlists' screen were folders that had a playlist in them with a .m3u extension. I ended up just making a .m3u file for each of the other folders of music I had and everything showed up and was playable after that, mine is just sorted by album. And, yes, the random function really sucks for me too when I play all tracks that way - it seems that the same stuff keeps recycling"
MINI,3dacy2,Trendy2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:38:52 2015 UTC,"So, if I removed all the folders and put the music and the M3Us in the same dir then it may work? I'll try that out. Also as I said, if you use the steering wheel button and press up or down it reseeds the random function, and you can use the normal next/back and get different songs. Until you restart the car. It's weird."
MINI,3dacy2,Trendy2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:43:36 2015 UTC,On my flash drive is about 20 folders and then I made a .m3u playlist file that looks like this in each one of those folders. I'm sure there's an easier way but this worked for me.
MINI,3dacy2,MrQuinzel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:00:34 2015 UTC,"I wish I had this problem lol. m R50 doesn't even have an AUX port, I have to burn a playlist to a CD if I want to listen to something."
MINI,3dacy2,optkk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:44:41 2015 UTC,"I bought a 32 Gb drive for my F56 S, basically to put my entire collection on.

One thing to look for is whether your playlists are pointing to the right place. If you make a playlist on your desktop/laptop and save it there, then try to drag and drop or copy it on to the thumb drive, it won't work. You need to make sure your playlist is saved to the thumb drive from whatever software you're using to create the playlist.  Hope that helps."
MINI,3d9lww,pkillian,2,Tue Jul 14 16:00:53 2015 UTC,Check your crank pulley/vibration damper
MINI,3d9lww,soopadog,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"Why would it not act up at full throttle if it were the dampener? I'm swapping my supercharger pulley soon, so doing the crank at the same time would probably make sense."
MINI,3d9lww,soopadog,2,Tue Jul 14 17:00:08 2015 UTC,I've seen them act up only at part throttle due to belt tension.
MINI,3d9lww,Iheartbaconz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'll swap it out while I do the supercharger pulley then. It's an 06 and as far as I know it has the original dampener on it, so it's probably well past due. Thanks for the info!"
MINI,3d9lww,Iheartbaconz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"Be careful when installing it. Mine came held under tension with a pin holding it closed so you can get the belt on. BUT I derped, pulled the pin out holding it before I installed it, and the force when it unlocked with sheered off the guide rods end pice that keeps the spring under propper tension. So pretty much I ruined it. I was in the middle of an SC swap and just put the old one back on to get it back on the road.  This is how it looks when you usually get them, Its compressed a bunch and there is a detent holding it, you pull that out once you get the thing bolted in and the belt around it. Makes for an easierinstall. Trying to put one in with that spring not held like the above is a bitch and you need to use a bar to compress the spring a little or buy an expensive ass tool. The frame rail is in the damn way too so you may have to unbolt the pass motor mount and raise the engine up a few inches."
MINI,3d9lww,Audiontoxication,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"That's the belt tensioner, not the crank pulley/dampener we're referring to. Here's an example of a crank pulley/damper"
MINI,3d9lww,soopadog,2,Tue Jul 14 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"Whoops haha. Either way, the belt tensioner on those cars always wore out fast as well. Mine didnt last more then 60k. Well, my SC didnt last more then that either. Nor did my idler pully. Mine siezed up 3 days before I was set to work on my SC."
MINI,3d9lww,Audiontoxication,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"Another quick question; should I ditch the damper all together when I swap it out? I'm considering getting a 0% ALTA lightened pulley, but don't know how detrimental it is to the drivetrain / overall feel of the car. Is the performance bonus worth it? I'm fairly performance savvy, I just don't want a blown engine on my hands."
MINI,3d9lww,Audiontoxication,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"Just get the ATI 0% damper. It works better than stock and you can rebuild it if needed. A lightweight flywheel will probably be a more noticeable change in the rev speed than the damper, plus these motors were designed with a damper for a reason."
MINI,3d9lww,Audiontoxication,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"I currently run a 2% Alta crank pulley and 17% Alta supercharger pulley myself and haven't had any issues over 20,000 miles. This is with software and spark plugs of course, but as far as ditching the damper, no reliability concerns so far."

MINI,3da2pe,caughtinfire,4,Tue Jul 14 18:48:41 2015 UTC,"Since you are putting that emblem over the spot, even if you mess up, it will be hidden.  There are a bunch of videos on the youtubes with varying techniques, but the most common method seems to be this...   Thoroughly clean the area. Use a pressure wash or air compressor to blow out any grime hiding under the edges.  Use a heat gun or hair dryer to carefully heat the area just enough that the piece can wiggle around. Careful not to add too much heat and damage the paint. Use dental floss or fishing line and slip it behind the piece and wiggle/slice through the adhesive. Take care not to pry or leverage the part and dig the opposite end into the paint. Remove larger bits of remaining adhesive by carefully picking and pulling it off. Reheating may help. Again, careful not to scratch or dig at it.  Remove the remaining residue using a solvent like 3M adhesive remover or Goof Off Goo Gone (automotive specific). Be sure it is safe for use on paint. Might be wise to test on a unseen area. Use a microfiber cloth. Dab on, let it soak, carefully rub it off. Don't reapply any heat while solvent is on the paint. Thoroughly rinse. Finally, detail the area. Clay bar, polish, wax, etc.. to match the rest of the car."
MINI,3da2pe,bluuit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:10:27 2015 UTC,Listen to /u/bluuit. That's great advice.
MINI,3da2pe,IAMACornyJoke,0,Tue Jul 14 19:34:17 2015 UTC,My only advise is to use windex and a plastic razor. Be very careful. It also will be easier if you heat up the surface a little. When i was a porter we used to remove decals and such and the best way to do it was heat it slightly with a low power heat gun. Once you get the actual letter off u can usually peel the left over adhesive off by hand.

MINI,3d9jh5,ClayTaylorNC,5,Tue Jul 14 15:43:43 2015 UTC,Raceland has a history of low cost suspensions. They aren't all that terrible if you dont push them past their limits. Also not having a pillowball mount for the front struts is a money saver. Their soft spring rates are a negative in my eyes. If you are looking to pick them up to simply replace an aging stock suspension and maybe lower your ride height just a bit then they should be fine for you. Just don't buy them thinking they will compare to even middle of the road coilovers (i.e. megans or bc racing) or think that they will last you 30k miles.
MINI,3d9jh5,aardvarkfarts,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much exactly what I was thinking. I need new rears at the moment on my R50. Fronts have well over 50k on them. I also want a a little lower than I have now (1"" drop all around), so maybe 2"" drop total."
MINI,3d9jh5,aardvarkfarts,3,Tue Jul 14 17:42:34 2015 UTC,It's up to you. With shipping it looks like they are about $430. I know they are a couple hundred bucks more but just for the piece of mind I would sooner buy the Megan EZ Streets. They go for $699 shipped on ebay but most sellers have a best offer option on them as well. The Megans offer adjustable dampening and higher spring rates from the get go. Just another option for you. if money is the main concern but you are still in need of new suspension asap I suppose you should go with the racelands.
MINI,3d9jh5,Melfuaru,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"If you're not racing I wouldn't even bother with coil overs, at least not at that price point of megans. Get a good set of struts and lowering Springs and enjoy a better ride with better aesthetics."

Very clean and garage kept, never seen a winter. It's at a dealership but is owned by the dealer himself who has just bought a brand new MINI, only reason for selling supposedly. He just replaced the entire power steering setup, one component was going bad but he knew about these issues and decided to tackle the whole job while he was there. It was an absolute blast to drive (especially once I realized it had a hardwired k40 radar detector installed, added bonus) and he's willing to let me take it to anyone to have it looked at, even take it for the day to make a final decision. Seems to have been well cared for. Only issue I am having is that it has 126,000 miles on it. Should I avoid this like the plague? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated?"

I hope you like the open air of the road because the AC condenser quit last summer that I haven't replaced because I haven't found the motivation to tear the front end apart. To be honest, I'm still a little heart broken because after all the condenser and I been through in Tucson, he left me.

MINI,3cyscz,Goatmo,2,Sun Jul 12 00:29:34 2015 UTC,"I had a r56 turbo,  and I currently have a r56 justa and a r53s    THe r56 justa is pretty slow above 45mph,  but that does not mean it's not fun,  just not as fun once your at highway speed,  your average toyota camry will outrun you by a long way  the r56s was fun, but torque steered real bad with the factory LSD,  my r53s does not torque steer nearly as bad"
MINI,3cyscz,MrBlahReef,2,Sun Jul 12 14:19:30 2015 UTC,"I have an 02 Base. Super fun to drive. Definitely peppy enough for someone who isn't in love with SC or Turbo, such as yourself. I am 25 and full coverage runs me 40 dollars a month. I didn't check the SC version, but I can only assume it would be a bit more."
MINI,3cyscz,ClayTaylorNC,2,Sun Jul 12 15:04:52 2015 UTC,which base model are you talking about? I have a base R56 and love it. not many performance mods besides suspensions but I mostly do city driving so it's FUN for me.
MINI,3cyscz,ipee9932cd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:07:14 2015 UTC,I'm looking at a 2005 in my area for $4000. It's a good year and one of the only Minis in my price range
MINI,3cyscz,salochin92,2,Sun Jul 12 17:01:21 2015 UTC,"I'm driving an 04' base. It's a go-kart. There's no other way to describe it. I've done intake, exhaust and coil pack, so it sounds fantastic, and is pretty peppy. There are times I want more speed, but minis aren't a 0-60 car. I wiped the floor with some 800+ HP mustangs at an autocross (had to bow out cause of a tire, but I had the quickest lap time), in my lil' 11 year old 130ish hp inline 4. So long as you remember that you aren't going to be winning drag races, and you have some grippy tires for the corners, you won't be able to get the smile off your face!"
MINI,3cyscz,salochin92,2,Sun Jul 12 21:56:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for that :) I think i'm going to get the one i have been looking at! Just got to haggle to stubborn bastard down now.
MINI,3cyscz,salochin92,2,Sun Jul 12 23:13:52 2015 UTC,"I know you'll love it! (IMO turbos are a hassle too. Something to be said for simplicity for sure!) Let me know how it goes! There are tons of mini clubs all over the place too, if ever you have questions about yours, or if you want a group to go driving with (trust me, I have to drag myself out of mine)"
MINI,3cyscz,salochin92,3,Sun Jul 12 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"Sadly Minis are not very popular in Kentucky :( So not only is there no Mini club, it's just plain hard to find a Mini for a decent price. I'm about to pay a little high for one just so i don't have to drive 3-4 hours to find a better deal. here is the one that i'm looking at. Care to tell me what you think? He agreed on $4000. I'm planning on taking the hour drive to see it tomorrow!"
MINI,3cyscz,salochin92,2,Sun Jul 12 23:34:44 2015 UTC,"Not bad! I picked mine up in October for $6500, with 94000 km. It had winters and summers on gorgeous enkei rims, and a nice aftermarket Magnaflow exhaust as well."
MINI,3cyscz,salochin92,2,Mon Jul 13 02:34:17 2015 UTC,"I would love to find one with less than 100K! But this one is in my budget (which really limits my options). An exhaust system, white stripes, and rally lights are the major things that i'm looking at doing to it! I think just those things alone would up the resale value a bit for me. Would you recommend doing anything else?"
MINI,3cyscz,suburbdad,2,Mon Jul 13 02:57:27 2015 UTC,"I hear ya! Well it came with the exhaust, but I've done a ram air intake (adds a very nice throaty growl to the engine noise) and plugs, wires and coil pack. The coilpack, plugs and wires were done mainly just for routine maintenance, but we're less expensive than OEM, as well as more durable and a slight performance boost. Also, red wires, coil pack and red air filter looks rather sick under the hood.   I've picked up a new rear sway bar (going from 16mm to 22mm), which I just haven't had time to put in yet.   One big issue I read about with all minis is strut tower mushrooming. I guess it is because the frame is so tight, that even a single pothole at decent speed can mess your alignment something fierce. The solution, or better yet deterent is reinforcing the strut towers. I opted for the bolt-on plates to strengthen, but you can also do a cross bar between them, or even both the bar and the plates.   If you do end up picking up the mini, and are looking for parts, I would strongly recommend outmotoring.com. They've got great selection, awesome customer service, and you can feel the passion for the mini when you visit the site.   All in all, I've put in about $1200 in upgrades, and I'm super happy with where it is. I've done the work myself, so it depends how handy you are, but its really simple stuff."
MINI,3cyscz,eMINIoh,2,Mon Jul 13 03:48:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not the best mechanic, mainly because i never have more than one vehicle at a time. So i'm too afraid to take anything major a part. But i'm over all pretty mechanically inclined and can figure things out pretty well. Do you care if i see a picture of your Mini? You sound pretty proud of it :)"
MINI,3cyscz,eMINIoh,2,Mon Jul 13 04:03:58 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. Things like the intake, and coil pack and such are quite simple, and very hard to mess up. Here's some pictures. They're a bit old (from when I bought her), I've fixed some little things, like that Oakley sticker is gone, I fixed the front grill, the front badge and so forth. I'm going to redo the front stripes too, as they're cracked and such.

But the part that sucks is that it was glued on and if i take it off, the paint is coming with it haha.  Have you had any major issues mechanically with it?"

The last thing you need is to dump your money into it and have a slap in the face when something critical goes wrong in a month... Not trying to scare you, but it happens. One last bit of advice: don't buy it if you aren't sure. If you're driving it and you think "" huh, that feels odd, probably something minor"" HOLD OFF. Be totally sure before you buy it.

It's fun enough for me but some people will see it differently. The base isn't a slouch but it's not exactly fast either.  But it's still a blast to drive and handles very well.  I got the base instead of an S because I got a good price on it in practically new condition $4000 under SRP and those savings were worth more than the extra power to me personally."

For Android/iOS you can use BMWhat. I used Android with an OTG cable and this cable. You can program the seatbelt warnings, door open warnings, one touch for the sun roof. It's easier than using NCSExpert."

It doesn't have any crazy functions. It's a charging port. That's why MINI did not go out of their way to label it or make sure every driver knew what it's functions are.

Hopefully they'll at least be willing to work with you to bring the cost down."

I went with there higher end single-din CDE-HD149BT with a power pack (in-line amp) and Polk Audio speakers for the doors and rear. I've been holding off on a sub because it already sounds phenomenal. The HD149BT model gives the option to change the illumination color to match your car with the orange setting matching perfectly.
MINI,3cu8qm,GinNJews,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:45:54 2015 UTC,I bought an in car fm transmitter on ebay for £3. You tune to a blank radio station and plug your iphone/ipod etc into the transmitter and it plays your media through the radio. Works fantastically and is much cheaper and less involved than having an aux input installed.

There's two contacts on the bottom of your fob that interface with the car. It's possible one of those contacts came loose inside your fob. This wouldn't prevent the radio signal from the remote to unlock the car/etc from working, but would keep it from registering in the socket.  Don't you have another fob you can try?

It will take you a couple days but you will be driving like a pro in no time. If this gal can learn so can you. I would recommend keeping it. :)
MINI,3crw1h,Emilyanny4u,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:17:46 2015 UTC,"I would definitely keep the car, but learn how to drive a stick in another car. The clutches on these are a pretty common failure. They are super fun to drive, easy to park, and great gas mileage. Stay on top of the maintenance and you can keep repair costs down. The manual transmission on S models are fairly bullet proof. 12k is low miles so you should not have to do too much any time soon. Before you make a decision have a MINI shop do a visual inspection and see if the car needs anything then you can make an educated decision."
MINI,3crw1h,HausofMinisandBMW,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"I learned how to drive stick on my 2006.

MINI,3crw1h,IHasDaRabies,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:42:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. The total for all repairs I've had was about $800-1000 including the cost of new parts and the labor time. Most of that was what the dealer charged for labor since one of the parts takes a while to get to. The pulley was about $60, the four connectors for the water lines were $20, and the power steering was around $30."
MINI,3crw1h,mr_mooses,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"Idk. The 2009 isn't a very reliable model. at 12k miles you're more than safe though. just check the oil EVERY time you get gas and make sure it's full, not in the middle, but full. Keeping the oil filled helps prevent the timing chain from stretching and what not.   I'd take it to the parking lot, learn to drive stick, and wait another 8 or so thousand miles to decide if you want to keep it ( you probably will) or if you want to sell it and get something else.   MINI's aren't for everyone. They're uncomfortable, not the best for more than 2 people. If you don't care about how awesome they are to drive, and how awesome they look you won't really enjoy it and better off getting something you really like.   Life is too short to not enjoy what you drive. It's not about the destination, but the adventure in between."
MINI,3crw1h,KBeardo,2,Fri Jul 10 19:29:48 2015 UTC,Every time I get gas? Do you do that with all your cars? I usually just change the oil as recommended by the sticker put on by the mechanic.
MINI,3crw1h,mr_mooses,2,Mon Jul 13 04:42:23 2015 UTC,Yes you can tell when its getting low and thats not good.  Always ALWAYS  have some oil with you and you will thank me later. Its just better to have in general and the fact your turbo eats it like pacman but its totally worth it.
MINI,3crw1h,gldmartin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:45:59 2015 UTC,"Check/top up the oil not change.  But god no, only one the MINI because it's not like other cars.  Dealer recommends something absurd like 10 - 15k miles in between oil changes, but bmw says it's within spec to burn 1 quart of oil every 1,000 miles. An average tank is like 350 miles, so after 3 tanks you could have burned a quart of oil. Then there's always the extra oil that's leaking out of your headgasket, or your turbo oil supply line, or w.e else is leaking oil on the car lol.   You could do it every 2nd, or even 3rd tank but I can't remember so I just do it every tank. Or sometime that week after getting gas.   For changing the oil you want to do it every 5 - 7k miles. You can go a little over if you don't have time or w.e, but do it before the 10k dealer interval.   The oil pressure is what keeps the timing chain tensioner tension, and if it gets lose the timing chain can stretch. The engine is an interference engine so if that timing gets screwed up enough then boom...  I can feel when the engine is low in oil in how it shift into second as well, at least in the winter."

MINI,3cl0qe,khayber,3,Thu Jul 9 00:43:32 2015 UTC,How good are the flappy-paddles on that model?
MINI,3cl0qe,smb1985,0,Thu Jul 9 02:06:15 2015 UTC,"Not too bad actually! They are very responsive and feel better than a traditional stick shift. Oddly enough, the automatic transmission is faster than the manual."
MINI,3cl0qe,khayber,3,Thu Jul 9 02:19:36 2015 UTC,"A decent auto is faster in straight line acceleration, but that's about it. In the real world they're slower since they're reactive, not proactive. For example, a driver may come to a corner that he knows is a 2nd gear corner, and he'll have the gear engaged going into the corner and can immediately get on the power at the exit, but an automatic just waits for the driver to put his foot down, then it has to look at the speed and throttle position before engaging a gear that may not even be correct."
MINI,3cl0qe,spiceykim,2,Thu Jul 9 06:49:59 2015 UTC,"I drove a '15 automatic recently, and I liked how it shifted, but it didn't have the paddles.    My '11 Countryman has the paddles, but they seem to be mere suggestions to the tranny that a shift might be in order sometime in the near future.  I was hoping that the new ones were a bit better than that."

I wouldn't be surprised if big brands had only one or two models with MTs 10 years from now. Technology is rapidly outpacing the MT, and most people use their car as an appliance. Why not get the most efficient appliance?   This who enjoy driving will continue to have MT options until the end of time. They will just have a smaller buffet to choose from."

MINI,3co64b,MatthewMateo,2,Thu Jul 9 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you expect the take rate of manual MINIs to be lower now that the car has moved up market in the sense that the F56 pretty much lacks all the character (harshness) that the R53 and R56 has?  When I drove the F56 at the driving events before they went on sale I was completely shocked by how soft everything felt. My R56 felt like a hardcore racecar in comparison, albeit it was pretty modified."

I read an article or two, and it seems that weird bend in the muffler is a common fit problem for some. Article.  I basically just had to wrestle with it a lot more.  I ended up bending the passenger side heat shield a bit to make it so the pipe wouldn't hit.  That allowed for a little more tweaking of the other pipes so that muffler's overall position shifted ever so slightly.  I still think there's a little contact between the right tip and the fender, but it's not as bad as before.  I've just got my fingers crossed that it won't melt the fender, but who knows.  Anyway should anyone ever come looking, I hope this helped."

MINI,3ckhml,Hunchen,7,Wed Jul 8 16:55:59 2015 UTC,"Well on R53s, the exhaust runs down the car, does a 45 degree turn into a resonator, then comes out of the resonator right next to where it went in...then heads through the muffler, then out. One ball mods pretty much just cut off the resonator (resonators don't really make the exhaust quieter...I'd say it ""smooths"" the exhaust note) and puts a straight 90 degree bend in its place. Here's a graphical and pictoral representation The burble and pop made by the R53 is enhanced or sharpened by removing the resonator. Hope this helps!"

I couldn't find a Clubman with the features I wanted, so I had one custom ordered (to lease as well) and nobody gave me hassle about it. They just ordered what I wanted and off they went. Granted, I did basically order every single feature that could be had on a non-JCW, so maybe they just didn't think there was any room to upsell (they only asked once if I considered the JCW and then dropped it.)"

Also, how long did the custom order take to arrive to you?"
MINI,3ckon5,Emilyanny4u,2,Thu Jul 9 13:00:00 2015 UTC,I custom ordered my MINI lease with the things I wanted. I was not able to get the cost down on the lease because they already had a leasing special going on. There was a strange back order on black paint roof options for my 2014 MCS but it took around 8 weeks I would say from order to delivery (including the back order).
MINI,3ckon5,DriftwoodBadger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:07:22 2015 UTC,"8 weeks isnt so bad, we arent in a huge rush and that works with our timeline right about now too.

MINI,3ckon5,DriftwoodBadger,2,Thu Jul 9 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"Custom orders take 2-3 months to show up. They're assembled in England and then put on a boat. It's quite the excruciating wait. Lease payments...no, not so much. In fact, I don't think I would even recommend leasing a MINI to anyone. The lease payments on ours were about $10/mo lower than just buying it, and I regret not just buying it. We'll be buying it when the lease runs out. This is a common story on here. MINIs have high lease payments, probably because they tend to be driven really hard and historically don't hold their value well. If you're looking to lease to keep your monthly payments lower, that's probably not going to happen."

If you think about it, the bridge toll is $4 plus it includes the admission to the Bayside Music Fest in Downtown St.Ignace (it's an awesome event)   It also comes with food at the event. So I don't think $25 per person isn't a bad deal. It's an awesome event in an awesome part of Michigan. There's all sorts of people, from families to older people. MINI of Grand Rapids really goes all out on this event and it shows.

They asked for money if you wanted to be in the huge pictures, or get the road closed off for you to do a time trial, and they had mechanics doing mods for cheap.  When I went, they didn't have Clubmans, Countrymans, etc. The Mini community on the whole is pretty awesome, I don't think anyone would give you crap or anything. I'm guilty of seeing Club/Countrymans and saying to friends ""Psh! Those aren't real Minis!"", but my current room mate has one, and we talk Minis all the time.

Goody bag was a bit unremarkable, my favorite part was the toy bulldog.  Didn't go to the music festival afterward, but probably should have.  Lodging wise, if you are at all into camping, I recommend one of the state parks in the area.  It's a beautiful area, and Michigan's DNR is probably the most competent part of the state government.  Otherwise I think Mackinaw City has plenty of hotels.  Finally, if you're not from Michigan, it costs $4 to cross the Mackinac Bridge (pronounced ""Mak-in-aw"" regardless of its with a c or w), and traffic is horrible heading north on Friday evening and heading south on Sunday.

I did this a couple weeks ago, but my new one is leaking still. It is leaking right where the line goes into the slave cylinder. I transferred over the old rubber/plastic seal, but if I give my clutch pedal a couple presses, I can see fluid leaking out of that little clip that secures the line to the slave. It is fully seated in there and my only guess is that the old washer that goes down in at the end of the line is old and not creating a proper seal. I can't find a new washer anywhere. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
MINI,3cde2w,vGEMATRIAv,2,Tue Jul 7 22:10:28 2015 UTC,"The o-ring needs to go on the line when installing, not in the hole. Otherwise it might get squished/torn. If it is damaged, you'll have to source a new o-ring. Any damage should be visible. I don't know where to get one other than maybe buying a set of o-rings from Harbor Freight or somewhere and using one that fits. If you are totally desperate, the o-ring comes with the service line, so you could buy a new service line, throw away the line and keep the o-ring."

Owning an F56 the display is telling me that I need to take it in for a service in 9000+ miles (I'm currently at around 600 miles). Do I take it in to MINI and ask them to change the oil? Is that covered in the 3 year/36,000 mile no maintenance plan, if I'm getting it changed ahead of schedule? Will they look at me oddly if I do?"
MINI,3ceyb5,CC_DKP,2,Thu Jul 9 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure on the newer minis, perhaps someone else here might know, but it sounds like the dialed it back from 15K to 10K. I would still probably do it every 5. You can take it to MINI, or any service shop that will change a MINI (not all will). Unfortunately, that 3y/36k plan only covers ""factory recommended service intervals"", meaning they won't pay for it until the service light comes on.   In actual practice for me, I just keep a quart of oil and some paper towels in the boot and check my oil when I fill up on gas. I usually need to top it off with half a quart every 1000 miles or so (R55S @ 60k). Every 5-7k I go and get it changed, mostly based on how bad the oil is looking."

MINI,3ce6xy,pathartl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:32:23 2015 UTC,"Could be a few things. Step 1 is to buy a can of compressed refrigerant with dye and hook it up to the system to check for leaks. Lots of tutorials on this.  Assuming no leaks... Step 2 is to check that the compressor is turning on.  This can be done by turning the car and ac on, and listening for a drop in engine rpm from the compressor kicking in.   If it's good from there I don't know what to do."
MINI,3ce6xy,texasconsult,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:03:46 2015 UTC,"I'd reverse the steps, but to each his own.   Step 1: Find the compressor and see if it's spinning with the AC turned on.  Step 2: If it isn't, you're probably low on AC juice (not a technical term). For my wife's Forrester I went to Pep Boys to confirm low juice (they do the basic test for free). I declined any other services they offered. There's obviously a leak if there's no coolant.  Step 3: Buy the correct refrigerant with sealant for you car. You can check for the label under the hood somewhere the info would look something like HFC134a and then a weight measurement. Fill on the low pressure side.  Most leaks are in the seals but you may have gotten unlucky and a rock hit and damaged the condenser."
MINI,3ce6xy,free_range_veal,2,Tue Jul 7 13:54:36 2015 UTC,"I only say to check for leaks first because if the system has been sitting for a while, there may be zero pressure in the system. The ac compressor will not even turn on if there is no pressure in the system."

I ended up finding a replacement clutch on eBay and it took me about 90 minutes to do it myself. Even after buying an electric impact gun, it was still a fraction of the cost of replacing the compressor.

MINI,3cdvxq,suburbdad,3,Tue Jul 7 11:00:39 2015 UTC,"The center speedo rocks.   What did you really want to do? If you take out the speedo then you wouldn't be able to tell how fast you are going, you could use the little digital guage on the tach (or just your rpm's and gear) but thats not practical. The speedo also houses a bunch of the warning lights like brakes, airbag, traction control, etc so there's that.   There was an option called the chronopack that was available on the gen 1 minis (r50, r52, r53 '02-'06). Which won't help you car at all.  I don't recall there ever being a chronopack option for the gen2's.    so your options are to replace the radio portion but that means you lose the lcd on the tach which in my opinion looks crappy. And you don't get the time, or get to see the ave speed and consumption all at once without having to cycle on the tach.  Also, if the radio isn't in the r56 it will throw a code if the dealer ever has to reprogram the ecu for anything. There was talk of thirdparty black boxes that trick the ecu, and then others that allowed you to move the oem radio to the glove box to retain the lcd displace, but also have a 3rd party radio in it's spot so best of both worlds. I'm not sure w.e happened to those you'd have to check [NAM](northamericanmotoring.com)  If you had the factory nav installed you have some more options since you can plug an aux display into the nav display like this and do lots of things.   Since you don't, you're best option for carputing is just to stick it on like this.   tldr; Nope."
MINI,3cdvxq,mr_mooses,7,Tue Jul 7 15:05:36 2015 UTC,Impractical to use the digital gauge on the tach? That's almost all I ever use. Do Mini drivers actually use the center speedo?

If I need to know if I'm going 72 or 73 etc I'll cycle to the tach display, but otherwise I much prefer to use the center speedo.   the speedo is nice too since the tach moves too fast when you're accelerating to easily be able to know your speed. I like to be watching the road, then i can glance/see in my perifial where my tach and speedo are reading.   I think on the 2011+ they allowed two guages to be displayed on the tach so you could have speed above, and mpg below.   why does anyone care about outside temperature? didn't you know how hot/cold it was when you got in the car? a compass would be more useful i think."

MINI,3cbuyc,dmatt2k12,2,Mon Jul 6 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's a turbo leak. The pcv valve is most likely for the oil build up and it is normal. I would say seafoam your engine, change your plugs, and make sure all your tubing is tight. I've had a similar issue on my cooper and this fixed it."
MINI,3cbuyc,p8ntballa100,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, I will have to try that, hopefully the pcv valve isn't shot....Really wish that part was replaceable instead of replacing the entire valve cover.   Now, did you add seafoam to the gas or directly into the intake? (I've seen both ways done before on other vehicles)"
MINI,3cbuyc,p8ntballa100,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:48:38 2015 UTC,I did it through the pcv tube off the back left corner of the engine. Its remarkable how much of a difference it makes. Specially if you've never done it and have 100k miles.
MINI,3cbuyc,p8ntballa100,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:16:59 2015 UTC,"Ok definitely going to do this, I was a dumbass today and got a 16mm socket stuck in the spark plug well, had to take the valve cover off so I could get better access to it and remove it.... had to call up the local part store and order a new valve cover gasket along with a new set of plugs as well, AND I actually ordered the proper 12 point 14mm spark plug socket so this won't happen ever again."
MINI,3cbuyc,ShoeBurglar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:23:10 2015 UTC,Yup you have to use a special socket and special plugs. I found out the hard way too lol
MINI,3cbuyc,ShoeBurglar,2,Tue Jul 7 22:12:06 2015 UTC,Turbo cars typically burn oil. Due to blow by and recirculation of that air. The oil you're seeing on the inlet is probably that. A half quart every 3k miles is not at all out of the ordinary. My first gen burns twice that and its still within factory spec. As far as the power/startup stuff I'd recommend and a Bluetooth obd adapter and get a better idea of exactly what's going on. They can be found real cheap on amazon
MINI,3cbuyc,ShoeBurglar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"I wondered if those Bluetooth adapters worked well, random question... are those Bluetooth OBD readers cable of accessing information on the engine while it is running?   I have a very low end code reader already, it can pull most generic and some manufacturer specific codes but I have a feeling it can't access everything in the ECU."
MINI,3cbuyc,UhOhPoopedIt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:59:24 2015 UTC,"Mines a first gen like I said but it can read almost all of the sensors off the CAN network. O2s, maps, maf, temps and other fun stuff. I've never had a check engine light to try to pull a code for it but I've heard they pull just fine."

MINI,3c8ud6,mmcheesee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:18:08 2015 UTC,Thanks. Sudden moves are not your friend on the track. Many have tried to be heroes and failed. Gentle steering - don't force it or the car will become unpredictable.  It's a 22mm sway bar on the stiffest setting.

MINI,3c9i9f,Coleslaw19438,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:53:59 2015 UTC,If not the plugs try checking the coil packs. I had a misfire and the plugs didn't fix it but I found the coil pack on cylinder 3 was shot. Got them for a good price and replaced all of them. Problem solved
MINI,3c9i9f,Coleslaw19438,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:36:11 2015 UTC,Where did you get them from and what brand?  They were pretty expensive at Advanced Auto.
MINI,3c9i9f,Coleslaw19438,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:41:36 2015 UTC,I got them from Amazon. They were like 25 a piece. Bosch
MINI,3c9i9f,Audiontoxication,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:05:03 2015 UTC,Looks like it time to check those out. Swapped in some new Desco plugs (all they had at Advanced but still spec) and all seemed well for 2 days. This morning I threw the lookout light again. :-( I'm going to get a new gauge and check the plug gap in case that's the issue but sounds like coils is next.
MINI,3c9i9f,dmatt2k12,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:42:29 2015 UTC,Do you have a link to the ignition coils you are talking about?  I can't find any Bosch on Amazon for a Cooper S.

MINI,3c8u13,DriftwoodBadger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:07:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, well, as it turns out, MINI Roadside Assistance will tow girls too.  But yeah, the runflats are horrible. I recently switched out mine. The ride quality difference is astounding. Noise didn't change much."

MINI,3c8u13,natheo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:31:54 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm just shocked that they couldn't find room for a spare on that thing.   Plus changing your tire on the side of the road is sort of dangerous to be honest.

MINI,3c95le,Audiontoxication,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:46:12 2015 UTC,"if you want more power, it'd probably be cheaper and easier to just mod your existing engine. Even if there's physical room enough in the R series for the F engine, it's going to have different engine mount points at the very least. You'll most likely have to take the F transmission and try to work it in as well, which is going to be fun trying to hook up to the R wheels and the R computer. Or try to figure out how to mate an R transmission to an F engine. Not sure which would be easier. Either way, you're going to be doing a lot of modding and adapting.  If you're asking if it's a drop-in replacement, no it's not. If you're willing to spend more than the entire value of your car to make it work, sure, there are people skilled enough to force it. I mean, if someone can put a Lamborghini engine in a Fiat 500, this can work, but it's not worth it."
MINI,3c8fyj,opieonekanobi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:45:58 2015 UTC,Have you tried using a breaker bar? That's the only way your going to crack that bolt.
MINI,3c8fyj,ModMini,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:12:54 2015 UTC,"Tried a couple ways.  Used a breaker bar (big and small diameter) and used everything from a 24"" pry bar to a 1/2"" torque wrench to use for leverage.  I think the only way to do it effectively is to remove the manifold from the engine compartment.  That would give the room to really get leverage.  But my mini isn't in the best of places to do serious work.  I can't safely lift the car to get under it.  If I was able to break the top bolt then I would have gotten a few floor jacks to make sure it was secure to crawl under...but that would be a waste of time now."
MINI,3c8fyj,ModMini,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:29:17 2015 UTC,"Try using a 72 tooth ratchet or a wobble extension. It might give you the movement you need to work the breaker bar.  Oh, you are not under the car? You can't do that without getting under the car. Get a floor jack and some jack stands, roll, push or tow the car if you have to. It will be cheaper than hiring a mechanic and you get to keep the tools."
MINI,3c8fyj,ModMini,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:16:43 2015 UTC,"It was purely because of where the car had stopped running that made it difficult.  If it had made it to my garage it would have been better.  The shop I use (when things NEED to get done) said they would use my starter (that saved me $300)  and labor cost of ~$160 they just wouldn't warranty the work, no biggie.    However, they called me this afternoon and said they put a jump box on it and it fired right up every time, and said the starter wasn't bad.  The battery was dead, and it's not even 3 months old.  The start-up has been temperamental for a while.  Like, it would take 2 or 3 tries to get the engine to start, so we figured the starter was on its way out.  Could the starter drain the battery like that?"
MINI,3c7cjy,NegativeKelvin,2,Sun Jul 5 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"Between 80 and 100K, expect to replace the upper motor mount, harmonic balancer, supercharger service (probably do the water pump at the same time). That's usually about the time to look at the power steering pump and fan if they haven't been done already. The clutch is a real mixed bag...lots of variables depending on how it's been driven. I've got 105K on my stock clutch but am looking to replace it. My friend has 135K on his with no issues."

MINI,3c6vg0,Andevu,2,Sun Jul 5 12:17:27 2015 UTC,Depends on how nice the roads are in your area. The older sport suspension is brutal on potholes but amazing on a perfect curvy road. The f56-55 sports suspension is a lot more comfortable then the older models and a lot easier to live with as a daily driver.  The standard suspension is more than fun enough for 90% of people out there.

Most of driving well in the snow comes down to you, as the driver, which is car independent. Additionally, you can augment the vehicle with snow tires in the winter to greatly improve your traction regardless of whether you have AWD or not. Remember that the AWD is only going to help you accelerate, and has nothing to do with stopping."

MINI,3c4fnu,AlwaysLupus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:09:49 2015 UTC,"Are you still under warranty or how are you handling the flats? I had to buy a new tire last time I got a flat, did I just get shafted?"
MINI,3c4fnu,Datmexicanguy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"They can patch a flat so long as the damage is at least an inch from the sidewall. In general tires don't get any kind of warranty. You can buy road hazard insurance with your tires, but its typically prorated to your wear, so you can't drive a nail into bald tires and get a new set for free.  Anyway, I ended up patching 2, replacing 1."
MINI,3c4fnu,AlwaysLupus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:01:52 2015 UTC,I'm guessing this wasn't at the dealer

MINI,3c4fnu,AlwaysLupus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:12:23 2015 UTC,Last year was bad for us too. We had 4 punctures from road debris all in the right rear tire. Luckily the 2nd replacement hasn't had any more holes put in it. So it's still good.

MINI,3c4fnu,AlwaysLupus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:21:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on the run flat system you have. Most likely it's just the tire design. The bead area of the tire is built up to allow operating without pressure a short distance. So, that's all you need to replace. But, Michelin made a PAX tire that had a special wheel. Both required replacing if going from run flats to normal tires."

MINI,3c1n8v,alqassimi98,6,Fri Jul 3 22:53:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I hated the first BMW MINI because ""it was huge"" I came to terms with the notion MINI was more than just the size of the car and have subsequently enjoyed three MINIs and looking forward to my 4th – the comparitivel massive Clubman."
MINI,3c1n8v,Fozee,2,Sat Jul 4 04:29:45 2015 UTC,"I think there's a reason BMW is making the ""MINI"" and not the ""Mini"" even though they have the rights to ""Mini"". It's not intended to be mini, it's intended to keep the spirit of the car, of which being tiny was really only a minor part."
MINI,3c1n8v,MrBlahReef,10,Sat Jul 4 04:40:13 2015 UTC,"all they have to do is fix the front end,  get rid of that goofy airdam and fix the slanted headlights and nose and I'll like it  until then, I have an r53 and an r56 to tide me over"
MINI,3c1n8v,Fozee,2,Sat Jul 4 11:35:05 2015 UTC,"For me, they have to fix the nose. It just looks too stretched out. That's fine if the new engine needs more space, but bring more of the front out if it needs to, that stubby nose is important."

A plastic platform stretching from the engine bay to where the hood actually comes down, and a lot of airspace underneath. I suppose it might help them duct air through the radiator more effectively... but that seems like a stretch."

MINI,3c1n8v,bratling,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"I've been surprised by the use of plastics in engines; the intake manifold and the valve cover both are plastic, attached to the top end of the engine. It's not as crazy as it sounds if yo use the right plastics.   In any case, that plastic forward extension from the front horizontal metal support is what bugs me most..."
MINI,3c1n8v,Fozee,2,Sat Jul 4 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"It's the history of our thermostat housing that bothers me the most. Any car I've heard of that uses a complex plastic thermostat housing bolted to the side of the engine, also has notorious failures related to it. I'd be less worried about exhaust and intake manifolds because there are no liquids involved, but even with the lack of liquids you know that seal will be compromised eventually."
MINI,3c1n8v,MrBlahReef,2,Sun Jul 5 19:51:58 2015 UTC,"bmw has a horrible history with plastic cooling components,  everything from about the e36 or e39 up is affected,  the ends of the radiators rot out, expansion tanks crack/leak and leave you stranded the thermostat housings warp/rot out the fittings rot out the newer ones have electric water pumps that fail  it's modern bmw's Achilles heel, I have replaced more bmw cooling parts than I care to admit  my 540i has had like 6 expansion tanks,  the stupid things are mounted lower than the engine so when they go they promptly drain all of your coolant"

The downward angle of the hood, the height of the lower bumper cover.  Combine that with the subtle increase in size, and there is an illusion of it being much larger and bloated. The rear end doesn't seem to suffer the same problem for me, I like that."

But if it looks bigger, that's all that matters to a customer, especially with something like an automobile. The numbers don't matter when it comes to a customer's perception. You seem to be bothered with people claiming the car is too big, when a tape measure tells a different story. But if it looks bigger, I don't care what a tape measure says.

The PTO Side of the blower tends to have issues on higher mileage.  Last thing you want is your waterpump not turning.  As well harmonic dampener.  The stock one is Steel and Rubber.  The rubber over time will tear and rip.  My stock dampener came off in 3 pieces.  ATI Super Damper is a fulidic harmonic dampener and a good upgrade.  Injectors... be sure to keep on top of these.  My #2 OEM injector went foul before I could catch it resulting in Detonation of my #2 cylinder.  A set of injectors is cheap.  If you have high mileage on them, swap them out.

MINI,3bzd9e,Iheartbaconz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:46:20 2015 UTC,In my case replacing the water pump would do nothing. The problem part that fails is built into the Supercharger because mini thought driving the waterpump off the SC was better than an electronic pump or one off the drive belt. More power to him if he kept the car working with out any SC problems. Maybe one day down the road I will buy another one of these cars to mess around with.

No shop that I know of would let you drive with something like this.  You need an alignment as quickly as possible. The way the tire is conpletely worn out means the wheel is constantly dragging the tire at an angle. The tire must also run very hot, and with the cords showing like that, it's probably going to burst quite soon.  Driving with this is really really fucking dangerous..."

MINI,3by1fy,NegativeKelvin,2,Fri Jul 3 02:32:51 2015 UTC,Test drive and pop that hood and look to make sure the strut towers have no mushrooming.  Also with any mini get comfortable with doing the simple maintenance yourself and invest in the tools needed. Much much cheaper. For ex. Oil change at dealership or shop is $78-100 for the s and DIY is around $40.
MINI,3by1fy,Jamesaki,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:20:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Any other red flags I should look out for, whether under the hood or on the test drive?"
MINI,3by1fy,Jamesaki,2,Sat Jul 4 15:39:04 2015 UTC,Just keep a eye out for typical things like the clutch and strange ticking or knocking from the engine bay. From what I see it seems like a great deal and with the upgrades (the Alta CAI sounds amazing with the supercharger) and relatively low miles it might even be a steal. I could not tell if it had the H/K sound setup. If so that's a plus as well. Oh and don't expect that great of gas mileage if you plan on using that supercharger ;).
MINI,3by1fy,Jamesaki,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"Pardon the possibly dumb question, but can the supercharger be switched on & off?"
MINI,3by1fy,bratling,2,Sat Jul 4 18:26:17 2015 UTC,No. It can be driven sensibly and achieve around 31-33 mpg. I average around 28
MINI,3by1fy,Jamesaki,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you managed that. My R53 averaged 21-22mpg, down to 17mpg when having fun.  Although come to think of it, I had a 15% reduction pulley and Unichip on it. Those plus a heavy foot..."
MINI,3by1fy,ShoeBurglar,2,Sat Jul 4 21:26:56 2015 UTC,My motor is stock. And my foot is quite heavy haha. But yeah I'm primarily city driving and I get around 28. Managed 30 when I was using highway more often.
MINI,3by1fy,vGEMATRIAv,2,Sat Jul 4 23:16:19 2015 UTC,Without being able to see it in person if say it looks like a steal. At that price even if it takes a couple grand to get it into perfect mechanical shape you're doing very well. Have a shop check it out anyways
MINI,3by1fy,bratling,2,Fri Jul 3 05:36:06 2015 UTC,"It has a few tasteful aftermarket parts in it from what I can see. M7 strut tower brace $250 that will help protect against mushrooming. DDMWorks intercooler cover $125. ALTA cold air intake with intake hose and cover at least $300 plus some HP. JCW front grilles. Hood stripes and window tint. Possibly a performance catback exhaust judging by the non OEM tips. These are all nice extras but could point to abuse (but hey I'm just as guilty). If the owner liked the car enough and had the funds to put money into upgrades, then hopefully the car has been sorted maintenance-wise. Just give it a good test drive and look over the service records. If that all passes, bring it to a local shop specializing in MINI's for a prepurchase inspection. Good luck!"

MINI,3bvvmt,Melfuaru,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:45:52 2015 UTC,Just a heads up the motors in the r53 are not direct injected like the r56.  If you are concerned with carbon build up in the intake/motor you can always run some sea foam through the gas or straight into the intake.

MINI,3bt2w0,DriftwoodBadger,3,Thu Jul 2 00:33:36 2015 UTC,Got mine off eBay. Something like $20 with free shipping. And it took about 20 seconds each to install (R56). Seriously.

I used a bit of heat shrink to secure them to the connector so it wouldn't jostle loose while driving. You could get away with electrical tape, but with how hot the panel can get in the sun, I didn't want to deal with ever trying to remove that gummy mess. I also used a large flat-blade screwdriver to pop the oem lights out (though a quarter or some keys would probably work in a pinch).  Total it took about 30 minutes, and that includes having to go find some heat shrink and get out an extension cord for the heat gun."

MINI,3bxcx1,notrainingwheels,2,Fri Jul 3 02:01:35 2015 UTC,"But how the hell can you drive a car knowing it's falling to pieces around you at only four years old?!?!  If this is four years old, what happens at six?    I guess because they aren't all like that. My 2009 Clubman S is about six years old with 80,000 on her. Bought used. Original owner had the usual N14 engine recalls done. I've been doing okay since then. Did have to replace a thermostat which was a pain in the ass but only cost me $150 in parts and fresh coolant and my time. Recently replaced my worn factory shocks with new Konis; shocks are wear items in my book and getting over 70k out of shocks that have to do their job with only 3"" of travel is pretty good.   Anyway. While all brand have lemons, BMW & MINI (as well as VW & Audi) seem to have them at a much higher rate than non-German cars. I don't know why that is; maybe their engineering culture values clever over reliable.  It utterly sucks that your car is possessed. :-("

My first car was a Toyota.  I sold Toyota for four years.  I still have that Prius and will probably get another one.  I understand what Toyotas are:  tools, appliances.

MINI,3bu6wo,jpgwinn24,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"Every car's clutch is different. My mini feels SO different from my best friend's mini. Her clutch releases really low, and is a bit mushy. Mine is very tight and the sweet spot is almost at the top.   It took me a while to get smooth, and I still have some issues between 1 and 2. My best advice is to go to a big empty partking lot and practice. I know that when I start to get jumpy its because I'm releasing the clutch too fast."
MINI,3bu6wo,seanmharcailin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:02:38 2015 UTC,My mini was also my first manual car. I would recommend a clutch stop:  http://burgertuning.com/clutch_stop_mini_cooper.html  It removes the deep dead space between the sweet spot and the floor and helps with shifting. Not to mention it's really easy to install. I didn't have to remove the plastic grommet and just reached in and pulled out the oem part.

MINI,3bt5jt,skwid,3,Wed Jul 1 22:58:13 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing with the mini is that you absolutely have to keep up on the maintenance. They are anything but a Honda. I neglected to change the o2 sensor right away when it the the code and later it cost me a motor.   The r53 is going to be a more raw car compared to the r56. There's tons of power available in the r53 motor. Stock wheel horsepower is about 155, and the motor complete with stock head and exhaust can make 210 with a pulley, injectors, cam and tune. If you add a head and header it can make ~270whp. Beyond that you need a different ecu. I'm sitting at 227whp and it's great.   If you're not afraid to get your hands dirty the mini isn't that bad to work on. It looks intense but once you learn to put it in 'service mode' you'll have easier access to most things. Service mode activate! Well mostly, I didn't pull the radiator and condenser forward.   A big savings would be to do your own oil changes and get your oil from Walmart, seriously 5qt jug of Mobil 1 for like $20 instead of $40 at an auto parts store. Use OEM filters though. And change it every 3-5k miles.   If you buy an r53, I would set some  cash aside to put into any neglected maintenance the previous owner left for you. I would also try and have the car checked out by Miniworx. They can also do all of the work needed. I can also put you in touch with my mechanic Greeneperformance.   Hopefully some of that will help your decision. They are great cars, but need attention."

MINI,3bt5jt,Audiontoxication,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:20:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for chiming in.  I'll be sure to take care of any CEL's immediately.  I've got an OBD2 reader so that will come in handy.  I live in San Diego and there's a reputable independent Mini garage here that I'll be using instead of the dealership. I'm gonna try to resist performance mods but I might get bit by the bug.  One thing I do plan will be to kill as many creaks, rattles, and road noise as much as I can.  I sound deadened my Fit and it made the car much quieter.  Not sure how loud the R53 interior is but the R56's road noise was minimal. +1 on Walmart oil changes.  I typically buy Mobile 1 or Pennzoil Platinum from them.  Royal Purple whenever it's on sale at Pepboys.  Why OEM filters?  I've always used Purolator Pure One or Purolator Synthetic filters.  Does your R53 burn oil at all?  I've read some posts saying their Mini goes through a quart every 1,000 miles or so."
MINI,3bt5jt,Audiontoxication,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:26:13 2015 UTC,"The obd scanner will be a great thing to have.   I've heard good things about sound deadening the r53. I haven't bothered, my windows are down most of the time.   The performance bug is a nasty one. But it's a fun dragon to chase.   I don't have any reason to only use OEM filters, they are pretty cheap so I figure it's ok.   When mine was new it wouldn't use any oil for 3k then it would use a quart. I've heard that's kind of a thing they do. I'm pretty sure my new motor doesn't burn oil, but it's not stock. Just check your oil every other fill up and you'll be fine."
MINI,3bt5jt,denko_safe_cats,3,Thu Jul 2 05:45:15 2015 UTC,"Now THIS is what a prospective buyer should sound like!!! Listen up folks! Haha. But really. You have all the important questions asked. Stick to your plan of the 06 r53. Don't don't DON'T get the 08. If you must get an r55 or r56, get a '11-'14. I think you'll enjoy the r53 more though. I just sold my 08 for an 06 a few months ago and never looked back. It's a much more grounded car. A little more raw. A drivers car. But not too stiff for your wife to be upset over. Godspeed and good luck!"
MINI,3bt5jt,ransom40,3,Thu Jul 2 12:18:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with this a lot.   The R53 chasis actually isnt quite as good. It's not as well sorted as the R56 (R56 will be a faster car)   But that is why it is so good.   It lets you feel a bit more, where the R56 is more muted. It communicates more, and gives you more feedback, and lets you really explore the limit of the car without holding it from you till you step over it.   its a much more fun car than the R56 for the driving experience, is a simpler motor, and I prefer the interior. (more bare bones. no distractions, etc. It was made to be a drivers car. Not a car for someone whose main concern was where the nearest starbucks is. They never sold them on lease either (that I know of). You had to want it, and you had to pay for it. Kept a lot of people out of them (new), but it made the community a niche of passionate driving people.  But i'm a bit elitist in my R53 vs others passion :P"

I've had the car modestly tuned with the Accessport stage 1 map for around 3 years, but it's just a daily driver, so no tracking or anything.  We just confirmed it was the turbo today by moving the turbine shaft back and forth. It was wobbling all over the place.

Also whilst it's an easy DIY job to fit you have to take it to an official mini dealership for them to be programmed into the car.  Otherwise they flicker.

MINI,3bs664,pinoyxpryde,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I can live with it being a slow process if it gets done right, and I probably won't try it on a busy street.  Does it also help you to get out of the space or is it a one-way assist?"
MINI,3bs664,Fluffaykitties,2,Wed Jul 1 19:17:11 2015 UTC,"1) Super easy. I suck at parking (don't judge: I've hit a parked car trying to park before) and I can use it fine. Also, it's fun to do it with a friend in the car. They're always super impressed/freaked out.   2) You don't have to worry about it. I've used it a bunch and it's never hit a car. It was scary the first time though because it gets close to the other cars (and makes the sensors beep) but it never hits them.   3) It doesn't help you get out, unfortunately. Though I don't think this is a thing that cars with park assist have (meaning this isn't unique to the mini)."
MINI,3bs664,Fluffaykitties,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:35:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Trust me, I am the last person to judge.  I have knocked down, not one, not two, but three mailboxes while trying to park on the street.    The getting out part is such a disappointment, I thought I have found God's answer to my parallel parking prayers.  I mean, getting out is just as bad as getting in, so this may be a deal breaker."
MINI,3bs664,Fluffaykitties,2,Wed Jul 1 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"It kinda makes sense that it doesn't, because you also have to deal with oncoming traffic when you get out. But I'm all for automated stuff so I feel you.   This is just me, but I haven't had trouble getting out of the spots. The mini only parks itself in a spot that has adequate spacing on both ends (it checks the size of the spot first) and I have yet to see it park me in a spot where I can't just do this to get out:  Reverse all the way (don't even have to turn yet) until beeping is really fast). Turn all the way to the left. Go forward. Done! The Minis are small enough that this has always worked for me. =)"
MINI,3bs664,Fluffaykitties,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:47:07 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't know of any car that will get out of the spot itself. So you might need to pick the next best thing."
MINI,3bs664,Fluffaykitties,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:48:19 2015 UTC,"you got a good point there about the oncoming traffic, I wasn't thinking about that.  Minis USED to be small, my R56 is definitely easier to park than the F56 I test drove, forget about the F55.    I may need to try the getting out part a couple of times.  Too bad the dealerships here don't have any Mini with that option, although I can probably check with the BMW dealers."

MINI,3br4mp,GhostalMedia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:08:10 2015 UTC,I don't think they're changing right now. Even the site this came from shows the old badge on the car.
MINI,3br4mp,GhostalMedia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:45:23 2015 UTC,Designer here.  Usually a rebrand takes a lot of time to roll out. I would bet money that the site will eventually get the new logo and the cars will get some sort of metallic badge variation of the new logo with the new typeface. Might have to wait until the 2017's to see rebadged cars though.

MINI,3brct0,elvenranger292,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"Just curious. How attentive are you to your MINI's upkeep? Those n14's are notoriously troublesome, and forcing more power into them can really spell out trouble."
MINI,3brct0,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:21:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I change the oil very often, and am planning to use really good oil (Motul) going forward. Also always use 93 octane fuel. Anything else that you could imagine that would cause degradation to upkeep?  I have heard that the N14's are pretty freaking terrible, and I really wish that I could get an N18 in there... but I think that is why I am leaning more toward the smaller K03 with the 42mm so that I am not throwing too much power at the N14.. Thoughts?"
MINI,3brct0,denko_safe_cats,0,Wed Jul 1 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"the 93 is a waste of money. It isn't doing anything for you.  Honestly, you're driving a time bomb. If they haven't already gone, you can be guaranteed to have to replace your thermostat ($500), your water pump ($600), your gasket seals ($200-$300), and your timing chain ($2300). Adding any power beyond stock is simply speeding up this process."
MINI,3brct0,denko_safe_cats,2,Wed Jul 1 15:43:08 2015 UTC,This is so wonderful to hear.... So would you recommend just getting the stock turbo replaced?
MINI,3brct0,denko_safe_cats,2,Wed Jul 1 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but it's a valuable life lesson. Research before you buy. These n14's have pitchfork followings that outline every terrible issue they have.  Personally, I would. There will be others that say to upgrade while you can since these things are inevitable, and they aren't wrong per say.   To be honest, I would fix it the cheapest way, sell it, and get an n18. I know that isn't convenient, and I used that to justify dumping bill after bill into my '08. ""It'll be fine after this."" ""I already came this far!"" ""I have too much invested now!"" Until I finally pulled the trigger and sold it for an r53. Best decision I ever made."
MINI,3brct0,davechamp50,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:53:37 2015 UTC,"I just realized who you are... I actually commented on your post in /r/stance when you traded up...

MINI,3brct0,callmesaul8889,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:00:41 2015 UTC,"Haha oh yeah! Hi! Yeah, it's been a dream. Only regular maintenance and it already has almost double the mileage my last MINI had.  I miss the sound of the blow off valve, but the whine makes up for it quick."
MINI,3brct0,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:03:55 2015 UTC,"These prices seem like they have labor included. Thermostat isn't expensive or that hard to do. If you're a DIY kind of guy such as myself, you're only paying for parts which aren't too terrible."
MINI,3brct0,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:05:37 2015 UTC,"to the both of you: if you were to proactively replace the aforementioned parts, do you think you could prevent any future issues related with the factory parts? And if so, would you then possibly upgrade the turbo?"
MINI,3brct0,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I saw this thread. I just made a similar thread earlier today. I found out my turbo is failing and wondering what I should replace it with. I also have the N14 engine, but I've already replaced every part /u/denko_safe_cats has mentioned, so I'm not sure what to do now."
MINI,3brct0,callmesaul8889,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"To you and /u/elvenranger292, in essence. Yes, you would be fine upgrading your turbo. But for /u/elvenranger292, why go through all that instead of getting a different mini?  You're definitely picking the harder/more expensive route than finding a 2011 and doing it."
MINI,3brct0,nanoWarhol,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:51:04 2015 UTC,"I really should clarify, since I didn't above, that insurance will be covering the cost of the turbo...

MINI,3brc46,optkk,2,Wed Jul 1 15:02:27 2015 UTC,So to fit the brackets you will need to purchase a new grill with the holes for the brackets in the correct place.  This will cover 2 of the headlights.  For the third one you'll need to do some work yourself in making the slot.  Plenty of after market lights & brackets available on ebay.  As for the size you're probably going to want to look at something off a Land Rover maybe?  Such as this: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Roo-Lite-spotlight-for-off-roading-4x4-land-rover-/220644816336?_trksid=p2141725.m3641.l6368

MINI,3bntfg,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"Congrats!! Copy/paste from another MINI thread I commented in:  (not sure your level of understanding on the topic but anyway)  This is gunna sound rough but I'm giving you tough love from a fellow mini owner. You bought what is referred to as an r56 with the n14 motor. The r56 with the n14 engine (07-10) are extremely problematic cars. If they haven't already gone, you can be guaranteed to have to replace your thermostat ($500), your water pump ($600), your gasket seals ($200-$300), and your timing chain ($2300). They take premium gas $$$ and burn oil bad, about a quart every 1000 miles. At about 10 bucks a quart, if you do 12 thousand miles a year, thats an extra $120 in oil outside of regular oil changes. The '11 to' 13 Cooper S's come with the n18 motor. Fewer issues but still high maintenance. Get a fund saved aside for when this stuff goes and hopefully you're willing to get under the hood and do some of the work yourself."
MINI,3bntfg,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've already read about this unfortunately. I've got a warranty though and my uncle runs a shop anyways.   I noticed after my last trip to the shop, sometimes when I take corners the oil symbol comes on the screen for a moment. SHould I add more oil?"
MINI,3bntfg,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, that warranty probably doesn't cover most of those things. Warranty through who? For what?  Yes! oil oil oil. I guarantee you are low right now. The dip stick is a pain to read. The only successful way to do it is to pull it out when the engine is cold and let it stay out for 10 or 15 minutes. Then push it all the way in and pull it out once to get your reading. If the oil only reaches the bump at the end of the stick, you are a quart low. If it reaches the second bump, you're full.  This is VITAL to holding off on that timing chain issue. It's going to happen no matter what, but driving on low oil speeds it up and FAST."
MINI,3bntfg,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:45:48 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't picked up the warranty yet, I'm either going through ASC who I've used before, or this company called Matrix Protection, but it seems most of the coverage from the 2nd company goes away at 125k miles and I'm at 122k."

MINI,3boojx,sevenx7,2,Tue Jun 30 22:18:59 2015 UTC,Happened to me as well. What fixed it was replacing the stalk.

MINI,3bk3ii,loki_of_control,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:53:49 2015 UTC,"To have all airbags work and no lights go on you have to put a resistor in the connection that would go to the airbags in the factory seats.

Only hardware needed is 4x m8 x 1.25 bolts for bracket to floor, some bolts / nuts to attach sliders to bracket and one big bolt / nut to attach the seatbelt tensioner to the planted bracket.

MINI,3bk3ii,thesrly,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:54:13 2015 UTC,"The seats were $950 for the pair. Corbeau double locking sliders were $118 for the pair, and planted brackets were about $300 for the pair.   Corbeau has cheaper seats available but I liked these because I'm super tall and needed as high of a back as possible, most of their less expensive seats are 1-2"" shorter backs. I also spent way more than I needed to on brackets because I wanted to get ones that needed no modification and sat as low as humanely possible. The Corbeau brackets tend to sit high and people complain they're crap quality.  Overall 10/10 would do again. Everything went together very well and I only needed to purchase a handful of bolts / washers/nuts (to mount bracket to car, and seats to bracket)."

It does a better job at protecting your paint, since it is a sealant.   It actually forms a molecular bond to your paint. Wax can literally melt off your car in hot sun.  Sealant won't. You can layer it, just like wax. 1 layer will last an EXTREMELY long time.  I put 3 layers on my Audi S6 3 years ago.  I haven't waxed it since.  When it gets wet, water still beads up and falls right off.   Wax makes no sense to me.  I don't use it at all anymore.  Science has made something way better."

Compared to US prices for the Paceman of $23,550 and $26,900. Grain of salt and all, but perhaps an idea where pricing might shake out."
MINI,3bjftd,bratling,2,Mon Jun 29 18:53:06 2015 UTC,"About 50% more than the classic hardtop, which lists for a hair under $21k US. So that would put the price of a Clubman around $32k for the base model  The S models generally cost around $3500 more than base models in the U.S., so that would put the Clubman S at $35-36k.  That's in line with Audi A3 pricing, and it looks designed to go head to head with the A3 hatchback.  Plus options, of course... I would expect to see the new Clubman hit $40k pretty damn fast.  But even at the bottom end of the range, too rich for my blood.  (You absolutely could not get me to pay $32,000 for a car with just 135hp. Ridiculous.)"

MINI,3bg7hp,pkillian,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:09:50 2015 UTC,"I've always found it annoying to remove the front bumper cover, especially after doing some radiator work that removed the mounting point for the under-body plastic skid plate. The screws that secure the three layers (the bottom of the bumper cover, the skid plate, and the mounting point connected to the radiator assembly) are a pain in the ass to align, extremely easy to strip and mangle, and pretty crucial. Without these screws, the bumper cover flops around in the wind like crazy.    To solve this issue, I've found a secure way of replacing this screw assembly with the plastic rivets used to secure the wheel wells to the body of the car. You'll have to remove the metal clips that these screws originally mount into before following this guide; this will probably require removing the bumper cover and under-body tray, which is a pre-requisite to needing this how-to anyway.    Hopefully someone finds this useful! I sure as hell did. Don't forget to wave!"

I'd be interested in how the law defines ""license plate"", because in this country those Euro plates aren't license plates at all. Obviously, putting a different American plate on the car is illegal; that's a given. But even an authentic euro number tag can't be considered a license plate because no car in the nation legally uses them as such. It's also perfectly legal to transport your car overseas and put an American plate overtop a European plate, so I don't know if this really is against the law or not. Tricky grey area."

With snow tires and the All4 AWD variant you'll be in decent shape.  You'll still weigh 800-1000lbs less than a Forester, so you won't have the same weight to pack down or push aside snow.

MINI,3bfv4v,HoustonWeHaveUhOh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:13:02 2015 UTC,What about the size I should get as I want new rims
MINI,3bfv4v,vatothe0,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:20:52 2015 UTC,"For comfort, the tires are going to mean more than the wheels (rims).  In a general sense, the taller the tire from the rim of the wheel the more ""cushion"" you'll have against the road.  The bigger the wheel, the less space you have between the rim and the wheel well.  If you're looking for comfort, you'd want a smaller wheel with taller tires.  The middle number you see when looking at tire sizes refers to how tall the tire is in millimeters ex. ""205/35/r17"".  The problem is with taller tires, is there is more flex, therefor performance is lower.  If you were looking for comfort, I would probably go with 16"" wheels, with a tire size of 205/45/r16.  This means the tire is 205mm wide (standard), 45mm tall, and 16 inches in circumference. The opposite end of this that would fit on your car could be something like 225/25/r18. That will look a bit more sporty, may handle corners slightly better, but will produce a rougher ride.  There are many variables that will affect as well like the rubber compound, but as a general guide I hope this helps!"

MINI,3bfv4v,HoustonWeHaveUhOh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:31:41 2015 UTC,"Not quite. The middle number is the aspect ratio of the tire profile, as a percentage of the width. The sidewall of a 205/35 tire would be ~72mm or 2.87 inches."

On a side note in order to avoid future issues with the diesel please try to drive it at motorway speeds for around 40 mins once a week if you are almost always doing short trips such as this.  Reason being your DPF will eventually clog otherwise and that's a fairly expensive thing to fix.  A 40 minute blast down the motorway will burn the gunk off leaving your DPF clear.

I had the power cable hard-wired by the dealer before I picked up the car. They used a fuse doubler and a female 12V socket to install it using the original 12V cable which came with the camera. Best part is having the garage do it meant it is covered by a warranty and it only cost £100 which I thought was a good deal.

MINI,3b2lt6,EmutheFoo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"You don't have to know much about car audio, but just have ears to hear music in all its difference. But that said, when done right, with all the proper components it is a massive difference. The mini being as small as it is you don't need that big of a sub. But bigger means louder, more booming and shaking. A good sub would make listening to you music, be it hip-hop or blues, much more enjoyable on the lows of the sound spectrum. If you want good quality with a modest head unit, in can be done for about 600 for a stereo, an amp and sub. If you want to upgrade speakers for better mids and highs. Maybe another 150. I've shopped around and gotten deals and gotten it done on the cheap. I've also gone crazy and out a few grand into it. At one point I had a sub woofer which alone, without the box weighed 89 pounds. But again, for a mini, a ten inch would be more than adequate. 2 or 300 watts would be perfect. And you could go for sound quality instead of speaker loudness. I know there's a lot of info but I hope it helps."
MINI,3b2lt6,BTallack,2,Thu Jun 25 19:25:38 2015 UTC,I had a local car audio shop install a sub and amp in the trunk of my Mini Convertible.

MINI,3b2lnh,cziiki,2,Thu Jun 25 13:41:40 2015 UTC,"Listen for ticking/rattling in the motor during idle, especially when they first start it up.  Timing chains have been known to stretch out in Mini's in the 2008-2012 engine models fairly quickly and it is a costly repair (2400$).  If previous owner didn't watch oil levels the problem can surface fairly quickly, some people report under 15k miles, most average in the 30-50k range though.  It is more of a problem on ""S"" models though, so, there is that going for ya.  Honestly, with 18k miles and 9 months left on warranty, its a fair deal I think but I would still try to talk them down some more.  I just sold a 2010 R55 with 43k mi for over 13k.  But it was a bit more desirable (Manual, ""S"" model).  You kind of sound unimpressed with the Automatic; If your end game is to replace this vehicle shortly  maybe you should just lease a new Mini for a couple of years and stay on the lookout for a used one with the things you really want?   Also, I could envision Clubman's losing a bit of resale value due to the new body shape coming out."

Price wise I'm going to attempt to get them to drop down to 14k if I can, as I'm paying straight cash upfront.

MINI,3b2lnh,reddbdb,2,Thu Jun 25 15:46:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a fellow Clubman S owner here in Madison.  My advise to you is that you take this for a long test drive.  Get into some stop and go traffic, get on the Beltline Highway, and get into some hills.  See if the non-turbo 4 cylinder is responsive enough for you with the automatic.  Keep in mind if you are going to be hauling kids around.  The extra weight will effect performance. If it is responsive enough for you after test driving I see no hesitation for you there.    I decided my self that the non-s would not have have been enough for me.  But, that's me.    This is a good price with the mileage and year that I have seen in our area.  It's good there is warranty left on the car, piece of mind fro sure.  Coopers after 2010 have a lot of improvements to big problems that were in earlier Gen2 models 2007-2010.  Keep in mind though You are not buying this for Honda reliability.  Be prepared for some sort of repairs.  You are buying this because it is fun to drive and it has character.  If you are at all worried about repairs I would suggest looking at some used car warranties.  Good luck"

MINI,3b28d9,Sleber,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:13:04 2015 UTC,I usually go with whatever premium synthetic is on sale. I've seen dyno slips where royal purple posts a couple HP gain and know some people who swear by it but for the most part any good premium is going to be on par with the next.
MINI,3b28d9,ShoeBurglar,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:31:40 2015 UTC,"I run royal purple in my R53 as it doesn't burn/leak oil very quickly, that being said, my advice is if you have an 07-10 cooper s run a cheaper synthetic as it burns very quickly by comparison and I know it would impact my budget pretty heavily  buying a quart of royal purple every thousand miles. If you run a Cooper or a later S model, go for it on the royal purple or ams oil performance level oils if you run it rough, or you can't go wrong with Mobil 1 or now mini's home blend of oil is shell synthetic, previously it was a Castrol synthetic. When we get cars that are 2 quarts or more low and they don't want to buy the oil to top it off we'll use a cheaper brand like wolf's head to top it off, with the logic being even though wolf's head isn't great it's still oil as opposed to two quarts low."

MINI,3azvrw,legsintheair,3,Wed Jun 24 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.    My Cooper 2 door was in the shop a few weeks ago and they gave me a 4 door loaner.    It sucks.  Trying to get in and out of the front door was a pain.  They are just too short.  I hated it.  This from a 6'2"" woman who thinks one of the best things about her MINI is how much interior room it has and how easy it is to get in and out of.

MINI,3b1mk0,baruroot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:12:39 2015 UTC,"tire pressure dash light    Did you check your spare tire too? Also, runflats will look properly inflated even when they aren't. Check using a tire pressure gauge.  I'm guessing you'll be due brake fluid. You can see what's coming up through the OBC by pressing the button on the left stalk and going into the check-info and service-info menus. You can also find the maintenance section in your motoring manual and find more info and what the little icons mean there."
MINI,3b1mk0,UhOhPoopedIt,2,Thu Jun 25 11:21:58 2015 UTC,I find that the higher profile tires MINIs typically have are very hard to tell if they're too low. Mine were 15psi low and you'd never know it by looking.
MINI,3b1mk0,Fozee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:50:09 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if it would need at least one set of brakes if neither have been replaced yet.  I think I had one set done around 26k and the other in the mid 30's.  I fail to remember whether it was front or rear that went first.  At a dealer a set of brakes (front or rear) is gonna run $300-500ish with labor depending on if you need new rotors (highly unlikely).  If you need all 4 done its like 500-800.  Prices are wild at dealers.

MINI,3ayoco,wanderingkale,6,Wed Jun 24 15:47:19 2015 UTC,Happy about the engine options. Not happy with Mini making bigger and bigger cars. The old Clubman was the perfect active lifestyle Mini for my spouse and I. This maybe too big for us. We want to replace our Clubman when it hits 100k next year but we will give it a test and see.
MINI,3ayoco,wanderingkale,3,Wed Jun 24 18:19:04 2015 UTC,"Despite the similar name, this Clubman is not replacing the old Clubman in the MINI line-up. The F55 4-door is the R55 replacement."
MINI,3ayoco,Thenadamgoes,2,Wed Jun 24 20:17:09 2015 UTC,"True enough I suppose. I guess I really liked the old Clubman with the suicide door and non-hatch back rear doors but not the huge long body of the Countryman. Really, the big (and maybe only) selling point will be the TDI or Hybrid engine options. Although if they adopt the rear bolt things from the R60/R61 so we can use the Mini Bike Rack and Cooper Crap screw in trailer hitch, that would be a nice bonus."
MINI,3ayoco,reddbdb,5,Wed Jun 24 20:52:31 2015 UTC,I keep saying I won't get another MINI.  Then they keep introducing things I want in a MINI...

As a current Clubman owner that is some stiff competition going against the 4 door GTI.  My guess is the GTI will also be $1000's less comparably equipped too."

MINI,3azpsx,iamnotapainter,2,Thu Jun 25 11:42:04 2015 UTC,Sorry for the late response found a whole setup at the junkyard today score. Good luck with sale though. I'm sure it will go fast that's a good deal.
MINI,3azgpu,taubut,3,Wed Jun 24 19:12:01 2015 UTC,"Dealer markup on all of those is about half the price quoted to you. So if they offer a $3000 extended warranty, they're paying half that. If they want your money, they'll haggle with you.   Personally, my evaluation:   extended warranty: worth it for a new model MINI such as the F55/56. BMW new models tend to have teething pains. tire protection plan: usually costs more than replacing a tire. How bad are the roads near you? extended maintenance plan: utter rip off. After your pre-paid 36 month maintenance is up, find a local shop with some BMW experience and go there. Or do it yourself."
MINI,3azgpu,bratling,2,Thu Jun 25 02:27:13 2015 UTC,"Extended maintenance plan covers the cost of oil changes, brakes and the like for the specified time.   Extended warranty cover the entire car and extends the standard warranty.   If you intend on keeping the car OEM and not modding it then they make sense for your situation since you intend to keep the car for some time. Being this is the first of a new generation for MINI and knowing the way BMW and MINI use this time to fully finish testing these the extended warranty is a heck of a good idea.   The tire thing, to me, not so much. then again, I had new wheels and ditched the runflats before the car was even broken in."
MINI,3azgpu,MotoringAlliance,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:37:14 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for the reply!  Are the warranties something they add to the price of the financed car or is that something they have you pay in cash right then?
MINI,3azgpu,MotoringAlliance,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:03:58 2015 UTC,They will be very happy to add it to the financed amount. Dealer makes money on all that stuff too. You can negotiate the price of these add-ons.
MINI,3azgpu,The_Kurosaki,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"You can if you purchase them from BMW. I have an extended warranty with the dealer included in my car payment but It's with the dealer (can repair my mini in any certified shop so w/e). So it's not the ""Mini Warranty"". I considered the Mini maintenance plan for my R60s but they (BMW dealer) quote me $2.3k. For extending the maintenance plan 2 years... no way Jose. So depends on you and what you want and can pay for."
MINI,3aze28,_maybe,2,Wed Jun 24 18:52:22 2015 UTC,"Speakers are the weakest link. Just dropping in a set of 6"" coax into the front will make a huge difference. Next step is a set of components with tweeters in the A-pillars, and just disable the 3.5"" mids in the door pulls.  Next after that is an amp. You can fit a good amp easily under the passenger seat below the floor.  The head unit is the most troublesome to replace, and least necessary. MINI's system puts out a nice flat signal to the front speakers; there is no need to correct any bad pre-processing. The rears have a sharp dip at 70Hz; depending who you ask they either compensate for a resonant frequency in the hardtop cabin, or have intentionally crippled the rear to make the HiFi option more attractive to casual buyers.  My solution was:   Integral Audio wiring harness ($100 on Amazon) JL Audio XD200/2 2-channel amp (the JX360/2 was much too long to fit) Infinity XREF 3500cx components: 6½"" drivers for the lower door panels and 1"" tweeters installed in the A-pillars OEM A-pillars from the HiFi/Harmon Kardon options; you can buy these for about $35 each from any dealer I put the crossovers behind the air vents by the doors; you can pop off access panels at each end of the dash. Lots of space in there.  I bypassed the factory speaker wires in favor of running heavier wiring. I take no foolish chances; factory wiring is meant to cope with maybe 15-20 watts? I put some DynaMat on the body panels behind the lower door speakers. I have no idea if it helps but it makes me feel better :) buying power cable made from pure copper costs more but has less resistance and thus runs cooler even if you suck entirely too much power. I used 4 gauge because I like overkill. See your amp's specs for minimum size. If you cheap out on wire and use copper-clad aluminum, get at least one gauge size larger than minimum.   Hope this helped!"
MINI,3aze28,bratling,2,Thu Jun 25 02:47:58 2015 UTC,"Sweet! Thanks for the detailed answer. When you say 6"" coax in the front, you're not referring to a 6"" long coaxial cable, I'm guessing. Is a coax speaker 2 cones mounted on the same assembly?  If I'm not concerned about having too much volume the coax speakers should do the trick and fill in the high frequencies, right?"
MINI,3aze28,bratling,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, sorry, coax is speaker nerd for ""two drivers in the same assembly, a tweeter in front and a mid-woofer in back"". They're useful for spaces where you can't just put a driver anywhere. Like cars. :-) they usually have a built in crossover network to ensure the tweeters only get the highs and the mid woofer the lows.   Spend some time on Crutchfield.com seeing what fits; their data is pretty good. They charge full retail but in exchange you get outstanding support forever, and they're really good about returns. Worth it. Especially if you aren't experienced but want to do it yourself."
MINI,3aze28,bratling,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:34:56 2015 UTC,"And yes, coax speakers will give you much better definition of the highs and free up the mid woofer for lows.   Consider speakers with tweeters you can point; you'll never get great stereo imaging with tweeters at your ankles  but that can help.  If you are feeling ambitious though, component speakers — sets of matched tweeters and mids usually with a crossover — will really improve the experience of music when you can put the tweeters at the base of the A pillars. You don't have to replace the trim like I did; you can surface mount them instead.   But seriously, any decent pair of speakers will be a huge improvement over the factory setup. No amp required; my wife's Countryman has aftermarket speakers in the doors and no amp. Sounds clear and sharp and plays loud enough!"
MINI,3az9fa,Kevpem,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:18:12 2015 UTC,"It's well worth doing if you're on the fence about it, just don't be surprised at how much louder it is.  Has anyone else completed this mod on the standard cooper?"

MINI,3azcts,wildfire359,2,Wed Jun 24 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"I suspect you could put something like this on the front of your car with no repercussions since they aren't real plates. one time on an old vehicle I had plates up (one in window, another in the frame) from two different states because I had recently moved. Cops pulled me over because you can't display two sets of plates.

MINI,3awzyo,radoster95,5,Wed Jun 24 11:36:54 2015 UTC,It felt too cramped compared to 3 door because frameless door are gone and doors/windows themselves are tiny.

If I needed the extra room, I would at least consider it. As it is, happy I got my Clubby when I did.  Edit to add: I actually think the hood on the non-S looks better than the S in the F series. The hood scoop looks pinched to me."
MINI,3awzyo,DriftwoodBadger,2,Wed Jun 24 05:41:56 2015 UTC,True that.
MINI,3awzyo,suburbdad,2,Wed Jun 24 11:34:31 2015 UTC,Agreed. They should have just ditched the hood scoop. It does nothing functional.

MINI,3axwhq,cercetas23,3,Wed Jun 24 11:30:44 2015 UTC,"The F56 (2015) is a completely different car from the R56. Different chassis, engine, transmission, turbo, everything is based on the BMW 1 series chassis and the B48 2.0 liter engine, which is the same engine you will find in the BMW 225i, 3201, and 330i. Power changes from the Prince N18 1.6 liter motor are 181 HP to 189 HP, and torque moving from 177 lb-ft, to 207 lb-ft, which is significant. The JCW F56 has 228 HP and 236 lb-ft of torque, which is a pretty big bump from the R56 JCW at 208 HP and 192 lb-ft of torque.  If you do end up getting the R56, stick to the later models with the N18 engine, as the N14 was very prone to problems, which are in the 2011+ models."
MINI,3axwhq,Harmonic_Content,2,Wed Jun 24 12:33:56 2015 UTC,"Should I just wait some time, untill I can afford to buy a F56? Do you think its worth it, if you say its a totally different engine, etc."
MINI,3axwhq,Harmonic_Content,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:50:05 2015 UTC,"I would drive both and make up your mind after that. The interior in the F56 is ridiculously comfortable, and feels much nicer, but the ride and driving experience are a bit more cushy and less connected to the road. There is a trade off, and it depends on what you want."
MINI,3axwhq,Harmonic_Content,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:06:25 2015 UTC,"What would you say, if I will get the ~6-7k cheaper F56 Mini Cooper S and maybe some months later upgrade it with the JCW Tuning Kit? Will it be like the original JCW, or are there any notable differences after the upgrade?  Some people mentioned, the upgrade costs ~2-3k extra."
MINI,3axwhq,Harmonic_Content,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:37:04 2015 UTC,"The JCW kit is just an ECU tune and exhaust, without tips, and it's about 3k installed. It doesn't include the intake, upgraded injectors, brakes, or any of the other JCW goodies."
MINI,3axwhq,Harmonic_Content,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:31:36 2015 UTC,You really seem to know a LOT about MINIs :)  Have you already driven both - the R56 JCW and F56 JCW? rethorical question I guess :D  How does the R56 JCW sound compare to the F56's? Is the F56 louder / more bubbling than the R56?
MINI,3axwhq,Harmonic_Content,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:26:38 2015 UTC,"I have driven an R56 JCW, but not the F56 JCW. I have driven an F56 S, which was very nice, and the sound was pretty similar. The F56 JCW is much louder and poppier, especially with the dual mode exhaust.   The interior in the F56 is fantastic, especially the seats. I wish I could put the F56 seats into my R53 JCW."
MINI,3axwhq,Forgotoldname1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"Argh, but yeah. I guess I wont buy a F56 S/ JCW since they are still pretty expensive for me, personally.  Also I guess there aren't that many used F56 JCW yet with ~30-40K KM.  Maybe I will just wait for them to get cheaper through the year.  What do you think of an R56 JCW with ~50K KM? 22K€ Or even an R56 JCW GP with 70-80K KM? 18K€ Is that too much already for a MINI to be generally considered in good shape?"
MINI,3axwhq,isthisoriginalenough,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:43:15 2015 UTC,"The GP would be a great catch, as those are pretty much instant collector's items. Plus they are a lot of fun to drive. You would just want to check the service history and try to determine how the previous owner drove it. With a GP, you can be pretty sure they drove it pretty hard."

The seller basically said that motor, gearbox and clutch got changed in 2012 from a BMW workshop and since then it drove another 12k KM.  This sounds extremely well for me, especially for that price.  That is a R53 GP, correct?"

MINI,3avljs,DePiddy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"I've (sadly) never driven an R53. But I've owned an R58S for 3 months now. I have mild regret on the purchase and do wish I had gotten an R56S or even F56S, but my regret is very mild. My complaints are the visibility is quite poor (I've gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me much anymore, but it's a fact, you can't see jack out of this car!) no moonroof option (just not an option at all on the R58), and the car from certain angles looks amazing, and from other angles it looks hokey and odd.    Other than that and the obvious two seats, it's pretty much straight up R56 in every regard."
MINI,3avljs,tortus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:29:01 2015 UTC,I've always thought the profile of the R58 was really odd.
MINI,3avljs,DriftwoodBadger,2,Wed Jun 24 05:36:32 2015 UTC,"I went to test drive a f56 jcw but they only had automatics :( I did sit in one tho and the interior is amazing. I think my R56s is definitely comfy, but my god the f56 is such a step up inside. I might convert to a jcw f56...."
MINI,3avljs,Melfuaru,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:40:23 2015 UTC,"So, from what I understand, the first JCW '15 manuals just hit the US a few weeks ago and they're already on to '16 models if you order now. I swallowed my regret that my dealer didn't have any manual JCWs in stock and drove the automatic they had on the lot. I can honestly say, I had a lot of fun on the drive. I'm kinda sad about the interior, because although it seems to be higher quality materials the overall aesthetic is a move towards the blandness of a honda or toyota. I do like the giant red toggle switch to power on and off the car, but I wish they'd thought about the fact I'd need to put my key somewhere while I drive. My r56 has comfort access, so it doesn't need to have the key in the ignition but it was always a convenient place to stick my key if the cupholders were needed."
MINI,3avljs,nuixy,2,Wed Jul 15 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"For some reason I just can't get myself to like the F56. I've been driving our shop F56 S around a lot lately and it just doesn't do anything for me. I had a 2010 R56 S for a few years and now I currently have a 2006 R53. For me, the R53 is truly what the MINI  should be, small, nimble, quick and lots of character. I feel like that is all lost in the F56. It feels big to me, it doesn't handle quite as well, the sound of the motor just isn't impressive at all. The F56 has some power and the seats are pretty nice, I just think it lost the edge that made MINI great."
MINI,3avljs,anuppercasej,4,Wed Jun 24 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"You are probably just missing that supercharger whine. For people coming from the R56 instead of the R53, the F56 sounds just fine. It just looks like an abortion."
MINI,3avljs,DriftwoodBadger,2,Wed Jun 24 05:34:28 2015 UTC,I really hope they fix the nose on the F56 during a mid-generation refresh.  That's really all that gets me.
MINI,3avljs,Mehknic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:37:11 2015 UTC,What's different on the F56 nose from the R53 or R56? I bought a 2015 F56 and I don't see any difference from 1st or 2nd gen MINI's -  I can't tell the difference when I pass an oncoming MINI on the road other than it's an S or a Justa
MINI,3avljs,Trendy2,3,Wed Jun 24 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"R53 - the hood comes down, grill stops at a distinct lip.  R56 - hood comes down, grill stops at a distinct lip.  F56 - hood just blorps into the bumper.  Reminds me of the last generation of Thunderbirds (though I realize there are many differences, don't shoot me!)  I don't know why, but the cutoff there just sticks out like a sore thumb to me and feels very un-Mini.  I realize it's entirely personal preference."
MINI,3avljs,Mehknic,2,Wed Jun 24 14:52:45 2015 UTC,"There's two problems. One is, as /u/Mehknic pointed out, the bumper is very unattractive. The other is that the nose extends farther out from the front wheels than it used to. Part of what made MINI be MINI is that the wheels were pushed to the extreme ends of the car. Unfortunately,  I believe it is European regulation that forced them to give it a longer nose overhang, but their execution of it does not look good. The headlights, for example, look sunken in now, as if they left them in place, but grabbed the front grill with forceps and stretch it out. The bumper/grill makes it look like it is in special ed, and that hood scoop looks weirdly pinched. Overall, it's just not a very attractive front end. Also European regulations forced them to raise the belt line up a bit, which makes the whole car look a bit chubbier even though it is the same overall size. Everything else about the car is fine, although some people find the HUUUUGE tail lights to be a bit much."
MINI,3avljs,DriftwoodBadger,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"Driving around In the F56 with the windows down, the motor sound makes me think of a weed whacker. With the R56 there was a little growl along with the turbo whistle, and yes, the supercharger whine of the R53 is fantastic."

MINI,3ao7tk,Audiontoxication,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:56:03 2015 UTC,"I was getting the trifecta every day.that is until I cleaned the wheel sensor connector on the frame by the driver side front wheel. Mine was full of axle grease or power steering fluid. Either way, after cleaning that connector a year ago it hasn't returned. Your mileage may vary."
MINI,3ao7tk,fprintf,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:09:57 2015 UTC,"Ours happens every summer when the temperature gets hot enough. Unfortunately there is no way to tell exactly which sensor it is without investing in the proper scan tool. From what I've been told it is most likely to be the front left sensor, and as you've found out, generally the OEM ones or ones from a reputable online vendor work properly."
MINI,3anftz,onlyeatpancakes,2,Sun Jun 21 23:00:09 2015 UTC,When mine was showing up I ran a diagnostic and it was showing misfires. I could be wrong but its somewhere to start. Good luck!
MINI,3anftz,Sleezybreezy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:19:54 2015 UTC,I ran a diagnostic but got no codes. Probably because the warning light went off.
MINI,3anftz,Mumma66,2,Mon Jun 22 03:49:05 2015 UTC,"the half light means reduced power due to any number of reasons, normally a power-train fault."

MINI,3anftz,domep1ece,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:07:35 2015 UTC,Yes the battery terminals are clean and the coolant looks good. Is there any reason why the warning went off and got full poer back?
MINI,3anftz,onlyeatwaffle,2,Mon Jun 22 03:47:38 2015 UTC,"How many miles? Sounds like a coil issue. If your coil is beginning to fail, when you have the engine under heavy load or in boost you might see misfires on one of your cylinders, then under normal driving condition everything could be just fine. This could be a bad coil, loose ground wire, or bad spark plug."

MINI,3ao8ni,_zsh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:46:32 2015 UTC,What would be the most reliable year to get?
MINI,3ao8ni,suchacoolusername,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:40:18 2015 UTC,"The last couple production years of most generations are often the most reliable. I only have experience with the R53, but the 05 and 06 are regarded as being the best of the first gen. The 2nd gen cars a bit different.  Maybe someone can chime in with reliable advice there.   The more work you can do yourself and stay out of the dealer, the cheaper it'll be. It helps to have a support group--other people with minis. And of course, it helps to know people at the dealer, because inevitably you will have to be there for something.   Doing your own wrenching can save you a lot on labor and parts. A lot of people can't or won't do it, so you have to decide if that's right for you."
MINI,3ao8ni,_zsh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"If you're buying 2nd Gen, only buy 2011 or newer. The '07 to '11 series of the Gen2 are notorious for problems."

MINI,3am1re,DePiddy,4,Sun Jun 21 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"If you had the car for 5 years and AC hasn't worked in all that time you probably need to have the system fully vacuumed before recharging it. When in AC system leaks air can also be introduced into the system which also introduces moisture.  if you don't vacuum out this air it can cause huge problems to the rest the AC system you'll be looking at $$$$ getting it fixed. If your mechanically competent you can google how to vacuum and recharge an AC system on youtube and if there's autozone near you or another auto parts store you can probably rent ,possibly for free, a manifold set and a vacuum pump."
MINI,3am1re,hotrods1970,2,Sun Jun 21 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"Try recharging, if that doesn't work test to see if the compressor is engaging. Ours wasn't so we found a magnetic ac clutch and replaced it in 2 hours. Ice cold ac now."
MINI,3am1re,Chinampa,2,Sun Jun 21 21:57:28 2015 UTC,Almost definitely the AC clutch. You can change it yourself for $200-300 but you'll need to take it to a professional to have the system charged since you will have opened it in the process.

MINI,3ajzuj,dankturtle,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:09:56 2015 UTC,"If you have an R58 (coupe) or possibly also an R56, this knob does fully fit. The shifter on my car is different from what all the tutorials on the net show. But that silver base ring that holds the bottom of the boot in does come out, it's a bit of a bitch but it will come out. Then from there the top of the boot has a small plastic ring inside of it. Just take it out, and strap the boot down onto the craven metal base with a zip tie.    End result looks great, I'd even argue most would think this is the stock shifter. It feels a lot nicer than the stock one too."

MINI,3acbsh,tokencat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how the hubs failed for not being clean, it's relatively regular for us for brush off rust and coat the hub where the wheel makes contact with antiseize so there's no problems with the wheel/hub. Try driving at low speed with the parking brake lightly applied to try and grind off some of the rust on the rear rotor, in a pinch/to save customers money we've used the same way to get rid of high spots on the rotor caused by rust. It's easy to do a botched job of the brake on these cars and similar ones because if you don't line the springs back up and pop them in right it wears very oddly and in ways that just don't make sense. The power steering on these cars is notorious for leaking and the whole pump had it's warranty bumped out to 10 years which might just be missing it on this car in question. The bulbs and housings are typically only held in by 2-3 bolts or nuts a piece and can probably be done yourself. Tie rod could be anything, likely hit a pothole or curb with a good amount of force, they really aren't something I messed with a whole lot."

MINI,3acbsh,mr_mooses,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:02:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sounds like a bad situation. It's hard to tell wether or not the seller knew about it or not, but sounds like the safety inspector was either crappy, or used because he's known to let things slide.   As far as what to do now. Fix the bulbs yourself for sure, brakes and rotors can be done yourself too if you're not afraid to get dirty, the power steer pressure line probably can be home fixed as well although i don't know much about them except that their notorious to fail.   Or put it up for sale with as is condition and hope for the best. There's not much any of us can tell you other than yeah, those all sound like reasonable (except the dirty hubs) things to break and need replacing.. It really sucks that it happened to you though. That's why it's recommended to get a private garage to inspect a vehicle before purchasing but who's got the time for that."
MINI,3acbsh,mr_mooses,2,Fri Jun 19 00:05:45 2015 UTC,I am located in Toronto I don’t know any good mechanics. I don’t have that much experience working on cars except the basics. I don’t exactly have the tools or the time. How do you find the right buyer for a car in this condition? What exactly do I say on kijiji or autotrader?
MINI,3acbsh,suburbdad,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure..  I'd just say, for sale '05 mini coooper 177k in the title, and then in the description provide plenty of pictures of the car including the list of work needed from the last garage. I'd definitely go get your money back from the first garage, or demand that they fix the brakes correctly...  Say something about the car being too small for what you needed or something along the lines of that so that people don't question why you've only had it for 4 months, and then i'd say something along the lines of hitting a pothole and bending some suspensions parts to explain that work needed. I'd be suspicious if someone told me your story and then tried to sell me that car.   As long as you're honest with the person buying it that this is the work that needs to be done to pass inspection then everything should be ok. People are going to try to use that to really low ball you, so make sure you know how much the car is worth, and how much the work would cost at a trusted independent shop and price accordingly. Don't let people bully you into giving it away for free, but understand buying a car that needs work is risky and has diminished value. The people that are going to want this car are the people that know good cheap mechanics, are mechanics, or are willing to take the time and turn some wrenches themselves as these (at least i think so) can be done during a few weekends in the driveway.  If you really wanted to go the extra mile and get the best price. Look up on northamericanmotoring(nam) the procedure and prices of all the parts listed and add them to the description.   ie needs blinker bulbs - $5 (amazon link) front tie rod - $75 (part link) estimated 2.5 hour job (procedure) with standard tools in driveway for mechanically inclined or $500 at shop etc.    it sounds like she over extended her budget though, and is in need of cash quick .. selling the car without losing too much will take time that she doesn't sound like she has.  goodluck."
MINI,3ac39f,ismartallen,2,Thu Jun 18 22:01:29 2015 UTC,There is a really good chance that it's the A/C compressor clutch.

MINI,3a6eui,rftiiv15,7,Wed Jun 17 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say you got the car for a pretty good price at 9k.   But you should have known about those issue before you bought and used them to negotiate.. especially with an '07.. the chain should have probably been under warranty as well,  or at least the tensioner.   the clutch going that early is weird, but you never know how the previous owner drove/how you drive. that's a wear and tear part, just like the pads and rotors. Well I'm not really sure how to check the life of a clutch, the brakes should have been decently easy enough to check on purchase, and they're not very hard or expensive to do.   the thermostat housing leaking is a common well documented problem, and i don't remember it being terribly difficult/expensive to fix.  Could have done that and the oil filter at the same time. Might as well done the tubo oil supply line at the same time with detroit tuning's super kit.   Now you really shouldn't have to do any of that on a such a new car.  and even if you did it really shouldn't have cost you that much even if you didn't do any of the work yourself. but. that's the life we choose to live to drive these cars. it's unfortunate :("

MINI,3a6eui,gdizzle4,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:23:18 2015 UTC,the way I was taught to test a clutch was to put it into the highest gear (5th or 6th) at around 60km/h and mash the gas and if the revs shoot up but you don't go anywhere then your clutch is slipping
MINI,3a6eui,mr_mooses,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"You can start the car in second without any gas just by slipping the clutch.   I've heard that you just let the clutch out quickly in second and if it stalls it's not slipping, but if doesn't that means it is.   I've also heard the highest gear and mash the gas to see if the rpms and the speed are dependent.

MINI,3a6eui,oh_lord,3,Wed Jun 17 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"Excellent choice.  That would be my first choice if my wife could drive a manual.   Sorry too here about your troubles.  Unfortunately, many of these are par for the coarse for the 07-10 S. My R55 as had the turbo Oil line leak, timing tensioner replaced, valve cover replaced, water pump, and the faulty intake replaced that was not designed for cold weather.  I'm watching the thermostat housing like a hawk."

MINI,3a6eui,mr_mooses,-4,Wed Jun 17 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Just sold my '06 r53 for a 2013 Mazda 3. Literally everything about it is better; power steering works at low rpm, I can hit speed bumps without my spine getting rekt, smoother shifting, better ride.   Plus the whole I can drive it down the road without worrying about it fucking exploding and costing me another 2k. I put 20,000 miles on my r53, and I loved it but damn you cannot put a price on peace of mind."
MINI,3a6eui,coolkidjf7,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:51:11 2015 UTC,I've never heard of someone complain of power steering in a MINI. I've heard a lot about removing them completely when they eventually blow up.   How's the mpg on the speed 3 though? I know it's a crapton faster but i thought it was wicked thirsty as well.
MINI,3a6eui,Grundlestiltskin,2,Wed Jun 17 18:55:58 2015 UTC,I have the I touring. Gets about 35-37 mpg

MINI,3a6eui,Melfuaru,2,Wed Jun 17 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah they certainly are. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't have the gocart feel of a MINI and it can't up and pass at highway speeds like the MINI could, but damn I love that Mazda."

MINI,3a7yha,loft_music,3,Wed Jun 17 22:57:32 2015 UTC,O2 sensors create voltage and send that voltage back to the computer to calculate how much fuel to burn. Having a low O2 voltage would mean either the engine is running lean due to low fuel pressure/injector problems. Or the O2 sensor is reading falsely and the computer is flooding the engine to compensate. Both situations are quite bad. Get it to a shop
MINI,3a7yha,ShoeBurglar,2,Thu Jun 18 00:43:37 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info I'll try to get it to a shop soon!
MINI,3a7yha,Audiontoxication,2,Thu Jun 18 02:02:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly if it's O2 sensor related, get it looked at. I don't recall my code but I ran it for a long time, it's what eventually destroyed my motor.   Also look on NAM for that code, you may find some good info."
MINI,3a7yha,Audiontoxication,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:20:53 2015 UTC,I found a bit more info but it sounds like I should just get it into the shop soon I'll probably stop driving it till then
MINI,3a7yha,Audiontoxication,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"Good idea to not drive it if you have that option. When you take it the shop just keep it out of boost and you should be fine. Easy throttle and keep it under 4k. Accelerate like your SO is wearing their best clothes holding a nearly full glass of wine. I have to drive like this everyday until my motor and oil are up to temp, I have a gauge though.   Does it idle rough?"
MINI,3a7yha,chio_bu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:07:59 2015 UTC,Great explanation haha! Yes it has been lately and I didn't really pay attention to it till today when I barely started using the AC. It sounded rougher than normal so I turned that off then saw the light had turned on and pulled into auto zone as soon as I could to get the code. I was reading that Sensors might be under warranty for this year up to 100k but I missed that by 4k already :/ oh well
MINI,3a7yha,Audiontoxication,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:40:05 2015 UTC,"If you can, take a look way under the passenger side intercooler horn. There's a rubber hose that plugs into it, if that's loose or broken you can get poor idle and maybe off readings with the O2 sensor. That hose controls the fuel pressure regulator based on boost.   Fingers crossed for you that it's a simple fix."

MINI,3a7bwj,maddriven,3,Wed Jun 17 20:12:11 2015 UTC,"Would you prefer fewer available options to keep the price in the $23k-$28k range, more standard options to keep the price in the $29k-$34k range, or an options free-for-all that gives you a price range from $23k-$42k?  I don't see a big deal in adding 50% to the MSRP, especially if your getting options you want.  You can think the options are overpriced, but minis aren't meant to be econo-boxes."
MINI,3a7bwj,WhoIsPurpleGoo,2,Wed Jun 17 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"This is pretty standard for cars. My last car was a 2011 Ford Flex. You could have a 7-passenger box with wheels and an engine for something like 25K if you wanted. It went all the way up to over 50K with all the options on it.  Furthermore, not limited to cars. Go to Dell's website and pick a computer to buy, desktop, laptop, doesn't matter. The next page is the options screen. Want a better video card? Bigger hard drive? Bigger monitor? Faster CPU? More RAM? Doubling the price of a computer with options is trivial to do.  Hell, even good cameras are like that. If it's tech, there are options. You pay premium for the perks."

MINI,3a3hi9,Coleslaw19438,2,Tue Jun 16 22:54:47 2015 UTC,I am looking at doing some handling mods (planning to do an eibach sway bar) and want to do the shocks while I'm at it. Here's what I'm thinking (r56 justa btw)   This is my current daily driver. Will be for the next few years and then it will probably be relegated to fun weekend car at which point I'm probably go nuts with some other mods.    2.I'm not really interested in lowering the car at this point. I have a few steep drives/curbs on my daily commute and don't want to scrape!   Being a daily driver I'd still like to be able to run to work without rattling my teeth out of my head. But I do enjoy doing some driving on back country curvy roads on the weekend and would like to improve handling to make it even more fun!
MINI,3a3hi9,Minidooper,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:01:32 2015 UTC,I've also been looking into these shocks.

MINI,3a2lbk,Reinhold_Messner,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"Head unit is the place to start. They're not hard to install and will give your speakers some more power than stock. You can also customize more easily how it sounds. If you want it to sound any better, you're going to have to check the budget. I say this because you'd probably want to upgrade all 4 speakers(just the front if you're on a budget). The stock speakers are pretty much made cardboard so find a decent pair that sounds nice and put them in. If thats still not enough, try getting a 4 channel amp to get even more power than the new head unit. Then if thats not enough, its time for a subwoofer."

I removed the rear seats and pulled the panel back enough to remove the old speakers and slip the new ones in. If I was going to do the rears again I would completely remove the panels.

MINI,39xhba,howlermonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:59:30 2015 UTC,How many miles did you have on your original ones and did you notice a ride quality difference (not laptimes). I'm just asking if it is a clear difference in FEEL compared to shagged out useless dampers that are stock.
MINI,39xhba,Anofir,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"I put Megan Racing coilovers on my R53. I like them, but the ride is harsh. If you live somewhere with bumpy roads, it can be a bit like falling down a flight of stairs. Handling is fantastic though."

MINI,39ui6o,redbarnes,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no I didn't. I took it back to my speed shop so they could remove all their testing equipment from the car before the warranty adjusted got a look at it. If I had known it was going to be this long, I would have had them remove the equipment and then take it down to the Mini dealer.  Lessons learned."
MINI,39ui6o,Melfuaru,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"No that makes sense! Honestly, you end up paying for it by going with the dealership instead of a smaller, private shop. My car was undrivable by the time I got it to Mini, so my only option was to have it towed from shop to shop and get the best price or just leave it at mini where they ate the cost of my rental. I think between the tow truck and the rental, going with a less costly shop would have ended up being about the same."

MINI,39u9rp,GhostalMedia,2,Mon Jun 15 01:53:58 2015 UTC,"I had an F56 2 door loaner while my car was in the shop. I agree with your overall impression: Like the engine, hate the car. It's ugly, it looks ungainly, and the interior feels like you're driving a generic car. Sitting in the car, there's nothing that particularly screams out ""MINI"" for me. The light ring was an amusing gimmick, but hardly a selling point. No center speedo, no MINI-shaped climate control buttons, no more hidden compartment, the tachometer felt like an afterthought instead of the star of the show. I forgot to check if the internal ambient lighting still had a Party Mode, but it wouldn't surprise me if they took that out too. The door lock and window switches were allegedly moved to the door because they were hard to use when the cup holders were in use. I don't argue that this is an actual problem in the Gen2s, but they didn't fix that, they left other switches in the same place, and there were better solutions than moving the switches to the doors.  Overall the car just feels much more subdued and suburban than the previous generations. They went for ""inoffensive"" on the interior, and pretty much nailed it. But that also means it's just uninteresting. The interior is dull to sit in.  Mechanically a huge step forward. Huge step back in every other regard.  And yeah, those wheels are a crime.  I have to point out though, you made a lot of the hood scoop being non-functional. It's not functional on the R56 either.  Edit: I have to add, I hated the clean modern white on black GUI on the driver display. It puts you asleep just looking at it. I love the warm luminescent industrial glow in my R55."
MINI,39u9rp,DriftwoodBadger,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did not like fake scoop on R56 either. Hidden compartment was still there. I read on motoringfile that it was disappearing from new models though, not sure which. Did not check for party mode but multi color lights are there too. I also heard the argument that window switches are hard to use with cup holder occupied, my answer to that is that you need to get a ""right cup"" :-)"
MINI,39u9rp,DriftwoodBadger,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:08:19 2015 UTC,"The compartment is disappearing on 2016 model years. So, basically cars rolling out of the factory right now. Any stock still on the lots probably has it, but not for much longer."

MINI,39u9rp,GhostalMedia,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:46:54 2015 UTC,"I really dig the new interior and I'm also ok with the new lights. Now that I'm used to it, the older interior and lights look less refined to me.   Just my 2¢.   That said, the window controls are too far back, and the audio controls on the wheel are backwards as fuck, but I only notice it if I drive my other car for a few days then hop into the Mini."

MINI,39um8j,cosmic_punk,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:38:22 2015 UTC,"How many miles a year do you drive? If you average around 12k a year the 6 year maintenance plan will save you a bit of money long term,  the extended warranty on the F55/56 is too early to tell if it's value for money, but typically from dealer warranties do pay for the needed parts and labor except in instances like spilled drinks shorting wires (bmw used to put window switches near the cup holder, you can guess how that worked out)  and mini has modules under the seats. So if you drive it regularly and hit the miles limit it's a good deal, if you're more likely to hit the year limit first think a bit about it first."
MINI,39um8j,Mumma66,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:10:52 2015 UTC,"I have purchased a 3rd party warranty before for my wife's VW Jetta. It was the worst care I ever owned. It was in the shop all the time. After a few years I traded it in just to get rid of it. I figured it up and I pretty much broke even. So few years later I got a used Mini and decided to skip the warranty because it was not worth it on even a horrible car.... Well... It would have been worth it for me.... I had to buy a new engine when mine destroyed itself at 97k miles. Warranties are usually under $2000.... The engine was $3800... Not including labor (basically free because I have an awesome friend help me) would have been around $5000.... Depending on the year of the mini you are getting and how much service you plan to do yourself, it may be worth looking into it... Just my two cents... Look around ... Minis can be a bit unreliable and the warranty may be worth it..."
MINI,39um8j,AskikaMan,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:18:14 2015 UTC,"Yes to both on our 2010 Clubman and our 2014 Countryman. It has already paid for itself on the Clubman. While the maintenance plan is a bit of a break even proposition, I liked basically paying for it up front. Its like any insurance, you're paying more for the peace of mind if you worry about something happening past the manufacturer warranty."

It was one of the scariest moments of my life but I am forever indebted to my MINI for getting me where I needed to be in a pinch.

MINI,39unuj,GoldAuFTW,3,Sun Jun 14 22:53:16 2015 UTC,"I bought my 2005 MCS with 93k miles in March of this year and have had to do a good bit of work. Parts are, to me, cheap (coming from a Mercedes AMG anyways). I have done all the work myself due to my local Mini dealership quoting me a ridiculous $5,000 in repairs. So far I have done power steering supply and return lines, front control arm bushings, oil pan gasket, crank position sensor o ring, water pump with various related gaskets and flanges, and clutch slave cylinder. $500 in parts/fluids and MANY hours later my R53 is sorted...for now. Repair guides are plentiful and thorough and are fairly straight forward. Aftermarket performance parts are super cheap and even cheaper if you source parts from the active forum marketplaces. I love my R53 but prepare to get your hands dirty often to keep up with maintenance."
MINI,39unuj,vGEMATRIAv,2,Sun Jun 14 23:21:09 2015 UTC,"Well, you've basically just sold a Mini, I love ""built not bought"" and that sounds perfect with the aftermarket options. All I have to ask now is did the size of the engine bay make life difficult when getting your fingernails dirty or is the space more manageable than meets the eye in photos?"
MINI,39unuj,vGEMATRIAv,2,Sun Jun 14 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"Well, about that. Space is pretty cramped, but to do most front end work you need to put it in ""front end service mode"". You remove the front bumper cover, aluminum bumper, disconnect some lights, unbolt and remove crash tubes, and slide the radiator piece forward to give you more wiggle room or just remove it completely by letting it dangle to have full access to the front of the engine. The first time it took me an hour an a half to do but I can do it in under 30 min now. That was for the water pump though. Other routine maintenance isn't too bad; it's a little 1.6 after all. https://scontent-atl1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t31.0-8/10845881_1070671522946744_6371882263398938818_o.jpg pic for referance"

That's just about quashed any reservations I had, thanks a lot for taking the time to explain"
MINI,39unuj,Audiontoxication,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:54:18 2015 UTC,"To get it that open, you have to disconnect the radiator hoses and lose most of your coolant, so don't expect to have that much space for every repair. Keeping the hoses attached will still give you about 3-4 inches of room though, just enough to get your hand in there with a ratchet. I'm still in college and by no means an experienced mechanical expert, but I still feel that this is an easy car to work on. I put in an Alta 22mm rear sway bar, TSW chasis x-brace, M7 cold air intake, and John Cooper Works catback exhaust with each job taking about two hours. I still have some H-sport adjustable rear camber links and an H&R front sway bar to install. I got all of them off of either eBay or  the forums used for $1200 and they have made a world of difference.

Aftermarket Mounting brackets are pricey too. Not because they are that expensive to make, but because few are sold and the price has to be high enough to pay for the time that goes into designing them, testing, and setting up a production run.  I see the same thing in motorcycles. Parts for BMW and Ducati bikes are expensive as hell. Parts for Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha are dirt cheap."

My first couple cars were stick but my last car was automatic and I got bored of it after a year and a half. I thought I was pretty good at shifting before and I too have been having a little difficulty shifting smoothly in my Mini.  If I have Sport Mode On I seem to be able to shift a lot better while simultaneously releasing the clutch and hitting the throttle like I'm accustomed to. But if I have Sport Mode Off, I find I have to gently touch the throttle, let up maybe a half inch off the clutch and pause for just a split second for it to catch smoothly.  Hopefully like others say it'll become more natural. I'm not sure if it's shift point is that much different or I've just been away from stick for too long."

Also have a mini or a German car shop check it out before you buy it. A regular ma and pa shop will more than likely miss things. If it has a bunch of mods on it also advise staying away.

MINI,39lk1p,Andevu,3,Fri Jun 12 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"There is a lot missing here....  what work did they quote you that price on? Just ""fixing it""?  The defect in the r56 is that the timing chain tensioner is shit and gets weak after a while, causing the chain to be loose. This damages the chain, the guardrails, and other bits it touches. If you catch this early on, you can replace JUST the tensioner for the tune of around $500-$600 (US). Or do it yourself for free (which is very easy) to the tune of $40 (US) for the part.  If this has been going on for a while, the chain is most likely compromised and the whole kit needs to be replaced. That would cost around $2300 (US)."

MINI,39kofh,mmcheesee,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:31:27 2015 UTC,"your diff may go boom btw.   just a friendly FYI.  your drivers side wheel( .. well.. my drivers side.. your passenger.. let's just go nautical and say port side wheel)  (which has a shorter half shaft, no IMS bearing and less drag) is spinning a LOT faster than your starboard side wheel.   Due to the way a differential works, this means that the gears within the diff are spinning and allowing those wheels to move at different rates.   The factory mini diff's are.. somewhat known... for the pins that hold those gears on to come out when they spin fast.. such as when doing a burnout... at which point they may or may not contact the housing of your transmission and wear a hole through it...   TLDR: if you are going to do a burnout, put in a proper LSD first."
MINI,39kofh,ransom40,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:00:37 2015 UTC,I would just vote to not do excessive burnouts in a justa at all. They are not full build race cars and if you do this stuff long enough its gonna cost you a lot of money. If/when that pin gives out its gonna cost him a trans case and a dozen hours of labor to get it back on the road.

You can probably sort it out yourself if you're handy; most of that $950 is labor I'm sure. I would search around, or potentially get someone with a Bentley manual to scan the necessary pages you need to learn how to replace the module yourself."
MINI,39c1sz,pkillian,3,Wed Jun 10 20:05:21 2015 UTC,yup had a similar incident i was cleaning my sat nav screen in my mini when i looked back i noticed a big line on it i thought i had just missed a bit on closer inspection the anti glare had come off!!.  So i contacted bmw seeming my cars under warranty explained the situation to them and they got back to me with a £1400 bill.......  SO naturally i told them to stick it bought some metal polish off of amazon for 5 quid removed all the anti glare and perfect new looking sat nav screen.  My advice would be if you have a friend thats car savvy let them look at it first it could just be something really simple.   Does the car still start and run?

MINI,39c1sz,sgallan89,2,Wed Jun 10 20:01:55 2015 UTC,i wouldnt personally check with another garage they can give u a bit more information on what actually needs done.
MINI,39c1sz,Five_bucks,3,Wed Jun 10 20:03:24 2015 UTC,What if you pulled the seat and checked/cleaned the connectors to the module?  I wonder if the garage is just more willing to replace an entire module rather than troubleshoot a connector issue? Especially since it's a safety device.  A bottle of isopropyl alcohol and some elbow grease might be all that's required. Maybe :/
MINI,39c1sz,Mumma66,3,Thu Jun 11 13:02:23 2015 UTC,"You have to program a module after replacing it, better believe no one at the dealer or even an independent shop wants to chance bricking the whole K-CAN because there's an issue with a module someone else installed. Also I would imagine it's actually mostly parts, to replace the MRS module, it's remove the seat, remove a cover, pop in new module, program car, ship it. To be fair the MRS module MUST be torqued very specifically otherwise the sensors will not work or just as bad trigger during acceleration or a stop. The MRS module controls ALL the airbags and electronic passive safety features. It's unfortunate but it's likely they're not ripping you off. Modules are expensive, and MINI of USA pays for warranty repairs, if MINI of USA doesn't approve repairs because of spilled drink the dealership has to pay for the parts and labor somehow. Also I'd be more worried leaving it in and risking it shorting and deploying the steering wheel airbag or the seat/side curtain by mistake. Also the R50-52-53 made between 05-08 have an upcoming recall for the passenger seat occupancy detector mat, not the MRS module."
MINI,39c1sz,Mumma66,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:48:51 2015 UTC,"Damn good answer! Talked to an independent shop today and they verified it was mostly parts that were the bulk of the repair cost. And that the labor would entail removing the seat and pulling back upholstery. Ugh, might have to bite the bullet on this one."
MINI,39c1sz,Mumma66,2,Thu Jun 11 23:16:24 2015 UTC,"Well I would hope I was close, I'm certified to to work on the SRS systems in these cars haha. Honestly, the system isn't something you want to mess around with, all the connectors have locks grounding bridges tensioners or more. In addition the wires have very very tight tolerances, if a wire has to be spliced more than once it has to be replaced according to BMW/Mini among other things. Plus, if somethings not right you could have them deploy when it's not wanted or not deploy when it's wanted both of which are something that honestly make me paranoid, plus static can be enough to trigger one of the igniters for the bags. All in all, something you should really get done when you can. Also unfortunately not really doable at home, as the module will kill itself without programming once it realizes it does not in fact line up with the Car Access Systems codes/vin number. It's so people can't rip modules from your car and drop them in theirs chopshop style."
MINI,39c1sz,MzScarlet03,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to answer my question! Seriously, you explained it better than both shops I took it to did. Now, you wouldn't happen to have a spare control module laying around anywhere would you haha!"
MINI,39c1sz,AvastYeUpboat,2,Fri Jun 12 06:17:51 2015 UTC,"The only modules I have are a few busted ones I kept as souvenirs on non warranty work, as mini wants all warranty parts returned to them to verify our work which is why we can't sneak things through they wouldn't approve as they really do double check our diagnosis and will revoke payment if we even fill out the paperwork slightly wrong. But yeah, I feel like that's an issue we have not just at Mini but in the automotive field there's a lack of communication/understanding between the service  department and customer, and taking a minute to explain the srs system why it's important, and what it does and the control modules role, can make the difference between someone feeling like it's a scam or at least understanding the estimate and why it's recommend. If it's a legit repair there normally shouldn't be a reason why it can be justified with an easy to follow description.  Also for your troubles fun fact about why there's actually a module/expensive electronics under each front seat, the MRS (previously ACSM)  and the DSC Sensor unit (and its predecessor ASC)  both are located there one under each. Both have multiple sensors for things like acceleration in all 3 axis, as well as angle of the car relative to the acceleration, pitch is even measured as well, but for those to work they have to be as close to the center of gravity as possible, which is unfortunately right under our seats where we've all spilled something. With this information though, bmw/mini's are able to with the addition of wheel speed sensor data correct things like over steer and under steer in the least invasive ways possible through application of abs to specific wheels or last resort measures like cutting throttle. Hope it all works out for you man, and have a better understanding of why we have modules in seemingly stupid locations."
MINI,39c1sz,AvastYeUpboat,2,Fri Jun 12 11:20:32 2015 UTC,"The recall is for the sensors in the passenger seats that detect if a child or adult is sitting in the seat and determines whether the airbag should deploy. They fixed this for me under warranty in 2009 when they first knew of the problem with these defective sensors (not a recall, but me demanding they make my airbag work), but now they want to fix it again pursuant to the recall."

MINI,39ardx,KarmaticEvolution,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:12:42 2015 UTC,"Model year:       The model year of a product is a number used worldwide, but with a high level of prominence in North America, to describe approximately when a product was produced, and it usually indicates the coinciding base specification (design revision number) of that product.  The model year and the actual calendar year of production rarely coincide. For example, a 2009 model year automobile is available during most of the 2009 calendar year, but is usually also available from the third quarter of 2008 because production of the 2009 model began in July and August 2008. When a new model is introduced there may be an additional delay to retool and retrain for production of the new model. [citation needed]  The variables of build date and design revision number are semi-independent. There is no natural law that forces one to be strictly correlated to the other, other than that   future design revisions cannot have been built in the past, and most products, in most contexts, tend to be built to the design revision that was the latest one at the time of building.   The idea of strongly correlating build year to design revision number took many years to become a meme in consumer culture.

MINI,398doz,GodzillaFlamewolf,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:31:33 2015 UTC,Well i just pulled off the oem knob and  the green one fits on the stick and you just aline it up and tighten 3 hex pins that grab the stick. The only problem is that the leather gaiter has nothing to connect to but mine stayed upright and you can't even tell its not really connected like to the original knob.

MINI,396dmi,denko_safe_cats,2,Tue Jun 9 18:58:38 2015 UTC,Congrats! You just bought the most fun car you'll ever own! How many miles? Are you a mechanically inclined person? Willing to get under the hood?
MINI,396dmi,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it. It's my first time driving a mini and driving stick, so it's all a learning process. Came with 59k on it and one previous owner who only got it serviced at mini dealerships.  I am technically minded but I don't know all THAT much about cars. Just basic stuff like replacing brakes, checking fluids, changing oil. I definitely want to learn more and I figured this would be a good car to become a ""car guy"" with."
MINI,396dmi,denko_safe_cats,2,Tue Jun 9 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"This is gunna sound rough but I'm giving you tough love from a fellow mini owner. You bought what is referred to as an r56 with the n14 motor. The r56 with the n14 engine (07-10) are extremely problematic cars. If they haven't already gone, you can be guaranteed to have to replace your thermostat ($500), your water pump ($600), your gasket seals ($200-$300), and your timing chain ($2300). They take premium gas $$$ and burn oil bad, about a quart every 1000 miles. At about 10 bucks a quart, if you do 12 thousand miles a year, thats an extra $120 in oil outside of regular oil changes. The '11 to' 13 Cooper S's come with the n18 motor. Fewer issues but still high maintenance. Get a fund saved aside for when this stuff goes and hopefully you're willing to get under the hood and do some of the work yourself."
MINI,396dmi,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"You are right, it is the slightly more problematic engine. I checked the carfax when I bought it and it's already had it's thermostat and water pump replaced, the timing chain tightened, and one gasket replaced so it should be good to go for at least a little while longer"
MINI,396dmi,Melfuaru,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:08:01 2015 UTC,"Great! Careful with that timing chain though. ""tightened"" is an easy way to sell it without fixing it. If you let that snap on you, you'll total motor. Looking at 7-8 grand for a new one. I would get it to MINI and have them do a FULL look over."
MINI,396dmi,denko_safe_cats,2,Tue Jun 9 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"I'm planning to do that this weekend. I also bought it with a 3 year powertrain warranty that covers engine, transmission, and wheel issues, so it shouldn't be that big of a dip into my finances if there is something wrong with it.  However, so far, the only problem I've discovered is my shifting."

MINI,398fpn,cosmic_punk,2,Wed Jun 10 00:27:35 2015 UTC,"Just bought an R56 S recently, I had it checked out at a mini dealer and paid about 140 for a full inspection which also included a full fluid flush and oil change, after having the car for only 5 days they found a leak in the transmission which would cost me 750 dollars. Thankfully the dealer is covering this!! Bottom line is, if your going 07-11 get the dealers warranty! Sorry for the rant lol, but I have an automatic as well, and I'm already wishing I had a manual. So if you kno how to drive stick, get a manual!! As far as features I can't live without, probably my sun roof and turbo charger, everything else is moot"

Let me put it this way, you need the S version if you're getting a mini, no two ways about it. Lane switches are a sinch, about to get cut off on the highway?? No problem, speed ahead comfortably. I test drove like 5 minis, 2 turbos and 3 regular. The base versions are just expensive hatchbacks, where as the S version is a car that will develop a personality of its own"

MINI,398fpn,Mumma66,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:13:20 2015 UTC,"The Cooper in the F series Mini's is more than capable, that being said the sports package for the cooper rounds out the options I would want nicely with 16"" wheels led headlights and the sports seats. In my R53 though I do miss the seat warmers my R50 had, and I get a lot of mileage from the sunroof. As far as serious maintenance issues I've seen, it's all mostly been unique instances of bad from the factory not so much a trend of x part is breaking. Still early to determine that though. But keep in mind it's all in house bmw so a lot of these drive train components exist in their cars as well so they're staking their name on these engines in a way they haven't in previous generations"
MINI,398fpn,reddbdb,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:23:09 2015 UTC,"This is from a 2010 Clubman S Perspective.   Bluetooth and Sunroof.  Bluetooth just makes everything easier.  Sunroof just for cooling, makes the cabin feel larger than it is, and resale value. I had to go automatic because of my wife. I actually enjoy it, it's reposive and great for a lot of traffic I'm in. And if you go automatic I would get an S model.  The auto with the base model just sucks all the fun out.  Especially if you are getting a 4-door model with the extra weight. Yes.  I have the infamous prone N14 S Engine 2007-10; it is documented everywhere.  The newer 2011+ models the consensus is reliability is better.  Jury is still out on the newer F series."
MINI,398fpn,DriftwoodBadger,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:43:50 2015 UTC,"I have an automatic. I know a lot of elitists on here swear by the manual, but there's no shame in an automatic. It has a manual mode where you can control the gear yourself, either by paddle shifters on the wheel or with the gear shift stick. The paddle shifters are awesome when you need to make a pass, just a quick thumb and you're ready to rocket. Maybe I'm just a filthy casual, but I like to be able to do other things when I'm driving around town besides giving the car a 20 minute hand job on the way to the grocery store.  Feature I couldn't live without? Rain sensor.  No maintenance issues at all yet, but we bought new (2013), and we've only put about 29,000 miles on it so far."

MINI,396cec,khayber,3,Tue Jun 9 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"I had an '07 MCS with the hyper-sport package.  It was fun as hell, but really harsh on long rides.  I now have an '11 Countryman S All4.  It's OK, but nowhere near as fun as the coupe was.  It feels heavier than it is.  Possibly the non-awd version is better.  I am leaning towards selling it and getting either a coupe or the new 4 door."
MINI,396cec,Rahoolwho,2,Wed Jun 10 00:16:43 2015 UTC,"That's very helpful actually! I wondered about the countryman losing the fun factor a little bit. And I have an 08 mcs, and I really don't mind it on long drives actually. But I have softer tires put on instead of run flats! That helps a considerable amount. I spent the day at a mini dealer and stared at a 4 door S for like 3 hours, I need one now lol"
MINI,396cec,khayber,2,Wed Jun 10 00:28:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got rid of the '07 cuz it was burning too much oil.   Also I thought I wanted the 4-doors / more space more.  As for the ride, I also got rid of the run-flats, but the hyper-sport package was nearly JCW.  The normal S models are noticeably softer without being soft.  Anyway, the new 4-door seems like a nice compromise."

MINI,3985jo,Razzamafoo,2,Tue Jun 9 23:11:25 2015 UTC,"between the two? '14  if you want a drivers car and don't mind some elbow grease - R53. Bare-bones, more tactile, more visceral.   R56 - a little better looking, technically more powerful and faster, but more numb and disconnected IMO. not near as much fun  F56- even more power, but even more numb in my opinion. Lost a lot of it's actual character from the chasis and imperfections and they attempted to compensate by making the visuals quirky and hoping no one would notice. Also feels like the marketing teem actually included ""hipsters with $14 coffee's"" in their target audience (and this is coming from a 24 year old...)   All the gens are quite different. personally I prefer feeling attached to my cars, but then again that is also why i dislike driving trucks, my project car is a twincharged mini, and my daily driver is a Cayman S that I am on track to put 20k miles/year on. I drive for the experience, and to me the F56 just feels like a car. Is it still fun? yes. But no more so than a gti. It seems just a bit too complacent and too well sorted and balanced to be a mini. (I know that sounds weird but if you go drive and old one, then an r53, then an r56, then an f56 you will notice the progression I speak of)  the F56 is a good car, but it has just lost a lot of it's mechanical quirks (apart from reliability which i expect to be.. well.. mini - ish .... ) which made it special and instead has substituted a bit of goofiness in terms of the visuals."
MINI,3985jo,ransom40,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:19:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want. For me personally, the 2014 model had some stuff on the interior rearranged from previous gens. I really liked how they changed things so that was a big decision point."

MINI,3942bl,heathenbeast,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:07:11 2015 UTC,Are you just asking because you want the look or do you want real CF? If its just for the look you can get high grade 10yr vinyl laminate online for pretty cheap.  And if you decide  you want a change just heat and peel it off. A real CF roof would be a major project for a specialist shop the vinyl you.could do at home.

MINI,3942bl,RacingHen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:08:57 2015 UTC,"that doesn't save weight. that adds weight and is just for cosmetics.   OP wants to actually cut the roof structure off, have a new one made from carbon (I assume with built in aluminum stringers for rollover protection and energy absorption) and have it bonded / fastened to the factory chasis and shave 40+ lbs off the roof.   and as a backup to just have the sunroof pannels made in carbon so that you at least remove the glass."

MINI,393e71,Leiryn,2,Mon Jun 8 23:55:27 2015 UTC,The issue (as I know it) is that the ECU loses connection with 1 or more sensors.  Normally the issue is at the sensor but it could be a problem between the two (or the ECU it's self)

MINI,393e71,Iheartbaconz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:06:16 2015 UTC,Wht sensor did you replace? The ones that detect the low brake pads? Or the actual sensor that sits down in the knuckle? I found that the back part of the front wheel bearing can be an issue. Mine wasnt solid and wad rusted out. There is a part of the bearing that the sensor sits up against and if its not solid it will give you the lighta. I replaced the hub(drivers side) and the  sensor and  the lights went away.

MINI,392zpc,WhoIsPurpleGoo,2,Tue Jun 9 13:12:31 2015 UTC,Not an expert - just a random MINIac - but there are many aftermarket roof racks available so you shouldn't have a problem.  I think they are designed to raise far enough the roof to allow normal operation of the sunroof.
MINI,392zpc,dewey454,2,Mon Jun 8 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"The roof racks clip into holes in the trim around the edge of the roof. These holes are there on any Gen2, as far as I know. They can be very hard to spot if they've never been cracked open. I'd say the MINI in question should definitely still have them, since the stock roof rack is not intended to be used luggage-against-roof, it's intended to be used with a basket or whatever."

MINI,392zpc,WhoIsPurpleGoo,2,Wed Jun 10 18:48:10 2015 UTC,I have a R53 with a sunroof. I use a Yakima base rack and a varnished wood cargo/bike rack on top of it. The sunroof clears just fine. I chose rhe Yakima because it sits lower than the Thule while still providing room for the sunroof. I avoid the oem rack as you need to drill holes in the roof to use it afaik.

Shovels, tiki torches, backpacks, whatever; the previous owner hauled kayaks with the thing. No problem whatsoever.  The only problem I have is that sometimes its hard to get the rack in 'right'; it took me over an hour to get it installed in a way where it didn't feel... precarious (previous owner had removed them for daily driving, and if I weren't so stubborn about never having to do it 'right' again I'd remove it for fuel efficiency, too)."

Drove it right back, said ""thanks"" and bought the base.  The base is a hoot to drive in the sense of a traditional sports car ... just a bit underpowered (but by no means slow), high revving, absurdly responsive, more reliable, better gas mileage (~38mpg at 70+).   But I can't say I've not had regrets, that extra ~70hp is something I do find myself craving. But I know me too well ... if I had it, I'd use it, and goodbye drivers license.  If you can keep yourself under control, use the power judiciously, and accept the higher maintenance and operating cost, the S is uber-fun.

As someone who sold cars, I can tell you that is almost certainly not the case.   He has some ulterior motive.

MINI,38yvh6,Leiryn,2,Mon Jun 8 04:52:11 2015 UTC,"The non s doesn't have enough hp to really negate the advantage of an s, but that's not what's relevant as it's more than torquey enough to get around on the daily having some fun. In simpler terms, the cooper can move quickly till you hit highway speeds at which point it just doesn't have the top end of a Cooper S. Honestly, if you're not super into the performance and just want a bit of fun the Cooper should suffice and you'll get more benefit from the better gas mileage. Full disclosure I work for Mini but not in sales. Also as a brand mini wants to typically move up market establishing its self as more premium brand than before, and there's more profit for sales in an optioned up s model than a lower priced cooper. So if they're pushing the base model there's probably a genuine belief that you'll be a happier customer in a Cooper as opposed to an S.  This of course doesn't apply to the R56 non turbo'd coopers, however the newer F55 and F56 models the cooper no longer feels like it's slow and just not what it should be around town. Keep in mind the B38 has as much torque as the W11 motor at 3 thousand RPM earlier. Though the R53 does have more top end hp at ~160 hp as opposed to the ~130 hp of the  F55 cooper"

Ultimately you are buying a car for you, not for the salesman.  To put it another way, imagine that the salesman grew up in a family that prized economy above all else and his primary desire for a new vehicle was fuel economy.  If Kimi Raikonnen comes into the dealership it is *possible that Kimi might have a different set of priorities when purchasing a car.  You are no different than Kimi in that respect.  You may not be an ultra-rich race car  driver, but i would be willing to bet that your desires might diverge from the salesperson's desires at some point.  Buy the car that works for you, not the one that works for the dealer.  If the dealer is pushy, go somewhere else.  You will be happier in the end."

It feels quicker than my two previous cars, a Lancer GTS and an Elantra GT, both of which had about 50 more HP than the MINI. I do wish I had the S model because of the styling (hood scoop, center exhaust). I still love the 'Justa' - it's absolutely a blast to drive and feels a bit mad in sport mode."

I must say at low speeds they feel exactly the same. Both are engaging and fun to drive. I ended up going with the S, because I liked the center exhaust and fake hood scoop thing (looks a little more sporty) and I wanted the more ""performance"" version of the car. I think the salesman wasn't trying to upsell the base i honestly thought that I would be satisfied with the base car and be happier saving a few thousand dollars.

That said, it would be obvious that a paid off R53 with a new clutch and about 1.5k in upgrade would run circles around a fJCW.  Trust me, I had a 2010 JCW and loved it.  I miss the sunroof, HIDs, Bluetooth, aux input, sport mode torque dump, and the gas mileage, but I do not miss the nervous feeling everytime I would start the car.  Timing chain tensioner aside, the  N14 has some serious engineering and design flaws that will rear their ugly head throughout the life of the vehicle.    The R53 does as well, but we are talking about gaskets and seals, not major issues with combustion.  I mean, MINI went from being ranked 17th in overall reliability on its 2k6 models to dead last on its 07 models.

Right now (I may change my mind at any time) I plan on driving it into the ground and keep fixing/modding as I go.   There is something liberating to have a paid off car that I enjoy driving even more today than I did the day I bought it. I'm actually looking forward to each repair job.

If I've been driving a lot around town, then fill up and hit the highway, the range goes up and up and up because my average MPG is going up. Likewise if you start hot dogging it around town, your range will drop faster than the actual number of miles you're driving because your MPG is falling.  Range = gallons in tank X average MPG.  A change on either side of that equation will change the range number.  As for the gauge still reading full, that might be an issue, you should've used 3-4 gallons by now, that's about 1/4 of my tank."

Eventually you just get used to the quirks of the fuel gauge.  I don't even pay attention to it, just the remaining range.

That was the first run/year of the Gen2s, they're a completely new car from the previous year 2006 models. The first run of anything is always going to be the most problematic. Even people who are buying the brand new F56s right now are probably going to have more problems with them than people who buy an F56 in another year or two. Basically, you bought the least reliable model MINI ever made."
MINI,38v235,DriftwoodBadger,2,Sun Jun 7 19:28:54 2015 UTC,"It was just incredibly unreliable, as you've seen. It was in the Gen2 Coopers from 2007 to 2011, and they're well known for having all the problems you did plus more. In 2011 they replaced it with the N18 engine which pretty much fixed everything.  I mean, not ALL of them, but enough of them that they gave the MINI brand a really bad reputation that it's still trying to recover from. It's possible the one they replaced it with is fine and will never give you any trouble, maybe they even got an engine that had all the known faulty parts preemptively replaced. Or maybe it's just a stock N14 engine and you're rolling the dice on doing the water pump, timing belt, and transmission all over again in a couple years. Nobody here really can tell you for sure. But look around in this sub, and every thread about buying a used Cooper will include repeated admonitions of ""Don't buy 2007-2011."" It's a very trouble-prone drivetrain."

If you're a novice you can request an instructor to ride with you for a session to help you learn the track and when you should be doing what. Passing is only allowed on certain parts of the track and only when the car being passed signals OK for the pass (you can see the civic in front of me signal me to pass him on the right when we enter the back straight). If anyone doesn't play by the rules they get a black flag....3 black flags for behavior and your tossed out and banned from future events. They want to keep everyone safe and everyones cars whole.   The cupholder is a dealer available option. There is a factory Mini part number for it and you can order it from any dealer...at least for the R53.

Not that they're expensive, simply that it's not the easiest car to own. Seen them pop up on ""worst cars to own"" lists. Not that that'd stop me from owning one. And there can be bad cars no matter what the brand, so just try to stay on top of repairs and maintenance. Pain in the butt sometimes to work on and maintain imports, maybe you got a maintenance plan with your purchase? My girlfriends grandma has a VW Passat and when some fixes came up, of course they turn to me to handle them. It's the most ridiculous car to work on, the brakes can't be changed without a magic little tool only found at the VW dealership (a local brake shop tried removing them for 3 hours before giving up), and when I went to replace a broken headlamp bulb I found that it was impossible to do without removing the tire for access. :/ And or course, parts are pricier than domestic cars. Hopefully this isn't the case for minis, but idk. As for the snow, I'd imagine it'd handle like any other front wheel car in the snow. Not sure if it's an advantage to have a short wheelbase or lighter weight. Maybe invest in good all weather tires.  Not exactly pearls of wisdom, I know."

The r56 with the n14 engine (07-10) are extremely problematic cars. If they haven't already gone, you can be guaranteed to have to replace your thermostat ($500), your water pump ($600), your gasket seals ($200-$300), and your timing chain ($2300). They take premium gas $$$ and burn oil bad, about a quart every 1000 miles. At about 10 bucks a quart, if you do 12 thousand miles a year, thats an extra $120 in oil outside of regular oil changes.   The '11 to' 13 Cooper S's come with the n18 motor. Fewer issues but still high maintenance.

For example, if the water pump goes: Look up how much it would cost to replace on a comparable vehicle, and then on the MINI.

Other than the slightly frightening experience of  driving through heavy rain in a tiny car, it actually holds up well as long as your tires are good.

Your A/C is a self contained system that has nothing to do with the thermostat.  Most likely there is a small leak in the ac system that cause freon to leak out.

Anywho, it looks like a hand-held rivet gun but instead of you sticking the stem of a pop-rivet into the end, it is a threaded insert that screws onto the gun and when you pull the handle/trigger, the threaded stud pulls into the gun which causes the threaded insert to expand.

MINI,38po5z,ransom40,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:02:46 2015 UTC,"NP!   I have a similar tool and tons of M6 rivnuts (but I'm in the US. Got the tool when I purchased my G-wing)   You will also need a center-point to hammer a dimple into the sheet metal of your trunk, and then a center drill to make a pilot hole so your bit does not wander for drilling the hole the insert is going into.   While an actual center drill is best, you can also get by with a very small drill bit to start the hole and then slowly work your way up. (start with 1mm bit, then do a 3, then 5, then 7, then 9mm at the end)  (my M6 inserts use a 9mm pilot hole iirc. Some may use a 9.5 or 10mm. Start with 9, thread the insert onto the tool and see if you can get it through the hole.   it does help to de-burr the hole somehow if needed. A small chamfer bit by hand is not bad, but an acutal de-burring tool is best.   You also may want to grab some urethane-based rust prevention paint (don't know if you can get POR-15 in the uk.. but it is the best state-side) and paint the drilled hole and let it dry before you install the insert. This prevents moisture from being able to get to the steel as well as preventing galvanic corrosion from the aluminum-steel contact between the nut and sheet-metal.  I suggested POR 15 because it wic's nicely and goes on incredibly thin while maintaining excellent coverage and is self leveling (will not show brush marks). And to top it off it is a urethane based coating so it is as hard and tough as nails when it cures. (be sure to wear gloves if you can get it. because if it sets up on your hands it is there until those skin cells are replaced! haha!)   Best of luck!

Maybe I'm crazy but you think the bottom line is to sell cars, so you do your best to retain customers. Repairs are reasonably priced, service is great and communication is outstanding.   Pricing on new and used cars should be easy to understand.

The r56 with the n14 engine (07-10) are extremely problematic cars. If they haven't already gone, you can be guaranteed to have to replace your thermostat ($500), your water pump ($600), your gasket seals ($200-$300), and your timing chain ($2300). They take premium gas $$$ and burn oil bad, about a quart every 1000 miles. At about 10 bucks a quart, if you do 12 thousand miles a year, thats an extra $120 in oil outside of regular oil changes.   If you are really dead set on an r56 instead of the older r53, get one between '11-'13. That is the n18 motor, not the n14. It still has a shit ton of problems, just a slight shit-ton less."

The word is derived from the Latin word caeruleus, ""dark blue, blue or blue-green"", which in turn probably derives from caelulum, diminutive of caelum, ""heaven, sky"".

I haven't personally had trouble getting into reverse ever but I have had issue going into 1st gear straight after coming from a higher gear.  Somehow it seems like if I wait a little while - a second or two at the least - moving into 1st is a much easier transition. I might have to double check later though, at some point it just feels natural to pause a bit before going to 1st.

MINI,38ntr8,thelamacmdr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:37:35 2015 UTC,"A couple things:  Has the transmission fluid ever been changed? (Lifetime fluid does not exist, screw you bmw.)  The reverse likely has no synchronizers, and the 1st gear synchros are by far the most used.   A few things to note with this:  Taking off the handbrake could potentially get everything moving enough to ease these shifts (assuming it's on), or letting the car slide slightly forward/backward if you are on a hill.  A lot of miata drivers shift into first then reverse to ease the shift into reverse, due to reverse not having synchronizers.  I find in my 07 mcs (and really in most stick shifts I've driven) that the shift down to first can be made much easier as you roll to a stop, rather than waiting until you are stopped. Usually only travelling a couple mph when I do this."

I have limited experience with the clubman, but mechanically it is much the same car as an R56 hatch.  The R53 is much more of a drivers car than the R56.  The later is softer and feels a bit more like a BMW than the older MINI.  I miss the supercharger whine, the exhaust burble, the better interior materials, and overall design.  Having said that, the seats are more comfortable in the R56.  The clubman has a pillar splitting the rear window that, when combined with the small rear view mirror makes for an obstructed view, but I have heard you get used to it.  My kids fit in the back of a clubman just fine.  I don't know what that says about adult legroom, but it should be sufficient.

MINI,38jwos,Jaxxxi,3,Thu Jun 4 18:37:18 2015 UTC,Beautiful car. Who found the oil low? Was it a MINI dealer? Was it you? You definitely can't go between oil changes without checking the oil level on these enginesas they  will use quite a bit. You should check the oil level every time you fill the gas tank . Mine uses  approximately a quart between oil changes and I change at 5000 miles. I did take mine to the MINI dealer in Portland Oregon and what they told me is Mini is still picking up part or all of the cost on these repairs but the car has to be under a hundred thousand miles. How long have you had the car? When you bought the car did you pull a Carfax if you bought it used? If you haven't got a Carfax you really need to get one. it will show any records of any maintenance done to the car and you'll have a better idea of what needs to be done yet?
MINI,38jwos,hotrods1970,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"Mini found the low oil, so I don't understand why he would tell me it's good for 7k and then fail to mention how notorious these cars are for burning oil :/ I suppose I didn't do my due diligence, but I also don't understand why my oil light came on so late! If half a quart is already super dangerous, then it should come on much sooner, right?  I've had the car for about 3.5 years, I bought it from Toyota and have a clean carfax that doesn't have any major work done on it prior to me buying it. Not sure how often the oil was allowed to get low like that, as I have never driven it to the light before now (the dealer was saying lack of lubrication is what caused the damage, and letting the oil get low too often would cause that).  It's currently at 78k miles, so hopefully mini can alleviate the cost some. I've read in a few other places that people have been successful in getting them to eat part of the bill, ""good will"" I guess."
MINI,38jwos,hotrods1970,4,Fri Jun 5 00:07:18 2015 UTC,I talked to a Mini specialist shop and he said he had a car come in one time with a half a quart of oil in the engine and the oil warning light did not come on. So no surprise there. Just kind of worrisome. A clean carfax indicates that no major updates have been done to the engine and you're going to be looking to doing those. In all honestly if you take it to a mini dealership and you have them repair all the things that are wrong with that you're going to have half the cost of the cars worth by the time you roll out of the shop with that bill. Your best bet is if you're the least bit mechanically inclined is to try to do the repairs yourself or find someone to help you do them. if you haven't yet join a Mini for I'm online there's lots of people on there that can give you pointers or maybe even get together to help you. I think NAM - North American Motoring is the best forum for people to want to work on their own cars.

I mostly just wanted a cute, quick car (which worked out), and a large repair bill, albeit unexpected, is one of those things that happens from time to time. I will have it paid off in September and can weigh my options a bit better, then (my mini will probably be more desirable with a brand new chain, if I chose to sell it).  Thank you so much for your advice though!"
MINI,38jwos,2legit2kwit01,2,Fri Jun 5 01:05:29 2015 UTC,"One mans opinion:  The ""oil light"" is really an oil pressure light.  The car can hack it, even overwork the oil pump and vacuum system to get it to an operating.    The kicker is, it doesn't provide enough oil pressure to allow the chain to take out slack until it is warm, hence the death rattle.  When I had an R56 I got the death rattle.  MINI does help pay for some repairs on some cars.  The deal was based on year and mileage, and proven service records, which was impossible to find on a used car unless they were present at the time of sale.  Good luck and I hope it works out for ya.  Know that independent shops can do it for 50-70% of the dealership costs, so there is that route."

MINI,38jwos,MacaroniMidler,2,Fri Jun 5 02:52:03 2015 UTC,"MINI offered to help cover costs, but ended up not doing it, due to me being unable to provide all receipts for oil changes during the life of the car, I was missing 1 from the previous owner.  Kinda made me upset, so my repair bill was $2000 which included a faulty module that mysteriously went bad at the same time.  The other repairs that I had (after buying it used from a Cadillac dealership) were the water pump, intake valves needed cleaning, thermostat, broken coolant expansion tank, and cracked turbo inlet tube (caused by a faulty Alta intake)."
MINI,38jwos,Ih8Hondas,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"Oh yuck :(  My thermostat was broken when i bought the car and it would use the entire tank of coolant in one trip (scary stuff, why don't they have temp guages?!?!). The only reason I noticed is when the car wasn't driving (e.g. at a stop light), the heater would go cold. Toyota did not cover that under the powertrain warranty, but I kind of threw a fit, so they ""only"" made me pay the $50 deductible.  I did speak with Mini today, no dice :( my car is too old (8yrs) with too many miles (78k). Honestly, if they covered even 25% of the bill, it would have kept me as a long time customer, but I've already had to replace the thermostat, clutch, flywheel, and now the timing chain and I love my car, but damn. I'm tired of the endless repairs. I pay it off in September, at least...  That really sucks they wouldn't help because you didn't have an oil change receipt from the last owner! I think as long as you got the car in good condition and continued with the recommended maintenance schedule... that ONE oil change probably didn't ruin everything."

The guy had all his service done at the same MINI dealership, then moved and I couldn't track down when he moved to and who he used, it was so disappointing for me on MINIs behalf.   Your story is a fairly common one, and I am sure you will have some other repairs happen soon.  I too love the vehicle and that is why I am so harsh of the N14, always discouraging people who come on here asking questions about buying a MINI.  Despite the problematic N14, the brand has so much more to offer with its other models and, more importantly, the community.  I hope it works out for you but would not be the least bit surprised if you dropped that thing like a hot tamale!"

The total quote was about $2k and I was going to shop around until I saw that there were a few people who were successful in getting mini to help, as this is a known issue (I think they're getting sued/have been sued for it already).  Yeah, I probably should be a good car owner and check my oil, but the mini tech said I was changing it too frequently and would be good at 7k, and I had no idea these cars were notorious for eating oil (you think he might have mentioned that as well?)  But who of us hasn't learned a lesson the hard way, right?"
MINI,38jwos,2legit2kwit01,0,Fri Jun 5 00:12:58 2015 UTC,Why would Mini cover something that happened due to owner negligence. How do you not realize you're that low on oil? These cars are notorious for both leaking and burning it. You should check it about every time you fill your fuel tank.
MINI,38jwos,MrBlahReef,2,Thu Jun 4 22:09:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm not a good car owner, because I don't check my oil, but I don't know many people who do that religiously.  How was I supposed to know it was that low? The oil light went on after the timing belt had started rattling and, imo, it was way too late then.  Also, a mini certified technician told me that I was changing my oil too frequently at 3k and I have the ability to go 7k. He failed to mention anything about these cars being ""notorious oil burners"" or that I should make sure I'm adding oil between changings. Maybe he was playing the long game?  Mini is/was actually getting sued for this issue, iirc. So, I didn't think it's all negligence as many people have reported the same issue and mini covered it under a ""good will"" program.  Maybe I'm still at fault, but it's worth a shot."
MINI,38iv7d,denko_safe_cats,2,Thu Jun 4 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"I would skip that package and just get the pulley, belt and plugs. The MSD coils have taken out ecu's and don't add anything. If your coil is old get a new OEM one. Same with plug wires, OEM. That tensioner stop will rattle it will make you crazy. I don't run a tensioner stop, I change my belt yearly though.   I'm not a fan of Alta but if the pulley is the classic type and not the v.2 one then it will be fine.   If you have no plans for track time I would go 17%, it adds more grunt down low."

MINI,38iv7d,Audiontoxication,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:52:07 2015 UTC,It's more fun on the street.  It makes a little more heat and puts the blower a bit closer to the design threshold at the redline. Most people don't spend that much time at high rpm on the street so it's not really an issue. The blower won't grenade if you hit your redline with a 17%. My redline is 7300 and is fine.  The reason to go 15% for track is less heat build up. More heat makes the ecu pull timing which decreases power. You can make it work with a 17% if you spray enough meth.
MINI,38iv7d,Audiontoxication,2,Thu Jun 4 17:26:10 2015 UTC,"Okay great. thanks for the info. So 17% pulley, shorter belt, plugs. anything else?  WMW has a nicer kit that really is just straight-forward instead of a lot of add ons:  http://www.waymotorworks.com/wmw-pulley-package.html"

Maybe I didn't have to pull the timing chain cover off, but I'm right there.  Six more bolts (plus the 11 or so on the cover) to guarantee that my timing is as designed?  I think I'll spend the energy on those bolts instead of struggling to get the piston and chain lined up.  Bought injectors and remote tuning device from his store and his cam from OutMotoring.  Fast with the canned tunes and answered questions within a day or two.

That will get you what you need for the pulley change.  I also agree on the ATI 2% or stock size dampener pulley, skip alta products.  Next look for a rear sway bar and some good coilovers.  As far as the tune, either make it to a tune party (often sponsored by clubs) or make it to a MOTD."

MINI,38iv7d,Pequa94,4,Thu Jun 4 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"15-17% is about the sweet spot for maximizing power while still minimizing heat soak.   A 10% would be a smaller power gain than the JCW pulley, 20% would be a bit too aggressive, and a 30% supercharger pulley would probably blow the shit out of the supercharger..."
MINI,38iv7d,ransom40,2,Thu Jun 4 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"has to do with the compressor curve. look up a pump curve on google. The SC is simply a twin scroll (or screw) pump.   The faster you turn them the more pressure they make, but at a cost of not being as efficient(may actually move less air mass, but make more pressure just due to heat. The key is to balance mass of air and heat generated so that it fits your intercooler setup and engine so that you can get the largest mass flow rate of air possible to the engine. 15% is actually the best (arguably) for top end power on the factory blower.   16 and 17 % are less efficient at the top of the rev range and provide more torque down low."
MINI,38iv7d,DePiddy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:52:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, so now I have a question. I installed a larger intercooler last year, and I'm thinking about bumping my 15% up to a 17% for a little extra low-end torque. Would 17% technically be more efficient for me compared to someone with a stock IC because I have a different, slightly ""colder"" setup..?"
MINI,38iv7d,ransom40,3,Thu Jun 4 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"ish. It will lower your output pressure (the intercooler will) and you will have cooler air but you will not be moving ""more air"" (you will but not compared to gains you may see with a turbo setup)   This reduction in pressure doesnt mean you are moving less air, it just means the air is more dense (at equal pressure this coorelates to it being cooler. this helps cylinder temperatures and detonation issues)   it also means you are functioning a little lower in the compressor map.   This is the compressor map for our M45 blowers  (or at least for an eaton m45 blower 5th gen.. close enough...)   http://locostbuilders.co.uk/upload/Eaton%20M45%20Compressor%20Map.gif  The green lines on the graph are the SC RPM's   the blue areas with numbers banding them are mechanical efficiency zones,   The pressure ratio is simply outlet pressure over inlet pressure. (absolute, not gauge - meaning what you an I are breathing is 14.7 psi and when you see 15lbs of boost it actually means 29.7 psia)   And the inlet flow rate is volumetric (which works but what really matters is mass flow to the engine in the end)   From that map we can see the compressor is most efficient at a 1.35 PR and 210 m3/hr inlet flow rate at a SC RPM of 6000.. and even at that it is only 65% efficient. (mechanical energy that made it into compressing air. A lot of the other energy went to heat and making noise)   Now, following those green curves as a function of pressure ratio we can see that you would have to cool the air a LOT and drop the pressure ratio significantly in order to make a substantial difference in the inlet flow rate.   this is some-what where water-meth helps.   Cooler air also lets you run more timing so it helps make power that way as well.   intercoolers make a much larger difference on turbo systems.   The turbo on my twincharge build is 99% mechanically efficient and the RPM's the turbine spins are due to pressure in the exhaust manifold and resistance to spin on the compressor side (pressure on the outlet of the compressor wheel that wants to force it to go the other way)   So if you intercool a turbo, the pressure drops, you have less resistive force and the same driving force so RPM's increase and it flows more air which creates a larger driving force (by making a bigger bang in the engine and more exhaust pressure, so it moves even more air and this goes on and on until efficiencies have the two equal out.   But on an SC the compressor is driven by the engine, so at a static engine RPM the SC RPM's will not increase to keep a set pressure in the intake manifold, so gains are a lot less and mostly for detonation issues vs flowing more air.   (you will flow a little more.. but not as much as with other boost setups. )   Hope this mostly makes sense..."
MINI,38iv7d,this_isnt_the_end,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, that actually makes some sense. Basically, a supercharger's RPM is in essence ""tethered"" by the engine, but a turbo's RPM is heavily based off of pressure, so it can me ""modded"" more efficiently than an SC?"
MINI,38iaz9,poeblu,3,Thu Jun 4 12:06:13 2015 UTC,This isnt a direct answer to your question but have you looked to see if there is any  local mini clubs to your area?

Anyway i drove several sticks and autos. The sticks all seemed clunky to me. Granted i wasnt used to them and they might have been worn as none were new cars. I ended up picking an auto with the sport wheel that has the paddle shifters.  A total blast to play with. Or you can slap the floor shifter left and up/down shift with it.

MINI,38fgn3,sheer_deer,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:01:55 2015 UTC,"To answer your question: it is both.  1) is this due to poor owner maintenance?  A lot of the timing chain tensioner issues are a result of low oil pressure, caused by low oil levels.  As a result, MINI changed it s tune, and now suggests checking oil levels every fill up.  There are lots of contributing factors relating to this, some of which are poor engineering.  Now I know how hard is it to check your oil, right?  Well ask yourself, when was the last time you checked your current oil levels in your car, and when was the last time you went 15K between oil changes.  2) Are MINIs poorly built.  In the case of your 2k9 JCW, yes.  For example:   Oil Consumption.  N14 MINIs drink oil significantly more than most cars, up to 1 qt every 750 miles.  Now, this is an understood fact, but in 2k9, it was just being understood.  People were not realizing their MINIs were consistently low on oil.    Unrealistic OIL changes.  MINIs came with a service plan, oil changes every 15K MILES!!!  Take that coupled with the oil consumption, spells certain disaster with N14 MINIs. Lots of poorly built parts like the thermostat, water pump, coolant reservoir, power modules, etc the DI is terrible and causes added maintenance with decoking the intake valves, and has the potential to coke up the exhaust valves"

MINI,38e2sx,Bo-vice,4,Wed Jun 3 16:41:48 2015 UTC,It's for the factory (formerly MINIfini) cup holder on the r50/53.  They gave them away because Americans complained about the small size of the cup holders in the center console.  I never did like it and probably have one laying around somewhere.

If it's swiveled to the left it hits your hand while you shift, and if it's swiveled to the right it smacks into your passenger's knee.   Making a phone holder is a GREAT idea. I definitely want to do that too."
MINI,38e2sx,moquinty,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:10:36 2015 UTC,From some few pictures I've seen its from a cup holder. Cup Holder I'm sure you can get the actual attachment online somewhere.

MINI,38e2sx,MacEnchroe,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"word. Now that I know what im looking for, after searching around for cup holders, I found the other higher mounted one as well.   Cheapest I could find either was $50-60... so I think im just going to design a phone bracket for it instead lol. The cup holder behind the hand brake is more than enough for me."
MINI,38e2sx,ShoeBurglar,2,Wed Jun 3 18:41:06 2015 UTC,"So it's probably a good phone mount but it's a pretty mediocre cupholder - the post it rides on swivels and the whole thing isn't terribly level so driving around with bigger drinks seems like it's always a split second from falling out or rotating and spilling.  Not sure about your phone, but mine fits in the lower two cupholders perfectly. If I ever have to get a new phone, that's the first thing I'll check"

MINI,38dntd,Alisciya,-3,Tue Jun 9 01:25:51 2015 UTC,"I believe r56 = turbo. R55 = non turbo. Just putting that out. About the r56 motor, be sure the timing chain has been done, make sure no leak down on any cylinders (full compression). I would check the engine mounts. And personally, I don't like the clubman, a mini is a mini. Want something bigger? You don't want a mini, imo. Just my take on it. But oh man, you will enjoy the turbo I bet."
MINI,38dntd,hoopladude,3,Wed Jun 3 15:56:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry to be that guy, but this is wrong. R56 is the Cooper Hatchback and can refer to the S or non-S model. R55 indicates the 2008-2014 Cooper Clubman. The difference here is that the 2011-2014 Cooper S (hatch, clubman, coupe, countryman) is equipped with the N18 engine vs. the N14. The N18 has Double VANOS variable valve timing and far fewer (if no) issues with the timing chain. The N18 develops ~180hp vs. the N14's 170. Overall, a better motor."

I'd be more worried about being able to hit the lift points so you don't screw up the under carriage than thousands of pounds moving from an elbow bump

At this point it'd be like Taurus owners waving at each other. It's not really a niche brand at this point, so there's not a lot of reason for us to notice each other."
MINI,387yg4,glasstoaster,2,Tue Jun 2 19:14:18 2015 UTC,here in northern California Minis are one of the most common cars. I don't think the wave will come back here.
MINI,387yg4,MrQuinzel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:14:07 2015 UTC,"In Michigan, where I'm from, minis are uncommon enough for waves to be cool. I'm now in SoCal with my mini for a month and nobody waves. Nobody even notices my mini. I still wave to everyone though."
MINI,387yg4,GemmaNoir,2,Wed Jun 3 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"I always feel bad in those instances where another person goes by too quickly in order for me to properly wave! Or if I don't get my windows down in time, etc."
MINI,38ai11,ChrisHat,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:13:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, temp changes will do it.  I would still check the tire pressure and add air if necessary."
MINI,38ai11,WhoIsPurpleGoo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:01:47 2015 UTC,"They can misread but are generally accurate - you are probably low on pressure but just borderline such that it is above the threshold when tires are warm.   I recently worked on an R56 where the owner ignored the TPMS light for two weeks. She had run over a nail. I found the tire was completely out of air. She had run-flats and didn't notice didn't even notice until I told her... she just said, ""so that's why it's been squirmy lately."" The tread on that tire is now worn about 30% more than the other three tires."
MINI,38ai11,ModMini,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:57:12 2015 UTC,OMG! That is totally not safe nor good for her poor car.   I have had issues with my TPMS and I will tell you that is can be really picky. It is mostly accurate I have found as well though. Just fill up the tire and reset. My car needs to be moving to reset it. :)
MINI,38ai11,Emilyanny4u,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:52:11 2015 UTC,"The tpms has to reset while you few driving, it's how it determines where on the car each wheel is, it has to look at multiple factors including the wheel speed to get an accurate idea of where they are, once it can identify that, on subsequent start ups it essentially remembers an id signal from each of the wheel electronics to know where they are on the car."
MINI,38af4j,moquinty,2,Tue Jun 2 22:53:11 2015 UTC,"If I was in your situation I would look for a non S mini. This saves you some cash up front and overall the engine is more durable because it lacks a turbo. I bought my first 2009 clubman in January 2014 for $11,500, and it had 34K miles on it. I had no issues with it the whole time I owned the car and I put a good 20K miles on it. Last month someone hit me and my poor mini was totaled, I took this opportunity upgraded to a 2009 JCW clubman.  Here to help if you have any other questions http://imgur.com/a/Un2Kp#0"
MINI,38af4j,meyerslevin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:24:13 2015 UTC,Thanks. That actually helps a good amount. I've been looking for just a regular Mini Cooper for a while but never looked into a clubman or anything like that. What is the difference between a clubman and a regular cooper? The pictures don't do too much justice when I look them up.
MINI,38af4j,meyerslevin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"The clubman has doors in the back instead of a hatch and it has a suicide door on the passenger side. Personally I just think it looks better than the regular cooper and has a little more room. There is just enough space in the trunk for my two 12"" subs."
MINI,38af4j,meyerslevin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:00:46 2015 UTC,I would love to see pictures of the subs if you don't mind. Thanks for the help too. I'll keep an eye out on the internet for any clubmans for sale.
MINI,38af4j,meyerslevin,2,Wed Jun 3 01:25:56 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/a/Un2Kp#0  I added a picture of my subs to the end
MINI,38af4j,a10isaussie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:15:25 2015 UTC,Oh nice. How much did those subs cost? I am thinking of putting a speaker system in like that at some point when I get a mini.
MINI,38af4j,a10isaussie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:23:02 2015 UTC,"the whole system cost me around $1300, 4 years ago."
MINI,38af4j,2legit2kwit01,2,Thu Jun 4 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"I bought my Mini for 7400 and it was the best decision I ever made. I recently finished a cross country road trip and I had no problems at all...http://www.reddit.com/r/MINI/comments/37qof1/garden_of_the_gods_in_colorado_springs_my_mini/  I bought mine with 67,000 miles and I made sure it was a non-turbo bc of the major engine issues with my year (07). considering Mini is kind of a money pit if you do have engine issues, I would also definitely advise you to lear how to drive manual bc the car will be cheaper and hopefully easier to fix if you have problems. I learned when I bought my Mini and while it was terrifying at first you'll gett the hang of it quickly. Hope this helps! Good luck"
MINI,38af4j,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:49:08 2015 UTC,"Is there a cost benefit for a manual (does it cost less)? Also what would you suggest, the regular cooper or the convertible cooper? I was looking at both and I love both so I'm not sure what's better. And I saw that post and that is an amazing trip to make. I would love to do that at some point in my life."
MINI,38af4j,ModMini,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:09:26 2015 UTC,"I guess if you're buying used, then it wouldn't really make much of a different, but i think in the future, manual cars are generally cheaper. Maintenance costs will be cheaper when it comes to the engine for manual cars. Plus manual is a lot of fun to drive! I think the convertible coopers look really cool but i do love my base model. I have panoramic sunroofs but thats not really comparable haha. Not sure if one or the other is better, I think its more of an aesthetic thing."
MINI,38af4j,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"Yea if you don't care about performance or aftermarket support, and just want a cool looking car with good gas mileage, go with a Justa.  Nearly every MINI Model's Justa versions are more reliable than the S of the same model group due to the S being forced induction.  Generally, a manual tranny is the preferred choice because they are typically less expensive maintain and specifically with MINIs some year groups had automatic transmission problems.    I will say, that even the early R56 Justas were plagued with some minor issues (intake manifold icing, water pump, oil consumption, intake valve carbon build up, thermostat housing, etc) but nothing like the R56S, same goes for the R53 Justa with minor problems.    Personally, I wouldn't dream of owning a Justa after driving an S or JCW, both of which can be had in your price range.  If you are on the fence, don't even test drive an S, or you will be hooked and will look right past the Justa."
MINI,38af4j,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:56:57 2015 UTC,What is the justa model? Is it just the basic model?
MINI,38af4j,Mumma66,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:52:31 2015 UTC,"it is Justa Cooper :P  You are right, the base model."
MINI,38a0qp,ColourfulChicken,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:22:38 2015 UTC,"The one you linked looks to have a little deeper storage than mine, but total length seems the same. It does cover part of the handbrake, but it doesn't prevent you from actually using it. The grip on the brake will be fully accessible still."
MINI,38a0qp,wildfire359,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:38:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly not worth the money. Mine came with one in the R56 and it is entirely uncomfortable, seems to be about 3 or 4 inches lower than it should be"

MINI,38blj5,clintbyrne,3,Wed Jun 3 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"I have a volcanic orange MINI with racing strips. I have had no issues with cops or meters at all. I am sorry to hear about your tickets.  ModMini is right though, now that you drive a car that stands out you will have to be more careful. Blessing and a curse!"
MINI,38blj5,Emilyanny4u,3,Wed Jun 3 13:43:12 2015 UTC,It probably helps that you don't park illegally.
MINI,38blj5,thezlog,-2,Wed Jun 3 22:35:54 2015 UTC,I may have seen your car around. Good luck on the mean streets 😉
MINI,38blj5,ModMini,5,Wed Jun 3 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"Did you park like an asshole in a boring car, and are now parking like an asshole in a car that maybe attracts more attention? Sorry, obvious humor opportunity :-)"
MINI,38blj5,thezlog,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:57:33 2015 UTC,My friend got over 350 in one bad day in a BMW.   He said he almost packed his bags and moved right then.
MINI,38blj5,WhoIsPurpleGoo,-1,Thu Jun 4 03:45:38 2015 UTC,Honestly no. I always check signs.   As I said these tickets weren't even warranted and now I have to fight them.
MINI,38blj5,TopHatMatt,2,Wed Jun 3 10:53:51 2015 UTC,Good luck. They take pictures of the issues when they write tickets so be prepared to argue against photographic evidence.
MINI,38blj5,TopHatMatt,-2,Wed Jun 3 22:38:01 2015 UTC,Interesting I haven't seen any of them do that here in NYC. I watch them ticket and scurry away like rats or any other scavenger.
MINI,38blj5,thezlog,3,Thu Jun 4 03:43:44 2015 UTC,how is this anyone's fault but yours?  what were the circumstances for each ticket and the boot?  were you legally parked in all situations?
MINI,38blj5,ImThaBean,-6,Wed Jun 3 04:52:58 2015 UTC,Well one was actively picking people up in a no standing (which is legal).   The second was for a bumper protector. She couldn't see my plate but I cut a whole for the plate she never looked and the new parked car behind did actually butt into my car. So she just guessed.   The third was my fault but also shitty gotcha signage. Looked like a meter spot was actually a no parking spot. Payed the meter pulled in when someone pulled out. Checked the sign as it was raining really hard I didn't notice the extra sign. What annoys me about this is they just booted my car. I don't have over 350 in outstanding tickets. They just booted it because they can. So in NYC new rule they can boot you at anytime. I also think this was a scam spot because the ticket was 5 minutes after I walked away. (Oh I only parked there for 10 minutes) So they watched me put money in the meter and then booted me.   So yea there you go.   Fittingly they screwed up every ticket I have a 3 door clubman and they put 2 door or 4 door on the tickets. I hope I can fight them all based on that. But that happened because they were in such a rush they didn't check my car.   In the end if you are a meter maid. Go fuck yourself. Get a real job that does something positive in the community. Instead of being a spineless hated leech that feeds off of actual hard working people.
MINI,38blj5,denko_safe_cats,4,Wed Jun 3 11:09:11 2015 UTC,"Your not gonna win a case against a ticket based on the officer writing 2 door when your car is a 3 door. I suggest you save your time and cash. Parking enforcement is there to enforce the parking rules, don't break the rules and you won't get a ticket. It's not their fault they are writing you a ticket."
MINI,38blj5,radoster95,-3,Wed Jun 3 21:58:23 2015 UTC,I agree about breaking the rules. But I made an honest mistake and putting a boot on changed a 65 dollar ticket into 300. That is shitty and dishonest.
MINI,388is4,Aisren,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:35:52 2015 UTC,R53 does not come with a spare. Just a set of shitty run flats.

MINI,3883re,pulseczarr,2,Tue Jun 2 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"Just had this happen and now it's fixed! For some reason, there is a problem among the early mini's (including the r53) where the actual pump malfunctions. BMW knows this, but instead of a recall, it's under warranty. Go to your nearest MINI dealership to let them check it out.  They might say they need to change this, that, and the other, but stay consistent on only fixing the power steering. It'll be free, should be free. My experience this week was dropping it off last Thursday, and I just got my MINI back yesterday. But that's just dealership mechanics for ya.  Also, the fluid really doesn't change anything, it's suppose to never be changed because there ideally shouldn't be a reason to change it.   It could also be the fan cooling the pump, that's warranty too."
MINI,3883re,MrGypsyMagic,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"Seconding this. Bought a used '04 MCS, power steering went within a week (think seller knew this, which explained them crumbling on price when pushed) and had it fixed by main dealership with only labour to pay, saving myself around £800. Had to make the dealership fully aware I knew that Mini UK knew of the fault, which led to Mini UK and the main Mini dealership dealing with the matter between themselves after a confirmation email from Mini UK."
MINI,3883re,nepasisiht,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:10:43 2015 UTC,Even for the 06 model? I'm going to take mine in for the airbag system recall maybe I'll get them to check that out too
MINI,3883re,MrGypsyMagic,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:30:23 2015 UTC,Yep. I'm pretty sure it goes up to the 07 models
MINI,3883re,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"05-06 were not covered under the power steering pump extended warranty and 07 didn't have a power steering pump, it was electronically assisted only.  To the OP, it is a simple fix, and recommend you change out the weeping lines as well, which are tough to get to.  As far as the new part, I believe they are widely considered of much better build quality from a new manufacture now and not quite as loud."

MINI,387mdz,EasterlyFan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:51:16 2015 UTC,"I live in Rochester, NY, so we also get rough winters. I ran into another MINI owner who had hers for 10 years and it looked great. However, you can't avoid the salt. I don't know anyone who has a car older than 10-15 years here unless it's a summer car and they drive a winter beater. They also tend to be Subarus or Hondas. I'd be ecstatic if I got 10 years out of any car here."
MINI,387mdz,aka_chela,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:19:46 2015 UTC,If you're driving in winters you can always go the undercoating route. I do it but I'm not sure of how well it actually works.
MINI,387mdz,gs89,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:48:18 2015 UTC,"The F56 is a bit too new to determine if there are long running issues. What ever MINI you obtain the trick to longevity is maintenance. While MINI claims that many things are lifetime, in reality they are not. Trans Gear Oil does need to be changed, fuel filters and the like as well. Keeping up with repairs and performing preventative maintenance will keep the MINI running well for years."
MINI,387mdz,MotoringAlliance,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"This may be a foolish question, I really don't know much about cars and how they work. Any recommended guides to Mini maintenance, or just vehicle maintenance in general, to help carry a vehicle through its life. When should you change Trans Gear Oil? What sort of preventative maintenance should I be asking my mechanic for?   I guess the more you read, the more you know. Vehicle maintenance isn't something I know much about, but if I pull the trigger on this Mini like I want to in the next 12 months, than its something I want to be versed in."
MINI,387mdz,Haybuck_Pony,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"I live in Boston, MA. Winters are hellish. Honestly, the best way to really deal with the salt and sand is to keep the undercarriage of the car washed regularly. Semi-warm, clear day in winter? Car wash. Beginning of spring? Car wash. It may seem frivolous, but it keeps the sand from building up and eating through the underbody."
MINI,387mdz,Haybuck_Pony,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"Which is fine, I don't mind running through the car wash. Anything preventative that someone can do to do before the salt arrives, to help out between driving and washing? Or is that overkill / unnecessary?"

So far it's a 3D printed spacer to make it more snug. So if anyone is thinking this is a great idea but can't get a 2nd badge holder to stay put, perhaps we can work with it.   It's possible to print a badge holder, but it wouldn't be magnetic, you'd basically have to glue the badge on or use a sticker. I'm in no way an engineer or 3D modeler, so it doesn't exist yet.

MINI,385wp7,RottingLegion,2,Tue Jun 2 02:03:12 2015 UTC,"Probably a new block and new head, or if you can find one that got totaled from a collision to the rear of the vehicle would be ideal. Prices are going to vary based on where you buy it from, and the quality of the re-manufactured engine as I doubt they're still made as new parts these days."
MINI,385wp7,Mumma66,2,Tue Jun 2 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, finding a totaled MINI is going to be the best option really. Not only will it be cheaper than buying a new block and head, but it'll have plenty of other parts to choose from and go all Dr. Frankenstein with."
MINI,385wp7,Fozee,2,Tue Jun 2 11:23:26 2015 UTC,About $5k. NOT including labor to remove and replace motor.   If you think you want to add power in the future. Call Jan!   I put about $7k into getting mine back on the road.   How do you know you threw a rod? These motors will take a pretty serious beating. I've been in a car that's been spun to 9k on the stock bottom end.

MINI,385wp7,zed0K,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:03:26 2015 UTC,Some Mini cooper zombie outbreak page i was looking at.  Here is his listing on CL  http://austin.craigslist.org/pts/5052801156.html
MINI,385wp7,ModMini,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"Price seems high for one with that many miles. Check eBay as well, but be careful that you get the correct engine. A lot of them are R50/W10 non-supercharged. They are NOT interchangeable. (crank is cast, not forged, and they do not have oil passages for the under-piston oil cooler spray nozzles)"
MINI,385wp7,zed0K,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"Could it be that expensive because of the transmission being included? How much would one be for without the transmission, reasonably."
MINI,385wp7,ModMini,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yes perhaps, I didn't notice that it includes a transmission. Maybe negotiate the engine only, the Getrag 6 speed is pretty much bulletproof unless you break an axle and punch a hole in the casing.   I really couldn't say but my guess is most of the worth for a high mileage engine like that is in the rebuild value, maybe $1200 or so?  Check the eBay market prices and go from there? I seem to remember complete long blocks under 100K miles being sold for less than $2000 shipped."
MINI,385wp7,ModMini,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:43:24 2015 UTC,"Depending on condition, you may be able to reuse the old head.  Here's a video series I made of the same failure.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up8nNNnY3ZU <--Part 1, you can find the other two parts once you get on the video page  You don't need to find a totaled MINI, just check out the local and online auto recyclers for a used engine or short block. In the video I install a new short block, cost is around $2500 for the block plus whatever else you end up changing. Some junkyard engines will cost more than this, most that cost less will have high miles. With a new short block and valve stem seals, you basically have a completely new engine, the head lasts a good long time."

MINI,383i08,Fozee,5,Mon Jun 1 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"In signing/depositing the check they give you, there will most likely be a waiver of rights to sue their asses in the future or to demand a higher amount. So be absolutely sure you are okay with that amount before you sign or deposit the check. Because when you call an attorney in a few weeks to find out how to sue them for more bc you realized it actually cost you more than you originally thought, you will be SOL."

MINI,383i08,RooneyEatsIt,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:04:44 2015 UTC,MINI Roadside isn't actually through MINI. It's through Allstate Insurance. Their Roadside hires local companies to go out and help the customer. Similar to how AAA does it.

MINI,3865aa,ABCGum13,2,Tue Jun 2 03:09:26 2015 UTC,"first decide what it is you want from the car, from my experience (owned 4 MINI's so far) The R53 (02-06) is very rough and ready, supercharged so sounds excellent but is a bit juicy on fuel, around 25mpg. The R56 (2007-13) is a bit more tame, more comfortable to drive, turbo so just as fast but just feels more like a golf and less like a Mini in my own opinion. When it comes to reliability I'd avoid any of the early years of the generations, MINI aren't too great on picking up things so it takes them a while to fix it. Do your research and test drive some, only then will you know. I've personally owned an R53, loved it to bits but wanted an R56 for the better fuel consumption, got the R56 and found it slightly boring and the repairs on the pre 2011 models can be quite shocking for a car you'd expect to be quality as its ""bmw made"" recently sold it to buy a R53 JCW, hope this helps."
MINI,3865aa,jakec589,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:24:45 2015 UTC,Wow. Thank you. I don't even know what an R53 or R56 is! I really need to do my homework!! I will look into them both. I really appreciate your input. I will be sure to post my final decision once I decide on the car. Thanks again!

MINI,383i7q,mini-actualsize,2,Mon Jun 1 17:04:13 2015 UTC,"It used to be that when you hovered over the flair, it switched to JCW (and the color). I don't know if they still do that, but I always liked that for its subtlety."
MINI,383i7q,Pequa94,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"I would really love specific flairs for the JCW. It used to be a mod, but now it's a separate model from the S, and I think it is time for a flair specifically for it."
MINI,383i7q,mini-actualsize,2,Mon Jun 1 22:11:35 2015 UTC,"No, that's a very good point. Maybe keep the R52/R53 JCW's as hover and switch all the other ones to a separate flair, similar to the R53/R56 GP's..."
MINI,383i7q,Pequa94,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, that sounds great! Your idea sounds perfect, now all we need is somebody too make some more flairs!"

MINI,383i7q,MrDerk,2,Tue Jun 2 11:30:26 2015 UTC,"There are JCW flairs, but I add them manually. They reveal themselves on mouse over. There are too many color/model combinations to have ready-made flair for everyone so I do a lot by hand. Maybe it's time to add uncolored JCW versions to the pre-made list.   If you're really that concerned about your flair saying JCW without mousing over, I can make that work for you."
MINI,383i7q,mini-actualsize,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:33:15 2015 UTC,"No, I don't even have a MINI, but just for some others that have them. An uncolored JCW added to the pre-made list would be nice for others that have a JCW."

MINI,384bq7,Alisciya,2,Mon Jun 1 19:30:48 2015 UTC,Well this is good and bad news. I know you originally said the storm cooper was going to be totaled so that is good news.   The bad is that it will most likely cost you a lot more at the dealer but they tend to stand by their work more than a private shop would.   I wish you luck!
MINI,384bq7,Emilyanny4u,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:16:27 2015 UTC,A dealer will charge you at least twice the insurance estimate.

MINI,37y20x,cameheretosaythis213,2,Sun May 31 10:35:29 2015 UTC,My seats are unable to recline or let passengers in and out of the back. After some research this is apparently common as the cables snap or the moving mechanism seizes up. Make sure you test the seats for all movements first. Otherwise it's just hassle to take the seat out to replace the cable. (I'm lazy)  I think the stats might be wrong as the facelift model from June 2004 onwards has more bhp and a quicker 0-60mph.    As far as I'm aware the stats are: Cooper S pre-facelift - 163bhp with 0-60 in 7.2 secs Cooper S facelift - 170bhp with 0-60 in 7 secs    I have the '04 facelift model and I am LOVING it.
MINI,37y20x,dannntastic,1 point,Sun May 31 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I had heard of that cable going actually. Will definitely check it.   After some more research, it looks like the stats on auto trader are wrong. Anything around 04 MCS is listed with 9.2s 0-60 which is obviously wrong."
MINI,37y20x,Itachi431,1 point,Sun May 31 17:27:53 2015 UTC,"I've own the exact car for a couple of months. Haven't had a problem out of it yet. My first upgrade was ditching the factory run flat tires, the ride was very hard. But after I switched the ride was noticeable smoother."

MINI,37y20x,dannntastic,1 point,Sun May 31 15:45:12 2015 UTC,Did you ditch them for other run flats or have you gone for standard tyres?
MINI,37y20x,fwl4ever,1 point,Sun May 31 16:13:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems like a good idea. Would be a bit nervous about the lack of spare, but that's what breakdown cover is for I guess!   I've got run flats on my current car (BMW) and it makes the ride awful."
MINI,37y20x,Dubaidrives,1 point,Sun May 31 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"I HATE runflats. I switched to regulars on my Clubman quickly, and popped a donut in the back (fortunately it fits in mine) even if I have to rotate tires in case of a front flat."
MINI,37y20x,Dubaidrives,1 point,Sun May 31 23:36:31 2015 UTC,Also look out for the electric window motors going and airbag warning lights  coming on (mainly due to loose connections to the seat bags underneath seats) Buying a plug-in reset tool from Ebay will save the cost of continual visits to a local Mini dealer which will charge 50-100 pounds per reset!
MINI,37y20x,Itachi431,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:07:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Is there a tool that specifically can reset airbag faults? I've found in the past they are often hard to reset at home.   I've got an OBDII reader and the BMWhat app on my phone (3 series owner currently) so will check if that does Mini too  Was actually toying with the idea of changing the seats and was researching the wiring under the seats. Looks like a fairly straight forward mod. I just really don't like the look of the rear seats in an R53 at all, newer models are much nicer."
MINI,37xr5v,radoster95,2,Sun May 31 07:36:38 2015 UTC,"Can you afford to fix the MINI? first of all I'd get quotes and investigate the price it might cost, secondly, would you P/X it for a new cooper and be financially stable? do you want a new cooper?   do what makes you happy and what is right for you money wise, then you can't go wrong."
MINI,37xr5v,jakec589,1 point,Sun May 31 11:57:39 2015 UTC,"Either are financially viable, I just don't know if a nightfire red cooper is something that I should let go of"

MINI,37xr5v,gs89,1 point,Sun May 31 14:13:47 2015 UTC,"maybe it is worth a little more but you will spend all that getting the chain replaced or what ever it needs, I recently sold my R56 for a late R53 JCW because of my timing chain on the R56, I knew it was going to go and the stress of it just wasn't worth it anymore."
MINI,37xr5v,gs89,2,Sun May 31 14:17:37 2015 UTC,"How often do you CHECK/TOP-UP the oil, and have you had the timing chain tensioner replaced?"
MINI,37xr5v,gs89,1 point,Sun May 31 14:04:09 2015 UTC,I top it off every 1000 miles about. And change it every 5000. And as far as I know the tensioner was never replaced
MINI,37xr5v,2legit2kwit01,2,Sun May 31 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"It would be a good start to have the tensioner replaced before making any big decisions. It's only a couple hundred dollars and I would highly suggest doing it as preventative maintenance. I had a very bad rattle but with the tensioner replacement and oil checks it's been fixed up.  The oil check was because the timing chains will chatter more when the engine is low on oil, and the Mini's have a tendency to consume oil - you're doing the right thing by checking levels regularly."
MINI,37xr5v,gs89,1 point,Sun May 31 14:37:14 2015 UTC,I'll look into the tensioner replacement then and give it a little. The rattle just worries the hell out of me. Thanks for the help!
MINI,37xr5v,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Sun May 31 14:45:03 2015 UTC,It's always on the back of my mind too. I couldn't fault you for getting rid of the car because of it either; it's a huge design flaw that BMW is failing to take ownership of.
MINI,37xr5v,MonkeyDog453,1 point,Sun May 31 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"where do you live that a tensioner only costs a couple hundred dollars, because I needed to go there.  The best I saw was 1200 here at an independent shop not using OEM parts.  This was for the whole tensioner assembly (one you hear the rattle, you need it all replaced)."
MINI,37xr5v,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Sun May 31 15:17:54 2015 UTC,Just the tensioner with an updated (supposedly) part. It really helped with the rattling.
MINI,37xr5v,Ziffaro,2,Mon Jun 1 00:59:34 2015 UTC,"Tbh this sounds kinda shady, and hopefully you are disclosing this info to potential buyers/dealership.    Selling a rare color MINI doesn't usually command a higher price, but ensures it sells quicker.  Most Spice orange MINIs don't last a week on forums!"
MINI,37xr5v,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Sun May 31 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"When I was looking around at used Minis a year or so ago, a lot of people were trying to sell them with obvious timing chain rattle.  The first 4 Minis I went to look at all had chain rattle.  They must hope that the people wanting to buy their car know nothing about them.  None of them told about it beforehand and acted like they didn't know what I was talking about when asked about it."
MINI,37xr5v,Ziffaro,1 point,Sun May 31 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be shady or anything, I just don't want to look back and regret getting rid of my car.   Edit: I didn't realise you meant selling my car with the timing chain issue. I wouldn't feel right selling my car without telling the buyer, my first car had undisclosed issues and I wouldn't want to put someone else through the same thing."
MINI,37xr5v,Ziffaro,2,Sun May 31 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"Well as u/MonkeyDog453 mentioned, when I was selling my R56JCW a few months back, I had priced the car higher than most others and wouldn't budge, namely, because all the crappy R56isms just happened on my watch (timing chain tensioner, water pump, thermostat, expansion tank cracking, driver side module failure, labor decoking, etc)  and they were getting, in all effects, a new MINI, vs the others out there not talking about any maintenance done.  Of course, I also told every potential buy that most of these issues will appear again because of faulty designs that were never addressed.  One person insisted that I was crazy for asking for so much for my car and passed purchasing a different N14 JCW.  Not a month after purchasing it, he noticed his timing chain tensioner rattle real bad and most likely had been doing it the whole time (when it first happens it is very sporadic).  Now 2 months after buying it, his thermostat is leaking and water pump failed.  On the other hand, the guy who bought my JCW has had no problems, but fully understands in another 60K, the time bomb will start ticking again."

I do fully agree with the lawyer. Those towing companies have lost nearly (or over, depending on options) $30,000 of OP's property. That is a major, major thing. If it's true negligence, it's possible that you could charge them with felony theft."
MINI,37uo3u,Fozee,3,Sat May 30 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"I know this doesn't help right now since you don't have your car, but there is a sort of common problem with Subaru's where they won't take gas at the pump either and the only way to get a full tank is to fill it very slowly.  It is related to a clogged fuel vent line.  The vent line runs to a charcoal canister and if the canister fails somehow, it can clog the line with charcoal.  Since there is no way for air to escape when pumping fuel, the fuel comes back out the filler neck, or continuously shuts off the pump.  When you finally get your towing debacle figured out and get the Mini back, maybe you can look into that."
MINI,37uo3u,Ruiner46,5,Sat May 30 20:04:25 2015 UTC,I would be tweeting the hell out of this...go viral

Lots of major companies use Twitter to have a more ""personal presence"" with their current and future customer base.   It's a great tool for the consumer as well as situations exactly like this can either show customers what the company is made of OR what company to avoid in a future purchase.   I'm very interested in what's going on with the fuel situation. My 2011 now balks at every fill up. I practically have to trickle it in when filling up.   Holding the nozzle almost all the way out of the fill tube AND twisting it almost upside down allows me to pull the pump trigger halfway at least. Dealer finds no issue with it (strange enough)...."

MINI,37qgi1,UCto9,3,Fri May 29 16:09:57 2015 UTC,"From the ad and the description, it looks like a good one. Claiming dealer serviced is great but insist on seeing actual printouts of the work done. It also has some safe and proven upgrades to sweeten the pot. Miles are low for the year. There is only one true way to find out the truth though; go out and test drive it. Read through this article http://www.motoringfile.com/mini-r50r53-buyers-guide/ that you can also find on the sidebar of this subreddit. I, myself, went the safer route and bought a 2005 MCS a few months ago and still had a good bit of work to get the car 100%. The dealer quoted $4,000 in repairs that needed to be done on my car, but I was able to do myself for $400 in parts. DIY guides are plentiful for this car and are pretty straightforward. A pre-purchase inspection is always worth the investment so you don't buy the car blindly especially since this is your first MINI. The price seems to be right as-well. I felt like I got a steal with mine by talking the guy down from $7,800 to $6,300. I am by no means an expert on these matters, but I hope my input as a new MINI owner will be helpful for you and good luck!"

Lift the plastic tab to be able to disconnect the coil pack Grab plastic connector (not wires) and pull to disconnect. May take a little wiggle.  Grab the plastic tab and gently lift coil pack (may take a little working back and forth to get it out) There she is! Remove with desired implement of destruction.

MINI,37mglk,hotrods1970,2,Thu May 28 20:15:39 2015 UTC,Yeah just edited my comment above. It is supposed to be a voice command button. And it will control your phone through voice command but I believe you have to have the connected feature.

MINI,37mglk,Firehed,1 point,Fri May 29 00:01:36 2015 UTC,"It should work if your phone is connected by Bluetooth. If it's not, it's probably some sort of software issue. You do not need a wired connection, nor the full Connected package. BT is enough.   That's said, it's basically garbage compared to the voice commands built into any modern smartphone, and can't trigger the native one (Siri, etc). At least it can't on my '10 R56 - I'd actually be thrilled to have a Siri button built in my steering wheel."

MINI,37ner1,Menism,2,Thu May 28 22:32:34 2015 UTC,"Unless there is a new vendor or system, the aftermarket systems are largely the same, a sort of short ram of sorts.  Basically in some sort a larger cone filter is added and the rear portion cowl lining is removed to be able to obtain air flowing into the cowl just below the windshield on the drivers side, it also serves to purpose of sounding badass.  Any other setup would prove to be tough because of how the engine is mounted and where the airbox is located, there is little to no chance water will hydro lock it."

MINI,37ner1,Je11yMonster,1 point,Fri May 29 01:12:34 2015 UTC,Wouldn't a ram also be a cai?
MINI,37ner1,Audiontoxication,1 point,Thu May 28 22:56:15 2015 UTC,Sri sits above the engine bay and removes sound buffers and distance air needs to travel to engine. But air is warmer so its less dense than cai   Cai will pull air from outside the car making it colder air and thus more dense but air travels farther and you risk hydrolock if water gets pulled into the filter
MINI,37lw3r,fletcherburger,1 point,Thu May 28 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"The water pump is driven by the Supercharge. There is a take off on the right side that runs the pump.   Why do you say the SC is bad? Is it still spinning. What makes you think there is a problem?  Even in winter without the water pump running you will overheat the car, so I doubt it is not spinning the water pump."
MINI,37lw3r,MotoringAlliance,1 point,Thu May 28 16:28:12 2015 UTC,It's not spinning. I haven't heard that beautiful whine in a long time
MINI,37lw3r,MotoringAlliance,1 point,Thu May 28 17:17:53 2015 UTC,I'd look someplace else for the missing sound. If the SC is not spinning at all then the water pump will not spin. The belt spins the SC. The gear on the back that runs the water pump is driven off the same shaft that the SC pulley spins.
MINI,37lw3r,Audiontoxication,1 point,Thu May 28 18:33:40 2015 UTC,Can the supercharger be spinning but not produce any boost? Along with the sound disappearing there was also the obvious lack of power that came with it

As far as your other questions as to the difference, there is a lot, notably more HP on the MCS due to it having a supercharger and yours being naturally aspirated.

MINI,37k1i3,ThiefofNobility,2,Thu May 28 12:42:24 2015 UTC,Run flats are a type of tire. You can drive 50 miles on them safely even in flat. They are worth their safety. Only downside is they ride much harder and  are very expensive to replace.
MINI,37k1i3,2legit2kwit01,2,Thu May 28 13:03:58 2015 UTC,"No I think auto correct f****d me.  A run flat is a tire that you can drive a short distance on a flat tire, not the best for corning."
MINI,37k1i3,Audiontoxication,2,Thu May 28 13:12:31 2015 UTC,On the 1st generation is was about 50hp difference between Cooper and S. I forget what all the sport package included over the stock. I would figure the 2nd Gen would be similar.

MINI,37k1i3,MrDerk,2,Thu May 28 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"The sport package is purely aesthetics: wheels, stripes, interior, probably xenon headlights.   2007 is still the first gen convertible, so the S model is supercharged and gets you an extra 50hp or so over the base model.   I'm pretty sure you can get an S model with the sport package, actually. I don't believe they were mutually exclusive."

MINI,37i2bg,Lexjiggler,1 point,Wed May 27 20:54:14 2015 UTC,you can bet your bottom that it most likely is.   and it can be pretty costly.   messed with the circuit in the pyrotechnic belt tensioner most likely. (in the event of an accident the belt buckle receptacle actually blows down and cinches the belt buckle tight. )   If the electrical signal on that circuit changed (even temporarily) it can trigger a hard fault in the airbag module and even disable that circuit.  (will think the circuit is faulty or already deployed and in the event of an accident it will not deploy... possibly...)
MINI,37i2bg,ransom40,1 point,Wed May 27 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"parts are not as bad for your R56 LCI though.   http://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/showparts?id=SV33-USA-06-2011-R56N-Mini-Cooper_S&diagId=72_0577  $122 for the belt tensioner (which means the dealer will probably charge you $200 for it for some stupid reason)    doing a fault check on the airbag module (guess would be in the $100 range) and then some fee to clear the code after it has been fixed + an hour labor or so to replace that belt buckle.    Guessing ~$500 trip, but could be more, could be less.

MINI,37hp08,_Gizmo_,1 point,Wed May 27 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"The announcement was a few weeks ago, it seemed like there were several things updated immediately, probably including the fog lights.   It would be a very, very odd coincidence that they would have forgotten the option and then used this information from corporate as an excuse. Plus, even if they forgot an option, they can still install it at the dealership (which has been done hundreds of times in the past)."
MINI,37hp08,_Gizmo_,1 point,Wed May 27 21:38:45 2015 UTC,When I talked to them on the phone they told me there was no way they could install it at the dealership.
MINI,37hp08,McFeely_Smackup,2,Wed May 27 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"I know they can't install these, in the past that is how things were handled for items that were forgotten. So even if he was BSing you they would still be able to figure something out, I was just showing how he isn't BSing you."

MINI,37hp08,vkash1208,1 point,Wed May 27 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"For headlining ""Major Surprises"" that's a list of some very minor changes."
MINI,37hp08,andk1987,1 point,Wed May 27 21:47:19 2015 UTC,MotoringFile has been pretty anticlimactic for a while so they have to draw you into their articles when they can...
MINI,37hp08,andk1987,1 point,Wed May 27 21:58:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on your dealership. All dealers have a certain number of cars allocated for each build series. If they don't have any 2015 builds available, they will put your car into a 2016. 2016 won't have rear fog lights, secret glove box, and the small wings logos on the sides of the front seats. Also if you intend on getting navigation, in 2016 nav will come only on Visual Boost XL and won't be an add on for the smaller screen."
MINI,37hp08,McFeely_Smackup,1 point,Wed May 27 22:46:08 2015 UTC,you cant have rear fog lights on a usa spec mini anymore......
MINI,37hp08,_Gizmo_,2,Wed May 27 18:59:57 2015 UTC,So does it just have a blank button there? The only reason I wanted it was to eliminate the blank.
MINI,37hp08,DriftwoodBadger,1 point,Wed May 27 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"not a clue m8, i read about fog lights not being available in the us on apost here, theyre legally require over here in the UK sooo....."
MINI,37hp08,RooneyEatsIt,1 point,Wed May 27 20:37:18 2015 UTC,"sounds like a mandatory ""ejector seat"" button to me."
MINI,37hp08,RooneyEatsIt,1 point,Wed May 27 21:16:37 2015 UTC,"It will be a blank spot, no switch."
MINI,37hp08,Dilusions,1 point,Wed May 27 21:36:15 2015 UTC,That would drive me up the wall. I also ordered the rear fog light in mine (2013) just so I wouldn't have a blank spot on the switch panel. Could not deal.
MINI,37hp08,GhostalMedia,1 point,Thu May 28 01:57:52 2015 UTC,"You could always buy the switch pack separately.  It won't work, but will fill the spot."

MINI,37gjfs,OddS0cks,2,Wed May 27 15:47:49 2015 UTC,"That is about where I'm at! Have a shotgun I can borrow? Apparently, you don't get one in Texas until you are a landowner."
MINI,37gjfs,smokeysevin,2,Wed May 27 16:22:17 2015 UTC,"I live in Texas too, shotgun is mandatory for all citizens"
MINI,37gjfs,jiffener,2,Wed May 27 18:10:21 2015 UTC,Did you get yours at birth? I think I've been lied to my entire life.
MINI,37gjfs,RooneyEatsIt,3,Wed May 27 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"Gut the carpets, unplug all electrical harness connections, spray them with wire dryer, leave them out for a day or so. Remove the seats and any sound deadner or other pannels and just leave them out until dry. Once a week more than you think is necessary has passed you can reassemble. As for the carpets and other fabric or foam, use a wet/dry vac to remove most of the contaminated water, then shampoo the shit out of it. The 3 days after flooding are the most crucial. Act fast of you want to have any success."
MINI,37gjfs,GhostalMedia,2,Thu May 28 02:22:26 2015 UTC,Insurance called. Statement made. 3-5 day wait time for adjuster since nearly everybody in Houston had damage because of this craziness. So very sad to see the Storm Cooper get taken down by a thunderstorm.
MINI,37gikj,Warmdelights,14,Wed May 27 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"Check if it has stripes, If it doesn't you don't want it."

MINI,37gikj,adamfps,6,Wed May 27 19:02:49 2015 UTC,Watch my video on some stuff to look for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUhzyfb3cxg
MINI,37gikj,ModMini,3,Wed May 27 19:01:36 2015 UTC,"Check strut towers for mushrooming, check the exhaust and exhaust hangers for rust, power steering pump, check welds on the catalytic converter if you can, and keep an ear out for a bad throw out bearing."
MINI,37gikj,MoreHeartThanScars,2,Wed May 27 14:36:20 2015 UTC,"Make sure you bring a flash light and really look over the car, don't just open the hood, stare at the engine, and close it.   For the exhaust, look under mainly the rear of the car. Here's a pic of a rusted exhaust. The muffler is to the left and the resonator is to the right, look for signs of it really rusting and possible rusting through soon. Each one is being held up by a metal band that wraps around it, see if that has broken, and then there are exhaust hangers - those are connected to the straps and they are what hold the exhaust up on bushings. They the welds or those and condition of the bushings.   Start the car, while the engine is running and gear in neutral, push in the clutch and quickly release it. Do you hear a knocking kind of sound? That's the throwout bearing in the clutch. When you replace the clutch you can replace that at the same time. I've driven my car 70,000 miles with the throwout bearing like that...so it's not something that will damage the care per sae but you can use it for negotiation."
MINI,37gikj,_Gizmo_,1 point,Wed May 27 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"That is when a lot of vital parts are needing replacing. Ask what had been replaced and if it is a six speed it may have gear clatter, which is harmless but expensive to remedy so I just deal with mine  . When you push clutch it it goes away so you will know it is not a deadly knock. Good luck and I hope you get it, great cars."
MINI,37gikj,Jamesaki,1 point,Wed May 27 14:14:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you, it is a 6 speed manual so I will definitely check that out"
MINI,37gikj,Emilyanny4u,1 point,Wed May 27 14:36:10 2015 UTC,I read this as a 2015 MCS. I was like holy cats that is  a lot of miles!
MINI,37gikj,ModMini,2,Wed May 27 15:23:59 2015 UTC,There are tons of 1st gen MINI with easily double this many miles still going strong.
MINI,37gikj,accountnumber3,1 point,Wed May 27 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"I test drove one the other day, but I wasn't serious about buying it because of the quality. I had so much fun driving it I didn't get to pay attention to anything other than the road.  The dealer was really pushy so I just wanted to get away. I wish I had asked for a few minutes to look it over."
MINI,37gikj,Broseidons_Brocean,0,Wed May 27 15:59:31 2015 UTC,"Not to seem rude, but there's literally a buyer's guide in the side bar."
MINI,37gikj,hoopladude,4,Wed May 27 15:41:43 2015 UTC,I did actually read the buyer’s guide – the guide doesn’t really account for how many miles are on the vehicle. Most of all I am just looking for as much information as I can get
MINI,37gikj,haidenVUE92,-7,Wed May 27 16:01:08 2015 UTC,Get an r56 instead
MINI,37fa5v,Rahoolwho,17,Wed May 27 05:05:18 2015 UTC,"check the oil, check the oil, check the oil and when you think you are safe, check the oil"
MINI,37fa5v,jakec589,4,Wed May 27 09:14:05 2015 UTC,Definitely take this advice.  I always have backup quarts to top off my S when its getting low on oil.
MINI,37fa5v,SnotRokit3,1 point,Wed May 27 12:22:25 2015 UTC,What brand of oil do you use?? (US here) and are there any particular gas stations you recommend?
MINI,37fa5v,SnotRokit3,2,Wed May 27 15:14:45 2015 UTC,"I usually just buy quarts from the dealership.  Full synthetic 5W-30 is what MINI recommends. I'm sure someone else here could give you specific brands.    I only get gas from Chevron (high octane, duh).  I was using 76 and Shell more, but I was steered away from those by a motoring advisor years ago. Something about the what they add to the gas at Chevron that helps keep gunk from building up.  Again, I'm not sure how much weight it holds, but it works for me."
MINI,37fa5v,KarmaticEvolution,1 point,Wed May 27 16:32:20 2015 UTC,"Mini recently switched to Shell from Castrol, just an FYI since many independent shops may still be using Castrol.  Does it make any real difference to mix brands of the same weight (though I know weight can differ between manufacturers)?"
MINI,37fa5v,bratling,2,Wed May 27 21:00:06 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter. Just use a full synthetic of the specified weight for your engine. 5W-30 is commonest.  I like Mobile 1. Your mileage may vary.
MINI,37fa5v,vatothe0,2,Thu May 28 00:07:54 2015 UTC,"Okay cool, thank you! I'm new to cars in general, not just minis. But I have plenty of mechanic friends to help me out, I'll be taking it to a mini dealer very soon for an initial diagnostic"
MINI,37fa5v,bratling,2,Thu May 28 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"To this point, I now have a reminder set on my phone to check the oil every 30 days which is about 750 miles for me."
MINI,37fa5v,EvasiveLolis,2,Wed May 27 13:37:03 2015 UTC,"I also recommend checking the oil. Be sure to check the oil. And also, check the oil."
MINI,37fa5v,PaperMelodies,4,Thu May 28 00:06:19 2015 UTC,"Keep up with routine maintenance, especially with all of the liquids. Try to only run top tier gas. When youre done driving for the day, let it run for a few minutes before turning it off. Other than that, its an incredibly fun car. Theres just a lot of responsibility involved with owning one with all the maintenance you have to stay on top of. Congrats on your mini tho! And welcome to the mini community!"
MINI,37fa5v,MCPE_Master_Builder,2,Wed May 27 10:17:45 2015 UTC,"Not to be a complete shameless hijacker! :P Just purchased an R56 Cooper D. For myself and any future readers, is any of this advice irrelevant to the D or specific to petrols or the Cooper S?"
MINI,37fa5v,HutchOne23,1 point,Thu May 28 08:26:17 2015 UTC,Why should you leave it running for a few minutes?
MINI,37fa5v,bratling,1 point,Wed May 27 20:12:48 2015 UTC,It will prevent hot oil from settling in the bearings in turbo. You can also stay out of boost for the last little bit of your drive.
MINI,37fa5v,urbanadultblunt,1 point,Wed May 27 23:53:35 2015 UTC,"This is not required in a MINI. The oil pump is electric, not mechanical, and will continue running after the engine stops until the oil cools down."
MINI,37fa5v,redparchel,1 point,Thu May 28 00:09:25 2015 UTC,That make sense for why it always takes a little for the engine to stop making noise once I turn mine off
MINI,37fa5v,EvasiveLolis,1 point,Thu May 28 04:07:07 2015 UTC,"I'm 95% certain the oil pump on both R56 S motors use a mechanical oil pump (my Bently manual is packed while moving so I can't triple check) but ECS Tuning and realOEM list oil pump chains and crankshaft gears for the oil pump so I'll cite that.   The idea is to keep oil circulating while the motor cools, the turbo gets REALLY hot and having oil sit in it will cause the oil to burn in the small spaces (turbo oil lines, bearings, etc..) and cause flow issues later which is bad.   OP check out JM Turbo Coopers youtube videos on ""how to kill a new turbo quickly"" (I'll admit they're a bit dry but full of great info) Arric really does know his stuff (full disclosure: I am a happy customer of theirs)   but with all that, check your oil, and change your oil more often than mini recommends (every 6k seems to be a better number), check your oil, oh and check your oil again."
MINI,37fa5v,KarmaticEvolution,0,Sat May 30 02:09:55 2015 UTC,Something to do with letting the turbo cool down a bit before shutting down the engine.
MINI,37fa5v,MCPE_Master_Builder,3,Wed May 27 20:25:30 2015 UTC,Definitely have heard this but our Mini's come with a electric water pump that turns itself on if its running too hot after it has turned-off.  Your suggestion is preventative though so I guess it doesn't hurt might as well...
MINI,37fa5v,Emilyanny4u,1 point,Wed May 27 21:01:30 2015 UTC,Huh. Interesting! Thanks for the tip
MINI,37fa5v,MCPE_Master_Builder,3,Wed May 27 20:42:36 2015 UTC,Drive it like you stole it every damn day!
MINI,37fa5v,Emilyanny4u,5,Wed May 27 13:04:22 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be literal, but if you stole a car, wouldn't you want to drive safely and lawfully? Don't want to draw attention to yourself"
MINI,37fa5v,Fthboskklvt,2,Wed May 27 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"hahaha, good point."

MINI,37ca3z,_axaxaxax,7,Tue May 26 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're serious, but all MINIs with the HID headlamps do this. It's just washer fluid, and it happens automatically when you wash your windshield."
MINI,37ca3z,DriftwoodBadger,8,Tue May 26 16:39:05 2015 UTC,Mine only seems to do this if the headlights are on.
MINI,37ca3z,DriftwoodBadger,2,Tue May 26 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"That might be true. In mine the headlights are always on, because they're the daytime running lights. I literally cannot turn them off even if I want to."
MINI,37ca3z,DriftwoodBadger,3,Tue May 26 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"My daytime running lights are on all the time too, but they are the little round lights below the headlights"
MINI,37ca3z,ModMini,0,Tue May 26 17:25:06 2015 UTC,"Those are on too, on mine.  I've heard them called ""angel eyes"", they're on all the time, as are my headlights. I have a 2013 model year. Even if I turn the headlight control to OFF, they still stay on."
MINI,37ca3z,ghettobacon,2,Tue May 26 17:31:28 2015 UTC,Angel eyes refers to the LED halo around the headlight which was started on BMWs.
MINI,37ca3z,mr_mooses,0,Wed May 27 06:15:02 2015 UTC,"put the car on park and pull the ebrake, see if they go off.  If they do, you COULD barely pull up the ebrake so the cable isnt really being pulled but the car sensor thinks it is.  I wouldnt advise this because I mean the only use for this is really if youre stalking somebody outside of their house and you dont want them to see you lmao"
MINI,37ca3z,_axaxaxax,1 point,Wed May 27 04:51:35 2015 UTC,Yes you can.  It's either in the center speedo or the tach settings.  Think center speedo.   Along with how many blinks for the turn signals

MINI,37ca3z,ShoeBurglar,2,Tue May 26 16:45:56 2015 UTC,Very third or fifth actuation of the windshield wipers when headlights are on. (Can't remember if it's 3 or 5)
MINI,37ca3z,mr_mooses,2,Wed May 27 06:14:32 2015 UTC,"Its a weird formula for when they come on. I've determined it to just work out to ""sometimes"". Every x actuations or y minutes or z miles or a combination of them."
MINI,37ca3z,Jamesaki,1 point,Wed May 27 12:09:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  First friend sees it and makes a fuss,  and then you spend 15 minutes wasting fluid and they never go again.."
MINI,37ca3z,skepticalDragon,3,Mon Jun 1 00:50:27 2015 UTC,Yeah it freaked me out when I did this going down the highway and seen the mist going over the front of my car.
MINI,37ca3z,ChrisHat,3,Tue May 26 17:50:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought it was coming from under the hood and it freaked me out.
MINI,37ca3z,GhostalMedia,2,Tue May 26 18:49:25 2015 UTC,I just got a 2013 hardtop and this is one of the coolest features.
MINI,37ca3z,tattooed_balloon,2,Tue May 26 20:35:05 2015 UTC,I always wondered what those little cutaways were for. They're not available on the new F series. You have a relic from a better time.
MINI,37ca3z,vatoniolo,2,Tue May 26 21:56:49 2015 UTC,"I have those cutaways too, 2011 JCW.   It seems there's an open tube at the back of the unit, so not connected. Does it just work on water pressure, or is there a separate actuator (and fuse etc) in there too?  Manual says the reservoir is 2.6 liter, or 4.5 liters with the headlamp washer.

MINI,37ca3z,Brickx3,2,Wed May 27 12:57:33 2015 UTC,Took me almost a year to figure this out. I noticed the headlamps get sprayed when i hit my windshield washer but didnt know where the spray came from until recently.
MINI,37ca3z,DePiddy,3,Wed May 27 13:44:20 2015 UTC,Ah yes noting like hitting it and forgetting it does the headlamps after a fresh detail.  Awesome in a salty New England winter though.

MINI,37eh1n,B_On_Drums,2,Wed May 27 21:23:50 2015 UTC,"Neither am I, but looks like op read as 'What would you have done for that money?' Which is a rather strange question. Or a Klondike bar commercial."

MINI,37eh1n,jiffener,7,Wed May 27 02:29:11 2015 UTC,"Oh geez. Parts are all over the place, labor is through the roof. Who's doing the job, the slowest mechanic on earth?   Belt is like $20, tensioner pulley maybe $70. Actual job time is about a half hour to 45 minutes tops.   Oil filter housing, ok, yeah that's a good 1 hour, maybe 2 hour job if you're having a slow day.   Cabin air filter takes 5 minutes to change out and the filter costs $20 just about anywhere.  Spark plugs about $40 at most for four plugs and labor is maybe 10 minutes.   Fuel filter - $20 parts, labor takes about an hour.   Air filter - ok that's the only one in the ballpark, but even then, labor is about 2 minutes, depending on how much stuff is in the glove box.    Pretty common to charge for shop supplies, I use a good $5-10 for every car that comes in, but you'd think with the labor rates they already recovered that and then some.   Sounds like they charged you $1100 for at most 4 or 5 hours of work. I could probably get all that done before lunch and I'm not even a pro. But hey, pros have overhead.   Watch my videos on YouTube, start saving money. Even if you have to buy tools or break something once in a while, you're still ahead. For $1100 you could have a a floor jack, jack stands, roll around tool cabinet, a decent starter socket set, pliers, screwdrivers and more, with change to spare."

I've absolutely no tools, and no one I know who works on cars within the state. My boyfriend does, but he's not anywhere close by... So yeah.

Here is how long it takes me to do some of these:   Oil filter housing gasket: Parts 4.31, Labor 286    15 seconds while changing the filter, using the gasket that comes in the box with the filter.   Spark plugs BRK6EQUP NGK: Parts 81.72, Labor 66.   5 minutes. 30 seconds each to remove, 30 seconds each to replace. 1 minute to pull and refit the plug wires at the start/end.    Cabin air filter: Parts 43.70, Labor 66.   5 minutes. Most of this is screwing around remembering where the screws are. Skip 3 minutes of that if you do this routinely.

MINI,37e5wv,artyparty,1 point,Tue May 26 23:41:12 2015 UTC,I have an M7 Vortex 2 carbon fiber scoop on my R56. It's functional in that it's open and doesn't have the closed plastic mesh like the stock scoop. It probably won't make a big difference in performance but it can't hurt. I installed it myself but I did have to drill the underside of my hood which was a bit scary. I love my scoop.
MINI,37e5wv,ElderHatesman,1 point,Wed May 27 04:35:36 2015 UTC,so functional in a sense that now there is more dirt in your engine bay :-P
MINI,37e5wv,suburbdad,2,Wed May 27 13:20:49 2015 UTC,This. Adding a hood scoop to a non-S (and even the hood scoop on the Gen 2 S) does nothing other than increase efficiency of engine dirtification. Only the 2002-2006 Cooper S has a functional hood scoop (there is a supercharger intercooler behind it)
MINI,37e5wv,ModMini,0,Wed May 27 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"Probably functional like cooling off the engine or providing higher volumes of air to an open filter......  To say an R56 hood scoop isn't functional is pretty asinine.  I had a 2k10, and it came with holes in the plastic insert that definitely made it functional.  Not to mention intake companies that utilize it for a source of fast flowing air, and don't even mention how a lower FMIC is much better at cooling air vs a top mounted, smaller one on an r53."
MINI,37e5wv,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Thu May 28 03:21:05 2015 UTC,"Ha, well, if you want a functional hood scoop, the R56S is not actually the place to look. The only MINI with a functional scoop is the R53, since it has a top-mounted intercooler, whereas the second- and third-gen cars have front-mount.  Back to your question though: I don't see any reason why you couldn't put a scoop on your car, but the easiest approach would involve swapping out the entire hood. Your money is better spent elsewhere.  If you want to go for a meaner look, I recommend swapping out the front grilles for the S version, and blacking out a bunch of chrome."
MINI,37e5wv,MrDerk,2,Wed May 27 01:23:32 2015 UTC,So many people buy a non-S and later regret not getting the S. It's more than just a bonnet scoop.
MINI,37e5wv,ModMini,2,Wed May 27 19:09:51 2015 UTC,Oh I'm well aware. Money used to add a scoop to a justacooper would be better spent trading up to an S. I just thought I'd stick to the spirit of OP's question.

MINI,37cbcu,Sploit1,3,Tue May 26 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"Hi, I work for MINI and BMW Financial services. We don't do anything with the warranties, but I work closely with some people from the ASK MINI number (specifically, that's MINI of NA). Those guys are the closest thing to a corporate authority for MINI dealerships, because the dealers are actually independently owned and operated. What that means is that if a dealership is fucking you over, there isn't too much that can be done. Make sure you do read through the warranty. As much as I don't like to throw the dealership under the bus, dealers have a reputation for a reason. It's possible they misled you about that. You can ask MINI NA to reach out to the dealership, and they might be able to come to a resolution. No guarantees since I don't know enough specifics of course, but they can definitely look into it a bit for you, and you won't get the run around as much.   Just a word of advise - those guys do deal with assholes all day, so they're typically willing to go a little farther for you if you try to work with them instead of against them. Just bear in mind that they're only in control of certain factors, and the dealer might have just given you incorrect information. Hope this helps!"

My window just stopped working…about halfway up. =/  I have a warranty so I took it to the dealership and they replaced the motor.  The service guy said they do have something of a tendency to burn out.  But I'm sure someone here is way more knowledgeable than me.  Good luck!
MINI,37bwvk,ModMini,2,Tue May 26 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear you've resolved it. Our 2003 R53 has been doing this the past 4 or 5 years old, it usually happens a couple of times per year. Thus far we've been able to resolve it by banging on the door.  When it first happened I took the door apart and ""reconditioned"" the motor by using very fine sandpaper on the stator. But the problem came back, and it seems that the banging on the door has been working well enough.   Just last night my daughter said that the window was no longer working. The banging last night didn't work, hoping like heck I can try again when she drives home from school this afternoon and resolve it. Taking the door apart and the window motor out isn't a huge deal but it is obviously easier to bang on the door in the right place!!!"

MINI,379k7n,KarmaticEvolution,1 point,Thu May 28 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"I have no spare currently, just relying on roadside service in the extremely unlikely event of a flat. MINI sells an OEM spare ""donut"" style wheel to go in the wheel well, but it's 15"" and it will not fit on the front of a Cooper S, it's meant to go on regular Coopers (non-S) because the Cooper S has bigger front brakes. However, as /u/nanoWarhol pointed out, if you got a flat front tire, you could just move one of your good rear wheels to the front and put the spare on the back anyway. A bit more time consuming, but you can't fit a fullsize wheel in the Clubman's spare wheel well."

I've only had it 8 months but i think i made a good choice. I got it because i wanted a MINI and need the All4 (i live in the Alps) and didn't want the Countryman (don't need the extra space or the extra doors). It's comfortable, fun, and it turns heads.  Yeah it's bigger than the rest of the lineup (except the Countryman) but let's be honest here - unless your car looks this then it's not a Mini, and you're kidding yourself if you think otherwise. Growing up i always wanted a Mini - a proper mini, an original. But that's not possible now.  In my experience it seems to be a car that is popular with none-mini owners. Maybe BMW should have tried to take advantage of that? It's a nice car, but not exactly a Mini is it? Seems to be the common comment. Yeah, but Minis have not exactly been Minis for a very long time now is my response."

I think what people mean as ""it isn't MINI"" is that it really moves away from the original concept.  You see when BMW decided to remake MINI it was to bring the original into a modern, world wide name.  The first remakes were viciously smaller than most production vehicles, has one of the smallest engine displacements available, and had to be enlarged to comply with modern safety requirements.  Since then, the brand has evolved to a fun, quirky, and compact vehicle for all segments.....very European.  This is how your Paceman in fact IS a MINI."

MINI,377q7e,RacingHen,1 point,Tue May 26 15:41:57 2015 UTC,Technically yes. But the manic switch allows you to switch back to the stock tune and it's not detectable. It's kind of an at your own risk deal as with any other mod. I have a great service writer at mini though and since he likes to make money he could care less about my mods.
MINI,377q7e,RespectabullinMA,1 point,Tue May 26 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"After a few months in my 2010 MiniS, I went ahead and gifted myself the tuning kit for Christmas.  I only did the engine tuning, as I didn't think the car needed any firmer ride.  For me, it was money well spent.  While the bump in performance numbers is modest, the change in the car to the way I drive was immediate and obvious (spirited around town and on twisty roads - 65 and cruising on the highway).  Where it could be kinda laggy before, this definitely gave it a bump in performance.  If you can afford it and think it's worth having the factory warranty and the bump up to a mini preferred customer status for the $$$ purchase, go for it.  You won't be disappointed."

There was an amazing black one with silver stripes that lived along the route to school, and I'd look at it every day and think that one day I wanted a car like that.  Fast forward many years and I've got a job after finishing up at university and it's finally time to buy my first car. It's been a while since I drove regularly and I had started fencing in my spare time (the sport with swords, not putting up garden boundaries...) so I needed a car I could fit a couple of kitbags in so I could drive myself and others to training or competitions. Wasn't intending to use it in the city much, just for long journeys. The sensible choice I made was a Ford Focus 5-door hatch. Incredibly sensible car. Cheap to run, low maintenance, remarkably common so parts weren't an issue, and you could fit almost anything in the boot.  Fast forward another couple of years. Different job, pay rise, and I was hardly ever using the Focus in the way I'd previously expected. Fencing didn't happen much due to inconvenient times, I was driving to work every day rather than getting the bus, and it was incredibly rare to have one other person in the car with me, let alone four.  So about a month and a bit ago, with a tiny bit of encouragement and advice from my parents - who are similarly besotted with MINIs and already have one for my Mum to drive - I had a look at the used listings and found a good deal on a '10 Cooper 3-door hatch in British Racing Green. Test drove it and was instantly hooked. Bought it then and there after some negotiation and have been loving every minute since."
MINI,3742iw,wolf_ie,3,Mon May 25 08:22:49 2015 UTC,"I had always wanted a MINI since I was young. My parents bought me matchbox cars that were all MINIs then for my 16th birthday they bought me cleaning supplies for a car and the movie Italian Job. I swore that they had bought me a Cooper. Sadly mistaken.   Fast forward six years, I had just graduated college with a bachelors in chemistry, started my professional teaching career and my first car finally died. I knew it was time. I shopped around and found a manual 08 Justa with 38k and pounced on it. The day I test drove it, my dad and I took it down some back roads where I proceeded to enjoy the twists and turns. It's been a wrap since then.   I've plastidipped the whole car twice now, added some custom lights, replaced trim and added a k&n cold air intake. I've heard the later R56s have their own problems, which worries me, but my drive to work everyday is one of the best ways to start the day. Can't wait to see where Randy takes me.   Keep motoring and don't forget get to wave.   Edit: various phone typing mistakes."

The one with Mark Wahlberg.    Last year when I knew I could finally afford my first brand new car I told my husband I wanted a MINI.

Some days I get in and wish I got something else, but others I like it a lot. I got my r56 mcs cheap, so I feel better about that aspect, but if I had more money to drop I would have probably got something a bit faster. My favorite thing about the mini is that its simple, I have almost no options with mine, I wish I had roll up windows. I like the stripped aspect of the car and how it is like a mini race car for the street and it has a great driving feel. Some days I feel like I wish I had something else, but others I enjoy it."

MINI,372n9g,2legit2kwit01,2,Sun May 24 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"For 10K that puts you in R53 country.  I don't think they break down much more than the average vehicle (in 05/06 MINIs were just below average for reliability ratings), but that is a definite concern.  The good news is you can get a base or an S for under that and save the rest for any issues that pop up.    IMO, it seem that you are looking for a vehicle to get you to and from school that is reliable, the quirky traits and fun driving are not as big of a priority, correct?  If so, I would look into a civic or corolla."
MINI,372n9g,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Sun May 24 13:16:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah civic and Corolla are my forerunners, but I have always driven cars with 'personality' so I was wanting maybe a fun car (Mini) but I just don't think I will be able to afford the maintenance. I always have the worst car-luck."
MINI,372n9g,ReleaseTheRobot,1 point,Sun May 24 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"another car that is reliable and can be fun (Not MINI fun, but Honda fun), is the Acura RSX or the TSX (04-06)"
MINI,372n9g,zr0z,1 point,Mon May 25 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think the maintenance on a Mini is nearly as expensive as it's made out to be. I owned a 2009 Cooper S for 4 years and put 70K miles on it - Never had to do any serious/costly maintenance. Now I own a 2011 Countryman and it's handling everything well. I have done all the work myself and the parts cost has been competitive with other cars I've owned including Honda, Toyota, etc.   If you decide against a Mini don't justify it by saying that it will cost you too much for maintenance. They're slightly more expensive than your average car.   EDIT: Also wanted to add that a Mini will definitely add that personality you are looking for AND will be much more fun to drive than a Honda or Toyota."

MINI,3729e2,ModMini,1 point,Sun May 24 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"I graduated from zero mechanic schools. It's about aptitude and interest. $4300 seems to be the asking price for a R50 where I live. $2500 is low unless there is something major wrong with the car. The 5 speed tend to have less reliable transmission than the R50. Also they like to throw out their clutch throwout bearings. Find out if the clutch has been replaced. On a non-S they tend to go bad by around 110k miles or so.  You might consider an S if you can afford it, the powertrain is more durable and the car is a lot more fun.  These cars have more problems than a Toyota or Honda. Don't spend all your money on the car, you'll need to save some for repairs. If you do it yourself, expect to spend anywhere from $100-$800 in parts to repair oil or coolant leaks, which are the most common mechanical issues, or other deferred maintenance. Suspension is probably pretty loose by now as well. You'll need a special tool for the belt tensioner, about $40 or so on Amazon. The tool is different for S and non-S."

Could be the technicians job or make ready job depending on how the dealer has their process set up and they failed to do that. This is one of my pet peeves.. it gets under my skin when I see a car come in with door sills like your car has. You paid a lot of money for that car and that's unacceptable in my opinion. Call the dealer and ask the service advisor to help you out and if they can't then the service manager will take care of it.
MINI,371gz3,UnaClocker,2,Sat May 23 23:54:34 2015 UTC,The fobs use an inductive charger in the ignition.

Spark plugs are most likely bad, usually when the belt is going bad, there will be a chirp sound or a squeal which is the belt slipping, you don't need any tools but a flashlight to look for cracks or signs of wear, for the last thing, and video of it would help immensely.   If your belt and plugs are bad, I would buy a SC pulley package from WMW, helix, or out motoring.  They will have new, colder plugs, a belt, and a reduction pulley of your choice for about $200, why not add some hp with the maintence? I would definitely do this if your idler pulley was going bead because a shop is going to have to be down there any way and shouldn't charge you much more to remove the old s/c pulley."

I had the spout pushed all the way in, but each time I tried the gas would shoot back out. Manager at the first station I tried asked if I'm sure my tank isn't full, which I am doubtful off since I have been doing more than a fair share of driving this past week. Car is also showing that I only have a 30 mile range. Both pumps I tried where of the old style where you must lift the nozzle holder thing in order to activate active flow of gas."
MINI,36xahs,aka_chela,1 point,Sat May 23 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"MINIs are really finicky. You have to put the spout in enough to push the trapdoor in, but not all the way in or else air can't move past the nozzle to escape and the pump will either auto-shutoff, or gas will spew at you.    I also had this problem with my old Subaru and a pump attendant told me imports have narrower openings for the nozzle than domestic cars, so there's not as much room for air to flow around the nozzle if you push it all the way in. Not sure how true that is, but that could be the case."

I have done everything under the sun from putting it all the way in, halfway in, etc. Even let gas sit on top of the trap and manually push it open with my finger and it still wouldn't take it. Thumped the gas tank and it sounds mostly empty so it's definitely not full. Called the dealership and spoke to service and they are just as confounded as me; only thing they could come up with is that maybe something collapsed.

Car is showing that it only has a 30 mile range and I'm doubtful that my tank is full since I have been doing lots of driving over the past few days. I had the nozzle all the way in, but each time I tried to pump the gas would just shoot back out and the nozzle would not lock to allow active flow of gas. Both Gas stations I tried where the old style pumps where you have to lift the nozzle holder to start flow of gas, but I'm not sure if that would contribute to anything."

MINI,36xmaz,8eightmph,1 point,Fri May 22 23:30:21 2015 UTC,I have but its very overwhelming. I am trying to figure out the best of the packages without just jumping up to fully loaded.
MINI,36xmaz,ReleaseTheRobot,1 point,Fri May 22 23:42:08 2015 UTC,R60 - Cooper S Coutryman ALL4. Just got one and I love it.
MINI,36xmaz,Emilyanny4u,1 point,Fri May 22 23:44:20 2015 UTC,I do not have the four door option but I do have a 2014 MINI Cooper S. I would recommend you test drive both the S and the standard Cooper to see which one fits best for you. I needed and wanted the extra power of the S. Some people do not care about that and can save some money and get just the Cooper.   On my next MINI I may look into the four door option since it is more practical.

MINI,36wrwg,FishValcano,1 point,Fri May 22 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"I had a 2010 Cooper S and recently traded it for a 2006 Cooper S. I believe the 2006 is the better MINI. I loved my R56, but the R53 has a lot more character. It sounds better and it feels better to drive. It also isn't prone to the motor problems that the 2007-2010 Cooper S is known for. The sound of the supercharger is also much better than the sound of the turbo. I say find a good 2005-2006 Cooper S  and you won't be disappointed."
MINI,36wrwg,anuppercasej,1 point,Fri May 22 21:33:01 2015 UTC,"Its worth noting the R52 has the same reliable motor up to the 08 mode year, so either 05-06 hard top, or a 05-08 convertible if you want reliable (for a mini anyway)"
MINI,36vp6m,GodzillaFlamewolf,2,Fri May 22 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"This will sound silly, but... Make sure you pushed the wires onto the plugs completely. Hard to describe, but the first time I ever changed my spark plugs (on any car ever) was on my R56 (justa), I had intermittent misfire problems and I changed the plugs again a couple weeks later... and found out that I sometimes got intermittent spark the first time because I had not put everything back very well"
MINI,36vp6m,jiffener,1 point,Fri May 22 15:25:58 2015 UTC,After reading other comments I think I mean the coil packs... make sure they are pushed in firmly (sorry I am not up on terminology and actually it was months ago that I did this so the memory is kind of vague at this point).   I doubt that you did the same thing as me but it's free to check so before buying anything new.... why not check it.
MINI,36vp6m,jiffener,2,Fri May 22 19:12:55 2015 UTC,You said you've replaced the ignition cables; have you replaced the coil packs themselves? Or is that what you mean by ignition cables?  I just replaced all of my coil packs at 90k and it fixed all of my misfire problems.
MINI,36vp6m,callmesaul8889,2,Fri May 22 17:44:34 2015 UTC,I thought they were one in the same?
MINI,36vp6m,_Gizmo_,2,Fri May 22 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"On the R56, the coil pack is separate from the cable harness"
MINI,36vp6m,callmesaul8889,2,Fri May 22 17:58:33 2015 UTC,I guess what I meant is that on the 1st gen cars there are four ignition cabled that connect to one coil pack as opposed to 2nd gens that have a coil pack for each spark plug.
MINI,36vp6m,_Gizmo_,1 point,Fri May 22 18:27:18 2015 UTC,Oooh! Thanks for that. Coil pack eh. Never would have remembered that name on my own.
MINI,36vp6m,jiffener,2,Fri May 22 19:13:34 2015 UTC,"I have not changed the coils yet.  I just looked at them and the contacts inside the rubber sleeve where they connect with the plugs don't seem corroded.  The body of the coils on cylinders 3 and 4 are rusty, but I would have not thought that would matter.  I may look into replacing them anyway."
MINI,36vp6m,callmesaul8889,2,Fri May 22 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"Absolutely replace them. None of my coils were corroded, but there was rust around the metal bodies. I ended up going with these. The OEM coilpacks are made by Bosch (I believe), but these qualified for Prime shipping, so I gave them a shot. Not one misfire since.  e: That link is directly from my previous orders page. Amazon parts fitment guide is wrong, so it probably will try to say that they won't fit your car. I can assure you they'll fit any R5X with the N14 or N18 motor."
MINI,36vp6m,callmesaul8889,2,Fri May 22 19:23:56 2015 UTC,I saw those and wondered about them.  I will order them now.  Thanks!
MINI,36vp6m,c4cooke,1 point,Fri May 22 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I hope that solves your misfire issues. If it doesn't resolve them completely, it's at least going to improve them.   For anyone else reading this, if you're getting misfires and you have rusty coilpacks, replace them before they go bad. It takes less than 5 minutes to replace them and you can get all 4 for around $150."
MINI,36vp6m,smokeysevin,2,Fri May 22 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"This happened to my wifes R57 when the high pressure fuel pump started going out.  Rough idle at cold, occasional stutter, but once it warmed up, all was well in the world."
MINI,36vp6m,zpow,1 point,Fri May 22 23:37:13 2015 UTC,Mine did the same thing and was fixed the same way. Also its worth checking the vanos solenoids if that doesn't work

MINI,36vbs1,Emilyanny4u,1 point,Fri May 22 13:16:54 2015 UTC,"Did you talk them down for those repairs.  Here is the thing, repairs on a MINI are either expensive at a shop (even easy stuff) or tougher than average at home because of limited space.  Those are common, no big deal issues, but can be a PITA to get to and change"
MINI,36vbs1,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Fri May 22 14:26:34 2015 UTC,They gave me $500 towards my car as the mini was already a great price. I got $600 less on my wrx than I paid for it new    The euro shop that gave it a pre purchase inspection quoted me $900 between parts and labor at $108 an hour    I'm going to take it to a personal mechanic.

MINI,36rjke,vis_tamoKi,7,Thu May 21 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"its the whole side rail unfortunately :/   Only way to get it is to order the ""gutter"" that includes that piece and runs the length of the roof to the top of the 'C' pillar.   I know that one the hard way as well.   note: I had to RMA it twice before the third one shipped and did not break off in transit. it is just not strong at all when exposed so tell your friends to be super careful when putting the new one on.   Old side rail is held on by (i think 2? ) screws at the back (open the trunk and pop off the trim)   A few that are accessible from the door jams by removing the door-seal and then a lot of fairly uncomfortably stiff snap clips along the rear glass.   first time it came in  http://i.imgur.com/K9wthBp.png  don't worry. They easily RMA it and send a new one.   right side   http://www.ecstuning.com/ES78110/  left side  http://www.ecstuning.com/ES78109/"
MINI,36rjke,ransom40,5,Thu May 21 15:57:05 2015 UTC,if you need any help with where the screws are located I can take pictures by request and draw up a short and semi-vague how-to.   Just message me directly and I can throw it together one evening.
MINI,36rjke,ransom40,1 point,Thu May 21 15:58:06 2015 UTC,Exact reason why I used some heavy duty sealant when mine started to peel off in the corner. Seems like a pain!
MINI,36rjke,MacaroniMidler,0,Thu May 21 22:19:21 2015 UTC,you do know that that piece is part of the roof gutter right... keeps water running down from the roof and out through the gutter drain in the A pillar rather than sitting on the roof and going into the car through the sheet metal seam...  if its clogged you could get moisture into that weld joint and the cabin which could do many not-so-good things...
MINI,36rzip,Mo_mini_mo_problems,5,Thu May 21 17:28:29 2015 UTC,"Check your oil, check your coolant, check your tyre pressure.

If you're going to get a 2007-2014 model and don't have plenty of money for repairs, you'll want a non-S. The S is fine pre-2007.   The only real issues you'll be prone to with the 2006 will likely be age related, like seals. That's true of any car. You shouldn't have to worry about anything like spark plugs, brakes, fuel system or supercharger maintenance for a long time."

MINI,36oduf,lukerulles,2,Wed May 20 22:21:51 2015 UTC,I have a 2013 with HK also. Driver side occasionally sounds like it's fuzzy or vibrating at certain tones or with certain base.
MINI,36oduf,RacingHen,1 point,Thu May 21 04:39:39 2015 UTC,Yeah it's super annoying because it makes it sound like they are blown out.
MINI,36n7qk,MCPE_Master_Builder,3,Wed May 20 16:49:19 2015 UTC,"Pump the brakes. You are about to buy the most problematic MINI ever made. If it is your first car, you may want to rethink this. How many miles does it have? Are you buying it from a dealer?"
MINI,36n7qk,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Wed May 20 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, it's not a final choice, but I'm using it as a sort of placeholder.   Do you have a year from the R56/R57 that would be a better choice?   And yeah, not final yet so no details on the miles/dealer  But I will have a few grand stashed for maintenance and repairs   I'm choosing the R56/R57 over the R53/R52 for personal reasons, better milage, and features that suit me more than the R53/R52 do"
MINI,36n7qk,denko_safe_cats,4,Wed May 20 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I owned an '08 (identical to the '09) for almost 2 years and just sold it for an r53. Here is a copy/paste from another thread that I wrote why:  ""Okay, here we go. Ahem... Have you ever owned a MINI or BMW? Is it a Cooper S? Is the dealer a MINI dealer? Is the mechanic very familiar with MINI's? Do you have just enough for the car payments? Would you be frightened by the average repair costing around $500 to $1000? Has it had the timing chain, thermostat, water pump, and/or gasket seals replaced? The r56 with the n14 engine (07-10) are extremely problematic cars. If they haven't already gone, you can be guaranteed to have to replace your thermostat ($500), your water pump ($600), your gasket seals ($200-$300), and your timing chain ($2300). They take premium gas $$$ and burn oil, about a quart every 1000 miles. At about 10 bucks a quart, if you do 12 thousand miles a year, thats an extra $120 in oil outside of regular oil changes. You must find a mechanic that knows these cars. A regular domestic mechanic will most likely get something wrong and cost you money. If you don't like working on cars yourself and are not ready for very high mantainence, get something else. My r56 has put off the whole rest of my life goals in the last year from unforseen, super expensive repairs. Everything is BMW, everything is pricey. The average car takes a jug of coolant costing around $13, MINI's need MINI coolant costing around $60. Everything is like that. Every damn nut and bolt is a special size that you'll need special tools for. Your MINI dealership won't do shit for you when it breaks down unless you've been bringing it to them for everything since day one. The irony is, that they are insanely expensive too, $67 oil changes for example. A MINI was my dream car, and I don't want to steer you away. I just wished that I had listened when people warned me.  If you are really dead set on an r56, get one between '11-'13. That is the n18 motor, not the n14. It still has a shit ton of problems, just a slight shit-ton less.  So in short. get an r53, specifically a 2006 (or 2005 if you cant find an '06) they are by far the most reliable and easiest to fix. However, all MINI's are needy and you better be willing to do your own work or pay out the nose.  I just posted the other day about an r53 i want to buy and /u/2legit2kwit01 crafted a beautiful response that you must read:  First to answer your question, I would look it over for the common mini problems (reference ModMini YouTube channel). I would also ask which Coilovers he is using. That thing is slammed, and I am betting he has blown a strut or two if they aren't VMAXX or STs. Also, take it in for a used car inspection, most likely there will be a power steering line leak, a small oil leak, and possibly a worn bushing or 2. Now with that all said, if you love driving, you will love an R53 over an R56 for many reasons: 1) it is lighter and smaller. It really plays up the go kart feel that the R56 kinda moved away for (due to safety and creature comforts) 2) power delivery is spot on. The R56 is a better ""around town"" car. It is a more comfortable ride, offers more comforts and bigger spaces, offers amazing low end power as torque, and sips gas, but the R53 is much more visceral. Its power is delivered linearly and is predictable, and again, feels much smaller and planted IMO (I didnt have the OEM sports suspension on my JCW). 3). It is cheaper to own. R53s have nearly as much problems as R56s, but are significantly cheaper to fix. We are talking about seals, rubber/plastic lines, and bushings vs timing chains, coolant systems problems, throttle body problems, oil systems problems, all of which are much more expensive to repair than R53s. Also, R53s are proven platforms in terms of longevity (many are well beyond 100-150K) something you just won't get with an R56 (N14). Also, R53s are naturally cheaper because they are older. Also, they don't burn oil, most that burn oil is a small amount and is just due to aforementioned seals leaking. Now gas mileage is a different story....... As far as purely opinionated things, I prefer the smaller, more accentuated curves of the R53. Also, I like the dash better in the R53 (Chrono package), and the single DIN deck (cheaply replaced). I will say, my R56 did have a classier styling with the back seat and had functional cup holders. IMO, you can't go wrong with a R53. My only advice is to find a royal grey one (best IMO) that was driven by a 40 somethings lady on the weekends, and make it yours. That is one thing I love about MINIs, the driving base is so diverse, it is sooo easy to find that perfect car that has been babied its whole life."""

I felt fine about saving up and stashing for repairs, but when you labeled them out, you realize how serious it is! Eesh!  I actually think you may have convinced me otherwise to get an 06! I'll still look into the '11, but last I checked, they were too expensive... I guess an 06 will be a good start! I guess time will tell!   Yeah, actually one of the ""personal"" reasons is because of the shape! I love the curves on the headlights, but I'm not a fan on how low the front end slopes! I think I remember something about the JCW body kit having a facelift... I can't remember, but if that works then it would definitely be a massive consideration!  Yeah, I wish I had unlimited money for the colors! I want to do so many things! Like, a red and black scheme, black and chrome scheme, spice orange and second tone, and I think, my main choice will be a black base, with vinyl wraps on the side with red and white stripes... inspired from the guy with the black R53 with green and white stripes... I'll send you an edit soon.    Thank you so much for the help too! I really appreciate it! You were probably the most helpful person I've encountered on here, and you seemed very supportive on the subject, which many people don't for some reason, and I appreciate that as well! :)"

That's what I was told and I thought ""I worked on my old car, I can fix this one!"" Until it robbed me of every last penny.   Take you time with your buy. Head over to northamericanmotoring.com and spend a LOT of time in the 1st gen section (below) reading the problems people are having and how difficult or expensive they are to handle.  http://www.northamericanmotoring.com/forums/r50-r53-hatch-talk-2002-2006-8/  Read the first link in there, ""Your ULTIMATE R53 Newbie, DIY, and Performance Guide"" It'll have almost everything you need to know.  Getting a MINI as your first car is not impossible, but it will be difficult. If you see yourself as someone who could be sacrificing a full Saturday every few weeks to check things, work on stuff, and replacing parts, then this may be for you. If not, get something reliable and inexpensive as your first car like a Honda or Toyota. You can learn a lot on that while not breaking the bank, then get your MINI later.  I've wanted a MINI since i was 5. I shopped around before I got my first car and got something else. I almost got it again for my second car and got something else. I took the plunge the third time and got one and barely kept my head above water. Now I have one that I love, I can handle, and I know how to approach things I can't handle. A lot of that comes from experience (which has to include failures and setbacks).  If not now, then later...you WILL get your mini. And you will love it."
MINI,36n7qk,denko_safe_cats,1 point,Wed May 20 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll definitely look into that article!  Also, yeah I think I'm aiming too high for a newer model, guess if anything, and I am able to get the mini as my first car, it should be an 06... really does just sound more reasonable in the long run and for my future self!   I am home schooled and working on a plan that should hopefully get me financially self sufficient from home, so I've pretty much got all the time in the world to work on it when I'd need to! But I guess if I do want to travel around, a more reliable mini (if a mini at all) would be a better option for that.  Again, Thank know you so much for all the help! I've been doing a ton of research on minis so I know what to expect, but you really gave me a better perspective on the reality of it! Really appreciate it! :)"

I made my own adapter brackets for the front.   Crossovers for the component front were located right next to the amp in the rear.   i had the factory HK system, so this is much the way the factory car was set up, so I just used the existing speaker wires which all terminated in the rear right quarter pannel to hook up to all of the speakers and didnt have to re-run any of that.   iirc, at the time, it cost me ~$800 to do everything (including some sound deadening and isolation material)   Was better than the $950 for a new HK amp (the going rate at the time)   And it sounds way better too."

Remember RMS values are the max it should be continually run at, but not where it will sound good.

MINI,36ighc,zr0z,2,Tue May 19 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"I bought an 04 JCW about 6 months ago that had 65k on the odo. Mine was a three owner, but two of them were within two years of my purchase but had decent records. I paid $9k since I got it before it actually went on the market through the dealer. Basically pulled it off the truck from auction. Here's the thing on the price for you. It's through the MINI dealer, so work whatever kind of service plans you can with them and extras if you can't get the price down. Sometimes comps are easier to work with and in the end can work out to the same price. The dealer I was working with would have put it up around $11.5k asking on mine, so that's probably closer to what you would want to look for value wise.  As for JCW specifics, you may want to get more into what all JCW was installed. Things to look for (may not be all, just working from memory): Head cover says JCW - covers internals and spark plugs, Supercharger cover says JCW - covers supercharger/pulley changes, Exhaust tips says JCW - covers exhaust system, ECU changes can primarily be seen on the tach, redlines at ~7k instead of 6ish. The 05 had injectors and airbox which could be upgraded depending on the owner. Injectors called for remap of ECU though. Potential to have R56 brakes too, but less likely since service done at MINI dealer.  As for sunroof, that will be a personal comfort call. Nothing comes down into the car any further than an R53 without I believe. You may just have to tilt the seat back a bit if you go with it."
MINI,36ighc,animal7979,2,Tue May 19 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"The sales manager stated he would go down ""500 or 600"". I may buy it if I can get it for 12k with maybe a warranty or something. I'll keep looking otherwise. There are quite a few available in my area."
MINI,36ighc,DriftwoodBadger,1 point,Tue May 19 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Gen 1 Coopers (2001-2006) had superchargers. Gen 2 (2006-2013) have turbochargers.  $13K seems like a lot for an 11 year old car. The mileage is pretty low, but that's still a lot. Have you checked the blue book value for it?  You should check out the R50/R53 Buyer's Guide (The one you're looking at is an R53) on the sidebar under New Member Resources."
MINI,36ighc,DriftwoodBadger,3,Tue May 19 17:14:16 2015 UTC,"I know it is supercharged, but I read something about the JCW package including a different supercharger and some other performance bits? I know about the exterior stuff.. but I was curious what the deal is with the supercharger itself. Non JCW package Cooper S seem to have a black supercharger with ""S"" on it, this had a bright silver one with a giant ""JCW"" on it.   Thanks for the advice. My mechanic buddy offered to put it on a lift for free and look it over before buying."
MINI,36ighc,DriftwoodBadger,1 point,Tue May 19 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"I own a Gen2, so that's what I'm most familiar with. On the Gen2 S series, you get a turbocharger. On the Gen2 JCW, you get a twin-scroll turbocharger. So...probably? The JCW supercharger on the Gen1s probably was a better supercharger than the standard S, but someone else will have to chime in who knows more.  In general, yes, the JCW package is a step up from the S package in almost all respects. Better suspension, better brakes, frame stiffening and anti-roll bars, higher horsepower engine output, etc. It's the top-tier package that MINI offers regardless of generation.  That being said... There are two kinds of JCWs. There's ""I bought a JCW from the factory."" and there's ""I bought an S, and then put a bunch of JCW parts and a JCW badge on it later."" It's good to verify which one you're buying."
MINI,36ighc,jsquared2kim,3,Tue May 19 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a factory JCW kit, I did pull some prices on the Cooper and it seems to be $3,000 over without including the JCW stuff (via KBB/Edmunds)   The salesman was STRONGLY against a lower price (kept telling me the dealer advertises as no haggle... It's a standard MINI dealer), but I emailed his sales manager. We'll see what they say. I appreciate all of your advice and tip on the sidebar (didn't even look, my bad)"
MINI,36ighc,2legit2kwit01,3,Tue May 19 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"Well, you may just have to be prepared to walk away from it if the dealership won't give you a fair deal on it. Telling you they're absolutely only willing to sell it for 30% over BlueBook seems pretty steep and unreasonable to me."

MINI,36ighc,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Tue May 19 22:46:23 2015 UTC,"Like I stressed, the R53 JCW isn't going to register properly on KBB because it wasn't a factory option, it was a dealer installed option, and JCW meant a lot of things such as the aero kit, engine kit, badging, interior, etc.    3k for a JCW with all JCW options is a fair price and tbh, could command a better price in different markets."

MINI,36hnii,iDongiveafuck,3,Tue May 19 13:35:26 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Go with contrasting body/roof colors. All4. If music is your thing, go with H/K and Connect for sure. Really look into the packages and figure out what you NEED [sunroof :)] vs what you want to save money on over being super convenient. Also make sure you really want/need the extra size of the Countryman over the Hardtop.    I traded in my base Cooper for a Countryman All4 and then realizing I wanted that turbo in a smaller size, traded for a Cooper S.   There are times I wish I would have stayed with the CM4, but overall still very happy with my S.   That all being said, you say ""almost sure"" .. what is the reason you're leaning towards the Countryman over the Cooper?   Is this your first MINI?  My opinion on your three questions:   All4 definitely. After a certain speed (I think 80?) it's weighted heavily to FWD. [split may be 80%/20% although not positive] but at more city speeds/snow speeds the All4 will be great. I never had a problem with my base Cooper in Michigan winters, but it was noticeably more handleable with the All4. I got black with black roof, and it contributed the most to not feeling unique. The shape of the Countryman is indeed unique in itself, but in the end, I felt like it was a bit too much like any small black SUV at a glance. Not that I wanted to turn heads, but I just felt it wasn't appreciated for the unique shape it does have.    So, If I were to choose again, I would say Black with Red roof, matching mirror caps, and then find cheap used red brake duct covers for the front grill. It's the JCW look and I think the subtle red accents are nice.  I've also seen white with black roof/caps. Being a larger car (everyone laughs when I tell them the CM was too big for my tastes) I think the black or white looks best.  Or silver w/ black roof Strips would be in roof color, and I prefer the bonnet stripes over sport stripes (only on the bonnet, slightly tapered to the front, sport are parallel and go on the hatch as well.)  Really based on budget. I don't think any of them are a ""waste"" as they are what they are: options. I would really add almost every option, but I'll just give my opinion on one's I've had. I picked my CM off a lot, so I didn't get to choose what it had.. but it happened to have quite a few options. If you can afford it, just get them all haha.    For Michigan winters, the Cold Weather Package has been on all my MINIs. - Heated powerfold mirrors/seats I've always wanted the MINI Connect (the screen) with or without nav.  You mention music: The Harman Kardon upgrade is probably a given then. *Many found it a little 'flat' and replaced the front speakers with a ~100/pair speakers installed by any reputable audio installer and no one was disappointed.  Bluetooth, USB and Aux ports are standard so you can control your iPhone with the wheel controls. Or USB for a flash drive (again, wheel controls) or any other phone through Aux (no wheel control)  The dual pane sunroof is a must have  Xenon lights will change your life at night (black housings with white turn signals look best) (optional adaptive light) I really enjoyed the Rain sensor and auto lights, but it's just as easy to turn them on when you need it  I would have appreciated the auto dimming mirrors, but again, manual turn knob is fine. The Rearview option comes with a compass in the mirror.  I would have really liked to get the bucket seats in back instead of the bench. Just to make it more unique. One day I hope to have a MINI with comfort access.. I just think it's really cool to not have to touch your key.    Check the build page on MINI USA—a lot of these are included in their preconfigured packages."
MINI,36hnii,-rogo-,1 point,Tue May 19 15:49:06 2015 UTC,"Really appreciate your reply. Honestly didn't expect such a genuine and detailed response .  Yes ! this is my first Mini :) And the reason m leaning towards countryman is just because its more spacious compared to the original ,drive around with my friends regularly and go camping,hiking,usually outdoorsy all summer and sometimes in winter too.Honestly I haven't looked at the cooper in detail but presumed it won't suit my lifestyle .  And I guess you have pretty much convinced me on All4 and contrast ,Going to check out Cooper hardtop and packages once again on MiniUSA.  Another couple of questions for you    Is in CooperS driving way more fun than CM4 On what occasions you felt you should have stayed with CM4   Thanks dude !"
MINI,36hnii,-rogo-,1 point,Tue May 19 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"Oh then for sure keep looking at the Countryman. I had told myself I needed the extra space, but after having it, I realized I was just justifying needing to upgrade from my base Cooper. If you actually do camp and outdoorsy things, then I wouldn't think twice about the Countryman and obviously All4. Like I said, it's not true all-wheel, it is noticeably more planted on dirt roads, in snow, etc.   I've had 4 people in my Cooper S on several occasions, and it's cramped. If we all needed even a backpack per person, it would be about the most I could fit in the boot. It's just really a no-go unless you only have one other person and can fold the rear seat down.  You might want to consider the rear bench if you would regularly have 4 friends with you. The rear buckets just make it a really awesome, unique 4-seater 4 door psudo-SUV. If you get the rear buckets, the rail that's between the front seats extends all the way to the back. You can snap in cup holders, phone holders, arm rests, wherever you want on the rail.   For your questions:   The Cooper S feels a little more like a go-kart. It's smaller and I can more confidently throw it around. While the CM is not 'big' by any means, it's extra hight and overall size just made me a little less comfortable with sharp extreme cornering.    This is mostly because I was coming from a Cooper, so I was used to the size/handling of that. I let a couple friends drive the CM and they loved it. They equated it to a go-kart like MINI's are known for. Being your first MINI, I wouldn't worry about not getting the MINI experience with a CM.     When I wish I had the All4.  The interior was a little nicer, and overall the Countryman just feels/looks ""classier""  When I need more space in the MINI. Just went to Ikea a few weeks ago and needed to tie down the hatch just for a relatively small box.    They have the Cooper S in 4 doors now, but I'm guessing for the price you could get a better equipped All4. Just another thing to check out. Also don't know if they're available yet. I stopped myself on my third MINI.. I have to make this one last haha."
MINI,36hnii,-rogo-,1 point,Tue May 19 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"Well thanks again,you have saved me a lot of research time  And I think I will go with bucket seats,looked up images and what you say is totally right,its pretty unique. One more last que - My colleague was hovering over and saw that I was looking at Mini configurations and this came out of his mouth ,Dude don't even think of getting this car,just changing tires on it costs $2000,anything true about his statement ?"
MINI,36hnii,BoxElderBug,1 point,Tue May 19 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Yes, they can be pricy to maintain, but only if you go through a dealer/OEM. As with probably any car. There are several reputable aftermarket companies that you can save money going the DIY route.    Directly addressing the tires.. No, it's not 2k. Although it was probably just a blind jab on their part, it's a good starting point—all MINI's come with runflats. They are great. On any car, they're going to be more costly.   I ran over a metal sign on the interstate behind someone else who did. I punctured the front right tire, and put a huge bulge in the rear right. I drove past the guy with a blowout because of this sign, and drove on to the tire shop. They could order the tire, but it would take a week. I drove it home, ordered from tire rack. 188 ea, 2 tires in a few days. Drove to pick up at UPS and took the tires to the shop and had them installed. AAA might have been free to flatbed to a shop to sit and wait.. But having my car and the option to (advised against) still drive it if necessary, makes up for the cost to me.  There's always the option to replace the runflats with regular tires. This would improve ride comfort, but then you should either carry a can of fix-a-flat or somehow tote around a spare.  I just did the rear brakes on my Cooper S and they were 100 for OEM rear pads. Versus the 30/pair that my friends pay on american cars. Next time I will go aftermarket for cheaper/better pads.  If you're buying your MINI new, they come with a warranty and service plan. They aren't the same. The service plan will cover oil changes, brakes, fluids, a few other things. The standard one that comes with the car is free anyway so use it. After that, you can either spend the money on the extended service plan or be handy and save yourself a ton of money.   I believe I was told that having the dealer do all my brakes/rotors it would be 1800. The service plan was like 1700 and covered a few oil changes as well. Knowing now how easy brakes are.. I wouldn't do it again.. but like I said.. It comes with the car for the first 50k(?) miles / 3yrs.  Edit: when I traded my CM for the Cooper, they went over these plans and the costs had gone up.. so really go over these and make sure they're worth it.  The warranty covers parts and stuff. Be sure to read this and go over it with your sales advisor. I had a speaker go bad and start crackling.. took it in, and they replaced it. I had a battery issue that eventually came back to being my fault, but they had already told me it would be covered by warranty, so they stuck to their word.   Outside of warranty, plan to go aftermarket on everything if you want to keep it affordable.  Another Edit: Assuming you have a MINI dealer as awesome as the one I go to, Your MINI will count down either months or miles then tell you when you need service. You call, tell them your MINI wants to see them, and they schedule you in. You go there, give them the keys, sit and watch tv, read magazines, use the free wifi and refreshments, and they change your oil, top off your washer fluids, do whatever else the computer needs. Wiper blades streaking? Tell them, they'll throw a new set on. They give you the write-up of what they did, and say see you in the next 00k (Usually oil was around 10-12 depending on how you drive) Sometimes its just the annual check-up, so you end up driving an hour for them to tell you it all looks good.   Out of service plan and warranty? Go in, they still treat you the same, just at the end, you pay over $100 for an oil change. Or they come out an tell you they found a leak in a gasket and it will be 1300 to fix. (That's when I traded in at almost 90k miles in 2.5 years)"
MINI,36hnii,BoxElderBug,1 point,Tue May 19 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"The runflats on my Countryman really paid off for me a couple of weeks ago. Early in the evening, I was about a half-hour out of town and unwittingly drove over a large, self-piloting sheet metal screw, which went right into the tread of the back passenger tire: I saw the low tire pressure light, reset it, and it came right back. Searched the tire, found the embedded fastener, and I started swearing. Called MINI and essentially they said, ""Just drive home 50mph or slower: drive in tomorrow: we can fix it. Call us if it goes flat."" Tire never went flat on the way home or overnight. Drove (slowly) to the MINI dealership. They removed the tire, patched it from inside, and reattached it in a few hours.  Runflats may not give the smoothest ride but I'd recommend them, especially compared to all the times I've had to change a tire and replace it with a donut, on the side of the road, with traffic, etc."
MINI,36hnii,BoxElderBug,2,Tue May 19 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"ALL4S - I selected this because I wanted the zippiness of the S (former Saab driver), but I wanted to drive on snow / dirt roads. Only you can decide this, but also it's a balance between what's available now at your local dealership versus your patience for waiting for the exact combo you design. I selected a vehicle that was in transit from Graz that met my needs and waited a few weeks for its arrival. For me, Cold Weather package was a must-have. I work with computers all day long, so MINI Connected was not going to happen at all. :) As always, your mileage may vary.   (Edited for typographical errors.)"

Suddenly, things got serious. No regrets. I went with a simple design: midnight grey exterior with the black interior. I don't really want stripes, but I do want to add some grille badges! Additionally, I purchased the roof rack from MINI, which allowed me to haul 3 friends, their cross-country skis, and their gear to northern Wisconsin for the Birkebeiner. I think at the time I ordered (Oct. 2014) it was several months, but that probably varies quite a bit based on model and factory pipeline."

MINI,36dgrj,Trees4twenty,2,Mon May 18 14:47:20 2015 UTC,"Ok really really important you need to removed the vacuum pump and turn it, the vacuum will seize and cause the exhaust cam bolt to snap, which causes the timing chain to bind up and snap, valves are likely to be bent as well. The vacuum pump is on the other end of the head it is turned by the exhaust cam, I rebuilt a head only to have the pump seize and second time and re bend the valves I just replaced"
MINI,36dgrj,Henchman29,1 point,Mon May 18 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"Just read up on this issue. Definitely a problem that needs to be addressed. My countryman s is coming up on 55k, im gonna pull the pump and check on it."
MINI,36dgrj,domep1ece,2,Mon May 18 20:40:44 2015 UTC,"That's not really necessary, your countryman has an n18 engine, they improved on a lot of the failures of the n14 one of which is the oil loss and oil control, so a vacuum pump seizure, while possible, is a lot less likely, if you have kept your oil topped off and changed regularly, then it should be just fine, also not 100% but I believe they changed the vacuum pump design so that it gets lubricated better by the engine oil."

MINI,36dgrj,domep1ece,1 point,Mon May 18 22:25:23 2015 UTC,Did a quick google search and it turns out that the cooper s has an interference engine. Since the sprocket broke you probably destroyed some valves in the process.
MINI,36dgrj,domep1ece,1 point,Mon May 18 16:20:53 2015 UTC,I believe the first gens are labelled as interference engines too but I've heard of people breaking chains and not bending anything up.
MINI,36dgrj,ShoeBurglar,1 point,Mon May 18 16:27:52 2015 UTC,The older engines are non-interference. The Newish n18 which is in the R55 is most definitely interference.

MINI,36dgnx,glasstoaster,2,Mon May 18 14:46:28 2015 UTC,They cracked the gasket or the housing? The gasket should be replaced with every filter change (the filters come with a new gasket in the box). If it was the housing...that's still a little wild. I know it's plastic but still. Maybe over tightened it? At that point I would be a little concerned about anything they touched!

MINI,36dgnx,Coleslaw19438,1 point,Mon May 18 16:20:35 2015 UTC,"The plastic ""nut"" on the housing is an odd size. I bet the lube gut just grabbed a pliers and torqued the hell of it to get it off. Just a plastic piece so it's not too crazy that the would damage it.   As someone else said check the bolt (make sure they used the crush washer as well to prevent leaks) and check the coolant reservoir and connections. I like to move it out of the way to make the housing easier to get too. Could have disconnected it and or cracked it while attacking the housing!"

I would say size wise it is slightly larger than the 2013 clubman. I purchased the car about a year ago and I live in the Midwest. No issues in snow with snow tires. Do not need the AWD that the Countryman has. I had a Countryman for a loaner and my husband liked the car but I felt it was not my cup of tea. It was a tad to large and did not have the go-kart feel of my hardtop. I wish you luck in picking one. Best idea would be to test drive both. :)

The only thing to watch really is the super charger that is known to start acting up in about 20k miles, and on most BMW related products it's a good idea if it hasn't been done yet to get a new water pump and timing chain at the 120k point as well as more of a preventative maintenance deal than necessarily required. Beyond that we've seen 1st generation cars hit over 200k miles so it's definitely doable."

MINI,3670bo,zpow,2,Sat May 16 19:48:02 2015 UTC,"Let's start with: I am not a mechanic, and I assume no responsibility for this advice.  Last time I had that alert, my spark plugs were carboned up, so I was getting some misfires. In general, it'll go away when your engine gets warm enough to burn some carbon.  It won't hurt the engine, but you'll fail any emissions checkpoints if your state does that. (Mine does).  Changing spark plugs is literally the second easiest thing you can do on your car. #1 is putting in gas. Its easier than changing your oil. You can do it in 10 minutes, hood up, hood down.  Cars with turbos and superchargers are particularly vulnerable to this."
MINI,3670bo,AlwaysLupus,2,Sat May 16 20:54:27 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, so it could be spark plugs after all? The reason why I haven't done it quite yet is I need to get the tool for it and get the plugs, which I was thinking of getting online since it would be easier and probably cheaper. And I need a torque wrench for spark plugs, right? What kind of spark plugs would you recommend? The iridium ones are supposed to last long, but if they just get carbon build up would it even be worth it since I would need to change them out once they get enough carbon on them? And as for emissions, I don't need to worry about them (I'm in Oregon). Thanks for the info!"
MINI,3670bo,Sharkweather,1 point,Sat May 16 22:33:31 2015 UTC,I would buy OEM plugs I've seen aftermarket plugs cause problems. Torque wrench isn't necessary but if you want to avoid issues then it doesn't hurt to use it.
MINI,3670bo,Sharkweather,1 point,Sun May 17 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, I read somewhere that the stock plugs were NGK. Can't remember what material, but I think NGK makes them of all the different materials. As for the torque wrench, it would be nice to have one since they are used for so many applications. I just have no idea what, for example, 16 ft-lbs feels like haha"
MINI,3670bo,lost_profit,2,Sun May 17 07:53:20 2015 UTC,"If it is not flashing then you can drive it but if it was flashing at one point it will do it again until the issue is resolved.   Before anything go check your oil level, it's probably low.   -Do you having any rattling coming from the engine on start up or when taking off?  -The most common easy fixes are spark plugs, a coil or a high pressure fuel pump (which has an extended warranty on this engine and would be covered by MINI.   -If you can get access to a code reader I can help you diagnose the vehicle.   -To remove the spark plugs you need a special thin walled 12 point socket. It's not very expensive but if it's not a coil or the high pressure fuel pump you will need to purchase one for me to help you further."
MINI,3670bo,Sharkweather,1 point,Sat May 16 21:02:29 2015 UTC,"So if it's flashing, don't drive, and if it's not flashing, okay to drive? And sorry, I forgot to mention that I did check the oil right before starting it (I usually like to do this) and it was halfway between the full and 1 quart low marks.   As for rattling, my engine sounds like a diesel (from what I've read this is just a MINI thing), but I'm pretty sure I don't have the death rattle (although it's hard to tell exactly what it sounds like in the videos). I have been considering just taking it in and getting the chain tensioner redone just in case. I'm guessing you were referring to the death rattle in your comment. I'll pay close attention on start up and take off when I drive and see if I notice anything today though.   Out of curiosity, what do you mean by coil or high pressure fuel pump? Even though I bought the car used it could be covered by warranty?   Unfortunately I don't have a code reader but I'll keep asking around to see if someone around has one.   As for the spark plug socket, I'm hoping to have one very soon. Do I also need a torque wrench to do the spark plugs?  Thank you for your help!"
MINI,3670bo,Sharkweather,1 point,Sat May 16 22:44:14 2015 UTC,"My 09 came with a 5 year, 50,000 mile warranty.

Did you get your MINI from a MINI dealer? If so, I'd bet they did all of the out-of-warranty covered repairs before selling it. If not, it is probably a good idea to take it into a MINI dealer to get a once-over."

MINI,365x2q,ChrisHat,3,Sat May 16 13:30:45 2015 UTC,"Depends upon what you would like to do. I'd start off with the suspension. Get yourself a good rear sway bar, I'd recommend the H-Sport 22mm solid or 25.5mm hollow, I ran the 25.5mm hollow and was very happy with it, it will certainly help reduce understeer. Another good bang for buck mod is the NM Engineering Torque Arm Insert. It helps reduce the movement of the engine improves feel when shifting. An Intake won't give you much in the way of power gains, but you will hear a lot more good noise from the motor. There are an endless number of mods,the way you pursue them just depends upon your ultimate goal with your MINI."

MINI,365x2q,bratling,1 point,Sun May 17 02:38:50 2015 UTC,"I definitely want some suspension upgrades, probably coilovers and sway bars, small power upgrades, catback systems(nothing very loud) even a nice front lip."
MINI,365x2q,bratling,1 point,Sun May 17 04:45:23 2015 UTC,"Useful. So, /u/uppercasej and /u/2legit2kwit01 offered some good comments. I'll only add a little.  It sounds like you'd like some improved handling and power, sound, and nice looks.   Start with a sway bar; anything from 19mm up will really improve cornering noticeably. $200 and an hour of install time, it's the best bang-for-the-buck a MINI can get. For suspension, if you're going racing or autocrossing, or want to change your settings regularly, adjustable coilovers are fine; they're also outside my area of research so I won't try to advise a brand. :) If you just want to lower the car, springs and Koni Yellows are both cost effective and handling-effective. If you want to improve the ride comfort and handling but not lower, Koni FSDs are excellent. (Do not use FSDs with lowering springs; they will fail.)  For power, you may want to try out the Burger JB+. It's inexpensive, reversible, can be easily removed when you take the car to a dealer for service, and easily available used from people who decide that +20hp isn't enough for their taste. :)  The N18 engine already has a factory cold-air intake path (like most modern cars) that works pretty well. I like the AEM CAI which turns the cosmetic hood scope into a functional one, but if what you're really after is more easily hearing the blow-off valve doing its thing, it's cheaper and simpler to drop in a high-flow panel filter to the factory airbox. The sad truth is that aftermarket CAIs don't do much for the MINI engine unless you are doing a really serious overhaul (bigger turbo, intercooler, fuel injectors, full exhaust from headers to tip, and ECU remap … at which point you should have bought a JCW :-). If you want some engine compartment bling, ECS Tuning is now selling a carbon fiber airbox that's pretty damned sexy.  You already have the exhaust end of things covered, i think.  Re the front lip, you can add a splitter pretty easily and inexpensively; you also could watch the http://www.NorthAmericanMotoring.com Marketplace for used aero bumpers.  As far as vendors go, I'm really really happy buying from www.waymotorworks.com … the owner, Way, is very active in NorthAmericanMotoring.com, answering questions and providing his experience. Opinionated as hell but in a good way. He's advised me against spending money on some things he sells, which earns him my undying love.   (I asked if, since I was replacing my shocks, I should order replacement mounts and such; his answer was ""We love selling parts but unless those are broken, save your money for other mods."")  Hope this helps."
MINI,365x2q,bratling,2,Sun May 17 15:50:19 2015 UTC,I'll check out some sway bars and that splitter. and I guess I'll have to find a good brand of coilovers but what exactly is the jb+?
MINI,365x2q,bratling,1 point,Sun May 17 18:40:55 2015 UTC,"Basically, it lies to the engine computer about how much air is flowing through the engine, which causes an increase in boost and an adjustment in ignition timing."

For the most part there isn't too much difference between the modded pulleys. 2 psi +- isn't going to make or break the car. As for the burble there's no official way to retrofit it but I've seen a few cars that have done it. Not entirely sure how/why theirs do but they aren't supposed to from a technical standpoint."

MINI,362380,Reinhold_Messner,3,Fri May 15 13:21:16 2015 UTC,"Without tearing the engine apart, the four things you can see on the surface are the JCW exhaust tips, JCW logo on the cold air intake, the JCW diverter on the intercooler, and the serialed JCW same plate on the top of the valve head (and, if it has it, the JCW brake kit on the front brakes).   It's going to be hard to see or tell apart the ported cylinder head and the slightly smaller pulley. But chances are, if you can't find any of the other cheaper, easier parts on the surface, I find it hard to believe they would have done the cylinder head...  My guess is they just installed some JCW parts. I think it's fairly common, I've got like 75% of the kit on my car right now. But yeah, that would be pretty lame if he just stuck the badge on the back."

It is responsible for passing off one of the highest maintenance vehicles as a quirky, fun vehicle, this is why there are so many issues.  People who own Porsches and Vettes, know cars, know how to maintain vehicles.  Nothing about a MINI says I should have to spend half of my ownership checking fluids (how many previous cars that you have owned that required to check oil levels every 300 miles?), checking intake valve cleanliness (have you ever done this before?),  and have to have a decent mechanical background to decipher one of the many sounds coming from the bonnet."

Meaning that they can handle lower octane fuel so that a) availability of high quality fuel doesn't create an issue, and b) BMW/MINI doesn't have to worry about being sued by people that (regularly) don't know what kind of fuel to put in their car. This is also why tuning a MINI can yield some pretty nice hp results at the dyno.   But, if it's just for a fillup or two (I always put midgrade by default, and I made the mistake of putting it in right when I bought it) it won't hurt anything because the ECU will compensate for it."

Completely totaled the drivers side door. They drive a large pickup truck, said they didn't even notice. They had also been drinking heavily and refused my offer to pay for a cab. (I'm a  bartender) Luckily three people saw it happen. I tracked the guy down and threatened a police report. Fortunately he owned up and paid for all the repairs, but she was in the shop just over a week. It's tough, but so sweet when you get them back. My only issue is she's starting up a whole lot rougher since the body work than when I got her. Thank goodness she's still under warranty!"

Probably more of a headache to take it out and remove the wires than just leaving it in.

Mini's are a special, european vehicle. It's something you will find yourself caring about more than you expect, if you really find that you love it. Then, the expensive repairs become justified.   They won't become repairs if you keep up with general maintenance / tuning. I'm driving a 2004 Mini S John Cooper Works that's about to hit 100k and it requires even more upkeep than the general S, but it's completely worth the effort. You get out of it what you put in. You will not regret it, just test drive one. :)"
MINI,35vnfw,haidenVUE92,3,Thu May 14 01:05:04 2015 UTC,"I own a 2005 Cooper and can attest to the expensive repairs. It can be very costly. Especially if you throw a turbo into the mix. But, if you change the oil and keep up with spark plugs and other routine maintenance, you'll get a lot out of those cars. 177,000 miles and still going strong. No regrets."

MINI,35vnfw,jakec589,2,Wed May 13 23:52:26 2015 UTC,"My advice is, if you can't afford one 2011 or newer, lease one new. You take so much risk when you buy an older model and the cost of parts and repairs is Expe(BMW)nsive."
MINI,35vnfw,lukerulles,1 point,Thu May 14 00:24:42 2015 UTC,I don't know why you got down voted but this is good advice. Stay away from 2007 -2010 Cooper S (N14 engine) unless it was a 1 owner car and you know that owner haha or it has CPO coverage currently or very recent. This engine has a lot of problems and if it wasn't taken care of you will pay for it on the back end. Get an R53 or a 2011 or newer R56.

MINI,35uxp4,Vell_muddasick,3,Wed May 13 18:48:34 2015 UTC,Minis are already torsionally stiff compared to other cars but basically here's your options (most options have a give and take);  Stiffen the chassis;  -Front and rear strut bars  -Underbody braces  -Polyurethane bushings or any driveline mounts that are stiffer than stock.   Suspension upgrades;  -Larger sway bars  -Either coilovers or if money is tight then do research on a lowering spring/shock setup that work well together  Tires; Pick a street tire that has good grip. You will lose on how long the tire will last but this will be one of the biggest upgrades that you'll actually feel.   Alignment; Alignment can make a big difference but it depends on what type of driving the car will go through most of its life to determine if it's safe or even worth doing.
MINI,35uxp4,Sharkweather,1 point,Wed May 13 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Im doing some reading right now on those suggestions.   Alignment; The car will be daily driven on mostly city roads and highways. There also will be ""occasional"" (read: daily) spirited turns on twistys on the way home from Uni/work or on some weekends. Should I take any special considerations with this in mind?"
MINI,35uxp4,Sharkweather,2,Wed May 13 20:40:36 2015 UTC,I'm not to keen on alignment specs but on my E90 I maxed out the stock camber and did a little toe in on the rear (supposed to help on turn ins but toe in can be a little unstable when braking at high speeds)   Here's a post that can probably get you in the right direction.   http://www.motoringunderground.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4193&highlight=alignment+numbers
MINI,35uxp4,Anofir,2,Wed May 13 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much carries over between R53 and R56 on suspension components, but I did Megan Racing Coilovers, and put an antisway bar on the back. Word of warning, it is harsh for a daily driver. I've also done polyurethane bushings at the front and put adjustable rear struts on the back and dialed in a bit more camber. I run bridgestone Potenza's as well, and there's a good bit of road noise off of them. All in all, it's about as comfortable as falling down a flight of stairs, but its fantastic in the corners."
MINI,35uxp4,2legit2kwit01,2,Thu May 14 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"one of the MINI vendors has put together a great ""stage 1"" suspension kit for the R53/R56.  For about $700, you can get a RSB, TSW springs, and adjustable rear lower control arms.  This is the equivalent of a tune for your suspension and will really keep your car planted.  If you have more money allocated for the project, this is a very popular path:   Coilovers (with camber plates) or Koni shocks with TSW springs Rear sway bar Front brace poly bushings light weight rims (16"" or 17"")   As mentioned, the best ""mod"" you can do are some sticky summer tires.  The Michelin Pilot Super Sports are by far the best tire you can buy, nothing I have experienced can compare to them."

MINI,35r5n6,MHerboth,1 point,Tue May 12 22:58:24 2015 UTC,"I really like the official MINI rack, though it is really expensive if bought new and it only holds two bikes.  I was lucky to find a used one on Craigslist for less than half the retail price.  It's pretty awesome in that it mounts on the back but is able to slide out so you can still use the back hatch without having to remove the rack.    Another option for a rear mounted rack is to get a hitch that mounts into the back holes that the official rack uses.  A couple different sites sell these, and if you get a 2"" hitch, you can use pretty much any hitch mounted bike rack you want.  These hitches are also pretty expensive, but you can probably find one on a MINI forum and get one for a decent price.  I have the MINI Crap hitch that I picked up from someone on NAM .  Worked well with a 4 bike hitch rack that I was using before I found the official MINI rack.     MINI Rack http://imgur.com/BqO1hTh  MINI Crap hitch with 4 bike rack http://imgur.com/NdcbCvD"

MINI,35pi6j,suburbdad,2,Tue May 12 14:21:10 2015 UTC,OK this may sound like an unrelated question. But do you notice the problems with the display when you are wearing sunglasses? And could they possibly have polarized lenses? Because there is polarized film on the display. If you tilt your head to the side it may enable you to see everything clearly again. Or take off your sunglasses.

Clubman shouldn't be tooo difficult, 19k is reasonable and probably can get a 12' ~ 13' year without too much issue. you might even be able to squeeze in an S if you are lucky. Wouldn't say those are the best year, reports so far stating that they are starting to have problem too, but really you don't have a lot of choice with that budget and selection."

You can easily find a 2011+ model to receive the benefits of the MUCH more reliable powertrain in that range, I'm sure. I had trouble passing my particular ride up because it's a really slick limited edition that whispered sweet nothings in my ear.  I really do recommend you go test drive some 11+ Clubmans and see what you think. They have some really odd eccentricities that take some getting used to, but this is really the most fun I've ever had owning a car.

Hopefully I didn't just drop $110 on a new tensioner and blow it out 5 minutes after installing it.  Anybody know if they actually break or did it just get compressed back to its original state?  It's compressed completely, the way it looks when you pull it out of the box.  On the brighter side, I've never seen the bottom of my oil pan so clean.  Rear main seal really helped."
MINI,35efpc,Audiontoxication,1 point,Sun May 10 00:52:41 2015 UTC,Too much oil which gets whipped up and the air inside the tensioner let's the chain compress it?  Chain starts to rattle.  Or the plastic guide is broken.

MINI,35caew,mmcheesee,1 point,Fri May 8 22:50:48 2015 UTC,I believe the soft limit is 6450 but it will let you over-rev a bit. My original motor was spun beyond 7200. My current redline is 7300. And I know of an r53 with a stock bottom end that's seen close to 9k.
MINI,35caew,Audiontoxication,1 point,Sat May 9 06:50:46 2015 UTC,"The limit is 6750 for a stock tune. With stock ECU the max rev limit is about 7950rpm, due to memory register size constraints in the code. If you want to go higher than that you need to get an aftermarket ECU such as the Vi-PEC. Don't bump your redline unless you get something like an RMW head with stiffer valve springs, or valve float will destroy your engine. The bottom end can safely rev to around 7500 or so. Rebuild the bottom end with race bearings and connecting rods and you can do 8500 or so.   Also - remember the rev limit is in software - it just cuts fuel to prevent engine from going over the limit under acceleration. It will not save you from a money shift. If the wheels spin the engine faster than the rev limit, you can cause major engine damage!"
MINI,35caew,ModMini,1 point,Sat May 9 07:09:46 2015 UTC,"Which head and CAM do you have?  Jan mentioned there are 2 options (a $2200 and a $2500).  Also, which CAM do you have, the street or the dominator?   Also, what is your redline, do you have the stock ECU?"
MINI,35caew,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Sat May 9 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"RMW big valve head. I think he only has one head with options for different alloy valves, although he may have gone to just one alloy lately. You need to contact Jan to discuss. Street cam. My understanding is race/dominator cam will not idle properly/play well with the ECU at low RPMS, as there is too much intake/exhaust valve overlap which confuses the AFR calculations. I have a 8000 redline. I'm still on stock ECU because I can't afford the ViPEC (lost my job and new job pays a ton less)."

MINI,35aju9,minidown,3,Fri May 8 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"You have a coolant leak. Get it fixed before you overheat the car and buy yourself a new cylinder head.   Pressurize the system and see where it is coming from. Typical locations is thermostat gasket. Pre 2005 the pressure tank can also leak. Pre 2004 also leaks from the top radiator inlet. The last spot they typically leak is the water pump to block o-ring. I've never seen the water pump itself leak.   Pressure tank is an easy fix.  Thermostat leak - watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0UCjF0lcfI Radiator leak - replace the radiator - use this video to learn how to put car into front end service mode. From there, radiator uninstall is pretty straightforward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk6julH42oc  Be sure to burp air before driving. If you don't, there will be an air pocket large enough to peg the temp gauge."
MINI,35aju9,ModMini,2,Sat May 9 07:15:20 2015 UTC,"I would say, that when you think about driving and the hole in the expansion tank, an empty expansion tank isn't unheard of.  The coolant at full temperature is under extreme temperatures and as such, small holes in the expansion tank is probably squirting it out at high pressures.  That coupled with the fact that the expansion tank holds very little amount of coolant, I wouldn't be worried too much.  I would replace the expansion tank, recharge the system (using the bleeder screw), and put some leak dye in it as well.  Check your hoses for any leakes and repair as necessary."
MINI,35aju9,2legit2kwit01,2,Sat May 9 01:07:34 2015 UTC,"The tank should never be empty. When cold, the coolant level should be just above the ""S"" fins at the bottom of the tank."
MINI,35aju9,ModMini,2,Sat May 9 07:18:29 2015 UTC,"Yea I was saying that with a hole in the expansion tank, it could be empty from leaking, there isn't a lot of coolant stored in there (maybe a half of a cup?).  This coupled with the fact that he probably has air in the system from before adding the coolant would explain why the tank was empty after 1 day of driving."
MINI,35aju9,2legit2kwit01,2,Sat May 9 13:14:44 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter how much is stored in there - you will lose through vapor loss if you have an open system. You are right though, unless you burp all the air out it can look like you are losing coolant. One time a guy was convinced he had a coolant leak and it was just this."
MINI,35aju9,ModMini,1 point,Sat May 9 20:16:14 2015 UTC,if you turn on the heater or defroster on high (max) do you smell coolant?  Any white smoke in the exhaust?  Does the heater blow hot?

MINI,35aju9,howlermonkey,1 point,Fri May 8 15:04:31 2015 UTC,"If you haven't had any high temp warning lights then you might be ok (as far as engine damage) for now.  It doesn't sound like coolant is getting into the combustion chamber.  Hopefully the issue is just a leaking reservoir.    One more question: If you look under the hood after you stop and take a glance at the coolant reservoir, is it FULL, note the reservoir acts as an overflow/catch can.  Or can you hear it bubbling?  (boiling)"
MINI,35aju9,howlermonkey,1 point,Fri May 8 15:10:45 2015 UTC,"No warning lights, just the temp raising at extended idle (long red light, fast food drive through) and then the fan kicks on and when I got going it would return to normal. This of course stopped when I refilled the tank.   When I looked under the hood, couldn't hear any boiling (assuming it would have been very noticeable) but that is when I saw the the pin hole spout out some coolant. Couldn't tell if it was full due to the color of the reservoir, hard plastic, not clear."
MINI,35aju9,UnaClocker,1 point,Fri May 8 15:18:35 2015 UTC,I think you will be OK. Sounds like your pin hole leak allowed the over-all fluid level to get too low. There are a variety of plastic-weld products that will fix that leak without you having to buy a new reservoir.

MINI,352cs1,TopHatMatt,-1,Wed May 6 19:22:38 2015 UTC,What? What does this have to do with dealerships -- where do you see that this is being driven by a MINI employee? Cars that MINI USA owns/uses for demos don't go to dealerships.

Saying it was company owned and responsibly driven.  However both of OPs statements and the video seem to contradict what I was told.  I also stated that it wasn't a big deal. It was just sorta funny. We all know company vehicles and rental cars get driven roughly because the employees or the renters are not responsible for the vehicle for the long term."
MINI,352cs1,TopHatMatt,-1,Fri May 15 11:49:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding what OP said. Company to company means they put it in hands of reviewers or people that want to feature it.  When OP is talking about showroom, he doesn't mean showroom of a dealership.  A car like this would never be sold through a dealership. If it ever does get sold, it would be through auction. Ex demos are cars that are driven by someone that usually works at the dealership. This is NOT an ex demo."
MINI,352cs1,Broseidons_Brocean,0,Fri May 15 16:09:05 2015 UTC,I think your making assumptions about what the OP is saying.  OP said showroom- that could mean a showroom in a dealership.  That could mean a showroom anywhere technically.

MINI,34xlar,cdiv,7,Tue May 5 16:29:38 2015 UTC,"Well… what do you want to know? What do you value?  My wife has a '14 Countryman S. We opted not to get the All4, and so far, it's been remarkably good in snow. Better than I expected.  Nice power, smoothly delivered. Comfortable ride. Decent handling; it's taller than its little siblings so it isn't as agile. But the extra space makes up for it."
MINI,34xlar,bratling,1 point,Tue May 5 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"How is the power for those? I've never actually driven or even ridden in them, but with 4 adults in my r56s I can feel it bog down a little bit. Adding a larger frame, and awd can't be helping."
MINI,34xlar,mr_mooses,2,Wed May 6 05:58:20 2015 UTC,"It's pretty good, but you're right: it has the same engine but more weight. Power-to-weight ratio can't help but suffer. Still, it's a difference of only 15%. Enough you can feel it, but the Countryman is still light for a 4-door car.  My wife's 2014 Countryman S (15k mi / 181hp), vs my 2009 Clubman S (78k mi / 172hp), feels like it has a lot more power ... which I suspect is caused by my engine never having been walnut blasted to clean the intake valves. I believe I'm substantially down on power from when it was new.  Anyway, point is, the Countryman is still fun and has good pick-up. It accelerates like a hardtop carrying 2-3 passengers. Just not as fun or as fast as the hardtop.  (The non-turbo Countryman, on the other hand, is just plain underpowered for the weight. The weight difference really shows with the naturally aspirated engine.)"
MINI,34xlar,bratling,3,Wed May 6 22:19:31 2015 UTC,"I've had one since May of 2011. I am still very glad I got it, and I really love it, but it has had issues on and off that have required a few days at the dealer here and there. Technically, I should be less happy about it. I had a thermostat replaced twice, and it had a massive problem at just over 50K miles when the transfer case cracked and leaked oil into the clutch.  I had the extended warranty, though, so it only cost me $50, and they gave me a loaner for the 4 or so days they had the car.  I believe the issues I've had were really concentrated in that first model year and that the later models have not had the same issues. I bought the extended warranty anticipating that that might be the case, and it has paid off.  The upsides are the gas mileage (still near the best in its class relative to performance), the fact that it's still one of the only small AWD 5-doors that you can get a stick and premium trim on, the fact that it's insanely fun to drive, the competence of the AWD in the snow—the thing is a mountain goat, and the fact that I still get compliments and questions at the gas station about it.  Oh yeah, and they're writing a ""coolest cars"" article at my school and my car is one of the top five they're profiling."

MINI,34vb65,DePiddy,1 point,Tue May 5 12:52:47 2015 UTC,It can although it depends on the adapter. A good one will allow you to monitor all available engine parameters. I can see fuel rail pressure on mine no problems. About 4000psi or something last I looked. That's on an '07 cooper s.
MINI,34vb65,toxic43,1 point,Tue May 5 16:44:18 2015 UTC,My wife ended up taking it to a shop today. We have an extended warranty that covers the fuel system so hopefully they can fix it without too much trouble.

MINI,34vb65,R56_Ryer,1 point,Tue May 5 18:54:47 2015 UTC,Scan tool MX Bluetooth. It comes with its own app or you can use Torque. Both do pretty much the same thing. Works great.
MINI,34vb65,R56_Ryer,2,Tue May 5 19:08:36 2015 UTC,Same thing happened to me. I have an 07 MCS and it turned out to be the High Pressure Fuel Pump. Back in 2010 MINI extended the warranty on all Coopers built from 07-10 I believe and extended the warranty on the pump for an additional 10 years. Took it to the dealer and it was replaced free of charge. Haven't had a problem since! Hope all goes well for you!
MINI,34vb65,Menism,1 point,Wed May 6 23:29:44 2015 UTC,I'm going to try logging the fuel pressure with Torque bit it does sound like this is the issue. The shop said its a likely culprit. The local dealerships are not conveniently located unfortunately.

MINI,34va2c,kenziealice,5,Mon May 4 21:16:11 2015 UTC,"I put my '05 r53 into a tree on christmas after hitting black ice right before a sharp turn and plowing right over the curb at ~45 mph. I managed to bounce a bit in between some trees before the final one which probably helped dissipate some force, but I still hit the tree hard enough to go up on my nose a bit. Front airbags went off, but me and my passenger walked away no problem. I had a small laceration/blister on my left wrist from where the plastic rips apart for the driver airbag,  but a year later there's not even a cool scar. My passenger reported a sore back, but she had back issues before and there was no lingering pain after a week.   But by walk away I meant we had to climb out of the sunroof since my doors were jammed shut..   pics of my wreck :(   I mean the MINI while not being as small as the original, is still smaller than a lot of the vehicles on the road. head on against a truck or an suv you're going to have problems.. I prefer to think of the mini more as a motorcycle, and try to always know what direction i'm going to swerve if something were to happen. They are made by bmw, and full of airbags though. They're safe enough for me to feel comfortable in them."
MINI,34va2c,mr_mooses,1 point,Mon May 4 22:31:18 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that sounds so scary. Glad you and your passenger are alright after that!  Oh boy, I mean, my airbags didnt even go off in my car, buttt only the driver side doors would open. Both doors on the passenger side wouldnt open.   Oh damn, your poor Mini :c  Right, I suppose the only reason why I worry was because I was rear ended. So i had no idea what happened until after I was smashed into the car in front of me. I honestly didnt even really care about a small car or anything like that until this wreck. Sigh, my desire to want a mini is just so strong.  Thank you for your input, appreciate it a bunch."
MINI,34va2c,mr_mooses,1 point,Mon May 4 22:51:03 2015 UTC,"It really wasn't that bad. It all happened so fast it was just reflexes and a single 1 syllable 4 letter word. I'm sure as a passenger it must have been much worse not being in control though...   The worst part was calling my rents/bro letting them know I crashed our baby :(  But I drive that corner all the time still, just to show it who's boss.   Rear ending sounds scarier though, that's why in motorcycle school they teach you to always wait at lights in gear, and check your mirrors until a car has stopped behind you. Terrifying stuff that's really not your fault and hard to avoid.   Small car does not = unsafe car though. It's all about engineering and chassis geometry (doors still open after a 70 mph crash against a wall smart car). Bigger cars have bigger crumple zones, but they also have a lot more force to dissipate. That's why the old giant cars that were made of steel and didn't crumple aren't as safe as modern cars. Big car vs small car though are still as expected..."
MINI,34va2c,frodnorg,2,Tue May 5 04:32:52 2015 UTC,"Damn, it must have been. Its always worse when you aren't in control I bet.   Oh yeh, that had to be awful. I was so sad seeing my car all destroyed, just all the memories I was like damn. But hey, you show that corner who's boss now so that's good.   Oh yeah, it was on the interstate, everyone was going 40/stopping since it was super congested, some guy in a mustang just hit right into me going like 70 he told the police he didn't get why everyone was going slow. I was like, well then. I suppose that's the part that made me so eh, just because I really wasn't expecting someone to be speeding into me in the middle of traffic. Part of me is kind of glad I didn't look in my rear view mirror though, I feel like I would have even more trauma, lol.   Mmm, alright. Thank you for all the information. It was really helpful. :D"

MINI,34va2c,AvastYeUpboat,1 point,Wed May 6 23:18:58 2015 UTC,"Here's a tests comparing an r50 to an f150.  The tests show that the r50 was much better at hitting a wall at 40 mph than the 97 f150, the second gen f150 did much better but was still about equal to the MINI.   Now that's against the wall, where only your mass matters. If it had been f150 vs MINI head on different story... f150 would have probably just driven over the roof.... That's why everyone should drive small cars :P"

MINI,34va2c,cwginac,3,Tue May 5 03:54:02 2015 UTC,"The mini pretty much has a built in rollcage like a race car. Even though it's tiny it's not the lightest car in the world hence why it gets better than average gas mileage but not insane amounts better. You can feel all the safety structure adding weight just by opening and closing the door. The doors are heavier than you'd think and that weight and extra rigidity helps cocoon you in safety. There are stories of people being plowed into the side by 18 wheelers and flying off the highway at speed and walking away with bumps and scrapes. Obviously head on is never going to end well in any car, but compared to some larger cars the Mini is actually safer than you'd think."
MINI,34vi72,otbflo,1 point,Mon May 4 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"I live in Ontario and drive a 2009 Cooper S. Just picked up an oil filter at the dealer today for $19. ECS wants $11 plus shipping so I figured it was worth the extra couple bucks to get it at my dealer. Make sure whatever aftermarket oil filter you buy comes with a new crush washer for the oil plug. Not all do! I have a Mann filter here that didn't come with a new washer, and it was $10 roughly at PartSource.  Spark plugs for my S at the dealer are $39 each, I can get them on Amazon for $25, likely even less elsewhere.  I know your base model is a different engine but at least it's a rough idea.  I buy a lot of parts from autopartsway.ca and just looked up your car. $20 for a Mann air filter, $10 for a Fram oil filter, $14 each for NGK spark plugs.  Lots of people have strong opinions about brands they use/won't use. I will use MINI oil filters only, but am comfortable with aftermarket air filters and prefer NGK spark plugs (OEM spec).  There's usually cheaper options than the dealer! Good luck finding what you need."

Sure It Goes But When I'm letting my foot off the clutch in 1st gear I'd like her to just go... Not.... think about going and then say ""ok let's go"". Throttle response could be a bit better.  I also feel like my mpg are off.  I commute 50 miles round trip daily for work and run her on 93 octane only.... My gas mileage is kind of slacking."
MINI,34wicd,DePiddy,2,Tue May 5 03:29:36 2015 UTC,This won't fix throttle response.  I think that's a delay in the drive by wire system and dual mass flywheel.

MINI,34wicd,ModMini,1 point,Tue May 5 04:45:38 2015 UTC,Any change you experience is only temporary as the ECU readapts to the conditions...
MINI,34wicd,_Gizmo_,1 point,Tue May 5 06:28:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I've done this before and my thought was...what's preventing it from going back to how it was? Which is what always happens. It's probably more placebo than anything else.
MINI,34wicd,ModMini,1 point,Tue May 5 12:54:27 2015 UTC,It will go back to the way it was. I suppose it's possible it adapts to a condition that is no longer there.
MINI,34wicd,DePiddy,1 point,Tue May 5 15:54:04 2015 UTC,"I figured it was constantly adapting.  I don't meant the short term fuel trim, but the long term one has got to be changing.  How often did the programmer think the ECU would get reset that he would require it to regather/recalculate values?  I agree that I think it will go back to normal soon, but I doubt it's fixing anything that has changed unless it's happened within a few tanks of gas."
MINI,34wicd,ModMini,1 point,Thu May 7 02:08:35 2015 UTC,"Short term changes constantly. Long term adapts over time based on conditions. Actual trim is short term + long term.  When you reset the ECU, long term goes to zero and the car is running basically on programmed values + short term."
MINI,34wicd,DePiddy,1 point,Thu May 7 07:39:37 2015 UTC,So resetting the ECU doesn't do very much at all unless a mod that affects the a/f ratio was recently installed.  I think is what we're getting at for the OP.

MINI,34tzyv,kyle71473,2,Mon May 4 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"wider shot? Side shot? Looks like you also dented the rear bumper itself. If there was any damage underneath to the actual bumper cost would be much higher.   If it's just the bumper cover, paint and body work is still expensive, but I would think that would be more in the $800 range  Here is the realOEM list for a mid-year '12 base cooper countryman.  (not the S or all4 as you did not spec that)   http://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/showparts?id=ZB33-USA-06-2012-R60-Mini-Cooper&diagId=51_8064  Looks like you have the chrome line exterrior, so if you were replacing parts, and not just body fill and paint (which I would highly suggest just replacing them for the labor and depreciation that comes with body filler)   (all prices from ecstuning)   Primed bumper cover (item 1) - $308.59  http://www.ecstuning.com/Search/SiteSearch/51129807197/ES2136556/  frame for the licence plate (chrome) - $31.54  http://www.ecstuning.com/Search/SiteSearch/51129804576/ES2136538/  frame that holds the licence plate (behind the chrome trim) - $65.48  http://www.ecstuning.com/Search/SiteSearch/51129804577/ES2136539/  Paint on the first item should be $200-250 I would think for a half way decent body guy (possibly less) - depends on color, metallic, etc. but the part is primed and ready for paint so assuming you dont muck that up, it should be ready for spray, clear, and polish with little work (and lower cost)   Note: this would be a rough estimate assuming you didn't need to replace any other fasteners, etc. Don't know what these prices would be in CND, nor do they include shipping and install labour."
MINI,34tzyv,ransom40,1 point,Mon May 4 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"Your estimate of $800 US is about $970 CAD, so OP's estimate of $1200 isn't too far off the mark in this case, but probably also means a second opinion might get him a cheaper (sub $1000) quote. This is also based on buying new parts, as opposed to restoring the current bumper, which would be significantly less money.   OP, $1200 is definitely on the high side, but not out of the realm of possibility. I recommend getting a second or third (hell, even fourth) opinion from different shops."
MINI,34tzyv,sarge21rvb,0,Mon May 4 19:10:21 2015 UTC,"depends on the damage and labor rate. At $80-100/hr, you can pay for that ~$300 bumper pretty quickly in body work. cutting, plastic welding, sanding, filling or even the crappier just bondo and getting it smooth method take some time)   The other two pieces I assume he would need to replace as they are the chrome trim bit.   But again, with the picture provided, it is just too close in and at too flat of an angle to see all what damage was done."
MINI,34tzyv,ransom40,1 point,Mon May 4 20:17:49 2015 UTC,Seems like labour was definitely the highest part of the bill at almost $700. The chrome plate will have to replaced for sure.

MINI,34tzyv,ransom40,0,Mon May 4 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"that is a bit high for that. I would say you only need the chrome trim piece and the bumper. That being said I have no idea how difficult it is to remove that rear clip. We have a CM at the house, but I never do any work on it. R53's isnt bad though."
MINI,34tzyv,Harmonic_Content,1 point,Mon May 4 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"You have to take the bumper off to access the chrome plate which requires labour. The bill is 70% labour, essentially $100 an hour. They also have to respray the bumper as well."
MINI,34tzyv,_Gizmo_,0,Mon May 4 21:27:23 2015 UTC,you can do all of the other work though if you know someone with a body shop. only problem then is fade work on the paint. since it is a body line separation though you may be able to get by with just doing it off the car and handling the install yourself. For the labor cost you can afford to buy a service manual and the tools to do the job (pretty nice tools too) for much less than paying that much in labor.
MINI,34tzyv,b33pb33pb33p,1 point,Mon May 4 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"If you are feeling crafty, you could remove the rear bumper yourself, saving a lot in labor costs. It's not an easy job, but I would wager that it's not super difficult. There is a guide on Mini Mania as part of the instructions to install a tow hitch."
MINI,34tzyv,_Gizmo_,1 point,Tue May 5 03:57:29 2015 UTC,A bumper respray is usually around $500 in the US so then factor in any additional parts and the labor. It should put it close to $1K.  I wouldn't say this is extremely high (mainly because the respray adds a lot) but that does seem to be on the higher end of what it should cost.
MINI,34tzyv,_Gizmo_,-2,Tue May 5 13:03:14 2015 UTC,You need to realize that if you bring in you MINI for anything other than oil changes or tire replacements its gonna cost ya $1000+ every time.

MINI,34tsaq,Mandiek,-1,Mon May 4 15:07:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you know how run flat tires work.  When they lose pressure, the weight is all on the stiff walls of the tire itself. This is why they don't recommend patching or plugging, because if you drive on the deflated tire, you start breaking down the integrity of the wall lending to a blowout down the road."
MINI,34tsaq,Broseidons_Brocean,1 point,Mon May 4 16:30:08 2015 UTC,"If the nail was still in the tire, chances are the leak was slow and the sidewalls were not compromised."
MINI,34tsaq,frodnorg,-1,Mon May 4 18:36:06 2015 UTC,I'm assuming she went to the dealer because she had a flat.
MINI,34tsaq,Broseidons_Brocean,2,Mon May 4 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"We seriously aren't allowed to mix run flat and non run flat, it is a liability issue. As well as patching run flats is again a liability issue so we can't do that either. In both instances it has to do with the differences in construction of run flat and non run flat tires."
MINI,34tsaq,Mumma66,1 point,Mon May 4 16:44:30 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound familiar. When I needed new tires, the dealership basically carried run-flats exclusively so I just went to a tire retailer and got regular tires for $100 each. If there was truly a safety issue with having both run-flats and normal tires on a car, I'm pretty sure the guys at the tire place would've said something."

I think the rule of thumb here is that all 4 tires need to be the same size and similar/same types of tires (all season, grand touring, etc.).  Now I stick to the regular tires."
MINI,34tsaq,lizardfang,1 point,Tue May 5 03:32:14 2015 UTC,"As long as both your front are the same, or both your back are the same I'd imagine not. The car is going to handle differently since each type of tire will have a different coefficient of friction, respond to heat differently, and have different strength sidewalls, but unless you're driving to the limit you wouldn't notice them. I mean your donut isn't even the same size as your regular wheels all the times and that's not an issue.   The TPMS system might notice if they're not exactly the same though. I know with an awd car even if they're the same diameter but different width tires it causes issues since when cornering the arc length is different."
MINI,34tsaq,mr_mooses,1 point,Tue May 5 04:39:26 2015 UTC,"I did that as well (2 run flats/2 regular tires) and my R53 handled like shit, just super squirrely above 50 MPH."
MINI,34tsaq,Hwy30West,1 point,Fri May 8 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"I just read the new comments since I last posted here and not only did I mix run-flats and regular tires, I also plugged my run-flat once. Are run-flats still a relatively new thing? This was like 5+ years ago but I can't believe no one at the dealership, tire store, or roadside assistance told me any of this."

MINI,34tsaq,Broseidons_Brocean,1 point,Mon May 4 15:34:23 2015 UTC,It's the countryman turbo
MINI,34tsaq,ShoeBurglar,2,Mon May 4 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"It's a liability thing. They can't take off the runflats and leave you without a spare but say if you came in without a spare or runflats the car could leave in the same ""less than optimally safe condition"". Also there's absolutely no reason to buy tires from a dealership anyways. Tire shops are more than equipped to handle a mini"
MINI,34tsaq,Broseidons_Brocean,-1,Mon May 4 18:50:01 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it's more of a liability issue than a safety issue.  1) Your tire pressure sensors would be out of wack  2) You won't have a spare tire
MINI,34rwy5,pkillian,1 point,Mon May 4 01:09:54 2015 UTC,What did the coil pack cost? I've been having ignition problems and that is my number one suspect
MINI,34rwy5,mmcheesee,1 point,Mon May 4 01:44:43 2015 UTC,"Have you checked the plugs and wires already? They're easy enough to check. Sometimes the wires come off the coilpack just barely; they click once when they're almost secured, and again when they're totally secured. I got all of this in a supercharger pulley package from Alta Performance so the cost of the pack wasn't separate. It's an MSD coilpack, highly recommended by everyone I've talked to who's done the supercharger pulley mod."
MINI,34rwy5,weglanator,1 point,Mon May 4 02:56:54 2015 UTC,"Why is it recomended? I bought mine with a 15% pulley already in there, idk if the coil pack is stock or not."
MINI,34rwy5,texas_biker,1 point,Mon May 4 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"Is it an R53? This MSD pack is the most common upgrade coilpack; the stock coilpack is black and pictured in the album in a box. Im not sure if the coilpack must be upgraded for the pulley mod, but colder plugs are definitely recommended. I was going to refresh my ignition system anyway, the pulley package just made it more convenient."
MINI,34rwy5,texas_biker,1 point,Mon May 4 18:00:25 2015 UTC,You realize that multiple electrod spark plug is just fine. The single is not the plug to use in the mini.  http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzc1WDUwMA==/z/-ycAAOSwstxU3axo/$_1.JPG?set_id=8800005007
MINI,34rwy5,paulharmo,1 point,Mon May 4 16:22:25 2015 UTC,"Why isn't the single acceptable? I was sent these plugs in the Alta supercharger pulley package.

MINI,34qyd9,MrDerk,2,Wed May 6 00:37:30 2015 UTC,"Any reason why?   They were on sale at autozone when i bought them, buy one get one. And I'm not sure if it was a deal compared to other brands, but it wasn't something i felt like cross shopping for.   I'm not sure if we bought 2 sets, or just 1. I thought the wipers on my '98 TDI VW Beetle were rainx as well, but they absolutely suck. And we recently had the windshield replaced when the metal wiper stalk smacked the glass when we were changing the blades so the windows can't be too dirty.."
MINI,34qyd9,mr_mooses,2,Wed May 6 01:13:39 2015 UTC,"They were streaky and didn't conform to the windshield well, despite being their frameless design.

Whoever made the blinker and the wiper stalk needs a serious timeout, absolute rubbish. Wiper speeds are too slow to be more useful than hitting it yourself, too fast for light rain but too slow for real rain, and RACE MODE AS FAST AS YOU CAN..

MINI,34p3of,ClawZ90,1 point,Sun May 3 08:11:50 2015 UTC,"This is actually the problem, it really shouldn't rattle when driving or after the car has warmed up after about 1800 RPMs.  The longer you go with it having issues, the more likely you will have a catastrophic failure.  Replacing it early is a lot cheaper than if the guides break off and you have to fish them out of the oil pan, or worse, the timing chain skips a tooth and destroys your valves."
MINI,34p3of,2legit2kwit01,1 point,Sun May 3 22:34:16 2015 UTC,So I'm in almost exact same boat as you were. I bought my 09 r56 with 49k miles and I had some little problems with it. I went ahead and replaced the timing belt with the help of a friend who runs a garage. But other than that I love the car. Also for the speedo in the middle you know you can display your speed on the center tach by pressing on the turn signal button or what ever it's called. And mini seats recline alot but the level is of the right side of the driver seat not the left which is werid.
MINI,34p3of,kopaka9111,1 point,Sun May 3 08:09:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of your concerns are definitely warranted. I tried getting away from my R56S to get something bigger and more reliable...and I walked away with a R55S. I have a manual which makes for a much better driving experience and the R55 seems to just be a nicer vehicle to drive.  Just keep an eye on your oil, that's a huge part in maintaining these cars. They burn a lot and with the turbo you need to have the proper levels. I also use fuel injector cleaner regularly.  My R56S had carbon buildup and it was a $1000 repair. Mini took the head apart and had to blast the gunk off with crushed walnut shells. I tried using SeaFoam but it was too bad for it to make any difference."
MINI,34p3of,ohhyoulie,1 point,Sun May 3 13:32:18 2015 UTC,"I used an independent shop and I thought the walnut blasting cost my between $350 to 450.  Our cars get it more than others, and cause a noticeable lack of power, but it's a necessary maintenance for any direct injection car as far as i knew.  Oil level is key. keep it in your trunk and check after every fill up. In the middle of the shitty dipstick isn't good enough, keep it FULL.  to answer OP. eh... automatic...

If you plan on keeping it for a while get an extended warranty now while its reasonably priced(a good warranty will be crazy expensive when these cars are out of warranty) and if you drive 10-15k miles a year or more the maintenance upgrade from mini is well worth it.

MINI,34kth1,Fozee,1 point,Sat May 2 03:36:35 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on your history with cars, but I think the MINI is generally built better than most. If you haven't really driven anything else in years, it's easy to forget that the general quality of cars (especially interiors) is horrible these days.  Most of the reliability issues stem from cost-cutting on the mechanical parts. At least it's engineered well, which you're not going to get from most American cars, even some European cars. I tried out a new Beetle recently, and holy shit is that bad. MINI feature ripoffs everywhere."
MINI,34kth1,ModMini,2,Sat May 2 05:09:47 2015 UTC,"The first 3 years of Gen 2 are notorious. They give the MINI brand a bad name. But once the issues are fixed, they become good, reliable cars."
MINI,34kth1,Fozee,2,Sat May 2 07:06:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, there were definitely some ridiculous issues there, especially considering it was BMW's own engine this time and it was significantly worse than the R53. The R56 non-S had virtually none of those issues, but it was never exactly a big seller so we can't pretend that makes up for it."

MINI,34kth1,autowikibot,1 point,Sun May 3 01:48:17 2015 UTC,Prince engine:       Prince is the codename for a family of automobile straight-4 engines developed jointly by BMW and PSA Peugeot Citroën. It is a compact engine family of 1.4–1.6 L in displacement and includes most modern features including gasoline direct injection and variable valve timing.  The BMW variants of the Prince engine are known as the N13. It replaced the Tritec engine family in the Mini and was introduced in the 2011 F20 116i and 118i. This was the first longitudinal engine mount option for Prince engine.  PSA has started to use the Prince family in place of their TU family — the Peugeot 207 being the first car to receive it.

MINI,34kth1,ModMini,4,Sat May 2 04:30:08 2015 UTC,This. Everyone should test drive a 'normal' car when they are thinking about selling. It will make you change your mind. Unless the car you are test driving is a Lotus Elise or something.

MINI,34kth1,ModMini,1 point,Sun May 3 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"Tires are rubbing on shocks would typically be caused by a very worn bearing. Rubbing on both sides? Seems unlikely, but humming is what a tire rubbing on shock tube would sound like. What size tires?"

I just checked and the left side bearing seems fine. On full lock I was just able to get my little finger between the tyre and shock. Could be different  under load?  I am not sure if it is both sides with the shiny shocks, will check tonight."
MINI,34kth1,Partly_Dave,1 point,Sun May 3 22:10:16 2015 UTC,Just tested the other side and the bearing seems fine there too.  Similar clearance between tyre and shock.  I tested with the car on the ground.  See the shock here.
MINI,34kth1,ModMini,1 point,Tue May 5 10:43:44 2015 UTC,That doesn't look like a MINI suspension. Is that a MINI? I thought all MINI have coilover (spring over strut) suspension. What does it look like when on the ground? Is that rubbing against the tire or the arm in front of it? Is this front or rear suspension?

MINI,34lalv,Worton,1 point,Sat May 2 13:58:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have an r56 with comfort access, same as me. When stopping your car you need to press the start/stop button once to make the engine stop and then once again to turn the electronics off. Your central display should then just show a mini logo on it meaning its powered off. Otherwise, the electronics will also turn theirselves off when you leave the car and lock the door just like you have been doing. The fan and oil pump will continue to run after you walk away for a short time so this is normal"

MINI,34lh4f,aka_chela,1 point,Sat May 2 15:32:22 2015 UTC,"They'll do great if you buy snow tires. I bought the cheapest ones I could find, put them on some steelies, and my '04 R53 plowed through the record breaking 17 inches this January."
MINI,34lh4f,Kpantz98,1 point,Sat May 2 11:39:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty amazing. For me.  Short wheel base plus front wheel drive means on turns less torque pulling the rear to slide out.  But as always, the only thing that matters is the tires. Buy a second set of wheels, wrap them in some good winter tires. Switch them out for the season. Its 4000% worth it. Its only a little more upfront cost, but you'll use the same amount of tire over time."
MINI,34lh4f,Ziffaro,1 point,Sat May 2 22:42:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on the amount, and whether you can turn off the traction control completely. My 2004 MCS is good in light snow, but as it gets deeper, or icier, it can't move due to the traction control"

MINI,34kb21,ImThaBean,2,Sat May 2 00:07:23 2015 UTC,"Core, pulley, rotors/pads SHOULD be salvageable at a recycler. The coolant reservoir MAY be, depending on the type of plastic it is and if the recycler accepts it.

Your local scrap metal recycler will pay for old car batteries. When I have a LOT of old metal parts I might take them to the recycler instead, they will pay for clean ferrous and non ferrous scrap metal. I've done this with old engine blocks and stacks of brake rotors and gotten $20 - $30. They pay good money for clean aluminum but you still have to have a lot of it to be worth your time.

That's well outside of my price range.  Is the improved reliability worth a 9K difference? Because for the price, this 2007 is tempting."

'07 was the first, and worst year ever of the MINI, as it's the first year of the gen2 which have all the problems. Expecially at that amount of miles. You're saying that the newerer ones are out of your price range, but expect to be paying that for this one once you factor in repairs and all that jazz... They're not good cars for a single car owners in all honesty. If you do the work yourself they're manageable, but that means you have to have the tools, the time, space, and another ride while your baby is on jackstands for a weekend every now and then.   Esepcially without knowing more of this particular car. Has it had it's timingchain replaced? At least the tensioner?   Has the owner checked and topped up the oil ever single time they get gas so it never goes low?  Thermostat? original or replaced -expect to go soon or have already gone.   Valve cover gasket? - mines leaking at 53k mi  turbo oil supply line? - mine went at 52k mi and took a good solid day of work to do, which meant it took me a weekend and 3 days working after classes until it got too dark and cold.   the n14 engines just don't last very long. If it were me, i'd wait until I found a n18 engine, or until my budget was larger.. Or honestly, grab an r53, and use the extra to keep that on the road.   There are plenty of more people on this thread that know more about the problems, and the seriousness and costs of them than me. But, while I love my '08s to death, it's been a lot more trouble than my '06 r'50 that died at 78k miles from the cvt you mentioned. And I only had my '05 r53 for a year before I put it into a black ice tree grave :(     I'd rather tell you off, than let you get attached to the love/hate relationship that is being '07-'10 gen 2 owner."

I think the s always had 5 or 6 speed boxes regardless if manual or automatic, but i'm not sure. Please google everything I'm saying though as I'm not 100% of the years, and the severity.. I believe the s always had the good 6 speed getrag, but only the last gen non s's received it.   That being said, those cars are old now, so any problems that just come with age and mileage will be showing themselves. So while they might be less likely to break, their maintenance might be higher. Although their maintenance is easier to do yourself, and generally cheaper.  I know their water pumps tend to go as well, power steering, and their superchargers need to be serviced at around 100k mi. /u/modmini  has great videos online for just about everything fortunately."

If the car is otherwise in good shape then it should be worth doing. I feel the same way about other wear items such as brakes and tires.   Yes, 174,000 miles is a lot, but I hate it when people use mileage as the indicator for when they should get rid of a vehicle. Besides, if you spend $2000 could you get a vehicle or the same quality as what you're currently driving?"

MINI,34fpfk,TopHatMatt,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:32:11 2015 UTC,It could have to do with the thermostat. Idle level is regulated by engine temperature. I'm not an expert though (just listen to re-runs of Car Talk) lol.
MINI,34fpfk,jmr3394,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:14:58 2015 UTC,"That's only because the cooling on these cars relies heavily on airflow. There's no reason idling for an extended period of time would damage the car, unless your radiator fan has an issue. When idling, the radiator fan kicks in at a certain temperature to keep air moving through the radiator, and it will balance the temps out."

MINI,34ceug,denko_safe_cats,2,Thu Apr 30 02:07:35 2015 UTC,"It most likely is a slipping clutch. Many people think starting in second is easier, but a simple question of ""why would they even make 1st then?"" sort of stomps that theory. The smaller gear means less wear on the clutch.

Just try to focus your efforts on people who sound serious - you're more likely to get a sale from them than from someone who throws a low ball at you right away. I'm sure you can get a fair price for what you're offering, but remember that it's a fairly unique car (even in the MINI world!) so patience is key."
MINI,34anfm,gs89,2,Wed Apr 29 18:55:04 2015 UTC,My thoughts as well. Most mini performance enthusiast types go for the hardtop (maybe the coupe/roadster as well). I hesitate to use the word 'purists' since the minis we drive are getting less...mini with each successive generation.

MINI,34anfm,Wdwdash,2,Wed Apr 29 17:15:09 2015 UTC,It's probably because the Clubman and the JCW moniker are somewhat at odds with each other. The buyer pool of a performance modeled wagon are a lot fewer than they would be for a performance hot hatch which weighs a lot less.
MINI,34anfm,VicSkimmr,2,Thu Apr 30 15:37:35 2015 UTC,It's probably more car than a typical person needs. I mean a Clubman S is pretty damned tight spending more for a JCW may not be a large market.

MINI,34anfm,MatthewWanderer,2,Thu Apr 30 00:42:08 2015 UTC,"Hi IceArrows,  The issue you might be running into relates to the fact that many people seeking out a JCW in particular have a lot of brand knowledge and, unfortunately, the model years before 2011 are known to have certain issues with the engine.  Savvy buyers in the market for a JCW Clubman, and a Hardtop, will steer clear of 2008-20010 for that reason.  Motoringfile.com has a buyer's guide where these common issues are discussed.  Do you have a link to your Clubman?"

The crappy pictures are due to the plates having been taken off before I could take it a to a nicer place, but they're back on now so I could easily update that soon. That and cars.com only allows 5 free pictures, I posted it on craigslist with more pictures.

I work for MINI and we've seen ONE mechanical repair on a F56 so far (it was faulty valve cover gasket from factory). I wouldn't worry too hard, but that programming update does take several hours to complete... and will probably smoke your radio in the process. When you schedule to have that looked at, prepare to not have your MINI for possibly two days."
MINI,3464xa,AngryIrishWench,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:53:29 2015 UTC,"Hours? That's crazy. Do you mean it can actually destroy the radio for some reason? Seems like it would be cheaper to pop in a new updated unit, whichever is taking the update."
MINI,3464xa,Fozee,1 point,Wed May 6 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"For whatever reason when you do a software update on Mini's (and we have really only seen this on the R56 and F55/56) the radio will not accept the updated software.

Superchargers seem to be unpredictable though.  Some fail at 80k and others go 200k miles without an issue.  Typical other (little) issues are coil packs failing occasionally, oil leaks from gaskets/seals, and the cooling fan for the power steering pump can get crudded up with dirt and stop spinning (though this is much more common on older R53s).  Overall though, an '06 R53 is about as reliable as you can get with the MINI brand."

Change the tyres to standard and get a space saver for the boot, there is a space for it to go. If you get a puncture on the front wheels, put a rear wheel on the front and the space saver on the rear, the 15"" space saver doesn't fit over the front brakes.

On the other hand, Honda doesn't have auto start/stop or full electric vehicles, iirc.  Nissan has the leaf, which is as goofy looking as an i3.  I don't think Nissan uses auto start/stop feature.  Ze Germans have been working on the auto start/stop for a few years now.  I had a rental Panamera S a few years back that had it.  It was impressive.  Just as seamless as the current F56.    I love my Mini for city driving as well.  Though, I don't think it'd be as fun with an extra few hundred pounds of batteries.  I think the biggest problem with it, would be range.  The Tesla can achieve a decent range because of how large the battery is.  A Mini's footprint is so much smaller, it wouldn't get too far.  Especially if you drive with a lead foot."
MINI,346q0a,golfingmadman,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"Honda doesn't have auto start/stop or full electric vehicles   We Mini folks don't even have a hybrid. And start/stop, like I said, was impressive, but I'd like to hear from someone who drives in heavy traffic daily. Also, as electrics kinda make start/stop obsolete, how long do you think this feature will last?   I don't think it'd be as fun with an extra few hundred pounds of batteries. I think the biggest problem with it, would be range.   Tesla's roadster is no bigger than a mini, and gets plenty of range for a city driver (245 miles). I have never heard a single complaint about how much fun it is to drive a Tesla. On the contrary people rave about how those cars rip, and that's based on 5 year old technology.  I hope you don't interpret my post as saying that Honda or Nissan are preferable to the Mini. My complaint is about what the Mini could be.

MINI,346q0a,golfingmadman,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:55:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking at it in the wrong way.  Mini wants to maximize as much possible - efficiency and fun - out of their somewhat conventional engines.  That new 1.5 liter engine is a hoot when you really think about it.  Anyone ten years ago would think a 1.5 liter would just absolutely SUCK and they'd be right because it wouldn't have been forced induced or direct injected.  With the advances they've had with technology, they are able to turbocharge a tiny ass engine and make the base car quite peppy.  Lightweight, lots of fun, decent mileage, and still a ton of technology.  Seems like it's the future for the BMW group.  Even the i8 has a version of this engine.    I think the auto start/stop will stick around for a while.  They don't seem to be shying away from them and most of the current BMW lineup has it.  I never drove the start/stop loaner in heavy traffic.  They can all be defeated though, so if you really hated it you can turn it off.  I guess if I was sitting in bad traffic, I'd defeat it or put it in that ""Green mode"" or whatever it's called and plug along like everyone else.  haha.    I think Mini could be lots of things.  But they learned that lesson with the Paceman, Coupe, and Clubvan.  lol.  Stick to what sells.  If the i3 is an indication, why even go down that road with the Mini brand?  They can't give away i3's.  I can't even get an extended test drive in one in my city."

And this coming from a prior Toyota Echo and Saturn Ion owner (both cars did central speedos correctly and I really liked em). BMW recognized this problem at least and fixed it in the F56 at least.    But then there's just really dumb stuff like if you have the nav system then you don't always have a visible clock. Why? Just stick a clock in the corner and leave it there! Or no indicator your lights are on, having to push the trip button 5 times to find the outside temperature, the page button always going to the notes page for no reason at all, how easy it is to go into reverse instead of 1st and vice versa, only being able to see what's playing if you're on that device's dedicated screen, Mini Connect only working with ancient ass Blackberrys, etc etc etc.    Don't get me wrong, love the car itself, just these tiny things add up and just taking an extra thought or two during the design phase would have eliminated all of these issues :-/"

When starting from a stop/engine off state, do you need to depress the clutch as if the engine were already on, or can you start up into 1st as if it were an auto?  When coming to a stop, at what point does the engine stop kick in?  I'd assume something like ""not moving, clutch depressed, brake pedal down""?  This news excites me more than it probably should.  :-)"
MINI,346q0a,callmesaul8889,2,Wed Apr 29 16:15:14 2015 UTC,"The engine only sleeps if the car is stopped, in neutral, and clutch up. I don't think it cares whether or not the brake is pressed as long as the car isn't moving.   As soon as you begin to press the clutch, the car turns back on. It turns on faster (unless you're launching) than it takes to get into gear and go, so nothing to worry about when starting in 1st.  If you want to turn the car back on, you can either press the clutch or turn the wheel and the motor will start back up."

MINI,342cvl,jesustits,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:48:37 2015 UTC,You haven't lived unless you've had a car fall off a jack! Luckily when it happened to me my wheels were on the car and I wasn't underneath it.  I've since only used jack stands. You can buy them in pairs for $25-$50. Spend the money now to save you a lot more in the future.
MINI,342cvl,_Gizmo_,-1,Mon Apr 27 20:06:10 2015 UTC,Pain in the ass to use them with this car though.  Jack goes on jack point = WHERE JACKSTAND GO  I try to remember to get it under the front suspension (is it still a wishbone if there's only one?).  Comes in extra handy if I have to move the hub up/down to remove a sway bar link.
MINI,342cvl,DePiddy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I'm SUPER careful with placing the e-brake and not moving the car while working on it. Still absolutely not an excuse for not using jack stands. I know I should!"

MINI,342cvl,DePiddy,-5,Tue Apr 28 15:56:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as long at your jack has a cup on the top that can completely surround the jackpad on the car, the worst thing that could happen is the jack fails and the car slowly or quickly drops down to the lowest level of the jack (as long as you aren't under the car).  When I'm under the car I'm more worried about the jack failing than the car moving.  Underneath or in the air for a long time?  Jackstands it is.  Quick suspension change or axle nut or whatever?  Ehhh, I'll run the risk."
MINI,342cvl,ModMini,2,Mon Apr 27 20:49:38 2015 UTC,Not true. The worse that could happen is sudden failure of jack hydraulics. It happens.
MINI,342cvl,DePiddy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:10:00 2015 UTC,"I said that.   the worst thing that could happen is the jack fails and the car slowly or quickly drops down to the lowest level of the jack   You might get some divots in the driveway if it's asphalt.  I suppose it depends on how low your jack can go, too.  Stay out from underneath it or use jackstands was what I was getting at."

MINI,342cvl,dhcp138,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:34:55 2015 UTC,"Really it's either that, or the MINI is balanced well enough that jacking up the front will also lift the back, you just have to jack it up a bit further (which is a bit more dangerous).   I'm probably going to switch to using the board though, my frame flexes enough while it's jacked up that all of the body panels become mis-aligned until it's let down."
MINI,342cvl,ModMini,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:27:25 2015 UTC,"I have done a similar method to this multiple times. Use a 12"" piece of wood and the jack just behind the front jack points, get the jack stands under both front jack points, repeat for rear except with wood piece in front of jack points."

MINI,342cvl,ModMini,0,Tue Apr 28 04:11:15 2015 UTC,it wont. it's the same sheet metal all underneath the door sill. just the back stand parts are not covered with plastic trim.   The 2x4 just distrbutes the load with a soft material so it wont ding up the plastic.   Plus if you position it ~ under the door handle that is the balance point for the car and you can get two jack stands under the car and level in one go instead of having to lift it twice.   you can also lift the front of the car (both wheels) by jacking from the middle of the front subframe if you have a low profile jack and can reach it.
MINI,342cvl,DePiddy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"Do it this way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCiFu6ooYaM  If you would rather not do it that way, do one of the following:  1. Jack up using the front jack point and put the front jack stands on the subframe 2. Jack up on the unibody frame rail (inside of the body pinch weld). You'll have to roll up on some 2x4s for your jack to reach though."

Used to have ACDelco stands until I noticed one of the pawls was chipping. 'Nope'd all the way from there to ECS Tuning and ordered nicer stands.

MINI,342cvl,AskikaMan,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:43:15 2015 UTC,"The rotor set screws are notorious for being impossible to hand loosen without destroying the head of the screw. You really need an impact wrench, or to just leave them off all together. Their only purpose is to hold the rotor in place when you remove the wheel and calipers, but are completely unnecessary 99% of the time. If you're hellbent on keeping them, put anti-seize on them before you reinstall and they'll come off much easier next time."

I can not tell if yours is a 2007+ or not, but my 2007 required a ""thin"" wrench (17mm) to hold the stud that goes in the caliper... it required a trip to the store to buy cheap, thin wrenches.. other than that, it was a straight forward brake job. I had heard of people paying a lot of money to have brakes done on a Mini. It's not hard, I guess it is like anything BMW..$$$"
MINI,342cvl,carsncars,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did my front and rear rotors and pads. It was fun! Mine is a 2008.  I had to go get a small vise-grip pliers. They helped a lot to get the caliper guide pins off. Those are a pain in the butt!  Yeah, it was still a lot of money to replace them! But I got ""performance"" parts from Out Motoring. So far they have been great. One thing that I've noticed with them is they work better once they've warmed up  a bit though."

MINI,3448vx,paulharmo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:35:47 2015 UTC,"A 2010 R56S is a tough call. Objectively, it does fall into the category of MINIs that are least reliable overall (2007-2011 R56S), but a 2010 is a much safer bet than an '07. Personally, as a student, I'd avoid that vintage of MINI altogether unless you can comfortably afford a third-party warranty plan for at least the first year you own it."

If you finance a new mini, expect around 600 usd a month + full coverage insurance (for me, that's 300 usd, but that's because I'm new to the states) after 5k down for a model s with minimal/no upgrades. I only upgraded a few things and I'm up to 670.

MINI,33zr01,samstanford,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:59:38 2015 UTC,"Obligatory this-guy-pastes-this-into-every-MINI-thread post:  r53 = '03-'06. r56 = '07-'13 (I am talking about Cooper S's)   I have an r56 and I'm currently selling it for an r53. (since then has happened) Here is why: Okay, here we go. Ahem... Have you ever owned a MINI or BMW? Is it a Cooper S? Is the dealer a MINI dealer? Is the mechanic very familiar with MINI's? Do you have just enough for the car payments? Would you be frightened by the average repair costing around $500 to $1000? Has it had the timing chain, thermostat, water pump, and/or gasket seals replaced? The r56 with the n14 engine (07-10) are extremely problematic cars. If they haven't already gone, you can be guaranteed to have to replace your thermostat ($500), your water pump ($600), your gasket seals ($200-$300), and your timing chain ($2300). They take premium gas $$$ and burn oil, about a quart every 1000 miles. At about 10 bucks a quart, if you do 12 thousand miles a year, thats an extra $120 in oil outside of regular oil changes. You must find a mechanic that knows these cars. A regular domestic mechanic will most likely get something wrong and cost you money. If you don't like working on cars yourself and are not ready for very high mantainence, get something else. My r56 has put off the whole rest of my life goals in the last year from unforseen, super expensive repairs. Everything is BMW, everything is pricey. The average car takes a jug of coolant costing around $13, MINI's need MINI coolant costing around $60. >Everything is like that. Every damn nut and bolt is a special size that you'll need special tools for. Your MINI dealership won't do shit for you when it breaks down unless you've been bringing it to them for everything since day one. The irony is, that they are insanely expensive too, $67 oil changes for example. A MINI was my dream car, and I don't want to steer you away. I just wished that I had listened when people warned me. If you are really dead set on an r56, get one between '11-'13. That is the n18 motor, not the n14. It still has a shit ton of problems, just a slight shit-ton less. So in short. get an r53, specifically a 2006 (or 2005 if you cant find an '06) they are by far the most reliable and easiest to fix. However, all MINI's are needy and you better be willing to do your own work or pay out the nose. I just posted the other day about an r53 i want to buy and /u/2legit2kwit01 crafted a beautiful response that you must read: First to answer your question, I would look it over for the common mini problems (reference ModMini YouTube channel). I would also ask which Coilovers he is using. That thing is slammed, and I am betting he has blown a strut or two if they aren't VMAXX or STs. Also, take it in for a used car inspection, most likely there will be a power steering line leak, a small oil leak, and possibly a worn bushing or 2. Now with that all said, if you love driving, you will love an R53 over an R56 for many reasons: 1) it is lighter and smaller. It really plays up the go kart feel that the R56 kinda moved away for (due to safety and creature comforts) 2) power delivery is spot on. The R56 is a better ""around town"" car. It is a more comfortable ride, offers more comforts and bigger spaces, offers amazing low end power as torque, and sips gas, but the R53 is much more visceral. Its power is delivered linearly and is predictable, and again, feels much smaller and planted IMO (I didnt have the OEM sports suspension on my JCW). 3). It is cheaper to own. R53s have nearly as much problems as R56s, but are significantly cheaper to fix. We are talking about seals, rubber/plastic lines, and bushings vs timing chains, coolant systems problems, throttle body problems, oil systems problems, all of which are much more expensive to repair than R53s. Also, R53s are proven platforms in terms of longevity (many are well beyond 100-150K) something you just won't get with an R56 (N14). Also, R53s are naturally cheaper because they are older. Also, they don't burn oil, most that burn oil is a small amount and is just due to aforementioned seals leaking. Now gas mileage is a different story....... As far as purely opinionated things, I prefer the smaller, more accentuated curves of the R53. Also, I like the dash better in the R53 (Chrono package), and the single DIN deck (cheaply replaced). I will say, my R56 did have a classier styling with the back seat and had functional cup holders. IMO, you can't go wrong with a R53. My only advice is to find a royal grey one (best IMO) that was driven by a 40 somethings lady on the weekends, and make it yours. That is one thing I love about MINIs, the driving base is so diverse, it is sooo easy to find that perfect car that has been babied its whole life."

Doing some research it looks like only generic ones are available, and that means they won't fit well. They will cover your seat but will by shaggy. If it says one sizes fits all, don't get it.

MINI,33r6g2,paroxybob,6,Fri Apr 24 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"Idling is a waste of fuel. Engines are horribly fuel inefficient until they warm up. The engine will get to operating temperature more quickly by driving it. Plus, idling just wastes fuel as opposed to actually going somewhere as the engine warms up.   Is it bad for the engine? No. The engine will be fine as long as you don't redline it while it's still warming up.  Warm up the engine to ensure every part has oil? Oil has reached all parts of the engine within seconds of starting it. Sometimes when you cold start your MINI you might hear a rattle that lasts for a few seconds? That's the oil filling in the gaps in the timing chain tensioner and the hydraulic valve lash adjusters. When the rattle stops, the engine is fully oiled.   -20C is the same as 0C or 20C from the point of view of the engine. Get it started, make sure all parts have oil, then drive it to get it up to operating temperature as soon as reasonably possible.   TL;DR:  Engines don't have a mechanical need to be warmed up. Cold engines waste fuel. Idling to warm it up takes longer than it would just driving it.   Warmup too short: Less than 10 seconds warm up.  Warmup too long: Anything over a minute."
MINI,33r6g2,ModMini,2,Sat Apr 25 05:55:10 2015 UTC,"I always figured it was due to larger tolerances in older engines, and being cold would mean very slightly larger gaps and therefore oil consumption and whatnot. Of course, we don't have to worry about tolerances at all."
MINI,33r6g2,Fozee,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, the ""let the engine idle till warm"" was during the days of conventional motor oils. These would turn to near molasses consistency at very cold temps. You would need to swap to ""winter weight"" oils and then back to ""summer weight"" during those respective times of the year (and depending on if you lived in the colder climates of course).  With full synthetics, they retain the fluid nature. Plus, manufacturing processes and casting processes have vastly improved over the years which have reduced the crazy tolerances used in the past. Making long warmup an un-needed process. (As stated in the comment above)."
MINI,33r6g2,bradlees,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, so even if you had an old engine, as long as it had modern oil you wouldn't need to warm it up?"
MINI,33r6g2,Fozee,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"That was definitely the case for older engines that required thermal expansion to reach operating tolerances. Not necessary in modern engines unless it's got race forged pistons or something, but even then it's OK to drive as long as you keep load off of it."
MINI,33r6g2,ModMini,2,Sat Apr 25 17:06:47 2015 UTC,"Forged pistons here. Told to heat coolant to ~170 at idle, then keep it off boost until oil is up to temp. Then beat it like a rented mule."

MINI,33r6g2,ModMini,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:56:49 2015 UTC,"Is it bad to leave it warming up for longer than that, besides wasting fuel? I usually start my car, have a quick smoke, then be on my way;  about 3-5 minutes of warming up. I also use this time to let the heated seats and/or heat and/or AC get working. I don't imagine it wastes a terrible amount of fuel, does it?"
MINI,33r6g2,sarge21rvb,2,Sat Apr 25 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"Bad for wasting fuel, that's it. In amount of fuel the car has used in  3-5 minutes of idling, you could at least a half mile down the road."

MINI,33s2tk,CardMechanic,2,Sat Apr 25 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"It all depends on what you want. I traded a 2014 Mustang Premium for a 2014 Focus Titanium (found out tonight I have a rare setup of the Titanium + manual). My SO and I just bought a automatic 2013 Clubman as a secondary vehicle / his car. While it really is just a basic MINI Cooper Clubman, it is still just as sporty as my Focus and gets better MPG overall. I sat in all the MINIs at the Austin Car Show tonight and feel that the Clubman is the MINI for those who want more than 2 people in the car without sacrificing the fun of the of a smaller MINI. I am honestly sad that the new Clubman is going to be a 4 door, rather than the cool 3 suicide doors (though the moon roof on the concept is amazing!!!).  For us, it is more important to be able to have more than 2 people in the car or have some trunk space when we need it. I've had a Ford Crown Victoria (the car my parents gave me), a BMW Z4 and a Mustang besides my current Focus and Clubman. I honestly find that the Clubman is very comparable to my Focus. I wish someone had shown me MINIs a long time ago."

Personally, I think you are nuts, trading in arguably the best built MINI for a significantly larger clubman, but hey, you are keeping it in the family.  The good news is, the N18 is going to be a vast improvement to your R53 as far as tech, interior style, and MPG, I imagine it will be slightly less responsive in the twisties."

I love driving it, but if you can possibly get a 2011 or newer S, do it.  For the Justa, not so critical. Doesn't have the same carbon build up, timing chain, and turbo oil line issues as the S/JCW models.  I went from an R53 (with a 15% pulley and Unichip) to an R55S. Don't regret it one bit."

The MINI dealership (Schomp in Denver) handled the repair, and the replacement engine I received worked great for the next 50,000 miles until I replaced the car with a 2012 MCS.  If you can verify the history of the engine and ensure it's a good engine, and has some kind of decent warranty, then you might be alright.  As paroxybob asked, this is from a MINI dealership, correct?  If not, I'd definitely stay away..."
MINI,33r414,wpskier,2,Sat Apr 25 01:31:24 2015 UTC,No reason to stay away as long as it's been appropriately discounted to reflect any impact on resale value. A new engine really shouldn't make the car worth any less but some people are superstitious.

I like the warranty but if this could lead to problems down the road, I just don't want to be spending all my time at the dealership.    Sales person said it would normally MSRP for 33k.   edit* this is from a Mini dealership."
MINI,33r414,Fozee,2,Sat Apr 25 12:19:06 2015 UTC,"Sometimes an engine just doesn't make it. There will always be a very small number of engines from even the most immaculate productions that are irreversibly ready to fail for some reason. Can happen on the drive off of the production line, or it can happen 250,000 miles down the line.   The new engine will have the same chances of failure really, but it's very highly unlikely. There's no reason to assume it's any different than a car that hasn't had the engine replaced. Plus, that warranty is very nice. MINI is pretty good about honoring their warranties, as you've seen, they'll replace the entire engine if they need to.   I say go for it."

MINI,33lw46,energyinmotion,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:35:57 2015 UTC,For things like coilovers you should be able to make the 07-13 S parts work. They may take a bit of finagling but for the most part the only difference in that kind of stuff was stiffness and ride height. Exhaust on the other hand will have to be specifically for 10-13 non s. I'm pretty sure the bumpers on the back where the tailpipes come out are in different spots and after 10 they changed engines.   Also if all else fails call a vender. And see what they have or can get. Waymotorworks and Detroit tuned are both shops I personally deal with and recommend.
MINI,33lw46,ShoeBurglar,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:45:53 2015 UTC,There really are almost no compatible parts between the two generations.   The strut tower bearings are totally different on a 2002-2006. It will only work the kit is designed to reuse your bearings.   I am surprised you are having trouble. There are plenty of parts for this car. Try searching for R56 when you do your parts searches.
MINI,33lw46,ModMini,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:48:11 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe I was unclear. I listed it 07-13 since that was the first and last years for r56 (gen2 hatch). Most parts will be compatible between the turbo and non turbo version aside from a few bits.

I bought them in 215/40/17  These have probably been the best tires I have owned to date for my R56 Cooper S.  They are not loud like the stock run flats or the KDWs on the highway and they grip quite well in all conditions besides snow since they are summer tires.  I cannot recommend them enough as a solid summer tire that does not portray most of the bad sport tire characteristics.

I'd been worried that I was lax on changing the oil, changing it a 7.5K miles but using synthetic since it was new, but having to add several quarts of oil between changes. So last weekend I used another of /u/modmini 's videos to help change the valve cover gasket (and some other tutorials to change the spark plug tube gaskets).

MINI,33j32a,Fozee,2,Wed Apr 22 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"You'd have to really abuse a W10 / W11 motor to sludge it up. They leak or burn oil more than anything else.   Don't let the oil get down by more than a liter. That forces the oil to work extra hard. In addition to lubrication, it cools the engine and suspends soot and other engine contaminants. It can't do its job properly without enough system capacity.   Once the valve cover is off, spark plug tube gaskets are easy. Just pry the old ones out with a big screwdriver and tap in the new ones."

MINI,33fbqa,TickerLick,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:37:45 2015 UTC,What's your secret for getting that kind of longevity? Any major repairs?
MINI,33fbqa,splinkymishmash,2,Wed Apr 22 03:34:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm a lucky one. Haven't had any major repairs yet, although I have had a few problems with both of my windows. I'm glad that's the biggest thing I have had to worry about!"
MINI,33fbqa,ReleaseTheRobot,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:59:43 2015 UTC,"Building off of this question. A lot of people (specifically in this subreddit) describe MINIs as needy and somewhat expensive to own. Do you agree with this? If so, please elaborate.   I just picked up an R60 S ALL4 but owned an R56 for 3 years and tacking on just about 70K miles and I don't know why they have this reputation."

MINI,33fbqa,marcinsz89,3,Wed Apr 22 01:49:29 2015 UTC,They are Falken CircuitSpec finished in gunmetal gray. :)

MINI,33gsj8,mthslhrookiecard,9,Wed Apr 22 12:11:56 2015 UTC,I'd be looking at a new roommate
MINI,33gsj8,F56_Cooper_S,3,Wed Apr 22 12:15:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I for sure am, but he's sure as fuck going to be ponying up the $ to fix what he broke."
MINI,33gsj8,free_range_veal,5,Wed Apr 22 12:26:40 2015 UTC,"If he's paying, I'd take it to a trusted mechanic/body shop and get a written estimate, some might even do it for free.   If he/she backs out, you'll have it for your insurance claim.   How hard was it hit?"
MINI,33gsj8,OhLawdyDoodle,2,Wed Apr 22 13:49:25 2015 UTC,Well it was up on stands because it's not driveable right now so taking it to a shop isn't really feasible. It's got a pretty sizeable dent in the door so it definitely wasn't just a tap.
MINI,33gsj8,fprintf,3,Wed Apr 22 14:03:54 2015 UTC,do you have mobile mechanics in america? might be worth checking if there's one in your area who can come out and give you a quote
MINI,33gsj8,F56_Cooper_S,2,Wed Apr 22 17:02:09 2015 UTC,"I actually have no idea, I'll have to look into that."
MINI,33gsj8,gs89,2,Thu Apr 23 12:48:53 2015 UTC,"A dent in the door, but does the door close? If that is the part that he hit, I'd be worried that the whole car is tweaked or twisted. Make sure to open and close all doors including the bonnet and the boot lid."
MINI,33gsj8,ModMini,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:51:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, the doors open and close fine, I've sourced a junk yard door that he's going to get to replace the dented one."
MINI,33f6ai,robross1992,3,Wed Apr 22 00:52:05 2015 UTC,"Just done the basics. Spark plugs, air filter, fuel filter, oil filter and and oil change."
MINI,33f6ai,ModMini,6,Wed Apr 22 01:08:53 2015 UTC,Good on you. :-) Now the slippery slope. When will you pull the engine?
MINI,33f6ai,fprintf,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"I think that's a bit advanced, next job might be the crank position sensor O ring when I'm feeling brave :)"
MINI,33f6ai,UnaClocker,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:14:34 2015 UTC,"That crank position sensor O ring is super super easy, at least I think it is now that I've taken the whole front end apart! It should be a little tight to reach it but once you know where it is and how to wiggle it out, it is a 30 minute job."
MINI,33f6ai,DePiddy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"Me too! Dug in to change the crank sensor O-ring, and found a bad water pump (118k on the car, and losing some water, so I half expected it), so I had to go a bit deeper. http://imgur.com/tCPtB7O Thanks ModMini!"
MINI,33f6ai,UnaClocker,2,Wed Apr 22 03:34:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure how other people do it, but I like to thread bolts back into the location that they were removed from.  I see your pan of them on top of the strut mount, but there are a bunch of other ones (subframe, looks like) laying on the ground.  That's just me though.  I tend to put them back rather than keep them in baggies or collection plates.  Looks like your having fun otherwise.  Also, you probably need a rear main seal.  I just did mine and I haven't seen my oil pan so silver since I bought it."
MINI,33f6ai,DePiddy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:55:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe when my clutch finally fails. With 118k on the car and how badly the clutch is behaving already, I can't imagine it'll be long. I've never had a car that needed a new rear main seal before, and I've had A LOT of cars that needed major work. But if it's a common problem like the crank sensor o-ring, I'll definitely get it when I get there."
MINI,33gwag,F56_Cooper_S,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:51:31 2015 UTC,I don't have that Mini but did you get the full kit? Or did you just get individual parts because everywhere I look the camber plates are default.
MINI,33gwag,AlpineCurve,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:25:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I ordered the full kit but they haven't developed plates yet because ""they're waiting to see how the market goes"" before they develop them. So I don't know how the other user got his camber because there's nothing on the market for camber more than the stock .25 degrees"
MINI,33gwag,andk1987,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:29:52 2015 UTC,from a machinist point of view a set of camber plates rly isnt a big job tbh
MINI,33gwag,andk1987,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:30:17 2015 UTC,"Wanna whip some up for me then?! I'm pretty desperate. I wanna make this thing low, but I can't without camber due to incredibly aggressive offset :("
MINI,33gwag,andk1987,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:10:02 2015 UTC,by the time id bought the materials and posted em to ye in the u s of a id imagine itd get expensive
MINI,33ft12,TheFunkyBunch,2,Wed Apr 22 04:09:24 2015 UTC,Washy?
MINI,33ft12,GhostalMedia,3,Wed Apr 22 05:04:31 2015 UTC,Washy.
MINI,33ft12,wildfire359,2,Wed Apr 22 22:44:40 2015 UTC,Washy it is. OP your car is now named Washy.
MINI,33ft12,GhostalMedia,7,Wed Apr 22 23:05:47 2015 UTC,Fuck.
MINI,33dfce,enablesart,2,Tue Apr 21 16:59:55 2015 UTC,looks like a 91?
MINI,33dfce,89bmwm3,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:45:01 2015 UTC,Looks like you are closest to the right answer! Good eye.
MINI,33dfce,89bmwm3,2,Wed Apr 22 16:58:47 2015 UTC,I have a 91 Rover also
MINI,33dfce,PaintMeAPicture,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:14:47 2015 UTC,"Good looking little car. In my favorite color as well. The tail lights/fender flares make me think it's an early to mid 80's model. But I could be way off. Germany has smog laws that are very strict and most old cars don't pass, so I feel that this may be younger than my guess even."
MINI,33e1dx,passim,2,Tue Apr 21 19:38:58 2015 UTC,HP? how does it handle? What year? I have questions. :D
MINI,33e1dx,digipengi,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:37:39 2015 UTC,I only met the guy at a cars and coffee - so I don't know much.  But it sounded great and seemed to haul major ass when he took off.
MINI,33e1dx,ShadowMagnus,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:56:44 2015 UTC,Many many horsepowers That amount of horsepowers in a car that small? Interestingly. I'm gonna assume it's RWD now so imagine a go kart on steroids. Looks to be a Rover model so could be anywhere from late 80s to early 2000s. Looks in fairly nice nick so I'd bet on later model.
MINI,33e1dx,digipengi,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:59:17 2015 UTC,I'd gladly sell my 2008 MCS and one kidney for this. :D
MINI,33e1dx,I_want_icecream,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:02:24 2015 UTC,It's got 'antique' plates which in PA means > 25 years old....
