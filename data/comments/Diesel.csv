Diesel,3e3quk,PincersofPower,4,Tue Jul 21 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely clock spring, or wiring to/from.  Your selector likely needs bushings replaced.  Also, check the shift linkage bracket on the bottom of the shift tube.  Sometimes the two torx screws back out.  The selector indicator is adjustable as long as the plastic housing isn't broken.  There is a knurled knob where the cable goes in.   Not too sure about the button availability, though."

Just walk up to the service managers and ask about a job and your plan in the next five years.  They'll give you pointers on what they look for better than what I can.  They'll tell you need to do this, that, and something else.     I recommend start doing simple mechanic work to see if you like it.  If you do, go to school.  Get a proper degree.  One with math, science and english.  Not a for-profit.  Then get specialized training on the machines you want to work on.    When I worked in a Honda dealership back in 1995, there were always new kids rotating in and out of the shop.  Some kept to it, other realized they didn't like it.   Better to try it out first before taking out $15k in student loans.  BTW, my uncle was a diesel train mechanic in Australia.  He started off doing basic work on the trains, then went to school, then working on the engines, then more school, then driving the trains.   He's retired now.

The only engagement comes from the transfer case, and if the electric transfer case motor fails then theres not much you can do short of removing the motor and shifting it manually. This is exactly why I looked for one with a manual floor shifter, I never have to worry about my 4x4 not engaging unless I physically can't get the shifter into the 4hi position.

Diesel,3e16nc,maxl3ell,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:13 2015 UTC,"Fellow Canuck here, gelling isn't usually an issue because the fuel companies already add it during the winter months. They have to be plugged in below-5. No questions asked. It takes a shit ton of time and fuel to warm up to be able to drive. For our two horse trailer, 95% of the time we use the f-150, or even the expedition for a short haul. I use my diesel for working but rarely use it empty and certainly not for daily driving. Almost always use our gassers for ""just driving"" especially in the winter. Maintenance is a big factor in most of this as the 5.4 gas uses 6.6L of 5w20 that I can find a good sale on at crappy tire, vs 5w40 rotella which rarely goes on a good sale and most diesel trucks will need 12-15 L , $5.99 for a filter vs $35. You get the idea. Occasional towing I would definitely recommend a 3/4 gas. Not sure if this helps. Also, for some damn reason up here until very recently diesel has been 30% higher per litre."
Diesel,3e16nc,Murbec,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:22:24 2015 UTC,"In those temps you have to be actively engaged in taking care of the vehicle. Fuel can gel, block heaters can fail, and if it gets cold enough your batteries won't generate enough amperage to supply the power hungry starter.  Some Diesel engines have issues with angles - the early cummins motors would leak oil out of the vent if they went over a certain angle.  With such a short drive I would stick with a gas 3/4 or 1 ton. I have almost a 1500' climb in about 2000' drive at our cabin - a gmc 6.2 is our normal vehicle and it does great. It's no speed demon, but it can handle anything we throw at it. With the diesel, unless you have bed weight you will need to use 4x4 all the time going uphill or you will lose traction in unfavorable conditions.  We also don't have to worry about the fuel gelling, we have a diesel battery in it for extra CCA, and it doesn't require any additional heating or plugging in."
Diesel,3e16nc,bammad33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:18:39 2015 UTC,Block heaters and proper warming cycles and you should have no problems with a diesel.

Diesel,3e16nc,toaster_knight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:30:17 2015 UTC,The military uses all diesel (JP8) so they don't have to keep track of multiple fuels.
Diesel,3e16nc,bammad33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:12 2015 UTC,I know that's part of the reason but they  wouldn't use it if it wouldn't work just to use 1 fuel.
Diesel,3e16nc,toaster_knight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:27 2015 UTC,"Obviously you wouldn't switch an entire mobile mechanized force to one fuel if it didnt work.  In the 70's and 80's you had a Miriam of vehicles being used in the military. To reduce transportation costs and the need for multiple fuels they made the switch when the Humvee was added. It also helps that you can make homemade diesel with raw crude oil, a 55 gallon drum modified, some pipe, and some water. It's also massively abundant in poor/impoverished parts of the world compared to gasoline."
Diesel,3dy7nw,Big_Dill,5,Mon Jul 20 14:38:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a broken exhaust manifold bolt. They are stainless steel on these engines and tend to break of at the head. The whistling is from the exhaust manifold gasket acting like a reed. Check all your exhaust pipes in the engine bay for black soot, specifically around the rear of the exhaust manifolds. There is also a gasket between the two turbos that can leak and make a noise similar to this, but I'd bet money that its a manifold bolt.   Unfortunately it is not an easy or cheap repair. The bolt can usually be drilled out without pulling the cab or the head with a 90 degree drill, but it is a huge pain in the ass to do it this way. I would usually pull the cab, and it will still be a pain to drill. My advice would be to use regular steel bolts when you put it back together, or else you will eventually snap another stainless one."

Early ones had some problems with some trucks dropping exhaust valves. Was reasonably rare, but very expensive. You also get the occasional fuel system failure from poor quality fuel and/or not frequently draining/changing fuel filters - but this is no different to Duramax/Cummins. Apart from that, they have been very reliable. A number of users on our site have 300k+ miles from hot-shotting with no problems. With the DEF injection they also get much better milage than the 6.4. My crew cab 4x4 can eek out 21mpg on freeway around 60mph empty both before deleting and after (no real notable change in milage)  That said, the 6.4 will make more power easier, with a higher capacity fuel pump and the factory twins if that's your goal. I personally wouldn't go near a 6.4 with a 50ft pole unless I was just building a race truck. In trying to fix the 6.0l woes, they seemed to create more problems."

Diesel,3e0pi6,bammad33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:00 2015 UTC,For that size the highest load rated tire is the MS/2 but they are pricey. You can get a set of AT/2's with slightly less load rating and a little over $125/each.  The MS/2 comes with a 70k warranty and the AT/2 comes with a 60k mile warranty. The biggest complaint for the AT/2 is the lack of depth cut on the side ridge of the tread. At ~40% tread life you lose the additional grip.  Both the MS/2 and AT/2 also get better mileage than the competitors all terrains due to them having a slim profile (pizza cutters) and are getting very popular on the forums.

Diesel,3dw2en,Kiwibaconator,3,Mon Jul 20 06:15:09 2015 UTC,Stock engines don't whistle.  The s spec for oil is for spark engines. Ignore that.   The cf in the manual is the minimum spec.  Higher letters are fine.
Diesel,3dw2en,jgollsneid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:51 2015 UTC,"Ok.  Not familiar with diesels as much as I am with smaller gas engines, I want to be sure before I go and try to be helpful and kill the engine."

The only time I can hear any is when I have the windows down and I'm the right lane in an overpass or a tunnel or something.   As others have already said concerning oil, you really can't go wrong with Rotella T. It's a bit pricey but I think it's worth it"

Diesel,3dw5am,jgollsneid,2,Mon Jul 20 01:40:40 2015 UTC,Carfax is not good for that type of info unless it was serviced at the dealer.  Odds are you won't find any good info. This is why so many individuals ask for records when buying used trucks.
Diesel,3du856,parkerhalo,2,Sun Jul 19 14:57:58 2015 UTC,The valve that cuts off the fuel to the engine is probably malfunctioning. Is the starter making a clicking sound? Tap it with a hammer a few times to see if that fixes the problem. If it does you will have to rebuild it in the near future. Air con I have no clue. Lack of power steering builds character and when you get used to it you wont miss it.
Diesel,3du856,radlerdrinker,2,Sun Jul 19 16:54:39 2015 UTC,Is that a significant issue? The valve that cuts off the fuel?
Diesel,3du856,GSD_LOVER,2,Sun Jul 19 16:57:02 2015 UTC,Yes! If it gets any worse it will run away! look up YouTube videos on run away diesels. It's very bad.
Diesel,3du856,BigTruckProbs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"It's not an engine killing issue. Mostly an annoying one. If it's the fuel shut off solenoid, like radlerdrinker suggested, then it will not cause the engine to run away. Runaways are largely caused by either failed turbo seals, allowing oil to enter the air intake, or by faulty injection systems. So you won't have to worry about a run away unless the engine is hiding other issues."
Diesel,3du856,radlerdrinker,0,Sun Jul 19 18:04:10 2015 UTC,My van has a bad fuel shut off solenoid (so thats how its called) for more than a year and it was a daily driver. So I dont really belive that it could cause a runaway engine. That is caused by bad sealing piston rings. Its probably the wire or bad contact. The part is cheap too.
Diesel,3du856,Scuzzbag,2,Sun Jul 19 19:11:51 2015 UTC,Diesel tech here. Don't fuck with an engine that doesn't shut down.
Diesel,3du856,radlerdrinker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:51 2015 UTC,Ok all that the solenoid is doing is cutting out fuel to the fuel pump so the engine gets starved of fuel and shuts down. But I agree that its better to have it working because its a pain in the ass shutting it down now.
Diesel,3du856,ScreamingVulcan,2,Sun Jul 19 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to chime in about converting the AC system. I did this on my 1991 chevy 6.2 diesel and it cost about $1200 USD. Remember to install a larger condenser, preferably as large as will possibly fit behind the grill because, my theory, the r134a is not as efficient as the old r12 systems so if you want cold AC I would recommend that. Source: Did not change the condenser on my 1993 Dodge D250 when converting and never had cold AC again."

The v07 crank in those motors are very commonly used in Datsun z cars to make a 3.0 stroker motor. Iv seen plenty of these around for sale in my area for dirt cheap but most of them ate either 400k+ or have the motor ripped out to salvage the crank. VERY reliable motors, and with the addition of a turbo they like to kick out quite a bit. Iv driven one and they're no speedster N/A but they actually ride pretty nice. The first gen Maxima's were more geared towards a ""cheap luxury"" styled car rather than the econobox 510 of its time. Similar to Toyota making the cressida and corona and having the corolla the cheapest."

So far the extended warranty has covered both front axle bearings, trailer brake control module and driver side power window button assembly. I have an appointment first thing Monday morning to replace ball joints and a fuel/water separator sensor. All that being said... what were the symptoms of the bad injectors? I've been getting the ""Water in Fuel"" warning a few minutes after I start it for the last week. I drained off the fluid from the fuel/water separator and replaced both fuel filters as soon as it started happening. Service advisor says its probably the sensor gone bad, but if it isn't and I've been running bad fuel I'm curious to know what I should expect in the next 5k miles (30-60 days)."
Diesel,3dsrq0,ClassicallyTrained,2,Sun Jul 19 03:44:34 2015 UTC,"The two codes I had that gave it away was carbon buildup in cylinder #2 and #4 which were the bad injector numbers. It smoked when I got on it getting on the interstate or passing someone (no tune or straight pipe), and the motor had a shudder to it when starting up after sitting overnight. Idk what caused them to go bad. When I get it back I'm gonna check the PSI to make sure the regulator spring or pump isn't bad. When the motor was warmed up, it felt fine so I drove on it for a couple weeks before I had time to take it to get looked at. It was just those couple of things that stood out. Also horrible MPG might have been a symptom. 10.5, haha"

Diesel,3dlfvi,Captain_Cunder_Thunt,4,Fri Jul 17 05:46:51 2015 UTC,Is the starter spinning fast enough? My 7.3 idi was really hard to start when I first got it and never realized that the starter was crap. When it finally died and I put on a new one with fresh batteries.. WOW.. what a difference. It spins much faster and fires up much quicker..
Diesel,3dlfvi,AskikaMan,3,Fri Jul 17 15:02:30 2015 UTC,I was thinking that. It turns over really slowly. Sounds like the batteries are constantly almost dead when they aren't.
Diesel,3dlfvi,johnson56,3,Fri Jul 17 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"Put a charger on them and let it sit then try when they are fully charged. Also have the batteries load tested.   But before you start throwing parts at it, you need to verify what your issue is.   It could be glowplugs not working.   It could be injector pump not sending fuel to the injectors.   It could be your starter not cranking the truck fast enough.   It could be your batteries are too dead to power the starter."
Diesel,3dlfvi,AskikaMan,3,Fri Jul 17 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"yep.. that is what I was experiencing, but did not realize how slow it really was. I would constantly have to charge the batteries and that would help, but since the starter was weak, it would drain them quickly.

Diesel,3dlfvi,randomhero1172,2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:57 2015 UTC,"After reading the rest of your responses I'm guessing either you have one or more weak batteries, the starter is wore out, or your cables are corroded and or shot.  Also, if you don't want to replace your glow plug controller right away you can manually engage the glow plug solenoid by jumping across the two large lugs and then try and start it. I had one that the controller was shot on and we just hooked up a switch to actuate the solenoid manually. That controller constantly cycled on and off and you could hear it clicking back and forth steadily."
Diesel,3dlfvi,epicness350,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"Glowplugs are of no concern since you are in hot weather. It should be starting. Always start with batterys - take both off and clean the connections. Put both on a smart charger overnight. Try again with fresh batterys and connections. You will be amazed at what a difference it makes. If you say you are getting fuel then I assume you see white/gray smoke out the tailpipe when you are cranking? This indicates unburnt fuel going into the engine and coming out. Another thing to check while your cranking is the exhaust valves. Put a piece of regular paper up to the exhaust while another person cranks. The exhaust should blow, if it blows and then sucks the paper back for a split second, you have a sticking or bad exhaust valve. This will make it a bitch to start but should stop it from starting. Really, these engines start and run even with some really bad issues. Start with these signs and then go from there. No smoke? No fuel - bleed your injector lines. Check your air intake. Is it clear and clean? allowing air through? Check your oil. check your fuel filter bowl."
Diesel,3dlfvi,johnson56,0,Fri Jul 17 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"DO NOT USE ETHER TO TRY TO START IT  If you did, that's probaby why it isn't starting   You might have fuel, but do you have fuel pressure?  A pump and injectors are dirt cheap and you'll be suprised how much fresh fuel parts wake the truck up. (Possibly) 31 year old injectors and  pump will make a worlds difference"
Diesel,3dlfvi,epicness350,2,Fri Jul 17 06:37:47 2015 UTC,"DO NOT USE ETHER TO TRY TO START IT   This is OK to do only if the glow plugs are disconnected, and in spritzes of less than a second at a time between cranking periods.    A pump and injectors are dirt cheap.    Maybe for shitty equipment. To get quality parts, a pump and injectors is about 1000 dollars, which alot of times is over half the value of the truck they are going in.   Also, to the OP. You said you've got fuel, but didn't say where. Are you checking for fuel at the injector, at the fuel filter head, or somewhere else. The best way to do it is to loosen one injector line nut at a time (at the injector, not on back of the injection pump) and crank over the engine to verify that fuel is making it to that injector. Do this for a couple different injectors and report back if it still doesn't start."
Diesel,3dlfvi,johnson56,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:35:26 2015 UTC,I guess to me an injection pump and injectors for a grand are cheap. For my truck that figure would be over 2k.

Diesel,3dlfvi,bammad33,0,Fri Jul 17 21:04:25 2015 UTC,It's an IDI with glow plugs - no issues in using ether.
Diesel,3dlfvi,epicness350,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:07:29 2015 UTC,If the glow plugs are operating there is an issue with using ether actually. There's a good chance you'll bend a rod when the glow plug(s) ignite the ether well before the piston gets to TDC instead of right as it hits TDC.  IDI or not it's the glow plugs that decide whether or not you can use ether.
Diesel,3dlfvi,bammad33,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"As long as you use an appropriate amount and know how to use it you won't have an issue. I've used it for years on old tractor and bulldozers with no issues.  Ether should only be used once you start getting smoke coming of during a cold start, and only in short bursts. Many older equipment manufacturers had ether injection on large Diesel engines back in the day.   Most common teaching is anti ether due to operators and mechanics not knowing how to use it."
Diesel,3dlfvi,randomhero1172,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:12:05 2015 UTC,Ether will destroy GPs and if the ether ignites it's not going to ignite when it needs to
Diesel,3dlfvi,epicness350,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:03:05 2015 UTC,As long as you understand how to use it you are fine. Many diesel tractors and heavy equipment in the 60's and 70's came with ether injector buttons to aid in cold starting.

Diesel,3dbb6w,bammad33,5,Wed Jul 15 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"I was in the same situation you were in last year. I decided to look into a 7.3 for a few reasons.   In that price point, you can find a 2001-2002 7.3 with about the same mileage as a 6.0, but, you get the best of the crop in the 7.3's history imo.   You'll also be able to get 4x4 and all the fixins in that price point that you may not get in a 2003-2007.  The early 6.0s had reliability issues, everyone knows that. I wouldn't buy any truck that has heavy mods or lift kits. I feel that some owners with heavy mods tend to abuse their trucks, maybe not in maintenance but in heavy strain on the motor. I would feel safe buying a 6.0 in the 05-07 range with only the basic bulletproofing, nothing more, and certainly nothing less. Bulletproofing these motors usually runs into the 3-5k range, so if you're buying it to keep for awhile, you'll need to front those costs too.   I live in Chicago/East Lansing, Michigan, I bought a 2001 ECLB F250 4x2 for $9750 from a dealership with 6mo warranty and 110k on the clock. It took several months of looking and test driving until I felt good to make my final decision. Browse the forums, youtube, talk to mechanics, do as much research as you can and you'll eventually find a good truck.  Hopefully I didn't offend anyone lol  PM me if you have any questions.

Diesel,3dbb6w,901unknown,3,Wed Jul 15 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"No, wouldn't do it. Costs way too much to maintain and as a 16 y/o you'll be SOL if anything major happens to the truck.

Diesel,3dbb6w,mrchief177,2,Wed Jul 15 12:21:10 2015 UTC,"I bought my late 1999 7.3 with 175k for 10,500. 12k for a first car is a hell of a budget, my first car was a foxbody for 3,500.   Honestly, do you need a 3/4 ton+ diesel rig? Diesels are fun and all, but if you dont need the extra hauling capacity it may not be worth it. They kind of suck in the winter, around here diesel is more expensive than premium gas, fuel mileage isn't great, oil changes on a 7.3 are $70+, and when its breaks it really costs you.   For a first rig, with $800 a month income, id suggest against it.   I would suggest something much more practical than a diesel HD truck for a first rig. Get something that gets good mileage and can haul your friends around. Doesn't have to be something lame, a 5speed subaru wagon that can go wherever, an old toyota pickup, whatever. For where you are now, the more affordable the better."
Diesel,3dbb6w,Pharoah95,2,Wed Jul 15 07:01:26 2015 UTC,As a first car I would say it's probably not a great idea. Do you need a truck or do you just want a diesel?
Diesel,3dbb6w,mnfarmboy,2,Wed Jul 15 12:52:18 2015 UTC,"Unless you are towing or hauling >6k lbs regularly, there is no need for a 3/4 ton or larger truck. Stick with a 1/2 ton - better on gas, parts are cheaper, better turning radius, and much easier to work on. Any triton engine will last 300k miles and then some."

My laptop is 7 years old, on it's last legs, with no memory left and it can run hydraflash no problem. The program is super simple. I recommend reviving the laptop.   I mounted the chip right above the bottom of the dash, so I can't see any ribbon. I then mounted the data port under the steering column squeezed Inbetween the steering column and fuse panel cover. If you watch the PHP Hydra installation video on YouTube, I did it exactly like that, but the guy in the video mounted the selector about 4 inches above the bottom of the bezel, so you can see 4 inches of ribbon   The ribbon for the selector is pretty long and very thin, so If you are talking about pod gauges mounted on the A pillar, I think it will work."

The electrical work to my #2 cylinder was frayed which caused my truck to go in and out of limp mode. The fix was around 450 with the tow to the dealership but it's been fine ever since.
Diesel,3ctf0x,blades11b,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:05:39 2015 UTC,"A glow plug code won't ever cause a truck to go into limp mode. The wiring for the injectors on cylinders 2 and 7 had issues, and there's a re-work kit to address that issue. Wiggling the wiring on those injectors while the truck is running will give you a small idea if they're the issue or not. You need better data though, not once did you mention a code or any data parameters, which makes this all just guesswork. Another thing is all this efi live stuff and fuel rail shims, whatever those are.. I've seen a few trucks where the injection pump can't keep up with the volume of fuel it's being asked to supply by the tuner. The actual rail pressure falls below the desired, and the truck throws a code and enters limp mode. Customers always go off about how 'they read it on the Internet about how it shouldn't cause issues' and 'it's gotta be something else, I've never heard of this happening', and then I take their nonsense off, and the truck runs fine. It's not always about supplying the injection pump, sometimes it's more about how much fuel the injection pump is capable of flowing at the proper pressure.."

Diesel,3ctamr,fuckwhatisit,6,Fri Jul 10 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"I know many might disagree with me on this, but here is my philosophy on diesel performance.    If it's new enough to to still be under warranty, leave it the hell alone. It's not worth risking the OEM making you pay for repairs on a brand new vehicle because you want to go fast.  If you intend on driving the vehicle daily, focus on reliability long before you start adding power. For example, on a 12 valve Cummins, make sure the killer dowel pin is taken care of BEFORE you invest in a high end fuel pump. Make sure the transmission, especially an automatic, will be able to handle the power you are looking to add. Your truck will get you nowhere when it's dead on the side of the road, no matter how well it's tuned. If you decide to modify it anyway, spend the money to do it right. Don't buy cheap parts for the sake of instant gratification. Yeah, that set of brand new injectors will set you back more than some remans, and custom tuning will cost more than something straight from a box, but in the long run, you'll have less headaches, better performance, and risk less time in the shop.   So, to answer your question, unless you are prepared to not only buy the correct parts and pay the full price of repairs at the Chevy house, leave it alone and wait for that warranty to expire."
Diesel,3ctamr,NotTheClA,2,Fri Jul 10 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"well, since you asked:PPEI by Kory Willis  Known for tuning one of the fastest stock duramaxes may still the the fastest actually."
Diesel,3ctamr,SONAVABITCH,2,Fri Jul 10 23:28:47 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this guy. Kory has fantastic, fast and clean tunes. However, if you want better mileage and more power you can't have both with the dpf. In fact, you're not going to get better mileage with just tuning. But the cost of a transmission is wayyyyyyyyy more than what you are going to save on fuel. My truck needs a tranny now, but I knew that was going to happen when I started. Gotta pay to play."

Diesel,3co525,dubjah,5,Thu Jul 9 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"Here's a bunch of info I found on another site.  Looks like it was the EA288 2.0L 4cyl which is available in the U.S. spec Golf, Jetta, Passat, and Beetle.  I wonder about the long term reliability and carbon build up with the EGR system...  I bet even after this, people (fellow Americans) still won't take diesel seriously as an economical option over a hybrid!   ""The EA288 in the Golf is a 2.0-liter, four-cylinder turbocharged and direct-injection diesel engine, a thorough update from the powerplant in the previous Golf. Despite the similarity in basic specifications, the only aspect that carries over from the previous EA189 unit is the cylinder bore spacing. The new engine produces 150 hp—10 more than before—at 3,500 rpm, as well as 236 lb-ft (320 N·m) of torque at 1,750 rpm. The engine, when combined with the manual transmission, carries an EPA estimated rating of 30 mpg in the city and 45 mpg on the highway (combined 36 mpg/6.53 l/100 km), an improvement of 1 mpg in the city and 3 mpg on the highway over the previous EPA numbers. The compact EA288 engine has the intercooler for its turbocharger system integrated directly into the intake manifold, which serves a two-fold purpose of increasing throttle response and performance as well as helping lower emissions. The engine block is cast iron, with a forged steel crankshaft that runs in five main bearings and has four counterweights. In order to counteract engine vibration and maintain smooth operation, the EA288’s crankshaft is connected to two gear-driven counter-rotating balancer shafts that spin at twice engine speed. Friction has been reduced by about 15% in the engine, through the use of roller bearings for the drivetrain side camshaft, increased piston-to-wall clearance, and lower piston-ring tension, among other measures. The aluminum-alloy crossflow cylinder head has a number of unique features. First, the camshafts are integrated into a separate housing by a thermal joining process, ensuring a very rigid camshaft bearing while keeping the weight low. Second, each overhead camshaft operates one intake valve and one exhaust valve per cylinder (as opposed to one camshaft for intake valves only and one for exhaust), allowing for greater air delivery and swirl. The engine features variable cam phasing on the intake and exhaust valves. The EA288 Clean Diesel TDI engine places strong emphasis on thermal management, which is evident in the cylinder head’s two-section coolant jacket, as well as a three-part cooling circuit and switchable coolant pump. Compared to the previous engine, emissions are reduced by up to 40%, helped by siting the exhaust after-treatment module close to the engine and by the use of a low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation system."""

It can touch 40MPG in easy highway driving (returns 32-36mpg at 80+), but also has 425lb/ft torque and is a blast to drive. Remind me again why diesels aren't popular?"
Diesel,3co525,theographics,4,Thu Jul 9 21:32:05 2015 UTC,"Well from the Mercedes side there are a few reasons why diesels are not popular within that brand in the USA:  The 2006 and later 350/320 CDIs/Bluetecs used the OM642 engine.  Like most diesel engines in the states, they were severely detuned versus their European counterparts--after all, your US-spec 335d is really a European 330d.  For the OM642 when it came out in the states it had 190/210hp versus 240/260hp in Europe.  The reliability of the OM642 is horrendous.  Though the engine can run for half a million miles, the lack of gaskets and Mercedes' frugality with sealants mean that these engines are notorious oil leakers.  Oh, the roller bearings in 2011-2013 Mercedes are also wearing out prematurely, causing horrible timing chain slap.  Not only does the OM642 have expensive problems, but it is difficult and costly to maintain.  Air filters are not very easily accessible, fuel filter is inside the V of the engine (and on later models comes with a unremovable sensor), no one produces the correct spec oil except for Mobil 1 M ESP, and turbo seals leak condensed oil vapors all the time.  TL;DR, cheaper to run a modern gas Merc even if gas was twice as expensive."
Diesel,3co525,shockage,2,Thu Jul 9 22:54:48 2015 UTC,81 mpg US gallons = 97 Imperial gallons  81 mpg US gallons = 2.9 liters/100km  I'm preaching to the converted here in this subreddit but it needs to be said for new readers here modern diesel engines are practically odourless even driving behind a diesel vehicle.  Diesel engines rev lower especially nice in a small engine like a four-cylinder since you don't have to rev the life out of it to get torque it's all low down another advantage with a small engine.

Diesel,3c22gz,ComicalDouchebag,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:16:27 2015 UTC,In addition to that. The methanol can spike combustion pressures which increases stress on the engine far more than it increases power.
Diesel,3c22gz,Kiwibaconator,0,Sat Jul 4 02:22:34 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. If the mixture is kept below 40:60 Methanol/Water and the injection quantity is not excessive for the air mass flow, there is no risk of pressure spike."
Diesel,3c22gz,ThatBusGuy,0,Tue Jul 7 12:29:00 2015 UTC,The pressure spike is how it works.   No pressure spike means no power gain.
Diesel,3c22gz,Kiwibaconator,0,Tue Jul 7 19:34:19 2015 UTC,Incorrect. Pressure spike means detonation. A pressure rise means combustion.
Diesel,3c22gz,ThatBusGuy,2,Tue Jul 7 22:51:24 2015 UTC,The speed of methanol combusting is far faster than diesel.  Hence the spike in combustion pressure.   It doesn't require detonation but you will get that as well if you overdose.
Diesel,3c22gz,Kiwibaconator,0,Wed Jul 8 03:32:18 2015 UTC,if you overdose.    Thank you for proving the point I made 3 replies ago.
Diesel,3c22gz,ThatBusGuy,-1,Wed Jul 8 11:49:22 2015 UTC,"W/M hasn't been ""tested in highway trucks"" because they cannot maintain the system. There is no infrastructure to supply W/M fluid on the large consumption scale trucks require. Even urea injection took a few years to become accommodated at most truck stop pumps.    A truck with a 15L engine would have approximately 5-20gph consumption depending on engine load. To last even one fuel fill worth would require at least a 20 gallon tank, which is 160lbs off their payload too.    Just because OTR trucks do not / can not do it doesn't mean it isn't viable to other classes of vehicles."
Diesel,3c22gz,ThatBusGuy,0,Tue Jul 7 12:53:07 2015 UTC,"W/M is fantastic. I have run it for years with zero issues.    If you're wanting increased MPG, just stop now. You cannot defeat physics. Any change in MPG will come from burning the methanol in place of diesel. The exact same holds true with LPG and CNG systems.    The benefits of W/M injection are; 1: Keeping the engine free of carbon. Anyone who has done a head gasket job on an engine run while burning coolant has seen how well water steam cleans the piston and rings. This is especially important on engines with a working EGR.    2: More power! On vehicles like my Mercedes where natural power is limited by maximum fuel injection quantity available, the methanol adds significant power. However, if your fuel system has the overhead to make more power on fuel alone, do that instead.    3: Cooling the charge air. If your intake air temperatures ever go above 180f then you could benefit from W/M injection cooling the air to increase mass density. However, a better intercooler or more efficient turbo setup would be more cost effective in the long run and return actual gains in fuel economy."

Diesel,3bgchf,Devious17,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"They are comparable to a 1st gen stock Cummins power wise.  Mine will haul an 11k trailer up the pass at 45-50 mph. If you do a few mods like the feed the beast mod so to replace the tiny fuel line to the injection pump, new exhaust and even an intercooler they get the job done.    My brother sold me on trying one since he wrenched on them in the marines.    Don't get me wrong.  My other Chev dually has a 12 valve Cummins with a 5 speed for the heavy work.  I would rather have that truck in a heart beat.  Cost is the big factor.  I've got 25k into the chev/Cummins conversion vs 6.5k into the Detroit including parts and upgrades.

With the half ton I would watch how much power your using to plow, we had a customer last winter blow a transfer case up."

Diesel,3bh2z8,weeder57,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:43:53 2015 UTC,What is a good modern truck that can plow?
Diesel,3bh2z8,I_CUM_BACON,3,Mon Jun 29 04:58:23 2015 UTC,"Superdutys and dodges, The fords are a pain in the ass to wire sometimes, even if they come with the plow prep package. The dodges are easy to install. Both the fords and dodges are good modern trucks, anything with a straight axle."

Diesel,3bgz9p,epicness350,2,Mon Jun 29 03:31:01 2015 UTC,"Injectors and HPOP are 2 things that come to mind  Mods? Straight pipe, intake, reputable tuner(make sure to install gauges with tuner) for an auto truck. That is about all a stock auto can handle."
Diesel,3bgz9p,jgollsneid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:17:59 2015 UTC,"At 300K I would also keep a close eye out for parts like ball joints, shocks, steering components, (especially the steering box, they start to wear out around 250-300K), and general upkeep. Make sure to keep up with the fluids that sometimes get neglected (transfer case, front and rear axle lube, power steering fluid, and brake fluid)"

Diesel,3bgz9p,DaMonsterMonster,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:18:39 2015 UTC,From what I have heard the downpipe is a good thing to upgrade.

Diesel,3bgz9p,fieldgypsy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"I'll second the 6637 filter.   Love it.   If you live in a colder area,  there are upgraded glow plug relays that can be installed.   As soon as I did that,  I relocated to So Cal for work.   Figures."
