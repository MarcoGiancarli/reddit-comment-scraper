In return he sent a basket of parched gram (bhonay channay) with the message: “We can live and fight with these ‘channay’ all the year round”. The message was loud and clear. Ahmed Shah decided to retire to Kabul and the three Sikh rulers returned.""  This all could make for a very cool film one day!  Also...lots of props to Dawn for publishing a lot of articles about general Sikh heritage from Pakistan. I may be wrong, but I'm getting the sense that among Pakistan's elites there is a movement towards greater appreciation of the state's rich non-Islamic past. The Pakistan government even started repairs on the Sun Temple in Multan!"

Sikh,3e2sxd,latinosingh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:57 2015 UTC,"I would love if the government made more of an effort to preserve Punjabi in Pakistan; right now it doesn't have much of a high status and is alive among the common folk but looked down upon by elites. And yeah, most Sikhs are envious of Pakistani Punjabi speakers too (it's almost a matter of bragging rights to say that some of your family was from Pakistan and you speak ""Pakistani Punjabi"" with them).   There actually is a serial on the events of the misl period and Maharaja Ranjit Singh. I actually feel like the costumes and sets are 100% on point, and the actors look pretty natural as well. The history they show is super accurate and comprehensive as well. I just feel like a lot is lost through the Indian serial medium, and the Hindi while in certain places (the Mughal Emperor's court) makes sense just doesn't feel right for most of the settings within Punjab. Regardless of what one may think of the politics behind it, Punjab 1984 was a really high quality film that I'd argue was at Hollywood standards, and I'd love for these types of stories and this time period to be represented again in that format.  Sorry, probably went a bit too much and more than you were expecting..."

HSV-1 is ridiculously easy to spread so I respect you for taking measures to minimize that risk. Sikh community is very diverse and many of us are well educated so its not impossible for you to find someone accepting of your condition. I'm sure you're not the only one either so don't think you're alone in the struggle. If you look in the right places, you'll find someone who's willing to look past the inconvenience. I know its an awkward conversation in any setting but I'd recommend you be open and honest about it with your family and friends so the ones who truly care can help you on your journey. Your circle of loved ones might shrink initially but quality > quantity. Focus on your life goals, work hard to be successful, and make sure the good outweighs the bad. If you're in a college/university, then reach out to your friends and fellow Sikhs/students for support.   You will undoubtedly encounter ignorance but look past those idiots and know that they're not worth your time/attention anyways. I might get some hate for being cold and blunt but with what 70% of Punjabi youth addicted to drugs and people marrying alcoholics and crack-addicts out of desperation, someone like you actually sounds like a pretty good alternative. At least you have your problem under control. You catching that infection wasn't your fault so you don't owe anyone any apologies, be proud of yourself, and remember that confidence is infectious too. If you know you can control it and prevent it from impacting your daily life then others will be more accepting of you."
Sikh,3dt7ee,Aj5abi,6,Sun Jul 19 07:54:47 2015 UTC,"HSV-1 is present in more than 90% of the population. Odds are good that 9/10 women you are interested in already carry it, since almost everyone does. Most people contract it as babies or children, by getting kisses from adults who have it. It's nothing to worry about or be ashamed of."
Sikh,3dt7ee,heartspackle,3,Sun Jul 19 13:54:41 2015 UTC,"You would be surprised at how many people have HSV 1. It's HSV 2 that's spread through sexual contact. HSV 1 can be spread by sharing objects or even touching the infected person's skin (even if no sores are present). If you haven't had an outbreak in years, I wouldn't worry about it.   Honestly, this shouldn't be pose any sort of problem when it comes to relationships. Of course there will be people who would be wary, but that's par for the course. Most people wouldn't see this as big enough a problem to stop them from being with you."
Sikh,3dt7ee,Royallyscrew-ed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:12:35 2015 UTC,how many people have HSV 1. It's HSV 2 that's spread through sexual contact.   HSV1 is primarily spread through kissing; however it is also spread through sexual contact.
Sikh,3dt7ee,givoly,3,Sun Jul 19 12:32:17 2015 UTC,"""Still unaware of how I got it as neither of my parents had it nor did I have any sexual encounters""    Yes, definitely, but I was referring to this. I should have phrased it differently. HSV 1 is not spread through sexual contact alone. And since OP didn't have any sexual encounter at that age and is not sure how he got infected, I'm assuming he probably got infected through the sharing of personal items or through physical touch etc."
Sikh,3dt7ee,Royallyscrew-ed,2,Sun Jul 19 12:46:32 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with Aj5abi, you are far from hopeless!   First, I want to say that the fact that you are reaching out is enough proof that you are a responsible guy and that is commendable. Second, unfortunately in our communities there isn't enough talk around health and reproduction. The fact is that as an American I am likely to get it by the age of 50 and almost certain to get it by the age 85. Its that ubiquitous. I posted a link below but the short story: 90% of Americans have it by the age of 50. I repeat, 90%. That is why the synonym ""cold sore"" is used all over the place; because no American wants to say they have HSV-1 but cold sores is socially acceptable to use. This definitely shouldn't stop you from dating or marrying at all.    Also, correct me if I am wrong but I believe that you can infect others only when there is an outbreak, correct? If that assumption is correct, than this is something that can be controlled, responsibly. Wishing the best of luck, even though I am sure you don't need it.    http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/oral_health/mouth_infections_85,P00888/"

Sikh,3dqp5d,asdfioho,3,Sat Jul 18 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"What's cool about the song is the tune is actually directly used from the Punjabi folk song ""Jagga Jatt."" ""Jagga jamiya te Milan vadaiya...Jagga jamiya.""   I'm an advocate of keeping Gurmat Sangeet in its pure form of Raag Kirtan (which also has some folk tunes btw) with Guru ki saaj as done by the Gurus. But music itself is a powerful venue outside of kirtan for people to connect to Sikhi, a part of parchar if you will."
Sikh,3dqp5d,Singh_Q6,2,Sat Jul 18 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"I thought I recognised the tune, pretty cool connection.  This is probably going to be the modern form of Dhaddi Vaaran, I don't know if Dhaddi Vaaran are going to survive, especially in the west.  Sikh history is pretty much passed down through folk songs, so this will probably be how we remember our history, almost a mixture of Bhangra, western music and Kavishari."
Sikh,3dqp5d,ishabad,3,Sat Jul 18 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"I think Dhadi Varan can definitely survive, most Punjabi folk tunes and many songs are actually derived from Dhadi musical techniques. I think though that the tradition of ""live"" Dhadi vaars will be very niche ultimately and that they need to start producing albums accessible to people via the Internet, and perhaps add some modern production techniques.  Our panth is also becoming global increasingly, and many members speak English as their first language. I see nothing wrong with adopting to that demographic--in fact, I think it has the potential to be inspiring  Sikh culture never really was a fan of paintings (most ancient art of the Sikh Gurus was drawn by Hindus for example), and I don't think many of us would be all too much ready for mass media of our history at large either (movies for Khalsa history would be fine but surrounding Gurus would be problematic, like Nanak Shah Fakir). We do have this venue of music though, and we should pursue it!!"

Sikh,3dnlhp,Singh_Q6,2,Fri Jul 17 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"This realm is called saram khand, the realm of effort and hardwork. The word ghariai means to shape or sharpen something. It seems as if a deeper connection with the creative force is being made.  The mind has been illuminated with knowledge. The mind is now shaped, to allow us to walk the path of Hukam.  My interpretation of this pauri is that the mind is becoming purified. It seems as if this fire of knowledge and dharam is removing the haumai from within. We reach a state of consciousness which is beautiful, something that is closer to the state of Waheguru."
Sikh,3dnlhp,latinosingh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:25 2015 UTC,"""The descriptions of that realm (the realm of effort) cannot be expressed. If someone tries to speak and describe it, they shall regret the attempt.""   It seems to me that this Pauri has an underlying dialogue of the importance and celebration of the individual. Though the description of the 5 realms may act as a guideline for the spiritual path towards Waheguru it is for the individual, and not for others, to dictate what their interpretation and actions will be. These two lines here support the individual and, to me, celebrate the individual. I wonder if this is in relation to the letting go of Maya; I'll have to go through the Pauris later on to develop that thought further.  ""There (in saram khand) the workpiece (the mind and self) being fashioned is incomparably beautiful.""   The overall message, to me, of this Pauri is the significance of the interplay between effort and knowledge. As has been noted in a previous Pauri, there might be meaning behind the fact that these Pauris begin with one realm and slowly meld into another.   I think that though this line could be read as ""the mind and self"" being beautiful it may also be that the effort, the motions of the work itself that is being performed, is beautiful. In other words, sheer will to continue on this path is beautiful; it is after all a ""workpiece"" and not a finished product. Maybe there isn't a ""finished product"" to even attain but the perpetual effort and knowledge gained through it is what we are suppose to be seeking at this interplay between realms."

Sikh,3dbou8,asdfioho,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:16:53 2015 UTC,Honestly I think /u/asdfioho gave a better answer than this quite closed one.
Sikh,3dbou8,DrunkenSikh,11,Wed Jul 15 11:25:40 2015 UTC,"Technically, Singh101 is correct. I think it's important to note that Waheguru is a bit different than other concepts of God; Its/His/Her concept is still debated among Sikhs today, and it can be viewed as very personal almost akin to the Abrahamic God and almost as detached as the Buddhist atheist view. Most people who say they used to be Sikh but are atheist generally believed in the more personal God and completely shorn it.   But on the other hand, you can look at the example of Khushwant Singh: an avid Sikh historian who strongly believed in Sikh identity (kept a beard and turban himself and is still described with ire by RSS historians who deride his belief in a Sikhi separate from Hinduism), looked to the Gurus as important social reformers, yet was a staunch atheist. He's perhaps a bit of the more controversial ones, but I think the point stands that one can participate in Sikh identity, codes of conduct, rituals, and even the moral philosophy without believing in Waheguru. This is because such rituals are segregated from spirituality. For example, we don't keep our hair uncut to ""please God,"" we do it as part of non-conformity to societal norms and standing up to authority. Even ideas like langar or selfless service can be linked to the idea of Sarbat da bhalla, the idea of helping all humanity, without necessarily connecting it to the idea of God. I'm pretty sure that there are a lot of people like this.   Personally, I am a very strong believer in Sikh spirituality, but my views on God are probably closer to a conventional atheist than what you may think of as a ""believer."" I think Waheguru may be a state of mind, a deeper connection to the larger universe, more-so than a specific creator or such."
Sikh,3dbou8,Aj5abi,5,Wed Jul 15 02:58:46 2015 UTC,"looked to the Gurus as important social reformers, yet was a staunch atheist   This is not a contradiction because Sikhi doesn't consider the Gurus to be mere social reformers. Their bani is considered to be the path to mukti, and they themselves were the epitome of liberation. Being a social reformer was just an artifact of their underlying mission according to their own bani, and the vars of the early Sikhs.   Waheguru is considered to be panentheistic but is described with a general set of parameters (Nirbhao Nirvair occur in the mool mantar itself). The practice of Sikhi is quite agnostic because Waheguru is beparwah and has no needs from humanity. But the belief in Sikhi (of the divine chain established by the Gurus through some explicit Hukam of Waheguru) is certainly not agnostic or atheistic."
Sikh,3dbou8,asdfioho,2,Wed Jul 15 04:10:53 2015 UTC,"Khushwant Singh is a horrible example because I believe him to be an opportunist who, like many other before him, prophesied that Sikhi will die out in his lifetime and so abused its identity to actively contribute to its perceived demise. He predicted Sikhi would cease to exist before the turn of the millennium and then devoted his remaining years to Santa-Banta jokes. Fuck that douche. He wasn't an atheist; he was an anti-theist and a dishonest one at that."
Sikh,3dbou8,timeandaplace117,5,Wed Jul 15 08:53:16 2015 UTC,"So I know we had this discussion before, but what changed my mind was reading a lot of RSS and Hindutva writers and what they had to say about Sikhi and Sikh identity. Of course they had the routine arguments about Sikhi being a part of Hinduism. That's what I thought K. Singh also said. However, one thing was they all heavily lambasted K. Singh for being an ""intellectually dishonest historian,"" and whatnot because of his staunch belief in one thing: independent Sikh identity. I went back to his writings and found that they were quoted completely out of context.   For example, his controversial ""Sikhi will die out"" comment was cited by Hindutva scholars like Koenraad Elst. The full context. He was referring to an argument also made by Sikh scholar Macauliffe (the Hinduism-boa constrictor one) and said that if Sikhs didn't retain their physical identity, it would die out and relapse into Hinduism.   He also said at one point that all the Gurus were Hindu. The full quote was actually about how they would be Hindu until they fully converted to their own religious identity known as Sikhi. I can provide the full essay if you want.  This changed my idea on the man a lot. Obviously I disagree with him on some points-Santa Banta for example as he believed we should be able to laugh at ourselves. But what's admirable is him being a scholar supporting Sikh identity in a time in India's history where it was extremely marginalized. Discrediting him for Santa Banta is tricky and a matter of opinion. Some people would say that promoting Sikhs in the military destroys our image, so to them are those of us who do support military opportunists? Some Sikhs watch jokester films like Singh is King, are they opportunists? Obviously we can disagree with them but we have to look at the whole timescale. And I think Khushwant Singh, while holding tenuous opinions at time (Santa Banta, saying meditation was all hogwash, supporting Indira), definitely has to be credited with what he added to Sikh literature and how he did fight for Sikh symbols and Sikh identity even when he had this mass of RSS ""scholars"" biting at his feet."

Sikh,3dblt2,Aj5abi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:43:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean. Should it be listened to without any attention being payed to the holy words' meanings themselves or just for the tune? No. Should they be listened to only for pleasure of the ear? I dont think so. I feel that they should be listened ro only if one is seeking to understand, evaluate, and apply the words in their own life. Anything else would devalue them to common lyrics."
Sikh,3dblt2,Singh101,7,Wed Jul 15 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"while knowing the meanings is advantageous to your learning and experience, naad (sound current) is still a powerful thing, even without knowing the full meaning of the shabad. i listen to kirtan all the time without understanding the exact meaning of the whole shabad, just gist of the ""hook"". i also sometimes have kirtan on in the background when i focus on other tasks.. not exactly actively listening, but still okay (if not good).   i would, however, caution against singing along to what you think are the words. its important to be attempt to be as accurate as possible to the guru's word, not just faking it and singing gobbledygook.   otherwise, enjoy! let the vibes flow over/through you :)"
Sikh,3dblt2,karan_kavan_abol,2,Wed Jul 15 03:32:47 2015 UTC,"But the main point of bani is to teach and instruct the mind. Thats the main point.  I agree with you, it is good to listen to kirtan, even if you don't fully understand it. There is powerful thing about bani, even without understanding it.  Surely it is disrespectful to ignore the whole point of bani, to change the mindset and instruct you to see life in a different way. The whole point of bani is to instruct you, it is the Guru. If you ignore its instruction, carry on living the way your mind wants to, then whats the point of listening to bani?  I think we would all agree, we will only learn something if we understand the words.  ਲੋਗੁ ਜਾਨੈ ਇਹੁ ਗੀਤੁ ਹੈ ਇਹੁ ਤਉ ਬ੍ਰਹਮ ਬੀਚਾਰ ॥  lōg jānai ih gīt hai ih tau braham bīchār .  People believe that this is just a song, but this is a contemplation, a discussion on the Ultimate Reality.  ਜਿਉ ਕਾਸੀ ਉਪਦੇਸੁ ਹੋਇ ਮਾਨਸ ਮਰਤੀ ਬਾਰ ॥੩॥  jiu kāsī upadēs hōi mānas maratī bār .3.  It is just like the instructions given to the dying man at Kashi (Benaras, the Hindu holy city, if you died there you were liberated, just like listening and understanding bani you are liberated). ||3||  ਕੋਈ ਗਾਵੈ ਕੋ ਸੁਣੈ ਹਰਿ ਨਾਮਾ ਚਿਤੁ ਲਾਇ ॥  kōī gāvai kō sunai har nāmā chit lāi .  Someone sings, some listen, they attach Wahegurus Naam to their conscience.  ਕਹੁ ਕਬੀਰ ਸੰਸਾ ਨਹੀ ਅੰਤਿ ਪਰਮ ਗਤਿ ਪਾਇ ॥੪॥੧॥੪॥੫੫॥  kah kabīr sansā nahī ant param gat pāi .4.1.4.55.  says Kabeer, without a doubt, in the end, they obtain the highest status. ||4||1||4||55||  If you don't listen to the instruction, how can you be liberated?  Bani is not just a song with a nice beat. Music and enjoying the bani is a big part of Sikhi, but the most important thing is to understand the words.  Also, this goes for Sikhs and non-Sikhs, listening to bani while engaging in behaviour it warns against. Drinking alcohol, smoking, engaging in the 5 thieves, doing idol worship, ignoring the Guru's advice. I would say doing things the Guru warns against is disrespectful.  But anyone can listen to kirtan, it is good to just listen, but ultimately you must try to understand and implement the message of bani."
Sikh,3dblt2,Singh_Q6,3,Wed Jul 15 09:58:37 2015 UTC,"While I ultimately agree with you, I think it's important that for many people they find the music as a hook to gain deeper understanding. Obviously you don't want to just blast bani in your car while partying and whatnot, but recently I've found that it's very powerful to just meditate on the musical aspect while aspiring for deeper meaning alongside the shabad's meaning when you get access to that."
Sikh,3dblt2,asdfioho,2,Wed Jul 15 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats cool, I find that the musical aspects, the rhymes, the flow of the poetry, the words of bani accompanied with music, is a very powerful thing. The musical aspect of SGGS is very important.  I'm not saying that its a bad thing to just listen to kirtan and enjoy the flow of the words and the music, the Gurus used poetry and song for a reason.  But like SGGS says, ultimately, we must always remember that what we are listening to is much more than a simple song or a nice beat.  I was trying to emphasise the fact that the most important reason to listen to kirtan is to understand it and to implement it into your life. I think for people who are new to Sikhi or listening to kirtan for the first time, we need to remind them its not just a casual thing or something to simply listen to, these are words that contain wisdom we should pay attention to."

Sikh,3d70uq,Aj5abi,3,Tue Jul 14 06:48:35 2015 UTC,I'm from Surrey and it is one of the nicest gurdwaras I've ever seen.
Sikh,3d70uq,kidha,2,Tue Jul 14 12:28:48 2015 UTC,Yeah El Sobrante is definitly nice! The only thing is the last time I went almost all of their parking was on a hill :/
Sikh,3d70uq,bayareasikh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:15:38 2015 UTC,Yeah if you go on a Sunday or a Wednesday then you need to get there early for an easy parking. I've seen people's cars roll over the curb more than once because they don't know how to park or back out of a parking on a hill

Sikh,3d5tjx,karan_kavan_abol,2,Mon Jul 13 19:25:30 2015 UTC,"an absolutely incredible read, a real page turner and very well written to boot."
Sikh,3d5tjx,asdfioho,2,Tue Jul 14 02:46:33 2015 UTC,"admittedly, I'm not all that much of a fan of some of the methods used for the harsh retributive justice at times leveraged by Labh Singh or other militants. For example, to punish Baljit Kaur and Surinder Shinda, the killers of Sodhi, were cut into pieces--I think that's way too much, and I don't think that kind of explicit torture should be part of any Sikhs' idea of justice [although it's been there since Banda Bahadur's execution of Sucha Nand by attaching his noose to a horse]. But I think there's a genuine narrative here that's too often ignored in the ""Pakistani agents had infiltrated the golden temple and had to be exterminated to protect India's integrity."" Even today you see the mentality in Punjab, where people feel the democratic process is so corrupted that it doesn't do anything for them and idealize Singh's who go around helping (see Sardar by Sippy Gill), and that was particularly exasperated by the central government's policy plays in Punjab back then."
Sikh,3d4qws,SkepticSikh,3,Mon Jul 13 14:47:11 2015 UTC,"I've raised this point often in this sub, as I do agree w ur interpretation   EDIT: that said I agree with /u/aj5abi in that while the ceremony was maybe not intended as such and while we may disagree with some of the technicalities, it's still for the better that it exists for purposes of maintaining the Sikh identity"
Sikh,3d4qws,asdfioho,3,Mon Jul 13 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"This protest won't gain much traction unless you also provide a better alternative...  The original Sikh wedding ceremony may have been lost in time but I don't believe it was much different than the one performed nowadays. I've heard it was done during Amrit vela and I'm guessing it would make more sense for the bride and the groom to recite the laavan shabads themselves instead of a Kirtani jatha.  Yeah the Anand Karaj is about realizing and merging with Waheguru but if we stretch our imaginations a bit, can it not be applied to a marriage as well..Waheguru is everything, including the person you are to marry and accepting that human being as a part of oneself and understanding that the Guru made this union possible, you realize peace and rejoice in bliss. You become that one light in two bodies and take a significant step towards merging with Waheguru as you merge with your husband/wife to become one."
Sikh,3d4qws,Aj5abi,2,Tue Jul 14 06:44:01 2015 UTC,"The way Sikhs used to get married was lost in time due to the British. It was the nirankari and namdhari movements that 'rediscovered' it and then the singh sabha movement critiqued it then changed it in line of Sikhi. We honestly don't know how it's suppose to be done, but this is the only thing we have for marriage, and then you have the added ritualistic stuff people do..."
Sikh,3d5hxw,Singh_Q6,3,Mon Jul 13 18:04:57 2015 UTC,"This pauri is a continuation of the discussion by Guru Nanak Dev Ji on the 5 khands (realms). The previous pauri discussed Dharam Khand, now Japji Sahib moves on to Gyaan Khand (the realm of knowledge).  Look at the way the pauris have been written.  Guru Nanak Dev Ji has not broken the pauris up into separate, distinct discussions. Rather, he makes them flow together. The first line of this pauri is a continuation of the previous pauri. This is a reminder that knowledge and action go together, they are not separate things. One without the other is useless.  The awakening of knowledge, from all sources, reveals the vastness of creation. It shows us how small we really are, a small speck in a vast ocean. It shows us the limits of our understanding. This is a step in destroying our ego, our sense of importance.  ਗਿਆਨ ਖੰਡ ਮਹਿ ਗਿਆਨੁ ਪਰਚੰਡੁ ॥  giān khand mah giān parachand .  In the realm of Gyaan (knowledge), the light of knowledge blazes forth.  This light of knowledge shines a light into our inner being, showing us we are just one part of the cosmos.  As a Sikh begins to focus on Dharam, their duty and role, they begin to lose selfishness. No longer do they look to themselves as the centre of the Universe (there are Endless Meru Mountains). As more knowledge is acquired, the Sikh begins to understand that they are just one drop in the ocean. That there is so much out there and that they are part of a wider family."
Sikh,3d5hxw,asdfioho,2,Mon Jul 13 18:29:16 2015 UTC,"Man, I was having a Jap Ji discussion with my father and he told me something really deep on the 5 realms that I now forget...I'll update this comment when I ask again.  I think these are spiritual concepts worth mentioning. Often, ""Kirat Karo, naam japo, and wand chako"" are considered the 'pillars' of Sikhi, but I think those actions basically relate to these 5 spiritual core concepts. I think Dharamkhand is part of righteousness, as defined in Sikhi as basic morality and being a good person. It's not the only thing necessary for enlightenment, but it's a part. The next is having knowledge and being intellectually curious. It's not the only part, and on its own its useless, but it's a ncessary step nonetheless."
Sikh,3d4t9q,Jarlid21,2,Mon Jul 13 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"What do I do with my hair if it is too short to put in a joora but to messy to style?   I know exactly what you mean. Even today my hair is not long enough to be in a stable joora on top of my head has it just opens up. I have better success with the joora behind my head with some rubber bands.   My ""pakta"" is essentially a doorag with my joora at the back of the head (although without the rubberbands). It invariably opens up as I am tying the patka, but that is fine, as I don't feel a pull on the hair under the patka.   When I tie a pagh, I bring my hair forward and tie it into a loose, temporary joora. It also opens up as I tie the pagh, but that too is fine as the top remains flat and I don't feel a pull on the hair."
Sikh,3d4t9q,DrunkenSikh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:26:39 2015 UTC,"Just curious, how long is your hair and how long have you been growing it?"
Sikh,3d4t9q,asdfioho,2,Mon Jul 13 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"I started growing it at age 14 and started properly covering it and tying a pagh at age 16. Currently 18.  Interesting thought process, though. For me, I too was spurred to do so by reading about Sikhi, and my Sikh school in particular inspired me to do so. However, I always thought of it less as ""I'm going to stop making excuses,"" and more of ""I'm going to take this step forward in expressing my Sikh identity."" I think a problem is that people assume the Sikh identity of turban and beard is a default that people are born into but later shorn. But are we born Sikhs? Or do we learn about it and slowly take steps towards becoming that Khalsa ideal? I see it as the second approach.   Secondly, I haven't changed that much spiritually after keeping my hair. Honest truth. I've admittedly become more interested in Sikhi now that I'm an embassy for it and such, but my devotion is the same. My dad was very religious before he kept his hair, doing paath everyday and such, and he's the same. The one thing that changes for me is that I'm conscious I'm wearing the Khalsa uniform. It's given me a much-needed self confidence boost and also a reminder of my own self dignity and sovereignty. For example, I assumed that with my hair I would stop being social and become more reclusive and spiritual. The opposite happened: since I became more confident, I actually gained friends.   The truth is man, if you really wanna drink now, you're going to want to drink with your hair. Hence why many sardars drink. Hell, some users here have previously boasted about how trimming helped them score more in the bedroom. I do have know sardars that drink, and in all honesty, I see it as a step of the process. They acknowledge it's technically against the Rehit they would follow as full Khalsa, and so they're honest about their intentions. They still have respect for the identity and try to imbibe it's values. One thing they all agree on though is seeing Sardars just completely fucked up, with their hair coming out of their pagh and acting wild and such is just kind of way too much and completely undermines the crown you have on your head. Same thing, some sardars probably can't control their lust and may sleep around while acknowledging its wrong--unfortunate, but since they're honest, they're on a path to fix it. However, I feel that having way too much sex, ogling girls (or guys, idk how it works out for Sikh women honestly), and most certainly sexual harassment is going to reflect poorly on your identity and the image for that crown.   I don't know what that leaves you personally at, but my ultimate advice: see for yourself! To me, the ability to look into a mirror, be happy with what I see and be enthusiastic for the opportunity to be an ambassador for that Khalsa ideal [even though I still have personal flaws to work out] is worth the world. Every day, it's empowering to know that it's out of choice and not obligation. Feel free to PM me with any further questions/discussion.  For actually growing it out, it took a couple steps for me. I naturally have an Afro, so I grew that our first... Started wearing the basic rumaal/bandana on top of that...then i decided it was way too curly to handle this way so I get a permanent hair straightening (really sucked but worked as advertised)...then a ponytail...then I started tying a pagh, and for everyday usage I would just do a bandana with my ponytail tucked into the top....and now what I do is a joorha in the back of my head and tie an actual patka like that (looks like Manni Sandhu). Honestly don't do the top joorha, it looks strange for older kids and its much harder to maintain if you've cut your hair all your life than a joorha in the back."

I just realized that to obtain a lifetime of peace and happiness, I got a give up a temporary moment of all this kaljug and bullshit. Thanks so much man, and I think that's what I will do, the pony tail at the back with a rumaal."
Sikh,3d4t9q,asdfioho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:22:25 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how are you doing the joora?  Do you do it roughly in the center of the head?  Because that seems like it would make a lump when you tie the patka. Or do you do it lower and let the ""tail"" cover it?"
Sikh,3d4t9q,noruh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, there's a lump in the back. Well less of a lump so much as it makes it look like my head is extended in a way, if that makes sense."
Sikh,3cy2de,m_wade,3,Sat Jul 11 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"not entirely sure what your question is, but i don't know if individualism is a religious question. the value of an individual is derived from the fact that each is a conscious, sentient being with their own experience of the world around them - thoughts, emotions, opinions, etc. in sikhism, each individual's relationship with waheguru is a unique, personal experience. sikhi is essentially the quest for ""unity"" or ""oneness"" within oneself (the individual).  hope that kind of answers your question :)"
Sikh,3cy2de,karan_kavan_abol,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:14:42 2015 UTC,"There is an important line in the Japji Sahib that we will cover in a few weeks:   ਕਰਮੀ ਆਪੋ ਆਪਣੀ ਕੇ ਨੇੜੈ ਕੇ ਦੂਰਿ ॥  According to their own actions, some are drawn closer, and some are driven farther away (from the spiritual union with Waheguru).  Salok, Japji Sahib.    Similarly, being in line with the Hukam is an individual task. When the Guru Granth Sahib talks about Sangat, it is to help us as individuals on this journey.   Sikhi starts in your mann. It formalizes your own mind's journey to Waheguru and helps the individual interpret the nadars of Waheguru."
Sikh,3cw2ry,pickledpie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:50:27 2015 UTC,"Fantastic post, great to see an expression of such deep thought.   What is Sikhism? How is it's enumeration of truth manifested in the world and our way in it? How can we bridge the divide and allow the radiance of our Guru to spread light into this world? How do we produce the best soil to take the seed?   I'd say, firstly, by asking these questions, lol. I think its really about sharing the light of Gurbani through education. The wider community, even our own, is unaware of what Sikhi is really about, and most can give a much better overview of the teachings of Christianity and Islam. We need to first educate our own community on Gurbani and its meaning and then make this education and information accessible to the wider community too.  We also need to lead by example and serve Waheguru. Those of us who have found our path in Sikhi must now follow it; doing sewa - as much as possible, standing up for the oppressed and following the Guru's hukam and it will inspire others.  There's obviously so much more and, as improvement is never-ending, we could discuss this topic forever, and we kinda should...."

Sikh,3cprbg,Singh_Q6,3,Thu Jul 9 20:08:00 2015 UTC,"Here's a downer to the story. Remember the whole fiasco with Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa? How some people who gave him heaps of support started flinging nasty things towards him after he admitted he couldn't go further? The panth back then wasn't immune to that either.   Bhai Mani Singh had done a lot of work in Sikh literature, namely composing writings of Sikh history (authenticated or not) and compiling them together (Dasam Granth for one), and as a part of the process he worked a lot with Sikh texts. One thing he did was start ""gutkas."" If you read Jap Ji or any other paath from a small book instead of the entire GGS, that's what a gutka is. It's done out of convenience. Well, this caused a controversy among the panth at the time. And probably for good reason! This was changing the GGS in a form, manipulating with it in some way. Personally, I'm fine with gutkas and support them, but it's good that we have healthy debate. Some members of the panth at the time had said something along the lines of, ""Mani Singh deserved it; he was cut from joint to joint just like how he cut up GGS."" I think the recent generations aren't really aware of this, but it was told among people for a long time.   How terrible :/ Even if you don't agree with what he did in this case, that's an awful predicament to spell out, especially looking at the positive impact of gutkas today. I will clarify that most Sikhs historically did support him and he died with the Panth's support, but that's jsut a sad side I thought I'd mention."
Sikh,3cprbg,asdfioho,2,Thu Jul 9 21:36:36 2015 UTC,"Really? Never heard of this before.  Considering he comes from a family that was very close to Sikhi (came into Sikhi with 5th Guru), fought in wars with Gurus, many in his family were shaheed, his brother, Bhai Dayala, went with Guru Tegh Bahadur to Delhi, he was placed at Harimandir Sahib by Guru Gobind Singh, the scribe of SGGS, jathedar of the panth and many Sikhs agreed to come to Harimandir Sahib to celebrate Bandi Chod because of Bhai Mani Singh, it appears that he was respected.  There will always be haters. He was probably well respected and supported by the vast majority of Sikhs. Was it such a big issue?"
Sikh,3cprbg,asdfioho,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:36:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure how big it was. My grandfather had mentioned it to my father when he told him the sakhi, and I've read scholarly works that mention it. I think it's died down because it's something recorded among tradition more-so than historical fact: just like the supposed Sakhi where Guru Gobind Singh Ji burnt masands alive."

In this world depression is caused by many things, it can be genetic, sadness, grief, past physical abuse etc etc. Gurbaani is a special kind of medicine, it doesnt cure you of the bodily diseases but the diseases of the mind. Gurbaani separates a person from this world, the person becomes detached from this world while living in it. The person is aware of who he really is and what his purpose in this life is. Through the help of gurbaani he understands that this world is ""false"", its all a game being played and he has to lift above this game, recognize it while still being a part of the game. I know its easy for me to tell you to snap out of it, that is if you are depressed, but in reality it is very hard. I have gone through the depression stage and it is very hard to think outside the box during that time. Every single though and action seems significant and ads on to the depression. But hang in there slowly slowly as you start to understand more about yourself through gurbaani you will start to feel better.

Sikh,3cp2ar,Dragearen,2,Thu Jul 9 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"My own views.  I've never heard about him.  What are his ideas?  To be honest, I've never really been interested in things like this. I only try to get knowledge from SGGS.  The whole of SGGS is a contemplation upon Waheguru, it is the mantar.  Just reciting something or repeating a phrase, what good is that?  If you don't actually make the change, try to fight the inner battle, to see the One within yourself and everywhere, what good is a phrase?  You don't need a living master. The Guru is Waheguru, the great teacher. The Gurus are our guides, but they join us to Waheguru. We learn from Waheguru, we come to know Waheguru within us.  The SGGS is the light to Waheguru, for a Sikh, you don't need anything else.  If someone finds these teachings useful and helpful, then thats great. For me, the teachings come from SGGS."
Sikh,3cp2ar,Singh_Q6,2,Thu Jul 9 22:24:27 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm not certain if I could describe his ideas entirely accurately because I have not studied his talks in depth and also many of them are rather complex.  Besides that he usually teaches through stories, so it's not so easy to say ""well this is true but this is not true according to him.""  What he teaches he calls the sant mat, which, while he says is not associated with Sikhi, he obviously has a Sikh influence (he is Punjabi).  For instance, he believes that many of the world's religions speak of dying while living, and as meditation as a process to practice that.  He also teaches the importance of love and devotion (though directed towards a living master, which as I stated I am very skeptical of), as well as initiation by said master (also skeptical).  However he certainly does have an interesting perspective of the mind, 'proper' methods of meditation, and the nature of the different realms (which I can't remember all the names of unfortunately but I do remember sach khand is the same).  But isn't Waheguru arguably just another mantra?  Of course it is one that holds some significance, and I would argue that is the power it holds.  God cannot be limited to one single name, that would be absurd.  Rather it is the power that we give to it that makes it meaningful for us.  You could just as easily meditate on ""potato"" if potato had a divine connotation to it, could you not?  Agreed with you on the second part though.  Simply meditating, simply remembering a mantra - useless if you don't put it into practice.  You can't just meditate and say ""OK, did my Sikh duty, now to go off and live my dishonest manmukh life.""  It takes practice in both areas of your life.  I also agree about not needing a living master.  One question I would ask you though is, is it not worthwhile to study other religious scriptures and teachers and contemplate them as well?  Surely the Gurus were not the only ones to connect with God, and not the only ones who have things to teach.  Edit: To better answer your question about his ideas, here are some things from his site, since his own words can probably describe it to you better than I can.   Meditation is the art of withdrawing our attention from experience to the experiencer. Meditation is the art of reversing the direction of attention from the illusion to the reality of consciousness. Ishwar Puri Ishwar Puri refers on occasions to human body's chakras, but warns us: ""Don't go after the little tricks of the six chakras below, of these energy centers. Don't be fooled by the beautiful colors and experiences and think this is a spiritual experience. Don't waste your time."" We have to meditate and be between, behind and above the physical eyes. ""Don't go downward from there to find spirituality and truth"". Ishwar Puri Ji says - To close your eyes and imagine we are sitting in the head behind the eyes is itself a good start to practice meditation. Mind is a machine within time and space, powered by the Soul."
Sikh,3cp2ar,Singh_Q6,3,Thu Jul 9 22:39:04 2015 UTC,"These are just my opinions, they are not necessarily correct.  Exactly, there is no special word or mantar. Even Waheguru is a word given to describe the One.  It has conotations which can help to place the mind the right place and the word itself is a great description of the Sikh concept of the One.  It allows us to contemplate and understand Waheguru.  Wah - wow, awesome Guru - teacher, enlightener.  However, its just another word.  SGGS often tells us, just talking or repeating words won't help to realise Waheguru.  Bhai Gurdas Ji (contemporary of 3 Gurus, well respected figure in Sikh history) summarises this concept in a poem.  ਜੈਸੇ ਖਾਂਡ ਖਾਂਡ ਕਹੈ ਮੁਖਿ ਨਹੀ ਮੀਠਾ ਹੋਇ ਜਬ ਲਗ ਜੀਭ ਸ੍ਵਾਦ ਖਾਂਡੁ ਨਹੀਂ ਖਾਈਐ ।  Jaisay Khaand Khaand Kahai Moukhi Nahee Meetthaa Hoi , Jab Lag Jeebh Svaad Khaandu Naheen Khaaeeai ।  Just like saying ""sugar, sugar"", the mouth does not taste sweetness. (Only) until sugar is placed on the tongue, it cannot feel its taste.   ਜੈਸੇ ਰਾਤ ਅੰਧੇਰੀ ਮੈ ਦੀਪਕ ਦੀਪਕ ਕਹੈ ਤਿਮਰ ਨ ਜਾਈ ਜਬ ਲਗ ਨ ਜਰਾਈਐ ।  Jaisay Raat Andhayree Mai Deepak Deepak Kahai , Timar N Jaaee Jab Lag N Jaraaeeai ।  In a dark night, saying ""lamp, lamp"" does not dispel darkness, until we light the lamp, the darkness will not be dispelled.  ਜੈਸੇ ਗਿਆਨ ਗਿਆਨ ਕਹੈ ਗਿਆਨ ਹੂੰ ਨ ਹੋਤ ਕਛੁ ਜਬ ਲਗੁ ਗੁਰ ਗਿਆਨ ਅੰਤਰਿ ਨ ਪਾਈਐ ।  Jaisay Giaan Giaan Kahai Giaan Hoon N Hot Kachhu , Jab Lagu Gur Giaan Antari N Paaeeai ।  Just like saying Gian (Knowledge) again and again, knowledge cannot be obtained. Until the knowledge of the Guru is not placed in the heart, no knowledge is obtained.  ਤੈਸੇ ਗੁਰ ਧਿਆਨ ਕਹੈ ਗੁਰ ਧਿਆਨ ਹੂ ਨ ਪਾਵਤ ਜਬ ਲਗੁ ਗੁਰ ਦਰਸ ਜਾਇ ਨ ਸਮਾਈਐ ॥੫੪੨॥  Taisay Gur Dhiaan Kahai Gur Dhiaan Hoo N Paavata , Jab Lagu Gur Daras Jaai N Samaaeeai ॥542॥  Similarly just repeatedly asking for the focus on the Guru, one does not acquire focus on the Guru. Only until we do spend time seeing the Guru, one cannot get the focus.  (542)  Just by talking about something or repeating a phease, you won't recieve anything.  Just repeating Waheguru, without focusing on the meaning, without contemplating upon it, you don't taste the sweetness.  Similarly the mantar is just a word, if you don't contemplate upon the mantar, will you achieve anything?  You have to do, you have to light the lamp, you have to learn from the teacher, you have to practice to achieve anything.  Sure, study other traditions. Sikhs are encouraged to learn about the world and other traditions. Guru Gobind Singh's poets translated many texts of other religions into language Sikhs could understand.  But the point is that SGGS comes first, that is where Sikhs derive their knowledge.  Sure, other people might help to walk the path and strengthen you, there are other people who have realised Waheguru. We should seek them out. But a Sikhs focus always end up on the teachings of the Guru."

I've heard people say that you should meditate on God through love of Guru Nanak Ji. But I believe meditating on Waheguru directly is the most important thing. I personally have nothing against Sants since they teach people the way to Waheguru but you certainly don't need to love a Sant to get close to Waheguru."

Sikh,3cmw9y,asdfioho,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:37:42 2015 UTC,"I'm saying in general. Nothing specific. I know vaguely of Operation Blue Star and how her Sikh body guards killed Indira Gandhi after she ordered the assults on Amirit and the Gurdwaras there. Was that not vengeance? And as for preemptive assult, had they known about the operation before it was ordered, would sikhs have likely attacked Indian military garrisons before they were attacked? I'm just using that as an example. But say I know someone plans to do harm to me or another, as a sikh would it be in line with Sikhi living to attack that person first to prevent them from harming me or another. Or if someone has hurt me or someone I care about, is retaliation acceptable? I know as a sikh I should look to defend myself and others, and aggression is to be avoided and used when words or other actions won't solve problems, making violence a last resort in a sense, but not in the traditional sense. I hope that makes sense."
Sikh,3cmw9y,asdfioho,3,Thu Jul 9 08:48:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting question. I think revenge and even preemptive violence are not seen in line with the view of Sikh self defense. Preemptively, we are to be always armed and always prepared, but we are never to make the first attack. There's even a story about how in a battle, Guru Gobind Singh waited for the arrow of the opposing enemy before firing his own.  Regarding vengeance, many Sikhs do it, but it's not in line with Sikh thought IMO as revenge is a part of rage. However, cases like Indira or even O'Dyer are a bit different in that they're cases of rebelling against systematic and institutional violence that manifested itself in such a way that people were attacked and not given justice. To put my thoughts more clearly, Bluestar was the height of Indira's perceived injustice towards Sikhs, and was to be followed by harsher actions under her hand like presidential action which her assassination mitigated. Her assassination was more an act of rebellion and less of ""eff u bro."" If we are 20 years removed from 1984 and Indira is peacefully retired and living with her grandkids, I would probably not be as accepting of her assassination."
Sikh,3cmw9y,asdfioho,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:24:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I didn't know that story of Guru Gobind, but I had assumed as much. It seems wrong and completely against the Sikhi to attack first for any reason. I did not expect it to also be in war, but it is understandable with Sikh beliefs.  As for revenge what do you mean a lot if Sikhs do it? It would fall in lime with rage, I can't believe I didn't think if that. There is even a part of the SGGS that addresses it, I don't remember the words exactly, but it likens someone holding a grudge to a hunting animal, the grudge pervades the persons thoughts constantly filling them with anger, they stalk their intended victim, and their mind is full of thoughts of violence. It is like the epitome of rage. Those assassinations were tactical wartime decisions though, I didn't look at them that way."

Among these committees was the Ranganath Misra Commission, which was set up in 1985 to look at the violence in its entirety. The testimonies recorded by the Misra commission blamed Kamal Nath, the United Progressive Alliance’s minister of commerce between 2004 and 2009, for instigating a mob at Gurudwara Rakabganj in Delhi, where two Sikhs were burned to death. Nath was never investigated and has always maintained that he had attempted to disperse the crowd, not encourage it. In this excerpt from Sanjay Suri’s book, 1984: The Anti-Sikh Violence and After, Suri—who was a reporter with The Indian Express at that time—recounts the events he saw unfolding at Gurudwara Rakabganj.

There is no formal conversion process, as it is a way of life, thinking, contemplating, and understanding. However, there is a process for becoming a part of the Khalsa.   This is your own path in life, and how receptive others are to your conversion should be of no consequence (besides the process of joining the Khalsa, in which case I believe you are granted privilege of joining the Khalsa by the panj pyare - though I'm not amritdharee, so I could very well be wrong here)."

Yes Sikhi does acknowledge The Path of the Saints in other traditions, but even the Gurus ghemselves expressed very clear interest in bringing Sikhi to tge common people. From my understanding, along with some political reasons, one of Jahangir's main dislikes of Guru Arjan Dev Ji was the growth of Sikhi, along with the conversion of Muslims into the Panth."
Sikh,3cd5cq,ChardiKala,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:40:43 2015 UTC,"Masands were meant to collect daswand and be representatives of the the guru all over India. As far as I know  their main objective was not to go out and preach sikhi to non Sikh people.  What I was trying to say, at the time there was not such thing as a Sikh, just a follower is the guru. This obviously changed in 1699. Gurus Nanak dev ji and any other parcharaks at the time did not go around to make Sikhs, just better disciples of God Whether they were Muslims or Hindus.  All in all, all the parchar/preaching that happens is in our gurudwaras. We do not go around and do Katha in other places"
Sikh,3cd5cq,singhtej,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:15:39 2015 UTC,"As far as I know their main objective was not to go out and preach sikhi to non Sikh people.   Is there any evidence for this? Because as far as I'm aware, the Manjis and Masands were almost like preachers (maybe that's the wrong word), and their objective, alongside representing the Guru, was to spread Sikhi and increase the size of the sangats. Sikhi's initial growth wasn't from birth rates as much as it was from converts.   What I was trying to say, at that time there was no such thing as a Sikh, just a follower of the Guru.   'Sikh' is actually used as a label in SGGS Ji by the earlier Gurus, and they go into detail about what it means to be the Guru's Sikh. Bhai Gurdas does the same.   This obviously changed in 1699.   I disagree. Vaisakhi 1699 marked the birth of the Khalsa, it wasn't to identify who was and wasn't a Sikh. That had already been determined by Guru Nanak.    All in all, all the parchar/preaching that happens is in our gurudwaras. We do not go around and do Katha in other places.   There isn't even that much Parchar happening in Gurdwaras anymore. That needs to change but along with it, I think we need to carry out Parchar outside Gurdwaras as well. Streets, television, Universities, inter-faith debate forums whether virtual or in the real world, I am highly opposed to keeping Parchar confined to just our Gurdwaras."

Sikh,3cch6i,Banana_head,3,Mon Jul 6 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"I was actually having this conversation with a friend earlier today.  He randomly asked me about Sikhi and death. Pretty awesome coincedence (or is it!!!!!)  Am I scared of dying?  I honestly don't know.  I mean what is there to be fearful of? Why do I need to fear it? Its just a part of life. I can't escape it, it will come for me. It will come for all of us.  I guess it is that lack of control and power. Death is something we can't control, we don't know anything about it. All we know is that it will happen. We enjoy having power, death takes it away from us. We fear the unknown, death is probably the greatest frontier humans will face.  I guess the Sikh answer to all this is, why not accept the inevitable and live a life without fear?  ਦਿਨਸੁ ਚੜੈ ਫਿਰਿ ਆਥਵੈ ਰੈਣਿ ਸਬਾਈ ਜਾਇ ॥  Dhinas Charrai Fir Aathhavai Rain Sabaaee Jaae ||   The day dawns, and then it ends, and the night passes away.   ਆਵ ਘਟੈ ਨਰੁ ਨਾ ਬੁਝੈ ਨਿਤਿ ਮੂਸਾ ਲਾਜੁ ਟੁਕਾਇ ॥  Aav Ghattai Nar Naa Bujhai Nith Moosaa Laaj Ttukaae ||   The person's life is diminishing, but he does not understand that each day, the mouse (death) is gnawing away at the rope (life).   Sikhi is all about life, about really living, in the here and now. To kill yourself while still living.  ਕਬੀਰ ਮਰਤਾ ਮਰਤਾ ਜਗੁ ਮੂਆ ਮਰਿ ਭੀ ਨ ਜਾਨਿਆ ਕੋਇ ॥  kabīr maratā maratā jag mūā mar bhī n jāniā kōi .   Kabir, the people of this world are dying, again and again they are dying, yet no one knows how to die.   ਐਸੇ ਮਰਨੇ ਜੋ ਮਰੈ ਬਹੁਰਿ ਨ ਮਰਨਾ ਹੋਇ ॥੨੯॥  aisē maranē jō marai bahur n maranā hōi .29.   Those who die such a death, they will not die again. ||29||   Guru Amar Das Ji replies to this salok.  ਮਃ ੩ ॥  Third Mehl:  ਕਿਆ ਜਾਣਾ ਕਿਵ ਮਰਹਗੇ ਕੈਸਾ ਮਰਣਾ ਹੋਇ ॥   What do I know about how I will die? How should I die?   ਜੇ ਕਰਿ ਸਾਹਿਬੁ ਮਨਹੁ ਨ ਵੀਸਰੈ ਤਾ ਸਹਿਲਾ ਮਰਣਾ ਹੋਇ ॥   If I do not forget my Master from my mind, then my death will be easy.   ਮਰਣੈ ਤੇ ਜਗਤੁ ਡਰੈ ਜੀਵਿਆ ਲੋੜੈ ਸਭੁ ਕੋਇ ॥   The world is terrified of death; everyone longs to live.   ਗੁਰ ਪਰਸਾਦੀ ਜੀਵਤੁ ਮਰੈ ਹੁਕਮੈ ਬੂਝੈ ਸੋਇ ॥   By Guru's Grace, one who dies while yet alive, understands the Hukam.   ਨਾਨਕ ਐਸੀ ਮਰਨੀ ਜੋ ਮਰੈ ਤਾ ਸਦ ਜੀਵਣੁ ਹੋਇ ॥੨॥   O Nanak, one who dies such a death, lives forever. ||2||   Sikhi is all about becoming fearless, to become a mirror image of Waheguru. To merge with Waheguru.  Waheguru is nirbhau - without fear. Conquer your mind, defeat your fears. Live in Chardi Kala (rising spirits), then there will be no fear left.  When you become One with Waheguru, then what can kill you?  ਜਿਨ੍ਹ੍ਹਾ ਨ ਵਿਸਰੈ ਨਾਮੁ ਸੇ ਕਿਨੇਹਿਆ ॥  Jinhaa N Visarai Naam Sae Kinaehiaa ||   What are they like - those who do not forget the Naam?   ਭੇਦੁ ਨ ਜਾਣਹੁ ਮੂਲਿ ਸਾਂਈ ਜੇਹਿਆ ॥੧॥  Bhaedh N Jaanahu Mool Saanee Jaehiaa ||1||   Know that there is absolutely no difference; they are exactly like the Master. ||1||   I don't follow Sikhi because of fear. Sikhi is about love, it is a game of love.  ਜਉ ਤਉ ਪ੍ਰੇਮ ਖੇਲਣ ਕਾ ਚਾਉ ॥  Jo Tho Praem Khaelan Kaa Chaao ||   If you desire to play this game of love with Me,   ਸਿਰੁ ਧਰਿ ਤਲੀ ਗਲੀ ਮੇਰੀ ਆਉ ॥  Sir Dhhar Thalee Galee Maeree Aao ||   Then step onto My Path with your head in hand.   So I am not a Sikh because of fear, I don't fear an afterlife of fire and lava. I don't desire materialistic objects after death (wine and them virgins).  I want to live in the here and now. I want to reach my origin, I want to be like my Gurus.  What happens after death? I don't know, I haven't gone to the afterlife yet. I'll send you a message when I get there.  This body will return to where it came from, my life will return to where it came from. I am just another raindrop in the ocean of Waheguru, I will return to where I came from."

When Guru Gobind Singh Ji created the Khalsa at the first Vaisakhi, he called out to his congregation for a person to be willing to sacrifice his life for the Guru. Those five who did became the Panj Pyare.  The thought or fear of death can also be a distraction from meditating on Naam. I think it's easier for a Sikh to lose their fear of death than perhaps others because we have a lot of martyrs and valiant soldiers in our history and some of us are encouraged from birth to believe/understand we are warriors."

Through daily meditation, daily exercise and weekly therapy I am the happiest I have ever been in my life. I felt like the drugs were blunting me, and just did not feel right when a doctor gave them to me. I am happy to be off of those drugs.  However, each situation is different. My depression was the result of unresolved trauma I faced as a child. For others, it may be a biochemistry issue, and drugs may be the best route to go. One thing I will say is you should get multiple medical opinions. Also, don't view the medication as the ""end all be all"". I strongly encourage you to continue meditating, and to add daily exercise into your routine. Along with speaking to a professional, you may find you don't need as much medication/any medication long term.  As far as Sikhi's stance on this, I believe it is all about intention. You are not using these drugs to ""get high"", you are using them to address an illness. No different than a Sikh using anesthesia before surgery, or using antibiotics. I don't think you have any reason to feel bad about this.   It is awesome that meditation has brought you happiness this week. Best of luck!"

I do have a therapist abs a psychiatrist, this will be my third psychiatrist, sure is the first to want be off my current medications, but she just wants to put me on others.

I don't wish for any help from God at all as I'm capable of meeting my own needs, I'd much rather have him help others much before me, but saying that, here's an example of one of many things that has happened to me. I'm in the Darbar late at night, only a few people are there and everything is over, I'm doing simran and trying to really get into it but I feel really really hot in my back and I'm sitting really close to the back wall but not leaning on it, I know there are no windows open and the fans are off, yet I thought to myself I need to keep going and push past it, only a few mins later I feel this small breeze along side my back keeping me cool and kept me doing simran. I laughed because either it's an awesome coincidence or God has a sense of humor. It does happen randomly to me though so I never expect stuff to happen.  But for all intents and purposes I'm going to say it was just a mere coincidence :) Thought I'd share this.

Sikh,3c8k6y,Singh_Q6,5,Sun Jul 5 22:22:22 2015 UTC,"I struggled a great deal with the concept of haumai (as well as the 5 thieves) for months. It was almost all I contemplated on, trying to explain the concept to myself. I figured that once I could understand haumai, I could work towards shedding it.  Finally, it was while attending a series of katha's by Baba Hardev Singh Ji Lulon Wale at my local Gurdwara that I found what I've considered to be the best explanation.  You've said:   The 5 thives in service, are essential for life. However, they need to be destroyed if they control us.  It is this self-centeredness, this extreme love and view of the self that bani is talking about that we term ego. Perhaps the literal translation of haumai as ego is not the best way to translate this concept.   I believe you have hit the nail on the head. If I understood completely, Baba Hardev Singh explains that Haumai is essentially self-centredness. It is the root of the other 5 thieves because it creates a shift in the balance that controls the thieves.   When you are self-centred, you become prone to serving that self:   through lust, when you excessively crave something for yourself. through anger, when you feel that your sense of self has been hurt or jilted. through greed, in the service of the self. through excessive attachment to maya, becoming blind to the transient nature of possessions, of the body, etc. through pride, believing that you are better than any other being and thereby forgetting that they too are a part of Waheguru and his creation.   So it is through this self-centredness that we allow the 5 thieves to become effective thieves. Yet, in his katha Baba Hardev Singh also said that these 5 thieves are essential for sansaar to function, and to thrive. Without these, humanity would cease to progress or exist altogether. However, it is only when these 5 thieves are within your control that you have succeeded in shifting from a state of haumai (I,me/me,me/self-centredness) to a state of god-centredness. In controlling haumai, you effectively control the 5 thieves with one shackle (if you will).  We are instructed to live within society, and not to become ascetics who renounce living within society or family-life. An ascetic would seek to deny or destroy the 5 thieves, whereas a Sikh should seek to control them. We need just enough haumai to live without being trampled on, however so little so that we remain Waheguru-centred rather than Self-centred.  I believe that this is why it's the most difficult thief to keep within control; you are yourself, and it is difficult to shift your focus from your own existence to the greater existence."

When they die, it makes you lose control of your life  When you become too self-centered and narcissistic, well, as you can guess: it makes you lose control of your life as you see only yourself and not others."
Sikh,3c8k6y,asdfioho,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:12:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's generally understood that nothing is good or evil because everything is within hukam. Haumai, as I see it, is firstly the individuated self. A homeostatic body with a definite internal and external which seeks to regulate itself and it does that through instincts which instill the fundamental drive to fulfill the basic needs of this indivituated self. This is hunger, thirst, safety(broad as this entails a lot, actually all points), drive for procreation. Haumai is secondly the consciousness that percieves a self. Naturally arising in congruence with the self perserving body which has form. It defends ideas. Now, manmukh is one who's mind is plagued by the thieves and acts from ignorance. A gurmukh understands the root and acts from it. One who has no haumai has surrendered their own intellect and relies on the guru. The guru is primordial wisdom and the fundamental truth of reality, satnaam.  The recognition of truth naturally creates compassion, love, humility, no judgement and fearlessness. I think living without haumai means no barriers and distinction between there being separate entities disappears. One sees a singular being and sees themselves naturally a part of that singular being and merges in sahej with the world and walks in hukam. One dissolves the self into the all and without a fear of death, they no longer are subject to birth and death."

I will never accept the thought the we 'need a little bit of the vikaars' inside for certain reason It's not blind faith but this thread goes again basically all the sants' teaching for past ~300 years. I don't know what you have been taught but the 5 vices are evil and we do not need an ounce of them if we strive to be the image of the Sikhs guru gobind Singh ji made.   It's not that small amount of list that's suppose to drive sex and reproduction, it's love(while giving up attachment).  we obviously protect our children and loved ones but that should be compassion; not attachment.  Not anger, but sense of responsibility and beer-ras(warriors prowess) should be how we fight against injustice.  Being thrifty with our money does not necessarily bring us an honest living. It actually does the opposite as you want to keep the money and that's exactly what greed is. Look at bhagat labor ji, bhagat ravidas ji, bhagat pooran Singh ji, etc. They had handful of items to their name but they earned an honest living while constantly craving God and now they will be remembered til end of time.  *I don't want a long discussion, just putting this thought out there"

Sikh,3c65ul,ChardiKala,2,Sun Jul 5 21:00:24 2015 UTC,That was a nice response. It really did allow me to look into Sikh mindset. From what I can extract is God is infact impersonal in the sense that he doesn't involve himself with humanity and his creation. It's the humanity that seeks God. But God according to sikhi doesn't care either way if you seek him or not.
Sikh,3c65ul,SkepticSikh,4,Mon Jul 6 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"What you need to look at is that everything is God/Waheguru. You are God, I am God. Everything has that essence of God for it is what binds the universe together.   So when we say God doesn't involve himself with humanity or creation then we're applying human attributes and characteristics to God. If we are God then surely God is involved in humanity and creation but not in the Abrahamic concept whereby God is separate from everyone and everything and acts as a distinct being which does interfere when required.   Let's look at it another way. Imagine that there is this beautiful song playing throughout the universe. It's always playing and will always be playing. The song isn't going to stop playing if someone doesn't listen to it. Why would it care? It's a song. But we all posses radios that allow us to tune into the frequency of which the song is playing. Sikhi teaches us how to tune our radios to listen to that song. Once we've tuned in then you listen to the most beautiful song ever known and you're in total bliss and ecstasy. That song that was always playing around you and within you, you can finally listen to it because you have been taught how to."

Sikh,3c65ul,iAmUnown,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"Waheguru in Sikhi is really up to your own interpretation beyond what the Gurus have taught us. He is everywhere, in everyone and everything. We can strive to build a relationship with him but at the same time he isn't a tangible being or something we can see or feel, we can simply experience him.   I think in this sense He then falls into your latter characterisation. He is the creator, he has written his will and everything is simply happening to his accord."
Sikh,3c65ul,asdfioho,5,Sun Jul 5 05:40:39 2015 UTC,"Some follow up questions if you and the community could oblige.   I understand the Gurus were enlightened.  If God is impersonal and doesn't communicate with its creation. who enlightened the Gurus?   Do they enlighten themselves?   How does humanity understand objective morality with out God's intervention. Would there be an objective morality with out God's intervention?  Does God hear our prayers?   If he does, does he respond?"
Sikh,3c65ul,asdfioho,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:30:02 2015 UTC,"For ""enlightenment"" I see it as along the Buddhist approach personally (which too does not have a personal God).It's less of a deity granting you a boon to me and more of you connecting with the consciousness binding the universe. So in a sense they enlighten themselves by reconnecting to the God within all of us.   How does humanity understand objective morality with out God's intervention. Would there be an objective morality with out God's intervention?   no, I don't think so. I think Sikhism to an extent acknowledges this--the five vices in Sikhi aren't sins because they're ordained so by divine law but because they distract from God. The code of conduct for Sikhs is not a work of divine law but crafted by humans to fit alongside spiritual principles of GGS.   Does God hear our prayers? If he does, does he respond?   Here's an interesting thought...the tenth Sikh Guru told us to fight against tyranny and stand for justice. Many people pray for those things, and the Gurus' Sikhs later accomplished it for people.were their prayers heard?  In general, I don't think prayers are a strong concept, meditation is though."
Sikh,3c65ul,iAmUnown,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you, from what I gather, sikhi doesn't discuss absolutes and its concept of God to me seems as if God really doesn't grant prayers and whether he listens to humanity is a non-issue because of his non intervention policy,  if you will. If humanity wants God, it can seek God."

Sikh,3c5m9s,Protolore,9,Sun Jul 5 01:00:14 2015 UTC,"Fateh ji, I can answer most of your questions (was expecting just two but woah, great to know you're not moving forward without asking questions). I'll answer detailing eat her kakaar.   Firstly, the kachera is an undergarment which is made from cotton and preferably coloured white (I've heard it symbolises purity and such, but it's also the most prominent and easily attainable colour). You can buy kachera pre-made but I'd suggest you have it made, if you're in India, you can easily find specialised shops in Punjab or Punjabi-populated areas in your city where they measure you and make it accordingly. They can provide you with the cloth or can advise you on the best type and they'll know how to make it.   The kirpan, again, you can buy from any shop in India selling 'sikh' items or you can go to your local Gurdwara and they should have a range available for you to wear. They are worn with a gatra, a sash from your right shoulder to left hip - like this.   The kara is preferred to be made of iron and those are should also be easily available from your local Gurdwara or a Sikh items shop. It tends to be worn on your dominant hand and should always remain on your wrist as it symbolises the presence of Waheguru and reminds us of his omnipresent nature.   A kanga must be wooden and must be worn with your kes, many or woman, and they should also be available from your local Gurdwara to Sikh items shop.   Finally, kes, the most important and highly regarded kakaar. If you're taking Amrit no hair must be trimmed or shaved on any part of the body unless you have a serious medical condition which requires you to do something to your hair, then it's up to your discretion. This includes you beard, you can groom it (oils, brush) but you mustn't trim it and it's also preferable if you keep your beard open and flowing.  Your hair must preferably be always covered but I tend to take my turban off when I sleep. When you're out of the house, naturally, you should wear a turban, but when you're in the house if you want to you can take it off and wear a small patka or keski (smaller turban that goes around your head 3-4 times).   Hope this helps but if you have anymore questions or want to clarify something, feel free to ask."
Sikh,3c5m9s,iAmUnown,3,Sun Jul 5 04:11:39 2015 UTC,"That is actually fantastic, thank you so much. I'm actually in America, I wish I was in Punjab India, it would be much easier to find what I need. They're is a local Gurdwara though, I was planning on visiting in a day or two, maybe then I can get everything I need.  I would like to be baptised and do the Amrit. I keep my hair rather short and shave daily, but I haven't gotten a haircut or shaved in about a week. Does my hair need to be a certain length before I can do the Amrit? And as for the patka, another user said there was something like a banana that is a simple head wrap that you can wear casually."
Sikh,3c5m9s,NoobSingh,3,Sun Jul 5 05:12:55 2015 UTC,It doesn't but I'd suggest you keep it uncut for a while before you go ahead with taking Amrit. I myself spotted trimming my beard two years before hand along side with drinking and eating meat before I fully made the commitment. I did however see a lot of ppl taking amrit with me that had maybe a weeks with of beard. I guess it's really up to you but see if you can handle it
Sikh,3c5m9s,Singh_Q6,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:50:36 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer longer hair and a beard. I already don't drink, smoke, or do drugs, I haven't in almost 5 years and don't plan to any time soon. But what's that about not eating meat? I thought meat was just fine as long as it want ritualisticly killed? I don't plan to go through the Amrit baptism until I have read more if the SGGS, started praying regularly, and gone to the Gurdwara and helped with the langar a few times to be sure I am capable of attending regularly. My wife is not very religious and we also have a 1 year old daughter, so my time is pretty strained."
Sikh,3c5m9s,iAmUnown,6,Sun Jul 5 06:11:32 2015 UTC,"The offical Sikh code of conduct says meat is allowed as long as the animal wasn't ritually slaughtered (Halal, Kosher) and wasn't killed in a cruel way.  Sikhi doesn't really care about diet. Your food won't make you more spiritual, it is up to the Sikh to apply Sikh teachings to their life and to decide what they want to do.  Some Sikhs eat meat and others don't.  I think today, especially with the modern meat industry, it is preferable for Sikhs to abstain from meat. The animals are kept in terrible conditions and suffer.  If you hunt for your own food or buy meat from animals that were raised compassionately, then it is up to you to decide.  I am a vegetarian as my own personal view is that its probably the best for the world and the animals."
Sikh,3c5m9s,miztah1999z,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, that is understandable. Not that I'm a huge near eater as is, but I can see the logic in abstaining from it in modern times though."
Sikh,3c5m9s,used2Bdajalebimaster,4,Sun Jul 5 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"A considerably vast majority of baptised and mainstream Sikhs are purely vegetarian and meat is forbidden (like alcohol, drugs etc.). The primary reasoning is that Waheguru/God is present in every breathing being. Not only humans, but also any kind of flora or fauna. So killing (directly/indirectly) an animal for our sustenance is not considered okay - ritualistic or conventional. Once you consider this view its much easier to understand why meat isn't eaten."
Sikh,3c5m9s,used2Bdajalebimaster,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:48:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that does make sense. I will have to think about that before I go through the Amrit."
Sikh,3c5m9s,NoobSingh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:37:02 2015 UTC,Then why do we eat flora?
Sikh,3c5m9s,NoobSingh,2,Fri Jul 10 06:33:37 2015 UTC,"I have got to agree with 'iAmUnown' in that a majority of Sikhs would not indulge in meat-eating. I personally. for example, abstain from meat even though I am not quite sure if eating it is in line with Sikh though or not (I would most likely side with Sikhs not eating meat, as I personally feel that eating meat does somewhat affect one's spirituality) - as the mainstream Sikh population (organizations, gurdwaras, etc...) do not indulge in meat-eating - so I simply do not eat meat out of precedent, history, and the majority opinion amongst Sikhs."
Sikh,3c5m9s,NoobSingh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:58:03 2015 UTC,Interesting. Would you say it is frowned in then? Or discouraged? Or just a matter or a sikh's personal views?
Sikh,3c5m9s,autowikibot,2,Sun Jul 5 21:52:57 2015 UTC,"The way I interpret it is that although it is not explicitly stated, by the vary nature of a Sikh (being compassionate, seeing the one energy, connection, god, etc... in all) it is not in the collective Sikh psyche to condone eating meat, that is what I think results in the collectively set idea of not eating meat. It is not simply an arbitrary rule, or it is not about becoming impure, or anything like that - but when a Sikh can sustain with as little impact on the rest of Waheguru's creation, then the Sikh will take that path (i.e. vegetarianism).  So its not about being looked down upon, frowned upon, etc... for me and many Sikhs, it is about precedent and where that precedent stems from (compassion) that the community adopts vegetarianism. I think that when embracing a community, you should certainly contemplate on what the community believes as a whole.  Hopefully that made some sense and also hopefully answered your question :) Again, I'm not an authority on the subject or anything, I am simply expressing my views and observations.  But like the gurus said (and I am paraphrasing), it is useless to argue about such things, as the ultimate goal is to realize the one, and allow that realization to propel yourself into serving the rest of humanity and the world in which we reside, so don't get too hung up on the meat issue (god knows the community has wasted way too much time on this topic, rather on focusing on our spirituality or sewa)."
Sikh,3c5m9s,asdfioho,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:53:24 2015 UTC,"That made plenty of sense, and was quite enlightening. I know the sikhi is more about what gets an individual closer to Waheguru, for each individual. Thats why I was so curious if it was something that was of concern to the faith or more of a personal beliefe that is just very popular. I can see it being a bit of both, but leaning much more towards the latter. And I won't worry about it anymore. Thank you so much."
Sikh,3c5m9s,asdfioho,2,Mon Jul 6 03:11:41 2015 UTC,"Here's my take, I look at it as an environmental kind of thing. There are countless of farmers that grow food specifically for farm animals that are going to be slaughtered, now with a population of 7.3 billion, we are on a huge rise to starvation, where reports are starting to pop up as to prepare for when we hit 9 billion in 2050 (as predicted). As of now, we have huge starvation populations already in the world, and with the farmers farming for animal feed only, that alone could save those that are dying each and every day of starvation. That's just one,  Another is greenhouse gases, according to old sources, live stock contributes about 13% of the gasses, which is the same percentage as cars, as cars are starting to go ""greener"", to fully green (all electric, and hopefully with in the century to harvest only energy from the sun (Type 1 civilization method) and thus reduction of the gasses even more.  Also lastly, we can survive without it thanks to all these technological advancements compared to the olden days where they actually needed to eat every chance they could.  So that's my reasoning, I could honestly go on more, forced breeding, bad and awful conditions (yes even organic animals), and so on.  I should also mention I've been a veggie for only 3 years and my family thought they'd never see the day where I stopped eating meat, my cousin till this day is still chocked at it haha.  Edit: There was a story I heard about that really stuck to me about Guru Har Rai about who he would take care of plants, animals and humans, how his gentle touch on everything only left a positive impact and how he never wanted to hurt plants when he was a child. I'll try to find it tom as I'm about to go to bed, unless someone posts the link but it really teaches a lot on compassion for the Earth."
Sikh,3c5m9s,iAmUnown,2,Mon Jul 6 05:56:29 2015 UTC,"It makes me so happy that you dropped a Kardashev civilization type in your post. And I seriously like your reasoning. It's very different from your average veggie. Though I'm not sure I could handle the lifestyle. I tired it for months, and by the end of my attempt I was not doing to well. But I'm six and a half feet tall and reasonably fit so my body just needed more. Granted this was almost 5 years ago, so the science in the vegetarian scene has definitely changed enough to sustain me. In fact I just realized my daily meal replacement shake for working out is vegan. If I could just drink these 3 times a day I could be happy. There is that soylent drink being made, I'd be curious to try that out of it didn't cost do much."
Sikh,3c5m9s,Apollo_D,2,Mon Jul 6 06:14:07 2015 UTC,"You just need to add fats and carbs into your diet, there are a lot of people whom are vegan that are extremely fit, such as frank medrano.  How I cut off neat was I started 1 day no neat then 2 up to fully. I knew I was successful when I gave my friend the rest of my pork chops.  Also make your burgers like your meat ones, marinate, spices and so on, I find I crave the spices and sauces compared to the meat.   I myself make a home made protein shake but it's extremely heavy, 1200cal, 60g fat, protein and 200g carb.  I'm tempted to try soylent but they don't ship to Canada yet. But only as an extra meal, as i have a very fast metabolism."

He's not afraid to shy away from Sikh issues, our community's suffering in 1984 in particular. Shame on those who call him a terrorist, shows the hypocrisy in general where Hindutva members ramble around India while minorities are chastised simply for speaking out.  People talk about Sikhs ""modernizing"" and ""not being communal,"" if they just forget 1984 completely and are quiet about our identity.

Sikh,3c3as2,Protolore,7,Sat Jul 4 10:13:59 2015 UTC,"Good comments so far, I would also recommend viewing ""Basics of Sikhi"" on YouTube! One of the best resources I've come across for all things Sikhi-related, it has a lot of commonly asked questions for people looking to delve deeper into Sikhism.   Edit: spelling"
Sikh,3c3as2,Valiantay,3,Sat Jul 4 15:07:17 2015 UTC,Thank you! I don't know how I didn't think if YouTube.
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,3,Sat Jul 4 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"Thing about BasicsofSikhi is that he often passes his own opinions as the only opinion. I would be careful with some of his videos, particularly, videos on subjects like the afterlife and things like that.  All Sikhs agree on the basics of Sikh, so Ik Oankaar (the all-pervasive One, ultimate reality) and the teachings of the 10 Gurus and the Guru Granth Sahib.  There is variation within Sikhs on the extras of Sikhi.  The rest of the stuff is just extra. Things like your personal belief on the afterlife or diet are just extras and aren't important to Sikhi.  Sikhi is only concerned with getting you to live like a Sikh, other ""beliefs"" are not important."
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,2,Sat Jul 4 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"I had read a bit about that and wondered how personal beliefe worked. It seems like sikhi is the foundation and framework for life, and personal beliefs are the walls, windows, and doors. I will be sure to take the videos with a semblance of scepticism, learning for be is not just blind following, but finding my own way with guidance."
Sikh,3c3as2,Valiantay,2,Sat Jul 4 20:48:23 2015 UTC,"Sikhi is only concerned with enabling Sikhs to realise Waheguru.  Does belief in ghosts or an afterlife help to become a better Sikh? If it won't help your spirituallity, then it is irrelevant to Sikhi.  Sikhi is only concerned with providing a way of life to uplift you and to realise what you are.  Everything else are just extras and up to your own interpretation.  If you want to discuss afterlifes or ghosts, feel free to ask."
Sikh,3c3as2,Valiantay,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:02:18 2015 UTC,That is why I am so drawn to Sikhism. All that matters is getting the sikh closer to god. Evening else is up to the individual sikh so long as it helps him and avoids the 5 thieves. Its wonderful!
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,3,Sun Jul 5 21:32:10 2015 UTC,Do you recommend starting with any specific videos?
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,4,Sat Jul 4 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was brought up with Sikhi since childhood and knew a few things before discovering the channel. When I was younger, I would read 1 page of the SGGS Ji everyday until I completed it. When I stumbled upon the channel, I started with watching the street Parchar videos, then moved into the Japji Sahib katha videos - I would watch half a video each night until I finished the series. I think it'd be a fairly great way to start regardless though!"
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,2,Sat Jul 4 18:20:59 2015 UTC,I will likely do something similar. I have the SGGS now. I bought a copy yesterday before I was told not many sikhs have one in the home. I will probably read a little each day. And I will probably watch a video or at least most of one each night before bed.
Sikh,3c3as2,asdfioho,3,Sat Jul 4 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention that I read Guru Ji online at SriGranth.org. While there is nothing wrong at all keeping SGGS in your home, I must remind you that this is not like keeping a Bible or even Koran in your house. Guru Ji, while in scripture form, is still a king and should be treated as such. If you are not completely comfortable handling Guru Ji yet I would advise that you donate it to the local Gurdwara."
Sikh,3c3as2,asdfioho,2,Sun Jul 5 03:36:08 2015 UTC,It's actually a digital version on my phone. Now I feel weird about buying it though.
Sikh,3c3as2,asdfioho,2,Sun Jul 5 05:01:43 2015 UTC,"Thats fine.  I would be careful of English translations, a lot of the translations aren't the best. They often are riddled with Abrahamic views and sometimes can be mistranslated.  You always need to look for the deeper message of the shabad and to read the compositions in light of Sikh philosophy.  If the translation doesn't seem to be in line with Sikhi, then it probably is a translation error.  We are working on better translations and there are resources out there which are very good for understanding the compostions in SGGS.  I can point you towards these resources if you're interested."
Sikh,3c3as2,asdfioho,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"I would be very interested, thank you.   A bit of what I have read does seem a bit Abrahamic and I've noticed what I assume were translator errors based on what I know if the sikhi. I think I am still learning and understanding it on a deeper level though."
Sikh,3c3as2,asdfioho,2,Sun Jul 5 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that can be a real problem. I think our translations from the Japji Sahib commentary are a bit more free of the Abrhamic bias and language.  But like you said, what you know about Sikhi, always apply the philosophy and try to understand the overall message."
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"I think what I know of the sikhi is helping a lot. The odd translating might just be my own perception, but when Waheguru is referred to as The Lord Almighty it sounds very Abrahamic. But aside from that it seems alright. Just something odd here or there.  I have a question though, the SGGS I have had said that Waheguru created ask and all is preordained. But that doesn't make complete sense, because it seems like sikhism is about choice and the SGGS even talks about the choices of others that take then further from God. But of their actions are predetermined then why are they cursed to suffer and not join Waheguru in death?"
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,10,Mon Jul 6 03:17:51 2015 UTC,"Stick around /r/sikh, its a great place to learn about Sikhi.  You might want to give our Japji Sahib commentary a read. We're going to format it properly soon (we are currently doing work to make it into a proper resource), but the threads are a good place to start. Japji Sahib is the first composition of SGGS and it contains the basics of Sikh philosophy. So it might help to read it.  Best advice I can give you is to always contemplate bani. Sing it, listen to it, dive into the ocean of SGGS. The SGGS is all poetry and music, so hearing the words sung with music, is a great way to connect. Take a look at the kirtan posts here, we often post kirtan.  Always read SGGS, keep searching for the meaning of the bani. Keep reading and try to remember the Guru's message. Implement it in your life, let yourself become a beacon of the Guru's teachings.  Keep reading about Sikhi, keep reading SGGS and practice what the Guru says. Sikhi is something for life, the relationship with the Guru develops over a lifetime.  Bhai Gurdas Ji, is a prominent figure in Sikh history (contemporary of 3 Gurus). His work is said to be the key to the SGGS.  He writes this.  ਚਰਨ ਸ਼ਰਨਿ ਗੁਰ ਏਕ ਪੈਂਡਾ ਜਾਇ ਚਲ ਸਤਿਗੁਰ ਕੋਟਿ ਪੈਂਡਾ ਆਗੇ ਹੋਇ ਲੇਤ ਹੈ॥  charan saran gur eaek paiddaa jaae chal satgur kott paiddaa aagae hoe laeth hai ||   If you walk just one step towards the sanctuary of the Guru's feet, the Guru takes millions of steps to recieve you.   ਏਕ ਬਾਰ ਸਤਿਗੁਰ ਮੰਤ੍ਰ ਸਿਮਰਨ ਮਾਤ੍ਰ ਸਿਮਰਨ ਤਾਹਿ ਬਾਰੰਬਾਰ ਗੁਰ ਹੇਤ ਹੈ॥  eaek baar sathigur ma(n)thr simaran maathra simaran thaahi baara(n)baar gur haeth hai ||   One who remembers the True Guru's mantar (advice, teaching) just once, the Guru remembers that person again and again (milions of times).   Take the steps and walk the path. Thats what we all do.  I wouldn't buy a SGGS, Sikhs treat it with utmost respect and care. There are certain protocols and rules that we have agreed upon to care for SGGS. So the Gurdwara is the best place to see SGGS. Its very rare for Sikhs to keep SGGS in their home.  You can view it online and listen to it. We often have threads here where we discuss certain compositions from SGGS that you might be interested in.  I would definitely go to the Gurdwara. Even if it is to just sit in the Darbar (court room) Hall where the SGGS is and just meditate.  Get involved with the community, take part in seva (service). Help clean plates or serve food. There's something to do, just ask someone if you need help. /r/sikh is here if you need any help.  Do you understand Punjabi? Chances are, a lot of the older generation won't be able to communicate properly as most of them speak Punjabi. A lot of the services will also be in Punjabi. The younger generation will be able to communicate with you in English. The Gurdwara might run special days where the youth do programs in English, so you might want to ask the Gurdwara if there are English programs.  Get involved with community activities, some Gurdwaras go out and feed the homeless, try to find out if your Gurdwara does community work.  In terms of behaviour in the Gurdwara, remove your shoes before you go into the Darbar Hall (where SGGS is). Make sure you cover your head in the Gurdwara and don't take tobacco or alcohol into the Gurdwara."
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,7,Sat Jul 4 13:20:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this was so helpful. I am s little afraid of going to the Gurdwara because I don't know any punjabi, it is something I hope to learn though. I already live by many of the virtues of Sikhism to combat the 5 thrives, I'm practicing mediating, I practice seva when I can helping those around me however I can, I don't drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or do drugs, my own spiritual beliefs are exactly like those of Sikhism (that is the primary reason I feel so drawn to it), I belive in equality for all and promote it when I can, and I'm still learning. I love learning, it is very important to me to always be experiencing and learning new things. My only worry is that being accepted and practicing sikhism, especially if I am baptised in the future, is that I am a younger, white, American, and that I won't be taken seriously or won't be looked at as being as devout or a true sikh. That's why I have do many questions I guess, and was do concerned about being prepared to go to the Gurdwara. Your advice has really helped me though and I will be sure to learn more about the SGGS, I think it would help me greatly with meditation.  If you have any other advice for me please feel free to give it, I am only taking my first steps to becoming sikh, and I need all the help and support I can get."
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,4,Sat Jul 4 17:50:27 2015 UTC,"Some of the greatest Sikhs I met that brought me back to the path from atheism were white. I can speak for myself and pretty much all the Sikhs I know, if I saw a white person asking questions about Sikhi, or if I saw a white person in full bana, I and many of us would be more than happy to help. Just the other day Sikh sites were sharing news about a white man who was touring and meditating in all the Gurdwaras in India. /u/Amardas is an active member of the community here and is also a white Sikh.   Remember, Sikhi is not ideologically tied to Punjab, even though that's the social reality. Your beliefs are very much in line with the Sikh path, heck they're more so in line than when I ""re-converted"" in a sense, so I would definitely go ahead. This sub is an amazing resource for queries you may have, the people are especially friendly and knowledgable."
Sikh,3c3as2,Singh_Q6,2,Sat Jul 4 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"That is very reassuring. I know it is connected strongly to punjabi but isn't strictly punjabi, I jabber just never seen or heard of white sikhs. I was just worried I would be part of a large minority, or find it harder to receive help and guidance.   What is bana? Is that the 5ks? My hair is very short but I am growing it and, my also very short, beard out. Which would also make it hard to wear a comb, which I don't know where to get a nice wooden comb. I do love turbans and really would like one and to learn to wear one. I don't know the rules about kachera, but I can have those made for me by a seamstress I know if I knew the specifics of what makes them different from other shorts/how they are made. And I really don't know the rules for a Kirpan, how to wear it or where to get it. Otherwise I would dress as a sikh already. I don't have to be baptised to wear the 5Ks do I?"
Sikh,3c3as2,wazabee,3,Sat Jul 4 20:25:53 2015 UTC,"Bana is the 5 K's yes. Honestly it's really impressive you're ready to grow out your hair and beard already, it took me several years before I took the initiative to do so. For the kachera and kirpan it's honestly changed throughout the years and is somewhat flexible, but maybe you should make a separate post on the subreddit regarding it. You can technically wear the 5K's when not baptized, of course, that's why most ""sardars"" (Sikhs with long hair and turban) aren't actually baptized yet. Generally though, most unbaptized Sikhs that want the identity go with just the Kara and kesh.  There are a ton of turban tying tutorials online too, and lots of styles to choose from. Again, the white Sikhs I know also tie dapper turbans!"

Sikh,3c2r2l,DrunkenSikh,3,Sat Jul 4 05:27:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I disagree on most points. Here are my personal opinions as to why.   1) Sikh ""names”: what is a Sikh name? Obviously, some names have a root in Sikhi, such as Gurbaksh, Simran, or Gurpreet as mentioned in the video. But there’s no requirement for Sikhs to specifically have Sikh names. Many Sikhs when they take Amrit adopt more Sikh names; for example, 3HO members usually take full Sikh names, and Madho Das took the name “Gurbaksh” when he took Amrit (although we fondly remember him as Banda Singh). Most Muslims historically generally de-Islamicized their names when they took Amrit too, like Ajmer Singh, although it wasn’t mandated. However, there are plenty of Sikhs without Sikh names. Some of the Gurus had “Hindu” names. Guru Gobind Singh’s chotte sahibzade had Persian names, and his older sahibzade had generic Punjabi names. I have a Persian names (even though people say it’s a “Muslim name), and my father has a very popular name among Sikhs that’s actually a compound of two Hindu gods (anyone with “Inder” in their name has a Hindu root technically). Even Jagraj is not a specifically Sikh name. I am fully against kids trying to change their pronounciation to seem westernized, or getting nicknames; it shows insecurities, and as a Punjabi it’s embarrassing. As a Sikh? Who cares. We’re supposed to be multicultural; the beauty is that you can technically have a Peter Singh, because Singh and Kaur are the proper Sikh names. Too bad must of us forgo that in favor of our caste names (something I’m guilty of as well, at least legally). Many Sikh parcharaks mispronounce “Sikh” as well (it’s not “Seek”), I’d rather that get fixed first.  2) Chotte Sahibzade. I have never heard anyone say “this is scary for kids, let’s not show them.” The smashing success of the film about the Sahibzade is contrary to that observation. What I think she is referring to is how the Chotte Sahibzade’s martyrdom date falls on Christmas Eve. I know this because I have certain friends who decry how “weak” Sikhs have been because they celebrate Christmas on the day the Sahibzade were martyred. I disagree completely. Every single day technically marks a day some Shaheed was martyred. It is more important to remember their contributions in our everyday life than solely make it a tragic day once a year.   Eh, I don’t really feel strongly enough on the other issues to make particularly strong stances for them. But I think what’s killing Sikhi is a lot deeper than the issues mentioned in the video."
Sikh,3c2r2l,asdfioho,2,Sat Jul 4 23:34:36 2015 UTC,"Alterity was key to Guru Nanak's followers and was solidified by Guru Gobind Singh.   See Gurbani for instance. It posits itself as an alternative to Hindu and Muslim belief systems.   So I agree, BOS is doing exactly what Gurbani ordains."

Do you think in a multicultural society, we Sikhs tend to yield to the majority narrative, thus, extinguishing our own perspective on reality? For example, Diwali / Bandi Chor Diwas. In the BCD, we have a particular message to give. But the larger narrative of Diwali has a very different message from what we believe in and what we want to propagate.   Sometimes I feel like Sikhs don't care enough about Sikhi so they are ready to adopt non-Sikh narratives to blend in, which is counter to what Sikhi was always about. So I agree with hagiography, alterity is the key to orgs like BOS because it is the fundamental position propagated by Gurbani."

Sikh,3c14at,Drstro,12,Fri Jul 3 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"It is not prohibited. It is promoted, the Gurus encouraged Sikhs to live in society and to be active members of society. Unlike other religions, the Gurus preached that it is possible to realise Waheguru, while also living like everyone else.  However, they didn't force their Sikhs to have families or to get married.  One of the most celebrated Sikh writers and historians is Bhai Gurdas Ji, who was a contemporary of 3 Gurus. He was the scribe when Guru Arjan Dev Ji complied the first copy of SGGS. His writings are said to be the key to SGGS. So he is a very prominent person in Sikh history. He never married, but is a great example of a Sikh.  If you don't want to marry, you don't have to. However, the Gurus said that family and marriage is not a barrier to Waheguru and they encouraged it.  That being said, one night stands and multiple sexual relationships are discouraged."
Sikh,3c14at,Singh_Q6,2,Fri Jul 3 21:26:54 2015 UTC,"That being said, one night stands and multiple sexual relationships are discouraged.   I'm in no way arguing the point but why? Also does this mean it's OK to have a single sexual relationship?"

Having sex with random people just to satisfy yourself, I don't think that is what a Sikh should do."

Sikh,3c14at,bambin0,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:09:59 2015 UTC,"Nope, they never said anything about how many sexual partners you should have. Sri guru Granth sahib Ji does have a line that goes ""they are not husband and wife who merely sit together, they alone are husband and wife who are one light within one body."" That is used by many Sikhs but Guru sahib Ji is most likely talking about the light being a melding of the soul with God. Overall the Guru sahib didn't really tell anyone to do anything when it came to their beds other than implying that in a male dominated society men should control themselves and not rape their women."
Sikh,3c14at,Whitefang2536,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:27:40 2015 UTC,"The Gurus didn't practice polygamy. All the Gurus had one wife. A lot of our history has been written by British Christian missionaries who often didn't understand different cultures or practices.  Guru Gobind Singh Ji had one wife, who had two names. The second name was given by Mata Gujri.  The SGGS itself doesn't really talk about things like this. There is one quote that says both partners should have one light in two bodies. So it seems like the SGGS doesn't support polygamy.  Polygamy is also practiced to have lots of kids and have sex. In Sikhi marriage is not for sex or children, it is to have a close partner as your sangat, to support each other on the journey to Waheguru.  This is a good post."

This manuscript dates in part from the middle of the 17th century (c.1660-75), and is therefore one of the twenty oldest known copies in existence.

Sikh,3bxoni,pamcunt,11,Fri Jul 3 00:34:10 2015 UTC,"There is evidence yes. When guru Nanak when on his journeys there's records and even certain memorials in the villages he visited in the Middle East that attest to his arrival. There's even a letter in the Vatican archives that indicates guru Nanak even went to the pope or at least the pope was aware of his existence. A lot of records come from the Mughals. Like when Muslims first came into conflict with Sikh preaching there's records of the Mughal emperor asking to look at the earliest versions of the GGS just to see if there was anything disparaging about Muslims in it. Other guru's even went to his court and those instances are documented. Towards the latter end of the Guruship, when the Sikhs began to actively fight back, we have even more records of the battles and the guru's involvement. Around Guru Gobind Singh's time we even have European accounts. A European surgeon was the one that stitched him up after his assassination attempt. The guru's only started in the 15th/16th centuries and ended in the 18th centuries so it's not that hard to come by evidence that is so (relatively) recent. We even have Guru Gobind Singh's armor and the descendants of the gurus still live.   The problem comes, as you've pointed out, when myth and history are mixed. The Sikh teaching is to not actually believe in superstition. Guru Nanak especially preached against people who had supposed magical and miraculous powers. Like the story that when Guru Nanak met the Hindus who were throwing water towards the sun so it could reach their ancestors he started throwing the water the other way saying ""if this water can reach all the way to the sun then it can water my fields in Punjab"" he was very no nonsense in believing stuff like that. There's verses in the Guru Granth Sahib that follow the same train of thought. So any Sikh that does believe the Gurus had magical powers are actually believing in something that is against Sikhi! Though that doesn't stop rumors from spreading. I think a lot of these stories just started off as things the guru's actually did to be symbolic but eventually they became the stuff of legend. Every story I heard growing up that had the guru's being magic I also heard a version that was realistic.   The story of guru Nanak in Mecca. When he put his feet towards the Kaaba and he told the Muslim priest to move his feet where God was not, one version said the Kaaba magically followed wherever the priest moved his feet while another version said the priest just moved his feet and left. He was trying to make the point that God is everywhere and not in just some one place.   The story of guru Gobind Singh killing the panj piyare and bringing them back to life. I've heard versions where instead of killing them he actually sliced the heads of goats and another version where he just mixed dye into the water that turned it red to make his sword look bloodied. At the end of the day he was just trying to look for people so dedicated they would die for the cause.   The more symbolic stories could be the flower story you mentioned. I suspect that was just meant to symbolically show guru nanak's position on both Muslims and Hindus.   Even the more outlandish stories where the guru's or pious Sikhs didn't react when being cut apart or boiled alive, etc could have a real world explanation. There's been accounts of people in deep deep meditative states taking huge amounts of pain and torture with no reaction. A similar thing could've happened here.   Having faith in Sikhi is not that same thing as having faith in other religions like Christianity. Faith in Christianity is believing whole heartedly that Christ did his miracles as part of his divinity. Among other aspects. This does not exist in Sikhi. Faith in Sikhi is believing in waheguru and following in the path of the guru's which includes not believing in bullshit miracles because miracles distract from more important messages like loving and protecting everyone and treating everyone equally.   But in the end, Sikhi is a pragmatic, realistic faith. We're no nonsense. We don't except things like magic or miracles or things like that. Guru Nanak preached against it. But like anything else great people are always mythologized after their deaths. Especially as more time goes by. I mean Jesus and Mohammed were most certainly real people who preached but obviously they didn't do things like walk on water or come back from the dead. That's always been a slight problem I Sikhi. That the guru's preached against believing in miracles and religious literalism but there will always be people that do those things. I guess the main take always are that yes the guru's did exist but their ""magic"" was just legends and rumors and not even most Sikhs themselves believe.   All these stories were told to me by my grandmother and I will never forget that she would tell me ""these are just stories. They hold lessons and truths but they themselves are not true. Sometimes some people, like kids or uneducated, need these stories to begin learning about Sikhi. No Sikh who truly understands the guru's would believe them. Not even the gurus"""

Sikh,3bxoni,pickledpie,3,Fri Jul 3 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"Here's what I've read, it's pretty well sourced. The reason this is more plausible is because the Gurdwara was built by Hari Singh Nalwa, and the handprint ONLY started getting mention then. It's similar to how if there was a Sakhi about how Guru Arjun Dev Ji touched Harimandir Sahib and it  all turned to gold and marble, we may say ""see it's like that now,"" even though the gold and marble was put in place by Maharaja Ranjit Singh even if Darbar Sahib existed.   Regarding Siddhas like Padmasambhava, no, I don't believe those are genuine either. Yogis used to float as well. I admit I am pretty absolute in my belief  that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The kicker for me is that scientific explanations for ""miracles"" follow into and can hold up in the modern day, while miracles seem to have somehow dried up in the age of video cameras and the scientific method. So called miracle workers have been making fools of people for too long."

Each person's understanding is different, I respect your view and understand why you have it, but my own differs and I've only come to my understanding through some deep contemplation and analysis. If one sees into the nature of consciousness itself, one will realize that it itself is what forms the world. Those who recognize their true nature and enshrine the ultimate in their hearts are masters over maya and are unbound by it. When you dream you can do incredible and impossible things, when you wake up from the dream of maya, you can also do incredible and impossible things. I am secure in my understanding."
Sikh,3bxoni,pickledpie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:00:02 2015 UTC,"I mean that's great that you're so secure in that understanding. But what you're saying is pretty much the exact opposite of what any of the Guru's have said. There's never been any saying or verses that mention understanding maya to have control over it. At that point you're starting to sound like the frauds that existed during the Guru's time. Yeah part of the message is that believing in miracles is distracting but the other half is that it's just plain wrong. Sikhi is the path of truth. It's right there in SAT Sri akal. The guru's realized that there is no truth in magic or miracles. Like another poster said. Why were miracles so ubiquitous hundreds of years ago yet there don't exist now that camera and scientific methods are more prominent? People will believe what they want to believe but deep contemplation is just a buzzword to say ""I believe in miracles and won't say otherwise"". I mean just to address your example. You ever see the handprint that guru Nanak supposedly made? It doesn't even look like a real hand! It looks like a cartoon for crying out loud! It damn sure doesn't look big enough to be the hand of a fully grown adult."

The Guru's said not to display these powers, not that they don't exist. The greatest miracle is enshrining the lord in your heart, but your belief that they are not real is not what the Guru's said or believed."
Sikh,3bxoni,pickledpie,4,Fri Jul 3 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"I actually have read the Guru Granth Sahib. Multiple times. As well as it's analysis by Sikh scholars. And like everything else in the GGS the verses you pointed towards are poetic and metaphorical.   The Guru Granth Sahib also mentions Shiva, Brahma and Indra exist and sing the praises of waheguru. Does that mean that Sikhs or the guru's believe in the existence of these deities? The nine treasures you speak of? Yeah those are literal things that Hindus used to say you could obtain. They were things like silk or rich food. The guru's are saying those material things are provided by God when you believe in him and either way material things never last.   The entire Guru Granth Sahib was written poetically and metaphorically. The first 5 Guru's were trained musicians. Think of the Guru Granth Sahib as a song. It's not literal.   The explanation that's been put forward about the impetus against miracles has to do with God and Maya. Maya is an emanation of God right? So if we used magic to bend Maya and control Maya that means we would be controlling a part of God which is impossible. That's one of the reasons we're taught not to inflict violence upon others unnecessarily because they are part of God just as much as we are so hurting them is tantamount to hurting God. When the guru's say God gives you the power to control Maya they didn't mean that God gives you magic. They mean that because you have meditated on waheguru you see past Maya. The veil of illusion is lifted. You have power over Maya because YOU REALIZE MAYA IS AN ILLUSION. it's a cliche but knowledge is power. You know Maya isn't real so you it doesn't control you. You have power and control over it. You see past the illusion of Maya so you see all the magic of the siddha' we're just tricks. Illusions. That's why you have their power.   God is truth. And that truth gives you the power of the Siddha's because you see past the illusion. You went down the rabbit hole. You can't go train under a Siddhi and gain powers because you acknowledge they don't have those powers. The guru's did that all the time. They called out the fake powers of siddhis, and magicians and priests because they saw past the veil. They had power over them. That's what the Guru Granth Sahib is saying. It's not literal. If it was we would acknowledge the existence of Hindu gods and spirits and angels and demons.   Heck the verses you mention even say that will that power none of it matters without God. That God is where the truth lies. So if God is where the truth lies what does that make the powers of the siddhis? Lies. That's the point he is making. When guru Nanak was preaching his listeners would understand his references when he speaks of the siddhis, and the nine treasures, and the holy places of pilgrimage. As time went one we have lost what these referred to because we don't here those stories anymore.   Sikhi is a pragmatic religion. We don't take nonsense. Belief in literal miracles and magic, especially those instances that have been refuted by science, is completely counter to the ideas of Sikhi.   I mean do you seriously believe Waheguru came down on Garuda to same Naam Dayv? First off Waheguru isn't anthropomorphic. He isn't a person or thing that can fly on a giant eagle monster. Waheguru is the essence of the universe that transcends it. There's no way he could get on an eagle. And you can't pick and choose and say one parts of the Guru Granth Sahib are literal and some are metaphorical. That's not how it works.   You keep saying we need to be open to research without bias yet that's exactly what we are doing. Research without bias is called science. There's a reason that things like miracles have never been reproduced in sterile lab conditions. The more you keep coming up here and saying that the power of consciousness is not understood and limitless you start sounding like Deepak Chopra."
Sikh,3bxoni,ash8795,0,Fri Jul 3 21:33:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on all of this, except that they are alluded to only metaphorically. There's so much history that talks about spiritual powers and even now there are monks who achieve rainbow body and we have proof of that, where their bodies shrink and sometimes disappear or only leave behind teeth and nails in a number of days. I'm seeing a tradition and belief that has held up for a long time being denounced as false but the evidence supports miracles. Look through history, look through other traditions. When one awakens and becomes lucid in the dream of maya, they can do incredible things."

In the example you gave, both Hindu's and Muslims laid claim to Guru Nanaks body and what most likely happened is that Guru Ji's body was secretly cremated or buried in order to avoid conflict amongst other reasons. Some of his possessions were then given to the Hindu's and Muslims to cremate or bury in place of the body. The truth of those events was never revealed but based on the facts, that is what most likely happened. Its ridiculous to think the Guru's did not exist because of a few exaggerated stories."

For example Guru Arjan Dev jee sat on a hot tuvi (plate) there was a priest from portigual Jerome Xavier who  spoke who guru jee sat on the hot plate in bliss.  Ab-Ul-Tarani a muslim spy talks about how he witnessed guru gobind singh jee taking the head off bhai daya singh jee during the first amritsanchar.  The Guru, in front of the whole congregation, struck Daya Ram's head off with the sword and severed it from the body. The audience was stunned and speechless.

Sikh,3bxoni,Singh_Q6,2,Fri Jul 3 01:07:30 2015 UTC,Another variation of the birth of Khalsa story is that the miraculous event you detailed didn't happen. What happened instead was Guru Gobind took each of the panj pyare into his tent and then butchered a goat he had hidden inside. He then came out of the tent with his sword covered in goats blood which gave the impression that he had beheaded each of the panj pyrare. Later the panj pyare came out of the tent dressed in new clothes akin to Guru Gobind and wore the panj kakkars.
Sikh,3bxoni,SkepticSikh,2,Fri Jul 3 05:31:02 2015 UTC,I would say that story is bullshit too.  Would our Gurus honestly take another beings life just to prove a point or to do a trick?  The SGGS criticises the pracitice of ritually slaughtering animals (halal and kosher) and doing sacrifices.  Do you think our Guru would do that?

In all honesty, nobody really knows what went on in that tent, and it shouldn't matter.

We're never gonna know what happened but personally I don't believe any of the supernatural stuff such as him actually killing the people then raising them from the dead which is why I go with the goat story.

I drop all support for this dude if he is being violent with a simple debate. No thanks bro, you look worse than the preacher now. link"
Sikh,3bvv3v,SirMize,3,Thu Jul 2 19:59:46 2015 UTC,I appreciate his passion.
Sikh,3bvv3v,DrunkenSikh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"I think sometimes you need to respond with strength IMO. From what I saw, his response shows that Sikhs are strong and are willing to defend all.  He doesn't go on the offensive, he responded to all the lies the Pastor spread about Sikhi.   But again, this is just my opinion.   Edit - please watch the video entirely before coming to those conclusions. The pastor's comments are what create violence and racism towards us. And yes, we will crush anyone who dares to touch our hair, just as our forefather's defended themselves for us to be alive today."
Sikh,3bvv3v,SirMize,2,Thu Jul 2 20:08:55 2015 UTC,check the link I put up and let me know how that makes you feel
Sikh,3bvv3v,SirMize,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"Well as a sikh I will definitely won't crush anyone who touches my hair, nor would the Gurus. Someone can bad mouth me and Sikhism all they want, I am always going to act in a peaceful way, I would never threaten to crush someone. The only time violence is ever a consideration to me is when someone is trying to hurt someone else physically, then I will respond. I get that ideal from the Guru's specifically.  Point of Sikhism is to realize we are all equal the same, the light of life in us is no different than anyone else regardless of who they are or what they do. Don't get that upset and use threats of violence, its unbecoming. He has tied his ego to Sikhism, which is one of the Five thieves. He has made Sikhism his worldly attachment. Just like Nanak said there is no Hindu there is no Muslim. What we forgot in that same tenement there is also no Sikh. God is not sikh, the universe is not sikh, and even sikhs are not sikh we are greater and bigger than that.   So in a debate to say you are going to crush someone undermines your intellectual points. Its great that he is passionate, all his points are valid and well thought out, but some of his remarks are immature and violent, and in IMO this not a good representation of how a Sikh should act. Hey no one is perfect, I'm sure he is a nice guy, he is passionate, and he got carried away, but my point being is, he got carried away."
Sikh,3bvv3v,SirMize,2,Thu Jul 2 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"As you said, ""The only time violence is ever a consideration to me is when someone is trying to hurt someone else physically, then I will respond.""  I'll tell you this, if I touch your turban/cut your hair, I'm sure you would react appropriately. We are supposed to be sant-sipahis, warrior saints."
Sikh,3bvv3v,ordinaryrendition,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"Simply touching my Turban is not a call to arms. Too cut my hair would be a cruel thing to do. That doesn't mean I get to crush you, and that doesn't mean you have the Guru's permission to beat someone up, potentially injure them for life, or even worse kill them. That is not Sikhi, that is your ego, and your pride. Which mind you, there are hundred of lines in the SGGS about eliminating your pride and keeping you ego in check. Its not like the Pastor in the other video said he was going to crush Sikhs for having long hair.   When then Guru sacrificed his life he did it for someone else. More importantly he did it to protect people who weren't even Sikh. So they could live freely and in peace. Those Tyrants cut his hair, did the Guru jump up and start fighting them no he did not. He let others kill him so other people could worship their religion (a religion different from his own) freely. He was killed, he knew he was being killed, and even then he did not act with any violence. Because if you can put yourself in the way and keep others from hurting each other, that is Sikhi. Sikhi is NOT, telling someone you will crush them for touching your hair.  Edit: I also want to say I am glad you posted this video, and we are having this discussion I think its important in Sikhism to discuss our philosophies on the religion. I just want to clarify that I not necessary disagreeing with him just the way he presents himself and a few of his remarks. And most definitely I have no issue with you OP. I too myself am a Southern American Sikh."
Sikh,3bvv3v,ordinaryrendition,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:37:59 2015 UTC,"It seems like he redid the video.  I agree with you on violence, however, I do not think he was suggesting to crush him for simply just touching his turban. Yes, as Sikhs we must stay non-violent, but at the same time we must stand up for the truth, we are warrior-saints, and have used the sword to protect ourselves and others."
Sikh,3bvv3v,shortpaleugly,6,Mon Jul 6 18:03:02 2015 UTC,"I sort of hate his style and use of language. Yes, this is a response, but it's soooo reactionary. The language he uses is deeply Christianized. Like when he says a Sikh following everything 100% is a beacon of light to his community. People will say 'I want my son to be like that, and I want my daughter to marry someone like that.' Uhhhhh, Sikhs are people of both genders. A Sikh following everything 100% is not necessarily a male, and the use of this language as the default is entrenched in his surrounding Christianity and his Southern US culture. We need to drive our own narrative and our own language use. Pronounce Sikh properly. Don't speak about our religion in relation or comparison to other religions. Speak about our beliefs as they are.  And to seem agreeable, he quotes bible passages as the truth. The bible is pretty demonstrably full of bullshit. Again, reactionary, and giving wayyyy too much ground by accepting things that aren't true just to say they're both men of god and how both religions are great and correct, etc. Simply not true."
Sikh,3bvv3v,noruh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"You do know that he is responding to a Pastor right? He's not creating this video for himself. He uses Bible quotes to bring the Pastor into the light who mocked and insulted the Gurus and Sikhi.   In no way is his response saying only a male is a beacon of light, I think you might be misunderstanding his message. Did you even watch the entire video?"
Sikh,3bvv3v,Piranha2004,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:14:38 2015 UTC,"I watched about 15 minutes of it, and I stand by what I said. I specifically acknowledged ""yes, this is a response, but"" in my earlier comment. The response to other beliefs does not need to cater to their own, especially when the nature of our message gets distorted in the translation.  Things like referring to Waheguru in the SGGS as ""He"" or ""Himself"" or other such Abrahamic crap influences. It forces us to speak their language to explain our complex ideas, the true nature of which get lost when we look to them as the default method of expressing religious ideas."
Sikh,3bvv3v,shortpaleugly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:25:27 2015 UTC,"You are stooping to the level of the Pastor when you call it crap.   Also, the Gurus used terms and languages in the people they were speaking to. Different Bhagats who spoke different languages and in different religions have their bani in Gurmukhi in the SGGS.   If you watched the video entirely you will hear him quote the SGGS, ""the Bible, Koran, and Vedas are not false, false are the ones who don't contemplate them"", which is written in the SGGS.  Stay united bro, especially when one or all of us are attacked. We're Sikh brothers and sisters!!"

And I'm glad the message of truth is being spread about us. We as Sikhs should always be willing to sacrifice for truth and for others.    Whoever watches the entire video will realize his response was very positive for Christians, Sikhs, and others. I'm not here to argue, just trying to post something positive for us all.

Sikh,3bs4ln,Singh_Q6,2,Wed Jul 1 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"I always had trouble understanding this passage, can anyone expand on this for me?"
Sikh,3bs4ln,SirMize,2,Wed Jul 8 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"I think it is an expansion of pauri 2.  Essentially I think the message is that everything is within the hukam. For many things, we cannot do anything ourselves. Only Waheguru has the power to allow us to do anything. When someone is dead, they cannot speak.  Even speaking and moving is happening according to the hukam, there is nothing outside of it. Nothing can violate the hukam.  I guess it is like a river.  We are like the fish caught in the river, the river will follow a certain path, it will go the way it wants. The fish cannot control the river.  The fish can struggle to escape the current or to change the route, but ultimately, the fish has no power to change anything. It is beyond its control.  Earlier in Japji Sahib, it said that Waheguru cannot be bribed, it can't be forced to give us things. So we have no power to recieve or give.  Without Waheguru we haven't got the ability to do anything.  Whatever we are, is the result of the sat, the river current which carries us.  Essentially, everyone is within the river current, everyone is the sat. So there is no high or low, no one is better than anyone else."
Sikh,3bs4ln,SirMize,2,Wed Jul 8 21:04:31 2015 UTC,"Alright so If I am understanding correctly, this is more about the relationship between us the living things, and waheguru/the universe. We have no control over the universe.   But I can give and receive with my fellow living things, I do have control over myself, correct? Or am I misunderstanding again?"

I had a lot of people be intruiged by it and at best it was a conversation point from their perspective, which allowed me to talk about Sikhi with the guys at the house.   Remember the core though: Why do you keep the hair? Who manifests in our universe that you acknowledge as the final sovereignty? Who gave you the order to keep the hair and why do you follow that order? The rest, then, becomes trivial.   /u/MalmenMannen is right on point."

Sikh,3bflrv,ChardiKala,5,Sun Jun 28 20:06:36 2015 UTC,"Hey man hear me out. Your parents are right this will pass, but it's all in your hands. You're obviously suffering from low self esteem. I too was in your boat for a long time (sardar with acne and overweight). I though exactly what you did, no girls will like you. Heres the thing though waheguru always has a plan. I realized that if I wanted to get out of my depression I would have to CHANGE myself and not sit around in sorrow. I began excersing and changed my diet. At the same time I cut out all things that led to my lifestyle (junk food and video games).   Girls. Dont worry about them they will come with time. Honestly when dealing with depression the best thing to do is to avoid comparing your self to others. It only leads to more sorrow. You need to focus on self improvement in order to build self esteem and confidence.   School-wise Idk what your situation is but if you're in college like me you only need to focus on two things as of right now : self improvement and education. Friends, like girls will come with time on their own, often both from classes. If you're working focus on that.   Focus on these things and waheguru will always assist you in your goals. Also try meditation, simply repeating waheguru in a quiet place can help clear your head of negative thoughts.   Good luck on your journey fellow khalsa! WJKK WJKK."

Sikh,3bcjjk,Singh_Q6,12,Sat Jun 27 22:45:48 2015 UTC,My first reaction reading this... This... Is... Awesome. Seriously it sent chills down my spine.
Sikh,3bcjjk,Dragearen,6,Sun Jun 28 06:02:54 2015 UTC,From what I understand that quote was recorded by scribes at Akbar's court so I think it's fairly well attested.   I found the same quotes in a bunch of books just using google so I'd say its most likely this is a genuine quote. Or at least he said something to that effect.
Sikh,3bcjjk,ash8795,4,Sun Jun 28 04:47:11 2015 UTC,"Take special note of what he said about special diets, languages, and dresses, something 99% of Sikhs are pissing on today by turning our religion into essentially a punjabi caste."
Sikh,3bcjjk,GosuJaz,3,Sun Jun 28 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"I love this quote. It sets Sikhi out as something distinct and makes a point about the absurdity in other religions. Heck, it makes a point about the absurdity of the beliefs and practises of modern day Sikhs."
Sikh,3bcjjk,SkepticSikh,2,Sun Jun 28 08:08:36 2015 UTC,We have unhealthy expectations of other people. Our Guru expounds the sublime amrit bani. Become attuned and see how real.
Sikh,3bcjjk,pickledpie,2,Sun Jun 28 04:54:32 2015 UTC,"Nice find! Based on some basic searching around, the incident definitely happened, but I don't know about the quote-perhaps if there is the original Punjabi it would clear things up. One thing is for sure...Jahangir attacked Guru Arjun Dev Ji on much the same grounds in his Janahangirnama, and high caste Khatris and Brahmins in Delhi made similar complaints against Guru Gobind Singh after the birth of the Khalsa. Goes to show the message of the ten Gurus had consistency."
Sikh,3bcjjk,asdfioho,2,Sun Jun 28 13:46:00 2015 UTC,"Forgive me for my lack of knowledge however isn't the bit regarding the special diets and what to eat sort of counterintuitive to the idea of not eating meat, and being purely vegetarian?"
Sikh,3bcjjk,PetterrrPann,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:46:56 2015 UTC,"The talk of special diets is in reference to people subscribing to a particular diet to improve their spirituality.   If a religion or person said don't eat this or that, or be a vegetarian to be a better person spiritually or to get in heaven then that's wrong.   To be a vegetarian because you are against killing animals for food or just because you dislike meat then that's fine. Just don't bring religion/spirituality into matters such as diet or clothes."
Sikh,3bcjjk,SkepticSikh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:54:43 2015 UTC,"I think I might be misunderstanding you. Based on what you said, diets should have absolutely no contribution to religion therefore how can the sikh religion have values based on not eating meat? Sorry if I'm being idiotic."
Sikh,3bcjjk,PetterrrPann,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:20:46 2015 UTC,There isn't a reason to be a veggie other than your own choice. Just don't use the gurus to justify your choice. You want to kill to eat then you want to kill to eat. Whether it's animal or veggies you're still killing and you're still returning to the cycle of life either way lol.
Sikh,3bcjjk,Whitefang2536,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:45:49 2015 UTC,Sikhi doesn't dictate what you should and shouldn't eat. As a Sikh you are free to eat meat or not eat meat for your own personal reasons. Just don't try to justify your decision by saying that you're a better person spiritually etc for doing so.
Sikh,3bdsak,pickledpie,2,Sun Jun 28 07:05:31 2015 UTC,I thought people would love this. I mean it's a real and vivid description of Sikhs by Sir Charles Wilkins in 1781(I think? I haven't actually verified). It excited me to no end.
Sikh,3bdsak,DrunkenSikh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"solemnly pronounced a long prayer or kind of liturgy, at certain periods of which all the people joined in a general response, saying Wa Gooroo.4 They prayed against temptation; for grace to do good; and for the general good of mankind;   Amazing. Sometimes I don't give enough credit to the Rehat Maryada.    That the founder of their faith was called Naneek Sah,   Intriguing. When did the whole ""Dev"" part start creeping in?   before his apostasy, was a Hindoo of the Kshetry or military tribe; and that his body disappeared as the Hindoos and Mussulman were disputing for it, for upon their removing the cloth that covered it, it was gone. That he left behind him a book, composed by himself,8 in verse and the language of Punjab, but a character partly of his own invention,   Very interesting.    I asked them what were the ceremonies used in admitting a proselyte. A person having shown a sincere inclination to renounce his former opinions, to any five or more Seeks assembled together, in any place, as well on the highway as in a house of worship, they send to first shop where sweetmeats are sold and procure a small quantity of a particular sort which is very common, and as I recollect, they call Batasa, and having diluted it in pure water, they sprinkle some of it on the body, and into the eyes of the: convert, whilst one of the best instructed repeats to him in any languages with which he is conversant the chief cannons of their faith, exacting from him a solemn promise to abide by them the rest of his life. This is the whole of the ceremony.   Also very interesting."
Sikh,3ba46x,likeabous,7,Sat Jun 27 06:07:09 2015 UTC,I think that depends on the families and the gurudwara's. There's nothing in Sikhi or the Guru Granth Sahib that bans homosexuality but you know how conservative the older generation can be. Most of them don't approve of interracial dating/marriage let alone same sex relations. If the families don't mind and the gurudwara doesn't mind then yeah I don't see how it wouldn't happen. Though it might be a long time coming. I know he first Hindu same sex wedding ceremony took place fairly recently in California so it might be a little while.
Sikh,3ba46x,ash8795,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:12:04 2015 UTC,Isn't interracial marriage frowned upon in the GGS anyways?
Sikh,3ba46x,ItzTwitNit,2,Wed Jul 1 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"What?  Interracial means between different races. That isn't a problem in Sikhi. Anyone can be a Sikh, race doesn't matter."
Sikh,3ba46x,Singh_Q6,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, worded that wrong. I meant between Sikhs and non-Sikhs."
Sikh,3ba46x,ItzTwitNit,2,Wed Jul 1 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"Again nope. Sikhs can marry whomever they wish regardless of race, caste, religion or sex. The controversy begins if a Sikh can marry a non-Sikh in Sikh wedding ceremony in the temple. Some temple will allow it. Some won't. Kinda like how Catholics can marry non Catholics but you can't really do it in the church. Or at least that's what I was told."
Sikh,3ba46x,ash8795,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:51:39 2015 UTC,"Hm, I was under the impression that the Rehat Maryada said that Sikhs can only marry other Sikhs."
Sikh,3ba46x,ItzTwitNit,3,Wed Jul 1 22:39:33 2015 UTC,"The rehat very well might. But I was just saying what's in the GGS. Plus the rehat was created by normal people so it is influenced by the prominent Indian attitudes of the time. It's a double edged sword. You get the benefit of standardizing wedding and religious ceremonies but you also get weird prohibitions like how in the past it prohibited fraternizing with ""Turks"" and stuff like that. Plus there's a lot of Sikhs that believe the rehat only applies to the Khalsa and not other Sikhs. Ultimately I, and I think a lot of other people on this subreddit, defer to the GGS over the rehat."

Sikh,3ba46x,ahundredgrand,3,Sat Jun 27 10:19:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. They can get married, but I don't think the anand karaj is meant for that kind of thing. What is this thing called ""marriage"" anyway? It's just an institution we made up ourselves. I don't see why you have to be bound by it. Why not just be gay and have like an ultimate homo friendship instead of calling it a marriage?"
Sikh,3ba46x,pickledpie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:50:17 2015 UTC,"I agree about your point when you say ""what is this thing called marriage anyway"" however why deny a gay couple an anand karaj? To promote equality, gay couples should be allowed to have an anand karaj if they want one."
Sikh,3ba46x,SkepticSikh,2,Sun Jun 28 07:09:51 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't make sense. The ceremony was made for just a man and a woman, I don't have a single thing against gay people, I love gay peoples, I just don't think anand karaj is really meant for that kind of thing."
Sikh,3ba46x,pickledpie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:11:56 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source for the claim that the ceremony was made for just a man and a woman?    The laavan do not reference a man and a woman, as I recall. There is the general concept of a marriage between two people, bringing together two parts of one soul.    Further, the laavan is primarily a guide for a person's relationship to Waheguru, not to the spouse.  This being the case, if any two Sikhs wish to pursue their lives together and to abide by the laavan and Rehat Mariyada, should it matter whether they are both men or women?"
Sikh,3ba46x,bjnsnh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like the whole idea of marriage existing in the first place had to do with having children. Why else would you have a monogamous relationship between a man and a woman? If there's no children then why even get married? A marriage begets something, and it's always between two oposite principles, male and female. I feel like marriage is just a made up institution in the first place, it's kind of meant to be between man and women. If you look at homosexuality in the past, homosexuals never got married, they were more like friends. Also, there was a lot of homosexuals in the past and was pretty accepted like in greece and japan."
Sikh,3ba46x,pickledpie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:13:10 2015 UTC,"Sikhi marriage is for sangat. The couple are supossed to support each others Sikhi and be there for each other.  Look at our Gurus and their spouses. Mata Khivi, Guru Angad Dev Ji's wife has a special shabad which talks about her, this is extremely rare in SGGS. Even the Gurus don't talk about themselves. Mata Khivi played an incredibly important role in the early Sikh community and helped her partner to develop Guru Nanak Dev Ji's foundations and strengthened them."
Sikh,3ba46x,Singh_Q6,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:29:06 2015 UTC,So do you agree that anand karaj should be done for gay couples?
Sikh,3ba46x,pickledpie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"So a man and a woman who do not wish to have any children should not marry?  How about a man and a woman who only wish to adopt?  Or how about a couple who suffer from infertility?  Marriage existing only for children is a very common argument that I feel is unfounded. And just to note, the laavan do not mention children either.  Wanting a life partner without having children seems perfectly reasonable to me.  Marriage is a made up institution.  No question.  So why does that made up institution need to be so rigid?  Anand Karaj (or any religious marriage ceremony for that matter) is an ceremony that holds much importance for many Sikhs.  Denying homosexual couples from marrying in the Gurdwara denies a portion of our community from partaking in this special event.  Some marriage institutions do specify that only a man and woman can marry.  However (and please contradict me if I am incorrect), Sikhi does not make this restriction in the laavan (or anywhere else).  So saying ""it's kinda meant to be between a man and a woman"" sounds like a rather flimsy argument.  As for the history of homosexual unions, a quick search on wikipedia (without looking into the references) yields the following:   A same-sex union was known in Ancient Greece and Rome,[2] ancient Mesopotamia,[3] in some regions of China, such as Fujian province, and at certain times in ancient European history.[4] These same-sex unions continued until Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire.  Same-sex marital practices and rituals were more recognized in Mesopotamia than in ancient Egypt. The Almanac of Incantations contained prayers favoring on an equal basis the love of a man for a woman and of a man for man.[6]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_unions  I do not wish to simply contradict everything you say - that is not my aim.  I have no strong views on the matter, and would not have a problem if it were more commonplace.  But if we're going to deny a group of people of a religious custom, I want to have a strong argument for it, in this case based on the SGGS."
Sikh,3ba46x,bjnsnh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"The reason is that, I feel the original expression of homosexuality in human civilization was a more holistic and natural emanation of human interactions and society. I think the marriage aspect of a same sex relationship is unnatural and fetters the natural expression of human sexuality. Honestly, homosexuality should be like how it was in earlier civilizations. Honestly, I think our current civilization is fucked."
Sikh,3ba46x,pickledpie,2,Wed Jul 1 01:00:19 2015 UTC,I certainly hope so.
Sikh,3ba46x,Dragearen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:54:08 2015 UTC,I think a [3HO] Gurdwara already performed one. I think in most Gurdwaras it'll be one or two generations and the leadership change with that before we start seeing Anand Karaj's being performed for SS couples.

Sikh,3b9viz,asdfioho,2,Tue Jun 30 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just was wondering because of your previous comment about your problem with ""Westernized"" Sikhi. Most Sanatanis I know would also say that the scope of Sikhi is greater than solely the philosophy enshrined in GGS, and that modern Sikhi is westernized to fit a Christian model of religion (which they call neo-Sikhi). Personally, I believe Sikhi and Hinduism are pretty distinct, but I think people would be more willing to listen to your views if you talked about them directly instead of alluding to this subreddit's particular western bias or such without being specific.

Sikh,3b3r6d,asdfioho,2,Fri Jun 26 01:01:27 2015 UTC,"Recitation. I urge you to listen to this as reciting the bani gives it a whole different dimension. It will also help you understand my points here,  ਇਕ ਦੂ ਜੀਭੌ ਲਖ ਹੋਹਿ ਲਖ ਹੋਵਹਿ ਲਖ ਵੀਸ ॥  ik dū jeebhau lakh hōh lakh hōveh lakh vees.  ਲਖੁ ਲਖੁ ਗੇੜਾ ਆਖੀਅਹਿ ਏਕੁ ਨਾਮੁ ਜਗਦੀਸ ॥  lakh lakh gērhāa ākheeah ēk nāam jagdees .  The pauri starts off with a sweet underlying sentiment. The repetition of ""ees"" throughout the pauri help us develop a flow in our mind. But the beginning shows the magnitude of the quantity the Guru is talking about (""lakh lakh"" with necessary breaks). Contrast this to the Mool Mantar which is deliberate and sharp throughout. The Mool Mantar cannot be said lightly. It does not flow. It is designed to bring our focus onto what we are saying. In this pauri though, the flow makes it roll of the tongue easily.  And behold, the hukam was such that the bani attests to this. Not only was this pauri declared in an easy to say verse (""ees""), the pauri itself self reflects and says so what? Even if we had millions of tongues and even if this pauri was easy to recite, the highest pauri  is:  ਏਤੁ ਰਾਹਿ ਪਤਿ ਪਵੜੀਆ ਚੜੀਐ ਹੋਇ ਇਕੀਸ ॥  ēt rāh pat pavarheeaa charheeai hōi ikees .

It cannot be found by just climbing mountains, or withdrawing to monastries and forests. A constant message in Japji Sahib up to this pauri has been ""the priceless jewel is within you"".  Guru Nanak Dev Ji has used the imagery of ""steps"" and climbing in this pauri.  Japji Sahib's verses are called pauris, which means steps. Each of these steps help on our spiritual journey. Japji Sahib can be considered to be a map which helps you to climb to the summit, to merge with the One.  ਜਿਨ੍ਹ੍ਹਾ ਨ ਵਿਸਰੈ ਨਾਮੁ ਸੇ ਕਿਨੇਹਿਆ ॥  Jinhaa N Visarai Naam Sae Kinaehiaa ||  What are they like - those who do not forget the Naam?  ਭੇਦੁ ਨ ਜਾਣਹੁ ਮੂਲਿ ਸਾਂਈ ਜੇਹਿਆ ॥੧॥  Bhaedh N Jaanahu Mool Saanee Jaehiaa ||1||  Know that there is absolutely no difference; they are exactly like the Master. ||1||  By constantly contemplating upon Waheguru, doing what the Guru tells us to do, there will be no difference. As understanding of Waheguru and bani develops, the wall between Waheguru is broken.  Just by chanting however, the stairs cannot be climbed.  ਰਾਮੁ ਰਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਸਭੁ ਜਗੁ ਫਿਰੈ ਰਾਮੁ ਨ ਪਾਇਆ ਜਾਇ ॥  Raam Raam Karathaa Sabh Jag Firai Raam N Paaeiaa Jaae ||  The whole world wanders around, chanting, """"Raam, Raam"", but the One cannot be found (like this).  Contemplation of Waheguru is important, to become like Waheguru.  What happens in the sky is a reference to those who have merged with Waheguru. They are in chardi kala, rising spirits. Even the worms, those who don't take the time to find Waheguru, want to immitate these feelings.  Only by Waheguru's grace, can this state be obtained. This grace comes from within. Waheguru is not outside, it does not look down on us from the sky. This enlightenment will come from within, when we have understood what it really means to be in chardi kala.  Without this understanding, everything else is just boasting and false."
Sikh,3b1r03,LosBlancosSR4,13,Thu Jun 25 07:10:07 2015 UTC,"The arrogance in assuming that god doesn't belong to insects, cancer cells, rocks, and viruses too...  Do you think we are all god has in mind? The mercy of waheguru is his/her beautiful order. How dare we request this order be disrupted because we want special treatment?  What if an alien species superior in intellect to us asked waheguru to crush us?"
Sikh,3b1r03,MrPaneer,5,Thu Jun 25 07:45:58 2015 UTC,"This is a great go-to response, and I've thought of it before as well, however I think that the question is ultimately about 'suffering' - why needless suffering? If there is cancer, even if the individual dies (which we all ultimately do), why is there suffering alongside it? Why do children suffer? Why do innocents suffer? etc.  I feel that responses like 'we are arrogant in assuming we are the focus of Waheguru' are ultimately just skimming the surface, for a few reasons."
Sikh,3b1r03,gsingh89,5,Fri Jun 26 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"Our philosophical framework says that all of creation is waheguru. So there is no real sufferer, we are just the participants of a great game...  But I'll go with the human-centric perspective for sake of argument.  Is it needless? Thats such a petulant perspective. To a child, a shot is needless suffering.  How many thousands of medicines are here because of toxic bacterias. How many new medicines will be delivered using viral vectors.  Outside of that...we chose to have absurd birth rates, leading to a lot of this suffering.   For 90,000 years, as hunter gatherers, we didn't grow to 7 billion people...now we have. We cry about the starving child, but we don't cry about the birth of a child who will starve.  Whose fault is that? Waheguru's or ours?"
Sikh,3b1r03,MrPaneer,2,Fri Jun 26 05:42:23 2015 UTC,"My question isn't human-centric; all life suffers in one way or another.  As for it being a petulant perspective, I completely disagree. I believe that there is an obvious difference between a needle/shot and someone suffering from a long-drawn cancer, that is bedridden, and suffering for months on end. There is a substantial difference here, and you are reducing that experience. Now, if by comparing it to a shot, you are referencing some benefit that is gained on a grander scale (such as the benefit of the medication to the child), then I can only assume you are referring to karma- which is an adequate response to the question of suffering; However, I believe the jury is still out on r/Sikh as to whether karma is literal or allegorical when mentioned by Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji. Or, did you mean something else by your comparison?  At one instance you believe that there is no individual created by waheguru, but rather we are all simply Waheguru itself. I don't know if I agree with you here, as I don't see why Waheguru can't create actual individual entities of himself, but that's besides the point right now. At one instance you say that there is no real sufferer, there is only Waheguru, and at the next point you say that ""we chose to have absurd birth rates, leading to a lot of this suffering."" How can you have the notion that there is only Waheguru, and at the same time 'we made things the way they are.' There seems to be a duality here, isn't it?  ""We cry about the starving child, but we don't cry about the birth of a child who will starve."" Again, I have to disagree. Most educated people that are concerned about the welfare of starving children have the foresight and concern for children that will starve.   Whose fault is that? I know that there are posts regarding hukam and free will, and I've only skimmed a couple of comments previously, because I am new to reddit as a whole and have only just finished a 2nd round of exams - however, from my understanding, there might not be any true free will at all if everything is hukam. In that sense, how can any individual be at fault? If we are all waheguru, then who is the 'other' to blame? Is there an 'us' if there really is only Waheguru? (I'm asking based on your own ideas; I personally am still on the fence regarding whether there is only Waheguru or whether Waheguru has created separate entities from Waheguru's self.)  Please excuse any misinterpretations of your response that I may have made."
Sikh,3b1r03,gsingh89,2,Fri Jun 26 06:21:33 2015 UTC,"Thats the thing with this discussion, you can't maintain a dualistic perspective and a holisitic perspective, it breaks down to try to have this discussion.  If you don't believe creation is pervaded by the creator, then you are essentially asking me to defend a philosophy I don't agree with.  The question assumes a dualism that I just don't care to defend."
Sikh,3b1r03,MrPaneer,3,Fri Jun 26 06:25:54 2015 UTC,"No, I do believe that the creation is pervaded by the creator. Still, I am saying that if you go with what you have said in your comment based upon your own philosophy/understanding, then you end up with duality.  For example, at one instance you say that there is no real sufferer, there is only Waheguru, and at the next point you say that ""we chose to have absurd birth rates, leading to a lot of this suffering."" How can you have the notion that there is only Waheguru, and at the same time 'we made things the way they are.' This is an example of what I see as duality that exists within your own reasoning based on your philosophy. Can you help make sense of this?"
Sikh,3b1r03,gsingh89,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:33:57 2015 UTC,Can you help make sense of this?   Reading comprehension...this part of my response was critical:   for sake of argument.
Sikh,3b1r03,MrPaneer,2,Fri Jun 26 06:41:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sensing a little condescension in your response. I understand that your view of Waheguru and his creation is that there is no true other. Further, if you read through my response, you'd notice that I informed you that my question was not human-centric. From there, you basically haven't bothered replying to my questions."
Sikh,3b1r03,gsingh89,5,Fri Jun 26 06:56:07 2015 UTC,"There is no pain, there is no peace. All that really exists is perspective.  Murder, cancer, being abused, having money, having lots of sex, getting high, all of these things are simply acts. They are not good or bad.  The only thing that defines them is the viewers perspective.  As the quote says ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"".  In the same way ""pain and suffering is in the eye of the beholder"".  ਮਃ ੧ ॥  Ma 1 ||   First Mehl:   ਕਿਉ ਮਰੈ ਮੰਦਾ ਕਿਉ ਜੀਵੈ ਜੁਗਤਿ ॥  Kio Marai Mandhaa Kio Jeevai Jugath ||   How is evil eradicated? How can the true way of life be found?   ਕੰਨ ਪੜਾਇ ਕਿਆ ਖਾਜੈ ਭੁਗਤਿ ॥  Kann Parraae Kiaa Khaajai Bhugath ||   What is the use of piercing the ears, or begging for food? (Yogis would do this as they believed it helped them join with Waheguru).   ਆਸਤਿ ਨਾਸਤਿ ਏਕੋ ਨਾਉ ॥  Aasath Naasath Eaeko Naao ||   Throughout existence and non-existence (of the world), there is only the One Naam.   ਕਉਣੁ ਸੁ ਅਖਰੁ ਜਿਤੁ ਰਹੈ ਹਿਆਉ ॥  Koun S Akhar Jith Rehai Hiaao ||   What is that Word, which holds the heart in its place?   ਧੂਪ ਛਾਵ ਜੇ ਸਮ ਕਰਿ ਸਹੈ ॥  Dhhoop Shhaav Jae Sam Kar Sehai ||   When you look alike upon sunshine (happiness) and shade (pain),   ਤਾ ਨਾਨਕੁ ਆਖੈ ਗੁਰੁ ਕੋ ਕਹੈ ॥  Thaa Naanak Aakhai Gur Ko Kehai ||   Says Nanak, then the Guru will speak to you (only then will you find that word, the naam).   Everyone suffers, everyone thinks their troubles are the worst in the world, that no one else has a problem like theres.  ਨਾਨਕ ਦੁਖੀਆ ਸਭੁ ਸੰਸਾਰੁ ॥  Naanak Dhukheeaa Sabh Sansaar ||   O Nanak, the whole world is suffering.   Yet, we are just part of Waheguru. This is the play of Waheguru, we are just the various costumes, which are playing host to the same actor. We are dancing for the same director.  This is Waheguru experiencing itself, through us. Through the dance of the solar systems in the vast cosmos, to the bacterium and virus, to the insects, plants, fish, animals and humans.  Everything you see is Waheguru, its like Mufasa and Simba ""we are connected in the circle of life"".  Just as the cancer, it is a disease of the body. It just exists, it is neither good or bad. It is part of life. What we have is perspective. We can live life with ""chardi kala"", we can be high all the time, or we can choose to wallow in haumai (love of the self) and choose to ignore the other actors of the play.  The commentary on Pauri 23 of Japji Sahib talks about this.  ਤੁਝ ਬਿਨੁ ਦੂਜਾ ਅਵਰੁ ਨ ਕੋਈ ਸਭੁ ਤੇਰਾ ਖੇਲੁ ਅਖਾੜਾ ਜੀਉ ॥੨॥  Thujh Bin Dhoojaa Avar N Koee Sabh Thaeraa Khael Akhaarraa Jeeo ||2||   Without You, there is no other; the entire Universe is the Arena of Your Play. ||2||   The Gurus were not interested in the ""why"" this happens. They did not come up with elaborate philosophical arguments. It exists, this is the way life is. What can we do?  Perhaps we should realise what is truelly beneath the costume. We have become so obsessed, so absorbed in the costume, we have forgotten the actor, we no longer see who we really are."
Sikh,3b1r03,Singh_Q6,2,Fri Jun 26 08:37:12 2015 UTC,"So essentially, all pain and pleasure are a part of maya and we can only escape them once we have found naam.   That makes sense, and I suppose you answer the question of 'why have suffering at all?' with 'there is only Waheguru having all types of experiences in all his creativity, which includes pain and pleasure, and none of these experiences are inherently good or bad' based on your interpretation of Gurbani, more or less?"
Sikh,3b1r03,gsingh89,2,Mon Jun 29 18:20:00 2015 UTC,"Everything is God. There's no good or bad, pure or impure. It's all the same. When one becomes gurmukhs they reside in anand, even sitting amongst flames. What does this mean? There's a state of consciousness beyond suffering and karmic inertia that is more real than this mayic experience. To be a Sikh you must have devotion to guru and self-discipline to overcome all afflictions and transcend Maya whilst still among it. Guru has revealed all the wisdom, we must put in the effort ourselves to experience the sublime truth of the amrit bani."
Sikh,3b1r03,pickledpie,2,Sun Jun 28 07:16:20 2015 UTC,"My view (again this is mine personally) is that we can't really answer this question. God doesn't exist in Sikhi to give answers to humans; if that was the case, our Jap Ji would give us a creation story or explanation for why we were created instead of ""it's Gods hukam and only God knows."" That people physically suffer is a fact of life. Why was Guru Arjun Dev Ji tortured so badly instead of a simple execution? Why did Guru Har Krishan die of the horrible smallpox disease? We have to just see it as part of a bigger picture with Waheguru, and also do our duty to stop suffering where we see it. Which is why we don't just pray for relief, we are encouraged to fight injustice, to seek medicine and to help the sick, and so on."
Sikh,3b1r03,asdfioho,2,Fri Jun 26 22:06:03 2015 UTC,That's actually a really interesting response. I wish this had come to me when I was asked the question. Thank you!
Sikh,3b1r03,SkepticSikh,5,Thu Jun 25 09:16:38 2015 UTC,I suggest that you read the following two threads that cover this topic in detail:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Sikh/comments/2wqs6m/what_does_sikhi_say_about_the_existence_of_evil/  http://www.reddit.com/r/Sikh/comments/2wpbzx/why_doesnt_god_answer_my_prayers_why_do_people/
Sikh,3b1r03,ChardiKala,2,Thu Jun 25 07:50:06 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely read those, thank you!"
Sikh,3b1r03,gsingh89,2,Thu Jun 25 09:17:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with MrPaneer, and would also go through those threads linked by SkepticSikh. The question in your OP assumes a very Abarahmic-conception of God, one where humanity is the center of the universe (whether literally or metaphorically), but is anathema to the Sikh idea of Waheguru. I would also recommend reading through our Mool Mantar thread for an idea of what Guru Nanak Dev Ji and his successors meant when they said there is only One Ik Onkar, and also reading through the commentaries on the rest of Japji Sahib for further analysis.  I used to be an anti-theist and grew up immersed in the new-age atheist culture. In my opinion, questions like this are a cop-out and don't add any real substance to the conversation. The reason I say this is because I have seen (and have done this myself in the past) atheists using exactly the opposite argument for why we shouldn't be religious.  The argument goes something like: ""the universe is fucking huge, and still expanding. This could just be one universe out of billions in the ocean of the multiverse, and who knows, maybe that multiverse is just one in an ocean of multiverses, and the whole thing never stops. And you're a primate sitting here, on a tiny blue dot circling an insignificant star on the edge of a very ordinary galaxy, worried about when the right time to pray is, what you should wear, and what you can and can't eat??? If there is a God who created all this vastness, it wouldn't give a fuck about when you prayed, what you ate and how you dressed!! It wouldn't care about our insignificant lives at all, the unvierse/multiverse is too damn huge for it to do so!""  So on the one hand, God can't possibly exist because people suffer from terrible diseases (so our lives aren't being micromanaged) BUT on the OTHER HAND, if God DID exist, then according to new-age atheists, such a supreme being wouldn't care about us anyways and we need to stop acting like our lives are being micromanaged.  See the problem here? It's a damned if you do damned if you don't situation. It doesn't add any substance to the conversation because usually, the same people asking the question in your OP (why doesn't God micromanage our lives?????) would turn around and tell you that if God exists then such a grand being wouldn't want to micromanage our lives anyways. The objective when asking this question isn't honest discussion, just a faulty appeal to emotion and if you hang out around the new-age atheist crowd long enough, you'll also start to pick up on some of this circular reasoning.   That was one of the main reasons I had to leave. And after spending time immersed in Sikhi, I don't think either of these arguments apply to The Gurus' Ik Onkar anyways. Have a read through the Japji Sahib commentary to see why not ;)"
Sikh,3b1r03,SirMize,2,Fri Jun 26 00:57:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, I see your point regarding how the entire discussion ends up being circular and I appreciate you making it clearer by going through how that is exactly.  However, as I commented above, what happens when this question is simplified to 'suffering' rather than being 'human-centric.' If the nature of reality is birth and death, and the natural order, why does suffering have to be a part of the equation? I'm not asking because I believe that there is no answer (like an atheist might), but rather because I am hoping someone here either has one or at least can express their understanding about it."
Sikh,3b1r03,himmatsj,2,Fri Jun 26 05:37:15 2015 UTC,"Also you have to have context of what god is. In western religions God is a separate entity that created everything. In Sikhism and many eastern religions god is the creator and the creation itself. Simply put Imagine God is the ocean, A wave forms, from that wave one tiny drop of water falls from the wave and becomes separate from the ocean. That drop is you, for a brief moment you are individual, but that individuality is an illusion. You are actually the ocean, you are actually god, but just a small piece of it.   So that suffering child, is also you're suffering, and it is Gods suffering as well, because we are a piece of God, when that drop of water drops back into the ocean we are God.  Also /u/MrPaneer has an awesome answer as well.  Edit:spelling"
Sikh,3b1r03,Singh_Q6,2,Sat Jun 27 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"To me, I personally believe in a creator lord, who created the universe a long, long time ago and created certain parameters and universal laws (such as the laws of physics) for our eventual existence. As such, at present, I believe that God takes a ""hands-off"" approach. We humans live our lives as it is. God doesn't interfere; neither to make it better, nor worse.   This view of mine may run contrary to the view held by most Sikhs, but it's the most rationale explanation I have found for now, all things considered.  From a Sikhi POV explicitly (in terms of what's in SGGS), it just says that everything happens by the will of God, but maybe we take it too literally."

We ARE Waheguru, there is nothing else. Waheguru is niranjan (without blemish), how can our actions affect Waheguru?  Its why I don't think an afterlife makes sense in Sikhi. How can Waheguru ever be reincarnated? Death and birth don't exist because Waheguru is ajooni (beyond life).  This body is just a reflection of the One, but the One never dies.

Sikh,3ay3vr,pickledpie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:32:40 2015 UTC,"Taking the Guru Granth Sahib as a whole, we should understand that there is no birth or death of the soul. But obviously, we know that birth and death does occur. This birth and death is of the body, nothing else and nothing more. We are just a drop of the infinite ocean. And our goal is to merge back in the ocean. Hence, the analogy used of the water droplet merging with the infinite ocean in the SGGS. But there is reincarnation. Its mentioned many many times. The soul goes through a cycle of 8.4 million (84 lakh) lives before it gets the chance to be human again."
Sikh,3aw1qi,asdfioho,3,Tue Jun 23 23:27:08 2015 UTC,"Here's what I had to write about the article. I don't like the wording at all, as it misrepresents a lot of facts and sensationalizes a good bit.   However, this incident is something that we must think about nonetheless. I know many people think that this was an attack by the Indian government to make the movement sour. The actual facts show the opposite. There is no need to protect people like the Air India bombers in our community--just like many others at the time, they used the genuine pain and suffering of our community for their own opportunism and a way to express hate. As Sikhs, it is our duty to stand up against this. In the same way that others need to have sympathy for how we feel when we see KP Gill and Indira Gandhi honored, we need to at the very least have an understanding their way and not honor people who committed anti-Sikh and anti-human acts that day."

Sikh,3aw1qi,Singh101,3,Wed Jun 24 04:58:31 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that Parmar is a suspect in the bombing. Key word: suspect. It was never formally recognized that he was the culprit, and maybe there's a good reason for that. After all, the Canadian police aren't idiots, and they would've formally named him if they had conclusive proof that he was the culprit."
Sikh,3aw1qi,Aj5abi,3,Wed Jun 24 00:43:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182 concluded that Talwinder Singh Parmar is now believed to be the leader of the conspiracy to bomb Air India flights. The reason that he wasn't convicted earlier was because A) he went to India and was killed off before the evidence was collected, and B) key people providing evidence in the trial, i.e. Tara Singh Hayer, were murdered by extremists in their own homes. There was a lot of political tension at the time that prevented the trial from proceeding normally, including Ripudaman Malik's links.  Even then, Inderjit Reyat was formally convicted, yet people in denial make excuses for that. I'm sure if Parmar was convicted, the Canadian police was in cahoots with India, but now that he wasn't the Canadian police obviously did their job in an outstanding way.  Just curious, why do people defend Parmar so much? My family in India actually knew him very well (in fact he had even at one point proposed a marriage of his daughter to one of my uncles), and while he was a very kind person and stood up for right causes back then, that doesn't absolve the evidence that is very clearly available and very clearly paints him as a culprit. Maybe Bluestar touched a nerve in him, who knows. It's just kind of pathetic how we aren't as a community willing to even take responsibility not even for a single bad apple here or there."
Sikh,3aw1qi,MrPaneer,2,Wed Jun 24 01:35:10 2015 UTC,"It's just kind of pathetic how we aren't as a community willing to even take responsibility not even for a single bad apple here or there.   Whats with your periodic reminders of the same incident? Why not do the same with how Punjab Police celebrates known rapists and murderers as martyrs...or how Sikh political prisoners are rotting away in jails despite having served their sentences...or how the perpetrators of the genocide are allowed to live out their lives in peace and luxury while the remaining victims suffer in poverty...or how Indira Gandhi is still promoted as a role model? Why is having our community label someone like Parmar, who is still at most only a suspect despite all the evidence, as a big bad terrorist so important to you? What good will it do to beat ourselves up over what this Sikh or that Sikh might have done when they finally snapped...prove that we can't all be saints? I don't get it, what's the point of this when instead of devoting this zeal towards saving fellow Sikhs' lives, you wanna make sure that we all know how much of a bad apple that one guy is suspected to have been?  Nobody defends the bombing, no one, not even everyone who claims Parmar's innocence or Indian gov'ts involvement. They all say it was a terrible tragedy that should've never occurred and anyone suspected to be responsible should be brought to court, which they were and its a more than what can be said of the Indian officials responsible for tens of thousands of Sikh deaths. So what good does it do to drum up this particular incident over n over? Every time you or someone else comes along beating that same old drum, all I see is ""Look look there's that one time where we discovered a bad apple!

If you looked at my comment in the threads in /r/abcdesis, /r/canada, and /r/vancouver, that's exactly what I did. The reason I ""constantly remind"" is because I do the exact same for killers of Sikhs of the same period. I feel like in a place like /r/sikh, where we already recognize KP Gill's exoneration and guilt, there should at least be some dialogue for the other side as well.   And I think people's responses speak for themselves why. Whenever incidents of Islamic extremism occur, the first reaction I hear from many Sikhs as well is ""why don't moderate Muslims condemn this."" In reality, I think the Sikh panth doesn't condone these actions, but for some reason we are so intent on protecting this group of people we defy logic to do so. I've heard in this very subreddit that Reyat was innocent but the Canadian law enforcement was corrupt and that's why he was sentenced, and ALSO that Parmar was innocent because the Canadian law enforcement said so.   It's a damned if I do, damned if I don't scenario. Talk about the sufferings of Sikhs in a subreddit not dominated by Sikhs and I'm clearly a ""terrorist sympathizer."" Try to create a meaningful dialogue within /r/Sikh about the fact that many people still choose to believe conspiracy theories over the logical facts of the case, and I'm not being fair to the Sikh side. To me, I already speak out against KP Gill, CM Beant Singh, and Indira Gandhi being honored in India media, but someone like this being honored in the Gurdwara is our problem as a Sikh community. For god's sake, people get upset when a picture of Yogi Bhajan is put up; is it really that bad if I get upset this guy's picture is up?"
Sikh,3aw1qi,MrPaneer,3,Wed Jun 24 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"If I understand /u/Aj5abi correctly, its an issue of fatigue.  Just like /u/hagiography's posts in unrelated threads saying ""sikhs shouldn't try to be in the US imperialist dog army""...The frequent and non-sequitur nature of your ""reminders"" bordering on trolling.  I don't agree completely, as you can always just choose to ignore something on reddit and move on, but I can empathize.  It sounds to me that you are trying to have a novel discussion, but perhaps the depth you want to discuss isn't coming across. Instead we experience it as being needlessly lashed over something we have already discussed. Perhaps a good tack may be to try to ask your question highlighting the element that makes the discussion different?"
Sikh,3aw1qi,MrPaneer,2,Wed Jun 24 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"the last time I even talked about this issue was several months ago. Just thought I would post it here as the link is very popular on reddit currently (as one can see from the 5 other discussions on the topic), and I always accompany my links with some of my commentary. I think it's important to discuss things going around the mass media with negative connotations regarding Sikhs (such as the Taksali beating the Sadhu/Nihang a while back) so that we can properly understand them and address them head-on.   If this is borderline trolling, so is my participation in /r/ABCDesis where I incessantly try to give the Sikh perspective on such issues. That said, if you could point me to specific comments that have induced this fatigue, I would be more than happy to regulate my comments better."

Sikh,3ar60j,mag_gent,6,Mon Jun 22 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"One thing I think they NAIL  is their emphasis on Kirtan.  Read the guru granth sahib, and again and again it will tell you - kirtan is one of your most powerful tools.   In fact, I would argue that kirtan is a more fundamental part of sikh practice than amrit or the 5 k's. The guru granth sahib is silent on amrit or long hair, but it does speak loudly about kirtan."
Sikh,3ar60j,MrPaneer,3,Tue Jun 23 01:26:17 2015 UTC,It isn't referring to kirtan in the traditional sense. Its referring to simran when it says kirtan.
Sikh,3ar60j,_lion_,3,Tue Jun 23 02:16:32 2015 UTC,"I can certainly agree with that interpretation.  But I think there is something special in actually singing gurbani. The evidence to this is everywhere.   From calling our poetry ""gur-bani"" (""the guru's song""), to organizing the whole of our scripture by music, to the historical precedence of all of the gurus having kirtan in their congregations, to the near endless references to singing and song in the Guru Granth Sahib.   Only our loss if we ignore all that."
Sikh,3ar60j,MrPaneer,3,Tue Jun 23 02:30:18 2015 UTC,"Sure its important. Its was a way for the message to be spread. Just like katha. But the message itself isn't to keep reading the message (doing kirtan). The message is to do simran. So if you say that the most important thing we can do is kirtan, thats analogous to someone giving you an instruction booklet, but instead of actually doing what it tells us, we keep reading it."
Sikh,3ar60j,_lion_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:47:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right. Kirtan can be done mechanically as well.  But I think you would agree with me when I say that if done with integrity, its pretty unique what singing kirtan can do to your experience of gurbani?  I could go for pages about why I think the gurus chose to make kirtan so central for us, but thats a subject for another time."
Sikh,3ar60j,MrPaneer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:41:22 2015 UTC,What is simran? I always considered simran to be a Sikh form of meditation that incorporates music.
Sikh,3ar60j,asdfioho,3,Tue Jun 23 13:23:30 2015 UTC,"Simran means to remember.  It doesn't mean to sit around going ""WAAAAAAGURU GURUUUUUUUUU OHHHH MAKE CAT NOISES WAAGURUUU"" which I've often heard.  This is just my interpretation which is probably (most likely) wrong.  But simran means to remember. Jap means to remember, Jap and japo means to contemplate and to internalise.  Look at the first bani of SGGS. It is called Jap. If jap meant to chant and to repeat Waheguru, why would the first compostion of SGGS be called ""chant and meditate""?  Jap means to contemplate and to remember. Japji Sahib is a contemplation, a discussion about Waheguru.  Doing simran, jap, connecting with naam doesn't mean to just sit somewhere and make loud noises and repeat a word.  That is part of it, meditation and chanting Waheguru is a part of it. But its not the only thing and its not the most important thing.  Remembering Waheguru all the time means to become like Waheguru. Singing its praises all the times means to become like Waheguru. Every action you do is in line with Hukam, to live fighting the 5 thieves.  That for me, is doing simran. To put the bani into action. To internalise the message of bani and to search your own being.  ਕਬੀਰ ਮੁਲਾਂ ਮੁਨਾਰੇ ਕਿਆ ਚਢਹਿ ਸਾਂਈ ਨ ਬਹਰਾ ਹੋਇ ॥  kabīr mulānh munārē kiā chadhah sānhī n baharā hōi .  Kabeer, O Mullah, why do you climb to the top of the minaret? Our Master is not deaf.  ਜਾ ਕਾਰਨਿ ਤੂੰ ਬਾਂਗ ਦੇਹਿ ਦਿਲ ਹੀ ਭੀਤਰਿ ਜੋਇ ॥੧੮੪॥  jā kāran tūn bānhg dēh dil hī bhītar jōi .184.  For that reason (to find Waheguru) you are shouting (call to prayer), search within your heart instead. ||184||  Reducing simran to just chanting and meditating I think does injustice to simran actually means. To always be mindful of what we are."
Sikh,3ar60j,Singh_Q6,3,Tue Jun 23 15:00:04 2015 UTC,Doing simran in sangat sends out good vibrations so doing simran out loud isn't a bad thing
Sikh,3ar60j,Instanada,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"I agree that simran is not just chanting but that doesn't mean chanting can't be simran. You can chant and internalize and rejoice in Waheguru along with others. On the other hand, you can sit silently and recite Waheguru's name (or any other name of Waheguru) in your mind and that is simran too. Lastly, as you said, in your day to day actions you can remember Waheguru and let that inform your actions too.   The way you described AKJ's chanting it seems you are looking down on one of the ways they do simran. I don't see how incorporating chanting of Waheguru into kirtan is a negative thing. Maybe you don't connect with that practice but it doesn't mean you should look down on others for doing it."
Sikh,3ar60j,Singh_Q6,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:07:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking down on them, I'm sorry if I came across like that.  I personally enjoy listening to their kirtan, you can see my post history where I have posted their kirtan.  However, I disagree with how they do kirtan at times. Where they start shouting and making wierd noises. They start jumping around. Making noises is surely not how we are supposed to do simran.  I'm not saying don't do it. If you like doing it and it works for you, then great. What I am saying is that people reduce the concept of simran to just chanting, I think its much more than that."
Sikh,3ar60j,pegasus199,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:22:48 2015 UTC,You can't automatically start remembering God all the time. It starts off by sitting and doing simran the slowly as you surti get sharper and more untuned with Him then your life becomes simran. Do you remember Him all the time 24/7?
Sikh,3ar60j,pralinematchbox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"Cat noises As much as I laughed it's true though. It gets crazy, I know bir ras is a method of kirtan and Simran but it turns into mourning and not love for God."

Sikh,3ar60j,asdfioho,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"I think simran is meditation on Naam. The specific form of that meditation is not that important as long as you are reciting and meditating on Waheguru (or other name of God which you may prefer). I enjoy solitary, silent simran as well as musical kirtan with the sangat. In my opinion they are both simran."
Sikh,3ar60j,asdfioho,2,Tue Jun 23 14:13:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting, perhaps we should expand a discussion on this for a new thread. I always consider mindfulness, including quiet, solitary, and silent mindfulness, an essential meditative practice that can and should be incorporated into Sikhi. Does Naam Simran mean this as well, or just the musical aspects? Or does it have the broader scope Singh_Q6 suggests? It's something I think we should all parse out as a sangat considering it's a cornerstone of Sikhi."
Sikh,3ar60j,Instanada,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:41:41 2015 UTC,"I think that would be a good discussion. I find that although everyone knows about the importance of simran it is a practice that is often neglected.   On the topic of mindfulness, I also practice mindfulness sometimes. Personally, I don't consider it simran since I am not meditating on God. However, I do think it's relaxing and very helpful in breaking your attachments to worldly things. So, even though it's not simran it still a positive spiritual practice which I believe is consistent with Sikhi."
Sikh,3ar60j,asdfioho,2,Tue Jun 23 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"Then again, pretty much each shabad (notable exceptions including Jap Ji) in Guru Granth Sahib also has a raag denoted at the very beginning, which wraps into the broader subject of Sikh musicology incorporating instruments the Gurus created themselves, something the AKJ doesn't really seem to heed in their kirtan. their own site justifies it by saying that the majority of bani doesn't have raag, which is pretty much flat-out wrong. While it's passionate and musical, it's more along the lines of what Sufi recitations would be than Gurmat Sangeet. Nonetheless, I agree that it's still very laudable that they have such a great emphasis on kirtan in the first place, given how much the Gurus consistently emphasized music as central to the Sikh path.   In all honesty, AKJ is probably one of the jathebandis that I'm least apprehensive of. Their stance on equality for women is especially admirable, and I also like that they aren't really to heavy-handed with promoting Bhai Randhir Singh. Only thing that kinda weirds me out are the only-iron + only-sand + only-AKJ eating practices"
Sikh,3ar60j,Instanada,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:10:14 2015 UTC,Iron is very pure and very easy to clean. You can scrub off food easily and it would be impossible to have any clue of what food was previously served in that sarbloh
Sikh,3ar60j,actujat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:06:35 2015 UTC,"Is that a scientific opinion? I may be wrong, but although you're definitely correct in the sense that iron is ""pure"" in that it's composed of one element (versus steel which is an alloy), I'm not sure that's why the AKJ does it in the first place. According to most of what I've read, the practice of Sarbloh bibek is not done because of scientific background, it's done out of tradition. Which is why most debates about it run up whether Sant Ji did it, whether this Bhai saab did it, and so on.  Note that you may be 100% right, though; for example, wooden combs like the kanga are actually healthier to use than the plastic ones. I'm just not sure that the science here, whether true or not, is the reason the practice exists."
Sikh,3ar60j,ChardiKala,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:19:30 2015 UTC,"It is scientifically proven that pure things are much easier to clean...most stainless steel cookware sold in stores allow Chrome and nickel to bleed out into your food and are retained in your body (can't be digested). This can lead to health problems. Similarly glass cookware leaks out lead, aluminum cookware reacts with all vegetables and produces hydroxide poison. On the other hand, iron cookware (sarbloh) seeps off iron into your food ensuring that those that eat from it get enough iron. Although more care is needed to avoid rust, iron cookware leads to a much healthier lifestyle. I also encourage you to see the difference in taste when eating from sarbloh.   Source: bhai manvir singh ji  Also, guru Nanak dev ji taught us to not blindly follow traditions but instead question why things are done"
Sikh,3ar60j,actujat,6,Tue Jun 23 15:03:16 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with 'most' of their beliefs. They  follow the Sikh rehat marayada but have additional requirements on top of the 'base marayada'. People try to say they are going against the marayada, but I think people just misinterpret it.  They believe the keski is a kakaar. They don't believe kes is a kakaar as all of the other kakaars are external items, but they believe the hair should not be cut as one of the 4 bujar kurehits. Makes sense to me, but this requires that's both males and females wear the dastaar. I'm all for that.  They read 2 additional banis in the morning (Chaupai and Anand sahib).  They believe Naam is obtained through Simran.  They believe in vegetarianism.   Certain groups within that jatha eat only from iron utensils and food made by other Amritdharies, but this is a very small group. That is an increasingly small group from what I see.   They also don't believe Raagmala is part of the Guru Granth Sahib. It's the last section. The akal takhat used to agree however left the writings in the printing. Most akhand paaths today end the singing of bani before raag mala - and that part is just dryly read. Raagmala is a debate that's been put on hold in the panth, and Sikh are given the choice to read or not read it as their own choice.  AKJ are strict in their rules and application, but are one of the better jathas in my opinion. Their discussions are usually very thoughtful and are dedicated to Sikhi. Though Bhai Randhir Singh started the jatha, he is not really celebrated/worshipped in any way.   In conclusion, the way I see it is: if we are asked to run 3 laps a day, they run 6 and eat really clean. They're doing what's required, but trying to go the extra mile and with good intentions. You'll find a lot of hate, but I think the positives massively outweigh any negatives."
Sikh,3ar60j,ranchow,6,Tue Jun 23 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"They also don't believe Raagmala is part of the Guru Granth Sahib.   In addition to this, one of their practices I highly admire is their insistence on using the Lareevar Saroop of SGGS Ji.   For those who don't know the Lareevar Saroop refers to the original copies of SGGS Ji which differ from those printed today in that the older ones were printed without any line spacing.  To some this may seem trivial, but the fact that people now need to interpret for themselves where to place these 'splits' means there are a number of words in SGGS Ji for which the meanings are not agreed upon by scholars, because there are arguments that the splitting of the text did not occur in the right place.  Same thing with older Rehatnamas, I was reading through some literature and according to McLeod, some of the differences between the AKJ Maryada and the Akal Takht Maryada arise from the former's interpretations of unbroken Rehat texts compared to the latter's interpretation from words which have been broken up by scholars, through the addition of line spacing.  It may not seem like a big deal now, but in 100, 200, 300 years, how many Birs of SGGS Ji are there going to be which are Lareevar so that we can use them when other disagreements arise over the meaning of certain terminology, and whether the spacing was inserted at the right places? Sikhs need to stop burning their old saroops as ""seva"" and start preserving them, because right now every time we burn an old saroop, we are burning our treasures and our history! Even a Bir that is printed in 2015 is going to be as historic in 2315 as Bir from 1715 is today.  I recommend for anyone who can, get your hands on the oldest SGGS Ji Birs you can and preserve them, especially if they are Lareevar. Even the handwritten Mool Mantars by our Gurus didn't have line spacing. If line spacing is more convenient then fine, but we shouldn't be burning the old Saroops which follow the tradition of the Guru Sahibs.   Purchase and keep/preserve hard Copies of the following to compare when in doubt..   The Four Volume Shabadarth Pothis of SGGS published by SGPC 1950-1980's. These are printed by Lithocopy plates and contain 'original' SGGS. Manmohan Singh version of SGGS in 8 volumes. Prof sahib Singh's 10 volume SGGS Darpan also contains Original SGGS.   SGGS Birs printed before 2000.....Mostly accurate.  Also download a PDF of the Lareevar Saroop and keep it stored somewhere safe."
Sikh,3ar60j,actujat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:38:41 2015 UTC,"Lareevar is so difficult to read! I do agree with you that it should be the only way gurbani is written due to the different ways the words are spaced.   If it were in Lareevar, it would allow for everyone to be trained to read that way first."
Sikh,3ar60j,asdfioho,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe I've misunderstood something. If you remove spaces from SGGSJi as prevalent today, would it not become Lareevar SGGSJi? Irrespective of where the spaces were added, once removed wouldn't it be back to the original? Or is something other than spaces added?"
Sikh,3ar60j,Instanada,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:04:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great info. The one thing I've heard is that they don't like to associate with people who are not amritdharis. Although logically I can see that if you're trying to maintain strict discipline then you need the right sangat I still feel it's a bit harsh. In my opinion Sikhism is supposed to inclusive of people who are good but whose path might differ from yours. Maybe I'm just sensitive because I'm not amritdhari but I still consider myself a Sikh.
Sikh,3ar60j,asdfioho,2,Tue Jun 23 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"I've heard that as well. It may be intimidating at first, but I think with time the sangat will accept you if you go to the programs.   I don't think it's a a real practice of their group to only associate with Amritdharies. I think that's just human nature - people tend to hang out and associate themselves more with people similar to them in beliefs, etc. I've gone to many of their programs and have experienced nothing but bliss from the kirtan and simran."
Sikh,3ar60j,Instanada,2,Tue Jun 23 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"It is an actual practice, though. At least among select groups like you've mentioned. The reasoning is that food from non-Amritdharis may be polluted and that hanging around non-Amritdharis is associating with manmukhs which Gursikhs shouldn't do (which IMO is a misinterpretation of the actual shabads from GGS on the subject)."
Sikh,3ar60j,asdfioho,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:22:50 2015 UTC,No it's because being with those that have the same goal as you is the best way to improve. Doesn't mean that your not allowed to be friends with manmukhs.
Sikh,3ar60j,Singh_Q6,3,Tue Jun 23 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"While you may be giving your own explanation and that's fine, I'm giving the interpretation I've read from AKJ jathebandis themselves. In fact, here is a lovely essay that was on AKJ.org, under the literature section. I happened to find it because a lot of the AKJ forums would have it posted when this issue arose.   BTW, regarding our other discussion: I did some looking around, and while I'm no fan of Manvir Singh, he seems to be pretty accurate in his pronouncement that cast-iron cookware is the cheapest, most effective, and overall best out of all options for cooking. So a point well-made, I suppose.  GURU KA LANGAR  It is an established truth that the food one eats does not only affect the body's health but also influences one 5 mind and thinking. That is why Sahib Sri Guru Nanak Dcv Ji has forbidden eating food which makes the body writhe in pain and fill the mind with evil. That is why he refused to accept the most nourishing and dainty dishes prepared in the house of Malik Bhago but preferred the simple dry food prepared by the so called low-caste carpenter, Bhai Lalo. Similarly, Sahib Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji refused to drink water brought by a young man who had never done any service to anyone in his life. Thus, in the Gursikh way of life it is not only the nutrient value of the food that matters but, more importantly, who has prepared it and who serves it. Guru-Ka-Langar, whether prepared in the Gurdwara or in the household of a Sikh can be called Guru-Ka-Langar only if it is prepared by Guru-Ke-Sikhs. This may be the one reason why Sahib Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji asked the recipients of the holy Amrit to share food among themselves in the same plate, but forbade them to do so with non-Amritdharis. One of the edicts given at the Baptismal ceremony is:  Gursikh di roti beti di saanjh Gursikh naal. The Gursikhs have to share food and establish marital relationships with Gursikhs only  This edict is enjoined upon all the baptized Sikhs at the Baptismal ceremony at every Amrit Sanchar in the Panth irrespective of organizations or Jathas arranging it. It is further supported by the following quotation from Rahitnamaa:  Jay Kurahtieye Jag Darsaawat. Pahul Peeay Kukaram Kamaavat. Tin So Vartan Nahe Milaawey. Rahey Nirlep Param Sukh Paavey. (Rahitnamaa Bhai Desa Singh Ji) Gursikhs are not to socialize or associate with those who have become apostates. Only then will they lead unaffected and happy lives.  Incidently, the above quotation brings out another important point; that even one who has taken Amrit once can become a non-Amritdhari if he commits any of the four Cardinal Sins or big Don'ts.  It is, therefore, clear from the above that if a Sikh is to strictly follow the commandments or Code of Conduct enunciated at the time of partaking of Amrit, he has to share food and keep relationships with Gursikhs (i.e., Amritdharis) only. There is no 'elitism' or 'communalism' in it. In fact, it is a practice ordained by Guru Sahib himself. It does not reek of Hinduism or Brahminism, as some people say. In the case of Brahminism, the low-caste people remain untouchable throughout their lives simply because of the accident of their birth, and there is no means by which they can be upgraded and made acceptable, with respect to sharing food with them. In Sikhism, all people, irrespective of their caste, religion, race, country, etc., are welcome to the Khalsa fold. Once they become Khalsa after taking Amrit, they are then an integral part of the Khalsa Panth, and it is always a privilege to share food and contract marital relationship with them, whatever may have been their original faith, race, etc. In fact, this is the holy way employed by the Satguru for the uplift of humanity.  Sorry, but yeah, I think it's a pathetic practice. Being around people with the same like-minded goal to improve that lifestyle, or hanging around people who are similar to you, is a lot different than refusing to eat food made by other people's hands."

SGGS condemns this kind of behaviour, criticising the Brahmins.  The thing about rehats are that they are subject to change. It is a living document. Rehat is not SGGS, it is not authoritative. The SGGS is the mind and the rehat can be considered to be a body. The mind controls the body, if the rehat is not in line with SGGS, you must discard it.  This eating food with Sikhs rehat is probably from a time when Sikhs were being persecuted. It was probably put in place to prevent poisoning."

Sikh,3aq6rp,asdfioho,6,Mon Jun 22 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"I did a lot of reading recently on this, it's a super interesting fact that I think evaded most of my readings of the history of this huge transformation in Sikh political and religious thought.   Here’s my take on it, I will provide links to sources as well as my personal thoughts at the end. I just want to give the caveat that in no way are my opinions definitive or authoritative; I’m no Sikh scholar. I do these types of threads not because I like preaching or even teaching, but just because these are really interesting things that I feel are perfect for a community like this to discuss.  So we obviously know that the Singh Sabha originated in a time period where Sikhi was a lot different than what it currently is. Many Sikhs followed “Sanatan Sikhi,” a brand that blended Hindu and Sikh practices and identity. Now, I was originally under the impression that the Singh Sabha was created by the Tat Khalsa for the purposes of getting rid of this Sanatan ideology in favor of a uniform Khalsa-Sikh identity. However, it seems that Singh Sabha was jointly created by Sanatan and Khalsa Sikhs alike, for the purpose of countering Christian and Arya Samajis—for centuries in Punjab, Sikhi (whether in Khalsa form or not) had become a dominant political-religious force, but the Samajis and Christians managed to convert many out of Sikhi, which made all Sikhs (Khalsa+Sanatan) anxious. So the Singh Sabha was formed to basically proselytize Sikhi back. Founders included Khem Singh Bedi (descendant of Guru Nanak and Sahib Singh Bedi), Giani Gian Singh, and Thakur Singh Sandhawalia (descendant of Ranjit Singh’s associate).   However, issues started arising among this Sabha. One of the first was that Khem Singh Bedi proposed changing the name of the meetings to “Sikh Singh Sabha,” to be all-inclusive of all those who considered themselves Sikhs (including Nirmalas, Udasis, etc) and not just Khalsa Singh’s. The Khalsa members of the assembly didn’t agree with the proposal, and Bedi dropped it, although new issues would soon arise out of the hotbed.   Another issue that arose was that of treatment in front of the Guru and traditional hierarchies. Khem Singh Bedi was the descendant of Guru Nanak, and usually had his own palanquin at the same level as GGS. Khalsa Sikhs disagreed with this, and demanded that everyone be seated at an equal level in front of the sole Guru. Bedi argued that living Gurus were a central aspect of general Indian spirituality, and that a lot of Sikhs were ultimately exposed to Sikhi via living Gurus in the first place and that they were responsible for a lot of the growth of Sikh Panth. The Tat Khalsa was actually supposedly ambivalent on this point, and thus managed to find a way to accord living Gurus a place in the panth, albeit as saints (which is why so many of our ‘Sant-ji’s” are pretty much revered as Gurus by their adherents, even among the “modernized” and “Khalsa-ized” Sikh panth of today). This pretty much set off the foundation for a split, and a new Singh Sabha arose in Lahore, headed by members of the “Tat” (true) Khalsa (this name came from the name that the Khalsa gave itself when having to face off against the Bandai Khalsa who revered Banda Bahadur as an 11th Guru). Members included included Giani Ditt Singh, Vir Singh, and Gurmukh Singh. This Lahori Singh Sabha was now opposed to the Amritsari Singh Sabha, the latter of which focused on Sanatan values. The Amritsari Singh Sabha was also headed by leaders who were traditionally seen as such because of valuable historical lineages, while the Lahori was led by intellectuals from average backgrounds who were often Western-educated.  Huge debates erupted between Singh Sabha’s at times. Marriage was one such debate. Sanatanis advocated using the fire nuptial used by many Sikhs at the time (who, remember, also generically followed Hindu customs), while the Khalsa advocated the Anand Karaj marriage ritual. In reality, IMO, both sides had legitimate arguments; the Sanatanis used the argument from tradition, that since many Sikhs traditionally got a fire-marriage, it should be kept that way, and also that Anand Karaj was a new innovation created by the Nirankari group. The Tat argued that Brahmanical rites for marriage were contra to Sikh philosophy and also to ideology espoused in Rehits for Khalsa Sikhs.  At the time, most Sikhs followed Sanatan ideology, so the Sanatan Singh Sabha generally had the advantage on that level. However, the Tat Khalsa Singh Sabha was aided by the British, who wanted to promote the Khalsa because A) they felt the Khalsa was more in line with the monotheistic reform principles of Protestant Christianity, and because B) The British favored the militarized Khalsa identity for Sikhs so that they could get more recruits in their army. The Tat Khalsa ultimately won out in most cases; for example, marriage was resolved by the Anand Marriage Act passed by the colonial administration in 1909. The ideology of the Tat Khalsa would eventually feed into the Akali party representing Sikh politics, and thus the modern Sikh identity that’s pretty much Khalsa.   That’s an overview of the history that I’ve read, and I hope I was as objective as I could be. Mud-slinging goes both ways, as Sanatanis claim the Lahoris were British stooges forwarding a Westernized view of Sikhi, and Tat Khalsa claim the Amritsaris were Hinduized and whose teachings were corrupted over time. As you can probably guess, I’m generally pretty strongly in favor of the Tat Khalsa ideology. I’ll have to parse my thoughts on what this means to me personally and for Sikhi today a bit more before I can comment on them.   Sources (not meant as a comprehensive bibliography but so that you can read for yourself):   Books:   Construction of Religious Boundaries, Religion and the specter of the West, Oxford handbook of Sikh studies (the Google Books link I posted a while back actually has the entire chapter on this topic readable, so definitely check it out).

Sikh,3aq6rp,Singh_Q6,6,Mon Jun 22 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"I recall that it wasn't just Chrisitanity that Sikhs were converting to, a lot of the Sikh aristocrats had converted to Islam.  I hardly see how both sides had legitimate arguments.  Arguments that involve ""because tradition"" are not good arguments. Just because many Sikhs had used Brahminical rites to get married, it doesn't make it right. Caste discrimination and female infanticide is widely practiced among many who call themselves Sikhs. Yet if you look at Sikhi and teachings of SGGS, these practices are antithetical to Sikh ideals.  Many Sikhs just didn't know about Sikh teachings. The only Sikh teachings my mum ever got back in Punjab was when a travelling Nihang would visit the pind (my nanke pind has a Nihang Gurdwara). He would teach the children how to read bani. My dad hardly got taught about Sikhi, he didn't even know the 10 Gurus names. I'd imagine that most Sikhs at the time were in a similar situation, there was no parchar of Sikhi in the pinds. So you get people following Sanatan style Sikhi.  Just because Sikhs used Brahminical rites, it would not justify Sikhs continuing to use them. Particularly how the Gurus argued against rituals and the power of the Brahmin.  Anand Karaj over fire any day, even if it is a recent invention.  Does the SGGS support Khalsa Sikhi or Sanatan Sikhi? I guess the right side won, although there are a few issues that have arisen. Namely the Abrahamic slant that has come into Sikhi."
Sikh,3aq6rp,Singh_Q6,4,Mon Jun 22 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't read anything suggesting aristocrats converted to Islam, and honestly, there's a lot of built-in preventions in early Rehits from that occurring (as it was probably a concern in the 18th-19th century). I think other than some blurring occurring during cooperation with Pakistan during the Khalistan movement, and the recent issues in Britain, Sikhs have maintained their identity from Islam pretty strongly.   Arguments that involve ""because tradition"" are not good arguments   Then again, these are the arguments that we use in the modern time to justify Anand Karaj along with other rituals. If religion is a social practice, it has to at some extent reflect the social reality of the time. I personally am more about getting to the core of Sikh philosophy, so I would think Brahmanical rites are out of line in any case, but you have to put yourself into the mindset of people at the time. (For the record, I'm happy the Anand marriage act ultimately prevailed)   Does the SGGS support Khalsa Sikhi or Sanatan Sikhi? I guess the right side won, although there are a few issues that have arisen. Namely the Abrahamic slant that has come into Sikhi.   This is a broader thing I think we should look at and that I ponder (I do, like always, agree with your thoughts on it though). First off, I think it's worth putting it into context of the exact time; did it support Tat Khalsa or Sanatani Sikhi as both ideologies existed in the late 19th-early 20th century? Ultimately, I do feel that Khalsa ideology is the best embodiment of Sikh teachings in so many ways; e.g., how Khalsa generally shuns religious authority while Sanatan accepts it. However, I think we can see in our modern and historical Khalsa that there were places that even they got wrong, not necessarily because the Khalsa ideal was wrong but because there is a wrong prioritization of ideals. I also call this ""the Guru Rehit Maryada,"" referring to how so many fundamentalist Khalsa even today seem to refer to Rehits more than GGS.  For example, the Khalsa militarizing was good to protect itself, but it also eventually led to a type of hyper-masculine militarized hierarchy that defied some teachings of Guru Granth Sahib. Some early [Khalsa] Rehits say not to allow women to read Gurbani or not to give women amrit, despite the teachings so clearly stated in GGS that we were supposed to be equal. There are also Rehits historically and modern that state you only eat food from other Amritdharis. I mean, I get the necessity for discipline and a feeling of brotherhood, but that's IMO way too much and directly infringes on the egalitarian teachings of Langar. One of my other caveats is that this military structure also leads to certain principles, like arrogance/ego, materialism, lust for power, petty violence and an overemphasis of violence (hence why national armies love recruiting us), and just greed, coming into play more than not in our panth despite what GGS says. Ironically I think this all comes back to something you said...   Many Sikhs just didn't know about Sikh teachings   I think it's been like this for a long time. Lots of British observers noted of the early Khalsa (pre-Sanatan in a sense) that:  1) Guru Gobind Singh was revered above all, and the other Gurus pretty much were seen as inconsequential compared to him  2) The Dasam Granth was revered as a holy text and despite not having its original jurisdiction the way GGS did, occupied a huge space among the early Khalsa because it was supposedly written by Guru Gobind and because it was militarized. Hence the famous saying that ""reading the Adi Granth made the Sikhs feeble, so Guru Gobind Singh created the DG to make Sikhs warriors"" (a claim I personally think is absolute BS but was historically renown)  3) Most Sikhs were rural Punjabis and didn't know how to read GGS, let alone the DG which is written in Braj Bhasha.  The most ironic part is how DG was revered among the early Khalsa who didn't understand it [but probably liked some of the martial themes], but that the DG was actually the primary text used to support Sanatan claims as much of what it has is Sanatan in nature (so is the Sarbloh Granth, the Adi Granth however doesn't fit the same bill). That's partially why Singh Sabha scrapped the DG and it doesn't play a big role in our lives today.   I ultimately am happy the way things turned out with the Tat Khalsa Singh Sabha coming out on top, but like you said, there are unfortunate relics like the Abrahamic slant, which was originally used to put Sikhi on an equal footing as Christianity. Nonetheless, in order to fix this problem in the future and do another take on what it means to be Sikh, I think we need to carry forward the legacy of intellectual discourse centered on GGS and Sikh philosophy (versus tradition) that the Singh Sabha definitely had.  Putting it succinctly: a lot of people say that our current panth has problems, and it sure as hell does, but I think looking at an accurate reading of Sikh intellectual history we find that we've fixed a lot of problems that our ancestors had. We tend to glorify history into hagiography too much and say ""man look at the old days and how we've changed and become bad today""; something that's perhaps a result of the Singh Sabha push to propagandize Sikh history to make it seem uniform."
Sikh,3aq6rp,maheep1,4,Mon Jun 22 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"Tradition does play an important role, but SGGS is more important than anything traditional. If the belief goes against the teaching of SGGS, you get rid of it. Just because its tradition, doesn't make it right.  I know thats not what you're saying, but people do seem to use rehats to support their views, more than the Guru.  The whole point of rehat is to tackle the social issue. In a way, the rehat is a reflection of society and culture. Its not infalliable, its written by people. The SGGS is ultimate, it is the mind. We must not think with rehat (the body), we must think with the mind. If rehat is going against basic teachings of SGGS, we must scrap that particular code.  For instance, the rehat that said ""don't wear green or red"". The SGGS doesn't anything about colours. So we can be sure that this rehat is not important for practicing Sikhi. However, when this rehat was made, it was an important part of ensuring Sikhs remained independent. Green is a colour often attributed to Islamic armies while red for Hindus. The rehat should modernise, we are no longer fighting Hindus or Muslims, so we don't need this rehat.  Similarly, the rehat about eating with Amritdharis. This was likely to protect against poisoning.  But people refer to these rehats and think ""oh, these rehats are historic, so we must follow them"". They don't understand that rehats are not on the same level as SGGS and are subject to change.  On the military point, Sikhs went against the very examples set by the Gurus themselves. None of the Gurus ever faught a war of aggression. They always faught in defence and as a last resort. Look at Anandpur Sahib, Guru Gobind Singh Ji even accepted the condition of leaving Anandpur Sahib to avoid war. They never captured land or took possessions.  But you have Sikhs fighting for land and empire.  Perhaps people are too lazy? This is a separate point, but Sikhi is a thinking religion, where you have to think for yourself. There are no special rituals or special prayers to get good karma points. But most people want an easy religion, to make a priest read some prayers, to just ""believe in a religion"" so they go to heaven.  Guru Nanak Dev Ji says,  ਪਹਿਲਾ ਵਸਤੁ ਸਿਞਾਣਿ ਕੈ ਤਾਂ ਕੀਚੈ ਵਾਪਾਰੁ ॥  Pehilaa Vasath Sinjaan Kai Thaan Keechai Vaapaar ||  First, examine the merchandise, and then, make the deal.  This is what I think many Sikhs do, even I do it. We want an easy life, to live our lives with minimal effort on religious matters.  Many Sikhs disregarded points in Sikhi that encouraged them to think for themselves, to live with truth, to respect each other.  Thats one reason why people never bothered to learn about Sikhi.  Another reason is a lack of parchar. They don't have an opportunity to spark their interest in spirituality.  I think the ""rural Punjabis can't understand SGGS"" is an excuse. The SGGS follows Punjabi grammar, large parts of SGGS can be understood by Punjabi speakers.  If you understand how Punjabi works, you can understand the language of SGGS.  I was not born in Punjab, my Punjabi is decent, but my vocabulary isn't great.  I am starting to understand SGGS, the more you read, the more familiar you get with the language.  Sure, you might need other resources, like a dictionary to understand some words and an understanding of other religions and their concepts, but the SGGS is not beyond your average rural peasant.  The SGGS was targeted at everyone, especially at the common man. There are shabads in SGGS aimed at farmers, often SGGS uses ideas and concepts that these people would be familiar with.  I made that post about SGGS and the idea of a warrior. The SGGS addresses these ideas and concepts. Guru Hargobind didn't have the Dasam Granth, yet he sat on a throne, higher than the throne of Delhi and was like ""come at me"".  I think the biggest issue is that people won't think for themselves, they won't question what people say. If such a rehat or that Baba or Sant said something, it must be true."
Sikh,3ap5zz,ChitownNomzy,7,Mon Jun 22 10:59:41 2015 UTC,"I suppose you're talking about West Punjab.  Are you from Pakistan? How many Sikhs have you met? How are they treated? Have you seen any old Sikh buildings? I'd love to visit Pakistan.  Many Sikhs have been living in those areas since the Gurus.  Guru Nanak Dev Ji walked all the way to the Middle East, there have been Sikh communities in these areas since the start. The Kabul sangat has been quite important since the early days of Sikhi.  Many Sikhs moved up into the mountains during the holocausts in the 1700s. During partition, there wasn't as much violence in the area.  Its due to the code of conduct of the Pashtuns, somthing about giving people asylum. There's also been movement of Sikhs from Afghanistan into Pakistan, so the population of Sikhs has increased in the area.  Most Sikhs in the Punjab region moved to Indian Punjab or were killed. There are a few Sikhs in Lahore and Nanakana Sahib.  Sikhs aren't Punjabi, Sikhs aren't anything, any race or ethnicity can be a Sikh. There are Afghan Sikhs, Sikhs native to NWFP, white Sikhs all kind of Sikhs. It was never the Gurus goal to make a religion only for Punjabis.  These Sikhs in the NWFP have lived there for generations, they have businesses, thats where they live. Many are moving because of Islamic extremism, but they are also people of that area. They probably don't want to leave or they might not be able to afford moving.  I would assume that they marry other Sikhs."

But add the  persecuted+opportunity seeking Sikhs and you have a greater population.   I hope that answers your question and I hope more Sikhs could add on or spot other possibilities. I'm simply stating from what I've seen from my own family's history."
Sikh,3anlls,pralinematchbox,0,Thu Jun 25 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"Well as far as Sikhs out populating Hindus that is only true for Canada. I live in America in a small town, there are like maybe 5-10 Sikh families in the area, and about 500-600 Hindu families. They're are big concentrations of Sikhs in certain areas in America, but Hindu Indians are like probably 30x the population of Sikhs in America.  Its not that we are not counted there is just an anomaly taking place in Canada."
Sikh,3al8o1,pickledpie,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:15:45 2015 UTC,So why have we become asleep and forgotten to take our justice?
Sikh,3al8o1,asdfioho,3,Sun Jun 21 08:16:30 2015 UTC,"I am still unsure of how you think we've become asleep. In that same Vancouver Art Gallery this year, Sikhs protested against India and against a Bhangra festival that was held on the same day as the Bluestar anniversary. In fact, 1984 seems to be one of the only things uniting our community, and it's our main political focus as a panth, as one can see from the countless ""remember 1984"" web pages or the constant references to ""Sant Ji's"" ideology. Not that I think that's a bad thing necessarily--in fact, I'm proud of how our panth has continued to keep our heads high. But it's very frustrating how so much political energy is spent on 1984 yet people still say ""Sikhs are asleep"" as a cliche time and time again, just for the sake of a nostalgic appeal to history."
Sikh,3al8o1,asdfioho,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:34:19 2015 UTC,"Lol but we are asleep. We haven't followed the gurus words and we are subjugated by falsehood in so many ways. There's literally justice that has not been done. Remembering it doesn't do an iota. I am speaking more than remembering, but acting. Sikhi needs to be revitalized to a whole other level."
Sikh,3al8o1,asdfioho,3,Sun Jun 21 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"We haven't followed the gurus words and we are subjugated by falsehood in so many ways   How does this have anything to do with 1984? It's not like as a community we somehow realized the light in 1984 and lost it later on...this is a separate problem   There's literally justice that has not been done. Remembering it doesn't do an iota. I am speaking more than remembering, but acting   Kinda vague, I can't really parse out what you are saying. Plenty of people are doing more than remembering. People like HS Phoolka are advocating for those who died in Delhi pogroms. Organizations like Ensaaf got Jaswant Khalra's killers arrested and are advocating for lost youth in Punjab during that dark time. Organization for Sikh Prisoner Welfare do advocacy for Sikh prisoners, as do people like Bapu Surat Singh. Just because you are unaware of these and are taking to the Internet to complain doesn't invalidate their efforts as sleeping.  What justice do you want to force more than what's been done? Kill everyone? The one man in history who single handedly killed more Sikhs than anyone else, Ahmed Shah Abdali, lived to a ripe age and died of the flu. Aurangzeb, the killer of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, lived to his 80s and died peacefully. We will never forget, we will never stop remembering and advocating as much as we can, but there is only so much you can do because of circumstance. I don't know what you want, but unless you have the power to conjure lightning bolts to ""serve justice,"" you're just among the part of the community speaking a lot but not actually doing anything, unlike all these other groups."

I've seen much the same corruption of values, and it's occurring at the hands of Sikhs making bad decisions themselves. You gain sovereignty in a new nation-state or whatever, those same bad decisions aren't going to go away.    This all happened because the right people were not in power   It also happens because our people are too paralyzed to take initiative themselves and always need a messiah to save us. Badal is not a dictator. We can dispose of him if we stick our heads into the current situation and don't solely blame everything on ""1984"" or ""sovereignty,"" something not really related to what you're talking about.    Real justice is to overcome all the things that are destroying our people now and that starts with the return of the spiritual and temporal authourity that the akaal takht symbolized.   You originally talked about justice for 1984 and now are talking about a broader concept that you umbrella under the term ""justice."" It's vague and I don't know how to respond. Pick a consistent definition and I can more coherently put together my thoughts"
Sikh,3al8o1,DrunkenSikh,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"I've been talking about something broader than 1984 the entire time. I posted this to show how inspired people were at that moment in oyr history and how that passion has slowly dissipated as we assimilate into a culture of acceptance. The reason badal is in power is because of an insurmountable imbalance of power due to various issues like poverty, class discrimination and a culture of selfishness, ego and greed. One that has grown so large that just being in india and being around the people who live there you feel a heaviness that permeates the society. A darkness and confusion that can never be changed from the inside because simply living in that society stoppers the ability to recognize exactly how wrong that whole culture has become. There's no more love in the families there. I know of family who fight eachother. We don't even have the bonds of filial piety that was such a natural part of our culture before. Now there is just greed and ignorance. No love. It's a battle against a culture of virtue to turn it into a culture of vice and it's happening on such a level that it permeates society and is almost impossible to recognize it's occurrence. This isn't even an issue specific to punjab. With the incredible power of corporations and the impact of globalization, the world is being hypnotized into this culture of ego, materialism and greed. The seeds of wisdom exist but only the meek hold them. When people start waking up, they will turn to the meek and the meek will roar like lions, the khalsa will establish it's raaj. The khalsa isn't just the panth of Guru Gobind Singh ji but the pure ones who exist in all places and are disturbed and confused at how corrupt and confused the world is."
Sikh,3aljlg,flatpatkahelp,6,Sun Jun 21 11:49:40 2015 UTC,You pretty much just tie a joora in the back and tie a package over.
Sikh,3aljlg,iMinerv2,4,Sun Jun 21 12:30:16 2015 UTC,"As someone who ties this patka, yup this is it. It may depend on how long your hair is though, and you also need to probably cut down your patka size a bit as you don't need the strings for this style and you just make the one knot and that's it (unlike the top joorha patkas where most people tie the knot, get the extra cloth and cover their head again)  I could never get used to a top joorha at this point, although when I do a Parna I kind of need to do a loose top one as the shape comes out really badly with the hair in the back  Some people say it's not ""proper"" and it looks ""gangster"" or whatnot but honestly my opinion is that all patkas look pretty informal anyway"
Sikh,3aljlg,asdfioho,3,Sun Jun 21 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"If your hair is too long, do ponytails around your head.  Do two ponytails at the front of your head, then wrap them around your head. Make a small knot or use a rubber band to tie the two pony tails up.  Tie a patka over that.  Also it helps to cut the patka so its the shape of your head.  Just see how much cloth you need to cover your head and cut the material so there is enough to tie a secure knot."
Sikh,3ajspt,iMinerv2,3,Sat Jun 20 22:02:01 2015 UTC,Tip for hair growing in general-don't do a Guth/braid. It makes your hair a lot longer than if you just let it grow normally and it becomes really painful to deal with later if you plan on tying it up and covering it
Sikh,3ajspt,asdfioho,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:54:23 2015 UTC,Painful in the sense that when you tie a joora it hurts your head?   I ask because my nephew will start having to tie up his hair soon and I wonder what the best advice is.
Sikh,3ajspt,Apollo_D,2,Sun Jun 21 07:18:32 2015 UTC,"It's just painful in that it's so much harder to maintain. My friends with braided hair usually first braid that hair and then tie it into a joorha, because it's too long to do a joorha with otherwise. Their hair is up to their legs or ankles...meanwhile mine is down to my lower chest and it doesn't grow beyond that point. I regularly clean and comb, but i would rather not have an extra inconvenience for no reason."
Sikh,3ajspt,asdfioho,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:29:24 2015 UTC,"That's more of a myth. Our hair is genetically ""programmed"" to grow a certain length - each strand. Some have longer than others.  Another of way looking at it: As Sikhs, we are to accept whatever length that hair is to be (and therefore not cut it before it reaches that length)."
Sikh,3ajspt,actujat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"While that's definitely true (hence why we have ""khojas"" in the first place), maintenance of hair is another secondary factor that influences if they can ultimately grow to their max potential. Braiding is a type of extra maintenance than if you just let it loose."
Sikh,3ajspt,asdfioho,2,Tue Jun 23 04:02:45 2015 UTC,This is a tough one. I personally think the easiest course of action would be to modify your pagh style to suit a larger joora. It's not easy but try to work with what you've got.

For me the key was to tie the joora on the top of the head in the shape of a jalebi (im not kidding, just look at a jalebi and that's what you want on top of your head. Your hair should wrap on top like that). Also make sure to tie a patka after that too."

Sikh,3adrcm,Dragearen,7,Fri Jun 19 13:18:07 2015 UTC,Combing the hair twice is but I've never heard anything about tying the turban twice. I always interpreted that as comb your hair in the morning before you put your turban on and then again just before you sleep.

The density of Muslims and Sikhs in the area is quite astounding (in general, the population is mostly migrant).   Whenever I see a woman in a hijab, I can't help but feel respect. Wearing a hijab seems to command it. Not only that, but she looks like a professional at whatever she does. It's difficult to explain, but it really rounds out a woman.  As for the turban, it commands similar respect, but instead of professionalism, I see wisdom. I can't help but smile at wisdom is it is something we should all strive to achieve.

Of course it takes some getting used to, I'm still getting used to it (sore neck and tender ears can happen after a few hours).  I don't know the name of the style I wear.  It looks a lot like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvN50HNIfqY I used to fold it before tying it (called pooni), but that's pretty difficult to do normally nevermind alone, so I've been experimenting with folding as I'm going and that's going to take some more practice."
Sikh,3adrcm,Dragearen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:18:25 2015 UTC,"One thing about that style of turban is that you only need to do the pooni once. The pooni can be done on your own as well.  If you get a few turbans and do the pooni, you can alternate between them, this will prevent them getting dirty.  Iron the turban well when you first do the pooni.  Get the material and fold it in half, then fold it in half again. Then iron it, so it stays in shape.  Iron the turban in sections, then wrap it up as you go. So iron a section, wrap it up and move on to the next section. This really helps keep it in shape.  When you tie the turban the pooni will stay in shape and you don't have to bother with fixing it up."
Sikh,3adrcm,Singh_Q6,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:22:25 2015 UTC,"How can you do the pooni on your own?  As it is it's pretty hard to get a clean fold with two people.

Sikh,3adrcm,Dragearen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:19:51 2015 UTC,"Get your material and an iron.  Get a section of the cloth, fold it and fold it in half again. Then iron this section to get the folds in.  Then when you iron this section, fold it up. I generally role the material up as I go.  Move on to the next section of the material and repeat.  I iron it the first time, the folds stay in place. Iron the sections as you go. This makes it easier.  I can get some pictures because it can be confusing."

Sikh,3adrcm,Singh_Q6,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:18:13 2015 UTC,"Doesn't that make it too wide?  Or do you have a half width turban?  I normally fold mine four times. I have one which is 5 meters and one which is 5.5 meters, both standard width (1 meter I believe)"
Sikh,3adrcm,asdfioho,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:16:44 2015 UTC,"I'll try get some pictures for you.  Don't do anything yet, but I think your turban is too wide for this style. This is normal as most turban material comes in a standard size. So what I do is cut the material down the middle, so I get two equal sized turbans. This allows me to tie the turban which is a similar style to the one you want.  Don't cut it yet though because I need to check the measurements of my turban."

One thing I remember telling one of my friends is that I tie a ""boat"" shaped turban, i.e., one with a peak (think Diljit Dosanjh) vs a round one (Daler Mehndi). Now whenever I tie it she's like ""Boat on point!"" A lot of them also notice that I look much more professional in an actual pagh vs a patka."

Yes: we live in a world where 24 hour broadcasting means the cycle is rapid and events come and go fairly quickly in the gaze of the media and the collective conscience.  I'm not hearing as much about this shooting in the news as I did when the Gurdwara was attacked though- maybe that's just because I paid more attention then or perhaps because media outlets are conscience of tensions and aren't concentrating on it as much to prevent stoking tempers.    Will the most prominent storyline be the heroics of the police officers, or will it be the stories of the community impacted?    The latter. Especially given the recent shooting by police of Walter Scott.    Will the government and prominent government figures visit the community impacted, or will they send/prefer remote involvement?    Yes because this is about race, Obama is black and personally knew people affected. He's coming to the end of his Presidency and is becoming more vocal on race relations and gun control too.    Will the discussion become all about the gunman's mental health?    I doubt it given that people are calling out the media for labeling brown perps as 'terrorists', blacks as 'thugs' but referring to mental health issues when the shooter is white.    How will the community impacted organize around this tragedy and respond?    Street protests I imagine although I'm not sure given how inflammatory this could be. They'll respond by pressing home the perceived notion that when blacks are victims they aren't given as much attention or support as when whites are. I don't know how much change these things can affect though.    What narrative will the impacted community rally around?    Seeking equality and reinforcing the message that racism is still an issue in the US."
Sikh,3abzky,brainmydamaged,15,Thu Jun 18 21:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'm close to your age. If you're going to go through with it than at least be safe.   Now you have to realize that the answer you will get kinda depends on how conservative or liberal the person on these kinds of issues. I personally do not see it as lustful if it's consensual and you both be safe and aren't doing it just to ""get it out of the way"". For me lust starts coming into play when a person starts cheating or is having fling after fling or is using sex to fill a void. Stuff like that. More conservative Sikhs and Sikhs from India will obviously say no to this act.   Having read GGS a few times I don't remember there being any particular verse that explicitly forbids premarital sex. The prohibition against it just comes from attitudes about sex at the time and in modern India. Like homosexuality. There's no prohibition against homosexuality in the GGS because the Guru is open and accepting and knows there's nothing wrong with homosexuality but go to India or talk to older/more conservative Sikhs and they'll tell you the homosexuality is wrong. My mom still believes that. There's Sikhs out there that believe wearing a tank top or short shorts is succumbing to kaam. Heck I've met Sikhs that say even kissing someone before marriage is lustful and against the guru. Still others have claimed interracial relationships are against the guru. There's a difference between what's in the GGS and what others have interpreted it to be based on personal beliefs and historical context.   That's the great thing about Sikh ethics vs the ethical system of abrahamic religions for example. It's not rule based. The abrahamic religions say no to premarital sex or extramarital sex or this or that because God said so in the Ten Commandments/bible/Quran. Sikhism says that the five thieves should be slain not because God just arbitrarily said so but because the five thieves get in the away of seeing the oneness and unity of God. Lust, ego, anger, and the rest distract us from God and being good people. In this scenario if the preoccupation with lust/sex is so great than you forget God or to be a good person than don't go through with it. But if it does not and like you said you continue to do naam japna than I believe that lust distracted you.   I'm your boyfriend's age. I don't consider it lustful. It's a natural urge with thousands of years of evolution behind it. It's nothing to be ashamed about. It's merely another part of life waheguru created for us to enjoy and to see if we can still remember him without being distracted. To be honest I think you're the opposite of distracted. You're still concerned with keeping waheguru in your heart and that is a great thing. If you can still do those acts with your boyfriend and keep waheguru in your heart than that's great and I'm happy for you  I was hesitant if I should even post this because I notice r/Sikh can be liberal at times or conservative at other times depending on who starts commenting first. I by no means think that my position is the right one and that others are wrong. I am just giving you my perspective which is different from the others. At the very least I recommend just thinking hard about it and doing your prayers and seeing what waheguru says to you and what your conscience says. Just know that the ""Sikh"" answer can sometimes be very different from each other depending on the context of the person and whether that person is following man made rehits or the actual GGS."

Sikh,3abzky,asdfioho,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:50:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. It's just kinda odd to see one group of people say one thing than another group say the opposite. It does kinda show how diverse our panth really is.
Sikh,3abzky,ash8795,6,Fri Jun 19 07:51:42 2015 UTC,"Pre-marital relationships are a very grey area for me. My personal view is that there isn't anything wrong with dating someone (from a Sikh perspective) if you honestly see yourself ending up in a long-term/married relationship in the future. I am in one myself, and it is always nice to adequately know the person you're with before formally committing.  The area I am a bit more confused about is stuff like pre-marital sex, which I assume is what you mean by ""strong desire of lust"".  First of all, I want to make something clear: there is no such thing as 'sin' in Sikhi. No angel is going to curse you if you have pre-marital sex, God isn't going to cringe and the Devil is not going to laugh. That is not Sikhi.  What is Sikhi is consequence. This is related to Hukam. Every action has a reaction and real-world effects, if on nothing else then on how your mind is aligned with relation to Waheguru's Hukam.  I mentioned this in previous posts in this sub and if you are interested in my view, have a look through here. To put it in simpler terms, it is your choice whether you wish you align your thoughts and your actions with the direction of Hukam and allow yourself to be carried by Waheguru's current, or turn and face some other direction attempting to swim to some non-existent destination all because we have allowed ourselves to succumb to the 5 thieves. At the end of the day there is no fighting Hukam- when we die, we are going to end up going in whichever direction Waheguru's current is taking us anyways. The only question is, are we going to spend our 80-odd years on this Earth fighting against it because we've been led to believe our happiness lies in the opposite direction (money, sex, wealth, clubbing, alcohol, drugs) or dissolve our ego, and allow ourselves to be naturally re-aligned through the power of Naam?  And yes, I do think it is natural. It may not feel that way now, but I do believe on the inside, every living thing was born with a desire to form a relationship with Waheguru. Just like we are born curious but all too often have it beaten out of us by the school system, society is constantly telling us ""no no no, that's not true! all you need is some more money, all you need is some more sex, all you need is some more alcohol when you go out on Friday night, and soon you'll be the envy of all your friends, the life of the party!"" I'm speaking from experience here. I've been in situations like this and grew up around people who were immersed in this lifestyle. The ending isn't pretty. There is no meaning in a life like this. I know some people who are older than me and still spend their Friday and Saturday nights clubbing, and they look like zombies. Guru Sahib tells us at the very beginning of Japji Sahib, The hunger of the hungry is not appeased, even by piling up loads of worldly goods.. Hundreds of thousands of clever tricks, but not even one of them will go along with you in the end.. We Mata Tek (bow our heads in humility) every time we walk into the Gurdwara, but do we listen to what our Guru is saying?  I think I've gone off on a bit of a tangent here, but the point is that it is up to us to decide whether we wish to accept Hukam or not. You yourself have described your desire as a lustful one, and I'm sure you don't need me to pull quotes to show what the Gurus had to say about lust.   Is it okay to commit lustful acts and still do naam jap?   Sure it is! I am being dead serious here, but I would not want to take away anyone's ability to Naam Japp, not even someone like Hitler. And from my experience with Sikhi, I'm sure the Gurus felt the same way.   So yes, you can do Naam Jappo. It does surprise me a bit though, because it is the people I know who do Naam Jap with their entire mind focused on it, with love in their hearts and complete devotion, who are often the best examples of individuals who have accepted Waheguru's Hukam in their lives. You are not a horrible person at all and I completely understand how crazy hormones are at this age because I am around the same. I would like to know how often you do Naam Jaap, because if you feel like you could be doing more, then it may be a good idea to try it out before taking this step with your boyfriend.  Why? Well think of it like this: in your relationship with your boyfriend, you two both commit a portion of your time to each other. You watch movies together, go eat out together, take walks together, listen to music together, joke with each other and through this process of spending time with one another, you have discovered that you have great chemistry with each other, that you see a future with this man, that you love this man, which is why you are now contemplating taking the 'next step' together.  Well, what about Waheguru? What kind of relationship do we have with our Ultimate Guru? It's not just a Master-Slave relationship. It's not just a Parent-Child relationship. The Gurus used both of those analogies in their Bani, but the one that strikes me as the most powerful is their description of the union between the soul/the human heart and the Eternal Waheguru. They explicitly used marriage imagery, calling Waheguru their ""Beloved"", and expressing their desire to meet their Love. O my Beloved, take me into Your Embrace!. Your depth is profound and utterly unfathomable; You are my Husband Lord, and I am Your bride..  Now here's a bit of a rhetorical question: on average, how much time would you say you spend with Waheguru every single week? What counts as ""spending time with Waheguru""? The Gurus have already given us the answer in SGGS ji: Naam, Simran, becoming absorbed in the Shabad, Seva and Sangat.  How much time do you invest every single week into nurturing your relationship with Waheguru? Now compare that with the time you generally spend with your boyfriend. Is there a large difference? It took a lot of time to nurture a proper relationship with your BF, correct? Well the same principal applies here. How are we supposed to nurture our relationship with Waheguru, if we are not prepared to invest time into it?   There's a reason why Guru Ram Das Ji tells us that to call ourselves ""Sikhs of the Guru, the True Guru"", we are to rise early in the morning, absorb ourselves in the Name of our Creator, and inspire those around us to do the same. This is called committment. It is called investing time into the relationship. How can we fall in love with someone if we don't even spend time with them? That is why we ask, O Guru, each and every instant, fill my heart with love; the Name of my Beloved is my breath of life.. We ask the Guru to help us fall in love, and the Guru has given us the gift of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. It contains everything we need to meet Waheguru.  The Path of Sikhi is the Path of Love. Guru Gobind Singh ji said ""Only those who Love God, come to know Him."" The Gurus did not beg for power, fame or material gifts. They asked only for the wealth of Naam (The Name of Waheguru). They were not motivated by fear (as is the most common criticism against any organized religion), they were motivated completely by the Love of Waheguru. And that same Love is what they wished for us to experience in our own lives. They were in love with Waheguru, in the purest sense of the word.  When we fall in love with someone in this world, their thoughts are always on our mind and their name is always on our lips (this is literally Naam Jappo, Waheguru's Name is always on our lips and our thoughts are always immersed in Waheguru because we have fallen in love with our Creator). I think we've all gone through a phase like that at least once in our lives. But the Love of Waheguru is the Ultimate Love, because it lasts forever and brings Supreme Anand (Bliss) into our lives. If falling in love with mere mortals can invoke such strong emotions within us, just imagine what falling in love with the Eternal Waheguru will do.  Everyone will give you their own advice, you are free to follow whichever you choose (or none at all), but here is mine: before taking your relationship with your BF to the next level (a step which you have said would be motivated by lust), try to honestly take a look at your relationship with Waheguru and where it lies on your list of priorities. My advice would be that before moving forward with your BF, listen to the SatGuru, invest some real time into your relationship with Waheguru and allow it to flourish. Even something like Naam Jappo with reading + understanding Japji Sahib would be a great start. Check out our commentaries if you haven't already. Have patience, give it some time, then listen to your own heart and do what you feel to be the right thing.  Good luck, bhenji."

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Seriously though, I don't think dating is a bad thing. However, I really don't know about premarital sex.  For amritdharis it is definitely something that is discouraged. For Sikhs themselves, sex should only take place with a partner you have commited to. Does that mean sex should only be within a marriage? Or does a long term committed relationship count?"
Sikh,3abzky,Singh_Q6,2,Fri Jun 19 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's also something that needs to be looked at culturally. As a westerner I can't speak for punjabi culture but from what I understand arranged marriages were the norm and still are to some degree. So the compatibility of the two people and their families are very important. Whereas in the west, sexual compatibility is considered to be very important in a marriage. Two people who are sexually incompatible may have an unhappy marriage, so it makes sense to have premarital sex in a committed relationship.  Not trying to say it's right, just giving a western perspective on the matter. I personally support premarital sex, and I don't think I could save myself for marriage, but I don't support the rampant one night stands in western culture."
Sikh,3abzky,Dragearen,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"I think we need to discuss what is it about marriage that makes sex okay to some people. As you say, do long term relationships count? To some sex in a relationship may be seen as inappropriate or wrong but suddenly when married then it's okay.   I definitely think that casual sex with strangers should be discouraged but sex between two consenting adults in a relationship, whether married or not, is completely fine."

Sikh,3abzky,pegasus199,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:28:28 2015 UTC,"If you believe sex should only be for having a child then so be it.   Recreational sex is completely normal and natural. It is exhibited by animals other than humans. And for humans it can help solidify a relationship plus much more. Some couples may not require much sex in their relationship and that's totally fine. I would say it's lust if their relationship is completely defined by sex, meaning that they have no other attraction or purpose for each other."
Sikh,3abzky,SkepticSikh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:02:58 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't buy a car without test driving it. If you know what I mean. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   This is something I used to be a huge proponent of a while ago, but I have become increasingly uncertain of it as of late. It was what I always heard growing up around my friends and it is what western society teaches as well, but is it really that great of an analogy?  Most of our parents who were married back in Punjab ""bought their car"" without ""test driving it"". So did our grandparents. And their parents. And their parents. And so forth. The concept of sex-before-marriage didn't really even exist in the west until relatively recently, so it isn't something that was just limited to south Asia. Even today in places like south Asia, the middle-east and Africa, it is still the norm for couples to only have sex after marriage.   Even our Gurus didn't ""test drive the car"" before ""buying it"". And their spouses were their greatest support system, and are the reason Sikhi is here today. Mata Khivi (Guru Angad Dev Ji's wife) stood by her husband at a time when it was make-or-break for Sikhi. Guru Nanak Dev Ji was gone, and the fledgling community he had created would have eventually disbanded (as was the norm after most spiritual teachers' death at the time), but the only reason it did not happen was because of the efforts of Guru Angad Dev Ji and Mata Khivi, who herself receives mention in SGGS Ji.  Or what about Bibi Bhani? The daughter of Guru Amar Das Ji, the wife of Guru Ram Das Ji and the mother of Guru Arjan Dev Ji. She too receives mention in SGGS ji (which is very rare for any family member of the Gurus), Guru Arjan Dev Ji actually included a full Shabad in SGGS Ji all from her perspective. Not only that, but there is reason to believe that she was also (at least in part) responsible for the future trajectory of Guruship, the line of human Gurus ending with her descendant, Guru Gobind Singh Ji.  Or Mata Gujjari, the wife of Gufru Tegh Bahadur Ji, mother of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and grandmother of the Sahibzade. Where would Sikhi be today if she had not raised her grandsons (the Sahibzade) with the memory of their grandfather's sacrifice? Of Guru Arjan Dev Ji's martyrdom for the Panth? To always stick up for what they believe to be right? What would have happened to Sikhi if Wazir Khan and Dewan Sucha Nand had been successful in coercing them to abandon the Khalsa Panth?  Or Mata Sundari, the wife of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. At a time when Sikhi was experiencing arguably its greatest ever split (Bandai vs Tat Khalsa), she kept the Panth together by reminding them of Guru Sahib's final orders, that after him, the Granth and the Panth would be the Guru. She did this even when it meant having to stand up to Banda Singh Bahadur, the man who with limited resources and an untrained army of peasants, brought Mughal power in Punjab to its knees. Where would Sikhi be without her heroics? Would we have experienced an eternal divide in our Panth, similar to the Sunni-Shia split shortly following the death of Muhammad in Islam? Mata Sundari is the reason that did not happen to us.  The point I'm trying to make here is that these examples are just the tip of the iceberg of great women without whom Sikhi would not be here today. And in every single one of those cases, there was no ""test driving the car before buying it"". But their marriages were extremely successful and as a team, the Gurus and their spouses made all the necessary sacrifices to keep Sikhi alive, and inspired their Sikhs to do the same.  Cars are pretty one-dimensional. We buy them to drive, maybe show off to our friends, but that's about it. When we use the ""test driving a car"" analogy, aren't we in a way saying sex is the main reason we're getting married? I'm not saying sex isn't important, but surely there must be things (like love for Sikhi) which come first, right? I'm not sure how I feel about likening my relationship with driving a car, or my partner to a car I must test-drive (i.e. have sex with) before I decide to buy."
Sikh,3abzky,ChardiKala,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:49:07 2015 UTC,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)     ChardiKala has really rustled this bot's jimmies!
Sikh,3abzky,dirtymindbot,2,Fri Jun 19 23:51:10 2015 UTC,"From my limited understanding, a lot of this is open to the interpretation and impact of societal norms.   The most accurate concept of Kaam that I've understood, as described by SkepticSikh below, is ""lust as a thief and lust does not mean sex. Lust is an intense desire or emotion for something. You can have lust for sex, for knowledge, for wealth, for food, for good health, heck you can have lust for Waheguru. If you're lust for something becomes so strong that you forget everything else in your life and that it controls you and defines you, then that's when it is a problem.""  Now, in regards to pre-marital relationships and sex: These are highly affected by the societal conditions under which they form. While 500 years ago it made sense to avoid pre-marital relationships and sex, this varies geographically in the present day and age. What I mean to say is, if a man and a woman had had a pre-marital relationship 500 years ago (or even now, in rural areas), this would likely have resulted in a lot of conflict for the couple within the community.  Furthermore, it is usually the female that got the shorter end of the stick. While a man can frequently get away with what he wants, a females 'purity' is/was highly connected to the respect of the family within the community. If something were to tarnish her image of dignity, then it would tarnish the dignity of the family. The consequences were, and still are, often more dire for the female. If it was discovered that a woman had had pre-marital sex, her image and value would be destroyed; it was likely that she would not find a partner thereafter, and she may be castoff by her community and family members. I say this because it is still known to happen today, quite especially in rural areas of India.   In consideration of all this, it made sense to avoid pre-marital relationships and sex, as it protected both individuals from ridicule and condemnation. I realise that this view may be limited, however I think that this is the sort of thing that affects which end of the 'grey' spectrum someone's position in this topic lands upon.   So, it is for the above reasons that I believe pre-marital relationships sex has been discouraged within Sikhi. Not because the Guru's necessarily believed that pre-marital relations were/are inherently sinful or lustful, but because avoiding them protects the individuals. I believe that the fact that these sorts of regulations are a part of the rehit as opposed to the SGGS may be evidence that the Gurus knew that these things are subject to societal pressures and change, rather than something that is inherently wrong and therefore set in stone as sin.   From there, you can decide how this would affect you based upon the details of your life and relationship. Btw, I believe that it is unjustified, harmful, and wrong for any of the members of this thread to say things such as 'you are young, this will harm you, this relationship is unlikely to last, etc.' They do NOT know your life or the intricacies of your relationship."
Sikh,3abzky,gsingh89,5,Fri Jun 19 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"guru arjan dev ji tell us not to even look at the opposite sex in a lustful way  guru teg bahadur instructions to guru gobind singh were to not even in though enter another woman's bed  bhai gurdas ji whose writings are key to understanding gurbani as declared by the fifth guru states to recognize all other aside from husband/wife as brother/sister mother/father etc.  Relationships of this nature should be avoided as they are lust coming under the guise of ""love"" you are very young. The chances of you still being with this person are slim. This is reality. I have seen many a Sikh get into this relationship business and ruining a very good Sikh jeevan.  You fill find it very difficult and soon impossible to jap naam when indulged in lust. Ultimately the choice is yours. You can take steps toward gurmat and listen to the advice given by the Gurus who fully understood human mind and its nature along with highly esteemed Gursikhs or you can let your mind win. If you do the latter most surely you will begin to fall away and become weaker in a Sikhi sense and your mind will not attach to naam and there will be no rass.  My advice is this. Do not engage in a lustful relationship it will only be detrimental to your spirituality. And surely you will begin a descent down a slippery slope into total manmukhi. I have seen this happen to literally dozens of Sikhs some who were even extremely chardikala. All it takes is one little slip up. One little mistake to begin the process of corrupting a jeevan. Do ardaas for strength to have mann neevaa and mat uchi and you will answer the question yourself if what you asking is ok.   Sexual encounters are cheap and fleeting moment in the face of gurmat. Do not become like most of society today who justifies all sorts of things to appease the own desires of their mind.  This is your first BF/GF. I do not think you understand yet what love is and are letting feelings of infatuation dictate your actions. Remember man jite jag jit - conquer your mind and win the world. He may or may not be in your life later. Do not do that thing which you will regret and repent over and over years later.  Last point to consider. One of the taboos of the Khalsa is adultry/fornication. Now think to the average person a murder may be worse than sex. So why did Guru Ji put sex as one of the four instead of murder. The Gurus were wise and knew the things that would destroy spirituality and cause disturbances in the mind.  Again Guru Sahib knows best. Seek answers from Gurbani to your question and you will clearly see that even ego and naam do not co-exist but you are talking about lust which is one of the lowest of the five vices.  My two cents"
Sikh,3abzky,makhann,4,Fri Jun 19 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"Lust is not the lowest thief.  Haumai (the sense of I, me) is the root of the other thieves. That is why we need to limit the sense of haumai. Indulging in haumai, extreme love of the self, will lead you to seek out things that will fuel this love of the self.  It will cause you to try to please this love of the self, you will murder for the self, take other's wealth for the self, you will rape others and oppress other people for the love of the self.  Sex itself is not bad, just like the act of killing something is not bad.  Killing someone who is a dictator and is oppressing others, that can be considered to be a good action. Killing innocents can be a bad action. The act of murder itself is not good or bad. That is why there are no commandments or rules in SGGS.  In the same way, sex is not good or bad. It is a part of life, which the Gurus encouraged rather than discouraged. They told us that celibacy is not special and it doesn't make you more spiritual.  However, I agree that a Sikh should not be over indulging in sex or having sex with anyone other than their partner."

Sikh,3abzky,asdfioho,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard of anyone, particularly Punjabi Sikhs, getting betrothed in childhood.  Child marriage is banned in the Rehat Maryada, so you can imagine how people would feel about arranging marriages for kids back then.  People tended to be around 18 when they got married. Guru Ram Das Ji was a young man when Bibi Bhani told Guru Amar Das Ji she wanted to marry a man like Bhai Jetha.  Marriage is interesting from a Sikh perspective. Considering the Sikh stance that rituals don't sanctify or make thing holy and the possibility that the modern Anand Karaj is a relatively modern ceremony for Sikhs.  Would the Gurus care if you got an elaborate ceremony with someone to get married? Is there any evidence as to how Sikhs would get married? What do puratan Rehat Maryadas say?"
Sikh,3abzky,Singh_Q6,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:33:49 2015 UTC,"I was referring specifically to the Gurus, actually. A lot of books talk about how so-and-so Guru got married when they were kids, but in reality the actual realtionship didn't start until later. However looking back via Google and seeing some dates, seems like maybe that wasn't true with the exception of Guru Angad Dev Ji. He got married when he was 15 and Mata Khivi was 13, but they didn't have their first kid until both were 20 and 18 respectively. I don't think the marriages were oppressively forced so much as just the cultural reality of the time (although old man-young woman marriages were never a case among the Gurus). It's good that our Rehat Maryada bans it.   Regarding marriages, the history is murky. There was a huge debate about this in the Singh Sabha time, between Sanatan Sikhs who favored the Hindu ritual and Tat Khalsa who favored the Anand karaj going around Adi Granth. The latter prevailed, and IMO for the best. I just did a search through the Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies, as I remember some cool sections regarding marriage. I can't access full text, but looking back at it right now, here's some points  -Certain Rehitname prohibited Brahmins/Pandits from conducting marriage rituals  -Apparently Gurbilas Baba Sahib Singh Bedi by Bhai Sobha Ram talks a lot about marriage customs at the late misl/early imperial period, but there's no English translation   -Apparently a lot of early Khalsa just used standard Jat marriage customs; something still observed today in how we have the Punjabi marriage rituals juxtaposed with the Sikh one of Anand Karaj  The Gurus' time is murky, as always.

Sikh,3abzky,makhann,0,Sat Jun 20 01:43:54 2015 UTC,What you posted is all about not committing adultery. If two people are not married and are in a relationship together then what's the problem?
Sikh,3abzky,SkepticSikh,2,Sat Jun 20 07:57:20 2015 UTC,"Last point to consider. One of the taboos of the Khalsa is adultry/fornication. Now think to the average person a murder may be worse than sex. So why did Guru Ji put sex as one of the four instead of murder. The Gurus were wise and knew the things that would destroy spirituality and cause disturbances in the mind.   The Gurus didn't declare sex as one of the five thieves. They had sex themselves multiple times!   They declared lust as a thief and lust does not mean sex. Lust is an intense desire or emotion for something. You can have lust for sex, for knowledge, for wealth, for food, for good health, heck you can have lust for Waheguru. If you're lust for something becomes so strong that you forget everything else in your life and that it controls you and defines you, then that's when it is a problem.    Relationships of this nature should be avoided as they are lust coming under the guise of ""love"" you are very young. The chances of you still being with this person are slim. This is reality. I have seen many a Sikh get into this relationship business and ruining a very good Sikh jeevan.   That is a really unfair thing to say."
Sikh,3abzky,SkepticSikh,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:19:28 2015 UTC,"He's referring not to 5 vikar, but the 4 kurahits or basis of ejection from Khalsa order according to Rehit. Includes eating halal, smoking tobacco, cutting hair, and premarital sex. I don't really think though that something being a kurahit means it's worse than murder, it's just for discipline and identity proposes in my mind."
Sikh,3abzky,asdfioho,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:58:55 2015 UTC,"Oh I see, my mistake. I wasn't aware of kurahits.   /u/makhann said that the Gurus declared it as one of the four kurahits. To my knowledge the Gurus didn't write the Rehat Maryada, that came after so surely it's not correct to say Guru Ji declared it as a kurahit."
Sikh,3abzky,SkepticSikh,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:27:46 2015 UTC,see my reply to Mr Paneer and Mukhtnama by Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Gurus didnt write the rehat in fact not many people did aside from a few. As rehat has always been orally passed down. Even today at amrit sinchaar it is orally passed down. You aren't handed a pamplet. The SGPC is the only attempt at writing a common rehat down and even in it the controvery is about meat and kes/keski as a kakkar. There is no disagreement on whether or not sex outside of marriage is ok. It is a taboo known as bajjar kurehit
Sikh,3abzky,makhann,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:50:42 2015 UTC,"Firstly, the Gurus had sex with their wives only. What I mean by adultry/fornication is outside marriage. I never said it was one of the five theives but it is one of the bajjar kurehits (if you're a khalsa) if you are not a khalsa that doesn't mean that these are ok via gurmat.  The OP is referring to sexual lust and as the five theives lust is referred to in sexual reference. The other anger, greed, attachment and ego.  lust for waheguru is not called lust is called pyaas. again lets talk what the OP is referring to as lust and what the Gurus referred to as lust and not our own definition which can cause confusion"

IMHO, the sikh approach is to really see Waheguru underneath everything.  What that means for you may be different than for me or /u/pegasus199.   For instance, seeing waheguru in all, to me, practically, means to not hurt others. Thus, to me, it means have an honest discussion (and introspection) about everyone's expectations. If everyone is on the same page (including stakeholders outside the two of you), then the only way to have sikh sex is with Naam simran!  Otherwise its just two god-less meat popsicles slapping against each other. I'd say the sikh approach is to marvel about how wonderfully waheguru programmed these bodies, and appreciate that, while having a great time!

If you are to obtain Anand by reaching God, our main goal then you have already taken the wrong step. Don't see me as discouraging though. It's just that why are you in a relationship? You are still 18, a lot of stuff can happen and you shouldn't be keeping things secret from your family. There's no place for gupt in Sikhi. You can't be so confident. A GurSikh who is in Anand, believes in the will of God and confidence of a relationship exists within your mind but my not be in the way of fate. I am also 18. I have gone through many heartbreaks and hearts broken. Sex makes it even hard for separation. A Sikh in bliss doesn't feel attachment in this world and all this Maya. I'm not trying to preach but more teach of what our ultimate goals as Sikhs are. Remember that Sikhism and Punjabi culture are different. Punjabi parents obviously don't want you to have sex because its taboo. Sikhism wants you to live the life of a saint and soldier fighting off lust until a marriage which is solid. Dating world plays a lot of hurt on the heart. Here's a video that answers part of your question. I'm not trying to break you up but you have to choose between bliss or maya by the situation you're currently in. text  Good luck & Chardi Kala Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh"

If we take a look at this pauri, the message is that Waheguru's storehouse is within all beings, within all worlds.  Whatever is placed within these things is done once.  You can interpret this as the storehouse is Waheguru. The One is eternal, it does need replenishing.  What does storehouse mean? Is storehouse refering to physical resources? Is it talking about spiritual resources?  Could you interpret this pauri as talking about spiritual wisdom?  Are some people born more ""spiritually inclined"" than others?  This spiritual wisdom is found in all beings. However, this wisdom was placed in all beings once. At the start of their lives. Some people will be interested in spirituality, they will want to find Waheguru, while others will find it harder to connect with Waheguru.  I don't know if this interpretation is in line with SGGS."
Sikh,3abhv8,doorz1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:32:14 2015 UTC,"Slightly off topic, I noticed some people are more spiritual vs others. Does this depend on upbringing or is it the persons nature?"
Sikh,3abhv8,SkepticSikh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:43:16 2015 UTC,I was hoping we could discuss this issue.  Thats what I noticed from this pauri. The storehouse might be used to refer to spiritual knowledge.  Some people are more spiritual than others. I have no idea if people are born more spiritual than others. Perhaps it has something to do with our envrionment and nature.
Sikh,3abhv8,DrunkenSikh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:26:02 2015 UTC,I think this could come back to Hukam. I'm sure there's a line in the GGS that says something like by Hukam some are brought closer and others are driven away.

Sikhs don't live hermetically and active participation in family and community life is incumbent upon us by dint of honest work, the fruits of which we are told to be generous with.  I volunteer at the homeless shelter as a way of helping others but if I go to school, get a well-paid career going and then donate money to the shelter on top, that will go further than what I currently do which is serving meals and cleaning.

America has been this way since its founding. The federal government's primary job is managing interstate relationships and external relationships. This includes military. And on the contrary, for the past 100 years, it has been increasing the spending on ""good governance"" (whatever you mean by that). Unprecedented spending on healthcare over the last 30 odd years, and especially the last 5 years. Public education spending has been going up over the last 50 years and I'm sure you know the history of spending on social security.   The federal government supports military work. That's their job. This medium we are using to even communicate with each other is because of a military grant given in the 60s. Either you are playing naive or have some agenda to forward.   The CIA is running a torture regime. See also illegal detention, extradition, black sites, etc.   I don't want to defend the torture but it is disingenuous to calling it a ""torture regime"". It's apparent you want to forward some narrative here.    The American military has killed more civilians in Iraq than militants. I don't think its 'loaded' to call it a killing regime, the media and public are encouraged to call it a regime that 'fights for us' or our 'freedom'; that's real loaded language when its not congruent with reality. Is there a more accurate way to generally characterize what the military has 'done' in Iraq?   Which is bad. There is a lot of propaganda language used as well, I agree. And yes there is a more accurate way to characterize this: it's an effing WAR. It is a serious conflict that has seen a lot of bloodshed, countries ruined and infrastructure damaged. It has caused American Sikhs and Americans Muslims to be hurt as well. But calling it a killing regime has the same propaganda language as ""fighting for democracy!!!!"".   In Sikhi, we use moderation, even in language. The Kirpan is a symbol of moderation and self control. Propaganda language subtly evokes the Panj Vikar which is counter to Sikhi.   Anyway, the discussion about America being a killing and torture regime is better suited for the comment section at /r/politics."

Sikhi is about spreading Gurbani and changing people's direction so that they can walk on the Hukam like the Gurus did.    War largely destructive.   Depends. I would argue surgical drone strikes significantly minimize collateral damage. Just my opinion, not something I claim comes from Sikhi.   Dastaar is important.    Depends. Gurbani critiques ritualism and even calls out the turban on SGGS ang 470. It's important for a subset of Sikhs. There is precedent in it being an integral part of a Sikh identity. It was allegedly a direct command of a person that all Sikhs consider to be divinely guided. I am not completely sure on who the command was for ('baptized' sikhs? all sikhs? all of humanity?). But I think we can agree that it was most likely a command by Guru Gobind Singh to 'some' Sikhs for sure.    Disingenuous for hagiography to dissolve the complexity [what complexity?] of the Iraq war to ""killing civilians.""   You used specific words ""killing regime"" and ""torture regime"". Deliberately used to evoke emotion. I didn't agree with those, just like I wouldn't agree with those labels for Guru Gobind Singh's army, Maharaja Ranjit Singh's army (killed a lot of innocent Pathans) or Mughals (killed a lot of innocent Hindus and Sikhs). But maybe I am being overly pedantic. Does that clarify things?   Sikhs are not strong enough at critiquing the American state, but we are good in other places like Canada.    Not really. Sikhs are finite. Our consciousness is finite in America. Our energies are bounded. We should focus more on parchar than civil rights in my opinion. I'm not sure how much parchar is going on in Canada. This goes in line with the beginning of this comment. Sikhi is about parchar. We need to do focus more on that. If the core of our philosophy is not ironed out, what's the point in criticizing America, India, Canada, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, etc? If we don't have a theory of justice outlined clearly in our philosophy, on what basis can we criticize? I personally don't give a s--- about these  criticisms that just add to the noise (there is plenty of critique from every tom, dick and harry). I am more interested in understanding the Sikh theory of justice and Sikh theory of war which would then allow me to understand the Sikh position on these things.   I think that one has to suspend Sikhi in order to be interested in ‘rights’ that were born in the Enlightenment (liberalism; Liberalism and Empire; Uday Singh Mehta) and enshrined through institutions like the UN (human rights post wwii; the origins of totalitarianism; Hannah Ardent) and the American constitution (religious accommodation; Sikh Coalition; influential American Sikhs) of this kind.   I agree partially. We need to understand these rights in the Sikh / Gurmat system. We (Sikhs) quickly conflate Sikhi's ""modern"" and ""liberal"" system with this western enlightenment system you are alluding to. That is wrong in my opinion. I am interested in knowing what we can derive in the Sikh philosophical system. Can we even build up a system that is similar to the western one? Should we be building up such a system? What are the core axioms of the Sikh philosophy that we can use to reason about these things? All I see is a vast void when trying to find something that rigorously links Sikhi to the modern political movements. This again ties in with my previous point. We have a lot more work to do on the ground floor before trying to build the 30th floor. Otherwise, I fear, Sikh philosophy will remain a shell, constantly distracted by outsiders and elements within the community to support arbitrary causes.   This partly explains my reluctance on passing  judgement on these 'regimes' as you put it. I want to see reasoned arguments in Sikh system. If such a system does not exist, then build it up. But there is some truth in what you say. The coalition, for example, is using the western ""civil rights"" narrative to get turbans accepted in the military. They are neither using nor  contributing to the Sikh philosophical system.   American hegemony, imperialism, torture, etc ... I care only to some level. The Sikh philosophy to explain all this and how a Sikh should react to all this, that I am really interested in. I would for love you to contribute to the development of the Sikh philosophical system as well.    I am not convinced that this is the right way of securing ""Sikh interests"" (what are they), especially at the expense of what Sikhi teaches about common humanity.   That is what I want to read a lot more about. How is this tradeoff justified in Sikhi? Why should such a tradeoff not be done in Sikhi? I want to see more written about that. We need rigor in Sikh philosophy.  Personally, I see this as a necessary part of the larger picture of propagating gurmat in the west.    You mention Sikhi is about fighting for righteousness.   One, small aspect of it partially includes that. If you think that is my view of Sikhi, then I have not been communicating clearly for the last two years.    By jettisoning elementary Sikhi in our activism, we're just Americans in the public sphere who believe in the turban and beard, which actually is the ""giving up of my religion"" that is quoted, rather than perhaps the disrespect of the idea of sarbat da bhalla. That's fine, but I don't think anyone wants that.   Can you separate Sikhi from a ""Sikh activist""? If they are elementary, it is because we as Sikhs have not done a good job in educating ourselves and others about Sikhi. And I don't mean ""Sikhs wear the 5 Ks, Sikhs wear a turban"" etc. I mean that we have completely neglected the Sikh scholarly tradition in the last century. We have, at best, an extremely outdated philosophical struct in the form of an archaic rehit maryada. Almost no rigorous treatment of Sikh philosophy exists from the last 100 years as far as I can tell. So yea, it is elementary. It is up to us to provide the rigor needed in implementing our faith in today's world.    So Guru forbid that Uncle Sam puts Amritsar in his crosshairs tomorrow, are the Sikhs going to have a celebration banquet for Captain Rattan for going AWOL when he has participated in the same system that has radicalized (drones breed terrorists), racialized (producing Islamophobia which has killed Sikhs at home), tortured (CIA, Guantanamo, in the battlefield), silenced (whistleblowers) and killed hundreds of thousands of people (including 300 wedding goers wohoooo) in our time? If history is to believed, probably.   I agree. It happened with the British. It happened in 84. It will happen again. If not with America, it might happen with some other world power in 300 years. This is part of the mayapic cycle. That is one of the reasons I personally am more interested in the Sikh philosophy because even if there is a genocide of Sikhs in America by Uncle Sam using your tax dollars and Captain Rattan at the forefront, at least Sikhi can have a chance to survive.    I have a feeling that you're under-informed about the wars and US military.   K.   I am against the moment we find ourselves in.    I kind of agree. Like I said, we have bounded energies and as a panth we need alot more energy dedicated to shelling out sikh philosophy and parchar in america. I think the strong punjabification of Sikhi over the last 150 years has been very detrimental to the ideology.    The current Sikhs in the military should be free to do whatever it is they want and still call themselves Sikhs despite the fact that invariably some of them are probably murderers.    See, I am intrigued by your usage of the term murderer. I am so lost trying to come up with the Sikh view on this. Was Guru Gobind Singh a murderer? Were the Khalsas who were killing the pathans murderers? Maharaja Ranjit Singh's army? The Sikh in WWI and WWII? Binderanwala and his followers?"
Sikh,3a7n9y,DrunkenSikh,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:42:25 2015 UTC,"Not going to get into this civil war between Americans, but my thoughts on murder.  Sikhi doesn't have commandments, there are no blanket rules you have to follow.  There is the idea of the 5 thieves and applying bani to life.  Murder is not good or bad, it is an act. It just exists, it is a process, just like creation and desctruction are processes.  Is murder caused by the 5 thieves? Are you murdering for the self? Are you doing it because you want power and control? Then Sikhi does not support your actions.  Are you doing it to defend yourself and others? Have you tried to use other methods to solve the problem? Is picking up a weapon the only option you have left? Then the act of murder can be justified."
Sikh,3a7n9y,pickledpie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"Murder is not good or bad, it is an act.   Agree. But the important thing to remember is that by killing, we stop the jeev's journey on the Hukam. What if it was too early for that jeev to stop the journey? What if we stopped it from getting mukti? Do we as Sikhs even have that ability or is the Hukam something more fundamental to it?  But in general, I agree with your thought process. That is the view I derive from Gurbani personally."

Sikh,3a7i7h,beardhelppls,5,Wed Jun 17 20:57:15 2015 UTC,"I have talked to many different sardars (my cousins in India, my friends, and online forums) about what products and methods they use to manage their beards...and I found everyone has their own preference based on the size/thickness/uniqueness of their beard. I'll tell you my experience...perhaps it can help.   When my beard was starting to really grow and look a bit bushy (around grade 12), I started using some strong/max hold hair gel...it was very easy to apply, quick, and had great results for my short beard. I used this method for 3-4 years.  As my beard started getting a bit longer, my cousin in Delhi suggested tying it up and using ""Simco hair fixer"" (Fixo, blue bottle) along with a Tathi/tatha (vertical beard-width cloth around the head and tied at the top). I tried it and wow...it was great. The exact process was: I would wet my beard a bit and comb my beard with a beard brush to straighten the hair. Then, on my hand, I would dilute the fixo (approx 1 ml) a bit with a couple drops of water (so it wouldn't feel like glue on my face) and then apply it uniformly to the entire beard. Next, I would quickly tie a little rubberband at the bottom and tuck the beard under my chin with a hair pin (I believe there are some YouTube vids of people showing this process). Then I would apply the Tathi and let it air dry for 10-15 minutes. And this process worked great. Eventually I incorporated a moustache Tathi as my moustache got a bit longer. This method worked very well for 2-3 years.  But then I couldn't manage my beard very well...it would not stay put. Some patches would stick out and not stay put. I tried extending the duration of the Tathi to 20-25 minutes, but that only helped a little. I also tried using hair gel instead of Fixo, but it was way too sticky and uncomfortable for me...so I went back to Fixo. A friend suggested using some hairspray to help ""fix"" the messy patches. So after my 10-15 minutes Tathi air drying, I would spray hairspray (Pantene brand) onto my fingers and apply it to the areas that needed ""repair"". Then I would put on the Tathi again, and use a hairdryer for 60-90 seconds to let it set. This worked great and I used this method for many more years.   Recently I discovered the ""got2b glued blasting freeze spray""...this changed things for me. This spray works so damn well that I now use a faster method to get ready. Basically, after applying the (diluted) fixo and Tathi, I immediately use the hairdryer for 2 minutes (no more air drying). After removing my Tathi, I still have a few messy patches...as expected. Then I spray got2b onto my fingers (I wish they had a non-aerosol version) and apply it to all the patches. I also use it on my moustache to strengthen the hold on it. Next, I apply the Tathi again and hairdryer it for 30-45 seconds...and that's it. It works perfect. It is a faster method and stays put the entire day. (Before discovering the got2b spray, I tried this faster method with the Pantene spray...but I wasn't happy with the result.)  Anyway, I thought I would share as much information as I could...I know when I was searching, I found very little information to help me. However, I never stopped asking others what they used/did. My advice is to keep experimenting until you find something that works for you. Best of luck, bro!"

Sikh,3a7i7h,hellomenty,2,Thu Jun 18 04:18:00 2015 UTC,I don't use anything aside from a water based gel to make it less frizzy. I like having a full beard instead of tying it up but when I'm at the hospital I have to tie it up so I don't get hair all over the place and on my patients.
Sikh,3a7i7h,starminder,2,Thu Jun 18 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion: Don't bother tieing your beard. I was in grade 12 when I started tieing it, starting with just hair clips and then escalating to rubberbands, fixo etc. A few years later, I felt it was becoming cumbersome and annoying to tie my beard, so I stopped. It took a lot of courage because I live in a foreign country and people around me aren't used to long beards. Although it took a few weeks to get used to, it was a great decision and I wish I had never started tieing it to begin with.  My tips: shampooing everyday made my beard smell bad if I stopped for even a single day, I now shampoo one a week or so and it works great.  Get a brush. The feel of brushing your beard and getting it smooth is just heavenly :) In general, the simpler your routine, the better."
Sikh,3a7i7h,SikhMagnet,2,Fri Jun 19 11:02:29 2015 UTC,"When I used to have a beard, I used to use extra-strength hair-spray, I really liked TRESemme brand, their strongest hold version.  I would hairspray it nice and good and I would use a hair-dryer for a few minutes to really lock it in.  I could also get it shaped exactly how I wanted it.  While there was some hair-spray residue, it was not much and it made my beard look more natural and still somewhat soft but still tamed.  I didnt like using gel or fixo, i didnt like that plastic look or feel."

If it isn't satisfying I also use beard oil but recently started to use Argon Oil which is a lot cheaper and contains more, just a drop or two will really help it become more manageable.  Hope this helps.  Also buy a brush for your beard, one that works with you."

When Guru Gobind Singh ji created the Khalsa he also wrote 52 hukams, or laws, for Gursikhs who take Amrit and become part of the Khalsa to abide by.  Those 52 hukams include laws such as a Singh must wear the 5 k's, must not partake in alcoholic drinking, must wake up at Amrit vela, donate dasvand etc. And one of the hukams is: Dastaar binaa nahee rehnaa| Never be without the turban/dastaar.  Imo it is only Sikhs who take Amrit and become Gursikhs who are bound by any rules at all. Non-Amritdhari Sikhs have not committed to anything, but Gurbani teaches that every Sikh should aim to become a Gursikh, therefore take Amrit and abide by the hukams, and thus not be without their dastaar."

Sikh,39kefp,asdfioho,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"The turban is not part of 5 K's hence why it's not worn all the time like the kakkars are supposed to. People tie casual turbans while working for example that you would never wear in a formal setting or even Gurdwara. However, early Rehitname (codes of conduct) as well as history books specifically state that the Khalsa is supposed to wear turbans, and many also banned the topi (Hindu cap). The reason is that turbans are cultural, but in a specific context. There are of course the casual headwraps people across South Asia wear to protect against heat and such, but the pagri or dastar was specifically a crown worn solely by aristocracy or royalty. In Pakistan today, where feudal systems still exist, you'll see that all the lords wear turbans and pride themselves on it as a sign of their sovereignty. As such, the turban represents a crown or the self sovereignty for Sikhs of all classes, while kakkars are more solely for identity and practical purpose. The turbans purpose is different than a kakkar and thus it's treated a bit differently, but it's not just like it happened to be what Sikhs in Punjab at the time wore.   One may say ""well wait the turban isn't a sign of royalty anymore,"" but I think it's a unique dynamic that's still relevant, whether as a form of non-conformity and unique identity abroad or as part of the identity of Sardar Ji's in South Asia."

Sikh,39k4gv,MrPaneer,3,Fri Jun 12 08:12:28 2015 UTC,Completely agree! With the help of raags one can easily learn the emotion of the shabad and translate the meaning more readily.
Sikh,39k4gv,iMinerv2,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:37:08 2015 UTC,"It is a complicated yet common problem.   We have the wonderful work of Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha, the Mahan Kosh, which is available on srigranth.org. I like to use that as a reference to check common translations (which is what made me realize how inaccurate the common translations are).   Next would be to use famous Teekas, like the Faridkot Teeka. I haven't been able to approach it because it is exclusively in Punjabi.   Third would be to understand the symbolism of the Raags, and let them color your reading of the shabads in that chapter. The Raags will help disambiguate the meaning of a word if there are multiple translations which don't all refer to the same concept. Example, Raag Tilang has a 'yearning' aspect to it and Raag Asa has the aspect of 'evergy' and 'confidence'. The same pankti can have a different meaning if it was in Raag Tilang or Raag Asa."
Sikh,39k4gv,DrunkenSikh,2,Fri Jun 12 17:28:43 2015 UTC,"Prof Sahib Singhs Teeka is another great teeka, although its only in Punjabi.  I normally use Mahan Kosh, the teekas and my own understanding of Gurbani to translate the shabad. If you want more perspectives on a shabad or bani, you could listen to katha."

Mostly because I don't live near many Sikhs so have never really socialised with other apne so it's hard to find Sikh girls to date. I also find apne can be a bit cliquey and I'm on the outside of that.   I've never introduced any girls to my family or parents and don't intend to unless I am certain I'll marry them because I like to keep my romantic and personal life separate.

The event? Black crows diving into the water and turning white. I wonder if certain uncles and aunties narrated the stories, it would be Africans going into the water and coming out as Europeans.   Just the other day I read a prophesy from about the same time period that some Sikhs in villages started believing that the Khalsa Raj would arise again; and manifest itself by slaughtering all British men and enslaving white women in their homes (similar to how they perceived the Brits viewed them). Definitely not in line with Sikh principles, so where'd the prophecy come from? The miracles people witness are often more-so commentaries on the social beliefs at the time.

Sikh,39ggdm,autowikibot,0,Fri Jun 12 09:55:13 2015 UTC,"Ball lightning:       Ball lightning is an unexplained atmospheric electrical phenomenon. The term refers to reports of luminous, spherical objects which vary in diameter from pea-sized to several meters. It is usually associated with thunderstorms, but lasts considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightning bolt. Many early reports say that the ball eventually explodes, sometimes with fatal consequences, leaving behind the odor of sulfur.    Until the 1960s, most scientists argued that ball lightning was not a real phenomenon but an urban myth, despite numerous reports throughout the world.  Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but whether these are related to the natural phenomenon remains unclear.  Many scientific hypotheses about ball lightning have been proposed over the centuries. Scientific data on natural ball lightning are scarce, owing to its infrequency and unpredictability. The presumption of its existence is based on reported public sightings, and has therefore produced somewhat inconsistent findings. Given inconsistencies and lack of reliable data, the true nature of ball lightning is still unknown.  The first ever optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball lightning event was published in January 2014 and included a video at high frame rate.

Sikh,39ed1f,PickleShaman,4,Thu Jun 11 04:21:30 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the questions! I'll reply to the ones I can:   How would you summarise the core beliefs of Sikhism in a few sentences, to a complete stranger to this religion?    I can do it in one. The same summary Guru Nanak Dev Ji used. The Mool Mantar, the very first line in SGGS ji. To read it, click here.  Now this one sentence is actually extremely deep, and while it does summarise the core tenets of Sikhi, I wouldn't skim the surface with it. To offer some perspective, Basics of Sikhi did a lecture on it where it took over 2 hours to complete the entire thing, and that was them going fast. I've seen videos where Jagraj Singh (who set up Basics of Sikhi) talking about how he's done hour-long lectures on 'Ik Onkar' alone, and that is just the first part (just the ""ੴ"") of Mool Mantar!  So while it is a summary of the philosophy of Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji, it does take a while to understand. I highly recommend going through this thread to see the commentaries offered on it by the members of this sub, there is a lot of great information in there. Mool Mantar is explained and expanded on through the Japji Sahib, written by Guru Nanak and comprising the first 40 stanzas of Guru Granth Sahib. For the Japji Sahib and the commentary of it, have a look at this thread.   Do you think you would be drawn to Sikhism if you were not born into it?   My family are Punjabi, but I wasn't really 'born' into Sikhi. No one in my home practices it, I wasn't raised to be a Sikh and growing up, going to the Gurdwara was just a cultural/social thing. I was an atheist/anti-theist (I still have books by Dawkins and Hitchens lying on my bookshelf :p ) and when I told my parents I didn't consider myself to be a Sikh, they didn't care. (I've actually gotten way more resistance from them now that I am into Sikhi, and they've straight out told me to just forget about it).  I'm not the only one on here with this background. A lot of others come from a similar place. A lot of us once weren't religious, and we shared our experiences in this thread.  So in my case, I wasn't born into Sikhi (didn't even know the names of the Gurus until a while ago), but I still became Sikh. Same with a lot of others on here.   Do you see any drawbacks in Sikhism?   The biggest drawback I see is its ethno-centricism. By that what I mean is, 99% of Sikhs in the world are Punjabi. And while the Gurus always intended for Sikhi to be for everyone no matter where they came from, most of our population is concentrated in the villages of Punjab. What this unfortunately means is the mixing of Punjabi culture with Sikhi, creating a situation where for many, it is difficult if not impossible to tell the two apart.  On the flip side, I think the 21st century is going to see Sikhi becoming a truly 'global' religion, given the rise of Parcharic activities among the youth today, especially those in the west. The more diverse we become as a Panth, the less of a hold Punjabi culture will have on Sikhi.   How do you see Sikhism fitting into the modern secular society   Very well. The 19th century Sikh Empire of Maharaja Ranjit Singh was arguably the most secular the subcontinent had produced till then, and I myself have strong secular leanings and don't really see any problem at all.  Sikhi isn't concerned about imposing itself on others. It is concerned with taking those who have chosen out of their own free will to walk the Path of the Guru and uniting them with Waheguru. Sikhi is a choice. The Gurus only asked for followers who desired to be Sikhs, not followers who had been coerced into it.  If YOU desire to play this Game of Love with Me, then step onto My path with your head in hand. (Guru Nanak Sahib). Sikhi is for those who desire it, and it developed in one of the most religiously pluralistic regions in the history of the world, and the Gurus respected them. I don't think there should be any real problem with Sikhi fitting into a greater secular framework.   and do you think it will evolve in time to come?   Probably. Guru Gobind Singh Ji has given the Khalsa (collective body of Baptized Sikhs, male and female) complete Political Power within Sikhi. The Guru Granth Sahib is our living mind/light of the Guru, the Khalsa Panth is our living body/form of the Guru, and we have the power to revise our practices when the need arises. The last time this happened wasn't even that long ago (the modern Sikh Rehat Marayada was only published in 1950), and I don't see why it couldn't (theoretically) happen in the future. The only things in Sikhi I can think of which are unchangeable are the Guru Granth Sahib (which contains a universal spiritual message I don't think will ever stop being relevant anyways), and the 5 K's, the identity of the Khalsa. Most everything else can probably be revised if the ned be.  We have had similar discussions on here in the past. If you are interested in reading some thoughts about scholarship in Sikhi and how it can contribute to the secular west, then this thread makes for a nice read.  If you'd like to read a bit about what a possible 'Sikh State' (if such a thing were to ever happen) may look like (and this is purely guesswork at this point), then have a look at this.   What's the main purpose of the religion, how does it see the world/reality, and what makes it stand out from the rest of the religions?   This is probably different for everyone. Honestly though, I think the answer to these questions is contained in the Japji Sahib, and I talk about these a lot in my own commentaries. I would highly recommend having a read through them, Japji Sahib is in a lot of ways the foundation for the rest of the text and you will be able to find answers to a lot of your questions when reading through those commentaries."
Sikh,39ed1f,ChardiKala,3,Thu Jun 11 05:36:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the in-depth answers! Really appreciate the effort put into it. It's amazing how Gurus can spend hours just explaining the Mool Mantar. I guess it's extremely hard for the human language to capture these grand ideas. I'll be taking time the next few days to understand the Mool Mantar more that its surface value.  Yesterday I was just scanning through the GGS and found a verse that resounded in me, it seems rather panentheistic :) I just wanna share this with you all:  Let the fear of God within your heart and mind be your spinning dance, and keep up, whether sitting or standing. To roll around in the dust is to know that the body is only ashes.  Oh, may I ask you just another 2 more questions:   How do you guys label/identify the verses... From what I observe there's something called the Raag? What is it exactly? Ik Onkar seems pretty similar to the concept of Brahman in Hinduism.

Says Kabeer, my anxiety and fear have been taken away; I see the Immaculate One pervading everywhere. ||4||3||  That is one Shabad (composition). This is one verse, you can tell by the headings.  Normally you can tell by the numbers, notice in this compositon that all the lines end in a single number, except for the final line, which has numbers 4 and 3.  This is part of the numbering system in Guru Granth Sahib that prevents people adding or removing anything. Any alterations will break the numbering system, so you can tell if anything has been changed.  The raag is the musical tone of the shabad. In classical Indian music there are musical melodies. The Gurus picked some melodies and used them to make compositions. Certain melodies represent certain emotions and moods. This helps to convey the message of the shabad. This shabad is in raag prabhati.  The heading of a shabad normally tells you the raag and the composer (mahalla 1 is Guru Nanak Dev Ji, mahalla 2 is Guru Angad Dev Ji).  You might want to take a look at the structure of Guru Granth Sahib."

Sikh,39c3kk,asdfioho,7,Wed Jun 10 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post, a lot of that needed to be said.  As I understand it, the main priority for us and the cause of much of the unrest today stems from the fact that Sikhs who were jailed in 1984 and who have now served their sentences are still not being released.  The Indian government is illegally detaining Sikhs, that's the primary concern for us, I think.   I think those who support the oppression of keeping these Singhs in jail look to exploit any ""Khalistan Movement"" as a distraction tactic.  They're able to avoid facing the issue of India illegally detaining Sikhs who have served their time by labelling many Sikhs as terrorists and separatists, when all we're after is justice.  I think those Sikhs being illegally detained in India are our priority so let us ourselves not get distracted by any talk of Khalistan but instead work together and focus on bringing them justice."

Not only did they beat around the bush as to why they were afraid, but also never made any effort to get to know my friends parents and build trust.

I guess it was supposed to explain why sleepovers were out of the question. Color me unimpressed.  Going to school with one boy who had a joorah, and the rage and fury that built inside me watching him get taunted and harassed by other boys.

Edit: as a mona, having to wait for my paghwalle friends to adjust their paghs for like 20 minutes before they were content enough to leave the house; using my kara as a knuckle duster in fights at school (I'm sorry!); being too conservative for most of the Punjabis I know but not devout enough for some; listening to girls tell me they're shocked that I'm Sikh as if they couldn't possibly imagine they might be attracted to a brown guy."

Having to deal with the same overused puns on reddit whenever a Sikh makes the front page  Being asked for pictures after non-Punjabi Desi parties with the one ""Sardar Ji"" there who does Bhangra as well  Accidentally making someone bleed when you high-five with your kara or knocking it on the desk while taking a test  Combing the hair can be a struggle sometimes  Bad turban days :("

I know why the belief system is criticized and I don't agree with it myself... But I remember my best friend in middle school was JW--a practicing one--and she was one of the few people who didn't change how she behaved around me when I was struggling with my sexuality and depression. I didn't know much about JW then but looking back, it makes me wonder why she stuck around.   And re: the Kara. My brother recently did that to me when we were horsing around! And I wear two so they're always noisy unless I push them up or wear long sleeves. :)"

Sikh,39bw97,WhyBrutus,8,Wed Jun 10 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"In the next few decades, I would like to see Sikhi emerge as a compelling framework that addresses the modern materialistic ailments of western society and at the same time, I would like to see it reach different populations across the world. The American Panth (especially the non-Punjabi Sikhs) have done a great job in preserving the Sant aspects of Sikhi and propagating it to a diverse population. Sikh philosophy provides a very interesting and unique view on the world with strong fundamentals, and the time for Sikh philosophy and scholarship is ripe.   Over the next 50 years, I would hope for a Takht to be set up in North America, guided by Panj Pyare. A UK Takht will be setup in the next 15 years. The Takhts will allow better organization to help parcharic efforts in the western world. We should be liberal in setting up Takhts to allow decentralized organization between Sikh panths in various parts of the world.   On a 100 year scale, I would also like to see Sikh parchar happening in North Africa and Middle East, at least Baghdad, where we will revive the historic Gurdwara and the rumored Arab Nanakpanthis.   We shouldn't even focus on Khalistan until 2100, but continue the ardas. Khalistan will be for our great grand kids."
Sikh,39bw97,DrunkenSikh,2,Wed Jun 10 20:48:09 2015 UTC,I generally agree with you whole heartedly. Just one question: Why is Khalistan needed? Can those needs be met without a nation state?
Sikh,39bw97,no_stone_unturned,3,Thu Jun 11 12:24:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know about ""highest aspiration"", but I would love to see more young adults in gurdwara leadership positions. I'm tired of the same old self-aggrandizing fatcats and corruption stories everywhere we go.  The gurdwara is such a powerful focus for social movements - our communities could be doing great things under the leadership of inspired, energetic gursikhs."
Sikh,39bw97,karan_kavan_abol,2,Thu Jun 11 01:26:53 2015 UTC,"Great post, I personally agree with all your thoughts. 1984 is relevant, for many of us the effects and wounds are fresh, and we should NEVER forget it; but I sometimes look at all the energy spent by our community on it and can't help but wonder how it could be if we invested a fraction of that elsewhere. It really seems as if our community as a whole can't motivate ourselves over anything other than something related to 1984. That's powerful, but it's a power we should use elsewhere.  For one, I really like what organization Khalsa Aid is doing; bringing the concept of seva and sarbat da bhalla to a global level taht wasn't feasible before.   I also am really into exploring Sikhi through a more intellectual lens, instead of via a broad ""religious"" philosophy, be it dharmic or modern religion. What does being Sikh mean in the modern era? How do we interpret metaphors used in GGS with new beliefs and ways of thinking? How can we modernize Rehit? Singh Sabha was a start, but there were political goals at hand at the time--I'm interested in continuing that inquiry.  EDIT: Some people view Sikh history as a golden age to go back to and emulate. My reading of Sikh history is really different; I see division in the community, general bigotry that failed the Gurus' teachings, an excess of materialism in the panth, and forgetting the teachings of GGS. However, the Sikhs back then as now were trying their best, and they certainly got some things right. I find a non-idealized Sikh history powerful for not only allowing us to tap into those ideals, but look at ways our community can improve and adapt to a more Guru-centric focus while still remaining relevant."
Sikh,39bw97,asdfioho,3,Wed Jun 10 19:49:59 2015 UTC,"IMO, Sikhi needs to focus on serving others. These large scale campaigns to distribute flyers on Sikhi and pay millions to get floats in the Rose Bowl parade are fine and well. But Sikhi isn’t about getting “credit” for what we do or who we are. I agree- Khalsa Aid has it right.   Every Gurdwara in North America should have a program to serve the poor/needy in their community. IMO  that should be the primary focus of the Gurdwara, along with naam simran."
Sikh,39bw97,noruh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:47:42 2015 UTC,"anything other than something related to 1984. That's powerful, but it's a power we should use elsewhere.   I strongly disagree. Where is the Sikhi in abandoning the pursuit of justice for anything else? It will diminish everything you do if you compromise the principles you do it for. And why do we keep treating is as a ""piece of the pie"" sort of situation? Our potential is virtually limitless so create another piece devoted to Rehit, Takhats, etc. instead of taking it from those who are on the front lines. This infighting just angers me, why do we keep trying to take from each other?  Our real problem isn't resources being 'wasted' on 1984, its lack of parchar and meaningful growth. '84 is just a scapegoat in your vision. What if we had proper parchar in the US? 3HO was a great success until they fell to ritualism, profits, and corruption. We need to build a new bridge for the average American. We've been throwing money at this issue for years now but so far all we've gained is marginal publicity.  Also, Khalsa Aid devotes significant resources towards the cause of '84 and families of Shaheed Singhs. Funding their education, healthcare, homes, etc. Its been their backbone from the start. They didn't set out to fix the world before trying to get their own house in order first."
Sikh,39bw97,Aj5abi,2,Thu Jun 11 10:57:31 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I should make myself clear  ""anything other than something related to 1984. That's powerful, but it's a power we should use elsewhere as well""  Often, many people treat 1984 as if it is the only problem inflicting the panth, and people are blinded to corruption elsewhere in Sikhi or the panth (e.g. Drug problem) in their anger for 1984, or worse, try to scapegoat every single issue Sikhs have in the modern day on 1984. ""Omg, why are some Sikhs questioning DG? Must be agents set up by the Indian government to undermine our community since 1984."" When people say you're a bad Sikh and disrespecting the Gurus for happening to attend a party that lined up on the same day as 1984 anniversary, when people can list off vague lists of 1984 shaheeds easier than they can our Gurus or basic history, when people state ""how can you deal with that problem in the panth when there's still 1984 to be dealt with,"" there's a level of obsession that's just not healthy for the community.   What Khalsa Aid and other organizations do is great; they actively commemorate 1984 and do vest many funds in helping victims. But it doesn't blind their eyes to other issues or other facets of Sikh panthic life."
Sikh,39bw97,asdfioho,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:13:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with you for the most part. Yes, people do lose sight of the objective and become disillusioned, disorganized, self-destructive even out of a lack of unity and leadership....but it is an obsession we need to have if are to get any closer to justice and healing.   You're right though, we've limited all of our ambition to '84 to the detriment of our growth."
Sikh,39bw97,Aj5abi,3,Thu Jun 11 13:52:53 2015 UTC,"I would like to see Sikhs take our natural place in society. We are duty bound to protect and serve the community, particularly the vulnerable and oppressed. We're supposed to promote selfless service and full equality. Here in the UK, the general public doesn't really know that, they're becoming aware, but the average Brit doesn't know much about Sikhs or Sikhi.  To reach that aim, I think we need to first educate ourselves and our youth on Sikhi. We need to know who we are and what we believe. We need to instil a spirit of charhdi kala in our community.  As mentioned in another post, Khalsa Aid has been fantastic in doing this. There is also a partner organisation, the West Midlands Sewa Society which provides langar to homeless people. We need to get ourselves engaged in sewa and then we need for Sikhi to gain recognition for teaching us about the value of sewa.  In 10 years time, I would like every person in this country to know what a Sikh is. When asked I want them to say: ""Sikhs are the guys who help feed the homeless, they've done lots of community work in my area, I know that if I'm ever in danger I can ask a Sikh to help me. They believe in equality and are peaceful people."""
Sikh,39bw97,Apollo_D,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"Aspirations are not built in thin air - they require a solid support structure that encourages baby steps to realize those very aspirations.  As a community, we don't have any aspirations left. We have failed the lofty ideals and institutions that the Gurus built and left for us. We are all collectively looking at each other, waiting for a proverbial ""knight in shining armor"" to come and rescue us from our own destructive selves. Our institutions are in shambles and we are divided amongst ourselves. We don't have a united voice or a majority opinion that any nation on earth will respect. Lacking a cohesive platform, we can't be expected to differentiate a sant from a sipahi - i am worried we may already be beyond the tipping point where our aspirations matter - even to us."
Sikh,39bw97,sikhhistory,2,Wed Jun 10 22:51:12 2015 UTC,"People don't seem to like this, but it's pretty true. We're not a society of lions, we're not even a society. The powerful bonds of being sikh have been diluted by the cultures we've immersed ourselves in. Little do we know, but we're becoming subservient to ideals that aren't very ideal and complacent with the world as well. We're meant to be warrior saints, I can't find a single one today. I admit that I fall short, and very much so, but it's because I didn't understand. I feel like I was brought up in a fake, pretend reality, the power of my peoples history has faded. Yet it is something that should remain and exist within every sikhs heart. In each sikhs heart, there should be love and adoration for our roots and our history and those who came before us. We're supposed to be fearless, not bound to conform to a false society.  If sikhs had the spirit of true sikhs, in due time there wouldn't be any corruption upon this whole earth."
Sikh,39bw97,pickledpie,2,Thu Jun 11 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"We're meant to be warrior saints,   At the risk of downvotes, I don't know how much I agree with this. The Guru Granth Sahib is our eternal Guru. It rarely talks about being a warrior saint. We are urged to follow the path of the Saints. We are constantly reminded to do Naam simran. Constantly told to control the Five Thieves and to enhance the Five Virtues. It tells us to wake up at Amrit vela, be kind, and seek out a sangat. I rarely see any talk about being warriors.   A warrior is a mere shadow or empty shell if she doesn't have a strong core. How can a mind starved of Naam guide a warrior at all? Do you consider Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur to be 'warriors'? They were the epitome of Har ke Sant. Guru Nanak was an intellectual rebel. Guru Gobind Singh was a social leader."
Sikh,39bw97,DrunkenSikh,3,Thu Jun 11 04:02:44 2015 UTC,"Do you consider Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur to be 'warriors'?   I was under the impression Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji did actually partake in battles (I think alongside Guru HarGobind Sahib), and also kept a 'royal' Darbar (could be wrong about this).   The Guru Granth Sahib is our eternal Guru.   This is true. But so is the Khalsa (Guru Granth-Guru Panth, Mind/Light of the Gurus-Body/Form of the Guru), and the Khalsa does have warrior-like qualities at its core. Not that I think warrior means physically fighting everyone who gets in your way, but at the same time doesn't the Khalsa have a mandate to protect itself and others if there is no other option?   A warrior is a mere shadow or empty shell if she doesn't have a strong core. How can a mind starved of Naam guide a warrior at all?   I agree with this a lot, which is why I think the Khalsa Panth came at the very end of Sikhi, after the spiritual message had already been gifted to the world by the Gurus. The Khalsa embodies the work of all 10 Gurus, and is a physical manifestation of Gurbani (hence ""Guru's Body""). I think we had a little conversation on this before, how Guru Gobind Singh Ji's Khalsa is the physical embodiment of Guru Nanak's ""Nirbhau Nirvair"", how there was conscious intent by the first Guru that his Sikhiya would eventually take on a unique form (in this case, the Khalsa), and I think we were on the same page for that."

Sikh,39bw97,DrunkenSikh,3,Fri Jun 12 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"Speaking from my own personal background, I was always raised with the ideal my father gave me of the ""warrior mystic"". I don't think it's literally about fighting, you can be a warrior in other ways without ever being violent. But rather it's about power, having inner power and strength and discipline. And sometimes that may translate into having to fight and that is okay, that is a part of it. But I don't think fighting is the whole picture.  My father teaches martial arts, and there are many things I can quote from him. One of them is ""when you know how to harm someone, how to truly tear them apart, that's when you can have real compassion"". You can, and you choose not to, and that is true compassion.  Maybe this is an entirely different concept from Sant Sipahi so others may disagree with it. This is just how I view it through my own cultural lens.  Hope everything came out clearly, this is one I've really internalized but it's difficult to put into words. By the way, not gonna down vote you, I'm glad you gave an opinion even if (especially if) it's not so popular."

There is a reason why it is called the ""Kirpan"", derived from ""Kirpa"" or mercy/compassion. In the Sidh Gosht, Guru Nanak talks about being mentally unattached, not physically removed from the world. Sikhi begins in the mind, which is why the mind is put front and center throughout Gurbani.    when you know how to harm someone, how to truly tear them apart, that's when you can have real compassion   He described the idea behind Kirpan!

Sikh,39bw97,DrunkenSikh,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:13:41 2015 UTC,"The institution of the khalsa created by our tenth guru, Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji, is one in which we are meant to be sant-sepahi. Khalsa is meant to be kaal purakh di fauj. People nowadays are very much about the piri, but have forgotten the miri. They are both important parts of the khalsa panth and sikh philosophy. The spiritual reality is encompassed by Sri Guru Granth Sahib, but we cannot ignore the temporal, which our our Granth is not concerning, but we have instructions from our other Guru's regarding it. What was the akaal takht? Just a symbol? The akaal takht was never meant to be destroyed our not ruled by sikhs. We are meant to have a real place for ourselves and we cannot ignore that. Dasam Granth is also part of our religion and is important to the khalsa panth."

Sikh,39bw97,pickledpie,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:25:00 2015 UTC,I must also say that we haven't lived up to the spiritual side as well either. But in a sense the temporal and spiritual rely upon eachother.
Sikh,39bw97,pickledpie,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:05:24 2015 UTC,"But in a sense the temporal and spiritual rely upon eachother.   I've been thinking, have we done a bad job of translating 'Sant Sipahi'? The literal translation of the two words is obviously 'Saint Soldier', but is that really what Guru Sahib meant when he coined the term? I agree with you that temporal and spiritual rely on each other, and Sikhi isn't about picking between the two. It's not like when we're in battle we're these hardcore ruthless soldiers, but when we go back to our normal lives we return to being harmless 'saints'.   It seems weird to me, because I think Sikhi is about balance. Balancing Naam Jaapo, Kirat Karo and Vand Chako, balancing Miri and Piri, and balancing Sant and Sipahi, not shunning any of them when it isn't convenient.  I think Saintly Soldier is a much better translations than simply Saint Soldier. It imply that the two qualities must be balanced and used in unison. We don't stop being Saints when we step on the battlefield (Bhai Kanhaiya, anyone?), but we don't stop being warriors/soldiers when we are living our normal lives (""Tyar Bar Tyar""- Guru Gobind Singh Ji's order for the Khalsa to be ever prepared for battle should the need arise)."
Sikh,39bw97,ChardiKala,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:49:28 2015 UTC,"Why not soldierly saint? I think we should just look at the overall idea of it, it's fine being translated as the warrior saint.

If you force them to marry someone of the opposite sex, it will life for the boy and girl bad. It destroys people's homes, you shouldn't lie about it.  Let them life and get on with it.

Sikh,39avhi,DrunkenSikh,3,Thu Jun 11 00:11:32 2015 UTC,"Nope. This betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of Sikhi. We cannot 'let it be' in the case of murderers because murder is a strong manifestation of one of the Panj Vikars. Of course, there can be an exception to murder, like in self defense. This is where you have to reason about how the murder in question fits in with the ideas of Five Thieves and Five Virtues.   If the murder is purely out of rage, lust, greed, etc. then it should be punished. Hukam contains both the Divine Ordinance and Free Will. As Sikhs, we have to preserve everyone's right to be able to align themselves with Hukam and this is done by minimizing the Five Thieves in ourselves and in society."

Guru Ji was pretty young at the time (probably around 12?), his father thought that Guru Nanak was old enough to start learning about how to make money.  So he gave Guru Ji some money (quite a large sum) and told him to go to the market and to make a profit.  On the way to the market, Guru Ji came across a group of homeless people and beggars. Guru Nanak Dev Ji decided to go to the market, buy food and give it to the people.  He didn't make any money that day and returned home. His father was pretty angry.

Sikh,39aetg,HerrKapKap,5,Wed Jun 10 12:12:29 2015 UTC,"Amritdharis are another name for Khalsa Sikhs, and there are two types of Nirankaris: one was a reform group within Sikhism and another is the group known as the Sant Nirankari Mission. For the purpose of your question, which I'm guessing relates to the tension that's been there since Gurbachan Singh fired on AKJ protestors, you can use the modern definitions in which an average ""Sikh"" is pretty much the Amritdhari you are referring to and in which a NIrankari solely refers to an adherent of the Sant Nirankari Mission and not the historic group.  Simply put, in Sikh (""Amritdhari"" for your purposes, again) theology, the Guru Granth Sahib is the final Guru for the Sikhs. We can't have another living Guru. The Nirankaris stated that in addition to the Sikh Gurus, there were additional living Gurus that were elevated to a high status of almost a deity (similar to how many Sikhs view the historic ten Gurus, ironically). The Sant Nirankaris also used Sikh texts like the GGS but edited them for their own use, and also used Sikh metaphors like the concept of the Amritdhari ""Panj Pyare"" translated to the Nirankari ""Seven Stars."" These were technically conversion techniques to attract Sikhs, which is why there was this ideological tension.  Sometime in the 80s, a group of Sikhs (Amritdharis) protested the Nirankaris at a rally. The personally armed bodyguards of Gurbachan Singh (the Nirankari Guru) fired on and killed all the Sikhs. There was no successive police report, and Sikhs saw this as the Indian government being injust with them and favoring the Nirankaris. Therefore, a group of Sikhs got together and shot and killed Gurbachan Singh (Nirankari Guru). Ever since, there's been this heightened tension. Violence has generally subsided, and Nirankaris have broken off more strongly from Sikhism to avoid this type of thing again.  I have my biases one way (I'm pro-Amritdhari) but I hope that was as object as I could be."
Sikh,39aetg,asdfioho,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:47:13 2015 UTC,Thank you. So Nirankaris are not considered as Sikhs? Do they not follow the 5K rules and have they broken off from traditional Sikh symbolism?
Sikh,39aetg,Singh_Q6,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:02:14 2015 UTC,"The amritdhari thing just means Khalsa Sikhs. All Amritdharis are Sikhs but not all Sikhs are amritdhari.  Amritdhari is someone who has taken amrit, also called Khande ki pahul (initiation by the double edged sword). These people join the Khalsa. The Khalsa was created by the 10th Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. The Khalsa is the group within Sikhi which aims to protect Sikh traditions and commit themselves to Sikhi. The Guru Granth Sahib is considered to be the mind of the Guru and the Khalsa are the body. Any Sikh can join the Khalsa, whenever they are ready for the comittment. It should be every Sikh's aim to eventually take amrit.  As part of the Khalsa, you have to commit to wearing the 5ks. This forms the uniform of a Khalsa Sikh.  Although it is not mandatory, some non-amritdhari Sikhs wear some of the 5ks. Pretty much all Sikhs wear the kara (the iron bangle) and some also keep their kesh (hair).  The Nirankaris can't be considered Sikhs because they don't follow the teachings of the Gurus.  The Guru Granth Sahib and the Khalsa are the only things with any authority in Sikhi. You can't have a living Guru.  They don't take amrit so they don't follow the 5ks."
Sikh,39aetg,NoobSingh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:05:11 2015 UTC,Gotcha. Thank you for explaining.
Sikh,39aetg,asdfioho,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:21:03 2015 UTC,"There a Nirankari movement before sant one reformed, do you know much about them? I know they helped rediscover anand karaj in the 1800s ish but that's about it so far"
Sikh,39aetg,NoobSingh,2,Wed Jun 10 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, they were on the same wavelength as Singh Sabha (removing Hindu influences on Sikhi) but did it more for teachings of Guru Nanak and GGS than that of Khalsa identity and community. Similar to Namdharis, they believed that the Sikh way of life had become too regal, too extravagant, too ceremonial, and thus they focused on cutting down on all that and focusing on spiritual teachings of GGS. ""Nirankar"" is used to refer to God in GGS."
Sikh,39aetg,asdfioho,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:49:58 2015 UTC,"Then the singh sabha movement came along and corrected a lot of things, right?"
Sikh,39aetg,NoobSingh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"Singh Sabha and Nirankari were contemporary and not in the same time. They had some overlapping goals and we're definitely helping each other, but slightly different movements. While Singh Sabha did so some stuff to ""modernize"" Sikhi (focus on GGS over DG, remove bigoted and archaic parts of Rehitname and pass a new Rehit Maryada), most of it was related to Sikh identity, separating it from Hinduism, and sort of redefining Sikhi into a modern religion by reasserting Khalsa. Singh Sabha wasn't necessarily concerned with concerns about materialism or regality among Sikhs the way Nirankaris specifically were. Groups like AKJ and Namdharis also arose at this time. It was a huge evolution in the Sikh panth.   You can see this in the respective names: Singh Sabha, or coalition of ""Singh's,"" Khalsa Sikhs, and Nirankaris, followers of formless god. Latter was more spiritual former more social."
