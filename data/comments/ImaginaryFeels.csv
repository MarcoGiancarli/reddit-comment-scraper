We were on the brink of extinction.   We are the true Druids.   The Night Elves exploit nature. They exploit life. They refuse to live in harmony with the world around them.   They live in an abomination erected by Staghelm!  I will not disrespect Elune... I know that she birthed Cenarius. I will not mourn a night elf.  Edit: Really? Trolls can be druids now!? ugh. Trolls are cruel and disharmonious people. They should not be druids. If any of the other Horde could be druids I'd maybe be okay with Orcs being druids. But I'm not sure. They're a bit... Barbaric in nature.  I certainly don't care for the undead either. They are vicious and untrustworthy. I kind of like the Blood Elf but they feel... equally cruel. Certainly they're more classy than the other Horde. But they're also equally cruel. Their willingness to take life from others and use it to their own means is rather cruel. Cruel and.. just... ugh. Calculating and vicious like a knife.   I like Tauren. I dislike The Alliance. But the traitorous Undead, cannibalistic Trolls, and the cruel Blood Elves are all... rather.. I don't know. Unfortunate allies.   The Orcs are cool though. Kind of Klingon. I like Klingons and Dwarf like people. Except for the foraging Dwarves on the Alliance side. They dig with no thought of responsibility and care.   God I miss WoW."

ImaginaryFeels,2yadvm,LibraryLass,9,Sat Mar 7 23:49:45 2015 UTC,I don't quite follow. Who is Petunia? Should I know her character from some source material?   I don't mean to be difficult. I quite like the character models and the art. I just have a hard time following what is happening I guess.
ImaginaryFeels,2yadvm,real-dreamer,8,Sun Mar 8 01:47:15 2015 UTC,"It is Petunia, Harry's aunt from the Harry Potter series. The bottom row is a depiction of how her life story might've looked like if she was born a witch as her sister while the top row is how it actually panned out.  Had to double check the note by the artist myself before I got it."
ImaginaryFeels,2yadvm,A_little_white_bird,3,Sun Mar 8 01:56:53 2015 UTC,Huh. I've never read the Harry Potter series.   My ex read the first book and half of the second to me.   Super sweet of her. Felt kinda cute and was a good way for us to end a night.   Since then I've felt interested only a few times. I liked the idea of it. I feel like the execution is hard to get into though. I usually really enjoy a lot of detail and complexity when it comes to stories and word choice. I like reading to be a bit of a challenge sometimes.   And I found the books to lack that. Maybe I'm wrong.   I assume you know a bit of the story yourself.   What do you think?
ImaginaryFeels,2yadvm,real-dreamer,3,Sun Mar 8 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"I as well as most people are pretty biased towards the series since we grew up with them so I think it's worth a read but just as the readers they were aimed for they are at start pretty childish and matures later on in the series. They are no literary masterpieces but they are very enjoyable for what they are.   You will most likely not challenge yourself and the story doesn't get that complex either but the atmosphere and universe she built, however inconsistent and odd when scrutinized is still very fun and it's one of those worlds you want to read more about since there are so many possibilities.  I'd suggest if you want to read them to do it as you did before with someone reading it to you or just reading a few chapters before you go to sleep. No need to plow through the entire thing since reading it on and off works just fine. Just my opinion though so may not to you."
ImaginaryFeels,2yadvm,A_little_white_bird,2,Sun Mar 8 03:24:31 2015 UTC,"First time I heard of them I think I was in 8th grade maybe?   The philosophers stone if I remember right. Maybe the second book came out when I was in late junior high.   Oh! Here, 98 was the release date in the US. I was born 86. So, the first book came out when I was 12.   Huh. I wish I read them when I was 12 now.   I remember all the movies coming out. It was a big deal when I was younger.   Oh well, at least I had fun with video games and movies when I was a kid.  I appreciate the input, I'll maybe do a bit of audio book format."

He told himself that he would not succumb the way his shipmates had; he knew he would struggle. But the creatures, if they could even be called that, somehow seemed to know him, and when his turn came and the singing of the cosmos reached a crescendo in his ears, his mind emptied of all but the desire to join them in the void. Gazing into the creature’s face, he mused on how tender, how gentle its embrace seemed, and even as his oxygen supply dwindled he did not resist.    Artist's description"
