unlimitedbreadsticks,3bgfu3,Berused,12,Mon Jun 29 02:14:20 2015 UTC,Your body naturally produces MSG. She may just swell up because of the amount of sodium that is contained in the MSG and otherwise.  No one should go without the sticks.
unlimitedbreadsticks,3bgfu3,raznog,3,Mon Jun 29 18:06:48 2015 UTC,Somewhat true. Your body produces glutamic acid but not mono sodium glutamate. Though either way it won’t hurt you any more than salt would.
unlimitedbreadsticks,3bgfu3,Berused,2,Tue Jul 7 12:15:53 2015 UTC,http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2014/august/is-msg-bad-for-you-debunking-a-long-running-food-myth-video.html
unlimitedbreadsticks,3bgfu3,raznog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:15:50 2015 UTC,Certainly not saying it’s bad. Just that our body doesn’t create it bound with sodium.
unlimitedbreadsticks,3bgfu3,Berused,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"Well, seeing how the sodium ionizes in any aqueous solution, the anion glutamic acid is formed, which is what our bodies synthesize.  But, very true; it isn't detrimental to anyones health unless they have a preexisting condition that makes it so."
unlimitedbreadsticks,3bgfu3,raznog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:54:21 2015 UTC,And then as stated only if you consume large amounts one an empty stomach. having cooked with it that isn’t really feasible. You actually need less than you would salt.

unlimitedbreadsticks,3bgfu3,I_Love_quesadillas,3,Mon Jun 29 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"Has she ever asked for the breadsticks without butter? I do this because I'm vegan. They go great dipped in the marinara sauce or minestrone soup instead. They take a little while longer to come to the table, but they're always made fresh and piping hot!"
unlimitedbreadsticks,3bgfu3,WitchDoctrix,2,Mon Jun 29 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"If glutamate is a problem, the breadsticks even without the topping are out of bounds.  The marinara is also not an option, no minestrone either, no croutons,  no alfredo sauce, no creamy salad dressings, and most of the pasta needs to be avoided.  Anything that contains wheat will cause a problem.  This requires avoiding everything from beer to communion wafers.  (Really - The Catholic Diocese of Columbus [Ohio, USA] has said that wheat free communion wafers do not meet Vatican standards. As Jesus ate wheat bread with his apostles before his crucifixion, communion wafers must be made with wheat.)  Just about anything more complex than white rice, with brewed soy sauce, from an Asian restaurant contains MSG. This is MSG added to the sauces when they are manufactured. Ordering Chinese food 'without MSG,' does not make a real difference in the actual glutamate in the food.  Celiac is real - I am not dismissing people who claim to have MSG or gluten sensitivities.  But gluten free pasta cooked in the same water that was previously used to prepare a batch of pasta containing gluten, would have gained so little gluten, that it could still be legally labeled as gluten free."

Wow.  This has taken stupidity to a level that we mortals simply cannot comprehend. It is a whole new class of dumb that we- well, that we're just not equipped for. They'll be writing about this in school textbooks for ages to come. Maybe someday, some scholar in acrobatic logic, perhaps a savant of twisted reasoning, will finally explain how this makes any kind of goddamn sense; and in so doing, they will revolutionize the human perspective.  Does objective reality truly exist?  Is empirical observation merely a practice in collective deceit, thus forming a cognitive construct that is agreed upon as reality?  If reality is a construct, is the same not true of society, law, desire, morality, and religion?  Is there a god, and does the answer to that even matter if nobody can agree on which one it is?

unlimitedbreadsticks,2k69fu,mikeofhyrule,1 point,Sat Oct 25 00:22:10 2014 UTC,whats insulting is you say you love the breadsticks and this is like 6 weeks old
unlimitedbreadsticks,2k69fu,octavello,1 point,Fri Oct 24 14:01:36 2014 UTC,"I agree with the report on a few things.   The alcohol is incredibly overpriced and boring.  I have no problem with giving me fewer breadsticks as long as they can keep them coming.  The wait staff do sometimes leave a bit to be desired.  But outsourcing the soup bases just seems cheap.  And for God's sake, the breadsticks are not hotdog buns!"

unlimitedbreadsticks,2j738s,tembaarmswide,2,Tue Oct 14 20:14:46 2014 UTC,"Theyvare limited (usually) to 3 table sections. If you've ever been a server, you know that is ridiculous."
unlimitedbreadsticks,2j738s,tembaarmswide,2,Wed Oct 15 02:56:14 2014 UTC,"For example, at my new job, I have taken up to 12 table sections. 3 table sections is pretty bad, but necessary there because of the unlimited refills. With an average lunch check coming in at about 20 bucks, the servers there make about 10 bucks an hour.   But, because of the ebb and flow of restaurant buisiness, the average lunch server is there for about 2 to 3 hours before they are sent home/on break. Lunch closers will be there for 5 hours, and usually have the oppurtunity to take extra tables. These are usually the most experienced servers, and they can do alright. At the og I worked at there would only be about 4 lunch closers, and the servers that worked them had those shifts on lockdown.   I'm not aaying it's a horrible job, and the servers that work there have every oppurtunity to find new work outaide of the place if they're unhappy, but I have found that it is one of the most demanding restaurant  work there is. And this is coming from someone who worked there for 6 years and now works in a privately owned restaurant where I am a host/server/bartender/busser/dishwasher all at once. My sections are bigger and I have quadrupled my income though, so no complaints from me."

unlimitedbreadsticks,2gxa7n,TomCollinsEsq,4,Sat Sep 20 20:24:34 2014 UTC,"You can hit a button to call a server (a small light starts blinking on the top of the device). Little better than trying to make eye contact or waving a flag that says ""breadsticks plz.""  I've found the best way to get lots of breadsticks is to 1) be nice! 2) let your server know you really like breadsticks (make sure to ask for them explicitly when you're out) and 3) make it easy to see your bread basket is empty. The way they fold the napkin, sometimes it's hard to see inside."

unlimitedbreadsticks,29j2cc,SirWaldenIII,11,Tue Jul 1 02:28:46 2014 UTC,"IMO the phrase 'unlimited breadsticks' implies that you can have as many as you want: you should have at LEAST two full baskets of breadsticks on the table at one point of time to really test the meaning of 'unlimited breadsticks'. Then, after your success with two baskets at one time you should increase your request to three, four, and on. If they refuse to supply you with said amount of baskets of breadsticks you should leave the restaurant, head to the local courthouse, and file a lawsuit for false advertising. And don't forget to bring the basket of breadsticks on the table with you to the courthouse, as filing a lawsuit is a daunting and complicated task that will leave you hungry."

This is equivalent to the problem of deciding, given a program and an input, whether the program will eventually halt when run with that input, or will run forever.  Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist. A key part of the proof was a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which became known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines. It is one of the first examples of a decision problem.  Jack Copeland (2004) attributes the term halting problem to Martin Davis.

They charged me full price [$13.99] on the Italiano Burger, even though the Olive Garden website states that it is included in the Pronto Lunch special [but prices may vary in NYC]. In the menu that server gave me, Italiano Burger was not featured in the Pronto Lunch special. I ordered it to be medium, but the results were more like medium-rare, the patty tasted pretty bland on the inside and way oversalted on the outside [it was either the patty or the bacon, I couldn't tell]. There was also no ketchup to the french fries that were sided with the burger, which I found to be very odd, and had to dip them into cheese sauce that came with the wings. The Spicy Calabrian wings [4x drums and 4x mid-n'-tip sections] were 15-20 minutes overdone and thus were very dry and not juicy: I even had to spit them out 3-4 times because they were unbearable to chew on. 2 wing sections were also nut plucked all the way. Raspberry lemonade was okay, but I could probably used more of it since the wings were pretty spicy. Total with tax was $31.54"

unlimitedbreadsticks,22egwt,PocoDoco,24,Tue Apr 8 00:14:27 2014 UTC,It's relatively minimalist.
unlimitedbreadsticks,22egwt,hotweels258,6,Tue Apr 8 01:26:42 2014 UTC,It seems to have picked up the flat design that's trendy.

Perhaps it's the ""ultra-conservative but homey"" font they've switched over to on the lettering, or the overly-liberal placement of the olive leaves practically butchering the bourgeois grey border. The lame substitution of the words ""Italian Restaurant"" to ""Italian Kitchen"" on the bottom is such an obvious attempt in representing the chain as ""trendy AND accessible"", that it basically screams typical to the third degree. Way to go OG, you really shit the bed on this one. If it wasn't for your Unlimited Breadsticks, we'd be done right about now."

No. You can take as many home as you have on the table, which is only allowed to be the amount of people at the table +1 at any given time. You shouldn't drop another bread basket automatically once the bread is gone. That is the official policy for bread baskets at OG. If your server is nice, they may throw you a few fresh bread sticks to you on the way out if you are taking home food, but usually they won't, unless they think you'll tip more.

Fun fact: The energy generated by two resting breadsticks (each weighing 1.3 oz) annihilating for more virtual breadsticks is equivalent to 1.79e14 joules of energy. This is over 10 times the yield in the Fat man atomic bomb, or roughly the amount of energy released by a hurricane in 2 seconds! (DON'T FUCK WITH OLIVE GARDEN). Also, experimental technology is being developed using black holes' natural hawking radiation to do the work for them, so that nobody must scoop up stinky post-breadsticks anymore. The more you know...  EDIT: Here's a handy diagram!  It is a trade secret as to how Olive Garden stores their antibreadsticks. That's why no one else has UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF DELICIOUS BREADSTICKS!"

unlimitedbreadsticks,1y14e2,Shackapples,7,Sun Feb 16 03:36:48 2014 UTC,"Here's my idea for a Darden property that could potentially pull their corporate earnings and stock out of the doldrums. Darden ought to create a bread-focused concept--for lack of a better idea at half past eleven on a Saturday evening, let's call it Levain (though that might be a tad high-falutin' for 'Murkin tastes). Anyway, I see it marketing and appealing to the above-25 crowd in hip, urban settings like Portland, Austin or Denver. Basically, you go in and you get unlimited breads of varying different types for one low price--the garlicy, buttery breadsticks we know and love from OG, slices of authentic rustic French boules, Mexican bolillos with a tangy queso, etc. The moneymaker is the alcohol; offer good wine and local craft beers and recoup your margin there. Additional revenue comes from add-ons to the bread, like cheese plates and sausage flights, for instance. Give it a relaxed, pub-like atmosphere conducive to conversations with good friends and all of a sudden, you've got a relatively (for the restaurant industry, at least) high-margin enterprise that could command a serious following and generate a ton of revenue.   Think Chipotle, but with unlimited breadsticks at its core.  Clarence Otis, Jr., are you listening?"

unlimitedbreadsticks,1xokck,Sample_Name,5,Wed Feb 12 04:41:41 2014 UTC,"Short answer is NO. Longer answer is that we take Call Ahead seating. Basically you can call around 4pm and ask to put your name on the list for later on that evening. It's in no way a definite time to sit down but it generally will cut down on the wait time. If the host on the phone says the wait is an hour and you show up an hour past that, keep in mind you'll still have to wait. We won't keep tables un-sat because people aren't there. If we did that, we'd have about a quarter of the tables empty on busy nights.   Disclaimer: It's freaking Valentine's Day on a Friday night. I've seen the restaurant lock the doors at 11pm (when we close) and STILL BE ON A WAIT. However, this was a few years ago when we were much busier than we are now. If you want a nice night with the gf, I'd suggest you A) Stay in for the night and order pizza or chinese OR B)Just get to-go OG food and, again, stay in. Promise to take her out another night. You'll get much better service and food quality. Servers won't be stressed, kitchen staff won't be swamped and you won't feel like you're being rushed. If you do decide to come to OG on Friday, keep in mind it most likely will not be the best experience possible. I'm not saying servers, hosts, chefs are unqualified, but it's just a crazy night for ALL restaurants. Other, slower, nights will provide a more fulfilling OG dining adventure.  :-)"
unlimitedbreadsticks,1xokck,Dar_Winning,3,Thu Feb 13 02:20:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. It was very informative and helpful.   I'll try my luck with calling ahead. We both love OG and understand that it may not be normal quality service since it's Valentine's Day/Friday. We've had great experiences with them in the past, so it wont' bother us too much.   If we get there and the line is too long, we may just have to settle for pizza and a movie at home and try again some other night."

One guy at the end of the table kept saying to keep the breadsticks coming, I thought he was sharing but oh no, that man was eating a basket himself every time I came out there, I eventually started watching him and I witnessed him consume roughly 21 breadsticks give or take 2 baskets since I didn't see him eat them initially. tl;dr - dude ate 21 breadsticks in one sitting."
unlimitedbreadsticks,1tdj7e,iamactuallyalion,7,Sat Dec 21 05:50:43 2013 UTC,"According to OG's nutrition info bread sticks are 140 calories each. At 21 breadsticks that yields 2,940 calories. He also consumed about 7,770mg of sodium solely from those breadsticks.  Fuck me I'm jealous."

How often to people even use unlimited pastas and soups to their advantage?"
unlimitedbreadsticks,1tdj7e,Matt081,2,Sat Dec 21 07:45:20 2013 UTC,Well the soup is always unlimited if you purchase an entree or if you get the soup and salad meal. Most people eat about 2-3 salads and 1-2 bowls of soup. The unlimited pasta bowl was a limited time event they do at least once a year and most people get one bowl and then order a second which they typically need a to-go box for. Honestly even if you eat one bowl the NEPB (never ending pasta bowls) is totally worth it since it costs $9.99 for unlimited and the regular spaghetti with meat sauce is still $10.79 for the dinner portion.

Groups that would send one person early to reserve a table while the rest fought after church traffic. Church goers were my least favorite people to wait on.  tl/dr yes some people get drunk.

They are only second to the white trash families. Group of 16... Here's $3. Well fuck you, too. We had a gay server in our restaurant, and they straight up stiffed him every time they came in. They knew he'd be working (he always worked Sundays) and still came in and acted that way, every single week. They'd just leave him church tracts. He was an excellent server, just gay.

unlimitedbreadsticks,1n9021,brian890,7,Fri Sep 27 16:57:53 2013 UTC,Indeed.
unlimitedbreadsticks,1n9021,marcofurbo,8,Fri Sep 27 17:02:32 2013 UTC,"First off, thanks for doing this.  What do you do when people try to share a single order of soup, salad, breadsticks? Would you ever just let it slide or would you make sure and charge the freeloader? Does OG have kitchen cameras to monitor that no sharing takes place?"
unlimitedbreadsticks,1n9021,virginiaraine,7,Fri Sep 27 17:07:10 2013 UTC,"You're welcome :) and first off, I'd tell my manager and I'd just do what they say, so if the guest complains they'd already know. What would probably end up happening is we'd charge them. And no we don't! At least mine doesn't. But we don't do anything bad, so they're not necessary."
unlimitedbreadsticks,1n9021,virginiaraine,3,Fri Sep 27 17:09:36 2013 UTC,Oh. Yeah I got charged once in college and I'm still kinda pissed about it. I came late and wasn't going to order anything but ended up eating a single breadstick.
unlimitedbreadsticks,1n9021,FigGnuton,6,Fri Sep 27 16:46:24 2013 UTC,"You're not supposed to share it. Our soup & salad deal is a per person deal. Just like our Never Ending Pasta Bowl, it's a 1 per person deal. If a child and a parent were sharing it, we'd probably let it slide, but if 2 grown people were sharing it then they're just free loaders. Plus, it's only less than 10 bucks and the bread sticks are unlimited."
unlimitedbreadsticks,1n9021,FigGnuton,2,Fri Sep 27 16:55:25 2013 UTC,"At our location, what we usually do is if a couple orders an entree to split between them, that entree comes with 1 bowl of salad.  If they order refills, we will charge them for an Add Salad.  Of course, I inform my table of this as they are placing their order, so there are no surprises.  However, 2 people cannot share a single order of SSS (soup, salad, sticks).  But 1 person can order an entree, eat their salad, and the second person can eat nothing but breadsticks!  But there must be at least one appetizer or entree at the table to warrant breadsticks."

I also like to dip them in our Parmesan Peppercorn Ranch dip (that comes with the calamari).

unlimitedbreadsticks,1m6l3l,ITACOS,17,Thu Sep 12 23:24:56 2013 UTC,"I am by no means an expert, having only eaten at the Olive Garden a handful of times, but in my experience they have measures in place to protect the supply of breadsticks and this wheat that is consumed in the United States.  As /u/ferlessleedr mentioned, you do not order the breadsticks themselves. You tell your waiter or waitress you would like the Never Ending Pasta Bowl, a lunch combination or another menu variation that includes unlimited breadsticks.  This underpaid restaurant employee will then go to the back of the restaurant, punch your order into the computer using colorful buttons and then proceed to browse Facebook on their mobile phone for at least five minutes. They will then remember to bring you your breadsticks, and procure a basket of four breadsticks from the kitchen and bring them to your table.  At this point, you will be hungry and eat all of them within a few minutes. Your server will now be in the back of the restaurant, texting their boy or girlfriend about how ugly you are or poorly dressed your dinner date is. They will come to your table, bring you your drinks and take the empty breadstick basket back to the kitchen and spend at least another five minutes insulting you behind your back to their friends.  They will come back to your table, with your soup or salad and the same basket of breadsticks. Except this time, there will be only three of them.  By the time you have received your entree, you will be getting the occasional basket of two breadsticks; three if you are lucky.  No need to fear for the wheat supply, but the servers are trained to ration the unlimited breadsticks in such a way that they will never run out while maintaing the illusion of an unlimited supply chain.  The occasional patron will test the limits of this system, but the servers are trained to slow down the breadstick supply line to such a level that they will fill themselves with drink refills before the wheat silos are threatened."

Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”  16 Jesus replied, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”  17 “We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.  18 “Bring them here to me,” he said. 19 And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 20 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 21 The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.

You make about the same if not a bit more than say chilis or applebees but your limited to 3 tables and you have to split parties so you make less in gratuity than in regular tables. At PF Changs I made a killing, easy money, about a bill a night easy and I was a national trainer so I got minimum wage half the time so I actually got a check. Most servers don't get a check per se just a check that says void since it all goes to taxes from your tips. So I made out about the same as when I worked graveyard at IHOP. Actually sometimes at IHOP I made out better since drunks tip awesome sometimes."

Plus at the time there was no way to get out of paying at least 50 dollars a table really. So you could expect decent money. OG on the other hand with their fucking soup and salad (which by the way is a hundred times more work than a regular plate due to the endless refills off your drink, salad, soup, AND bread sticks) you could easily have anywhere from a 5 to 7 dollar check meaning your lucky to get 2 bucks a table. Ps plenty of customers gaming the system too. Using coupons fine, but ordering the lasagna from the kids menu...for shame. (It's the exact same portion as the adult lunch item) then share everyone else's salad and breadsticks? Easy 5 dollar lunch...."

I myself am particularly fond of what Edward Abbey once said- “The best thing about graduating from the university was that I finally had time to sit on a log and read a good book.” I read that long before college and really took it to heart. I read a lot of books in college. I also traveled a ton. I remember trying to type out a paper on some shitty internet service in Bogota last year, that lowered my GPA a bit. Definitely failed an online statistics exam sitting on a balcony overlooking the Hagia Sofia in Turkey. Lost so many attendance points a few years ago because I took the week off and went to Dublin for St Patty's day. This Spring I was late on a few assignments because I was busy hiking a volcano in Guatemala and surfing in El Salvador. Missed some key classes in December to fly to Puerto Rico and lay on the beach. I remember a few years back submitting an assignment that was only partially finished because I had a plane to catch for Costa Rica. I ditched class to read too, a lot. Also on nice days I would take my old beat up Jeep on long drives in the country, that killed my attendance points. So no, not fuck school. But I personally chose to spend a little less time learning in the classroom and a little more learning outside the classroom. Also, I just did an entire semester class over last weekend. Three all nighters to knock it out. I also got an A. So I certainly know what cramming for a class entails. But that being said, I also work two jobs, so no, me going to class to get your 98% would probably not be worth it for me, since I would be having to give up work and lose a lot of money."

unlimitedbreadsticks,1ikidm,oswald433,12,Thu Jul 18 17:01:03 2013 UTC,"With l'hopital's rule, this is technically equal to the derivative of unlimited breadsticks divided by the derivative of 0.   Now if we let infinity (the amount of breadsticks) be represented by the letter x, we can write the expression as:  lim x->infinity x/0  0 is usually considered as an extremely small number, and an extremely large number divided be an extremely small number is a very, very large number.  The derivative of x is 1. So the answer is 1/0. And due to the reasoning above, the answer is infinity.   Unlimited breadsticks are forever unlimited.  I have no idea if that's right, but the answer looks delicious.  Edit: Unscientific's response is more scientifically accurate (I love irony). (Real answer quoted below, courtesy of Unscientific. Upvotes to him/her!)   You're almost right. L'Hopital's rule doesn't work here because the limit goes to ∞/0, and L'Hopital's rule needs it to be in ∞/∞ or 0/0. Also, 1/0 does not equal infinity; it is undefined. That said, let x represent breadsticks, and since breadsticks exist, we know that x>0. Let f(x) be a function of breadsticks available at Olive Garden when any number of breadsticks is divided by zero. If we take the limit of f(x)=x/0 when x goes to infinity, we get something like ∞/0, so the limit does not exist. If the limit of f(x) does not exist, then we can conclude that there is no limit to breadsticks available at Olive Garden. In other words, unlimited breadsticks!"

And remember that OG=/=[breadstick].  The absolute value of breadstick can only be determined by reversing the 4th doughmensional properties via subtracdditiomultiplision in varying degrees, thereby equalizing the sublimity of delicious fractal bread paradigms.  So, in a word, the limit of OG is non-existent, since true OGs stay true to da game, and they won't stop, cuz they can't stop, they stay on da grind 24/7 chasin dat paper, mayn.  Because OG's have a predilection for keeping it extremely real, they make em say UHHHH, cuz there's really No Limit."

In the last week you've:   removed circlejerking comments elsewhere but this thread (and others) is full of them never used [meta] tags appropriately. How am I meant to know quickly if this is a mod mandated meta post   This is lackluster moderation guys. You should seriously consider stepping aside and let better moderators run this subreddt, who will answer to community concerns more effecitevly (which seems to be a long standing issue here)"
unlimitedbreadsticks,1d5ss8,JF_Queeny,36,Fri Apr 26 17:48:33 2013 UTC,"I would like you to understand what's going on here. I'm not some young kid drunk on power as a moderator who is flying off the handle. I'm 54 years old and i've been moderating forums since the early 1980's. I have seen it all before. Our subreddit gets a lot of shit, and yes, there are a lot of young, inexperienced, culinarily maladapted kids who post in /r/unlimitedbreadsticks. It's our mission to help them, and divert them away from forced Bertucci's, terrible service and prices, and such, to help them adopt more healthy eating habits (about unlimited breadsticks specifically). But we can't do that when outside subreddits are intentionally making a hostile environment, where people can't discuss their unlimited breadsticks, soups and salads openly or honestly. The post that got attacked by your users was a young kid, trying to find his way in the /r/unlimitedbreadsticks  world, and honestly admitting he screwed up. His message was an example for others, to help them avoid similar screwups. These attacks from your subreddit singled him out, which has a chilling effect on other users who now see how hostile the environment can be when someone speaks openly about their unlimited breadsticks."

unlimitedbreadsticks,1d5ss8,w46u,13,Fri Apr 26 18:09:58 2013 UTC,"While I rarely post now, and was never a big contributor to begin with, I am a 'moderator' of r/unlimitedbreadsticks (I'm sure I accepted a mod invite a nanosecond before someone else would have) and have control of some of the moderators, and things of that nature.  It is therefore my privilege to 'moderate' this sub-reddit (insofar as that means anything), and I intend to keep it totally free and open, and lacking in any kind of classic moderation. As you can imagine, there has been tremendous pressure to restrict the content that can be posted here, and restrict the people who can post here; to the extent that I don't even read my inbox anymore.  Some cool changes have been made to the sub - none by me. I wish I knew exactly who to give the credit to, but there are also some I may not necessarily agree with (and I won't jump the gun right now, I'll do some research). What I want to put across is that my intent is to keep this sub free and open. If at any point it is no longer that, let it be known and I will act.  We have something really special here - and it's so, so very easy for it to get fucked up. The tiniest of changes could irreparably damage what this sub is meant to be. Again: free and open. Many of us know just how important those virtues are.  r/unlimitedbreadsticks has been made to be the black sheep of reddit. Heck, the black sheep of the internet. People are doing a good job with that. But so long as I have my account here, we will sacrifice no freedoms. I am confident that if any are given away, they'll never be given back.  I've said far too much - I'm tired. I'm trying to convey a very simple point. Goodnight!"

unlimitedbreadsticks,1d3bc0,PoorlyTimedPhraseGuy,11,Wed May 1 10:13:08 2013 UTC,"So I accepted a random moderator invite from a seemingly inconspicuous subreddit entitled ""/r/SweedenHomeBrewing.""  Now I thought, okay, this is interesting and I wondering why I was invited to moderate such a place.  I made a horrible mistake and accepted the mod invite.  I left as a moderator and have still been getting spammed with nonstop private messages 24/7 and it is frustrating me since I use my PM box and also moderate some large sugbreddits (William Shatner was right about this problem with reddit inbox spam in his /r/ideasfortheadmins post a while back if you can remember it.  This was a while back so I'm not sure everyone saw it).  I'm not saying that I'm as famous as William Shatner or anything, but come on folks.  I probably am getting more orangereds than that guy gets in a week at the moment.  Anyways, I just wanted to tell you all that every single one of the moderators that moderate this subreddit are participating in this inbox spam and thought you all needed to know.  The admins have been alerted of what is going on and I forgot to mention that I spoke to one lawyer and two law enforcement officers as well. ;)  Anyways, after browsing your subreddit for a little while.  I'm starting to wonder if guys are just as bad as them?  You really accept a fucking quote of the day being gaben saying ""420 flame the bundle?""  What is that shit anyways?  Is that his face on top of the ""10 guy"" meme?  Also, what the hell is that random red motherfucker that looks like a reptile doing in the sidebar too.  Btw, I've browsed some of these threads and your memes are pretty shitty and you have no idea how to use them correctly at all.  Maybe you should do some research on what a meme actually is before misusing the hell out of them, what do you think?  Maybe try browsing /r/AdviceAnimals (or for you Dolan freaks, there is always /r/Dolan) to brush up on how these memes are supposed to be used.  None of you, and I will say it again none of you, know how to correctly use a goddamn meme and it is funny watching the cancer of reddit struggle so hard to do so.  Anyways, I'm done here in this filthy place and I just wanted to say one last thing.  Why the fuck is the upvote button Ron Paul?  Ron Paul was a pretty shitty politician who I can only agree with in terms of his libertarian stances, but he's a religious nut that denies that evolution exists.  Why do you people obsess over him anyways?  Obama won, get the fuck over it you children.  I really want to end this but I just keep typing because these motherfuckers have gotten me so angry (I literally woke up to 50 orangereds if you can believe that shit).  Right now I'm getting like 10 a minute and the admins aren't doing a damn thing to stop it.  Your. Memes. Suck.  Your. Subreddit. Sucks.  Your. Mods. Suck.  Fuck, this subreddit really is the cancer of reddit.  EDIT: Wow, I just went to the sidebar to see ""Today's News"" to see how fucking stupid it would be and it links to goddamn /r/BlackKnightNews.  You and your mods are pathetic racists as well?  Great information to know, I'll be forwarding that to the admins as well.  Say goodbye to your little subreddit you fucks.  EDIT 2: Sorry I just had to ask this fucking question.  Why is this subreddit's reddit search button a Bing search or whatever?  You do realize that Google's search functionality is far superior to Bing's, right?  You and your mods need to shut this place down, nothing good has come from it, or ever will  BTW, thanks for banning me from this shithole, you did me a favor.  I was thinking about actually replying to a few of these poorly done memes, but then realized it was a waste of my precious time.  Keep using your shitty memes and Ron Paul happy face upvote things, I don't care to even engage in conversation with you people."

unlimitedbreadsticks,1d3bc0,reese_ridley,9,Wed May 1 16:42:51 2013 UTC,"Dear Grant, I wrote you but you still ain't calling  I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom  I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got em  There probably was a problem at the reddit servers or something  Sometimes I write the usernames too sloppy when I jot em  But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man, how's your daughter  My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father  If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her, I'mma name her Jennifer Lawrence  I read about your Uncle Gaben too, I'm sorry I had a friend not make a game over some bitch who didn't want him  I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan  I even got the underground shit that you did with Karmanaut  I got a room full of your posters and your cat pictures, man  I like the shit you did with Sagan too, that shit was phat  Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back  Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is ashole11  Dear Kijafa, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance  I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans  If you didn't wanna talk to me outside of /r/atheism  You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew  That's my little brother man, he's only six years old  We waited in the blistering cold in my room for you for four hours and you just didn't reply  That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fucking idol  He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do  I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to  Remember when we met in /r/Circlejerk  You said if I'd write you, you would write back  See, I'm just like you in a way  I never knew my indian rapist father neither  He used to always downvote my Mom and perwinkle her  I can relate to what you're saying in your posts  So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and read them  Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed  I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest  Sometimes I even ban myself to see how much it hurts me.  It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me See everything you post is real and I respect you cause you post it  My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7  But she don't know you like I know you Kijafa, no one does  She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up  You gotta message me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose  Sincerely yours, ashole11 P.S. we should be together too  Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-reply-to-My-Fans  This'll be the last pm I ever send your ass  It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?  I know you got my last two pms, I wrote the username on 'em perfect  So this is my letter I'm sending you, I hope you read it  I'm in the computer chair right now, I'm doing 1.2 Megabytes up/down on the server.  Hey Kifjafa, I drank a fifth of monster, you dare me to post  You know the song by Mackelmore  About that guy who went to the thrift shop.  But didn't, then Neil Degrasse Tyson saw it all, then at a a comic con he found him  That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from circlejerking  Now it's too late, I'm on /r/aww, I'm tired.  And all I wanted was a comment reply or a pm  I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures my autistic/athiest/gay wife drew off the wall  I love you Kijafa, we coulda upvoted each other, think about it  You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it  And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it  I hope your karma score eats at you and you can't breathe without me  Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the /r/cats now  Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?"
unlimitedbreadsticks,1d3bc0,GodOfAtheism,9,Wed May 1 18:39:26 2013 UTC,"I feel like I can't say ""brave"" anymore without people thinking it's just an ironic circlejerk, but seriously dude I just wanna sincerely say, that was incredibly brave. Please watch your back though because undoubtedly you are now a target for their trained harpy doxx squadrons. Make sure you remove any potential identifying information from your comment history, and don't link to any personal blogs or profiles. I've seen the real world damage these people can do to the lives of the innocent men they target and I would hate to see it happen to you after you have put yourself out there like this. And honestly? If it all goes wrong the law will side with them over you because you are a man. I'm just saying. Be safe bro. Look after yourself, this shit is not a game. There a serious real world implications. Michael Brutsch lost his job when all he was trying to do was help the admins eradicate cp on reddit. It shows what happens when you stand up for what you believe in on reddit. This is some first amendment shit. I'm pretty sure the founding fathers would fuck circlecabal up so hard if they knew what they were doing to the fight for equality in this country. Anyway, I've gone on too long. Just wanted to thank you for continuing to show courage in your conduct on reddit. It really does make a difference. Peace."
