BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,jack-iv,But only two minutes of yours
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,akimbocorndogs,9 months and 2 minutes of yours
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,MeatwadSaint,2 minutes?  Try 10 months and 27 hours for mine.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,EzFriend,Yours must've been a little overripe
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,bergdorf_bandit,No they lie. Gestation is actually 10 months. 40 weeks. It sucks.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,mrsjksnowwis,Except most months aren't 28 days
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,ObviouslyIntoxicated,"Yes, 40 weeks ends up being about 9 months and 6 days on average."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,trucker_dan,"So I got pregnant about the first week of July last year, and had my baby the second week of April this year."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,mrsjksnowwis,Had to go and double check our dates. Our conception date was mid July and gave birth late April.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,ObviouslyIntoxicated,Haha. Yuup.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,mrsjksnowwis,"I fucking hate that misconception. Not only is 40 weeks right around 9 months and a week, the weeks start at the last day of your period. You don't ovulate/conceive until about 2 weeks after the last day of your period so for 2 out of those 40 weeks, you're not even pregnant."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,thisisrediculou,"Full term (40 weeks) is closer to 10 months, & he was 2 weeks past his due date."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,EzFriend,"9 months and a week. Plus it's counting from the last day of the period, so you're not pregnant for the first 2 weeks."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,thisisrediculou,That baby wasn't a baby for 9 months before it was born. It was a fetus
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,fuckdaseacocks,How does that matter. You still invested 9 months of your own time into the care of the baby.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,MeatwadSaint,Time plus possible physical therapy sessions and food poisoning like morning sickness.

BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,SunriseSurprise,"I admit, I didn't feel that overwhelming love everyone talks about when my daughter was born.  And that's totally fine.  It's a huge adjustment, bringing another life into the world.  Some women bond instantly, and some women don't.  My daughter is now 16 months old and she's definitely the best thing that ever happened to me."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,Drawtaru,"Most father's feel that way...I expected to feel overwhelming love for my son when he was born but instead it was just thoughts of ""who is this stranger coming into my life""...it took awhile for me to feel that fatherly love for him"
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,blh1003,I guess because you aren't experiencing the pregnancy first hand that there's less of a drive to bond.\n\nI've never really wanted kids specifically because I don't know if I'd love them or even like them. What if your kids a jerk? You just power through?
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,MalHeartsNutmeg,Most kids are jerks because of their upbringing....teach him/her right from wrong and good from bad and they should be ok...of course there are inherently jerky kids but it can be mitigated
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,blh1003,"Thank you for saying this. I had the same experience. I was just telling someone that I think it does other women a huge disservice to always talk about the immediate bond, because then you feel guilty if you don't have it."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,multiplemeags,"This is funny and all, but it's also pretty damn true. Two kids, one two years old and the other 3.5 months. It takes time to develop a bond. I love the hell out of my two year old. Just starting to like the 3.5 month old."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,_HEY_EARL_,"I feel like when/if I have a kid, I will feel the same way, glad I'm not alone.."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,lavalampdreams,Nah that's bullshit. It's immediate bond / love the moment they're born. Mother or father. \n\nIn fact . You're bonding with the baby for nine months prior to birth.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,k-uke,"I think it's different for chicks, they love to love things they don't understand"
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,RainXinyoureyes,We've also felt them grow and develop inside of us. We've known them since they were just a flutter in our belly.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,therapistiscrazy,"Truth. I was really worried I won't love my baby, especially when we found out it was a girl, not a boy. But as soon as I saw her I knew I did."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,mrsjksnowwis,Why would u be disappointed that you were going to have a girl? \n\nHealthy I hope
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,Oyemulata,"Gender disappointment is a real thing. When you're pregnant your hormones are all kinds of crazy. This that normally don't bother you are huge deals.  This was one of them. I've never been good at being a girl, or having female friends. Legit my best (and only female) friend was a boy for 3 years because Transgender stuff. In any case I didn't think I could be a mother to a girl the way I could with a boy."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,mrsjksnowwis,It's hormonal
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,wtf_kittycat,Uh the one who dnt understand n doesn't have the capacity is you. You'll never understand.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,Oyemulata,"Yep, totally true. I love my 3-year-old like crazy now, but when he was just a baby blob with very little personality I didn't love him. It took about 4-6 months for me to get to know him and start to love him. There was no love at first sight for me. I was shaking so bad after giving birth I couldn't hold him, and that was ok with me - all I wanted was a damn sandwich lol."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c84fl,cassiopeia1280,"Literally sitting here reading and holding my 8 day old baby girl. Love her like no other. Still laughed at that shit, a lot."

BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,Bromar_Gaddafi,Pyramids
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,MushroomMachine,Yeah...Newport's definitely aren't generic
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,TheLongLostBoners,"USAGold, Checkers, Maverick, etc. Newport are one of the more expensive brands"
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,Omariamariaaa,Can some one please explain the popularity of Newports to me?
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,he_eats_da_poo_poo,"I'm not an expert or anything but from my experience as a semi-regular smoker, Newports have a strong but smooth menthol taste. You can smoke them and not feel like vomiting as with the generic menthols such as L&M. Newports leave a relatively good taste in your mouth whereas the cheaper brands have a kinda gross, metallic flavor, at least to me. I can only stand smoking Marlboro, Parliament, and Newports. I'm sure many would disagree with me, but you get what you pay for with cigs and Newport regular menthols are one of the most expensive packs out there and provide a huge buzz that tastes pretty good, as they should at a premium price. I am also a fan of Newport reds which are cheaper, but inferior to the classic menthols.\n\nMy best guess as to their popularity is that many people simply cannot physically stand the cheaper brands so they stick to what they know is good and enjoyable and aren't willing to attempt getting used to the generics to save money."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,pfy5002,"Newports are so strong to me. The Red's especially. I bought them once because they were on sale, made me nauseous. Interestingly, I started smoking with Newport menthols, but my stomach hasn't been able to handle them for years."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,Omariamariaaa,me too thanks

BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,Cheeseologist,"Man I never would have started if they were that expensive, that's probably the reason they're high in some areas. Sucks for the people who are addicted though."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,Syuk_Dat_Deke,"Yup... To be fair, though, everything's expensive in Nova Scotia. Even Alexander Keith's costs more than it does in Ontario."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,Cheeseologist,I thought cigs were cheap where I lived until I went to Louisiana for a few months. I was getting packs of cigs for under $2.50 a few years ago! It blew my mind that you could get them so cheap!\n\nEdit: Holy shit. They must have increased the taxes greatly since then. They are over $5 a pack now.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,jld2k6,"Put it this way...compared to L&M's, Newport's are like  Loud and L&M's are Mexican brick trees"
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7pla,A_Shitty_guitarist,"Black people smoke newports, mostly the menthol. Probably was the cheap stuff back in the day, and people still bought them even when they got more expensive."

BlackPeopleTwitter,3c7jcd,eatdatshit34,"Yeah I have never preferred the dub for something. Dubs also have the knack of being dub down or censored, like Sanji in the dub has a lollipop! I also feel subs have a lot more heart, if that makes sense."

BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8159,moonsgravity,Who is she?
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8159,TheScamr,A good woman choses the silent treatment.  Less texts and phone calls to ignore while your at work or out with your boys.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8159,iLeo,"Thats a fucked up thing to say. This has nothing to do with being a ""good"" woman, it is clearly a situational type thing. \nSay the guy cheats and gets caught, right? You think she's gonna stay quiet and give him the silent treatment cause he's spending time with his boys? She has the right to blow his phone up asking for an explanation.\nHowever, if you're referring to a situation where they're with someone who trips over the smallest thing then yeah, but its still more like a good (or better yet, a decent) person would chose the silent treatment till they're able to talk face to face."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8159,Hi-archy,Why wouldn't the decent woman just talk about it lol..
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8159,iLeo,Did you not read all the way? I said till they can talk about it face to face.
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8159,Hi-archy,"Nigga you said "" silent treatment till they're able to talk face to face"". What I'm saying is a decent woman would skip the silent treatment part you degenerate. Try come at me with that back chat boy"
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8159,iLeo,"Degenerate, tf? It's not even about giving the silent treatment. It's about being mature enough to realize that arguing over text isnt gonna fix anything and you need to confront the person head on. So, if she's mad as hell and needs to talk but he's out at the moment or at work then what's she gonna do? Probably text him once or twice and (this might surprise you) stay silent till they can talk. I don't know about you but usually when someone's mad they don't continue talking about other things till their issue is resolved."

BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8wwh,Treyweatherman,"Man, Fox doesn't even have legs. Star Fox pilots remove their legs from the knee down to prevent blood from rushing into their extremities during high G maneuvers."
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8wwh,SC2_Bench,Is...is that true?
BlackPeopleTwitter,3c8wwh,Toothpick_junction,"If you look at art from the SNES days, they very clearly have robot legs. Real pilots wear a G suit that restricts bloodflow to their legs for the same reason.\n\nAs time goes on you see a shift further and further from this. Melee was probably the first rendition of Fox to have something that MIGHT be real legs (just in metal boots). In Star Fox adventures his boots are pretty different. All his future iterations make it unclear if he has robot legs or not but the SNES art makes it pretty undeniable. It is possible that they have since retconned that the pilots have normal legs."
