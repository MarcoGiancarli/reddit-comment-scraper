If the processing is happening on the device rather than a remote server they'll probably want as much power as they can get. This lets them decide just how much is available, and scale the software accordingly to perfectly match it.   Plus who ever knows what google's going to do at any given point.

How exactly do you jump from virtual SIM card to users getting screwed over?  SIM cards really have little to do with the locking/unlocking process of phones. Carriers already have the ability to lock down phones on contracts, and are legally obliged to unlock them if they are off contract. How does taking a physical SIM and turning it virtual change any of that?"
gadgets,3duclp,jelloisnotacrime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:41 2015 UTC,"Let's run down the ways:   Your phone has an e-SIM, but the means to change it is locked by the carrier and they refuse to divulge the code. Think arbitrarily locked bootloaders on AT&T and VZW phones. Carriers start demanding that handset makers provide them with carrier specific models. This already happens, for instance with the myriad variants of Moto and Samsung phones. This becomes, ""Oh, all phones are e-SIM now, but your phone from competitor X, Y, or Z isn't 'compatible' with our network."" Carriers will simply flat out refuse to activate phones that aren't theirs. Guess what! You can't put a physical SIM card in it yourself anymore. You're a slave to someone else programming the thing over the air, if they should deign to do so. (Hint: They won't.) Sprint and VZW immediately come up with their own similar but technically incompatible e-SIM standard, which is in fact e-SIM in name only and wall themselves off from the rest of the universe.   Etc., etc.  Face it, in the USA at least the carriers will fight any end-user freedom tooth and nail. These sorts of changes are never about us. They're about them, and finding new ways to lock in customers and prevent freedom and choice. Unlocking has been ""mandated"" now, and suddenly this crops up? The transition could have been made years ago but there was no incentive. Taking out your SIM yourself meant nothing if your phone was still carrier locked. Now they need a new lock in method, and by perverting this system somehow, this will be it. It's not about slimmer phones or sealed chassis or whatever. It is about control. Period."
gadgets,3duclp,zero_dgz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:08:41 2015 UTC,"You are speculating about things that are either illegal, or possible with physical SIM cards, but not done because they aren't logical.   In the US (and many other countries), carriers are legally obliged to unlock your phone for use on other networks if you are off contract and do not owe them any money. An eSIM will not change this (if you read the law, it considers any technical measure of that restricts phones from connecting to a network, not just whatever current method is being used). Bootloaders really have nothing to do with this, if you would like for the law to say that your bootloader has to be unlocked, that's a separate fight. Some manufacturers do make separate models, and some don't (and if anything, the recent trend is toward more universal multi-band phones). So you are completely speculating that eSIM will somehow make this worse. It sounds like carriers could do this now, if they wanted to. Any physical SIM is still dependent on being activated by the network. Carriers may push for more ways to lock in their own customers, but they would absolutely never refuse a customer who came knocking on their door, that's illogical. This is your only plausible point. But the article clearly says Apple, Samsung, and several international and national carriers are working together on this. It would make no economic sense for some carriers to break off of a standard that includes the world's two largest smartphone makers.   I'm not saying the eSIM will herald a period of free and open networks that we can switch to and from as we please. This is literally just taking a physical SIM and turning it into a virtual SIM, nothing else will change. The biggest impact this will have on your life is that you won't have to deal with SIM cards, and perhaps you will be able to sign up for a new service completely online (could be a big help in countries where you do not speak the language)."
gadgets,3duclp,jelloisnotacrime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"Up until it actually happens or more details are released, it's all speculation. Mine is just more pessimistic and, as applies to the USA phone market, probably also realistic.   I know bootloaders have nothing to do with SIM and e-SIM. My point was using them as an example of carriers pathologically locking users out of their own hardware for no reason other than lock-in. This totally explains why there are 40 variants of the Galaxy S5, 5 S6 variants (not counting the upcoming Plus and rumored mini), 6 Moto X 2nd Gen. variants, etc. Carriers demand this of handset makers. It is unlikely to change. The reason? Lock-in. If you already have a SIM on a network there is nothing stopping you from putting it in any compatible phone. The carrier cannot take this away from you; the SIM is in your physical possession. (They can disable the SIM's serial number on their network, and theoretically identify the phone you are using, however.) Carriers want to urge you to buy a new phone through them, and pay for it, and get locked into a contract. Not bring someone else's phone and come and go as you please. Verizon and Sprint already do this. The reason? Lock-in! It is fabulously unlikely to change, especially given that these two have maintained their outmoded CDMA architecture specifically to prevent the rest of the world from being compatible.   The main point of e-SIM is that you will no longer have direct physical control of your SIM data. Someone else will. It is fantastically unlikely that end users will be given full control of the SIM data and hardware in their phones as currently exists with physical SIM. (Unless, probably, if you buy a phone that is factory unlocked. Which will be an international phone, and not support the oddball frequencies required by US carriers.) You can change your SIM now at any time, and the worst you will need is a paperclip or something to poke the ejection slot if your phone uses nano-SIM. Once this capability is taken away, this functionality is left to the whims of cell phone carriers, who have a long and colorful history of doing absolutely anything and everything in their power to limit user choice and freedom.  Will the law step in and remedy some of this? Yes, eventually, and likely only partially. Will it involve several years of customer complaints, lawsuits, and courtroom wrangling? Undoubtedly. And who will lose in the end? The customers. Always. It is always the customers.  Have you ever tried to make a carrier perform their legally mandated duty to SIM unlock one of their own phones? It's like pulling teeth. The law states that an unlock mechanism must be in place, not that the carrier has to make it easy, realistic, or even possible for most consumers. All of the US carriers have additional restrictions in place beyond ""phone must be paid off, with no contract on it."""

It was the least of what was copied from the iPhone for the Samsung Galaxy S (The document shown here is an internal Samsung report where they pick at each iPhone aesthetic and detail how they intend to copy it and why.)

All of these things serviced the goal of simplifying conversion.  Pretty shitty behaviour for a supplier if you ask me.

Take TellTale Games, The Wolf Among us does not fit on 4:3 screen, if such a large publisher is not even bothering to get their games to display well, what chances are there for all the little devs to bother? The same issue exists for immersive mode, it has existed for two years now, most devs don't even know what it is. Leaving these things to the dev to implement obviously does not work and Google needs to take the appropriate steps to make sure they are no longer an issue on their OS. But seeing how slow Google is to implement propper change or address issues on it's OS the fact remains that 4:3 is a pitiful experience on Android, which is why the tablets using it, for now, are a bad idea."

You do not need to do any additional work, just correctly describe the layout in XML or programmatically, and it will work.  Games are totally different, since they do not rely on system laying out your described UI. Games render the UI themselves - system just gives them a space on the screen and says ""here, draw whatever the hell you want in this space"". And if game incorrectly renders, for example, with black bars, it's solely the developer's fault, not Google. With modern game engines different screen sizes are not an issue, really.  I personally have never encountered any game that had black bars while I was using Acer A811 - I do believe there are, it's just not that much of a problem, since it only affects games and only a small fraction of them."

gadgets,3dhpmt,Bearlociraptor,18,Thu Jul 16 11:09:50 2015 UTC,"Quite ingenious though, as a company you can provide WiFi to your customers but it costs money. So, you track the device MAC address as they move around, they can sell this to businesses in the area to find out how many people pass, how long they stop at shops, look in windows etc.  I assume the part that is less friendly is that to actually use the WiFi you have to provide your email, phone number, DOB and name to sign up. So this information is no longer anonymous MAC addresses but now something that can be associated with a person."
gadgets,3dhpmt,oscarandjo,5,Thu Jul 16 14:25:50 2015 UTC,People are bothered by exactly this but it already happens if you use a Windows operating system. They track/record your IP and MAC address (how else would they know if you used your windows license key on more than one computer) not to mention anything else other closed source software run.

gadgets,3dhpmt,alien_moon_base,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:50:18 2015 UTC,"Huh I am confused. What are you talking about? Microsoft verifying the authenticity of your Windows license or the wifi hotspot having access to your Mac address? If the latter, what does it have to do with windows, all operating systems sent your MAC address and since the hotspot assigns you the IP, they already know that. If it is the former, the windows license key is verified (regardless of the ip address), based off your hardware structure. Which is why when your wifi card stops working, you can replace it (along with the embeded MAC) without worrying about the license."
gadgets,3dhpmt,Nivla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"No, the Windows activation is tied to your motherboard's serial number (or perhaps some other similarly meaningless but unique serial), not your MAC address. Tying it to MAC or IP wouldn't make sense for many reasons - your IP address will change depending on the network you're connected to, and your MAC address is built into your network adapter, not your ""computer"" per se. So if you have an ethernet adapter and a wireless adapter, the two would have different MAC addresses. Likewise, if you have a built-in wifi adapter but you purchase an external wifi adapter to use instead, then again, the external wifi adapter would have a different MAC address. I might add that MAC addresses are also very easy to spoof.  When you activate Windows, it simply sends the license key and motherboard serial to Microsoft. If you later try to install on a different computer with the same license key, the activation servers will notice that you are trying to use the same key but the serial has changed, so activation will fail. No need to do any complicated MAC/IP tracking."

gadgets,3dhpmt,altiris28048,2,Thu Jul 16 23:25:09 2015 UTC,"I think the most likely explanation is that you just have a multi-use license key.

gadgets,3dhpmt,shiftyeyedgoat,8,Thu Jul 16 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"They're probably talking about the ""tracking you around town"" part. While a VPN will encrypt and hide the information you're sending through the WiFi hotspot once you're connected (so the passwords and data should be safe), your device still has to talk to the WiFi hotspot to connect and that happens at a lower level of the OSI model before the VPN comes into play. As part of you connecting to its network the hotspot will still get information about the device you're connecting to it, such as the MAC address.  They can then infer your movements through the city based on what other hotspots that device connects to. There are ways to hide your MAC address too, but a VPN wont do that for you.  Edit: You don't even necessarily have to connect to the hotspot, things like your phone scanning for nearby WiFi can reveal your MAC address and be used to track your movement. Apple made iOS use random MAC addresses during WiFi scanning for this reason last year."
gadgets,3dhpmt,Kobel,3,Thu Jul 16 20:34:10 2015 UTC,"When you interact with another computer over a network, you do that, by so called packets, consisting of several layers of data.  There are 7 layers in the OSI model in which data get modified or added, but for explaining why a VPN can't hide your mac address, we only need to look at layer 2 and 3.  VPN's usually operate on layer 3, after they are done processing the data you send, they descend to layer 2 which is where the mac protocol jumps in and puts your mac-address in front of your encrypted traffic.  Now the thing about the OSI model is, it works like a ladder, when you send data, you climb down that ladder, and don't repeat steps (when you receive data, the exact opposite happens).   So you now have your mac address in front of the encrypted traffic and descend to layer 1 which is the Physical layer or the network hardware.  The mac-address is different from the ip-address in that it doesn't change unless you get a new network adapter, providing for an excellent tracking mechanism.  It's been some time since I learned about the OSI model though, so I could be wrong."

gadgets,3dhpmt,PasswordLost,2,Fri Jul 17 07:51:40 2015 UTC,"sure you could do that, but your mac address not only gets shared when you are connected to a network, but also when you run around with your wifi turned on. Your cellphone is constantly screaming the ssids of it's known wlans trying to get an answer from them.  And guess what it sends with those requests?  even if you didn't intercept the mac adress, the combination of known networks is pretty much unique to a smartphone, so you could be tracking everybody with turned on wlan with that alone."
gadgets,3dhpmt,amateurbotaniker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:05:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, didn't think about that. I think a larger problem would be someone hacking a hotspot and turning it into a malicious one that would start automatically running whatever sniffers and exploits they have on hand. Actually you could just run your rogue hotspot next to a popular one. Don't know if there have been many cases of it happening yet though.  I have this wild sci-fi vision where there are contaminated zones in city where it's extremely dangerous to have a device with you because of constant hacking threat and danger of turning your devices into botnet.

Either way, there's no way they're collecting >80Wh/day, especially in winter and that's an optimistic view that doesn't take into account how much the skyscrapers are going to block. Using NREL annual average numbers with 0 deg tilt (PDF warning) on a 19""x14"" (0.1716m2) panel with 15.46% efficiency -> 4.0kWh/m2/day * 0.1716m2 * 0.1546 = 106Wh/day in the optimal (e.g. the plastic on top blocks no radiation, no shadows from buildings/people/trash etc) and there's less than half of that radiation in winter months.  Figure a 2W cellular connection and 2W wifi-router (this is pretty low end and will give crappy range) so 4W total, that's only enough juice for 80Wh/4W = 20h of operation/day.

In retrospect, I should've flown, but if it was self-driven, I wouldn't have cared.  In general, I can see driving your own car post-automation like riding your own horse post-car - something to do in the safety of a closed course/track where you can really go all in and enjoy it rather than as a necessity. That does mean a lot of average folks in the future won't ever drive their own car (just like they'll never ride a horse,) but it's not like they were getting much if any leisure driving in away, and would probably be afforded greater leisure if they didn't have to think about their commute but instead could watch Netflix or whatever."

If people prove to be inferior to robot cars, laws and insurance costs will likely drive them off the road over time. It's not that there aren't people who could do it just as well, but since public policy and insurance are based on averages, that might simply squeeze driving out of the public storage. beyond that, 100% self driving allows for the possibility of higher speeds due to faster reaction times, plus the possibility of allowing those who would be unsafe behind the wheel (drunk, distracted, actual children) to utilize cars or maybe even use cars in a rentable pool. the car be more efficient as a transportation mode and can become a service rather than property requiring individual maintainance, insurance. I mean, my car gets maybe 2 hours of driving a week - it's utility justifies it's cost under the current model, but if I could instead just pay for automated rides, I might come out ahead of ownership, or given ownership, I could have my car be in an uber/lift self driving pool earning me money rather than sitting in parking.  beyond that, if one had a really nice manual sports car, it'd never really be in a position to drive to it's potential in a fleet of super law abiding automated cars. much like a racing horse, it's on the track where manual driving would actually be as exciting as it can be. even a modern hatchback largely just putters around, and would be more than drive away from regular human drivers, let alone potentially super boring robot drivers, assuming they wouldn't open the door to traffic patterns like threaded intersections, which would be beyond safe human driving.  tl;dr: it's either too boring or too unsafe to mix human and self driving traffic. might as well manually drive where you can really do it right once doing so isn't a necessity."

This simple repetition of non random keys plus knowing how Engima worked was key to breaking the code.

Once the rotors were set you could type out your message and send it without fear of it being intercepted, as the only way to decode the message was to have another enigma machine and have the rotors set to the same settings that the sending machine had.

The flaw was that a letter could never be itself in the code. Therefore if the code had a letter A in it you knew that the translated message could never have the letter A in that position. You could take a common phrase such as ""weather report"" in German and compare it to sections of the coded message. You are looking for a sequence of letters in the code that when lined up with the phrase has zero of the same letters in the same positions. There is a good chance that this section of code is that phrase."

gadgets,3dipu4,allkill,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I love the look of the Misfit devices. I saw one ""in the wild"" for the first time this week. I love how they just kind of sit there doing nothing until you tap them and then that gives you your progress toward your goals, then again to get the time with the 12 lights. Someone put some SERIOUS thought into the usability design of those things.  Almost everyone seems to be either on the Fitibit bandwagon except a handful of people who have bought into Jawbone UP or the Garmin line up of GPS watches and fitness trackers."

gadgets,3de2go,btribble,3,Wed Jul 15 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"That is actually a falsehood. All of that material still exists, they just lifted the active parts of the chips off of it and then threw it in the trash at the lab versus you throwing it in the trash at your house."
gadgets,3de2go,cestith,3,Wed Jul 15 16:59:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's much more difficult to recycle it into another wafer at the factory than to dig it out of the city landfill and recycle it?

gadgets,3de2go,cestith,2,Wed Jul 15 17:03:19 2015 UTC,"If they can save this much of it, though, that may open the possibility of polishing it down and re-etching the next layer.

gadgets,3de2go,btribble,2,Wed Jul 15 18:10:53 2015 UTC,Fear of contamination and impurities prevents reuse. Anything that can cause failures lowers yields and makes you less cost competitive.
gadgets,3de2go,cestith,0,Wed Jul 15 20:53:35 2015 UTC,Using a wafer once rather than 2000 times would seem to also lower yields.

gadgets,3de2go,btribble,11,Wed Jul 15 15:48:37 2015 UTC,Do you have any understanding of how many ICs/embedded systems are around you? They're inside everything from smoke detectors to microwave ovens to smart watches to cars to doorbells. Most of those don't run in gHz territory at all. Some of them are literally no more than a small 16hz adding machine. It's pretty amazing if you can replace those literally billions of garbage-creating systems with something that runs more than fast enough for 90% of our computing needs while being mostly biodegradable. CPU clock speed isn't the be all and end all of how we should evaluate computing technology.
gadgets,3de2go,Holymyco,5,Wed Jul 15 16:12:18 2015 UTC,"The only thing biodegradable is the substrate. The substrate is basically just a silicon crystal, and isn't a source of pollution per se. You can eat a ground up silicon wafer and it will do no more harm than eating an equivalent amount of sand. The ""polluting"" parts of the chip are the doped, active parts of the chip. This still has those. In the case of existing electronics, there is a perception that they should be recycled in some fashion. We might fail at this, but no one is saying, ""Just throw it in the bushes. It's biodegradable!"" Well, these folks seem to be making that claim to some extent, and that is just plain stupid.  What we need is better recycling policies and systems in place to deal with e-waste. What we don't need is for someone to come up with a system that falsely claims their products are biodegradable. These are not biodegradable in any kind of responsible way."
gadgets,3de2go,jacobstoutfm,2,Wed Jul 15 16:50:19 2015 UTC,The problem I see is that the chip is just one tiny part of the system. It will decrease the amount of waste in any of these products by less than one percent.
gadgets,3de2go,jacobstoutfm,0,Wed Jul 15 16:31:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understand this. Was just putting a one-liner out there. If this chip proceeds more power than expected, we could actually be onto something. We could be changing the computing world, especially for gamers. Hopefully, the recycle hippies don't come for us."
gadgets,3de2go,btribble,2,Wed Jul 15 16:15:31 2015 UTC,My phone runs a 2.7 GHz processor but I have a lot of doubt that this computer chip will have more power than 1.5 GHz.
gadgets,3de2go,thedumbprogrammer,2,Wed Jul 15 15:49:48 2015 UTC,1.4GHz is the same processing power has a low-end Mac computer - thats a pretty awesome feat for an organic chip.
gadgets,3de2go,jacobstoutfm,4,Wed Jul 15 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"The actual ""chip"" portions of this chip are not organic. This is the equivalent of making a car body out of wood and then saying the car is biodegradable. What about all the other parts that make a car a car? How about the engine? This is just another case of a college professor screwing around because he has free labor in the form of student assistants, and a college willing to throw money his way on the off chance he stumbles across something patentable. Honestly, the most important part of the chip as far as recycling goes is the rare earth elements such as gallium. At some point we're going to want to recapture that for reuse, not bury it in the ground."
