MortalKombat,3e18qr,mrbrittain,17,Tue Jul 21 04:27:30 2015 UTC,Now Tremor already has two hidden brutalities? That sure is unusual.

MortalKombat,3e18qr,WrightJustice,3,Tue Jul 21 04:41:17 2015 UTC,Defiantly weird? I suppose he is defying the usual number of brutalities.

MortalKombat,3e194e,ArashFT,6,Tue Jul 21 15:04:55 2015 UTC,I share your sentiment.
MortalKombat,3e194e,kuklavudu,3,Tue Jul 21 10:38:10 2015 UTC,"I like to think he'd use these variations;   Shadow Clone; (similar to his MK9 variation) low damage, large combos.  Shadow Scythe; you can use it similar to Jade and be able to attack or grab at a distance but you lost the shadow clone because he is the scythe. Probably give him shuriken again Wraith; lots of manipulative power ups. Perhaps the ability to shortly immobilize the shadow by the shadow controlling them for a free hit similar to SZs freeze. His old ball move that prevents blocking and adds confusion if meter burned."
MortalKombat,3e194e,Kekoa_ok,3,Tue Jul 21 14:16:39 2015 UTC,what about his portals u think that would be a better variation than wraith?
MortalKombat,3e194e,dkrypsion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:40 2015 UTC,Probably should go with wraith. Doesn't seem like he uses his shadow for that like his ball.  Like a very special move reliant t get the advantage and perform a lot during a combo but still deal that shit damage he did in MK9
MortalKombat,3e194e,Kekoa_ok,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:19 2015 UTC,well no doubt they would have to vary it to where its some what similar to warlock quan chi but i think the portals and shadow balls are being undermined its a great poke range mechanic.
MortalKombat,3e194e,dkrypsion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:55 2015 UTC,"They didn't do damage though, did they? I think only when meter burned it slams the opponent into the ground"

MortalKombat,3e3t36,DrippyNose,2,Tue Jul 21 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"I can answer some of these, although I don't know Erron.  An attack is a good poke when it has low start up frames, as the most important part. You can fit a poke after a block and start maintaining pressure, or fit a poke after your blocked string and continue applying pressure. Normally d1 or d3 is used as pokes, depending on which is better. If you land a poke, you'll have hit advantage and can do a 50/50 for example. F1 is presumably the one where Erron hits with his gun overhead? If so, that's not a good poke, really. It starts slow compared to pokes and has a lot of recovery frames.  Mix ups are really just overheads and lows 'mixed'. F13 is a good mix up, yes, it goes from overhead to low. Is db4 the sand? If so, you shouldn't throw it out every time you go F13. You should first press F13, then see if it connects or not, and then quickly decide whether to do the sand or not, as the sand makes the string unsafe, but leads to big damage if it connects. Same thing with things such as Scorp teleport or Kung Jin bo swat.  Throws belong in the mix up category too, you can for example do a string with plus frames and go into a throw, when the opponent is stuck blocking.  When learning characters you should pay the most attention to combos that launch and therefore lead to combos, mix ups (overheads, lows), fast start ups for punishing and the combos that are safe. If you do a lot of more then -10 on block combos, you'll get punished. -8 is relatively safe already, especially online, although that's a bad mindset. Most launchers have a start up of about 7 or 8 frames, but usually have a faster combo starter just for punishes."
MortalKombat,3e3t36,Hansalel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:51 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the informative reply! I think I'm beginning to understand it much more now. Also yes you got it correct DB4 was the sand and F1 is the gun overhead. On the other hand I guess I'm going back to training mode and I'm test some more and probably do some more Erron Black research since I've been doing primarily research on the game overall. Again thank you a lot for the help! A few of my friends are looking to get into the game too so I'm definitely going to send this to them.

MortalKombat,3e2778,mindfulshrimp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:34 2015 UTC,Not jist dead but destroyed. In a way that makes reviving or resummoning him real hard if not impossible.
MortalKombat,3e2778,TheIronMoose,2,Tue Jul 21 19:47:39 2015 UTC,"In a way that makes reviving or resummoning him real hard if not impossible.   Since when did the MK universe care about logic? Subzero became a robot, was restored, became ""evil"" or somethin, and regular again. They can bring back anyone they want and back it up with some ridiculous story plot.   A little more on topic:  I'm really not a fan of the ""reboot"" path they went with MKX. I understand they probably wanted something fresh and new but in some ways the game feels a little less familiar. It's odd having so many classic faces absent. MKX also happens to be the most visually impressive fighter to date; would've loved to see the amount of detail they'd add to Shao Kahn."
MortalKombat,3e2778,Won_Doe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:26 2015 UTC,"Really a good playable versionof shao kahn would really just operate alot like Kotal, so i just want them to give him a ""True Kahn"" or ""Emperor""  skin with shao kahns clothes."
MortalKombat,3e2778,TheIronMoose,4,Tue Jul 21 21:21:11 2015 UTC,Your attacks did do less damage to him. He had 200% hp
MortalKombat,3e2778,Clayton_11,3,Tue Jul 21 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed, miss SK and Shang Tsung as well."
MortalKombat,3e2778,Fools_Au,2,Tue Jul 21 12:22:43 2015 UTC,I hear ya. Feels kinda weird without him.
MortalKombat,3e2778,littlemiss1565,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:07 2015 UTC,"I miss shao kahn too but I like shinnok more now, why we cant have new bosses? I am sure that some people will complain if shao kahn was the boss of mkx asking for another boss."
MortalKombat,3e2sgg,Whiplash91,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:23 2015 UTC,as far as i know he would have to make a user on the ps4 and then unlock the fatalities/brutalities for himself  at least this way they will save
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,Hoobaroo,8,Tue Jul 21 15:30:32 2015 UTC,Reptile's are some of the hardest. While Predator has fairly easy ones.
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,Lorenz0o,4,Tue Jul 21 16:14:43 2015 UTC,Reptile's heart rip brutality is probably my favorite in the game. Too bad you have to land so many stupid tongue slaps
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,WalrusRider,5,Tue Jul 21 17:11:53 2015 UTC,The Easiest Brutalities to pull off all belong to the Predator.  (Excluding his X-Ray Brutality because the timing is weird)   They have no Pre-Requisites and do not require you to EX the move.
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,TonyVilla89,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:08 2015 UTC,How the heck do you do his X-Ray Brutality anyway.
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,Benw200,3,Tue Jul 21 16:40:43 2015 UTC,Try holding down while pressing the trigger buttons as oppose to while the x-ray is happening
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,yumir,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:00 2015 UTC,I read that your supposed hold DOWN before the X-Ray even connects.
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,TonyVilla89,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, you need to press Down right after doing the Xray input"
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,Celkerr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:10 2015 UTC,This is how i do it. Works every time
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,Captaincastle,5,Tue Jul 21 20:39:00 2015 UTC,I would say easiest are any throw brutalities because they are usually one button press while holding a direction for it.  Hardest has to be Jax's ragdoll because the timing to pull of the full combo is really tight and gives you no room for mistakes.
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,EatThoseOats,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:43 2015 UTC,I would say easiest are any throw brutalities because they are usually one button press while holding a direction for it.   I've been having trouble with this on Predator. When are you supposed to start holding down? During the last button input? During the animation?
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,eurobeat,4,Tue Jul 21 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"During the input, and all throughout the animation :)"
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,scrubcrusher479,4,Tue Jul 21 17:22:52 2015 UTC,Johnny Cage has an impossible one in his A-list variation. He needs to have the red aura (less than 5% hp) and needs to land a fully charged Rising Kick which take about a year to charge and hits mid.  I just don't understand how you're supposed to pull this off when all the opponent has to do is walk up to you and punch you or just hit you with a projectile.
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,MrSketchead,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"Jasons X-Ray brutality is hard to pull off. Got very lucky and managed to land it on an AI opponent once. But against a human player its nearly impossible unless you're opponent is brain dead.  Predators on the other hand are easy, dont need to meet any specific criteria before performing them"
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,T_Singh,3,Tue Jul 21 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"Liu Kang - ""Hothead"" The final hit has to come from an air fireball and strike the opponent in the head"
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,gvanmoney,2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:25 2015 UTC,Mileena has a couple easy ones
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,yinzerjagoff,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"Her piercing brutality is so easy, just finish any of her combos with b312+4."
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,Benw200,3,Tue Jul 21 16:41:57 2015 UTC,"Shinnok hold square during Hell Blast.    Just hold square on a very fast, fair damage projectile, that can be combo'ed into"
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,MrMaxAwesome,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"They're are too many easy ones that can take top spot (subzero, ermac soul ball, predators,). the hardest Id have to say is Jax's rag doll and  maybe some of reptiles is up there contending as well"
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,sspence57,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:23 2015 UTC,"As long as the opponent don't sprint, Scorpions teleport brutality only requires a bar and to be airborn. Does not have any pre-requisites, super easy."
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,simsolabi,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"Reptile's Deceptive variation one is not entirely difficult, just annoying to pull off. You have to make three (or four, I forget) Acid Puddles to do it; it's a waste of meter."
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,Quesadilla_Quarian,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"All of erron blacks bar his gunslinger brutality are all easy, id seems like jax's heavy weapons would be hard as you have to nail a rocket on an airbourne opponent, outside of a combo"
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,JustADudewithBalls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:40 2015 UTC,Ice ball + uppercut is so easy to pull off.
MortalKombat,3e2xbd,aznkriss133,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:46 2015 UTC,Jason's are pretty easy (other than the X-Ray one) but they need meter. Predator also has pretty easy ones. Hardest are probably Reptile's brutals and Kotal's sunlight

MortalKombat,3e3a9e,ZombineTM,7,Tue Jul 21 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Well the age old answer ""Mk wouldn't be MK without fatalities"" still stands. Because it wouldn't be mortal kombat :L  If all that happened was their head popped off then it wouldn't make mortal kombat stand out.   It'd have some impact sure, but people would brush it off and go back to SF or Tekken.  The thing about fatalities is it's not about how gruesome it is, it's about asserrting your dominace more than anything. Salt in the wounds  ""I just kicked your ass, and now i'm going to have reptile burn your guys skin off with acid.""  Would it affect culture? Eh kinda I suppose. violent video games would still be around, and if MK wasn't the fighting game to take that step into a violent finish to a fight then another game would."
MortalKombat,3e3a9e,Warmecha,5,Tue Jul 21 17:15:40 2015 UTC,Winning a match wouldn't feel as good if they did not existed.
MortalKombat,3e3a9e,Benw200,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:51 2015 UTC,People would learn brutalities more so that would be pretty cool.

MortalKombat,3e46ld,MrZombieChaos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:01:05 2015 UTC,Aftershock is definetly one of my favorites
MortalKombat,3e46ld,SighAgain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's personal preference at this point.  Metallic is the one I have been using the most, but switching skins can be a pain sometimes. Aftershock is quite awesome, but it loses points for losing the mask. Crystalline is a head scratcher for me, but I've seen some sick kombos in that variation."
MortalKombat,3e44g4,yankee0310,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:16 2015 UTC,Different properties for most of his projectiles compared to his lava skin. More used for zoning
MortalKombat,3e44g4,beariously,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:03 2015 UTC,Turns one of his moves into a projectile. Better for zoning. Lava skin does more damage and makes some moves pop your opponent up. Better for up close combos.

Now it rips off like right above the elbow? And it isn't as bloody. It looks wrong.  Not to mention, he is wearing his MK3 pants.  Should've done the T-1000 one instead."
MortalKombat,3e0v3u,SS_Bison,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:24 2015 UTC,These are so cool. Love the Klassic poses too.  Does anyone know if the inputs for the fatalities are also Klassic?

Someone mirror matched my Jax and we both Superman punched each other for a very anime match extend and then we both went for the YOLO X-Ray as soon as it started. I guess he hit his slightly before I hit mine as his won out and killed me. It took both of us a few moments before hitting rematch trying to process the whole thing.

MortalKombat,3e0ds6,mtndewgood,-8,Tue Jul 21 02:06:08 2015 UTC,That Jax looks terrible.. I feel these graphics are toned down so they can port to the mobile game more easily and with less a drastic difference. Anyone else?

MortalKombat,3e0fvf,SteelPanther25,13,Tue Jul 21 01:05:55 2015 UTC,Semi-Cyberize her. Go beyond just metal gun gauntlets and give her a fully weaponised body-armour and implants.
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,HornPointBaragon,26,Tue Jul 21 00:30:14 2015 UTC,Giving women implants to make them more interesting ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,MakeaPrinssi,3,Tue Jul 21 01:59:44 2015 UTC,Maybe she could team up with Kano at some point?
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,TrustMeImLeifEricson,4,Tue Jul 21 01:17:25 2015 UTC,"Ya know, that's not the worst idea. If she had a plot twist where she was freely working for the bad guys, that could spice up her story/personality a bit. Fallen hero's a good trope, and MK's been pulling punches with the revenant angle. She'd need a new look to go with that new outlook, and if she got some new tech (new moveset) too, I could dig it."
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Gunnerbeu,43,Tue Jul 21 07:51:09 2015 UTC,"Not putting her in it. There's literally no backstory. She's Jax's daughter, cool, 10/10"
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,natedoggcata,13,Tue Jul 21 00:24:51 2015 UTC,"This, out of all the characters introduced in MKX, I really hope she doesnt return. She is so incredibly boring and bland.   She, however was a fantastic replacement for Jax since he filled the boring and bland role for 9 games. Good job by NRS by making him a badass in MKX"
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Kekoa_ok,2,Tue Jul 21 03:17:52 2015 UTC,But but she's getting Takeda!
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,wasteland13,4,Tue Jul 21 14:33:27 2015 UTC,I do feel like she could skip a game and come back in MK12  Hopefully with something new
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Terraneaux,18,Tue Jul 21 01:16:35 2015 UTC,"A character needs something that makes them stand out. Either their personality, their weapons and fighting style, or their visual design. Jacqui is too middle of the road with every one of these things. You can even get by with most of them being boring as long as one stands out. Cassie gets by purely on her attitude since her fighting style and costume are fairly basic. Erron Black is all about his awesome character design. He even has the same weapons as Cassie (a pair of guns). Takeda gets by with a boring design because he has those really unique whip weapons. Jacqui has a boring design, uninteresting personality, and boring weapons. The easiest way to improve her is just with a better costume, though I'd like to see them do something more creative with her gauntlets. Make them function as more than just glorified guns."
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,mjwright412,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:29:45 2015 UTC,The gun gauntlets are just too silly to me - Possibly some sort of taser glove?
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Terraneaux,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:20:27 2015 UTC,Hell I would take full exo-suit if they could make it work.
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,spellingslut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:00 2015 UTC,That could also be neat.
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Son3g,7,Tue Jul 21 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe being more 'cyber' would help but what she really needs is a more distinct personality from Cassie. Cassie is the best at the quippy, valley girl thing, Jacqui feels like a cheap rehash of that in her intros. She needs to be more like her father with a dryer, sarcastic sense of humour and an smokier, sexier voice. More blunt and cynical and 'i'm so over this shit'. Even butching her up like Valaquez in Aliens would be hot. Both her and Takeda need new voice actors imo."
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Son3g,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:25 2015 UTC,I'm imagining her looking like Future Shaundi in SR4   http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/saintsrow/images/0/0e/Future_Shaundi_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131212211841
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,ToledoJones,4,Tue Jul 21 01:20:00 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this, Make her evil have Jacqui turn on the SF maybe she joins Kano and the Black Dragon or goes on to kill of a main character like Johnny or something."
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Super-Quail,3,Tue Jul 21 01:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could be a chance to go wild with her character design.   But I doubt it'll be Johnny, I'd say if anything Sonya. It'd be more tragic because her And Cassie are starting to bond again and the Cage family are all back together. (And because face it Johnny is too popular)"
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,ToledoJones,3,Tue Jul 21 02:12:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like her going evil is the best thing to do with her she would have an effect on so many characters.
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Atlas_Perpetually,4,Tue Jul 21 02:17:18 2015 UTC,They should give her bionic legs and make her a kickboxer.
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Swagmancer,2,Tue Jul 21 03:42:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that could have been awesome in my opinion. Missed opportunity."
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,King_Doorman,2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:38 2015 UTC,Perfect way to make her similar yet different from Jax.
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Gazamataza,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:29 2015 UTC,Give her cybernetic legs!
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,iKayminaKupkake,5,Tue Jul 21 05:44:48 2015 UTC,"A couple of idea I'm getting now is Maybe her having a fight Cassie and the rest of the Good Guys causing her to leave SF. In her time away she Joins the forces of Darkness.   People are saying to (Semi) Cyberize her, maybe Kano can be the one to Augment her? She teams up with him (or his son hinted in Kanos ending). I would love to see a further rise of the black dragon.  This can result in further conflict between the Red and Black Dragon.  Story aspect of mk11?"
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Super-Quail,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:31 2015 UTC,Giving her water-gun gauntlets would be a step in the right direction. That would certainly make her more interesting.
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,Vaiist,2,Tue Jul 21 06:41:13 2015 UTC,"id say turn her into a close range fighter. give her chainsaw gauntlets, shock gauntlets and i guess keep a long range/gun variation for variety sake. but she does need a more stand out costume. and her attitude is a complete sweet heart."
MortalKombat,3e0fvf,xenorrk1,2,Tue Jul 21 07:21:17 2015 UTC,"Design Armour her up. Not a fully armoured suit like Takeda's, but give her a bit more robotic looking parts. For what I'll say in her fight style, they should give her more armour specifically around her legs.  I could probably word this better, but she looks too smooth, like young and baby-faced for a character that is portrayed to be protective and angry. Give her a look like she's more experienced in battle - she could do with losing the look like she's just a girl in uniform. Give her some scars, give her face a bit more of a serious look. I think her second skin probably would've been better as her default skin. Fight Style In her design I mentioned armouring her legs up. This could be good for a variation that gives her some sort of explosive jumps. Long or high jumps that can reach longer distances. Maybe a sort of armoured dash that could make the opponent stumble of timed right. In her High Tech variation I noticed she can power up her gauntlets - it would be cool if she had this on her legs instead and she could get more damage out of kicks. Give her a lot of different kicks too to keep the opponent guessing on what to block for when she uses this. They could maybe add to her Fully Auto variation to make her a bit more explosive. Maybe she could take a second to charge up and then a big force field could come around her that would blow the opponent away or up in the air if they get too close without stopping her from charging it. Make her rockets like predator's plasma cannon; high, low and in the air to keep the opponent on their toes.  Maybe her technology could give her a bit more zoning - she could sort of turn into a flicker of blue light that could travel through the opponent like smoke did. Don't give her a hit on them for it because every character seems to be able to get a hit out of an easy teleport, but maybe make a sort of cloud of blue light so it's harder to see what she's going to do next. Story Possible spoiler warning A lot of people are saying she should be tied in with the Black Dragon - maybe she could start a romance or something like that with Kano's son and ditch Takeda.  Speaking of Takeda, maybe something could happen to Takeda with the Red Dragon and she could maybe swear revenge if Takeda is killed by them. Or maybe Takeda could be killed and become a revenant and Jacqui would dedicate her skills to saving him like Kung Jin did with Kung Lao Or in Jax's ending He is killed by Erron Black. Maybe if they made this canon Jacqui could swear revenge on the Outworld forces and become more vengeful.  Edited ideas and spoiler tags."

MortalKombat,3dyo06,TheIronMoose,3,Mon Jul 20 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"It is always cool to see Kotal in these tournaments. But, the guy playing him was relying way to much on corner. You can get some long combos that do 30-35%, and more with totem, from mid screen. He should have done F2F2F2 EX slam, then one of the 3 hit combos kotal can do to end it. and maybe even thrown in a throw at the end."
MortalKombat,3dyo06,LANGsTON7056,3,Mon Jul 20 22:02:20 2015 UTC,Three f2s is just too risky for me unless they are mid air for the first f2. Really this variation relies on the corner anyway. You have to trap them in such a way that you can keep them from creating space because without armor or a good mixup bgkotal has a real hard time opening people up.
MortalKombat,3dyo06,LANGsTON7056,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:33 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree that it is risky. But the guy landed quite a few of them and then just continued hitting him in the same direction. I'm at a place with slow internet speed until I move back to school. So I haven't had much practice in a week or two sense the update came out. But if I remember correctly you can land three, Ex slam, Land another, and then do a 3 hit combo. Or just do F1(?)b2(?)f1b2f1b2 for a more secure hit.(Which with the totem out does about the same) And with a totem, that's like 40%   I think Kotal can open people up. With is leg sweep, and a lot of overhead."

I just don;t use it as a crutch when I'm fighting. You'd be surprised how much it trips people up when I just start using the clone at the last round.
MortalKombat,3dzd4l,DaChamp347,13,Tue Jul 21 00:21:41 2015 UTC,Because Subzero players that use the clone dont know what footsies are or how to play them and feel powerless in the neutral game without it even though Subzeros normals are increbily good. Clone is even better than MK9 since it absorbs a projectile and you can break or throw it now too. 90% of people that played Subzero Grandmaster sid so because its easy to hide behind the clone as a beginner player because its a brick wall of free combo city. Now that there are ways around it for other characters they no longer want to play him because they simply dont understand how to use it properly and find that it is too much work to learn how to.
MortalKombat,3dzd4l,grassisalwayspurpler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, someone found the answer!  Unfortunately, people don't want to put in the time to learn ""unviable"" variations, because they require a different mindset to play than just mixups or spammy projectiles."

MortalKombat,3dzd4l,de_draak,3,Tue Jul 21 11:31:43 2015 UTC,Little Mac. Top tier for the first 2 weeks to never be seen again
MortalKombat,3dzd4l,MrMaxAwesome,2,Mon Jul 20 23:02:05 2015 UTC,"Hunter Predator happened. I don't play too much Sub-Zero, but predator seems like it's just a better GM, except it doesn't block projectiles."
MortalKombat,3dzd4l,Tubostergaard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:43 2015 UTC,"There are just better, easier, flashier characters available. The clone was a beginner's crutch whose upsides were significantly affected by patch changes."
MortalKombat,3dzd4l,Inevpatoria,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:35:48 2015 UTC,Because sub zero is bad and people are figuring that out. If they had just added more cooldown to clone it would be fine. Still has good corner traps but clone leaving on block pretty much murdered his gameplan. Kinda sad because hes got a really cool character design in this one but i doubt he will ever see buffs after how much complaining people did initially. I think his unbreakable brutality is one of the coolest in the game but you wont ever see it in tournament.
MortalKombat,3dzd4l,Ninjakinryu,0,Mon Jul 20 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, can't wait to unlock that!  It looks so cool, and actually wouldn't be too hard to pull off.  I definitely get a lot of frozen uppercut brutalities with Unbreakable, though, so that might still be the easiest to do, but still."
MortalKombat,3dzd4l,furious_pillow02,-4,Mon Jul 20 21:25:23 2015 UTC,Apparently hes not good enough? I main him and have since day one i feel like i crush people. I dunno psn: comehonorfaceplz
MortalKombat,3e0ufp,Latrian-Master,2,Tue Jul 21 02:20:11 2015 UTC,"That's awesome man, I'm glad you are enjoying the game."
MortalKombat,3e195r,Alechilles,5,Tue Jul 21 04:31:34 2015 UTC,There isn't really a need for them in MK. There's only 4 attack buttons instead of the 6 that street fighter uses. MK was designed with a controller in mind.
MortalKombat,3e195r,wasteland13,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:35 2015 UTC,"Blocking also seems easier on a normal controller than in a fight stick, unlike SF which uses back2block."
MortalKombat,3e195r,xenorrk1,2,Tue Jul 21 04:39:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. If there has to be a block button then the shoulder is the perfect spot for it. Have you seen the official MK stick from MK9? The block button is in the middle, it's so awkward."
MortalKombat,3e195r,wasteland13,3,Tue Jul 21 04:42:38 2015 UTC,"Recent NRS titles haven't used diagonal inputs, which makes the standard D-pad a much more realistic approach to competitive play.  When only using cardinal directions you operate your chatacter in a way that is more condusive to the regular controller."
MortalKombat,3e195r,Vaiist,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:39 2015 UTC,"The input gates can mess with commands, sticks are generally more suited to street fighter commands rather than the traditional mk style. Hitboxes hoever are frikkin perfect for mk."
MortalKombat,3e195r,TheIronMoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:17 2015 UTC,Hitboxes?
MortalKombat,3e195r,NerdyPoncho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:26:40 2015 UTC,"Buttons instead of the control stick. Think of playing a fighter with just your keyboard.   This would be the layout.  Yes, it's frikkin perfect for NRS fighters. I've had one since they started producing them."
MortalKombat,3e195r,NerdyPoncho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:27 2015 UTC,"Huh, that seems neat. I think I'll look into those. Is there any particular one you would advise buying?"
MortalKombat,3dzzxr,AutoModerator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"Can anyone find a replay of STB WM Shujinkydink vs. TE/ M. Metroid?  Also, there was a match Madzin played where he started with sub zero then switched to blood god and one i would love to see again. Both happened at evo 2015, of course.   Thank you in advance."
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,Warmecha,12,Mon Jul 20 13:51:56 2015 UTC,The eye ball was the first thing I spotted. The hot red stood out a lot aha and that it was scorpions screams

He so badass he doesnt even look at him, he like you know what? This homie dead lets stare into the camera"
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,Subzero414,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah this guy is awesome. He looks boss as fuck, like, ""Yeah, you know what? Fuck this dude, he's dead. Let's just look in the camera and smash my hands together.""  That's as good as I can make it."
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,BBQPie,4,Mon Jul 20 22:03:13 2015 UTC,"I'm glad the wall fatality wasn't anymore gory, they could have gone a lot worse with that. Like the scene in Saw, it's still gory but I'm glad it's not worse lmao."
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,Flipdatswitch,2,Mon Jul 20 17:34:36 2015 UTC,I get what you're saying! The part where his freaking bones came out from his elbow.
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,Indigoism96,7,Mon Jul 20 19:20:30 2015 UTC,I may be mistaken but I think that's a bead on Quan Chi's outfit

MortalKombat,3dy1vt,CowsOnABridge,3,Mon Jul 20 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"Tremor's Brutalities will be like everyone else's: seven decapitations and one leg or arm removal. Or maybe like Kano's: four torso splits and three decapitations.  I exaggerate, but only slightly."
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,Erotic_Walrus,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"They're actually pretty creative imo. Link, that video also has his ending so if you don't want that spoiled stop right after the brutalities."
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,BlackKnight7341,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:12 2015 UTC,"I am genuinely shocked. They seem to have gone all out for Tremor, which is great because his inclusion in the first place is 100% fan service. It's a pity the other kharacters didn't receive such individualized attention, though."
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,Erotic_Walrus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:28:38 2015 UTC,Exactly. I find it odd that ppl get so hype over the brutalities like their unpredictable.

MortalKombat,3dy1vt,random-relay,-9,Mon Jul 20 14:48:35 2015 UTC,After Predator's shit fatalities anything would be an improvement.
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,Flipdatswitch,8,Mon Jul 20 13:58:41 2015 UTC,Don't speak smack about Predator.
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,Abdulaziz679,6,Mon Jul 20 17:33:54 2015 UTC,Well his fatalities are pretty boring. At least he makes up for it with his brutalities.
MortalKombat,3dy1vt,Captaincastle,3,Mon Jul 20 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"Predator's second fatality is fantastic, and his first one is just not quite as cool."
MortalKombat,3e1qvx,bmKID,4,Tue Jul 21 07:54:00 2015 UTC,"It's hard to give advice on a match like that.   That is just 2 guys online doing random moves to eachother. You didn't know the Kano matchup, and he clearly didn't know the Jason matchup.   You'll get more help if you post a video of you playing against someone who actually knows what they're doing. That Kano player let you get away with F42 like 10 times because he has no idea how to punish it. If you did that against me you'd eat a full combo every single time.   That being said, your gameplay is pretty good for a beginner."
MortalKombat,3e15aa,Kissfan001,2,Tue Jul 21 03:54:36 2015 UTC,"With the Predator and Tremor xray brutalities you need to hold it during the actual hit that starts the xray,like predator stabbing them or tremor throwing them up.Hope that helped :)"
MortalKombat,3e15aa,EatThoseOats,2,Tue Jul 21 03:56:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I got it to work, I think I was holding too late."

MortalKombat,3dxcz1,Warmecha,16,Mon Jul 20 09:21:27 2015 UTC,......  Think I'm going to use that panel from now on haha
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,accursedspatula,26,Mon Jul 20 13:31:59 2015 UTC,Havik got dat PhD in 'deadly green energies.'
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,wasteland13,25,Mon Jul 20 10:25:17 2015 UTC,I'm so confused by this issue. Did Havik just crack open Reiko's head like an egg and pull Shinnok's amulet out of his brain?
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,Pyral,31,Mon Jul 20 09:15:10 2015 UTC,Remember in the earlier issues that the amulet was split up into the kamidogu daggers. It seems that Havik has tricked Reiko into stabbing them all into himself to become a host to the reunited amulet
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,wasteland13,9,Mon Jul 20 10:30:00 2015 UTC,Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh alright
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,wasteland13,5,Mon Jul 20 19:40:19 2015 UTC,Yes
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,LShagwell,10,Mon Jul 20 09:15:56 2015 UTC,This comic is getting very Cronenbergian.

MortalKombat,3dxcz1,MannySantiago,3,Mon Jul 20 14:00:53 2015 UTC,That seems to be the case. I'm curious to see how mileena ends up with it.
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,kungfukai,7,Mon Jul 20 09:16:51 2015 UTC,The amulet was secured in Earthrealm until Kano swiped it for Mileena. Find out by playing the MKX Story Mode.
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,AntiSmile,18,Mon Jul 20 09:46:06 2015 UTC,"Reiko in his final moments.  Shame really, all the build up ended to be really anti-climatic."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,DoctorWormberg,12,Mon Jul 20 11:37:56 2015 UTC,"You are tearing me apart, Havik!"
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,mtndewgood,13,Mon Jul 20 13:19:10 2015 UTC,That was kinda anticlimactic in concerns to Reiko. Brilliantly built up and then just destroyed after becoming the blood god.
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,DoctorWormberg,7,Mon Jul 20 10:33:42 2015 UTC,Yea no kidding. Reiko gets shafted again.
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,UVladBro,15,Mon Jul 20 12:28:21 2015 UTC,Not only that he gets a pretty badass looking outfit and then just dies.
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,megustaba,2,Mon Jul 20 12:33:05 2015 UTC,Well he did just wipe out 100 people in one blast.   That was pretty badass.
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,Commando_Joe,11,Tue Jul 21 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"Everyone zoom in on Raidens face in the 5th panel, I would screenshot but I'm on mobil"
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,Etern4mPh4nt0m,10,Mon Jul 20 13:44:30 2015 UTC,"Awwwww....I mean I know it had to lead into the game, but that ending was kind of weak.  SUMMON A BLOOD GOD THAT'S SUPER POWERFUL AND WRECKS SHIT-jk he was just part of a relic summoning ritual."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,Commando_Joe,9,Mon Jul 20 10:48:59 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, Shinnok is probably more powerful than Reiko as a blood god would ever be since he is an Elder God."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,wasteland13,6,Mon Jul 20 11:54:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe, unless Reiko's power is dependent on sacrifices. But we'll never know now."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,PowerStacheOfTheYear,3,Mon Jul 20 12:29:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think there really is anything to know. I don't think he actually was a blood god, it was just a trick by Havik."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,Commando_Joe,2,Mon Jul 20 21:24:14 2015 UTC,"Well, he caused a giant burst of energy that was seen on the horizon and instantly absorbed the blood of a hundred prisoners simultaneously, strewing the chunks of their decimated bodies across his surroundings.  That seems fairly godly to me."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,Fierce_Mudcrab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:26 2015 UTC,"But then there's the whole variant with Kotal Kahn, and I have a hard time believing the entire purpose of the Kamidogu was to summon Shinnok's amulet."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,nonotthemindprobe,7,Tue Jul 21 01:20:44 2015 UTC,Havik was probably shitting bricks that Reiko would kill him moments before executing his plan.
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,Agus-Teguy,10,Mon Jul 20 16:20:45 2015 UTC,"Called it. No way in hell was a kleric of Chaosrealm helping out an Outworld jobber like Reiko out of the goodness of his own heart.  But hot damn, this was gory as fuck."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,TheIronMoose,3,Mon Jul 20 13:38:54 2015 UTC,"""What in Gorbak's ghost was that?!"" lol"
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,PowerStacheOfTheYear,3,Mon Jul 20 15:26:43 2015 UTC,"Mad props to havik man. This makes me want him as dlc so bad. Reiko might still have blood god stuff going on so who knows maybe he will regenerate from a puddle. I really want havik to take quan chis spot as master manipulator now, and ermac can take up the whole master summoner/necromancer."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,TheIronMoose,5,Mon Jul 20 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping that Reiko wouldn't end up just being a pawn for Havik, but I guess that was being too optimistic."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,PowerStacheOfTheYear,3,Mon Jul 20 12:48:24 2015 UTC,"havik is like quan chi, dealing with him at all makes you a pawn of his, just prey you are a bishop or knight, which is what reiko was. Highly useful, sacrificed at just the right time."
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,TheIronMoose,4,Mon Jul 20 16:51:26 2015 UTC,But Havik will do things just to stir shit up and sew chaos.  Like in his Deception ending where he resurrected Shao Kahn just because he knew Kahn would start more wars.  I was hoping he was just doing that instead of using Reiko like this.
MortalKombat,3dxcz1,IBrewMyOwnBeer209,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:19 2015 UTC,"I mean realisticly he still is doing things just to sew chaos. As it stands, he is single handedly responsible for raidens, cassie, jaqui, and subs first corruptions, and pretty much the entirety of mkx's events. hell he might have been trying to create a new shao kahn, but chaos magic is a bit wonky and he got the amulet instead."

If you connect a teleport throw, or cloud, you can start the infinite loop. The cloud is similiar to Soul Ball (MKX) in which you can't block while it's active. So if you cloud, then teleport, the teleport animation is longer than the cloud recharge. So you just cloud->combo->teleport->cloud->combo->teleport->cloud. It's not possible to stop the loop unless the other player drops it. Fun stuff."

MortalKombat,3dygq2,SS_Bison,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:07:55 2015 UTC,"His normal throw. Smoke's does the same thing. Essentially what happens is your cross up the opponent. In UMK3 you have to hold away to block being thrown, but Cyrax and Smoke can get right on top of you after a throw so you don't know which way is the right way to block being thrown.  Smoke is especially annoying with the tactic because of his air throw. You get thrown enough and try to jump away and he'll grab you every time. You can do it with Cyrax as well but it's harder since he has a command air throw."
MortalKombat,3dygq2,SS_Bison,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:38 2015 UTC,"We should play sometime.  I have it on PSN and MAME.  I play at a VERY high level, and have never seen robot smoke do a glitchy throw like that.  Cyrax, yes.  But not smoke.    Their air throws have nothing in common.  Cyrax you have to hit it just right and Smoke could throw the moon out of orbit with his throw. lol"

MortalKombat,3dzo1u,TheIronMoose,3,Tue Jul 21 03:33:50 2015 UTC,"The fightline is essentilly all the active area where the characters normally operate. This means all collision happens there. If the character was temporarily outside of the fightline, say to pick up an interactable, they would not be affected by something that would otherwise collide with them."

The best thing I've learned in all my hours in the lab with her: try to buffer the input as much as possible. Test the game to find the earliest possible point you can do the inputs. It mitigates some of the difficulty and with a shit ton of practice, can make things like b1 > cancel > 212 fairly consistent, even online"

MortalKombat,3dydyu,GreatJman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"They do, I love the feeling of when you can't pick which variation to main first."
MortalKombat,3dydyu,NackJines,14,Mon Jul 20 23:07:50 2015 UTC,"I would like to see it but I feel they could limit a character to having two variations. A lot of characters in this game suffer from having variations that are significantly better than their other ones, and I feel limiting it to two would allow them to better balance and provide reason to pick either variation. I don't particularly mind that some characters have a ""just for fun"" variation (gunslinger Eb, deceptive reptile, etc.) but if it means that two variations could be equally as viable for every character I could do without a variation for messing around."
MortalKombat,3dydyu,NackJines,3,Mon Jul 20 19:36:36 2015 UTC,"I agree that 2 variations is better then 3 because there are obvious variations that everyone plays, and then there are the variations that aren't nearly as good that nobody plays."
MortalKombat,3dydyu,Venom44,3,Mon Jul 20 23:09:12 2015 UTC,Exactly. And when I look at some of these characters and their variations I just feel that they could have taken the unique tools out of the weakest one and distributed them amongst the two others or just implemented into their universal move set. Reptile for example - his invis could easily just be a move he gets in both variations. (coughPREDATORcough).

MortalKombat,3dydyu,thafredator,3,Mon Jul 20 15:33:33 2015 UTC,Yeah they really are a big part of MKX.
MortalKombat,3dydyu,OhLookItsJund,7,Mon Jul 20 15:49:13 2015 UTC,I dont know though... I like the idea of variations but were also missing a lot of potential characters because of it. Thats really the trade off.
MortalKombat,3dydyu,Ninjakinryu,2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"If you mean because it'd be hard to make 3 variations for a character, I gotta say, if they did it for Reptile ,Sub-Zero, and Goro they shouldn't have a problem with any other character."
MortalKombat,3dydyu,santh91,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think he means that development time spent on variations could have been used to flesh out new characters, like the story mode exclusive characters for example."

MortalKombat,3dyvah,D90T,5,Mon Jul 20 17:28:18 2015 UTC,"To touch on your Goro percentage. I'm not 100% sure if this is your case as you may actually play him, but: Offline Matches are for some reason logged for the same character stats as online matches.  My record with Erron Black is 150-500 because I boosted up a faction really quick before the faction war ended which involved resetting hundreds of times to get the specific Easy Brutality modifier. Doing so counted as a loss each time so it effectively ruined my record, even though I know I'd be positive with Erron Black right now. Likewise you may have done a couple towers as Goro which probably put you at a 20-0 record.   As far as real win percentages go, my main is Cassie but my best record is Sonya. Sonya is such an online hero, as long as you're being aggressive, people won't block your mixups. I'm a pretty above average player to begin with, but I've won plenty of games I have no business winning because of her, even though she's my secondary."
MortalKombat,3dyvah,rdubyeah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree on Sonya being an online hero. My Sonya is around the ball park of 473/120 or something. I attribute it to the fact that even though she's been getting a lot of play in the competitive scene, most people still don't know how to deal with her mix ups. Not to mention the fact that Sonya has very good BnB combos, most requiring no meter, hard stuff for a lot of people to deal with. Of course this applies mainly to covert ops. Demolition is good too, I've had fun with it, but IMO the versatility from military stance is too good to pass up on unless you don't like the rushdown game."
MortalKombat,3dyvah,i3atRice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:45 2015 UTC,"I was talking to my friend a couple days ago about Covert Ops Sonya offline and online and what we both basically determined was that she sadly has nowhere to go but down.  Her mixup game is strong, ridiculously strong even, but the more people that are exposed to her, the weaker she becomes. She has no real advanced tech that will be discovered to boost her to the top, she's just a crazy mixup and aggro character. She also has no real ""strong matchups"" its more that she's just a strong character against the person. Once people adapt, their ""characters"" will too, and tier lists are typically matchup based.  Granted, even though she ""has nowhere to go but down"" on the tier list, doesn't mean she won't still be ridiculous online for a long long time."
MortalKombat,3dyvah,rdubyeah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"Well IMO the one strength she does have that not many other characters do, is that Covert Cops Sonya has a mix up within her mixup if you utilize military stance properly. You 50/50 with her overhead or low obviously, combo, and then the opponent now has to guess whether you're going to grab, low, or overhead. Overhead is probably the most dangerous since it leads into most of her combos, but still it makes her rushdowns a lot more dangerous than a lot of other characters I would say. Demo and Special Ops have a lot of different tech around them, but I don't think either of them have the damage potential, and relatively consistent damage that Covert Ops has. On the other hand I agree with you a lot, it seems NRS made CO as a purely rushdown-mixup variation that wins by just by blitzing the opponent and keeping them guessing. No real secret strengths, when you fight Sonya you know what to expect."

MortalKombat,3dy0vx,rafikiknowsdeway1,8,Mon Jul 20 13:43:36 2015 UTC,"The neutral game is when both opponents are on their feet. It is about the knowledge of your own and your opponent's ranges, about movement and spacing, all in order to gain an advantage or set up a mixup situation that starts up a combo.  Plus/minus on block means that the move is positive or negative in regard to recovery frames. In short, the game runs at 60 frames per second, and each attack you perform has three phases: startup, active and recovery. If your recovery is negative on block, that means that if your attack or string is blocked, your opponent can do something before you can (because your animation is still playing the recovery frames and he has some attacks that come out faster than your recovery frames end) and therefore punish you."
MortalKombat,3dy0vx,Aremah,3,Mon Jul 20 13:50:18 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out that being negative on block doesn't always mean you can be punished.  If a move leaves you about -5 frames or less, that move is still safe, but also negative.  In this situation, your opponent can't punish, as I'm fairly certain the fastest move in the game is 6 frames, but this does allow the opponent a lot of time to set up a mixup scenario or block pressure."
MortalKombat,3dy0vx,furious_pillow02,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:25 2015 UTC,and what does positive on block mean? that you have x amount of frames to do something to your opponent?
MortalKombat,3dy0vx,Aremah,4,Mon Jul 20 14:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. It means that your recovery frames end before your opponents blockstun (bascially block animation recovery frames) ends, so you can follow up with another attack and keep them blocking (in blockstun) or catch them pressing a button (also known as a frametrap, that is when your move goes into active frames while his move is still in the startup frames, so your move hits him before his can hit you - often also granting you a counterhit, which is big in some other games, but I'm not sure it even exists in MK)."

MortalKombat,3e1h2v,rundle0509,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:11:48 2015 UTC,Steam updates in about 9 hours and 10 minutes. That's when Tremor will most likely arrive. This has been the case with past DLC characters as well.
MortalKombat,3e1h2v,MrDutchguy,0,Tue Jul 21 07:47:40 2015 UTC,Ahahahahahaha. No. My guess is two weeks. Here's the log btw: https://steamdb.info/app/307780/history/ You can't tell whether they're fixing bugs or implementing Tremor but usually we get the updates after these changes become more and more frequent. At least that's the way I observed with other DLC content and patches. Maybe they'll be quicker this time.

I'm really just trying to look at how to players much better than me use spacing with him, if it's the zoney type of play you see with ancestral or the rush down of Bojustu."
MortalKombat,3dy1pz,FayazsF,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:07 2015 UTC,Its definitely more rush down than ancestral. It's pretty good because you can throw your disk for a Low that can combo into NJP even though the distance looks ludicrous. The mixups are also crazy because you have two strings that start low or overhead that can lead into full combo. You also gain a new move thats a hard knockdown and corner carry

MortalKombat,3dv5ub,s3vv4,-5,Sun Jul 19 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"why?  MK and Injustice are the least 'reaction'-skill heavy games in the fighting genre and also require way less dexterity.  Those games are all about adaptation to your enemy and reading him, and that's where SonicFox is king and the reason he is unstoppable."
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,Makalol,8,Sun Jul 19 21:19:48 2015 UTC,part of reading is reaction lol
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,Bill_H_Cosby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:00 2015 UTC,"Most players require about 17-19 frames to react to something when they're focused on it. Most overheads in MKX are far faster than that. When your overheads are too fast, ""reactions"" don't really count for much at all.  In situations where you have to be completely focused on the situation to react in time, reactions are used in cooperation with reads, but oftentimes those situations aren't pushing the limit of your reaction times anyways. Good players often play around their limitations."

MortalKombat,3dv5ub,furious_pillow02,21,Mon Jul 20 00:15:21 2015 UTC,SonicFox is the best MK X player on the planet. DJT is my boy but he talked a good amount of smack on sonic during the YOMI streams and Sonic was the player who ultimately eliminated him. Also to be honest seeing him rip through losers like a madman was pretty inspiring to say the least.

MortalKombat,3dv5ub,BobTheGambler,5,Sun Jul 19 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"Sonicfox is absolutely the player to beat for anyone out there. He practices and plays so much he earned this win. He has been taking nrs games to a whole level above everyone else and consistently playing at that level. Great performances by honey bee and foxy they definately came close to stopping this monster but in the end he pulled it out. Losing to honey bee then beating him in the runback was impressive enough but to also come back from such a life defecit in that one round was not only crucial but super impressive. First esl now evo, is this the start of another undefeated year for sonicfox? People better practice up or he's going to keep taking their money. Good job sonicfox finally silencing the haters."

MortalKombat,3dv5ub,Makalol,6,Sun Jul 19 21:08:06 2015 UTC,"more money   Oh, I didn't mean it as a sign of disrespect to SonicFox. Just a reflection of myself. I'm sure it takes alot of hard work. I was watching in awe at all the players and how good they are. I wouldn't make it past the pool."
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,mabbagi,5,Sun Jul 19 21:22:15 2015 UTC,You're doing the safe thing. Imagine if you staked your yearly income on winning this tournament?

MortalKombat,3dv5ub,Dewittt,7,Sun Jul 19 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"YES, that dominating match beforehand showed that Honeybee figured it out, he was having some real troubles against the command grab, but he was doing great. He missed his chance to chip out with EX pincers and then choked hard. It makes it look like Sonic fox gave him the round before, it was 2 close to flawless victories."

MortalKombat,3dv5ub,darthrambo152,-38,Sun Jul 19 22:08:36 2015 UTC,"I had no problem with sonicfox, but after watching this evo, I lost some respect. He didn't evolve around Honeybee's gameplay, he never changed it up outside of his EB gameplay, honeybee just choked super hard.  His reliance on comboing into command grab is giving him momentum whenever he need its, and it only gets counter max 1 times per matching.Its incredibly hard to deal with in mortal kombat, and the jab string that he starts it with catches people out of the air and locks them down. It even beat a Kung Lao jump punch during one of the final matches, like hes swinging his hat and everything and the jab at the beginning of his string breaks right through. His kitana is incredibly boring to watch, as the fans from long range, and the hover air options convert 2 ranges of his game to the same thing over and over again.  Don't get me wrong hes winning, but god his characters have such great options that the game really just becomes watching 2-3 setups he has planed out over and over again. He's great at the mortal kombat fundamentals, but today I watched a lot of his opponents drop combos, and I realize not once did he use catrops to stop honeybee's block stun run combos. He's not as good as i though he was, but it is evo soooo even if i dont respect him, hes earned a lot."
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,greentoof,15,Mon Jul 20 02:28:05 2015 UTC,This has to be some elaborate troll post.
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,Dreckerr,12,Sun Jul 19 20:10:00 2015 UTC,Caltrops!? honeybee would jump over and punish him before he recovered. Shows why you are at home and sonic is at Evo lmao
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,110010101101000,-10,Sun Jul 19 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"not just in neutral god, the things last a while and there is a lot of spacing poke moments in that match where a whiff that wouldn't allow you to confirm for damage, could still let you cattletrop."
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,greentoof,3,Sun Jul 19 20:34:42 2015 UTC,He uses caltrops when they're in corner. You want him to use it in the middle where he can just walk through it with minimal damage
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,110010101101000,0,Sun Jul 19 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"D'vorahs entire mixup depth realize on him being able to run, otherwise once sonixfox blocks whats thrown, she can be punished. If you watch the match there are times where honeybee doesn't have enough stamina, drops what hes doing and gets punished. the same will happen when cattletrops are spaced properly."
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,greentoof,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:40:14 2015 UTC,Won't make a difference for high lvl players. 2nd time you drop caltrops you're done
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,110010101101000,2,Sun Jul 19 23:54:03 2015 UTC,If kitana and Erron Black are as amazing as you claim them to be (and as a kitana main i can assure you that kitana is definitely not OP) Why wouldn't everyone just start playing them? You see it in almost every other fighting game where such as MvC3 where almost every match involves a Dr.Doom. So if sonic fox's only skill is that the characters he plays are too good why wouldn't everyone else flock to those characters?
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,GarethMagis,2,Mon Jul 20 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"Doom is kind of a bad example because hes a support character and people started switching before it was necessary to have mastered all of your characters. When doom first became popular you could just slot him in with minimal effort and suddenly you have a stronger team.  In the case of Erron Black I have no idea why more people are not picking him. It seems like he has an extremely strong pressure game and is all around solid. His combos can be tricky but fuck it, people play Jax. Everybody is just too busy trying to learn lao and bone shaper shinnok."
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,thafredator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:42:47 2015 UTC,"When did I say they where amazing? I said that the Erron black setups he uses are easy to land, and that his kitana play was boring. He had certain gameplans he stuck with from the ranges of close mid and far with kitana,   Far: Throw fans until you feel your safe to run in  mid: Poke string or jump from jump you ccan always delay into whatever you want  close: had some bock strings and the uppercut   That combined with great input and confirmation is all his kitana really was. So once it gets beaten he switches characters instead of finding a new range of gameplay.  His Erron black gameplay takes a lot more work to counter properly, we've known that since ESL. Look they guy won evo, if people call him the best MK player im not gonna debate that, its just that In my opinion I've watched some real dull gameplay from him for a long time now. Honestly I liked his tanya more, in the mirror matches he showed of his control of the teleport really well. Sonic fox is not an underdog he is the complete opposite of that, hes the boring basic victor, why I'm bored with sonic fox is the same reason people are ecstatic about a reptile making it to top 8. And have you seen milky situations games, there fun."
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,greentoof,-28,Mon Jul 20 07:28:05 2015 UTC,There's something about this guy that sets off my suspicious activity alarm. Too bad they don't test for drugs at Evo.
MortalKombat,3dv5ub,PraetorianGuard14,6,Mon Jul 20 00:10:40 2015 UTC,Honestly what drug would make him play this game better?

MortalKombat,3dv1qu,kayamek,3,Mon Jul 20 09:48:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. It would have been amazing to see a chapter with Erron Black or Ferra Tor, or even Reptile or Ermac.  MK9 also had the same problem about not giving story chapters to the villains in the story, and now Ermac and Reptile aren't necessarily villains they're just doing whats best for their realm along with Kotal Kahn.  That transition from working for a brutal overlord to a more grey area do whats best for Outworld type character merits exploration."

MortalKombat,3dxlbr,SickQuilver,16,Mon Jul 20 11:01:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want that. I'd rather play an Injustice 2. It kinda ruins the MK and DC feeling when you can't perform brutal moves and or perform awesome heroic clashes.

On the other hand, guest characters bring in people who might not have played the game otherwise, which means more money for WB, but also a larger playerbase, so it's not entirely bad."
MortalKombat,3dx3an,Aremah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:07 2015 UTC,Very true! Jason and Predator are pretty neat characters and fit into MKX very well. I'm just upset about certain ninjas (cyborg and human-ish) not making the cut.
MortalKombat,3dx3an,Izzy_Leveled_Up,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:21 2015 UTC,What's your play style?
MortalKombat,3dx3an,Scorpionguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"I love Jason. Predator is very well done, but sluggish and doesn't really bring anything unique to the table in terms of gameplay. I don't play female characters, so I don't know about Tanya. So if you're gonna buy one of those three, I personally recommend Jason. However, you could also wait for Tremor, who's coming out tomorrow for Kombat Pack owners and a week later for the rest of us and looks great so far."
MortalKombat,3dx3an,Aremah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:23:08 2015 UTC,"I feel that Predator's cool but he's just one big combo extender. He has some of the best brutalities, but I think I'm having plenty fun with Jason. You gotta love that tower ending."
MortalKombat,3dx3an,MrSolid14,2,Mon Jul 20 12:32:36 2015 UTC,"Curious, why don't you play female chars? Or is it just that you've tried them out and not liked them?"
MortalKombat,3dx3an,rv0celot,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:11 2015 UTC,"Just one of my quirks; I cannot relate to a female character. My main has never been female in any of the games I've played over the years, computer or pen and paper."

Anytime. It is what it is. While I feel it's a good idea to step out of your comfort zone every once in a while, I also feel that you should have a connection with your main, whether it relates to gameplay, design or backstory, preferably all three.

MortalKombat,3dx3an,Snuwse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"Tanya is super fun because she's fast and has teleports. Really good mixups but since you're looking for fun I'd say all her variations are interesting in a way but naginata is probably the most entertaining. Predator is also really fun, all his variations are interesting and has super cool abilities. Jason is probably the least fun imo because the only ""viable"" variation is slasher and that's just one combo over and over. So id say: 1. Tanya 2. Predator 3. Jason"
MortalKombat,3dx3an,Captaincastle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:48 2015 UTC,"Relentless is more viable than slasher, imo. Slasher is easier and has that amazing f42 combo, but he's stupid easy to block. Tick throws are terrifying, and his port and pursuit give him a lot of options."

None of that means anything when it comes to skill. I'm rooting for him or Milky Situation just because I enjoyed his Reptile game."
MortalKombat,3dts4s,Windy-kun,3,Sun Jul 19 17:22:04 2015 UTC,Oh no ones doubting his skill. I think people just don't enjoy that's he's the face of the community due to his openly furry activities to the point where he's brought them along to the tourneys.personally I really enjoy watching him though. He has been so dominant in every game that it's just too damn impressive.

Not really overlooked, eb is in outside of sonicfox pretty ""overlooked"" as in being a rare occurance. In marksman you only have the slide as a reversal, you do not have sand which is outlaws best move. You furthermore lose out on some cool oki chip damage setups with tarkatan stab. It is a variation with more raw damage though. It is funny as well and you can find vods where sonic plays a solid marksaman as well"

MortalKombat,3dvmdv,emwhalen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"If you want to see how a particular character is played ""optimally"", then tournaments like EVO (the biggest & maybe best), ESL, and CEO will offer that. Twitch.tv will have those things available. Look for the EVO1 channel and the Netherrealm channel. You'll see a lot of Kung Lao, Tanya, and Sub Zero, some Shinnok, and some guys who very successfully main uncommon characters. Sonic Fox wins it all with his Erron Black and Kitana (and he gives a good show with Pyromancer Tanya too)."
MortalKombat,3dvmdv,Spork-in-Your-Rye,4,Mon Jul 20 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"She's pretty good now, but if you would've asked this question a few weeks ago, the answer would've been ""absolutely not"""
MortalKombat,3dvmdv,marshallwithmesa,2,Mon Jul 20 02:30:45 2015 UTC,What changed?
MortalKombat,3dvmdv,Butterjaw,2,Mon Jul 20 03:53:50 2015 UTC,Sonicfox won ESL and Evo with her
MortalKombat,3dvmdv,Latrian-Master,12,Mon Jul 20 04:33:12 2015 UTC,and she got 16 buffs a few weeks ago too.
MortalKombat,3dvmdv,chiXnhawk,4,Mon Jul 20 04:55:53 2015 UTC,"For someone skilled with her, I recommend Kitana Prime and some of Sonicfox's matches from the ESL Finals. Also, check out Test Your Might.  Variation wise, do whatever suits you best. The variant you'll encounter most often is Assassin. Royal Storm is a close second, and at least from my experience, you really won't encounter Mournful all that much.  I like playing all her variants as they're so different and unique!  Here's what I'd suggest:  Assassin for countering.  Royal Storm for long combos.  Mournful for interesting gameplay.  Lastly, if needed:  Beginner's Guide.  Assassin Guide.  Royal Storm Guide.  Mournful Guide."
MortalKombat,3dvmdv,BucketHatGawd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:37:34 2015 UTC,She is unique. Not the typical MKX fighter. She has no over head string at all which some think make her very low tier. But she is one of the only one who can combo long range off a projectile. So in the long run it makes up for not having an overhead starter or 50/50's. With her you need to zone most of the time. Stay air borne. She has some of the easiest combos for decent damage. But she is an acquired taste. IMHO in the meta of this game now she counters a lot of the most popular picks.

MortalKombat,3dwy9q,Weeaboo69,11,Mon Jul 20 05:38:32 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand the point of the different looks depending on variation. They did that so you can tell what variation the other person is using with a glance. So you can tell what moves to watch out for etc. If they let you use any look on any variation that would just cause confusion. So doubt that's gonna heppen.
MortalKombat,3dwy9q,demonlegato,3,Mon Jul 20 05:41:26 2015 UTC,That does make more sense now that you explain it. Thanks.

MortalKombat,3dsn4l,emwhalen,10,Sun Jul 19 03:54:23 2015 UTC,Wouldn't say they won't return. I think saddening was appropriate word choice. Mileena surely should come back somehow. NRS does crazy things with lores. For me it was sad to see baraka appear and die so quickly lol. Felt bad.

MortalKombat,3dvz5r,emwhalen,2,Mon Jul 20 11:58:21 2015 UTC,Probably the best use of MK9 at this point IMO is to play the characters that didn't return for MKX. That and story mode. Also there are some really oddball towers and challenges you can play.

MortalKombat,3du4hu,Ninjakinryu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:43:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah but if he puts the clone in the corner and just waits for the slide I get full combo punished, and if he's not next to the clone then I can't 21122  Edit just watched the video now I understand what you mean, but what do I do at midscreen?"

If you had told the 90s version of me that MK 9 and 10 would have Freddy, Jason, and Predator (and that there would even be an MK9 and 10), I'd have utterly flipped my shit.

They appeal to a different crowd, and that is at least something to be respected, as it is bringing NRS and WB more profits to keep making these games.  If they can make me as hyped for Tremor as they have, I want to see what oldies like Fujin, Sareena, and Li Mei could bring to the table.

MortalKombat,3dtx99,plotylty,0,Sun Jul 19 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, immersion. I like my MK characters to fight MK characters. Crossover universes just invalidate the game's believability to me, which is especially bothersome to someone who's played Mortal Kombat since the early days.   Often when I choose a fighter, I'm basing my decision on their place in the story and their relationships with other characters, not just their moveset, frame data, and repetitive fatalities. The lore is interesting to me as well. So you understand why it's weird to see... say, Freddy or Jason, killers from some silly old horror movies, invading one of my favorite video game universes."

MortalKombat,3dt1gh,FeltMountain,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:46:55 2015 UTC,"Armoring means using a special (EX in most cases, but I think Ferra/Torr has a regular armored one in Pain and Gain) that has at least one layer of 'armor' on it, so when hit, the character takes damage, but the special doesn't get interrupted. Most specials that aren't projectiles get armored in their meter burned versions, some are only armored when meter burned on wakeup (eg Takeda's teleport), and some have several layers of armor (Pain and Gain 3 gives you at least 4)."

As cool as flutter into NJP is once you have seen it a little bit it's really hard to actually get hit by and if you are high enough to dodge whatever anti air they are throwing at you you need to wait till you drop into range of them which gives them enough time to block.

We should also remember that, considering MOBAs are the posterboys of eSports, and neither /r/leagueoflegends or /r/Smite (not sure about /r/dota2) tolerates spoilers, because the mods acknowledge that there are people who can't watch the tournaments when it's broadcast, but still access the subreddit because LoL and Smite have several other things to talk about.  /r/MortalKombat is a place to discuss and share MK related stuff, we shouldn't expect all readers to come here for eSports discussion whenever there's a tournament."
MortalKombat,3dt1gh,SALTED_P0RK,3,Sun Jul 19 13:01:45 2015 UTC,"I've been guilty of posting (somewhat) spoilers in the past, but the big thing is it'll pop up on your front page if you're subscribed to /r/mortalkombat. So if I'm trying to browse while I'm at work and plan on watching when I get home stuff can get spoiled.  So while I agree, if it happened it would be somewhat my fault because I'd need to be more careful, but it's just a nice courtesy to keep titles spoiler free."

MortalKombat,3dt1gh,wrightosaur,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:34:14 2015 UTC,"How do you feel his playstyle differs from other people? Cause personally i'm just a fan of great matches and he has brought a lot of great matches. He's not even that vocal so i don't  even understand when people complain that he's cocky, it's like people expect him to apologize for winning so much or something.  It mostly just seems that people hate seeing someone win a lot and that's the only reason i can see that people are rooting against him."
MortalKombat,3dt1gh,Ninjakinryu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:35:37 2015 UTC,People are just haters man. Look how people cry when You try to defend him. It can be rough when your the best.
MortalKombat,3dt1gh,atriax,-2,Sun Jul 19 13:45:22 2015 UTC,Watch how he plays kitana or Tanya. His erron black scares me doe. I didn't know his fan boys were so sensitive. I don't expect him to apologize for anything. I said he was good. I just like watching other pros. http://i.imgur.com/GUUCDjL.jpg
MortalKombat,3dt1gh,lostwin1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:32 2015 UTC,He asked you straight up how his play style differs and you can't explain it. He also said he was a fan of good matches and not sonic specifically. #fail

I guess whatever it takes to make yourself feel better though?"
MortalKombat,3dt1gh,Ninjakinryu,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"Haha. Ok. Sonic plays a strong zone game with Kitana and Tanya (with the jumpy fireballs). With erron he's pressure crazy and it seems like even tho he plays him a lot and ppl see him play all the time he can still keep you guessing. I like his erron black. The others im not fond of. And of course the whole tea bagging acts of disrespect but at the same time this is a game where you dismember ppl and laugh so that's not too bad. There, I have blessed your supreme redditness with a better answer. Can you wipe your tears now?"

MortalKombat,3dte19,ElectrifiedPyro,9,Sun Jul 19 16:06:03 2015 UTC,Katrina law as Kitana EASY! I could do Jennifer Lawerence as cassie cage. Ronda Rousey as Sonya because she can really kick ass and would do her stunts. Ryan Reynolds as Johnny Cage or if they do old man johnny say fuck it and cast JCVD. Jax should be Idris Elba or another fuck it Kimbo Slice. Can't think of the rest right now i'm pretty drunk
MortalKombat,3dte19,Lmaolikeacow,8,Sun Jul 19 08:09:55 2015 UTC,Terry Crews as Jax maybe? Rest of them are on point though.

MortalKombat,3dte19,Scream26,5,Sun Jul 19 11:37:47 2015 UTC,Yeah right on point with Manu Bennett. He'd be a great kano. That ong bak guy could do the Liu Kang part pretty good.

MortalKombat,3dte19,Lmaolikeacow,3,Sun Jul 19 08:30:33 2015 UTC,"Mileena is a clone, though. Cast her for both and put makeup on her. Like Army of Darkness Ash and Evil Ash"

I could see them doing something like when Reptile became Onaga, though. It'd be a brand new character (or Shao Kahn or Shang Tsung or someone) whose soul was inside of Ermac and rose to the surface to take over. It'd be something like that, which wouldn't be Ermac any more."

MortalKombat,3dvvqw,wasteland13,0,Mon Jul 20 05:15:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but I like that they were ballsy enough to just be like, ""Nope. We finished the story. We're not going to drag it on like Dragonball Z just to make money.""  I'd prefer if they do go back to just do another sort of spinoff like Korra. Same universe, different plot and different set of characters entirely."

MortalKombat,3dvvqw,wasteland13,0,Mon Jul 20 13:36:47 2015 UTC,I don't know anything about avatar. Could you tell me how Toph could defeat Tremor if they were to fight?? just curious
MortalKombat,3dvvqw,Sasquatch_in_bush,3,Mon Jul 20 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"In that world there's a large portion of the population that have Tremor's powers, and out of that entire group she's the best with the most control over those abilities (and this is at 12 years old). She invented metalbending, which was thought to be impossible. Also she's blind and sees by sensing vibrations in the ground through her feet. She's basically the coolest.  Also, since Tremor appears to made out of rock partially, she could use her bending to lift him up in the air, break him into tiny pieces, and throw him in every direction."
MortalKombat,3dvvqw,IgotaBionicArm,0,Mon Jul 20 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"In strictly physical kombat Tremor would wreck Toph, she's only a small 12 year old girl after all, but her other abilities would allow her to curbstomp Tremor like it's nothing. She can fluidly manipulate pretty much anything comprised of earth with her mind (most benders use stances and movement to control their element, but the very top-tiers seem capable of doing it telekinetically) including mud, sand, impure metals and possibly lava. These skills are very impressive and versatile, but they're not too different from other earth users in different franchises when you get down to it.   What sets Toph apart from these other characters is her seismic sense, which gives her such an unfair advantage to the point of being ridiculously OP in a 1-on-1 fight. This ability allows Toph to sense vibrations through the ground in order to see, bypassing her natural blindness. This seems straightforward enough until you learn that she can sense and differentiate individual people from across the planet, a feat which implies a level of omnipresence that is incomprehensible if you try thinking about it. She can sense earth the moment it shifts even a millimeter, which is pretty much instantaneous, and can track her opponent anywhere they go, even in the air. If an attack approaches her, she knows it's coming and can either influence it into avoiding her, alter it's density into a harmless form or just block/destroy the attack with a construct of her own. She has a way to counter pretty much anything earth related and has insane versatility in both offense and defense. If a character relies almost solely on earth based attacks and has no secondary fighting or defensive capabilities that can hang with Toph's masterful bending, they're completely fucked."
MortalKombat,3dvvqw,xenorrk1,3,Mon Jul 20 23:55:07 2015 UTC,"Tremor is a character that has only been playable in MK9's challenge tower on the PS Vita if I'm not mistaken.  He did first appear in the Special Forces spinoff, which I'm sure we all like to pretend doesn't exist.  I'm happy he's in, admittedly. I'm glad he got a second chance and wasn't just buried in the pile of shit that was Special Forces."
MortalKombat,3dtgot,AutoModerator,3,Sun Jul 19 08:02:40 2015 UTC,Fucking Predator's bitch ass. He's the one character that pisses me off royally while I'm practicing Ermac online.

She actually wins the first match because of jump ins and that easy 1 button kick combo Cassie has.  Next match I keep throwing up the disc and blasting with HQT, shiv the crap outta her with EX BF4 and a throw/combo for 30+ damage.  Rage quit second round.  Salty message about Pred being cheap.  Scorpion spammer, used my favorite anti-scorp character, Jax.  Kept teleporting, so I kept punching face with gotcha grab.  Match 2, used Sub Zero and started knocking out combos.  Catch him in a corner, early in the match, rage quit.  Says I'm a cheap fvcking loser who only knows 1 move.  I said all you know is spear, teleport and takedown.

MortalKombat,3duzbi,darren901,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:26 2015 UTC,I've been playing on PC since the Predator patch. Pretty much all the bugs are fixed and it runs well on my laptop. There is still some artifacting on some stages but it's barely noticeable and should go away quickly or could just be that im on a laptop. There doesn't seem to be too much of an online presence but it's good enough to get fast matchmaking. It was definitely worth it though since I'm also unable to play on console.
MortalKombat,3duzbi,Bk_Nasty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:06:28 2015 UTC,"The game runs fine now, I think they fixed most ( if not all ) of the problems it had at launch. Netcode still iffy, tbh. I don't think a lot of people still play online ( peak was 2k or something? ), but someone can correct me on that.  Bottom line: game is playable now, it runs fine. No more memory leak, weird dead woods, etc.  Also, not sure if PC still is behind consoles on patches."

There's no more memory leak and there aren't any stages with huge FPS dips.   One annoying thing is that the predator patch removed Windowed borderless mode. No idea why they'd do that.

MortalKombat,3dthh9,cerulis,4,Sun Jul 19 08:17:18 2015 UTC,"DON'T get it on PC IF you can get it on PS4. There are way more players playing the game on PS4 than P.C.   As far as it being stable, yes it is stable on P.C, but the community has been dismantled from poor launch of the game.   Please do yourself a favour and get it on PS4. As record proves that running the game on console after patch (not to mention P.C users g et patches later than console users) has proved to be no problem at all, whereas us P.C users encounter problems. The most recent example being that when Predator patch was released, you couldn't play in the training session for more than 20 minutes without the game freezing."
MortalKombat,3dthh9,sushi7412,4,Sun Jul 19 12:25:24 2015 UTC,"The PC port is the black sheep, never hear any NRS even mention it now, it's like ""whatever you do, don't mention the PC version"". They don't communicate with the PC player base, no support, we don't even know who is developing the game at the moment, we get shoved a patch and some patch notes a few weeks after the other platforms. You won't feel like the game developers care a dot about you if you buy it on PC. When a patch does come, it usually contains some performance change (not always for the better)!.  Utter disaster of a launch. Deleted saves, FPS bugs, crashes, people still cant launch the game (go check steam forums daily). If you buy it, you take a risk it wont run, or it will choppy. For me, it's ok though the last patch crushed my frames a bit at the start of a match. Online is a lottery dependent on pings. On the plus side its pretty fun when it works and its dirt cheap on the serial code sites."

MortalKombat,3dsjrt,ZombineTM,8,Sun Jul 19 01:16:47 2015 UTC,I would bet it was initially put in to advertise Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game since it came out around the same time and WWF probably didn't wanna be associated with the MK controversy.
MortalKombat,3dsjrt,BombsOutOfBibles,3,Sun Jul 19 01:20:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, it was probably meant to promote it. Didn't Midway make the WWE arcade games at the time as well? Probably meant to show it during Attract mode."

The reason why you're wrong is because each and every one of those thumbtacks pierced the skin.

The ring is made of wood, you fall flat on your back, and the tacks are just a bonus. Taking bumps fucking sucks and the immense pain those guys have to suck up is the reason I decided to put my dreams of being a wrestler behind me. I completely understand how you can liken it to the bed of nails trick, but it's not at all the same.

MortalKombat,3duz18,Hype_Magnet,13,Sun Jul 19 19:13:35 2015 UTC,Aris is hilarious what are you talking about. You seriously think this commentary is less entertaining than Tyler or Derrick not knowing what they are talking about on their own game?

MortalKombat,3duz18,EdibleJello,2,Sun Jul 19 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of more technical commentary as well, but to be fair, the technicality of fighting games will go over the head of most viewers. I don't think the audience would be as responsive to ""Lord Jesus! D'vorah's negative frames on block are really hindering the kombo strings!"" or something.

MortalKombat,3drutg,EdibleJello,2,Sat Jul 18 21:18:35 2015 UTC,Are you making sure to extend it by pressing up up 2? Then keep holding down 2.
MortalKombat,3drutg,Kev-indeed,2,Sat Jul 18 22:54:34 2015 UTC,"That's another thing, not sure what I'm doing wrong but when I do f344 > roll > njp > b1,2,1+4 I can't do the UU2 to extend it. Not sure if this is for any reason other than I'm not doing it right or what, but I can't get it to extend unless I just do the b1,2,1+4 kombo by itself"
MortalKombat,3drutg,Kev-indeed,2,Sat Jul 18 23:00:27 2015 UTC,Ya know that took me awhile to get also. Try not extending it (up up 2) right away. What i do is wait a half second or whatever until after she does that first bite. Then up up 2 and hold 2.
MortalKombat,3drutg,Kev-indeed,2,Sun Jul 19 00:33:30 2015 UTC,I know when i do it right there is definitely a gap between doing the move and actually extending it.

MortalKombat,3dq6ih,Shlocky,10,Sat Jul 18 14:32:51 2015 UTC,I thought AvP was alright. It's definitely neither a Predator nor an Aliens film but on its own it was definitely enjoyable. AvP 2 is where they fucking jumped the shark.

MortalKombat,3dq6ih,111uhh1,6,Sat Jul 18 16:47:07 2015 UTC,Man that movie was so shitty. They all literally Jobbed out at first contact. AVP Requiem's Wolf would be the only one who got my vote from those terrible AVP movies.
MortalKombat,3dq6ih,Shatteredhawk,8,Sat Jul 18 15:01:40 2015 UTC,"While the two Predators dying like chumps was lame (well, one of them got a neat fight going against Net-Head) that movie was fun.

MortalKombat,3dq6ih,Decitronus,0,Sat Jul 18 15:13:41 2015 UTC,AVP R was horrible and I thought it was still better than the first. Fuck both those movies to be honest.

For the Berserker, I thought that if they ever are going to release a futuristic Jason X, might as well include a more advanced Predator. For the Classic, us fans all know he was more honorably cruel than the 1st Predator. He kills people that have close relationships with his prey. As for how they'll be released, I hope that he ends up free at a later date when they make another update. I feel it should be released free for people that have the Kombat Pack, which makes sense. No one wants a free skin they can't use, so might as well release it with another Klassic Skin. Please let me know which Predators you want in MKX as an alternate skin. This could give NRS a hint at what we want. :)"
MortalKombat,3dq6ih,BigJoe6996,3,Sat Jul 18 11:08:26 2015 UTC,"Classic? You mean the City Hunter from Predator 2? To be fair, the alternative color for Predator is the same shade or orange brown that the City Hunter had."

MortalKombat,3drqd6,KillingJoke04,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:19:18 2015 UTC,I don't think there's much else that they can fix. Local/offline play is fine. It's the online that isn't good and part of the reason is a near-dead playerbase which probably can't be revived at this point.

MortalKombat,3dqdwy,sushi7412,2,Sat Jul 18 13:53:29 2015 UTC,Small playerbase.   An unfortunate side-effect of the terrible launch. It took them a while to get the port in line :(

MortalKombat,3dp75k,ghostECHOsevn,8,Mon Jul 20 01:42:05 2015 UTC,I want Kano to have his Heart Rip back that'd be great. Also wish Kitana had her Kiss of Death instead of the head slice

MortalKombat,3dp75k,IlALXlI,2,Sat Jul 18 03:10:35 2015 UTC,Before the game was released I thought shinnok will have his squeeze hand as a brutality in necromancer but it didnt so there is still a chance.
MortalKombat,3dp75k,Venom44,2,Sat Jul 18 04:27:21 2015 UTC,"It seemed like such an obvious Brutality to be included for the Necromancer variation and I was really hoping for it to be included, but they went with the floor splat Brutality which is still pretty good but the DF+4 one would have been awesome."

MortalKombat,3dp75k,Scottish_Prussian,3,Sat Jul 18 07:00:26 2015 UTC,Kano's Heart-Rip fatality is as iconic as Sub Zero's Spine-Rip and Scorpion's Toasty.  I have no idea why they haven't brought that one back.
MortalKombat,3dp75k,xenorrk1,4,Sat Jul 18 11:57:18 2015 UTC,Well even though we have no more cyborgs I'd like to see Cyrax's blow up the world fatality. It's lazy but I want it back

MortalKombat,3dp75k,ChronicRedhead,2,Sat Jul 18 12:07:41 2015 UTC,"Reptile's Acid Puke. ""Tasty Meal"" might be his iconic one or whatever, but it's not as cool, and they do a much more interesting variation of it in MKX already with Acid Bath."
MortalKombat,3dp75k,TheStinkfister,2,Sat Jul 18 06:27:20 2015 UTC,"Jax's spontaneous transformation into a giant (because shut up) before he squashes his opponent flat. Particularly hilarious if it could be done with the Carl Weathers skin.  Also, Kitana's kiss of death. I was talking about this earlier today, but it's so wonderfully bizarre. I'm surprised Netherrealm opted for a simple decapitation.  Lastly, Reptile's fatality where he turns invisible before bisecting his opponent. Because it's awesome."

MortalKombat,3dp75k,Hassy_Salim,2,Sat Jul 18 21:20:31 2015 UTC,Raiden has had this fatality in a lot of games where he picks up the opponent over his head and electrocutes him until the opponent explodes into hundreds of pieces. I'd love to see that.

MortalKombat,3dn2f5,RodianFace,7,Mon Jul 20 21:10:38 2015 UTC,I love the poses they do at the end. Part of me really misses this from MKX since most of the characters don't do poses during the after the regular fatalities.

MortalKombat,3dn2f5,Dimitri1033,3,Fri Jul 17 18:48:43 2015 UTC,They look exactly like how the original fatalities looked. I think that was the intent.
MortalKombat,3dn2f5,Paublo1,2,Sat Jul 18 02:22:00 2015 UTC,I understand that. Don't get me wrong I love the fatalities. I use to have the original MK arcade machine so my heart is pure. But I was really hoping for more detail animations or camera shots to add to the gore. A little twist for the power these game engines have compared to the past.
MortalKombat,3dn2f5,Dimitri1033,3,Sat Jul 18 03:59:48 2015 UTC,"Ah okay I see. Dunno then, this was probably an executive decision that they made to make it look as close to old-school as possible."

Try his Flame fist and his dragon's fire variation. Those two are very easy and they're what most people use. His dualist variation is a little bit challenging. Its fun switching up everything but you might wanna play him the proper way in his dualist variation. Flamefist is great because you can make ridiculous extra damage and dragon's fire is great because your fire balls become very powerful when fully charged, as well as the addition to an enhanced flying kick. I hope that helps you. Sorry if its too general. :)"

You're not doing anything wrong and you should enjoy your victims being outraged they can't beat you. After all, it's not the fault of anything or anyone that someone loses except the loser.  That should be all you need.   If you're really that good of a sport, help them practice so they aren't so awful against you. That'll make it more challenging for you and hopefully everyone will have a better time."
MortalKombat,3dojca,P3irce,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:55:52 2015 UTC,"Two things, realize that if people lose to you after playing say a ft 5 it shows that they couldn't adapt and win. Even if you used the same move over and over it doesn't matter, they simply couldn't adapt. Secondly it's online play, you should take every win/ loss with a grain of salt because offline is miles better at depicting who is better"

MortalKombat,3dph7e,IlALXlI,4,Sat Jul 18 04:47:01 2015 UTC,"Imposter is ass now. Bone shaper has all the tools to be top tier. You have a safe low string with f4,1,u2. That whole string is safe except the ender. You can hit confirm into an ex scoop for 30-40% into a standing reset. Your mb scoop is armored and is a combo starter. You can use scoop as a 50/50 in the 1123 string by replacing 3 with scoop. You can do the same in the f3,1,u2 string. You have zoning in hell sparks, your scepter blast beats out most zoning (kenshi gets wrecked). Literally no reason to stay playing imposter,  it just doesn't have enough safe options and most of the moves you steal are ass."
MortalKombat,3dph7e,gankula,4,Sat Jul 18 08:47:52 2015 UTC,I like how you call it a scoop. And now I can't stop calling it a scoop.
MortalKombat,3dph7e,BoneYaBlade,0,Sat Jul 18 11:02:31 2015 UTC,You severely underestimate the practical uses for the teleport against the rest of the cast. Everything you said about Bone Shaper is true but the teleport is godlike VS gimmicks.
MortalKombat,3dph7e,Miti-Mumway,3,Sat Jul 18 16:54:14 2015 UTC,Bone Shaper.  I press buttons and hope I win.
MortalKombat,3dph7e,VerryVerrynpoika,3,Sat Jul 18 09:15:22 2015 UTC,"Imposter is awesome, gives you interesting combos with certain match ups. The steal move attack also gives you a damage buff and stuns them so you can get a free throw in. The teleport he has can make any jump into a neutral jump punch"
MortalKombat,3dph7e,vpercevic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:41:52 2015 UTC,"I play bone shaper and I use d4 to set up hell sparks. It usually catches them and if even if they block the hell sparks I can mb it to make it safe. Also, his neutral jump kick is really good for catching opponents that jump a lot. I like to use it after the f41d2, dark beam."
MortalKombat,3dph7e,BoneYaBlade,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:58:18 2015 UTC,"I only play offline but Necromancer Shinnok is my most played character.

MortalKombat,3dph7e,Ozwegian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:19 2015 UTC,"I prefer the imposter variation. I don't use it for the powers he steals. I prefer to end a combo with mimicry then i proceed to either preform a low attack, overhead, or a grab. Watch and laugh as your opponent foolishly tries to block you."
MortalKombat,3dph7e,Marktheripper,0,Sat Jul 18 12:57:48 2015 UTC,"I play Shinnok as a secondary (third?), I usually use Necromancer for zoning in the first round then switch into a combo heavy style using EX DB4 (or DF4, haven't played Shinnok in a while) as a starter for most."
MortalKombat,3dph7e,D90T,0,Sat Jul 18 06:57:00 2015 UTC,Impostor. I can't really get into Bone Shaper that much and I'm too used to Impostor. One thing I like to do that's constantly debated on is how best to convert after meter burn hell sparks. Usually I get a hit and then air tricky portal for another bounce and confirm into mimicry.

MortalKombat,3dp980,BoneYaBlade,2,Sat Jul 18 05:50:42 2015 UTC,"I've tried to play the 3v3 ranked team battles a bit, but it's usually 10 minutes of waiting to form full teams, then after the first match set someone will get annihilated and leave, thus the process begins again. I've only finished it once. It would be cool if there was some way to prevent people from leaving, but that creates its own set of problems and isn't the best idea."

MortalKombat,3dq5i4,bashy22,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:44:06 2015 UTC,You would need a converter like the XIM4.  It's $125 USD  I think that's still cheaper than a new HitBox.

MortalKombat,3do994,skeeber,5,Fri Jul 17 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"Reptile is pretty tough to use, but he's a helluva lot of fun. My advice is to not use the variation with invisibility, the other two are much better.   You need to be quick to be good with Reptile, but if you like him then go ahead and practice practice practice!"

MortalKombat,3do994,MrYuuup92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:52:06 2015 UTC,The frames for the invisibilty did seem to take a long time unless it was EXed. Just an observation from practicing
MortalKombat,3do994,MrYuuup92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:44:09 2015 UTC,"yes, the EX invis is what makes it strong."
MortalKombat,3do994,CptSupermrkt,3,Sat Jul 18 07:28:57 2015 UTC,"I think you need to take some time to learn some fundamentals of the game.  Special cancelling a combo is ridiculously easy: simply input the combo immediately followed by the special move.  That's it.  Next, don't try to learn long combos all at once.  If the combo you're studying has a lot of parts to it, just practice it one move at a time.  Master connecting the first two parts, then add in the third, and so on.  Third, just know that it's going to take practice, practice, practice.  I'm brand new to MK with this game.  My in-game practice time counter is nearly double what I've actually played in matches.  It's taken about 700 matches but I'm finally just now reaching the point of having a positive win/loss ratio.  I'd say like 75% of a victory is about knowing the matchups.  Even if you can't do more than 15% damage at a time, if you know exactly what your opponent can do and how to counter/block those things, you've still got a good chance at winning.  So, I'd suggest playing other characters to get a feel for what everyone can do.  When I bought the game, I played the traditional classic tower for everyone.  When you take a ridiculous beating, watch the replay and take note of what they did.  Use the training mode's ""record AI"" function to allow yourself to repeatedly practice against what beat you.  Finally, while, yes, the ideal answer to ""what character should I play"" is ""whatever the hell you want,"" if you're still learning fundamentals, there are, in my opinion, characters more geared toward that goal.  Scorpion and Ermac come to mind.  I've heard that Reptile is actually pretty hard to use.  If you're looking to play this game long term, I recommend switching to a noob-friendly character, getting the fundamentals down, and then take those lessons learned to your new character.  It's certainly possible to do this with Reptile, I just think you'll avoid burnout/rage quitting by using someone easier to use at first."
MortalKombat,3do994,MakeaPrinssi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:16:23 2015 UTC,"That is one problem in having is one main character. Reptile really grabbed my interest but I've yet to really Go through all the roster to see who ""clicks"". I went through practice and towers with scorpion and predator just to kind of get an idea of them after doing practice mode some."
MortalKombat,3do994,FLYBOY611,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the most important thing for newer players is to pick one character they like playing and sticking with that one character. Many players try to learn the whole cast at the same time and end up learning none of them. When you stick with one character you start learning the fundamentals of the game so much more and after you've learnt the fundamentals, then you can try other characters.   TLDR: play only one character."
MortalKombat,3do994,wraithseer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:51:01 2015 UTC,Yeah that's whats fucking me up the most is trying to find someone I really enjoy. Right now teptile and predator are the two I'm getting a kick out of more Then anyone else.
MortalKombat,3do994,FLYBOY611,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:44:29 2015 UTC,Reptile is a tough character but my advice to new players is...find who think is the coolest and then play the shit out of that one character.   Cryomancer Sub-Zero and Thundergod Raiden are quite easy to use IMO.   ANYWAY. The key thing to remember is that the combos are dialed. You can input moves before the animation for another finishes. Focus on your inputs and practice. Aim for for a consistent 20% combo and work your way up.   Remember to block and don't get discouraged. Everyone loses games. Everyone.
MortalKombat,3do994,wraithseer,2,Sat Jul 18 01:17:27 2015 UTC,Cryomancer requires quite a lot of run cancels so I wouldn't suggest that.
MortalKombat,3do994,Enex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:51:04 2015 UTC,"For the high end combos sure. But most characters need run cancels at the high level.   Cryomancer's throat slice (F122) to Absolute Zero (F421+3) spits out a respectable 29% damage. No cancelling or running required, it's one of the easiest combos I've found. Combine that with a jump in punch and you can squeeze out more.  Who would you recommend?"
MortalKombat,3do994,fuckmoneykillbitches,2,Sat Jul 18 23:34:18 2015 UTC,I'd say ferra/torr is good for teaching the basics of cancelling without having to run. A lot of ft combos rely on the 50/50s which teaches good inputs. Shame about the lack of decent AA.
MortalKombat,3do994,GreatJman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:44:55 2015 UTC,"It takes time to get the mechanics down. You have to realize that with the amount of information available and the quality of players we have in the competitive community that you're being thrown high level strats and techniques before you're ready.  Your first step is to understand the basic game. Get your basic buttons down. Know the range on your basic attacks and the frame data for them.  The next step is to get the basic combos down. I'm not talking about youtube combos. I mean combos from the move list. Again, know your spacing. Know which strings are safe on block. Know which strings have a fast enough start up and good enough range to punish your opponent when you block them or when they whiff.   NOW you're ready for youtube combos. Note- at this point, you shouldn't need to see the inputs for the combos, at all. You should be able to recognize combo strings on sight. You're going to have to learn to use the run command to link your combos.  After that step, you can start learning about frame traps, conditioning your opponent, and other more higher level concepts. That's where I am currently, so I can't help you past that.  Good luck, and remember to have fun!"

MortalKombat,3doina,Scorpionguy,16,Fri Jul 17 23:20:16 2015 UTC,His skill is incredible. Outside of that...who gives a shit.
MortalKombat,3doina,I_like_steak_,12,Sat Jul 18 00:25:10 2015 UTC,"Trust me, he has plenty of haters"
MortalKombat,3doina,Eli1028,10,Fri Jul 17 23:34:05 2015 UTC,"He has an even amount of people disliking and liking him. People dislike him for his cocky attitude (e.g. tea bagging) and others like him for his skill. Aside from that, I heard casters and friends say he is genuinely a nice guy. I enjoy watching him and his amazing plays, that is my input."
MortalKombat,3doina,OddCyrus,6,Sat Jul 18 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"Agree with you 100%, but I'm curious as to why people immediately think he's ""cocky"" for doing the tea bagging stuff. I feel like it's insanely obvious that the sole reason he's doing that is simply to fuck with the opponent and get them potentially flustered. I suppose that is ""cocky"" in a way, but I don't know, it just never struck me as ""what a douche"" since he'll always be at least in the top 8 for this game and is a genuinely nice kid."
MortalKombat,3doina,DarkPoop,3,Sat Jul 18 16:44:34 2015 UTC,"From what ive heard,he doesnt t bag with cockiness. He just loves playing the game and when he t bags hes just messing around. Like a friendly thing."
MortalKombat,3doina,cswooll,23,Sat Jul 18 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"I don't like Sonicfox. He's obnoxious. I root against him every time I watch one of his matches.  That being said, anyone who tries to say he's not one of the best MKX players out there is flat out lying. He's really fucking good at this game."
MortalKombat,3doina,wasteland13,12,Sat Jul 18 02:01:44 2015 UTC,Well yeah he's 17. But people like him because of his skill at the game and being able to pick up almost any character.
MortalKombat,3doina,Findable_Pen,12,Fri Jul 17 23:32:02 2015 UTC,I'm not denying he has skill he has plenty of talent but his attitude is kinda like the Scout from Team Fortress 2.
MortalKombat,3doina,hermitowl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:36:41 2015 UTC,"What, does he say ""Bonk"" at every hit?"

MortalKombat,3doina,_Latch_,6,Fri Jul 17 23:39:54 2015 UTC,He is a beast but he's kinda boring to watch in my opinion... i don't hate him though.
MortalKombat,3doina,BobTheGambler,2,Sat Jul 18 00:56:03 2015 UTC,"Well he is the best mk player out there and he never openly gets salty when loses. When he lost to reo tcw he laughed and hugged reo afterwards, exact same situation when he beat reo at esl finals. All the teabagging and disrepect he gives ingame is to get into the opponents head."
MortalKombat,3doina,D90T,8,Sat Jul 18 08:11:02 2015 UTC,"Heres the thing... Fighting game communities are often very full of themselves, and MKX is no exception. SonicFox really shakes things up in this regard, and that why I like him for the most part. Plus his play style is offensive and cocky, it's entertaining.  Nowhere near ""everyone"" likes him. A lot of people (including some high level players) dislike him for many reasons that aren't too important. Its usually people who only casually follow the competitive scene that are ALWAYS rooting for him."
MortalKombat,3doina,RingStinger9000,3,Sat Jul 18 05:00:30 2015 UTC,"For me it started as an in-joke with my friend and eventually I came to respect how he played, and now have become a fan of his. I like being a fan of the guy in the ""villain"" role."
MortalKombat,3doina,recurning,2,Sat Jul 18 02:03:33 2015 UTC,you my friend have never been on r/kappa if you think everyone likes sonicfox.
MortalKombat,3doina,SonicFoxmeatsquad,2,Sat Jul 18 09:16:52 2015 UTC,He's kinda awkward on camera but he seems nice and his play has no match. I haven't seen him curse in the middle of games and be agressive like pigofthehut...
MortalKombat,3doina,CadenceSona,2,Sat Jul 18 10:48:13 2015 UTC,"Because hes the best player and plays characters that no one else has the guts to play which is really inspiring for new players. Hes pretty much the reason I decided to learn ermac. His combos are so next level, along with his footsies and fundamentals. He's also a really cool guy I love when they let him on the mic hes so funny and awkward."
MortalKombat,3doina,darthrambo152,2,Sat Jul 18 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"Furries are weird as fuck, and personally I don't like him at all. But there is no denying his incredible skill at the game, he's a god"
MortalKombat,3doina,bashy22,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:30:35 2015 UTC,I dont like his personality but no one can deny that he is one of the best players in the game right now.
MortalKombat,3doina,mythozz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:31:09 2015 UTC,He's very awkward so as soon as the game is over I have to stop watching him cause he makes me feel awkward lol. But it is fun to watch him play (those 50% Kitana combos in ESL I had not ever seen before).
MortalKombat,3doina,AnvExploitz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:28:45 2015 UTC,"He's really not. He's young, I mean honestly he's just a kid having the time of his life. He's a really nice kid all the teabagging and everything else is in good fun and the people who actually play him know that"
MortalKombat,3doina,Derpy_Bird,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:58:55 2015 UTC,Hes like any kid gamer who achieved greatness when they were young He let it get to his head because hes a pro injustice and MK player.  If you look at a different game an franchise in dota 2 theirs a 15 year old( sumail)  whos in the second best team in the world ( eg) currently with the same problems. It just comes with being famous in a any scene sadly at a young age
MortalKombat,3doina,AoE2manatarms,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:39:44 2015 UTC,Because he's good. I like watching him. He seems a little weird though.

MortalKombat,3doina,StalkerCelly,0,Sat Jul 18 13:41:16 2015 UTC,Its because sonic fox is the best mortal kombat player ever. Not only that but hes still a 17 year old kid prodigy. He plays low tier characters in every game. These people who hate on him like OP are just jealous that he can do things that they will never be able to do. Everyones always so salty about him winning they start bandwagoning to nerf his already mediocre characters.

MortalKombat,3dmzr7,rome3228,7,Fri Jul 17 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"I think what happened was this: you both did your special at the same time. He EXed his and did it as a reversal, so while your shatter was still in the startup frames, his move went through your clone (first hit) and then hit you (second hit). Since you were hit, the clone went away, but the shatter animation had already started. However, before the shards actually hit him, the game checked that technically the clone was no longer there and so the shards did no damage.  Just one more bug to add to the long list of clone bugs..."
MortalKombat,3dmzr7,Aremah,5,Fri Jul 17 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"Looks like you got hit before Kenshi so the hitbox on the shatter disappeared. Same thing happens when I throw Ferra, if torr get's hit while Ferra is still in the air then Ferra loses her hitbox and won't trade"

MortalKombat,3dp6kp,NackJines,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:39:03 2015 UTC,"Even with release check OFF you still need to make sure you dont press db too quickly or the game will register it as you trying to do db+2 since you pressed 2 before.

MortalKombat,3dn037,cswooll,9,Sat Jul 18 15:48:31 2015 UTC,hello sir it is me your brother
MortalKombat,3dn037,b_riann,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:31 2015 UTC,"No jaqui can go away. Either makeba new design,or kill her off. Also,doble stun?"
MortalKombat,3dn037,LonelyGoats,-4,Sat Jul 18 22:12:47 2015 UTC,"I want to see Jacqui in Jax skin, having moustache and stuff, obviously no t-shirt  edit: wow the moustache haters"
MortalKombat,3dn037,sidewalkbutts,6,Fri Jul 17 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"I think maybe I'm in the minority here but I honestly really don't like the ""new generation"" outside of maybe Cassie.  The others are all so forgettable so it makes me think they probably won't make it to the next game.    While Erron, Kotal, and Ferra/Torr are cool as well, I don't see them continuing either.  Even though I love the characters, as odd as that seems, they strike me as being a one-time occurence with maybe cameos in future games.  I think D'Vorah stands a good shot at coming back since she was one of the main characters in MKX.  All that being said, as biased as I may be (see user icon), I don't think Kano will be MIA just yet.  Under the assumption they introduce his son (which is never mentioned outside of his tower ending, so I'm doubtful) I think they'd include Kano in the next game as well, as a medium for introducing the kid.    That's how they did it in this game at least, and it makes it a bit cleaner.  Nevertheless, I also wouldn't be too shocked if they left him out all together since among the original kombatants, Kano is easily the one most shat on in terms of attention, haha.  Who knows, I hope he stays though, maybe they'll do a prequel game and have him along with other characters missing this game that fans have been begging for. I wouldn't mind Shang Tsung again, he's hilarious."
MortalKombat,3dn037,LonelyGoats,9,Fri Jul 17 17:33:33 2015 UTC,"Kotal will undoubtedly be returning. Hugely popular, a lot focus in the comics and game and probably the best design of all the new characters.  ""Lord or thief, all will fall"""

MortalKombat,3dn037,b_riann,5,Fri Jul 17 20:35:44 2015 UTC,PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO CREDIBLE THREATS
MortalKombat,3dn037,cswooll,2,Fri Jul 17 21:06:57 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't be against this, I really love his design, it's very interesting with regards to both visuals and backstory."
MortalKombat,3dn037,SubNizzo,2,Sat Jul 18 00:55:45 2015 UTC,"It's because all of the older crew steals the spotlight in story mode. Kill Sonya, Johnny, Jax and we have problem solved. More spotlight and story for new gen. They are all noobs in MKX storywise, they are just bunch of kids trying to make a special team and failing a bit on their way to glory. In next game they might be pushed beyond limits to protect Earth/invade Outworld, because they are only few of the special forces left."
MortalKombat,3dn037,FeltMountain,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"For me at least that's not their problem.  I didn't like Johnny/Sonya/Jax better, it's just that Takeda/Kung Jin/Jacqui all kind of had that same boring personality/attitude.    You know, the whole trying to prove themselves, cliche, almost obnoxiously inexperienced style.  None of them really stood out.  Cassie is a little bit different since she's the leader and mirrors the most observable qualities of her parents to some degree.  I dunno, what you proposed could happen, but I can't see that being a very interesting next step for the storyline. Kinda too predictable."
MortalKombat,3dn037,TrustMeImLeifEricson,2,Sat Jul 18 01:00:02 2015 UTC,"Takeda is pretty damn cool imo. Jaqui is lame,though that one concept set with the sword would of been badass. Kung jin,well,hes just an asshole."
MortalKombat,3dn037,hermitowl,5,Sat Jul 18 22:15:41 2015 UTC,Jax needs to go if Jacqui will stay
MortalKombat,3dn037,woodkidmt,2,Fri Jul 17 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think all of the new characters are terrible, except for maybe Cassie and Kotal Kahn. So, with that in mind, I can see them scrapping Shao Khan (which they did) and Johnny (Cassie seems more like him than Sonya, but I'm biased).  My undying hatred of Scorpion and Liu Kang would also like to see them removed (especially since Takeda is very much like Scorpion), but I'm sure blood will be spilled if they are, so I'll deal with them staying in."
MortalKombat,3dn037,katzey,4,Sat Jul 18 00:16:52 2015 UTC,"yeah man, scorp and subby are saint so we don't touch them here"
MortalKombat,3dn037,ChainSol2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:59:36 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I think this is going to be the last game where most of the characters from MK's old guard will be playable. The ""passing the torch"" theme was too strong in MKX to be dropped in the next one, barring something drastic like slaughtering the Kombat Kids in the first 10 minuets of MK11. However, I don't want to see the old crew killed off or completely absent from a new game; regulating them to NPC roles in story mode would be a better way to handle them.   Personally, I'd rather keep the old guard than move on with the newer characters. If NRS decided to scrap all the characters that were introduced in MKX, the only ones I'd miss are Erron and Cassie, and I'd be concerned for the story if Kotal was a one-hit wonder. Don't get me wrong, I do like most of the new characters, but they just can't compete with the affinity that ~20 years of familiarity with the old crew breeds, and there's the fact that the replacement characters don't really play like their predecessors. Takeda isn't a poor man's Scorpion, Cassie doesn't feel like Johnny or Sonya, etc. This is a good thing for MKX, as all characters should be unique, but  I would want to see more similarity in gameplay if the kids actually take their forebears' spots in the roster. But, I'd be shocked if  this is how the chips will ultimately fall.  As for the original question--sorry OP, I'd choose Scorpion for the chopping block.*  Or possibly Sub-Zero. While I love both of them, they haven't had meaningful storylines since MK3. All we've seen from them for the last 15 years have been ""Scorpion seeks revenge!"" or ""Sub-Zero becomes Grandmaster of the Lin Kuei!"" plots and it has worn extremely thin (Scorpion did get a table scrap of a plotline in Deception, but it was dropped and forgotten about in short order). Please do something new with them, NRS. That, and the series just needs a reprieve from Scorpion in general. I don't actually want to kill either one though.  *Warning: NSFW audio in that link."
MortalKombat,3dn037,Scream26,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:57:53 2015 UTC,"I know about Scorpion and SUb-Zero, seems like all their cards have been played by now, but we must admit that there is no chance in hell they will be removed because they are their trademark staples. Maybe they create something together like a new clan or something. And let's be honest, they are too badass to be removed and we all love that spear and iceball.  But regarding new gen characters. It's been first game for them, their first appearance. I wasn't really all over johnny or jax for the first 2-3 MKs. They just grow on you with time. That's exactly what needs to happen with Takeda and the crew. They are new, people must get used to them, now we need to give them one more or two games to develop and we have new cast of champions. Seriously I might be biased, but I love everything about Takeda, the whips, the scorpion affiliation, cocky character. We just need to give them time  to develop and wait for them to get more minutes on the court in the story so they can surprise us with something awesome."
MortalKombat,3dn037,GreatJman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:20:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Rage Against the Machine!! That's my jam!  As for the Scorpion and Subby dilemma... the fact of them being the mascots of Mortal Kombat makes them automatically exempted of being chopped off. It would be just like MK3 all over again, if you think about it. However, I agree that they should have something new, story-wise. But if you ask me, things are looking pleasant in that regard, with Scorpion finally settling the REVENGE FOR MY FAMILY AND CLAN plotline with Quan Chi. As for Sub-Zero, we'll see how the Lin Kuei business goes."

MortalKombat,3dn037,Papa_Chucklefish,14,Fri Jul 17 18:18:26 2015 UTC,yeah but ermacs play style is soooo cool and unique and fun to play   don't think you could really give any other characters all of ermacs kit and have it seem right
MortalKombat,3dn037,MotherDean,4,Fri Jul 17 18:57:10 2015 UTC,No not reptile :(
MortalKombat,3dn037,MotherDean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want to kill off any of the old cast; the nostalgia factor is just too good. That being said, I wouldn't mind seeing NRS taking a step back from Liu Kang (although story mode implies he'll be a major player in the next game) and Johnny Cage. They're probably my least favorites.  As for the new generation, I REALLY wouldn't mind never seeing Takeda, Kung Jin, Jacqui, and D'vorah again. They don't do anything for me. Sorry, guys!"
MortalKombat,3dox3s,rafikiknowsdeway1,3,Sat Jul 18 01:31:37 2015 UTC,"F1 is 8 frames.  D1 is 9 frames.  D3 is 7 frames.  D4 is 8 frames.  Predator has poke tools. F12 can hit confirm into an exBF4 to do a big punish, or if they block you can do F12 into U2 and it'll make it from -7 to -3 on block. Or, if you're Hish-Qu-Ten, you can do DB3 and do a close ground plasma to hit them with a safe low."
MortalKombat,3dox3s,YimYimYimi,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:06 2015 UTC,"I'd say use pokes, armor (BF4ex is a good one), or try to get in a throw. Then just concentrate on footies and keep-away."
MortalKombat,3dox3s,EointheGUY,2,Sat Jul 18 02:08:16 2015 UTC,"armor is good, but i can't even get out a poke. i should try throwing more though, see how that goes. even if they tech it i can try to back dash away if i'm not locked in the corner"
MortalKombat,3dox3s,NackJines,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:13:29 2015 UTC,Doesn't pred have one of the fastest d3's in the game? It's like 7 frames iirc.
MortalKombat,3dmev1,Samwellpeeps,24,Fri Jul 17 13:26:42 2015 UTC,A no brainer well needed and long over due buff for Erron Black is  Hat in all variations!!!!
MortalKombat,3dmev1,FearlessMadman,6,Fri Jul 17 18:51:28 2015 UTC,If anything the useless variation with the hat shouldn't have it and the rest should :D
MortalKombat,3dmev1,Lo0pyy,23,Fri Jul 17 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"I'd give kotal the ability to teleport into his sun rays. I think it'd give him some more options against zoners while still needing a setup to work, and he can clearly teleport anyway according to story mode"
MortalKombat,3dmev1,cozzburger,5,Fri Jul 17 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"This is genius, especially if it dissipates the sun beam for balance reasons"
MortalKombat,3dmev1,PooGod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:27:59 2015 UTC,"I like this but dont think the sun ray is necissary, just give it some start up like all of his other moves."
MortalKombat,3dmev1,TheIronMoose,3,Sat Jul 18 02:58:37 2015 UTC,"Give Ferra Torr a new normal, Up 1, where Ferra stabs upward like her D1 to anti air people that WONT EVER STOP JUMPING IN AND DOING CROSSOVERS ALL DAY"

MortalKombat,3dmev1,zombierapture,3,Sat Jul 18 06:04:15 2015 UTC,"I just want Kenshi's MK9 F2, 2, B1 string"
MortalKombat,3dmev1,Nathorus86,3,Fri Jul 17 23:21:14 2015 UTC,"He can't do this? I don't play him at all and have been wondering why Takeda players don't throw that shit at me while jumping back...guess I know why now. I am surprised that he can't do this as air projectiles are not rare in this game.   I just wish Jax had his air throw in all variations. As a Jax and Guile main...I want my air throws but I can't play Wrestler worth a fart online. Also, why does Jax only drop the greatest line in Wrestler and Heavy Weapons?   'You think you're bad...' six shots to the gut later '...you ain't bad.' To me that taunt works BEST in Pumped Up and it doesn't happen."
MortalKombat,3dmev1,dickwhiskeydrunk,3,Fri Jul 17 13:56:48 2015 UTC,I wish they would remove the timer on ancestral kung jins arrows. Thats literally all he needs and all three variations would be viable. Not saying ancestral isnt good but if he had that he would be complete.
MortalKombat,3dmev1,darthrambo152,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:46:27 2015 UTC,I could see arrow count instead of time.
MortalKombat,3dmev1,TheIronMoose,3,Sat Jul 18 03:07:49 2015 UTC,"Theres a count and a timed window right now, if they would just drop the timer and keep the arrow amounts the same it would be perfect."
MortalKombat,3dmev1,darthrambo152,2,Sat Jul 18 05:11:33 2015 UTC,I agree. I figure 1 for stun 3 for fire and 3 for vamp.
MortalKombat,3dmev1,TheIronMoose,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:45:39 2015 UTC,"I know the stun and fire counts are right, but i havent played around with it enough to remember the vamp ones."
MortalKombat,3dmev1,darthrambo152,2,Sat Jul 18 12:57:04 2015 UTC,"As much as I love JC, I can't think of a buff that wouldn't make him OP...maybe a slight damage buff on certain specials/strings? Like flip kick for example, so that way Fisticuffs and A-List get slightly better damage, and Stunt Double is left alone (because it already has really good damage).  But what I'd really like to see is a few buffs for Cryomancer Sub-Zero. Make the air ice hammer a little faster, and make it an overhead to low 2 hit move (as of now, the move is pretty worthless IMO). Also, make F421+2 (the ice dagger grab string) slightly more advantageous on hit, so that Sub can vortex easier."
MortalKombat,3dmev1,mrKrucifix,2,Fri Jul 17 14:07:14 2015 UTC,Fisticuffs doesnt need more damage since the variation revolves around chip damage
MortalKombat,3dmev1,cswooll,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:41:40 2015 UTC,Valid point. But that's what I mean. I don't think Johnny really needs anything. I like where he is ATM.
MortalKombat,3dmev1,mrKrucifix,2,Sat Jul 18 02:04:45 2015 UTC,Jacqui's 233 make the low kick in the combo a low instead of a mid because it looks like it should be a low.
MortalKombat,3dmev1,ItzgeorgeTaylor,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"Reptile's Acid Puddle becomes it's own special, because Erron can throw Caltrops for free!  Predator's Snag and Smart Disc make up their minds if they want to stay or cancel on block, because it's confusing."
MortalKombat,3dmev1,SighAgain,2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"I'd make Johnny Cage's forward 4, 3 be able to combo into his Shadow Kick. It's just a useless string at the moment."
MortalKombat,3dmev1,armon24,2,Fri Jul 17 17:48:19 2015 UTC,Give Mileena a faster overhead.
MortalKombat,3dmev1,Lo0pyy,2,Fri Jul 17 21:50:02 2015 UTC,Give Warrior Predator a few extra combos to make a maskless Predator more viable. (Do the same for Gunslinger Erron Black aswell).
MortalKombat,3dmev1,BRN99,2,Fri Jul 17 21:59:16 2015 UTC,"Suggested nerf: all teleports cost a fourth of stamina, like a short run cancel.   Kotal could use a teleport like lake mist. Similar slow startup always teleports behind enemy.   Or  Put a hit of armor on ex disk for kotal, bg and or sun god.   Remove the first level of grab counters for sun god so soul scorch becomes useful.  Or make the grab stacks increase the damage on sunbeam and disk.   Liu: ex db2 gets an additional launching hit uppercut."
MortalKombat,3dmev1,TheIronMoose,5,Sat Jul 18 03:06:59 2015 UTC,I'd give scorpion he's old 214 back and nerf he's stamina instead.

MortalKombat,3dmev1,Ninetayls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"Gunslinger eb: have the ability to 2in1 cancel all of the standoff attacks. Standoff 3 into bf 4 before the last shot. Or standoff 4 into moneyshot after the second shot. It would make the shit useful, a mixup, and relatively safe.   Another example, say you try to zone with standoff 4, they jump over , on response go into standoff 2 for the aa."

MortalKombat,3dmev1,SubNizzo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:07:21 2015 UTC,I dont see the point of that? Just to make it so in online conditions you dont get punished?
MortalKombat,3dmev1,darthrambo152,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:27:26 2015 UTC,the point of it is that the opponent shouldn't get 2 seconds to respond.scorpion's teleport isn't safe online or offline
MortalKombat,3dmev1,SubNizzo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"Sometimes under really laggy conditions, scorpion's teleport can be safe. Whats the difference between it being half a second and two seconds you will still get punished by everything unless the person is a rookie and just doesnt know they can punish it and hold block for a second too long. Dont get me wrong it would be nice, i would accept the buff no questions asked, but its not necessary or needed."

MortalKombat,3dja9s,anotherbrainstew,33,Fri Jul 17 18:51:07 2015 UTC,I thought Scorpion was in all of the MK games as well. I see from the list he missed out in MK3.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,MayoManMayo,8,Thu Jul 16 18:51:23 2015 UTC,It appears he was left out to speed production so they could meet the game's deadline. That's why they added him in UMK3.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Kekoa_ok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:29 2015 UTC,But wasn't Smokes secret alternative basically Scorpion?
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Have_A_Jelly_Baby,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:34:20 2015 UTC,You couldn't play Human Smoke until UMK3.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,caffeinefreedom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:44:57 2015 UTC,And Human Smoke was WAY better than Scorpion. 2 pop up combos allowed for way more damage.  Faster walking speed as well. Human Smoke's BnB (bread and butter) combo did more damage than Scorpion's biggest mid-screen punisher in UMK3
MortalKombat,3dja9s,HMPoweredMan,47,Fri Jul 17 13:24:23 2015 UTC,MK3 was garbage. That's why UMK3 exists.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,mtndewgood,28,Thu Jul 16 19:27:40 2015 UTC,Disagree.. Still had fun playing MK3 in the arcade. Long live the cyber initiative.

MortalKombat,3dja9s,swordoath,4,Fri Jul 17 01:03:58 2015 UTC,"There were no ""ninjas"" in vanilla MK3. Sub-Zero got his maskless redesign in that game. When you fight Noob Saibot during the secret fight, it's actually a recolored Kano."

MortalKombat,3dja9s,Joe_Ballbag,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:05:53 2015 UTC,Yep. Although in UMK3 Noob Saibot was a recoloured ninja.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,swordoath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:43:29 2015 UTC,"Even more interesting, in MK Trilogy on the PS1, they gave his sprite an extra color depth layer so that there were actual visible details on it, instead of how he was just flat black previously."
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Harperlarp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:54:44 2015 UTC,When I was a kid me and my friends were convinced Cyrax was Scorpion because of him being yellow and the net was too similar to the spear.  We didn't a have access to lore and shit back then.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Doktoren,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:47:35 2015 UTC,I could see why.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,SS_Bison,7,Fri Jul 17 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"Some stuff in MK3 was pretty bogus, but then some of the stuff in UMK3 was pretty bogus, too.  I remember the old Kabal combo in MK3 was spin dash, ground saw, run in LK,LK, HP, HP, D+HP, JK, air fireball. Did a ton of damage.  Then they decided that wasn't fair and completely neutered the saw until it was useless. You MIGHT get lucky and catch someone unexpecting with it, but the start up is slow, it travels slow, and if Kabal is hit he gets knocked out of it.  Then SZ had that crap where he could ice clone right on top of you so you couldn't move. That actually was kind of busted. AND STRYKER DIDN'T HAVE THE GUN!  I forget what else. I haven't played Vanilla MK3 in a really long time."
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Torentsu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:50:36 2015 UTC,I agree that Kabal's sawblade was made useless but Kabal fared pretty well in the upgrade without it. 90% of the UMK3 competitive community considers him to be the top tier character in the game.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,caffeinefreedom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:32:55 2015 UTC,"90% Who says otherwise?  Human Smoke is #2 all day, but he's still second fiddle to kabal.  I've been playing UMK3 at a high level for 2 years now. (testyourmight and youtube searches for tehdrewsus...)  I'm a human smoke main, I've just been seriously playing Kabal for the past month, and he's already ridiculous.  mrigotbass was nicknamed ""ghetto kabal"".  Mine's been named ""suburban kabal"".  49% anti-air punisher, 59% is easy off a deep jump kick.  Damage protection is canceled after the spin animation stops and the opponent starts to fall out of the air.  In MK3, Robot smoke didn't have a hit limit on his spear.  you could literally infinite CPU opponents with it.  just had to stick a quick jab in between spears.  I'll put up a video later to demo this.  If you played the SNES version, playing as smoke defaulted the game to a difficulty harder than Very Hard, regardless of the selected difficulty in the options menu.    EDIT: http://youtu.be/tmbtwPBBoYY  here's a quick video on how ridiculous robot smoke was in MK3"
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Torentsu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:32:56 2015 UTC,Ok so its probably 100% but I don't follow that community too much . I do remember hearing teleporters such as Human Smoke could give Kabal some trouble at very high play so I assume there is someone out there who will argue all day for Human Smoke.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,caffeinefreedom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"It's a very good matchup, almost 50/50.  But Kabal also has a lot of advantages over non-teleporters that keeps him #1.  scouting/baiting a spin vs kabal leads to 50% for human smoke and ermac.  BUT, baiting a teleport leads to 49% for Kabal."
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Kekoa_ok,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:18:21 2015 UTC,I just wish it was part of the MK collection
MortalKombat,3dja9s,TurkCLE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:33:03 2015 UTC,"I'm always surprised at how popular all the versions of MK3 are. I disliked every one of them. There was just something so shitty and half-assed feeling about them. For example, I really hated the fatalities where people would get cut in half but the lower arms would still be frozen in mid air and the legs would just freeze frame. So dumb. Even all the way back in MK1 they had great animations for bodies falling over after decapitations and such."
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Euphorium,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:10:18 2015 UTC,"I have a soft spot for the gameplay in UMK3. It's probably not the best, but it is to me on nostalgia alone."

Every 2D MK game has an extremely predictable AI.  Kabal is far and away #1 on the tier list for UMK3.  So many options, 49% EASY on an anti-air punisher (42 if you're a total scrub and can't cancel HP into a spin), Instant air fireballs, 3 frame startup on his spin, ridiculous throw range and priority... yeah.  Kabal is still awesome."
MortalKombat,3dja9s,caffeinefreedom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:40:44 2015 UTC,"No, UMK3 exists because MK3  was a rush job to get some part of the game out the door.

MortalKombat,3dja9s,caffeinefreedom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:57:46 2015 UTC,Not true.  MK3 was a rush job to get the game to the public.  If you beat the game you'll see a message in the arcade about more kombat coming in 1995.  UMK3 was planned before MK3 even hit the arcades.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Harperlarp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:26:50 2015 UTC,"I liked Mk3, got it for my 11th (I think) birthday. By your logic UMK3 sucked, that's why the MK Trilogy exists."

MortalKombat,3dja9s,Harperlarp,2,Fri Jul 17 13:49:48 2015 UTC,MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3. A better version with more characters.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,HMPoweredMan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:23:48 2015 UTC,No. MKT was a buggy compilation with some bonus characters and was console only which never made it to the arcade.
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Harperlarp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:32 2015 UTC,"Ah I get it now. People played UMK3 in the arcades. Living in England (but not in a major city) the only time I ever got play an arcade machine as a kid was when the fair was in town. And even then, we were lucky to get MK1, and at £1 a go (which usually lasted no more than a couple of minutes) we didn't get to play on it all that much.  And so I keep forgetting about later MK games being released in the arcades."
MortalKombat,3dja9s,ShadOath,4,Fri Jul 17 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"MK3 Omitted scorpion because they wanted the focus to be on the Cyber Ninjas and possibly Sub-Zero's ""storyline"" of being hunted by the Lin Kuei.

MortalKombat,3dja9s,totaldrk62,2,Fri Jul 17 13:49:25 2015 UTC,I kind of want this now.   This needs to be ported and available in the PlayStation Store and Xbox's
MortalKombat,3dja9s,caffeinefreedom,2,Fri Jul 17 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"I had it when I was around 13 I think on the PS1. Loved it. Had no one to play it with mind. But I'm pretty sure it had all the characters in the franchise up to that point. Including a playable Noob Saibot (my introduction to him), Rain's first appearance, and even various kostumes for some characters.  With Kano you could play as the MK1 or MK3 versions. Kung Lao MK2 or 3, Raiden (or Rayden back then) as MK1 or MK2 and some others too. The old versions were updated with kombos and shit.  MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3, simply a better version with more characters. This is why I'm always confused when people express love for UMK3 like it's the best version of the klassic MK games."
MortalKombat,3dja9s,totaldrk62,0,Fri Jul 17 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"Wow...I'll never be mad that Noob wasn't in this game again. They left Scorpion, arguably the greatest videogame character of all time out of MK3? Crazy cause I don't remember being mad about that at all..."

MortalKombat,3dja9s,Crudechunk,0,Thu Jul 16 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"Counting UMK3 and MK3 as separate installments of the series isn't fair.   That would be like saying every Street Fighter installment is a separate game, but we don't. There's Street Fighter, Street Fighter 2 (Hyper, Super) Alpha (1-3), 3 (1, second impact, third strike) and 4 (+ Super, Arcade Edition, and Ultra) - all of which have additional characters and gameplay elements added to them. Then we can also consider spinoffs as separate installments to the series (Like Street Fighter EX).   But by that logic, there has only been one character that's been in every street fighter after the first one (which isn't even really a street fighter game) - and that's ryu. But that isn't fair, because Ken is added in during a later installment to 3 along with chun li who are now part of 'every street fighter' (after 1, which once again isn't really a street fighter game).   So we don't count things like that.  You want to say ""every MK game' you have got to combine UMK3 with MK3, UMK3 is just MK3 + other things, it isn't a separate installment to the series."
MortalKombat,3dja9s,Abraveliltoaster,0,Fri Jul 17 10:25:07 2015 UTC,"I think if they're just different versions of the games that play differently enough, they count as different games. The older ones will always be there and people will prefer one version to another. MK3 and UMK3 have enough game-changers to be considered separate.   Also, isn't it a little silly to not consider the first Street Fighter as part of the series but combine different versions of a game as one as if any new addition is superior?"

MortalKombat,3dopa9,ShizzleStorm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:35:35 2015 UTC,I actually think next patch will be better. Cus i mean you gotta think. A whole new company taking over a shit port trying to fix it. A port that they didnt do. They did a good job at the sf port. So i think well get there
MortalKombat,3dopa9,cswooll,2,Sat Jul 18 22:17:51 2015 UTC,Heard rumors about a man giving birth to an alien
MortalKombat,3dopa9,Elfinary_,2,Sat Jul 18 02:38:00 2015 UTC,"The community is broken, can't fix that. It could be that the matchmaking is bad in general, but finding an opponent can take ages because the playerbase isn't that active. Aside from that, my only issue is the ridiculously long startup. I gave in and upgraded my GTX 465 to an R9 280 and that fixed my fps issues.  The rumor started with some half-assed detective work involving Qloc (the supposed new team) and Steam. No one has a definitive answer to all that yet.  Anyways, saying the game is ""broken"" now is too vague. You just have to try it out yourself. A number of people still complain about fps issues but they also don't always list their specs so never know if they're running some incredibly old hardware."
MortalKombat,3dopa9,Won_Doe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:18:01 2015 UTC,I love how patching a game is a rumor now
MortalKombat,3dopa9,Too_Flashy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"For me, the FPS is fine. I have a GTX 770. Game runs smoothly for single player. The online experience? Well, bar signals aren't always accurate. I've played red bars that are less laggy than some green. I get a few dropped connections (I don't think I've ever been in a game where a player has physically pulled their Ethernet cord. Who has time for that?). Pretty sure all the dropped connections was due to latency issues. The least laggy game has very minimal input lag, but the lag-gy games I've learned how to play without dropping most of my combos. You just have to input like you would if there was no lag. Most of the matches are pretty laggy."
MortalKombat,3dopa9,mabbagi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:55:03 2015 UTC,Alright guys thanks for the heads up on the game. I'm going to go ahead and let my friends know we might wanna give it another shot and see what is up with it. Thanks for the responses!

MortalKombat,3djcib,TheIronMoose,2,Thu Jul 16 19:57:54 2015 UTC,(MILD STORY SPOILERS)  Too bad he spends the whole story as a Revenant. I would've liked to hear his attitude outside of character intros.
MortalKombat,3djjui,wrightosaur,20,Thu Jul 16 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"This happens in every game unfortunately. People that have no idea what actual footsies, reads, and set play look like even when they are staring right at it just assume it's the character doing the work.  In street fighter it took a full YEAR for people to stop wanting Rose nerfs. It even fooled two of the best American players who tried and failed to pick up Rose after Luffy's EVO win last year."
MortalKombat,3djjui,wisdom_and_frivolity,4,Thu Jul 16 20:03:11 2015 UTC,What's set play?
MortalKombat,3djjui,JasonHanson,4,Fri Jul 17 01:12:56 2015 UTC,Set play (sometimes setplay) is when you plan out your attack pattern. Usually after a combo when you know the opponent will be in hitstun or knocked down for X number of frames. You can use that time when you know exactly what is going to happen to pre-plan a course of action and practice that course of action in training mode. Sonicfox's set play is most apparent when he gets someone in the corner with erron black. He sets up caltrops and then performs a set of actions beyond combos that try to extend the time the opponent has to be on those caltrops.
MortalKombat,3djjui,wisdom_and_frivolity,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:18:49 2015 UTC,Pre planned set up practiced heavily and used when certain conditions are met.   Best way I can describe it is in Street Fighter after a hard knockdown Akuma goes for a demon flip and makes a super ambiguous set up that works on your character and usually leads into a vortex.
MortalKombat,3djjui,Untitledprject,0,Fri Jul 17 08:44:45 2015 UTC,They nerf every character ZeRo plays in Smash 4.
MortalKombat,3djjui,MayoManMayo,9,Fri Jul 17 03:18:00 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's been explained that the falcon changes had nothing to do with zero, and the diddy nerfs were deserved because he dominated the game ever since it came out. It just happened that diddy and falcon both got changed after a tournament where zero played them both and he whined that sakurai specifically looked at his play and decided to nerf them both, which is just not true."
MortalKombat,3djjui,Im_French,-3,Fri Jul 17 03:21:53 2015 UTC,"My comment is still true whether or not they did it because of ZeRo, and honestly I can see some Sheik nerfs in the near future..."
MortalKombat,3djjui,MayoManMayo,15,Fri Jul 17 10:23:38 2015 UTC,"I loved when people cried for Erron nerfs. My response has been the same since day one, ""who else other than Reo and Fox play Erron at that high of a level""?  Fox really is just the epitome of a fighting game specialist. I mean he even placed high in a Dead or Alive tourney and that's miles different than an NRS FG"
MortalKombat,3djjui,Hype_Magnet,5,Thu Jul 16 20:49:09 2015 UTC,People in ESL chat still cry for Erron nerfs when he plays him.
MortalKombat,3djjui,Derpy_Bird,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:15:18 2015 UTC,"Other than like Kung Lao and Kung Jin, I feel like you could say ""who else but [2 top players] play [character] at a high level?"" for just about any character. With the level of character diversity still going on, and the fact that most top 8's have been the usual suspects, its seems dumb to base opinions on representation as opposed to a character's potential."
MortalKombat,3djjui,thafredator,2,Fri Jul 17 07:48:12 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean but I have never seen another high level Erron besides Reo and Fox.   There is quite a few of Jin, Lao, Sonya, Shinnok, Sub Zero, Tanya, Jax even some Cassie's."
MortalKombat,3djjui,Hype_Magnet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"Sonya, cassie, jin, lao, and to a lesser extent dvorah, jax, and now shinnok; all played by way more people than erron black."
MortalKombat,3djjui,wisdom_and_frivolity,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:22:26 2015 UTC,Yeah only sonicfox can play erron black at such a high level. No one else can seem to grasp the technicalities or master the amount of skill it takes to hit his combos. Also sonicfox outplays everyone with any character he just likes erron black.
MortalKombat,3djjui,Ninjakinryu,13,Fri Jul 17 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"It's worth mentioning that he used Erron Black in ESL versus Pig of the Hut's Kenshi when the set was 1-1.  But yeah, the characters aren't OP.. Sonicfox is just the truth.  No reason to nerf Kitana."
MortalKombat,3djjui,sticky_fangerz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"Because the matchup was horrible for Kitana vs Kenshi.  That's why I think he switched out to EB after struggling with Kitana, which is actually pretty obvious when he sweeps Pig's Kenshi in 2 rounds immediately after."
MortalKombat,3djjui,sticky_fangerz,10,Thu Jul 16 20:57:40 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, just figured it was worth mentioning that he didn't win every match with Kitana alone."
MortalKombat,3djjui,TheIronMoose,2,Thu Jul 16 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"Really pig needs a pocket character with some rushdown. I know he loves some kenshi, he loved sinestro too. But he did alot better in tourney when he picked up zod."
MortalKombat,3djjui,ty13r_Durden,8,Fri Jul 17 06:09:42 2015 UTC,"But it's our bitching that buffed kitana to a good character in the first place , and nobody to my knowledge is asking for a kitana nerf , I have't seen it anywhere"
MortalKombat,3djjui,Seel007,0,Thu Jul 16 21:22:15 2015 UTC,Mostly SRK and that joke of a forums for NEOGAF
MortalKombat,3djjui,ty13r_Durden,2,Thu Jul 16 21:37:44 2015 UTC,Where on SRK are people calling for Kitana nerfs?  Maybe on testyourmight(people whine about everything) by SRK rarely discusses MKX balance.
MortalKombat,3djjui,SwagMountains,2,Thu Jul 16 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"OP just likes to argue against imaginary people I guess ..... Kitana doesn't need a nerf , and nobody is asking for one ..... chill OP"
MortalKombat,3djjui,thafredator,7,Fri Jul 17 09:21:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair, she was considered one of the weakest characters until she received major buffs recently. We don't really know how strong kitana is, much like predator"
MortalKombat,3djjui,TheIronMoose,5,Thu Jul 16 20:58:18 2015 UTC,"People complained about Tanya because REO and MIT were also picking Tanya. Thats not just sonic fox. As far as ermac, who sonic fox wasn't even on the forefront of, I really don't remember people crying for nerfs other than spectral, which probably would've still been a bad variation if they left the meterbuild glitch alone."
MortalKombat,3djjui,Izzy_Leveled_Up,3,Thu Jul 16 22:09:54 2015 UTC,I think everybody knew tanya needed to get nerfed as soon as she came out. All three variations get outta pressure free and have beter mobility than the whole cast.
MortalKombat,3djjui,mrgilla,2,Fri Jul 17 06:12:04 2015 UTC,Sucks that I use both Erron and Kitana. I just hope he stays away from Reptile.
MortalKombat,3djjui,leo730,2,Thu Jul 16 23:30:20 2015 UTC,"Kitana was considered low tier before SF won esl with her, which is why I pay no attention to those ""tier lists"", it just goes to show that any character can whoop serious ass."
MortalKombat,3djjui,afterthefire1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:08:08 2015 UTC,Same here. Been a Kitana main since day 1. I actually do decent against high level players with her. I know a lot of it is due to the fact that they paid no attention to her so they don't know how to defend against her. I suspect they will now after SF's win with her.
MortalKombat,3djjui,leo730,4,Sun Jul 19 13:14:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP.  I don't think people realize just how much skill it takes to compete on the level that these guys do. It's all Fox, man. His fundamentals, ability to read and his understanding of match ups are unparalleled.   He pulled out a 50% combo in the corner at one point. I challenge people to pull that off in practice, let alone during a tournament with 60 grand on the line."
MortalKombat,3djjui,megustaba,-2,Thu Jul 16 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"The combos for Kitana are so hard to time and so hard to execute.  Every character has their fair share of 40 - 60% combos, but the execution is always different for each, with Kitana's being one of the hardest."
MortalKombat,3djjui,TheIronMoose,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:58 2015 UTC,"Not at all. That's one of her biggest draws... her ability to execute damaging combos easily. I mean, you can connect three fans and it does over 25% damage and is unbreakable to boot. Kitana is however very difficult to play at higher levels. This is because she lacks mixups. Kitana is only effective if you have really good strategies. The combos are easy."
MortalKombat,3djjui,Archi257__,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:07:16 2015 UTC,any video of the kitana gameplay?

MortalKombat,3djjui,MrMaxAwesome,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:36:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly nrs has been doing a pretty solid job of knowing what to nerf and what to buff. Personally i would prefer more buffs rather than,them going nerf happy. People are going to beg for nerfs nomatter who wins. Ebs throw needed a nerf. I dont think they really changed much else.   Honestly lao pred and tanya are the only ones I see that really need some sort of nerf. But even then i have no idea what to do to lao, tanyas teles got a bit nerfed so that helps, and preds hqt laser prolly needs some adjusting. Hunter needs buffs though.   The more fun question to me is who and what buffs would bring the lesser variations and characters to tournament viability."
MortalKombat,3djjui,110010101101000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:07:44 2015 UTC,Predator hunter needs buff ? U probably didn't seen how sonicfox play with him. 55 % from grab mid screen.
MortalKombat,3djjui,nodq,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:16:03 2015 UTC,Preds damage needs adjusting in all variations. However just because he has a 55 combo desnt necissarily mean he needs a nerf.
MortalKombat,3djjui,xastey_,-3,Fri Jul 17 16:24:14 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck are scrubs really trying to nerf Kitana? Fuck this community, fucking crying over anything, get everything nerfed cause they can't be bothered to learn the match up, and fuck NRS for listening to them handing out nerfs like stickers. I bet they're too busy making another Scorpion skin to actually bother see what's actually broken rather then listen to knee jerk reaction scrubs"

MortalKombat,3djjui,saitamasimple,0,Fri Jul 17 03:09:42 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with the MKX community rather than this generation of gamers. The kids today want everything instantly and without doing something for it. They blame other things and charakters and unbalance for their incompetence and losing. They cry for nerfs just because they think it's gonna benefit their own needs. Today's gamer generation are just a bunch of crybabys and what I like to call them MOBA gaming generation. MOBAGG.

I don't have much time to play either, but what I do is study guides and YouTube videos and TYM on my commute, that way when I get home and do practice I've got concrete stuff to try and master, not just randomly practicing."
MortalKombat,3dlroz,CptSupermrkt,2,Fri Jul 17 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"If your friend is beating you consistently, chances are very high that he knows exactly what you need to work on. You could ask him (probably not after losing another match, because that'll be salty).  It's hard to give advice without seeing you play. Do you have any videos? Black is overall a strong character, but he leans toward the high end on execution. That's why you see top tier players doing really well with him (SonicFox, REO) in tournaments but not many other people. Just something to think about."
MortalKombat,3dlroz,Enex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:30:22 2015 UTC,I wish I knew how to make videos lol but yeah I'm pretty good with Erron but I must admit every couple of time I try to pull off a combo I'll drop it at some point and that gets frustrating and then I'll drop it more often. I do my best to try and emulate sonic fox combos but I obviously can't keep the pressure up as well as he can
MortalKombat,3dlroz,ghostECHOsevn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"I'm the oldest of four boys who grew up on ancient console fighters. And the one thing that always kept me winning against my younger brothers (even when they actually starting getting better) was always watching for patterns in what THEY did. Typically people will keep going back to the same thing if its worked for them in the past.  I suspect your friend knows this and he's probably reacting to your favorite couple of combos, set-ups, reactions, whatver. My advice is to develope a few back up characters of your own and show him something new."
MortalKombat,3dlroz,Killit_Witfya,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:59:55 2015 UTC,Yeah that's exactly what he does. He knows me really well.

MortalKombat,3di7sr,Hansalel,7,Thu Jul 16 18:54:57 2015 UTC,Yup. Just not completely invisible. Ex is disappear and faster recovery.

MortalKombat,3di7sr,Dreckerr,11,Thu Jul 16 16:52:28 2015 UTC,"It does make it harder to see what you're doing, use it to lay traps if hunter/ hit that low kick, or if you have enough space, its way harder to react to his bf4 when he's invisible, I've caught people with a lot of those just straight.  It's just good for mixups and mindgames though, its not like reptiles where you can just wail."

MortalKombat,3di7sr,Muddaawsome,4,Thu Jul 16 17:18:36 2015 UTC,"Very useful, the lowered chip, it makes your mixups harder to anticipate and block."
MortalKombat,3di7sr,corylegend,2,Thu Jul 16 17:29:15 2015 UTC,I like doing his 212 combo and then doing the invis as they are getting up.
MortalKombat,3dlffp,RedRift,7,Fri Jul 17 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, a few things you can do.   Practice your combos more. Especially from the side you're having difficulty landing them on. It's the only way to erase that problem. Grind it out a number of times until you can perform comfortably from either side. Mix up your options more. Use B2 xx Kunai, or B22, or B33, or throw more often. Change up how you start your pressure, and make sure you have combos that you can go into if you manage to get a hit. You know the range at which you want to be as Takeda. So, one thing you should work on is finding safe options that keep your opponent at that range. They walk forward, you walk backward. They jump in, you use D2. They try to use armor to get in (SubZero Slide, Erron Black Slide, etc), block and punish, or counter with armor of your own. This is basic concept of footsies. There's plenty of reading material on the subject, as well as videos. This particular video helped me a ton with it. The game in example is Street Fighter, but Footsies are prevalent in practically all fighting games.. One thing a lot of new players do in common is underestimate the power of patience and blocking. Wake up blocking is a perfectly viable option most of the time, and you'd be surprised how much stuff you end up punishing by being patient at the right time. This also goes into footsie territory. Be patient, and if you're knocked down or cornered, it's ok to block. Just be mindful of when your opportunity to poke back (D1, D3, D4) Or to armor reveals itself, and capitalize.  Watch high level play of your character. Arturo Sanchez and Zyphox both have pretty good Takedas. Here's an Art match. Take special attention to what he's doing, and when he's doing it. How does he react to advancing pressure? What does he do on wake up? Think critically about what you're watching, compare it to your gameplay, practice what you see the best you can, and imitate the high level play to the best of your ability. Then, after every loss, evaluate yourself. ""Why did I get hit by that?"" ""What can I do next time to prevent that from happening?"", etc.   If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Best of luck bud."
MortalKombat,3dlffp,mrKrucifix,3,Fri Jul 17 06:02:48 2015 UTC,"Testyourmight.com  (best website for MKX, multiple pro players post here) find your character + variation, learn combos and the games basics. you might lose your friends if you babality them too hard though, be careful."
MortalKombat,3dlffp,CreationandControl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:02:02 2015 UTC,"my only real advice is watch streams of pro player(or maybe good twitch streamers) that play takeda and combo guides(you find them on youtube as bnb videos or some sort of wired ad kind of video with 1 min intro to 3-4 35-40% combos). I suggest playing more then one champion and playing in practice mode as much as u can. In my opinion takeda is really predictable, but in the hands of someone who can master him, he can be really deadly(he was top 8 at evo i think). With time and practice u will get better:)"
MortalKombat,3dlffp,darthciupy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:57:22 2015 UTC,I was in the same boat when I first got MKX. I had absolutely zero experience with fighting games. At first I couldn't seem to do anything else but button mash. But one day I just sat down and chose a character I liked and just practiced. Practicing combos is probably the most important part. Learn to string together your combos so that you can keep juggling your opponent for as long as you can. You can also look up combos with your character on the Internet and there will be plenty of sites and videos that will tell you exactly how to do them. If you can learn your characters combos well enough eventually you'll be able to watch other people play as him and be able to know which combos they are using which is also a big help. I'm not very good at explaining things haha but my best advice is to go to practice mode and learn his combos

As for the match up, I would say to play more defensively than aggressively. Most online Scorps will hang themselves in match because of overused teleports and b32f2 strings. Honestly, I think the best way to play an annoying Scorpion is just to sit and punish over and over.  edit: You can't really just sit and wait while playing against hellfire though, considering that he does have hellfire :/. But at least he does lose the inferno high/low mix-up full screen."

MortalKombat,3dkpnw,cozzburger,0,Fri Jul 17 05:17:25 2015 UTC,"All ya really need against a lagfire scrubpion is a block and a couple uppercuts. You will usually take about half their life in uppercuts before they start to learn, if they dont rinse and repeat.

Problem with h unter is that you are prolly gonna have to give up hope on the self destruct unless you jave some sort of mid combo setup."

MortalKombat,3di7j7,TonyVilla89,2,Thu Jul 16 16:09:10 2015 UTC,Yes. Quite.
MortalKombat,3di7j7,knightfallzx2,3,Thu Jul 16 18:37:47 2015 UTC,Interesting.
MortalKombat,3djr1f,rodrikes,6,Thu Jul 16 20:52:06 2015 UTC,"(Yes, I use a controller because I'm used to it   Barely anyone uses a stick. It has no real purpose in MKX unless it's just what you prefer.  Your goal should be not to get caught in these combos. Know how they start and when, and avoid the opening move."
MortalKombat,3djr1f,Derelium,5,Thu Jul 16 22:45:59 2015 UTC,"So combo's are part of the game at a high level, if you use two meters you can break a combo by holding block and forward. You can learn combos yourself, you can also learn how to block strings from different characters that result in high damage combos. The %win rate accounts for how many games each of you have played, as well as w/l. To be honest, games can end in 3-4 touches at a high level, you sort of just need to accept that haha. Good luck though, test your might has many threads dedicated to helping new players learn combo's and footsies. Check them out :)"
MortalKombat,3djr1f,SwagMountains,2,Thu Jul 16 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly dude, most characters have 30-40 bnb combos with a bar, so getting hit three times is all it takes sometimes. The biggest advice I could give would be to keep at it. Learn your character's movement, how to space out correctly based on your game plan, and don't throw out unsafe moves. It's a lot harder to convert random hits into 30+% than it is to full combo punish someone who throws out a really unsafe move. You also want to hit practice and figure out your own damaging combos. Not getting opened up to a big combo in the first place is just going to take a combination of playing against people more, and going to the lab to figure out what characters try to do and what your options are to deal with it."
MortalKombat,3djr1f,NackJines,2,Thu Jul 16 21:13:20 2015 UTC,"even though this doesn't exactly answer your post, keeping your composure during long combos is essential to success in this game   dudes like Kotal can put you into movie mode real quick, and real easily, but its SO IMPORTANT you stay focused and keep cool.   you may want to stay offline and just practice until you can nail your own ~30% combos with ease, because you'll simply be outclassed without proper BnBs. you'll need to play x5 times better than your opponent if all you can do is some two three hit 20% combos, and there is absolutely zero pride in that."
MortalKombat,3djr1f,katzey,2,Fri Jul 17 00:58:28 2015 UTC,"The general advice I would give is learn to play footsies and know how to block. Generally most people will try to set up their Bread and Butter (BnB) combos off the same string (usually a launcher, if they have it), so be on the look out for that string. If it's not safe on block, blow it up once or twice and they'll be gunshy in using it.  That's the basics. If you let your opponent walk up and do whatever they want without repercussion, then you're going to eat BnBs all day long. When you get past that stage, then it becomes more about footsies and capitalizing off what hits you can get.  Example- Liu Kang has a launcher string 113 that sets up a nice juggle combo. But if you're good, you'll never get hit by a raw 113 because it's completely blockable on reaction, and you can reversal before the 3 comes out (some characters don't even need armor).   When you get to the point where your opponent pays for trying to pull a raw 113 on you, congratulations. You've just leveled up."
MortalKombat,3djr1f,Enex,2,Fri Jul 17 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"quick tip:  if you manage to knock them down, stand outside of sweep distance and block just before wakeup. A lot of online players love waking up with armor and to go into their combo. Depending on the character, you might have to block high/low, but thats an easy adjustment. You wont get blown up by armor, you wont get blown up by cheesy wakeup x-rays. Now...if your opponent wakeups and doesnt press buttons, then he's a more solid player and this online tactic wont work.   Everyone on r/MortalKombat has beaten a 500-win Mileena who could only start a combo with EX Roll or EX teleport . You just sit there, block, and punish her to death."

MortalKombat,3djr1f,Ninjakinryu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"Find some player matches with someone on a similar level to you and run a couple long sets(10 to 20 or more matches) to get a feel for moving around.   Pick a first main, and spend some time in practice getting comfy with a combo that does about 30 percent.   Then you get to start learning how to block and punish. Alot of moves arent safe. What that means is that if you block them or they miss you you can attack for free and hopefully do some good damage.   Learn about your character(protip: ask here) and what their gameplan is. For example if you play kotal he isnt much of a pressure character because his combos are,short with few mixups, he is more of a setup and whiff punish character, meaning he has good range that rewards waiting for the opponent to miss or make a mistake and make them pay for it.   Kung lao is the opposate of that. Pressure pressure pressure till something lands."

MortalKombat,3dgt6t,TheIronMoose,2,Thu Jul 16 06:38:30 2015 UTC,They buffed his dambladge output recently.
MortalKombat,3dgt6t,kecleons,2,Thu Jul 16 06:58:21 2015 UTC,"And now dambladge is how I'm going to say that word lol.  I was disappointed to find out that Reptile's slide doesn't go under projectiles. Sub-Zero has always been my main you see, and I'm used to being able to close distance when the enemy uses projectiles.  Just googled Reptil buffs and found this comment:  ""Lol, I just checked the notes. He got NERFED if anything. Nerf to his nimble combos due to 4 having lower damage, buff to his absolutely pointless strings that no one uses. The only buff that matters is overhead doing 2 more damage but that doesn't affect him a lot exactly. Wow.""  Can you confirm?"
MortalKombat,3dgt6t,Lorenz0o,3,Thu Jul 16 07:07:21 2015 UTC,"They buffed the hotboxes on a lot of his moves to allow for more combos though, now he can do his classic MK9 combo (F421xxBF2, NJP, 21, F421xxBF4) because they buffed the hitbox on his Neutral jump punch and his F42 and his 21 strings. He can also connect 34 and B1D2 into fast forceballs for no meter. So he got lots of more meterless combo potential. Especially in Noxious"
MortalKombat,3dgt6t,dd1zzle,2,Thu Jul 16 16:03:18 2015 UTC,Cant confirm as i dont play him but right after the patch there were a couple of threads talking about how he was killing a bit faster. He still has to work harder than most of the cast but it sounded like he got more mileage.

I know teleport characters are bad on Reptile because he hates the spacing, but patience goes along way.  As for punishments, I really recommended Reptile's b3 (which is a low that can lead into kombo) and his f412 (which leads into an overhead and can go into a kombo).  My strategy with Reptile is to stick my opponent into the corner, and keep them there with f412 and b34 mix-ups. It takes practice, but it's very rewarding to corner trap with Reptile."

MortalKombat,3dk6p2,DontUseThat,4,Thu Jul 16 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"You can't really balance a custom character.  The only way to do that is to have literally every single move be ""equal"", which doesn't make very fun gameplay.    Custom characters kind of go against what competitive fighting games are about anyways, learning matchups, learning opponents combos and when to block high/low, how to read certain players, etc."

MortalKombat,3dk6p2,GeneralGoosey,8,Thu Jul 16 23:26:32 2015 UTC,"This would be a balancing nightmare. Normally I'm all in favour of adding new features, even if I myself wouldn't use them, but I think this would be a bad thing for the game in general.  Sadly, it's not just a matter of tech, and any system that would impose balance such as, say, a points system or banning certain prohibitively overpowered move combinations would create a largely ad hoc system that would require constant updating as new meta strategies emerge. This would distract from the other things in the game.  Also, I'm not sure we need it. With variations and a rather large roster (not to mention that MK generally has fewer clone characters than many other fighters), there's a LOT of variety already. So I think the problem you say it'd solve doesn't really exist. Hell, once people work out the most powerful kustom kharacter options, we'd just get those guys being spammed all the time.  Also, knowing your opponent's kombatant's moveset and how to counter it is part of the game, it's part of the skillset, and I think removing that aspect of the skill ceiling is one that would do no-one any good.  The only ways I can see this working is if you are allowed some customisation (even if it's just purely visual, like SSB4's Mii fighters) but you can't venture outside specific character types. Otherwise, online play would lose a LOT of its enjoyability for those of us that don't play with the kustom kharacters, and I'd rather an option to opt-out of games where I can be paired against a kustom fighter, and that'd just reduce the pool of online opponents."
MortalKombat,3dk6p2,GeneralGoosey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"I see your point. Ow hear mine if you will,     Just because someone finds a op move set dose not mean that it would work for everyone, for example, just because I am good with smoke's move set doesn't mean I'll be good with anyone else's, it's all about the player and ther style, any fighter can beat any fighter, no matter the move set they have, you can beat smoke with anyone if you know how to use them, hell, it's possible to use only one basic move and beat the best combo fighter in the world by simple blocks and dodges.    It's not the move set that is dangerous, it's the plAyers, not the game."
MortalKombat,3dk6p2,offensivepenguin,4,Fri Jul 17 01:56:03 2015 UTC,"That fails to address that you will still have extremely overpowered fighters in contention. Yes, there is a MASSIVE amount of skill involved, but part of that skill in fighting games has always been recognising character counters, matchups, and the like."
MortalKombat,3dk6p2,CrazyKrogan,5,Fri Jul 17 06:16:38 2015 UTC,They should add custom arenas (with stage interactions)

MortalKombat,3dk6p2,lelianadelrey,5,Fri Jul 17 01:49:04 2015 UTC,It they ever brought back the ability to kreate a fighter it would probably be more like soul caliber 4 and 5 where you just customize the characters aesthetic but they use the same moveset as one of the characters already in the game.
MortalKombat,3dk6p2,SanjiSasuke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:14:21 2015 UTC,I'd be okay with that as long as it said which character you took the moveset from

MortalKombat,3dk6p2,SanjiSasuke,3,Fri Jul 17 05:54:16 2015 UTC,"There is not a single other fighting game that does this, and it is for a good reason. The time and effort to make a game that is balanced using solely this custom fighter and no other features would be just too much, forget trying to make a decent MK 11 along the way. Just imagine if you could pluck the overhead from one good mix-up character and hand it to Kenshi. Tiny, difference, and now he is massively overpowered.   Then think of the much more severe cases like a character with Jax's Rocket, a teleport, Full Auto Gun, Ice Clone and Goro Stomp.  The only thing I can think MAY work is copy-catting Soul Calibur or Tekken in that you may only use premade movesets with custom appearance.  Unfortunately KAF is just broken. Thankfully Armageddon was broken, too, so we got it once, so just appreciate it there, I'd say."

MortalKombat,3dgreu,wasteland13,3,Thu Jul 16 05:07:38 2015 UTC,"Craziest, reachiest idea: Dio Brando.  WB produces JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and the character practically exists to be in fighting games. Not to mention his incarnations over the last decade could make for three great variations:   Dio Brando (space ripper stingy eyes, freezing punches) DIO (The World, knives for projectiles) Diego Brando (Scary Monster)   It'll never happen, but it's quite entertaining to think about. It'd certainly be the wildest guest fighter in any fighting game.  Less crazy but still extremely unlikely: the T-800 or Ash Williams.  Most likely character (that I personally want): Bo Rai Cho."
MortalKombat,3dgreu,ChronicRedhead,2,Thu Jul 16 10:27:17 2015 UTC,"Really, seeing any Jojo characters do Fatalities would be fucking great.  As for Dio, I think his three variations would be way too complex, and they'd essentially need completely different character models.  I think Jojo characters who could have the three variations fairly well would be:  Hol Horse, one variation by himself (zoning), one with J. Geil (traps) and one with Boingo (grabs?).  Pucci, for obvious reasons (although having to have Whitesnake, C-Moon and Made in Heaven be at the same power level would really fuck over canon)  Gyro, one with just the Steel Balls (zoning?), one with Scan (traps?) and one with Ball Breaker (rushdown?)."

There are 3 types of inputs for these moves, Back, Neutral and Forward.   Back allows means towards yourself (away from the enemy) Neutral means you don't touch a direction Forward means away from yourself (towards the enemy)   In this case if you were near the right side corner but the enemy was actually in the corner, you would hold it to the left after the ability starts casting."

Projectiles ""spam"" (zoning) is a legit high level play strategy since ever(low level too, like offensive players there's good and bad zoners), and you need to think alot to do it (if you think they are just doing spam you obvious dont know 80% of the game mechanics). This strategy was more effective in SFIV, some characters in marvelvscapcom, skullgirls and mk9/injustice, we finally can get a style variation instead of full rushdown 50/50's like it was before the buffs."

MortalKombat,3dlgq0,Captaincastle,-1,Fri Jul 17 06:29:03 2015 UTC,Please elaborate sir.  Im pretty sure Goro is worse then any other character you could list.
MortalKombat,3dlgq0,PrancingTrex,5,Fri Jul 17 06:32:23 2015 UTC,"Why is Kotal Kahn on this list of garbage tier characters? He's fine, he's more like a mid-tier character."
MortalKombat,3dlgq0,PrancingTrex,-1,Fri Jul 17 06:37:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if I mentioned a specific variation, I mean only that variation.  Sun God Kotal Kahn basically gets 1 move, because Soul Scorch is currently worthless, its just so bad its not even funny.  War God Kotahl is fine, don't know about the totem one though.  Unbreakable Sub Zero because its so bad , shield can't block jumping attacks.  Basically I list a variation if its so bad it puts you at a disadvantage (basically no reason to pick over the other variations)."
MortalKombat,3dlgq0,PrancingTrex,5,Fri Jul 17 06:40:27 2015 UTC,"Alright let's go down your list.  1) Spamming projectiles: You can just look at wasteland13's response because it does a good job at explaining that. Also recovery on projectiles would slow down the pace of the match.  2) Garbage tier Characters: Read wasteland13's response. Btw, I agree with Goro being garbage.  3) Variation 'issues': Variations allow the character to be played differently. For example, Sun God Kotal Kahn is now more focused on tech throws and stuff like that and Tanya's Dagger stuff allows her to be more aggressive.  I hope this helped!  EDIT: Look at lostwin1 response for more on ""spamming"""
MortalKombat,3dlgq0,PrancingTrex,2,Fri Jul 17 06:59:01 2015 UTC,"Also you're right on Unbreakable Sub being bad. But really? Your reason for saying Sun God Kotal is bad is that Soul Scorch is ""...just so bad its not even funny."" At least explain why you think that! And if you did you'd be wrong, Soul Scorch can be pretty useful at times. For example when you want a sizable life lead on your opponent.  TL;DR: Variations allow you to spice up your favourite character with a new wway to play him or her."
MortalKombat,3dlgq0,xolare,0,Fri Jul 17 07:19:01 2015 UTC,"Because using Soul Scorch, which gives like one third a bar of meter at level 3 resets your command throw to level 1 , thats why its never worth it.  Also the EX grab is useless once you get the command grab to level 3, so why is it even there?"
MortalKombat,3dlgq0,Captaincastle,2,Fri Jul 17 08:38:22 2015 UTC,"Just EX Soul Scorch and then you get health back and the EX grab allows you to amour through attacks. So yeah, that's why it's there. Btw did you even read my response fully? Because I explain your problem with Soul Scorch and variations."

You have to be good with execution and execution alone does not win you games. Yes, you can pull a 44% combo out of an ass with excellent execution. Because pressing buttons in succession quickly is execution, that's what good mechanical input is in this context, being able to turn your thoughts and calculations into actions in a video game.

MortalKombat,3dip3f,Lukeweizer,8,Thu Jul 16 16:17:02 2015 UTC,Cassie Cage I think is the best. Her spacing is incredible because her B1 has so much range and leads into full combo.
MortalKombat,3dip3f,Hype_Magnet,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"Kung Jin has great normals for footsies has mediocre space with his dive kick and long range overhead and low normal starters.

Then there's Shinnok who does more or less everything you asked for incredibly well, especially in bone-shaper."

MortalKombat,3dip3f,Middus_or_feedus,2,Thu Jul 16 16:58:07 2015 UTC,Yeah Kano's really good as that especially in Cyber with the mid-knives but I think cut-throat has the better normals so thats worth a look at as well.
MortalKombat,3dip3f,grassisalwayspurpler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:28 2015 UTC,"Characters to loo into that are all about space control and reading your opponent's movements: Kenshi, Takeda, Ferra/Torr, Kano, Shinnok, Kotal, Kitana. I can elaborate on specific strengths/weaknesses to each. space control character's don't really play like Fei Long on this game though they are much more about keeping them out due to the run mechanic"
MortalKombat,3dip3f,grassisalwayspurpler,2,Thu Jul 16 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured I'd be opening a can of worms trying to relate an SF character to MK. Just wanted to give people an idea of a playstyle.   Kitana is someone that has popped in my head before. She seems to have good strings that move her forward (good for footsies). Not to mentions throwing fans and square jump for controlling space.   Judging by your icon, you're a Ferra/Torr player? How do deal with the seemingly limited move set? I found myself sticking with 111 a lot. Recently started trying to get in the habit of doing 11 xx Ferra Bowl or 11 xx Ferra Toss depending if my opponent is ducking or blocking high. I generally do like the character and should probably spend more time with them to get more familiar."
MortalKombat,3dip3f,grassisalwayspurpler,2,Thu Jul 16 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean their limited moveset when Ferra is off Torrs back?It was definitely the hardest part of the character to grasp early on it really just takes time to get used to and get comfortable with, they certainly aren't an easy character to learn. Using the all three Ferra Tosses (you definitely want to start with Vicious) is where your main space control tools come in. If you think they are going to sprint in stop them with boss toss, if they jump then go Ferra toss at the right range or a neutral jump punch (people tend to stop jumping after getting smacked out of the air into full combo at half screen), if the are going to hesitate and bait the other tosses that's when you go bowl girl.   Also keep in mind that when Ferra is not on your back, there is no access to armor moves, any overheads, or command grab, so the options you have are low (F2), normal throw, or pokes. When Ferra isn't on your back though you get the D1 from Lackey which is insanely good, 6 frame start up and incredible reach so keep them in check with that and D4 (plus 2 on block, plus 20 on hit) until Ferra returns.   In terms of creating pressure, the main go to string I use is B121 cancelled into the overhead toss for very good meterbuilding and chip damage. The fact that Vicious doesn't need meter to combo means they can save meter for armor, MB throws for mix up attempts, or breakers which is one of their best strengths. now that you are plus though keep in mind you can't go straight into a mix up since you can't go overhead. The guessing game here is go for a frame trap with the Lackey D1, bait an armored reversal, or check them with a low F2 or throw, or go straight back into B121xxFra toss for more meter and chip. Hitting someone with the D1 when Ferra is on your back is plus 20 so it gives you a free mix up attempt overhead (B23 2+4) or low (F2.) F32 is a safe (-3) advancing mid to mid and on hit gives good corner carry too. The first hit, F3, is also an extremely good tick throw into the command grab on block.   If you get knocked down Ferra actually doesn't need to be on your back to wake up with armor (wake up command grab or BF3 if they jump to bait the grab). But anytime someone leaves you standing like Cryomancer Subs shank string or Jax's gotcha grab then there's no access to armor regardless.   I can go into specifics if you have more questions but that's the basics."
MortalKombat,3dip3f,BoneYaBlade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"This is awesome information. Thanks a lot for enlightening me.   What do you typically use as a punish? Something like B121 xx Ferra Throw or F2, 4 xx Boss Toss? I'm looking at frame data on Shoryuken Wiki and their fastest moves seem to be 1, B1 and D3 (can't remember D3 can be cancelled into specials). Something I don't quite understand is the different frame data for single buttons compared the strings that start with them. Let's take your B1 for example. It says B1 is 10 frames on startup. But it says B121 is 21 frames on startup. Do I only need to worry about the B1's 10 frame startup to punish since that's the first move that comes?"
MortalKombat,3dip3f,Derpy_Bird,2,Thu Jul 16 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah start up only refers to the first hit of the string in terms of punishing. So B121xxboss toss is a punish for moves -11 or more. Stand 2 is their fastest punish though because D3 can be cancelled into specials but doesnt combo. 2xxBoss toss is their punish unfortuneately, but if they do a reallly negative move then go F2, F3, 4xxBoss toss"

MortalKombat,3dgdli,antsinmyeyesjohnson8,15,Thu Jul 16 01:39:59 2015 UTC,Grandmaster by a mile. Great pressure. The clones can be really annoying to deal with.
MortalKombat,3dgdli,wasteland13,2,Thu Jul 16 01:43:48 2015 UTC,Sweet. Are the clones better than the ice barrier move unbreakable gets?
MortalKombat,3dgdli,wasteland13,5,Thu Jul 16 01:54:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The ice clones are what make Grandmaster good. They can be used defensively similar to the barrier, but they can also be thrown to add zoning pressure and if you get them trapped in the corner with an ice clone out it's really hard to escape.  Check out some of Tom Brady's matches to see some good Grandmaster Sub-Zero stuff."
MortalKombat,3dgdli,Kandarr,4,Thu Jul 16 02:13:18 2015 UTC,Ice barrier is awful. It has bad recovery frames and any character can jump in and break it. It just doesn't block jump ins and no one knows why.
MortalKombat,3dgdli,asiangun,3,Thu Jul 16 04:21:17 2015 UTC,"Cryomancer is the best imo. He's not great at zoning, but at rushing he is the best."
MortalKombat,3dgdli,Saiyaman,4,Thu Jul 16 07:33:15 2015 UTC,"Grandmaster, but Unbreakable is really underrated but underpowered. The ice shield is capable of blocking armored attacks, unlike ice klone. Also, you can use it when trapped against the wall, unlike ice klone to turn the tide immediately. And wakeups are easily punished with the shield.  Ice Aura prevents chip damage and the EX version does that and reduces damage. It's best for a super defensive playstyle. Specifically against rushdown characters."
MortalKombat,3dgdli,NackJines,5,Thu Jul 16 03:24:38 2015 UTC,"I wish that good defensive play was rewarded more, unfortunately unbreakable has the lowest damage output of his variations. Using the parry is super risky against good players and I wish there was more reward for making a good read."
MortalKombat,3dgdli,DARKSTARPOWNYOUALL,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:22:30 2015 UTC,"Which one is it? Underrated or underpowered?  Regardless, this is pretty off. Ice Aura is usually worse against Rushdown characters who usually have 50/50s making it extremely risky blocking. There is some exceptions, Aura is great vs Kung Lao and Johnny Cage n shit, but for the most part... You don't want to be relying on it vs Sonya or Raiden  If anything the reduced damage allows you to be more aggressive and rushdown."
MortalKombat,3dgdli,furious_pillow02,2,Thu Jul 16 05:09:45 2015 UTC,"Heyo.  Haven't played GM, but Unbreakable is actually a very solid defensive option.  Ice Aura makes everyone with gigantic block strings laughable (looking at you Kung Lao), and the EX Ice Aura also gives a 30% damage reduction to all incoming damage.  Sure, Unbreakable doesn't have the damage output, but he can bring his opponent down to his level with properly used EX Ice Auras.  Also, he gains the Ice Shield, which is the best parry in the game, as it parries both highs and lows, and gives you about 25% per parry.    GM is a very solid middle ground, as far as I understand it.  His pressure up close is his real strength, though, as an Ice Klone right in your opponent's face really doesn't allow him to projectile it down, and it lets Sub use any of his tools, such as his B2 overhead, BF4 slide low, or run up and grab into the Ice Klone.  This grab will freeze the opponent and, as long as you fast wakeup, you can combo off of that, as well.  This makes GM's corner pressure very good.  Ice Klone is also a decent tool at range to deal with projectile spam, and can be thrown for good damage and respectable chip.  It really depends on the playstyle you're looking for, though."
MortalKombat,3dgdli,A_Change_of_Seasons,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:09:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like Unbreakable can be faster than Grandmaster. See someone teleport/about to teleport? You can just BoF and freeze them. Perfect for those teleport-happy Ermacs and Scorpions. With GM you gotta be in front of the ice clone to use it like that which takes a lot more time.  Clones seem really safe, until you find someone that can shoot through it or teleport behind it. Unbreakable is a better choice against these, no?"
MortalKombat,3dgdli,MrSuperBacon,-4,Fri Jul 17 05:22:41 2015 UTC,"Grandmaster because the Unbreakable ice mask looks dumb. Really though, I prefer Grandmaster more because I'm not too good at playing defensively."

MortalKombat,3dgju3,Nightwing73,3,Fri Jul 17 01:41:56 2015 UTC,in warriors' variation the enchanced pounce thing pops them up and you can mix it in with a few strings.
MortalKombat,3dgju3,ALilParasite,3,Thu Jul 16 06:10:00 2015 UTC,Pounce actually doesn't combo with most of his strings and is fairly easy to react to.

MortalKombat,3dg2z4,Ursax,4,Thu Jul 16 00:20:30 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but people who don't pay attention will pay for the Kombat Pack thinking it's cheaper than buying all 4 separate... but it's actually more expensive due to the skin packs."
MortalKombat,3dg2z4,xenorrk1,3,Thu Jul 16 02:48:39 2015 UTC,I think they announced the full kombat pack because they chose which secret characters they wanted to be in the game and they were already making them. I don't know about injustice.
MortalKombat,3dg2z4,randomaccountforme1,3,Thu Jul 16 00:15:46 2015 UTC,"They revealed the full line up of the Kombat Pack because the characters were leaking. If the leak hadn't happened, they would have announced them one at a time, like they did with characters in MKX."
MortalKombat,3dg2z4,darth_infamous,2,Thu Jul 16 00:33:07 2015 UTC,Probably because there's gonna be way more dlc in mkx

But, I was mildly annoyed by some choices in the Injustice pack. Zod just seemed like such an annoying attempt to popularize based on Man of Steel. And Scorpion, while okay, was just sort of not what I wanted/expected. I ended up happy anyway. Still, a little disappointing at times."

MortalKombat,3dh4u6,CookieCreamLord,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:23:32 2015 UTC,In Soul Calibur don't you just pick one of the other characters' full fighting styles though? I don't really think that would work with MK. People would want to be able to pick their own special moves.
MortalKombat,3dh4u6,wasteland13,3,Thu Jul 16 07:27:15 2015 UTC,That's a fair point. Which makes me sad.
MortalKombat,3dh4u6,wasteland13,4,Thu Jul 16 07:13:18 2015 UTC,Honestly I think the best way they could do it would be in Shaolin Monks style spinoff game. Do it like a Dragon Age Origins type thing where they can pick what faction they start off with and go through the MK Universe as a brand new created character.
MortalKombat,3dh4u6,wasteland13,2,Thu Jul 16 07:16:16 2015 UTC,"That would be amazing! I'm an amateur at fighting games, but I love MK's lore. I would buy that game in a heartbeat!"

Either block and approach or as he is not armoring it just run up and pressure his wakeup. From what I saw you just love to wake up with glow kick meterless/ get in with glow kick meterless, this isn't a good habit and could have been punished by better players. You also resort to turtle blocking Kung lao's zoning options, normal hat it high thus neutral duck and only block low hat, besides that it have projectiles as cage use them. Also you should learn a consistent combo to punish instead on doing a string that does low damage and sends full screen. Your corner game is bad, you didn't punish properly, you rely to much on glow kick, d4-nutpunch is not a combo, i think just because this kung Lao wasn't the best doesn't mean you can come looking for confirmation of your own skill. Instead of ""wasn't this guy I beat bad"" try to instead ask ""I had a hard time dealing with x is there a y option I can do to deal with it"""

Get into the habit of running. As soon as he hits the ground, run straight back in and keep in their face - don't give them any space. Also, when you encounter someone who jumps or teleports a lot - it can easily be fixed with a good uppercut. Quick and damaging."

MortalKombat,3dhhwb,Gunnerbeu,6,Thu Jul 16 08:56:36 2015 UTC,"Im not one to give advice, but you weren't much better. His xray was easy to block and he used it ASAP. I can see him getting you once or twice, but if he gets you every time he wakes up you're doing something wrong. That glow kick you were doing hurt you. He was doing a good job zoning you while you did that. Instead of blocking low from range, throw some forceballs.   And you should've learned to stop blocking low on the teleport. The jumping all over the place gave him some easy hits. Lastly, the ex glowkicks were pretty wasteful to gain space when you didnt connect most of the time."

MortalKombat,3dfyo0,cswooll,3,Thu Jul 16 07:06:40 2015 UTC,"using f212 in a juggle would make the combo a lot harder than it needs to be. substitute the f212xxbf4 with runxx122xxbf4, runxx4xxbf4 or j3xxbf2xxRCxx4xxbf4  to answer your question though, the height you njp doesn't affect the bounce, and as soon as your feet hit the ground you can start your combo."
MortalKombat,3dfyo0,cozzburger,3,Thu Jul 16 00:31:21 2015 UTC,It's too slow and hard to land to be practical IMO. If you are not wanting to do a run combo you could try to b22 instead.

MortalKombat,3dfl2p,Ruby_Sauce,4,Wed Jul 15 21:51:35 2015 UTC,"Most of Takeda's normals are incredibly slow.   As for Scorpion, block low because the overhead demon is reactable. Run in and crouch block because he is probably going to do a spear. Then punish.  It takes practice but after you've faced inferno Scorp for the 8000th time it's not too bad."
MortalKombat,3dfl2p,Hype_Magnet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:20:18 2015 UTC,I have found that landing a couple of uppercuts punishing the tele has a tendancy to get scorp to hold a bit more still.

I like to use Jax (Pumped Up) when the other guy takes Scorpion.   I can't be too agressive, but I can certainly punish whiffed teleport kicks with a gotcha grab.  I can also punish the spear at range because my projectile comes out quicker.  Basically I just stand my ground and let them make mistakes, seems to work.  Also it's just very satisfying to pummel the crap out of Scorpion Teleport spammers with enhanced Gotcha grabs."
MortalKombat,3dfl2p,GreatJman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:21:50 2015 UTC,"I started working on punishing with Takeda yesterday as I was having a similar problem. B21 is too slow to punish your opponent. I've taken to using F122+3 xx Teleport, 11 xx Spear as my punish combo. F12 moves you forward, so you can cover some ground if they whiff a move a few steps away from you. The 2+3 after F12 gets you a popup which you can cancel into a speacial move.  As for full-screen Scorpion match up stuff, if they are just standing there blocking high, waiting for me to Teleport or something, I will throw a far Kunai and just spam it to try and stuff any Spears or Teleports. If they are constantly Spearing me to try and catch me, I'll try to ground or air teleport. Usually EX teleports so I can get a popup. Don't forget you also have your air spear. You could jump over one of their spears, then jump again and do air spear. You should be close enough to hit them. Or just jump and avoid their projectiles, but be ready to hit Punch in your Neutral Jump in case they teleport. Chances are they'll fucking teleport.   EDIT: I see you said F12 is too slow. You could always try throw. A little damage is better than no damage and you get the knock down.   EDIT 2: Found a Takeda guide on a site called Youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR5f_t85UK8. He mentions that 112 is only -5 on block and it seems a bit faster than F12."
MortalKombat,3dfl2p,Lukeweizer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:53:47 2015 UTC,"When you're fighting inferno scorpion, block low when you are full screen. You can afford to take a few of his sky clones. Also, you should be able to run up and punish scorpion if you block his low minion if you aren't too far away.  Watch out for MB wakeup teleport + Slide (He'll do over 30% with the teleport.)  Generally block low against him, look out for his F4 overhead starter. His B321 is easy to react to, be on the look out for it.  Most Scorpions play really unsafe, be sure to punish his teleport/low demon hard to discourage them spamming it.  Online makes Scorpion seem a lot better than he actually is."

The people you're referring to who pull their ethernet chord out and disconnect the game in that fashion, more often than not, also still get the loss. It's only when it occurs prior to the last hit that they don't receive a loss. I love it when they pull right after ""FINISH HIM!"" pops up, because they think that they got away with it.

MortalKombat,3de9x6,Krayniak862,6,Wed Jul 15 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"Hish-Qu-Ten is a block stun variation, Canceling individual hits into the blaster to loop, such as his amazing low poke d  4  + d  b  3 . That goes into itself as long as predator can reach the opponent, the only way out it to armor through it, it does 2.5% each time, and you can get 4 easy. Now combine that with the fact that any individual normal can be combod into the blaster and you have a HUGE range of blocktun.  d  1 +  d  b  3  Keeps you in place, great once you've gone invisible, or when they have no meter.   f  1  + d  b  3  is a high hit, but one of the fastest, and they'll be blocking constantly anyways  d  3 +  d  b  3  This moves you back slower than down 4,   Once you've learned to timing you can combine the constant block stun into combos off of the b  2  poke/string. Once you've moved back the max range of the down 4 block string here are some options.  b  2  2  d  2  Finish that low blaster block string with an overhead  b  2  2  +  d  b  3  Or a low  b  2  2  b  f  3  (HOLD) dash  b  3  d  2  or if their real smart you can cancel into anything you need to do at the end   Now you have to be as quick as possible with the cancel into blaster and back into the normal, but when you get it down, some of the loops are actually fast enough to break armor as well, so each one i mentioned has its own use.  Edit i forgot to mention that at anytime you can mixup by throwing the disc instead of blasting, or go invisible to increase the difficultly of the situation for your opponent."

MortalKombat,3de9x6,DontUseThat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"I've noted HQT is so easy to use, and abuse against less than great players, it has great zoning and AA.  Pew Pew Pew.  I try not to over-abuse the Plasma Shot, but damn it's satisfying.    Hunter is more ""sporting"" but that can be equally as annoying given you have a pretty good trap/disc lockdown there as well.    Predator is a pretty damn solid character right now.  I expect a nerf in the future."
MortalKombat,3de9x6,Krayniak862,3,Thu Jul 16 20:50:46 2015 UTC,Agreed for zoning that's tough to beat.  I fought a Ferra Torr and this was the perfect variant for that fight.
MortalKombat,3de9x6,Speed_Force,2,Wed Jul 15 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to pick up Hish-Qu-Ten because I think it's such a good flip from D'vorah who's super pressure-heavy and close range, but god damn it seems like his combos are so much harder for me to grasp"
MortalKombat,3de9x6,CptSupermrkt,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"Try: f212, EXbf4, 32+L1/LB.   This combo does 36% damage I believe and it's pretty easy.   Edit: Just remembered that this isn't limited to any variation, so you can use this same combo with the Hunter or Warrior variations."
MortalKombat,3de9x6,rafikiknowsdeway1,0,Thu Jul 16 16:35:05 2015 UTC,Are you the guy I played last night who spammed the ever loving fuck out of the plasma cannon? Cause you sound like that guy.
MortalKombat,3de9x6,FEARxTHExWOLF,3,Wed Jul 15 17:32:57 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that's what you're supposed to do with HQT
MortalKombat,3de9x6,FatTreeWizard,3,Thu Jul 16 03:38:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I've heard some counter arguments, but I'm still not convinced that Warrior is anything to write home about.  I like HQT for the extremely satisfying sound of the plasma cannon alone.  I think Hunter may be the best, but it requires someone with very high skill levels and someone who can steer the neutral game in their favor.  As someone pointed out today in another thread, you have time to heal AND neutral jump punch if your opponent gets caught in a trap.  With EX heal, that's +10% for you and at least -10% for your opponent (more if you continue the combo)."
MortalKombat,3de9x6,Aremah,3,Wed Jul 15 16:48:01 2015 UTC,"Hunter all the way. While the trap disappears if you take a single hit, its still amazing at keeping people where you want them. Just yesterday I was having trouble with a possesed kenshi who was standing across the screen spamming his attacks. A far thrown trap forced him out of his comfort zone. I also like dropping one close while corner pressuring after a hard knock down. Its especially useful now that I know you have time to heal and neutral jump them while they're hanging upside-down"
MortalKombat,3dgu5i,Alkaholic,0,Thu Jul 16 04:04:21 2015 UTC,Why do I keep dropping the B12x after 212?  I've never been able to stick that.

Don't worry about opening them up, most of the time you won't, but they will do it for you. Just use safe strings, they will block and attack. Block their attack, most of the time it will be something unsafe so just punish it. The very hard AI seems challenging at first but once you figure out how predictable it is it becomes a lot easier.

MortalKombat,3delw3,clutch-in-clutch-out,2,Wed Jul 15 22:39:59 2015 UTC,That's actually a pretty valid question. In a game as fast paced as MKX it'd make sense to have 90 sec rounds. Being 2:30 pretty much ensures that games will almost never end in time outs.
MortalKombat,3delw3,ilcorvomuerto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:42:52 2015 UTC,In a game as fast paced as MKX it'd make sense to have 90 sec rounds   Yep exactly my thoughts. Shorter timer should give more pressure on players who play defensively. And 150 seconds more like infinity in any fighting game

MortalKombat,3dbbbn,furious_pillow02,9,Wed Jul 15 01:15:06 2015 UTC,"Nah, as far as I know that's how it's supposed to work. If he's in the clone he's vulnerable to getting hit. If he was just a few pixels back he'd be fine, so I don't know what his complaint is really.  As a F/T player I loled at the ""no options"" I'm like bitch I got all the options."
MortalKombat,3dbbbn,celticfan008,4,Wed Jul 15 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"Haha, Super Trooper, F/T has everything against GM Sub.  But I kind of agree with Brady on this one, 'cause it still looks like Jax hit ice before he hit Sub, so I think it should've frozen him.  To me, it looks like Sub was pushed back far enough where he wouldn't get hit before the Ice Clone would, so I don't think the game should register Jax hitting Sub at all."
MortalKombat,3dbbbn,furious_pillow02,2,Wed Jul 15 02:42:41 2015 UTC,I think he's referring to the balance change where if you hit sub zeros block with an attack the clone disappears now.
MortalKombat,3dbbbn,Clayton_11,2,Wed Jul 15 02:54:36 2015 UTC,"Oh really!? I actually noticed one game once that my Ferra jab tagged him on block through the clone, I thought because it was Ferra and not Torr hitting that's why it didn't connect. But I forgot to lab it so I couldn't be sure.  If so yea that kinda sucks, is this confirmed somewhere though? I mean he is definitely touching the clone, and as far as I know that's how the mechanic was always supposed to be."

Also if you njp in midscreen you can corner carry all the way to the corner, but if you use this setup you have to spend a bar to corner carry that far. Just saying, there are much better options"

MortalKombat,3db6s5,ayyjayyy,2,Wed Jul 15 09:42:37 2015 UTC,To set them up for a 50/50? It's pretty straightforward.
MortalKombat,3dbtfl,Quiversan,8,Wed Jul 15 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"Hit confirm - the moment an attack of yours actually connects with your opponent. My sub zero's next move is determined on a confirm or not. Ie B33 is a low low that is cancellable, do i clone if blocked or ex freeze on the confirmed unblocked attack. Plus frames refers to someone having frame advantage after a hit blocked / unblocked. Respecting someone's plus frames translates to respecting the times your opponent has frame advantage over you and that its time for you to play defensively and block because most offensive options are futile due to the plus frames."
MortalKombat,3dbtfl,kaiserhelgie,2,Wed Jul 15 02:15:38 2015 UTC,Thank you!
MortalKombat,3dbtfl,furious_pillow02,3,Wed Jul 15 02:18:32 2015 UTC,"Hit confirm generally means to follow through with a full combo string once you've hit your opponent with one of the initial hits.  This is generally used to describe a combo string that is unsafe on the last hit, because you'd want to hit confirm before you finish it, otherwise, the opponent can punish you easily.    Plus frames describes a situation where you attacking your opponent actually gives you a frame advantage.  This frame advantage means if you and your opponent threw out a move that had the exact same startup speed, you would beat out your opponent and land the hit first.    Respect, in general, is used to describe defensive play, and more or less blocking instead of attacking.  Disrespecting your opponent would be the opposite.  For example, you run up and grab your opponent.  That wouldn't be respecting your opponent's space or options, and could be called disrespectful.  Not respecting plus frames would mean you attack your opponent and you have a frame advantage, so it would generally be disadvantageous for your opponent to try to throw out a move, because your move will most likely land first, but your opponent throws out a move anyway, so your opponent would not be respecting your plus frames.  Hope that helps!"

Keep an eye on the enemys attacks, he barely did any lows at all besides sweeps yet you kept blocking low.  You also have to change up your game, you did a lot of teleports, if he would've taken notes he would've started punishing it and you woulda ran out of options.  Zone with Kenshi, as it is very strong with him. When you got to full screen you teleported right back.  Last, optimize your combos, and try to avoid punishing with stuff like uppercut."

If they are going straight down, you're doing a neutral jump kick, you want to be jumping laterally when doing the kick after the neutral jump punch  If you aren't putting the jump kick in between the njp and disc toss, you'll throw the disc from the ground. njp then as soon as you hit the ground do back forward 2.

What's basically happening is you're saying ""I bet I can cancel into this move, then cancel out of it before the previous move would have recovered,"" and you extend combos that way."

Some people do not really like that kind of playstyle or have problems doing consistent cancels online. But im pretty sure, playing a variation that has ""fireball cancels"" and not using them is kinda pointless, so be sure you know where you wanna invest your time in at the end."

The cancels come right after you finished the string, don't wait to see the end of the string animation. Go into training and focus on only pressing the required button, it'll feel weird at first that your character is doing stuff without you pressing buttons but it's how the game is meant to be played."
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,moldy_films,12,Wed Jul 15 06:36:52 2015 UTC,There are people with like 90%+ win rates with reptile ranked online. So I am pretty sure the problem doesn't only lie at the character itself. Of course reptile is not that good as others on the roster but he is for sure not responsible alone for such a negative win los ratio.
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,nodq,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:34:54 2015 UTC,There are people with insane win rates using every character in the game.. It doesn't change the fact that Reptile just really feels like he lacks..
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,nodq,0,Wed Jul 15 18:43:27 2015 UTC,"i know, and i didnt deny that. i just said, because you sounded like you blames reptile for everything, like your bad negative win/loss ratio. And i just said, by such a bad ratio, it isnt just the charakter when at the same time other people can get like 90% winrates with it. It would be another story when no one could be any good with reptile but thats far from the truth. My suggestion is actually, maybe try and practice little bit more instead of investing time on blaming the charakter for everything. you know."
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,nodq,0,Wed Jul 15 22:39:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you read what I wrote.. I'm also not sure you've ever played Reptile.. I'm aware I'm not gods gift to him butI'm also aware that most characters will blow 40% combos in their sleep and reptile has to spend a bar to just barely hit 30 and probably drop it with the awful netcode. Watch maximiliandoods week of reptile ALL he says is how crippling his damage output is. How many Reptiles have you seen at tourneys? Now take that tiny number and subtract it from how many didn't make it to the finals.. There's a reason for all of it. His damage output is anemic.   Take Kitana for instance. Ignore the fact that Sonic just went all the way with her and pretend everyone is still sleeping on her. Even Kitana can blow 32 percent with 3 fans and an Enhanced.. The first group builds the bar for a second group totaling a 60% combo, God forbid you don't block the first fan. Meanwhile Reptile with no bar has a stroke trying to hit 25%. It's not just me, I'm not the greatest player but nor is Reptile the greatest character. And it really makes me sad him being my favorite."
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,nodq,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:38:01 2015 UTC,"Dude, you don't need to tell me about MKX or reptile. I play that game every day since release. I know enough about it, trust me. I also know enough taht i do not have a negative winratio when i play reptile (or any other charakter) the only thing you seem ignorant about is, that you think your very bad win/loss ratio is because of reptile.   And im telling you, it for sure isn't. Of course is reptile bad compared to other charakters ( i am repeating myself here ) but he is not THAT bad that he is responsible for a negative win/loss ratio on a normal good player. Not even close.  But then, how many Goros, Jackies, Takedas, Jasons, FerraTorrs, Mileenas o you see at tournys?   I think you have to make clear if you want to talk about pro level tournys or YOUR meaningless online play in ranked and win/loss ratio which was topic in your OP actually and not about tournament play. For meaningless online ranked play you can literally play whatever charakter you want (yes even reptile...) and have a good winratio if YOU are good at least. And btw. you can do 30% combo(s) with reptile no meter, those combos exist since week 1 of MKX btw.  And when you admit you are not the greatest player, thats the first step to get better, so then, go to LAB and practice more, play more online, get better, thats how it works. And when you get better you will win more and more and have a better winratio, even with reptile.   But of course if you want it easier, play and learn KungLao or Tanya. But im pretty sure that this is will not rise your winratio to like 70 or 80%.  Did you ever considered that reptile may be not your type of playstyle? I went through 3 charakters before i learned what kind of playstyle i prefer and which charakters i like and which not. For me its like the charakters that i like in terms of look and moves, those are the worst to play for me."

MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Thaddeus_Griffin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:55:56 2015 UTC,"You are the most ignorant guy I have ever seen by far. Which character I main doesn't change the fact that I play actually more than half of the roster. And as I already said, I play and played reptile, and I do not have negative win loss ratio with him, so what?! Also mileena is considered low to mid tier btw. Because I guess that's what all you wanna see. The number of combo damage and tierlists by pros. As this would ever be important to your stupid meaningless ranked online play. Seriously get over yourself and learn the actual game, but I'm pretty sure with such an enormous ingnorance you never ever will get any good in any game. So you don't want help, good for you. Keep on blaming other things than you own incompetence and be happy with it."

I really think the only thing holding him back is his damage. I have been in a few games against solid Reptile players that setup and executed some swaggy shit that had me prepared to set down the controller and call it a day, but then...28% damage. Oh, okay...I am still in this.   Jax is making work with three different 40+% combos across all variations and Reptile is having an aneurysm trying to squeeze out 32%ers? What is going on with that?"
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Thaddeus_Griffin,2,Thu Jul 16 17:41:24 2015 UTC,It's frustrating.. :(
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,fuckmoneykillbitches,8,Wed Jul 15 08:50:59 2015 UTC,"I think you're just playing the wrong character, man. Reptile is strong in his own way, and I don't think your playstyle suits that. I can list all the weaknesses of Takeda and say he's an awful character for them, but Takeda has a lot of things that make him strong, and they suit up with my playstyle. So yeah, playing against characters with strong corner games like Jax or Raiden is really, really fucking hard (like, 7-3 hard against Jax), but I enjoy the challenge. And I love listening to the salt and tears of people who can't get through Takeda's great pressure from a range."
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Izzy_Leveled_Up,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:39:32 2015 UTC,"Speaking of which, I just started Takeda. How do you deal with Jax/Raiden corner pressure because those exact matchups yesterday were giving me trouble?"
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,The_Mexorcist26,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:03:20 2015 UTC,"Against Jax, you just gotta prat Wakeup BF2 EX or EX Teleport hit. Both have armor. Teleport only has it on wakeup. Trying to block and punish jax is a lost cause since he's so safe on block and your startups are so slow.   Raiden though, he hits out your armor but you can actually block and punish him as he isn't plus on block, just safe on block"
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,DrunkenBrawler7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:49:48 2015 UTC,"Corner pressure in incredibly difficult for Takeda to deal with. His armor is weak and he can be poked out of all of his EX-Specials. That being said you have a few options.   Ex-Flurry. It has the best armor and is a combo launcher.  Ex-TP. This is the riskiest so only use it sparingly as it will usually only work when they aren't expecting it. Just try to poke out with D1, or D2 as they are his fastest normals. Also you have 11, but the range is awful.  Block until they make a mistake and punish. Not the best choice against high caliber players as you'll take a lot of chip damage, can get fooled by mix ups, and might not get out for a while.   The Ex moves are probably your best bet. Just try to time them with gaps in strings or at the end of a string. Good Luck!"
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,DrunkenBrawler7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:48:05 2015 UTC,"It really depends, EX BF2 is typically your go to option because of the armor, but you can throw in an EX DB3 on wakeup because it gives armor (this is a really bad option if they're expecting it, only throw it in every now and then.)  Other than, learn your block strings and wait for them to make a mistake and give you an opening. 11 DB1 is a fairly okay punish option because the 11 starts up kinda fast. If the 11 connects, you can follow it with EX BF1 for a full combo. Or if they're expecting the follow up you can throw in a grab to reset/get some distance.  Those matches will always give you trouble, and the most solid of players those are definitely losing matchups, but the most important thing is to learn the block strings and how to punish/look for an opening. Takeda is a really fun character until you're stuck crying in the corner :P"
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,DrunkenBrawler7,3,Wed Jul 15 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"Reptile's not bad at all if you learn match ups. Force ball pressure is insane for almost every character you just have to do it differently for different characters, for sub-zeros try f412 slow ball and then jump in to avoid the slide, for teleporters try to run infront of the forceball so they teleport into it. He does has some decent combos I can get 34% meterless off a punish, 31 for one bar off an overhead, and 29 off a low for a bar. Also some good things to know ex db4 is an excellent anti-air combo starter also great for punishing projectiles and catching people off guard at a distance, and b34 can breakthrough a lot of armored moves. If you are on ps4 I'd be more than happy to mirror match."

MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Papa_Chucklefish,3,Wed Jul 15 08:37:29 2015 UTC,You need more forceballs.
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,FokinSwagKing,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:13 2015 UTC,"I HAVE A FEVAH, AND DA ONLY CURE... IS MORE FORCEBALLS!"
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Millhouse96,3,Wed Jul 15 13:03:01 2015 UTC,"He is pretty decent, not a top 10 pick, but not bad.   His combos no-bar can do 32(hard punish). He is quite hard to actually play online, i do give you that, but he is not the only one. So online play is not actually Reptiles problem.   His juggle combos are not easy, but not hard either, you need some practice and you will land them 100%.   Now the thing with Reptile, is his playstyle. Unlike MK9 (didn't main him then but i had some experience with and against him) he is not a rushdown, high-damage combo oriented character. His playstyle revolves around set-ups, which means you end up your combo with F412 and follow up with a slow force ball. This gives you time to trigger your variation special (DD3). After that you can continue pressure while the force ball is ongoing, or if the opponent gets hit go for another 25-30% combo.  My suggestion is that you play Noxious, seems like the strongest and synergizes well with the F211+3 string.   Hope this helps clear some misconceptions about Reptile."
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,BigJoe6996,0,Wed Jul 15 17:07:56 2015 UTC,You know I'll admit I don't end with as many set ups as I should but my main complaint is certainly echoed. His damage just lacks.
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Decitronus,2,Wed Jul 15 13:14:50 2015 UTC,Well the thing is that if he had damage ontop of everything i just laid out for you Reptile would be close to OP and in need of a nerf.
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Papa_Chucklefish,0,Thu Jul 16 00:52:48 2015 UTC,"I completely agree but I guess therein lies the problem. He relies on ""boosts"" that aren't very reliable and last only 5 seconds at a time and you can easily be knocked out of. Can you imagine if whomever you main if it's not reptile only had a decent amount of damage for 5 seconds at a time? If you were vulnerable while starting eat and equally easily knocked out? Would you even touch that character?"
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Decitronus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:13:45 2015 UTC,"He trades those boosts for easy combos and good footsies (not godtier, but good). Without these ""boosts"" you need 5 combos to do about 105% DMG. With them you need 4. That's far from bad damage.  I main Hollywood Cassie and i can tell you this, she is safe but her meterless damage midscreen goes 31% max starting high and it's not hard to block. Also to actually do her combos is pretty fucking demanding, because you have to run cancel and actually hit some really small frame link window. But that's her trade, safe and great footsies for low meterless damage and hard combos.  That's pretty much a good way to preserve balance in the game. If some Kharacters had something a bit better than they do now, they would be OP. NRS fucked up some things, but balance is in a really good state, and in my opinion it only gets better by the time."
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Decitronus,3,Thu Jul 16 04:13:53 2015 UTC,"Reptile has always had great footsie tools and after the last patch of buffs has 30-35% meterless combos now... He gets 39-40% meterless off a punish in Noxious: 34 xx DD3, F421xxBF2, NJP, 21, F21 1+3  Hard knockdown that lets you elbow dash over them to reverse their wake up inputs for no meter and gives you extra stink mid combo. Reptile Is fine for now he is just a little execution heavy in terms of combos because of his mobility being so good.  His brutalities though I agree need to be made a little more realistic to perform.  As for difficulty online, join the club, the fuck NRS netcode club"
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,SighAgain,2,Thu Jul 16 14:03:30 2015 UTC,I've being playing Reptile for over a month as a second (Ermac main) and boy is he hard to do combos with. The fact that you have to frame buffer his dash move out of a string with precise timing just to move to the other side of the player makes him incredibly hard to combo with. Try Ermac he's is really good!
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Ghotil,0,Wed Jul 15 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"I played Reptile and Ermac in MK9 and as much as I love Ermac, I'm so tired of the endless Scorpion, Subzeros and Ermacs running around. I mean absolutely NO offense to you. I just wish sticking to Reptile wasn't so painful :/"

MortalKombat,3dcr7c,Rubber_Soul__,2,Wed Jul 15 10:37:41 2015 UTC,"I main him. I wouldn't say he's awful, but certainly needs a few changes to allow for more flexibility."
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,The_Mexorcist26,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:03:38 2015 UTC,It's just the damage output. Up a few percentages and he can keep up with the rest. It's just annoying to watch scorpion bang out a 32 percent with one stupid demon meanwhile I'm having the hardest time of my life eeking out 25%
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,The_Mexorcist26,2,Wed Jul 15 08:15:24 2015 UTC,My main problem with Reptile is that his combos are too hard to execute and this what I think NRS should've done: If you consider thunder god raiden and how his teleports are inbuilt into into his combo strings so that even though he disappears and reappears all over the screen the player isn't having to input those moves. Nrs feel that reptiles speed dash move is visually iconic to the character and so they want him to use that move in his combos. Reptile should have had a variation wereby his strings are modified to include the dash just like thunder god includes teleports in his. No more frame buffering moves that don't even cause damage!
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,DarkPoop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"That is an issue, but they almost certainly increased his damage scaling to coincide with the fact that two of his variations are supposed to make up for that. If someone (somehow) manages to trigger Reptile's speed boost in nimble and get a decent combo going, without the egregious damage scaling he has he'd have ludicrous damage potential. Noxious adds a few percent damage to everything one does anyway, usually making up for the 2 or 3% difference, and then some.  The problem isn't really his damage output per move; it's the difficulty of stringing moves together enough to make up for it without having to use noxious or managing to use the speed boost from nimble."
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,The_Mexorcist26,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:12:39 2015 UTC,I would say that's a very level headed answer but in the grand scheme of things wouldn't that leave the deceptive class completely neutered and useless?
MortalKombat,3dcr7c,DarkPoop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:19:46 2015 UTC,"I don't use the deceptive variant for an awfully silly reason (no mask), so I can't speak to that, but, I wouldn't be surprised if there were some small damage buff while invisible... assuming one manages to use that ability, which suffers from the same issue as nimble in the overly long startup, to a smaller degree."

MortalKombat,3d7fxj,Shadowprince116,8,Tue Jul 14 02:45:53 2015 UTC,Id like a second season maybe a post mkx story? Also how do you know its about to end?
MortalKombat,3d7fxj,darthrambo152,6,Tue Jul 14 03:24:27 2015 UTC,"Post-MKX would be awesome! I didn't feel like the story in MKX was fitting enough to lead up to another game in the same way that MK9 did. Mk9 left us with a vastly changed world and a new(old?) enemy on the horizon. MKX tied everything up a little too tight. MK11 is going to need something big. Shao Kahn is gone, Shinnok is gone, and do we really want to fight Onaga or Blaze again? We need something that will not only hold us over until the next game, but get us pumped for it. If they ever plan on making one."
MortalKombat,3d7fxj,A_Change_of_Seasons,2,Tue Jul 14 03:57:10 2015 UTC,"Thats what im saying, i guess raiden could be evil next game to make it kinda new? I really feel like they could go in a bigger and better direction than what has happened in the past, maybe they have to get past onaga and blaze first then we can get a new evil face. I honestly really liked havik and reiko being big baddies at least its new lol but in regards to mkx tying everything up tightly maybe they did that to move on to something alot big and badder? Something that doesnt  involve shang, quan, and the rest rest of the normal baddies. In all honesty shao khann will always be the #1 big boss, but im ready to be nervous and pissed off at a new bad guy."
MortalKombat,3d7fxj,darthrambo152,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"Raiden invading Outworld seems like a cool story arc but he should be by no means the main baddie. Havik and Reiko are just guys, too. I never liked what they did with Deadly Alliance, just taking normal fighters and making then the main enemy. It has to be something BIG!

MortalKombat,3d7fxj,TheIronMoose,2,Tue Jul 14 22:44:42 2015 UTC,I truly think MKX could be the game for a while. Drop some more characters besides Tremor. Maybe a story expansion later on down the line.
MortalKombat,3d7fxj,Spork-in-Your-Rye,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:55:11 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the next big bad is gonna be Liu Lang and his evil army of dead characters. I also think Raiden is gonna go rogue defending Earthrealm and possibly attack outworld. It be cool if Liu Lang's group turned Earthrealm and Outworld against each other so they can take both of them over.
MortalKombat,3d7fxj,armykidbran,2,Tue Jul 14 14:53:02 2015 UTC,Three sided battle? Raiden going rogue and Liu kangs evil army. Only ones to stop them are Earth Realm good guys.
MortalKombat,3d7fxj,scotty899,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:06 2015 UTC,With Earthrealm and Outworld destroyed only a rag tag team of warriors from both realms need to come together to stop the threat. That sounds pretty kickass to me.

MortalKombat,3d83hw,ThrownAway1778,6,Tue Jul 14 06:27:18 2015 UTC,"Okay.  Know that she's a very unsafe character. High risk, high reward. All her variants have their pros and cons. However, let's start with universal moves. Her Teleport (DD3) is using for closing in on an opponent, it's not safe on block, and it's a move you'll use in several combos. Her Ball Roll (BD4) is very predictable, it doesn't hit low, so it's not safe when they're blocking, it's very unsafe on block, and this is by far your biggest combo starter. Lastly, you've got Sai Throw (BF1), this is a useful projectile in combos, and isn't bad for zoning, use it sparingly. Next we have her variations. Piercing is the variant you wanna use for high damage combos. She gains Low Sai (BF3), and this projectile ups her zoning game, as the Sai hits low. You'll want to end your combos with 'B2,1,2+4' as it's highly damaging and has a low built into it. Ravenous is for combos that mix you up. She gains Low Pounce and High Pounce, which are two handy command grabs, especially if you use them in tandom with her new combo; this variant has highly damaging combos much like Piercing, but you get mixups as well! Lastly, you've Ethereal. In this variant you gain the Fades. This variant is all about setups and mixups, the regular Fades are useful, but the EX Fades are what you're going to be using in combos and setups. This variantion takes far more times to learn, as you'll be using meter quite often, and it's not highly damaging. Just know that Ethereal is where you want to be if you liked mixups and setups!Her biggest combo starters are her: 1,2,3; F1,2,B4; F3,4,3; F3,4,4; F2,3; and B3,DD3,BF1. Her '1,2,3', 'F1,2,B4', and 'F2,3' are safer to pull off, but her 'F3,4,3' and 'F3,4,4' combos are her biggest combo starters, but they're highly unsafe; use them sparingly. You're going to want to start most combos by canceling your combo, '1,2,3' for example, into a Ball Roll (BD4), followed by other inputs. She has high damaging no meter combos, but know that she's very unsafe.  Piercing Combo Guide.  Ravenous Combo Guide.  Ethereal Combo Guide.  Beginner's Guide.  Best of luck!"

MortalKombat,3d83hw,SubNizzo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:27:45 2015 UTC,Ethereal is fun but you are missing out on a lot of damage so go for either ravenous or Piercing.  Watch this and this for a general idea on how to play.  Other than that just be full aggressive when you have meter because EX is a brutal reversal to be hit by but if you haven't got meter you are so much weaker and have to back off a bit and spam sais to get it back.  Also tele-kick into x-ray is god tier now but only really use it to close out a match.
MortalKombat,3d83hw,Middus_or_feedus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:49:20 2015 UTC,http://testyourmight.com/forums/mileena.430/ pretty much has all you need.  Piercing/Ravenous are both good but I prefer piercing as the sai's give her a bit more range on some of her strings. Also the low sai as well as the high hitting sai give a bit more zoning options.

MortalKombat,3d7q16,Redit_ded_redemption,3,Tue Jul 14 04:10:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, there is one important thing to remember.   Warlock is the only variation Quan has which gives him a decent wakeup.  If you get Quan knocked down, he has very little options if you simply continue pressure.  Give him meaty strings.   I can't give you inputs because I don't know Mileena, but something that gets three or four hits to reduce his wakeup options.  If you get him in the corner, chip him.  Seriously.  The only advantages his normals have is range, so when you have his back to a wall his options are far fewer than they would seem.   He has horrible punishes and only one safe move.   If he can't start something big he's not doing much.  So go aggressive - stay in his face and don't let up.  He won't seem so scary when he's being bullied into submission."

MortalKombat,3d7q16,BoneYaBlade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:21:07 2015 UTC,This is the best advice here. Just played a long set with a very good Quan Summoner. Keep rushing him down. Whenever he catches me in a 50/50 I like to armor through and put him into my own vortex. I know Mileena can combo off a ball roll so that's a good option.
MortalKombat,3d7q16,Middus_or_feedus,2,Wed Jul 15 07:36:49 2015 UTC,"Air sais from range to dodge his attacks.  If you block the trance you can punish with F3 for the guaranteed 39-53% punish.  If he catches you in trance, crouch block, and watch the fucker like a hawk. If he has the summon out then its a bit hard to block but his overhead is reactable whilst I feel his low is harder to block.  Mileena has hilariously strong knockdown game with the f1 string and basic 3 able to blow up most armour so combine this with the fact that Quans wake-ups are awful you should be able to keep the fucker under too much pressure if you do manage to catch him.  Other than that use your quick strings and don't play too unsafe because the vortex can be really annoying to get out of."

I plan on doing more work with D'Vorah because of the patch changes to her bug cancels which I forgot to note them before. They are considerably easier to do because they aren't 1 frame links anymore. That being said, I don't want to redo such large scale threads when there are more characters I have yet to cover. I'll make a guide on the D'Vorah wasp cancels, but I don't know if I have the tie to go backwards like I could with Subby. He's my main character so this guide took about 2 hours to do (not counting video rendering).   Rest assured I plan on doing my best to make new threads like this in the future. I don't want to sound like a lazy jerk. Half the guides I posted are out of date (Kotal, Mileena, D'Vorah, Kung-Jin--- those were all covered before the major patches), I'll now do my best to make sure everything is fully optimized before I post.

If you're referring to this being a revision, you clearly didn't see the last subby guide, which had atrociously formated combos that were poorly optimized, complete with me bullishly trying to defend it against a more reserved contributor. These combos are up to date with the latest patch and are some of the best optimized I could showcase.   As for it being 'definitive', well, I don't see another one of this caliber on this forum.

MortalKombat,3d4gj7,shadowdaemon,6,Mon Jul 13 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"Air ice hammer is not typically a good move. It's negative on block, giving your opponent free pressure opportunity and it leads to minimal damage. I seldom if ever use this move, and when I do, it's in the corner when I am looking for the last bit of chip OR if I know my opponent is not expecting it and I intend on taking the round with it.

But for execution's sake, yours would be easier :)  Edit: For the Shatter Combos, the b12 isn't viable because it's a mid starter. You have to go low or overhead. You can do b2 11 shatter or b33 shatter.   I've got 62 different combos for shatter but that's all just for fun. CS are cool to show-off against beginners and average players but they're not as safe and viable as close clone setups. You can get 61% X-ray off a shatter but again, it's very situational, almost impossible to execute online so it's pointless."

MortalKombat,3d6oul,b_riann,2,Tue Jul 14 00:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think so too. Sure he doesn't really have combos in that variation (at least not extensively) but using his parries and power bombs is hard as hell to land considering the extreme short range.  Not to mention his 112 still buggy last I checked.  But, the up side is you get ~20% for a power bomb.  Everyone says Cybernetic is easiest to use but for me it's the hardest.  I do Cutthroat and the timing can often be pretty strict. Still my favorite though."

While slow, yes, F/T (at least in vicious) can be played defensively.   Each time your opponent wiffs or makes a bad play, instant 30% off their health each time.    Has basically one low and one overhead starter, f2 and b2, and the low one combos into its xray for 50%.  Well, three if you count godlike NJP into f2.  Bf2 is amazing since it hits full screen for those zoners and still connects even if Torr is hit. Even their db2 can hit full screen as an overhead and since people don't see a lot of  F/T, they aren't expecting it.  Overall, since they are slow, I think a lot of people find them difficult because they try to play aggressive like all the other main characters and it doesn't really work out.  You can apply pressure with them but they are going to get beat out by the top tier characters purely because of speed, so playing defensively is usually the better option (in my not even close to pro opinion).  This is based off of Vicious.  Lackey is a bit more aggressive."

I'm aware of some meterless damage you can do in the corner off of b34xxdb2 run cancel, but it doesn't seem practical.  As for combo enders, I feel like a the only move you can connect it to is bf3 and that entirely depends on what combo you've done, and you may even have to wait a moment or two (again, making this seem impractical considering your other options).  What are we doing to utilize this?   I should also mention that I use Master of Storms."
MortalKombat,3d6hpy,Vaiist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"I've heard people replacing b14 with b34 instead, I heard it nets more damage, but I havn't tried it for myself.   I've seen people use it as starts midscreen as well doing like, b34xx df2ex (insert combo here)  If you don't play TG, I assume it's the replacement for b32(hold)  As for meterless damage, I don't see much except for what you mentioned with db2 cancels and maybe fireball cancels.   The only thing I've been using it for it a low start to cancel df2ex into.  For MoS the only thing I can think of is using it to end your combos and canceling it into a trap, but I don't play MoS much so you might have a better alternative."

Ultimately, as soon as they choose this particular character I just quit and take a loss, because I get more frustrated playing against this play style than I do having another notch in the L column.  I wish the dev team would somehow neutralize the characters with moves like that. Maybe make them use a bar or something... hell I don't know. What I do know is that it's very frustrating."

MortalKombat,3d4aat,grassisalwayspurpler,0,Tue Jul 14 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"disagree, without a character with a teleport and fast projectile, it makes matches extremely tedious.  has a fast startup, 3 consecutive hits and pushes you back if you block it. Obviously you should duck it, but still it doesn't have many negatives to it.  Definitely not one of the better ideas for moves and you don't see moves like that in many fighting games for a reason, it would be different if her normal move was a fast shot, and the ex was an 3 shot burst, that would make more sense."

There's also Lucifer, who Shinnok took the Netherrealm from, but what's to say he was killed, or even stays dead?  Bring back a vampire and add a werewolf.  Hell, Greek and Roman mythology could provide quite a few possibilities.  An Outworld version of Charon, a Netherrealm version of a Harpy, some sort of Dracaenae, anything like that could be turned into an interesting fighter.  I'd still love to see a Mortal Kombat 500 years ago with the original Kung Lao, watching him beat Shang Tsung until Goro comes around with a whole new cast of fighters.  You could still keep Scorpion and Sub-Zero in some form with 15th century Lin Kuei and Shirai Ryu (or even show the original Shirai Ryu founder leaving the Lin Kuei)."

They have good spacing and good reads to know how to restrict the opponent's movement.  Predator takes zero skill to zone effectively right now.

MortalKombat,3d42ku,grassisalwayspurpler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:45:29 2015 UTC,But seriously every character I've tried with can duck the gunshots then dash forward & have time to block or crouch anything else she can do afterward. That gunshot spam sucks
MortalKombat,3d42ku,grassisalwayspurpler,5,Mon Jul 13 13:52:36 2015 UTC,"Well hang on. Let's not say, ""that gunshot spam sucks."" Despite this it's still the best spam in the game. It just has a way to be countered that all decent players know by now. But her gunshot is multihit, with a good amount of chip, quick startup, too many hits to armor through, too spread apart to jump over. The only way to beat that spam is crouch ducking them, and even then, unless the spammer is a total noob, you have to block and avoid a few attempts to knock you backwards. I never lose to a Jacqui spammer as one of my mains as soon as I saw the first guy crouch past the strategy. But let's not pretend that just because it can be done means that it's easy. It takes a frustrating amount of patience and isn't nearly as satisfying to do now as it was when the spamming was new."
MortalKombat,3d42ku,grassisalwayspurpler,-3,Mon Jul 13 15:30:24 2015 UTC,ok
MortalKombat,3d42ku,grassisalwayspurpler,4,Mon Jul 13 17:04:40 2015 UTC,"Not everyone's main has teleports...  For example, I play Ferra Torr, slowest walk speed, slowest run speed, and biggest hurtbox in the game. Normally I have Ferra to trow through projectiles so I don't get zoned out all day, but that doesn't work on Jaqui's gunshots for some reason. So yeah, not every character can cross the screen from the other side like Mac or Scorp"
MortalKombat,3d42ku,bryanrobh,2,Mon Jul 13 16:16:28 2015 UTC,That's not the point though
MortalKombat,3d42ku,SuperFirePanda,2,Mon Jul 13 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"that people looking for tips against Jaqui want solutions with their own character that they can work on improving on and don't want to resort to learning a new character just to counter pick one variation because that simple ""just teleport"" advice doesn't apply to them and won't even help against a jaqui that remotely knows what they are doing since they are highly punishable"
MortalKombat,3d42ku,MisterEpidemic,2,Mon Jul 13 17:38:08 2015 UTC,"That is the simplest way of looking at it and there are plenty of other strategies other than teleporting.

If you're quick enough (offline) you can do F24 D1 F24 D1 F3~ExNutpunch RC12 F3~NutPunch for 38% I'm not expecting you to hit that hard ass combo, I'm just using it to emphasize the importance of hitting D1 early."

My only gripe with her is how slow her main kombo starter is (f343 or f344) seriously ray Charles could see that shit coming and block it. Her mixup is nice and she has good damage, the only reason she doesn't see competitive play is because she's so unsafe and as said in other comments on this post you can adapt to her play style in one round"

Great wakeup attacks are usually unsafe for balance reasons. Johnny's flying kick safe on block but hits high and can therefore be neutral crouched, same goes for raidens electrocute, jax's gotcha grab and a few others. Wakeups hitting either low or overhead will for the most part be unsafe. EB's/sub's/tanya's slide, jax's overhead superman. Mileenas ball roll being safe would be too good an imbalanced.   Specials are for the most part unsafe. Some are not because they serve a different purpose. A special being as good as mileenas ex ball roll would be too good if it was made safe."

Once you are in slide/F4 range and you think he won't block it, you can try one of those. Preferably slide because it goes under bf3, but if you think he won't expect F4 over slide, try that.   Once you're finally in, watch for ex rising karma because it leads to full combo, has armour, and puts you back to full screen after the combo.

You are going to eat chip damage as you move across the screen to him but if you take it slow you can push him to the corner which is where Erron excels. Be careful though, some of Errons stuff can be armoured through and if that happens to you expect to get sent full screen again and have to work your way back through the gauntlet. Watch his meter and respect his wake up when he has resources. I haven't really tried it but marksman would probably be better for this matchup because you have some ranged options and can fun cancel strings to make them safe and bait reversals."

MortalKombat,3d56oh,rokired,3,Mon Jul 13 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"Well if you happen to block Mileena's rolls and teleports you can punish her with just about anyone, just make sure your punish combo doesn't have an insanely long start up time. For Kenshi punish with B32, F32 or B1 into full combos, plus I'd use Balanced Kenshi to zone and bait her teleport into a full combo."
MortalKombat,3d56oh,FearlessMadman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:00:21 2015 UTC,"I too often rely on punishing with a throw when I could capitalize with so much more.

I'll check out b32, f32 tonight. Does Kenshi have any other strings with fast startup time?"
MortalKombat,3d56oh,bware113,2,Mon Jul 13 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"She only has two overheads she can start a combo with f3 and EX roll. f3 is slow enough that you can jab her out of on reaction.

MortalKombat,3d56oh,A_Change_of_Seasons,2,Mon Jul 13 18:51:05 2015 UTC,Just noticed you said Grandmaster does low damage its important to play him like this 1. If you hit your enemy mdiscreen dont give a shit how much damage you do but push him as far as possible to the next corner 2. Is your enemy in the corner ? Start your high damage combos 40-50% It`s all about pushing the enemy into a corner THAN try to do damage
MortalKombat,3d56oh,DivineImpalerX,2,Mon Jul 13 21:15:57 2015 UTC,"Mileena's easy and too slow to be overly aggressive. Be more aggressive than her! A fast, safe character like Liu or Jax can easily outpace her and not let her attack. Her only attack with any speed is her Ball Roll, which when blocked leaves her ready to be full combo'd, so learn to read those. Block low unless she has meter, or does her F3 (the slow jump spin kick thing), 21u4, or her 3. Those are her only overheads, and piercing will usually go after your feet for the most part anyways. Mileena is most dangerous when you are knocked down, she has a really good oki game. Use wakeups to your advantage and catch her off guard, but never block low if she's on the ground with meter...  I main Mileena and Cryo's usually get me the worst for some reason."
MortalKombat,3d56oh,DivineImpalerX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:30:46 2015 UTC,Imo: - Grandmaster Sub - Unbreakable (very underrated) - Raiden (his electro grab is a very strong (fast) armor move) - Cassie Cage dat backflip special godlike (+ amongst fastest characters in the game maybe she is the fastest)

I haven't got an MKX friend I couldn't beat and I'm at around 20 hours and beating people with 400 hours. It feels so cheap and unfair to play her, but I can't pick up many characters because my D-pad with my way of using it isn't really ideal for combos that require a bf or an fb movement.

MortalKombat,3d47b7,EointheGUY,5,Mon Jul 13 18:30:42 2015 UTC,the point is that she can abuse the lag to make her 50/50s unreactable. That''s why she's on the list.
MortalKombat,3d47b7,themilkman014,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:33:51 2015 UTC,Provided you can close in w/ input lag and screwy timing. And her main starters (b14 and b332) don't really do that much damage. If we're talking solely about 50/50's you can count in Erron Black and Kotal as well. Absolutely agree with Ermac tho
MortalKombat,3d47b7,EointheGUY,4,Mon Jul 13 18:36:55 2015 UTC,"Here's how you get in close.... dive kick into full combo, if you are at full screen you dive kick into divekick into full combo. Divekick's with their pushback aren't going to be punished with input delay. Her jumping 1 is absolutely retarded as she lays her whole body out horizontally so it can be used from half screen. Then you have to block overhead low overhead, overhead low low, low mid overhead, or low mid low...."
MortalKombat,3d47b7,grassisalwayspurpler,2,Mon Jul 13 19:07:45 2015 UTC,Are you kidding? Dive kick is minus a billion on block and so many recovery frames on whiff now.
MortalKombat,3d47b7,SuperFirePanda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:17:59 2015 UTC,Yeah but I just said it's not getting punished online because of input delay and pushback. and 5 frames of recovery up from 0 means absolutely nothing online you can still just do another divekick and it will beat out any attempt at punishing the first whiffed divekick
MortalKombat,3d47b7,grassisalwayspurpler,2,Mon Jul 13 20:22:46 2015 UTC,I dunno. Online sucks but I mean if you can't punish a high blocked divekick then maybe we should be rioting.

MortalKombat,3d47b7,SuperFirePanda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:01:50 2015 UTC,"It's never a high blocked one though, its always a low one because they do it from so far away. Then if it whiffs right in front of you you have to react to that with input delays and by that time theyre already mashing out a mix up or another jump back divekick. There's no reason to ever divekick from high blocked divekick range as you should just be doing her jump in 1 at that point"
MortalKombat,3d47b7,grassisalwayspurpler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"If you're saying they're repeatedly doing divekick they probably aren't spacing very well. Mashing is an option you know. Like I said, online sucks. It's really unfortunate."

Jason is just easy to combo/juggle with and hits like a truck.  I played Stryker in MK3/UMK3/MK9 so Cassie seemed like the replacement....I was wrong.
MortalKombat,3d47b7,Tyranith,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:11:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah Cassie is somewhat hard to play but she's top tier. Fast, long range 50/50s into full combos, fast dashing normals combined with some of the best mobility in the game makes her amazing at footsies. Her flip kick is extremely hard to punish, she has good wakeup options, good anti-air. Only weakness Cassie has is zoning, which isn't that good in this game anyway. She's hard to use with lag though, makes her midscreen run combos very hard to land."

I went 3 days in the Lab with predator and now destroy a lot of people.
MortalKombat,3d6ndv,Ghostdogz,3,Fri Jul 17 12:01:02 2015 UTC,"The problem you might be having is that you're thinking you need to be faster, when in reality you might just need to be smoother.  Because of recovery and stuff, the game is only going to process your commands up to a certain point,  and after that pressing buttons any faster won't have any affect.  Just try to do it piece by piece and take note of when each part is supposed to hit and what each button press is actually doing.   Slowly build combos and you'll get the hang of it."

I don't know what the ancient civilization seen in the movie clip is exactly (many seem to think Aztec but I don't think the movie was specific). But it is safe to assume the Aztec, Egyptians, and Mayans were subject to the Predators.  l  I'm probably researching too much on something that's supposed to be a node to the audience, but it's interesting to try and justify the Predator into the MK Plot. : )  reference 1  reference 2"

MortalKombat,3d34p9,Flamy507,0,Mon Jul 13 15:41:51 2015 UTC,prove me wrong :) but when Kotal actually visited earthrealm for the first time... He traveled across some snowy regions :O
MortalKombat,3d34p9,ghostECHOsevn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:07:04 2015 UTC,But isn't Kotal from Outworld and not part of any earth realm cultures...? Or did I read it all wrong?
MortalKombat,3d34p9,ghostECHOsevn,2,Tue Jul 14 00:06:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in his past he Traveled to Earthrealm where encountered a tribe in the Amazon who believed Kotal to be the god of war, Buluc.  So they began to worship him.  His father was still in charge of the Osh-Tekk at the time, and Kotal was basically on a journey that would allow him to inherit his father's helm. ""The Rite of Realmwalk"" which forced him to journey to Earthrealm. While ruling the tribe, Kotal fought many battles against the tribe's enemies of the sea and taught them the savage ways of the Osh-Tekk, making them more blood thirsty."

MortalKombat,3d2z4l,Ph4ntom900,3,Mon Jul 13 03:53:50 2015 UTC,I think it would be better if it was dark orange like his eye colour. Would definitely be cool
MortalKombat,3d2z4l,Gunnerbeu,4,Mon Jul 13 03:06:05 2015 UTC,Any sort of dark evil colour I'd like to see be on dark raiden! It'd be awesome. Reminds me of my evil run through on infamous.

MortalKombat,3d2z4l,IlALXlI,3,Mon Jul 13 11:53:52 2015 UTC,Shinnok gets red lightning when he steals Raiden's Special so that's pretty cool. But yeah it would make sense for Raiden
MortalKombat,3d2z4l,The_Mexorcist26,3,Mon Jul 13 14:20:06 2015 UTC,He steals superman fly right ? Is the red electric at the end of the superman fly when they break away from you ?
MortalKombat,3d2z4l,mayobutter,3,Mon Jul 13 14:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah Superman fly I wasn't sure what it was called. But yeah he glows red I believe and then when he breaks off, as you said, he releases red lightning"
MortalKombat,3d2z4l,Pobbimann,4,Mon Jul 13 14:31:24 2015 UTC,That's awesome! I don't remember very much lightning being in the superman fly so it slipped my mind haha

The problem though is that these physical volumes are really behind.   If you want buy the comics whilst staying up to date, you can do so at ComiXology, a great site to read stuff digitally and legally. Hope this answers any un-asked questions, happy reading! :)  Edit: I've been corrected, they do sell physical issues, but later on (I guess hence the name Digital First). So yeah get that if you want them issues physical! My mistake!"
