MkeBucks,3e3f5i,cookster123,6,Tue Jul 21 17:56:32 2015 UTC,Kidds surrounding himself with buddies. Theres no way in hell we keep Gutierrez though!
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,sweetjaegs,3,Tue Jul 21 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"He will get minutes until Parker returns. We need an offensive PF in some lineups to start the season without Parker, Dudley and Ersan."
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,indelibleinfatuation,4,Tue Jul 21 19:46:26 2015 UTC,Well... I couldn't be anymore indifferent about this. Here's to hoping he hits the occasional 3 for us
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,SunnEarthSleep,4,Tue Jul 21 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly pretty stoked about the Cope signing. Sure he's not a revolutionary player, but he can effectively stretch the floor which is something we desperately need. Cope has a very nice stroke and since retaining Dudley wasn't possible this is the absolute best move I think could've been made."
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,Antetokounmpo,6,Wed Jul 22 00:27:52 2015 UTC,I think keeping Dudley woulda been better
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,BucksIn6ix,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"They give away Dudley for nothing and then get a guy who's worse. Unless Copeland is getting paid the vet min. or something dirt cheap like that, this is pretty puzzling."
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,kryle,7,Tue Jul 21 19:30:09 2015 UTC,Idk man. Once Dudley got hurt he was actually pretty shitty after that. Which is also the reason he was traded to us for nothing. Don't get me wrong I miss him but this will probably be better as long as copeland doesn't get stabbed again lol
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,BucksIn6ix,2,Tue Jul 21 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah he was pretty shitty, he was injured though."
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,kryle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:57 2015 UTC,Exactly. That's why we are essentially choosing copeland over him because Dudley is a health risk and copeland isn't as much.
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,BucksIn6ix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"Good point. Although, there's also a risk that Dudley doesn't get injured, plays like he did pre-all star break, and that Copeland plays worse."

MkeBucks,3e3f5i,sweetjaegs,3,Tue Jul 21 23:43:13 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good move. After the news that Jabari likely won't be back until January and the Ersan/Dudley departure, I think he'll be a solid stretch 4 off of the bench until Parkers return. Maybe 10-20 minutes a game. We'll also be signing him to the vet minimum. Sure, I'd rather have Dudley, but the fact is he is gone so Copeland could fill that roll."
MkeBucks,3e3f5i,BucksIn6ix,0,Tue Jul 21 19:43:01 2015 UTC,Or we could have just kept the better player

Middleton is more of a straight line guy with great perimeter defenisve skills. As far as being a pure scorer Middleton isnt in the same league as Redd especially since he'll probably be our 3rd or forth threat on offense.

MkeBucks,3dzqnp,thebrewcrew82,13,Mon Jul 20 21:08:45 2015 UTC,"THE TOP TEN  ONE  Milwaukee Bucks (Projected three-year WARP: 92.5) Key young players: John Henson, Greg Monroe, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Michael Carter-Williams, Jabari Parker  The Bucks cemented this spot when they signed free-agent Monroe this summer. Monroe doesn't turn 26 until June of next season, yet he likely will be the oldest member of a Milwaukee starting lineup that will grow together over the next few years. Middleton has already established himself as one of the top 10 shooting guards in the league, and if we were re-selecting the 2013 draft, Antetokounmpo might be the first player taken (though it would probably be Utah's Rudy Gobert). And these numbers are almost certainly underselling Parker, whose rookie numbers don't give him a great baseline from which to project.  TWO  New Orleans Pelicans (90.6) Key young players: Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday  The Pellies aren't really that young of a team, with only two players likely to be on the roster who fit the criteria for these ratings. But one of them is a doozy: By the method used here to generate three-year forecasts, Davis not only tops all young players, he tops all players period, regardless of service time.  THREE  Utah Jazz (90.0) Key young players: Rudy Gobert, Derrick Favors, Trey Burke, Rodney Hood, Alec Burks, Dante Exum, Trey Lyles  Gobert's amazing second season buoys a young Utah core that is brimming with both talent and depth. Gobert's three-year forecast ranks third among under-26 players. If Exum makes a second-year leap, it's quite possible the Jazz will top these rankings if we revisit them during the season.  FOUR   Boston Celtics (82.7) Key young players: Jared Sullinger, Kelly Olynyk, R.J. Hunter, Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder, Terry Rozier  Everybody is waiting on the Celtics to acquire or develop their next superstar, but in the meantime Danny Ainge has put together one of the deepest rosters of young talent in the league. The talent pool in Boston was made even deeper this summer with the additions of Rozier, Hunter and Jordan Mickey through the draft, and the recent acquisition of Perry Jones III via the trade market. Is there a star here? Can the crafty Ainge parlay this group into his next big three? At least he has given the Celtics plenty to work with.  FIVE  Philadelphia 76ers (73.6)  Key young players: Robert Covington, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes, Isaiah Canaan, Tony Wroten, Jahlil Okafor  Sadly, we're leaving Joel Embiid out of the rankings. It would be difficult to generate a projection for him at this point given the likelihood of another missed season. We also aren't including premier draft-and-stash talent Dario Saric. So if you want to mentally tack on a few WARP for these omissions, then perhaps you can see Sam Hinkie's rebuilding plan as being even further down the road than it appears here.  SIX  Portland Trail Blazers (73.2)  Key young players: Damian Lillard, Al-Farouq Aminu, Meyers Leonard, Noah Vonleh, Maurice Harkless, C.J. McCollum  The Blazers did a pretty nifty job of redirecting their priorities in the wake of LaMarcus Aldridge's departure, not to mention the exits of Nicolas Batum, Wesley Matthews and Robin Lopez. Lillard gives Portland a young star to lead a rapid rebuild, and the offseason acquisitions of Aminu, Vonleh and Harkless have helped bolster the young depth. Vonleh could turn out to be better than Aldridge someday, while McCollum, Leonard and Allen Crabbe should all benefit from expanded responsibilities.  SEVEN  Charlotte Hornets (73.2)  Key young players: Kemba Walker, Frank Kaminsky, Jeremy Lamb, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Troy Daniels, Cody Zeller  The metrics like Kaminsky, who enters his rookie year ranking 24th among the under-26 set in three-year WARP. Walker makes the ratings by just missing the cut-off age. His three-year WARP forecast is 21.1, so he skews the numbers a bit. Still, there is room for growth in Charlotte, as Zeller and Kidd-Gilchrist both have a way to go before they hit the ceilings we thought they had when they were drafted.  EIGHT  Toronto Raptors (71.2) Key young players: Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, Bismack Biyombo, Cory Joseph, Terrence Ross, Bruno Caboclo  The metrics love Delon Wright, though in reality he'll be in direct competition with Joseph for court time. Still, the signing of Biyombo was one of the unsung terrific moves of the summer. He joins Caboclo as young guys who won't even necessarily be asked to play big roles in the short term, but have a bunch of potential to be big producers down the road.  NINE  Orlando Magic (70.1) Key young players: Nikola Vucevic, Tobias Harris, Elfrid Payton, Victor Oladipo, Aaron Gordon, Mario Hezonja, Evan Fournier  Orlando's talent is well stocked at every position, which gives new coach Scott Skiles a lot of options when it comes to forging his key units going forward. We know he'll have a defensive group as one of his preferred lineups, and the Magic have the versatility and athleticism to make a major leap on that end this season.  TEN  Detroit Pistons (58.7) Key young players: Andre Drummond, Stanley Johnson, Spencer Dinwiddie, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darrun Hilliard II, Reggie Bullock  This is almost all Drummond, who ranks second behind Davis in the under-26 forecasts. If Drummond doesn't hit those superstar benchmarks the system thinks he'll get, Detroit will be in trouble. But Stan Van Gundy has reshaped the Pistons' roster to make Drummond the unchallenged centerpiece. The release of Josh Smith and the loss of Monroe in free agency puts a lot of pressure on Drummond, as Detroit got nothing in return for either player. By the way, since you're wondering, Reggie Jackson missed the cut-off age by just a few days. His three-year forecast is 11.9, which would move the Pistons up a spot or two.  THE NEXT TEN  11 Sacramento Kings (Projected three-year WARP: 54.2); 12. Indiana Pacers (52.0); 13. Washington Wizards (51.4); 14. San Antonio Spurs (49.5); 15. Minnesota Timberwolves (47.5); 16. Houston Rockets (45.4); 17. Los Angeles Lakers (41.8); 18. Chicago Bulls (41.1); 19. Oklahoma City Thunder (39.5); 20. Cleveland Cavaliers (33.4).  Indiana almost made the top 10 simply because Paul George fell on the right side of the cut-off age. Washington is the team to watch, as both John Wall and Bradley Beal are under 26, as is hard-charging Otto Porter. Given the mix of young talent and veterans on hand, if the Wizards make a spirited run next spring, the Kevin Durant situation could get really interesting. On the downside, the Timberwolves lag in our forecast to a surprising degree. Andrew Wiggins' baseline is barely replacement level. We know he's better than that and it's highly likely that he'll look a lot better this time next season.  You can say the same thing about Karl-Anthony Towns and maybe even Zach LaVine. Still, for all the lofty draft picks Minnesota has had, it's important to remember that at this point, they skew much more toward potential than production. As for the Lakers, Jordan Clarkson and D'Angelo Russell come out just fine, but they need a big step forward from Julius Randle to really start moving the WARP needle in the right direction.  THE BOTTOM TEN  21 Atlanta Hawks (Projected three-year WARP: 33.0); 22. Phoenix Suns (26.3); 23. Denver Nuggets (22.1); 24. New York Knicks (22.0); 25. Brooklyn Nets (18.0); 26. Golden State Warriors (11.9); 27. Dallas Mavericks (7.3); 28. Miami Heat (6.6); 29. Memphis Grizzlies (6.2); 30. Los Angeles Clippers (0.2).  The teams that stand out are the ones who aren't competing for championships and, thus, shouldn't be in this group. That includes Denver, New York and Brooklyn. The Nuggets and Knicks have plenty of reason to hope that Emmanuel Mudiay and Kristaps Porzingis, respectively, will outstrip their projections. The Nets' picture is truly dreary though. Their highest-ranked forecasts are for Thomas Robinson and Chris McCullough, and it's debatable that the latter should have even been included given his knee injury and probable unavailability."

The real difference is that San Antonio is super aggressive at annexing subdivisions so we have less perimeter cites than most places.   As far as the championships I don't really think that's fair. The guys who stayed won those championships, it's not like we had a history of winning before this run.   The key is just getting multiple superstar to want to stay. You guys have a great first step and signing Monroe is tangible proof of that. I am not going to argue about the weather though.

MkeBucks,3dmy0a,JabariPacker,10,Fri Jul 17 19:13:51 2015 UTC,Donald Driver of the Bucks.   That's actually a really good analogy lol. Giannis strikes me as the type of person who stays genuinely humble throughout their career

MkeBucks,3dnv3j,AccidentallyMeanToo,2,Fri Jul 17 20:46:39 2015 UTC,I've ordered from them twice. One Giannis jersey and one Space Jam Jordan jersey. Both came in like 10-14 days and I've had no mysterious charges at all. This is the link I used: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Best-Quality-12-Jabari-Parker-Jerseys-34-Giannis-Antetokounmpo-Jersey-Milwaukee-Rev-30-Basketball-Jersey-Stitched/32381002348.html?s=p  The charge goes through the actual website so I'm pretty sure the individual seller never see your info. The large fits like a large so I think the sizing is accurate.
MkeBucks,3dnv3j,ArchMVP,3,Fri Jul 17 20:53:58 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, Aliexpress is fantastic. I've bought roughly 15 jerseys (mostly soccer) from there. I think the most I spent is $20 on one.   Also, surprisingly amazing quality every time. Only one was off color and that was from a buyer I had not checked out. Semi noticeable, but it was like $15."
MkeBucks,3dnv3j,DaveyTrain93,2,Fri Jul 17 21:50:05 2015 UTC,The safe bet is to just get a prepaid visa gift card and use that. No way to have extra charges then.

MkeBucks,3dp0zn,croationsensation7,3,Sat Jul 18 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't, we drafted Dirk specifically to trade him to the Mavs, if we were keeping the pick we wouldn't have even picked him."

MkeBucks,3dp0zn,cookster123,12,Sat Jul 18 02:23:09 2015 UTC,"OP is perpetuating the myth that the Bucks had any chance to retain Dirk's draft rights. Casual NBA fans will never get it right; Dirk was always going to be a Mav.  Milwaukee coveted the late Robert 'Tractor' Traylor. So much so they made a deal with Dallas, whom owned the 6th pick and could secure Traylor, a player projected to be a force under the hoop at the time.  The deal: If Dallas secured Traylor at 6, the Bucks would draft their guy (Dirk) and send over the 17th pick too. Dallas knew there was no risk to letting Dirk slide three spots in the draft, so they made the deal.  The Mavs' Don Nelson masterminded this deal, too. He knew the Bucks loved Traylor, so he intentionally traded down and was able to also land the additional pick, and stick it to his former team, and get the last laugh when people slam the Bucks for trading away Dirk years later.   Consider: The two teams who passed on Dirk after the 6th pick, the Kings and the 76ers, deserve more blame for whiffing on a hall of famer than the Bucks.  All that said, the Bucks should have had better talent evaluators: Paul Pierce went 10th that year.  tl;dr Dirk was always a Mav, Milwaukee is always an easy punchline   Edit: Added Nelson Graf"

MkeBucks,3doro9,idontownanoutfit,6,Sat Jul 18 00:41:22 2015 UTC,Vaughn and Kilpatrick are the only one's worth their weight on that team...
MkeBucks,3doro9,cookster123,3,Sat Jul 18 01:42:47 2015 UTC,"Well, it is a summer league roster"
MkeBucks,3doro9,IrishCreamPied,4,Sat Jul 18 01:45:34 2015 UTC,"Gotta admit we have one of the worst though. I mean realistically only two guys are probably gonna make the team in Vaughn and Inglis, AND inglis doesn't even play much because of his foot. It's a miracle we won a game being lead by an 18 year old rookie."
MkeBucks,3doro9,cookster123,-2,Sat Jul 18 01:48:45 2015 UTC,I'd say kilpatrick has easily been the leader without question. Kilpatrick easily deserves a roster spot over Vaughn and far and away deserves one over inglis. Can anyone explain why in the hell we took inglis so high when he was so ungodly awful in the French league the year before he came over? Potential yadda yadda but when it boils down to it you can say every single draftee has potential.
MkeBucks,3doro9,CudiMil,6,Sat Jul 18 02:56:04 2015 UTC,"Not every player has the physical tools of an Inglis though. He's strong, fast, 6'9"". He was second round pick, not every draftee has the same potential at 31st overall and Inglis is among the best in this respect. I mean, he's going to be rusty, he hasn't played basketball in 14 months, let's chill on sticking the nail in his coffin quite yet."
MkeBucks,3doro9,Omnimark,3,Sat Jul 18 03:59:59 2015 UTC,This bot needs to be sent to the nether regions of hell. It's SOLE PURPOSE is to piss off Americans. Fuck this bot  http://i.imgur.com/6sjwHZS.gif
MkeBucks,3doro9,cookster123,-2,Sat Jul 18 04:00:24 2015 UTC,"Physical tools don't matter when you are a deadly shooter who can play D like kilpatrick can. And if you think inglis is fast you are out of your damn mind, he is the slowest guy I've seen yet on either side of the ball. Just because he's faster than big men in France doesn't mean that translates go anything over here, same with strength, you read too many scouting reports and these two things really don't apply anymore. He's like a very very very poor mans Jabari Parker but way worse at every aspect of basketball. You can say everyone has potential, and using inglis as one of the only people who has potential as what I assume you mean is 2nd round draft picks is one of the dumbest things I have ever heard.  TLDR: you are using extreme bias towards bucks players and when you say he has potential like few other players at the position he was drafted you didn't take into account a single other teams players that were actually drafted second round."
MkeBucks,3doro9,CudiMil,3,Sat Jul 18 04:17:05 2015 UTC,"Kilpatrick is a 25 year old undrafted rookie with below average size at 6'4"". I'd invite him to camp but the odds of him making a name for himself in the league are pretty slim, (could be a nice fit for a team in Europe though). Vaughn on the other hand has all the potential in the world. 6'6"", 18 years old, and a solid shooting stroke; wouldn't give up on the French Vase Inglis either just because of his measurable and defense. Simply put, guys like Kilpatrick can only go so far."
MkeBucks,3doro9,cookster123,2,Sat Jul 18 12:04:37 2015 UTC,Isn't inglis only 19?
MkeBucks,3doro9,croationsensation7,2,Sat Jul 18 03:56:23 2015 UTC,Our whole damn team is like 19 lol
MkeBucks,3doro9,cookster123,0,Sat Jul 18 14:14:54 2015 UTC,"Danny green is 6'6"" 210 pounds and Sean kilpatrick is 6'4"" 219. I see kilpatrick turning into a very similar player. Kilpatricks shooting has also been much better than vaughns and better shot selection(Vaughn is a chucker) to go along with very poor defense. On a guard stacked team I'll take the likes of Vasquez and mayo over him every single game. Still don't know why we didn't draft bobby Portis."
MkeBucks,3doro9,CudiMil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"Ill admit that both Kilpatrick and Green were passed up on early, but comparing the two really is an insult to Danny Green. Kilpatrick was only a 34% 3 Point shooter in 4 years in college (from the much shorter college line). To think that he'll make the insane jump that Green made is really grasping at straws. For this young Bucks team to want to take in a 25 year old guy over anybody after watching just six games doesn't make any sense. Like I said though, absolutely invite him to camp on the off chance of the impossible (just dont expect anything to come from it)."
MkeBucks,3doro9,cookster123,0,Sat Jul 18 12:11:42 2015 UTC,I think his potential as a shooter vastly outweighs a very slow/offensively challenged/below average defense of inglis and the chucker Vaughn.
MkeBucks,3doro9,CudiMil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:58:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, straight out the bat Vaughn projects better as a shooter then Kilpatrick. The fact that they're comparable with a 7 year age gap bods well for Vaughn. Plus the only thing Inglis DOES do well is defense so I'm not sure we're you got that from. I think the biggest thing to take from this is don't put too much stock into summer league."
MkeBucks,3doro9,cookster123,0,Sat Jul 18 17:23:32 2015 UTC,If Vaughn if inefficient in summer league he's going to be god awful in an actual game. And yes so far this summer league(the only time we've seen inglis play) he's been awful as well. It's hard to not put any weight into summer league when the competition only gets better from here and it's the only NBA action we've seen from these players.

The day after my jersey came in I ordered a Sam Dekker Rockets jersey and I got an alert from Aliexpress that green dot cards won't process my order. Tried it again the next day and the payment went through just fine. We have had a rash of bank cards getting hacked in my town (Madison WI) so I used a prepaid card to be safe.

MkeBucks,3dkxht,CudiMil,4,Tue Jul 21 02:41:30 2015 UTC,"Your explanation for Henson confuses me. If you think Henson is starting at 5 you are very wrong. ""Good luck taking this spot away from him""? He's done nothing to earn it. With the recent trade of zaza I think that shows me Henson will be little more than a backup 4/5 and moose  will most definitely be the starting center(for the entire year)"
MkeBucks,3dkxht,JD1337,11,Fri Jul 17 15:55:29 2015 UTC,Monroe isn't a PF and he will probably start at C.
MkeBucks,3dkxht,HakunaMatata023,4,Fri Jul 17 05:58:31 2015 UTC,"Ya I honestly don't get why so many put him in as PF when he's a C. Yes he did play PF with Detroit but he was playing out of position and that was only due to Drummond because he excels at Center but don't mistake it when it comes to Monroe who is a Center all the way. As a PF his numbers dropped off on both Offense and Defense compared to back when he was their starting Center, he can of course play PF but his true position as well as one he dominates most in is at Center. On a side note I also believe Henson is better suited at PF then C."
MkeBucks,3dkxht,ArticunoDosTres,2,Fri Jul 17 18:58:34 2015 UTC,Who do you think will start at PF then?
MkeBucks,3dkxht,jmcdonell,3,Fri Jul 17 14:01:04 2015 UTC,"Henson. If I remember correctly, Henson actually prefers the PF position over C."
MkeBucks,3dkxht,indelibleinfatuation,2,Fri Jul 17 14:28:31 2015 UTC,Yep this is the only thing I'd argue will be different. Not sure why OP listed Monroe at the 4 and Henson at the 5. Switch those two and that's our starting lineup for opening night
MkeBucks,3dkxht,zmichalo,3,Fri Jul 17 17:39:00 2015 UTC,He consistently played power forward alongside Andre Drummond last year....
MkeBucks,3dkxht,CudiMil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:10:15 2015 UTC,"Because he is quicker than Drummond and they were easily the Pistons best big men. He struggled defensively at the 4 and his best season as a piston came when he played as a 5. The fact that you use ""he player power forward last year"" really isn't good justification as he will continue to struggle defensively. He fits a perfect gap in our team by being a true center and having him start where he struggles rather than thrives is completely and utterly asinine."
MkeBucks,3dkxht,zmichalo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:40:14 2015 UTC,It's not asinine if we don't have a better power forward. Who would you put there?
MkeBucks,3dkxht,CudiMil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Put moose at the 5 where he thrives. Henson at the 4 where he is consistently is average, he is interchangeable between the 4 and 5 and doesn't really stand out at either, and have miles plumlee back them up that first game. JOB could also see minutes that first game but inglis is utterly useless, god awful in the French league the year before he came over, so he should be cut and sign someone who can actually make a difference on this team."
MkeBucks,3dkxht,JerrithCutestory,3,Sat Jul 18 03:00:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with this lineup. Then when Giannis comes back Henson moves to the bench, Monroe moves to center, and Khris and Giannis both play 3 and 4."
MkeBucks,3dkxht,dusters,2,Fri Jul 17 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"Monroe won't be playing a lot of the 4. He probably if Parker doesn't start the year, but C is his natural position and the spacing is just awful with him and Henson on the floor at the same time. Detroit tried that with Drummond and it just didn't work. After the first game I think Giannis will spend more time at the 4 than Monroe will."
MkeBucks,3dkxht,daymankarate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:54:33 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't Henson be the PF and Monroe the Center?

I'd give him time before rushing him out.    As for JOB, his destiny is as as a trade chip to match salaries."
MkeBucks,3dhx6k,CudiMil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:01:55 2015 UTC,"You keep saying our end of bench guys are tradeable, but the fact of the matter is no one will give anything for these guys. We got protected 2nd rounders for zaza and Dudley, we wouldn't get anything for our reserves. And as far as potential for inglis, he was terrible in the French league his last year before he came over. He is also very slow so I think it's time to sever ties with these three, and  thinking we can get something in a trade for them is a fallacy, plain and simple."
MkeBucks,3dhx6k,GreenGator,3,Thu Jul 16 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"Before any of this, we need to send Gutierrez away as far as possible from this team.  Kidd's connection with him worries me because it seems like that's why he's here in the first place. But he's SO bad, there's no way we would keep him....right?"
MkeBucks,3dhx6k,wolfwood99,2,Thu Jul 16 14:40:28 2015 UTC,"You're giving up on Inglis way too early. We have only seen 4 summer league games of him (with limited minutes), and it seems like he is still recovering from his foot injury. Hopefully he can get back to good health and become a role player, but if he doesn't its okay because he is so cheap to keep."
MkeBucks,3dhx6k,indelibleinfatuation,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:34:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I think we get rid of Gutz and sign Kilpatrick. I've only seen highlights; is he big enough to play the 3 in our system?
MkeBucks,3dhx6k,CudiMil,2,Thu Jul 16 14:51:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly I believe so. He's another lengthy guy that could be a 2 or 3. A knockdown shooter and efficient scorer which I think will translate to an actual NBA game. I think he can make an immidiate impact as well providing valuable spacing as a shooter because a lot of our guys are not shooters such as moose, MCW, Giannis."
MkeBucks,3dhx6k,indelibleinfatuation,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:55:37 2015 UTC,I'd like to see him sign with us as well but we did add Vasquez and Vaughn in terms of shooting. So now we have 3 guys other than Middleton who we can be confident in shooting the ball. I would want to see them give Kilpatrick a shot too tho
MkeBucks,3dhx6k,AaronWYL,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"Cutting Inglis at this point seems extremely shortsighted.  This is really his rookie year, just two years removed from playing the third tier French league and he's still recovering from his injury which is obviously still bothering him."
MkeBucks,3dhx6k,AccidentallyMeanToo,7,Thu Jul 16 16:33:10 2015 UTC,This pretty much sums him up. Excited to see what some actual coaching will do for him.

MkeBucks,3dewdb,Kobe_AYEEEEE,7,Wed Jul 15 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"Arguably the biggest free agent signing made in franchise history. Also added a veteran shooter that's big for his position at 6'6"".  Took a guy in the draft who could plausibly be a steal. Only 18 too. Re-signed an up and coming player in Middleton Unloaded a couple expiring veteran contracts (although I'm gonna miss Duds) Jabari is healthy again WE'RE GETTING A FUCKING ARENA   The first offseason under Lasry & Edens is possibly one of the best ones in franchise history. That's pretty incredible"

MkeBucks,3dewdb,TweetPoster,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:17:55 2015 UTC,"Henson has the size and athleticism but mentally... He's just not all there.  He has one move in the post, left hook, which doesn't even make sense because he's right handed."
MkeBucks,3df1zo,qdobe,7,Wed Jul 15 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed, though my first instinct when hearing the news was to say ""suck it Seattle"", because I knew they would of taken the Bucks in an instant, but they got robbed. Almost in the same way we were about to, with the team right on the cusp of being great. Which is why I could never be a Thunder fan. And if the Bucks would of moved to Seattle I would of been lost, I am a fan of these young players, and I live in Washington now, but no way in hell I could cheer for them if they moved. The NBA needs to just allow two new teams, Seattle should of never lost theirs."
MkeBucks,3df1zo,XoXSmotpokerXoX,3,Wed Jul 15 19:55:19 2015 UTC,What I basically said to the Sonics fans is we would have HATED to see the bucks go given the immense rise in talent....so I can only imagine what it was like to say goodbye to KD. Those poor fans.

MkeBucks,3dgl38,DamienSalvation,2,Thu Jul 16 03:57:15 2015 UTC,I think you guys are talking about different things. The bill still needs to pass through the state assembly which is around 2/3rds Republican. The agreement should pass easily through the assembly.  I believe the city and county still need to approve their portions of the agreement though. The county board and city council are very liberal. I do not know how much of a fight they would be able to put up against the deal or even if there is enough disapproval in those bodies to be worried about especially with pressure from every prominent Democrat in the area outside Abele.

Bad legislation and policy is enacted all the time.  I'm a season ticket holder and I want the Bucks to stay, but no one should be celebrating this deal.   Only 24% of the state supports the plan. That means elected officials are enacting policy that more than 3/4 of the state disagrees with. The policy will direct at least $250 million to the pockets of a handful of wealthy business owners in a time where public budgets are dwindling.  Sadly, this is just another example of politicians putting wealthy interests over the majority.   This is a good day for Wisconsin basketball, but a terrible day for democracy and solid governance."

You're not different from any other fan base. The Sixers are building a state of the art practice facility which is getting $82 million from the state and sixers fans are thrilled about it. The argument isn't that the Bucks front office is made up of terrible people but that sports franchises need to stop asking for money that states can't fund.  Edit enjoy the new stadium the old one was ugly as fuck
MkeBucks,3dbs30,chickitychinachinese,6,Wed Jul 15 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"People are mostly pissed off not because of the recent John Oliver movement, but because of being continually trolled and harassed by shitty Seattle (and more recently, Las Vegas) residents looking to either rile people up or earnestly jealously clawing at our team. That shit is bound to piss any fan off."
MkeBucks,3dbs30,daymankarate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"It's less the residents and more the NBA. The NBA administration has an incentive to keep large markets open. It continues the looming threat for any small-market team, and leads to these taxpayer bailouts of billion dollar organizations. If the NBA were fair, they would either a) expand to fill the biggest markets, or b) introduce a relegation system. Either option would end this madness and be better for fans, but there's no reason for the NBA or owners to go with this."

One of the reasons I picked the Bucks is because I am a big fan of Jabari from his college days. The main reason, however, is due to the great fandom of the Bucks.   You all are devout and supportive fans and I am so glad the Bucks are staying. I can't wait to watch the season with you all and become part of this group of fans. It should be a hell of a year!

Michael Eric records a triple double.... With steals, blocks and assists.  Rashad Vaughn finally realizes his potential and averages 38 ppg for the rest of the bracket.  Damien Inglis finally uncovers that his right foot is actually now controlled by a robot. His speed is from out of this world. Runs the fast break on his 25 steals with incredible speed and finesse with his passing instincts, also shared with a robots IQ allowing him to make the right read every time.  And then there's JOB. Still misses his midrange jumper on a consistent basis, realizes his hamstring still hurts and sits back down on the bench only to watch this miraculous team turn into the GOAT."

Plus, as you said, they are both on 1 year deals so become valuable trade chips later in the year around all star break when non-contenders may be trying to shed cap for the upcoming free agency (may not be that big of a deal with the rising cap, but still). Remember in addition to getting 2nd rounders for Za and Duds, we got trade exceptions so we can trade for a player worth up to 5.8 million more (the Zaza exception) than the salary we ship back.

There are 3 issues that people have with this deal: the state allocated funding to the stadium over higher priority programs (like the UW system), billionaires can pay for it themselves and its ridiculous for Joe Commonman to pay for their private enterprise, and the city could better use the money to revitalize Milwaukee some other ways.  The first point has no merit, the state is losing about 89* million over 20 years if they don't make this deal. It's revinue in vs revinue out with the Jock Tax so from the state's perspective it's a no brainer.   To the ""not paying the billionaires"", it'd be a good point with a normal stadium, but Kohl was only able to negotiate this amount of money for our owners to decide the Bucks were worth the investment. It's worth noting that the NBA will force a sell if this doesn't happen, not that the owners are threatening to move. Our owners would loose money if the NBA does this, so the fact that they aren't contributing more says that they think more money would just be sunken costs and they're more willing to sell back to the NBA at a loss. Just because they aren't poor doesn't mean they have to make a poor investment.   So really it all comes down to the last point. Are the Bucks worth 190 mil to the city? Revitalization is important in Milwaukee, money is going to have to be spent, and it's worth discussing if the Bucks are the best way to spend it."

On the face of it, however, it's clear that stadium deals need a lot more scrutiny than many have been getting."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,furless,10,Mon Jul 13 23:08:06 2015 UTC,"""I won't claim that I've done studies on this, but...""  Not the greatest journalism there. And he goes on to claim a lot based on that assumption."

MkeBucks,3d57xg,cookster123,3,Mon Jul 13 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"This was a shitty segment. Really lazy journalism. The Marlin's stadium is overly opulent, fully publicly funded, not built in an area that offers any renovation, and still the only study that he has that says it was a bad deal (although everyone thinks it is) is to say that the effect on the local economy was ""inconclusive"". Then he very tenuously compares it to the Milwaukee deal, which is one quarter of the price, with infrastructure and with the owners on the hook for upkeep and overflow. Holy fuck John, you can't take the worst example of publicly funded arenas and then say ""well every other one must be bad too""."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,Omnimark,0,Mon Jul 13 19:57:42 2015 UTC,"If you really want to go in depth into stadium deals and their cost vs. gain for municipalities and states then there are plenty out there. 1, 2, 3, 4, and of course there's the whole site dedicated to problems with stadium financing. If that's not enough reading, just pm me, I'd be glad to find some more for you."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,2,Mon Jul 13 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the Bucks aren' threatening to leave, the Bucks dont want to leave. He should be more informed before he rants like that"
MkeBucks,3d57xg,joeygmurf,2,Mon Jul 13 18:30:39 2015 UTC,"The president of the Bucks said if this deal didn't go through, they would probably go to Seattle. Sounds close to a threat."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,daymankarate,3,Wed Jul 15 04:51:35 2015 UTC,"I was really confused when I first watched the Oliver video that he said ""the Bucks were threatening to leave"". I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that.  I really liked the part when he pointed out John Oliver's own hypocrisy on the issue. I had no idea some areas had those benefits for startups."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,Andyk123,3,Mon Jul 13 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't that there isn't economic growth with new stadium, there is. It's that if you really wanted to expand the local economy you would invest in infrastructure, education, and other things that can provide significant positive externalities (a railway perhaps, remember that?) . When you spend money on a stadium most people lose money. I cannot find one example of a stadium built that caused greater economic growth than the amount of public money put into it. By spending on a stadium, you are essentially burning money so that the owners can have a more profitable franchise. Yes there is growth around the stadium, but not to the extent that would be expected from a quarter billion dollar investment."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,-9,Mon Jul 13 19:10:40 2015 UTC,Because building a fucking high speed train will magically make the world a better place? I find it hilarious how far liberals will go to try and get around the private sector. Why invest in a trusted business when the government will save the day?
MkeBucks,3d57xg,cookster123,2,Mon Jul 13 19:20:02 2015 UTC,"Well where did that money go? And where did the UW's 250 million go? Tax cuts for the wealthy. Trickle down economics at its finest. It doesn't work1 2 But hey, that's just the IMF, maybe you and your jabari parker flair should take a second glance over the hundreds of years of economic evidence, maybe they missed something."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,0,Mon Jul 13 19:32:43 2015 UTC,The stadium in Green Bay definitely provided more benefit than cost.   Also that train would have been a disaster. Glad we didn't build it.
MkeBucks,3d57xg,PackerBacker50,0,Wed Jul 15 06:15:11 2015 UTC,"Zero public funding for any construction or expansion of lambeau field. Please elaborate on how the train would have been a ""disaster"". Also, use facts, not opinions."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:23:19 2015 UTC,"You are massively misinformed about Lambeau. It was funded publicly multiple times. Read up on it. I mean,  why would you even throw that assumption out there without a quick Google search to verify it?"
MkeBucks,3d57xg,PackerBacker50,0,Wed Jul 15 06:36:00 2015 UTC,"Nope. Only public funding was for the development around the stadium in the ""Lambeau field development district"". All expansions on the stadium were paid for wholly by the organization. Just because you got results when you typed in ""Lambeau Public Funding"" doesn't mean it actually happened."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:34:13 2015 UTC,"You're strictly wrong. It was originally built with public funds via bonds and the renovations were paid for largely by a sales tax increase in the county. If you have to blatantly deny reality to make your point, your point probably needs to be reexamined.   http://m.watchdog.org/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwatchdog.org%2F68010%2Fgreen-bays-no-1-in-taxpayers-paying-for-sports-stadiums%2F&utm_referrer=#3095"
MkeBucks,3d57xg,PackerBacker50,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"We should go back to calling arenas ""Municipal Stadiums"" so that way the tax payers remember who owns & operates these buildings. They aren't ""playgrounds"" for the ""billionaire owners."" As a matter of fact, the ""billionaire owners"" will have to lease the building and pay rent in a building they won't own.   You can move a team, but you can't move an arena. Who do you think owns the Bradley Center? The Bucks? No, it's owned by private, state controlled entertainment corporation whose board of directors is appointed in majority by our elected officials. Why should the team owners pay a single penny for a building they won't own? They've donated more than half the cost of the building as a good will gesture to show they want to stay here and assist in the creation of a brighter future for a community they plan to be a part of. They've done more than their fare share to help build us our building."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,intheview,-5,Tue Jul 14 04:11:40 2015 UTC,"I find it sickening that many of the people who support the stadium funding sit by idly as walker takes a quarter billion away from our university. Stadiums do not provide any substantial boost to economies. Look at Miller Park. Where is the economic impact? Why hasn't milwaukee been thrust to the forefront of the world's economic centers? Because stadiums do not boost economies1, Despite what you may have heard from marquette law2 (PDF). I will take a moment to point out the flaws in the brewer's economic impact valuation. Put simply, the numbers come from a mixture of things that were not directly impacted by the construction and subsequent attendance of miller park, simple double-counting, and deceptive wording. It is stated that Miller park had a $263 million impact. Great, but where did that number come from? According the previously cited marquette law report, it came from the valuation of the of the properties in the vicinity of Miller Park. The most comical of which is the walmart down the street from Miller Park. This is just one of many retail stores that Marquette has included in Miller Park's impact, further the walmart alone accounts for 6 percent of the ""impact"". I'm sure as a reasonable sports fan, and someone that has attended his/her share of brewer games, that you did not go to the brewers game thinking oh I will stop at walmart before/after the game, and this is something that could not possibly have happened without the $290 million of public money spent to construct our beautiful new stadium. Also, does it not irk you that a $290 million publicly funded stadium only accounted for a (maximum of) $263 million in growth. As stated in the John Oliver segment, would you not have been better off simply dropping that $290 million over the citizens of the area? I could go on, and if anyone reading this would like me to, just ask, I would gladly oblige. Miller Park is not the point here, though, it is simply an example. What has happened with Miller Park, is the same as what will happen if the Bucks get a new stadium. I'd like to conclude simply. As a fan, I say yes to a new stadium, but as a citizen, I say no to public funding."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,8,Mon Jul 13 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"First off, I hate that Walker is slashing budgets for the universities. Completely awful and short sighted. But what the hell does that have to do with this arena deal? You start off your argument trying to deflect away from the issue on hand; you shouldn't be trying to imply supporting an Arena deal correlates with slashing the education budget.  I think you are further deflecting with Miller Park. I am not familiar with the Stadium deal that was put into place there, so I am not saying you are wrong with your statements about Miller Park, but again this is not about Miller Park.  Next, I am very skeptical of the link you posted ""Nine out of ten economists agree: Sports stadium subsidies are dumb"". It is a short blurb with loose citing and over generalizations. Maybe the actual book is more substantial, but again I think you are clouding the argument more than anything.  You ask if anyone would like you to go on, I would. I am not trying to come off as argumentative and rude, I just didn't see you address the actual situation. So the questions I have are as follows:   What about the lost revenue from state income tax on players? What about the loss of jobs creating and maintaining an NBA arena? What about the $500 million in private money planned to be invested around the arena?    As far as I'm concerned the loss of these 3 things is catastrophic to the economy, but maybe I'm wrong. At the very least, I think $250 million in public money is irrelevant compared to what can be gained. I am well aware the owners can afford to pay for it all, and it sucks they won't. But plenty of cities have had way worse when it comes to stadium deals and there are plenty of cities who will offer more public money to take the Bucks away from us."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,dmfaber1,4,Mon Jul 13 21:39:02 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that there have to be benefits that it's hard to place a value on.   It gives many families and children a unique entertainment option that frankly Milwaukee really just doesn't have a whole lot of if the Bucks were to leave.  Again, maybe some of that will be made up for by playing more video games, or watching more movies or something but that's something you can do anywhere and most of that money certainly won't end up staying in Milwaukee/WI with those two examples. The NBA is on it's way to becoming more popular internationally than it is in America.  There are going to be a lot of people worldwide who know of Milwaukee solely because of the NBA.  How often that leads to people visiting, deciding on going to school in the state, etc, it's impossible to say but certainly that's not worth nothing.   When you factor in all of this stuff, and the fact that the spending from the State/City is capped, I'm not convinced that it's not better for city to keep the Bucks around.  I'm very convinced it's better for the state in the long run."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,AaronWYL,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:49:18 2015 UTC,"Since Miller Park and the UW are not connected to the bucks plan, I won't talk to much about them too much, I'll just explain why I put them in. The intention was to show a fairly recent, local example of a publicly funded stadium (Miller Park), and the inconsistency and absurdity of where and on what money is being spent in our state (UW).   As for the link I posted, it was meant as an easy read that would skip the surface on why stadium deals don't work. Its authour, Neil deMause, may be a bit eccentric and his articles a bit click baity at times, but none the less his points are valid, and he is fairly reputable 1 2. And fwiw, the ""9/10 economists..."" article is second all time on /r/Economics.   The lost revenue will be around $6-10m per year3 Depends on who you believe. Link 3 is a little concerning in that no one really seems sure how much the bucks jock tax will amount to. And to some extent it seems like the originally quoted $10m in jock tax was either made up, or just a small $4m/year oversight. Reeks of deception to me, but make of it what you will. The point though is that there are other things you could invest in attract business and thus increase income tax. Some ideas would be closing the education gap by investing into school budgets. This would create more capable workers which would create more efficent and more profitable businesses. Of course there's always infrastructure that could be invested in. Repair highways, bridges, build commuter rails, improve public transport, really anything that can make the world a smaller place will translate into bigger profits, thus taxes, etc. Once again, the point I'm trying to drive home is that no matter how you cut it, around $200m is going from the taxpayers to the pockets of the owners all on the assumption that this can be returned through economic growth. I'm really not sure how these construction jobs differ from any other construction jobs. Everything that needs to be built must also be maintained, stadiums are nothing special. Once again, I think the benefits of constructing of better public schools4 and infrastructure5 outweigh the minimum wage jobs involved with maintaining and operating an arena. I really tried to look for a concrete explanation of where the $500m number is coming from. It seems like much of that comes from a bucks training facility, a parking ramp, a plaza, and ""3 million square feet of office, entertainment, retail, residential, hotel, commercial and parking structures"". All of this being completed sometime around 2025.6 It all just seems a bit fluid to me. It seems like a promise that may or may not be followed through on. Plus it will be ten years before all of it could be completed. I can't help but think that in that time you could improve other public places and institutions, I don't know. It all depends on whether or not this best of all possible worlds plan can go through as planned. I think it would be good to be skeptical."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"It's a shame you are getting downvoted so much now, I'm glad someone is offering opposing opinions to the popular pro arena ones. But a couple thoughts I have:   Is the point Neil deMause trying to make is that the arena deal is a bad investment from a standpoint of tax revenue directly from arena not exceeding capital put in? That I can understand, but really only scratches the surface of the total impact the arena can have. The jock tax predictions aren't concrete, but neither is the NBA salary cap. I think it just fluctuates based on factoring in different windows of time.  Construction jobs are construction jobs, but what will go in the land currently allocated for the arena? Large scale projects like this can't be just fluid and interchangeable right? And the concessions, security, maintenance, attendants, sales, etc 1000's of jobs that go with maintaining an NBA stadium, they aren't seamlessly absorbed elsewhere right?  I mean in a perfect world I too would choose schools over an arena. Even if it meant losing the Bucks. But this isn't a budget debate. There is $250 million of private money dedicated for one thing, building this arena. And there is the $200 million in public money in bonds that will be paid off by the state income tax collected from NBA players. This is not available for investing in whatever we see fit.  It is fluid, but this isn't the Menonomee Valley. This land can be very profitable to be developed if there is something to build around. I don't see why this would be smoke, mirrors and empty promises. And again, this is private money. Not something that is going into schools and museums. I wish it was, but have a modern downtown with things to do isn't a bad thing. The Bradley Center is a money pit that the city is going to be stuck with if the Bucks leave.  What about intangible benefits like putting MKE on the map, and being a draw to young professionals and businesses?"
MkeBucks,3d57xg,dmfaber1,0,Tue Jul 14 02:44:15 2015 UTC,"If I wanted upvotes I would have gone elsewhere. I get no satisfaction preaching to the choir, I prefer to debate and hopefully at least make people think.   Yes that is the point. But these ""un-measurable"" things like entertainment value, etc. really don't have any substantial backing outside of the few thousand loyal fans. Sure, losing the bucks would be bad for those followers, but they don't represent wisconsin. For instance, the bucks attendance is bad. There's no two ways about it. They are 26th in avg % of arena filled, 27th in raw attendance, and 30th, dead last, in away attendance by %.1 And that was all this season, which was one of the better ones. The point being, people (in general) don't care about the bucks. Will an arena change that? I don't know, but it looks like we'll be helping pay for it either way. Which is what I worry about, what happens if it drops? Walker loves his tax cuts, I wouldn't be so quick to assume that these taxes are set in stone for the decades it will take to pay it off. Could be paid faster, or slower. But considering Walker and the majority of our state congress took the never raise taxes pledge, I wouldn't hold your breath on the whole faster idea. Does the bradley center not employ concessionists? Does it not have security? Does it not need upkeep? I'd be curious to know how many people are actually employed at the bradley center. And I'd love to know why that would be any different with a new arena. If you're that set in stone then there's nothing I can do. You either understand that you need good schools, or you don't. It's unfortunate, because a school would create far more income for wisconsinites than a roster of nba players and execs ever will.  Once again I contest that if something was going to be built around an arena, then why hasn't this happened with the bradley center? The new arena won't offer anything new for surrounding businesses. An arena is an arena.  Tear it down. I really don't think this anything but an illusion. Let's take the cavs, for example, they have a better roster than the bucks ever will, and they're far more successful. Sure Cleveland as a city is ""on the map"" fwiw, but the city isn't any better off for it. Detroit: Incredibly successful hockey team, pistons used to be successful, the tigers are decent, and the lions... exist, (shocking that ford field hasn't revitalized detroit as a global manufacturing power), and it's still a shit hole of a city.    And point 7 is where I'd really like to leave it. Teams and Stadiums don't make or break cities, cities make or break teams and stadiums. I have provided the evidence from past deals, and I have shared all the cite-able sources I could wade through. It is no mystery what will happen with this deal. There will be growth, but it won't surpass what was put in. It's like using a 5 dollar bill to buy 3 singles. WOW I just earned 3 dollars! Now translate that to millions, sound familiar? But at this point, it sounds like a done deal. All I can do is wait and look back with a strange mix of satisfaction and disappointment from being able to say I told you so while we're all chipping in for our shiny new ""money pit""."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:31:57 2015 UTC,"Just some quick rebuttals to your bullet points:   In terms of un-measurable benefits, I wasn't just talking about entertainment value, rather just the rest of the points I made. But in terms of attendance being awful, I wouldn't count on that continuing. A shitty small market team, with poor team management and an decrepit arena is going to be a bottom dweller in attendance. But I wouldn't count on that lasting. Will an arena make all the difference? No, but it will help. Pair that with a young talented team, and coaches and management that know what they are doing and attendance will skyrocket. I am not arguing that the Jock tax will pay off faster than we expect, just pointing out why it is so vague. Walker tax cuts certainly add more unpredictability into the mix. Bottom line though, the NBA is booming and the salary cap is going up. Over the life of the arena, the jock tax has huge value. The point is those jobs at the Bradley center go away if the Bucks leave. Sure they have concerts and minor league hockey there, but that is changing dramatically too, the Bradley center is going to be demolished either way. The jobs associated with staffing an NBA game won't get seamlessly absorbed by the local economy, that would be a significant hit. I don't think you understand, this is not a choice at all. Funding the schools has absolutely nothing to this arena deal. There is no impact of doing one on the other. There is no correlation what so ever. By continuing to push this narrative you are destroying any credibility you have. I am 10000% behind investing in our schools, but if anything not getting this arena deal done and losing the Bucks hurts our school budgets.  Arenas aren't just arenas. Crappy arenas that house crappy, poorly run teams dont draw local business around them. State of the art, brand new arenas with young exciting teams do inspire quite a bit more urban development.  They probably will either way, but the cost goes to the city, and now we have more decrepit barren land in our downtown with no proposal for what to do there. This is the opposite of urban development. This is how you become Detroit.  I have actually heard Lebron has been key to an urban revitalization in Cleveland. Like essentially they were Detroit and the Cavs of the last decade have really helped develop the area around the arena. Detroit on the other hand has been put in a hole by the most corrupt politicians of the last half century. Over reliance on the auto industry and literal gangsters running the city destroyed it. Don't act like I am advocating sports teams as a magic cure all. It is a small, but significant factor in success as an urban area of the US.    I am sorry but where you want to leave this is twisting the supporting argument into an education hating cure all for the city. Your ""sources"" have been a mixture of vague and not relevant information that you use to prop up your own opinion.   I am fully aware the Arena deal isn't a great investment for the city. But you keep neglecting that keeping the Bucks is a great investment. You keep decoupling the Bucks from the equation and including the non applicable education budget? Why? Why on earth why?"
MkeBucks,3d57xg,dmfaber1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"Lol even if you go with the 6 mil per year figure, that's more than the state will be spending to build the stadium. Embarrassing that you think this is a bad idea somehow."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,PackerBacker50,6,Wed Jul 15 06:21:19 2015 UTC,"You realize that it's out of the budget right?  the GOP was going to kill education regardless.  Their goal is to kill public education.  They're separate issues.  Voting for no on the stadium isn't going to free up money to put into things that matter and states give private companies subsidies all the time.  In the last 15 years we've given over 7 BILLION dollars in subsidies to farmers.  I hate it too, but it's how the country works right now and it's either play along or lose every large business who does this to other cities."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,AaronWYL,9,Mon Jul 13 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"I understand that view point, but I think its a mistake to compare the 250 million dollar cut to the UW system (which I HAVE called my rep about, I was fucking furious!) with the stadium funding. Remember that you are talking about state contribution. The state is paying 80 million over 20 years (55 million plus interest). That's 4 million a year. The jock tax brings in 4 million a year currently 6.8 million after 2 more years. The state will have less money, straight up. So the question is if the stadium is worth the city spending 180 million. I would like the point out where the stadiums of Miller Park compared to the new Bucks stadium are. That part of Milwaukee is pretty shitty. The city will need to do something with it. The city is getting a parking structure, they are getting out of the Bradley center renovations (the city will not be on the hook for the new stadium), it becomes a concert venue, Marquette is playing there, and there is a small shopping center thing that is going up too. Is that worth 180 million to the city? Maybe, maybe not. I'm leaning towards yes. As far as public contributions towards stadiums go, this is one of the most responsible, balanced (with owner vs. public contributions) deals I have ever seen. Its a falacy to say that because there are examples of bad deals, that means that every stadium deal is bad."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,Omnimark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"As far as public contributions towards stadiums go, this is one of the most responsible, balanced (with owner vs. public contributions) deals I have ever seen   This is what I have a problem with. The money should be spent where it can have the biggest effect on the socio-economic well being of Wisconsin's citizens, not where it can maximize the profits of those who own large franchises, and those in legislature. Stadiums are not the answer. Even if, relatively speaking, the new bucks stadium is a ""good"" stadium deal, it's still a stadium deal.    Its a falacy to say that because there are examples of bad deals, that means that every stadium deal is bad.   Stadium deals aren't bad because there are examples of bad deals. Stadium deals are bad because they are an inefficient use of public money to expand the economy. In every case I have found (do comment a good stadium deal if you find one) the biggest benefactors of stadium deals are those who own the stadiums, and the benefit to those in the stadium's vicinity only see a fraction of what you would expect from such a large investment."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,5,Mon Jul 13 21:05:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't had the chance to comb through what you sent me yet, so I won't make a statement of if a stadium can ever be a good public expenditure or not, but here is a thesis that says that they do indeed offer significant urban growth, by looking at 18 MLB ballparks. Its pretty damn comprehensive, and specifically addresses the fact that many prior studies fall short in their methodology and far underestimate the impact. Unless you think that Emily McNab is somehow being paid (in which case you should send a complaint to her university because that is a big no no), it is about as unbias a report as you'll find."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,Omnimark,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:42:08 2015 UTC,"In the link you give the student writes in the conclusion, ""although the impact appears to be positive with consistently high statistical significance, the impact of these recently redeveloped ballparks is not overwhelmingly large"". I think this is what I'm trying to say. It's not that new arenas/parks are bad things, they just don't give enough of a return on the public's investment.   Also another thing not accounted for in her thesis is inflation. Unless I missed it, she never said anything about inflation. If you include inflation it changes the statistics she gives about per captia income the 5 years before and after. The improvement goes form around an $11k increase, to a $5k increase. This isn't nothing, but once again, if you sprinkle $200m over a community it would probably have a similar effect on wealth in the community."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,shtzkrieg,0,Mon Jul 13 22:50:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you. How much money do Edens, Lasry, and Dimon have? How'd they get that money?  Presumably by making good investments, no? If this is such a good investment, then why don't they want to make it themselves?  Look, I've loved the Bucks for a long, long time and I would hate to see them go, but we're being held hostage by billionaires here. And, for what it's worth, I highly, highly doubt that two (now three) dudes who made their money in VC are going to be willing to re-sell the franchise for pennies in profit just a few years after they spent literally hundreds of hours building local political connections, an ownership group, etc.  Call their bluff.  If they want to actually move the team, then that's on them, not us."
MkeBucks,3d57xg,Nerevarine0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:14:48 2015 UTC,I thought I saw that there were up to 30 individuals who have ownership.  At this rate they should just sell stock like the Packers ;)

MkeBucks,3d6764,AaronWYL,2,Mon Jul 13 22:04:42 2015 UTC,It's not impossible.  We basically have to hope they were playing chicken and they determine it's overall worth it for them keep the team.  This also hinges on the NBA not letting them keep ownership despite not being able to get an arena built in Milwaukee.
MkeBucks,3d6764,servernode,2,Mon Jul 13 22:42:16 2015 UTC,At that point you are playing chicken and if they don't blink you don't have a team anymore. I wouldn't feel good at all if this didn't pass.

MkeBucks,3d7ma3,Il_Tenente,14,Tue Jul 14 04:29:32 2015 UTC,"Jon Oliver was right. The Owners get the naming rights money, the concessions, and the concert and event money, and they want the public to help pay for their stadium. It's bullshit. Plus the stadium isn't going to invigorate the area as much as they say it will."
MkeBucks,3d7ma3,daymankarate,0,Tue Jul 14 05:59:23 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd comment on this. To say definitively, one way or another, that the cost of building the arena would be re-cooped is always a SWAG. Oliver has good points, but misses the mark on a brand's ability to elevate itself based on its' performance.  What I'm afraid the layperson is not analyzing is the local impact to businesses in the area at winter time. There are bars and restaurants in the old world third area that feast on Bucks games to bring in revenue.   I think everyone in the public would feel extremely comfortable helping fund an arena so long as the economics of the deal lined up in their favor -- i.e. return more money to the city/state. But the question: What's the opportunity cost of NOT having an arena down there?   Local bar and restaurant revenues drop in the winter time as people now have less of a reason to go out in the cold.  The Bucks grossed $110M in Revenue last year. The question is, where is the money that would've been spent at the Bucks arena now going to go if they leave?  The effects of a large arena in a metropolitan area has correlation to increased rent and property values. This is still a highly-contested statement as some areas have benefited from the removal of a team - For example the Supersonics saw local house prices INCREASE after the team left, the reason being, it was dirty as shit around the stadium and no one wanted to live THAT close.  Given the population and relative cleanliness of Milwaukee, I'd guess that local values would rise as the over-population of the area on gameday is significant, but not nearly as intense as say a Seattle, NYC...   But the ultimate question still lies... Do Milwaukeeans really need a gigantic arena with overpriced restaurants and bars? If we could somehow justify that the money that would have been spent makes it way back in to Milwaukee coffers anyway, what's the point? But then, we'd be ignoring the potential increase in housing value.   TL;DR - I'm of the impression that the building of an arena is very beneficial, but only given the current climate of the team. I'm not going to lie, if things were as meager as they were 2-4 years ago, I'd be all for voting against public funding. But what I'll call the ""Lebron effect,"" is that when euphoria takes over an area, it has great socioeconomic impact. As the Bucks are obviously trending up, we'd be passing up on the opportunity to take a roll of the dice that we have a championship-caliber, or at least top 4 seed caliber-type team for the next 5-10 years. Positive performance equals increased revenues and the current management/coaching seems very conducive to keeping this going... Now, asking me on whether or not the Eden/Lasry crew would by an arena all by themselves (which I believe they would)... that's a different story."

MkeBucks,3d3ogj,wtt90,2,Mon Jul 13 15:29:56 2015 UTC,Which I would not watch them. If this deal doesn't pass what happens? Do the owners pay for it even though they said they wouldn't put in any more money?
MkeBucks,3d3ogj,JabariPacker,6,Mon Jul 13 15:48:22 2015 UTC,"It's complicated. Essentially if the vote doesn't go through, we'd be calling their bluff. They have to sell the team back to the other NBA owners at presumably $25M below market value and lose out on the opportunity to own an NBA franchise. The other 29 owners would then make a killing by moving the team to a larger market.  Unless they worked out a special deal with the other owners, it's hard to believe that they'd be willing to move. They would have had to convince the other owners to forego ~$30M in profit EACH by forcing the resale of the team to the Association. That amount of money comes from the presumable rise in franchise value from moving to a city like Seattle which already has a built in fanbase.  Cheers..."
MkeBucks,3d3ogj,pennypuptech,3,Mon Jul 13 16:33:25 2015 UTC,Well... fuck. This is one thing that pissed me off about JO he brought up points to make it sound bizarre and comical instead of providing the whole story. The NBA made MKE get a new stadium and at basically last resort we mentioned the reality of moving the team. And what happened to SEA? They said no and now they want to take our team. I would absolutely hate to see the Seattle Bucks contending for a title and then WI fans turn into current Sonic fans wishing we had a team. Fuck fuck fuck.
MkeBucks,3d3ogj,JabariPacker,4,Mon Jul 13 17:45:07 2015 UTC,"This is my understanding of the situation, please correct me if I'm wrong. Also, I'm a math guy so bear with me  Let X = current income tax revenue from NBA players.   Let Y = increase in income tax revenue from NBA salary cap being raised.   The state is essentially giving a loan that will be paid back via Y. So if we keep the Bucks, we keep X for the general fund, lose Y and get a new stadium.   If we lose the Bucks, we lose X, we also lose Y and we have to pay for repairs to the Bradley Center.   Is this correct or am I misunderstanding this?"
MkeBucks,3d3ogj,maraqopa,-10,Mon Jul 13 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"The state is essentially giving a loan that will be paid back via Y.   This is incorrect. The public is essentially funding 500 million for this project, and that's not going to be covered by Y at all."

They've failed twice now with the Sonics, so it got moved. It likely wont ever happen again. Vegas may be able to have the casinos fund the team and arena, however. The problem is they will not have a solid local fan base, the majority of people who will be seeing those games will be tourists who are stopping by from other countries with no skin in the game, so to speak. It will be just another attraction among the other two dozens available already. It's probably not something the NBA will want to do, as they will be seen as a toy, rather than a serious endeavor. Outside of that, I know of no other cities who will want to dump 1 billion into a new Arena on top of the 1 billion the team will likely sell for. Maybe some other Microsoft employee will want to do it all himself, who knows.   The odds are still in favor of the Bucks staying, but I'd rather the state just goes along with the deal to calm my freaking nerves and be done with it."

MkeBucks,3d3ogj,Dubisttot,-5,Mon Jul 13 18:50:42 2015 UTC,This was posted to the cesspool that is r/NBA and it quickly turned into your typical anti public funding dumpster fire.  A lot of strong opinions about the Bucks from a large group of people who have never so much as set their eyes on one actual piece of the proposal. It's like a damn cult over there. No amount of logic or math makes a dent.
MkeBucks,3d3ogj,birlik54,20,Mon Jul 13 12:09:25 2015 UTC,"It's like a damn cult over there. No amount of logic or math makes a dent.   99.9% of economists and academics agree that public financing for stadiums is a bad deal for tax payers, and people who believe them are in a cult?   You're almost as illogical and ridiculous as a climate change denier."
MkeBucks,3d3ogj,edubcb,-6,Mon Jul 13 13:35:57 2015 UTC,Except the only real comprehensive study that's ever cited to support that is old and doesn't take into account the kind of ancillary development that will occur here in Milwaukee or the level of popularity and financial success the league has attained.   I prefer to look at recent cases like Oklahoma City or Cleveland who have seen the impact a well put together arena district can have on a city.  I'd also like to see the state of Wisconsin avoid the large hole in its budget that would occur if the tax dollars the Bucks generate would leave.
MkeBucks,3d3ogj,birlik54,19,Mon Jul 13 13:49:31 2015 UTC,"Everything you typed is easily refuted by a simple google search, but facts don't seem to matter in this sub.  A sports economist more or less disproves everything you typed, using the example of Cleveland, a city you cited as a success.  Here's a recent study that attempts to evaluate the ancillary development that is often falsely associated with stadium construction (I thought these didn't exist?). My personal favorite is the section on Oklahoma City, the locality you wrongly referenced. This paper argues that 73% of the fiscal benefit you are stating is ""questionable"". It's conclusion, ""Overall, publicly-financed sports venues have not paid of economically for the city, county or state governments financing them, at least in the last 15 years.""  This was written in 2013  The facts are plain and clear. Public financing is a bad deal for everyone but the owners.  As a Bucks' season ticket owner, I really hope they work something out. As a citizen I hope they hold their ground."

MkeBucks,3d3ogj,crosszilla,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:55:11 2015 UTC,"There are many studies that prove it is a lousy investment for the public.   Here is a recent one done by the city of Milwaukee    This specific deal is worse than most as the public is not even getting rent or a % of arena revenue as a return on investment, just player income tax the state already gets with an old arena, savings on Bradley Center upkeep and a generous pledge not to move until they beg for another new arena in 15 years.    There won't be any hole in the budget if they don't pay for the arena and the Bucks leave.  The player income tax and Bradley Center savings won't equal the $400 million with interest that the deal costs.  So it would SAVE money to not pass the bill.    What they instead could do is push for a revenue stake in the arena to ensure the public actually makes money on the financing.  Lasry and Edens lose the team if they don't get a new arena so they have much incentive to contribute more to the arena. The value of the Bucks has already soared $200m since they bought it, which they'd lose if the NBA buys back the team from them.  They can and should contribute a lot more than they already are.  Even Herb Kohl is giving more than they are individually.    It's a bad deal, plain and simple.  The city has the leverage to push for much better terms and should use it."
MkeBucks,3d3ogj,ben_chowd,-2,Mon Jul 13 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"You obviously missed the part where it showed a business owner who had a completey empty business because the arena and its ancillary development took his customer base away.    Private interests are stealing tax payer money to profit and destroy existing local business.  Many times the interests involved have deep political ties that dont bubble to the surface until much later. Such as John Edwards ties to Edens back when Edwards was a presidential candidate. (Edens being one of the Bucks owners)  Look into what these people do for a living. They aren't known for ""giving back to the community""  In fact, Fortress' development in Vancouver fell short by over 130 million dollars, at the city's detriment.   These people play a shell game,a ponzi scheme, with other people's money, and they move fast.   Do you understand that they go around to other states and ask for their pension money, and then use that to play with?    Why should our tax dollars be comingled with their hedgefunding?   We shouldnt be using tax payer dollars with them. They should pay for it themselves.    It's been reported that the Bucks ownership has been fragmented into over 30 interested parties. Do you understand why? Why are the tax payers giving money to over 30 people to profit millions with?   It's almost as if you didnt even watch the video."

MkeBucks,3d3ogj,4cornerhustler,2,Mon Jul 13 15:10:19 2015 UTC,"It's bad in the sense that the owners should be willing to put up all the funding for the stadium. They will lose tons of potential money when they are forced to sell the team back to the NBA.   However, I don't think this current stadium deal is as bad as previous ones have been. When other teams get new stadiums, they may use threatening to leave as a way of getting funding, but it is unlikely they ever will leave. With the Bucks we know for a fact that they will leave should we not get the new stadium.  In addition, the stadium is going to be built on a lot that has been sitting vacant for years but is owned by the state and likely would continue to stay vacant without the new complex.   Finally, the taxpayers are already on the hook for the Bradley Center and all the repairs required to make it functional or to demolish the stadium.   So I don't think this is the same situation as most stadium deals are, but I do think the state has all the leverage and I think owners would use their own money if the government said no"

They made it sound like it was just the greedy owners, but the fact is I think the NBA only allowed the sale if they could include the forced sale to them, which they could then turn over for a billion dollar profit. 30 owners splitting a billion is a good deal for everyone.  There would be pitchforks and Molotov cocktails if the NFL tried to force a sale of the Packers because Lambeau is old.... now granted the Bradley is no Lambeau,  but please contact John Oliver and tell him to correct his report  http://www.iamjohnoliver.com/?page_id=15  He reported that is was the owners threatening to move if they don't get what they want, but it's the NBA that included this clause of forced sale.

What Walker is doing is slashing the budget, then borrowing the rest to make up for it (such as borrowing $1.3 bil to pay for roads and infa). We would lose a lot of Tax Revenue if we lost the bucks (sales, income etc.). Obviously this is all projected, but we would lose a lot in tax revenue, hurting schools and roads even more, if we did not build the stadium and keep the bucks. Furthermore, we would lose a lot of tourist revenue. We are in the ditch of losing money if we don't spend money."

Sounds like the stadium is actively siphoning tax revenue away from other projects like roads, etc.   Furthermore, we would lose a lot of tourist revenue   Which is how much, exactly? And is this to say that money spent in other places would not be able to return the same amount of tourist $$?
