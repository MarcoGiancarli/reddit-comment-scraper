It was an enormously advanced piece of equipment for the time, but could barely pass for our lowest-quality toy telescope today.  Galileo also had poor vision in one of his eyes, and eventually went blind in both.  To top it all off, his telescope wasn't placed for comfort. Instead of building an ergonomic mount for his telescope, Galileo would either lay down or crouch very uncomfortably for his celestial observations.  Imagine being 50 years old, crouching for hours on end as you sketch each slight feature of the moon (the perceived image of which, by the way, is inverted/upside down(thanks for catching that, /u/Uhmerikan)), while you have poor vision, and your telescope is very blurry (by today's standards) and has an extreme level of chromatic aberration, and you're sketching in near-darkness, as lighting a candle will ruin your night vision for minutes at a time, each time you light it. Oh, yeah, and you're constantly having to move the telescope by hand to manually track the object as you're trying to view it.  Galileo had the patience of the most devout of all monks."

""Adì 7 di Gennaio 1610, Giove si vedeva col cannone con 3 stelle fisse così, delle quali senza il cannone niuna si vedeva. A dì 8 appariva così""     and so on, which translates to:      ""Today, 7th January 1610 Jupiter could be seen with the telescope (he calls it cannon) with three fixed stars like this [Then he makes a drawing of them], of which without the cannon none could be seen. On the 8th it looked like this [And he makes another drawing]"".  I do believe the three 'fixed stars' he's talking about are Jupiter's moons. So the page behind the drawing is the one where he discovers Jupiter's moons.    Fun fact: the first Italian word for telescope was 'cannocchiale', which is 'cannone occhiale' which is roughly 'eye cannon'. It was used first by Galileo, in fact he still uses the word 'cannone' here, which translates to 'cannon'.    Thank you for your submission !

It used to be a basic part of everybody's education and teaches some basic scientific principles of learning to see things as they are.   Try it. Take an object, any object near you. Maybe something you hold everyday, like your coffee mug.   Take a picture of it. Now write down a detailed description of it.  Now, sit down with a pencil and paper for a while and draw it. Don't draw what you THINK it looks like. Draw it for it as it exactly is. Note where the light and darkness is. It can help to put the object upside down to avoid you drawing it how you think it is. You're not drawing an object, you're aiming to draw the light and shadows.  After you're done, write down a detailed description of it.  I bet you'll find something new in that object you didn't see when just taking a picture. Maybe a new chip in the mug? Or an interesting stain?  It's a pity drawing has become purely ""artistic"" and self-expressionist in a lot of education. Worse is only ""creative-types"" are encourage to learn it. The technical skills of drawing will benefit anyone who needs to make accurate observations.  I love looking at the technical drawings of early scientists. They can be absolutely amazing."
space,3e2tou,manachar,3,Tue Jul 21 20:32:07 2015 UTC,"In terms of scientific observation, how would this be any more beneficial than simply snapping a picture of something?

If early scientists had iPhones, they probably wouldn't have drawn much either."
space,3e2tou,wutjustidonteven,6,Tue Jul 21 21:34:18 2015 UTC,"Drawing forces better observational skills.  Photography and other instrumentation are clearly superior for keeping records, but even the best photo is useless if you don't actually have good observational skills.  I'm not saying that scientists should ditch photography. I'm saying they should learn the basic technical skills of drawing to train their observational skills to look at the actual data rather than the assumed data.  A trivial example: When most people start learning to draw they tend to put eyes about 3/4 up on a roundish face, however in reality, the eyes are actually in the middle of the head!  In my undergraduate studies of archaeology we were encouraged to draw the artifacts for much this reason. All artifacts were also photographed, but the observational act of drawing really helps understand the subject."

Needless to say, not everyone focuses on STEM-based drawing.

In the raw images, these moons will actually be very sharp, but very low-resolution due to their small size and large distance from the camera."
space,3e31ez,kamundo,4,Tue Jul 21 19:06:01 2015 UTC,"The feature resolution of these pictures is stated at 0.7 miles.  This almost corresponds to pixels in a picture.  Hydra is 34 miles by 25 miles or around 49 feature pixels by 36 f.p.  These ""pixels"" are actually part of a larger picture taken which included the blackness of space around the satellite.  Now think of a picture you take with your camera.  Even if you take a full HD picture, you will notice when you blow that picture up to only show a 50 pixel by 40 pixel part it looks ""blurry"".  That ""blur"" isn't due to being out of focus or because of motion - the common things that show blur in big pictures - it's because each pixel is getting information from several different features.  For example, the pixels on the edge of the satellite are a little bit darker because they receive the light from the satellite and the darkness of space.  We can infer about how much of the pixel is taken up by the satellite but cannot really determine things like how jagged it might be or what weird shape might be lying there.  All that light (or dark) fell on a single receptor in the camera.  Only when you have a lot of pixels taking in light from an object do you get a good feel for it's features and it stops looking ""blurry"".  For reference, a HD picture has nearly 1200 times more information."

It's emotional judgement, and in the context of ""cognitive"" reasoning, is not wrong, but not rational (effectively the same, and should be treated as such).  The argument is that the deontologically disposed and the deontological body of thought in general are liable to fall into emotional judgement rather than rational, ""cognitive"" judgement, relying on heuristics and emotional influence to create an unsound conclusion, then justifying it after the fact.

As any extended planets in our solar system are never going to pass in front of our star it's easy to say the process is slightly more difficult detecting them in our solar system.

space,3e4256,KZedUK,14,Tue Jul 21 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"From my post in the other person's submission:  What a big diversity of terrain here!  I drew an outline of specifically where this image was taken in this image.  To the right of the image we have the frozen carbon monoxide plains of Tombaugh Regio, better known as Pluto's Heart.  These plains are almost completely featureless except for these strange troughs scattered about like mud-cracks, sometimes with some darker material deposited or exposed inside them.  It looks like these cracks either formed from an expansion of some sort of the terrain below the ice layer, or, more likely, a shrinking of the ice layer above it.  The centerpiece of this image is the big water-ice mountain range, similar to the one we saw in the first close up, though these range in size from around 1000-5000 ft instead of 11,000 ft.  The edge between the Heart and the darker ""Whale"" region is astonishingly abrupt and distinct.  It reminds me of Saturn's yin-yang looking moon Iapetus which has two very distinct hemisphere's in terms of terrain, but even in the border between these two hemispheres has a lot more gradual of a transition than we see here with Pluto.   In the Pluto image, I notice a few craters on the boundary that are partially filled with carbon monoxide ice.  This, combined with the dark material we see in the troughs, would seem to indicate that the Heart shape is probably a pretty thin ""younger"" layer of carbon monoxide ice on top of the older, darker terrain below it, as if Pluto got hit in the face with a snowball.  (Which isn't the case, since there would be other signs on the terrain of their being that big of an impact, just to clarify.)  Why this carbon monoxide ice would deposit itself in such a specific location within the last 100 million years (as the lack of craters and other features suggest) is beyond me.  Perhaps Pluto has or once had seasons?  It has a large axial tilt and a very eccentric orbit, which could lead to varying temperatures over the course of Pluto's 248 year traverse around the Sun."

space,3e23xc,Phosphoreign,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, gotcha. Personally, I don't think using tape is necessarily unsafe... tape can be pretty darn strong if they want it to be, and it should absorb any vibrations from launch pretty well. Plus, once it's in space there shouldn't anything to worry about dislodging it. It's also low weight, since the CD is probably meant to be removable in the unlikely case anyone ever comes across it. Having a mechanical latch on the CD would probably be pretty heavy, relatively speaking.  Then again, that is all speculation."
space,3e23xc,cakeandale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"The risk of failure is basically none. That same tape is used to hold a bunch of other stuff together on the probe, its a bit stronger than scotch tape. Theres no moving parts, nothing to shatter, and I'm sure they tested it to make sure it wouldn't outgas"
space,3e23xc,brickmack,3,Tue Jul 21 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but, couldn't they have found a bit of internal stowage somewhere... just in case?  I work in commercial aviation, and you would probably not, under any circumstances, be allowed to tape a CD to the side of a 787.  Granted, it will fly thousands of hours and carry a lot of people over that time, but still... it just seems silly to ""tape it"" to the side."
space,3e23xc,Phosphoreign,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:36 2015 UTC,Half the spacecrafts components are probably held on with the same tape.  When atmospheric interactions are removed from the equation that kind of thing works far better.
space,3e23xc,SpartanJack17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"A 787 experiences forces acting on it that would rip something like this off, and has parts that could be damaged by it impacting (like, say, an engine). For this thing to be ripped off of NH would require such an extraordinary series of events that the probe would likely be destroyed anyway. And theres all sorts of other components either taped or otherwise not-very-strongly-attached, most noticably the huge thermal blankets.  The inside is likely packed full of electronics, and would experience the same forces as the outside antway. And if it did somehow fall off, its more likely to break something internally than externally"

space,3e44b1,b1ak3,11,Tue Jul 21 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"What a big diversity of terrain here!  I drew an outline of specifically where this image was taken in this image.  To the right of the image we have the frozen carbon monoxide plains of Tombaugh Regio, better known as Pluto's Heart.  These plains are almost completely featureless except for these strange troughs scattered about like mud-cracks, sometimes with some darker material deposited or exposed inside them.  It looks like these cracks either formed from an expansion of some sort of the terrain below the ice layer, or, more likely, a shrinking of the ice layer above it.  The centerpiece of this image is the big water-ice mountain range, similar to the one we saw in the first close up, though these range in size from around 1000-5000 ft instead of 11,000 ft.  The edge between the Heart and the darker ""Whale"" region is astonishingly abrupt and distinct.  It reminds me of Saturn's yin-yang looking moon Iapetus which has two very distinct hemisphere's in terms of terrain, but even in the border between these two hemispheres has a lot more gradual of a transition than we see here with Pluto.   In the Pluto image, I notice a few craters on the boundary that are partially filled with carbon monoxide ice.  This, combined with the dark material we see in the troughs, would seem to indicate that the Heart shape is probably a pretty thin ""younger"" layer of carbon monoxide ice on top of the older, darker terrain below it, as if Pluto got hit in the face with a snowball.  (Which isn't the case, since there would be other signs on the terrain of their being that big of an impact, just to clarify.)  Why this carbon monoxide ice would deposit itself in such a specific location within the last 100 million years (as the lack of craters and other features suggest) is beyond me.  Perhaps Pluto has or once had seasons?  It has a large axial tilt and a very eccentric orbit, which could lead to varying temperatures over the course of Pluto's 248 year traverse around the Sun."
space,3e44b1,imaginedmind,6,Tue Jul 21 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll take the leap.  This looks like definite evidence of flow!  The way the craters are filling with the snow indicates potential glacial activity.  I'm not sure if this is the nitrogen in the plains, but I doubt the carbon dioxide is the culprit here (due to it's very high [relative] melting point at those pressures).  Possibly the mixture has transition points just around the right place where there can be flow in the summer months inside Neptune's orbit.  I don't think the filling appears to be a snow precipitation process because it maintains strong boundaries with smooth flow-like curves inside and cracked edges on the frontiers indicative of freeze-out transitions.  Even if not flow, though, these and the previous images certainly show active geology.  I think the doubt of that is quickly vanishing."
space,3e44b1,ex0du5,2,Tue Jul 21 21:34:20 2015 UTC,Looks like flow to me.   Left to right.

space,3e2i8s,gradyh,15,Tue Jul 21 13:29:59 2015 UTC,"Great job!  I did a similar breakdown on demographics once. Interesting to note too that if you break down ""civilian"" occupations, you'll note quite a few that were already active NASA employees or other government agencies (including the CIA, even). Very few are actually ""pure"" civilians, if you will.  Are you including Management Astronauts in your Active Astronauts split? Careful with that too, because astronauts like Charles Bolden for instance could be double counted. For instance, he would be counted as active military when he was with NASA prior to becoming Administrator, then he returned to the Marines and retired as a Maj. General before coming back as a civilian to run NASA.  Random trivia tidbits:   There have been some interesting job backgrounds ranging from CIA Technical Analyst to Nuclear Submariner to Navy SEAL (2 of them, in fact) Civilian side, Medicine and degrees in Physics were the big degrees selected More Naval Aviators (Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard pilots) have been astronauts than Air Force pilots Speaking of which, the Coast Guard has gotten into the fun, with 2 of its pilots having been selected by NASA Also of surprising note, something like 15-20% of all astronauts saw combat or participated in combat missions The most common aircraft background flown by military astronauts by far was the F-4 (by virtue of it having been used by 3 branches), followed by the F/A-18 (having been flown by Navy and Marines), then the F-14 and F-15 Multiple Astronauts have gone on to become Generals and Admirals, notably Alan Shepard (Rear Admiral, USN), Charles Bolden (Maj General, USMC), Kevin Chilton (4-star General, USAF)"
space,3e2i8s,GTFErinyes,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. Very interesting additions. I was curious about trying compile astronauts' previous occupations but couldn't find a very consistent source for that information. The ""civilian"" category does seem inflated, but I was going by the book.  Management astronauts aren't included in the ""active"" figures, but are included in the ""all"" astronaut figures. As far as their background goes, I went strictly by whether the fact book listed them as civilian or military. Payload specialists are not included since they weren't selected in the same way.  edit: apostrophe"

space,3e2i8s,JCjustchill,5,Tue Jul 21 17:19:19 2015 UTC,"A couple ways.  Medicine is important for manned space exploration because long-term space travel has medical conditions that may arise not found on Earth - as well as treating people in space when they get sick. Likewise, studying the effect of space and prolonged low-gravity on humans in space is a big point of interest.  Thus, there are those who go in as medical researchers dealing with the science/biology behind medicine in space, and there are those who go in as flight surgeons who deal with treating humans in the space environment  NASA employs both directly as employees and through the military's flight surgeons as well"

It looks like the sun is directly overhead on the moon because the lunar regolith scatters light very well and produces a very evenly illuminated surface (this is why you don't see any limb darkening on the moon from earth).

Whether the background sky is blue or black makes little difference at that point.  Think of it this way: Whether you are on Earth or orbiting the moon, the sun is roughly the same distance away. But if you are on the Earth, the sunlight has to pass through the atmosphere before it reaches you.  Now, think of the brightest day you have ever seen. Think of a cloudless noon at the equator, in the Sahara desert, as bright as can be. If you're in space and the sun is visible, it's a lot brighter than that. You're not seeing any stars."

That was intended as a thought experiment, not a practical design.  Unfortunately, that idea has gotten the most press.    Today's carbon fiber is sufficient, but carbon nanotube-based cables are estimated to be three times stronger.  That would make the structure lighter, and enable more extreme applications.  Nobody makes carbon nanutubes bigger than microscopic threads, so bulk strength in big objects is theoretical so far."

space,3e38ei,_BurntToast_,6,Tue Jul 21 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"Please see the section about moving elevators in the linked lecture notes.  Space elevators don't have to be anchored to the Earth, they can be in orbit, and rotating (rotovators).  It is a much more efficient design than a stationary one.  With current materials, you need a sub-orbital vehicle to reach the bottom end of the elevator, but you can carry 4-5x as much payload, since you are only going halfway to orbit.  [EDIT] Here's a picture of the concept."
space,3e38ei,_BurntToast_,4,Tue Jul 21 17:29:44 2015 UTC,I imagine it would be pretty tricky for the sub-orbital vehicle to dock with the tip of the elevator- how much of a window would it have to do so and do you think it would be enough?   This is hurting my head to visualize ><
space,3e38ei,WWIflyingace62,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"It would be exactly as hard as catching a ball, or landing on an aircraft carrier.  Those and a rotovator landing are all 1-gee maneuvers.  With GPS navigation and a large landing platform, it would be relatively easy to do.  If for some reason you miss the platform, you are on a sub-orbital arc, and will land exactly the same way you would normally land if you slide off the end of the landing platform on purpose.  You just need to make sure there is a landing site in the right place if you miss."
space,3e38ei,WWIflyingace62,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"If you're planning for a potential miss then you will have to dedicate a significant amount of the payload mass to surviving that potential re-entry/landing.  Regardless, with some quick calculation (for your 3km/s angular velocity and 1835km diameter rotovator example) and I see that being 1 second early/late to a planned rendezvous would put you out of position by about 12 meters. Coming up with what is essentially a docking mechanism that can work in those extreme time/spatial constraints sounds like a tough challenge. Do you have any ideas for how that could work?"
space,3e38ei,Karriz,4,Tue Jul 21 19:14:14 2015 UTC,"Do you have any ideas for how that could work?    Landing platform on the order of 50x200 meters, with targeted landing in the middle.  If you are a bit early or late, you still land on part of the ""runway"".  Use arresting cables like on aircraft carriers to stop after contact.  Early or late isn't a fixed situation.  You can have maneuvering thrusters and adjust the approach, based on GPS and radar/lidar from the platform."
space,3e38ei,rwfan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:39:50 2015 UTC,What gives the rotovator the energy to spin?  And how will you counteract the torque generated by a heavy suborbital rocket at one end?
space,3e38ei,F0oker,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"It is spun up at first when built.  Arriving and departing vehicles have matched velocity, and don't affect the angular or tip velocity.  They do shift the center of mass, so if traffic is unbalanced (more mass up than down, or down than up), you will need propulsion to maintain a steady orbit.  This propulsion can be electrodynamic (against the Earth's magnetic field) or electric (ion or plasma).  These are ten or more times as efficient than current rockets.  So whatever part of the mission is done by the rotovator means a rocket needs that much less propellant for it's part of the flight, and can carry more payload.    It's not torque, the center of mass shifts instantaneously when you add a vehicle.  Typically the elevator mass will be > 100 times the payload, so the payload is not ""heavy"" in the structural sense."
space,3e38ei,F0oker,3,Tue Jul 21 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"Ion propulsion, (I'm assuming that you mean Hall-effect thrusters here) uses very expensive xenon gas, and, in addition to consuming large amounts of electricity, the thrust generated is minuscule to boot.  Just something to consider, when thinking of the added delta-v benefits.  You mentioned that the cables, being made of carbon, would easily burn up in Earth's atmosphere provided that there was a failure.  While this is safe for the people on the ground, wouldn't kilometers and kilometers of carbon fiber cable flailing about on the other end shoot off into orbit?  I'd imagine, with the energies and velocities involved with such a structure, you'd spread tons of space debris into LEO, and create something slightly less scary than Kessler Syndrome.  Think about how much debris that the Chinese created with their anti-satellite test against one satellite.  I'm sorry that I'm criticizing your concept so much, I'm just curious.  It really is an incredible idea."
space,3e38ei,F0oker,3,Tue Jul 21 18:45:34 2015 UTC,"Ion engines can run on argon, which is way less expensive.  They use Xenon today because ionization is an overhead - first you ionize, then accelerate the ion.  Xenon is a heavy element, so more mass and less overhead. Any electric thruster uses lots of power, but modern solar arrays produce enough energy to lift 1500 times their own mass to orbit.   They are way way more efficient than chemical fuels. Plasma thrusters have higher thrust than ion, because ion density is self-limiting (they repel each other), and plasmas are neutral.  In ground tests they have reached 5.7 Newtons @ 200 kW and 50 km/s exhaust velocity    wouldn't kilometers and kilometers of carbon fiber cable flailing about on the other end shoot off into orbit?   If designed properly, most impacts would not cut the whole elevator, since you have many strands of cable, which are spaced apart.  You cut a segment of one strand, which is connected to the spacers at each end, and is thus contained.  In general, you would do ""failure modes and effects analysis"" as part of the design, and looks at all the failure modes and what happens, then try to design to prevent it.   I'm sorry that I'm criticizing your concept so much,    Hans Moravec invented it in 1977.  I've just done some engineering design work on it."
space,3e38ei,TheLivewareProblem,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, I didn't know such a concept existed (I only knew about geostationary elevators).  So you're saying that rotovators could be done with current materials? If it is feasible then I hope it'll get built eventually."
space,3e38ei,cosmic_serendipity,3,Tue Jul 21 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that rotovators could be done with current materials?   Yes, high strength carbon fiber, for example, of the kind used in airplanes and other products.  They would not be a ""full"" elevator in the sense of ground to earth escape, which is what all the pictures of a space elevator show.  But even carbon nanotube cables are likely not strong enough for that.  A rotovator would supply ~55% of the total velocity from Earth's surface to escape velocity (6 km/s out of 11 km/s).  With advanced airbreathing engines or a ground accelerator, we could supply another 1.5 km/s, leaving 32% for conventional rocketry.  That is a huge improvement in total efficiency."

space,3e38ei,Grimbriar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"Isn't half way to orbit like 90% of the fuels and cost?  First stages are huge and dropped before the elevator height.  Adding to that you still need the rocket and the launch pad (possibly recovery if you're going for reusable) in the first place, that massively impacts your price per launch graph. Adding the difficulty of a suborbital rendez vous and the complexity of having a rotovator so close to a gravity well seems to make it almost more trouble than it's worth."
space,3e38ei,Grimbriar,5,Tue Jul 21 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"Isn't half way to orbit like 90% of the fuels and cost?   Half of orbit velocity reduces the mass ratio from 14 to 3.75 (with SpaceX Merlin rocket engines).  If the mass ratio is 14:1, then 1/14th of launch mass is left at burnout.  Of that, half is empty stage, and half is payload.  Thus payload is 3.5%  If mass ratio is 3.75:1, then 1/3.5 = 26.7% of mass is left at burnout.  Subtract 3.5% empty stage weight, leaves 23.2% payload, or 6.6 times as much.  Increasing payload by a factor of 6.6 is worth a little trouble, but only if you have a lot of flights to justify it.  The rotovator mass will be on the order of 100x the payload mass, so you need like 1000 flights to reduce ""elevator mass per flight"" to a low number.  That level of traffic doesn't exist at the moment.   seems to make it almost more trouble than it's worth.   You need to work the actual numbers rather than rely on gut feelings.  Flying tanks of fuel using turbopumps that are near exploding (today's rockets), or for that matter 2000 actual explosions per minute (car engines) would seem ludicrous if we were not used to them."

But the enticing idea behind the geostationary cable type thing is no more launch pads or rockets, couldn't this be viable for smaller bodies, namely a moon space elevator to send things back to earth for almost free?"
space,3e38ei,WWIflyingace62,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"couldn't this be viable for smaller bodies, namely a moon space elevator to send things back to earth for almost free?   Definitely.  Bodies like the Moon, Mars, and the largest asteroid, Ceres, are within the structural capacity of a stationary pick-up and drop off system.  The rotating cable is still less massive and smaller than the stationary one.  From the ground it would look like a cable descending from the sky, with a hook.  You grab on and get hauled into orbit.  Earth is just too massive for that to work, even with carbon nanotubes.  But rockets are not the only way to get sub-orbital.  Hypersonic airbreathing engines or ground accelerators can get you to Mach 5 (1.5 km/s) reasonably, and for bulk materials that don't care about acceleration, you can build hypervelocity guns, like these two.  They have been used for research for decades.  Just build a bigger one on a mountain.  Those can get to half of orbit velocity, and with a rotovator, can eliminate the rocket stage, except for maneuvering thrusters."

You don't build big things like that for a few dozen trips a year, which is what we do today.

space,3e38ei,seanflyon,5,Tue Jul 21 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"what would be the ideal altitude for such a structure to reach?    For a rotating elevator in orbit (i.e a design that's actually feasible), the bottom end would be ~200 km altitude, as low as possible without too much drag, so a sub-orbital vehicle coming to meet it has minimum work to do.  The upper end is then a function of the cable length, g-force at the tip, and tip velocity.   Would it be at risk of space debris tearing it apart?    Yes, but proper design (multiple cross-linked cable strands) can reduce the risk to a maintenance problem.  Yes, debris and meteoroids will hit it, but the damage would be minor and repaired.   What kind of precautions could be taken to ensure its safety?   Safety requirements would be part of the design from the start, and would be considered all through the process, just like any big engineering project.  A margin of safety on strength and lots of redundant cables are the main ones.  But safe design of a passenger pod would be as complicated as making a passenger cabin in an airplane safe.

Rockets are actually quite efficient at getting into orbit, starting with the assuming that you have to carry all your fuel -- energy storage -- with you.    Alternatively, you could use a much, much denser energy storage system.  Denser than chemical propellants would mean nuclear (fission or fusion).  There are plenty of ways to do this, but they tend to be very... dirty.   So, how about not bringing all the fuel/energy with you?  That's the premise of other methods.  In a mass driver, you accelerate up to speed in the driver itself, so your energy is primarily coming from some Earthbound electrical source.  That's good, because you don't have to bring it with you.  On a space elevator, you would ascend using... well, that's not clear, but maybe power beamed up from Earth, so again, an Earthbound electrical source.  In either of those cases, you are not necessarily spending less energy per unit mass of payload, but since you don't need to bring the fuel with you, you save on not having to accelerate all that weight.    One last tweak: In the atmosphere, you can save the weight of the oxidizer (but not of the fuel itself) by breathing air.  So a jet, or a ramjet, or a scramjet can get you started.  You still need to carry your fuel, though.    Short answer, though -- no, we're stuck with rockets, or jet-assisted rockets, or similar tech, for a long time to come."
space,3e304x,wmlloydfloyd,3,Tue Jul 21 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"Hi! May i ask you the difference between jets, ramjets or scramjets? Are they all the same thing? What does it change?"
space,3e304x,Jangalit,5,Tue Jul 21 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"In any jet, the air passing through goes through three stages; compression, combustion, and expansion. In a turbojet, the type of engine on almost all jet aircraft, the compression is done by a series of turbine blades. Fuel is added to the compressed air and combusted, which then forces its way through more turbine blades which are linked to the compressor blades, powering them. The exhaust then expands out the nozzle. In a ramjet, the forward velocity of the engine compresses the air, with no turbines or blades. However, like the turbojet, air inside the combustion chamber must move slower than the speed of sound. In a scramjet, which stands for supersonic combustion ramjet, the fuel is combusted at supersonic speeds, yet the airflow cannot drop to subsonic speeds.  Diagrams: Turbojet Ramjet Scramjet  As for what this means for their applications, the differences are mainly in the speeds where they can work. Turbojets work from a complete stop all the way to supersonic speeds. Ramjets work from supersonic speeds to low hypersonic speeds. Scramjets work from hypersonic speeds all the way to orbital velocity.  There are also different kinds of hybrids, like turboramjets, and dual-mode scramjets, which combine the qualities of different types of jets."

space,3e304x,manbergur,3,Tue Jul 21 21:51:34 2015 UTC,"You would be worried about energy storage to some degree -- you'd still have to carry fuel.  But with a fusion you would get fantastically higher energy from the fuel, so it would certainly be a big improvement.  But it wouldn't just hover.  Think of a rocket: A rocket works because when you throw something backwards (hot gases from combustion), conservation of momentum says you will get pushed forward a little.  I could do the same thing with an office chair and a huge bag of golf balls: For each golf ball I throw to the east, I get a tiny push to the west.  If I had enough golf balls and a strong arm, I could get substantial thrust that way.  This is precisely how rockets work; they just throw huge amounts of hot gases at extremely high velocities.  So your fusion drive still has to eject matter of some sort, with as high a velocity as possible -- indeed, one benefit of a fusion drive would presumably be that you could use extremely high exhaust velocity.  So it would work, yes.  But it wouldn't just be hovering; it would be a huge rocket, hovering, and shooting out extremely fast and hot stuff.  You can't get away from the basic principle."

Guess I was thinking could you gradually lift yourself into space without needing to get to orbital velocities using something powered by fusion?

space,3e304x,manbergur,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:16:48 2015 UTC,"Because that level of thrust is unrealistic.  There's a fundamental tradeoff when it comes to rocketry in that the less fuel efficient the rocket the easier it is to produce thrust, and the more fuel efficient the harder it is to produce thrust. And this relationship very much does not favor efficient rockets. This is because efficiency scales linearly relative to exhaust velocity. And while momentum (aka thrust) also scales linearly with exhaust velocity, kinetic energy scales quadratically.  For example, let's say you have a 1 tonne rocket generating 10 kN of thrust (roughly enough to allow the vehicle to hover) with a 3 km/s exhaust velocity (a typical value for chemical propulsion). In order to do so it would need a mass flow of 3.3 kg/s, and the exhaust would have a ""kinetic power"" equivalent of 14.9 megawatts.  Now if you have a 1 tonne fusion rocket generating 10 kN of thrust with an exhaust velocity of, say, 300 km/s then you need a mass flow of only 0.033 kg/s. Which seems fine. But the exhaust would have a ""kinetic power"" of 1.5 gigawatts. And that's assuming near 100% conversion efficiency. 1.5 gigawatts is a lot, even when it comes to fusion. That's a fusion plant the size of ITER, not some component of a 1 tonne rocket. And consider that a vehicle the size of a small capsule would weigh at least 10 tonnes, a vehicle the size of the Shuttle more like 80 tonnes (requiring 15 and 120 gigawatts, respectively). That's not feasible with any fusion technology we're aware of other than thermonuclear bombs."

Best bet is waiting for Musk or Bezos to come up with a fully reusable system, since the high cost of rockets is almost entirely because the rocket is thrown away after each use. The US Space Shuttle was too expensive because it had too many compromises in its design and funding.  Escape Dynamics has an interesting alternative they are working on. It does not use chemical combustion like current launchers. It uses energy beamed from Earth's surface to superheat the fluid for propulsion. Other's have suggested superheating the air itself, so less fluid needs to be carried."

There are much, much better alternatives that could be developed using today's technology, but unfortunately they all involve the big ""n"" word: nuclear, and so they're never going to become a reality. Just look at how much fuss was kicked up with Cassini did an Earth flyby some fifteen years ago  One proposal, Project Orion, involved using nuclear explosions to propel a massive spaceship into the heavens. Live nukes offer an outrageous amount of delta-v, considering. We're talking, 5,000 tons into LEO from a single launch ... ten times the weight of the entire ISS, in one launch!   Similar technology could theoretically be used to speed a spacecraft up to a considerable fraction of the speed of light (15,000 km/s, or about 0.05c), as shown in this surprisingly detailed technical report of Project Longshot. Really neat stuff. Turns out it would still take nearly 100 years to get there though, unfortunately. (and the probe's information could only be returned at a rate of 1 kilobit per second ... same as New Horizons right now to give you some idea)  There are also thermal nuclear rockets, which don't involve any nukes going off and so it might actually be possible to really make them someday. But unfortunately, they don't offer nearly as many advantages as detonating nukes (but create some more complexity and problems), and so they probably wouldn't completely replace chemical rockets even if they were developed.   There's also scramjets n shit, but they offer their own host of problems when it comes to actually getting something into orbit, and will take years to develop into something practical, at best.   Maybe in 50 years we'll start getting to work on a space elevator or something. It's about the best we can hope for, considering."

Not quite a space elevator, but the cheapest form of what is basically a space elevator. Replace the cable and structure with a huge fucking blimp.

space,3e2i90,epi2mais,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:21 2015 UTC,Thank you for this extra valuable info. As a basic reader though I would wonder why it wouldn't take at least 70 years (10 times the 7 years needed by Cassini) for Voyager 1 to travel that far. Could you please explain like I'm five?
space,3e2i90,wmlloydfloyd,3,Tue Jul 21 14:28:09 2015 UTC,"Well, Cassini is quite big and heavy, for starters.  I also seem to recall that it was originally supposed to be launched from the Shuttle, carrying the probe and a big booster into orbit; this was definitely true of the Galileo probe.  After Shuttle failures, though, NASA wouldn't allow it to carry a large fueled booster in the cargo bay anymore, so they needed to find an alternative launcher, which turned out to be a little underpowered.  Flying by Venus, Venus, Earth, and Jupiter is a cheap but slow way of increasing velocity.  Finally, Cassini entered an orbit around Saturn, so you want it to arrive at a relatively manageable speed -- if you're going too fast, it's that much harder to slow down to enter an orbit.   Voyager was launched on a fast trajectory directly to Jupiter, getting a huge slingshot there, and then Saturn, getting another huge boost, so it picked up a lot of speed.  Since it wasn't intended to enter a local orbit, it's not a problem to fly by more quickly.  It still took a year and a half to get from Jupiter to Saturn, but that really shows you just how fast it was going.   Interestingly, a backup radioisotope generator built for Cassini was used on the New Horizons mission to Pluto.  Those things last a good long time."
space,3e2i90,thelazyreader2015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:31 2015 UTC,Didn't Voyager 2 get a gravity assist from flybys of all four gas/ice giants? Why isn't it even faster than 1?
space,3e2i90,wmlloydfloyd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:03 2015 UTC,"yeah, I wondered about that as well.  I believe that V1's trajectory was based on getting a close approach to Titan, but that required a path past Saturn that took it out of the plane of the solar system so it couldn't then go to Uranus and Neptune.  It's possible that that flyby was exceptionally close/effective, but I'm guessing.    The V2 flybys were targeted not primarily to increase speed, but to put the spacecraft on target for the next planet.  So they probably got a lower slingshot than they would have if they were just going for speed.  A large part of the slingshot is determined by closest approach distance, but that will also change your trajectory, of course."
space,3e2i90,AlpineKnot,3,Tue Jul 21 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"Voyager was going much faster than Cassini because it was a flyby mission, too fast to ever orbit Saturn. Cassini was an orbital mission, which meant that it had to go slower in order to get captured by Saturn's gravity."
space,3e2i90,thelazyreader2015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:28 2015 UTC,Ten times further than Voyager 1 is the inner edge of the Oort Cloud.    Thanks. This makes me think of ion engines that can potentially reach 10 times the speed of Voyager. So maybe some day a nuclear ion powered spacecraft from Earth can eventually make it to the inner edge of the Oort cloud in 37 years?
space,3e2i90,wmlloydfloyd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"That seems a little ambitious to me -- more on a timescale of a Daedelus-style nuclear pulse.   I'm too lazy to do the numbers now, but it's all about how high your thrust is, and how long you can thrust for.  And that is all determined by how much fuel you can carry.  An ion-powered spacecraft can thrust continuously for a long, long time, but also thrusts at a very very low impulse."
space,3e2i90,thelazyreader2015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:30 2015 UTC,"The advantage of ion drives is that they can keep running for months or even years with a small fuel supply whereas a chemical rocket would burn out in 300 seconds or so. This allows them to slowly build up speed and momentum over a long time in space.   And being space, with no atmospheric drag or gravitational disturbances along its planned route, they'll maintain that speed and momentum indefinitely.  So an ion drive powered spacecraft can, by the time its engines run out, potentially accelerate to 10 times Voyager 1's speed and afterwards keep moving at that speed along its trajectory. Eventually it'll go as far as Voyager but in a fraction of the time.   This way it's actually possible to reach the inner Oort cloud in 30-50 years(Voyager 1 will take 300) with present propulsion technology."
space,3e2i90,wmlloydfloyd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"It's true that an ion drive can run for a long, long time.  But an ion drive still has the same problem that a chemical rocket does -- you need to carry the fuel with you.  An ion drive uses very little fuel... but it also has very, very low thrust -- perhaps one ten-thousandth of an equivalent chemical thruster.  So it needs to thrust for a very long time, meaning it still uses a lot of fuel.  The forward momentum is proportional to the mass of the fuel ejected backwards and the velocity at which it's ejected.  The ion drive can achieve extremely high exhaust velocities, which makes it very efficient in fuel ues, but it still does have to eject that fuel.  In addition, the ion drive runs on electrical power, so you need a substantial powerplant.  In deep space, that's gotta be nuclear.  So now you've got an extremely low-thrust drive, pushing a nuclear reactor, and also carrying a massive amount of fuel.  The Dawn spacecraft weighs about 2600 lbs, and started out with over 900 lbs of fuel.  That's better than a chemical rocket would be, but you are still subject to the basic ""rocket equation"" -- the need to carry your fuel with you."
space,3e2i90,thelazyreader2015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:04:07 2015 UTC,"You missed my point.  Ion drives require fuel, yes. But they burn that fuel very slowly, so depending on the design the gas can be made to last months, perhaps even a year.  With a sufficiently high orbital injection velocity to begin with, slow burning of ion thrusters over that period will steadily increase the speed to the extent it is eventually greater than that of Voyager 1.  TL;DR: Depending on the technology, it's possible to build an ion engine that, for the same amount of fuel and small thrust, can in 1 year of continuous operation become 10 times as fast as using a chemical rocket with that same amount of fuel that burned only for 200 seconds,"
space,3e2i90,wmlloydfloyd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:28:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think I missed the point.    They burn fuel very slowly, yes.  But that's because they have crazy low thrust.  It's the equivalent of getting really, really good gas mileage by taking your foot off the pedal and cruising at idle speed.  If the ion drive has a thrust 1/10,000 more than a chemical rocket, it has to thrust for 10,000 times as long.  Certainly an ion drive can eventually accelerate past Voyager 1's speed... as long as it's carrying enough fuel.  But the same is true of a chemical rocket.  The ion drive is just a little more efficient.  In the end, the Dawn spacecraft still started out carrying something like 35% of its total weight in fuel!"
space,3e2i90,thelazyreader2015,2,Tue Jul 21 21:44:20 2015 UTC,"Space is really, really big, isn't it? Voyager 1 is the farthest any spacecraft has ever travelled from Earth, but it'll still need to travel 1000 times as far to actually exit the solar system!  Makes you wonder if mankind will even reach the edge of the Oort cloud before we go extinct; forget about interstellar or intergalactic travel."

space,3e2i90,thinguson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:18:09 2015 UTC,"Given that the Oort cloud is theoretical at this point why do we think the source of long period comets is part of our solar system i.e a cloud and they're not just scattered through interstellar space? It seems, if the outer Oort cloud is supposed to extend half way to the nearest neighbouring star,  then the distinction is very fine."
space,3e2i90,OllieMarmot,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"With our current understanding of solar system formation, all significant icy or rocky bodies in space came together as a protoplanetary disc that forms around a star very early in the stars life. The gravity of the star is necessary to bring all of the scattered molecules in interstellar space together close enough that local gravity can form clumps. It's currently believed that all of the bodies making up the Oort cloud formed much closer in to the sun where all the rest of the matter is concentrated and were pushed outward by gravitational interference from the much larger planets. Without that pull of a star, there is no way for enough matter to come together in interstellar space to form clumps, it would just be clouds of molecular hydrogen, water, or simple organics like we see in big diffuse gas clouds around the galaxy. It's likely that there are icy chunks that get ejected from a solar system completely after forming and float around, but they would have had to originally form close to a star, and it's more likely the comets we see formed around our star rather than another one, although it is possible some small percentage of comets and other icy stuff out there originally formed around a different star and was picked up by ours during a close pass."

Both are examples of prior projects being terminated/cancelled/retired with new projects still on the drawing boards, leaving years and years in between with no US-based launches.  And, for all the hate the Space Shuttle gets, this really does show how good it was at getting people up into space at unprecedented numbers"

The shuttle was also intended as a cargo program, and thus it had to send up crew, even when it was during a pure payload mission.   That seriously drove up the cost and risks."
space,3e17bo,10ebbor10,12,Tue Jul 21 10:16:59 2015 UTC,"The Space Shuttle did its job well - albeit at unnecessarily high cost and risk due to political decisions made in its development.  That's why the peak year for humans in space is still 1985.  If Congress doesn't strangle the commercial crew program in its crib, there's a good chance we can surpass 1985 in the next decade.  The record is 63 people in a year.  Dragon 2 and CST-100 both support a crew of 7, and Dragon 2 at least will be pursuing fully commercial launches in addition to NASA ones.    So they could pass the mark with full-complements if one launched 4 and the other 5 times in a year.  With operating costs vastly lower than Shuttle in both cases, that shouldn't be a budget problem unless Congress deliberately makes it one."
space,3e17bo,10ebbor10,3,Tue Jul 21 07:20:18 2015 UTC,"Thing is, while we can probably exceed the number in a decade, what reason do we have?  The shuttle had to launch that many people every time it intended to do a cargo mission."
space,3e17bo,TbonerT,3,Tue Jul 21 10:20:42 2015 UTC,"It didn't have to launch more than a pilot and copilot.  But I take your point - delivering cargo presented the opportunity for five more astronauts to tag along, since their added mass was trivial in comparison.  One of the hoped-for destinations would be inflatable Bigelow stations.  They're sending up an experimental module for the station this year, and Bigelow has hinted that he has some money lined up if that goes well.  Otherwise it would just be going into space in free-flights for science or for tourism.  Remember, the costs are going to be way lower than Shuttle or even Soyuz, so the launches won't have to justify themselves nearly as much."
space,3e17bo,rocketsocks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:27:31 2015 UTC,"Their added mass was far from trivial. When you're paying $8,000/lb that comes out to over $7,000,000 just to send the extra mass into space.

If the US had been spending 8 billion a year on Saturn Ib, Atlas, or Titan launches using expendable capsules instead of using the Shuttle, it would be easy to match those numbers. The Shuttle was a cool vehicle, awe inspiring even, but that was if anything a down side. It made it more difficult to cancel the program earlier even though it should have been, and it made it easier to overlook its inherent safety flaws which ultimately doomed two crews and crippled US manned spaceflight capability at one of the least convenient times to do so."

After Gagarins flight, there was a rush the get an American to space also, however at the time there wasn't a rocket powerful enough to get into orbit. So a month later Shepard completed his sub-orbital spaceflight and caught up to the Soviets. In reality the flight was just a quick dip above the atmosphere.

space,3e17bo,afd33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:56:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree that China's rise is exaggerated in the media, but my point about the US Congress is that they're mainly only concerned with the profits of specific companies in a given sector rather than the US economy or technological status as a whole.  The US lost 100% of its marketshare in the commercial launch sector in the '00s, but Congress didn't care because ULA remained highly profitable through US government contracts.  Then SpaceX regained half of that marketshare, and Congress's disposition toward it tends to be anywhere from mildly skeptical to bitterly hostile, despite how overwhelmingly important it is to the US launch sector.  So if China started doing big things in space, I don't think Congress would be motivated beyond making some speeches and claiming that it proved projects they already supported were crucial.  Fortunately or unfortunately (depending on your perspective), China has its own Byzantine political system to contend with, so no one would want to take responsibility for putting the entire country on an Apollo-like path.  Any failure at all in a such program would literally mean the person deemed responsible for pushing it could be convicted of corruption and executed."

The light reflected off the planet is usually too dim when compared to its sun to detect it directly.

Ask NASA and they'll tell you it's a space weather observatory that takes some pictures of Earth sometimes. It was actually built for another purpose.  This spacecraft was built in 2000, after being championed by Al Gore. He envisioned a camera at L1 that could image the entire planet at once, specifically for studies of global climate change. It was built and tested, and almost ready for launch until George W. Bush was elected president. It sat in storage for 14 years waiting out the Bush administration, because when G.W. took over, his people didn't want a climate observatory in space confirming global warming.   It was derided as frivolous and even called ""Goresat"" for a long time. Essentially, enough people with political connections killed it by mocking it, trying to undermine its usefulness, and quietly taking money away from the project. After the budget for the mission was eliminated, the people who built it stashed it in a storage container filled with nitrogen to preserve it until they could get it launched. These two articles (1 and 2) go into detail about DSCOVR's fight to the launch pad.  Even now, NASA and NOAA are cagey about the mission's original purpose -- a study of global climate. Politics kept it on the ground for a long time, and I'm happy to see it finally flying. But I wish that NASA and NOAA didn't have to be all cloak-and-dagger about it. This spacecraft will help prove the science that most people already understand -- our climate is changing, and being a petulant child like so many climate deniers will not change that.  The solar weather observations are actually the afterthought (as important as they are). Taking pictures like this is what DSCOVR was built for. Hopefully both of its missions will help enlighten those who have thought looking the other way would prove them right."

space,3dzru1,worth_the_monologue,3,Tue Jul 21 06:22:21 2015 UTC,"Lagrange Point Diagram  Wikipedia - Lagrangian Point   In celestial mechanics, the Lagrangian points; (also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are positions in an orbital configuration of two large bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two large bodies. The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. There are five such points, labeled L1 to L5, all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies. The first three are on the line connecting the two large bodies and the last two, L4 and L5, form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies. The two latter points are stable, which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies.   TLDR: Lagrangian Points allow spacecraft to stay in one place relative to two large bodies.  The L1 point is between the Earth and the Sun.  The pull from both bodies and centripetal force from being in orbit cancels out."

Once the instrument begins regular data acquisition, new images will be available every day, 12 to 36 hours after they are acquired by EPIC. These images will be posted to a dedicated web page by September.      The satellite was launched in February and recently reached its planned orbit at the first Lagrange point or L1, about one million miles from Earth toward the sun. It’s from that unique vantage point that the EPIC instrument is acquiring science quality images of the entire sunlit face of Earth.  Data from EPIC will be used to measure ozone and aerosol levels in Earth’s atmosphere, cloud height, vegetation properties and the ultraviolet reflectivity of Earth.

It also is probably much less comfortable, almost certainly lacking the climate control and life support systems that are in the newer suits. It's also my understanding that the newer suits also have some degree of armor in them, to protect from minor debris and accidents. The G4-C was basically a 'pop out, float around, smile, jump back in' affair. The newer space suits they spend upwards of 6 hours in doing work.  EDIT: Also something I forgot: the suits are unpressurized. They balloon up. The more modern suits have a more rigid structure and are 'pre-ballooned'. That one suit has Mad Max shoulder armor because of some issue with pressure in the arm when it was rotated. I assume it was causing a 'twist' which would seal off the arm, which would limit mobility as the air inside couldn't go anywhere. The more rigid-framed suits probably don't have these issues since you're not just wearing a big bag.  Here's the G4C in action. Almost looks nothing like the deflated model. https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/s65-30427.jpg"

Black holes evaporate and slowly lose mass--in a system with just a planet orbiting a black hole, the planet would slowly spiral out as the black hole loses mass due to Hawking Radiation.    In practice, some objects get thrown in by gravitational interaction--same as how comets sometimes fall into the sun because they get flung by gravitational interaction with the outer planets into it."

The black hole at the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A, is a supermassive black hole, formed from the merging of multiple black holes.  As a result it has much greater mass and gravity than a ""normal"" black hole, but it still behaves the same way. Pretty much everything in the galaxy is in a stable orbit around the black hole, so it isn't being sucked in."

ISRO launched MOM as an exercise in interplanetary missions first, and a science data gathering second. I am sure that ISRO will launch firsts in the near future, but not yet.

That's part of why the software wasn't set to deploy the parachutes, it was assumed that any catastrophic failure would destroy the capsule without the LES, so adding chute deployment after catastrophic failure would be redundant. The cargo capsule has been shown to be rather more resilient than expected, and the failure mode was less destructive than expected, so adding the software to the cargo capsule makes sense.  As far as being a leap forward, having a LES is something every other man-rated spacecraft EXCEPT the shuttle has had. It's less a leap forward than a return from a really bad design decision. Especially when you consider that the Challenger cabin likely survived the explosion and the astronauts were only killed when it impacted the ocean."

space,3dzdrc,sirbruce,-2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:25 2015 UTC,"I am really concerned by this.  Can anyone else shed some light on my concerns?   Going forward, SpaceX will switch strut suppliers and will test each and every strut prior to installation on the Falcon 9.   First, this seems reactive, not proactive.  ANY mission critical element could fail, so shouldn't they be testing all mission critical elements?  If they aren't, then shouldn't they be testing more than just the struts?  And what will this add to the time and cost of launches?  Second, I'm concerned that a single helium tank is mission critical.  I realize weight and space are factors, but aren't redundant helium tanks a good idea?  Lose one, whether by strut failure or some other issue, and the upper stage is still good to go.  Third, even if you have no redundancy, all this should mean is that the fuel flow is no longer sufficient in the upper stage, leading to reduced performance.  So maybe the engine cuts off early and doesn't reach desired orbit.  Maybe even the engine doesn't fire at all.  But how did this lead to loss of vehicle?"
space,3dzdrc,lordkrike,2,Tue Jul 21 11:07:40 2015 UTC,"Second, I'm concerned that a single helium tank is mission critical. I realize weight and space are factors, but aren't redundant helium tanks a good idea? Lose one, whether by strut failure or some other issue, and the upper stage is still good to go.   The failure was not caused by underpressure by loss of a single helium tank.  The failure was caused by overpressure from a helium tank leaking after its strut failed.  The oxidizer tank went from low to very high pressure in a matter of moments and failed.   Preliminary failure arose from a strut in the second stage liquid oxygen tanks that was holding down one composite helium bottle used to pressurize the stage. High pressure helium bottles are pressurized at 5500 psi, stored inside in LOX tank. Several helium bottles in upper stage. At ~3.2 g, one of those struts snapped and broke free inside the tank. Buoyancy increases in accordance with G-load. Released lots of helium into LOX tank. Data shows a drop in the helium pressure, then a rise in the helium pressure system. Quite confusing. As helium bottle broke free and pinched off manifold, restored the pressure but released enough helium to cause the LOX tank to fail. It was a really odd failure mode.    This was not an issue with a lack of redundancy as much as a major pressure vessel failure.  Saturn V would have failed similarly."
space,3dzdrc,sirbruce,-3,Tue Jul 21 11:31:12 2015 UTC,"The oxidizer tank went from low to very high pressure in a matter of moments and failed.   Ahh, okay.  That was not in the news article I read.   This was not an issue with a lack of redundancy as much as a major pressure vessel failure.   So it's a mission critical element you can't make redundant.  Got it.  Should have been tested from the start, then.  What other mission critical elements do they not test?   Saturn V would have failed similarly.   We should be able to make rockets much safer and more reliable today."
space,3dzdrc,lordkrike,2,Tue Jul 21 14:13:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's somewhat forgivable in that the strut failed at 20% of its rated force. That's a serious exception to quality control.  Sure, the onus is on SpaceX to verify that their suppliers are actually providing products as advertised, but the calculus of risk management would definitely lean toward the failure of that part as highly unlikely.  It wouldn't get a lot of attention compared to other, more high-risk components.  You can't control for all failure possibilities all the time.  You identify high risk and high likelihood failures and deal with them first.  Items that can't be made redundant are usually highly tested... Unless the probability of failure is assumed to be extremely low.  Edit: Also, on that note, the Saturn V was highly reliable.  ANY launch system would have failed here... It's a highly unlikely failure mode."

It wouldn't get a lot of attention compared to other, more high-risk components.   If that were true, then there would no need to now test every strut every time; ""the calculus of risk management"" wouldn't allow for it.  And yet, they are, so that again prompts the question, what OTHER critical elements are they not testing, and why aren't the testing those if ""the calculus of risk management"" no longer applies.  That's why I said it seems like they are simply being reactive.   Also, on that note, the Saturn V was highly reliable.   I don't think we can say that; it didn't fly enough missions to be statistically valid (STS had way more successful launches -- until it didn't).  But two flights suffered engine failures and another was hit by lightning.,, not a good track record."
space,3dzdrc,lordkrike,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"Once you've seen a failure that you previously assumed was improbable to the point of being ignorable that caused a loss, obviously you will reevaluate the risk.  That's natural.  The parts were batch tested, and now will be individually tested because the probability of failure is considered more likely.  It was presumed that batch testing was enough to control the risk; clearly that was wrong and now they are increasing controls.  Every space agency works this way.  Some certainly have lower amounts of acceptable risk, but the principles are basically identical.  Also, all three of those anomalies for Saturn V's still had successful missions.  That gives a good indication for safety for Bayesians."
space,3dzdrc,sirbruce,-4,Tue Jul 21 14:44:51 2015 UTC,"Once you've seen a failure that you previously assumed was improbable to the point of being ignorable that caused a loss, obviously you will reevaluate the risk. That's natural.   But they didn't reevaluate the risk and make a decision; they reactively decided to simply test all such struts in the future.   Every space agency works this way.   Yes, NASA is notoriously reactive, not fixing shit until after astronauts die.  I don't think this is helping your argument.   Also, all three of those anomalies for Saturn V's still had successful missions.   That's not the same as the spacecraft being reliable, which is what we were discussing.

However, I understand their reasoning behind it: all the ones they had tested worked, and how hard is it to mess up making a strut when you make thousands and thousands of them perfectly? Ultimately they shouldn't have taken the supplier's word and tested them themselves, but in an effort to make the most affordable rocket possible they took a risk and unfortunately it didn't pay off the way they hoped. But in their defense, I don't think a failure like this has every happened on a (major) launch vehicle before, usually it's something complicated like the engines."

Is that what they're going to say to the spouses and children of the deceased when astronauts are onboard and a rocket fails? Because, just like the Shuttle, it's probably going to happen someday. It is their distinct responsibility for each and every component on that spacecraft no matter where it originated and my hope is that this was just lazy communication and not an official statement.   Edit: I don't care about downvotes so have at it if that's how you feel, I just would like someone to honestly explain what is wrong with I said.

Elon is stopping the buck at SpaceX. He recognizes that they may have become complacent in some regards due to their success rate thus far, and as a result of this is going to increase the max force rating of the new struts they decide to go with and implement more rigorous in house hardware quality testing and relying less on manufacturer certification.   You also can't even remotely compare this to Challenger's o-ring. In that instance, there were known concerns of the o-ring design and the fact that a failure would likely not allow for a safe abort. They chose to keep flying rather than ground the shuttles until the issue was fixed. In this instance, yes it was a third-party component, but it failed at 2,000 lbs of force instead of the 10,000 lbs of force it was rated for by the manufacturer due to an issue with grain structure in the steel. They had to test an ""enormous number"" (he didn't give an actual number) of struts to be able to replicate failures at 2,000 lbs. Given how few struts were affected and the fact that thousands of the struts have already flown without any sign of an issue, it's hard to say there was anything remotely negligent, which cannot be said about the Challenger disaster.   As for a failure while astronauts are onboard Dragon, that is really a non-issue here. The Dragon Crew capsule will have a launch abort system that will outrun failures even more catastrophic than this, and to speak to the solid design of the craft, the dragon cargo capsule in this instance continued communicating until it dipped below the horizon and was out of range, and would have likely been recoverable if it was able to deploy its shoots, which is a software modification they are already planning to implement.

From a layman's standpoint, they're going to have a huge atmosphere and lots of mass, so lots of gravity. As you get deeper into the atmosphere, the pressure and heat increase. Go deep enough, and the gas turns to liquid.  Different gases go liquid at different pressures and temperatures, so you'll get regions where it rains, as some parts are gas and some parts liquid.  Keep going deeper, and you'll get some parts liquid and some parts solid, assuming you've got a big enough gas giant. I read a few years ago that Jupiter probably has a diamond core.   No math involved, but does that basically answer your question? Its basically gravity and heat. The outer edge is gas, turning to liquid as you get deeper(a lot deeper ) , turning eventually to either a solid or liquid core depending in the gravity (mass) and heat. The liquid and gases are continually churning up and down, left and right, etc, continually replenishing the upper layers, like earth on a vast scale. And that keeps it all going."

Not enormously dense by the standards of the inner planets, but still massively dense by nebula and vacuum standards.  Nebula are incredibly diffuse, 100-10,000 particles per cm3 according to the folks over at Physics Stack Exchange, so much so that if you were in the interior of one the pretty much the only way would be able to tell would be by looking at the spectrum of other stars to see what emission lines had been adsorbed by the nebula's dust and gasses."
space,3e0yg8,7LeagueBoots,3,Tue Jul 21 04:22:26 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you can find the answers on a scientific website. Here I can summarize the main points. The main difference is that gas giants are planets that are made up of different layer of gases bound together by gravity and formed during formation of the solar system. A nebula is a gaseous cloud that resulted from the supernova of massive stars and is the place for new stars or star systems to be born. A nebula is in form of a cloud, less dense than a gas giant but in total contains much more material than that in a gas giant. Gas giants are formed on similar principles to the sun, difference is that the sun is much much denser and bigger allowing for nuclear fusion to start between its helium. Gas giants are assumed to have a solid core made out of gases that are compressed together at immense pressure. Coming back to the main point, gases that are bound together in a loose gravity field of a nebula has no definite shape just as clouds on earth. Overtime, built up of gases in different regions create different zones of gravity within the cloud and as more gaseous substances are added, the zones eventually accumulate enough material to form an infant star. The stars then form their own star systems and whatever material left are accumulated into planets and some become gas giants as in our solar system.   Source: I took IB Physics HL with Astronomy as my Options."
space,3e0yg8,dailoc,2,Tue Jul 21 03:16:44 2015 UTC,"A nebula is unimaginable sparse.The density is no where on the same magnitude in both density, mass and properties. A gas giant has so much pressure at it's core, hydrogen in it is solid. So in a sense, yes Jupiter has a rocky core."
space,3e0yg8,Mindmaster107,2,Tue Jul 21 04:17:01 2015 UTC,My own take is that in a gas/dust cloud you will get objects of all sizes form sans stars. Some of these will have enough mass to reach fusion ignition and become stars and others drift out before reaching any appreciable size. Some rocky bodies probably get drowned in gas and become Neptunes and Jupiters and lose their rocky core heritage.  I just find it counterintuative that you need a stellar system to form rocky bodies or Jupiter class gas giants. Collapsing gas clouds are all good and fine but you need some kind of seed just like rain needs atmospheric soot or something to form a raindrop.  The recent finds of brown dwarfs wandering the galaxy as rogues just convinces me more that there are smaller dark bodies wandering around in interstellar space.

And from that point onward there are cycles of deaths and creations of stars. Dead stars blow away their crusts to create new materials as in a nebula for new ones. Gas giants planet might be out of the blast radius and will survive the process but will be pushed into the void of space as you mentioned."

Up near the edge of sustainability sizewise (according to our theories) at around 120times the size of our sun. It was perhaps initially 150 times the size of the sun but it has shed the rest of its mass in events like the one show. It is unstable and emits vast amounts of its mass each day compared to our sun. Its instabality is shown in that, over time, it has varied significantly in visibility. From invisible to the eye (as of now) to, in 1843, the second brightest star in the sky. It got this brightness due an 'explosion' sorta like a failed or mini-supernova that emitted vast amounts of radiation, light and mass. I'm not expert enough to analyse the image precisely but what you see is the corona of ejected mass surrounding the star, possibly as a result of the 1843 event. This is a false colour image and you wouldnt actually see it like that with the naked eye."

space,3e0pya,stephONcurry,7,Tue Jul 21 02:24:45 2015 UTC,"Supernovae are exploding stars which are broadly classified into two main types depending on the type of star which explodes. The progenitors of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa) is a white dwarf accreting matter from a companion, while the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae are massive stars at the end of their lives.  Supernovae are transient objects. They appear suddenly as a bright star (that can outshine an entire galaxy) at a random position in the sky, and fade relatively quickly never to be seen again. For this reason they are difficult objects to find and study, and astronomers have now established several supernova searches dedicated to locating new supernovae and obtaining rapid and extensive follow-up observations of these objects."

We can actually see too that the massive growth in GDP and in raw federal budget is also accountable for the drop in % of NASA with regard to GDP and federal budget, despite raw inflation-adjusted dollars for NASA staying steady or even increasing between 1974 and 1986. Indeed, the late 80s and early 90s sees a large spike in NASA inflation-adjusted spending but a much smaller bump in %'s.  Good work!"

I think you'll find that NASA's budget is, and has been for some time, 70% of the Apollo level.  That's a lot of money.  Over all the years of the shuttle program, we spent enough money to do Apollo 4 times over again, but we haven't a single flight beyond Earth Orbit to show for the expenditure.  Surely we could have gone to Mars by now, if only NASA had been directed toward that goal.  We haven't gone to Mars, not because we don't have the money, but because we chose to spend the money on other things."

In which case wouldn't a beacon of light be easier to do, and let them come to us? A light beacon would illicit something strange is going on, hence they would come to investigate the ""anomoly"".

As I understand it, the current SETI search is really only set up to find civilizations that are actively trying to communicate. If we assume that such civilizations exist, radio signals are actually a pretty good thing to look for, maybe even more so than visible light.  So, why is radio attractive?   Radio waves are great at penetrating thick atmospheres, so a strong signal would be able to reach ground-based observatories on a variety of different worlds. Places like Titan that are shrouded in a perpetual haze that scatters out visible light from point sources would still be able to detect a radio signal from the surface. Certain bands on the radio spectrum are especially clear of interference, making it easier to resolve a signal against the natural cosmic background noise (this is often referred to as The Water Hole). When using radio, there's a good chance that your signal could be picked up 'accidentally' by another scientifically curious civilization. Neutral hydrogen likes to naturally emit EM radiation on a particular radio band (1420MHz, to be exact), and since the universe is made up primarily of hydrogen, any civilization actively engaged in radio astronomy is all but guaranteed to be listening on that frequency, increasing your chances of getting their attention with a 1420MHz signal."

Longer wavelength are generally better at penetrating stuff, so they might be preferable as they are not blocked by gas clouds, for example. And why are our radio broadcasts weak? It's possible to put huge amounts of power into a radio broadcast. The only benefit I can think of for using shorter wavelength is that it's easier to get a higher directivity of our ""beacon"". So we get a higher power into one direction, but much less into the other. But ""light beacon"" sounds as if you wanted to have a low directivity (radiating into every direction).

Our radio signals are weak because they weren't designed for extra-solar broadcast.   It may not even be reasonably possible for us to broadcast a signal strong enough to be distinguished at great distance.

So then; of the ETI around us that we can communicate with, there should be a vaguely uniform distribution spanning from  ""50 years behind us"", to ""many billions of years ahead of us"", with the staggering majority being ""billions of years ahead of us"".   There's no reason to think of an ""evenly matched"" ETI as movies depict: fiction, written to make interesting stories out of interstellar wars. Conflicts between evenly-matched forces are interesting; conflicts where both sides have a fighting chance; where the tide of war ebbs and flows frighteningly; where the strategies actually matter.  Instant defeat by an incomprehensible force is not interesting.  What happens if they don't like us is a question there's no point in asking. The important question is, why are we still alive?"

The only thing I could see being worth coming to Earth's surface for would be the nuclear materials we've created.  If they don't like us as we are, they might try to change us culturally to be like them.

It's difficult enough looking at planets in our own galaxy (indeed, as New Horizons has demonstrated, even objects in our own solar system).  Now, looking at planets in our galaxy can be done. We can infer their position based on star wobbles and dips in star light. Getting an actual picture of them, on the other hand, is tough; the star light will usually blot out the light reflected from the planet. Usually, but not always; we do have tricks up our sleeves.  Ultimately though, visual confirmation of life is probably never going to happen by looking at another planet. That's why we listen and glean rather than just straight-up look; there's more information, and better information, in the non-visual parts of the spectrum. For example, if a planet passes in front of a star, we can measure the light and figure out what the atmosphere of the planet is made out of. If there's a ton of methane, or byproducts similar to the byproducts of human industry, that's a big clue. We can also point our big ol' dishes at them and listen for radio signals.  Though, it's going to take some pretty solid evidence before the majority of scientists nod their heads in agreement that life exists on some distant planet.

From the diffraction limit equation, the necessary baseline of a telescope array to see something as small as 1000km on these planets would be like:  500e-9/(1e6/(12*9.5e15))  or 57 kilometers.

Of course it's still in the extremely early stages and could very well be impossible, but NASA is looking into it."
space,3e4p43,Vakuza,-3,Wed Jul 22 00:58:58 2015 UTC,Nothing can go faster than light.   Why? What equation prevents this?
space,3e4p43,tptguy83,-2,Wed Jul 22 03:08:50 2015 UTC,E = mc2  c = sqrt(E/m)  The mass would either have to approach 0 or energy would have to approach infinity to reach the speed of light.
space,3e4p43,Vakuza,-2,Wed Jul 22 03:24:40 2015 UTC,"Isn't c a constant though? I thought it was how we calculate the energy of mass.  There is also the problem of eccentricity decay of orbits if that were the case due to higher speed at perigee and thus much higher attraction, but our galactic black hole seems to still have several large stars orbiting in highly elliptical fashions. It would also mean elliptical orbits would have greater amounts of energy or mass at perigee even if nothing interacts with the object which is breaking the law of physics.  Nvm E is kinetic energy."

No an alcubierre drive doesn't presently exist in physical form, but the mathematical rationale does.  And no ship goes anywhere near C as of the present.

You aren't being mean, you just aren't arguing your point with any validity.    In an Alcubierre Drive You aren't actually moving faster than light, but you would arrive faster than light, while not violating relativity, nor going backwards in time.   If you traveled ten light years, while going effectively 10c it would take you a year to get there.  You would experience that year, the same as would an observer.  (Ignoring time dilation based on gravitational forces.)    If you immediately travelled back, you would arrive two years older than when you left home initially, and everyone you left would be two years older as well."

Edit:  But yeah, if you did go even closer to C, you could get there on Saturday.  The purpose of doing it from within a warp drive allows you to get there 10 times faster than if you were just travelling close to C."

Or, at least, that's what the argument is. I don't personally subscribe to that belief, but I do think it's important to note that the bodies in the solar system (like all of nature, really) didn't do us the favor of dividing themselves up into neatly defined categories.  Every time you draw a line between two groups of objects, you find something that straddles that line.  So really, if we listed all the solar system bodies by mass, we would see one huge object that clearly stands in its own category - the sun - and then four objects that inhabit roughly the same group - the gas giants. After a big gap, you'd find Earth, followed closely by Venus, then Mars, Mercury, Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, Io, the Moon, Europa, Triton, Eris, Pluto, and so on. (*edit: fixed the order).  Anyways, no more good gaps exists from earth all the way down to specks of dust. So we have to start coming up with other rules, about hydrostatic equilibrium, whether they orbit the sun or some other body, and finally this nasty little thing of ""clearing its orbital neighborhood.""  But things are not uniform even for that requirement. Put Mercury out in the Kuiper belt and see if it can clear that orbit. Or nudge Mars closer to Jupiter and see what Jupiter's tidal forces do to it. Pluto and Ceres are just victims of circumstance really.  So the main argument I guess I'm getting at here is that, yes, Pluto is a dwarf and we're not. But that doesn't mean we are somehow drastically different from Pluto or any of the dwarfs. We're just floating along on the biggest of the smaller pebbles that are hanging out around our sun."

space,3duoy5,Rkupcake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:44:29 2015 UTC,"The problem is, the IAU definition has no word for ""gravitationally rounded object orbiting the sun"" - which is the common vernacular meaning of ""planet"". It certainly seems like a useful category to have a name for. But nope, the IAU has no word for that.  The current IAU definition of ""planet"" should be renamed ""major planet"", and then use ""planet"" to describe anything that's a major planet or dwarf planet. The current compromise of ""we'll put planet in its name but it's not actually a planet"" is stupid."

I certainly agree that the terrestrial bodies and the giants should have different designations. They are different enough from each other to warrant it. Having said that, the dwarf planet designation makes sense. As a category, they are different enough from the classical planets to warrant a category.  We do have other IAU categories too. Small bodies are objects that do not meet the criteria of a dwarf planet. Plutiods are trans-neptunion dwarf planets similar to Pluto.  We need a nice set of overlapping IAU categories. It's almost impossible to have entirely separate categories for everything. The main problem is that people tend to get really personal when it comes to this stuff. Is the Earth/Luna system a binary planet? Currently? No, even though Luna would most certainly be called a planet if it wasn't sharing an orbit with Earth.   The commonly accepted definition for a binary or double system is two objects that orbit a common barycenter sitting outside of either object. But then you should consider the Sol/Jupiter system to be binary system. Pluto/Charon most certainly.  See what I mean?"

As it stands, the IAU has no word for ""gravitationally rounded object orbiting the sun"" that covers both what are currently defined as planets and dwarf planets.  I totally agree that dwarf planets are a separate category from major planets. But I think it would be useful to have a name for the superset that includes both.   Right now, ""Planet"" means ""classical planet""   No, it doesn't. Classical planet includes the sun and the moon, and not Uranus or Neptune. The IAU did consider redefining ""classical planet"" to mean the 8 currently-accepted planets, but that proposal failed. I realize this is a technicality, but I think it's fair given the context - calling the 8 planets ""classical planets"" is not endorsed by the IAU, much like how calling Pluto a planet isn't endorsed by them either."
space,3duoy5,KeytarVillain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"It all stems from the ""Classical Planets"", even if we have modified what ""planet"" means over the years. That's part of the problem.  Pluto was only recently considered a planet, and it's different enough to be considered it's own category. Uranus and Neptune are similar enough to Jupiter and Saturn to be considered in the same category. (As in, large gas giants. Or classically, Planets). The IAU definition of a planet was specifically designed to be inclusive of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.   Or specifically: https://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf  (1) A planet^1 is a celestial body that     (a) is in orbit around the Sun,     (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and     (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. (2) A ""dwarf planet"" is a celestial body that     (a) is in orbit around the Sun,     (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape^2,     (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and     (d) is not a satellite. (3) All other objects^3, except satellites, orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as ""Small Solar System Bodies"".   1 The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 2 An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects to the dwarf planet or to another category. 3 These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.  The IAU further resolves:     Pluto is a ""dwarf planet"" by the above definition and is recognized as the prototype of a new category of Trans-Neptunian Objects.    But this is really getting well beyond the point of what I was trying to say...    As it stands, the IAU has no word for ""gravitationally rounded object orbiting the sun"" that covers both what are currently defined as planets and dwarf planets.   I agree 100% that the language and categorization needs much better formalization. The main problem is that until recently... we just didn't have many things to categorize. You had stars, which were different enough to be their own thing. Then you had all the other stuff with paths through the sky that we could actually follow... and these got called ""planets"". (Ex, classical planets... including Sol).  The word ""planet"" has been stretched too far without breaking it into smaller categories. If you consider Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars to be ""Terrestrial Planets"", Jupiter to be a ""Jovian Planet"", and Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to be ""Gas Giants"". One can then just say ""Planet"" to be inclusive of Dwarf planets too. I would really love to see something like this happen formally, because honestly? Earth and Jupiter are only remotely alike.   For an inclusive term, we do have ""Solar System Bodies"". It may not be as simple to say, but certainly works for being inclusive.   The main problem is that were the IAU to start changing the categorization system in meaningfully drastic ways, people get personal about it. Instead of breaking things down categorically... they could only make changes for things that are different or new enough to warrant a new term. The whole dwarf planet thing came up because we didn't even have a formal definition of Planet in the first place. The drama that followed is a big example of why things didn't get categorized better."
space,3duoy5,ghostopera,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:38:29 2015 UTC,"I think we should also start talking about Pluto-Charon as if they are a binary planet. Because that is also an important factor in the debate over Pluto's status. Arguing whether Pluto is a planet or a dwarf seems odd when the most notable thing about it (compared to Eris and Ceres) is that its part of a binary. That binary has moons that orbit it, rather than orbiting Pluto."

space,3du32l,Larrdawg,1329,Sun Jul 19 14:01:35 2015 UTC,"Since a whole bunch of people have already commented on decreasing the US military budget in this thread, a popular notion whenever a post in this sub on NASA's spending levels is brought up, I think a lot of people miss out on actual spending levels in the US.  Let me preface this by saying that I'm a big supporter of NASA getting more funding, and would love if NASA had a more focused mission plan on board instead of becoming the political battleground it has become for Congress. That said, a lot of the discussions regarding their budget make it sound like it is an either-or situation regarding funding.  For one, as big as the US military budget is (around $600-640 billion this past year), it's not even the second largest budget item on the federal budget. In fact, it is the third largest, behind Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid, which are primarily benefitting only the elderly demographic of the US.  Indeed, as a % of the federal budget, you'll see that when NASA peaked in the early 60s, the US was spending over 50% of its budget on the military, compared to less than 20% today.  The raw values are misleading too. The US spends a lot because our GDP is the largest in the world, by far. For instance, as a % of GDP, the US is at 3.5%, not even good for being in the top 10% in the world. Compare that to the 60's during NASA's peak, when the US spent over 10% of its GDP.  People bring up education too and highlight how little the federal government spends on education. It's true, the US federal government spends very little on education - but that's because state and local government spends money on education. In fact, state and local spends the most on education, putting the US at over 5-6% of its GDP on education alone (nearly twice that of the military too), far more than most nations in the world.  In fact, the US is only behind Austria, Switzerland, and Norway in terms of money spent per student, and the US has had better scores than Austria but worse than Switzerland and Norway.  Furthermore, people all too quickly forget the connection between NASA and the US Military. The peak in NASA spending in the 60s is no coincidence - this was the height of the Cold War, and both the US and Soviet Union wanted to show their technological dominance, and space was the obvious answer. Both saw military considerations from space, and saw it important to demonstrate their capabilities.  Indeed, the first astronauts were all sent into space on converted ICBMs originally designed to launch nuclear weapons around the world. The first astronauts were all military officers as well. And, many of NASA's aerospace projects have been related to military aviation. It's a big reason why NASA only hires US citizens - space is highly dual-use with the military.  Furthermore, the US space budget is more than just NASA. There is considerable overlap between the US agencies and departments when it comes to space. For one, the US actually spends over $60 billion a year on space: over $40 billion of which goes to defense-related projects.  However, that budget has huge applications outside of the military:   The US Air Force Space Command monitors all space debris in orbit, something critical for every NASA launch of every type. The US Air Force is also in charge of operating, maintaining, researching and testing GPS satellites (including the new GPS-III satellites), each of which cost over half a billion each. GPS is free to use for civilians. The National Geo-spatial Intelligence Agency isn't just a spy agency - they also print aviation and nautical maps and charts for the millions of planes and ships in use every day. This includes aviation instrument approach plates for the safe flying of aviation of all kinds of instrument conditions. The US DoD does joint projects with NASA on aviation. For instance, the X-51 was an Air Force project that had collaboration with NASA and DARPA to demonstrate hypersonic flight. Speaking of budget overlap, the US DOD may need a weather satellite (important for aviation and nautical assets) that is purchased and launched on the DOD budget but maintained under NOAA's budget. Also, there are indirect benefits. For instance, the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets were purchased/designed under the DOD's budget. However, New Horizons was launched on an Atlas V rocket - that project would have cost a lot lot more if NASA needed to design its own rocket. Most of NASA's astronauts - past and present - have been military. NASA utilizes a lot of DOD training facilities to train its astronauts, such as the gravity centrifuge. In fact, all NASA astronaut candidates with non-military-aviation backgrounds go through abbreviated flight school syllabuses with the US Air Force and US Navy to familiarize them with aviation knowledge, terminology, and experience.   Simply talking about cutting military spending and giving it to NASA forgets that so much of that budget directly helps NASA already.  It's no coincidence that the three nations with independent human spaceflight - Russia, the US, and China - have historically had the highest military budgets.  Edit: holy cow, thanks for the gold!"

You really hit on a lot of important points about how NASA fits into, and compares with the rest of, the government budget. This was much more useful than the chart in the link.  This chart didn't do much to explain the behavior of NASA's budget. Even if the percentage when compared to the rest of the government budget is shrinking, it doesn't give you any idea about the growth rate of NASA's budget. Similarly, any growth should be weighted by an inflationary index. Inflation will always shift the growth rate down, whether the budget was growing or shrinking in terms of hard cash. Only then do you have a more accurate comparison of of NASA's budget over time. A steady budget, weighted by inflation, would then mean NASA can produce the same output year after year."

I strongly believe that NASA's budget should be increased, and that space exploration not only benefits us at home but allows us to grow as a human race.  That said, lazy and misleading information about the budget helps no one.  Simply saying ""well X gets more money than y!!"" is a silly and useless argument that only serves to our detriment, because it makes the position look weak to anyone not in favor of budgetary increases."
space,3du32l,Metalsand,3,Sun Jul 19 19:52:52 2015 UTC,"Great post! Just a minor correction in case someone is more interested.     The US Air Force Space Command monitors all space debris in orbit, something critical for every NASA launch of every type.    Currently only some debris is tracked, it is a massive amount of debris too. However most of the debris in space is too tiny to be tracked from the ground and there are not current missions to actively track tiny object in space. I believe the current cut off is an area around 7 cm for what can be tracked. There's a range of objects below that that are essentially bullets whipping around many of which have the potential to cause significant damage. The ISS actually has to maneuver on a regular basis to avoid debris impact."
space,3du32l,Jwpt,3,Mon Jul 20 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think people are arguing for transferring spending from the military to NASA because of our level of military spending, but rather because it is probably the one item that can take the largest cuts without negatively affecting the average american. Cut medicare/medicaid and a significant portion of the population is going to have to spend significantly more on already expensive healthcare, cut social security and you only make it harder for people to retire/plan for retirement. Indeed pretty much everything that taxpayers have been convinced to spend money on are for things that directly benefit the average taxpayer.  However if the military got cut, even by a significant factor, the only portion of the population that would be directly affected are those paid by the military, either as servicemen or in defense contracts, however presumably the increase in spending at NASA or equivalent scientific endeavors would cancel out that decrease. The only argument for keeping defence spending as high as it is would be if defense spending translated directly into safety for the country and its interests, an argument anyone would be hard pressed to make. The fact is a large conventional military is only valuable for fighting other large conventional militaries, of which none really exist. Also, as you pointed out, there is already a lot of overlap between NASA and the military, so wouldn't it be more efficient to pool resources within one organization rather than having an unnecessarily large bureaucracy?   The fact is when evaluating whose budget to cut, the metric should not be ""who has the most?"" but rather ""who can afford to lose the most?"" and there is a candidate which stands out. That's not to say that we should take money exclusively from the military, or take it in the form of random cuts to their budget. However the position that the military budget should be sacrosanct because we're no longer spending as much as we did at the height of the cold war is not tenable. Sure there may be a few stupid subsidies here and there that we don't need, or perhaps people would be game for the trivially small tax increase it would take to dramatically increase NASA's funding, or hell we could just pour another drop into the bucket of deficit spending; but if we need to save some serious cash, it's really obvious where we can tighten our belts."
space,3du32l,skpkzk2,17,Mon Jul 20 07:26:51 2015 UTC,"For one, the US actually spends over $60 billion a year on space: over $40 billion of which goes to defense-related projects.   I guess the problem is that while the US may be spending a ton of money on space, what most of us would like to see is for more to be spent on space exploration and science than defense."
space,3du32l,TheFlashFrame,19,Sun Jul 19 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"But those science and exploration missions use the infrastructure paid for by the defense component. You need that infrastructure one way or another, and  cutting back on defense spending while increasing science spending might not actually mean more missions, and instead might mean a reduction of other services (such as GPS). The point is that it's not an either or decision, and out of all the things that could be cut in favor of NASA, defense is at the bottom of that list."

space,3du32l,TacticusPrime,23,Mon Jul 20 15:28:13 2015 UTC,"That's not a red herring. What you are arguing is semantics regarding mandatory and discretionary.  Those programs are still money that is taken out of the economy via taxation and spent immediately on current beneficiaries. Just because it is mandatory does not mean that they are not considered current spending by any means.  Also, the budget isn't a zero sum game. The US is a debtor nation and routinely runs budgets greater than the whole of defense spending. You can spend zero dollars on defense and still run a debt. Thus what is holding spending back on NASA has little to do with money available, as plenty is, especially since most of our national debt is held by Americans"

space,3du32l,learath,26,Sun Jul 19 22:56:19 2015 UTC,"Mandatory spending is basically on autopilot. Congress writes a bill to create a program, and specifies funding or funding formulas or whatever in the law itself. And then it runs out the door for however long the law says it should, for three years, ten years, or in perpetuity. These programs can be big like Medicare, or small like certain Farm Bill programs for instance. ALL federal budget growth is coming from these categories.  Discretionary spending is adjusted every year, through spending bills written every year by appropriators and signed by the President. When these bills don't pass a shutdown happens. This is the part of the budget where NASA lives, and has been declining for decades. What's really been happening is entitlements have been crowding out everything else.  It's easier to cut, constrain, change, or redirect discretionary spending, while it's very hard to control mandatory spending once Congress starts the spigot.  Keep in mind the above is super-simplified, but basically this is how it works."

space,3du32l,hotsizzlepancakes,14,Sun Jul 19 22:17:49 2015 UTC,On average since 1975 when the growth rate of NASA's budget seems to have evened out the average rate of growth each year is roughly 4%.  The current budget is 5.5 times the 1975 budget while the buying power of a 1975 dollar is $4.44 today.  This makes funding roughly 20% greater than the rate of inflation during that same time period.  This posted chart is misleading as the role and size of government programs has increased during that time frame.  If every program funded by government was entitled to maintain spending as a percentage it would be impossible to create new programs or appropriately distribute funding to areas that require more attention as time goes on.

space,3du32l,thenewguy124,12,Sun Jul 19 23:44:15 2015 UTC,I'd like to remind everyone here to remember about statistics when you read into the figures.  This is the percentage of the federal budget not the GDP. Federal budget grew quite significantly as the share of GDP so it can be very misleading.Here's a graph you can find with a quick search. It shows that between 1967 and 1982 the federal budget increased by a third - social programs were started in late 60s. Also the bump in the 90s is the budget shrinking rather than NASA funding increasing significantly in nominal terms.  Also many people forget that the early space race - including the Moon landings - were two things that we no longer think about living in the age of peaceful exploration.  They were additional military money outside of the Pentagon budget (that's how the space program started) and they were also a propaganda stunt - part of psychological warfare against the USSR.  We like to think that it was some noble scientific push for the pinnacle of human ability at the time but it wasn't.   The goal at the end of the line was nukes on the moon and space warfare.   And that's why the Apollo program was cut short when it was obvious that the USSR is not going to match it. There was no need anymore.

An ICBM from north dakota can hit any target in the world in 30 minutes   That's the point though! It gives the other side a whole 30 minutes of launch warning -- a very visible IR plume from the rocket launch, and radar reflections of the large missile body. It guarantees the other side enough time to launch their own missiles in retaliation. Which is perfectly fine: it's a stable situation where both sides can credibly deter the other. This is how MAD works, supposedly.  Orbiting warheads have no launch warning, no infrared signatures, and small radar cross-sections (it's just a warhead, no large rocket attached). The signatures they do have are at low orbital altitude (>200 km), so they're almost always over-the-horizon, unlike the >2,000 km ballistic missile arcs that can be seen from half the globe. Reentry could happen in fast seconds.  This makes them viable first strike weapons: one side can take out most of the other's nuclear capacity, their silos, faster than then they react. This breaks MAD and endangers both sides: it's no surprise the US and USSR agreed not to build them (OST). It was a serious threat, not a fantasy."

Not the moon perhaps but in space - it was seriously considered as a backup the same way subs are a backup to silos-based missiles (at the time silos-based missiles were larger).  The reason why they don't want nukes in space is because of treaties which formally demilitarized it. Why? Because of the absolutely horrific potential. Read on spaceborne weapon programs - they're wildly expensive but terrifying if put into effect especially that unlike standard solutions they restrict technology even more than secret nuclear programs.

space,3du32l,AliceInWondermall,23,Sun Jul 19 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"But I agree with you, if military funding was cut and NASA budget was increased we would probably be a lot further in space exploration.   That's debatable.  If you look at your chart, you'll see that in the same years NASA received 4-5% of the US budget, military spending was 45-50% of the federal budget.  Why? The Cold War between the US and USSR meant that space was a big part of the equation, and the Space Race was a great way for the US and USSR to show their own technological superiority. Indeed, the first men sent into space rode on top of converted ICBMs and the first astronauts were all military officers.  Note too that the US space budget is far more than just NASA. The military spends over $7 billion a year just on acquiring space-based systems - another $10 billion or so is related to R&D in space (such as GPS-III) and space-operations. The budget of the US military overlaps considerably with NASA and other agencies that use space:  For instance:   US Air Force Space Command is responsible for monitoring all space debris in orbit, a pretty important of every NASA mission and launch The Air Force is also in charge of the operations and maintenance of all US GPS satellites, which comes free of charge for civilian use. Budget overlap means that a weather satellite for the military (an important part of aviation and naval forces) may be paid for by the military, launched on its budget, but administered by NOAA's operations budget. Most of NASA's astronauts, past and present, are military officers. NASA utilizes the military's training facilities considerably too - for instance, all astronauts without prior-military-aviation experience go through Air Force and Navy flight school for an abbreviated aviation syllabus.   It's not a coincidence that the three nations that have independently sent man into space - Russia, the US, and China - have historically had the three largest military budgets on Earth."

Let's say that it would be possible to make politicians somehow cut military spending (impossible, massive cash cow, but let's pretend). And let's also assume that it would be possible to have them consciously direct that saved money elsewhere.  Why would space exploration be preferable to infrastructure? Or healthcare or education.

India was harshly criticized for their Mars mission while their country was still poor.   Let's use India as an example. Every problem we have in the US, India has more of it on a larger scale. Do you think India was wise to spend $70 million to go to Mars while a third of their people don't have clean water?   The truth is that space exploration has benefits that are hard to see and can't be measured in dollars. How many Indian kids were inspired to become scientists and engineers? How will this mission affect India's technological credibility? How many people simply had their day brightened by seeing their country do something great?   There are clear benefits too. Indian satellites helped predict weather and evacuate people where there was danger. They helped farmers by analyzing precipitation patterns. After their recent successes, India is now an international launch provider. New tech developed by space programs has a trickle down effect into the rest of the industry.  If a relatively poor country like India can justify a space program, it's easy to see how a wealthy one like the United States can."

The scientists among us all believe that it is money well spent and should be increased, and when you look at the size of the national budget, obviously there's room.  However, the great majority of the voting public believe that it's about little more than some really expensive pretty pictures, and this perception is highly unlikely to change anytime in the near future.  Therefore, the budget is high enough to moderately satisfy the scientific community, but low enough to not outrage those who think the fake beggar on the corner needs it more.    Indirectly, there are certainly economic benefits to space exploration.  However, if industry were to exploit more direct financial benefits, such as tourism, mining, etc, then NASA's budget would likely increase, if only to provide for more bureaucratic regulatory oversight."

Source: Encyclopedia Astronautica  For context: the F/Y 1969 budget for NASA was $$4.2 billion, or about 2.3% of the federal budget. Source: Manchester Guardian  [On February 13, 1969], president Richard Nixon formed a task group, led by vice president Spiro T. Agnew, to determine the course of the U.S. space program following the Apollo program.  Three proposals were ultimately determined:  At $8-10 billion per year, NASA could press for a manned mission to Mars, permanent bases in orbit around the Moon, a large-scale space station in Earth orbit with a capacity of 50 astronauts, and the reusable Space Shuttle to service all of them.  At a cap of $8 billion per year, NASA could do everything but the lunar orbit bases.  A minimum of $5 billion could still do the Earth space station and the Space Shuttle.  Ultimately, Nixon rejected them all, wanting them to go even cheaper. Of course, these days when NASA struggles with a $15 billion annual budget, it probably sounds like a relative bargain."

Edit: Downvote if you like, but it's true. Gravity follows the inverse square law, meaning that its effect drops off drastically the further away two objects are from each other, and tidal effects are based on a gradient of gravitational force. Imagine taking a balloon that you can blow into a perfect sphere, inflating it to a diameter of 10cm, and then drawing a dot on it with a marker. The dot is where Moon's gravity field touches Earth, if you imagine the former as being at the perfect center of the balloon. Now, inflate that imaginary balloon(don't worry, it's made of super stretchy plastic) until it's say just shy of twenty meters - the imaginary marker dot will get much bigger! Now, remember the size of the dot on the Moon-balloon - that's how big our Earth is on this scale, and the change in strength of the gravitational field is much smaller at this point. Of course, this doesn't take into account the massive power of Sun's gravity, but if you have the numbers it still comes out to having only 44% the tidal effect as the Moon.

space,3dypqw,davedubya,3,Mon Jul 20 16:49:57 2015 UTC,"Not to take anything away from Margaret Hamilton but it was a team effort at MIT to design the Apollo guidance computer, in which she played a major part, designing among other things a sophisticated software interpreter, which implemented pseudo-instructions which simplified navigational tasks.   The priority task scheduling saved the day, and without it they would have no doubt had to abort the landing. From the Apollo Guidance Computer wiki:  PGNCS generated unanticipated warnings during Apollo 11's lunar descent, with the AGC showing a 1201 alarm (""Executive overflow - no vacant areas"") and a 1202 alarm (""Executive overflow - no core sets"").[12] The cause was a rapid, steady stream of spurious cycle steals from the rendezvous radar, intentionally left on standby during the descent in case it was needed for an abort.[13][14]  During this part of the approach, the processor would normally be almost 85% loaded. The extra 6,400 cycle steals per second added the equivalent of 13% load, leaving just enough time for all scheduled tasks to run to completion. Five minutes into the descent, Buzz Aldrin gave the computer the command 1668 which instructed it to calculate and display DELTAH (the difference between altitude sensed by the radar and the computed altitude). This added an additional 10% to the processor workload, causing executive overflow and a 1202 alarm. After being given the ""GO"" from Houston, Aldrin entered 1668 again and another 1202 alarm occurred. When reporting the second alarm, Aldrin added the comment ""It appears to come up when we have a 1668 up"". Luckily for Apollo 11, the AGC software had been designed with priority scheduling. Just as it had been designed to do, the software automatically recovered, deleting lower priority tasks including the 1668 display task, to complete its critical guidance and control tasks. Guidance controller Steve Bales and his support team that included Jack Garman issued several ""GO"" calls and the landing was successful. For his role, Bales received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom on behalf of the entire control center team and the three Apollo astronauts.[15]  The problem was not a programming error in the AGC, nor was it pilot error. It was a peripheral hardware design bug that was already known and documented by Apollo 5 engineers.[16] However, because the problem had only occurred once during testing, they concluded that it was safer to fly with the existing hardware that they had already tested, than to fly with a newer but largely untested radar system. In the actual hardware, the position of the rendezvous radar was encoded with synchros excited by a different source of 800 Hz AC than the one used by the computer as a timing reference. The two 800 Hz sources were frequency locked but not phase locked, and the small random phase variations made it appear as though the antenna was rapidly ""dithering"" in position, even though it was completely stationary. These phantom movements generated the rapid series of cycle steals.  J. Halcombe Laning design saved the Apollo 11 landing mission. Had it not been for Laning's design the landing would have been aborted for lack of a stable guidance computer.[17]"

I'll give an analogy I just thought of though to maybe make it into a faq one day. Imagine a regular sized chessboard with regular sized pieces. Next to it is another chessboard. In fact, surrounded by chessboards on all sides. And chessboards next to that. Forever. An endless floor of chessboards. Now, because if the chessboards were any smaller the pieces couldn't fit, we can say this is the smallest the squares can be. It's as dense as is it can get, just as the universe started as dense it could be. But infinite. Then one day the squares start growing in size. That's your Big Bang. The chess pieces are in the middle of larger and larger squares, and are getting further and further from each other. So there's no center, but everything is expanding."

'Before' isn't quite something that makes much sense, but from the first Planck-time (the smallest unit of time, a single tick of the clock), the universe was infinite.   There's a catch: the eternal inflation model makes a little bit of a different prediction. The universe is still infinite, but the expansion starts at one point and spreads. We can never know what direction and how far away, and from our point of view the universe looks as if the expansion started everywhere at once. Space is still infinite because time is infinite."

Third, they ripped off Stamper's patent to build their drilling rig and didn't fully understand it.  They tried to modify it and messed it up.  Stamper was necessary to fix and operate the rig correctly.  Fourth, originally they were just going to us Stamper as a consultant to tell them where they fucked up and fix it and tell them what they needed to do.  It was Stamper who insisted that he go, and that his crew go with them.  If you're NASA, and you need Stamper, you don't really have the option of going without him since he insists on going in order to help (or, rather, do it himself with his team).

So asteroid mining would allow spacecraft to journey on significantly longer voyages due to the ability to provide spacecraft with refuel depots far away from Earth.

It said 90 million tons in the article, earth production is something like 150 tons. So there's enough for nearly a million years at this rate.

In about four billion years, the Milky Way will collide with the Andromeda Galaxy. They will merge and there should be strong star formation as the gases in each galaxy collide and heat up.  In many, many billions of years, however, the gas will run out. Star formation will decrease to almost nothing, and you'll end up with a galaxy full of red dwarfs and black holes.

Its probably gonna take a long long time for any intelligent species to develop the technology for feasible interstellar travel.  Chances are some some extinction level event will take out the aforementioned species before they are sufficiently advanced enough to develop such technology. Not to mention how dangerous the travel itself would be.  I think these are a few(among the many) points to be considered when trying to figure if there are a lot of space faring species out there. I personally doubt there are very many,if at all."

What our planet's history has shown is non-sapient species going extinct. They had no knowledge of what's happening, no control above their instinctual impulses, no chance. I don't think humans will be going extinct that easily. Even a 20-100km asteroid impact, we will likely survive, and recover to our previous state in at most a few hundred years (which is nothing in interstellar travel timescales). And we're not far away from being able to prevent such events.  True, there would be some destructive events that would definitely eliminate humanity at this point, but I don't think they're common enough to occur in the timescales necessary to attain interstellar space travel from zero (a few hundred thousand years, maybe?). Earth hasn't encountered such an event in its entire history after life formed, otherwise there would be no life around."

If that were the case, no land-based animals would have survived. As it happens, quite a lot of them survived, it was just the smaller, more adaptible ones.  What it did cause is a global ""nuclear winter"", reducing the capability of plants to survive in the numbers they had before, removing the survival opportunity of any large-mass herbivore that relied on them heavily. This is what killed the dinosaurs.  We'd do much better against a nuclear winter ourselves, what with our know-how and technology. Plus, point of the matter, a worldwide nuclear war would not cause a nuclear winter itself, contrary to popular belief."

I don't think its likely but admittedly I'm not an expert on the subject.  But even if we did survive its not going to be easy or quick going back to where we are. Its the some total of knowledge humanity has acquired in 50,000-100,000 years. That will  be hard to replace. Most will be lost. It would be starting all over again for most things. With an extremely small population.  Also,our intelligence gives us a big leg up no doubt,but the trade off is that we need a whole lot more to go right to survive. A cockroach has a much higher chance of riding over a global catastrophe than a human will,individually.   Extinction level events almost always affect the dominant/more advanced species more due to more varied needs.  If Mother Nature were to truly whack us,we wouldn't stand a chance."

Kind of a data-storage backup plan in case we have a 50km asteroid drop by to say hello.  Any survivors would have a nice little easter egg if they manage to visit the Moon again

space,3dx8x2,zolikk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:46 2015 UTC,"I am of the view that we're almost guaranteed to survive such extinction-level events. Each time, some part of the biosphere did survive, so there will always be food sources left for us, and we can adapt quickly.  Also, we wouldn't have to redo things from scratch, not only our knowledge would survive but also most of our machines. Sure, worldwide grids would be knocked out, but we'd mostly just need to repair and reconnect them. Only the impact area itself would be utterly wiped off, so it naturally depends on where exactly the impact area is, and it's most likely to happen in the ocean. Sure, tidal waves would cause massive extra damage.  Note that there isn't really any specific point on the Earth that we vitally depend on, so even if we're unlucky and the asteroid hits one of the 6-7 most technologically advanced and populous centers (USA, Europe, China, Japan, Australia, S. America, S. Africa - we have plenty ""first world"" level areas), the rest would pull through, of course with huge death rates, but some portion of the populations would survive. Local power grids would either be unhurt or quickly restored, and every such area mostly manages power individually, so we would even get to keep a significant portion of our power grid.  Also, many practical technologies and tools of ours would directly survive the disaster without any loss in usability. The surviving population would be far from being rendered back into the stone age."

Do you have any numbers to back that up?  Yes there are a lot of planets out there. If you just take the rough approximation of 100 billion galaxies with 100 billion stars you get a huge number. But we do not know yet what it takes for life to form. All we know so far is that it can't be that easy since if it was, it wouldn't still be such a huge mystery. Apart from the fact that a lot of conditions have to be met for life to be able to form in the first place.  So it's one really large number of planets, vs a really small but still unknown chance to happen.  TL;DR: We just don't know yet. And we can't say it is a statistical certainty. As of now it is purely a matter of guessing / believing."

But we know it has happened already, atleast once. So the question now is: is the chance that live starts smaller or equal then 1/(the amount of planets in the universe). Or is it bigger than that? In both cases it's still possible that earth is the only planet with life. However if the chance is higher than that number, the chance of having multiple planets with life will be larger. I personally think the chance for life to form is much larger than this number. Why? If the chance would be equal or lower than this number we would be extremely lucky to be alive. It's way more likely that we're not that lucky and that life is therefore common in the universe."

That's also a problem with statistics, even if you're 99.99% certain about something, you can still be wrong.   You just can't argue around the fact that we don't know how likely it is. Period.

Even if you knew the chance, which we don't, it would not matter because if it is extremely unlikely it can still happen.   You're implying there is such a thing as a one time event. Statistically speaking there is no such thing. If we assume that life has a natural origin (which all evidence indicates at this moment) this means some chain of events lead to life. This chain has occured atleast once since we have life on earth. Therefore the probability of this chain of events happening is larger than 0. It may be very small, but it is atleast larger than 0. If given an infinite amount of time (or attempts for life to form) the probability of this chain occuring becomes equal to 1. However the observable universe is not infinite, not in time nor in size. However it is very large and very old so it may approximate infinity if the chance of life emerging is significantly large. Earth has been around for about 4 billion years. Fossil evidence suggests life has been around for atleast 3.5 billion years, this was just after conditions became suitable for life to form on earth. This suggests that the formation of life given a suitable enviroment is not that uncommon. Sure, it may have been just luck that so early after the formation of earth life spawned here. But what is more likely: that we are the exception, or that life can form relatively easily when conditions are suitable? Now given that there are about 1024 stars (estimates vary) in the observable universe each with potentially multiple orbiting planets that may harbour life it becomes clear that it is likely that there is life somewhere else.   Look at it this way: say we have a box with an enormous amount of marbles. We don't know the exact amount of marbles, but we do know that it is extremely large. These marbles can be either blue or green. Blue represents a planet without life, green represents a planet with life. Say we have 2 boxes. One has only 1 green marble, and all the other marbles in this box are blue. The other box has some green marbles, we don't know how many, but we do know there are more than 1 green marble in this box, again all other marbles are blue. We also know that both boxes have the same amount of marbles in total. Furthermore we have one green marble in our hand but we don't know from which box it came. Now what is more likely? That it came from the first or the second box? Even though we have no clue what the probabilities involved are, there is one thing we can say. And that is that it is more likely that the marble came out of the second box.   Then as said before, got any numbers to back up your claim that it is basically a given that life exists on multiple planets?   I'm rejecting the claim that life exists on only one planet since the amount of planets in the universe is so incredibly large that it is just unlikely that there is only life on one of those planets given that life exists.   Which is obviously a rhetorical question because you cannot know, because no one knows how likely it is that life emerges.   I never claimed to know, however I can say something about what is likely and what is not."

Intelligent life that forms on a world bigger than Earth might find that it's too difficult to reach orbit without a nuclear rocket--and their environmentalists might shut that down.  Intelligent life forms that live in water would have a much harder time with space travel.  There are a whole lot of reasons one can think of for an intelligent race to never get to space.

I also don't believe that UFOs or any of that other crap are intelligent life.

I don't know how far along you may be in foundations and would say that knowing the lexicon of space science should be the base to build on. Learning the language and terms used in space science should then be followed by studying the math and physics that represent what we know as fact. Read up on Newton and Kepler for the basics of physics and planetary motion. For new theories check out Max Tegmark from MIT.  A good series to get a nice survey of all the major topics is ""How the Universe Works"". Narrated by Mike Rowe, the show is in it's 4th season on the Science Channel. Earlier seasons are on Netflix (as of a few months ago, have not recently checked). Great for taking the big topics; Stars, Moons, black holes, galaxies, exo-planets, etc. Many of the scientists appearing on the show are leaders in current research and projects happening right now.   Look up books by Lawrence Krauss on Universal evolution theories, Neil DeGrasse Tyson has some good work on Black holes, anything by Stephen Hawking(he also has a good 3 part series on Netflix), Kip Thorne and Andrea Ghez on Black holes. We have really come a long way in our understanding in the last 30 years, more so now than in the last 2 centuries. For instance, the first planet discovered outside our solar system was in 1997. Since then we have found around 500 exo-planets. Bear in mind as you go forward what is fact and what is theory and stick to the most recent material. Sorry to ramble on so long. Hope this helps.

That is to say, the temperature within the cellular environment must be low enough to allow conformational stability and high enough to allow dynamic folding.  The temperature must be low enough to provide a liquid medium and high enough to prevent freezing.  high frequency radiation must be filtered to prevent frequent bond dissociation, but enough energy must be introduced to the environment to allow for organisms to metabolize. Generally, rocky bodies are desired as they provide the elemental diversity that determines polymer specialization and they also provide the living geology which provides a magnetic field.  A thick atmosphere allows for a chemical buffering of the plane's surface, providing sinks for toxic geological emissions and also equalize the temperature across the planet's surface..  That said, there could be exotic life out there, but we think we've identified the conditions that maximize the probability of life developing and focusing our limited resources on those spaces is most economical means to accomplish the goal."

space,3dw1r0,_yeah-nah_,5,Mon Jul 20 02:25:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Really there's a lot wrong with the IAU definition of ""planet.""   Really, there's a lot wrong with it.   For reference, here it is:    is in orbit around the Sun, has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape), and has ""cleared the neighbourhood"" around its orbit.    So, here are problems with the current definition.    It only applies to things in our solar system; only objects that orbit the sun. As a result, the definition doesn't apply to the growing number of planets and other planet-like objects that are outside of our solar system.  It doesn't talk about how planets are formed. Most scientists agree that a main distinction between a planet and a stellar object should be that one forms in a molecular cloud where as the other forms in a protoplanetary disc.  It doesn't set upper limits on temperature. There needs to be a distinction between what is a brown dwarf and what is a planet. I think item 2 could solve this, but no one knows if it's possible for a star to form in a protoplanetary disc.  There is no lower limit on size. In science, particularly with planetary sciences, size is a very important component in categorization. For instance, types of sedimentary rocks are classified based on the size of the materials that compose them. Conglomerate is a type that is compose of large pebbles and sandstone is composed of small grains of sand. Even the term ""pebble"" and ""sand"" are determined based on size. The size also informs us about where rock was formed, and helps to paint a larger picture. The size of planetary objects helps to tell a story as well. Further, the entire controversy of the ""clears its own orbit"" language could have been avoided if they specified a lower limit on size.  There is no criteria for the composition of an object. Again, it's common in science for things to be categorized based on what they are made of. I'll reference geology again. Chert is a sedimentary kind of a rock that is made from mostly silica. It's classified as microcrystalline due to its composition. On the other hand shale is a sedimentary rock that's made from clay and mud. It's categorized as microclastic because it is made up of tiny bits of clay and mud. The names of these rocks and the categories that they fit in tell us how they were made. Similarly, the composition of planets tells us a story of where and how they were formed.  It does not categorize planet types. There are clearly some obvious different kinds of planetary bodies. Terrestrial planets, like Earth and Mars, gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter. The term ""ice giants"" has been used to apply to Uranus and Neptune. There are now many exoplanets that we've discovered which completely defy our understanding of planets based on what we can observe in our own solar system. The stuff that Pluto and objects like it are more similar to the composition of comets than planets, which was part of Neil deGrasse Tyson's point.  It could be that things made mostly of ices can't be planets.  The ""clears its own orbit"" language ridiculous. First of all, even Jupiter doesn't clear its own orbit as it's inhabited by many Trojan asteroids. Its gravity does control those objects, but that's not what the definition says. Pluto's orbit even crosses the orbit of Neptune. The qualifier was added arbitrarily to prevent Pluto, Ceres, Eris, and others from obtaining planet status. The language would not be needed if these other criteria were used.  A fish out of water is still a fish. Seriously. If I take a bass from the lake and put in on my boat what is it? It's still a bass. It's still a fish? What if I kill it and cook it? Yup, still a bass, still a fish. It doesn't become some other thing. What if I take Mars and I put it in an orbit that in the Kuiper Belt? Would it still be a planet? According to the arbitrary rules of the definition, no, because it hasn't cleared its own path. In fact, there are likely at least Mercury sized objects out there that remain undiscovered. If I ejected Mars from the solar system it still would not be considered to be a planet under the IAU definition. Now, what if I put Pluto in orbit close to the sun? It'd grow a tail like a comet, thus behaving differently from a planet. Again, this what Neil deGrasse Tyson's point. Now, what if I took Mars, which formed in orbit around the sun, and put it in orbit around Jupiter? What would it be? The argument can be made that it's still a planet, but it was captured by Jupiter and became a satellite. I'd say it would be both a planet and a moon. Similarly, Neptune's moon Triton is theorized to be a capture Kuiper Belt Object, and is considered to both be a moon of Neptune and a KBO.   So, there you have eight very good reasons why the IAU's definition of planet is terrible. It doesn't deal with the size, shape, formation, or composition of an object, and worse it doesn't apply to any object not orbiting our sun."

Pterosaurs are not dinosaurs. Plesiosaurs are not dinosaurs. Crocodilians are not dinosaurs. They are all archosaurs, but they are not dinosaurs. The first ornithodirans, while very dinosaur-like and eventually gave rise to dinosaurs, are not dinosaurs. Pluto would be more like a basal ornithodiran archosaur than a full on dinosaur.  What is so morally wrong with Pluto and the other hundreds of dwarf planets, that have more in common with asteroids, comets, and most importantly each other than full-on planets, not being looped in with the other planets that have refined and dominated their orbits?  This same debate, happened over two centuries ago with Ceres. Everybody back in the day thought that was a new planet they discovered. Then came Pallas. And Juno. And Vesta. For a time, people considered these to be planets as well. Eventually, there came to be so many of them in the same spot that they were given a name to categorize them, asteroid, from their star-like appearance and afterward eventually ceased being referred to as planets.

Compression would be 1 thing but since the data transfer rates are so slow it doesn't matter too much either.  Another contributing factor is that that processor may have been state of the art when it was selected. Figure the probe was launched a decade ago, then subtract the build time, the design time, ect.

I do disagree with you that ""compression doesn't matter too much"" because of slow data transfer rates. Precisely because of them it matters so much! NASA packages and compresses data before sending it -- depending on your data, a good compression algorithm can get you 1/2 to 1/8th the original size (though for most cases it could be around 80 to 90% relative size).

The CPUs being designed and built now won't survive the extremes of the mission.  Radiation and VERY low temperatures would kill the CPU.   Old CPUs have another benefit: any problem with the logic design of the chip is either completely understood or already designed out of the system.  On top of this, the chip has a much simpler design, which makes it easier to know in advance exactly what it will do.   When your sending a probe on a 10+ year journey and you may never get the budget to send another again, you will use hardware that works 100% of the time.

Second point is very valid though, modern CPUs are often found to have logic flaws/bugs not encountered during the design phase, where as something simpler like the R3000 is a tried and true design.

You'll notice one edge of jupiter is yellow and the opposite edge is blue. This is from slight misalignments in your optics. Chromatic alignment is the bandaid, and optical collimation is the solution! If you have no idea how to do the second one, you can take your telescope to any telescope store and they might do it foe you if you ask nicely :)"

space,3dukpk,ElkeKerman,7,Mon Jul 20 02:41:55 2015 UTC,"In case you're in the dark on this thing, here's an old post of mine from April 2012 with a summary:   He first spotted it in his image data on March 20th, and made this post. That observation produced this now-famous gif from the green channel.  Later, on March 26th, he realised that he had captured the feature in earlier images, on March 17th, and it looked significantly different.  He had already collated the imagery taken by other astronomers on March 21st.  He made further observations of the anomaly as it continued to evolve on March 22nd.  He says NASA has been extremely helpful and have commanded two of their orbiters to photograph the region.  He's grouped all of the posts on the topic into a category on the right-hand side of the page, for ease of navigation. He runs a clean website.  The leading expert explanation, as of the last post, is that it's a high-altitude water-ice-cloud. There are three or four competing theories, but THEMIS should have had a look at it by now, and we should be seeing the release of the data any day now.  One of his commenters had a few quotes offering some explanations that definitely fall on the wilder end of the spectrum -   > That Terminal Projection’s source could come from a naturally occurring nuclear fission reactor.  > From Wikipedia:  > Acidalia Planitia is a plain on Mars. It is located between the Tharsis volcanic province and Arabia Terra to the north of Valles Marineris, centered at 46.7°N 338.0°E. The plain contains the famous Cydonia region at the contact with the heavily cratered highland terrain. The plain is named after a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which was in turn named after the mythological fountain of Acidalia.  > It has been hypothesized by J.E.Brandenburg from Orbital Technologies Corp. that a large natural nuclear reactor in the northern Mare Acidalium, near the large, shallow depression north of Acidalia Colles (similar to Oklo on Earth) underwent catastrophic meltdown.  > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidalia_Planitia  > Plasma physicist John Brandenburg has detected anomalies in gamma ray emissions from Mars in data from the NASA Mars Odyssey orbiter. This points to an abundance of radioactive uranium, thorium and potassium, especially in one particular spot on Mars that indicates that there was once a thick layer of radioactive substances, and the likelihood of a natural reactor.  > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor  Frankly I'm shocked that this phenomenon is ocurring near Cydonia, and I haven't heard a peep from the tinfoil-hat-brigade!  This whole thing is vaguely creepy. I can't imagine that the water-ice-cloud explanation is true... it's so high, something violent or energetic must have occurred to get it there. In addition, it's very dark in colour - any water ice clouds I've seen have been highly reflective. Noctilucent Clouds, for example.  I'm not saying I buy the georeactor idea, but I feel like an impact, or perhaps tectonic activity are far more likely."

space,3dvxpg,dat_crocoduck,11,Sun Jul 19 23:52:55 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's talk about the scientific value of space exploration:  First of all, let's go back to before we sent any probes into space at all: we knew nothing of Mars, or Venus. We knew nothing of Titan or Pluto's makeup. We knew far, far less about the Sun, the way the Earth works, etc.  So here's the value: we learned, and continue to learn, more about the Earth itself. By exploring space, including low earth orbit, we learn how weather works on Earth better, how climate works on earth better. But even then, Earth is a single example. By looking at weather on other worlds, other examples, we get to understand out own weather better, how our actions affect it, how we can better deal with it, how we can predict storms and tornados and poor, crop-damaging weather better.  We learn about the Earth's magnetic field, and considering how out tech works with electronics, that's nice to know.   By exploring near earth orbit, we learned how to build satellites that can create world-spanning telecommunication, spy on other countries actions, examine how the earth changed from year to year. All things of immeasurable value.  By exploring the sun and deep space outside the earth-moon system, we learn more about solar storms that could damage our way of life, and learn that we need to, not to mention how to, protect our electronics and power lines and all the rest. We can also predict these storms, or at least monitor them.  By exploring Venus, we found a world very different than we thought, and learned how runaway greenhouse effects work.   By exploring comets and asteroids, and finding them, we learn about the dangers these things could cause, the threat of asteroid collisions, and also learn how to prevent them!  We learn, by exploring Mars, what it means for another planet to be so similar, yet so different. We learn if we could leave this planet, whether it's safe or not. We learn whether Earth is vulnerable to the same effects or not. We learn more about whether life is common or rare, which affects how we look at Earth. Is our world a dime a dozen? Can we leave?  By exploring the stars with telescopes like the Hubble, we learn more about the fundamental laws of nature. Knowing relativity, which could really only be proved with space stuff, helps us with a lot of technology, for example. By putting humans in near earth orbit, we learn vast amounts about human physiology, both in weightlessness, and by inference how it works on Earth. This has obvious medical uses, to start with, and also teaches us if, again, we are permanently confined to the Earth.  And finding life on another world would be of huge importance. By having a second example of life, we'd learn if life has to be similar to ours, if alien microorganisms require processes like ours to exist. We learn if there are other ways to do things, other ways for life to exist, other ways for life to take in energy. By seeing life that was never like ours, we learn massive amounts about our own life, what it is and what it is not.  That's not even talking about the knock-on effects of inventing new tech that could be later useful on Earth."

We can learn more about the solar system and how our Earth was formed.  However, this can be argued to be on limited practical benefit.  There are also economic benefits.  GPS and satellite communication would be impossible without space exploration.  Additionally, there are resources in space that can be mined and developed.  As an example, there is an asteroid passing Earth currently that has over $5 trillion worth of metals.  There may also be materials that can be produced in orbit that cannot be produced in full gravity.  Finally, there is the very long-term survival advantage.  Eventually, the Earth will suffer another global extinction-level event, similar to that which killed the dinosaurs.  By exploring space, we may be able to detect and avert such an event, and even if we can't, having self-sufficient colonies on multiple planets will help ensure our species cannot die out completely."

To me space exploration isn't just about sending rockets to space and discovering the technological advancements, formulas and concepts, but it´s about having that 'mindset' that also trickles down into the other layers of our society.   Artists begin fantasizing about our future and create sci fi books, movies, music and art. Look at recent technological advancements that were inspired by these mediums. Holograms, tablets, stun guns, mobile phones, internet, androids and robots, futuristic cars, nano fiber clothes and so on.

Two unrelated species adapting to their environment to develop the same trait.    There are a lot of adaptations to the environment our species went through to get to our level of intelligence.  One that I find very fascinating is why humans have flat faces compared to, our ancestor apes, the other modern great apes, and other mammals.  You might have noticed that the foreheads of the other apes and mammals are very angled back, and small in structure.  This is to make the birthing process easier for females so the females don't die every time they give birth.  Whereas in humans, our foreheads are rather flat to the rest of our face, and it is very boxy.  Also, humans don't have much, if any, of a snout.  This structure of our cranium allows our brain more room to grow.  It is theorized that the frontal lobes of the brain control motor function, problem solving, spontaneity, memory, language, initiation, judgement, impulse control, and social and sexual behavior.  A lot of the things that define us as human.  What were the environmental pressures that created this change in our physiology?  Our teeth shrunk, and our enamel this thinner than most mammals.  There's also lowering levels of sexual dimorphism in our species, which creates less prominent canine teeth...but that's another discussion.  Our teeth shrunk because of our species' use of fire.  With fire, our ancestors could consume more nutrients with softer foods.  Even plants release more nutrients when cooked because their cell walls break down.  Our brain might have grown big, and increased intelligence over time, because our ancestors mastered the use of fire.   For our alien brethren, they may be birthed, hatched, or something else which doesn't require a smaller cranium in order to not kill their member of individuals that broods the next.  They will probably figure out another way of reaching intelligence that doesn't require ""running, jumping, climbing trees and putting on make up while you're up there.""   Until panspermia is proven true, then the uniqueness of how each intelligent alien species comes about will provide so many clues towards what actually is intelligence.  Are we an intelligent ape that keeps mastering its tools?  Or, are we still cavemen, somehow blasting ourselves into spaces not really knowing what it all means?"

In conditions similar to Earth, yes, it's likely that something similar would evolve to be sapient. Needs to have the right kind of neurobiology, needs a complex set of sensory systems, and almost definitely would need limbs. AND it has to have access to something that enables food and shelter to be trivial.  For humans, this was fire. Octopuses, I don't know, can't think of anything that would enable them to trivialize their food source, so no, I don't think they can ever become sapient, not while they're water-dwelling.  It's likely that sapient aliens in other Earth-like conditions will look humanoid or at least ""animal-oid"", needing a central brain and limbs.  However, in exotic life conditions, who knows what the possibilities of sapient life would be..."
space,3dwz6b,zolikk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:07:25 2015 UTC,"Just because octopuses can't use fire, that doesn't mean they can't become sapient: ""sapient"" means thinking and intelligent and self-aware, not tool-using. Using tools is independent to sapience. Some non-sapient animals on Earth already use tools: beavers and crows, for instance. Dolphins are self-aware and may be sapient even though they can't make or use tools. So octopuses could become sapient without ever taming fire or discovering cooking."
space,3dwz6b,Algernon_Asimov,0,Mon Jul 20 10:58:40 2015 UTC,"I know, but a certain level of sapience requires the brain to develop in a certain manner, and for humans at least, this growth in brain capacity was allowed by cooking food and not having to spend all brain capacity for hunting and eating all day.  Which is why I said that there needs to be some manner of trivializing the necessity of food to enable the brain to start working on thought. I didn't say this requires fire necessarily, just that I can't think of any other method that a species like the octopus would have access to.  Remember - it has to develop a high enough intelligence to be able to use more advanced methods. You can't just come up with an advanced food farming method and say ""the octopus could just do that instead"", since it needs to get the intelligence first, and the method as a consequence, but it needs the method to develop intelligence."

So wouldn't they need to evolve a  backbone, skeleton, something other than tentacles (since they don't allow land movement). I feel like this kind of evolution would take longer than it would for land animals to evolve sentience. Also, haven't many sea creatures with similar ancestors already existed for millions of years? They haven't managed to evolve into sapient beings yet.  Edit: Oh I missed that you mentioned elephants - I think that their trunks are not nimble enough to create non-primitive tools (axes or ploughs for havesting, then later wood and metal crafting, then assembly of machinery or electronics). I believe that they are limited by their size and large trunk. Besides, elephant-like creatures on other planets are no more likely than apes. I mentioned that if tree-climbing creatures evolved, their dexterous grippers would give them the head start to evolving into sapient lifeforms. There isn't the same environmental pressure for elephants, dogs or pigs to evolve nimble and delicate body parts which would allow them to create complex tools later in their evolutionary path  Edit 2: I've changed my mind and now agree with you. I guess there are probably other ways to reach a sapient-like stage that I can't even imagine"
space,3dwz6b,dustydeath,3,Mon Jul 20 06:21:58 2015 UTC,"Sapience doesn't require or imply tools. Sapience merely requires self-awareness and consciousness and thought. Tools are an optional extra.   Anyway, beavers and crows routinely use tools. They could become sapient. And they don't look like us.   Also, we still don't know for sure whether dolphins and whales are sapient. Those whale songs might be communicating deep philosophical musings about the meaning of life, for all we know.  What you mean is not sentient (able to feel pain and pleasure) or sapient (able to think and be self-aware). You mean technology-using beings.   And, a technology-using being does not have to look like us. For example, recent studies into octopuses are showing signs of intelligence in those animals: they learn, they solve mazes, they solve problems, they use tools. One thing holding them back is that adult octopuses die shortly after mating, which means baby octopuses have to learn everything from scratch. If adult octopuses could teach what they learn to baby octopuses... we might see the beginnings of a technology-using animal. And I can't think of any animal on Earth which looks less like humans than an octopus!"

Technology absolutely does require some sort of delicate gripping appendage. Humans have fingers and octopuses have tentacles.  You mentioned that you think elephants' trunks are not nimble enough to create tools. Elephants are quite intelligent and possess self-awareness (humans, apes, and dolphins are the only other animals known to recognise themselves in mirrors). They also make and use primitive tools. Do you read any science fiction? In the novel 'Footfall', the sci-fi author Larry Niven imagines aliens which look like elephants with trunks that end in branching tentacles. It's not that hard to imagine our own elephants developing something like that if the right random mutations occurred. And, with their existing intelligence and their use of tools... :)"

space,3dwz6b,neuromorph,2,Mon Jul 20 08:58:30 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to wax lyrical a bit on the subject of alien life. I answered a question similar to this recently, so I've copied bits of that answer in here, and I've skipped over thoughts on alien plant life for the sake of brevity (which this doesn't have any way so I don't know why I bothered).   1. Biochemistry  Let's broadening your question's scope from 'sentient alien life' to 'alien life' for the moment. What might it be like and where would it evolve?   We know that elements that make up life on Earth are not uncommon in the universe. We are predominantly carbon, nitrogen, and water, so anywhere where we can find those things would be a good candidate to find life. We shouldn't limit our search there, however - we could imagine the carbon atoms in our biochemistry being replaced by silicon, for example, which is in the same group and shares much of carbon's chemistry. Water is a very good solvent, with a large specific heat capacity, and liquid over a comfortable window of temperatures and pressures. Liquid ammonia (at higher pressures than water) is often suggested as an alternative, and is a better solvent for organic molecules than water; but really the list of good solvent candidates (methanol, formaldehyde, hydrogen fluoride, sulphuric acid, even supercritical carbon dioxide)  is huge and would vary with properties like a planet's temperatures and pressure.   Nevertheless, places with liquid water are a good place to start looking because we know life has evolved there before, and what sort of conditions it needs. Experiments like the Miller-Urey experiment (and other ones of that ilk) demonstrate how easy it is for 'organic' molecules to form abiotically in the sort of pre-life, anaerobic conditions we had in Earth's history.   So, the molecular specifics of life could be quite varied - but what would they have in common? What makes them 'life'?   Let us consider an alien life form we've just discovered called Alius ajanji. We'd expect that it must reproduce in some way. If a 'life-form' evolved that was not a 'replicator', if it was unable to produce progeny, it would be incredibly vulnerable. That one individual of the species gets killed, and life disappears! So any alien life that we might find probably is capable of reproducing itself.   This immediately suggests that it must have some information-storage system. The information in this system is capable of creating this life-form, and can be replicated at high fidelity in order to produce progeny - 'alien DNA'. It would help if this process of replication was not perfect, however - as this would generate the diversity necessary for adaptation to its environment (that is to say, evolution). A species that fails to adapt will not survive.   When I say 'alien DNA', I don't necessarily mean deoxyribonucleic acid - but something similar to it would be a pretty good bet. We believe that life on earth first used RNA as its information storage molecule, which has the advantage of being self-catalytic (i.e. it can replicate itself). DNA was later evolved as a less error-prone information storage system. The subunits of both appear abiotically in experiments like Miller-Urey's, so the component parts should be quite common on any early-Earth type planet.   Before we knew the genetic information of our cells was in the DNA, there were three types of complex molecule that scientists thought might contain genetic information - the nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), carbohydrates, and proteins. The smart money was actually on proteins: they're macromolecules composed of lots of units of 23 (in humans) different amino acids strung together in a chain, and there are lots of different proteins in a cell bent into lots of different shapes, whereas DNA molecules were only made of four different sub-units. This hypothesis was overturned with an experiment (I can't remember the name for the life of me) where someone mashed up some antibiotic resistant bacteria, separated out the proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids, and saw which solution still had the power to transform other bacteria with the antibiotic resistance.   But perhaps there are other planets where proteins are the genetic information carriers. Prion diseases on Earth come from a protein that can catalyse the conversion of other proteins to its form - which is reminiscent of the role of DNA in life.   In order to go through the process of replication, A. ajanji must acquire components from its environment (it must absorb or consume them in some way) and then perform biochemical operations on them in order to use them in its life cycle. These operations will require specific conditions and catalysts that the organism will not always be able to count on existing in its environment. We would expect, then, A. ajanji to have some sort of compartmentalisation, where it can dedicate certain compartments to certain jobs and control the environments within them."
space,3dwz6b,Sychar,2,Mon Jul 20 09:16:29 2015 UTC,"2. Sentience  It's important to remember that there is no reason why life has to evolve sentience. It is not going to be advantageous for every species to do so. If we consider what ingredients are necessary for sentience, we can start imagining what alien sentient life might look like - but that does mean that all or most alien life would conform to image.   So, let's say A. ajanji is not only an alien life-form but is also sentient. What does it look like?   To make increasing intelligence evolutionarily beneficial, it must have some way of precisely manipulating its environment: fingers and thumbs, tentacles, maybe a crow's beak. No species of flatworm is ever going to evolve an understanding of mathematics unless it evolves a way to put it into use to increase its fitness (building houses, trading for food, buying ikea furniture, whatever).   It probably has a head - concentrating your neural tissue into a centralised system goes hand in hand with making your brain complicated enough to simulate your own future (what I'm going to use as the definition of 'sentient', for the sake of argument). This means A. ajanji is probably bilaterally symmetric (i.e. like a human or elephant rather than like a jellyfish or a fungus).  On Earth, cephalisation (making a head) followed or coincided with the bilateral body plan. I'm not certain why we do not see cephalisation otherwise - but I would guess the connection between bilateral body plans and cephalisation is either:  a) related to a change in gut structure - i.e. having a separate mouth and anus and not a blind gut. The bilateral body plan allows for an advanced digestive tract, with specialised chambers, and a coelom that insulates gut movements (peristalsis) from body movements. So, bilateral body plan evolves to benefit digestion and incidentally allows for cephalisation, or,  b) related to a need to bring together the sensory organs in order to start the brain-complexity arms race rolling. A creature's eyes are probably more useful stuck out at one end of the body than embedded in the middle (easier to point around, for one thing.) A radial organism would want to spread its sensors out - e.g. a jellyfish can perceive its environment through its diffuse net of tentacles, and starfish have eyes on the end of each arm. This is more useful to it than having one eye stuck in the middle of its body but maybe it prevents the evolution of a proper brain.*  It would be really surprising if an alien organism evolved cephalisation before bilaterial symmetry - but a bilaterian could re-evolve a radial structure after it has developed a brain. The ancestors of starfish were bilaterians who acquired a penta-radial body plan.   That all sounds pretty varied - a head and some sort of grapser, either bilaterally symmetric or with bilaterian ancestors, then take your pick as to whatever assortment of legs, tentacles, wings, wheels, or, I don't know, liquid jet bladders you want. What is more interesting is what we can deduce about the sort of life it leads.  For increasing intelligence to be evolutionarily beneficially, not only must they be able to manipulate their environment but they are probably social in some way. As their intelligence evolves, they benefit from improved co-operation in hunting and breeding and the fitness benefits that brings. A complicated brain takes a lot of energy to make and maintain, so expect them to be meat eating (but not necessarily, it would depend on the rest of the alien's ecosystem as to what sort of food is available!).  They are probably K selected. A large brain equips you to be capable of learning, it is not a great advantage right away and will require lots of parental investment while it is developing. Being born with a big head will have trade offs on what the rest of the body will be like at birth. Baby lambs might be able to stand up and run around from day one, but they're as dumb as, well, sheep. You'd expect to see social structures here as well, such as both parents taking an active role in raising the child, or a communal child-rearing system.  Intelligent beings will certainly have culture. They will have stories that get passed on to their offspring to teach them about the world. They'll have language, or communication of some sort. They might have a writing system, a way of recording those stories outside of oral history, and so on.   But all this is assuming that the alien life depends on the same sort of sensory organs that are advantageous on earth. For example, suppose *A. ajanji evolved on a planet where it was too dark to bother with evolving eyes, and instead evolved special sensor organs, 'biomagnetic lodestones' or something (like the ampullae of Lorenzini, shark magnetic detectors). Concentrating your photoreceptors is advantageous but they have to be put on a head in order to look around and see things. Maybe these 'biomagnetic lodestones' could be concentrated in the centre of the organism and lead to brain development without cephalisation, as there is no advantage to sticking them on an appendage and waving them around."

When you say that camera technology has surpassed what the human eye can resolve... you do know that 1080p ""HD"" is only 2MP right? The human eye has been estimated to be around 30MP. That is a huge difference. The ""HD"" in this gif is no more or less detailed because it is HD. The ONLY thing giving this a ""surreal"" look to it(which is not surreal to me at all) is the high level of magnification. In optics, magnification ""flattens"" a scene while wide angles ""push"" scenes and make objects appear farther away from eachother. This is photography 101. This is a fundamental piece of the puzzle that every photographer is aware of.  If you were orbiting the moon and had a telescope that had the same exact magnification that is seen here in the Earthrise GIF, it would look way better than this ""HD"" video because you would be seeing it with your own eyes and your own eyes absolutely outresolve 1080p ""HD"" video.  I get what you are trying to say but it's not exactly right. The super high resolution image that you posted of Earth is, for all intents and purposes, more than what the human eye can see. I agree with you there. However, that doesn't necessarily translate over to the original GIF of the Earthrise. Sure, maybe it was filmed in higher than 2MP but that is kind of a moot point when by the time we see it on the internet it is surely compressed and converted to a smaller resolution, especially if it is to appear in a video production that might be on TV or broadcast over the internet."

However, if you just launch the cargo with orbital velocity, the projectile would fly around the moon and hit the back of the railgun. To actually achieve orbit, you also require a circularisation manuver, usually at apoapsis (the highest point of the orbit). This could be easily done by launching a small solid rocket engine along with the cargo."

They could build an electromagnetic catapult on the far side of the moon that is long enough to accelerate a payload into an orbit that intersects with Earth's atmosphere, then payloads could use aerobraking to go to low earth orbit or land on earth directly.

We also know more about Europa (and the Jupiter system in general), so it might be we can design the lander to have more chances of a successful landing. Round-trip communication would also be faster.  From a which-moon-is-more-worth-it perspective, I'm not sure since I don't really know the relevant details, but again, we know more about Europa.

But Enceladus orbits a lot closer to Saturn than Europa to Jupiter.

space,3dwtnq,bazzy3000,2,Mon Jul 20 10:03:31 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with the consensus so far and argue that Enceladus is a lower-risk destination more in line with current life-detecting technology. First, Saturn is better explored than the Jupiter system, meaning that the preliminary reconnaissance is more complete so we can do more advanced science. We know where the plumes erupt on Enceladus and what kind of instruments we'd need to test for left-handed chirality in organics. We know all about the advanced chemistry taking place on Titan and could target its northern seas with a floating lander. The Cassini orbiter has been at work for over a decade, while the Galileo orbiter didn't survive nearly as long, failed to deploy its large radio transmitter, and used tech that was a decade older.   Thus the second argument: that opportunities in the Saturn system are better aligned with current technology. Enceladus constantly pumps water vapor from its subsurface sea into space. Cassini has flown through these plumes multiple times so we know that they're safe. But Cassini mission planners never expected Enceladus to have plumes so its equipment can't provide very detailed analysis of the plumes' contents. All we have to do to potentially find left-handed chirality and therefore potential evidence of extraterrestrial life is execute the exact same mission but with the right equipment. Talk about low risk! (Europa might have sporadic plumes but this is not guaranteed and the frequency, location, and associated debris risk are unknown). Plus the Saturn system has Titan, which is yet another opportunity to find evidence for life. Jupiter on the other hand, has an extremely harsh radiation environment that reduces spacecraft lifetime and increases the risk of failure. The Europa clipper would reduce this by entering a polar orbit and doing Europa flybys but the mission duration is nowhere near the 15+ years Cassini will survive.  The other problem with Europa is that we know with near certainty, that we will not find life with the Europa clipper. Not to say that its not there, its just that the spacecraft won't be able to penetrate the kilometers of ice. We'll learn all about the ocean, but in the end, our geophysical knowledge of the body will be brought up to a comparable level to what we already know about Enceladus. And because outer solar system exploration takes place on a timescale of decades, the follow-up mission, that exploits all of this initial reconnaissance in order to actually search for alien life will be 20+ years away. Europa could very well be a more likely place to find life than Enceladus or Titan. But Enceladus and Titan are much more likely places to find life in the near future. With planetary exploration, finding life is the answer to all of our funding problems. Detect signs of life on Enceladus, and we'll be going to Europa in no time. I'm sure we all agree that we should go to both, but choose the wrong path of exploration and the wait could kill funding and thus our chances of finding out if we're alone in the solar system.

space,3dtzgj,twokswine,9,Sun Jul 19 13:18:16 2015 UTC,The only way we can get a fair indication of cratering in the outer outer solar system is by looking at Neptune's moon Proteus- which is heavily cratered. This is because the large moons of Uranus and Triton have all been resurfaced in the past and Voyager 2 wasn't good enough to image the any of the small ones except Proteus.  Proteus is heavily cratered so you'd expect the kuiper belt objects to be heavily cratered too.
space,3dtzgj,0thatguy,10,Sun Jul 19 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say for sure that Proteus is heavily cratered. The Voyager images have a low S/N ratio, so we don't know very much about it, other than the fact that it's relatively big and has a few craters. That's nowhere near good enough to have a statistical understanding of what outer Solar System bodies should look like.  Further, the Neptunian system is a bit of an odd duck, geologically speaking. It plays host to a captured KBO, which must have wreaked havoc with whatever was there to begin with, including destroying whatever moons were there to begin with. One common view is that Neptune's moons represent a graveyard system, where most of the moons are debris that reaccreted after Triton came through and smashed everything up. Thus, any cratering could represent this reaccretion event, not the normal cratering rate in this region of the Solar System.  Believe it or not, Uranus is probably the best place to get cratering rates in the outer Solar System because most of its moons, while tectonically influenced, have recognizably ancient terrain and a spectrum of landforms that vary in age. Unfortunately our data here is incomplete, so we have to support that with what we see on Saturn's moons. At that point we're well away from the Kuiper Belt, so it's hard to argue that it's a good representation of what we should see at Pluto.  As a result, the ""100 million year old"" terrain on Pluto could be a factor of four older or younger. That's not something that's been explained too much by the New Horizons team (although they have mentioned it offhand in their pressers), but you'll see it when they start to publish their data in the coming months."

space,3dured,Norose,2,Sun Jul 19 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. It should be equally acceptable to refer to it as ""Pluto-Charon,"" or just as ""Pluto,"" and let the context speak to whether one is just talking about Pluto, or the Pluto-Charon system.  Back when Pluto was demoted, I'm pretty sure the IAU would have accepted and preferred any definition that kept Pluto as a planet, that was as concise as the 3 part definition of planet that was adopted. We now have a lot more data on Pluto, and we can easily construct a better 3 part definition of Planet, that keeps Pluto-Charon in the fold.  Any planetary scientist will tell you these objects are what they are. They don't care if we call them planets, or dwarf planets, or minor planets, or asteroids, or even gods, which they are all named after. Quibbling about what is a planet is like lawyers quibbling over whether Balboa discovered the Pacific Ocean, not like scientists arguing a point of science. (BTW, I believe the Balboa lawsuit, the longest running lawsuit in history, was finally settled before the Spanish Supreme Court, about 10 years ago.)  My proposal for the definition of ""Solar System Planet,"" is   is in orbit around the Sun, has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape), and has an atmosphere and surface weathering on its major body.   ""On its major body,"" is all the definition I think I need to make it clear that the atmosphere and young surface of Pluto qualifies Pluto-Charon as a double planet.  I think we can be pretty confident that the definition of ""Planet"" will be changed again sometime in the next 10 years. Since we know the present definition is not set in stone, I think it is legitimate to debate what the new definition should be."

It does not fit your definition, unless you count it as having an atmosphere, in which case the moon also has an atmosphere, and atmosphere becomes an essentially meaningless term, covering everything from the envelope of a gas giant to a few stray atoms bouncing around.  Also, why only around the sun instead of around a star? Are large objects in orbit of other stars not planets? Exoplanets are planets which orbit other stars, just like Gas Giant planets are planets and Terrestrial planets are planets. The term dwarf planet is an umbrella that catches a range of objects, including rocky dwarf planets, icy dwarf planets, and many undiscovered or unimagined kinds of dwarf planet, and the same goes for true planets.  Pluto was never demoted, Pluto was reclassified. Just like somehow species on Earth get reclassified as new information comes to light."

Mercury has an atmosphere and the surface shows signs of weathering, though the mechanisms are different than what might operate on Pluto. I chose my wording to include Mercury and Pluto.  Please propose your own wording for the third criterion. Perhaps you will find a better one. I think a better one is out there somewhere. That is the debate I'm trying to encourage.   Also, why only around the sun instead of around a star?   Definitions for exoplanets and rogue planets are constrained by the capabilities of the instruments used to find them. Because objects in the Solar System are more easily observed, we can expand the definition a bit. Again, this is what I want to get at: Because we have observed Pluto up close, it informs our decision making about what criteria we can use to define a planet."

If you count that whisp of gasses as an atmosphere then pretty much every object in our solar system has an atmosphere. Which makes it kind of useless as a distinctive criteria. Here, I'll actually come up with a definition for 'atmosphere' that makes sense; Any gas envelope around any object, which is dense enough to allow an object to generate lift and fly through aerodynamic forces, without the object having to reach or exceed orbital velocity to generate enough lift to fly. There, that fits with our definition of the edge of space on Earth, the Karman line, and it makes sense. Any amount of gas so thin that an orbiting object could only barely lift or steer itself using aerodynamics is too thin to be considered a true atmosphere.   I have an issue with your method of picking criteria, which seems to hinge completely on the condition of including the 8 planets and Pluto. That's an unscientific way of labeling, it doesn't mater if Pluto becomes a planet yet you're trying to make it one again. The only thing that matters is making accurate and non arbitrary definitions of the objects we observe in order to help science and learn about the universe. The fact is that Pluto resembles the objects of the Kuiper belt much more than it resembles any of the planets in the solar system, and therefore deserves a label to set it and those other objects apart."

This Wikipedia article on the subject is a good resource showing a couple of methods for numerically determining the degree of neighborhood-clearing that an object is capable of, and has a table showing the values for various solar system objects that shows a large and distinctive gap between the planets and non-planets in this regard. There's also a physical basis for why there would be such a gap - once an object becomes large enough to start clearing its neighborhood it starts accreting a lot more small objects in the process and becomes even larger in a positive feedback loop. This means you'll almost never find an object that's ""kinda sorta"" able to clear its neighborhood - either they'll be hugely dominant or they'll be not at all dominant."

Location actually is important, I don't see what's wrong with that.  If you go by the Stern-Levison parameter, moving Earth out to Pluto's orbital radius still leaves it on the ""planet"" side of the line. You need to move it out to 2870 AU before its Stern-Levison parameter drops below 1. And the Soter planetary discriminant accounts for orbital resonance, so the fact that Earth's in an orbital resonance with Neptune would allow them both to remain planets. Haven't run the numbers on the Plutinos reducing the Soter discriminant of this displaced Earth below planethood, but give it a few million years and Earth will start clearing those out so it won't matter in the long run. That's kind of the point of being capable of ""clearing the neighborhood"" - competitors in your orbit don't last for very long. The Stern-Levison parameter indicates that Earth out at that orbital distance would be quite capable of scattering the Plutinos.  If you added a half-mass Jupiter twin somewhere in Jupiter's orbit, both would count as planets by their Stern-Levison parameters... briefly. They would collide in very short order since the new planet's too big relative to Jupiter to have a stable Trojan orbit. By the Soter planetary discriminant they'd both lose planet status as long as the two existed separately, but that wouldn't be for very long due to their impending collision.

I fall somewhere in the Nominalist camp: I think math is a symbolic language that describes the universe better than organic human languages, but the the fact that it is imperfect and constantly evolving proves that it is neither something that fundamentally exists nor something that perfectly expresses anything at any given time.  The narrator of the video explains that pi brings Nominalism into question because it's an irrational number, but that just demonstrates our current numerical system is imperfect to express a certain relationship - i.e., the relationship of diameter to circumference of a circle.  The same could be said of all irrational numbers: That they are simply cases where the current numerical system is inadequate.  I would say that the paradox of dividing by zero also does not bring math into discredit, but simply reflects the fact that our current logic is inadequate to express that attempted operation.

Against- Man needed to understand the world around him and had to construct math for human advancement. A good example of this is time. It's a highly debated topic but there are many groups of people who believe it is a human made construct. Same could be said about mathematics. It might be how we, humans, perceive the universe around us. They also talk about how certain quantum mathematics and other big picture mathematics still don't line up.

If they were exactly 8:13, and the separation between line-drawings was in phase with the 8 revolutions of Earth, then the pattern would persist indefinitely."

Since they had a head start in the space race, they were desperate to stay ahead of the US and so a lot of the time they would launch rockets into space without proper engineering inspection. As a result, Soviet space missions frequently suffered from major faults in spacecraft design, resulting in several cases of spacecraft decompression, or just having the rocket blow up on the launch pad.  In short, the USSR was a lot less careful than the US was, and their designs were not tested for bugs as much. An example of this was when they were testing the main booster for a rocket they hoped would take Russian cosmonauts to the Moon. Something went wrong, so a bunch of officials and engineers literally walked onto the launch pad to inspect the rocket. The booster rocket exploded shortly after, killing 92 of the USSR's top military officials and aerospace engineers.  Basically, the Soviets tried to stay ahead of the race by rushing rocket designs without properly testing them. The US took things slow, making sure that their designs were safe and reliable. The USSR remained ahead of the US in the beginning of the space race, but as their ambitions got bigger and bigger their way of doing things simply didn't cut it, and the US managed to surpass them."

Development of R-16 had almost nothing to do with Soviet space program other than some generic and vague points. The accident occured in 1960, months before the first flight of Gagarin. In this stage it wasn't even a 'race'. Although the actual Soviet lunar rocket, N1, failed all four times, there were no casualties involved.

space,3du1g3,iAMtHESushighost,8,Sun Jul 19 13:41:56 2015 UTC,"It's not a platinum asteroid.  That's news hype.  It's an iron-nickel asteroid from the core of a former large asteroid.  Platinum-group metals are iron-loving, so they sank to the core along with the iron.  That's why those metals are rare on Earth, they sank to the core here too.  Recent radar data from Arecibo indicates it is a solid object, 0.5 x 1 km in size and ellipsoidal.  In other words, it's a giant metal football.  From the shape, we can estimate the volume as 131 million cubic meters, and the mass as about a billion tons.  Platinum occurs at about 25 parts per million, based on analysis of metallic meteorites that fell to Earth.  So there would be ~ 25,000 tons of Platinum, or ~800 million troy ounces, worth $800 billion at current spot prices.  The higher number in the trillions in the media probably comes from the total market price of all the rare elements, not just Platinum.  Nickel averages about 10% of metallic asteroids, with a range of 6-21% ( see Figure I.2 of Hoashi, 1990 at page 5 ).  At the market price of $11,500/ton, it would be worth $1.1 trillion by itself.  Since stainless steels are typically 10% nickel, the whole bulk of the asteroid is stainless minus the 18% Chromium we add to it to make the complete alloy.  But the Nickel by itself is worth more than the Platinum, and all rare elements combined are worth much more.  Getting back to your question, world Platinum production last year was 161 tons, so the asteroid represents a 150 year supply at current rates.  What mining this entire asteroid would do to prices depends on how fast you deliver it to the Earth market.  A processing plant capable of doing a billion tons of ore isn't a trivial matter.    Conversely, just dropping chunks of the asteroid to Earth is much less work, and it represents a 40 year supply of the world's Nickel for making stainless and other high quality alloys.  Whether to process it on the ground to extract the rare elements is an open question.  It's a higher grade ore than we mine on Earth, but it is also chunks of steel alloy, and not suitable for things like crushing that we do to ore on Earth.  It is a similarly strong material as the crusher jaws.  Whole new processes would have to be designed.  What is pretty certain is running a billion tons through plants on Earth is easier than in space."
space,3du1g3,danielravennest,2,Sun Jul 19 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"The main thing of value we would gain would be the ability to mine entire asteroids. Remember, this isn't just thousands of tons of platinum, but billions of tons of pre-launched steel. If we want to mine and process it, we would need to convert some of that steel to robots that do the mining for us. So at the end of the day, you have millions of robots in space. Those robots can be adapted to other purposes -- machining the parts for habitats, space based solar power collectors, etc.  Now you have to wonder, would these space based machines have their own uses for platinum? Probably. So the extreme increase in available platinum might not depress the market as much as one would naively think. Would people who specifically invested in platinum futures lose money? Probably. Those who sold short on platinum futures would likewise make a fortune. Would the earth be far richer than it is today? Definitely -- it would have a substantial space based manufacturing industry, something it currently lacks. Would the investors in the project get their money back? Oh yeah."

Using the propellant that the asteroid itself provides, machining the rocketry from the asteroid, and concentrating solar energy for the power, it's relatively cheap.  Not saying the first time we try this should be with a huge asteroid in the real world -- starting smaller (or using a smaller chunk) would make more sense (at least if we are trying to move it to a circular earth orbit before we do anything useful with it). There are a lot of asteroids to choose from.

Big spread. Problem is, demand is increasing, more or less independent of price (China wants more domestic cars, Pt is a small fraction of the cost of a car), but not independent of the global economy (boom and recession) plus, there are lags in production in response to price.   World production was just under 250MT in 2011. This asteroid is believed to carry ""up to"" 90MT, of Pt, or about  one third of our global annual production. That's not all coming down at once (we hope). Making a hand-waving onageristic approximation, I'd say it might increase global output by 1% percent each month over the course of five years. Probably not enough to impact prices.  As for the cost, getting up there and lassoing the thing is the hard part. Establishing the base is next, Mining is mostly carving it up with solar powered equipment.

To some extent, that opinion has been proven true, and major aerospace companies outside of NewSpace such as Arianespace and ULA have begun restructuring themselves to better compete with it.  But some people who don't pay much attention to space issues, while for some reason still being motivated to comment on them, seem to think NewSpace is some sort of privatization of NASA by corporations trying to pillage it, and that couldn't be further from the truth.    It's the exact opposite: An attempt to lower costs through commercial scaling so that NASA can do more with its budget, and so that everyone besides a few NASA astronauts also has access to space some day."

We can also calculate its mass by his velocity and orbit, and from photos we know its volume, so we can calculate the average density. This, together with the fact that more dense elements will get packed in the inner region will help qualifying which molecules the asteroid consists off.  This asteroid has probably a big amount of platinum on the surface and is very dense, so we can conclude that there is much more platinum on the inside."

space,3dulan,jccwrt,4,Sun Jul 19 19:43:55 2015 UTC,"No, the camera was turned off in early 2002, as a result of increasingly severe radiation damage (it was producing completely white images during close approaches to Jupiter) and the subsequent difficulty of justifying its continued use in the mission budget. The last pictures were taken on January 17, 2002, when it flew past Io at only 100 km away.  However, if the Galileo probe has continued using its camera, it would have been unable to photograph its atmospheric descent for two reasons. First, it would have burned up and crushed well before it reached the cloud decks, so it would have been unable to see anything more than regional cloud patterns. Second, the high-gain antenna on the spacecraft was crippled, meaning its data had to be sent back to Earth through its low-gain antenna, which was designed to work at only 8-16 bits per second. Although some new signal processing technologies allowed NASA to retrieve data at 160 bits per second, this would have been too slow to return pictures even if Galileo could survive the atmospheric entry.  Because of the high-gain antenna problem, NASA never really bothered to take many pictures of Jupiter, saving room on the spacecraft's tape recorder for images taken during flybys of the moons and for more scientifically useful spectroscopic data on the atmosphere. It did take a picture of the Great Red Spot, though."

space,3dtjv0,quithyot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"you got me thinking here, i'm not sure how to explain... but let's think together (maybe someone will help)...  let's assume our values for orbit radius and orbit velocity are stable, and now run some hipothetical scenarios:  1a. same orbit radius, gradually increase orbit velocity: the planet's orbit will become more eccentric and eventually reach the necessary velocity to escape the host star and effectively not orbit anymore (becomes a rogue planet - output scenario A).  1b. same orbit radius, gradually decrease orbit velocity: the planet's orbit will become more eccentric, the planet won't be able to move enough distance to keep falling around the host star and eventually collides with the star (output scenario B).  2a. same orbit velocity, gradually increase orbit radius: output scenario B.  2b. same orbit velocity, gradually decrease orbit radius: output scenario A.  Curious fact: the dark matter problem presents itself because we estimated the total mass of many galaxies and realised that if that were true all stars would fly off of the black hole (galaxy centre). And because they don't, we infered that there must be some more mass we failed to account. This mass is not like ordinary matter because it's invisible and collisionless - we only know it's there because we can feel its gravity. For more information search for: law of conservation of angular momentum; -AND- kepler's second law of planetary motion.  After nailing these points (newton and kepler), you could also read on frame dragging and gravitational time dilation (einstein). Only using general relativity you can explain mercury's orbit... long story short: this is because planet's too close to the host start experience time differently."

space,3drszu,Jonks,4,Sun Jul 19 00:13:14 2015 UTC,"Probably not, Pluto's core would have to spin like Earth's and I don't think it's massive enough"
space,3drszu,PatyxEU,3,Sun Jul 19 00:34:44 2015 UTC,The core of the planet does not have to spin for it to be magnetized. Venus has an induced magnetosphere and I'm not sure that its core spins.

space,3drszu,cosmic-bread,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"So that is happening because Pluto is small and had small gravity, or is there other reason why the atmosphere is lost in space?"
space,3drszu,trogon,3,Sat Jul 18 22:08:36 2015 UTC,"The solar wind berates it and due to Pluto being so small, the atmosphere is stripped away a lot easier than from a larger planet like Earth. It's also unclear whether or not Pluto has a magnetosphere, and if it doesn't that would definitely be a contributing factor."

The James Web space telescope should be launching in a couple years, which will be more powerful than Hubble but with more sensitivity in the infrared spectrum. China plans another moon lander and moon rover in the next couple years I believe.

It would make more sense to use the SLS's 8+m fairing and send a one-piece mirror. I think that the U of Az has a 8m spinning oven and can turn those babies out like pizzas and soon we will have the lifting power with SLS to deliver one of those beasts.

No, SLS got delayed sever times and it is on schedule now, but keep in mind budgeting shenanigans are liable to happen - especially on an election year. Furthermore the whole is not the sum of its parts. Just because those components worked on the shuttle doesn't mean they'll work as well on the SLS.

space,3ds7by,BitttBurger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:10:07 2015 UTC,There isn't anything particularly of interest about the bright spots - the excitement was just because we didn't realise what could be causing it at first until the higher res images came in. The rest of Ceres has a low albedo and we've pretty much ascertained that the bright spots are either ice or crystalline salts.

Next week might be the most exciting week of all, because I think they will have a larger set of photos than last week, covering a representative mosaic across the whole sunlit side of the planet. There will also be spectra and other data, so maybe some of the questions that last Friday's photos raised will be answered.  Friday is typically a slow news day, so the NH team may have picked Friday for their press conference day because they have a better chance of dominating the front pages of the world's newspapers. Most of the world shows a lot more interest in the NH photos than America does.  Late next month Dawn will be getting to a lower orbit around Ceres, and will start returning high resolution pictures.

The decadal divides mission into small missions in the Discovery program (MESSENGER, Kepler, Stardust, etc), medium sized missions in the New Frontiers program (New Horizons, Juno, and the not-yet launched OSIRIS REx) and large Flagship mission (Voyager 1 & 2, Galileo, Cassini, Mars 2020). The higher tier the program is the more guidance the Decadal gives. So for the Discovery program all they to is to recommend a steady stream of varied mission. For the New Frontiers program they have a list from which NASA is adviced to choose for the 4th and 5th NF mission. These are: Comet Surface Sample Return, Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return, Saturn Probe, Trojan Tour and Rendezvous, and Venus In Situ Explorer for NF-4, and those not chosen for NF-4 plus the Io Observer and Lunar Geophysical Network for NF-5.  For the Flagship program they actually rank them by priority. And these are: One, the Mars Astrobiology and Caching Rover (which would find and store samples to be, hopefully returned to Earth in the future), or MAX-C, which comes in at $3.5 billion. Two, the Jupiter Europa Orbiter, costing $4.7b. Three: Coming in at $2.7b, a Uranus orbiter and probe. And finally, in a combined fourth place, an Enceladus Orbiter or a Venus Climate mission, costing $1.9b and $2.4b respectively.  That's a lot of money...  However, NASA does actually have two missions in the works that will meet the science goals of MAX-C and JEO. The Mars 2020 rover will have a caching system on board (here's an animation from Honeybee Robotics showing what it would look like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NphWPvi9cy4) and the objectives of the Europa Orbiter will be accomplished by the Europa Clipper mission. Mars 2020 costs about $1.5b and the Clipper $2.1b, which saves about $4.6b for those two missions. Which IMO (and that of committee) should be spend on the Discovery program first, to ensure a regular cadence of varied missions, New Frontiers second, in order to make sure that NF-4 and 5 are build and launched, and the Uranus Orbiter third.

Water is highly polar and an excellent solvent for dissolving polar solids like salt. In fact it's the most common solvent we use for almost everything.  Methane atoms are non-polar because of their shape. They have hydrogen atoms spaced evenly around a central carbon atom so they don't have a positive and negative end. Non-polar substances however can be good solvents for other non-polar substances. You'll note there are a lot of solvents sold made from liquid hydrocarbons, (which tend to be non polar) designed to dissolve non-polar substances that water doesn't work well on.  edit  Hydrogens around the central Carbon, not vice versa."

As for the dark material, not really enough data go say. To speculate: this terrain appears to be very similar to subpolar and glacial terrains here on Earth. This dark material might be mixed in with ice and getting preferentially deposited in the troughs. My guess is that the dark material is tholin, a dark tarlike substance that forms from interaction of methane and nitrogen when exposed to UV and cosmic radiation. But that's an educated guess, not an expert opinion."

space,3dn75z,MoparSamurai,19,Fri Jul 17 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"I should clarify. Tholins are tarlike in composition, not behavior. It's made up of heavily networked carbon atoms with a lot of aromatic rings.   It actually has a tendency to form pollen-sized macromolecules, and these would rain out on the surface as a form of dust. If there's any wind at all, loose tholins would blow around and accumulate in cracks, and if they're landing and freezing in glacial ice, they'll be carried en masse to areas that are melting and deposited. Getting stuck in a tholin drift would be less like getting stuck in a tar pit and more like burying yourself in sand at the beach."

Here is a simple diagram that depicts how one such pattern may develop. On Pluto, I would assume that there is some sort of shallow convection driving and generating these patterns.

space,3dn75z,Eltee95,5,Fri Jul 17 21:34:14 2015 UTC,I think part of the reason that Pluto's orbit is so pristine is that the center of mass of the Pluto/Charon system is outside of Pluto's volume. This would mean that any asteroids would actually be drawn away from the surface. I have a feeling that the backside of pluto has a much higher volume of impact craters.
space,3dn75z,topherwhelan,8,Fri Jul 17 18:12:03 2015 UTC,"The most significant craters are going to be from large/fast objects, which are the ones least affected by the local gravitational field. Also, earth's moon has plenty of craters and does not have the barycenter inside its volume.  Active geology pretty much has to be part of the solution here."
space,3dn75z,EtaTauri,3,Fri Jul 17 19:13:27 2015 UTC,"Earth and Luna's barycenter is still within Earth, isn't it?"

space,3dn75z,EtaTauri,14,Fri Jul 17 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"I'm probably wrong, but could the relative/visible smoothness be related to the fact that Pluto sublimates its surface ice when it gets nearer to the Sun?"
space,3dn75z,js1138-2,5,Fri Jul 17 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"That's a good question, and while I don't have an exact answer, I would guess that sublimation would still preserve some surface irregularities rather than smoothing everything over evenly. So if sublimation were the only dynamic force shaping the surface, we would probably still see craters, but they would look much softer than the sharp crater edges we see on our own moon, for example."

I heard something about the oscillation between pluto and its buddy charon causing the dwarf planet to expand and contract creating enough friction to melt some ice and produce liquid water deep beneath the surface.
space,3dn75z,b1ak3,13,Fri Jul 17 21:13:27 2015 UTC,"Pluto and Charon are tidally locked, so they no longer exchange any tidal energy. That means that the gravitational energy of their orbits can no longer contribute to any frictional heating of their interiors, but it doesn't rule out the existence of subsurface oceans on either body.  In fact, one possible explanation for the 'youngness' of Pluto's surface is that the slow freezing of an internal ocean is releasing enough heat to drive on-going geology on the surface."
space,3dn75z,jdbell1994,6,Fri Jul 17 21:13:29 2015 UTC,Fascinating. It's incredible that the freezing of a substance can create heat. Science and space will always astound me. Care to tell how you came by all this info?

space,3dn75z,art_is_science,10,Fri Jul 17 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"Heat is energy, which technically can't be created or destroyed, just converted and transported. When something freezes it's because it's losing heat - and that heat has to go somewhere. If you put water in your freezer, the heat energy in the water flows into the cold air, then from the air into the coolant in the pipes at the back, then out of a heat exchanger into the air behind your freezer.   In Pluto, if there's an ocean that's warmer than the surface, the heat will flow from the ocean into the surface - cooling the ocean (eventually freezing it) and warming the surface.  Most of this is just a rephrasing of what the mission scientists from New Horizons said in their press conference on Wednesday when commenting on the images ('July 15 Media Briefing' here). But the study of heat energy and how it moves and changes is called thermodynamics, and of course there's plenty of planetary science and astronomy to learn."

Although it would be pretty surprising for a body the size of Pluto to have much radioactive material left in it's core (the much larger Mars, for example, is no longer producing enough heat from radiation to keep it's interior molten). Regardless of where the heat is coming from, I'm sure the answer will be fascinating, and cause us to refine a lot of what we know about planetary science."

space,3dn75z,manbergur,16,Fri Jul 17 22:36:45 2015 UTC,"We can if we want to, but there are several definitions of those directions even on Earth, so it gets a bit difficult.   We have true North, which is based on how the Earth rotates around its axis. Then we have magnetic North, which is where your compass points - good enough for most purposes, but the magnetic poles of Earth aren't fixed relative to its rotation, they wander around a bit, aren't symmetrical, and flip every few hundred thousand years. We also have grid North, which is pretty close to true North but not always as an artifact of how the geometry of drawing maps of a sphere on a flat piece of paper works.  For bodies other than the Earth, it gets even trickier. Not all planets have a magnetic field like ours to point a compass, and for the ones that do it doesn't necessarily line up with their rotational axis. The rotational axes are all different (not all the planets line up), Uranus is on its side (rotational axis points at the Sun) and Venus rotates backwards (clockwise if you look down on it from above Earth's North pole).  So we generally try to assign the other planets compass directions based on their rotational axis, with North being the one that's closest to pointing the same direction as Earth's rotational North, and then just roll with it - but that's not always easy."

Additionally, Pluto's atmosphere is extremely thin, around 100,000 to 1 million times thinner than Earth's atmosphere. At these low pressures, Nitrogen sublimes directly from a solid to a gas without going through a liquid phase, and freezes from a gas directly into nitrogen frost."

space,3drw64,ericwdhs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"The ""could"" is definitely important. Instead of reading as ""evidence that panspermia happened,"" in which case you'd be on to something, it's really just ""evidence that panspermia is possible.""  But yeah, cool article. I'm not so much interested in learning whether or not life here originated that way as in learning the raw probabilities of it happening anywhere. The idea that one planet can potentially lead to a galaxy filled with life without any intelligent dispersal is fascinating."
space,3drw64,olympicmew,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"It surely improves the probabilities of life existing in more places, but even if it can survive the void of space in a quiescent state it still has to find the conditions to thrive, and those are quite the bottleneck. I can see it spread around a star system (like Earth bacteria spreading to Jupiter's moons and awake when the Sun goes red giant and the climate gets warmer that far out) more than the whole galaxy: that would probably take more time than it would take for indigenous life to emerge in those places, probably."
space,3drw64,ericwdhs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:26:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a decent dispersal rate depends on overwhelming numbers, impacts that eject thousands or millions of life-carrying particles out of the host system of which only a few will ever find someplace to take hold. As far as we know, impacts of this scale happen pretty regularly, and the number of rogue bodies out in space is predicted to be close to or beyond the number of star-bound bodies.  As for the timescales, for objects travelling at typical escape velocities, the journey to a neighboring star system is likely anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 years. That's indeed a long time to us, but it's short in cosmological terms. It could be short in relation to abiogenesis as well, but we know next to nothing about that. Anyway, if you run with the 50,000 years and assume a regularly refueled, evenly expanding, spherical dispersal cloud (refueled meaning debris from newly seeded planets joins the cloud every so often), you could cover a galaxy the size of the Milky Way in half a billion years. That's optimistic, but I don't think covering a galaxy in a few billion years is all that unlikely assuming panspermia works at all."
space,3dt38s,drspankinya,3,Sun Jul 19 04:46:04 2015 UTC,"Not really. Signals from spacecraft already move at the speed of light, the absolute speed limit of the universe. The only thing such a mission could do is act as a relay, receiving signals from a distant spacecraft and amplifying them. That's not really necessary generally, except in rare cases, like satellite relays to keep manned crews in communication with ground controllers during re-entry. The Voyagers can still talk directly to terrestrial stations without by sort of relay."
space,3dt38s,dragonhunter21,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:03:48 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything you said. The only example that I can think of would be a satellite relay that was in place to bounce a signal from a space probe or spacecraft (with astronauts aboard) that was not in direct line-of-sight with Earth - where the space craft was being occulded for a period by another planetary body (a planet or Moon for example).   During the Apollo program, they actually considered (briefly and not very seriously, but still considered) one of the later ""J"" Mission lunar landings to be conducted on the far side of the Moon. Tsiokovskiy Crater was one far side target that, among others, Apollo 17 LMP Jack Schmidt (the only astro-geologist/scientist to go to the Moon) tried advocating for prior to the near-side target of Taurus Littrow being selected for his mission, which was the last to visit the Moon.   The idea was to put a surplus comm satellite in high elliptical lunar orbit (giving the sat a direct line of sight of both Earth and the crew on the far side) so that if the astronauts landed on the far side of the Moon, they could bounce all their comms and telemetry off that satellite to Earth, allowing for near-real time direct comms to still be possible during landing, lunar surface EVA activities, and liftoff from the lunar surface."
space,3dt38s,Falcon109,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:48:41 2015 UTC,"I took the question to be more like increasing the bandwidth of the data instead of the latency.  Certainly the minimum time to transfer information will always be constrained by the speed of light, but by increasing the bandwidth you could transfer more data per packet.   This is one of the reasons why the Mars rover Curiosity transmits to the orbiters instead of directly with Earth (which it can do in an emergency).  So in theory, yes, it's possible to put a satellite constellation in various orbits that could act as relays to increase the bandwidth of transferred data which would decrease the time a picture would take to receive. The cost would however be enormous and probably not worth it when they can transmit back to Earth already now (albeit very slowly)."
space,3dt38s,Druggedhippo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:19:10 2015 UTC,"A large space-based radio telescope or radio array would absolutely help cut down on time.  It would still be limited by light speed, but signals from spacecraft could carry more bandwidth without packet loss, so it would speed things up a lot.    As for keeping 24/7 communication with earth, it would require a constellation of 3 or more relay satellites in a solar orbit, but given vast time and resources it could definitely be done with our current technology."

I'm pretty sure that that's not going to be possible. A ship that doesn't need to carry humans on board can be built to have a better acceleration tolerance and mass fraction than one that does need to carry humans on board, so the AI will be able to produce ships that get closer to the speed of light than human-carrying escape vessels for the same level of technology. Worse, the fleeing human ship has a design and fuel load that's fixed at the moment of launch, whereas the AI back on Earth will be able to continue developing new technology and building more capable interceptors to send out after the humans. It'll eventually catch up if it really wants to.  My personal plan would be to use our foreknowledge of the AI's development to try to prevent it or modify it so that it won't be hostile when it arises.  Failing that, use my ship-building resources to build a lot of slow escape ships rather than one ultra-fast one and hope that it won't care to go after us. Head for the Kuiper belt, and if it looks like the AI's going to continue expanding that far go with interstellar slow boats. Cryogenic suspension would be best, ships with low speeds and low waste heat signatures might get ""lost"" in the interstellar darkness.

From here: http://www.mvas-ny.org/php/TTArticle.php?articleID=88   A perfect opportunity to launch the Pluto Orbiter Probe comes whenever Jupiter is in the correct position to allow a slingshot towards Pluto. Such a window of opportunity lasts a few years and the next one occurs later in the decade. A launch date of December 17, 2016 using ESA's powerful Ariane 5 rocket has been proposed. The probe would fly past Jupiter on June 29, 2018 for a gravity assist and would arrive at Pluto on June 3, 2033 for orbital capture. It would settle into a circular orbit of about 600 miles above Pluto's surface 316 days later. Detailed global mapping would be under way by June 2034.

The Pluto neighborhood is really gaunt for solar, to the point you need to use a nuclear battery, or get fancy with ultra low consumption electronics, plus giant mylar solar arrays...even then youd still be scraping.  which would then make data an issue.  The ESA also has some uniqu e requirements for cooperation aboard the craft---different parts and experiments need to be from different countries.  Integrating these systems is somewhat time intensive.  If cassini or juno were around to relay, I guess you could try to cheat on the antenna gain... But then they will only be around so long until they go out of phase.  ESA has never done a nuclear battery spacecraft.  They would have to pull the plutonium out of a hat, and borrow the tech from the USA.  And it's unlikely to, given the nuclear backlash post Fukushima.  And the kind of crazy mylar solar array is untested... You Generally don't put untested tech on expensive tier one missions.  To;Dr a lot of brand new development is necessary, there is not time to do it, it would have to be a clone of cassini/Galileo/new horizons, all of which us USA nuclear batteries.  I agree its a shame the window will be missed given the really active geology on. Pluto which is crazy cool.

If we want to get this technical, ""infinity"" is not a number, it is a concept, and therefore can't be used in mathematical equations the way you would use a number. The real answer here is that x/∞ is undefined. You CAN however say that the LIMIT of x/n as n approaches infinity is zero. For all practical purposes this might as well be zero, but it isn't actually the same as being zero. Here's a good link elaborating on this idea. Here's my own example of why  x/∞ = 0 is not a valid mathematical statement.   Let's assume x/∞ = 0 where x is a real number.     now lets use the multiplicative property of equality to multiply both sides of the equation by ∞ giving us x/∞∞=0∞     Simplifying that we get x = 0*∞  or ""infinity times zero equals a real number.""    This statement is obviously false, which therefore means that the statement  x/∞ = 0 is also false.    EDIT: Formatting"
space,3dq1fg,Meaderlord,2,Sun Jul 19 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, in that we can see some of the universe, and saying we've seen zero of it implies that we can't see anything at all. I would say the quantity itself just doesn't tell the whole story in this case. Just as a sure event and an almost sure event both have probability one, an unexplored infinite universe and an explored infinite universe both have exploration ratio zero.  Like if I flip two coins, tell you the total number of heads, and ask you what the first coin is showing. If the total is zero or two, you can figure it out, but if the total is one, you can't. The same measure contains less information in some cases.  x / infinity = 0 may be informal, but it's common enough that Wolfram Alpha will compute it without any notes. In physics, we use this all the time. It's easier than always writing out the limit. Your link is the first I've seen that calls that ratio undefined.  Your infinitesimal is also just a concept, and as infinity doesn't formally belong outside limits, infinitesimal (often denoted dx or dy) doesn't formally belong outside differentials and integrals. To say that a ratio of two quantities is equal to infinitesimal doesn't feel right. To quote my calculus professor, ""that wasn't really Leibniz's intention.""  One more thing I want to point out: the quantities zero times infinity and infinity over infinity are both indeterminate forms. That's an expression that carries no information; it could literally be anything. So your expression:  x/∞∞=0∞  actually says:  x * (something) = (the same thing, or something else)  That's a true statement, but it isn't useful for proving anything. Indeterminate forms often show up when you use infinity and infinitesimal arithmetically, but x / infinity isn't generally one."

SDSS measured photometry for 5*108 stars.

Some of the dimmest stars have absolute magnitude of +15, and would be appear at about +34 on the other side of the galaxy (if nothing obstructs the line of sight). The Hubble XDF detected objects down to +31. This isn't a useful way to catalog large numbers of stars: if you wanted to map the whole sky like this, with Hubble long exposures, it'd take millions of years.

space,3dopft,daneeka10,3,Sat Jul 18 00:20:46 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited for this one. The nature of the core of gas giants such as Jupiter has always been one of the questions most interesting to me.   There are theories that the core could be a metallic hydrogen (I believe it's hydrogen anyway, correct me if I'm wrong) due to the immense pressure from the massive amount of gravity. It could be a solid. Could be anything!! So incredible. And finding out the answer to this mystery is going to give us a substantial amount of information regarding the formation of solar systems.   One question though; It said the mission is going to last for so many months... What is the plan for Juno after the initial mission is completed? Are they just going to crash it into Jupiter again like the Galileo spacecraft or are they planning to return it to earth? Will it continue to stay in orbit like Cassini or will they slingshot it with Jupiter's gravity into the outer solar system? Up until reading this article I was thinking it was going to be somewhat like Cassini where Juno will stay in orbit to continue photographing the planet while also performing fly-by missions of Jupiter's moons. Especially considering the interest in Europa. I realize a spacecraft designed specifically for Europa and the instruments it will contain was recently released but there are still many fascinating moons like Io for instance, the most volcanically active body in the solar system, that I can't imagine would be left unobserved with a spacecraft already there that is capable. Am I wrong in assuming it can be powered long enough to accomplish this?"
space,3dopft,bcarter12,3,Sat Jul 18 11:30:41 2015 UTC,"It's solar powered (which is itself an interesting advancement in spacecraft design, since it's traveling farther from the sun than all other solar powered craft).  Therefore it won't just run out of power.  My understanding is that its orbit around Jupiter will take it through strong magnetic fields and belts of high radiation.  That's by design, since its primary objectives involve mapping the magnetic field and the charged particles that make up the radiation belts.  It's been hardened and shielded to survive in such an environment, but even then it's expected to gradually break down over the course of months and years.  Its camera, for example, is only expected to last a few months.  Even if it does last, I don't think it has any spare fuel to fly by the moons, nor instruments that are designed for observations of the moons."
space,3dopft,lazybratsche,2,Sat Jul 18 14:22:15 2015 UTC,"It's actually unavoidable. Its main object is to get close to Jupiter's clouds -- about 4,000 km, or 0.06 Jupiter radii. If it does so, it will eventually end up in a radiation belt.  Here's a good graphic that shows how this progresses:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)#/media/File:Juno_trajectory_through_radiation_belts.png  To avoid the radiation belts, it flies inside the inner torus, through the gaps at the poles. That's survivable; but the orbit that allows it, isn't stable. Jupiter's mass oblateness causes it to precess in its plane (the orbit's high eccentricity makes this effect particularly strong). While the early orbits will fly through the polar radiation gap, the later orbits are dragged off-axis, and will miss the gap."
space,3dopft,throwaway_MZ3Ji8yc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:50:57 2015 UTC,"Are they just going to crash it into Jupiter again like the Galileo spacecraft    Yes, because its orbit will take it deep inside Jupiter's radiation belts (the scary colors), which will fry its electronics. They're going to intentionally crash it into Jupiter before that happens. Otherwise, it'd end up as uncontrolled space debris, and would likely crash into one of the moons.   or are they planning to return it to earth?   No, it'd be fuel-expensive to do that, and wouldn't accomplish anything. Juno isn't collecting samples or anything like that.   Some future probes could do something like that. For one example, a probe might try to fly through an ice geyser at Enceladus, at high speed, and return samples to earth. This could capture microbial life from Encleadus' ocean.  http://futureplanets.blogspot.com/2012/12/life-sample-return-for-enceladus.html   Will it continue to stay in orbit like Cassini or will they slingshot it with Jupiter's gravity into the outer solar system?

Especially one like Europa which is a possible candidate for supporting life. Potential contamination is much too risky.   When it comes to when I was talking about a return to earth I was thinking more along the lines of getting a gravitational slingshot from Jupiter and its moons so they would only have to use fuel for accuracy rather than speed, correct? But maybe that's not even a possible scenario, I'm not sure.  You also spoke of flying a spacecraft through the geysers from Enceladus. Cassini actually already did that. It obviously didn't bring the samples back home to earth like you mentioned but it was able to detect the ingredients.   Thank you again, though. That was very helpful and learning that it will be actually flying into the outer gas layers of Jupiter makes it that much more interesting. I am just so excited for that mission.

space,3dq02v,Jangalit,23,Sat Jul 18 09:08:58 2015 UTC,"I'm going to talk about similarities.  Orion looks like an enlarged Apollo capsule. Dragon has a more efficient volume-enclosing shape, sort of like the shape of Soyuz, but Dragon has reentry aerodynamics that are almost identical to Apollo, and much better than Soyuz.  Soyuz relies on a single parachute to land, like Mercury and Gemini. Dragon and Orion use 3 parachutes, like Apollo. The odds of 1 parachute failing are greater when 3 are bumping into each other, but the consequences of a parachute failure are not so bad!  Dragon 1 lands in the sea without retro rockets. Dragon 2 will, and Soyuz does, land on land with the use of retro rockets, but the Soyuz rockets are solids that fire so violently that a normal landing in a Soyuz has been described as ""like low speed a car crash."" Dragon 2 landings will be much gentler. I don't know what Orion does.  Everybody uses Hydrazine or Hydrazine-NTO for maneuvering thrusters. It's just the most reliable, and you can store the propellants for years.  Heat shields: lots of differences. I don't know what to say.  Avionics: Soyuz has undergone many upgrades in this area over the decades. They now use essentially the same level of technology as Orion will use. Dragon 1 and Dragon 2 use much more advanced microcomputers and software, running about 1000 times faster. The Dragons use ~off the shelf~ computers running Unix with real time/run time modifications, and lots of networked voting to make sure a computer is cut out of the loop if it shows a radiation induced error. 1000 times faster computers allow Dragons to have more sensors, and to be able to handle more error conditions in the spacecraft early, to prevent them from becoming serious problems. Unix is vastly more reliable than the proprietary operating systems developed for spacecraft in the 1960s and 1970s. I cannot stress this enough. Probably the biggest advantage Dragon has is the superior software. I talked with a member of the Dawn space probe team about this, and I don't think I am exaggerating when I say the crappy old proprietary operating systems are buggy, and require painstaking testing for even the simplest of changes, while in Unix you can change lots of code with a high degree of confidence that if your code is well written, the OS will not introduce undocumented bugs. We live in the age of software. Orion and Soyuz are still catching up."
space,3dq02v,peterabbit456,6,Sat Jul 18 15:29:54 2015 UTC,Wow! Thank you so much for this precise answer! I'm going to find something on the heat shields then :D
space,3dq02v,Norose,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"Orion uses a heat shield made of Avcoat, an ablative material that was first developed for and used by the Apollo program. Avcoat protects the spacecraft by the Leidenfrost effect, as thin layers of the Avcoat vaporize the gasses produced push the much hotter reentry plasma away from the spacecraft. It is a proven technology with lots of testing and experience. Orion also has a thermal tile system on the surfaces facing away from the direction of reentry, to shield from the heated plasma around the spacecraft as it reenters. The tiles used are the same ones that were used on the Space Shuttle. The heat shield Orion uses is symmetrical and about 5 inches thick.  Dragon 2 uses an improved version of the material Pica called Pica X which can withstand even higher temperatures and is lighter and stronger. Pica was used to make the heat shield on the Stardust probe return capsule, and had to be able to withstand a much higher level of heating compared to a return from lunar altitude. Pica X is an improved material that is more resistant to cracking and therefore can be made in larger chunks, as well as having better thermal properties allowing Dragon 2 to return from an interplanetary trajectory and not require the heat shield to be replaced. The heat shield on Dragon 2 will most likely be asymmetrical, similar to the heat shield currently used on Dragon. Engineers at SpaceX realized that since capsules offset their center of mass in order to deflect air and control their rate of descent, one side of the heat shield would always be getting more heating than the rest of the shield. Therefore, instead of making the shield the same thickness all over, they made it thicker where there would be the most heat and thinner everywhere else, saving weight. It is unknown at this point how Dragon 2 will protect its non-reentry facing sides, but it will probably use a similar thermal protection system as Orion.  And I have no idea how Soyuz heat shields work, but considering how old the Soyuz design is, I would guess that ablative materials and paints are involved."

space,3dq02v,earthdeparturestage,2,Sun Jul 19 01:28:37 2015 UTC,"The tiles are perfectly fine on a capsule, which doesn't have the risk of damage from falling ice, and is a much simpler shape thus making it easier to assemble the tile system.

They are all effectively free falling capsules with aerodynamic lift to control the angle of the descent. What kind of advantage can be gained with computing power? Everything important is checked several times from the ground anyway.  Soyuz has a reserve parachute so the possible failure isn't catastrophic. Also, the solid rockets are used to soften the landing, they are not the reason it's violent. Any parachute landing is going the be somewhat violent, especially on land. Dragon 2 will also land on parachutes for the foreseeable future even though powered landing is planned."

Are we going to progress to what we have in Dragon, or catch up?   I expect that with competition, all the spacecraft manufacturers will start developing flight software in more modern ways. and soon all spacecraft will have better software than anything running now. Buggy, proprietary OSs that partly use machine language because processors are so weak, will become things of the past. With large reserves of flash memory, software for many more missions and circumstances will be loaded on each flight, and computers will be able to cope with more on their own.  It is a very hard thing to make software safe, and to know that it is safe. The older OSs require running the entire mission in simulation, finding bugs that are the OS's fault, and rerunning the simulation until everything is perfect.  Small changes in old software still require extensive testing because of lack of confidence in the OS.  Between CRS missions, SpaceX can make over 100 times as many changes in their flight software, because with a reliable modern OS, 1 (or fewer) simulation run(s) validates all of the changes.  I expect eventually spacecraft flight software will become trustworthy in the same sense that airliner flight software is trustworthy. Instead of teams of programmers writing and checking custom software for each flight, the pilot will just plug in the destination, and the computer, holding the memory of all flight plans, will report ""Software ready,"" for almost all missions.

space,3dndde,mahaanus,2,Sat Jul 18 00:14:18 2015 UTC,"A low-cost Europa lander attached to the forthcoming Europa Clipper spacecraft would be very feasible, but it would have to be designed to be short-lived since the Europan surface gets absolutely blasted with radiation that would fry it very quickly.  Building a lander that's radiation-hardened to a degree such that it and its instruments would survive on the surface for an extended time (weeks or months) would likely raise the cost beyond what would be feasible to add to the Clipper mission.  Even as it stands now, the only real shot of getting a lander on the Clipper is if the ESA designs and pays for it.  As for Titan, I absolutely think that's where the next Flasgship mission to the outer solar system should go.  There have been quite a few well-developed and funded proposals for such things as as a blimp that would fly through the atmosphere (and a plane that would do the same!), and two separate proposals for exploring Titan's lakes: one a boat, one a submarine that can surface/drop below the liquid."

I believe terraforming Venus is our best hope."
space,3dqexu,FaceDeer,7,Sat Jul 18 13:53:25 2015 UTC,"A lunar base would need to be buried under a few feet of lunar soil for radiation protection, that would also provide enough thermal insulation and buffering to  eliminate the extreme temperature swings. And all we really know is that zero gravity is bad for humans, we don't know what effect 1/6 gravity has. It might be that any significant amount of gravity is enough to prevent the health problems that come from its lack.  How would eclipses cause damage? It's just a few minutes of darkness in the middle of the day every once in a while, and it only happens on the Lunar nearside anyway.  Terraforming Venus is really, really hard. It'd actually be easier to terraform the Moon, frankly. There was a thread about it recently."

Instead of going up above Venus I think we need to go below. The acid clouds and extreme temperature problems can be solved by venting it through space by slowly breaking down the atmosphere which could take 100s of years.

space,3dqexu,FaceDeer,8,Sun Jul 19 11:42:24 2015 UTC,"The moon is the most likely choice. Mars is slightly nicer in some respects, but none of them are nicer-enough to justify the extra trip length. (Mars has atmosphere, for example, but it's so thin and unbreathable that it might as well be vacuum.  The short distance and short travel time to the moon make that the best choice.  The only big advantage to Mars is that it has a more Earth-like day. It'd probably be hard to grow crops on the Moon, due to the month-long ""day""."
space,3dqexu,Kitworks,5,Sat Jul 18 13:22:09 2015 UTC,"I expect that most lunar agriculture would be done with artificial lighting anyway, rendering the day/night cycle somewhat moot (could still be an issue if you're relying on solar power, of course - you'll need some fancy power storage systems to tide over the night, perhaps).  I generally agree with you that the Moon is a better prospect for initial colonization. If nothing else, it's most useful as a stepping stone to other places - lunar mining and manufacturing operations can put stuff into Earth orbit very quickly and cheaply using electromagnetic catapults or a space elevator (a lunar space elevator can be made with a few thousand tonnes of plain old Kevlar, nothing fancy or extreme required). Mars does have much more readily available volatile elements, though, which is handy for making life support and rocket fuel. That almost-vacuum atmosphere is an essentially endless source of carbon you can collect at will from anywhere. Useful stuff, carbon."
space,3dqexu,Karriz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"Lots of good points. The ease with which you can get on and off the moon is very important. I actually bet we show a preference towards light gravity settings for that reason. (I'm a fan of the rail-gun style cargo launcher myself.)  I wouldn't be surprised if lunar colonies grow some food on a station in lunar orbit, either. Although, if the moon turns out to be the treasure trove of helium 3 maybe they'll just run everything off fusion."
space,3dqexu,FaceDeer,4,Sat Jul 18 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest issues with Moon is energy production. The colony has to survive two weeks without sunlight. So, you either need super-batteries or a nuclear reactor for a long-term colony. On Mars, a large field of solar panels could power the colony.  Both Mars and Moon have toxic dust, so it's going to be an issue. Suit airlocks could solve this, so the dust never gets inside the habitable areas.  Mars has a lot of water, but it's been found at the Moon as well. Both might work in that sense.  Moon's biggest advantage is the shorter travel time, you can travel there inside a small capsule. For Mars flights you need a lot bigger habitat module.  So, both have their problems and it isn't obvious which one should become international focus after the ISS. But I think before we can think about that, we'll need cheaper rockets."
space,3dqexu,peterabbit456,3,Sat Jul 18 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"There's other methods of large-scale power storage than batteries. A nice suggestion I've heard for the Moon is flywheel power storage - a very massive flywheel could be manufactured using Lunar raw materials, and it's easy to keep it magnetically levitated with ready access to a hard vacuum and low gravity.  A colony on one of the Lunar poles could also take advantage of the ""Peaks of Eternal Light"" that remain exposed to the Sun at all times, a couple of solar panels up there would produce continuous power. Would put some constraints on colony location, but the poles are nice for other reasons too (ice mining and such)."
space,3dqexu,peolorat,2,Sat Jul 18 15:21:52 2015 UTC,"The colony has to survive two weeks without sunlight.   Not at the poles.  Near each pole there is a mountain where the peak gets sunlight all the time, from different directions. Your first bank of solar cells just have to be mounted right at the peak, and set up to rotate every 4 weeks to match the direction of the sunlight. The next solar power plant would be built in a ring around the mountain's upper slopes, and each bank of cells would get lit 50% of the time. As the colony grows, you keep setting up new stations in larger rings around the poles, so that each station generates 50% of the time.  BTW, for the South pole, the ice is in the crater right next to the mountain, so your power and your elemental resources are right next to each other."

space,3dqexu,Kitworks,2,Sun Jul 19 10:19:38 2015 UTC,"One thing to think about is the availability of resources, and the quality of those resources. Over Venus you have what you bring with you, like on the ISS, plus whatever is in the atmosphere. So on Venus you have no access to solid materials, unless you can synthesize plastics out of atmospheric gasses.  On the Moon, at the poles, you have access to rock, iron and steel, and various ices. Pure iron and steel are available as pulverized meteor fragments in the Lunar dust, requiring nothing more than a magnet to separate out. Ices provide almost everything needed to sustain life and to make rocket fuel. The only thing in short sully is nitrogen, but if there is frozen ammonia at the poles, even that is available. The Moon is the best choice for a colony in the next 15 years, but only because Mars is so far away. Childbirth on the Moon will probably require mothers to spend months in centrifuges.  Mars has everything needed for life and industry, and the Martian moons are the perfect size and perfectly positioned to support a space faring civilization. Energy requirements for reaching Mars are not much larger than for reaching the Moon, but the big problems are time and distance. A round trip takes ~2 1/2 years, and NASA has little confidence that present life support systems are ready for such a journey. Also, the rockets required to lift all the food and other supplies needed for such a long journey are far greater than the Saturn 5 that took people to the Moon. So, 30 years from now and farther into the future, Mars becomes the best site for a colony, but we still are not ready for such a big step."
space,3dqexu,zilfondel,2,Sat Jul 18 15:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'll start, a disadvantage and problem with colonising venus is that we would be forced to live in ""cloud cities"" and therefore making it incredibly difficult if not impossible to launch a manned rocket off planet because the upward force of the ""sky city"" would have to be greater than a rocket launching off of a planet with near earth gravity, those people that go there would never be able to come back unless we make a new super material that can take the heat and pressure of the Venusian surface and use it to make space suits and rockets.  also living on venus, what would we do about waste management?"

It has come a long way, but  funding specifically for NASA has dramatically declined. If we had maintained the 4%? Of the national budget we would have possibly perfected the ion thrusting engines and would be focused on currently hypothetical warp drive technology for interstellar travel. Every planet/moon in the solar system would be well explored or photographed. It's a shame honestly."
space,3dteiy,xbythunder,11,Sun Jul 19 07:24:10 2015 UTC,"My argument against this idea would be that, past a certain point of development, a civilization becomes basically immune to natural extinction. For example, as soon as a civilization has a self-sustaining off-world colony (perhaps 50 years away, for us), catastrophic climate change or a mega-impact no longer mean instant extinction. Still terrible of course, but survivable.   So what I'm trying say is that as long as a space faring civilization can survive its own infancy (some people would call this one of the ""great filters""), there's no reason it can't potentially last indefinitely. That is why I believe there are almost certainly other advanced civilizations existing concurrently with ours (but we'll likely never meet or communicate with them due to the distances involved)."

space,3dteiy,IodyneZ,6,Sun Jul 19 08:15:01 2015 UTC,"One thing you have to remember is that the universe is BIG. Really big. There are about 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe, each with about 100 billion to 1 trillion stars. The average star has at least one planet. That means the minimum number of planets in the universe is somewhere between 100 sextillion and 1 septillion. That's a lot. That's not even counting smaller potentially habitable objects like moons.  So let's say there are 100 sextillion planets. Then let's say that 1% of them are habitable. Based on the fact that there are two planets in our solar system alone that could have been habitable at some point (Earth and Mars) and the fact that there are several potentially habitable moons around Jupiter and Saturn, this could easily be an underestimate.  That's a lot of planets with life. Based on the fact that life appeared almost immediately after Earth cooled enough for liquid water to exist, it's likely that microbial life is pretty common. Multi-cellular life is a different story. It took about 2-3 billion years to appear, which means it takes quite a while for life to advance to this point, but it isn't out of the question. Even if this knocks off 99% of habitable planets, that still leaves 10 quintillion planets with complex life, a million in our galaxy.  Of course, it's unlikely that intelligent life is necessarily an evolutionary goal. A big brain and the ability to produce language are both pretty specific things that don't pop up often in evolution. Big brains require a lot of energy, and language requires complex social structures (also requiring a big brain). Big brains are really only possible if they help to generate enough energy to run it.  Now sure, many planets may lack resources necessary to civilization. You likely need a good supply of oxygen to help smelt metal and cook food. Of course, if even 1% of planets have atmospheric oxygen, that still leaves 10,000 in our galaxy alone.  Perhaps civilization is rare, but the universe has sheer numbers on it's side. Maybe there are plenty of other variables to take into account, but it's extremely unlikely that we are completely alone. Of course, it's hard to say with the information we have now. We could certainly be too far away from other civilizations to communicate, be misinterpreting their signals, or be looking for the wrong signs entirely."

space,3dnrdy,BigDaddyDeck,17,Fri Jul 17 20:39:31 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for posting this! This is a really cool concept for getting away from chemical propulsion, and I definitely have a lot of questions.   How would you plan on tackling line of sight issues related to targeting the craft as well as targeting the craft for deorbit maneuvers. If you guys could expand on the way you use helium and eventually hydrogen as the reaction mass that would be great, thrust and such, and the mechanisms for that. What order of magnitude are we talking about for energy consumption by the ground emmiters, and how long would the ""burn"" last for. This seems like a lot of energy and I'm curious how you planned on tackling having all that energy available at once. On one of the videos on your website you talked a little about safety concerns but did not really elaborate on the methods you intend to solve the safety concerns, could you talk about where the major safety concerns are how to solve them. Could you talk about what you see as the hard limits for energy beaming technology in the next decade and what you guys think you will need from that technology in order for this project to suceed?"
space,3dnrdy,Rycross,5,Fri Jul 17 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I'll get straight to the answers:   1) Line of sight(LOS) is definitely an issue, but one that we are aware of and have designed for in our path to orbit. The gimballed gyrotrons can track the spaceplane up to a certain angle, but after that won't have any ability to beam power. But, as long as we can get to orbit within the tracking range of the gyrotrons before losing LOS, we can simply wait for the ship to orbit around and come back within beam range in order to deorbit. While the ship is out of LOS, we can rely on cold gas for small maneuvers and don't need the array.       2) We used helium in the test because hydrogen is frickin' dangerous! Igniting hydrogen would be a bummer because we have a lot of lab equipment and rocket scientists who don't react well to large explosions (see Hindenberg), so until we have a safe place we can test with hydrogen, helium's a good alternative. Dong's response is pretty spot on with why we want to use hydrogen, but I'll make one correction and say that we don't intend to ""explode"" hydrogen, just heating it up and shooting it out the back will give us all the momentum we need.     3) The ground emitters will be using about 800 megawatts (MW) total between two arrays, the takeoff array for launch and the booster array to get it up to speed and into orbit. The ""burn"" time is about 300 seconds. In order to be able to power everything through this process, we've invented and patented a pretty cool means of energy storage, allowing us to charge up from grid power at a lot less than 800 MW, but build up a reservoir that we can then discharge to power the ground emitters during launch.     4) For safety, I mentioned hydrogen above, that's probably the big one. Other stuff includes shielding the payload bay and not irradiating any poor little birds that could fly in the beam path. These are fairly easy problems to solve: shielding technology is absolutely up to scratch to handle any extra energy that could hit anything sensitive, and we can detect birds and shut the emitters off until they clear without endangering the mission.     5) Honestly, the technology is already advanced enough to do what we need. The microwave emitters are quite specialized and take some specific equipment and expertise to put together, but the only hurdle is making them as efficient as possible to save costs. LOS is definitely an issue, but also overly moist environments, since all the water vapor would absorb the energy before it got to our ship (which is why we plan to launch in very dry environments). Lastly, I would say that it is a fine line between using this technology for peaceful vs. hostile purposes, so we have to work very hard internally and with regulatory bodies to ensure its proper use.     Hope I answered all your questions and you enjoyed this wall of text!  edited: formatting"
space,3dnrdy,DONG_WIZARD_5000,3,Sat Jul 18 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"The article states that you guys observed 500 Isp and believe that you can break 600 Isp, but doesn't mention thrust.  My understanding is that thermal rockets typically have low thrust and are only usable once you're in orbit, but you guys are talking SSTO so presumably this design would have much higher thrust.  What kind of numbers have been observed and what is expected as you scale up the engine?"
space,3dnrdy,ThesaurusRex84,3,Sat Jul 18 22:57:49 2015 UTC,"So far, our tests have been low thrust and small scale since we have been focusing specifically on Isp measurement. That will continue through the next test, as we will be able to use hydrogen for our Isp measurements and get some direct efficiency data. IIRC, the best thermal rocket tests had a thrust to weight ratio below half that of chemical rockets, but those were using nuclear energy that requires a lot of weight for containment systems. Our system will use light, high temperature ceramic composites that double as the heat exchanger, which will save drastically on weight. I can tell you that we are designing for 7g max acceleration, though I can't give any vehicle mass estimates just yet. Either way, stay tuned and hopefully we'll have some hard numbers for you soon!"
space,3dnrdy,profossi,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"I'll take stab at the few I know the answer to  2) The reason why hydrogen is the fuel of choice is because, when you explode hydrogen and channel that energy in one direction, its' small mass (smallest element in the periodic table) allows high amounts of kinetic energy to be gained on a by-mass basis. Kinetic Energy = Mass * Velocity 2. Maximizing velocity over mass yields more kinetic energy versus doing the opposite, hence why their computer model showed a higher efficiency for hydrogen than for helium.  5) Hard limit would be line-of-sight beaming and distances between objects, like you mentioned in 1). For instance, even using this system to maneuver around the moon would be troublesome without the lack of already existing orbital microwave generators/transmitters. And don't even think about going interplanetary with this type of system unless you could guarantee reasonable uptime and efficiency over vast distances."
space,3dnrdy,wooq,2,Sat Jul 18 15:05:37 2015 UTC,"Helium can't explode, though. It can't really do much of anything at all. How do they use it as propellant?"
space,3dnrdy,ThesaurusRex84,5,Sat Jul 18 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"Hydrogen can't explode either without an oxidizer. They track the rocket with a really powerful microwave beam. A large microwave absorbing plate on the bottom side gets really hot. The plate has channels for cold, high pressure propellant to flow through and heat up, and the heated gas is then expelled through a convergent-divergent nozzle which converts the heat and pressure into kinetic energy. This is different from a traditional rocket where the heat is produced by combustion."
space,3dnrdy,wooq,2,Sat Jul 18 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"With ""explosions"" ... i.e. burning fuel with oxidizer... heat energy is added via a chemical reaction.  In the case of helium or hydrogen thermal rockets, that energy is added, as /u/profossi said, by heating the gas itself through some other external means, in this case a microwave beam pointed at a thermal plate.  To put it another way, rockets ""go"" by squirting mass out the back.  Newton's 3rd law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  Increasing the energy of the mass which is being squirted increases the energy imparted by that mass upon the rocket."
space,3dnrdy,a_Hwhale_Biologist,2,Sun Jul 19 03:00:53 2015 UTC,"The reason I asked is that helium is a noble gas. It can't react with anything. At all. Hence, no combustion propellant.  If the thing is just a giant squirt gun, that's another thing. How efficient is that compared to burning the hydrogen?"
space,3dnrdy,a_Hwhale_Biologist,3,Sun Jul 19 04:33:36 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter that it's a noble gas, all that matters is the exhaust velocity.  It's not combusting (how a chemical rocket increases exhaust velocity), it's already very energetic without combustion.   How efficient is that compared to burning the hydrogen?   A Merlin 1D, the engine used on the SpaceX rockets, has a specific impulse of 310s (340s in vacuum) (though it also has an insane thrust-to-weight ratio).  An Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25 (AKA SSME, Space Shuttle Main Engine) has a specific impulse of 366s (452s in vacuum).  The upper stage rocket of the Delta IV, the Rocketdyne RL-10B-2: 462s (in vacuum).  The efficiency of the Escape Dynamics test engine would ostensibly be competitive with extant chemical engines."

RF thermal rocket perhaps. also what kind of thrust are you hoping to achieve on the suborbital scale-up?"
space,3dnrdy,DONG_WIZARD_5000,3,Sun Jul 19 04:47:23 2015 UTC,"I would say ""microwave thermal rocket"" or ""externally powered launch vehicle"" are probably good descriptors. The FAA uses the term thermal rocket in relation to nuclear propulsion, so while they may recognize us as an RF or microwave thermal rocket, we could also be classified as a thermoelectric rocket or a ""resistojet,"" which is kind of a fun word.  Our next test will be similar to this one since we will have the capability to test with hydrogen, so specific impulse will be the driving factor rather than thrust. I can say, however, that we need a max acceleration of 7g to reach our designed orbit. Down the road (when I'm able to tell you more about our mass budget) I can tell you exactly what kind of thrust we're hoping for!"

Could this method be used to eventually overcome, or lead to similar tech that will, these issues and not reach light speed but travel faster than we could have previously using standard chemical propulsion?"

space,3dnrdy,Karriz,2,Sat Jul 18 18:27:50 2015 UTC,"Great concept, and thanks for responding to us on reddit!    I'd like to ask a couple technical questions to satisfy my curiosity: Would it be possible/worthwhile to generate electrical power from the beam with a rectifying antenna and replace the propellant turbopump with an electrically powered pump? Could it even be possible to get rid of the microwave absorbing heat exchanger entirely and heat the propellant with an electric arc, thus permitting a higher pre-nozzle temperature (as it is not limited by the heat exchanger materials) and thus higher ISP at the cost of a greater power requirement? Wikipedia claims that rectennas can already reach a 85-90% efficiency in converting microwaves to DC power, and any waste heat produced could be used to preheat the propellant."
space,3dnrdy,thelazyreader2015,3,Sat Jul 18 23:18:33 2015 UTC,"Great questions! While it hasn't gotten the same media treatment as our Isp test, we actually do a lot of research into rectennas and tracking/power beaming. Here is a video of us testing our tracking and beaming microwaves to a LED board (0:44) on a UAV that yours truly is trying not to crash.  As far as using a rectenna to power the propellant pump, the technology is certainly there, but we run into issues with the power density we need for our thermal rocket (or theoretically with the arcjet you suggest) being incompatible with a rectenna system. Even with a 90% efficient rectenna, the waste heat generated at those power levels can quickly endanger its temperature sensitive electronics. We can use cryo hydrogen to cool the system to combat this, but we risk freezing everything in the process. So it is possible, but its a balancing act that's going to need a lot more due diligence from us to characterize the problem and seek a solution as our engine development continues.  With regard to using an arcjet, I believe the biggest barrier is the thrust to weight ratio. Thermal rockets are capable of much higher thrust relative to their weight than arcjets, and in our case, using advanced composites for engine components will further increase that ratio. In my understanding, arcjets make great 2nd stage and maneuvering thrusters, but are simply too heavy for a feasible SSTO application. Another downside is that an arc thruster would lack the thermal mass of an absorptive heat exchanger, such that an interruption of power would result in a more immediate loss of thrust, whereas having reserve heat with the absorptive heat exchanger gives us some wiggle room."

space,3dnrdy,Pimozv,5,Sat Jul 18 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"Thermal rockets are not a new concept.   It's not the same as an ion thruster, which works by accelerating the propellant with electrical force.

space,3dnrdy,Gsonderling,3,Sat Jul 18 12:40:53 2015 UTC,"It is true that chemical rockets win out when it comes to raw power, and the effectiveness of the microwave emitters on the ground is inversely proportional to the distance they have to beam.

In order to go from 31,000 MPH to 0MPH we need the ability for the thrusters to fire in the opposite direction at the same speed to cause deceleration. Because we can't just stop the craft flat. Momentum is carrying it. Cutting off the engine would just cause it to float. It has to receive a force opposite of the direction it's momentum is leading to in order to come to stop and land safely on the planet.   Otherwise it'd just hurdle into it and blow up.

Essentially, they added the velocity the Earth was traveling away from the sun during launch. It's like being on a train traveling 300 mph. On the train you decide to jog down the center aisle at 6 mph. When you get off the train you brag to everyone how you were capable of running at 306 mph. It just depends on what everything is relative too. Relative to the train, you are running 6 mph. Relative to the ground you are traveling at 306 mph. Relative to the Celestial Horizon you are traveling at 1009 mph. You're heliocentric speed of you running 6 mph on that train puts your maximum velocity at of 67609 mph.   Reference points are key to understanding velocities in space. The author even makes a note of that and uses it to argue for a heliocentric velocity when discussing space travel. However, Heliocentric only works for close stellar neighbors and our own system. The same argument could be used for a galactocentric velocity.

Of course you add in other factors like it has to match plutos orbit around the sun which is 10,000 miles per hour versus the 100,000 miles per hour New Horizons was traveling.  And if you combine the fact that these probes have to take paths like this, slingshotting around other bodies just to get up to speed, it's virtually impossible for them to slow down in time with current technology. That comet is going around 35,000 miles per hour and is much, much closer than Pluto."

The only real limitation is that it only uses limited one body physics(you and the body you're orbiting, and you have no gravity) rather than n body physics(everything is calculated together). This means that orbits aren't totally realistic and there are no Lagrange points."

Before I played Kerbal my reasoning was ""Traveling the pluto with a lander? You just need more gas to get there, and you can just drop off a lander when you fly past it"". But now my train of thought is more like ""Ah, landing on pluto? Well you're going to probably be on a solar escape trajectory as you fly past it, so if you want to put something in it's orbit you'll need a burn enough delta V to kill most of your velocity, especially since you don't have at atmosphere to slow you, not to mention it has a tiny gravity well so your math has to be really on point and... yeah, screw that, let's do something else.""

The problem is, such an alignment may not occur for a very long time. It wouldn't help us much if we could only do it in 1000 years from now.  Edit: My estimates may be way off, but I think the main point is valid - with a favorable alignment in theory it's possible to achieve orbit."

In this case rosettes speed relative to the comet was fairly low so dropping philae onto its surface didn't require retro rocketing once rosetta had positioned its orbit.  Compare this new horizons which was effectively flying straight towards Pluto at 14 km/s. You have to kill that speed somehow so you need a rocket to stop it which means you need an even bigger rocket at launch. There may be some possibility to use the atmosphere to brake but we didn't know enough about the topography or atmosphere of Pluto at launch.  Edit: spelling

When Rosetta met up with its target it was going a similar speed to it, so it took very little propulsive effort to enter orbit. New Horizons swung by Pluto at nearly 14 km/s (0.005% the speed of light), which would require enormous amounts of thrust to slow down from.  Potentially it would be possible to do an orbiter mission of Pluto (or Neptune or a KBO) using advanced propulsive technology like ion engines or plasma thrusters but there are still several technical hurdles to doing so and such a mission would be quite expensive."

Pluto is going quite a decent speed, New Horizons is the fastest launch vehicle ever, and just looses in being the fastest probe ever to Voyager, who got a bigger boost from Jupiter. Yet, even with all that the best we could do was a fly-by.  Rosetta is way less impressive in terms of speed, so it had to be smart. Getting speed boosts first from Earth two times, then from Mars and then from Earth again just so it would be able to intercept the comet.  Now, in theory, I'd imagine that it's possible if the planets are all in the right place at the right time, and some incredible complex flight-plan.  But even that poses a problem, it took almost 10 years for new horizon to get there, and it went as close to a straight line to it's target as you can get in space. That crazy complicated flight plan from before will extend that duration significantly.

But not because it's ""powerful enough""  The EmDrive is an engine that is (supposed to be) capable of producing a minute amount of thrust with nothing but electricity. This means that it's not an engine that will get you anywhere fast.  But, it will allow you to accelerate continously over very long periods of time. And that little bit of thrust makes a huge difference when we're talking about the distances in space. It might be a bit ""meh"" to go to Mars when it's closest to Earth. But otherwise it's a huge difference.  Sure, it'll still be a challenge to go to Pluto because of it's elliptical orbit and the debris that may or may not be around depending on where it is in it's orbit. But the ""free"" thrust of an EmDrive would be in the category of ""magic bullet"" that will not open just open up the solar system, but much more."

I wonder what relationships these kinds of mountains have in correlation with plate tectonics( if there is any) and erosion.   The conclusion from the fact the mountains are water ice instead of nitrogen ice was that Pluto's volatile layer must be a thin veneer of snow. Seeing as a layer this thin would have evaporated away billions of years ago, very recent activity must be replenishing it- maybe something like Triton's geysers. So from the mountains we can infer that Pluto is still active, but not in the way you'd expect.  The shape of the mountains is really weird.

It sounds for me as the only logical step, probably it will take some fifty or hundred years to heave a reasonable colony/base outside the Earth, but we gain a lot of knowledge in that time on how to do interplanetary travel. Then somewhere in the 22nd century I guess we have gained so much knowledge and done some discoveries to really start travelling outside our solar system. It has to be and will be.

The video itself is legit, but the annotations someone stuck on the video and that web page are some conspiracy theory trolling BS. Let me break it down for you:  -The Apollo missions to the moon traveled through the Van Allen belts, an area of space around the earth where there's a lot of radiation. (It's higher up than low earth orbit, where the International Space Station hangs out.) Their course took them around the most intense areas, but they did still have to go through some radiation. I don't think any of the unmanned Apollo test flights measured radiation, but the engineers had a pretty good idea what to expect, so they just went for it. The astronauts were exposed to some radiation, which was measured, and found not to be over the yearly recommended exposure for radiation.  -The NASA video about the Orion describes how they're going to test the Orion in several ways, including flying it through the Van Allen belts to see how much radiation it receives. Even though we know how much radiation the Apollo astronauts got, this is a sensible test to do with a new spacecraft design. Orion is larger than Apollo, has more crew, and is designed for longer missions... it's not simply Apollo, repeated.  -The conspiracy theorist thinks that the fact NASA is testing this somehow means that they must have faked the moon landing, because they would have already had experience with Apollo passing through the Van Allen belts. It's totally a troll. It's like saying Ford doesn't need to crash test their 2015 minivan because they already built a Model T... and then saying, ""Well if you're going to crash test this minivan here in 2015, you must never have built that Model T!"""
space,3djcb1,pipeCrow,2,Fri Jul 17 11:26:41 2015 UTC,"Worth noting that we pretty much know how much radiation is out there, its distribution, etc.  The Orion test was specifically to see how its systems reacted to passing through this zone.

But unfortunately Russia could no longer supply their lighthouses and sell to us so we ran out. We also had the problem that a lot of our plutonium was starting to deplete and lose efficiency.

We then mix the new pu238 with old at a 1(n):2(o) ratio to revive it giving us a total rtg fuel production of 4.5 kg a year.

So let's examine how realistic their first stated goal is: launch of a Mars Transfer Vehicle (apparently for supplies/base building) in 2020. The stated plan is for two launches to LEO, both in the 30-40 ton category.  Mars 2020, NASA's rover to launch in the same timeframe, is undergoing development right now, and will cost in the realm of $2 Billion. It is highly based on the Curiosity rover, so let's assume it has a similar weight of around 1 ton, and required only a single launch. It's important to note, at this point, that science instruments only cost a few hundred million dollars of the program's budget. Most of the costs are engineering, facilities, employees, maintenance, operations, etc.  So, if they intend to be amazingly more efficient than NASA at getting payloads to Mars (something no other government, let alone commercial entity, has successfully completed at any major scale), they may be able to pull off the operation of that first vehicle for a cost under $1 Billion, if they start work immediately and have no major budget or engineering issues.  How do they plan to raise $200-300 million dollars this year, and hire a team of engineers? How will they manage their production chain, their supplier management, and their production? Do they have facilities and operational budgets for handling the receiving, qualification, and verification of hardware that they will need to begin testing in only three years? And grow that funding to $500-700 million a year, at a minimum, when they start operations and preparations for Mars landings? And continue that cash stream every year for the next few decades? And will they have any experience, whatsoever, with deep space mission operations and execution before landing people on a planet a few dozen million miles away?  Space isn't cheap. Good, safe, reliable engineering isn't cheap. And SpaceX isn't a magical fairy that reduces the cost of all commercial space activities by an order of magnitude just by offering somewhat cheaper launch services. Anyone promoting a plan to reach Mars that doesn't show an entire mission architecture, a reliable method of transporting hundreds of tons of equipment to the Martian surface, and have the cash flow to design, test, build, deliver, and operate that equipment, is not serious."

The discussion of the Europa Clipper fails to state that this mission is a rescoped version of the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO),17 also recommended in the 2011 decadal survey. The survey committee found that JEO was scientifically compelling but recommended that if pursued it would have to be descoped because its estimated cost was incompatible with prevailing budgetary expectations.

The people working on the next-gen space telescope are aware of this:   We have produced a road map of the key technology developments required to enable ATLAST. Two of the concepts, the 8m monolithic mirror telescope and the 16.8m segmented mirror telescope, span the range of UVOIR observatories that are enabled by NASA's proposed space launch system (SLS) vehicle. The 8m ATLAST offers the inherent advantages of a monolithic aperture telescope in terms of high-contrast imaging and superb wavefront control. The 16m ATLAST represents a pathway to truly large apertures in space and uses the largest extrapolation of a JWST-like chord-fold primary mirror packaging. However, the ATLAST mission is not solely dependent on Ares V.

SLS being used for a probe offers an opportunity to do something soooooo much more important than deal with some slight impatience.

What do you think they could have done to squeeze more flybys out of that mission? By the time Galileo was flown into Jupiter it was running out of fuel, the cameras had been destroyed by radiation and the digital tape recorder was at the end of its life.

space,3dm7nt,zerbey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"The Oort cloud starts at about 2,000 AU and stretches to around 50-100,000 AU (estimates vary) so it's absolutely enormous in size.  Voyager will make it there but will not be returning data by that time as we only have 10 years of power left.    Whilst I personally believe that there are other civilisations in the galaxy, we sadly have no evidence of that fact.  The chances of us finding a Voyager size probe sent in the direction of our solar system are slim to none unless it is somehow broadcasting a signal in our direction.  Voyager is absolutely tiny - far smaller than most asteroids - and we're not even close to cataloging all of them yet."

Also, the time it would take for the probe to get to Andromeda travelling at around 30,000mph would be absurd. I'm too lazy to work out the math since Andromeda is moving towards us at around 670,000mph but it would still take millions and millions of years."

New Horizons is travelling something like 23 km/s; the nearest star is 4.25 lightyears (that's like 40200000000000 km) from Earth.  So if NH went straight to the nearest neighboring star (which it isn't), it would still take like 55000 years to get there.  The spacecraft's power will not sustain it that long.  For reference, the nearest (foreign) galaxy is like 25000 lightyears from ours (~5800x farther than the nearest star).

The fact is that the vast majority of off-Earth colonization will be in constructed habitats, either in space or in the atmospheres of planets. Venus is a big fat target for colonization and training for future space travel, and few people recognize it."
space,3dmnme,HydroCabron,9,Fri Jul 17 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"Because the surface of venus is hell. Anything we landed on the fucking thing melted shortly after it landed. You don't think that we would melt on it too? Mars is very cold, yes, but not enough to freeze a Lander, And artificial heating is so much easier to do than artificial cooling is. Which is why mars is such a big target for us, its to land a person on something that is far away, but possible."

Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.   Enter the atmosphere at interplanetary speeds with a lifting body, go as deep as necessary into the atmosphere, jettison the heatshield and open a giant balloon, float to preferred pressure and temperature. Repeat until you have a city of such zepplin habitats.  Like all colonization, probably not all that practical, but not hard either."

I believe that leak repairs could be postponed for days.  If necessary, hydrogen balloons could be attached for stability. Hydrogen is not an explosion concern in Venus' atmosphere, since there is not nearly enough oxygen for it to combust.  No radiation shielding necessary; little thermal insulation necessary; heating and cooling are less energy-intensive than on Mars; water can be had from the atmosphere - this requires some chemistry. The sulfuric acid rains would require that the outer shell be built of material that is indifferent to it.  In contrast, Mars requires pressurised habitats (a lot more launch weight) with powerful heaters. Radiation protection requires that the station be built underground, or wrapped in heavy shielding - neither of these options is cheap. Bone loss issues at 0.38G mean that some sort of carousel be installed, and they're massive."

A few days seems nice, but you also have to get that extra earth air back to Venus.  And that's for a small, sustained leak - what about some sort of catarstrophic one? My main issue would be that any sort of leak would be catastrophic.  And there's no chance of escaping via a pod of some sort - you aren't on a stable platform for launch, so you're stuck with needing to go back to the surface to have any chance of escape, where all the surface issues would make it nearly impossible.    Not trying to just play devils advocate, but I think the  'pyschological' aversion to an air base isn't just solely based on what we're comfortable with - there are a huge amount of issues with it.  Not that Mars is particularly better, I think they're both poor options - but while the costs may be higher for a Mars base, our background into actually building it successfully is much, much stronger than it would be for a Venus air base."

Slowly. I think the most likely way our descendants might spread across the galaxy would be by building colonies around the nearby stars (say, within 10 or 20 light years), then eventually when a large enough civilization exists around each of those stars they build ships to colonize the stars close to them, and so on. Eventually the entire galaxy would be inhabited, and no one ship would need to travel more than a few tens of light years.

space,3do5ko,CATTROLL,2,Fri Jul 17 23:28:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think human expansion into deep space will have any historical parallels. A lot of people like to cite European style colonial projects are rough analogues for interstellar colonization, but it's fundamentally different. Whatever resources Earth needs Earth could certainly get for much cheaper and easier in its own neighborhood than in an extrasolar system. Sure, there might be a small niche luxury 'alien' artifact market (Wow, this gold nugget came from 25 ly over!, etc), but it wouldn't be enough to drive commerce between star systems.  First, the human race would need to overcome its current divisions and issues on Earth. To mount an interstellar colonization operation, it would take mind boggling resources, probably more than the current GDP of the Earth for one such expedition alone. If a global war or ecological collapse happens first, people will be fighting for scraps rather than trying to expand into the galaxy. This part alone is going to take a while.  Sure, medieval Europe managed to cobble a few caravels together during its prolonged crisis (when wasn't Europe in crisis?) and kick off its empire building days, but those caravels were a tiny tiny fraction of the GDP of any given colonial state. The energies involved in just putting the infrastructure in place just to even begin thinking about building a realistic interstellar version of a caravel ensures that, apples to apples, it'll be a lot more expensive (not to mention technologically challenging).  So, clearly, sociopolitical unity and a stable environment at home would be a prerequisite for interstellar flight. Let's say that's a given, Earth has united, the population and ecology is stable, what would motivate the human race outward? Home is perfect now! So clearly, there wouldn't be a 'push' factor comparable to what happened in Europe (better economic chances in the New World, less chance of violent death, etc), so what would motivate people to root and stem make such a dangerous journey?  Well, 'exploration!' you might say. Yes, exploration might convince a few scientists to jump on a relativistic rocket or two for an extended trip, but lets be frank, it's highly unlikely they're going to put roots down wherever they may visit, even if greeted by knowledgeable locals with gifts of food (again, another historical parallel unlikely to happen). Even our own biology is stacked against us in this respect- our rate of aging makes interstellar voyages (within the current known parameters of physics) socially unacceptable for all but the shortest voyages into the universe. Of course, I'm just assuming that the current state of mankind right now is how it will always be, and history has fortunately been unkind to conservative forecasters (it would be fantastic if we cure aging and find out a way to travel faster than light). Until such time, I'm going to spitball assuming these limitations will remain in place.  Although humanity's best bet to have any sort of impact in the far flung corners of the universe would be by sending out machines instead of delicate fleshbags such as ourselves, lets be frank, this isn't the future that kids growing up watching Star Trek wanted. Humans need a lot of infrastructure in order to stay alive- infrastructure means a lot of mass. I'd imagine one of these babies would be a great place to practice how to sustain human life en masse outside of our atmosphere and away from any traditional gravity well (again, barring any unprecedented breakthroughs). However, even the largest currently feasible O'Neill Cylinder would be too small for a generation ship style project. It would be approx 248 sq. miles per tube, so a total of 496 sq miles (remembering there are two tubes) assuming we build the thing out of steel, so roughly a habitable surface area the size of Los Angeles proper. Sounds great, right? Well, lets assume that every one of these colonists has an ecological impact comparable to that of a Japanese person. It's a nation with a reasonable HDI, a model for efficiency worldwide. Welp, at 4 hectares per person, that leaves us at  (after a bit of math) enough room for 32,115 people.This is assuming that our colonists would be foolhardy and NOT leave one of their tubes uninhabited as a backup, should something fail catastrophically in their current habitat. Heck, lets be optimistic and say that in the future, technological advances would allow for a Japanese level of lifestyle at 1/10th the impact (remember, they're probably not going to be burning fossil fuels, not building homes with wood, using aeroponics for agriculture, etc etc), that would still only yield a population of 320k people, about the size of the City of St. Louis, Missouri. While, big, certainly above the minimum viable genetic population for a human colony, would people really be happy in such a confined space- forever?  I'd say, go big or go home. The O'Neill cylinders would be a great start to learn about how to live in space, but why send people to other worlds, when you can send other worlds with people? What do I mean? Well, a variation of the O'Neill cylinder is the McKendree Cylinder, which utilizing (speculative, but what isn't in this post?) carbon nanotube technology, would yield millions of square miles of habitable space, according to the above linked article, an area roughly the size of Russia. You could probably orbit the thing around the sun for decades, establish an Earth like ecology in the thing, and stock it with millions of people before sending the thing to its destination. How such a behemoth would be powered (both for propulsion and life support), I do not know. I think people would be OK with leaving the Earth, if they took a mini-Earth with them, and since the tube would be home, whatever star they are around would be of little consequence. This has the fun side effect of vastly expanding the portion of the universe humans would consider habitable as well. Even at a slow rate of duplication, if these habitats ever decide to build more copies of themselves, I'd think you would see the emergence of a truly interstellar civilization, and thus, demand for more rapid interstellar travel. Remember, although the world was colonized by foot (indigenous peoples) and later by wind powered ship, millions now zip around by jetliner."

Also, sea creatures don't really need hands, as they don't need to hold anything up, so it's likely we wouldn't feel the need to develop anything.  Our first phase of 'space' exploration would have been building a ship to explore the dry earth surface, and then develop technology from there. Although, evolution says that this step, going from the oceans to dry land is how we came to be, if we developed from bacteria that is. We went from one atomospheric density to another. The next step in evolution is to exist in space.  So ultimately, my conclusion is that water was not a sufficient place to have started developing the idea for space travel."

The water they live in alone, depending on their size could weigh twice that of their physical body weight to provide for enough oxygen to breath as well as keep them wet.  Aeronautics = fireworks? Rockets and airplanes are pretty much one in the same as they are derived from the same sorts of research. The only difference with rockets is that they require much smaller stabilizing extremities.   As most science starts with inductive reasoning, multiple intuitions culminating into one deduction resulting in experimentation that results in 'this is the way this is.' How could they have ever done all of this without first realizing they needed to establish life on the dry surface first?

Or shaped like a fish: dolphin? manatee? Or maybe not human-like at all, like an octopus? lobster?  It is true that aerodynamics are important when a rocket is launched on Earth because the rocket has to go through atmosphere. But with rockets the atmosphere is an obstacle to overcome, while the atmosphere is needed by airplanes.  It would probably be harder for aquatics to develop a space program, but it depends on circumstances. The main problem is just how they how they develop their science and why. It is not like humans were always at the top.  Dinosaurs had a good run, but things changed and they 'became' birds, which are great, but do not have a space program. Octopuses can be pretty smart and have lots of dexterity. Maybe they could evolve and develop science if the humans wiped themselves out."

Another was named Santorini because it had a hole in it.  Later, the IAU made ""islands on Earth"" the naming scheme for these bright features, also known as faculae.

First I assume the ISS is refueled on an irregular basis, and you can't make a burn without gas, and you can't waste gas bringing up fuel you don't need, so some burns might just need to be done prior to a scheduled fuel visit, and some burns might be overdue if the fuel is late. The other thing is that I would assume the weight of the ISS varies significantly as experiments and materials come on and off, and you would want to make burns when the ISS is as light as possible.

I know that laser beams were proposed as a form of space propulsion, as photons has some amount of momentum. I didn't check the numbers, but I believe that applying a laser beam for a couple of minutes on these usually small objects would deflect it in a minor angle that over the right distance would guarantee it will pass within a safe distance from the ISS.  As expensive as it might be, it would sure cost less than rebuilding the ISS after being pierced by a ping-pong ball sized object."

I'm not an astrophysicist (engineer instead), so I'm not too clued up in this sort of thing.  Is it just cause they don't have a powerful enough computer onboard to make the calculation, or cause they don't know enough about the object (and can't make the necessary observations?)."
space,3dhu7r,hiu28,17,Thu Jul 16 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"The Air Force monitors object in space and issues notices to involved parties when they predict two spacecraft getting too close for comfort. Usually there's a week or two advance notice of these event and mission planners can adjust their orbits as necessary to avoid a collision. As a safety precaution, astronauts will be ordered to transition the ISS into a contingency state and evacuate to a Soyuz for quick escape in case of a collision. The orbits of the two spacecraft have some amount of uncertainty so as a risk management strategy these steps are taken when a threshold level of risk is present, which was the case this time around. The ISS has a pretty big ""keep out"" box (a couple kilometers in every direction is the best I can recall but I know it's longer along one of the axes).  Edit: Space objects are tracked using ground-based radar, so these objects are already hundreds of miles away as they're being tracked, if not more.

Even a small flake of paint chipped away from the debris could puncture a space suit at several kilometers per second.

The LHC exists solely to slam particles together and observe. The thought that the LHC is dangerous is due to people who feel as if one of these collisions could cause some kind of celestial catastrophe; like a singularity or, as Stephen hawking recently hypothesised, a large enough LHC would be able to put so much energy into the collision that it would essentially cause vacuum decay which would in essence cause space and time to collapse. That hypothetical machine would have to be bigger than the earth to achieve that though.   A black hole is defined in laymen's as matter being packed so densely that it forms an event horizon, and in the LHC, the strong forces between the colliding particles will never allow them to reach a density to produce a black hole, of any size or magnitude. It's strictly to learn and observe."

space,3dnb4z,jgoodwin27,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"Resolution is only one of many factors that go into a camera. The other major part is your optics and what sort of lenses you have on there.   Other major factors are weight and speed. You have to remember that during the flyby this thing was moving 13.78 km/s or 30,600mph. That means you have to take a picture while going that fast without any blur or shaking. Most iPhone cameras I have used tend to blur when my arm shakes a little bit too much.   Also there isn't much light out there so your imagers have to work a little bit differently. Remember space is not earth. And contrary to what consumer camera makers want you to think, resolution isn't everything, it just happens to be the cheapest stat for them to boost and therefore advertise to you that it is the most important."

Anyway, how is resolution not a big factor in picture quality? You said the optics and lenses play a major role, but would you care to delve into a little more detail? Also, in what ways does the lack of light affect the quality/process?"
space,3dnb4z,supermats,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"Typically higher resolution photos mean you need to be more stable, since you need to catch a lot more detail. So if it is higher resolution at those speeds will cause blur a little bit more. Most of the high resolution images are either 1. stictched together from many smaller images or 2. were on a tripod and then light levels adjusted very carefully  Resolution is a big factor, but not as big as most people think. Usually that is the only stat people look at in a picture. But the quality of your imaging chip is also important, such as contrast ratios, amount of light it takes to take a picture, ect.  So I'm not a photographer so I only know offhand information, my roommmate does photography and would know a lot more so I could be a little bit off in my explanations.  As for optics the imagers can only record what they see, if you don't have a lense you're going to get a crappy photo, but if you have a $15,000 lense in front of your camera it is going to be able to use the light it recieves a lot more effectively.   In all honosty most of it is beyond my scope of knowlege, but it is things I have heard or been explained before by others so couldn't give you too much more detail then the basics."
space,3dm1r1,landsharkxx,14,Fri Jul 17 10:51:02 2015 UTC,"Velocity/speed in space doesn't mean anything unless you say relative to what you're measuring it, and how far you are from a source of gravity.  Apollo 10's speed was about 11 km/s relative to the Earth as it left Earth, while New Horizons' speed was about 16.5 km/s at that same point.    However, that relatively small difference in speed makes a big difference in what would happen later.  Earth's escape velocity is 11 km/s, so Apollo 10 would have barely escaped the Earth (if it didn't stop at the Moon), and would have orbited the Sun at about 30 km/s relative to the Sun (the same as Earth's orbital velocity).  It wouldn't have enough energy to get very far from Earth's orbit around the Sun (not even as far as Mars).  New Horizons, however, had a higher orbital energy and left the Earth still going about 12 km/s relative to it when past the Moon's orbit.  Since Earth is moving 30 km/s relative to the Sun, New Horizons' speed relative to the Sun was about 42 km/s (30+12).  This high speed relative to the Sun allowed it to travel much further out than Earth's orbit.  While the Sun's gravity kept slowing it down as it moved outwards, it still had about 17 km/s relative to the Sun right before it passed by Jupiter.  Jupiter gave it an extra kick up to about 21 km/s (relative to the Sun).  As it got farther into the solar system, it still slowed down, but not by as much, since the Sun's gravity was weaker and weaker.  When it passed by Pluto it was still traveling at about 14 km/s relative to the Sun.  So really the amount of time it takes to get to Pluto depends on a lot of things, since a spacecraft is constantly slowing down due to gravity, but can get some speed boosts from gravitational assists."

It's close in delta-V to the main destinations - GEO, Lunar orbit and surface, and transfer to Mars etc. using another gravity assist It's in sunlight almost all the time, vs half the time on the Moon's surface.

Any resources they will find will not be going back to Earth, It's simply too expensive to bring a rocket out there and back again for resources we can find on Earth already.  Indirectly, however, there is this possibility... after a moon base that is capapble of gathering the resources, those resources could be used to refuel rockets.   Which in turn would mean there is an option to send a half-empty rocket towards the moon (making it much cheaper to launch it because it's lighter and, you know, less fuel to load) and refuel there.  Of course, this is quite optimistic and even if it's the future, it wont happen soon. It'll take us a long time (and a big budget) to accomplish that.  And if you want to be really futuristic we could simply construct and launch rockets from the moon. Which would be quite cheap due to the low gravity and lack of that pesky atmosphere that keeps slowing you down."

With the farside, you can skip the orbiting part and get into the ""getting it to the ground"" right away.

Shouldn't it require another few hundred million years to take a planet-like shape?    I think you're misunderstanding the 100 million years thing. Pluto isn't literally <100 million years old, some regions of its surface are. They have been geologically altered within the past 100 million years, perhaps by geysers or volcanic activity. This is based upon the lack of craters in these areas.   Also what do you mean by 'so planet-like'? Define planet like, because that's not what Pluto is."

In other words, some kind of geological process must be actively reshaping the surface of Pluto. What that process is remains a mystery for now, but it could be anything from wind erosion to cryovolcanism to some icy analog of plate tectonics (or all of the above).

The ISRO literally spent less to actually engage in space exploration than it cost to make a half-decent fictional movie about space.   Perspective really is important, and many people who criticize the cost of space exploration do so without any context of how miniscule the public space agency budget allotments are in comparison to other big projects. Investing in science and exploration is incredibly important indeed, and we would not be where we are today as a species if people just spent the money on ""bread and circuses"" distractions.   Entertainment is very important for our species too certainly, but expanding our knowledge is where the REAL power lies for humanity's future. A proper balance must be sought and regulated, because skimping on gaining knowledge that can benefit all of mankind (many times in ways we have not even understood yet) just for personal entertainment is, in my mind at least, incredibly selfish, and only hurts the good of all humankind in the long run."

Not only does it play well at home as you said, but selfishly, it plays very well into their personal political agenda - and that agenda is to get re-elected for their own benefit. Many of them try to exploit public ignorance (rather than educate) and avoid the future benefits to all of humanity specifically to increase their personal odds of success in the near-term.   Not all of them of course. Some politicians (the minority, in my opinion) do care primarily about the ""greater good"", but there is a reason the old saying exists that says ""power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" We are, by and large, a pretty selfish species at the individual level.  Some people though can look beyond themselves and their personal immediate agenda and embrace ideals that will benefit both themselves and all of humankind in the future. Those people are true heroes in my mind. You mentioned STEM studies, and that is an example where the goal for many who enter those fields is not merely personal gain - ie. how will this benefit ME?   Sure, you have to look after yourself first and foremost and make sure you have a career where you and your family can survive, but the evolutionary mantra of ""survival of the fittest"" does not work best at an individual level. It requires people willing to look out for and devote their energies to the greater good of all of us. They are way more important to us all than some guy who can hit a baseball, or someone who can chuck a pigskin or shoot a hockey puck.  Look at the awesome gang of NASA scientists, engineers, and independent contractors who just achieved victory with New Horizons. They were not doing it for the pursuit of personal fame and fortune. They signed up to do it, putting in all those years of effort at a salary level that is typically a lot lower than they could get in the private profit sector, because they love the challenge of science and exploration and furthering the growth of our species knowledge-base, and appreciate the common goal and understanding that the work they do today will benefit ALL of humankind in the years, decades, centuries, to come.  We really do need some impetus today - in the here and now - that will help invigorate the public desire to explore the cosmos. During Apollo, the Cold War was the reason people latched onto - America had to beat the big, bad, Soviet Bear to the Moon. As far as I can see, the only thing that might give our species the kick we need to get back into the manned space exploration game would be unequivocal evidence of life in our Universe - on Mars perhaps. If life on Mars was announced tomorrow (say, fossilized evidence or even current microbial evidence found by one of the rovers up there), we as a species would find the funding in a hurry to get people there."

It's better to think of a major Hollywood production as a small business that makes its investors a lot of money and employs a bunch of people. Gravity cost over $100 million to make, but earned $716 million at the box office. It made people rich.

I disagree on the other point, though, market economies should always promote scientific innovation, provided it is used to develop useful technology that improves lives. I think space exploration is still very much in its infancy, though, so the high entrance cost is limiting public funding for now. We need our engine tech to catch up and get cheaper before the market will start financing NASA again, so it's not so much a limit as a delay until space is accessible."

Some farmers are even mandated to participate in fully sanctioned price-setting cartels. Our health system is mostly privatized, but everyone is required to have health insurance, and the government does not tax income spent on health services. Some states (read: California) have artificially high gas prices because only certain emissions-reducing formulations are allowed to be sold there.

The reality is a great deal of the technology we use each and every single day is a direct result of space exploration, which opened the door for us to have things like GPS, mobile phones, satellite television, live weather tracking half a continent away, LEDs, artificial limbs, better traction for the tires on your car, deicing for planes, etc, etc. I could sit here all day and type out all of the spinoff technologies we use.

The Soviet Union was pushing toward the Moon and American politicians were eager to not be thought of as second-best in anything. It was mud in their eyes that the Soviets had the first living thing in space, the first human in space, the first human in orbit, and the first space-walk. This also explains why funding was cut short after a handful of successful landings.  However, for the people working on the project, the motivation was much deeper, much more visceral. Many were pushed to succeed by national pride, but most were in it for the experience: playing with new technology, exploring a new world, pioneers in a new science, being at the literal forefront of technology and human endeavor. That's why they did it.  It's not enough to do things once. Proving that you can is great, but getting good at it is even better, and we were getting good at it. Had we continued, imagine where we would be. We would have landed on Mars by now, and probably had a Moon base. Instead of talking about a manned mission to Mars in the next 15 to 20 years, we would be talking about expanding our current outposts into permanent habitations.  Sometimes, we do things not because we're trying to accomplish something, but because it seems like fun. That's really what it comes down to. Put yourself in their shoes; the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics has just been assigned the task of landing on the Moon within 10 years and they're looking for a lot of people to fill their ranks. These people will become the flight controllers and directors and mission specialists that will land the first human beings on the Moon. Would you want to join them? If so... why?

We would have gone to the Moon another 3 times had the program not been cancelled because it was too expensive, and Skylab or the Apollo-Soyuz missions would probably have been pushed back years or not happened at all had the hardware not been already bought and paid for.  Remember, compared to other government agencies, NASA's budget is relatively thin, and is constantly getting thinner. From a political standpoint, the mission was to beat the Russians.

It was a giant hairball of science that took decades to fully digest.  Apollo provided insights into almost every field of physical science and technology because knowledge had to be stretched so far beyond its previous limits to achieve success.  It was a huge contribution to American society and human civilization in general, but people question it because it was so fundamental that it spanned every high-tech industry.

But there's also the fact that Pluto has an extreme axial tilt of 120° which means at times that around its solstices around a quarter of its surface is in permanent darkness, whilst another quarter is in permanent sunlight.  This creates an environment of extreme seasonal variation in which may cause a very gradual melting of the planets majority nitrogen ice surface (98%) on one side and refreezing of nitrogen on the other.  I'm sure someone who knows more about the planet could tell you more than this amateur space nerd could though."

For such a highly inclined object at such a large semi-major axis for orbit, it seems any impacts would be far rarer than for planets in the plane of the Solar System or that have larger masses to pull them in (like moons of gas giants having the mass of the gas giant create more impacts). Is it possible that Pluto might have been geologically active for a billion years and then shut down and that the eccentric and inclined orbit prevented impacts so that we are seeing a multi-billion year old impactless surface?"
space,3dezez,ANukeGuy,36,Wed Jul 15 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"You raise several good points, and I don't think anyone really knows the answers. In the inner Solar System, most of the junk that hits the rocky planets is junk from the asteroid belt. Less than 1% is comet stuff, from the Oort Cloud. I think the stuff from the Kuiper Belt that hits us is also less than 1% of the asteroid junk. It is possible that Pluto only encounters 1% to .01% of the meteor hits that Earth or Mars gets, but that still should cover a billion year old surface with wall to wall craters, if there is no erosion or other crater destroying activity.  But, and this is a big but, Pluto's orbit takes it through the space occupied by the Neptune Trojan asteroids. Based on the large distance and the dim light out there, and the few Neptune Trojans that have been found so far, some very credible astronomers predict that there are as many or more asteroids on the Neptune Trojans, than in the main asteroid belt, plus the Jupiter Trojans. That would mean that Pluto could experience an impact rate roughly equal to Mars, or Earth, or the Moon, or maybe much less, because the volume occupied by the Neptune Trojan asteroid belt is about 3000 times larger than the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.  So far as I know, there are a lot of conflicting theories on the density of asteroids out by Pluto. I'm sure some hoped that New Horizons would help to answer the questions, but since its surface appears to be geologically active, no. Our next chance to answer it comes with the launch of JWST, and of dedicated asteroid finding IR telescopes."

So the conclusion is that if you see a heavily cratered surface, it's still showing scars from impacts billions of years ago and hasn't changed much.

Charon has a compact orbital distance of only 12,000 miles from the center of Pluto and both bodies orbit around a common point, known as a barycenter, which is located above Pluto’s icy surface. Recent observations have shown Pluto’s thin atmosphere to be composed mainly of nitrogen and the assumption was that the gas is too heavy and too cold to escape Pluto’s gravity.

space,3dezez,PM_ME_POTATO_PICS,149,Wed Jul 15 19:36:36 2015 UTC,As I understand it the probe is well past pluto at this point (the flyby was yesterday) it's just that the data is being sent back slowly.
space,3dezez,StetsonG,195,Wed Jul 15 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"The data will take 16 months to be sent back because the transmit rate is between 1 and 4 kilobits per second. (yes, bits, not bytes or nibbles). This was talked about in the project scientists' AMA yesterday.   I'm a satellite systems engineer, and though I've never worked something interplanetary, I think I understand the decision behind this.    The spacecraft needed a big boost to get out to Jupiter in time to make its gravity-assist flyby rendezvous, but they were limited to a Delta ATLAS V rocket, which constrained the mission's maximum weight.  Getting a high data transmit rate would require a larger high-gain antenna (that big dish looking thing), which takes more mass.  They'd rather use that mass to put on more science instruments, because that's what planetary scientists do.  It came down to the following trade-off: Do we put on the larger antenna and more powerful transmitter and get our data back in a month, or do we make those smaller and put on one or two more instruments, but have to wait 16 months to get all the data?   So the scientists chose the slower data stream, simply because THIS IS ENOUGH DATA TO KEEP THEM BUSY FOR SEVERAL YEARS, it doesn't matter if they can't get it all at once.   Other missions, like Kepler or the Mars Rovers, or Hubble don't have this flexibility. They are collecting data all the time, at a (kinda) constant rate. So their downink speeds have to at least keep up, or else their disks will get full and keep getting more full.   Since New Horizons is only going to have 3 data collection bursts separated by many years (Jupiter, Pluto, whichever KBO they visit next), they can make the download pretty slow without filling up the disk."

Basically you create a new network on that repeater PC, and you link that network to the home network with the internet. So your bedroom components all link to that PC, and the PC links to the router, and the router to the modem, and the modem to the internet.   It's a neat way of boosting signal in certain areas. Also, useful if your laptop gets WiFi outside your house, but your phone doesn't. Just take your Laptop outside, set it on the patio or whatever, keep it plugged in, and have it act as a repeater. Instant signal boost, and it doesn't cost you anything.   Here's a good youtube video for it."

The entire planet will be mapped but especially the side that was not exposed to the probe during its flyby (rotation of Pluto around it's own axis is 6.4 earth days) will be low resolution as they are using light reflected off of Charon and THEN reflected back from Pluto to Mao that part ( so called Charonshine).   The resolution will also vary for the luminescent sections where most of the heart for example will be in high res (more detailed than released today) with other areas in lower res which I believe to be comparable to today's photo.  The pictures (save for I believe the charonshine) pictures have all been taken already but due to a connection of roughly 1kb/s will take significant time to be transmitted back to earth.

We breathe a corrosive gas, drink one of the most potent solvents.  Our preferred method of hunting was persistence hunting, where we chased animals until their body simply gave up and died.  We can eat just about anything we find, which means that we don't need to stop for food when chasing our prey.  If we can't find food, that's fine. Our body will simply begin to eat itself so that we don't have to stop chasing our prey.  We walk upright, we sweat, we don't have much body hair, which allows us to radiate away our body heat. This means that excessive time or extreme environment wont stop our hunts.  If the animal fights back against us, we can take massive damage to our extremities and lose half our blood and still live.  Our entire existence is owed to persistence, endurance, and determination. When we put ourselves to a task, it gets done, period. And this instinct is still affecting us today.  332BC: Alexander the Great hits a stalemate with the fortified island city of Tyre. Instead of going back defeated, he builds a kilometer long bridge in order to raze the city.  49BC: Cesar, after defeating the Gauls and invading Britain, turns a political fight into a civil war by invading Italy with only a single legion. He eventually becomes dictator starting a world superpower whose engineering feats are only recently being broken.  1804AD: A charismatic French general declares himself Emperor and sets off to conquer much of mainland Europe. He is captured, exiled, and then escapes. The soldiers sent to recapture him instead lay down their arms and join him.  1961AD: One man decides that we will go to the moon, despite much of the technology to do so not even existing yet. Just eight years later, two humans stand on the surface of the moon and look back upon the Earth.  200 years ago, we didn't have railroads. 100 years ago, we didn't have airplanes. 50 years ago, we didn't have spaceflight. 25 years ago we didn't have the Internet.

space,3dezez,Acee83,67,Wed Jul 15 20:41:20 2015 UTC,"NH will continue on its current path till August, which is when the team will decide on its next target. They have enough fuel on board to visit three potential outer solar system objects, labelled PT1, PT2 and PT3. NH can get to PT1 with 100% probability, PT2 with 7% and PT3 with 97% probability. After this, NH will continue on to the Oort cloud and further on to Heliopause. It will ultimately join Voyager 1 and 2 in being the third human probe to go out of the Sun;s region of influence. Since the spaceship is travelling at such a high speed, slowing it down is not an option, only deviating its path is possible. In 2011, NASA used the Hubble and several ground based telescopes to identify potential future targets after the Pluto flyby that were in the vicinity of the flight path. PT1, PT2 and PT3 were subsequently identified. PT2 has since be discarded as a candidate due to low probability of success in getting there. We'll definitely know more by August when the team meets to confirm this."

space,3dh5iu,watermark02,2,Thu Jul 16 07:19:06 2015 UTC,this is the natural colour but not the natural appearance of pluto (to us). the picture is a coloration of the reflection image (black and white). if i only had a link to where i read that - in the natural appearance of pluto the heart is less apparent but the colour is still very similar (maybe less intense)

space,3dh5iu,XtremeGoose,10,Thu Jul 16 09:23:48 2015 UTC,"There's LORRI, which is the high-resolution greyscale camera they've been using to capture images from millions of km away and such. Then there's RALPH, which images in the visible and infrared(?) spectrum. They combine the readings of the two as best they can to get the most realistic interpretation of Pluto's appearance and color as they can."
space,3dh5iu,Gorakka,2,Thu Jul 16 09:36:04 2015 UTC,"LORRI gives high luma resolution, RALPH gives lower resolution chroma data. You combine the two to get a color image. This works pretty well because the eye is much less susceptible to low chroma resolution than low luma resolution."

space,3dh5iu,SuperSMT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:43:20 2015 UTC,Except a hell of a lot darker. The Sun is basically another star out there.
space,3dh5iu,UltraChip,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:39 2015 UTC,"Not really. 3.6 billion kilometres is not that far in terms of illumination from Sol and how light travels. Pluto is 4.6 light HOURS away from the sun. Whilst the nearest star,  which is 39.9 trillion kilometres away is 4.22 light YEARS away. At noon, Pluto is about as illuminated as dawn on Earth. More info here"
space,3dh5iu,dv12900,3,Thu Jul 16 17:14:32 2015 UTC,True but I figured the inverse square law is very significant here. We can just figure it out  P_P / P_E = (r_P / r_E)-2  Where P and r are the power and radius from the sun at Earth and Pluto.   In 2014 Pluto was 32.6 AU from the sun so since Earth is at 1 AU  P_P / P_E = 32.6-2 = ~0.00094  So Pluto's day side gets about a thousandth the light power of Earth's.  Edit: But I guess humans experience light intensity logarithmically so its not so dark.

The news reports mistakenly said that it was false-color but it's actually true color, according to statements from the New Horizons team, unless I'm interpreting those wrong. We won't see any HD pics with color until September probably. The sepia tones they're adding are not from RALPH, as far as I know.   the blurry image https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_feature/public/thumbnails/image/nh-071315_falsecolorcomposite.jpg?itok=rpIj3Jro  combining the color data with the HD greyscale image http://i.imgur.com/ChECeFo.png  Some kind folks on the internet combined the color data from the blurry pic with the HD greyscale pic and this is probably the closest guess of what Pluto truly looks like, until we get better detailed color pics in September.

Now, the surface looks pretty new so it might turn out that the chasms have to have formed in the last ~100 million years or so, eliminating the possibility that they are an artifact from the tidal locking of Charon.   That would make it a lot more interesting. Maybe they were formed due to the freezing of an icy ocean underneath the crust?"

The second part of that sentence is what I'm talking about. I understand your argument, but think about it for a second. You are saying that people should be investing in movies rather than science because you get more money for movies. That is the problem I am talking about. A movie doesn't really benefit anyone, it's entertainment."
space,3di9jy,LdouceT,5,Thu Jul 16 20:36:47 2015 UTC,"Art absolutely benefits people. It inspires people, creates discussions, can be thought-provoking. I've watched movies that were created decades before I was born and learned so much about the culture, history, and time period of the people featured.   How many scientists were inspired by pop-sci novels or Star Trek to become a scientists and later make advancements in their field? Movies like any other art ultimately become a part of history, and learning history is very important. I'm honestly surprised this is turning into an art vs science debate. Both serve unique and wonderful purposes. I can't imagine life without either."
space,3di9jy,saysAverysmallman,-2,Thu Jul 16 20:41:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with you there - both are integral parts humanity and should not be devalued. Military spending is the real problem, spending buttloads of money on killing people doesn't really help people as a whole."
space,3di9jy,LdouceT,3,Thu Jul 16 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"Military spending is the real problem, spending buttloads of money on killing people doesn't really help people as a whole.   Military spending is primarily (over 42%, the largest item, and that includes war operations) on benefits and pay for the other 3 million people (military and civilian) employed by the Department of Defense, the single largest employer in America (nearly 1% of the entire population of the US, for that matter).   Technology spent on killing people is actually only a minor part of it - only 19% of defense spending is on buying new equipment, and that ranges everything from yes, bombs, to aircraft to new satellites and other stuff that has nothing to do with killing people.  A whopping 12% of the DOD budget goes to RDT&E - research, development, testing and evaluation. That's money for everyone from aerospace corporations down to individual researchers and graduate students.  Not to mention, the DOD gives the President a lot of options in foreign diplomacy and trade, which has been hugely advantageous to the US.  Military spending over the decades brought us GPS and ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet the very thing you are typing on. Hell, NASA relies on Air Force Space Command, who monitors all space debris in orbit so NASA doesn't have to.  And much of space technology originated in military spending and projects. The first astronauts rode onto rockets made to deliver nuclear weapons across the world.   It's not a coincidence that the three nations that have independently sent man into space - Russia, the US, and China - are also the three largest military spenders on Earth."

Those aircraft carriers (or more particularly, one aircraft carrier that costs $12 Billion - it's the first ship in the class though so all the R&D is rolled into it, subsequent boats will cost a lot less) are also going to serve 50 years each, have the two most advanced nuclear reactors on Earth powering it, have over 5,000 crewmembers on board, can sail for 25 years without refueling once, are used constantly by the President.  And oh, by the way, a ton of engineering and R&D money went into it, including money to scientists at research labs around the country. Those nuclear reactors and electromagnetic catapults don't come from no where.  If the cost of an aircraft carrier is meant to outrage, it's not a very good example"
space,3di9jy,saysAverysmallman,-7,Thu Jul 16 21:26:11 2015 UTC,The aircraft carriers serve in military and peace keeping missions for the U.S. and all of its allies. The movies are a better comparison to the football stadium because both serve the same purpose: entertainment.

It's not like the government is paying for those movies, it's all private companies investing on whatever they think will make them a profit.

If investing on movies gets them a bigger return than investing on space travel, than why wouldn't they spend their money on making movies, if making money is what they want to do? There's nothing wrong with that. The problem is, we have a government that spends like a fraction of a penny on the dollar for NASA."

And a full moon is brighter than a half moon quite a bit. From the article, Charon is 7x bigger and 5x dimmer than our Moon in the sky. So larger area to reflect light helps a bit.

space,3dlt9t,AnarchistLoL,5,Fri Jul 17 08:46:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is already theoretically happening. It's called a cosmic horizon.   Keep in mind that spacetime is expanding. So chunks of matter like galaxies get further apart. The more distant something is, the faster it recedes. Beyond a certain distance, that recession is faster than the speed of light.   Remember, the matter isn't moving faster than the speed of light, that's impossible. Spacetime is expanding. So what does it look like? Blackness. Light from the universe beyond our cosmic horizon can never reach us so we just don't see it.   Over time, more and more galaxies will fall over the horizon, forever lost."

space,3dlt9t,Bokbreath,0,Fri Jul 17 09:05:41 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to as how the universe's expansion could reach such a rate.I'm not especially familiar with special relativity, but as far as I know, particles cannot ""reach"" the speed of light due to any increase in energy increasing a particles weight, assuming such particle isn't a photon, leading to the famous formula E=MC2 . I'd be quite interested in how someone could explain to me how something could achieve such an enormous mass and energy. From the things I've read, (again, not extremely experienced with special relativity) the universe simply doesn't have the energy to push even one electron to the speed of light. Sorry for not really... addressing your question I suppose."
space,3dlt9t,nukemutant64,2,Fri Jul 17 08:56:14 2015 UTC,Particles can't but space can. The expansion is of space itself. Speed of light restrictions only apply to things travelling in space.

Objects can't reach the speed of light, but the metric expansion of space is not limited to any speed.  It's like when you have an ant on 1 side of an elastic cord, and you pull on the other side of the cord. Even though the ant can not move faster than 'the speed of ant', the distance between the ant and the end of the cord you're pulling might still increase faster than 'the speed of ant',"

Edit: I'm not saying dwarf planets and Kuiper belt objects are mutually exlusive. I'm saying that dwarf planets are still planets. The fact that you have some astronomers calling Pluto a ""dwarf planet"" and others saying it's not a planet at all is evidence that the classification system is still broken. If Pluto isn't a planet, stop calling it one. That means don't call it a ""dwarf planet"" either."

If you're going to go around calling it a dwarf planet, don't chastise people for calling it a planet.  ""Trans neptunian object"" is a poor descriptor because it only works in the solar system. Other systems likely also have things we might call Kuiper belts, so I'm more happy with that. I'm also okay with calling pluto a dwarf planet, or something along the lines of ""giant ice ball"", but if people go with the ""dwarf planet"" designation then Pluto (and many other dwarf planets) are still planets. The word ""dwarf"" is an adjective in this context. It doesn't nullify the word that follows. We'd have more than nine planets in the end. Many more.  But you have people calling Pluto simultaneously ""not a planet"" and a ""dwarf planet"". You don't see the problem with that logic? I really don't care if Pluto ends up being a planet or not, but pick one and stick with it. If it's not a planet, you aren't allowed to call it a dwarf planet either. Things seemed so much clearer  under the subjective ""we'll know it when we see it"" system.  It hasn't cleared its orbit... and that (along with the ""is it round?"" and ""is it the major body in its moon system?"") are the closest we have to an objective system right now. So under that, Pluto is not a planet. And therefore, it can't be a dwarf planet either. Because dwarf planets are planets. All that's left for Pluto is Kuiper belt object (better) or trans-Neptunian object (okay but only works in our solar system).  People say the debate is over, but far from it. Listen to astronomy podcasts where they interview planetary astronomers. Some call it a dwarf planet, therefore a planet. Some say ""not a planet"". There is no consensus yet. This will probably take decades to resolve itself."

But badly written rules don't change the fact Pluto isn't unique enough to be a planet.  Pluto is just a large and close member of a class of objects that number in the hundreds of thousands. The only reason we are having this argument is nostalgia. Had we not discovered Pluto until the 1990s when we started discovering the other Kuiper Belt objects no one, not even Stern would even consider it to be a planet. If Stern want to write a better rule that fits the proper planets thats great he should do so.   It does matter what something is called.

He only cares about Pluto because he has an interest in Pluto.   None of those were considered planets in textbooks. So you don't need to re-print literature when changing the status of Ceres, Eris, etc. (particularly since the latter weren't known at the time).  Pluto did cause cause people to go back and say ""these text books are all now wrong"". And to do that they used criteria on a ""dwarf planet"" that aren't really good criteria.   For example, Pluto/Charon are ambiguous on being Dwarf Planet + Satellite or Binary Dwarf Planet system. An ambiguous definition just replaced another ambiguous definition. It (arguably) ""fixed"" Pluto, but ""broke"" Charon.   I, personally, would be fine with their definition of Dwarf Planet, if they had just said ""Pluto is considered a planet for historical reasons"".  To give an example of definitions being wonky to fit with historical reasons, check out ""classical flow of current"" vs ""flow of electrons"" in electrical engineering. It's largely agreed that fixing the problem would cause textbooks to be reprinted, and thus not worth it. While with Pluto, they did try to fix the problem by trying to reprint text books.

Ceres (as well as Pallas and Vesta) was considered a planet for about 50 years. And its history parallels Pluto's quite closely. We discovered a body, immediately named it a planet, then spent decades not looking. Once we started discovering lots of similar bodies in similar orbits we realized it was not a planet and reclassified it.    Pluto is considered a planet for historical reasons   Thats not how science works. By that definition we also have to consider dolphins and whales fish since Aristotle did historically.  I'm not arguing that the definition can't be improved. But a badly written definition doesn't change the fact Pluto isn't significant enough to justify being a planet. Back to the whales. I can write a definition of fish that says anything with flippers that lives in water is a fish but that doesn't make a whale a fish it just means I need a better definition."

Rather than nailing down the issue or admitting that it's ambiguous.  For example, let's say I print a text book saying Charon is a moon and Pluto is a planet. They then come out and say ""We got new definitions of 'planets' and Pluto is not one, it's a dwarf planet"". So I go to re-print my book. I look at Charon and go: ""well, is this a dwarf planet based on your new definition?"" and they say ""Not sure - call it a moon for now"". I'm over-simplifying, but the point of publishing a definition was to eliminate that 'not sure' call. Which it didn't do. In order for Charon to be labeled as not a dwarf planet, it must be labelled as a satellite of Pluto, which there is no definition of, so it's up to interpretation.  In addition the 'cleared the neighbourhood' criteria is somewhat arbitrary. It's clearly aimed at bodies like Ceres, which would be considered a planet should the asteroid belt not exist. But that shifts the problem of classifying a planet, to one of discovering things near a planet, as mentioned in the article. If you found a large-ish planet further out (say, earth-sized), you can't can immediately call it a planet without making extensive observations of the space around that planet - which may be beyond the resolving power of telescopes. We're currently fairly sure these kind of planets don't exist, but that's just fortuitous, if one is discovered, classifying it could be a real problem."

At most, the dwarf planet thing works fine now but I believe we need to focus more on descriptive terms per exoplanets in the context of their formation and position than what's a planet and what's not.   First off, consider anything large enough for their gravity to make them spherical as a planetary body (everything smaller is an Asteroid), all the way through Brown Dwarfs, up until they have Hydrogen-1 Fusion and are a proper star. That's the top to bottom of planets.  Among that, you've got these characteristic types: Classification from host star spectral type (F, G, K, M), habitable zone (hot, warm, cold) and size (subterran, terran, superterran, jovian, neptunian).   So, applying that to a few things:   Earth = G-Warm Terran Mars = G-Warm Subterran Ceres = G-Cold Subterran Europa = G-Cold Subterran Moon Saturn = G-Cold Jovian Titan = G-Cold Subterran Moon  Uranus = G-Cold Neptonian Pluto = Kuiper Belt G-Cold Subterran Alpha Centauri Ab = K-Hot Terran  Tau Ceti F = G-Warm Superterran Gliese 667Cc = M-Warm Terran   Note: The difference between a subterran and a terran should be the mass/radius capable of retention of a magnetosphere and plate tectonics beyond the formation period (uninhabitable unless a specifically positioned warm moon of a Jovian). The difference between a terran and a superterran should be the mass/radius capable of retaining hydrogen as a greenhouse gas (which moves the hab zone further out).

To me, the planets are not simply the planets. They're an extension of geography beyond Earth. And, there's so much to learn you need to efficiently bundle and group things, in this case Pluto only makes sense being a KBO. To put it with the core planets is going to make the rest of the KBOs (and other subterrans) more difficult to memorize by being part of a huge list. They've got to break it down into chunks. It's not like there's not similar fields in other systems. The Tau Ceti system is surrounded by a debris field likely akin to the Kuiper Belt, and likely will be eventually called its own Kuiper Belt with KBOs inside it, the same.

I think Stern is willfully misinterpreting the ""cleared its neighborhood"" criterion, it's not referring to removing all of the debris from its orbit, it's about removing anything of comparable mass from its neighborhood. Mercury, while small, is plenty massive enough to fling other planetoids away. Pluto, smaller than Mercury, is both gravitationally locked to Neptune (it's stuck in a 2:3 resonance with it) and shares its orbital region with objects of roughly comparable mass.

Neptune's gravity is substantial enough to push it into an orbital resonance, and Pluto's gravity isn't strong enough to break the resonance.  Some of the other planets are close to orbital resonances. For example, Neptune completes one orbit in just over the time it takes Uranus to complete two. However, there's a slight mismatch, and over millenia there is essentially no net gravitational effect between the two. If these two were in an orbital resonance, the amount of energy being traded between these two planets would quickly rearrange their orbits into something more stable, maintaining their gravitational neighborhoods.  Smaller objects (the ""not planets"") tend to get stuck in strong orbital resonances with larger objects, while larger objects (the ""planets"") are big enough that strong orbital resonances are unstable. But it's really hard to define something by the statistical state of the system (how can we determine if objects are in a stable or unstable resonance in a very short time span?), so we use the rule that as long as something is big enough to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium and there's nothing of similar size crossing its orbit, it's probably stable and massive enough to be considered a planet."

The mission did not get funded until just recently.  So... Pluto is much further away now then it would have been back when the missions were first proposed.

It was not written based off evidence then as a result of evidence ended up excluding Pluto.  It also doesn't help that the definition is written poorly.  The meaning of ""Clearing the neighborhood"" is left up to the reader.  Neptune hasn't cleared it's orbit of Kuiper belt objects.  Jupiter hasn't cleared it's orbit of a hoard of asteroids.  How many near Earth objects are there?  I think the biggest reason the vote passed the small amount of IAU members that showed up for the vote is because they don't want Sol to have hundreds (if not thousands) of planets.  If Mercury and Jupiter can be in the same class of object, then mercury and Pluto can be.  Considering the vast range of objects already considered a planet, from a dense core with a cratered crust, to a planet with life on it,  to gas giants, to ice giants, it's silly to exclude the round frozen objects beyond Neptune.  There are almost certainly gas super giants in other solar system who haven't even remotely begun to clear thier orbit.  There's probabally dual systems where one (or both) of them has life on it.  The universe is BIG and doesn't care about the inconvenience caused to science textbooks/museums that having a thousand planets in a system would cause."

Earth would still fit this definition outside Neptune's orbit, as nothing beyond that is of comparable size. Pluto, however, is much smaller. There are objects out there of comparable size to Pluto.

SPACE.com: One of your chief objections is the ""clearing your neighborhood"" stipulation. Under that definition, Earth wouldn't be a planet in some circumstances, right?   Stern: That's an example of what's so ridiculous about it. Suppose that in your mind, you created a solar system exactly like ours, except at each of the orbits of the nine classical planets, you put an Earth. As you go further outward in the solar system, you cross a boundary where Earth is no longer able to clear its zone, because the zone is too big.  It turns out that happens around the orbit of Neptune, maybe Uranus. So you would have nine identical objects, six of which you would call a planet and three of which you would not. They're identical in every respect except where they are.   In no other branch of science am I familiar with something that absurd. ""We're going to call it a cow, except when it's in a herd.""

Even at 14 km/s, at New Horizons' range from Pluto the amount of motion smearing in that amount of time would be miniscule.  I think the problem is that these images are taken at the very limits of the optical system's resolution, so small features are convolved with the telescope's point spread function. You can remove that with sharpening, but you can recover a bit more detail with deconvolution techniques, which is what NASA had been doing to many of the really low-resolution images of Pluto before the flyby last week."

NASA flipped the image so that it looked familiar. There's no difference between a south pole and a north pole on a rotating object in space. And yes, it actually is ""worth"" something.

The picture of Africa was taken upside down and then rotated to be right side up. Because that's the way Earth is commonly viewed, with north being up. The fact is, this image looks like it belongs to the northeast corner of the planet when in fact it belongs to the southeast corner of the planet. The mountains look upside down because...hey, they point in a southerly direction. When you take a pic of something brand new that has existed for less than 12 hours, and flip it, people won't understand that this is not a true to life image of the planet (if you were flying to Pluto from Earth, you would see this region in the south of the planet, not the north). Yeah, if you show Africa upside down, people will know, because they know which way Africa is oriented on the globe, given our most common version of it --24 degree tilt with North upward.Just because there is no up or down in space doesn't mean there is no general expecation or of orientation of a planet. People don't post Mars upside down because it ""looks better"". They don't flip Jupiter over. There is a reason we view planets in common orientations, because that is how they look from Earth .There may not be a north or south in space, but there is the Earth perspective, which is what NASA captured."

If you were flying from Earth to Pluto, you would probably call the top part of the image the southern hemisphere of Pluto.  Also, Pluto's axis points within 10 degrees of the Earth's celestial equator.  But really, if you were flying from Earth to Pluto (or any planet), you wouldn't be able to tell which is the south and which is the north pole by looking out your spacecraft's window.

Plus, your playing a bit of a devil's advocate here. I don't think people will be much confused about a fraction of a photograph being rotated. Do you want all Earth orbit videos and photographs to be rotated to show the true geographic North pointing up ? As well as the moon ? No. This is a photograph, not a map (well, even maps aren't true life image due to transformations way worse than rotation and/or flipping being applied to them)."

I understand the concept of the further away you go from earth, the further back in time you go, but do the (radio) signals deteriorate over time?   I mean I can't pick up a radio station once I get about 80 or so miles away from the transmitter (depending on the Effective Radiated Power of the transmitter). How likely is it that anyone (or anything) could receive those signals 80-90-100 light years away from the transmitter?"

Inferring its behavior from rocks you can hold in your hand is misleading.  It's also mostly ice. Thinking of it as a very dirty iceberg might be closer than ""rock"".  There's also not many large forces on it. It's mostly sunlight and its own spinning motion.   There's also the possibility that it wasn't formed from two comets, but was eroded into this shape from a larger comet instead."

space,3dd6cc,Maldron_The_Assasin,9,Wed Jul 15 17:33:46 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER: this is my understanding, please correct it if I have stuff wrong.   If the contacting surfaces were clean, metal, and flat, then maybe. Atoms in metals exist in a sort of lattice, where electrons aren't bound to any particular nucleus and float around all throughout the material. So if two pieces of metal get in close enough contact, they will start sharing electrons and they will essentially be a single piece of metal. On a macro scale, this requires high pressures, cleanliness, and flat surfaces, because you need enough surface area touching to create a strong bond and you need to bring the two pieces close together on a molecular scale, with very little between them.  But no, two satellites crashing together probably won't stick to each other. The likelihood that two flat surfaces will meet and stay together long enough to bond is very small."
space,3dd6cc,frig_darn,4,Wed Jul 15 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"This is actually a concern for moving metal parts on spacecrafts. The protective oxide coating gets slowly removed during operation, exposing clean metal surfaces, eventually sticking the moving parts together. It doesn't have to be perfect cold welds resulting from clean flat surfaces, since even an incomplete weak weld is enough to cause failure. Here's a nice rundown of different techniques used to prevent cold welding in space."
space,3dd6cc,ionparticle,5,Wed Jul 15 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"like two pieces of metal in a vacuum will spontaneously weld on contact.   That's true, but IIRC requires very clean, even surfaces so they can get good contact without any surface debris/grime/oxides in the way. You're right that an oxygen-free vacuum provides some of those conditions at least.  The point stands that our everyday intuition stops applying well when we start talking about environments and scales wildly different from our everyday experience."
space,3dd6cc,BoojumG,3,Wed Jul 15 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"If they're going slow enough when they touch, there's no stronger force than gravity acting between the two. Matter wants to attract other matter and so if they are just floating slowly, they eventually just group up together."

The lack of an oxidized coating allows the atoms to bond together just like the bonds throughout the rest of the material."

A good example would be Cassini, whereby we often don't get info for quite a while after its taken, because the mission isn't a headliner anymore (I saw a talk by Carolyn Porco where she mentions this fact)  Personally, I'd like to see the images within a day of being received on Earth, however I understand that scientists will want to be the first to see their hard work, and get science done before release. Again, though, Pluto is a HUGE mission for pr, so instant release should be expected."

Instead we see relatively young, smooth features that challenge our understanding. We know the earth and Mars have few craters because of geological and atmospheric processes.

Did you know that diapers are used in people that are sick which means that their diapers must be burnt to avoid spreading of diseases and how much price unfriendly that is?  The MRI experiments on the ISS are close to make portable MRIS that can be used in remote areas with cost friendly materials, and is used to find a way to improve the quality of live of people with osteoporosis (which afffects a huge amount of the population). It wouldn't have had the funds and the data from the research that the astronauts on the ISS and the NASA on ground guys were able to gather if it weren't for manned missions. Also the CAT scanner was used to check space things before it was used to find out things like if you have cancer.  The toothpaste thing was a joke, but as they needed daily use things thatg that didn't floated around because of microgravity some money went to look that and is now in stores like those beautiful microchips in your computer, ear thermometers, the LEDs in your monitor, or that coat against scratches that everyone with glasses thank for every time they don't have to buy new glasses, smoke detectors which NASA developed thanks to those nice funds that they got because of the great publicity manned missions to the moon did for them. Or those flame resistant textiles that were developed and improved because the Apolo 1 exploded with three humans inside, i guess firefighters have something to say about that.  And about earthquakes and weather: most of the data we get today is from satellites but we also get it from the ISS, and some of the funds for weather and climate research went to do  this tiny thing that saved 4 people in Nepals earthquake. If there weren't humans in space exploration i doubt they would have put as much money to develop this.  Ttsl: Apollo ended, and was followed by MIR and ISS and next is the chinese station.

No space program funded MRI research. There's not a really compelling reason to have an MRI on the space station. They can monitor bone density, but they can't do anything if they detect a problem.  A better solution to the problem of bone loss in space is to not be there in the first place.  Innovations in the areas you talk about have continued (and are ongoing). Apollo (and its research and development projects) ended FORTY THREE YEARS ago.  Actually, most of the research and development was completed by the mid 60's, FIFTY years ago).  It's silly to say that we need a boondoggle space program to have innovation.  We have far better fire resistant materials today than we had in the Apollo era, because innovation has continued.  And it won't stop.  We don't need people in space to innovate.  Nobody on the space station is watching for earthquakes.  We might have a robotic device mounted on the structure, but it doesn't need people to operate it. The FINDER technology that saved those four people in Nepal had nothing to do with manned space exploration - it was developed to go on robotic missions. It is not used on the ISS."

MRI research is being done in ground and the ISS right now for portable MRIs an the current crew are the human test on a microgravity environment that also supplies a controled and the most clean habitat that can be found anywhere. MRI wasn't founded for space stuff but it gets funds when for development and improvement when there are things that can only be checked on space, in humans.  The lunar rocks gathered on Apollo missions are still being used to current researchs on ground, yes they have checked almost everything already but there are still a few going on and there are a few that will need more rock samples that could be done better on site. For example how to use regolith to make materials to build probes and see if they work better for space research than those made on earth.  And just in case you haven't noticed: earth is in space, so if we innovate on earth it still counts as needing space to innovate since space is the only place we know that we can live be it in earth or some other planet.  On board the station the crew takes a big deal of photos and gather data from earth about current changes on the surface: fires, clouds, after effects of earthquakes, iland formation etc to understand how our world works on the big picture instead of just from the local view which has lots of limitations to check and understand how everything on earth works.  And the FINDER worked together with the ISS since besides satellites it was around at the time to get the signal and the photos of the area that helped a lot at that time.   Do you think that there wasn't any funds that NASA got, because there were and are manned missions that gives them the publicity and the public attention that makes those funds go to them, and where used to build that prototype among countless of things?

An human response would be on time to solve any issue since there is no delay at all.  The purpose of landing on the moon was about: put an end to a cold war by sending a ""message"" that say ""if we can get to the moon we can do more to those that are at a closet reach"", about learning if we can get out of the planet at all in case of for example a massive volcano eruption that would render the earth inhabitable, to see if we can have an escape plan just in case of anything that affects the whole planet would occur, to see if humans could survive it, to get data from the bodies of the ""human test"" that we call astronauts, because we didn't have the type of robots that could do the work they did there as efficiently and cost-saving as the humans, to confirm if there was anything on the moon that could be useful at earth (which we found out by checking those 'useless' rocks), to learn if other space stuff than earth had other minerals/fuels/gases/etc that couldn't be found in earth (which turns out it happens).  Without the manned missions, the goverments would have used the funds to keep doing war related things instead which yes it still means technological innovation  but the outcome for humanity would have been completly different and probably not so focused in medical and communications technology improvement.  Besides the funds are mostly to pay the humans that have the knowlege that can learn, and  apply it, rather than to the other resources needed to do the robots.  Also, the main problem for budget is the fuel to get out of the planet and that is expensive be it for taking a probe out or 3 humans.  On the other hand: no one pays more money to retrieve the probes back to earth which means than more than half of the science research that could be gathered isn't. For humans, they pay to bring them back home so they do ALL the science research avaliable since they know they will gather it all.  And that makes the hugest difference between space exploration for robots and humans, the amount of research that makes it back home to further test."

space,3dnp61,Archalon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""redundant"" is the word you meant.    Yes, a large enough asteroid could kill off the human race, but it is extraordinarily unlikely.  A Cretaceous-sized event would certainly not suffice; plenty of humans would survive with a technological and resource level very far above any space colony.    It's certainly important to defend against major impacts, but that's not the same as survival.  Climate deniers make the same mistake when they say that humans survived the ice ages -- yes, but we shouldn't be worried about survival, we should be worried about massive death, destruction, and morbidity.   Just for kicks, I glanced at a paper by Shoemaker in Sharpton, Global Catastrophes in Earth History, on google books.  He estimates (p164) the collision probability with asteroids to mag 13, or approximately 9 km and larger, at 3 x 10-9 yr-1 , or about one every third of a billion years.  That's roughly the size of the Chicxulub impactor.  We've certainly discovered most of those, although there is always a new (small but steady) influx.    At that rate, I just don't think it's critical that we work out a backup survival plan over the next hundred or thousand years, though we should certainly keep our eyes open.    I'm not saying asteroid impacts wouldn't be dramatic and terrible.  I'm saying the probability is exceptionally small that it would be an issue of human survival."

The hard part of that is detecting the asteroids. B612 is currently working on sentinel, a satellite that will detect asteroids big enough to cause any form of large scale damage and inform us, NASA/ESA/Any other space agency then will send a probe to ""push"" said asteroid out of the way."

Doing a quick ctrl+f on that list I see Styx was only imaged in one sequence, taken at a distance of ~600,000 km late on July 13th (1743-45 UT). Looking at the image resolution other bodies in the Pluto system taken at the same distance, we get a value of about 3.5 km/pixel. Depending on the actual size of Styx (10-25 km), that works out to an image size of 2-7 pixels.  For Kerberos, I see the closest imaging sequence is taken at a distance of 320,000 km early on July 14 (0024 UT), and that works out to an image scale of 1.8km/px.

Even less after compression.  edit: yes, I understand that pluto and charon have priority... what I mean is that the picture of Hydra is much much smaller. If the spacecraft dies tomorrow, what would you rather have, the last two lines of pixels in the pluto surface image (out of the 1024), or the max resolution Hydra picture?  I am sure they had their reasons, but I don't find it obvious."

The connection there is that it lived in a very special lake. at the bottom of the lake was an entrance to the underworld.

A few days later I got a call from someone at my representative's office, saying he hadn't heard about the proposed mission, and how fascinating it was - he seemed really excited about it.

That might require more energy. Data transmission to earth will take longer.  The sensor on LORRI is a CCD47-20, 1024×1024 pixel frame transfer CCD with 13 micron square pixels. Thats not too bad for the time New Horizons was built, the sensors on MRO or MSL are not much better.  LORRI is B&W, it doesn't have filters. The colors are overlays from the Ralph instrument.

If we want to understand the formation of our solar system, the internal workings of ice giant planets, and learn more about their fascinating moons, we need to send an orbiter to one of them. Neptune is farther away (longer wait) but it has Triton, which is likely a captured KBO and an active body so would be awesome to study.

In other words, not really feasible with current technology."

space,3de75i,project23,62,Wed Jul 15 16:07:47 2015 UTC,"Sure. Part of the justification for the New Horizons mission was that it would be a ""tour"" of the Kuiper belt, visiting Pluto system plus at least one other object -- that's one reason it was selected for the New Frontiers program. But since the KBO mission is an extended mission, the NH team can't take it for granted that they will be funded to do that, because they have to compete for extended mission funding with all other planetary missions, and if they take things for granted, NASA HQ can punish their hubris. So they have to be careful not to talk about an extended mission as though it's a sure thing, even though it's part of the whole reason the mission was selected. It's an absurd situation, but typical for government bureaucracy. NH people are constantly trying to trick HQ people into stating that an extended mission will definitely happen, because it's just dumb to say it's not."

space,3de75i,HenkPoley,19,Wed Jul 15 17:03:05 2015 UTC,New Horizons carried a RTG for energy requirements. Thus the light of the sun reaching would be very low. How did the probes camera capture such a vivid image?
space,3de75i,Paki_mon,56,Wed Jul 15 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"First of all, it's not really that dim; it's like twilight on Earth. Do a Google search on ""Pluto time"" for explainers on that. Second of all, just as in photography on Earth, you choose a camera detector and an exposure setting that exposes the scene well and you get a nice picture. LORRI is a very sensitive camera; it actually had a difficult time photographing the moons of Jupiter because they were too bright, they saturated the detector. It did its best imaging of Jupiter moons on the night sides of the moons, where they were illuminated by Jupitershine."

We'll be seeing some of those later today. But those images will have been heavily compressed by a JPEG-like compression scheme before transmission to Earth, so fine details may be lost. Eventually, we will get losslessly compressed data from the spacecraft that will be much better for photogeology."

I also hate to specialize; I like being a space journalist because it means I can cover the whole solar system. (I liked doing geophysics as a scientist, for the same reason -- geophysicists tend to do a lot of work that applies to many planets/moons at once.) So I'm not any more interested in Pluto than I am in any other world. I will say that I am particularly interested in the ""not-planets"" in our solar system, the smaller, but still round worlds that are moons and kuiper belt objects and large asteroids."

space,3de75i,wm27182818,24,Wed Jul 15 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"You know, the Philae landing was really confusing. We got that touchdown signal, but then it was not at all clear what was going on -- they knew it was spinning, and that didn't make sense because it was supposed to be on the comet -- there was so much contradictory information, and a very slow pipeline of that information to the media, so it was very exciting (ultimately, the fact that the lander was still transmitting to Earth was the major thing to celebrate, no matter what), but at the same time it was a little frustrating because we didn't know what was going on. With NH, we knew what was going on. Of course it's easier to know what's going on when everything is nominal."

My question is this:  Do you know of any advanced secondary school maths resources (single & multivariable calculus, linear algebra, statistics) which I could use for my students that are relevant to space exploration? Perhaps a data-dump or problem statement/s that are relevant to various missions?   I have a feeling that numerical solutions to Newton's equations with adjustments for relativity would be particularly interesting and relevant. Someone recently suggested I let them play with Kerbal Space Program and try to simulate the various missions themselves.   I appreciate all the time and effort you have put into sharing the joy of space exploration with the public. Cheers!"
space,3de75i,Marooned202,16,Wed Jul 15 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know of specific resources, I'm afraid, but I think you're on the right track. One thing that I know people like to do is to challenge students to design a mission within mass and budget and power constraints -- everybody wants to send every instrument to the most distant planets, but you can't afford or launch or power that, so you have to pick and choose what you will do at what target. There may be exercises like that online."

Yes. Thank you!   Based on your earlier comment I think I'll cook up something regarding the exploration of the Uranus and Neptune systems.

I have to say some of my proudest moments have been several times this week, during interview sessions featuring New Horizons team members in front of an audience of worldwide space media, and a media question makes a NH team member stop and say, ""I don't know the answer to that question off the top of my head, but I think Emily probably does."" :)"

What's next on the agenda for the Planetary Society in terms of pushing missions? You folks obviously had a pretty big success in getting New Horizons going, and Europa Clipper seems to be becoming a possibility.   Also, is there any way to leave Cassini in orbit around Saturn rather than driving it into the planet? It seems like a waste of a good spacecraft versus putting it in orbit around one of bigger moons."
space,3de75i,digiwinne,11,Wed Jul 15 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not Emily, but I am with The Planetary Society (Communications Manager). One of the most exciting planetary missions the Society is supporting, outside of Europa, is a manned mission to Mars orbit. We held a workshop in April to explore the feasibility of sending humans to one of the Martian moons, Phoebos or Deimos. A full report containing the results of the discussions will be released this summer."
space,3de75i,watusi65,3,Wed Jul 15 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"The end-of-mission plans were decided by the mission team years ago. Both leaving Saturn to visit a Trojan asteroid or Uranus as well as parking it in orbit around Titan were considered, but it was decided that this strategy was the best balance for science, cost (waiting 20 years to go to Uranus means you have to keep people on staff the whole time), and risk of contaminating Enceladus or Titan with traces of Earth bacteria."

space,3de75i,ddollarsign,17,Wed Jul 15 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"That's generally not a good thing to do with a sensitive camera. New Horizons will be taking (indeed, has already taken) lookback images at a very high phase, showing Pluto system targets as incredibly thin crescents. We're likely to see a lot of ""stray light"" streaking those images, because LORRI doesn't have a very long baffle, so sunlight will sneak in."
space,3de75i,0thatguy,3,Wed Jul 15 16:26:04 2015 UTC,I'm also curious about this.  I wonder if they'll do something similar to the Pale Blue Dot done by Voyager 1.  I sure hope so.

space,3de75i,jccwrt,4,Wed Jul 15 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"Someone said there was no way to do that because if you turned back towards Earth to capture it, you'd blow out LORRI because the Earth lines up with the Sun too much.    No PBD from Pluto, alas."
space,3de75i,wildespace,2,Wed Jul 15 16:47:54 2015 UTC,"Yup. Because Pluto is a fairly dim target as astronomical bodies go, LORRI is a very light-sensitive camera.

space,3de75i,its_leah,6,Wed Jul 15 17:09:20 2015 UTC,Do we have a sense of the diversity of objects out there in the Kuiper belt? Charon and Pluto look very different from one another. Will the same be true for Eris?
space,3de75i,Oscuraga,19,Wed Jul 15 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"The Kuiper belt is VERY diverse. They have a wide range of densities (meaning their internal compositions and likely their geologic histories are very diverse). They have a wide range of colors. They have a wide range of shapes. Many of them have satellites. Most of them probably have surface tectonic features as a result of cooling -- most would have been liquid at some point, and as ice is less dense than water, it expands as it cools and that at least cracks the surface and could cause water from the interior to erupt onto the surface. So they will all likely look very different, even more different from each other than the outer planet moons look like from each other. I want to go explore more of them, but it's hard because of the distance involved."
space,3de75i,its_leah,7,Wed Jul 15 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"Hello Emily, thank you for doing this Q&A.  I am trying to find information on the surface chemistry of bodies in the Pluto system. Do you have any perticular resources to recommend?  What are the leading theories, given the recent images, for the composition of the different structures seen on the surfaces of Pluto and Charon? Are the dark bands near the equator complex organic ices? Are the lighter-coloured ones composed of smaller molecules (N2, CH4, CO, CO2)? Or is this assessment completely wrong? What do we know about these organic ices? Do they self-assemble to mesoscopic structures? In short, can we learn enough from the images to construct sufficiently accurate models of the processes that take place at the surface?  Thanks in advance."
space,3de75i,Oscuraga,9,Wed Jul 15 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"Specific mapping of composition of ices to Pluto surfaces will be one major scientific result of the flyby, so stay tuned for that. But Pluto definitely has N2, CO, CH4 ices on its surface. Search the ADS abstract system for papers on Pluto's composition. If you don't have access to the papers yourself, write a polite and brief email to the ""corresponding author"" listed for the publication requesting a PDF, and you will often be rewarded."

I'm not really an expert on this so don't have a great answer. But the first thing I noticed about the photo of the women on the NH team is that there were no Black women, no Latinas, not even any obviously Asian women....whatever process has benefited white women, it hasn't helped women of color.

They've narrowed the KBO candidates down to two, whichever one they pick would be flown by in the 2018-2019 timeframe.

Here's the idea Will Grundy floated yesterday about the dark pole: molecules of methane and nitrogen from Pluto's atmosphere escape and hit Charon, but they don't ""stick"" because it's too warm over most of its surface except at the winter pole. So they accumulate at the winter pole. When the sun begins to rise on the winter pole, UV photolysis converts the methane and nitrogen to tholins, which aren't volatile, so they say stuck to the ground at the pole, even in summer. Tholins are red and dark so are a good candidate for Charon's dark, red pole. Grundy said that when all they had was the black and white LORRI images, he predicted that the pole would be red, for that reason, and so it was :)"
space,3de75i,zeroy,4,Wed Jul 15 17:19:51 2015 UTC,Hi Emily! I'm a big fan and have really appreciated your coverage on New Horizons. My question is: what kind of data can we expect for Kerberos and Styx? I've been unable to get a straight answer for these two moons. Pictures? No pictures? Would we be able to make out their shapes and at least some details? Could we figure out why Kerberos' albedo is so different from other moons? Thanks!
space,3de75i,zeroy,6,Wed Jul 15 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not sure what the highest resolution expected is; I need to ask about that. They weren't discovered until after launch, so there weren't many observations planned. But we should be able to figure out shape and albedo at least. As for your last question, they would love to figure that out; I don't know if they will."
space,3de75i,phlegmbrulee,2,Wed Jul 15 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"I did a quick ctrl+f on the schedule of observations given by the New Horizons team, it appears that the mission did take images of Styx and Kerberos.  It looks like Styx was only imaged in one sequence, taken at a distance of ~600,000 km late on July 13th (1743-45 UT). Looking at the image resolution other bodies in the Pluto system taken at the same distance, that works out to about 3.5 km/pixel. Depending on the actual size of Styx (10-25 km), it should be a 2-7 pixel image.  For Kerberos, I see the closest imaging sequence is taken at a distance of 320,000 km early on July 14 (0024 UT), and that works out to an image scale of 1.8km/px. Again, we don't know the exact size of Kerberos, but with an assumed size range of 13-34 km, means an image 7-19px across, so roughly the same size as the Hydra image released today."
space,3de75i,zareny,7,Thu Jul 16 03:55:49 2015 UTC,Why doesn't Ralph camera have a green filter for allowing red/green/blue colour images?
space,3de75i,Jurph,18,Wed Jul 15 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"Because it wouldn't tell us any much of interest about the compositions of the surfaces we expect to see in the Pluto system, and color data is highly redundant and very expensive to transmit (you're sending at least 3 pictures of the same target, 3 pictures that really look very similar to each other). It's really not necessary for science, and it's not hard to compute true-like color from red, blue, and clear-filter images, since the clear filter image contains information from the green wavelengths."
space,3de75i,padowan,3,Wed Jul 15 16:53:14 2015 UTC,Will New Horizons ever stop moving?
space,3de75i,SteveShawCA,3,Wed Jul 15 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"In relation to what? If you mean in relation to the Sun, then no, New Horizons will continue moving outwards and eventually escape the solar system, just like the Voyager probes."
space,3de75i,glittaknitta,3,Wed Jul 15 17:24:47 2015 UTC,I guess what I'm asking is will it ever run out of whatever energy it is using and stop moving completely?
space,3de75i,gevmage,5,Wed Jul 15 20:52:42 2015 UTC,"oh I see.  Well, unlike an airplane, in space you'll keep moving forever unless something else applies a force to you. Normally it is gravity what keeps you locked in place, but in the case of New Horizons, the ship is moving so fast that the sun's gravity no longer is strong enough to stop it. It slows it down yes, but it can't make it stop anymore.  So while the ship will indeed run out of electrical ""power"" at some point once its radioactive battery dies out, preventing us from communicating with it; the ship itself will continue to move forever. And I guess that given enough millions of years, it may even reach another star should it cross into its way."

space,3de75i,sequel7,2,Wed Jul 15 23:53:27 2015 UTC,"If it does, in fact, reach/come close enough to another star, that would at least slow it down, right?"
space,3de75i,Jenksz,3,Wed Jul 15 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"If it collides with something in the way, then definitely yes XD  But if it just swooshes by, then a number of things may happen depending on the circumstances.  If a thousand-year-old New Horizons arrives at another star with a slow enough speed relative to such star, then yes, this new star would slow it down. However, I'm not exactly sure how big such star should be or how ""slow"" New Horizons should arrive in relation to it in order to be caught. Because as it plunges into the gravity well of the star, it will gain a lot of extra speed, which will then loose as quickly as it flies away. And I'm not entirely sure if such loss of speed would be enough to stop it altogether and prevent it from escaping into interstellar space again.  Another likely scenario thou, is that the ship encounters a big planet or body that is orbiting the star, and that via a gravity assist it gets caught. (A gravity assist is a maneuver were by flying close to a planet you gain or loose a bit of the planet's own orbital speed depending on which side of it you approached from. This can speed up, or slow down your ship),  This kind of catching by a planet is similar to what is believed to have happened to Neptune's moon Triton. It was likely an object from the Kuiper belt (of which Pluto is part of as well) which was caught by a fortuitous encounter with Neptune a long, long time ago. Many other moons are likely caught this way as well."

And the dish is almost as wide as the spacecraft; you wouldn't want to shrink that at all. They could have made the dish a little bigger, which would have helped with the data volume problem."

space,3de75i,tortugaconqueso,12,Wed Jul 15 17:03:03 2015 UTC,Sure it could.

There is work being done on this but it's not ready for prime time yet.
space,3de75i,ikeusa,3,Wed Jul 15 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"Does the clear existence of craters on the surface rule out recent tectonic plate activity?   Does the fact that there are craters but not as many as the moon indicate the opposite point - that there is tectonic plate activity? Or can this be explained with atmospheric erosion?  Would you expect a higher rate of asteroid impacts where Pluto is in the solar system, versus the moon?"
space,3de75i,itonlyadds,8,Wed Jul 15 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'd remove the word ""plate"" from your questions -- as far as we know, Earth is the only world with plate tectonics. I'd say it looks like Pluto has some craters but not very many, and Jeff Moore said yesterday that he saw modified craters, which means that there has been major geologic activity since the early days of the solar system. But I think it's too early to say how old the surface is, and whether it's currently being modified at all by tectonic activity or only by climate changes over the course of its orbit and seasons. There should be fewer impacts at Pluto's distance from the Sun, but more importantly, the impacts out there happen way slower than impacts in the inner solar system. Impact speeds are (IIRC) closer to 1 or 2 km per second whereas they're 10s of kilometers per second in the inner solar system; also the density of the projectiles is much lower so there's way less energy involved. All this means that craters will be smaller."

The New Horizons team is adamant that the geological features on Pluto were not caused by tidal forces from Charon. They said the two bodies were in a sort of ""equilibrium"" and did not exert those kind of forces on each other.   I'm not very informed about this kind of thing. Could you explain why tidal forces are not significant here?"
space,3de75i,vardaasen,2,Wed Jul 15 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"On a tidally locked body the tides are fixed, they don't move around, so they don't create tidal heating.   Take a metal spoon, for example, and then bend the handle back and forth. That'll heat up the part of the spoon that's bending, and weaken it well, eventually causing break there. Now take a spoon and then bend it once then leave it that way. You no longer get heating and breakage."

Not only has it been a medium between the public and the space agencies (In other words, you have been making data and images easily accessible, which are otherwise difficult or impossible to find), you have also guided us through amazing analysis through the geology of many objects in our solar system!   My two main questions are:   Did the New Horizons team change their high-resolution targets once they got a good view of Pluto and Charon? (Did they try to target specific features?). Or was this entire sequence of closet approach maintained precisely since months ago? You previously said that the disappearing and recurring atmosphere theory of Pluto has been shown unlikely (A theory I have held on to since a few days ago). What's the latest consensus on this from the team? How tenuous is the atmosphere at present? Has the conclusion you mentioned been reaffirmed or has it been slightly debunked or altered? I realize this theory will change as the data comes in over the next year (and more).   Please keep up your amazing work!

space,3di5ys,AlgizOthila,3,Thu Jul 16 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason we search for life similar to what we know is down to Carbon. Life (as we know it) uses it as it's most basic building block. Due to the nature of carbon, it is able to form structures with amazing stability, with allows for progressively more and more complex structures. A simple as protein strands up to DNA, up to both single-celled and multi-celled life.  However, you could be quite right in that there are non-carbon-based-lifeforms out there. We just haven't seen any examples of it in nature, nor have we been able to create one successfully in simulations.  As for Jupiter and Saturn; we have to consider their structure. As they are both gas giants, it is only at very low altitude that there would be any semblance of liquid. And even at that, it would be a vast ocean of liquid hydrogen and helium. This liquid is only possible due to the gravitational pressure of such a vast body, so would be very hot too. So even under miles and miles of inhospitable gas, you have a highly pressured boiling ocean.  Plus it wouldn't be as clear cut as our sea - that is separate from our sky. It would all kinda be a graduating scale of progressively thicker and denser gas.  Then due to all the insane pressures and temperatures, both planets have, for lack of a better term, 'storms'. Massive weather systems that swirl endlessly.  Also, their distance to the sun can mean that they have areas that are surprisingly, and also quite inhospitably, cold. Potentially able to freeze parts of the gaseous atmosphere (sublimation)."

Moreover, the difference in temperatures could allow for even more mixing of different forms of materials would it now?"

space,3dhvsd,wifcy6tt,3,Thu Jul 16 12:09:52 2015 UTC,It is a question that would probably hurt the head of the avid physicist.  I personally don't know how the expansion of spacetime would affect a spacetime wormhole.  Maybe the wormholes themselves would undergo the same expansion (seeing as they are essentially spacetime and part of the universe).
space,3dhvsd,Flyberius,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:31:05 2015 UTC,"Hi, this question is a little bit hard to answer because the nature of wormholes, curvature of space due to mass and the way the universe expands doesn't really allow for the sort of scenario you're asking. Ill give it a shot though.   First of all, the existence of an 'edge' of the universe is highly disputed. There is indisputably an edge to the observable universe, but an edge to the universe is quite unbelievable in my opinion. This video series covers these topics quite nicely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyb6tu4S_I  Even assuming an edge to the universe, the way that the universe expands is not like a curtain revealing more space and stuff, whisking away the edge of nothingness. If there were a wormhole connecting the edges of the universe, the expansion of space would basically have no effect. The wormholes would remain on the edges of the universe, but the space between them would increase. This is analagous to taking a disk of rubber, drawing two points on the disk, then stretching the rubber outward. Or, equivalently, two points on a balloon."

Yes the laws of motion and gravity work the same no matter the size of the object, they account for mass in the equations.   if there are many small objects (~7000) in asteroid belt could NASA keep record of each of them   The Minor Planet Center keeps orbital elements on all discovered objects. NASA, as well as the public has access to that data.   What measures do NASA take while flying through that part?   Don't aim for them. The only way a probe is going to hit one of the asteroids is on purpose.

Saturns rings are about 105 times less dense than the terrestrial atmosphere at sea level. The asteroid belts are much less dense than Saturn's rings.  The only way to hit anything in the asteroid belt is to aim for it on purpose.  If we knew such a particle existed yes we can predict it the math works the same no matter how massive or small an object is. However we can not detect single particles that small at that distance, just clouds of them. We would avoid any clouds but those clouds are going exclusively around larger bodies anyway because gravity pulls them together. We did do some work before the close approach to Pluto because there was concern New Horizens might pass through a dust cloud. It didn't."

Actually, it's pretty difficult to have something be captured solely by a planets gravity. When this happens with something large like an asteroid being captured as a moon, it's typically a long, slow process over many, many orbits around the sun.  For spacecraft, we typically either use engines or aerobreaking (having the craft fly through the thin upper layers of the atmosphere) to get rid of excess relative velocity so that it can enter orbit.

Billions are spent every year finding a cure for cancer.  It's good that we have our scientific interests spread out.  We should be looking at everything.  If we start declaring what can and can't be studied, we limit ourselves and we limit our knowledge.  And what may be discovered in one area can lead to innovation in others.  I can't tell you what benefit New Horizons will give us, because it's not personally my area of expertise.  I can say that it does tell us more about our own solar system, you know, the one we live in.   Why shouldn't we learn about it?   If you live in New York, does that mean you shouldn't bother learning anything about London?  Even if the data from Pluto doesn't yield us anything that you would consider beneficial to humanity, the expedition still stands as an impressive feat of engineering.  For a long time we only knew Pluto as a distant speck of light.  We didn't know what it look liked.  So what did we do?  We shot a probe across a billion miles and took a picture.  Think about how impressive that is.  It's like standing in San Francisco and launching a pebble to hit a specific house in Boston.  If we want to consider the extreme long-term survival of humanity, space exploration is something we must consider.  Yeah, it all seems like fantasy now, but it starts somewhere.  And if we never take those first steps, it will never happen.  New Horizon is part of those first steps.  Why should we confine humanity to sit here on this tiny rock we call Earth?  That's a sad thought.  And are you really upset that some of your tax dollars went towards this?  Why not be upset at the tax money spent shooting people in the middle east?  Only a few dollars of your money went towards this mission.  Less than you would spend on a trip to Starbucks or McDonalds.

[that] have come at a cost"" Link The fact of the matter is that it is impossible to predict whether a line of scientific inquiry will produce anything useful or not, and it can sometimes be decades or more before its value can be fully understood or recognized.   Literally every human pursuit accomplishes that goal.   Uh, not unless you assume that the entire universe is exactly the same as everything here on Earth. Our study of what we can see out there indicates that this is definitely not the case.  NASA's budget for 2014 was $17.65 billion. The sum of NASA's budgets from 1958 through 2014 is just over $1 trillion, or a little less than double what the US spends on defense in two years. Basically, your question is asking why we would throw a bread crust to a dog (that happens to invent revolutionary new technologies when it isn't begging for table scraps) when there are children starving in Africa.  Space is, for us, not only a source of knowledge and wonder but a source of vast untapped potential as well. Ours is but one planet in a star system full of useful and valuable resources.   As to your question:   Can you state with certainty that space exploration has created the best possible developments compared to what might have been?   Of course not, but that question is absurd. For all you know, solving world hunger might spare the life of a child who might otherwise have died of starvation but who instead grows up to start another world war. You can't accurately predict the future."

There are about 115m family households in the US - so that amounts to something like $153 dollars each house. Not much you say? But I bet if you asked most people they would welcome it back because they could spend it on something that actually changes their lives in a more real way.  Its stupid to compare it to the defense budget as a justification - BOTH sets of expenses are a gross abuse against the general public.  When people are being robbed at gunpoint for a large amount, you can't just sneak in and steal a little bit more and have it not still be considered stealing."

My goal for this visualization was to see how far across the 'domes' would be, if Pluto and Charon were embedded in the surface. While admittedly kind of contrived, for me at least, this gives a more intuitive idea of the scale of these objects.  I do think it would be interesting to see this map superimposed on orthographic projections of Pluto and Charon, to see relative surface areas as well. It would be kind of confusing to put both comparisons in the same image though.  It is true that the width of the US is greater than that of Pluto and Charon's combined -- what my image illustrates.

(It's the size of the mini-probe Cassini dropped, for comparison.)  Theoretically, yes, we could have used a bigger rocket and included an engine to put it into orbit around Pluto. But it would have been much more expensive, and actually taken a lot longer.  The reason New Horizons could reach Pluto in 10 years is because of it's immense speed. It left Earth orbit on an escape trajectory from the sun, and (except for swinging by Jupiter) flew in basically a straight line to Pluto. We could have used a bigger rocket, accelerated it faster, and gotten it there in less time, but then our flyby would have been even shorter.  If we wanted to go into orbit, we couldn't have gotten there nearly as fast. Instead of a more or less straight line, we'd have used a Hohmann Transfer orbit. (Half of an elliptical orbit, with the low end at Earth and the high end at Pluto.) That would have been much, much slower. I haven't worked out exactly how much longer, but probably less like decades and more like centuries.  (Edit: Fixed Hoffmann to Hohmann)"

space,3di2lc,LIPCSB__,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:40:06 2015 UTC,"10 years was even pushing it. Think of it this way, in order to get there in only 10 years at least the earth, Jupiter, and Pluto had to be in exactly the right spot.   Going faster may have actually made it harder. You don't want Jupiter to capture new horizons, but at the same time you don't want to go to fast and shoot out the other side.   You want it ""roll around"" Jupiter. Now say we skipped Jupiter. Even with the best rocket we have today it would take 90+ years to get there.   Want to stop at Pluto? Well first we'd need to figure out how to orbit it because Pluto and Charon are a binary system (the both orbit a spot in the center) then we would need a second rocket as big as the first in order to slow it down below escape velocity.   On top of that, we didn't actually know how ""big"" Pluto and Charon were. So now say we did want to orbit them and figured out our best guess of their size based on a small rock planet and moon.   We hurtle our satellite there based on those numbers and its actual composition is more like a comet. Then our velocity is way to high and we blow right past it.   Now another factor is you are spending millions of dollars on it. We really didn't know what to expect orbiting around Pluto. We could have ""parked it"" in orbit and lost it to an unknown moon.   Our best case scenario was to throw it at it, tracking the stars looking for anything in the way and get as much done as quickly as possible just in case."

At upper right, along the moon's curving edge, is a canyon estimated to be 4 to 6 miles (7 to 9 kilometers) deep. Mission scientists are surprised by the apparent lack of craters on Charon. South of the moon's equator, at the bottom of this image, terrain is lit by the slanting rays of the sun, creating shadows that make it easier to distinguish topography.

To get an idea, open paint (or something similar), put in some small text, and save it as a jpg, and open it in an image viewer. The difference between the text you saw when you initially typed it and the jpg is due to jpg's lossy format. Or you can probably search something like 'jpg vs png'."

space,3dbp8k,windan,8,Wed Jul 15 08:14:25 2015 UTC,"8 GB of solid state storage wasn't cheap in the early 2000s when New Horizons was being designed.    I remember seeing the first 8 MB (Megabyte) USB drives in 2001. My girlfriend at the time worked in parts qualification at IBM and was given some production samples.  They were called ""Disk on Key.""  Those were pretty pricey (>$100) and didn't look like they were going to be practical compared to the 640MB or 700MB you could stick on a CD-R which had become relatively cheap (under $1 a disc).   Capacities have gone up and prices have gone down dramatically since then, but New Horizons is a product of that era.  8 GB of solid state storage was luxurious then.  You're probably talking a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of storage and that's not considering any costs to radiation harden it."
space,3dbp8k,xzaz,3,Wed Jul 15 09:01:43 2015 UTC,"Good point. I didn't realize it was a solid state drive, or that radiation hardening was done on it (I'll have to look that up later.)

It will exit the solar system, and never land on anything.  Rosetta is fine, and is currently orbiting a comet. Philae is the lander which had a failure when it landed. It's harpoons AND thrusters did not fire, causing the lander to bounce into a crevice. For 8 months it was silent, but just recently started to communicate with Rosetta again. So far, it is not performing any real science, and nobody knows if it ever will. It wasn't a complete disaster, but has collected less than 1% of the information they originally planned on.

It will also study other objects in the Kuiper Belt.[36] By way of comparison, New Horizons will gather 5,000 times as much data at Pluto as Mariner did at Mars.[37]  Some of the questions the mission will attempt to answer are: What is Pluto's atmosphere made of and how does it behave? What does its surface look like? Are there large geological structures? How do solar wind particles interact with Pluto's atmosphere?[38]  Specifically, the mission's science objectives are to:[39]   map the surface composition of Pluto and Charon characterize the geology and morphology of Pluto and Charon characterize the neutral atmosphere of Pluto and its escape rate search for an atmosphere around Charon map surface temperatures on Pluto and Charon search for rings and additional satellites around Pluto conduct similar investigations of one or more Kuiper Belt objects    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons#Goal"

An ice ball. Insignificant and so distant that it was impossible to know what was happening on the surface other than it was incredibly cold. Frankly nobody cared. Pluto was just ice. When I first heard about Pluto it was already forgotten and ignored. It WAS considered a planet when I first learned about our solar system, but it was so out of each and so impossible to explore that it was brushed over. I am loving these past few days! The planet that I grew up thinking was merely a spherical ice cube floating at the furthest reaches of who-knows-what, now has some texture, meaning, and definition! The progress that can be made in 20 years is un-freaking-believable!

Shame to hear it got scrubbed :/  Not only parallax, but interferometry allows to resolve details as if it were a ""telescope"" as big as the sepparation between the two farthest points (though you get a tiny fraction of the light gathering ability, that's why you need ""bright enough targets"").  Betelgeuse has been ""observed"" with interferomtry to great detail (link and paper), so there's nothing stoping us from observing planets this way -- if we find bright enough ones, that is! Actually, here are some simulations of the capabilities of very big interferometers on stars and exoplanets.  Edit: ATLAST is supossedly a successor to the HST and still in planned, I found TPF, but it doesn't say anything about Lagrange points (neither does SIM)."

space,3d93zt,Rintarou,3,Tue Jul 14 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"Well, actually we are observing planets this way. But the planet happens to be our own one, the Earth!  In microwave radiometry (observing earth in the microwave band, like 1GHz - 300GHz) it's a big challenge to get a good spacial resolutions, due to the huge wavelengths we are working with. We'd need ridiculously huge antennas if we wanted to have spacial resolutions below something like 100km. Thus interferometric techniques pose a chance to get a larger synthetic aperture without the antenna actually being that large.  So we just put a huge lot of antennas onto our spacecraft and through some interferometric Fourier transformation magic (we call it aperture synthesis) we get a really nice picture.  This technology is prominently being used on the SMOS-satellite. She can measure soil moisture as well as ocean salinity. Which is real nice and handy.  She's a beauty, isn't she? Look at all those tiny antennas! Another great shot IRL.  Source: studying electrical engineering happens to be interesting sometimes."

space,3d93zt,oltsu_alatar,3,Tue Jul 14 19:09:56 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is exposure times. Interferometer can to a certain extent solve the resolving power issue, but the surface area of the mirrors doesn't increase with the ""virtual diameter"" so the light collecting power doesn't either. An interferometer with a 200m ""diameter"" and the mirror surface are of hubble still only collects as much light as hubble, even though the resolution of the objects imaged is much higher. And thus you need longer exposures.  Planets rotate around their axis often quite fast and by the time you've used an interferometer to collect enough light from an exoplanet to form an image of it the planet has had time to rotate by a significant amount leaving you with a blur. The blurred image is still of course useful for spectroscopy etc. but it wont be a pretty picture like we see of pluto today."
space,3d93zt,OnNom,3,Wed Jul 15 00:31:12 2015 UTC,"You could figure out the planet's rotation rate and significantly cut down on the blur by only exposing to a small portion of the full rotation. Might take a while to figure out the rotation rate, though."

But maybe I'm misunderstanding something.   From the Ralph specs -    MVIC is composed of 7 independent CCD arrays on a single substrate. It uses two of its large format (5024x32 pixel) CCD arrays, operated in time delay integration (TDI) mode, to provide panchromatic (400 to 975 nm) images [ie black and white].  Four additional 5024x32 CCDs, combined with the appropriate filters and also operated in TDI mode, provide the capability of mapping in blue (400-550 nm), red (540-700 nm), near IR (780 - 975 nm) and narrow band methane (860 - 910 nm) [also infrared] channels."

You take the luma values from the black and white image, subtract the red and blue and that gives you the missing green segment which lets you generate the full color spectrum.   This is how a lot of video encoding works and how we were able to transition from black and white television to color with the signal working on both. Look up YCbCr if you want to learn more.  EDIT: Just noticed green is within that wavelength of the blue sensor with some crossover into the red (green is what, 500ish to 575ish I think?). Curious if the stuff I mentioned above still works. Going to pull out my digital encoding books and will get back to you.  EDIT EDIT: Yeah, all you need is luma, blue, and red as mentioned above. The green can be derived from subtraction and looking at the quantum efficiency chart (page 11) for MVIC the sensors seem to be designed with that in mind. Knowing the response lets them apply the conversions necessary to correct to a true color image."

space,3d93zt,thelazyreader2015,2,Tue Jul 14 18:24:52 2015 UTC,"Can anyone tell me why, before New Horizons, the best pics of Pluto we had were from Hubble? Aren't there many ground-based telescopes that are much bigger and have much better resolution than Hubble? How come we never used Keck or VLT to get images of Pluto and other Kuiper Belt objects?"
space,3d93zt,tenkendojo,10,Tue Jul 14 20:24:54 2015 UTC,"Short answer: because of Earth's atmosphere. The size/power of telescope is not the only factor contributing to image quality, other factors such as light pollution, atmosphere distortion etc. makes a lot of impact on our ability to see far too. Imagine trying to view Mt. Rainier from downtown Seattle... or Mt. Fuji from Tokyo, even during a clear day the mountain would look pretty hazy. That's why Hubble can product such clear pictures at a height where most of the earth's atmosphere are behind her... even with her messed up optics."
space,3d93zt,Thisisnotmyemail,2,Tue Jul 14 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"So basically no matter how big our observatories get(E-ELT, 30m Telescope etc) there really is no substitute for the likes of Hubble, and without it we won't be able to see that well into places like the outer solar system?"
space,3d93zt,OllieMarmot,3,Wed Jul 15 01:22:30 2015 UTC,"For clear, high-definition optical observations (especially visible light spectrum, but also for ultraviolet and infrared ranges), space telescope is pretty much the best option available. But not so much for radio telescopes...  That being said, even Hubble faces the problems of sunlight interference and trace amount of atmospheric distortion. The James Webb Space Telescope (to be launched 2018), however, will be one hell of a equipment! It sits on L2 Lagrange point, shaded from light of the sun, and way above any trace atmospheric interference!   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope#Orbit"
space,3d93zt,uncleawesome,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"It depends on a number of factors, including how big and far the thing you're looking at is, what wavelength light you're looking for, and how bright the target is.

space,3d93zt,thelazyreader2015,4,Tue Jul 14 19:52:34 2015 UTC,We have pictures from Earth but it just shows dots of the Pluto system. Hubble can linger on Pluto for a longer time to gather more light. Ground based telescopes have to take lots of pictures then subtract away the distortion caused by the atmosphere. http://www.gemini.edu/node/11893
space,3d93zt,iFloppyWaffles,2,Tue Jul 14 23:27:18 2015 UTC,I'm actually curious about this myself.  Recent versions of adaptive optics have enabled ground-based telescopes to exceed Hubble in resolution.  Direct imaging of Pluto seems like a good test for such systems.

Hubble has to track its targets too -- it just does so using reaction wheels instead of motors and gears.  It is true that the atmosphere poses a problem, since the distortion it introduces severely limits the resolution of ground-based telescopes (generally to 0.5-1.0 arcsec).  Modern adaptive optics systems can blow past this, though -- the newest ones can beat Hubble's resolution: http://www.gizmag.com/magao-adaptive-optics-highest-resolution-astronomical-images/28801/ -- magAO has made images at 0.03 arcsecond resolution (Hubble's best is 0.05 arcsecond)."

Each planet formed into it's own unique size, density, chemical properties, and they vary so much from one another. Each one really is unique and special unto itself, and there are so many planets in the universe it's incredible how many different worlds there are out there and incredible to imagine what they look like amongst our small little collection here, but there is something extroadinarily special about ours in that it was just the right combination to create life. All other planets are mere feigned attempts, still beautiful in their own right but for some reason our planet suceeded. Our ball of matter has stuff growing on it. Little sentient creatures walking around, talking to one another on it. Building boats and trains and cars, meeting each other for lunch and saying hello, and yet there are so many other planets out there with none of that at all.   I know at this point it's kind of cliche to talk about how special we really are, but we kind of are. Like, if you looked at all the other planets and didn't even know about Earth you'd say to yourself, yeah okay these are just a bunch of huge clumps of matter that each have their own inuqe size, density.. but you would never thing that from something like a planet that LIFE could exist! Like, what the fuck is life?? Life's kind of a bizarre and strange occurance in such a cold dead place. Life is so weird when you hold it up next to a planet. They're so different and strange they almost contradict one another. Yet here we are, the most unexpected thing to sprout from the universe is here, growing and attempting to leave to explore the unknown.   I think the universe wants us here.

To think that we have such accurate knowledge of the planets' masses because we dropped some things here on Earth, measured how fast they fell, used that to determine the mass of Earth, and then looked at how far away the Earth is from the Sun, used that to determine the mass of the Sun, and then looked at the other planets and how far away they are from the Sun, and used that to determine their mass...

Looking into it a bit more, it's far more complex than that, mostly in terms of looking at how the planet and its moons (if any) interact, as well as how the planets subtly interact with each other's gravity fields.  More to the credit of the astronomers though, those calculations require very precise measurements of the positions of the planets, in order to get the info you need to start calculating masses based on how the planets vary from their predicted orbits in a ideal two-body solution."

Of course subtracting these two times together, you get 72 seconds. The ""accuracy"" statement was due to uncertainty; due to the uncertainty range, there's a worst-case possibility (1-sigma) that the spacecraft would arrive 109 seconds early, which is basically 2 minutes.

space,3d8yoa,Whip8,44,Tue Jul 14 21:40:36 2015 UTC,"Along the track of the orbit, it is very difficult to determine time and place (Lyaponov unstable). This stems from the fact that the equations of these orbits are non-linear differential. If you want to make such a prediction, the corrections will be less of a problem than the unstability. Since the orbit is unstable along-track, the resulting problem is that you know where the satellite is going to be, but not when.   When approximating the non-linear equation, a common approach is deconstructing the (set of) equation(s) in two time definitions (long and short time). The long time is likely used in the first estimations and design. Although these will be in the correct direction, this will not be accurate. During the mission, the short approximation is used. The precision stated here would suggest a short time approximation. I think this is done in the past month or so.

Back in 2003, the closest approach time was on July 14 around 12:20:00 UTC In 2005, it was 11:58:59 UTC. This number stuck around for a while until the navigators started doing their orbit determination work. Since then, they've been constantly correcting this time. I think they've done about 100, or more, orbit determination deliveries in the past few years. So the arrival time has changed, rather slightly, about 100 times.   NASA didn't publish the 11:49:57 UTC prediction until their flyby press kit for July 2015. Only a 10 minute difference in an estimate made a decade ago, not bad.

space,3d8yoa,Zorbick,11,Tue Jul 14 22:10:07 2015 UTC,"When I say precisely I mean analytically, so that it preserves all the original functions and integrals.  What happens above n=2 is that you have integrals and functions that can't be ""solved"" without numerical approximation, like with Taylor series approximations.  Really it boils down to a lack of cancelling terms and equations versus unknowns.  For n=3 you can make some assumptions and get some extra unknowns out that let you solve the integrals precisely, but that's a very specific special case.  So we approximate and lose some higher order terms - that really only effect those places way to the right of the decimal -  that we can slowly backfill as our computers get more advanced and capable of running them.  We solve the n-body problems just fine, it's just only as precise as the number of terms our computers can handle.

The motion of three bodies is generally non-repeating, except in special cases."" The amount of problems you can even solve to the analytical solution standard is very small.

space,3dbem2,SinglesRazor,2,Wed Jul 15 14:29:19 2015 UTC,Forgive me as I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to this sub. Why is the Sun that colour in that photo and not the yellowish colour you'd expect?
space,3dbem2,SinglesRazor,2,Wed Jul 15 16:12:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look yellow because it isn't in the visible spectrum. It's an extreme ultraviolet image, which is where the sun's corona emits light.  As an aside, the sun isn't actually yellow. It looks yellow to us because the atmosphere absorbs and bends the light, which also causes it to look redder at sunset and sunrise as the light has to travel through more air.  The sun acts like a black body: rather than getting it's colour from reflecting light it emits light like a block of metal that's been heated until it glows. Black bodies emit radiation (light) depending on their temperature, with cooler objects being more active in the red and infrared and warmer objects shifting towards blue and ultraviolet and you end up with a spectrum like this. The sun is around 6000 K, so it peaks around the green part of the spectrum, but the mix of all the colours makes it appear white."

space,3dgyyh,DannyBoy7783,2,Thu Jul 16 04:51:24 2015 UTC,Maybe nothing necessarily new but I bet there have been some huge improvements in signal-to-noise ratio reduction bearing in mind the huge distance NH is beaming data back from.  This will in turn trickle down into cellular technology and god knows what else.  Interesting fact is that the technology that allowed Houston to communicate with the Apollo missions all the way over at the moon led to the development of MRI imaging.  The faint radio signals received from the Command Module back at earth were akin to the faint radio signals given off by Hydrogen atoms held in a magnetic field and bombarded with microwaves.  Cool eh?  A recent mission called LADEE tested laser based communication to and from the moon which should allow much better bandwidth in deep space missions and could result in more secure and efficient wireless communication here on Earth due to the tight beams being used.

If you're following the various New Horizons accounts on Twitter you'll start to get pictures after 9pm tonight, but the good ones won't come out until tomorrow.    I've been following this closely because I'm kind of a space nerd, and some of the details are amazing.  It's transmitting a huge amount of data over a 3 billion mile distance using an antenna that radiates only 12 Watts.  The data takes almost four hours to get back.

A lot of that would probably then rain back down to Earth over the next few million years as it intersected Earth's orbit.    Basically we'd all be dead.  But at least it would be quick.

Our best hope would be to leave the planet, and either find a new one or survive for centuries aboard a self-sustaining space station. And preferably we would be some distance from the dangerous materials being ejected from the Earth, maybe orbiting a planet nearer to the sun to take advantage of the improved solar energy output.  An impact like this tears apart the crust so violently that it actually causes pieces of it to eject into space. Think about that. Right now the worst thing the crust does is slightly move above or below itself naturally along faultlines. And even that--earthquakes as we know them--can crumble our civilizations. If anything, underground is the most dangerous place to be during a quake. Everything above you is coming down. Everything below you is shifting and either cracking or erupting. That kind of event would result in the kind of earthquake that is simply unspeakable. Even if you survived the heat (vacuum-sealed mole people city?), and managed to keep the necessary supplies on hand (water, food, maybe nuclear power to keep the lights on?), the quake(s) alone would be enough to turn you into jelly. Basically you'd be thrust into the walls, floor, and ceiling repeatedly with unbelievable force, breaking... you. All of you. I mean, this would affect the movement of the entire globe.

They reflect the distinctions that we find meaningful.  But these distinctions can also shape our perceptions and values.  If we pretend that these rules are inherent truths of the universe and we forget that they are man-made abstractions, they can become difficult to change.  Our values and perceptions can stagnate.    In certain contexts it is useful to understand that Pluto is officially recognized as a dwarf planet, trans-Neptunian object, or Kuiper belt object, and that you are expected to communicate with others using the official set of arbitrary rules for the sake of clarity.   Outside of those contexts, Pluto is a whatever makes you happy.  Pluto is a planet if you believe it is a planet.

space,3d8dfs,sweetgreggo,8,Tue Jul 14 12:24:04 2015 UTC,"Changing it from a planet is just formalizing historical precedent. When we first discovered asteroids we called them planets. Then, when we discovered there were many similar sized objects on the same orbit, the term asteroid eventually replaced planet. In the 90s we started discovering many other objects, some approaching Pluto in size, and one, Eris, that was more massive. So, analogously to the asteroids, we reclassified Pluto. Pluto's mass, as a percentage of objects in its orbital region is many times smaller than any of the planets."

It's failing to realize that science isn't about culture, or popular opinion, or anything else other than the facts.

space,3djalk,BlackWidower_NP,2,Fri Jul 17 02:58:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Pluto gets all the attention because it was discovered just in time to be taught in schools as a planet, but by those standard if we call Pluto a planet Ceres should be too. The only reason Ceres is neglected in the debate it's because there was no widespread education during its heyday, so no mass cultural brainwashing on what's a planet and what isn't.

You see the great thing about science, is that it changes as we learn new things. And we've since learned new things, not only about Pluto, but about the solar system as a whole, which meant we had to recategorize Pluto. It's now a dwarf-planet. It changed. That's a good thing.

As a result, Pluto doesn't fit the definition. Instead, they gave it it's own category. Pluto's a trailblazer, mate! The first Dwarf-planet we've ever discovered! Brilliant!  The thing is, people think saying 'Pluto's not a planet' somehow devalues Pluto. It doesn't. There's still some good science on there, and it is still interesting. It's just not a planet.

Neptune and Pluto's orbits do cross, but they're never physically near each other. If they were, Neptune would definitely clear Pluto out of its neighbourhood. Who knows, that might actually happen some day. Hopefully, at that stage, we can drop this issue.  And the Trojans... yeah, the thing about the Trojans is that they're still affected by Jupiter, and moved out of the way, further along the orbit, by virtue of them being nestled in the L4 and L5 points.

space,3da9fo,MarcAlain,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"Basically, at some time in it's history, the internal pressure from self-gravity exceeds the strength of the internal materials.  Roughly this happens at 600-1000 km diameter, but it depends on the history and composition.  The Solar Nebula out of which the Sun and rest of the Solar System formed was part of a stellar cluster, and one or more supernovae supplied radioactive Aluminum-26.  This has a short decay life and generates a lot of heat.  A large enough object would retain the heat and reach the melting point.  Gravity would then make it round.  Another way to create a lot of heat is by collisions.  Outer system objects have a lot of water/ice, and it doesn't take much impact heating to melt it.  Again, gravity would make it round.  A third way is tidal forces, like Jupiter does to the moon Io (the right image is in the infrared).  These forces create internal friction, which heats the body.  In Io's case, it has multiple volcanoes.  Even if the body doesn't reach the melting point, self-gravity can crush mountains and irregular shapes when the weight of the high points exceeds the strength of the rock underneath.  Those high points will crush and flow the interior material, and level themselves out."

space,3da9fo,parahillObjective,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:11:32 2015 UTC,"It depends on the size, with the right material, probably, but nothing that any real planet will be made of.  Basically, a planet is made of some material that is X strong, as you add material it gets n2 stronger, but the mass goes up by n3 (n is how many times you increased the diameter, its the factor). Since gravity is proportional to mass, and gravity applies a force to objects, as you add size gravity increases faster than strength and eventually wins. When it wins it pulls everything down until there is no more down (its a sphere).  The exact point that this happens is dependent on the strength of the material, stronger materials will support a larger less spherical object. So if your planet was made out of pure titanium it could be quite large before getting crushed into a sphere, I don't if titanium is strong enough for an earth sized object or if you need something stronger, but with a sufficiently strong material it should work.  Also, it can't be arbitrary large, eventually gravity beats out on the nuclear forces and makes it a star or black hole."

You can still say Ceres is a dwarf planet that is the largest asteroid.  From Wikipedia:   Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt.[11] It is sometimes assumed that Ceres has been reclassified as a dwarf planet, and that it is therefore no longer considered an asteroid. For example, a news update at Space.com spoke of ""Pallas, the largest asteroid, and Ceres, the dwarf planet formerly classified as an asteroid"",[51] whereas an IAU question-and-answer posting states, ""Ceres is (or now we can say it was) the largest asteroid"", though it then speaks of ""other asteroids"" crossing Ceres's path and otherwise implies that Ceres is still considered an asteroid.[52] The Minor Planet Center notes that such bodies may have dual designations.[53] The 2006 IAU decision that classified Ceres as a dwarf planet never addressed whether it is or is not an asteroid. Indeed, the IAU has never defined the word 'asteroid' at all, having preferred the term 'minor planet' until 2006, and preferring the terms 'small Solar System body' and 'dwarf planet' after 2006. Lang (2011) comments ""the [IAU has] added a new designation to Ceres, classifying it as a dwarf planet. ... By [its] definition, Eris, Haumea, Makemake and Pluto, as well as the largest asteroid, 1 Ceres, are all dwarf planets"", and describes it elsewhere as ""the dwarf planet–asteroid 1 Ceres"".[54] NASA continues to refer to Ceres as an asteroid,[55] as do various academic textbooks.[56][57]   All this terminology is quite a mess at the moment, a side effect of our ever-changing view of the Solar System as we discover more and more."

But please, by all means, keep using the antiquated terminology and maybe it will forever remain known as an asteroid rather than a dwarf planet and pluto can go back to being a full fledged planet rather than the newly classified dwarf planet.   Edit: ""Neither of your links say anything about Ceres not also being an asteroid"" Why would it state that? We describe something as what it is, not what it is not.

So now i have shown NASA to call it a dwarf planet and also the IAU, what is your next excuse to keep calling it what it was formally called/known as. Asteroids do not conform to a round shape but dwarf planets are objects with enough self gravity to pull themselves into a rounded shape.

It didn't stop being an asteroid when they started calling it a dwarf planet. NASA and all manner of professional astronomers call it an asteroid all the time. There are half a dozen references for this on wikipedia, but the links are dead. The IAU has never formally classified what an asteroid is - it's a more casual term.   This is kind of like how Pluto is classified as both a dwarf planet and a Kuiper Belt Object. It's in the Kuiper belt, therefore it is a Kuiper belt object. It is also a dwarf planet. It doesn't have to be one or the other."

I guess everyone around here still refers to pluto as one of the 9 planets rather than a dwarf planet. It is really simple, Ceres was originally classified a planet, then it was classified an asteroid, now since we have a new classifications of object, it is a dwarf planet. As we discover new information, we adapt to the new information."
space,3da9fo,jawsgst,3,Wed Jul 15 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"But you're imposing your own imaginary rules here. There is nothing that says Ceres can't be both a dwarf planet AND an asteroid. It is, and that's what everyone is trying to tell you."

But if they do, that doesn't make them not an asteroid. In fact, the term ""asteroid"" doesn't currently have a strict definition.  In a broader sense, though, what we're all trying to tell you is that the thousands and thousands of solar system objects we've discovered don't all fit neatly into well defined categories.  Many categories overlap, and many have excuses to their own rules.  (And most of those rules are still hotly debated.)  So just ease up a little on the idea that Ceres can't be both a dwarf planet and an asteroid.  Although its hydrostatic equilibrium nominates it for inclusion among spherical non-moon bodies that haven't cleared their orbital neighborhoods, its orbit, composition, formation, and tidal interactions make it much more at home among the rest of the asteroids.  The fact that it's likely to be the only dwarf planet that's not a Trans-Neptunian Object means that it will never really fit in with the rest, anyways."
space,3da9fo,BeatDigger,2,Wed Jul 15 05:11:43 2015 UTC,"Your link mentions nowhere that ""asteroid"" and ""dwarf planet"" are mutually exclusive. I agree there perhaps should be a definition that separates the two, but currently both terms can be used for the same object."

Tens of thousands of these minor planets are gathered in the main asteroid belt, a vast doughnut-shaped ring between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids that pass close to Earth are called near-earth objects."" How exactly does Ceres have ""different properties than an asteroid""?  I'm not saying that it's a dwarf planet rather than an asteroid, I'm saying that it's both (and so is NASA).   Edit: ""Neither of your links say anything about Ceres not also being an asteroid"" Why would it state that? We describe something as what it is, not what it is not.   We both agree that it's a dwarf planet. However, you're insisting that this means that it can't also be an asteroid, but the problem is that your links don't support your argument. Just because they didn't explicitly state that it's an asteroid in those links doesn't mean that it's not an asteroid.   I would not call my Nissan Altima ""not a honda accord"" if it were worthwhile to also mention it was considered an asteroid, they would probably include that, as it is not there, we assume by natural order of things, that it is only a dwarf planet.   You also wouldn't necessarily clarify that your Nissan Altima is a car. But I'd be using bad logic if I said that the fact that you didn't find this information ""worthwhile"" means that it must not be a car. In either case, NASA evidently did find it worthwhile to mention that Ceres is an asteroid, as I pointed out in my link. I feel silly reposting the quote again, but as you can see, it straight up says that Ceres is ""the first and largest asteroid to be discovered"" and imo more importantly that it ""encompasses over one-third of the estimated total mass of all the asteroids in the asteroid belt.""  It can't encompass any fraction of the total mass of all the asteroids in the asteroid belt if it's not an asteroid."

space,3d8iai,Feriluce,2,Tue Jul 14 22:45:45 2015 UTC,Not particularly simple :)  It's just that the deterministic feature allows prediction in a way we don't get in other parts of life due to their statistical nature.

space,3d8iai,dazblazem,2,Tue Jul 14 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Actually no. Quantum mechanics is fundamentally non-deterministic. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for examples states that the more precise a particles position, the less precise its momentum, and visa-versa."
space,3d8iai,jwikked,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:34:06 2015 UTC,I see. That is pretty interesting. Does that also mean that we cannot predict macroscopic processes with a pretty good degree of certainty?
space,3d8iai,goobly_goo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"Not particularly. For example, the fundamental uncertainty is σ_x σ_p ≥ h/(4π) where h is 6.6 × 10-34 J s and σ is the standard deviation (the uncertainty) of position and momentum respectively.   So its not a very big effect at all. For the most part it doesn't have an effect on whether a system is practically deterministic unless the system is  sensitive to the states of individual particles. But you can construct systems so that quantum mechanics does change the nature of the system, the classic one being Schroedinger's cat.   I'm now wondering if classically chaotic systems (eg. A double pendulum) is truly nondeterministic because its so sensitive to initial conditions that the uncertainty principle is significant. I don't know."

How does its atmosphere work? Is there water ice on Pluto's frozen surface? And so on.    For some perspective, the actual radius of the solar system is believed to be 5000AU(5000 times the distance from the Sun to the Earth) which is where the Oort cloud terminates.

space,3dhdb1,Eipifi,6,Thu Jul 16 07:52:55 2015 UTC,"NASA estimates that interstellar space begins at ~1.8x1010 km (~120 AU) from the Sun. New Horizons travels at about 3.2 AU/year, and is currently ~33  AU from the Sun. Assuming constant velocity, it will reach interstellar space in ~27 years.  EDIT: fixed links"
space,3dhdb1,Eipifi,3,Thu Jul 16 08:02:31 2015 UTC,Why'd it slow down from leaving earth? Shouldn't they want it to go as fast as possible? More importantly how did it slow down if all it is a giant camera.
space,3dhdb1,Rooksu,8,Thu Jul 16 08:14:23 2015 UTC,"Oh boy.   Newton's first law, shortened: ""a body in motion stays in motion"". We fire the engines once, at the start - the spacecraft simply continues to go in the direction we pointed it in. We made a slingshot maneuver near Jupiter, but it doesn't matter here. We do not have enough fuel to fire the engines constantly, though - we'd need more fuel to carry more fuel, and so on. Read here about the rocket equation.  And why it slows down? Because of the Sun's gravitational pull. It keeps slowing down the spacecraft, but not enough to stop it altogether. It's called the escape velocity.  I hope you find it helpful :)"

space,3dhdb1,almightyjew,6,Thu Jul 16 08:22:13 2015 UTC,"Good question.  We talked about it a bit on here.  But basically the probe is travelling at 14km/s relative to Pluto so if it was to use Pluto's atmosphere as a break brake it would need to have a very substantial heat shield, adding a lot of weight and therefore requiring a bigger rocket.  There is also the question of whether, at that speed, there is enough of Pluto's atmosphere to slow the probe down before it zips past.  Lastly, we don't really know a huge amount about it's atmosphere until NH gives us more data, so it would be a huge risk hoping that it could be used for aerobraking."
space,3dhdb1,mushroomwig,4,Thu Jul 16 08:35:43 2015 UTC,"Good thinking. This maneuver is called aerobreaking. Pluto's atmosphere is however too thin to stop the spacecraft in any meaningful way.

No, the models are correct, you just misunderstand the models (or are ignorant of them). Our models show that everything in an orbital system orbits the center of mass of that system. We call this center of mass, the barycenter. In a single star system like ours, the barycenter almost always lies within the star. Thus, the planets orbit the star. But this isn't always the case.   Let me ask you a question;  When 2 large stars of equal mass are orbiting one another, which one is the ""main"" one? Which one is the center? There isn't one. Both stars orbit a point between each other. This point is called the barycenter. Every orbital system has one. Including our solar system.  If you look at the image in the link, you'll see that most of the time, our solar system's barycenter lies within the sun. But not always. In the 90s and 80s, it existed outside of the sun and during that point, we weren't orbiting the sun, but a spot just outside the sun.   Hell, the wikipedia page on ""Barycenter"" explains this perfectly, and even uses our sun as an example."

It is although very complicated for more objects orbiting, as the barycenter is different for every single object if you want to compare the planet to the barycenter of all other objects.   I know though that the barycenter of our solar system is often outside of the sun since jupiter has a rather high mass."

space,3d90w6,ocshoes,5,Tue Jul 14 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"The IAU has three criteria for planethood:    is in orbit around the Sun, has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape), and has ""cleared the neighbourhood"" around its orbit.    The third criteria is the controversial one. For one, it's not clear when you have sufficiently cleared the neighborhood around your orbit. There are very small asteroids that Earth hasn't cleared from its orbit,  Neptune hasn't cleared Pluto from its nearby orbit, etc.   Putting that aside, the other problem with the definition in my opinion is that your ability to clear the neighborhood of debris is partly a function of how far the orbit is from the sun, i.e. how much space the debris is spread over. Pluto has a much tougher task than Earth, and Earth has a much tougher task than Mercury, and so forth. In other words, put the same giant spherical rock in different orbits around the sun and you might get different outcomes as far as whether that body is a ""planet"" or not. Now, I get why orbiting a star might be a valid criteria for planethood (although that criteria would exclude rogue planets traveling between stars), but why should the distance of that orbit matter at all? Seems silly. Better to have a very broad and generic definition of planet, and define species from there."

space,3d90w6,NotTheHead,6,Wed Jul 15 10:23:50 2015 UTC,"The definition of clearing the neighborhood does not include objects that are gravitationally dominated by the planet in question. Jupiter's Trojans, Greeks, and moons don't make it any less of a planet because their location is caused by Jupiter's gravity, they are not there in spite of it. The definition of clearing the neighborhood also does not include objects that have been excluded from gravitational interaction by exceptionally long periods or resonant orbits, such as Neptune's lack of interaction with Pluto because of its 2:3 orbital resonance.   There is a number, the Stern-Levison Parameter, used to quantify how gravitationally dominant a body is on its orbital neighborhood. This number for Pluto is five orders of magnitude lower than the lowest planet (Mars) and 12 orders of magnitude lower than Jupiter.  The ""clearing the neighborhood"" criteria could be better presented in layman terms as: ""The planet does not exist as a belt or system of similar objects."" Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered but when it was found to exist as part of a belt of similar objects it was reclassified as a member of that group (asteroids). This was in the 1800s so you really can't argue that the clear neighborhood criteria isn't a part of the traditional definition of a planet."

The IAU didn't want our solar system to have 11+ planets, so they created a definition to exclude Pluto and other objects like Eris.  That's why the IAU definition only applies to our solar system and not extrasolar planets. It was made up to cap the number of solar planets with a completely arbitrary definition.   If we applied the nebulous ""cleared the neighborhood"" standard everywhere, we'd ultimately end up with things like double planets not being labeled as planets at all.

However, at some point far in the future the Moon will have moved far enough away that that will no longer be the case for the Earth-Moon system.  Given our that logic we'd have good reason to call the Earth and the Moon binary planets at that point.  It's mostly a philosophical point though.  The origin of the human race is closer to us in time than that event.  If we're still around then we won't be using anything recognizable as English anymore, so the problem will be moot.

space,3ddrla,shash747,6,Wed Jul 15 14:02:56 2015 UTC,"First you need a moon with sufficient mass and proximity to its planet which, for tidal locking, is most moons. Some distant rocks that orbit gas giants aren't tidally locked either.  When you have a sufficiently large moon, tidal forces start to come into play. Tidal force is where the gravitational force of one object on the other isn't uniformly distributed. So, in the Earth-Moon system, the oceans nearest the moon have a greater force exerted on them then those on the other side of Earth, leading to high tides (and the term tidal). Whilst it may seem that this should cause low tides on the opposite side to the moon, it causes high tides too due to the inertia. The Sun also plays a minor role in all of this.  The Moon obviously has no water to have tides, but it does experience Moonquakes because of the Earth's pull on it being non-uniform.   At some point in the past, the Moons rotation on its axis, a Moonday, would've been significantly shorter than its orbit around the Earth, a Moonyear. But as it rotates around the Earth, Earth's gravity pulls on the Moon's nearest point (which bulges slightly due to tidal forces), dragging it backwards, shifting it's rotation just a little. And this occurs every rotation of the Moon. Eventually, over sufficient number of years (many years), the rotation of the Moon on its axis slows down enough to match the orbit around the Earth; the Moon has now become tidally locked to the Earth.  And this is almost certainly happened to the rest of the major moons in the solar system. They formed around their parent planet with greater rotation on their axis, and were slowed down by repeated pulls of their parent planet's gravity. We just happen to live in a time when this has happened.  Interestingly, presuming the Earth survives, in the far future it will become tidally locked to the moon, always presenting the same face to it."
space,3ddrla,Draxton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:31:16 2015 UTC,"What forces balance at the point of tidal locking? I may not have understood this fully - but shouldn't this extra gravitational pull slow down the moon further? The parts of the moon nearest to the earth would still feel an extra pull on every rotation, right?"
space,3ddrla,Draxton,3,Wed Jul 15 18:00:46 2015 UTC,"You may have heard of the 'leap second' we sometimes add on to the length of the day. This is due to the Earth's rotation slowing down, creating longer days. Which is due to the influence of the Moon and another aspect of tidal forces.  The interaction of forces between the Moon and Earth creates friction, a form of energy. In the early Earth-Moon system, this energy was converted into geophysical changes, the slight bulges on both bodies, but at a cost of losing kinetic energy, the moon's rotation was being slowed by the Earth's pull. In our time, the Moon is tidally locked because that's the most energy efficient situation to be in, the Moon has no more spin to give up,  its bulges are always aligned with Earth's pull, presenting the same face. It still feels the pull (causing Moonquakes), but it can no longer provide any energy to affect its rotation.  A side effect of this is that, the Moon is getting further away whilst slowing the Earth's rotation; it's essentially stealing Earth's angular momentum. Or a better way would be to say the Earth is giving it momentum by converting its own kinetic energy. This in turn creates a larger orbit for the Moon whilst lowering the speed of Earth's rotation (leading to us needing that Leap Second).  The opposite can be seen in the Mars-Phobos system. Phobos orbits Mars much quicker than Mars rotates, so the bulge it raises in Mars lags behind the little moon, causing Mars to gain momentum (and speed up fractionally) and Phobos to lose it (and orbit closer to Mars). Eventually, probably in around 100 million years, Phobos will either impact Mars or break up. Mars-Deimos is also interesting in that it's both small enough and far enough away that Mars may eventually lose it."

I imagine this happens because mass isn't evenly distributed inside both bodies. If it were, I could only think magnetism could have some effect in this, but otherwise they wouldn't lock. I'm sure this is better explained in an wikipedia article or something."
space,3ddrla,browsermostly,2,Wed Jul 15 14:52:39 2015 UTC,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking   The change in rotation rate necessary to tidally lock a body B to a larger body A is caused by the torque applied by A's gravity on bulges it has induced on B by tidal forces.   The larger body's gravity causes bulges to form on the smaller body which produce torque.  This effect can both speed up or slow down the smaller body's rotation and orbit in order to produce tidal locking.  The same thing happens to the larger body just not as much as the tidal forces are weaker.  It's basically the natural state for two objects orbiting each-other. The only exception being if the orbital distance is too great for tidal effects or the orbit is too eccentric e.g. Mercury & the sun  It is assumed that close Binary Stars are all tidally locked.

Hubble is an amazing telescope that has given us insight into the most distant parts of our universe but it was designed to see far away things and not objects that are close by.

It's just not a very common observing target, especially now that we've got the LRO mapping it at much higher resolutions than Hubble is capable of.  Hubble isn't far-sighted.  The issue is simply with the angular size of the flag from the Earth.  It's tiny.  Much, much smaller than Pluto appears to Hubble, and much, much smaller again than the galaxies and nebulae Hubble regularly images."
space,3dghz7,crapsoda13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:52:38 2015 UTC,Well I may have just been think of when Hubble almost failed because of an imperfection in the mirror (yes I know it caused the telescope to become near sited if anything but what ever) but I'm not refuting that it could not see the flag on the moon. However in the most extreme cases of galaxy observation ie. the farthest known galaxies would their angular size still big larger than that of the flag? Given that the farthest known galaxies we know of were present just a few million years after the universe formed they could not have been more than a few tens or hundreds of light years large. So being that they are billions of light years away and only being maybe a few hundred light years large would their angular size not be similar if not smaller than that of the flag?  This is a very extreme circumstance though.

A galaxy 10,000 light-years across at 10 billion light-years away has a ratio of 1:1,000,000.  Also, when looking at faraway galaxies, seeing them as points of light less than a pixel wide is fine since we can get a lot of data from their light even with no detail."
space,3dghz7,crapsoda13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:18:44 2015 UTC,I just finished my first year as a physics student with a minor in astronomy and I know how important just the smallest spec of light is but honestly the way my university works with pre-reqs is fucked so I've yet to really cut my teeth with the good physics and astronomy. So really I'm asking out of curiosity since I know one day I will have to learn these things and unfortunately the way the schooling system works here in America kinda is at fault as to why I have yet to learn these things. However in 2013 it was published that  there was an object that Hubble had observed that was at least to date the most distant galaxy. It was a galaxy that had formed just over 700 million years after the Big Bang so I don't see how such a young Galaxy could possibly be as large and have as many stars as you said above.

If you look at the universe's existence and compact it into a calendar year 700 million years would be less than 3 weeks. Our galaxy formed in May.

The answer is - if Hubble is able to physically resolve the galaxy, yeah, it's got a larger angular size than the Apollo flag.  But the very most distant (and youngest) galaxies in these images aren't resolved, Hubble is essentially just seeing them as a point source (much like stars).  In these cases, the angular size of the objects are much smaller than Hubble can resolve.    And for comparison, at the scale shown in that image, Pluto is only a few pixels large."

There's no way that they can shield any sort of ship against the bombardment of cosmic rays, currently. So any sort of mission to an extraterrestrial object would just fry the astronauts with radiation and kill the astronauts on board.  I think we'll get there eventually, but not in our lifetimes, we'll get to see the first serious attempts at colonizing the solar system and the beginning of space infrastructure but I doubt that we will get to see humanity leave the solar system."

Most of us were not around when Ranger crashed into the Moon, transmitting back TV live to the scientists at JPL (and also to channel 5 in LA). Most of us were not here when the Mariner, Pioneer, Viking, and Voyager missions sent their pictures from Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. For the last time, here it is live, the first close-up reconnaissance of our Solar System's last planet.  I am firmly of the belief that Pluto will once again be declared an official planet, after this flyby. ""Planet"" is as much a cultural label as a scientific one, and Pluto got demoted because there was no clear way to distinguish it from the other KBOs. That is no longer the case.  We have seen that Pluto has enough of an atmosphere to weather and reshape the surface. This should be the third characteristic that defines a planet, not, ""clears its orbit."" The fact that Pluto is a double planet should not be a limiting factor. There is little doubt that double planets exist in other solar systems, just as there are double stars; why shouldn't we have a double planet also?  I know writing this message may doom this post to obscurity. Some people are so tired of the ""Pluto is a planet"" debate, they will doewnvote out of sheer irritation.

Relays are currently used on Mars. The Mars landers can communicate with Earth directly using a high-gain antenna, or they may communicate in a more energy-efficient manner with an orbiter (Mars Odyssey or the Mars Global Surveyor) which then relays the signal on.

There would always be a path from station to station to Earth.  First of all it's a huge expense! A massive, massive expense.   Second, you have introduced two new points of failure. (Presumably your probe no longer has the ability to communicate with Earth by itself.)  Third, unless your probe is very close to the relay stations, it still needs a high-gain directional antenna. Those are already capable of communication with Earth, so there's no benefit. You'd need to find a way to build a slightly-less-powerful antenna for a lot less money, and even then, it would probably take longer than the entire future history of NASA to recoup that initial investment."

I'd guess that relay stations will be necessary infrastructure for future interstellar probes, but even that would only be the case if the massive cost of launching a relay station to a midway point (maybe 2 light years out!) was less than the cost of sending a bigger/better transmitter on the probe itself.  The biggest point apart from cost is that you're just adding more points of failure to the chain. If your new probe depends on the chain of past probes all working properly, your space program could be in for a bad time."

Uranus has a magnetic field and despite its distance, the Solar Wind still has an appreciable affect. Most of our understanding of planetary magnetic fields come from the Earth, Jupiter and Saturn who all have similar orientations (their poles are almost at right angle to Uranus/Ecliptic).   Thus Uranus' relationship with its magnetic field and how then it interacts with the Solar Wind is different enough compared to those that we've studied to warrant further study.  Some of my colleagues believed that Uranus has Aurora, which due to the Uranian environment would be an interesting study into how Aurora form due to different circumstances (such as with Jupiter's Aurora is significantly affected by its moon Io). I personally worked on the best observational data  (in context) of Uranus in search of an auroral signature but sadly found that while there was a hint of a signature, it wasn't conclusive proof and the observational data was still not good enough."

space,3daztw,uncleleo_hello,2,Wed Jul 15 13:05:14 2015 UTC,"""At what point does it become too much and it starts doing us more harm than good?"".  I would say it was when we literally divided up the entire planet and assigned certain parts of our military to watch over these sections.   That's how large our military is. The US whether we like it or not is the worlds police. You may not agree with the US foreign policy, you may not like the US, but tough shit basically. Their is literally no nation on this planet that could stand against the US(leaving nukes out).   This is where it hurts us. When someone starts acting up in the world everyone cries for the US to get involved. We are in two positions, let people cry about how the US intervenes in everything, or how about the US just sat by and let that happen.   It also hurts us economically. Our defense budget is #1, you could take the countries from #2 all the way to #15 add them all up and just barely reach the US spending.   And a lot of that money is wasted. Every couple of months you will hear about how the Pentagon cannot account for a couple billion here, a couple billion there. The Pentagon was literally telling Congress a while ago how they did not need any more tanks, that any additional funding for tanks would be a waste. A military organization was saying no to more tanks, it's safe to say we don't need anymore then. Congress voted to give them more money for tanks anyways.   Every hear about of government agencies do their budgets? Let's say your office is budgeted for $50k a year. Well one year you find yourself operating at $40k and will have $10k left over, that's great right? NO!. You work off of a spend it or loose it system. Say you do only use $40k this year, well next year you will only be budgeted $40k instead of $50k like before. So what do you do? You spend every single penny you get, you buy more pens, more ink, new computers, chairs, whatever to get rid of that last $10k.   Unfortunately that's not only limited to our military, thats most government agencies, schools, hospitals, businesses, etc...   In reality, we could probably do so much more with so much less. Cut our military forces world wide, close down bases here at home. Cut some programs, decommission outdated equipment, stop buying new equipment we don't need, and the biggest thing is better accounting.   So we could either cut all this spending and possibly start running a surplus again, or we could move it into NASA and other space related research. NASA already does so much with so little, let's give them a chance to show us what they can do with a lot. Last time we put man on the moon."

There's really no winning for the US, people will hate them no matter what they do or don't do. Spending is absurd, we're funding programs that are not necessary or practical. Don't even fucking get me started on the F35. That project cost almost $400 billion. That's nearly NASA's total funding ever of just over 500 billion. Literally fuck the F35.

space,3dc1g9,hls99,2,Thu Jul 16 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm neither an expert but I'm going to try to answer it:   but how does the gas all get contained in a ball shape that sticks in that shape?   The core of the planet has a very high gravity, so it pulls all the gas  around it. Actually, because of Jupiter's rotation, the gas is pulled towards the equator, and for that reason, is less round than the Earth.   How did it form?    Just like all the other planets, when the Solar System was formed, there was dust and gas floating everywhere. Because of gravity, some particles started to form the sun. Once the sun was formed, the remaining matter started to form planets. Solar wind swept out the gases like hydrogen, so only rock was available to form the planets. However, in greater distances, solar wind wasn't so relevant, so lighter particles, like gas, started to be attracted by the existing planetary cores, forming Jupiter. This applies to all gas giants.   Are some gasses just really heavy and stay in the middle while light ones swirl on the outside?    When Jupiter formed, the most dense matter sank further down into the planet, while the least dense and lighter gases remained in the surface.   Another comment mention winds, so does one gas float and get the pushed around on the surface?   In the exterior of Jupiter there are two types of bands parallel to the equator. There are two types of bands, the lighter ones, almost white (zones), and relatively dark ones (belts). Zones are lighter because they contain more ammonia, while belts are thinner and found in lower altitudes. The winds are really atmospheric flows, or ""jets"". I'm not going to go into further detail, but the Wikipedia article for Jupiter's Atmosphere is quite extensive, in case you want to learn more. The result is that the jets make the wind in zones cyclonic, meanwhile in belts is anticyclonic as seen here   And because it's made of multiple gasses (right?) are they still being formed or is the atmosphere/composition of planet (technically same thing for a ball of gas?) ?   The main element forming Jupiter is hydrogen, around 90% of it's atoms are hydrogen, around 10% of helium, and a little bit of other elements. Deeper into Jupiter, the pressure makes hydrogen a liquid, and even deeper, the pressure is so high (around 20 million bar in the core) that the hydrogen starts to behave like a metal.  BTW, sorry if my English is not perfect, it isn't my mother tongue."

space,3de8yn,Acivilo,9,Wed Jul 15 16:16:08 2015 UTC,"Gravity! Gravity pulls all things toward the gravitational center, and the more gravity there is, the greater the pull. The more mass there is, the greater the gravity. So, larger objects = more gravity = more pull toward the center = more spherical surface. It may seem hard to imagine that gravity can shift and shape solid rock, but enough of it over enough time sure as heck can.  There are other factors that come into play in reality; tidal forces (gravity from other planets), rotation (making the equators bulge out, like Jupiter), geology, so on and so forth. But, the main culprit for round stuff (or otherwise) in the universe is gravity (or lack thereof)."
space,3de8yn,FallingStar7669,2,Wed Jul 15 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"The shortest way to answer this would be that planets and stuff gather enough mass to have enough gravity to pull it's mass down into a sphere, where as comets and asteroids are many orders smaller, and thus don't have the gravitational force to do it too. Edit: spelling. Damn phone"
space,3de8yn,Xearo420,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:08 2015 UTC,"Over a certain amount of accrued mass, gravity overcomes the chemical bonds that give asteroids/comets their shape, forcing it all to be (relatively) uniformly distributed relative to the center of mass of the object.

Everyone would be a cripple in a wheelchair.  We fill balloons with hydrogen, the lightest element, to make them go up. Jupiter's atmosphere is 95% hydrogen. How do you make a balloon go up then?  Magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic field is full of radioactive death crap vomited out by Io. Io dumps particles into it, and Jupiter dumps energy into the particles until they whizz around at the speed of light. You'd receive a fatal dose of radiation in about 30 minutes if you stood on the leading hemisphere of Europa. Said magnetosphere full of death crap reaches all the way down to almost the upper atmosphere.  Constant nonstop hurricane force winds. No matter where you are, you will be a chip in the river. It's even worse at the transition zones between belts, where the wind speed in one zone relative to another is north of a thousand kilometres per hour.

Small and lightweight means there's no room for a bunch of extra fuel which would be needed for it to stop and enter orbit.

I'm not positive about that (on a 9.5 year mission they hit their flyby window within 72 seconds) but if nothing else a transfer trajectory would have been much slower.  New Horizons, even before it did a Jupiter flyby to gain speed, was on an escape trajectory from the solar system. After leaving Jupiter it flew more or less in a straight line to Pluto.  Had it been aiming for a capture, it would have been on a Hohmann Transfer trajectory which would have dramatically extended how long it took for it to reach Pluto. (And even then it would have needed more fuel for the insertion burn.)   But oh well, hopefully they will find a Kuiper Belt object they can redirect towards and get a second flyby for no cost.

That would be using the soon to be renamed Space Launch System, a rocket family that is the most promising shuttle replacement ever."

space,3dd4xi,SpartanJack17,0,Wed Jul 15 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"Wait a second, there are pretty clearly classified space programs, they are listed in the US federal budget. For a comparison, NASA's budget is up to 18 billion this year,  while the air force alone has a budget of 15 billion for classified projects, and the DoD in total lists 59 billion worth of spending on classified projects.  Some of this spending has been publicly acknowledged to be on military satellites, x-planes, and orbital vehicles.    Examples of publicly revealed projects are the X-20 spaceplane, the DARPA Falcon project, the British Skylon, The Dream Chaser, the Chinese Shenlogn spaceplane, and NASA's own X-37. These are only the spaceplanes we know about, of course all the major countries and manufacturers are constantly working on new classified programs. An example would be the Russian object 2014-28e.   So to say secret space programs is scifi and conspiracy garbage is disingenuous at the least. None of those programs could make it to mars, but they are also just the publicly acknowledged formerly secret programs. We have no idea what they are actually working on, all we know for sure is that various entities have budgets larger than NASA, and are clearly working on secret space vehicles."

space,3debct,blubberbot,11,Wed Jul 15 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"Everything comes down to angular resolution. The calculation is simple--it's 'how big a thing is' divided by 'how far away a thing is'. Pluto is closer than the galaxies and nebulae that Hubble images, but it's far smaller relative to that distance.   A nebula might be ten light years across and 1000 light years away--so that's 0.01 radians, or about 0.5 degrees of sky, or 34 arcminutes (bigger than the full moon). Pluto is 2,360 km wide and (at its closest) is 4.28 billion km away, so that's 0.00000055 radians, or 0.0000315 degrees of sky, or 0.11 arcseconds.  Hubble has a resolution of 0.1 arcseconds--so Pluto would be (approx) one pixel wide on its detector, and the nebula would be 204000 pixels (so big that it couldn't possibly image it all at once!) The pixel analogy isn't quite right but you get the idea.

Even if Pluto were more than a few pixels in Hubble's sensor this would be an issue. Hubble can stare at a piece of sky for hours or days, gradually collecting the photons. This is how the Deep Sky pictures were done."
space,3debct,Cokeblob11,0,Thu Jul 16 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"Hubble can take great pictures of nebulas because they are large and dim, the andromeda galaxy is six times the size of the full moon in the sky, but we can't see it because it is so incredibly dim. So Hubble does not need very much magnification to see these objects. Planets on the other hand, are small and bright. So to get a good image of a planet you need a lot of magnifcation, which Hubble does not really have. So Hubble can't take a good picture of Pluto for the same reason that most digital cameras can't take a good picture of a grain of sand 10ft away."

Also, would it be able to get there faster?   It would take longer, much longer. New Horizons managed to get there fast because it had no reason to slow down. An orbit to Pluto would have to slow down long before it got to there in orbit for it to be caught by the gravity.  The thing to remember is that technology moves incredibly quickly, so even if NASA launched another probe right now with the best technology available it would still be outdated by the time it got there and people would be asking the same questions."

But when we go to space, we are all humans from planet Earth. Not white people or black people or brown people or yellow people. Humans.

space,3d8yju,ratchet50000,3,Tue Jul 14 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I am a little less optimistic about humankind. We will spread into the stars, not because of scientific or exploratory endeavor (despite the official line), but it will be because there is money to be made (mining/tourism) or as matters of national pride/defense (Apollo as capitalism vs. communism, spy satellites, we've already begun arming space), and then as spaceflight becomes affordable, due to overpopulation on Earth. As not everyone will ever think the same, there inevitably will be divisions between colonies/planets/systems.    Perhaps if we meet hostile aliens we will unite, but only for the short period it takes to defeat them, or when we lose the war. The most I think could happen in an interstellar UN, which doesn't have much power, but nominally unites all of humanity.  History generally shows that neither the optimistic (utopia) nor pessimistic (extinction) predictions of the future come into being (look at the Cold War predictions of 2015), so I'm going with the more realistic nation-states, but in space prediction, loosely united, with intra-human enmities, with the goal of enriching oneself (as it has been for millennia)."

All the 54 galaxies in the local group, alongside 100,000 more, are all part of the Laniakea Supercluster, which spans 500 million light years.

I'm sure someone around here has all the facts and dates down, but it sounded like something they'd at least be testing around 2020, and we might get to see a man on mars by 2030. it could be earlier (please correct me if I'm wrong), but with how costly it is and this type of mission being insanely difficult, we still have a long way to go.

While I'd love to see it I don't believe we are going until the rocket is on the pad.

I'm trying to look at it all practically. it's not like most of the u.s. is excited for space travel, and no doubt the cost of doing such a mission is pretty crazy. it's sad to me it's not one of the higher goals of the government.  they were mentioning the rocket and how far they've come, saying they had something like 1,500 top scientists from all over the country building this thing. it was mesmerizing and I came away impressed. but like you said, a rocket on the pad is needed first.

space,3d9949,devianaut,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:43:45 2015 UTC,Oh at this point we will see a rocket. Some version of the SLS is going to take people to the ISS at least. Beyond that however history tells me not to get my hopes up.
space,3d9949,svarogteuse,5,Tue Jul 14 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"SLS won't be taking people to the ISS, it'd be quite an overkill. After all, it's capable of throwing the Orion capsule at Lunar orbit. (the block 1 version) They'll leave ISS flights to smaller and cheaper rockets like Atlas V and Falcon 9.  I think they'll do some SLS flights, at least the first test flight around Moon and Europa Clipper. The asteroid retrieval thing doesn't seem to be moving forwards very fast right now, so I hope they either fund it properly, or cancel it and focus on a Moon lander or deep space station. Which of course, cost a lot of money too.  I hope more research went to actually making spaceflight cheaper, like what SpaceX is trying to do. That should be the focus right now."
space,3d9949,Karriz,2,Tue Jul 14 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"We have done overkill before. It was overkill to send 7 people with payload and glider capability on every launch that only required one off those components but we did it for decades. Yes it would make a lot more sense to use smaller rockets but once they have the SLS sitting around someone is going to come up with a study about cost savings somehow (however contrived) that sends it to the ISS, or its replacement eventually."

Well The Orion space capsule is built and had one successful test flight in December. The solid rocket boosters are the same ones from the space shuttle program with one extra section added to give it the boost to leave lower Earth orbit (leo) and have had a test firing earlier this year. A second test is scheduled for August and NASA Social attendees will get the opportunity to witness it. The European Space Agency (ESA) is building a portion of Orion so the USA is locked into completing this project. 2018-2020 is when we should see SLS first launch which will take it just beyond the moon.

space,3dbg0f,Hifi3000,23,Tue Jul 14 23:44:23 2015 UTC,"That right! But: computer scientists thought of a way to deal with this problem.  Basically the image is sent multiple times so that we can be sure we got all the 1s and 0s correctly. The actual method to do this is pretty complicated and called forward error correction, or FEC. Most FEC algorithms are clever, sending parts of the message at a time with markers and partly repeated sections so that you can guarantee reconstruction on the ground. (if you miss a small piece, you can reconstruct it from extra information in nearby pieces). If a whole chunk of data is completely missing, we ask the spacecraft to re-transmit it later. Eventually it all comes down to repeating the bits enough so that we always get the whole, precise message .... eventually. This is one reason that it takes so long to get the data from New Horizons. FEC is not very fast because of the redundancy."

space,3dbg0f,way2michelle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:22:47 2015 UTC,"Sure there is. A more robust error correction will reduce bandwidth all the way down to nearly zero in theory. Since they have a playback capability to retransmit, they must choose the right balance.  I also read somewhere, the bandwidth drops really low due to the extreme distance of 30+ AU. Going to take a year and a half to transmit all the data that was just captured in a few days. Not sure as to the quantity of data to be sent back overall"
space,3dbg0f,ricodued,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:56:42 2015 UTC,"I would think they'd need/want a checksum/hash as a validation of the error correction process at the very least, but I'm speculating and have no practical experience with error correction at this level."

The fundamental technologies do not go away.  New ones occasionally come into being, and some of the specific implementations of those techs get replaced, but there is absolutely no reason to suspect that we'll ever stop using radio waves.  There IS good reason to worry that civilizations only use radio for so long before they destroy themselves... but that's a whole nother ball of wax."
space,3d4q82,eubarch,13,Mon Jul 13 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"We have already stopped sending out massive high-power radio signals into space, as we switch to lower-power and very highly directed radio energy for cell phones and the like. Not to mention, our (unintentional) radio signals are practically undetectable unless you're within a few light years of Earth. To get a detectable message, we'd have to have a directed beam of radio energy sent straight at us, like the Arecibo Message.   Radio technology doesn't just go away, no, but it becomes increasingly less used (when's the last time you used a Telegraph?) and eventually fades to obscurity. For an alien civilization which has (hypothetically) moved on from Radio, how long are they going to keep it around after it's obsolete for the sole purpose of sending messages out to the stars? Then, what are the chances that they'd direct a message right at us? Then, what are the chances that we were listening when it hit sometime within the last several million years?   Moreover, what are the chances that they'd want to contact a civilization on radio frequencies if technology existed to replace it? They might view radio communication the same way we view smoke signals, a once-useful but now completely obsolete method of communication. We certainly wouldn't learn much from trying to contact aliens who are in the stone age, perhaps they think the same way about radio age civilizations.   My point is, there's a lot of reasons why we aren't receiving communication from aliens on the small handful of frequencies we've been listening to for a short blip of time.   My source for all of this is Randall Monroe's What If? series, which is itself well sourced."
space,3d4q82,meatspin27,3,Mon Jul 13 21:43:59 2015 UTC,"There is a corollary theory that states that while the use of radio may never go away, radio signals that are obviously coherent will.  Coherent (i.e. radio signals that are obviously an intentional broadcast and not background noise) signals might only be broadcast by a civilization for a very short time, bounded on one side by the discovery of radio and bounded on the other by the advancement of data compression technology.  As data compression efficiency increases, the signals transmitted approach incoherent noise."

There's also the possibility that we're headed for some kind of obstacle (which could be extinction or self-annihilation) that is incredibly hard for civilizations to overcome, which could mean there are very few (if any) civilizations that are significantly more advanced than us. For all we know we could get hit by a gamma-ray burst from within our galaxy tomorrow and then that's probably it for humanity. Not to mention all the more likely things in space and here on earth that could end us. Perhaps it's just incredibly rare for a civilization to dodge all those bullets long enough to become advanced enough for us to detect them. After all, we already dodged one bullet asteroid just 66 million years ago, that came pretty close to killing us off before we even evolved."

Voyager was able to do this because the instruments were on a platform that could move, and the engineers could orient it such that Voyager's dish acted as a sunshield. --SJR"

space,3d6n05,a_calder,143,Mon Jul 13 22:56:46 2015 UTC,"There seems to be so much bad information in this sub about what to expect in the next 24 hours, I just thought I'd clear some things up.  First off, Emily Lakdawalla's blog probably has the answer to your question of the timing of events. It really it packed with information. But the short version is that there will be a photo or two released every day for the next week or so. These will be compressed photos. Then NH will spend 2 months sending back non-photo science. Then more data will be sent that will include uncompressed photos, but this process will take nearly a year to transmit.  The probe can not collect science and transmit data at the same time, and the data transfer rate is about 1000 bits/sec. NH will be very busy during the flyby and will not even begin to send back data from closest approach for a day or so. Not much will be happening on Earth during closest approach except that we will all be talking about it. But the data will take time, so be patient.  One photo expected to be released around 11:00 UTC/7 AM EST Tuesday is the photo taken at 20:17 UTC/4:17 PM EST Monday and downloaded during the E-Health 1 download. [Edit: This is that image!] This will be the highest res single photo that shows the whole illuminated surface, but it will be a compressed version of it. I think a version of this will be the photo for Pluto in text books for the next 100 years (so probably longer than there will be text books.) [Edit:There will eventually be a 4 photo mosaic that might end up being the Pluto photo, and this will be one of the last downloads on 7/20, before the several month photo hiatus.] Later photos will be higher resolution images zoomed in on surface features. A few of these will trickle in over the next week, and the rest over the next year.  Edit: Now that the closest approach has passed and full frame photo I discussed above has been released, here are the next few events I'm excited about:  Wednesday, July 15 at 01:09 UT / Tuesday, July 14 at 21:09 ET / 18:09 PT - NH Phone home. No science, but first confirmation that it survived the encounter.  Wednesday, July 15 at 19:25 UT / 15:25 ET / 12:25 PT: 6.9hr downlink: First Look B - Three of the four images in a 2x2 mosaic of the full surface will be downloaded. I would expect these images to be released Thursday morning US time. These will be 10x the resolution of today's images! The 4th of these 4 will be downloaded on 7/20. The E-Health 1 image above was taken 750,000 km away with a 3.9 km/pixel surface resolution, and the 4 photo mosaic will be from 77,000 km away, with a 400 m/pixel resolution. Eventual surface detail photos will show 50 m/pixel.  Edit 2: I may have misunderstood the description of the 2x2 mosaic, and it may not include all of the disk. From the following description, it appears the image will only span about 800 km of the 2,368 km diameter."

space,3d6n05,CMahaff,2,Wed Jul 15 01:09:10 2015 UTC,"Well that's not 100% fair comparisment, you'll waste quite a big chunk of those 1000 bits on headers in an image. You'd get more pixels into one 10000 bits image than 10 * 1000 bits images.  But on the other hand PNG is (almost always) compressed. I am gonna guess that the images NH sends are not compressed at all, even if it takes quite a bit more bandwidth it's much easier and less error prone.  But yes, it's a tiny fraction of the bandwidth we are used to now in every day life.  Edit: hepp, now they said that the first dataset will be compressed. But then uncompressed data will be sent."

I really expect rockets to drastically come down in price int he next 10 years, once we get really good at reputability. A $1 billion space shuttle launch equivalent (payload wise) will be able to be launched for less than 1% of the cost, or about $10 million.  I also think that we'll get nuclear power running pretty good. We already have the Sterling engine, which is 4x more efficient than modern RTG's, and are very close to being able to work. So 2 Sterling engines with equivalent Plutonium to NH would have enough power to run a decent sized ion engine. Using this, we could send one out to explore the Kuiper belt.

Its the only thing that will motivate our species to explore space again.  Why haven't we been back to the moon? Because we beat the russians there! (And to test the accuracy of our rocketry, by extension our ICBM's) Why do we keep a space program running, why are we funding sls and space x? Because the u.s. Government doesn't want russia holding a monopoly over the space station. That and the chinese are building stations of their own. They're also landing stuff on the moon.  We could be at the beginning of the second space race. If russia or china make serious moon or mars efforts, it's gonna be bananas.  Nothing motivates governments and nations like fear and inadequacy. I truly believe that's what it will take to motivate us to get our asses to mars and beyond. If ESA or Roscosmos lands on mars before the NASA, or worse, if Elon Musk can do it first, people will start writing angry letters to their congressmen asking why america isn't leading space exploration anymore. And that is a very good, motivating thing."

space,3dc2uq,bubrahucize,2,Wed Jul 15 03:07:14 2015 UTC,Depending on size you would perhaps not see any of the object but you would perhaps only instead see the mass of ionized gas (plasma) surrounding it. Depending on what you mean by skimmed (100+ miles out or 50 miles out) there would be significant atmospheric disturbances as well due to the pressure wave / shock wave and heat being propagated around the objects trajectory. Again depending on size and altitude the skimming might lead to the object exploding from the heat and that might lead to some of the mass being redirected to the Earth's surface and making some major problems in the process.
space,3dc2uq,bubrahucize,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"When i wrote this question I didn't realize i left out size. In my head im picturing something 1/10th the size of the moon.

space,3dc2uq,bubrahucize,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:06:23 2015 UTC,"Think of the gravitational affects of the moon on tides. Now put something 1/10th as big but only 50 or 100 miles above the planet. Tidal forces, even if it is moving fast, would cause movements of bodies of water as well as land masses. It will also rip away a big chunk of out atmosphere. Between gravitational pull, burning of the atmosphere as it passes through it and shock wave blowing some of the gases away from our planet I suspect we would loose a lot of our atmosphere and that which was left would be full of combustion by products. The moon is 1/4th the size of earth. So this object would be 1/40th the size of earth. We don't know it's mass without knowing its composition. But at the speed you mentioned I am guessing it would leave the earth in a very bad state. And you would see the sky being split by a huge burning mass."

How wide is the FOV or scanning area   47 arcminutes, 1.5 times larger than the full Moon.   it take so long that by the time an area is scanned and data is crunched something moving could have passed through the area   The telescope basically scans the sky like this and the subsequent «scan circles» overlap 90% in the cross-scan direction.

space,3db4i0,spaceballs-1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:29:39 2015 UTC,Not to be a stick in the mud but technically you aren't transmitting binary you're transmitting an analog waveform.    The transmitter/receiver can convert that analog waveform into binary.
space,3db4i0,wwyzzerdd,3,Tue Jul 14 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, finally something related to my job. The waveform is digital.  New horizons uses phase shift keying, which is a modulation that sends bits by changing the phase. Here is an example of what it looks like:  http://electronicdesign.com/site-files/electronicdesign.com/files/archive/electronicdesign.com/content/content/64598/64598_fig02_inline_cropped.gif  Waves are only analog with other modulation types such as frequency or amplitude modulation. With FM or AM, it directly translates the input (e.g. a microphone) to a radio wave. For example, in AM audio transmission the displacement of a microphone is directly translated to the amplitude of a radio wave. No conversion to a binary stream required."
space,3db4i0,wonderfulcheese,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:07:06 2015 UTC,FM modulation allows for very small noise interference which gives us the great quality (I believe)
space,3db4i0,Metaspirit,2,Wed Jul 15 14:13:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the quality is any better, just that it is more resilient to the type of interference that we see in every day life. FM is more resistant to picking up noise along the way since many sources of noise will only change the amplitude. However, FM radio is susceptible to both the doppler and capture effect. The doppler effect (the same thing that causes stars to be red and blue shifted) can change the frequency of a wave, causing the information received to be different than the information transmitted. This is why airplanes use AM for communication. There is not much in the air that can screw up the AM signal so it is the much better choice in the sky. On the ground there are a lot of things that can introduce amplitude changes to an AM wave (most noticeably power lines), which is why its hard as hell to get a clear AM signal on your car radio. Spacecraft such as the ISS use FM because their velocity is very predictable and you (or most likely, a computer) can easily compensate for the doppler shift on the ground.   The capture effect is your radio demodulating the signal with the most power (highest amplitude) on the frequency you are monitoring. This is why when noise occurs on FM radio stations, they just block out the entire transmission. You can still hear voice on an AM transmission as the capture effect will just add to the amplitude of the wave. You may hear static, but you wills till be able to hear the voice. However, the capture effect isn't that much a problem because there is nothing that really produces waves with the power that humans produce. You will only get interference from this when you are next to another man made object, such as an alternator."

So it has the shape of a body that rotates in 18 hours, but compressional tectonics caused by it despinning pushed up an equatorial chain of mountains.  The other theory suggests that at some point Iapetus has a ring of material orbiting it, which then collapsed and was deposited on its surface.  A similar explanation have been offered for the string of tiny, dark spots that lie along the equator of Rhea, but that didn't create an strong topographic expression, like the ridge on Iapetus."

Just not any print shop, try getting one that does high quality prints in a lot of mediums and not the one that dedicates to quickly hack together lots of prints for students and doesen't have time to say ""hey, this file won't print well in the size you want it"" or ""hey this file contains poor color infirmation and will look very different in the final print"", etc. What i'm trying to say is, get someone patient and experienced to take care of your print.  Alternatively, you may want to actually print wallpaper. It won't have the definition a wide inkjet outputs but you won't need such ridiculously large images to get a huge print, and it might be less akward than hanging a really large print or gluing it to the wall."

Our galactic friends are going to laugh their asses off at our name for this, once we translate it to them. We named the home to our star and billions of other stars, and even a Super Massive Black Hole, after something we pour on our cereal or dip our cookies in."

space,3dazah,RKRagan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well it's their galaxy too. They will have a different name for it, so I wonder what theirs would be. I get excited thinking about a whole other civilization's history and lore, which inspired many of our astronomy names."

space,3dd1ho,pixelmonger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:56:06 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure we are still waiting for a first picture of the flyby (a closeup). I think they said it will be after a few hours.
space,3dcd88,ParachutePeople,3,Wed Jul 15 04:10:52 2015 UTC,"It will perform some more observations and small data transfers while leaving the Pluto system, then will spend the next 16 months transmitting the data.  After this it may fly past another object, depending on weather or not they get the funding."
space,3dcd88,SpartanJack17,2,Wed Jul 15 04:20:47 2015 UTC,"If it doesn't get the funding, does it just float in space forever?"
space,3dcd88,MSGuyute,2,Wed Jul 15 04:53:37 2015 UTC,"Considering how successful it's been getting the funding for an extended mission is pretty much a given, but if they don't it will continue to fly out of the solar system along its current trajectory."

space,3d8sr9,GoASim,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"In the description of my video I listed all of the mods I used along with links to get them. I'm assuming you're referring to the visuals though, in that case, the only mods I used were the clouds and universe replacer (for the skybox). Everything else (Lens flare, glow, light rays), was done in Adobe After Effects. The original shots look absolutely nothing like the final versions in the film."

space,3dam0w,BooYeah0484,5,Tue Jul 14 20:06:52 2015 UTC,Venera-D is being worked on by the Russian Federal Space Agency. Plans are for an orbiter that will last 2 years and a lander that can survive an hour and a half.
space,3dam0w,Levy_Wilson,2,Tue Jul 14 21:46:29 2015 UTC,No matierals that we have come up with since the old Venera program can withstand the acid?
space,3dam0w,Levy_Wilson,6,Tue Jul 14 22:24:22 2015 UTC,The acid in Venus's atmosphere is relatively minor. The problem is the heat and the pressure. And it's difficult to make something that can withstand heat and pressure and also be light and operable.
space,3dam0w,DDPYogurt,2,Tue Jul 14 22:42:31 2015 UTC,"I would imagine the insane heat, pressure, and corrosive atmosphere would pretty much make that almost impossible."
space,3dam0w,Oviraptor,6,Tue Jul 14 20:09:32 2015 UTC,We've done it already. The Russian Venera missions. We even have surface pictures.
space,3dam0w,Levy_Wilson,2,Tue Jul 14 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"And how long did those landers last? The first landers lasted about 20 minutes. The last landers only a few hours. If we send a lander to Venus, we will want to make sure it lasts a while."
space,3dam0w,Oviraptor,0,Tue Jul 14 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"I know it would be a relative waste of funding, I was just pointing it out because he said it would be almost impossible so I assumed he might not have known about it"
space,3dam0w,Kitworks,0,Tue Jul 14 22:29:14 2015 UTC,"Possible, but those missions lasted minutes on the ground in the best case. Arguably not a great use of a ton of money."
space,3dam0w,phlegmbrulee,2,Tue Jul 14 20:16:09 2015 UTC,Definitely not impossible. It's been done successfully twice. By the Russians.
space,3dam0w,leknarf52,2,Tue Jul 14 20:14:05 2015 UTC,A mission to the clouds of Venus is in planning stages.   http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/23/tech/innovation/tomorrow-transformed-venus-blimp-city/
space,3dam0w,eliminate1337,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:29:15 2015 UTC,"Soviets liked to go there; their Venera program had about a 50% success rate landing things on Venus.  None of the landers lasted more than two hours. The extreme pressure and corrosive atmosphere destroyed them quickly. Now that we have baseline information on Venus (pictures from the surface, surface composition, atmosphere composition), it's probably better to focus time and effort on a place that doesn't actively try to destroy whatever's put on it."
space,3d9l2t,darthgallion,9,Tue Jul 14 15:55:01 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons#Goal  It will go on to explore the Kuiper Belt - the field of asteroids out past Pluto. its mission is basically the same at this point as the Voyager probes' - send back whatever data it can for as long as it can. There are, as far as I know, no other planned major milestones in the journey, but you never know what it might uncover."
space,3d9l2t,TheCheshireCody,5,Tue Jul 14 16:03:04 2015 UTC,"I thought they'd calculated probabilities of being able to get to three kipper belt objects, and chosen one to go for. Maybe Wikipedia hasn't updated?"
space,3d9l2t,ActivisionBlizzard,10,Tue Jul 14 23:19:03 2015 UTC,"It's going to the Kuiper belt! I participated in the citizen science project looking for potential targets. They gave you sets of images and you had to mark features that changed from image to image. I ended up marking over 10,000 to get 7 potential targets on my username. Exciting stuff!"
space,3d9l2t,lookatmycamels,3,Tue Jul 14 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you check out the mission profile on Wikipedia you'll see that its slated to study what it can of the heliosphere and Oort cloud, and other Kuiper belt / trans-Neputian objects.  It won't be getting as close to them as Pluto and Charon however."
