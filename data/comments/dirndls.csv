dirndls,2lkjcz,suprfli,3,Fri Nov 7 11:19:55 2014 UTC,I only speak a little bit of German but I think I heard her say that the costumes are complete shit.  I heard Scheiße several times but it wasn't in the closed caption displayed. =)  I really hate the cheap costume dirndls and wish there were less of them posted in this subreddit.
dirndls,2lkjcz,suprfli,2,Sat Nov 8 03:09:28 2014 UTC,"I just watched it again because I remembered how she's really trying to be positive about the dirndl costume (she says ""well it IS cheaper, it's perfect for people who go just once and who want to get it fucked up, pour beer over it and stuff like that"").  what you heard is her explanation about the blouse. she tells him that on the cheap costume, the blouse is just sewn in. but with a real dirndl, the blouse is a separate piece. She calls it a ""B'scheißerl"" (the guy says ""you cant say that, we have to beep it out!""). She repeats it to explain: ""bescheißen"" (= cheat) refers to pushing the boobs together.   you can easily see the difference when she's wearing the real dirndl"
dirndls,2lkjcz,suprfli,2,Sat Nov 8 09:31:22 2014 UTC,I'm with you about the shitty cheap costumes. But I try to be tolerant towards the americans - they just dont know any better...  we can only try to educate them on the beauty of a real dirndl ;)

The most drunk people I've ever seen in one place. Just a bunch of people getting hammered and having a great time, signing drinking songs, raising a toast every 5 minutes, etc. And it was amazingly orderly... I only saw one person getting manhandled by security in the entire week I was there. Everyone's there just to have a good time.  A tip: When you're waiting to get in a beer tent, try and team up with people around you. Once the tents are full, they do sort of a 4-in-4-out thing, and you're more likely to get in if there's 4 of you.   Once you're in, make sure you talk to the people you're seated with. Be social! The vast majority of people there are super friendly. I'm not normally a gregarious person, but I drank beer and shot the shit with a lot of really cool people, and it was truly awesome."

dirndls,2iewj5,not_liz_lemon,25,Mon Oct 6 06:55:27 2014 UTC,"german woman here: when I wear a Dirndl, I want you to look ;)"
dirndls,2iewj5,Russwrites,3,Mon Oct 6 15:10:21 2014 UTC,"I was at Oktoberfest in Munich the other week. The women look amazing in their dirndls, but most of them look pretty rather than in-your-face sexy. The scenery is lovely but your eyes won't be out on stalks - well, most of the time anyway! ;O)"
dirndls,2iewj5,dyonisos911,2,Tue Oct 7 11:27:40 2014 UTC,Which tent were you in?
dirndls,2iewj5,dyonisos911,4,Mon Oct 6 07:36:37 2014 UTC,"This was actually at an Oktoberfest celebration put on by Sierra Nevada Brewery. I don't know if you're in the states and are familiar with the brewery, but they are one of the best microbreweries anywhere, excellent beers. I will definitely be going to Germany within the next few years to go the official fest, though."
dirndls,2iewj5,the-knife,3,Mon Oct 6 15:31:52 2014 UTC,"You should go. You look splendid in a Dirndl. Been last Thursday, Friday and Saturday.   One tip: remember to plan ahead. We get a lot of ""I haven't planned anything but want to go to the Wiesn!"" in r/Munich two weeks before the Wiesn and all we can say is ""No way!"". And bring money. Lots of it..."

dirndls,2idyi4,monsterflake,4,Sun Oct 5 21:07:25 2014 UTC,"I spy, with my little eye, two whole fucking packs of cigarettes in someone's handbag. Jesus Christ, she must smoke like a fucking coal engine."
dirndls,2idyi4,Rodalli,3,Mon Oct 6 02:59:17 2014 UTC,And smell like one too
dirndls,2idyi4,Greg_the_ghost,1 point,Mon Oct 6 14:56:52 2014 UTC,I bet her farts are like billowing clouds of smoke like a Choo Choo train.
dirndls,2idyi4,chiZZeledpepper,1 point,Wed Oct 8 21:39:11 2014 UTC,One pack per girl. Friends don't let friends smoke alone.
