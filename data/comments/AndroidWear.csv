AndroidWear,3e4vpq,sat0123,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:30:00 2015 UTC,"You have the Zenwatch? Mine works fine for a day or 2, then others it won't last even half of a day. I'm not doing anything differently. I almost never ""use"" the watch for anything other than checking the time unless I'm in the car then occasionally I'll change the song/use navigation"
AndroidWear,3e4vpq,sat0123,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:41:46 2015 UTC,Yup.  I don't do anything differently on poor battery days either.  Sometimes it drains while I'm running errands after work.  Sometimes it drains while I'm going to meetings in my building.  Sometimes it drains when I'm just sitting at my desk.  It's really irritating.
AndroidWear,3e3xcp,zzisrafelzz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:49 2015 UTC,I want this too. Preferably as a shortcut I can tap on my watch.  IFTTT + Tasker and touch screen emulation can do this but fuuuck that complicated mess.
AndroidWear,3e3xcp,scirio,0,Tue Jul 21 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"To mute phone alerts/calls just swipe down the watches notification bar and tap on the ""Mute"" bell icon. That option on the phones wear app is to mute your phones notification so that they dont notify you twice on the same thing (your phone rings, then your watch buzzes)"
AndroidWear,3e3xcp,leefrank651,2,Tue Jul 21 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"nope. that isn't what I mean.  I don't want to mute notifications altogether.  I want to change it so that notifications ONLY go on my watch, and then toggle that off.  The Mute Notifications option on the watch is the same on the phone's pull down menu, and will simply turn off all notifications on both devices.  Edit:  Sorry, only half read your comment.  What you told me to do isn't what I want.  I WANT to have that function to mute on the phone and still receive on the watch, but I want it as a widget toggle, rather than delving into the wear app."
AndroidWear,3e283h,agent766,25,Tue Jul 21 11:49:10 2015 UTC,Android Wear doesn't support this. None of the models feature a speaker
AndroidWear,3e283h,breakingcustoms,11,Tue Jul 21 12:35:36 2015 UTC,But they do support Bluetooth speakers
AndroidWear,3e283h,robin_flikkema,4,Tue Jul 21 15:48:59 2015 UTC,Yes but only as an audio output device from the watch with the A2DP  bluetooth profile.   Some (all?) call-capable smartwatches (that aren't stand-alone) use two bluetooth connections between the phone and watch. This duplicates the use of a bluetooth earpiece within the watch. Android wear does not.
AndroidWear,3e283h,sirrelevant,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:51 2015 UTC,"I really wish you could use it as the call input, so you could automatically use speakerphone or headphones on the phone itself. As is it only serves as a remote, so I have to yell ""JUST WAIT!"" at my pants like a mad man"
AndroidWear,3e283h,HiDDENk00l,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"The talking is exactly the problem as I understand it. It's your phone that's receiving and sending the audio of the phone call. It seems most if not all android phones allow software to grab/record the audio of the call. The issue is that some (many?) android phones don't have SOCs that allow apps to inject audio into the phone call.  So theoretically, the android wear app on your phone could send the call audio to your watch, but not all phones would allow the wear app to get your voice into the phone call."
AndroidWear,3e283h,sirrelevant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"Bummer, that's the opposite of what I'd need. It's probably a good thing that audio injection isn't possible though. Too many assholes in this world."

AndroidWear,3e283h,one80oneday,4,Tue Jul 21 16:03:55 2015 UTC,"Small speakers need drivers for the sound to be loud and distinct enough for it to be useful.  Watches are thin and small. They're already packed with sensors, batteries and boards. Putting drivers and speakers in them would be mostly a waste as only a small percentage of people would find it useful.  If you want to make calls, buy a $15 Bluetooth earbud receiver. Both you and your recipient will appreciate the sound quality. Then you don't actually need to raise your wrist up to your mouth to speak - something you probably dont wanna be doing if you're carrying boxes around, eh!"
AndroidWear,3e283h,evenstevens280,9,Tue Jul 21 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"You dismiss the idea like it's impractical and no one is making smart watches with speakers, but there Galaxy Gear has a speaker. It's not a Wear device, but it's not impossible or impractical to make a Wear watch with a speaker.   Putting drivers and speakers in them would be mostly a waste as only a small percentage of people would find it useful.   The great thing about Wear/Android is that there can be lots of devices, some of which can serve niche markets. If only a small number of people want a speaker on their watch, that's fine, there can still be product to fill that niche."
AndroidWear,3e283h,CallMeOatmeal,4,Tue Jul 21 13:38:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Heck, even Apple put a speaker on their watch for calls. There is absolutely a market for it."

AndroidWear,3e283h,Hyperman360,0,Wed Jul 22 00:41:02 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I'm all for personalization and giving the user choice. However, another nice thing about Android Wear is that Google is thinking long and hard about how it should be used,  not just slapping features/hardware support because they can or because it's easy (the whole keyboard debate for example).   My company gave everyone in mobile Apple Watches. Somehow these watches are still stuck in this bubble of newness where it's commonly understood that if your phone makes noise you are rude, however if your watch does no one bats an eye. Believe me when you hear that ding a hundred times a day and hear people having a conversation with their watch on bus you may quickly change your mind about what these products should and should not do."
AndroidWear,3e283h,FFevo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:13 2015 UTC,Well the Apple watch is just as thick as the Moto360 and it makes and answers calls directly. Not trying to promote one or the other but it's totally possible for android wear devices to have speakers in them.
AndroidWear,3e283h,simplyswole,2,Tue Jul 21 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking last night when I was putting my watch on the charger, that I'm actually glad it has no noise making abilities at all (other than the buzz of the vibrating motor). I'm always paranoid that my phone is going to make some stupid noise when I put it down when I head to bed and my wife is sleeping. Its nice to know that that will never be possible with my watch.   (Ie, if my phone is dead, so I plug it and let it boot up while I sleep, will it make some obnoxious startup sound ? Probably. Could I prevent it ? Know freaking knows.  There is a seemingly unavoidable bleep-bloop noise from the phone if I use a Qi charger. )"
AndroidWear,3e283h,kniteshade,3,Tue Jul 21 18:32:31 2015 UTC,I switched back to my gear s for this reason only. The speaker is the best part of the watch imo.  After having the feature there is no way to go back.

I would like to use the mic as the call input in this situation, so you could talk into your wrist. That's some spy shit right there."
AndroidWear,3e283h,HiDDENk00l,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:33 2015 UTC,I tried to decipher your comment the best I could. What would be more rude having a conversation on a Bluetooth headset OR having a conversation and both parties can be heard because it's on your watch?

AndroidWear,3dzw2i,2stroker,4,Mon Jul 20 23:12:52 2015 UTC,There is no battery life issue. It's already on the play store with many positive feedbacks.
AndroidWear,3dzw2i,wc311,2,Tue Jul 21 05:42:07 2015 UTC,"There has to be some battery loss using what I assume is a power intensive watch face. Do you have any data to support your claims, because I have tried WearReal and I noticed a slight abnormaly low battery life."
AndroidWear,3dzw2i,robrene,4,Tue Jul 21 07:48:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting. What makes you think this watch face is more power intensive than a watch face you are used to? I'm a watch face developer, I wonder what people's perception is on this matter. Those watchmaker and facer things are wildly popular, and very inefficient."
AndroidWear,3dzw2i,wc311,-2,Tue Jul 21 09:23:21 2015 UTC,"I understand most battery drain of the watch is caused by the touchscreen and screen, which does not have anything to do with the watch face. But my thoughts on why this watch face may cause a larger battery drain is due to me relating this watch face uses (accelometer, gyroscope) to the functions of gesture. Gestures caused a battery drain for me."
AndroidWear,3dzw2i,awokenthehive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:49:22 2015 UTC,Just because the watch face is reading the accelerometer/gyro data doesn't mean its not being collected even without the watch face.  AndroidWear itself is using that same data so its just shared with the watchface.
AndroidWear,3dzw2i,wc311,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:34 2015 UTC,I was unaware of that. I guess I will try out Weareal again and analyze battery data closer.

I usually wear a watch when I go out and android wear didn't add anything to my day to day use and as a watch it was bulky (big is my preference but with being rectangular and thick it was ungainly.)   It was quick though and the battery lasted ~2 days but I wasn't as impressed with the software I had a lot of false clicks or tapping to get the face to light up and the motion gesturing never really worked."

Single core mode doesn't save that much power vs. quad when you're dealing with milliwatts of difference.  That and the CPU doesn't have to scale to max frequency as often because there are 3 other cores to pick up the slack: it's entirely feasible."

It might simply be intercepting phone notifications as they come in, in which case any other app that has notification access (like Wear or Pushbullet) will also see the notifications. Not much you can do about it. The calls have to be blocked before they get to your phone."
AndroidWear,3dypxk,tacomonstrous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:58 2015 UTC,"Ah that makes sense. I've been using the Phone app on CM to block the number, which would mean its only getting blocked on the phone. I'll speak with my carrier and see what they can do. Thanks for the help."
AndroidWear,3dypxk,JakeSpleen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:59 2015 UTC,I get this but its because when you block a number using the inbuilt blocker on CM it only hides the notifications. The calls and texts still reach your phone so the watch will pick them up.

AndroidWear,3dybhz,tintin_92,2,Mon Jul 20 21:52:28 2015 UTC,"Well Move It uses the Google Fit API, so it doesn't really care where those steps are coming from. If you didn't understand that, what it means is that the app blindly trusts whatever data Google Fit gives it, without bothering about where Fit got that data from. The problem is, there are some syncing issues with Google Fit, so sometimes it kinda ""deletes"" the step count data from the watch when syncing with the phone, which is obviously bad, and confuses Move It. Since Move It doesn't actually run on your watch (it gives you regular notifications on your phone which are mirrored by Android Wear, and even Pushbullet if you use it), it's reliant on Fit.    I wish there were a better option, not only does it work beautifully on the aple Watch, it was also perfect on the Jawbone app for the Pebble."

AndroidWear,3dwdl5,brandonballinger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:42:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. None of the heart rate apps I know about can sync using Android Wear's wifi—they all require a phone running Google Fit.

But I prefer the UI of Android Wear and its integration with the phone's notifications.

AndroidWear,3dtqlb,nickm_27,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:13:48 2015 UTC,"If that's the case I'll update then, I hope the issue will be patched soon then and that it won't be too drastic for me!"
AndroidWear,3dtqlb,n60storm4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:51:22 2015 UTC,"The rapid battery drain only seems to happen every now and then, if you feel your watch heat up just give it a quick reboot and the battery drain should slow down to normal."
AndroidWear,3dtqlb,terthii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:50:35 2015 UTC,Sounds good - thanks!
AndroidWear,3dtqlb,tintin_92,3,Tue Jul 21 12:16:27 2015 UTC,"SW3 user here. I reboot my phone and watch every day, and charge it every night. Have WiFi off, but I have the Always On option turned on. Battery lasts me all day and never experienced the battery drain bug."
AndroidWear,3dtqlb,tintin_92,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:03:10 2015 UTC,Oh cool I'm going to try that every night and hope for the best then :)
AndroidWear,3dtqlb,mywifeletsmereddit,2,Sun Jul 19 20:33:52 2015 UTC,"You won't really have an option, as AFAIK it updates on boot up. However the bug isn't as bad as people make it out to be. It'll easily last one entire day. The issue is that it really should last 2 days, but because of his bug, I'm scared to take it the 2nd day without charging."
AndroidWear,3dt6ij,otacon239,3,Sun Jul 19 05:26:51 2015 UTC,"There's a hangouts app coming sometime that will let you start a conversation from the watch.   You can use touchless chat to start them now. Sadly, with all the hoops it has to jump through to work, it fails for me too often for me to rely on it. I try to never swipe away hangouts cards so I can reply."
AndroidWear,3dt6ij,sirrelevant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"No, at least not yet. At least you can reply."
AndroidWear,3dt6ij,PickleFart9,-2,Sun Jul 19 07:22:17 2015 UTC,I meant that Google will be dropping it so why would they waste time implementing it with their new project when Hangouts will be their new standard.
AndroidWear,3dt6ij,leefrank651,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:32:21 2015 UTC,You have to make sure that hangouts is set as your default messenger

AndroidWear,3dt6ij,leefrank651,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:31:11 2015 UTC,It works for me ...the only other setting I can think of it to make sure Google voice is the default messaging app in the Google voice app itself
AndroidWear,3dth6q,Adrialic,3,Sun Jul 19 08:11:47 2015 UTC,Try going into the Android wear app on your phone and changing the default actions for these commands.  I can perform these commands on my G Watch.
AndroidWear,3dth6q,HipsterDashie,0,Sun Jul 19 09:47:38 2015 UTC,"Navigation has an x through it, and the only option for music is start on phone."

AndroidWear,3dr3ui,webmiester,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:26:58 2015 UTC,Totally infuriating for them to act like it's not a bug. That's like your doctor telling you to try an orthodic for your broken leg.

AndroidWear,3dr3ui,McLovin_56,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:21:32 2015 UTC,Is that with WiFi on though? My battery life is decent but when I put WiFi on that's when hell breaks loose!
AndroidWear,3dr3ui,gskeyes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:11:43 2015 UTC,Weird. I noticed much less battery drain over this past weekend when I used WiFi instead of Bluetooth to connect
AndroidWear,3dr3ui,drewan187,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:29 2015 UTC,"No, I have WiFi off all the time to be fair.... Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't really see the use for it?"
AndroidWear,3dr3ui,biggles86,2,Sun Jul 19 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"that was the first thing i did on my 360 when the update came by.  Wifi eats up more power and makes no real sense to me since my phone is always on the couch next to me, on the desk beside me, or in my pocket.  all are well within BT range"

AndroidWear,3ds4su,fuelvolts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:12:02 2015 UTC,Happening to me too. Hoping for suggestions.  Edit: factory reset worked perfectly.
AndroidWear,3ds4su,fuelvolts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:56:54 2015 UTC,Have you put the watch face to the app your wanting to sync to for example you have it on watchmaker before you try syncing the face also when you go into the android wear app does it say the watch is connected
AndroidWear,3ds4su,ErichW3,0,Sun Jul 19 05:37:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have the watchface apps that worked before the most recent update, and yes the watch is connected."
AndroidWear,3ds550,Diirez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:53:26 2015 UTC,Nope. Can you factory reset?
AndroidWear,3ds550,GetToThaChopra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I have factory reset multiple times. Could it be due to the fact that I use custom.Roms?

AndroidWear,3dp0zk,jzheng711,7,Sat Jul 18 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"Happened to me just a few days ago, the battery drained very suddenly overnight. I got that screen a few times. Cleaned the hell out of the contacts. Also tried resetting the watch by pressing the tiny button on the back for 15 seconds... I'm not sure if that did anything with the battery being dead and all, but it seemed to work. Put it on the charger, and it powered on.  My thread about it here"
AndroidWear,3dp0zk,flychinook,10,Sat Jul 18 03:09:53 2015 UTC,Clean the contacts on both the watch and charger.
AndroidWear,3dp0zk,peropeles,3,Sat Jul 18 02:29:07 2015 UTC,This! 99% of my problems have been the charging contacts - q-tip with alcohol has fixed every problem so far.
AndroidWear,3dp0zk,Crigger540,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:06:33 2015 UTC,Do you just use rubbing alcohol?
AndroidWear,3dp0zk,A2Aegis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:41:46 2015 UTC,Regular drugstore white bottle alcohol - just a little on the q tip and I rub the contacts on the watch.
AndroidWear,3dp0zk,Crigger540,2,Sat Jul 18 22:36:43 2015 UTC,Press the reset button. Happens from time to time... Actually hold the reset button for about 10 seconds.
AndroidWear,3dp0zk,Cheski,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:21:39 2015 UTC,"Happened to me this morning also. Turned on eventually, but has suffered a total reset. This charger port is rubbish :("

AndroidWear,3dp0zk,Rozenrot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:26:54 2015 UTC,"Doesn't help, I've used all sorts of electrical contact cleaning chemicals and it still is intermittent. The watch is nearly a year old now, perhaps I should try and get it repaired before the end of the warranty"
AndroidWear,3dp0zk,kay_vee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"I have this problem with my R. It happens if I let the battery completely die before charging.   I have found that it requires a very specific combination of charger and cord (probably the ones it came with, obvs), but it seems like the lower powered charging blocks are the ones that get the watches going from 0%, but the higher powered charging blocks will work fine (and fast) when the battery is not completely discharged."
AndroidWear,3dp8mo,satisfyinghump,3,Sat Jul 18 03:20:07 2015 UTC,They have data capability
AndroidWear,3dp8mo,OldSpaceChaos,3,Sat Jul 18 03:27:50 2015 UTC,They are data. You can use the dock with  adb for flashing and sideloading stuff.
AndroidWear,3dp8mo,scotscott,2,Sat Jul 18 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"No standard between watches, no support within android wear for external devices (afaik) means it's not going to happen.  Nothing stopping anyone from offering an external battery. The zen 2 will have just that.  The Aria is an ""attachment"" that uses bluetooth.

AndroidWear,3dp8mo,kryzchek,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"I could imagine an ant+ antenna. They are tiny and would allow the watch to connect to a ton of compatible fitness monitors.

AndroidWear,3dpi4j,lgwr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:14:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, I'll be trying this out now! However, do you know of Tasker's silent settings work any differently in Lollipop?"
AndroidWear,3dpi4j,lgwr,2,Sat Jul 18 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"yes - the classic silent setting doesn't work anymore as it has been abandoned by Lollipop  but you can use tasker to set the new priority mode  for me, another big advantage of the tasker methode is that since I'm running a custom rom, I can trigger a ""real"" silent mode by sending an intend through tasker  there is also a xposed module out there that brings back silent mode an can be controlled via tasker - but once again, may not be a solution for you as it requires a rooted phone"
AndroidWear,3dnojn,cdmaloney1,33,Fri Jul 17 19:21:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it is such a good idea. The image would be massively downscaled from 720 * 1280 to 320 * 320 resolution, not to mention cutoff for round smartwatches. But it would be cool nonetheless"

AndroidWear,3dnojn,leviwhite9,6,Fri Jul 17 21:36:39 2015 UTC,They should probably get the Android app working well before they start a watch app... The video quality is still trash on Android.

AndroidWear,3dnojn,nobunnysapro,-2,Sat Jul 18 03:58:48 2015 UTC,That's just compression. They really want to keep network related UX smooth.
AndroidWear,3dnojn,codyswanson4,11,Sat Jul 18 05:39:32 2015 UTC,And use 50% of your battery in 2 hours????  NOPE...I don't want snapchat on my watch...

AndroidWear,3dnojn,jiznon,3,Sat Jul 18 02:21:21 2015 UTC,It might be fine now...I uninstalled it a while ago because it was so bad.  I haven't used it in a couple months.
AndroidWear,3dnojn,codyswanson4,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:43:24 2015 UTC,"Wait, uninstalled Snapchat? Due to battery concerns? Why? It doesn't have a watchside app. And you can simply block the notifications if you were receiving too many."

AndroidWear,3dlllj,justwantedtolurk,39,Fri Jul 17 06:57:54 2015 UTC,All I care about is an OLED display.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Duxon,15,Fri Jul 17 09:59:19 2015 UTC,"This. It pretty much needs this, and no amount of bigger battery and better processor will get me to buy it if it has a power hungry screen type.   OLED also lets us use things like ambient mode more without worrying about the backlight use being an offset for the feature's benefits."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,winterblink,11,Fri Jul 17 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"Or ya know, the transflective masterrace."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,nobunnysapro,3,Fri Jul 17 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in that respect I feel Sony and Pebble nailed it. The Pebbles are still a little better in terms of indoor legibility, but outdoor, both are miles ahead of other Android Wear/Apple Watch."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,tintin_92,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:13:12 2015 UTC,Ex PebbleTime owner. The screen was basically unreadable indoors.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,thebaldgeek,0,Sat Jul 18 03:38:43 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. Unless you're reading it in extremely dark, (or against the light), the Pebble was absolutely perfect was viewing both in and out doors. Of course my experience was with the original Pebble and I didn't think the screen quality went down..."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,tintin_92,-3,Sat Jul 18 04:03:28 2015 UTC,"Like wise, I respectfully disagree. I am a two time Kickstarter backer, the first Pebble has much better screen contrast indoors than the PebbleTime.... After a few weeks, I simply could not continue with it and gave it away, it was a massive relief to go back to a watch that I could see while inside a building. Of course, your eyesight may be significantly better in those kinds of light and so you may not have an issue."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,thebaldgeek,-1,Sat Jul 18 12:02:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, I guess I had no idea. I stand corrected. Your experience is... Disappointing."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,tintin_92,-1,Sat Jul 18 12:59:34 2015 UTC,"I was. There are a few points that the Moto lets me down on (battery life and wet (sweat or water) screen causing random touches), so I backed the PT after having a really good run with the original Pebble. Was really shocked at how bad it failed to deliver. Was so disappointed that I did not feel I could sell it, so I gave it away. New owner admits, it has major problems, screen readability is up there."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,thebaldgeek,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:01:47 2015 UTC,The only problem is a lack of touch screen.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,ThePixelHunter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:15:18 2015 UTC,Pebble is e-ink. SW3 is transflective.  PS. IMO pebble's buttons are nice and tacile. They are not inferior to Android wear's touch driven interface.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,nobunnysapro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:43:55 2015 UTC,"Oh. And yes, I agree. I have an original Pebble, and it's nice. What got to me after a while was:   The severely feature-lacking, ugly software No touch screen :( Black and white No microphone   The Pebble Time fixes a lot of these issues, though I'm still not a big fan of the small, no-touch display."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,ThePixelHunter,-2,Sat Jul 18 02:06:55 2015 UTC,"The new PebbleTime. 1. Is very ugly. Very. 2. No touch screen. Totally agree. Touch is better. 3. Color when you cant see it is no better. B/W is better as its easier to see and better contrast. 4. The PT has a mike, but meh, without Google Now, its pointless.      The PT on paper looks like it fixes a lot of the issues, but after using it for a few weeks, I could not wait to go back to my Moto."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,thebaldgeek,-1,Sat Jul 18 03:43:47 2015 UTC,"Moto360 owner here. Went to a PebbleTime when it came out as I was sick of the touch screen getting smeared and getting funky when wet. After two weeks of the Pebble, I went back. The screen is tiny and unreadable indoors, the lag in the buttons was mading. It truly surprised me. The buttons are inferior to a touch interface IMHO."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,thebaldgeek,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:41:14 2015 UTC,My Sony Smartwatch 3 has a transflective screen and still has a touchscreen. Qualcomm's Mirasol display in their Toq watch is another great battery saving choice.

AndroidWear,3dlllj,drhill80,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:12:56 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I will say one ""fit"" detail the 360 had over the Sony SW3 was that the band attached on the bottom of the 360 so it felt much better on the wrist.  The 360 wasn't horrible thick but it was the one direction they could improve upon... unless they added a bigger battery."

AndroidWear,3dlllj,turlian,4,Mon Jul 20 15:40:46 2015 UTC,I see a marketing opportunity where they send out press invitations taped to the side of a can of fix-a-flat.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,niuguy,4,Fri Jul 17 19:10:29 2015 UTC,Same thickness (its not that thick especially compared to modern men's watches) with better battery life.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,niuguy,5,Fri Jul 17 11:30:12 2015 UTC,My hopes and dreams.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,biglineman,4,Fri Jul 17 15:19:58 2015 UTC,Well at least updates should come much faster. I'll hold my judgement until I see the watch.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,sirrelevant,2,Fri Jul 17 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"The last update to 5.1.1 was a record-setter in delay, but the 360 got all previous updates first or close to first.  I suspect that future updates will go back to the tighter schedule, unless they re-write the wifi support for whatever reason."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Spekl,6,Fri Jul 17 15:37:14 2015 UTC,"I hope it's not called that, every time you tell someone the name they'll be like ""362? That's oddly specific"""

AndroidWear,3dlllj,Underyx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:10 2015 UTC,That's not much of an improvement over the original 360 then.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,wrdprt,6,Fri Jul 17 09:55:54 2015 UTC,"When asked, I tell people it's an Android watch, to most people that's more informative than if I said Moto 360."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,nascentt,2,Fri Jul 17 12:53:53 2015 UTC,Exactly this.  I say I have an Android watch and an Android phone.  I don't bother with the specifics if someone enquires more.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,0274619937389,0,Fri Jul 17 17:48:12 2015 UTC,theyre fucking up if they dont take this opportunity to release the moto 720
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Spekl,2,Fri Jul 17 14:19:30 2015 UTC,They could do a Microsoft and call it the moto 1
AndroidWear,3dlllj,foxh8er,6,Fri Jul 17 22:45:37 2015 UTC,So exactly like my GWatch in terms of RAM and processor?
AndroidWear,3dlllj,nobunnysapro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:05:07 2015 UTC,It's being brought up to speed with the watches that were released before it and are cheaper.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Madcat207,3,Sat Jul 18 01:30:40 2015 UTC,I am sold if it has all of that and GPS... its just so handy to have when i can go out without my phone and have it track my exercise and everything...
AndroidWear,3dlllj,atdifan17,-3,Fri Jul 17 12:38:56 2015 UTC,you go out without your phone?
AndroidWear,3dlllj,raptor102888,8,Fri Jul 17 19:06:18 2015 UTC,A lot of people go running without their phones.  Especially since phones are so huge these days.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Madcat207,2,Fri Jul 17 13:56:45 2015 UTC,"Indeed i do.  One less thing bouncing around, and frankly... it is nice to disconnect from the world for a bit.  People lived just fine without cell phones, and i can continue to do so while i enjoy the fresh summer air and scenery."

AndroidWear,3dlllj,M3wThr33,0,Fri Jul 17 19:12:53 2015 UTC,It all depends on the apps running. There's still optimizations to be made. Using custom faces like InstaWeather or Facer kill it far faster. And heaven help you if you use Google Maps Navigation or Google Fit.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,thebaldgeek,0,Fri Jul 17 15:21:03 2015 UTC,"Most days I get 6 to 8 hours, so yeah, a better battery would be welcome for some of us. Glad that you get better life, but that sort of all day battery run time is not normal for all Moto users."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,nascentt,0,Fri Jul 17 22:49:25 2015 UTC,maybe it's cause i'm not running the latest android wear on it.  I had no issues with it since I bought it 7/8 months ago so left it on the same version
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Ariakkas10,3,Fri Jul 17 23:19:16 2015 UTC,No one is talking about a speaker?   I wanna be Dick Tracy!

AndroidWear,3dlllj,TheRealBigLou,3,Fri Jul 17 23:32:11 2015 UTC,"My perfect V2 Moto 360 would be a fully round watch without any added bezel, NFC, GPS, OLED, speaker (for phone calls/alerts), and a more efficient CPU."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Linux_Man85,0,Sat Jul 18 15:17:34 2015 UTC,So no ambient light sensor?
AndroidWear,3dlllj,TheRealBigLou,0,Fri Jul 17 23:47:22 2015 UTC,Yes ambient light sensor...  Put it somewhere else.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Linux_Man85,0,Fri Jul 17 20:31:49 2015 UTC,"Where else would it go? From my understanding, for it to be completely effective, it needs to be in the same orientation of the screen. Much like on our phones the sensor is not on the sides, but right above the screen."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Satk0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:26:54 2015 UTC,"They could put lugs on the watch, and the light sensor in a lug. I like the look of lugs, too."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Linux_Man85,0,Fri Jul 17 22:32:16 2015 UTC,"I am having a difficult understanding on what lugs on a watch would look like. Could you explain it a bit more? Where do the lugs sit? Are they outside the watch, sticking out the slides, or in a 'mickey mouse ear' fashion?   Edit: spelling"
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Satk0,2,Fri Jul 17 22:36:17 2015 UTC,"Lugs are the arms that jut out of a watch. They're where the watch band attaches to.  See: like almost every watch  The current Moto 360 doesn't have lugs, because the band just goes into the body of the watch. The Huawei Watch is a watch with similar styling to the 360, but with lugs."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Linux_Man85,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:08:19 2015 UTC,Ah! I understand now. That's a good idea. I'd love to see Motorola do something like that

AndroidWear,3dlllj,tankplanker,7,Fri Jul 17 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"Removing the flat tire is appreciated and probably the most important step, if they keep the rest of the form factor of the exisiting 360 I'll be very pleased. Not sure I've ever really had a performance bottleneck on my 360 so I'm not bothered about using an older processor as long it is not significantly impacting battery life vs. a better, newer processor. I'd have prefered a bigger jump in DPI as it would have meant that the screen looks closer to a mechanical watch, which is important to me. I currently get 5am till 9pm with battery to spare without using navigation on my 360, if this spec bump means I can match that and use navigation I'll be upgrading."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,modernbenoni,10,Fri Jul 17 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"It bugs me when people complain about the flat tyre as if it's some big issue. There was a trade off to be made between a large bevel and a flat tyre, and I prefer the Moto 360 to any of its competitors because of the fact that its bevel is so much smaller than any other choice on the market.  It's just a little bit of black at the bottom of a circle. There are so many more important improvements that can be made."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,tankplanker,2,Sat Jul 18 00:42:25 2015 UTC,What improvements are you after?
AndroidWear,3dlllj,modernbenoni,3,Fri Jul 17 10:52:08 2015 UTC,"Battery life, better heart rate monitor (and other monitors), screen resolution, processing power, apps, ability to use with more devices, price... There's so many things to be improved before the flat tyre. Personally I care most about battery life, apps, and better monitors to a standard that would be expected in a bespoke device like a fitbit."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,niuguy,3,Fri Jul 17 12:42:41 2015 UTC,Flat tire doesn't really bother me too much with mine but the sequal really DOES need to remove it.  If only to gain the respect of users who DO care...but also because I really don't have many complaints about it so the flat tire makes it to the top by default.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,zoomy942,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:31:12 2015 UTC,My kingdom for a way to disable the health stuff in the watch!  Sigh...
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Ariakkas10,5,Fri Jul 17 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"There are switches for all of it, not to mention an app by app blocking mechanism in the aw app.   What more do you need?"
AndroidWear,3dlllj,zoomy942,0,Fri Jul 17 15:22:06 2015 UTC,I always disabled Fit and did that app blocking thing for Moto Body but the dam* heart sensor still turns on all the time.  Sigh - wasting battery......
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Ariakkas10,0,Fri Jul 17 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"Mine never does. I can't tell you where the setting is, but it exists   Edit* unless it's turning on and I don't notice it"
AndroidWear,3dlllj,zoomy942,0,Fri Jul 17 18:06:03 2015 UTC,Fair enough and I could be mistaken too.  Either way it'd be great for a really obvious way to say NO to the health stuff.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Ariakkas10,0,Fri Jul 17 19:45:10 2015 UTC,I agree
AndroidWear,3dlllj,tankplanker,0,Fri Jul 17 19:53:02 2015 UTC,"Battery life is coming if they stick to those specs as the battery is at least 25% larger and a more parsimonious processor, we should see big gains,especially as the screen is only a bit bigger.   Sensors I agree with, but they need a sports bracelet for it to really work.   Apps apply to all smart watches including apple and aren't Motorolas direct concern. Fitting nfc and allowing open access would help massively, being able to pay and do stuff on touch is a big use case that with Apple pay getting a lot of attention in the media."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Crappylaptop,0,Fri Jul 17 20:47:59 2015 UTC,Does the flat tire really bother you that much?
AndroidWear,3dlllj,tankplanker,6,Fri Jul 17 22:35:55 2015 UTC,Not enough to go with a competitors model but enough to upgrade to a new 360 without it even if nothing else changed.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Kagron,5,Sat Jul 18 09:01:43 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I don't think it bothers a lot of people who have it, but it does turn away a lot of people who are looking to get a smart watch. Logically they should try and get rid of it just to appeal to a larger group."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,nascentt,0,Fri Jul 17 12:36:52 2015 UTC,"I never really notice it on mine.  But I turned off ambient brightness, so would be fine with it being removed.  Not really much of a big deal.  There's no way I'd upgrade if that was the biggest selling point though."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,0274619937389,0,Fri Jul 17 14:30:35 2015 UTC,I thought screen res of 360x360 was part of the android wear specs? don't think we'll see any higher res until that changes
AndroidWear,3dlllj,tankplanker,0,Fri Jul 17 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"If a vendor pushes for the it google will sort it. Doubt we'll see it till later next year at the earliest though, I want 720 x 720 in the same sized screen as the 360."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,raptor102888,2,Fri Jul 17 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"I really want a smaller option.  Maybe one with a 1.56"" display and one with about 1.25"" would be nice."

AndroidWear,3dlllj,raptor102888,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they should only have the small option.  They should definitely have the large version for people who prefer it, like you.  I, for one, wouldn't mind a smaller screen, and I would love an overall slimmer profile, like the smaller Apple Watch models."
AndroidWear,3dlllj,IV97,0,Sun Jul 19 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"The problem with this, as was said before the 360 came out is that on a round screen you need A LOT more space to display information. 1.5 inches on a circular display is A LOT less than 1.5 inches on a square display. I totally understand the argument that it would fit some people better... But the amount of information that is cut off the screen is already bad. Moto probably wouldn't release something that does it more."

AndroidWear,3dlllj,Lucosis,8,Sat Jul 18 06:26:44 2015 UTC,It has been my experience that you aren't allowed to say that. I've had my 360 for three months and literally do not notice the black bar. People blow it waaaaay out of proportion.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,GlitchyToast,2,Fri Jul 17 12:19:15 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's typical reddit rage. I never notice it at all.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,nascentt,0,Fri Jul 17 13:26:17 2015 UTC,I had no idea there was a black bar on my watch until I saw reddit start moaning about it...and then I forget all about it until I come back on reddit.  Literally not a problem.
AndroidWear,3dlllj,Depression_Is_Fake,2,Fri Jul 17 13:51:47 2015 UTC,I'd rather have a huge circle watch face than a smaller watch with a fat circle all the way around it

AndroidWear,3dlllj,Ariakkas10,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:50:04 2015 UTC,That's a nice render. What does it actually look like though?
AndroidWear,3dlllj,raptor102888,0,Fri Jul 17 17:24:50 2015 UTC,What reason is there to think it'll be any different from the render?  The renders of the Moto 360 on Motorola's website look exactly like the 360 in real life.

AndroidWear,3dlllj,raptor102888,0,Fri Jul 17 18:04:30 2015 UTC,It looks just like the render.

AndroidWear,3dqis5,Adoomistrading,3,Sat Jul 18 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"But those people that buy Fitbits are buying a Fitbit because it fulfills the need of a fitness tracker. An OEM wouldn't be able to compete with an already saturated market of fitness trackers.

AndroidWear,3dqis5,sniperwhg,3,Sat Jul 18 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe I am. But I don't think so. If you need to answer calls or change songs when working out, buy some headphones with an in line mic.    And I'm not talking about screen quality, I'm talking about pure size. People don't want to scroll continuously because the screen is small. I experience this between my G Watch and 360.  Edit: look at that Sony band and tell me you want to read emails on that. I know I don't.  Gigabit telecoms =/= fitness trackers, so I'm not sure what you're getting at there."

Not when you consider Google itself can't get Fit working properly after a whole year.  Their own app through their own api running on stock wear OS and its totally pooch-screwed.  If they can't even get this right after a year... Oy.  Google needs to get their shit together and fix the Android wear platform, develop existing apps for better and intuitive use on a watch, and implement actually useful methods for responding to texts and emails that does not involve voice or drawing fucking emoji.  I almost feel lied to.  ""Here is all this stuff you can do on your watch!  Oh... But only some of it works some of the time, some of the rest of it is just horrible, but sorry!""  I exaggerate.  But all Android wear really is so far is a notification screen on my wrist and a connected device that lets me bypass my phone PIN thanks to smart lock.  And I'm actually OK with that.  I really like having it and not needing to pull out my phone all the time to see a notification or text or email.  I really like that.  But...  Fitness tracking?  Joke.  Heart rate monitor?  Maybe if your body is at zero Kelvin and all motion stops, MAYBE you'll get the sensor to not throw a measurement error.  Voice interaction?  I don't want to look like a tool in public.  Not connected to your phone at the moment?  You can't do shit, because fuck you, that's why.  Actually, a lot of good things were fixed in the latest wear firmware update that I really hated.  Like voice input is the default first operation when you touch the screen.  Fuck that nonsense, I'm glad they fixed that ridiculous operation.  But for the love of God, two things:  please, get rid of long-touching the screen function.  I simply cross my arms and my watch is idled on the face selection screen.  Second, fix the fucking Android wear app interface.  It's is complicated and so non-intuitive.  Just this afternoon another redditor here didn't even know that certain settings menus existed in the app because their location is so difficult to perceive in the UI, and you have some settings in one place and some settings in a totally different place.  The app sucks.  My only realistic hope is that gets further development.  /rant"

Consumer electronics always tends to fall in price over time, and I think smartwatches would become much more appealing if they were in the $60-80 price range rather than the $200-400 one.  More communication tools.  Google's already rumored to be working on something similar to Apple's Digital Touch.  Improved wifi access.  They've started going down this road, but haven't really realized the implications yet.

AndroidWear,3dgw9e,Dedalus2k,7,Thu Jul 16 04:24:21 2015 UTC,"1 It does, at least it's supposed to, automatically gather sensor information from both the phone and the watch (from the watch in periodic syncs) and then analyzes them and uses the best information it's able to. If your phone is in your pocket it's probably a more reliable step counter than your watch. This analysis can take pretty long and more than often seems to happen in the cloud rather than locally, I've often seen corrections being made up to 2 hours after the activity being recorded.   2 google fit is a whole platform. The app just provides an easy way to track some basic activity. All of the activity gets synced to the Fit database of your account. Other apps should just read what the Fit app displays. If that doesn't work, not sure why. It might be a problem with the third party apps.   3 it takes some time. Web syncing is weirdly inconsistent. But after a while of using I've found it to become pretty fast.  Fit is a little bit of a mess right now, but the whole system is less than a year young. The fit app gets updated almost every two weeks at least once. So do Play services, which contain lots of the biosensor tracking magic. If you have problems now they're probably going to get sorted rather soon. Be sure to send feedback via the app on your phone."

AndroidWear,3dgw9e,mph1204,4,Thu Jul 16 05:18:02 2015 UTC,I agree.  The best solution I've come up with is to use the Jawbone Up app (the one with the purple icon).  I've found that it's better at tracking steps and maintains more accuracy than Fit.  It also syncs to more services.
AndroidWear,3dgw9e,cdegallo,3,Thu Jul 16 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"Fit has sadly been broken for a long time, Abed quite frankly it's embarrassing that Google can't get it right.  My recommendation it's to uninstall fit from your phone and then disable it on your watch (because it is also prone to sucking battery), and instead, use the Jawbone UP app, which properly interfaces with the watch step sensors (and in the latest update introduced support for heart rate!).  I've had zero problems with correct strep counting. The UP so will also link with other fitness apps/service like myfitnesspal and others for overall tracking  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jawbone.upopen  It's sad that there isn't a good single solution for this, and I think Google not being able to get fit working via their own operating system, their own hardware, and their own api is a great indicator of incompetence, especially when fitness tracking is one thing that was advertised with the wear platform."
AndroidWear,3dirjy,linuxwes,5,Thu Jul 16 16:34:57 2015 UTC,Endomondo for sure. The app on the watch looks amazing. You can start and stop workouts on the watch and at the end you get a summary on your watch.

AndroidWear,3dirjy,conrad_h,2,Thu Jul 16 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"Bare in mind that you can't input custom interval training with endomondo unless you pay £5 a month.   I'm currently trying run keeper, but haven't used it on my watch yet."

AndroidWear,3dgys1,korben1301,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"Was hesitant to update to the latest version because I read this from others, but after updating, mine has worked properly and step counting is normal.    I'm on GWR and Nexus 6.    I manually resync'd apps after the update because the up app on my watch would not open when I would tap the icon. After that, all has been good."

AndroidWear,3dgys1,tintin_92,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:32:46 2015 UTC,"Not a stupid question.  In the android wear app on your phone tap the settings cog in the upper-right, then select your watch at the top of the next menu.  At the bottom of the list in the resulting menu there is a ""Resync apps"" option--tap that and it will do just that!"

Probably your best option to see if you like smart watches.  I personally started with the G Watch, it's pretty good. I sold it and bought a Moto 360 a couple of days ago, which I'd say is much, much nicer than the G Watch."

AndroidWear,3dfixw,ChiefSittingBear,3,Fri Jul 17 01:45:09 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend it to see if you like Android Wear... I have one and it's convinced me to get a better watch when I find the right deal. Also now I know what I want in a watch, where before I had the G watch I don't know how I would have decided between the more expensive watches. After having this for a while I know when I wear it and what features I actually use.  Worst thing about it is that you can't see it in direct sunlight really. Second worst is that it looks too much like an Apple Watch now. Way too often I get ""How you like that apple watch??"" comments, and I live in a kind of sketchy neighborhood so I've become a little hesitant to wear my watch around now because people think it's a $400+ device... So basically anywhere you would be flashing a brand new smartphone around in, you might want to take it off, even though it's only worth $60."
AndroidWear,3dfixw,GlitchyToast,3,Wed Jul 15 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help, everyone! I ended up taking your advice and bought a slightly-used G Watch off ebay for $65.  EDIT: Oops, never fucking mind, the person sent the wrong item! Sigh."

If you can get a good deal on a 360 given that they're so much cheaper, get it. The G Watch R will last longer. Is more durable. Does have a better screen. Does perform better. All of these are totally true. But, after the latest update my 360 will handily lastly me through a day (5 am to 10/11 pm).  So it depends on what you're willing to spend. Also, The 360 has wifi support (which I rarely use) and the GWR will get it ""soon"".  That's my 2 cents."

I use it with a black stainless steel link band and it looks really nice and professional. Can't even tell its a smartwatch which I like.
AndroidWear,3d9zkm,EdistoBeach,6,Wed Jul 15 03:01:06 2015 UTC,"I have both lol, 360 is more suited for inner city lifestyle, charger close by for some extra juice, glass sticks out of the bezel and is the first thing to contact anything when bumped. I feel its underpowered, it takes an extra second to open apps and such vs the GWR but it is not slow. GWR has a slightly smaller screen (but same resolution so higher DPI) that is recessed into the bezel, perfect for adding a glass screen protector (highly recommend this, my screen cracked from welding/grinding). I have the dual core kernel installed and the GWR is snappy and lasts the whole day even with dual core enabled. If you are very active and out all the time GWR would be the way to go, if you sit in a cubicle all day grab a 360. Im a heavy diesel mechanic and im wearing my GWR at work right now! My 360 is for going out to dinner and relaxing."
AndroidWear,3d9zkm,Blazer323,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:52:57 2015 UTC,I was in love with the Moto 360 in looks until i saw both in person. The Moto 360 looks too fat and clunky on your hand. The LG Watch R looks like an actual watch and doesn't have part of the scree cut off at the bottom. I got mine through Cowboom (preowned/used) and it was $200 which was a pretty good deal.
AndroidWear,3d6zrd,xxTheGoDxx,23,Tue Jul 14 00:37:10 2015 UTC,Also can phone calls get muted by wear like they used to be ?   They really need to stop making changes like this without offering an option to put it back.  If I didn't watch choice I could have just gone with the Apple watch.
AndroidWear,3d6zrd,xtphty,8,Tue Jul 14 03:31:02 2015 UTC,"They really need to stop making changes like this without offering an option to put it back.   Yeah, I completely agree. That Apple like we-know-best-what-you-want approach can suck a bag of dicks! Especially when all the changes in user interfaces since the original Android Wear launch shows that they don't know best at all.   Remember they thought it would be ok if as soon as you have one card/notification in your stack that your watch face is obscured."
AndroidWear,3d6zrd,plumtacular,2,Tue Jul 14 05:08:50 2015 UTC,His is how I feel about Google removing android wear from the notification area. No problem if you wanna remove it but at least have the option to put it back if you like it

AndroidWear,3d9tyv,Subtenko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:57:01 2015 UTC,Android wear leaves bluetooth on as its searching for your phone while on wifi.
AndroidWear,3d9tyv,leefrank651,0,Tue Jul 14 17:45:45 2015 UTC,Most (or possibly all) of the watches only have one antenna shared between the Bluetooth and WiFi - as they both run on roughly radio spectrum - it would be impossible to use Bluetooth and WiFi at the same time and in the case of the LG Urbane watch for example - the FCC documents even note that it's not possible. The Bluetooth chip is only active to search for your the paired phone while WiFi is being used - but as soon as the watch finds the paired phone again - it will use Bluetooth and turn the WiFi off.
AndroidWear,3d9tyv,asjmcguire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:18:22 2015 UTC,Oh OK. I wasn't sure cause when u swipe down u see the WiFi signal icon

Of course you can charge your watch when you come home after work but its a hassle to monitor the power of another device and not everybody goes straight home after work.  Anyway, I get like 12 to 15 hours most of the time with gesture wake on and ambient mode off. I run Watch Maker and allot of apps."
AndroidWear,3d374k,xxTheGoDxx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:43:59 2015 UTC,Yeah with ambient mode off I get about the same. I use ambient mode when I know I will be able to get home in a reasonable. Other wise yeah ambient mode off all the way with no issues.
AndroidWear,3d374k,zim1985,4,Tue Jul 14 01:13:07 2015 UTC,Features such as what? Battery performance has been phenomenal for me through numerous software updates.
AndroidWear,3d374k,Baalinooo,11,Mon Jul 13 05:46:48 2015 UTC,"It got better, but it far from being phenomenal."
AndroidWear,3d374k,xxTheGoDxx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:19:31 2015 UTC,"Higher minimum brightness (app smart brightness), ambient mode on, keep the watch longer active (you can change the seven seconds default to 30 seconds with Watchmaker or even keep it constantly on with other hacks), apps with Tasker integration need a fair deal of power, changing presets, skipping tracks and choosing albums with PowerAmp Remote can drain you watch quickly if you have the brightness up, GPS, even more notification etc."
AndroidWear,3d374k,scotscott,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:49:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's five thirty and I've used 33% battery, WiFi has been on, and brightness set to full. At this rate it will die around 9 am. Which isnt really helpful, but i suspect I could easily get two or three days especially if I turned it off at night."
AndroidWear,3d374k,xeothought,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:32:40 2015 UTC,It just never got better for me. Six to eight hours of battery life is just about what I get.
AndroidWear,3d374k,mph1204,7,Mon Jul 13 13:01:40 2015 UTC,six to eight??  that's crazy.  do you keep ambient mode on all the time or something?  that doesn't sound right at all.  you may need to get a replacement if nothing else is helping.
AndroidWear,3d374k,Ran4,2,Mon Jul 13 13:39:06 2015 UTC,A watch not having always-on is terribly broken.
AndroidWear,3d374k,mph1204,4,Mon Jul 13 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"i haven't ever felt inconvenienced that my watch isn't always on.  i mean, i'm not always looking at it.  i don't mind the half second delay from when i bring up my wrist to look at it either.  it's still faster and more convenient than pulling out my phone to look at my messages or the time.  and it provides me with far more functionality than a normal watch would."
AndroidWear,3d374k,xeothought,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:52 2015 UTC,I'm happy to hear that this is unusual ... I'll try resetting it and then tracking the battery life.   It's been quite the limiting factor as to what I can do with it. I don't even run custom watch faces because it's my impression that they hog a bit more battery life.

Imo they should instead focus on improving how current messenger function with the watch instead of developing new messengers for it.

AndroidWear,3d7fof,sundropdance,5,Tue Jul 14 02:44:00 2015 UTC,A driver may not feel/notice a vibration. I kinda prefer the current navigation where it vibrates before a turn and displays the distance to the turn.

Edit: since I posted I've done some testing to try and figure out the issue. I have found using Google Play Music that the watch will freeze the notification card after a while. I cannot control music playback once this happens and cannot dismiss the card. This is when the ""not connected"" message displays and the watch cannot connect.  I restarted the watch and still had the issue, ""not connected"". So I tried to turn off Bluetooth. Checked my phone a few minutes later and Bluetooth was on. It continually keeps turning itself on and saying the watch is connected via Bluetooth even though Android Wear shows "" not connected"".   I restarted my phone and I am connected to the watch again. I'm thinking it is a Bluetooth issue with the M2 preview, can't speak for other versions."

Apart from the legal junk, it was only 1-2 page of useful stuff. So, I did RTFM. Disconnecting the phone from the device doesn't seem to sync the steps with the server. I already checked out Google fit help too. It's not very clear about how to get the steps synced to server. Hence my question. I guess I should have been clear about that in my question.   Also there are a lot of complaints by people saying that if you leave the phone and go for a walk or run, the watch counts, but when you reconnect with the phone, the count is lost because the phone being idle overrides the watch. Not sure if those problems are still there."
AndroidWear,3cs1uf,ToniGrupos,4,Fri Jul 10 08:48:48 2015 UTC,It's alright. It's not a map view or anything like how the app traditionally works. I would love it if they published a functioning watch face that had the radar feed on it. That would be awesome.

AndroidWear,3cslef,ondik05,2,Fri Jul 10 13:02:37 2015 UTC,"Double check that your watch can connect to your network.  Your wifi credentials are supposed to automatically be transferred to your watch, but it seems often they're not. First, try toggling cloud sync in the wear app on your phone. Some people have said that triggered the transfer of wifi passwords to the phone. Go to the wifi setting on the watch and choose your network. If it doesn't ask you to enter the network password on your phone, you're good. Otherwise, just enter it on your phone, and you won't have to do it again (for that network) until you have to do a factory reset on your watch."
AndroidWear,3cslef,sirrelevant,2,Fri Jul 10 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"Ok so I took your suggestion and toggled cloud sync off and back on. I'm at work and our wifi requires authentication every day so this may not be the best use case but here is what happens.   I left my phone in my office and wandered out of range with the urbane. I get the little cloud icon on the watch face with the line through it that I am not connected to the phone, so I checked wifi, and it says I'm connected.   However, every time I try to use a voice action, even though my watch shows connected to wifi (with the full wifi icon no more exclamation point), I get the ""can't reach Google at this moment"" gray screen error.   I kept attempting to send a text to my brother (keep in mind both my phone and watch are connected to the same work wifi network) but keep getting the error.   I will attempt this again at home on my own wifi now that I have toggled the cloud sync, but I'm thinking the issue will be the same. I'll update later with my findings.   Is anyone else having this issue?"
AndroidWear,3cslef,sirrelevant,3,Fri Jul 10 14:59:45 2015 UTC,"If you've got the wifi symbol (no ""!"") then I think that may be a google server issue.  You could double check with wear browser. It cleverly uses direct internet access for web pages, and will tell you if you don't have a net connection. That would at least tell you you have a good connection to the wifi network.  I will get the ""can't reach google"" on wifi sometimes, too."

Either way it was a serious impact on my battery life.  I factory reset the watch and for the last 2 days I haven't had an issue.  What I will say though is that I'd already heavily modified the permissions of Google play services to deal with the battery drain it was giving me prior to owning a smart watch. So maybe it was a combination of the two that fixed it."
AndroidWear,3crhvd,moooseburger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:13:41 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing my wakelock issues from Bluetooth too. I disconnected Android Wear app from the Watch and the wakes ups were still there. I left Android Wear app ""connected"" to the watch, but disabled bluetooth and the wakelock issues went away.  But seriously, how many times can I keep doing this factory reset and hope it doesn't happen? I'm so disappointed by Android Wear because I think it's the Android Wear behavior that's causing Bluetooth stack to hold the wakelocks. When Bluetooth is connected to my Car Audio or when I leave Bluetooth always on I don't have any wake up issues."

AndroidWear,3cqch0,chucklestheclwn,3,Fri Jul 10 00:00:22 2015 UTC,"I originally had a G Watch and ended up selling it and buying a 360 when they went on sale recently. The G Watch really is great for the price, but I always found myself wishing I had sprung for a watch that was a little more stylish.   The battery life on the 360 has been comparable to the LG although I had to compromise and give up always-on/ambient screen to achieve this (YMMV with battery life, but it's not nearly as bad with the 360 as some people say).   At half the price, I'd say you could still be happy with the G Watch as long as WiFi, round screen, and style/looks aren't as big of a deal for you. Also note that the 360 has an ambient light sensor, which I find myself liking more than I realized I would. Heart rate monitoring is available on the 360 and not the LG, but it honestly doesn't work that great and isn't a deciding factor between the two IMO. Finally, the side button (crown) is also pretty nice to have. I've been really happy with my 360 and haven't regretted switching, but if you end up deciding to save some money by going with the LG, I don't think you'll regret it. Good luck!"

AndroidWear,3cs9pf,nickm_27,3,Fri Jul 10 11:33:45 2015 UTC,"But, if one were to rethink making a watch in the modern age, it should be able to show a lot more information, as a lot more information is now relevant to our lives.   Pictured in the supporting illustration:   The time The time somewhere else The weather The place of said weather A timer of some sort   Holy. Shit. THE MODERN AGE IS HERE"
AndroidWear,3cs9pf,heppbabby,3,Fri Jul 10 21:08:36 2015 UTC,"Analog watches are also a lot easier to tell the time relative to another time. By which I mean, if I have to leave at 5:55, I can at a glance, without even registering the actual time itself tell if I have a lot of time left or very little time left. By contrast, on a digital watch, I can read the digits very easily, but I still have to give it some consideration and comprehend what the time to figure out how much time is left. Small distinction, but basically analog watches aren't all bad."
AndroidWear,3cs9pf,tintin_92,2,Fri Jul 10 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"So basically the reason why analogue speedometers are preferred? I heard that a drawback with digital speedometers is that you can't easily see how fast you are changing speed. The digits just jump around depending on how often readings are taken. With an analogue one, you see the needle move faster or slower depending on rate of acceleration/deceleration.  With a clock, particularly a 24h analogue one (uncommon) one can see visually how much of the minute/hour/day has gone by at a glance. Digital clocks need to be read 1st then processed in this way. Also, time, like speed, is not a discrete experience, but a continuous one. Digital clocks/speedometers can make one think time & speed are discrete experiences, like when one for instance sees the clock say it is 04:17:43, some people may think there is no time between 04:17:43 & 04:17:44, but an infinite amount of points exist over this timespan (right?)."
AndroidWear,3cs9pf,mobileagnes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:18:54 2015 UTC,"That's only true if you're more used to analog time than digital. Personally, it takes me a minute to pin down the exact time on analog clocks, especially the minutes. With a digital clock it's much more glance-able."
AndroidWear,3cs9pf,modidlee,2,Sat Jul 11 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"5$ Casios that tell the time via digits have been out there for years but nonetheless people spent tons of money on watches with hands  analog watchfaces are only inefficient on square screens such as the Apple Watch depicted in this ""article"""
AndroidWear,3cs9pf,lgwr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:54:57 2015 UTC,"I can still get other functionality like a battery stat, or weather in an analog face as well, and I can get a digital watch from the dollar store"
AndroidWear,3coqhc,megamatt2000,5,Thu Jul 9 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"I assume Google wants LG, Motorola/Lenovo, Samsung, Huawei and other manufacturers to invest in product lines based on AW. We can see that Samsung, and LG still are developing devices with their own OS in parallel. Making Wear open source would probably create further incentives for these manufacturers to go with their own OS."
AndroidWear,3coqhc,Gadgety1,2,Thu Jul 9 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"I don't see the logic in open source leading to OEMs preferring their own OS. I would see the opposite in such that they would customize the OS to their desires rather than develop another platform to try to differentiate.   However, keeping AW closed means fragmentation is less of an issue on the platform. It's a way to take back control, or rather keep things from running rampant before there's a repeat of the handling of Android."

AndroidWear,3cjuwf,ionian,2,Wed Jul 8 23:16:29 2015 UTC,"I find it very useful to help ignore certain notifications at work. I have my hands full a lot, but I also organize/manage through the day. Some days it gives me an extra hour of work time, because inevitably once I've put down what I'm doing and stood up straight, I'll just address the email/text, and get distracted.   Also, I miss fewer calls, and I can fastforward/rewind adjust volume for podcasts. I prefer it use it to navigate when I'm driving too. Timers and reminders are also good, I'm more likely to set an event or reminder when I can just speak it into the watch.  I think smartwatches in general have suffered from the lifestyles of tech journalists (not their fault). Most of them sit at a desk, phone not in-pocket most of the time.  On-the-go trades people or homemakers do/will find huge value in it. Unfortunately they aren't really early adopters, and are swayed by tech journo's say ""Mmmmm, a 2 inch screen sitting next to my 5 inch screen on the desk all day isn't valuable"", no shit.  Additional benefit - better battery life. Yes there's some bluetooth drain, however I'll turn on my screen less all day long. I can answer a call, talk through my earbuds, hang up, then text the relevant party, all without adding a single second to my SoT count."

AndroidWear,3cjuwf,kungfooey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:02:13 2015 UTC,"A few things I do with mine:   When I get in my car, my phone auto-connects to my Bluetooth radio (I use an adapter that broadcasts to FM as I drive an older car). I can hit 'Play' on my watch without getting the phone out of my backpack. Constantly use the ""Set an alarm for N minutes"" as a timer and ""Remind me to {x} at Nam/pm"" for reminders. Pause radio or podcasts on my phone when I leave my desk. I use the 'Krona Sunlight' watch face to monitor weather for the following day and adjust my running schedule accordingly. Record my runs with Ghostracer (uploads to Strava) As another person mentioned, I use Google Keep for my grocery lists. I have a list that I just uncheck items off of before I leave (on my phone or computer) and then when I'm there I check them as I by them in the store. It's a nice way to manage groceries because it reminds me of things I might need to buy (when I'm unchecking items I've bought before).   None of this is revolutionary, and yes, you can do it all with your phone. However, having it all built into a watch that I'd be wearing anyway (I've worn watches long before Android Wear came along) is convenient. I find that my phone is less often in my pocket or my hand - more often it's in a drawer or a bag."

AndroidWear,3ch1sn,tabormeister,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply. I actually ended up using an android device also after days of frustration.   However, although i did end up pairing the device, i am having some issues from first day of use-    Notifications are not coming into the device at all after it disconnected once.  Is it normal to see the crossed out cloud icon on the watchface? I think that means its not connected to the internet?  When the device disconnected, tapping the watch didnt do anything i had to restart the phone.    The battery drain is considerable even after the latest update.. Went from 100 to 16 after 9 hrs of use at work.   A bit disappointed with the watch performance to be honest- the pebble lacked more features but at least the basics worked.   Some tips or ways to help will be appreciated. Thanks!"
AndroidWear,3cefny,OGBites,6,Tue Jul 7 07:14:51 2015 UTC,"Don't fret, you just bought it at a bad time. There's a bug affecting the SW3 since the last update, which has been acknowledged by both Google and Sony, that causes the battery drain. Very annoying, and they're taking their sweet time to fix it...  Before the bug, this watch blew all other current Android Wear devices out of the water in terms of performance. Let's hope they fix it soon.  Meanwhile, I'd suggest deactivating the Wi-Fi if it's enabled on the watch, and reset it if the battery is draining. Seem to make the problem go away for a little bit of time."
AndroidWear,3cefny,Baalinooo,2,Tue Jul 7 11:30:56 2015 UTC,Okay so having everything deactivated and closing all the apps using task manager seems to have helped a lot with battery life. I've just had 6 hours of low/med use and I'm at 62%. Better than last night while I was charging when I went from 100% to 11% in 3 hours with no use at all.
AndroidWear,3cefny,andrewia,3,Tue Jul 7 14:42:14 2015 UTC,"My SW3 doesn't behave like this at all.  If other solutions don't work, then reflash using Sony's PC Companion program on Windows."

AndroidWear,3cc3lm,leefrank651,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:56:14 2015 UTC,On the morning of the second day after a charge I'm left with around 45%.  By about 4pm the watch is dead. Normally I'd get well in to the evening if not early the 3rd day.  This is a recent thing and it's really frustrating. Factory reset and WiFi off hasn't helped at all.  It's the rapid drain on the second day that I don't understand.
AndroidWear,3ce41i,wmtiger86,3,Tue Jul 7 05:02:01 2015 UTC,"You can do something like that easily with Tasker and Watchmaker. That would limit you to Watchmaker faces, though.   You could also look into AutoInput, which is a Tasker plugin that can simulate screen interactions (you would basically tell Tasker to open the Wear app and select a watchface there). That seems very hacky and I have never used it, so take that advice with a grain of salt. :)"
AndroidWear,3ce41i,Mettanine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:35:17 2015 UTC,I have watchmaker. Never used Tasker before. How would I implement this?
AndroidWear,3ce41i,Mettanine,2,Wed Jul 8 05:30:51 2015 UTC,"In Tasker you can define certain conditions, e.g. date = July 4th (and a multitude of others like time, location, wifi detected, all kinds of stuff that your mobile can detect). Then you specify the task, that should be executed when the condition is met, in your case change the Watchmaker watchface.  Tasker isn't free, but there is a 7-day-trial available to try it out: http://tasker.dinglisch.net/  EDIT: There is also Automate, which is similar to Tasker but uses flowcharts to set things up. May be easier to get into. And it also works with Watchmaker, just tried it and it worked perfectly. It's free for up to 30 running ""blocks"" (which make up the commands). To change the watchface you need 3 blocks, so in theory you can get up to 10 different watchfaces set up until you need to pay for more. :)"

When a fix is made / found - they will then internally test it for several weeks to ensure it doesn't cause more problems and / or reduce the core functionality of the product. If any bugs are found it's back to the drawing board to fix those and go through the whole process again. I'd assume that the rumoured July 28th date is when they expect the testing period to be complete with no additional reports filed about ""show stopping"" bugs. That being said - it's easy to wonder just how much testing is really done these days - because some of the bugs that come out of Google HQ must surely have been picked up by someone, somewhere before being rolled out?

The latest updates have made a big difference but it definitely seemed a little half-baked for a while.  I still have little flaky problems now and then with the Android Wear phone app but it's nothing major.  As someone else mentioned, battery issues have plagued the SW3 lately and it seems like it's mainly GPS and Google Maps related.  I rolled back to a previous version of Google Maps and haven't had the problems but I don't know if that's solved the problem for everyone.  The other big problem that came up with the recent update has to do with the GPS antenna and moisture.  For some weird reason, when the watch gets wet the GPS data drops out.  Multiple users of the workout app Ghostracer have reported the problem on the app's G+ forum.  I tend to see the GPS dropout between 1-2 miles into a run unless I take measures to keep the watch dry.  A piece of duct tape on the bottom or wearing a sweatband under seems to eliminate the problem."

Any apps that work with wear on your phone will show on the watch.   Can I open WhatsApp on my watch or do I have to wait for a message to come through?   I don't use WhatsApp so I'm not sure, maybe someone else can answer that.   Also, what are some killer apps on the wear store to have on the watch? Also what is watch maker and how do I get that and how do I make my 360 look like an MGS codec or pipboy? I know it's not original but it still looks so good, I'd love to know how.   I get my watchfaces from Facerepo . There's three categories on the site ( Facer, watchmaker, and Pujie Black) that correspond to their app on the google play store. They all allow custom watchfaces. I personally use Watchmaker Premium (you need premium for importing watchfaces)  You can also find watchfaces in the play store that don't require an additional app. Here's the links to the three apps I mentioned.  Pujie Black  Watchmaker  Facer  The process to get watchfaces (i only have watchmaker so I don't know if it's similar with the others) I go to facerepo, filter by watchmaker and when i see one i like on the phone, hit download and choose to open in watchmaker.  Some apps I use on my watch  Google Keep  Paypal  Runkeeper  2048  Flopsy Droid  Wear Notify For Reddit  Weather Time  Animated Watchfaces  Calculator  Wear Internet Browser  WearShare  Youtube For Wear"

I went on vacation for a week and decided to leave my Moto 360 behind since I'd be outdoors a lot and didn't want it to get messed up.  It stayed home for the whole week turned off on my night stand and now there are no watch faces in the Android Wear phone app nor is there a toggle for tilt-to-wake.  Also, my list of blocked apps has been reset and I can't get to the ""Set Actions"" screen.  EDIT: Factory reset the watch and reinstalled Android Wear.

AndroidWear,3c4rbm,Desyphix,2,Sun Jul 5 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"honestly, I think it might be best to get a LG G Watch. You can get them used on Swappa for under $100 or brand new on Amazon for $99. I had a Moto 360 (didn't like the screen resolution and the flat tire and battery was dismal) and have an Apple Watch for when I'm using my iPhone. But I just got the white LG G Watch on Amazon (the white one) for my Galaxy S6. This watch is a great intro to Android Wear, has great battery life (can get close to 2 days even with Ambient Mode turned on). I'd say give it a try and then decide if the next round of watches are for you!  http://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-Watch-Retail-Packaging/dp/B00LGJ9JRO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436469679&sr=8-1&keywords=lg+g+watch&pebp=1436469680841&perid=1QVTP53TC3P4KRMABWV2  http://swappa.com/buy/lg-g-watch/us"

AndroidWear,3c2mjp,HazardousCorn,4,Sat Jul 4 04:35:42 2015 UTC,"If the 360 has a fully round display which remains the same size (1.56in), then it would be 231ppi (quite literally 360/1.56).   As two references, the current is 205ppi (320/1.56in) and the g watch r is 247ppi (320/1.3in)"
AndroidWear,3c2mjp,GirLovesWaffles,-1,Sat Jul 4 06:54:39 2015 UTC,"Welp, hopefully that's not true because that's terrible. We need at least 300. I won't buy my first smartwatch as the 2nd Gen 360 if this is what we get for a screen."
AndroidWear,3c2mjp,Kmann1994,2,Sat Jul 4 17:13:47 2015 UTC,"Is it really, though? What are you losing by it not having 300ppi?  Personal opinion, but I'd rather they focus on improving battery life and performance than spend time upping the screen and being forced to place a more power hungry screen in there. Higher res is nice, but there are bigger problems to be fixed IMO.  Also, I could be wrong, but I think the max ppi on any smartwatch is barely 300. Even the apple watches are at 290 and 302, and they sell for much more.   But, if it's all or nothing for you: 468 x 468 is your golden ppi. I honestly think they're going to shrink the screen size a bit first (42mm instead of 46mm) , which make a 300ppi more reasonable."
AndroidWear,3c2mjp,GirLovesWaffles,0,Sat Jul 4 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"If the battery can get me through a day I'm happy. I fully expect to charge it every night, just like I do my phone, and people who expect to get two days out of a smartwatch of this class are just kidding themselves.   The screen on the current Moto 360 is truly awful and is the biggest thing keeping me away from buying one before 2nd Gen. Not only is it not OLED, but the PPI is painfully low and I can very clearly see the pixels. Makes it very obviously look like a screen strapped to your wrist rather than a stylish watch."
AndroidWear,3c2mjp,Kmann1994,3,Sat Jul 4 19:22:16 2015 UTC,"Makes it very obviously look like a screen strapped to your wrist rather than a stylish watch.   I would've thought the GIANT screen that's black 90% of the time makes it look like a screen strapped to your wrist. Or, you know, the GLOWING SCREEN strapped to your wrist makes it look like a screen strapped to your wrist lol  I agree with ppi being an improvement, but there are other factors that make it clear (at least to me) that this is a piece of tech (like the fact that it glows, that the watchface elements will never actually bounce light light a real watch, that to everyone else all they'll see is a black screen on the wrist).   OLED helps, but I think to really fool myself it'd need a fusion of retina plastic oled and color e-paper."
AndroidWear,3c2mjp,GirLovesWaffles,0,Sat Jul 4 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"OLED helps tremendously, especially if you've got a black watch face with minimalistic white hour markers.   Yeah, the glowing gives it away as a screen, but what makes it worse is the fact that that screen is pixelated as hell. It just makes watches and typeface look all the better when the screen looks clear as hell.   Look, all I'm saying is that when I used the Moto 360 in stores, the first thing that made me go ""Ew, no, I'm waiting till 2nd Gen"" was the poor and washed out looking screen and lack of metal lugs protruding from the body to hold the watch band. I do not at all like the look of the band disappearing into the body, and it is THE cause for the widespread back cracking issue."
AndroidWear,3c2mjp,Kmann1994,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:28:18 2015 UTC,On oled screens if you just turn the brightness of the pixel down it had the exact same effect as lowering the screen brightness. As a result I've done a side by side comparison with my friends watch with old fashioned glow in the dark watch hands and I can easily make my gwr dimmer. In fact at night it can be indistinguishable from a real watch and during the day it can still be indistinguishable as the display can go that bright. I do want an app that adjusts my watch screen brightness to based off my phones ALS.
AndroidWear,3c2mjp,scotscott,2,Mon Jul 6 02:08:11 2015 UTC,I won't stop writing angry letters to apple demanding a 10 inch screen with 1000ppi from the next moto 360 until such a thing happens. Maybe I should write whole foods instead.

AndroidWear,3bxphw,GuyInA5000DollarSuit,8,Fri Jul 3 06:50:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that there is a flap that can be left open, or not have a tight seal did and should destroy it's rating for water resistance. Every other watch doesn't need to worry about its configuration for water resistance, there's nothing the user can forget to do on those watches that will compromise them in water."
AndroidWear,3bxphw,denilson3,5,Fri Jul 3 13:23:40 2015 UTC,"I'll take that trade off and the higher IP68 rating that comes along with it.  However, this is something that should be mentioned in the writeup, as the flap is finicky when charging the watch too.  Just have an issue with them rating two of its best differentiators as worse than the other watches."
AndroidWear,3bxphw,mkddy,4,Fri Jul 3 15:28:21 2015 UTC,Every other watch uses a proprietary charging system whereas the SW3 uses a standard micro USB like most phones.  Considering the battery life of most watches I'd rather deal with the flap and be able to charge almost anywhere without carrying around a special dock.
AndroidWear,3bxphw,GuyInA5000DollarSuit,-3,Fri Jul 3 17:13:25 2015 UTC,"Cool story, irrelevant to the conversation of water resistance.  And the Moto 360 is standard wireless charging."
AndroidWear,3bxphw,mkddy,3,Fri Jul 3 17:30:48 2015 UTC,"It's totally relevant.  The flap you're complaining about, that only the SW3 has, is  there because of the micro USB port that no other watch has.    Wireless charging is what's irrelevant.  Most phones that support it don't even ship with a dock, and the 360 only ships with one.  Micro USB ships with everything that has a connector."
AndroidWear,3bxphw,GuyInA5000DollarSuit,-1,Fri Jul 3 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"The point is that it's totally fucking irrelevant to what I said.  You're having a pissy fit about me saying that the USB port is why the SW3 had a worse waterproofing rating than any of the other watches, which it should, considering it's got a freaking door that can be left open and ruins the waterproofing of the watch.  No other watch has that.  Your ideas of what's worth and not worth don't matter in the slightest when we're talking purely about why it got a poorer waterproofing rating."
AndroidWear,3bxphw,mkddy,2,Fri Jul 3 20:44:08 2015 UTC,I don't have the magazine so I can't see the methodology they used for the immersion test but I get your point that no other watches have a similar restriction for waterproofing.  I'm sorry it upsets you so much.

AndroidWear,3bxphw,D1G1T4LM0NK3Y,3,Fri Jul 3 19:12:56 2015 UTC,"Cause GG is not scratch proof. It's smash and crack proof, to an extent. Where as Sapphire is the opposite. Sapphire is extremely scratch proof but only somewhat smash resistant (much less than GG) but Apple was extremely smart in their choice because GG was created for use in larger applications where cracking is the number one issue such as tablets and smart phones. Sapphire on the other hand has been used in watches for over a decade and is still the number one scratch resistant glass available. Because watch faces are so small and more protected from drops and so on GG is essentially a cheap alternative that gives you something neat to say on your advertising but really doesn't do anything special for a watch.  Personally I really hope the next Moto360 has Sapphire."

AndroidWear,3bxphw,ARCHA1C,5,Fri Jul 3 07:31:02 2015 UTC,Bogus.    Just look at the readability rating.   Clearly they didn't actually test every device on these measures.   The SW3 is excellent in sunlight.
AndroidWear,3bxphw,matejdro,6,Sat Jul 4 07:04:22 2015 UTC,"Sony SW3 is perfectly readable in bright light (it has transreflective display). My guess is they just quickly looked at the specs and threw all LCD watches into ""not visible on bright light"" bin? Pebble Steel is perfectly readable in low light (you just have to shake to turn on backlight obviously).  Pebble Steel is very easy to interact with it. I would argue it is even easier than all Android Wear watches (and probably other watches too, but I can't say for them). There are only 3 buttons for god's sake, you can't make that complicated. They were testing ""Ease of Pairing""? Because process you do only once is really the most important thing.   What the hell were they testing?"
AndroidWear,3bxphw,matejdro,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:06:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah a lot of their tests are screwey.  I can see how the Pebble would be harder to use, because the buttons are sometimes less intuitive than swiping through cards and lists."

If not, they display navigation bar with icons that highlight what each button does. I don't see how it can get ANY easier than this.  For touch you don't have clue unless you know the interface. Should you swipe up/down? Does tapping on this do anything?  Touch displays are certainly FASTER to use (you swipe faster than press buttons), but they are not SIMPLER."

AndroidWear,3buz0d,russjr08,3,Thu Jul 2 15:46:04 2015 UTC,So I can control an Xbone with a watch?  That's cool.
AndroidWear,3buz0d,aidotato5,3,Thu Jul 2 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"Is the Xbox One a Google Cast client? I don't believe it is... (I don't have one to test), I guess try opening something like Plex, or Connect Four Quads from the Play Store (the chromecast game), and see if it lets you cast to that."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,russjr08,3,Thu Jul 2 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"I casted Youtube to it using the Google Cast extension for chrome, I'm pretty sure it is.  NINJA EDIT: It might be only for apps on the Xbone like YouTube and Plex."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,aidotato5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think it's a full cast client. If you use Play Music (or Movies & TV), you could try casting that and seeing if it works."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,russjr08,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my Ninja Edit makes more sense.   NINJA EDIT: It might be only for apps on the Xbone like YouTube and Plex."

AndroidWear,3buz0d,thisisaoeu,2,Thu Jul 2 16:21:04 2015 UTC,How can you add a chanel? I'm only able to disable/enable 3 categories. Last watched and two other.

AndroidWear,3buz0d,galorin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:00:25 2015 UTC,"Actually yes, it is."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,bentmachine,27,Thu Jul 2 21:02:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure why the fuss, but I'll be using this while underneath my car following a tutorial on steering rack removal or other places I'd rather  not risk breaking a $600 phone. Moto is cheap enough now that I can have a dress one and a work one :)   Another great use would be in the kitchen learning how to make grits without dropping my phone in the pan again, or accidentally slicing onions on the iPad.  Wrist tech, despite being a bit small, is making my life much much easier."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,RawInfoSec,11,Thu Jul 2 12:16:01 2015 UTC,Especially when you can just cast it to a nearby screen from the watch.
AndroidWear,3buz0d,thisisaoeu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:39:12 2015 UTC,"Not everyone has a big HDTV under the car though. In fact, probably none."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,RawInfoSec,2,Fri Jul 3 12:31:19 2015 UTC,You make me want to get a second G watch for working on cars now. I always take my GWR off because I don't want to scratch it digging in the engine bay.
AndroidWear,3buz0d,DOHCMerc,42,Thu Jul 2 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"The attitude of most Android Wear users is simply idiotic. What do you mean, why. I don't know; maybe it would be cool to watch a short video while waiting in line for your coffee or something."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,terminalreality,35,Thu Jul 2 11:14:21 2015 UTC,I think a better answer is because I can. It's a new technology and we're testing out all the new features and possibilities.
AndroidWear,3buz0d,dahbassface,25,Thu Jul 2 13:48:39 2015 UTC,Haha yea just give me all the apps
AndroidWear,3buz0d,Die4Ever,16,Thu Jul 2 11:34:26 2015 UTC,"I don't get it either. When it comes to cool things like this, ""Why?"" should never be asked. Maybe it's not all that useful right now, but maybe somebody finds a use for it. Or maybe it inspires something else that is useful. Not every new thing is going to be amazing and revolutionary, but if we just decided not to do things because they're not immediately useful we would never progress in technology."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,bagboyrebel,10,Thu Jul 2 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"There are only 9 comments so far (10 with mine) and 1 actually asks why, one is a joke, one complaining about ads, and the rest don't seem negative.    Oh wait, there are 2 complaining about the complaining."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,xilpaxim,2,Thu Jul 2 13:47:06 2015 UTC,"Oh wait, there are 2 complaining about the complaining.   Does that include your comment?"
AndroidWear,3buz0d,iamluke,4,Thu Jul 2 16:52:45 2015 UTC,No. I'm complaining about the comments complaining about the complaining.  Complain-ception.
AndroidWear,3buz0d,xilpaxim,2,Thu Jul 2 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, why.   The problem is that potential smart watch buyers see stuff like this and get an unrealistic idea of what a smart watch will do.  Then, when they get one and the experience doesn't live up to the hype, they complain about what a shitty product smart watches are."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,linuxwes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:46:12 2015 UTC,Outdoor diy tutorials seem fitting for this app.
AndroidWear,3buz0d,Majinferno,5,Thu Jul 2 18:13:41 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a bit of fun, but disappointingly no audio sync via the headphones plugged into my phone. So I assume bluetooth headphones paired to the watch is needed for sound.  While some people may knock it for being low res, it wasn't that long ago realplayer over dialup was a similar size, and YouTube videos were 240p quality. There is a lot of content were the audio gives you most of what you want and video just provides a bit of context."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,whoisrich,9,Thu Jul 2 13:46:50 2015 UTC,Oh it has notifications for ads.... Well I guess I'm blocking those
AndroidWear,3buz0d,Die4Ever,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:40:48 2015 UTC,Looks like its just ads for the app itself ( had one for in app purchases) I think it's fair that a free app advertises itself. These developers don't owe us anything
AndroidWear,3buz0d,danash182,9,Thu Jul 2 14:56:07 2015 UTC,Yea but ads as notifications are really annoying. I'm OK with in app ads but I just can't stand the notifications.
AndroidWear,3buz0d,Die4Ever,9,Thu Jul 2 15:15:54 2015 UTC,"""HEY. YOU ARE NOT USING ME RIGHT NOW SO WHY DON'T YOU BUY MY SHIT ?"" - Yeah, it's fucking annoying."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,Amiral_Adamas,3,Thu Jul 2 15:19:45 2015 UTC,Has this worked for anyone on the moto360. It just keeps loading on mine.  Edit: it's working for me. It just drains the battery even when not in use after a restart.
AndroidWear,3buz0d,simplyswole,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"Same issue here.  Edit: Have rebooted both phone and watch, same thing."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,break_me_down,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"Works fine for me, even got the full version for shiggles"
AndroidWear,3buz0d,MA1203,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, works fine for me with bluetooth headphones."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,dproldan,3,Thu Jul 2 21:15:48 2015 UTC,Awesome. Now can we have Skype for wear?
AndroidWear,3buz0d,dre10g,2,Thu Jul 2 15:26:31 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, how small can they make a video camera, I wonder..."
AndroidWear,3buz0d,Cupajo72,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:25:24 2015 UTC,Rumors are that the sequel to the watch that cannot be named will have a video call camera.
AndroidWear,3buz0d,hannibalhooper14,3,Fri Jul 3 02:45:19 2015 UTC,"As a hacker, I really appreciate whatever challenge there is. And I would really like to congratulate the developer on this achievement. Defying all naysayers and roaring loudly, ""IT CAN BE DONE!!"""

AndroidWear,3byf50,TehFrozenYogurt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:36:02 2015 UTC,Not sure how competent you are with android but you could try flash the Urbane rom and quad core kernel. I get awesome performance and battery life with it. No bugs and it has wifi support. I would never go back to stock personally. http://forum.xda-developers.com/g-watch-r/development/leedroid-r-urbane-port-v1-0-0-june-6th-t3128850

AndroidWear,3byf50,dregan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:58:22 2015 UTC,I think I'm going to return the device. Is it possible to get the Serial Number from my phone? I know it's on the device itself but that might be hard to get. I threw away the paper that had the S/N on the watch.
AndroidWear,3bxqiv,Azathoth624,2,Fri Jul 3 00:51:45 2015 UTC,Yep. Experience this too.  Have not heard of a fix. Not sure how many are experiencing this.  Mine is Lg G watch though.
