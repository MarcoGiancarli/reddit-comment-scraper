It's news and it's interesting news that an informed person would want to know.  Second, whether we like this message or not, the interesting takeaway here for me is that the mediators are not only making a pretty big new effort, they're kind of telling both sides how it's got to be.  Yesterday there was a post that the Armenians must be allowed to vote on their future status.  That we must come to a comprehensive agreement, not a step-by-step.  These were messages that Azerbaijan did not want to hear.  Now the thing is about ""returning"" the 7 regions, is that even so a ""Lachin Corridor"" is agreed to be necessary.  So the question is, how large will that be to ensure security of the corridor?  Also, what about all the Armenians of Shahumyan that were deported by Azerbaijan?  What happens to them?  It bothers me that their situation and the fate of those lands seem never to be discussed.  That was a part of Karabakh, regardless of whether the Soviets disconnected it.  The borders should be reconsidered so that either Shahumyan is attached to Karabakh, or traded for either say Kelbajar or Lachin or Zangelan."

Another issue is this idea that LTP's inane plan to give away Meghri (and thereby Armenia's border with Iran) to Azerbaijan so that it has a border with Nakhijevan be revived. It seems that as the years go by, Azerbaijan's bargaining position weakens which in my opinion explains the extra bombastic rhetoric."

armenia,3dz4g8,ParevArev,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:11 2015 UTC,"Hey brother. The reason why there are differences in spelling Der Hovaghimian and Ter Hovakimyan is because there are two dialects of Armenian that use different orthography. These are Eastern and Western Armenian. Eastern Armenian is predominately spoken in the Republic of Armenia, Iran, Georgia, and Russia. Western Armenian is spoken throughout the diaspora in places like Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Europe, etc. Der Hovaghimian is typically Western transliteration, and Ter Hovakimyan is typically Eastern transliteration. If your's is originally Der Hovaghimian, chances are that your family comes from Western Armenia, aka present day Eastern Turkey."

armenia,3dzejn,ashbourne10,7,Mon Jul 20 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"Great question.  1) Genocide 2) Soviet pogroms  3) Soviet Union 4) Middle East disarray  The Genocide was the big one. It killed off loads of the best and the brightest. The Soviet pogroms did the rest (people like Charents, Yesayan, and others). Then the USSR essentially wiped clean the minds of the remaining intellectuals and replaced whatever they had going on up there with Soviet/pro-Russian drivel. National identity would always somehow creep in, though, from Aram Khachatrian to Sergey Parajanov to several famous scientists.   The final step, although more drawn-out and less discernible, is the total unrest throughout the Middle East over the past 50 years. It cleaned out any intellectuals from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran, where Armenians had quite the reputation, as you noted. With the Iranian Revolution, most of those well-to-do ones left.   Most of these dispersed went to the US or France where it was more difficult to be the big dog because they were the top countries in the world, as opposed to some of these less developed (comparatively) places they were coming from, and they had even smaller numbers than they had before.   Nevertheless, they've still done pretty good for themselves given the circumstances. For the tiny percentage Armenians make up of whatever society they live in, they have a hugely disproportionate representation in every field, from politics to science to entertainment to sports."
armenia,3dzejn,pilisopa,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"Where did the rich or intellectual elite of the Ottoman Armenians mostly live? Were they mostly in Western Armenia or in cities like Istanbul? Were the rich one's more likely to be killed? Do you really believe it had a kind of dysgenic effect on the Armenian population?   It seems to me that the Armenians of the Arab world are not that much better off then the local Arabs, just based on what others have told me. I went to school with an Armenian guy from Palestine though, his family was wealthy (I went to an expensive private school, and he was foreign so had to pay more) and he was a very good student, getting into one of the best universities in the UK. Are the Armenians of Lebanon and Syria what you'd call a 'market dominant minority', or are they just average?   The whole change in socioeconomic status of Armenians just seems so strange to me."
armenia,3dzejn,mojuba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:57 2015 UTC,"While I totally agree with the rest of your answer, but this:   For the tiny percentage Armenians make up of whatever society they live in, they have a hugely disproportionate representation in every field, from politics to science to entertainment to sports.   How can this be even measured? Because honestly areas and genres of arts I'm a big fan of, Armenians are underrepresented today, or put simply are almost non-existent. That includes virtually all genres of music, cinematography, also technology and to an extent sciences.  It's a very subjective thing to judge whether we are successful or not on the international scene, or in any given foreign country. But we definitely used to be doing well in the USSR. For example, if I can name say 5 or 6 Soviet film directors that I like, 4 of them would be Armenian, so I'm even a bit biased positively. But honestly, again, today our presence in technology, sciences and arts seems to be so insignificant.  Seriously, whom are we comparing ourselves to?"
armenia,3dzejn,pilisopa,4,Mon Jul 20 21:09:59 2015 UTC,"If you take the most liberal estimate of how many Armenians there are in the United States - 1 million (although when it comes to self-identifying Armenians, it's far, far less than that) - they still make up less than .3% of America's population. However, there are at least two Armenian congresswomen, the largest state in the country has had an Armenian governor, Reagan's speechwriter was Armenian, etc. In entertainment: Kim K, Cher, SOAD, Sebu Simonian, Steve Zaillian, Roger Kupelian. In sports: Andre Agassi, Eric Boghosian, Tim Kurkjian, Garo Yepremian. In science and tech: Raymond Damadian, all these guys, /u/kn0thing, Raffi Krikorian. In business: Kirk Kerkorian, the Hovnanians, the Zildjians, Alec Manoogian, Mark Hoplamazian. In journalism: Nick Kristof, Scout Tufankjian, Lara Setrakian.  Many others in these fields and many more in other fields.   As for who to compare ourselves to, I'd say any minority in America. Filipinos, Koreans, Arabs, Hmong, Cambodians, or Jews, or blacks. No doubt in absolute terms some of these guys blow Armenians out of the water but in relative terms, the only ones that come close or surpass them are probably the Jews. Even then, let's remember the difference in circumstance: Armenians only started establishing large communities in the US in the late 1800s/early 1900s, unlike the Jews who had communities before then. Also, Jews, besides having the communities in the US, because the Germans didn't kill off all of the intellectuals immediately (sometimes for the sick and twisted reason that they thought the smart ones could be used before being killed), were able to escape or leave before the Holocaust killing became even more severe. Almost all Armenian intellectuals, as we know, were roundly killed from the get-go. The escapees/refugees were mostly uneducated villagers from the east of the Empire. You've got a harder climb when you start from 0 as opposed to being a faculty member at a European university like Einstein was.   In any case, without getting much more into it, it might seem insignificant (and it's hard to notice) but Armenians' positions in the US and other parts of the western world are impressive given the history before today and their tiny numbers."
armenia,3dzejn,farquier,2,Mon Jul 20 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"Minor nitpick-while the American Jewish community does go back a long ways, to 1654 when the first Sephardim arrive in New York(and the congregation they founded is still in existence today) almost all American Jews today descend from the wave of immigrants fleeing eastern Europe from around 1880-1920 and not many Jews fled to the US from Hitler largely  because of quota restrictions and a lack of refugee visas encouraged by nativist anti-immigrant sentiments*.   *The State Department being a notorious warren of antisemitism even by those standards didn't help either."

armenia,3dzejn,jkalay,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:20 2015 UTC,"Well I mean Armenians were very prominent in Constantinople/Istanbul. Half of it was probably built by Armenians and the Ottoman royal family only employed Armenian architects to build their palaces. They did get most of their rewards because they enjoyed greater wealth and standard of living relative to other ethnicities in the Ottoman Empire (just based on what I've read).  Surely suffering a tragedy would motivate you further, no? Jews suffered genocide but they still returned to their former role as a great economic and intellectual force.   Based on what Armenians were historically like even up until 60 years ago you'd also think Armenia would be a very developed country, whereas it's not really any different to the other former Soviet republics in the Caucasus, even though they were always known to be a lot smarter and successful than the Azeris and Georgians."
armenia,3dzejn,FemaleInfidel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"I would argue that there are more ""rich or intellectual"" Armenians now than ever before but many are assimilated.  The majority of the Armenian populations in the Ottoman, Persian, and Russian empires were rural and uneducated. The quality of life in the Ararat Valley and Anatolia was at times comparable to Afghanistan.  The decline in influence in the Middle East has to do with circumstances beyond their control. Even so, it was less than ten years ago that Lebanon, for example, had a president of Armenian descent. Also, I would challenge your assertion that Armenians were the Jews of Asia during the imperial period. The Jews were the Jews of Asia and their influence within countries like Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Syria, etc. not only declined but became non-existent for obvious reasons. Israel, however, is influential indeed.  Russia is probably the place where you can find prominent Armenians in almost every sphere. This is unsurprising since it is the largest diaspora community. The country's foreign minister and the director of the Hermitage are half Armenian, the editor-in-chief of RT is a Russian-Armenian woman, and that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. Empire can have perks for its minority subjects but they're also often the first to get blamed and targeted during times of crisis and tumult."

After shunning a deal with the EU, US aid remains its only bridge to the West  Therefore, if we cut US aid it it will help Armenia become a sovereign nation.

Theres events over by Cascade/Cafesjian area, Theres a restaurant in Republic Sq that does shows, I think, theres Pandok that does shows on I think only Friday and Saturday, but I could have the dates messed up. Their website had more info about times, days, etc, if thats something you want to look into. Then the opera house also has information online on an events calendar page.

Theoretically this should start a chain reaction that, among other things, should affect the state of democracy in Armenia. Because the current incompetent, totally clueless and corrupt government won't be able to handle the coming economic and political shifts. Maybe I'm being too optimistic, but I think a slowly-surely change within, say, 5 years is inevitable."
armenia,3df178,mojuba,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:29:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. If Armenia can became a major transit country between East and West via Iran, it would mean a major economic boon. My hope has always been for a more competent government to take hold that consists of home-grown talent or foreign born Armenians that have their country's best interests at heart and are not beholden to anyone.   All of this also means that we will see an even more rapid weakening of Azerbaijani geopolitical influence. That, coupled with their economic decline, may lead straight to war."
armenia,3df178,pilisopa,3,Wed Jul 15 22:26:48 2015 UTC,"Although Iran is the source, the biggest news here is about China and India. Two massive economies that have largely avoided Iran because of the sanctions. The North-South Highway in Armenia is being partially financed by the Asian Development Bank as a potential transit point and, as this article mentions, the possibility of the Southern Armenian Railway is a great prospect for Armenia. Remains to be seen but nestled between AfPak and ISIS-land, Iran and Armenia are relatively stable overland transit points."
armenia,3df0b3,garenzy,2,Wed Jul 15 19:26:18 2015 UTC,"I have heard varying things about going through Russia.  I myself am not armenian, but have gotten the ""two cents"" of some friends of mine who are from Armenia originally and now live in the states. One is very, very uneasy about Russia (despite speaking russian fluently, what I would have assumed would take away any trepidation) and the other takes the Russia way without complaints (although the last time that person travelled that way was 5 years ago, things could have changed.)  Personally, I would reccomend pairs or vienna because neither of those countries require a visa so theres no way you can fall into a visa trap. (again, not sure what the liklihood that would happen with russia). The downside, though, is the cost and the frequency of flights. Russia has the most flights, vienna has an ok amount, and paris has the least amount. Also, the chances of you getting a hell of a layover in Vienna are pretty high. Tickets will also run 600$ more.  Good luck on your first trip. Armenia is a place you just are compelled to return to again and again. Have fun."

The service on Aeroflot was actually pretty good, the flights comfortable, and the food enjoyable. But Sheremetyevo was a terrible airport: grumpy workers, indoor smoking allowed, no AC.

Also, if Iranians have more money to spend and invest, undoubtedly some of that is going to spill over into Armenia.  While I agree that it will move Iran and Armenia closer to the west economically, I doubt it will change the geopolitical arrangement very much. Turkey and Azerbaijan are still allied with Israel. I don't think the Russia-Armenia-Iran alliance is going to be weakened by this at all.

With other asian pacific economies being able to match manufacturing prices in China, the chinese will use their geographic ownership to their advantage, they have the edge on distribution once an effective railroad is complete. Railroads may seem like 19th century economics but I guarentee high speed commercial rail will be the thread which ties large expansive countries with small economies together. The BRICS bank may well give one of their first loans to Armenia to help develop the railroad which could mean jobs for Armenians.   Take a lesson from Canada's History in the 19th century. For a long time it seemed enevadable that the U.S. would continue to asborb more and more states and eventually all of North America, they even called it, ""Manifest Destiny"" like it was fate. But a Scotish guy named John A. MacDonald gets the bright idea to create a new nation soverign of the U.S. and loyal to it's British parlimentry system and equality to French Catholics and English Protestants. From the start they had Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia....what you may notice on a map is all that land in between. No one really lived there. It was no mans land. At the same time there was a huge problem of a 'brain drain' and economic drain of money leaving the provinces to the U.S, so much comerce ran North and South because there were no other altenratives to getting goods to market and vis versa. But MacDonald had a plan, build a railroad running east to west and it worked! Like a thread tieing a nation of small local economies together commerce began to run east to west competing with the north to south.  So this may be the 21st century but we still need large quanitities of stuff to maintain our growing consumer lives! Hope you won't discount the power of a railroad, it can make nations...end history lesson  Also does anyone else think that the Iranian agreement is connected to events to georgia?"

What Russia can do is give them weapons that makes them more threatening, but even in that case it's not in their interest to ""make us lose Karabakh"".  Now back to the issue at hand which driften from when comming up with other issues. So my comment wasn't even serious but if you want to seriously discuss this. Then I 'll point out that opening of the Abkhazian railway is also very favorably to Russia. Armenia just telling Russia, Georgia will agree to open this railway if they back down will likely enough incentive to do so."

armenia,3czf89,That_Armenian_Guy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:54:52 2015 UTC,I will comment in the morning with useful information! I am on my phone now but check tomorrow
armenia,3czf89,garmirsar,2,Sun Jul 12 05:41:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, so there are helpful apps that you can use, like money converters and what not.  I suggest trying to learn Armenian, but it will not matter in terms of getting ripped off.  I speak fluently, but I look like a tourist, so they try haha.   Here are my suggestions from my recent trip:   You should suspend your phone service so you don't pay for it while you are in Armenia.  For about 10 USD, you can get a month of cell phone service with 3g internet in Armenia from Vivacell.  Very useful, as you just switch out your sim card.  This way, you and your husband can both have a means of communication if seperated. Walk all around Yerevan your first day.  Just get to know the place.  It will really help in the next few days.  Also, the minimum taxi fare is 600 dram, which is about 1.2 USD.  600 dram usually covers up to 4km, and every km after that is 100 dram.  Basically anywhere in Yerevan won't be more than 1,000 dram. As u/garmirsar said, (the username is pretty cool, it means red mountain btw), you can get a taxi that takes you to a bunch of places outside yerevan as well.  I too have a relative that drives, he speaks Armenian though, but he is very knowledgable.  The tour places like spyurk are expensive, but it may be your only option for English speakers.  For example, Yerevan to Edjmiadzin (where the oldest church in Armenia is), is about 2500 to 3000 dram.  For a trip to Sevan Lake, Dilijan, and back to Yerevan, it would be between $30-50 dollars for the day.  Try to go to places that are close together, too, like Sardarabad, Ararat Valley, places like that.   I have a list of good restaurants.  KFC is really good there, it sucks in America for example.  You will eat a lot.  Menu.am is a great site that delivers food for $1.  If you want a quick list pm me. Don't try to see everything.  If you are there for a month, see Yerevan, Tatev, Sardarabad, Edjmiadzin, Gyumri, Garni, Geghard, Tsitsernakaberd, Cascade.  Those are your main spots for a quick look around.  Trying to go everywhere becomes really tiring. The driving there is terrible.  Seriously.  Think of the dangerous driving in NYC by cabbies, and that is everyone and then some.  You might get used to it, but probably not.  Just a heads up. Museums are cool, but they made me sad cuz of the condition they keep many things in.  No humidors, open cases, so the items will be destroyed in 50 years.  Just a heads up, it really took me back. Have fun.  Bed and Breakfasts are cool there, usually 10 USD per person per night.  Also, remember that you can post on this sub for any questions of help while you are there."
armenia,3czf89,That_Armenian_Guy,2,Sun Jul 12 19:56:23 2015 UTC,You forgot Noravank as a place to see! I'm partial since my family is from near there.

armenia,3czf89,garmirsar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:34:46 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'll try to answer as much as I can based off my own experience. First off the main languages seem to be Russian and Armenian and even then they spoke a different dialect than I (Eastern, Western) but its not that hard to guess what they're saying using context clues. The newer generations seem to be learning English but that was pretty rare with older people. As a tourist you should always watch out for scams and know how much the currency is worth otherwise some might try to charge you more for certain services. Everything is pretty inexpensive for foreigners but the prices are relatively the same for them because the average wage is low. You won't have much trouble touring Yerevan on your own but if you plan on exploring the rest of the country you'll probably need a driver or a tour guide. Hope that help. If you have any more questions feel free to ask!"
armenia,3czf89,Loqsha,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:50:39 2015 UTC,"To find a place, airbnb works great. To eat, there are plenty of cafés and restaurants serving food from the Caucasus. Armenian could help, but people speak/understand English. Find a chauffeur (it's generally very affordable - $30/day) to take you outside Yerevan. I can give you my friend's info (who's a chauffeur) if need be. Go south to Noravank and Tatevi Vank. Or north to Dilijan. In Yerevan, I'd suggest visiting the following museums: Sergey Paradjanov's house, Aram Khatchatourian's house, Martiros Saryan's atelier, Cascade, National Art Museum at Republic Square and the Matenadaran. The last Friday of every month in the spring and summer, people gather at the base of Cascade to dance traditional Armenian dances together... definitely a fun time."

Echo/feedback cancellation needs improvement, Skype does the job better here.  Their other claim is that it uses less bandwidth, but it would be a bit difficult to measure and compare.  Will use it a bit more, but the first impression is that it's just another Skype/Viber, nothing truly innovative. Will it take off, considering that apps like this require a critical mass of users in order not to die soon?  Another drawback: no PC/Mac version, just iOS/Android.

I don't think so. He's shown his hatred for Armenians so why should he be in a sub that's literally all about Armenians?
armenia,3cq4l6,ShadowsTail,2,Fri Jul 10 08:02:12 2015 UTC,"why should he be in a sub that's literally all about Armenians?   Because this is reddit and there are no borders here. Each comment is judged in its own right and if it breaks any rules, mods may take action."

There are some more of course.)  On the lyrics: I know nothing about the Hamsheni language, but ti sounds like a mix of Armenian and Turkish (or something else? - can't say). For example this line:  Lusnika erand kişer  is probably about the moon at night, though I don't know what ""erand"" means."

The Open Skies Policy has decreased ticket prices significantly and has allowed for greater airline traffic, which usually leads to lower prices.   It's great that the government is charging tax that'll allow to increase its revenue. If it didn't, I bet this same guy would be railing against the government for not charging a high enough tax and leaving revenue on the table."

Is he going to invest in Karabagh or just play an orthodox nationalist milkmaid? Should we be worried about this or be happy? What if Russia requests Sterligov's extradition - now this is going to be funny, because formally Karabagh is not Armenia, and is not recognized as a sovereign country neither by Russia nor Armenia. What if other questionable personalities follow suit?"
armenia,3cjmj3,mojuba,2,Wed Jul 8 14:13:32 2015 UTC,Good points. It would definitely not be helpful for NKR to gain a reputation as a hideout for fugitives.   There was already a lot of suspicion at one point that Ocalan and other PKK personalities were hiding out there.

Speaking at an “informal dialogue” of European Partnership ministers in Minsk on June 29, he said Armenia wanted to be part of the EU’s COSME programme, aimed at boosting small and medium-sized businesses, and Horizon 2020, an 80 billion euro research and innovation fund.      “Signing an agreement with the EU, or even having preferential trade terms with it, isn’t enough to mean that Armenian goods will storm the European market,” Mikael Melkumyan, an economist and member of parliament for the opposition Prosperous Armenian party, told IWPR. “Moreover, the EU is currently trying to open up new markets for its own goods, and is reducing the euro’s exchange rate to do this."

The police there don't follow up very well, and the databases aren't too great, as many family members also talk about tickets being lost in databases and what not.    If you are thinking of visiting, I would suggest either revoking Armenian citizenship or calling the Armenian embassy just to make sure, since grey areas in the second world are unstable situations.    I have a similar issue with Iran, as my Dad fought in their military, I should be exempt, but I am in a grey area for that, so I haven't gone to Iran since I've been 18."

armenia,3c9yuz,lezvaban,2,Tue Jul 7 21:13:11 2015 UTC,Translation app? That's still state of the art my friend. Google still has flaws when translating major western and central European languages. Do you want to fully translate articles or is this meant to assist you in reading them quicker? As continued practice in reading the original language will resolve the latter.

armenia,3c8vth,arronsky,3,Mon Jul 6 05:47:41 2015 UTC,"Russia brilliantly playing both sides. If true, just a loss leader to Armenia to goad Azerbaijan into buying 10x more weaponry to compete (at full price). Azeri's can't attack or turn to the West for fear of losing their infrastructure, Armenians remain dependent on Russia for security blanket and add another $200M+interest in debt.

If enough people refused to pay, it would force their hand.  I'm not sure what purpose Baghramyan is serving at this point. There's practically no one there. When people look at Baghramyan and see it empty, it actually makes the movement look like it's weak and has lost support. It's more harm than good at this point IMO."

After months they gave up. Now this is a bit different, one of the most important streets of Yerevan is closed. I think the government is going to use the people who use that street everyday to put pressure, to have it open again. There were also reports coming from the protestors that the police was asking the neighborhs if they wanted to file a noise complaint. Once they open the street this whole thing is over."

At least in the case of Yerevan protests."

They have a huge team of photographers that need to be paid, camera equipment is also not cheep. No one is going to buy photos from some boring government meeting, but these protest photos are highly valuable. In any case they have the watermarks on all of their photo's and I really don't it as a huge deal... perhaps I got used to them."

armenia,3bvx7v,mojuba,4,Thu Jul 2 16:15:45 2015 UTC,How is Ukraine's so low?
armenia,3bvx7v,derzhal,5,Thu Jul 2 17:43:15 2015 UTC,because
armenia,3bvx7v,baconbitz0,2,Fri Jul 3 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"This is the avg wages, Ukirane's GDP per capita is still higher than Armenia's, just FIY."
armenia,3bvx7v,bokavitch,2,Fri Jul 3 02:14:42 2015 UTC,What I think ElectricYerevan is really slowly tapping into is putting a spotlight on average wage.   Canadians are charged 0.15 cents a kilowatt hour (At our consumption rate for a 4 family home a little less then $150 CAD a month)   Armenia: 0.11 euros a kilowatt hour (0.14 CAD a month)  (229 euros a month = $318 CAD!!!)  At almost the same Kilowatt hour it's no wonder people are on the streets.   HALF   of the average wage of an Armenian is going to the monthly Hydro bill. Families have to pool their resources to just scrape by with such a low income and 1st world utility costs.
armenia,3bvx7v,baconbitz0,3,Fri Jul 3 01:55:30 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the average Armenian household consumes way less energy than a Canadian or American one.  Still a significant expense for them though.
armenia,3bvx7v,pilisopa,2,Fri Jul 3 02:43:32 2015 UTC,"True but the fact is Armenians are paying a comparable rate per kilowatt/hour to a country like Canada, who has smart meters on every building (so you can use energy on off peak hours) and has a pritty good energy distribution system. I'm sure Armenians would be using more energy if it were cheaper..."
armenia,3bvx7v,pilisopa,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"Wages on their own are poor indicators of economic well-being without a cost-of-living adjustment. That is, Armenians might be making significantly less than Germans but they are paying $0.20 for a bottle of water and Germans are paying $4."
armenia,3bvx7v,pilisopa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:52:54 2015 UTC,"€0.29 vs. €1.69 for a bottle of water to be precise. Notice also the local purchasing power in Yerevan is 4 times lower than in Düsseldorf, Germany.  I don't think I ever asked you this (and you can ignore it if you want to) - do you live in Armenia?"
armenia,3bvx7v,pilisopa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's relevant but why do you ask?  Anyway, when you want to talk about purchasing power, it might make more sense to compare to a comparable country rather than to the most powerful economy in Europe to make your point. For example, Georgia, which has a lower purchasing power than Armenia."
armenia,3bvx7v,derzhal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:18:42 2015 UTC,"Why I'm asking, because if you live in Honolulu you can't get a good grasp of what life is like in Tibet. Basically you can see all kinds of extreme views among the Armenians living abroad, both Diasporan and former Hayastantsi: it's either ""Armenia is a shithole"" or ""my beautiful prosperous Motherland"". Both are wrong, but that's what you get if you are out of touch: you are wrong.  As for economic indicators, all numbers are lying in the end, of course. What's more interesting than the absolute current numbers though is the dynamic. Georgia's economy shows stable year by year growth. Because they are on the path to realizing their potential, while Armenia is not. We have the potential to be wealthier, but instead we are stagnant in all respects: politically, economically, socially, with no hope in sight. The forecast for this year's economic growth was changed from -1% to 0%, cool, eh? It's an achievement, we will have 0% growth! Great, considering one third of the population is below the official poverty line, and will remain there the year after, essentially says the forecast.  Anyway, who am I talking to? Pilisopa, who doesn't even believe in corruption in Armenia."
armenia,3bvx7v,pilisopa,0,Mon Jul 6 14:05:49 2015 UTC,"Your mischaracterizations are unfortunate because they blind you to the error of your ways. You have the same problem so many others do and that is to be so convinced of your righteousness that you cannot bring yourself to believe there is any other way. In this mindset, reason is secondary. For example, the way the economy works is that it goes up and down. Armenia has had some great years and now it is having not so great years. I'm sorry to break it to you but constant growth is impossible. But, basic principles of economics are secondary to people like you: ""OMG!!!! Armenia will have 0% growth this year! OMG!!!! Look at Georgia!!! Why can't we be more like Georgia????""'  We've been hearing about Georgia's ""path"" for 10 years yet little has changed. The people are in a worse economic situation than in Armenia, their emigration is as bad if not worse, and they, despite all the hoopla, are turning slowly back to Russia. edit: corruption is also rampant.  It's interesting that you give the example of Tibet and Honolulu especially since you post so many pieces of information where the benchmarks used to measure the well-being of Armenia is based on factors determined by people not in Armenia.   That said, I'll assume you live in Armenia and that's why you feel so confident about dismissing another's opinion when they don't agree with you (even though you use the opinion's of other's who don't live there when they agree with yours)."
armenia,3bvx7v,pilisopa,2,Mon Jul 6 14:20:20 2015 UTC,"Well, except when it comes to corruption there can be no second opinion for anyone who lives in Armenia or who's had some real-life experience beyond Garni-Geghard-Khor Virap tourist trip. One word: it's rampant. There is virtually nothing that you can't do with money in Armenia, unless you hit head to head someone who has more money than you do. That's the only exception when corruption doesn't work for you: it's when it works better for someone else. Kickbacks from govt. contracts (the most ""innocent"" type of corruption) is so ubiquitous that people will laugh at you if you, as an official don't request a kickback from a contract you sign on behalf of the government.  This is the key to understanding modern Armenia: the state is malfunctioning, the justice system is corrupt, and there is zero trust among the general population towards the state. We know we can do much better, we deserve better, but the whole thing is in stagnation. I'm not even talking about the basic rights and freedoms, freedom of speech, transparent elections etc.  So what does it mean to live in Armenia? Among other things, it means knowing each MP's criminal nickname, their criminal background, knowing that their vocabulary is limited to some 400-500 mostly jargon words, and knowing how each of them exploits the Parliament for protecting their business interests, mostly monopolies (e.g. sugar import is MP Poghos, wheat import is MP Petros, etc.). That's what it means, for example."
armenia,3bvx7v,Urartu_TH,-1,Mon Jul 6 17:11:37 2015 UTC,"The problem of low-quality representatives in government is a problem in democracies. That's because government officials are not paid as much as in the private world so a person with a top of the line education and skills will usually opt for the private sector. There are exceptions, of course, but it's inevitable. Actually, every successful democracy has really terrible representatives.  As for protecting business interests, please don't be naive. You're one of those people enamored with how things work in other places yet I wonder whether you actually think that that doesn't happen elsewhere.   Finally, you naturally ignore the fact that there is rampant corruption in Georgia and try to prove something which is untrue in Armenia. You need to pay to get anything done in Armenia? Yes, most things require payment as in a capitalist system. But, for areas which have formalized a payment system, corruption is low or nonexistent. Keep in mind, also, that the citizenry is as guilty as the bribe-takers. Even though a driver who breaks the law can get a ticket and pay it, he might opt to pay off the police officer. It is no less the police officer's fault but it's certainly not only the police officer's fault.  ""Kickbacks from contracts"" - your naivety knows no bounds. Whether or not you live in Armenia, you've obviously lived in America or another English-speaking country. Pray look at systems, including how contracts are distributed, in other countries as scrupulously as you look at Armenia's before you continue your doom and gloom approach based on the precept that Armenia is some exceptionally terrible place."

These are not fluctuations you are talking about. A 7 year span in economics is called a trend.

In Armenia, people generally don't like it but they also dont care much for it apart from the real extremists etc like anywhere in the world. I know most people from Armenia dont like gay people but they don't care much for them either and dont protest against it.  As for that, people should do whatever the fuck they want and you should be able to think of being gay as bad but you should not be able to take the right of people being gay away from them.  TL;DR: less accepting than the west but they don't care, and you shouldn't either."

Maybe having someone like Ruben Vardanyan buy the company is the best-case scenario. I don't trust the government to do a better job by nationalizing it.
armenia,3bhv6z,bokavitch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:50:04 2015 UTC,"How can you trust one oligarch more than an oligarchic government? The government is at least accountable to the people, and is also theoretically replaceable, while a single Russian oligarch is not."
armenia,3bhv6z,Urartu_TH,3,Mon Jun 29 12:34:51 2015 UTC,"It's dangerous to baselessly deride someone as an ""oligarch"" simply because they were educated enough and smart enough to amass that wealth. Someone such as Ruben Vardanyan (started 100 lives) is a well-respected member of the financial community in Russia and an Armenian patriot. I'd trust him over any political party currently in Armenia."

armenia,3bhv6z,derzhal,4,Mon Jun 29 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"I understand your point, but Ruben Vartan is not just a random foreign citizen.  He has put literally hundreds of millions of dollars into Armenia, from his own wealth, that he amassed through the stock market (unlike most Armenian millionaires that stole from the people).  He even built a school in Dilijan and created the cable cars in Tatev (all cable car profits go to the nearby village by Tatev as well).  He can not be tainted, unlike the government."
armenia,3bhv6z,mpogho,3,Mon Jun 29 19:39:51 2015 UTC,This is my attitude exactly. I have more faith in a competent and proven private actor than I do placing my hope in some idealized form of public service that we can never expect to exist in reality with the government.

ANC stole elections in 1996, recently staged multiple ""protests"" that bordered on armed revolution and have a maniacal leader in LTP--can't trust them. Tsarukyan's party is nothing more than a congregation of thugs--can't trust them. Heritage party? Unfortunately they don't seem to have any chance at parliamentary majority.  Various industry in the US and many parts of Western Europe are dominated by the private citizen patriots of those nations.   I'd trust Ruben Vardanyan over most of the imbecile politicians in Armenia today. Furthermore, when has ANY Armenian government, since the fall, listened to the will of the people.

Not that I agree with any of the points trying to be made anyway... but pretty sure that person when talking about Circassian and Balkan genocide against muslims was referring to 18th century russian empire stuff.  Europe.. and the rest of the world has been WAY more sympathetic to the cause of the genocide of muslims in the Balkans as of recent history than Armenian, Assyrian, Kurd or Greek Genocide. I dont even see how someone in touch with reality could not come to that conclusion.  Serbians have been pretty damn vilified for what happened during the Balkan wars.. even though massacres happened from all sides/religions. So to say Europe has been biased toward favoring Christians is pretty disagreeable.  But moving forward...

armenia,3bibww,wdk60659,3,Mon Jun 29 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"During  and prior to 1915, the ""Turks"" in Turkey were people who descendants of people who were forced to convert to Islam. They had no connection to ""Turks"" from central Asia. Take me for example. I have Serbian, Greek, Albanian, Russian, Jewish and possibly Armenian ancestors. (Still researching whether I have Armenian ancestors, and have not found any concrete evidence unlike the other ethnicities in my family). My great-grandfather and grandmother on the other hand died around the region where there were death marches in 1915. Did they die in a death march? Were they Armenians? I currently have no clue if this is the case. Other Turks have similar stories like mine."

What I inferred is you were saying Turks can be blamed for the Genocide because there is no Turks? I'm still confused. I think most of us that are knowledgable about the region are well aware that ""Turks"" referring to people that racially identify as Turkish is more of a melting pot race. Just like someone who calls themselves American in terms of being from the USA.  If you're logic is what I THINK you are trying to say, and again, I'm not trying to attack you, I agree with some of the things you say but I'm trying to see your motive here, perhaps I shouldn't have gotten aggressive with my nazi germany comparisons?  But anyway, This is like saying that Americans are not responsible for war crimes committed by the US Military in Vietnam because the soldiers doing it are actually originally ethnically English, Scottish, German, Dutch, Polish, Irish, Italian, etc. It seems like you are using wacky semantics like this to defend Turkish ""not having a role"" in the Armenian Genocide. You are thinking of Turkic as solely a race and not a Social/Cultural/Political identity which is DEFINITELY the identity one is referring to when talking in terms of Turkey/Ottoman Empire. Does that make any sense?"
armenia,3bibww,wdk60659,0,Mon Jun 29 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"what I'm getting at is what does this mean in terms of the genocide? What I inferred is you were saying Turks can be blamed for the Genocide because there is no Turks? I'm still confused.    Maybe you should re-read what I wrote in OP. I did not say ""Turks cannot be blamed for genocides because there is no Turk"".  I simply explained in dept of how the genocide""S"" (mind you, there were in actuality 3 genocides, not 1) happend and by whom.  Anatolians, who cannot identify themselves with anything else because the population in that region (Anatolia) have been totally mixed in tens of thousands of years, had literally nothing to do with all those genocides.  All three (maybe even more?) genocides have been done by some nationalistic groups of people that seeked their own lands, which have been promised by British Empire.  And those nationalistic groupd of people are, afaik, Armenians, Kurds and Assyrians.  And again, I don't know whether or not Assyrians massacred anyone. Maybe they genocided Arabs? Who knows..  Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkey, created this ""Turkishness"", and it was just used to identify Anatolians. Because the ""Anatolians"" had no name to be identified back then. They were indeed ""Anatolians"", but that word has never been called for any ethnicity.  And because Ataturk knew that nationalism was just going to be more and more powerful and effective, ""Anatolians"" needed a nationalism as well. They (we) were Byzantinians. We then became Selchuks, then became Ottomans.  But none of them were ""nationalistic"". All of those nations were ""imperialistic"". They were Empires.  And Anatolians could not just call themselves ""Greek"" or ""Armenian"" or ""Georgian"" or ""Russian"" etc.. Because it was a mix of all of them.  That is why the ""Turkishness"" has been created and used to identify the Anatolian nation.  It is not because the nation had anything to do with Turkicness from the middle asia."

armenia,3bf1ym,derzhal,7,Mon Jun 29 15:42:40 2015 UTC,It's people protesting against the shitty and incompetent and corrupt rule that this country is under. It only looks like discontent against Russia because Russia practically owns this country. We don't like being a vassal to Russia but we have no choice thanks to our aggressive and warmongering neighbors(one of whom is supplied weapons by Russia).
armenia,3bf1ym,derzhal,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:47:40 2015 UTC,"Would Armenians prefer to be vassals of Western interests instead? That's a serious question. IMO, nothing good can come from Armenia falling to Western influence, and I say this as a Canadian."
armenia,3bf1ym,bokavitch,4,Sun Jun 28 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"If you seriously think Russian influence is any way positive for a countries growth then you haven't tried living in a country that had a failed, oppressive economic system imposed on it for 70 years.  Almost every country under western influence in Europe (yes including Greece) is a prosperous utopia compared to Armenia. I'd say even the countries in Latin America are.    Boy what a prosperous group of friends Russia has.   Do you ever wonder why Russia had to send in troops to Hungary and Czechoslovakia to prevent them from leaving the Eastern Block? Do you ever wonder why so many countries joined NATO so eagerly? Or why Russia had to build a freaking wall to prevent people under its rule from leaving?  It's because Russian influence is extremely influence and harmful to a nation's sovereignty in a way that the west's influence isn't. Take a look at Ukraine - As soon as they act out against Moscow's interests, Moscow sends in the tanks. Lukashenko was so afraid of Russian tanks in his own country that he began demanding Belarussian finally be taught in his schools, and began carefully drifting away from Putin. And then there's Georgia - also got invaded. The baltic states very quickly joined NATO to prevent a Russian invasion of their own countries.  That's the thing about ""NATO encroachment"" that Putin likes to complain about. NATO doesn't force countries join. Countries join NATO because they're afraid of uninvited Russian vacationers showing up in their backyards.   In the post world war 2 era, has America had to send troops into a European country to keep their leaders in line? Fuck no. Nations like France and Hungary and Turkey can repeatedly tell NATO off with zero consequence. Ukraine tried that once and is now fighting a war."
armenia,3bf1ym,derzhal,6,Sun Jun 28 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"When the Iranians wanted America out, the CIA went in and engaged in a coup to reinstall the Shah, who was absolutely brutal. I've traveled to Egypt and other puppet regimes of America and that relationship can be every bit as damaging as the relationship with Russia.    America has nothing to gain from Armenia, they won't give anything to Armenia in exchange for its support.  Armenia isn't wrong to have a close relationship with Russia, it just needs competent leadership that is willing to act in Armenia's interest instead of letting the relationship be one-way."

Russia, yes, sent in tanks into Ukraine, but don't act like they invaded the entire country. They took Crimea, a very important location for them tactically and economically, as well as taking control of swathes of ethnically Russian territory, which for all intents and purposes, is Russia anyway. Ukraine is an artificial construct. Just like Azerbaijan.  Please, lets not forget that MAIDAN in Ukraine illegally ousted a democratically elected government, to put one into power who is pro-Europe, and pro-NATO.  I wonder who could have been pushing for that....  The West uses various other methods to undermine countries. Unpayable IMF loans, CIA is involved in almost every country in South America to undermine any opposition to pro-USA control. And then lets not forget the straight up bombing of civilians and illegal invasions of countries like IRAQ under bullshit pretext.  I feel like you're just shilling for the West now, in fact.  There is no net benefit for Armenians to join Western interests, other than losing their sovereignty, their identity, and probably being forced into taking loans they can never repay, and being forced to take in hundreds of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers eventually, which will slowly erode Armenia's identity, and religious heritage. We only have to look at countries like Sweden and others in Europe to see what western ;liberalism is doing.   You can bet 100% if Armenia ever leaves Russia's sphere of influence, and joins a Western one, you will just suffer the same fate as Europe. Unworkable 'multi-cultural' rainbow society, direct attacks of religious and cultural institutions, the destruction of the institution of marriage with pushes for its rebranding to include homosexuals, push for 'sexual liberation' and having your sons and daughters look up to disgusting vile creatures like Miley Cyrus and Niki Minaj, migrants literally raping your children and seeing few consequences (see Britain, see Sweden) less jobs for Armenians, more attacks of the values of family, and overall reduction in happiness."
armenia,3bf1ym,istinspring,5,Sun Jun 28 18:28:30 2015 UTC,"Do you think Armenians look at places like New Zealand and Iceland and Israel and think ""Boy those countries are so wealthy and prosperous, but my country is even better off because despite our crippling poverty at least we're not under western influence"".  Do you really think average people in any country care about spheres of influence? Nope. The only thing average people around the world care about is getting a job, buying a home, raising a family, giving their children a future. All of that is a lot easier living in a western country.   Russia acts very overtly, when it comes to maintaining its influence.   Oh poor Russia just trying to maintain its influence. Did you even read my post? Nobody wants Russia's influence. Russia's influence leads to massacres and concrete apartment blocks. That's why Russia needs tanks and troops to maintain their influence. Because no one would allow their country to be under Russia's influence willfully.   Please, lets not forget that MAIDAN in Ukraine illegally ousted a democratically elected government, to put one into power who is pro-Europe, and pro-NATO.   That's what a revolution is buddy. It's when people rise up to their shitty and incompetent leaders - like Yanukovych - and demand new ones.   It might be hard to tell living in a country like Canada where there are free and fair elections, but a government is only legitimate as long as it has the consent of the governed. When there are thousands of people barging down your presidential doors, and your own security forces stand down, and you have to flee your country - then you do not have the consent of the governed and you are not the legitimate leader.   I wonder who could have been pushing for that....   Literally everyone whose tired of living in poverty under a corrupt Russian puppet.    The West uses various other methods to undermine countries. Unpayable IMF loans, CIA is involved in almost every country in South America to undermine any opposition to pro-USA control.   And yet countries in South America are still better off than countries under Russian influence.    And then lets not forget the straight up bombing of civilians and illegal invasions of countries like IRAQ under bullshit pretext.   Meanwhile in Ukraine and Georgia...   I feel like you're just shilling for the West now, in fact.   I feel like you're a naive teenager who hates the west for whatever reason and thinks he is in any way qualified to tell Armenians what's good for their country and what isn't despite having never lived in Armenia, despite having no family members who ever lived in Armenia.    There is no net benefit for Armenians to join Western interests, other than losing their sovereignty, their identity, and probably being forced into taking loans they can never repay   We've already lost our sovereignty. Russia owns this countries energy. Russia guards this countries borders. Russia practically determines our foreign policy.    being forced to take in hundreds of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers eventually   Now you're confusing western influence for EU membership."

I am Armenian, and what your saying is short-sighted for Armenia and its identity. You talk about average person wanting jobs, but you can't just look for a quick fix. Just because the quick fix might be to leave Russian influence and let Western influence help make Armenia more 'prosperous', youre totally disregarding the long term.  EU membership and Western influence are on in the same. Both systems that destroy native cultural identity, for the sake of economic expansion. The USA and Canada arent part of the EU, but follow the same destructive pattern. Bring in as much cheap labour as possible.  If you and the majority of young Armenians feel that sacrificing Armenia's future identity just for a perceived increase in the economy, then fine. You're already doomed.

Armenia, on the other hand, along with Armenians have been there, unmoving for thousands of years. The Christian culture of Armenia has been there for something like 1900 years.

That's patently false, and Azeri polities have existed in Azerbaijan since the Shirvanshahs ruled. Oghuz Turks ruled the area centuries before that too. Since then this was cemented by Safavid rule, a dynasty of Azeri origin. How fucking long do you have to live in a place before you have a right to it? Is 1000 years not enough?  Coincidentally this is the same pseudo-historical jingoistic crap spouted by Russians over Ukrainians, as if to assert a ""natural"" claim to their nation.

armenia,3b88t5,armeniapedia,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:02:01 2015 UTC,Although the two issues are not directly connected I think your right. Which could show the Russians aprehension to mass movements on their doorstep and under their yoke. But with concessions being made the protests may gather pace when they know there is more that could be gained.   It's really interesting to see the rise of the power returning to the people as they wake up to the potential for change.   I am worried #ElectricYerevan can become a game of chiken between protestor demands and the government to the point where the Russians get involved on a macro regional level. I saw a few posts of this being spun as foreign agitators but I think the movements proven too be too widespread and grassroots to be a U.S. plot.   I hope overall no one is hurt and as a result Armenia wins some concessions on Electric and/or gas rates.

They usually end with government violence (that time with Levon Ter-Petrossian bringing tanks into the streets).  I certainly would love to see an Armenia with much less corruption, and good governance, but even with protests like this, I'm not seeing the leadership that can bring it in.  If the people saw such a leader (perhaps the former mayor of Yerevan who was shipped off as many believe due to his unacceptable popularity), I think the number of protesters would explode as people finally saw an opportunity for real change.  Virtually all of the opposition is either just as bad as the guys in power, or really not capable of governing, and the people know it."

armenia,3b7gbc,An_Image_Of_Mohammed,8,Fri Jun 26 17:28:33 2015 UTC,My guess is that they wouldn't want what happened in Palestine and the Jews to happen in Eastern Anatolia.  They don't want Armenians buying back the land that they were removed from.  Basically prejudiced.

A large group joined the protest, I think it was the city tour one, the one where they walk around the city and get as many people to join and bring them to Bagramyan. Anyway, they brought a lot of new people yesterday, a lot of them, you might call ""qyartu"". The area of the protest grew all the way up to the French square, where cars were doing their own protest by creating a traffic. A splinter groups were also blocking the Mashtots blvd from time to time, which was really upsetting the cops, new enforcements were called in and Vova Gasparyan had lost his cool.   On the front of the protest speakers were installed on the barricade and a party scene had formed. in the middle of the crowd there were national dances by Gagik Ginosyan, in one of the little alleys of Bagramyan a night club had a live rock band. A 100 meter flag was being carried around in a circle."

During the audit period, the price difference will be borne by the government. The protesters made it abundantly clear that this decision does NOT suit them, and only serves the purpose of winning time for the government.

armenia,3b7377,That_Armenian_Guy,2,Fri Jun 26 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"No no no, not losing the original site.  Let me try to explain like this:  Armenia is a country that was under Soviet Rule, so some of these churches were partially destroyed, vandalized, and had stones stolen from them for other buildings.  Not only that, but earthquakes also tend to destroy parts of these as well.  In many cases, almost all the stone from the original structure is still present.  The 70% rule is by UNESCO, because sometimes you can't have 100% of the original stones.    The Garni Temple for example, was destroyed, and many pieces were in the river and valley below as well.  They went and recovered as much of the original stones, which were about 80%, and rebuilt.  So basically, they don't just use 70% of the stone and throw away or sell the other 30%.  They just need to have at least 70% of the original structure's stone, so that UNESCO can either fund the project of rebuilding, or deem the site as a world heritage site that needs protection so that it is officially recognized.  Did that help or am I rambling?"

armenia,3atw96,ajano2006,3,Tue Jun 23 13:55:33 2015 UTC,"As a fellow spyurkahye, I largely agree with your assessment with a few notable exceptions.  In a few countries with large Armenian populations the parties do play a role in politics. In Lebanon, for example, there are a certain number of parliamentary seats held by Armenian political parties.  The second useful purpose they play is in channeling manpower to Armenia in crises. The Dashnaks played a huge role in getting volunteers from the diaspora to go to Artsakh and fight, and that struggle was clearly aligned with their ideological teachings.  But for the most part, it just seems like people are interested in whatever fake status they can attain from the organizations."
armenia,3atw96,bokavitch,2,Tue Jun 23 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"I ask myself this same question quite often. From the outside, it just seems like these parties are just a bunch of people who don't agree with each other and make a big deal about small differences in ideology. (which is true for the most part) When in reality they are all working towards the same goal, improving Armenia and preserving culture. It's a shame that such horrible attitudes exist toward those who are different.  Even though Armenia is an independent republic, doesn't mean it is perfect or doesn't need help. It is quite well known that there is a fair bit of corruption happening and non profits simply don't want to get involved in political issues.  Does Armenia need political parties in the diaspora to talk on their behalf? No. But it has had great benefits in raising awareness about the genocide and making local politicians aware of this. In an ideal world, the divide wouldn't exist and we would be one unit working together, but that simply isn't the case. People have differing beliefs and I think it is healthy to have platforms to express and work toward them (much like religion). The problem arises, like you said, when people only care about the individual power they gain through these parties, and hate on people who disagree in the slightest. This attitude needs to change."

Those were plain clothed cops, who never really hid that fact. Note their armbands.   Last time I saw titushki's were during Raffi's Tour de Yerevan and then praying in Tsitsernakaberd. They were 16-17 year old kids throwing rocks and bottles at the police and very quickly vanishing.   Also I really wish one day to see professional journalists who are there to cover the news and not be part of it.  Lragir.am would probably the last one."

armenia,3asa0q,yozgatsi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:38:36 2015 UTC,"Armenian electricity tariffs hiked again, sparking social unrest  Armenians took to the streets to protest as the utility regulator gave the green light to a 16% electricity price rise by power distributor Electric Network of Armenia (ENA), a monopoly under Russian ownership. The increase is the third in just two years, and opposition parties and rights groups complain it will have a severe impact on Armenian households and the economy at large.  ENA had actually requested on May 8 a 40% tariff increase, the fifth since Inter Rao’s fully-owned subsidiary acquired the electricity distribution company in 2006. Since then, the Russian company has been piling on ever more debt, creating increased discontent at the way the power company is being run.  As of August 1, 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity will rise by AMD6.93 (€0.012) compared with the AMD17.08 (€0.031) requested by ENA, the public services regulatory commission (PSRC) said. As a result, the daytime tariff will be AMD48.78 (€0.09) per kWh, while at night it will cost AMD38.78 (€0.071)."

armenia,3apzza,doss_,5,Mon Jun 22 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"Over time, Russia put pressure on Armenia and Armenia sold almost all of its vital infrastructure to Russian companies, including the vast majority of power sector(gas and electricity).  Some people say Putin gave an order for Russian companies aboard to collect more money because of sanctions on Russia, but I personally don't believe it has anything to do with Russian sanctions. The electricity prices have been increasing for the past 4 years. Every year they increased the price. It used to be just 30 drams last year but now it's almost 60% more. This is a tremendous price hike in a very short period of time, so people are complaining about it. Every economy sector will be affected by this. Do NOT listen to folks who will say ""it's west organizing protests against the pro-Russian government""... that is a bullshit. It's ordinary people complaining about foreign companies for treating them like slaves.  Obviously the young people have the energy to sit all night and shout so most people are young. There were many elder people too but they left sometime at night because they couldn't physically stand longer. Later on they rejoined people in the morning.  For a while, the police was warning people to leave but people didn't listen so the police ended up using watering cannons this morning. Some people were hurt. It's really dangerous to get hit by a high pressure water from a firefighter truck. People got really angry and started shouting slogans that the country's 1st president was using while he was campaigning against Serge (current pres). Some people demand that the president Serge resigns.   Soon or later more people will get fed up and demand the president's resignation. The pres did actually ask 5 protestors to join him and discuss the issue, but protestors refused because few days earlier, the protestors were the ones who were asking to speak to president but the pres refused because apparently there were very few protestors at that time and president didn't think this was be an issue (total dumbbass lol). So now protestors just sat there and demanded for president to sign an order to cancel the price hike without discussing anything with them. In other words, if you tell me to go fuck yourself then I will tell you to go fuck yourself. Apparently president refused to sign an order and the police watered and arrested a lot of people. They were demanding that protestors move to the main square and not to block the streets. Fuck the police of course, but I got to give them a credit for their long patience. They are getting less brutal these days. They are scared obviously (or someone who controls them is scared). People are not a sheep after all.  Peace and love."

armenia,3apzza,doss_,2,Tue Jun 23 11:08:21 2015 UTC,The government chose to sell of the assets and pocket the money. Now the company running those assets is also pocketing the money to the point where they don't have any left to actually run the infrastructure so they give some money to government officials in order to raise the prices. I'm pretty sure everyone involved in this corrupt deal is sitting around a table trying to figure out how to appease protesters but still get the money they want.
armenia,3apmzt,vartanm,6,Mon Jun 22 14:05:12 2015 UTC,"Relevant part   It took the release of an ax murderer to raise alarms in Washington. In late August 2012, Orban suddenly repatriated Ramil Safarov, an Azeri serving a life term in Hungary for hacking an Armenian soldier to death during a NATO-sponsored training program. To nobody’s surprise, Safarov received a hero’s welcome in Azerbaijan and was immediately pardoned, promoted and given a new apartment. Armenia cut off diplomatic ties with Hungary, and tensions escalated in Nagorno-Karabakh, over which Armenia and Azerbaijan had fought a war in the early 1990s.  “Don’t they realize that their little trick could cause a war?” Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Marie Yovanovitch asked Kounalakis on the telephone. “Who will clean it up — Hungarians? No, Hungarians won’t clean up the mess. We will! We will be the ones left to fix it!”  That little trick, Kounalakis says, ended Hungary’s two-decade status as a reliable strategic partner of the United States."

Now combine (1) and (2) and you get the picture of the future after the reform.  It doesn't even matter whether Serzh will be the PM in the new system or not. What matters to him and his cronies is that their personal businesses remain intact and their puppet justice system stays loyal (and corrupt as fuck).

Even opposition party observers (including ones I've spoken with), said that they did not witness any fraud in the elections. Of course, this becomes a matter of disbelief and so everyone scrambles to find reasons for why the HHK won even though there was no visible fraud. So then they claim that everyone who voted for them was paid off before the election. Pretty impressive operation if it were true.   The justice system has proved that it is asserting its independence and several recent court cases prove that. Not least of which was a decision by the Constitutional Court which struck down parts of legislation which ultimately led to the resignation of the country's prime minister.

At one out I asked her what something said, she told me she had no idea because older Armenian writings are very difficult for a modern Armenian to read. She said they often combined multiple letters in to one, used letters as numbers with no indication of such, and didn't put spaces between words. Also, some words were used differently/didn't exist anymore. So, to read this you may have to find someone who specializes in reading older forms of Armenian."

The fact that they hold a ""debate"" and then decide to effectively deny the Genocide is worse than doing nothing at all.  This whole manuevre may be a pro-Turkish tactic by the UK to create the possibility of legislative precedence over ""debates"", and how ""[the] priority should be to promote reconciliation between the peoples and Governments of Armenia and Turkey and to enable the two countries to face their joint history together.""

So, some big part of the profit from Azeri oil and gas fields goes to a consortium of foreign companies led by BP, while the remaining small part belongs to the Azeri state-run company SOCAR. (""As of 2014 SOCAR holds 11.6% of the ACG shares and 16.7% of the Shah Deniz shares."" says Wikipedia.) A century later the Brits are back, they own the Caspian oil again, and we shouldn't be surprised by Britain's anti-Armenian stance in at least the two most important issues for us: 1915 and Artsakh.  And of course if the Azeri economy goes bust, obviously it's the Azeri people who will suffer in the first place, and not BP or the Aliyev family. And unfortunately xenophobia that the Aliyev clan used as a tool to remain in power is not going to go away easily after (and if) the economy goes bust."

Do you have any examples?"
armenia,3a4y0c,Idontknowmuch,2,Wed Jun 17 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"I read the first chapter or so of Crime of Numbers (whose author was here on reddit in an IAMA) I think on the Amazon preview or somewhere which let you read part of the book, and apart from it being a very novel and interesting take on 19th century Western Armenia, it shows the efforts carried out by western powers, lead by UK, in pushing for rights for Armenians and pressuring the Ottoman Empire on this very issue, with the apparent (you never know with British politics) aim of creating an eventual independent Armenia.  I'll get the book sometime soon and I highly recommend it at least based on the part I read.  My understating is an independent Armenia was the aim of the western powers as Armenia was not only aligned with the west (in its limited capacity under an empire) but also Armenians were the progressives in the region, whereas the rest of the Muslims in the region stuck in the Middle Ages (this is also true for Iran, where it just happens that it was the Armenians who brought democracy to the country with a revolution at the beginning of the century).   Armenians were the advanced society in that region socially and economically and the west was aligned with them and the only way to put a stop to this and a stop to western domination of the region was the Genocide.   The more you dig in the rabbit hole of Armenian history of those times the more you see that what even Armenians know about their own history is a watered down sad version of it (presumably because how it ended. So no one wants/wanteded to remember the good aspects).   Edit: links and all"
armenia,3a4y0c,bokavitch,2,Wed Jun 17 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"It's so true about Armenians not understanding what happened.  I always compare it to the French revolution or other western revolutions where the bourgeoisie deposed/forced the monarchy to reform.

The country is still paying the price with shitty, autocratic and extractive government."
armenia,3a4y0c,Nikolasv,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"That is a bad reading of history. Most European powers especially the British used Christian minorities as policy tool to pressure the Ottoman Empire, they never really supported Armenian independence. European Powers even sabotaged and crippled the Independence that Balkan states did achieve. For example the traditional Great Powers were all unambiguously against Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece forming an alliance called the Balkan League to kick the Ottomans out of the rest of their European territories.   British policy generally sides with Mahometan nations in their conflicts with non-Mahometans. Look at the partition of India, Cyprus, Azeri-Armenian conflicts, how they supported Arabs against Israel(except for the Sinai campaign), etc.   From the Iama you cite he seems very caught in the Turkish worldview and perhaps that is why he still believes the Christian powers always support Christians belief that most Turks hold.

I don't know, it doesn't seem likely to me. Maybe those stories were about possible other battles in the district, so not the town itself?"
armenia,3a5cnt,Tsovitstsov,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"In today’s Grand Chamber judgment in the case of Chiragov and Others v. Armenia (application no. 13216/05) the European Court of Human Rights held, by a majority, that there had been:   a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property) to the European Convention on Human Rights;  a continuing violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the Convention; and a continuing violation of Article 13 (right to an effective remedy).   The case concerned the complaints by six Azerbaijani refugees that they were unable to return to  their homes and property in the district of Lachin, in Azerbaijan, from where they had been forced to flee in 1992 during the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.  There are currently more than one thousand individual applications pending before the Court which were lodged by persons displaced during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.     In the applicants’ case, the Court confirmed that Armenia exercised effective control over NagornoKarabakh and the surrounding territories and thus had jurisdiction over the district of Lachin.  The Court considered that there was no justification for denying the applicants access to their property without providing them with compensation. The fact that peace negotiations were ongoing did not free the Government from their duty to take other measures. What was called for was a property claims mechanism which would be easily accessible to allow the applicants and others in their situation to have their property rights restored and to obtain compensation."
armenia,3a5cnt,armeniapedia,3,Wed Jun 17 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"So basically it's the same finding, only this one adds a determination that the Republic of Armenia is in effective control over the Republic of Mountainous Karabakh, and therefore is responsible.    I know that Karabakh depends on Armenia obviously, but I'm not sure how much more control Armenia has over Karabakh than Russia has over Armenia.  So technically, following this logic, the Azeris should be suing Russia, since Russia controls Armenia and thereby Karabakh by this same logic.  But anyway, it's interesting that these are Lachin Kurds.  How many are there I wonder?  And did they actually try to return and were turned away?  I remember something about a brief ""Red Kurdistan"" in Lachin, and it would be interesting if they were given a mini-state in that area."
armenia,3a5cnt,armeniapedia,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"It is also interesting that in this case there was a greater disagreement between the judges (as I understand it from the text) and the decision was simply postponed. Unlike the other case with the Armenian guy, where the court left it to the parties to settle within 12 months. So this case is not as unequivocal as the other one."
armenia,3a5cnt,Tsovitstsov,2,Wed Jun 17 15:52:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's clear that there is the Artsakh Republic, who is the real counter party in this case. But I think a number of the judges have decided to accept the claims of  Armenia's responsibility in this case, because they otherwise likely wouldn't even be able to make a judgement. For instance Artsakh is not a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights leaving it outside of the courts juristictions.        And letting Artsakh's government sign that convention will of course be heavily opposed by Azerbaijan because it gives Artsakh more international legitimacy."
armenia,3a5cnt,Tsovitstsov,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"But Lachin is not even NKR, that's the thing. And it's a very vulnerable place in the whole scheme.  So the Azeris decided to start with a flanking maneuver: push Kurds from Lachin first. Because:  (1) if Azeris who fled Armenia go to court, that would start a counter-wave of lawsuits from Baku Armenians. Many of them are wealthy enough to pursue their goals in courts, and the cost of their lost property is greater than that of Azeris' in Armenia.  (2) if Azeris from Karabakh go to court, then the court will be more likely to view NKR as a participating side. A bit dangerous for Azerbaijan.  The above two will likely happen sooner or later, but Kurds of Lachin is the easiest case to start the whole thing with. Or so it seems to me."
armenia,3a5cnt,Tsovitstsov,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:24:01 2015 UTC,But Lachin is not even NKR   What do you mean it's under Artsakhs juristiction.   Your other points are interesting but there is atleast one thing. The most of the Azeris from Armenia was able to sell their property or trade it with Armenians fleeing Azerbaijan. So most of them legally given up their former property.
armenia,3a5cnt,Tsovitstsov,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:33:11 2015 UTC,"No, formally Lachin is outside of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It's part of the Azerbaijani regions under Armenian/NKR control, and it is obviously a crucial place that bridges Armenia and NKR.  On selling property: so did many Baku Armenians, though not all of them. But there is one other thing all refugees can pursue, is the right to return and live there."
armenia,3a5cnt,Tsovitstsov,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:42:15 2015 UTC,I don't think you understood me. Artsakh exersieses juristiction over all the areas under its control.  Note Artsakh's constitution:   Article 142.  Till the restoration of the state territorial integrity of the Nagorno Karabagh Republic and the adjustment of its borders public authority is exercised on the territory under factual jurisdiction of the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh.   http://www.president.nkr.am/en/constitution/fullText  As for the Armenians from Azerbaijan. Many of them had to directly flee from violent pogroms and often werent able to sell or trade their property so didn't lose it legally.
armenia,3a5cnt,Dracaras,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"True, but. The smallest land that can claim independence internationally is the former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. Because the independence movement in NKAO began before the war back in the 1980s, within its formal borders in the USSR. Whether it will extend to other territories or not is not clear and may become a bargaining chip. Or maybe not, we can't tell.  In any case, shifting the responsibility for Lachin onto Armenia is a bit - just a little bit - easier than on Karabakh from the court's point of view. But then again, we don't know what will happen when Karabakh Azeris file their lawsuits."
armenia,3a5cnt,Tsovitstsov,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:21:49 2015 UTC,I understand what you mean but I'm just trying to point out that Artsakh is the one responsible for the territory.

Only powerful countries have the ability to invade another country without facing heavy backslash. Look at what russia did despite all those embargoes since they are powerful they can wipe everything. Nobody would ever want a stronger Turkey so they keep it in check. They would never ever allow it to invade armenia unless usa strongly favors and again it'd for them and they'd use us like a tool only.  Relations with Russia are good and i hope it only gets better.

I think your position and almost everything you say is very understandable from the point of view as a modern Turk, to the point where even an Armenian, if he or she were in your shoes right now would probably be in the same state of mind as you. I also believe the contrary to be true. If you were in the shoes of an Armenian (who is vocal and cares about all this) you would probably be in the state of mind of the people you see sometimes here or in this thread.  There is little difference between an Armenian and a Turk. But the difference that exists is so strong that doesn't allow them to see each other as what they really are: close cousins, or... brothers. Two very estranged brothers.  The problem is that there are two very different viewpoints, emotions and even lived histories experienced between the two peoples and frankly, it is not the fault of the vast majority of the either people.  A lot of things should happen, trivially among other things, Turks should know what really happened to the Armenians and not what they have been told and Armenians should know that it was not the average Turk who was responsible for what happened and in fact a lot of Turks helped Armenians and are helping them to this day (for example, all the Turkish scholarly work being done on the Genocide.)  They both need to reconcile. They don't have a choice. And it is possible."

The difference here is that i am looking at historical facts not from the Ottomans but from the War itself and specific human patterns psychologically and sociologically.

Let's begin.   United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau. ""The real purpose of the deportation was robbery and destruction; it really represented a new method of massacre. When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the fact.""  ""I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.""  ""They have drawn from the fields the male population and thereby destroyed their agricultural communities. They have annihilated or displaced at least two thirds of the Armenian population and thereby deprived themselves of a very intelligent and useful race.""  ""Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is increasing and from harrowing reports of eyewitnesses it appears that a campaign of race extermination is in progress under a pretext of reprisal against rebellion.""  First President of Turkey and Founder of the Republic of Atatürk Mustafa Kemal.  ""These leftovers from the former Young Turk Party, who should have been made to account for the lives of millions of our Christian subject who were ruthlessly driven en masse from their homes and massacred, have been restive under Republican rule. They have hitherto lived on plunder, robbery and bribery, and become inimical to any idea or suggestion to enlist in useful labor and earn their living by the honest sweat of their brow.""  ""The World War I massacres against the Armenians (Ermenilere karşı katliam) [was] a shameful act (fazahat).""  Ottoman naval officer and statesman Rauf Orbaymentioned in his memoirs during a discussion withJames Harbord: ""Kemal used the 800,000 figure to describe the number of Armenian victims. He, in fact, 'disapproved of the Armenian massacres.' (Ermeni katlini o da takbih ediEl-Ghusein  Sheikh and member of Ottoman parliament Faiz El-Ghusein.  ""As to their preparations, the flags, bombs and the like, even assuming there to be some truth in the statement, it does not justify the annihilation of the whole people, men and women, old men and children, in a way which revolts all humanity and more especially Islam and the whole body of Moslems, as those unacquainted with the true facts might impute these deeds to Mohammedan fanaticism.""  ""Annihilation seemed to be the sole means of deliverance; they found their opportunity in a time of war, and they proceeded to this atrocious deed, which they carried out with every circumstance of brutality — a deed which is contrary to the law of Islam""   Council of State, and cabinet minister in the Ottoman government Reşid Akif Paşa. ""During my few days of service in this government I've learned of a few secrets and have come across something interesting. The deportation order was issued through official channels by the minister of the interior and sent to the provinces. Following this order the [CUP] Central Committee circulated its own ominous order to all parties to allow the gangs to carry out their wretched task. Thus the gangs were in the field, ready for their atrocious slaughter.""  ""The 'mission' in the circular was: to attack the convoys and massacre the population ... I am ashamed as a Muslim, I am ashamed as an Ottoman statesman. What a stain on the reputation of the Ottoman Empire, these criminal people ..."""

""It is unlawful to designate the Armenian assets as ""abandoned goods"" for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily removed from their domiciles and exiled. Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods ... Nobody can sell my property if I am unwilling to sell it. Article 21 of the Constitution forbids it. If we are a constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can't do this. This is atrocious. Grab my arm, eject me from my village, then sell my goods and properties, such a thing can never be permissible. Neither the conscience of the Ottomans nor the law can allow it.""  ""Let's face it, we Turks savagely killed off the Armenians.""  In a statement in the Ottoman Parliament, Rize referred to theSpecial Organization as ""murderers and criminals"".  Italian Consul of Trabzon Giacomo Gorrini. ""The local authorities, and indeed the Moslem population in general, tried to resist, to mitigate it, to make omissions, to hush it up. But the orders of the Central Government were categorically confirmed, and all were compelled to resign themselves and obey. It was a real extermination and slaughter of the innocents, an unheard-of thing, a black page stained with the flagrant violation of the most sacred rights of humanity ... There were about 14,000 Armenians at Trebizond — Gregorians, Catholics, and Protestants. They had never caused disorders or given occasion for collective measures of police. When I left Trebizond, not a hundred of them remained.""  ""As for the Armenians, they were treated differently in the different vilayets. They were suspect and spied upon everywhere, but they suffered a real extermination, worse than massacre, in the so-called 'Armenian Vilayets.' from the 24th June onwards, the Armenians were all ""interned"" — that is, ejected by force from their various residences and dispatched under the guard of the gendarmerie to distant, unknown destinations, which for a few will mean the interior of Mesopotamia, but for four-fifths of them has meant already a death accompanied by unheard-of cruelties"".  American businessman Walter M. Geddes. ""Several Turks[,] whom I interviewed, told me that the motive of this exile was to exterminate the race"".  ""The destination of all these Armenians is Aleppo. Here they are kept crowded in all available vacant houses, khans, Armenian churches, courtyards and open lots. Their condition in Aleppo is beyond description. I personally visited several of the places where they were kept and found them starving and dying by the hundreds every day."""

armenia,3a1ow4,mojuba,6,Tue Jun 16 15:27:37 2015 UTC,"It's mostly positive for the Armenian guy, basically the court acknowledges that Azerbaijan should have given him shelter and treated him just like other displaced persons from the region. (Essentially the Az. Govt. selectively helped only ethnic Azerbaijanis, which is wrong from the standpoint of international laws and conventions.)  But the bottom line is:   Having regard to the exceptional nature of the case, the Court, by a majority, held that the question of the application of Article 41 (just satisfaction) was not ready for decision. Consequently, it reserved that question and invited both parties to submit within twelve months their observations on this matter and to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach.   which to my understanding is a chance for the Az. Govt. to settle out of court within 12 months.  One other thing to consider is, there will be similar cases from Azeri refugees, and we can expect some well paid lawyers on their side."

armenia,3a1ow4,armeniapedia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:05:25 2015 UTC,"Armenian refugee’s rights violated by lack of access to his property in Azerbaijan, left behind in conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh  In today’s Grand Chamber judgment in the case of Sargsyan v. Azerbaijan (application no. 40167/06) the European Court of Human Rights held, by a majority, that there had been:   a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property) to the European Convention on Human Rights;  a continuing violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the Convention; and a continuing violation of Article 13 (right to an effective remedy).   The case concerned an Armenian refugee’s complaint that, after having been forced to flee from his  home in the Shahumyan region of Azerbaijan in 1992 during the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, he had since been denied the right to return to his village and to have access to and use his property there.   It was the first case in which the Court had to decide on a complaint against a State which had lost control over part of its territory as a result of war and occupation, but which at the same time was alleged to be responsible for refusing a displaced person access to property in an area remaining under its control.   There are currently more than one thousand individual applications pending before the Court which were lodged by persons displaced during the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.     In Mr Sargsyan’s case, the Court confirmed that, although the village from which he had to flee was located in a disputed area, Azerbaijan had jurisdiction over it.   The Court considered that while it was justified by safety considerations to refuse civilians access to the village, the State had a duty to take alternative measures in order to secure Mr Sargsyan’s rights as long as access to the property was not possible. The fact that peace negotiations were ongoing did not free the Government from their duty to take other measures. What was called for was a property claims mechanism which would be easily accessible to allow Mr Sargsyan and others in his situation to have their property rights restored and to obtain compensation."
armenia,3a1ow4,bokavitch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"I see this as a definite positive.  Even if we are forced to settle accounts in both directions, it will be to our benefit.  The property of the Azeris in Armenia and Artsakh's is valued a lot less than the property of all the Armenians thrown out of Baku.  Also, if all claims are settled monetarily it will strengthen Artsakh's claim for independence since the Azeris will have to settle for non territorial compensation and won't have a claim left after that."
armenia,3a1ow4,ThatGuyGaren,2,Tue Jun 16 17:11:42 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly.. A lot of millionaires were thrown out of Baku and if they were to reclaim those it would cause Azerbaijan quite a lot of loss.

armenia,39yc7u,bokavitch,2,Mon Jun 15 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"I quite liked Ararat, and unlike most Egoyan films I've seen, I totally got it.  It's a mistake to consider it ""the"" genocide movie, or even ""a"" genocide movie.  It is a thoroughly Egoyan movie.  It explores some very interesting themes in the post genocide times, in modern Diaspora, in Turks.  Anyway, as I said I liked it.  It was and is the only major & interesting movie in existence with the Armenian Diaspora as its theme which was quite an interesting experience as well for me."
armenia,39yc7u,armeniapedia,2,Tue Jun 16 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but it was definitely marketed as a genocide movie at the time it was released.

armenia,39yc7u,bokavitch,2,Tue Jun 16 08:12:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think Egoyan or the distributors marketed it that way.  I think the Diaspora press wrote about it and ""marketed"" it that way."

People today talking about it, dealing with it, and making a movie about it.  I can see how someone who wants the movie to be something can watch that and believe it is, but watch it again.  Everything is taking place today.  There's a couple of movie set scenes where they're filming the genocide, but they're all talking clearly about today, about the effects.  That much more was lost than lives and property."

Just to get some idea of Egoyan's style and thinking.  Good directors require some effort in order to get the most out of their art. You can never judge about Woody Allen or Ingmar Bergman by just one film, you need to watch quite a few to get the grasp."

He belongs to the international indie/arthouse scene where he is appreciated and not because he is Armenian. He is a good director, honestly."
armenia,39yc7u,mojuba,2,Mon Jun 15 21:29:09 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, that's the only one I've seen, I wasn't eager to watch his other work after that.  I read that his most recent film was panned heavily.  I just got really annoyed when so many Armenians started praising the film after initially bashing it.    It's something I'd watch on netflix if I were bored and probably give it 3/5 stars, but it really doesn't do the subject justice.  He just used the Armenian genocide as something tangential for a psychological thriller with pointless sex scenes etc.    I've seen him in a few interviews bashing people who have wanted an epic film about the Armenian genocide (like this one).  Basically he was saying it would be lame and he wouldn't want to see it, other people wouldn't see it etc.    I just got the impression that he was way too stuck in his indie movie bubble. It's not like the general public is lining up to see his movies either.  A project like this one could be a huge success. There are certain actors whose movies I'll see just because they have such a good track record, Christian Bale is one of them.  I know a lot of other people who are the same way who wouldn't otherwise be interested in the subject."
armenia,39yc7u,bokavitch,2,Mon Jun 15 22:16:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but not all cinematography is Hollywood, and success is not always measured by the box office sales or ""epic-ness"". A film like this one for example: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120255 has a place under the sun, it got some Cannes Festival awards that year and was nominated for Oscar for best director. It's not a blockbuster though. Egoyan has a very distinct style and at least he was honest enough to say that he is not going to give up his style and vision just because he decided to shoot a film about the genocide.  Now I'm not even sure that the Armenian Genocide needs an epic movie at all. Even Schindler's List was just a specific tale about one man, and not a Gladiator style historic mega-blockbuster.  Seriously, what do we want and what do we expect from the movie industry?"
armenia,39yc7u,mojuba,2,Mon Jun 15 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't say all cinema should be hollywood. I like indie movies myself.  I grew up in Salt Lake City and have seen a ton of small productions at Sundance. If anything the problem that I have with Egoyan is that he acts like all movies should be high-brow indie thrillers.  My point is that he isn't someone who should be talking down to people about what draws people to the box office, because that's not the kind of director that he is.    Maybe epic isn't the right word, but something that deals with the subject directly and captures its importance in history.  Hotel Rwanda is a great example of what I'd hope to see from a film about the genocide. It's something I would find rewarding to watch personally, and it has the added benefit of raising awareness of the topic."

It was my second time there in five years. A few thoughts:   Check out the Armenia Festival Calendar. If there is a festival, go to it. Our trip to the Sheep Shearing Festival was our best day. http://www.facebook.com/ArmenianFestivalCalendar We traveled around with Envoy Tours and I strongly suggest them. They have a different tour every day of the week that brings you to the important sites with very informative tour guides. Each guide speaks perfect English. The tours are very affordable as well and take place in very comfortable vans. A few days with their tours and you could see all of Armenia. If you have a chance, you simply must do their Village Tour. You get to stay a night in one of the villages with a host family. It's incredible.  Yerevan is an awesome city. Very affordable for Americans. For sights to see, check out the Genocide Memorial, the Matenadaran (book museum, sounds boring but isn't), one or both of the brandy factories, the dancing fountains at Republic Square, the Friday night public dance at the Cascade, and the public flea market on the weekend.  Also in Yerevan, the food is great and super affordable. We enjoyed Pasta and Wine quite a bit for non-Armenian food. Also, Caucuses Tavern near Sayant-Nova has very affordable Armenian and Georgian food for great prices, along with great cheap homemade wine (and a no smoking section! You will come to appreciate this if you are not a smoker).  Armenians are super friendly. The most fun I had was talking to people. They are genuinely curious about who you are and why you are there. In the marzes, I got invited to two parties simply because I happened to be walking by and am American.  If you want to buy Armenian things to take home, check out the HDIF collection at the Green Bean Cafe by the Cascade. All fair trade, home made traditional crafts made by women in various villages who are working together to build their own businesses and better their lives. The Berd Bears are beautiful.    Feel free to ask any questions about specific things you are interested in. If I can point you in the right direction, I will."

There are tons of day trips you can do since Armenia is so small. if you want to see natural springs in Jermuk, a serene resort town like Dilijan, up some cable cars in Tsakhkadzor for a relaxing day, a ride to Lake Sevan, a trip to Tbilisi, a drive down to Southern Armenia to see Tatev Monastery and other cool southern Armenian towns, a trip to nagorno karabakh, etc.   As for staying in Yerevan, there are tons of cafes and restaurants to walk to. The streets are filled with them and the city is extremely walkable. I'm sure someone who lives there can give you more advice on that."

As for the film, not everyone can sit it through, but to many it will be an unforgettable experience. In a way Parajanov is in the same league with one of the greatest surrealists Alejandro Jodorowski: you don't necessarily understand what you are seeing, but you can never forget it.  This film is unconventional in so many ways: virtually no movie plot, veeeery long shots, some metaphors and symbolism not immediately clear, and some other things probably not making sense anyway. It does however deliver beautiful imagery not seen in any other movie ever made, it is very Armenian and somewhat Georgian, it's hypnotic and it is brilliant. It's a masterpiece of cinematography that probably every movie director in the world is familiar with.  Anyway. I don't recommend this film.

It must be a lot harder for Syrian-Armenians to move from Armenia, because for all of their lives they believed that one day they're going to go back home and be happy, but now they're leaving for another Arab country.

I'll skip the part that says the partisan polarity in the US is all a farce just to create an illusion of a debate and choice, etc. but the two philosophies are actually two radical approaches to life, economy and everything.  So what I was going to say: I never liked the nietzschean self-made-man philosophy. I don't know about America, but Armenia is desperate, there are very few of us, we are all humans born equal etc. etc. and we, Armenians, have to help each other.

When you look at multi-cultural Western countries, is it something you wish for your own country?  As a third generation Greek/Armenian Canadian immigrant, I look at Armenia, and I see a strong people who have kept their culture for a really long time, and when I think of the possibility of it being diluted, or washed away by multi-culturalism, it makes me sad.

In human history, the most interesting things have always been happening on the crossroads of cultures, empires, continents.

Many countries are homogeneous in terms of culture, but not lineage due to migrations, invasion and subjugation of neighboring states along with intermarriage.  The article shows that Armenia is unique in the sense that the population has very seldom reproduced with other ethnicities.   While I'm all for the preservation of Armenian culture, I'm not so sure that genetic homogeneity is actually healthy. As far as my limited understanding of genetic goes, mixing tends to produce healthier offspring in the long run.

Logically, mixing more means having healthier genes, think of siblings producing mentally challenged offspring. Now we're saying that we kept our genes in the family, sure it wasn't siblings or even cousins, but over thousands of years that gene pool gets stale.  We did however get our genes very well mixed in the last 100 years, due to the genocide. Most of my own roots are from all over the place.

Western Armenian pronounces some letters differently because that is how the Constantinople dialect developed(which is the dialect standart Western Armenian is based on).

armenia,38vpbw,Tsovitstsov,2,Sun Jun 7 23:09:07 2015 UTC,"Correct!!  In Western Armenian the պ is pronounced ""b"", while բ and փ are both pronounced the same ""p"" sound.  In Eastern Armenian the պ is pronounced ""pb"" (a kind of combination of the two sounds, like how you pronounce the p in ""sports"" in English, բ is pronounced ""b""and փ is pronounced ""p""."
armenia,38vpbw,armeniapedia,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:37:31 2015 UTC,"while բ and փ are both pronounced the same ""p"" sound.   I don't think that's entirely correct. The sounds are slightly different: բ -> p as it is pronounced in Spanish, while փ is English p. Similarly, տ -> d, դ -> t, թ -> Spanish t. And finally there is the ջ, ճ, չ triple with similarly swapped sounds.  In Eastern Armenian similar transformations exist but only in specific contexts and as a rule not in the beginning of words. For example դադար in Eastern Armenian is pronounced as ""datar"". There are rules (and exceptions of course) as to when these transformations occur, which is the source of most grammatical mistakes people make in the Eastern language."

Rapprochement with Armenia, ""democracy"" nor Kurdish rights will improve until a non-nationalist party--Kurdish or otherwise--takes power in Turkey. This won't happen anytime soon, and certainly not with the HDP.  The only reason the HDP may pass the 10% threshold and get into parliament is because CHP and MHP voters are being strategic and voting for HDP to thwart AKP's chances at outright parliamentary majority.  Also, as far as ""democracy"" is concerned, they've probably had more of it with AKP than previous military-controlled nationalist governments (not to play down Erdogan's sultan-like aspirations though). The problem with Turkey and many semi-democratic countries, is that they lack institutions that can truly monitor elections.   At least in the US we have a two-party monopoly on power, where both sides are well enough entrenched in society and with millionaire/billionaire backing that such checks and balances can't be controverted (at least not on the national level).   or if I'd prefer to watch him steal the election and take the country off a cliff.   What does this mean, btw?

armenia,38r7zg,armeniapedia,3,Sat Jun 6 03:10:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think this book is widely read, but it is one of the most interesting and I think important works out there about Armenians.  The author, a Turk, goes on an odyssey to Turkey to discover what happened to the Armenians, and we get a fascinating picture of what happened to the Armenians who never left during or after the genocide.  A story not very well covered elsewhere.  I highly recommend this book.  It's a very important piece of the puzzle of who we are, where we belong, and one of our hardest to understand communities.  The Armenian community in Turkey is after all not a Diaspora community."

Other countries that have recognized the Genocide have much more at stake in Turkey geopolitically than the UK. You keep using the word geopolitics, but I'm not sure you realize the meaning or implications of that use.  Perhaps the UK position has to do with centuries-long friendship between the two nations. In any case, it's shameless and beneath the English, Scottish, Welsh and North Irish peoples. No one is perfect; but the UK govt must be called out for this behavior."

We have a silly system in which the people's views are not represented and it's not down to us. We are not shameless at all because of this, and as I'm English I'm slightly offended. The vast majority of British people do not know about the Armenian Genocide and it's not their fault either, it's because it's not widely talked about. Blame the British government, I 100% agree with you there, but not the British people.  However, you would be glad to know that the parliaments of Scotland, Wales and NI have recognized the genocide. While Parliament hasn't, there was mentioned somewhere that when discussing it lots of people had been misinformed about the actual events.

She says quite explicitly that the reconciliation is possible only through recognition of the Genocide by Turkey. The book itself doesn't question history, it questions the modern day."
armenia,38in1y,mojuba,5,Fri Jun 5 00:19:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know why Stephen Kinzer is quoted on the cover   It's part of the whole awful premise and marketing machine behind this book.  That Armenians are raised to hate Turks, that that's all our community talks about, thinks about and focus' on.  It's a ridiculous premise that for some reason Americans really love to imagine is true, and they like to imagine this young girl busting out of that very oppressive community and culture to challenge everything she grew up with....  and Kinzer is part of this whole attempt to show her and themselves as above ethnic grudges.  It's just all being presented so ludicrously.   I posted this review specifically because it's by someone who was present at the events she uses to paint the Armenian community as extremist and hateful (a summer camp of the most nationalistic Armenian faction in the world no less, which she goes on to extrapolate as the norm for all Armenians everywhere)."
armenia,38in1y,bokavitch,2,Fri Jun 5 00:59:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't read it either, but this is the issue I have with it from what excerpts and reporting I've come across. She takes a few personal anecdotes from her life and uses them to make sweeping generalizations about the entire Armenian community. Then she's portrayed as some kind of heroine for fighting against the straw man Armenian ""problems"" she's laid out.    Just being Armenian doesn't make you qualified to write a book sbout what Armenians as a community do/think/believe/want etc. it doesn't sound like she did any real research or consulted anyone in academia that specializes in Armenian studies either.

It got interesting when she went to Turkey and learned that the people there are still as backwards as the Armenian community makes them out to be - nevertheless her self-hating identity does not shift much upon her return home.

Ok - the writing style was very self-centered and I got the feeling that the point of this book was 'me me me me me' 'I'm so different' etc.  One example of disgraceful content: challenging and accusing GENOCIDE SURVIVORS of making their stories up. Amot iren. I don't care how academic or investigative or whatever, she was making fun of 100 year old women.  I went to that summer camp and she describes it as a nationalist, hate-spewing camp. That is simply untrue - in fact, I don't even believe her version of events happened because they looked into the attendance during the summer she mentioned and none of those people were even at camp.   She was suffering with some real cognitive dissonance. On the one hand, local Turks were calling the Akhtamar church an 'Anatolian church', refusing to label it as Armenian, and on the other hand, she vilifies Armenians for not trying to make peace with the 'modernized' Turkish nation."

armenia,37jfy1,Urartu_TH,0,Thu May 28 04:32:58 2015 UTC,The Armenian-Azeri conflict is a bit different since the losses were more mutual. In truth Armenians probably lost more in terms of the dollar value of their property since the Armenians lost urban real estate in Baku that is worth a lot more than farms in karabakh.  The Turkish situation is more clear cut since Turks didn't really lose anything to Armenians.
armenia,37jfy1,bokavitch,3,Thu May 28 04:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My problem is that there are probably a lot of people that unknowingly legally purchased illegal land (if that makes sense), I guess the government would have to set up a program to figure that all out.

armenia,36zy1n,blogem,8,Sat May 23 16:45:06 2015 UTC,"I had a typical Lebanese breakfast today called a mankoushe, its thyme in bread basically.

As a Canadian I met and fell in love with my girlfriend who is Armenian while we worked and lived together in the Netherlands. Both your countries are awesome for their own reasons and curious for others. Lived for a month in Yerevan this past x-mas and can't wait to learn more about the language. S'tation!  <3 both"
armenia,36zy1n,baconbitz0,4,Sat May 23 17:20:06 2015 UTC,I'm kinda curious. How acceptant were your girlfriends parents about you ? Mixed relationships aren't looked at too well among Armenians.
armenia,36zy1n,ThatGuyGaren,6,Sat May 23 17:52:12 2015 UTC,"Well there is a language barrier in my case. They are well educated and middle class.  They know russian and armenian (western and eastern) where as I only know english and some french and dutch where as my girlfriend in pratically an english translator. So she does has a big role to play in the communication.  So far so good, the first time they let me stay with them and visit her for her birthday for 6 days and then for a month over this past christmas. But now it is becoming more of a problem because the broader friends and family are asking questions and making judgements so they won't be able to host me next time. But I can find somewhere else.  We are meeting in Hamburg next for a month for a work camp so that will be great :)   I am curious if anyone can give some insight to traditional armenian roles of family and outside relationships coming into the family ;)   I am very aware of the stares I get holding her hand in Yerevan but with such a homogenius society it's to be expected and can't really blame anyone for thinking that way..."
armenia,36zy1n,baconbitz0,4,Sat May 23 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends how serious you are about her. My brother-in-law is Dutch-American (Van Lier) and people were were nervous about him at first but they all loved him once they got married. I think because of the conservative nature of the culture people are skeptical about men's intentions toward Armenian women. Armenian society tends to frown on relationships that don't end in marriage.  In my brother in law's case, he converted to the Apostolic church so that they could get married in an Armenian ceremony. I think the gesture went a long way toward his being accepted by the extended family."
armenia,36zy1n,armeniapedia,3,Sat May 23 20:32:09 2015 UTC,That sucks that some of them are like that but it's mostly because we're already a small group of people and don't wana get lost. Hmm if you're already cool with her parents and all I guess a sense of humor and some grilling skills could come in handy ;). If you ever need any help with anything Armenian don't hesitate to pm me. :D and good luck with your relationship.
armenia,36zy1n,baconbitz0,3,Sat May 23 19:01:09 2015 UTC,That sense of humor is key for sure and her and her parents have it. They all make fun of each other and I join in when appropriate but it's also just making sure to give respect when due.  One thing I really need help with is what to say during toasts....really love this tradition of the toast master and the family being together and wishing each other good fortune and respect.
armenia,36zy1n,armeniapedia,3,Sat May 23 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah the toast thing was real awkward for me. We were celebrating our hosts and his brothers son birthday when I was over there, massive roast all family there and all and our host asked me to sit next to him so it was kinda guys together, the ladies together thing but anyway everyone made a toast and when it was my turn I didn't know what to say and awkwardly wished them a happy birthday. Luckily everyone knew I wasn't familiar with it and we all had a nice laugh."

I have to say that with Armenians there is the genocide issue in addition to regular nationalism.  This fear that we will disappear if there is any intermarriage.  I don't think that applies to Armenians any more than any other smaller nationality anymore.  With globalization, acceptance of intermarriage everywhere and large-scale movements of people across borders, it seems inevitable that diasporas are going to disappear and a more global culture is coming.  It would be a sad loss of flavor and variety in cultures, but hopefully we retain some of it and the disappearance of the more evil forms of nationalism will allow people to be a net positive and allow people to just be with who they want and be happy.  Unfortunately, humans being humans it seems likely we'll find something else to divide us and cause us misery...  but anyway, that was a bit of a tangent :)"

Whatever Conservative, Azerbaijan, Turkish, Russian propoganda angle your going for won't convince me the Armenian people are against Love because that is the one thing that if anything kept them together."
armenia,36zy1n,levon14,2,Sat May 23 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"The thing about not performing mixed marriages was specific to Armenians marrying muslim Turks in Turkey, from my understanding. I don't know about other Christian denominations but as far as I'm aware it isn't a problem with catholics and orthodox, they just need some kind of blessing from the priest ahead of the wedding."
armenia,36zy1n,musaler,3,Sat May 23 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"To get married in an Armenian Apostolic Church, you have to be a baptized Christian.  I'm not sure if has to be in the Armenian Church, or any Oriental church, or even broader.  It would have nothing to do with being a Muslim or a Turk specifically.  If you're not an Armenian Church member or even a christian, it's a bit silly to get married in an Armenian Church, right?  That's not really how religion works.  Not that I believe in any of it."
armenia,36zy1n,ThatGuyGaren,2,Sat May 23 21:05:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.   I read somewhere that there was a period of time in the 2000's when the Armenian church in Istanbul was performing services for couples that were mixed Armenian Christian and Turkish muslim where the Armenian wanted a traditional wedding. I'm guessing in most cases the Turks were only nominally Muslim and most likely pretty secular.  Eventually they put a stop to it, since they weren't really supposed to be doing it anyway and people started to complain.  I'm not really religious myself but I do think it's a bit ridiculous for the Armenian church to bless marriages with Turks.  Bulsahays are always doing crazy things though. At this point they're mostly turkified anyway so they don't even realize how bizarre that seems to most Armenians."

armenia,36zy1n,baconbitz0,1 point,Sat May 23 20:26:34 2015 UTC,I've personally met very few that were okay with mixed marriages. Its mainly because a lot of Armenians who marry non Armenians tend to forget their heritage and cease to be Armenian. Now of course there are some who are okay with the idea of mixed marriages but in my experience they aren't a lot. Still could be wrong though.
armenia,36zy1n,bokavitch,1 point,Sun May 24 01:48:01 2015 UTC,Aw. The idea of trilingual children tickles me the right way though. I think it will be a lot of work and most people might not be willing to put in the daily effort needed to produce a family that expresses itself in more languages than the single major regional one (e.g. English for the USA). We humans are so lazy =p
armenia,36zy1n,musaler,1 point,Sun May 24 02:02:10 2015 UTC,Its not how many languages they'd have to learn the problem. I've studied and speak 4 with little problem. The main problem is that the non Armenian parent wouldn't really care about raising an Armenian child. The heritage and culture is what will be lost.
armenia,36zy1n,bokavitch,1 point,Sun May 24 12:50:47 2015 UTC,"That's a shame. I like to think that people are interested in other cultures. Don't Armenians like to learn about others? My girlfriend wants to learn anything and everything about Armenian language and culture so as to be able to express, interact, integrate. Maybe it's a difference between more intellectual or educated people versus those that aren't."
armenia,36zy1n,musaler,1 point,Sun May 24 12:58:04 2015 UTC,You could still be interested and learn about other cultures without being in a relationship with them. Like I said its more of a conservative stand than a matter of education or intellect.

armenia,36zy1n,armeniapedia,-5,Sun May 24 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"Usually, when husband is foreigner and wife is Armenian,,,identity is lost in family. An Armenian women that betrays her nation to marry foreigner, usually doesn't have much of a desire to keep her Armenian identity. Armenian males are a bit different in that regard."
armenia,36zy1n,musaler,5,Thu May 28 22:05:37 2015 UTC,"As a Canadian I appreciate and celebrate others backgrounds, history, culture and heritage. It's hard for foreigners to understand but here in Canada we view diversity as a strength and encourage students to be curious and respectful of theirs and others people pasts.   As a teacher I would very much like to teach in Armenia one day and contribute to education in the country. I also believe that if we were to ever have kids they should learn Armenian.  I recogonize that I will never be Armenian. But I do not think love is something that can be restricted by anyone other then the two people involved. If we had kids I would hope they would call themselves Armenian Canadian and let the others call them what they will."

Edit:  Here's the link http://teachforarmenia.org"
armenia,36zy1n,Idontknowmuch,-3,Sat May 23 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"I understand. But we Armenians are an ethnic group in danger of assimilation around the world, we are a small nation, so we cannot afford to destroy our future generations just because of ""love"". There should be a love towards the Armenian ancestors that survived, kept their identity, so their children can call themselves Armenians. If your Armenian girlfriend is serious about marriage, she should know that with her choice, she destroys a future generation that could have been Armenian. Another blow to the Armenian nation."
armenia,36zy1n,RimePendragon,4,Sat May 23 18:21:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know about this. A lot of Armenians have been intermarried with Greeks and other people in the region for centuries. I think there's a little to much paranoia about assimilation at times. If she makes an effort to raise her kids with knowledge of the Armenian language and culture and they are active in the community, they'll be accepted as Armenians.  There's also a double standard here, most people don't question the Armenianness of mixed marriages when the man is Armenian."
armenia,36zy1n,ThatGuyGaren,-4,Sat May 23 20:40:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of Armenians in intermarriage with Greeks have also lost their identity as Armenians. Also it is naive to think her kids would be Armenian. Those kids would grow up in Canada, with non-Armenian last name, they would speak English in their school and with friends, they would feel much more Canadian than Armenian. And even if there is some ounces of Armenian feeling in them,,,their kids with completely forget any drop of Armenian identity, and there the Armenian generation would be dead. Like the Turks killed so many future Armenian Generations, this is the same thing, except we are doing to to ourselves."
armenia,36zy1n,mattiejj,2,Sat May 23 21:19:18 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of purely Armenian families I've witnessed in east coast USA who already shot themselves in the foot, culturally. The kids can barely speak a couple of words in Armenian, and for all intents and purposes are fully assimilated. I don't know why there's such a discrepancy, really, as I think and dream in Armenian every day. I don't like to think that my parents were exceptional. Nor do I want to think these kids' parents were exceptionally careless."
armenia,36zy1n,armeniapedia,1 point,Sat May 23 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"That's a bit one sided. We should call the men traitors, too, just to be fair. I'm an Armenian male, my SO isn't Armenian. That makes me a Benedict Arnoldyan?"
armenia,36zy1n,FrenkAnderwood,3,Sat May 23 20:56:42 2015 UTC,That's just a ridiculous statement.  Imagine how many Armenians have mixed ancestry from over the years.  I'm guessing all of us?  And you'd tell them none of them are Armenian?  That would no doubt include you and me! :)  You're Armenian because you feel yourself to be Armenian.  I know plenty of half-Armenians (and even quarter) who fit the bill.
armenia,36zy1n,TonyQuark,-1,Sat May 23 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is, that when Armenians mix, the probability that their off-spring will continue an Armenian generation are much lower than if Armenian marries Armenian. Obviously you may hear of cases when they end up Armenian, especially if they grow up in Armenia, but one growing up in Canada, with Canadian names, speaking English in the community, will assimilate quite rapidly.   As Armenians, we should encourage Armenians to marry Armenians, and discourage mixed marriages which put our nation at a great risk of dwindling in numbers. Just look at what has happened to the Assyrians.   If you are going that far, then all of us are Africans, and it doesn't matter who we marry, right?   It's like this.  Chance offspring will retain Armenian identity and culture, and pass it on to their children:  Armenian marries Armenian --> 99% Armenian marries non-Armenian (live in foreign country) --> 3% Half-Armenian marries non-Armenian --> .01%  Finally, any Armenian family that allows the boyfriend of their daughter live at their home for a month is not a normal Armenian family, and have some messed up values."

When you have a family with a foreigner, you stop becoming Armenian, and your family will never be Armenian.    So you've gone WAY past saying that only a pure Armenian can be Armenian.  You've actually said that a pure Armenian immediately becomes non-Armenian when s/he marries a non-Armenian.  Listen to yourself, you're off the charts.  Sure we don't want Armenian culture to die out, but we do that by accepting non-Armenians and sharing our culture with them and making it fun and easy to gain access to our culture.  Not by shouting publicly that they're outcasts.  I'm the one being realistic, you need to rethink how people think and what is productive and what is counter-productive..."

Western dialect speakers are a special group that cover a wider geographical region of the globe, and have done so much further back in time, but primarily since the Armenian Genocide. Being a dialect group that lacks official status, it is endangered and at a far higher risk of decline than its counterpart."

It was founded by Armenians fleeing the Arab conquests in the Armenian heartland.    Basically it was a major kingdom of the crusader armies in the Middle Ages. The Armenians and the Byzantines didn't get along that well and the Armenians formed an alliance with the catholics, so our ties with Northern/Western Europe go back a long way."

Some places (like Yerevan) are not at all humid, some places (lower elevations) have very mild winters and summers.  It all just depends.

armenia,36zy1n,TheByzantineDragon,7,Sat May 23 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"Here is an old comment I left in /r/travel about traveling to Armenia. I think it gives a nice overview:   Armenia is absolutely astonishing. For starters there are three UNESCO world hertage sites in Armenia.   Armenia is a very mountainous country with beautiful scenery but also has nice flat rural parts. There is a lot of history in Armenia with lots of old monasteries and medieval fortresses. There are also a lot of archiological sites, in Yerevan alone you can find the ruines of the ancient Erebuni fortress and the Bronze age settlements of Shengavit.  Armenia is landlocked but has large lake which also has nice and beautiful beaches and is perfect for watersports and because Armenia is mountainous it is also great for skiing in the winter.  Further there is a Stone Henge like structure in Southern Armenia called ""Karahunj"", There is Cave city where people used to live near Goris. And even further south you can find the Longest non-stop double track cable car in the world, called ""wings of Tatev"", which takes from a small village to a beautifull medieval monastery build on a large kliff.  And of coarse there is much more but to much to list.  And if you visit Armenia you could maybe also visit Artsakh(Nagorno-Karabakh) which has alot of awsome places too.   Another thing about Artsakh: ""3 op Reis"" has been there. So you can check that out too if you're interested.  Hope it was helpfull!  /u/armeniapedia is your guy to be for questions, advice and general information about going to Armenia. Hopefully he will be around here too today to tell more about traveling to Armenia."

armenia,36zy1n,mojuba,3,Sat May 23 18:01:46 2015 UTC,If you mean in terms of scenery then yes deffinately. I'm not a motorcyclist but guess you also mean in terms of roads and Armenia's roads aren't that good. They are getting improved and are better than a couple of years ago but still there are lot of bad roads with lots of potholes especially in rural areas.   But I have read experiences of motorcyclists that drove through Armenia and they are generally positive. So I think Armenia can be a great motorcycle experience but you have to prepare yourself for possible surprises.
armenia,36zy1n,BucketHeadJr,2,Sat May 23 17:36:07 2015 UTC,If you can still ride around the potholes then I can work with it.  How does the average Armenian view the foreign (motorcycle) traveller? From what I know the tourism industry isn't that large yet?
armenia,36zy1n,mojuba,3,Sat May 23 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah Armenia is often called ""of the beaten track"". And Armenians very hospitable if you for example enter a village there will always be someone who will invite you to their house and ask you to stay, but remember if you want to pay them for it they will refuse so it's best to settle that by giving them a gift like bonbons and wine.   Hope this helps"

I think the purpose of each subreddit is not only in the name but also in what meaning and what spirit the creators/mods and the users put into it. /r/Armenia in fact is not all-inclusive and it already has a certain flavor.

If there is one nation in the world where democracy could and should be applied to the fullest extent along its people and its diaspora, that country is Armenia.   The country only has two choices, 1) a virtually USSR state, what it is now, or 2) go west and embrace democracy and freedom with security risks and possible war.   Option 1 will be the destruction of Armenia. The policy of Moscow is to milk everything from everybody whom they can control and purchase mansions all over Europe for their families to escape and abandon when the ship goes down. There is no future for Armenia here.  Option 2 has clear risks of a war with Azerbaijan at the very least. But it is the only way forward.

It's an interesting article, a bit cryptic of course, but you can get the overall idea from the preface at least.  What I think though is, it's not genetic studies that should convince us there should be peace and understanding. What if our genetic origins were different? Seriously, why should it matter? Let alone that we, having so much in common are still at war.  What matters in reality, and what has more immediate down-to-earth implications is that we are neighbors and that hostility between two neighboring countries hurts lives of ordinary people. It harms the overall wellbeing and quality of life of both nations.  I think there is one keyword that should be used as a basis for getting closer to peace, and that keyword is respect. But I don't want to steal your genetic post, as that's a whole different topic worth a separate book ;)"
armenia,36v71c,mojuba,3,Fri May 22 12:58:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I agree to a 100% with you, but the reason I thought this was so ironic/sad was that our people have for the past decade been focusing on the differences of our respective people. I'm of course not implying that studies like these are going to change anything, but I like to think that if we can just put our governments aside (as I'm not particularly fond of mine) and try to connect to each on a individual level, there would be a much better chance of us getting along.   You are right about that, respect is everything in this conflict, and I think that many of us (from both sides) have forgotten that we both made terrible misstakes. None of us are perfect, and none of us will ever be that. Besides, I'm so fed up with reading different versions of history... I kinda think that this is the only thing that can be determine facts these days.  Be honest with me, isn't it at least a bit amusing that we are genetically much closer to each other than we are to both our linguistic and geographic neighbours. I don't know about you, but that kinda makes me smile. ;)  I'm a dreamer, so I cant wait to see the day when our people can walk down the street next to each other and be at peace again ."
armenia,36v71c,mojuba,3,Fri May 22 13:19:13 2015 UTC,"I like to think that if we can just put our governments aside (as I'm not particularly fond of mine) and try to connect to each on a individual level, there would be a much better chance of us getting along.   People do build personal connections, e.g. journalists from both countries, but there were cases when these people while (and because of) being public figures were marginalized and even criminalized in their own countries, maybe more so in Azerbaijan (traitor, Armenian spy etc.) So yes our governments suck, and unfortunately you can't always ignore the fact that they are largely in control. I always say that one important step for both Armenia and Azerbaijan to take is for each to clean up their own mess with corruption and authoritarianism. Only then it would be possible to even start thinking out loud, e.g. what to do with Karabakh. Right now it's a forbidden topic in both countries, i.e. there is only one opinion and only one way to go on each side.  And that's another big HUGE problem: propaganda. We have two powerful propaganda machines working 24/7 to make sure we stay hostile. Armenia's media is relatively freer (only relatively) but still when it comes e.g. to the news from the front lines, both can forge or hide facts and most of the time there is no way of knowing the truth.  I shouldn't tell you what some consequences of propaganda are, but just one fun fact for you: I got banned from /r/Azerbaijan for... nothing. For fucking nothing. For being Armenian I suppose. There is one guy on that sub who is very active, I PM'ed him once and said that he is welcome to come over to /r/Armenia, and that we have strict moderation rules that allow us to keep discussions calm and civilized etc. Instead they banned me, I wrote to the mod asking to explain and of course he never replied. That's propaganda at work :)   Be honest with me, isn't it at least a bit amusing that we are genetically much closer to each other than we are to both our linguistic and geographic neighbours. I don't know about you, but that kinda makes me smile. ;)   It does amuse me, and it's not news to me either. Here is a collection of interesting links on Armenian genetics. Btw, I remember the wikipedia article on the origins of the Azerbaijani people once stated that we share some 25% of genetics, but then it was edited. Nobody's allowed to know it :)"
armenia,36v71c,armeniapedia,2,Fri May 22 15:40:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  propaganda and freedom of speech is major problem in our countries. I mean,  we have a silent revolution going on in Azerbaijan where people are getting kidnapped and put in jail for demanding our democracy back.. Sadly this is hardly getting any attention abroad. I think that this is indeed the biggest problem, we are not allowed to have a real opposition in the country.  How do we trust anything that our government is telling us, that does also for Armenia. How do we know that our version of history is the right one,  and i think that it is this question that is starting to be asked in Azerbadijan. Because,  nobody wants this conflict to go on. It's hurting all of us. For the love of God we had thousands of Armenians living with us for years and A LOT were/are intermarried. So yes,  i agree with the notion that many people do not like Armenians in Azerbadijan - BUT i think it is because we had the idea of the Armenian monster killing us without remorse for such a long time (yes.. Damn propaganda) that some people actually believe you guys really hate us inherently.  But trust me when I say that does not represent a large group. People like my mother still remember the old days,  before the conflict, her best friend growing up was Armenian. The war didn't only hurt people physically but also emotionally. She moved to Sweden during the war with my dad, and she moved to Russia. She still talks to her every month or so. And as my moms says ""god damn russians for messing up the region"". The most hate people feel,  is not towards you but rather Russia for causing this conflict.  Yeah,  i read the whole article. The current theory that had the best support regarding this relationship is that Azerbadijanis were actually Caucasian Albanians and then ""turkified"". Which would explain the genetic similarities.  I think this open dialogue is something that more Armenians and Azerbadijanis should have in order to understand each other."
armenia,36v71c,armeniapedia,6,Fri May 22 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"Our genetic similarities are as easy to spot as me seeing peoples faces who remind me exactly of Armenians I know among the faces of Turks and Azeris...  I know this may come across as Armeno-centric, but I honestly don't think it is when I say the ball is not in our court for either relations with Turkey or Azerbaijan.  We simply cannot forget the genocide in order to move forward with Turkey.  We will continue to remember it and call it what it was, and things will never be right without some kind of move from Turkey on this matter.  With Azerbaijan, it's painfully obvious to the whole world that Azerbaijan cannot ever rule over the Armenians of Karabakh in any way, because I don't know that I've ever seen one country show so much hate towards an entire people as we see coming from Baku.  In all of history I don't know if there's been a similar case of banning an entire people from entering a country, regardless of citizenship.  Plus instances like the destruction of Jugha cemetery - which should have been submitted for UNESCO as a world heritage site, but was instead demolished.  And the case of the ax murdered being brought back to Azerbaijan as a hero.  This level of sheer hatred is incredible.  I'm not bringing all of this up to stir up negativity or bad discussion, but only to say that Armenia can't really do anything about any of this.  It can't hand Karabakh over to Azerbaijan, what can we imagine the result will be of that?  We can't just forget and stifle the memory of what happened during the genocide.  So what can we do?  As I said.  I think the ball is in the court of Turkey and Azerbaijan, and unfortunately their leadership is failing us all.  In Aliyev's case I think it's just very convenient to have an external enemy to take attention away from his corruption.  In Turkey's it's false pride, and not recognizing that coming clean is more honorable than pretending something never happened, or really wasn't as bad as all that.  Edit: I would add that the Karabakh conflict is quite convenient for the Armenian government to deflect attention from its shortcomings as well.  Though I don't think that extends to fomenting hatred in any way that I can recall."
armenia,36v71c,mojuba,3,Fri May 22 15:40:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to some extent.  First, let's not confuse Azerbaijanis with Turks - we are NOT turks (no matter how much ""some"" people want it to be true). Do we have very strong ties with them? Yes, but as a people we are not from the same roots. We are, at least according to this study (and many more), turkified Caucasian Albanians, originally probably Orthodox Christians just like you guys - and that's just a fact some people(azerbaijani and armenian) have to face. Sadly this is where the some of the problem originates.  Secondly, our President is not something the people of Azerbaijan are proud of - just ask any person on the street (figure of speech)- he is a self-entitled president with almost no support from the majority of the people.  Both of our governments are suffering from corruption. Sure our is greater than yours, but the problem still exists. And THATS a huge problem for us all. Both our government are pointing fingers at the other and yelling ""It's your turn, make your next move."". I mean common, there is just no way that this problem is going to be solved with the current administrations. Something has to change, and it has to change fast.  I think that people of both countries has been fed so much propaganda that the situation looks much different in each country. We have to learn to understand and as /u/Mojumba stated respect each other. We are neighbours, once even comrades, and we have to accepts each other's existence. And I KNOW there are more Armenians and Azerbaijanis that share this idea - I have met a lot of them here in Sweden. The people have to take control by at least be able to have civil and open dialogue with each other. It's the only we will survive. I know you guys might think that we hate you blindly - that is not true - azerbaijanis are just afraid that you are one hating them. Thats the circle of hate, and that is something that HAS to end with our generation."
armenia,36v71c,armeniapedia,1 point,Fri May 22 18:32:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to some extent.   Yes, we agree about a lot of things.  I think most reasonable Armenians and Azeris do.   I am totally on board with corruption being a huge problem.  I believe it to be Armenia's #1 problem, well ahead of the Karabakh conflict or anything else.  Karabakh is definitely problem #2 however, and they are certainly intertwined to some degree.  If I recall correctly, the current deal the Minsk Group has involves Armenia handing back most of the territory around Karabakh, peacekeepers coming in, a return of displaced people, and a vote in 10 years time in Karabakh on the future - whether they want independence or some other status.  Armenia and Karabakh are on board with this plan.  Most Armenians are as well.  It's reasonable enough, and I guess the 10 year wait is meant as a face saving measure for Azerbaijan?  We all know that this would mean independence, and/or union with Armenia.  So I disagree with you on this one.  I think Armenia is genuinely ready for a fair compromise, and Azerbaijan's government just talks about ""taking"" Karabakh back.  I don't know what most Azeris think, but I know that Karabakh cannot be ruled by Azerbaijan ever again.  I think Armenians agree, and I think the international community agrees.  I am not sure how ordinary Azeris feel - I certainly don't think they'd answer a telephone poll truthfully due to fear of their government.  I can tell you though that Armenians do not hate Azeris.  Perhaps a small minority, but it's just not a sentiment you hear or feel when people talk about Azeris.  I hope the true sentiment is the same in Azerbaijan, but I have to say I fear it might not be.  People want visitors to Azerbaijan not to talk about Armenia or Armenians - I don't know if that's because of the peoples reaction or the governments, but if it's the people, that's really sad...  I hope a civil dialogue will be able to take place.  I don't know how, because again, I see one government completely blocking it.  I'm curious what most Azeris you know think is a fair solution to Karabakh?  Do most Azeris truly believe that all of Karabakh should stay a part of Azerbaijan?"
armenia,36v71c,armeniapedia,1 point,Sat May 23 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that doesn't only go for Armenia but Azerbaijan as well - the only hurdle for our countries's democratic and economic development is this conflict.  To be honest, I had heard about this particular compromise before, but I do not recall ever hearing about the people that lived there before returning. The only problem I have with this is that there are a lot of new Armenian people that have moved there during the war so the proportions might not be the same as they once were. However, I, and most, do think that this would be the best case scenario.   Azerbaijanis are not hateful regarding Armenians, but rather feel betrayed by their own(you guys). And I think that it might that very thing that keeps fuelling this conflict. Because in our mind, even though Karabagh was under Azerbaijani government, you were running an autonomous state: you had your own schools/universities, your own language (which most Azerbaijanis do not have in Iran), etc etc. So I think that there is a perception that even if we were to agree to this compromise you would eventually not have enough. It might sound silly, but my mom used to make the analogy ""They were our best friend and now they are more like our enemies."". Many of the older generation remembers the better times, and are fuelled by the nostalgia. So I want you to remember me as the one Azerbaijani that made you to rethink your conception about this conflict; that Azerbaijanis are not inherently evil, do not blindly hate you, and certainly are not represented by the current administration.  Trust me, most Azerbaijanis are tired. They are tired of hearing of a new threat everyday. Russia, Iran and Armenia - we are faced with propaganda and real threats everyday. People just want to live in peace and not have to worry about an upcoming war. Nobody wants this, and I know I don't have to ask you the same regarding Armenians because in the end both our people have suffered enough - and I think it's our time to make a change in order to stabilise the region. Together we might even be able to make Caucasus the fastest developing region in the world."
armenia,36v71c,armeniapedia,2,Sat May 23 09:21:10 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with this is that there are a lot of new Armenian people that have moved there during the war so the proportions might not be the same as they once were.   Wikipedia says the Armenian population of NKR in 1989 was 145,593 (76% of population) and in 2007 was approx. 138,000 (95%). As for the surrounding regions there is no data other than the report from Yeni Azərbaycan that there are 14,000 people living there (how did they count it without having access?)  Just curious about the anti-Russian sentiment in Azerbaijan: how strong is it? Is it fueled by the official propaganda?"
armenia,36v71c,pandorascube,1 point,Sat May 23 09:51:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the problem with the situation is that different sources are reporting different numbers. So to solve the conflict we have to find a  reasonable way to deduce how many were actually living there.  I wouldn't call it ""anti-Russian sentiment"" but almost everyone agrees that the whole problem is either directly or indirectly orchestrated by Russia. Looking back, the conflict is a problem of boarders - boarders that had been undefined for many years. People, of both countries, were living across the lands mixed and together. So I think the main thought is that Russia deliberately tried to make the region unstable - so most of the blame is put on them, not the Armenians.  EDIT: No this is actually probably the opposite of what the government wants the Azerbaijani people to think."
armenia,36v71c,idontIikecats,0,Sat May 23 10:09:17 2015 UTC,"Armenians have told me a number of times they felt a kinship with Azeris, not so much with Georgia.  So I know many regret that things went in the direction of war.  I guess Azeris feel that with Karabakh having the status of Autonomous Oblast the Armenians should have felt satisfied with their status, but...  Armenians had a perception that the Armenian region was being treated poorly, and saw an influx of Azerbaijanis that the government was bringing in, and I think had good reason to see their future in the fate of what happened to the Armenians of Nakhichevan, where the Armenian population had gone from almost 50% when it fell under Azeri rule, to virtually zero.  With Karabakh it had already dropped from 92% to 76% if my memory serves.  Now I know that some of that was natural emigration, but there was clearly government sponsored Azeri immigration as well.  In addition, the connection to Armenia from this region was pretty poor.   So yeah, some different perspectives on the same situation...  In terms of settlement activity, I think there's virtually none to the east or directly south of Karabakh.  It's been to the west and southwest.  You can see it pretty well on Google satellite view, so I don't think the areas of settlement are (or can be) much of a secret.  So to the east and south return of refugees is no problem.  To the west and south I don't know how it can/would be handled, or what would happen.  One of the big question marks in terms of public disclosure is what the ""corridor"" connecting Armenia and Karabakh would consist of.  It would, we can assume, include the highway that has been built, including the former town of Lachin.  But how wide that connection is meant to go I don't think they've said.  But really, when Azeris talk about a solution, the future, what do they realistically believe can or will be the ending to the conflict?  And I doubt anybody would dispute that the Caucasus would boom with a resolution to this and some good governance!"
armenia,36v71c,tigranater,0,Sat May 23 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"(I apologise for getting back rather late, but Eurovision was on last night and Sweden won. So almost all the 20+s where out on the streets of Stockholm singing and drinking.)  I fully understand what you are saying, and I think that this is where the problem lays. People have different perspectives on the same issue, which doesn't necessarily render the other one false, but it does increase the tension.   I.eg. the immigration issue you brought up; one could of course see it as a way of increasing the Azerbaijani control in the province and I fully understand the fear, in fact Azerbaijanis would probably think that as well. But most of the Azerbaijani perspective are more in line with that the resources in the country was running low, due to the political situation in Soviet, so many where moving away from the bigger cities in order to survive. Or course, I do not know which side is right, but I think that there are always two different sides to a story that doesn't always negate the other one.  I believe that this statement from the USIP (United States Institution of Peace) sums up my idea pretty well:   Clearly, the absence of security guarantees is a crucial obstacle to resolving this conflict. The Armenians may be justified in feeling surrounded, but as long as Armenian troops occupy 20 percent of Azeri territory, it is difficult for Azeris to be concerned about security guarantees for Armenia. Some kind of collective security arrangement would be beneficial; in fact, within the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, instruments are available to the former Soviet republics to establish security arrangements. It is unfortunate, however, that setbacks in democratic reforms in both countries have weakened the ability of either government to have the courage to forge a compromise.   Source:United States Institution of Peace  As I was saying, the trouble of this conflict is that there are two different versions to the story, and our administrations are doing their best job in order to avoid a peaceful solution. That's what I'm so worried about.  I think that most Azerbaijanis wants peace, but are afraid that the compromises are going to threaten their existence, and I believe that this goes the same for the Armenian people. That's why it's so important for us to connect on a human level, not be afraid to talk to each other. We think of the other as inhuman and therefor forget that most of us human beings are just misguided.  I love that we are at this moment having this discussion, because this has probably pushed us as individuals closer to each other than our governments have in 20 years. Am I wrong?  EDIT: If you have the time, you should probably read up on the source I linked. It shows why both counties (governments) are at fault."
armenia,36v71c,armeniapedia,2,Sun May 24 11:45:16 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize, the conflict is unfortunately not going to be resolved overnight as we can see...  Certainly there can be different perspectives and they can both be right.  To some degree it's just an emphasis on where you feel wronged, while ignoring the others perception of what was wrong.  In this case we have to competing concepts.  Self-determination and territorial integrity (though Armenians would argue in this case that Karabakh was never a part of any independent Azerbaijan).  Most countries are afraid of the concept of self-determination and back territorial integrity by default.  Personally, I don't agree with that approach, because it's just a case of power structures in place trying to protect themselves and their power.  But now I've gone off on a bit of a tangent.  And here's a mini-rant about the USIP quote you provided, which already disappointed me.  ""Armenian troops occupy 20% of Azerbaijan"" is a huge fallacy that still gets propagated to this day (I realize this particular document is already 17 years old, but the number was obviously wrong then as well).  To get that figure wrong to me is a red flag that the person hasn't done their homework.  Why?  Armenian forces in Karabakh have control of just over 14%, not 20.  That's a HUGE difference.  And somewhat under 5% of that is the territory of Karabakh that is under Armenian control, which means that under 10% of Azerbaijan outside of Karabakh can be called occupied.  So yeah, I will look over the document regardless, but it's long so I haven't done so yet.  Btw, you can double check the numbers yourself if you'd like: http://groong.usc.edu/ro/ro-19970917.html  It's surprising to me to hear Azerbaijanis feel that a compromise would threaten their existence.  In addition to the fact that there are more than double as many Azerbaijanis in Azerbaijan, there are many many more in Iran.  I foresee one day Azerbaijan will be a big proponent of self-determination, when it suits them in Iran...  Another huge factor we forgot to discuss in this whole matter is how not only does this situation suit our governments, it suits Russia to a great degree as well.  It gets to continue playing us off of each other and selling us weapons and just meddling.  Man it's such a disaster.  I think talking it out is certainly helpful, and yes, I wish a lot more people could be involved.  I don't think Aliyev would allow it however.  When Azeris voting for Armenia in Eurovision are arrested and interrogated, when bloggers are arrested, it's just not an atmosphere where it is possible.  I don't know how this will be resolved, and regime change anytime soon seems unlikely for Azerbaijan and even Russia and Armenia.  So the people will continue to pay the price...  But again, I'm quite curious what you think a fair(ish) settlement would be..."

I used to think this would be Sargsyan's last term (constitutionally it is as president), but he is now trying to change the entire constitution and structure of government so that the Prime Minister would hold all the power, and he could become PM.  Remarkable.   I'm probably not educated enough in the subject but I think that the first step towards peace would be to find a new intermediary; that is not Russia, Turkey or Iran.   Well the Minsk Group is the US, France and Russia I believe.  I would also like to see Russia out of it, maybe bring in Switzerland or Norway or something like that.

I think that as far as I have thought about the problem. Now I wan't to know what you think would be a fair solution?   Well there's a solution I think is fair, and one that I think is actually a workable compromise.  These are two different things :)  To be honest, I think it's totally fair for Karabakh and Shahumyan to be given independence.  Full and without any preconditions.  Why?  Well Armenians have lived there for thousands of years, and were an overwhelming majority when it was given to Azerbaijan by the USSR.  So why not?  The only reason Azerbaijan has some claim to it is because the USSR gave it to them, and because of the demographics of Shushi perhaps.  Neither seems a sufficient reason for the entire area to be ruled by Azerbaijan.  I think any unbiased person when presented with the situation would agree it should just be part of Armenia...  so that's my totally honest opinion of what is fair.  What do I think is workable, and something I could live with for life to become normal again and peace to come?  I think the OSCE peace plan is about it.  It is painfully obvious that it would be a disaster for Azerbaijan to rule Karabakh ever again.  They should have spent the last 20 years treating Armenians especially nice to show that they are capable of governing Armenians in any shape or form.  Instead there has been an international racist campaign of hate the likes of which I don't think exists anywhere.  So if the compromise is to wait 10 years for a referendum to decide this matter so that Azerbaijan can save face and we can all pretend that an outcome other than independence is possible, no problem.  But other than that, all that really needs to be discussed are the final borders and the logistics of the rights to return of refugees...  I can't see the compromise realistically going beyond that."

But, I'll disagree with you claiming that the origins of Azeris are Orthodox christian Albanians. You'r country hates Iran, so you have been taught to disagree, but Azeris were an Iranian people who were then turkified, mixed with other caucasian groups, then taken from Iran by Russia. If you guys weren't Iranian, they why did you speak an Iranian language (old Azari) up until the 15th century.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Azeri_language  On that note, Yashasin Iran zamin."

And we do not hate Iran,  not at all. Some us might,  but most do not tend to hate them. I do however,  disagree with your assumption,  as the studies shows - we do not share the same ancestry as Persians. If anything, we are directly related to the native Caucasian inhabitance,  as shown by haploid count. We are more closely related to Georgians and Armenians than our other linguistic and geographic neighbours, including Iran(excluding southern Azerbaijanis) and turkey. And there is nothing wrong with that, if anything I welcome it. Its about time we got some real scientific answers about our origin,  that is not hearsay or propaganda.

In a similar vein we should not be owning territories that had Azeri majorities prior to the war.

In the same way Georgians were allowed to return to Abkhazia, or Serbs to Kosovo.  Azerbaijani government might not want it to happen, but the responsibility is on the Armenian authorities who are in control.

Not from America but still in a capitalistic nation (Aus) The rate at which Armenians are loosing their identity and assimilating is astonishing. Going to Armenia (in its current state) has no gain for me nor my country, what with the influx of refugees from the Syrian war and the country barley holding as an economy. Thats why we need it to expand, to allow us to go back to our home. We might fit in better then other minorities in different countries, but at the end of the day I (and i assume most of my fellow Armenians) hope and dream to one day go back to our lands.  I myself come from an ancient town in SE Turkey, and I know for a fact it is an absolute rundown shit hole, with ancient sites falling into disrepair and overall pretty much no growth. Now cue an influx of over 15 million to this village alone. Now multiply this across the pointed out areas.   Not only would Armenians benefit (for obvious reasons) but the Turks and Kurds and all else would greatly benefit from the economic and civil growth that comes form this repatriation agenda.   We could be as xenophobic and hateful as the Turks are to Armenians and not let any stay (which won't happen) but I assure you once the apology is made and proper things are put due, Armenians as a whole would put history in our past and look forward to once AGAIN working with our Turkish brethren, as we did for for centuries passed (albeit in the favour of one party)."

Not to mention that Iran, Lebanon, and Syria, all muslim countries, took in Armenians with open arms. You're a piece of shit dude. BTW, Iran is Armenias largest trade partner after Russia, your country needs us."
armenia,36mx0m,pandorascube,1 point,Thu May 21 23:11:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you generally, but it is also a known fact that religion did play a role in the 1915 events, as well as in the oppression of non-muslim minorities in the Ottoman Empire in general.  Having said that, we live in different times now and at least hostility on the basis of religion should have no place today. You know why the guy above said that from a throw away account? Because even he knew that what he was saying was wrong, that's why."
armenia,36n0ns,armeniapedia,2,Wed May 20 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"I think Russia won't mind an EU-Armenia agreement that doesn't go too deep into areas such as visa-free travel, as it's exactly where the association with Ukraine and Moldova are potentially heading (even before becoming full EU members). Armenia's borders are under the control of Russian border guards (yes, let's admit it - remember who caught Permyakov when he tried to cross the border), including the airport passport control, the geographic borders, the skies etc, so Russia wants only one thing: that it will retain its control for as long as it finds necessary. Thus the ""incompatibility"" with the EU association.  As for things like reforms, possibly even some form of free trade etc. I think Armenia and the EU will go ahead and sign something. Sargsyan probably already has an approval from the boss."
armenia,36n0ns,mojuba,2,Wed May 20 16:31:57 2015 UTC,Security relationship with Russia + political and economic reforms due to EU ties would be ideal.

armenia,36n0ns,mojuba,3,Wed May 20 17:58:02 2015 UTC,"Yup.  If only some countries in the west would just grow some balls and recognize Karabakh like they did Kosovo, and give some military support to Karabakh, we'd be in much better shape.  I think Azerbaijan has shown that they are completely incapable of governing Karabakh with their incredibly hateful actions.  Making an ax murderer a hero, destroying by far the best example of a khachkar cemetery in the world, barring any ethnic Armenian from entering Azerbaijan, and plenty of hateful/violent statements.  If they showed that kind of support, we wouldn't need Russia and would focus on ties with Europe..."
armenia,36n0ns,mojuba,2,Wed May 20 22:00:40 2015 UTC,"I agree that if these talks are taking place, then Sargsyan must have the okay from Russia.  I'm sure they're don't love the idea, but don't see too much harm.  I'd be curious to see how much of the trade barriers they'd allow to come down.  There's a lot of strange stuff going on with that, in the Armenia has free trade agreements with Georgia and the Eurasian Union, while Georgia also has signed these pretty much free trade accords with the European Union.  So technically, Russia has free trade with Europe via Armenia-Georgia, and Georgia has access to Russian markets through Armenia.  And even before all this Armenia had access to Turkey and Azerbaijan via Georgia and Iran, even though the direct borders are closed.  It's just a really strange mess and I wish all the borders were just open to free trade."
armenia,36n0ns,bokavitch,3,Wed May 20 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"Among other things there is an ongoing war of trade sanctions between Russia vs. the World (guess who is the loser). There was at one point this comical situation that Belarus was re-packaging and re-selling certain Western goods to Russia that were otherwise under Russia's trade sanctions. It's really messy, but the most interesting thing is, do Russians even know what they want? :)  In the meantime one other thing we can potentially hugely benefit from would be when the world lifts sanctions on Iran. At the moment we are very limited in what we can do with our (only?) friendly neighbor."

There is no double taxation avoidance treaty between the US and Armenia (yet). Why is the US reluctant to sign the treaty is not clear to me, but at least Armenia has treaties with most European countries. Whether you are subject to double taxation or not depends on the source, i.e. who is paying you and on what basis, but I know some people who are contractors receiving money from US companies and they pay taxes only in Armenia. Whether this is 100% legitimate or not I can't say."

Normally as an American the first ~100k of your income is exempt from taxes if you live abroad and don't pay foreign taxes.  It looks like living in Armenia would actually be a huge tax increase for me if I had to pay RoA tax rates.  As far as double-taxation legislation, my guess is that it's just not important enough for the U.S. government to get around to it. Hopefully with enough lobbying the issue can be resolved. I guess the RoA could unilaterally choose not to double tax American expats, though I'm not sure how that would be received.  It sucks because I'd really like to relocate and help grow the Armenian economy by spending/investing/living there."

You definitely need to consult an accountant, in fact both in Armenia and the US to be safe."
armenia,36aadf,armeniapedia,2,Sun May 17 19:46:59 2015 UTC,"It's not just double tax treaty countries. Any American who spends enough time living abroad in a tax year can claim the exemption, regardless of the tax treaty. The problem is that I would have to theoretically pay taxes to the RoA government according to local laws on income below 100k, then if I did earn above the exemption, I'd pay taxes to both countries on that additional income. That would effectively cap someone's income at 100k since you'd suffer serious diminishing returns on take-home income at that point.  My understanding of how it works in a double-tax treaty country, is that I would either only pay taxes to the U.S. after 100k, or only to the local country according to its tax law on all income I earn.  Could be wrong though.  I'm weighing the decision to relocate in the next year or two. I could definitely see a lot of young Armenian-Americans doing something like this, at least for a while, if they aren't getting killed by taxes."
armenia,36aadf,mojuba,3,Sun May 17 19:55:17 2015 UTC,It would be nice if Armenia instituted a special tax rate for people in this situation to attract them.  5 or 8% flat tax or something like that.

Are the Hamshen in Sochi and Abkhazia integrated into society, or are they secluded like the Muslim Hamshen? Sorry for all the questions, it's just fascinating to see a Hamshenahye on Reddit."

The Hamshen in Sochi and Abkhazia are a significant portion of the population in that region. When I was in Sochi, I barely spoke any Russian. Even the cops spoke Armenian with me. However, they are very integrated into Russian society there. They are Russian and Abkhazian citizens and live with the Russians and Abkhazians like Americans do with people from other cultures but they retain their separate identities. There are Armenian schools and they almost never marry non-Armenians. I have many family members who even fought in the Georgian-Abkhazian war."

Also, besides the Hamshen dialect, what's the ""conventional"" dialect you guys speak when interacting the non-Hamshen Armenians in Sochi? Is it similar to how the people from Artsakh speak to each other in their dialect, but can transition to the Yerevan (Kanaker) dialect with ease? From what I've learned, the Muslim Hamshen dialect is closer to Western Armenian, is that the same case with you guys? I'm assuming there is a lot of Eastern Armenian influence because of all the Armenians in Sochi and Georgia in general"
armenia,367hp9,yozgatsi,2,Sun May 17 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"Lol no the cops were Hamshen Armenian. We speak Armenian, it's just a different dialect. As far as I know the vast majority of Armenians in Sochi and Abkhazia are Hamshen. I'd have to ask my mother as she grew up there but I've never encountered or heard of non-Hamshen Armenians there. The Armenian schools there teach eastern Armenian so my mother is fluent in both dialects, and while I can understand quite a bit of it if spoken slowly, never going to Armenian school I have a hard time with both eastern and western dialects."

Is there any animosity between the two groups? What about any difference in the language spoken by the Christian Hamshen of Sochi/Abkhazia and the Muslim Hamshen from the Hamshen villages in Turkey since the Muslims keep to themselves more, while the Christians integrated into society in Russia and Abkhazia.   Also since you were never taught Armenian , there are lots of resources available if you're interested in learning the language."

I don't know much at all about the Muslim Hamshen, as I've said in my original post I only heard about them a couple years ago. I have heard however that their dialect has become very different from ours and incorporated a lot of Turkish words. And I grew up speaking Armenian.

armenia,367hp9,haf-haf,3,Sun May 17 07:57:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know that there is a ""general"" opinion about them.  I think most people in Armenia know about them, but much fewer in the Diaspora, since many Diasporans aren't exposed to much Armenian media.  Those Armenians who know about them know that they are of Armenian origin, and I'd imagine most consider them Armenian.  But probably not all of them since I have once or twice heard the (in my opinion silly) sentiment that an Armenian cannot be Muslim."
armenia,367hp9,armeniapedia,3,Sat May 16 22:59:57 2015 UTC,"Part of my family is from the Black Sea region (ordu) so I have a soft spot for this topic. I love Hamshen music and try to read up on them when I can. I firmly believe they're Armenian, and would gladly encourage them to get closer to us and (re)establish some sort of relationship with Armenia and other Armenians from Turkey. A few years ago a Hamshen group from Turkey called Vova (translates to Ov a) played in Yerevan. I'd love to see more of this! Geography isolated them from Armenia and Armenians in Cilicia, so they've developed distinctly over the past 200 years, not to mention the catastrophic effect the genocide had on Armenian civilisation had a role in that. At the end of the day they are our sisters and brothers and we should treat them as such and try to learn from each other."
armenia,367hp9,ParevArev,2,Sun May 17 07:28:03 2015 UTC,"We got a sister page on facebook. It's mostly dead because we don't know much about the Hamshentsits to make content. The little we learned is that they're basically split into two parts, those that left Hamshen and settled in Abkhazia, Sochi, Crimea and are now mostly Russianized, the song you posted is from that part.   And of course there are those that stayed in Turkey who in turn are split into two parts, those that somehow preserved their Armenian identity, and those that consider themselves a separate ethnicity.  Later are mostly islamized now. The women you see in the video doing a shurjpar (circledance) are from the Turkish part.   There is a journal/periodical/newspaper that is published in Armenia and is available online called Dzayn Hamshenakan (Hamsheni Voice). Its in Armenian and Russian. Don't know why they don't do it in Turkish, since that is the most vulnerable group  http://www.dzaynhamshenakan.org/ https://www.facebook.com/Hamshenball"

armenia,363bnw,ajano2006,2,Sat May 16 14:47:16 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget about the quality of education in Armenia. A non-industrial country with poorly performing economy can't provide good education by definition. It's almost impossible. I'm sorry if I offend someone here, but for example the State Engineering University is a joke and the best graduates who can be more or less competitive on the job market are all self-taught.  There are several fundamental reasons the Armenian economy is not performing well, and the quality of education is definitely one of them. But then without the economy you can't have a good educational infrastructure and staff."
armenia,363bnw,mojuba,3,Sat May 16 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"I find the comments interesting but I still don't think that's the answer  8% of population is large  It should be a very attractive place for foreign investment based on low housing cost of living and overskilled labor that's not being optimized.  That should be a hotbed for innovation.  Sure armenia has a lot of political issues with its neighbors but the stability even with those barriers and reach reach of its diaspora should help in reducing those risks for larger corporations  So what is the real cause of this?  Its not quality of college education  Csun and 90% of USA colleges are shitty and still many of the alums are successful people.  I don't attribute any of my success or failures on my formal education it's life experience and tenacity which I believe Armenians have after 100 years of fighting...hell its gotta be in our blood at this point after all the centuries of wars massecares and everything, everybody left has already survived against all odds."
armenia,363bnw,ajano2006,2,Sun May 17 02:11:18 2015 UTC,"As someone who went to college in the US, I can assure you that it's largely a joke here as well. Likewise, it's only the self-taught people who are passionate that are worth a damn in any field.  Only difference between here and Armenia in that regard is the amount of debt that most Americans get stuck with."

armenia,36369h,Michaelpr,7,Fri May 15 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"The centennial was just three weeks ago so there's been a lot of activity and commemorations going on. For that reason there's been more discussion of the genocide than usual on here. I wouldn't take that as a representative example of Armenia, Armenians or even this subreddit."
armenia,36369h,bokavitch,6,Fri May 15 19:55:23 2015 UTC,"You're mistaking Reddit for Armenia. Of course it's part of who we are, but we don't obsess about it day to day unlike many individuals of this subreddit might make it seem. Also, I suspect that most individuals here are not from Armenia, as most Armenians are not and haven't been since 1915. That and I have only ever seen one post here actually in the Armenian language. Otherwise they are all in English.   Another thing to think about, is that you are comparing the Armenian genocide to the holocaust. There is no country I know of that denies the genocide of the Jewish people. The holocaust ended with massive trials and the execution of those in charge of the murders. The Armenian genocide had no such justice. And to this day many countries because of Turkish political influence will not call it genocide, including the U.S. even though the vast majority of the U.S. states and the EU have recognized it as such.   It pisses the Armenian community off that even after a hundred years or ancestors still have no justice.   But to answer your question, no it is not like that in Armenia. It is much more like your experience in Israel. When I went to Armenia, during my whole stay there I never heard any talk - that I can recall - of the Armenian genocide except for when I visited the genocide memorial museum."

armenia,36369h,armeniapedia,2,Fri May 15 21:28:43 2015 UTC,Two things. First its a big part of the Diasporas lives more than the natives.

There WAS quite a bit of genocide exposure fairly recently - Wether or not it was 8/10 of the posts doesn't matter.   Forgive my haphazard response, it's late and I'm sleepy.  In the case of the Jews and Israel, justice was served - though financial reparation (from after the war well into the 21st century) is hardly adequate compensation for the murder of millions, It's pretty much all you can do/expect aside from forcefully dismantling the Nazi state and admitting guilt.  The Armenians have had no such closure - the aggressor state has actively denied the genocide ever taking place for decades, pouring countless millions into their denial campaign. Worse still, they have [attempted to] scrap any mention of us once existing there - going so far as to destroying countless ancient relics, renaming many our cities, entire geographic locations (""the Armenian Highlands"" and ""Armenian Plateau"" to ""Eastern Anatolia""). Hell, they even managed to rename certain species.  Imagine if the third reich reemerged three years after crumbling under the banner of the Fourth Reich. Imagine they spent the next 70 years spewing nonsense about how it was a war, and during war people die - there was no holocaust. Besides, it wasn't us - that was the third reich, and the jews were rebelling."

I'm assuming it's a genuine question and not another attempt to troll or annoy us, here is the key difference between the Jewish and Armenian genocides: the latter is still denied by Turkey in the hope it will ""expire"" and eventually get forgotten some day, if they try hard. Holocaust is widely recognized as a crime against humanity and  its denial is criminalized in many countries."

armenia,3630ba,Tsovitstsov,2,Fri May 15 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"Western Armenian evolved to have various shifts in pronunciation from Classical Armenian, so we have many letters with the same sound. I acknowledge that this is stupid because Eastern retained the proper pronunciations from Classical, and it makes no sense in Western to have 38 letters but fewer distinct sounds. For example, Բ an Փ are ""P"" while Պ is ""B"",  Գ and Ք are ""K"" while Կ is ""G"",  Դ and Թ are ""T"" while Տ is ""D"", Ձ and Ց are ""TS"" while Ծ is ""DZ"", and Ջ and Չ are ""CH"" while Ճ is ""J""  This is also a reason why there are so many blatant mistakes when some try to transliterate, especially from Western to Eastern. I've seen so many idiotic transliterations, especially when it comes to names, like Գաբրիել for example. Western Armenian pronounces that as Kapriel, Eastern as Gabriel, but when you get a Western Armenian named Kapriel and the Armenian media reports about him, they end up spelling it Կապրիել, which is 1. incorrect and 2. not properly pronounced when read in both Eastern and Western"
armenia,3630ba,yozgatsi,2,Fri May 15 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"(Eastern pronunciation is actually Gapriel. The Բ -> Փ etc transformations exist in the Eastern language too, but are not prevalent.)"
armenia,3630ba,mojuba,1 point,Fri May 15 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe Գաբրիել wasn't the best example, but Գրիգոր works also. We both spell it as Գրիգիր, but one reads as Krikor while the other reads it as Grigor. I've seen instances in Armenian media where a ""Krikor"" from the diaspora had his name written as Կրիկոր, which is just ridiculous."
armenia,3630ba,yozgatsi,2,Sat May 16 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, Գրիգոր is spelled Grikor and never Grigor, but I see what you are saying.

Explenation: It's not a difference between Eastern and Western Armenian, which are the standard languages.  It's a difference in older orthography from the 19th century and the newer called, reformed, from the 1920s with also some changes in 1940s.  Both orhtographies can be used for both standard languages."
armenia,3630ba,Tsovitstsov,1 point,Fri May 15 18:29:29 2015 UTC,Yes but I think technically you can still call them Western and Eastern grammars as the pre-reform one is not used in Armenia.
armenia,3630ba,mojuba,2,Fri May 15 19:03:23 2015 UTC,"Uhm, no. Armenia is not the only place where Eastern Armenian is spoken, it's also spoken in Iran where they use traditional orthography.

The lending terms in Armenia are pretty crappy.  I'd imagine they're available for foreigners, but not sure.  Mortgages are for shorter terns (maybe 3 to 10 years?) and interest rates are high.

armenia,361w1t,armeniapedia,2,Fri May 15 16:41:17 2015 UTC,"General sentiment on RE and stability?  Hmm, it's been stable for a while.  Armenia's real estate market is effected by the rest of the world, especially Russia.  After the post-Soviet collapse it was long decline in the 90s, but it went way up in the 2000s, like the rest of the world, and collapsed when the global market tanked as well.  Since then it's gone up a bit and then stabilized.  Because so many people own their property outright, and many people who live abroad own property and can afford to sit on it, to some degree that sets a kind of floor for the market, since many people decide they just won't sell below a certain price.  So that keeps prices from dropping when they otherwise would.  Now Russia and Armenia are forecast to have a recession.  Unless oil prices shoot up, and the Ukraine related Russia sanctions end, it seems unavoidable.  That will negatively affect the market.  Maybe a good time to buy?  No foreign buying groups are active.  Diasporans are active in RE development and construction, that's about it.  Everyone got their homes for free after the collapse of the USSR.  So everyone had 100% equity.  So there was some buying/selling based on that money, there was money that came in from the outside - relatives, Diasporans, that sort of thing.  So no, it's the opposite of what you think.  Most people own and never rent."
armenia,361w1t,vartanm,1 point,Fri May 15 19:00:35 2015 UTC,wow a lot of people own their house out right?  this is incredible.    if thats the case then anybody making money either is saving a very good amount or is spending all they get in which case its probably not a bad idea to open a small business or some sort since there is actually discretionary income.  why then are armenians moving in masses to other countries?  all i hear about in los angeles and other major US cities is how expensive everything is and how they cannot afford to buy there are no jobs etc.  highly employable labor force....relatively affordable life... this seems like a real opportunity for companies so there must be something i am not understanding and need to look into probably in a much more up close ground level.

armenia,35yoee,Dasweb,-1,Thu May 14 21:58:51 2015 UTC,Language is not near as large of a factor as compared to where you or your parents were born when it comes to naturalized citizenship. So not quite sure what you're argument is...

armenia,35yoee,vartanm,0,Fri May 15 12:31:12 2015 UTC,"Right... so we have inequality here. What if you are an atheist, simply non-religious, muslim, buddhist, judaist, but still you like to identify yourself as an Armenian?  Here is what Ireland does: anyone who can prove at least one of their parents or grandparents were born on the island of Ireland (which includes both the Republic of Ireland and NI) you can apply for naturalization. Armenia could do something similar, e.g. grand- or grand-grand parents born in any of the historical Armenian provinces OR if you have a baptismal cert. That would cover a lot more people I think."

However, one of my grandmothers was from Van and had an Armenian surname. Other grandparents were Vanuatu, Zulu and Dutch.

That's the thing, the current criteria for Armenian-ness is partly copied from the Israeli naturalization process (religion matters) and is partly based on Lenin's understanding of nationality, i.e. that nationality = ethnicity and that it should be specified in the passport. That is such a middle age racist nonsense.  Did you know that Obama theoretically qualifies for Irish naturalization through descent? :) His grandmother was from Ireland. That is all that's required: place of birth of an ancestor. This would've worked perfectly for Armenians."

He's been doing it for years. The rhetoric is nothing new but his desire for it has led him to the ends of depravity, seeking it out at the enemy's bosom.

armenia,35ppu8,Tsovitstsov,1 point,Tue May 12 14:26:50 2015 UTC,Why did Armenia sign the cease fire? They were a month away from Baku and full Azeri collapse.

Armenians didn't need a war and never wanted one."
armenia,35ppu8,arronsky,2,Tue May 12 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"Very helpful to know the context. That said, it was our peak negotiating strength, and we signed a cease fire that has never been respected."
armenia,35ppu8,vartanm,5,Tue May 12 23:45:56 2015 UTC,"As Tsovitstsov said, both countries were exhausted. Us being able to take Baku is a myth (Why do we need Baku anyway?). Fighting in the plains and trenches is a lot different than in the mountains. The best  course of action would've been taking Yevlakh and Mingechaur. That would cut off Gandzak (Ganja) from rest of Azerbaijan and eventually give us all of that northern part as well. It would make the front-line with Azerbaijan significantly shorter and virtually cut them off from Georgia."
armenia,35ppu8,mojuba,2,Wed May 13 10:45:58 2015 UTC,"An honest question, not trying to rub it in.  If you did get Yevlakh and Mingachevir, would you objectively justify warmongering and occupational attitudes of Armenia towards Azerbaijan?"
armenia,35ppu8,vartanm,3,Wed May 13 11:49:49 2015 UTC,"My opinion is, it would be difficult to justify that as it wouldn't immediately contribute to NKR's own security, plus at the time it was predominantly Azeri populated. Shahumyan would be a different story though."
armenia,35ppu8,vartanm,2,Wed May 13 13:15:26 2015 UTC,"Honest answer. I was saying that by looking at our current map and analyzing the current situation. Armenia would be in better position to shorten the frontline and cut Azerbaijan from Georgia. If what I said was done in the 90's We would most likely take pride in liberating Shahumyan region, and Gandzak (Ganja).   But overall as I said, both countries were exhausted. And when we take into account that most of the Armenian fighters were from Artsakh and were fighting for their own homes. Then naturally we should expect that they wouldn't want to risk their lives to ""liberate"" Ganja and Azerbaijanis of those villages and towns would fight just as hard for their own homes."
