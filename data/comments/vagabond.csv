A few things I've noticed .... 1 is easier to train a young kitty to travel than an older one. 2 leash training is necessary and takes patience. 3 use lots of treats and petting and encouragement. 4 the more trust you and your kitty have in each other, the easier it is. 5 along with leash training, it's good to train them to ride in a breathable pet backpack that way you can take them in stores, houses, etc etc and they are safely inside the bag in case they get nervous around strangers. There's tons more I can think of but the points I listed are the most important I think."

I unfortunately had issues with my van when I first got here which cost me a good bit of money, so I haven't been able to do much but hang around Golden a lot.  I'm hoping to get something going business wise that I can do on the road.

It definitely made me smile to hear people being bold enough to sing about the money they want from people  Some people  don't see swearing as obscene or unfit for children. This is also, where... Bristol? I don't think people in the city of Bristol care about swearing, the UK is kind of lax on that kind of formality. At least when it comes to people singing on the street I guess.

vagabond,3dtcqq,uncleyam,5,Sun Jul 19 06:56:15 2015 UTC,"First from the stuff you listed you're gonna struggle to fit it in that bag. Like not really struggle just its not gonna fit.  Get a bivi, its smaller. You can get the military surplus modular sleep system (Bivi, Warm weather bag, Cold weather bag) on Amazon and elsewhere. The Bivi is goretex and weighs around 1kg (2lbs 3oz) and the warm weather bag is more or less the same weight and good for down to 30f/0c packs reasonably small.  The bigger sleeping bag won't fit in your pack as well but its good to have. You can use them all together to sleep in really cold weather..  Don't spend money on a water bottle/holder just get a plastic bottle from anywhere it's lighter and works fine.   You can get lighter bivis and sleeping bags that perform the same but cost more.  North face make good sleeping bags, but they're expensive. If youre willing to spend the money I recommend the lynx ($140) I think they have a lifetime warranty on it.   Rab make expensive bivis that are lightweight and made from event and goretex (event supposably breathes a little more but needs more frequent treatment).  You also get a sleeping bag for next to nothing that'd be fine for summer but won't last as long or give as good performance to weight/bulk and sleep in a trash bag that weighs next to nothing.  Don't get the solar battery thing if you think you're not gonna use it :P dead weight/bulk is the worst. Is the compression sack for.your clothes? I'd just get a simpler drybag in small.or medium depending on how much clothes.  Also are you gonna take a small pot or something to cook in? And bring lighters, soap and a small knife.

vagabond,3dtcqq,Jim1o1t,5,Mon Jul 20 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"Traveling what states and staying urban, staying rural, or going mixed? It will effect what gear you need.  As a general rule, you should be able to wear almost all your clothes at once(perhaps not all the socks and underwear) and have everything fitted to do so.  I'd skip that thin pack for a Jansport Trans for $35. Bigger, tougher, and a lifetime warranty. Might not be quite as light or comfortable though.  Go bivy.  Dump that sleeping pad, use salvaged cardboard or other material instead.  Dump the canteens, get a Powerade bottle and a Food Jar instead http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00408LQN8 if you really want to keep stuff hot or cold and still be able to  actually wash that container out.  Go with strong thread, bring a few needles and always keep one pre-threaded.  Bring along some high performance wicking underwear(2 or 3 pair) and high performance hiking socks(6 pair). You budget allows it and that will make a difference.  Zip-off cargo pants and a pair of gym shorts will be more versatile and take less room than what you've chosen so far. A belt will be needed.  A wool beanie and a trucker hat cover most warmth/sunblock needs.  Fleece or sweat pants might be a good idea, especially if you are staying urban(don't want to zip up your bag if people can come upon you but need to stay warm). Be sure to size your pants so you can wear this under them.  Skip the solar panel, go with a battery like this and a quality USB to Outlet converter http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0084Y47SK   Far as first aid kits go, store bought is all crap. You'll need to assemble the following: Self-sticking bandage, 4 styptic gauze pads, styptic pencil, 12 bandaids, antibiotic ointment tube, antifungal foot cream tube, the 50 pill bottle of aleve(pain relief and fever reduction if you get sick), toenail clipper, and tweezers.   What does your hygiene kit look like? I suggest a stick of solid sunblock, a mirror compact, a high quality disposable razor and a pack of spare blades, a tube of Nutragena shaving gel(will last most users a whole year), safety scissors, toothbrush, travel size desensitizing toothpaste, floss, and earplugs on a cord(to keep bugs out of your ears when needed). Bar shampoo will reduce the chance of unfortunate messes http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00016X68Q/  You'll want a good can opener http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B000AX13US . Cooking is really optional and pots and pans will just add weight to your already heavy load. For silverware I just suggest grabbing some gas station plastic utensils and swapping them out as much as you can.  Also, treat your clothes with THIS to keep bugs off http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B001ANQVZE .  A personal suggestion? A waterproof camera like a Olympus in a case."

Honestly, the pad isn't a bad idea going rural cross country, and since you will be doing some of that I'm changing my suggestion to ""yes, take that.""  Some people do well with P-39 or P-51 type compact can openers, I prefer full size. Personal preference I guess.  Here is a link to that shaving cream http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Sensitive-Shave-Cream-Ounce/dp/B005M32XR8 . It is economical and compact.

It's not people doing things for tradition it's just for survival and common good.   Traditions wont survive unless they stay relevant. It's tradition isn't a good reason to do something to me. If it's a good thing to do I'll do it.

The frat boys threw a Red Mountain party (RM was a type of cheap wine sold in gallon jugs) and it was an ""all you can drink"" deal for $5.  I woke up, hung over as shit, less than three feet from a three story drop onto a concrete patio.  It scared the bejeezus out of me.  In fact, just thinking about it now gives me the creeps.  There was no railing, no wall, no NOTHING, and I was super plastered drunk.  NEVER, EVER AGAIN.  EVER.  It was a thousand times more dangerous than any train ride I ever took, but it was because I was such an idiot and made such poor choices.  Just sleeping on the roof was no big deal.  It was doing it while shitfaced, crazy drunk that was the problem."

vagabond,3dg2by,Jim1o1t,5,Fri Jul 17 00:15:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of people do this in Europe. There's nearly always external fixed ladders after the first storey so with a bit of climbing skill you can reach them quite easily. If they only have internal access i dont bother with them. You want a quiet place that you can leave before it opens and climb in the dark, or you run the risk of people thinking you're a burglar and calling the cops. Obviously watch out for skylights on low buildings and step carefully. The easiest place to do this for me is those outlet type places where they have a bunch of shops on a chunk of land a little outside town. Almost always flat roofs and easy to access. Plus its a good opportunity for dumpster diving.  Residential buildings are a bad idea because the roof is often in use even if its not obvious. I once tried a random building and woke up to some dude shouting at me, locked me on the roof and called the cops, I managed to climb down and hide before they got there but was shitting myself."

You can picnic and even collect berries and mushrooms on other people's land - as long as you respect the land and take only your share.  In the last couple of decades there have been issues with it. As immigrant populations have swollen, there are many people that do not have the Scandinavian culture ""baked in"", and Everyman's Right has been abused.  People leave trash and damage property.  It's a very serious thing, since it exposes the schism between Scandinavian hospitality and tolerance, and the reality of having populations that do not respect the culture of their host country.  It's a significant contributing factor to the resurgence of right wing nationalism in Scandinavia."

vagabond,3ddsq3,CooCooCooCoooo,2,Thu Jul 16 15:11:21 2015 UTC,"Not exactly.  It is not legal to use deadly force against trespassers who are not threatening your life or the life of another person, but ""threatening the life"" can be defined in a variety of ways.  Hunting on someone else's land without permission could lead to an armed confrontation between the landowner and the trespasser.  Anything less than immediate surrender by the trespasser could be construed as a threat.  Technically, trespassing ""while armed with a deadly weapon"" is called ""criminal trespassing,"" and you could get state jail time if convicted, but probably not prison time.  Regular trespassing is a form of misdemeanor. DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS, Texas law authorizes the use of deadly force for a long list of crimes: murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, rape, attempted arson (but nor arson itself,) theft (yes, THEFT, if the victim has reason to believe there is no way to recover their property) and so on.  Simply put, it is ""open season"" on criminals at night in Texas.  Going up to someone's home at night is a very dangerous thing to do.  If you absolutely must approach someone's home at night, knock on the FRONT door, and back away from the door, but still in the porch light.  Do not be surprised if the homeowner answers the knock with a pistol in his hand.  There is definitely no right under Texas state law to be on someone else's property to pick berries or anything like that.  My advice is to strictly stay OFF other people's property.  Obviously, people tolerate the neighbor kids picking berries or shortcutting across a pasture, etc., but definitely not strangers.  And definitely not people hunting or fishing."

vagabond,3ddsq3,anywhereness,2,Thu Jul 16 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"Correct.  There are wide open spaces that are unfenced out west, but it is very rare in populated areas of Texas.  ""Unwelcoming"" is kind of a pejorative term.  One cannot go on to another person's property without his or her express permission.  The property is not just ""everybody's"" property.

I've applied the same principle to camping in 'public' land in England, making sure to always be discreet and keep a clean camp, no fires during daylight hours, everything in Olive green and camo print, and never had a problem. The places I choose to camp are out of the way, I camp 'light' with a hammock and tarp, I'm barely visible and the few people I see tend to be the odd dog walker.

If anybody gives you a kitchen match, you would be wise to get your gear and depart that jungle immediately without saying another word.  You have no way of knowing whether or not if they are willing to seriously harm or kill you.  You have no way of knowing if they are armed with firearms.  It doesn't matter.  If they give you a match, it's tantamount to saying, ""Leave immediately, because you are NOT WELCOME HERE."" I've seen a few scuffles in jungles.  The worst one was a gang fight over a woman, and it was not pretty.  Just because someone is big and tough doesn't mean that they can't be taken down one way or another.

vagabond,3daa90,fugneyen,6,Wed Jul 15 00:11:09 2015 UTC,"Very few of the men I met riding trains back in 1970 considered themselves to be rebellious or opposed to ""regular society.""  Many of them were military veterans, the older guys from WWII or the Korean War, and the guys closer to my own age recently discharged Vietnam veterans.  Most of the guys I met worked at least part of the time, often going back to the same employers year after year for seasonal work, doing things like picking apples, working the wheat harvest, the green pea harvest or corn harvest.  A lot of them had mechanical aptitude, and knew a lot about repairing cars, construction, operating heavy machinery like bulldozers and backhoes, pipeline work, welding, working on offshore drilling rigs, shipping out on cargo ships and other jobs of this nature.  They gravitated towards ""boomtown"" type work. The idea that a woman might be riding trains ""by herself"" seemed pretty foreign in 1970.  It was dangerous enough even for teenaged boys, much less for women.  I didn't see many women riding trains back then.  It was pretty rare even to see a couple riding together. The men I met riding trains in 1970 considered themselves to be part and parcel of regular society, generally speaking, and other people in society saw them (more or less) as regular citizens who were temporarily down on their luck.  People like me (I was 19, and rode into my twenties) were much more opposed to the ""regular straight life"" of working 40 hours a week and paying bills.  I was opposed to the war in Vietnam and politically committed to resisting it.  The older men, in particular, who had served in the military when they were younger had a sort of resentful pride in having done so.  They had no choice (they were draftees, for the most part) but after having served, their attitude was kind of like ""I did what I was asked to do, and so can these kids today.  Quit bitching and get on with it.""  I was a member of the I.W.W., but I found very little support for my political viewpoint  among the older tramps of 1970, but the younger guys who were more ""hippy-ish"" were more tolerant of it. A lot of the young tramps I see today seem to see themselves as alienated from the larger society altogether, and they seem to be deliberately doing everything they can to garner contempt and hostility from the larger society.  In 1970, we were trying to blend in, to ""fly below the radar.""  Young tramps today seem to have a lot of misplaced trust that the larger society is not able to crush them, and I see this as arrogant naiveté.  The larger society is quite capable of stepping on malcontents, and if provoked enough, may choose to do so.  Unfortunately, regular trainhoppers will be swept up in the net, too."
vagabond,3daa90,Renoind81,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:39:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's interesting that you point out how some of the older tramps of the 1970s resented, and were unsympathetic to, the sentiment of younger more anti-establishment tramps--but then you go on to criticize today's younger tramps for willfully alienating themselves from society, having hubris, not flying under the radar, etc.  It sounds like the older tramps of the 1970s would criticize your younger self (and the hippies you were implicitly associated with) in precisely the same way that you're criticizing today's younger tramps. Like: ""Resisting the draft? Opposed to regular society? Quit bitching! You're going to draw attention to us regular trainhoppers!""  Here's a practical question: How can you resist regular society, political repression and such, while flying totally under the radar, when the radar is regular society? If you were really going to fly totally under the radar you would be a 9-5 working, endless-war-supporting, SUV-driving, credit-card-dependent, cable-tv-consuming, patriotic American.  I realize that there are obnoxious asshole tramps out there that can skew ""regular society's"" perception of tramps in general, but don't you think that a general ""kids these days have no respect..."" attitude has the potential to end up blinding you to the legitimate grievances of young tramps?  I also realize that my impression of you as a scroogey nay-sayer is a straw man, but I wonder if there's some truth to it."
vagabond,3daa90,mad-fedora,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"There is definitely some truth to it, more than just a little, but I feel no obligation to be consistent with somebody else's ideas of what is appropriate.  The old guys in the 1970s DID criticize us, AND THEY WERE CORRECT.  We were wrong, we just couldn't see it, any more than the nose-ring/dreadlocks crowd can see it now.  It took years longer than it should have for my generation to assume leadership roles in industry, government, religious institutions and so on because we were so pigheaded about how ""right"" we were and how ""wrong"" the Establishment of the 1960s-1970s was.  I supported the civil rights movement, I fought against the war in Vietnam (got tear gassed, etc.) but it infuriates me to see where it has gone.  Back then during Jim Crow and segregation, about 24% of black children were born out of wedlock.  Today it is MORE THAN 75%.  Back then a small proportion of people were on welfare.  Today about 80% of American school children are on some kind of government assistance--free meals at school, Medicaid, CHIPS and so on.  Back then minority kids were getting a quality education from mostly black teachers.   All this ""progress"" we fought for backfired, and things are worse now than they were then.  There were a few street gangs back then, but the ""hip-hop"" generation has murdered 20,000 young minority boys in gang wars.  I did not sign on for this disgusting shit.  It's like every single thing the rednecks said would happen if our society stopped oppressing blacks came true.  It is causing serious polarization within our society.  Do you imagine that civil war cannot happen here?  No one should be so naïve as to think that.  Donald Trump is only voicing what millions of Americans feel.  They are angry.  And they feel betrayed.  We didn't sign on for transgender, multi-racial, illegal alien Army Rangers.  We supported the aspirations of decent law-abiding people to have civil rights.  We did not sign on for face tattoos, nose rings and a society that borders on the insane. Faced with a low-income, no-education future and a family to support, I came in off the road, went to college, got a career and did my best to take care of my family.  I was dead broke when I started.  I am no genius.  If I can do it, anybody can do it.  There is no excuse for people considering public assistance as a career choice.  People must support themselves, and do so legally.  I have no desire to ""resist society.""  It's a fool's errand and only leads to a bad end.  Me resisting the draft was a waste of time and energy.  Trying to destroy the present society without some feasible plan for replacement is like pulling the pin out of a hand grenade.  It's just a really bad idea.  Our efforts to improve things have made things WORSE, not better.  The misbehavior of the Flintstone Kids is going to destroy trainhopping.  They are poking the tiger with a stick, and foolishly imagining that they are going to win.  They aren't.  They are just going to wind up causing a very undesirable overreaction from the tiger."

vagabond,3dcbs7,tundra72,4,Wed Jul 15 03:58:01 2015 UTC,"You have pretty much accurately described the ""college dilemma.""  If you go, it costs a lot.  Student loan debt never goes away, and the Federal government will start seizing assets and suspending licenses, etc. eventually to get their money back if you don't pay them. If you run up $20,000 in student loan debt, how are you going to pay it back if you DON'T graduate from college?   'Cause the government does want their money back. Trying to make a living without a college degree is not easy.  I worked and supported a family with a high-school diploma for 14 years before I finally gave in and went to college.  As long as you are single and young, it ain't too bad.  But once you form a serious long-term relationship or a marriage, things get tougher.  And once you have a kid, you are in it up to your neck.   I could somewhat support the idea of a high-school graduate delaying college and bumming around hitching and riding trains.  But once you start college, you need to finish your degree and go get a JOB.  You are never going to be in a better position to finish school than you are right now.  As you get older, things only get tougher and more complicated.  If you are having doubts about your major or something like that, NOW is the time to figure it out.  After you start your third year, changing directions gets a good deal more difficult and expensive.  For me, higher education was about getting a career to make money.  I didn't go to college until I was 36.  I didn't start education for  my present career until I was 43, and I got my degree when I was 45.  I am now close to the end of my career, and about to retire.  When I started back to school at age 43, I was making about $8.50 an hour (about $17,680 a year.)  Today, I am making about  $75,000 a year.  (I'm not bragging about it--I do the same job I've always done, but as you get more experience you get pay raises.)  Me going to college made an enormous difference in the economic life of my family and our ability to send my daughter to college.   I knew that If I didn't go, my daughter would not be able to go.  I'm not going to lie--- I missed riding trains every minute of those 20 years, because I was only rarely able to go catch out.  But now I'm getting close to retiring, and my plan is to make up for lost time.  You have to set priorities.  I chose the well-being of my wife and daughter over me living a free life.  In different circumstances maybe I would consider a different path, but I had a six-year-old daughter who was going to need college money in twelve short years.  So I went to school and graduated, and started working my ass off and saving every dime I could."
vagabond,3dcbs7,SunsetRoute1970,3,Wed Jul 15 06:36:53 2015 UTC,"Depend on what career you're seeking to complete. IMO, your life will be no different with or without a college degree. Instead, if you could during the time you settle down, seek for hands-on training which offer legit cerfiticates, such as plumbing, welding, mechanic, electrician, carpentry and construction. I obtained plumbing, construction and carpentry licenses; they helped me get jobs on the road, almost anywhere in Canada during my hitchhiking trips."
vagabond,3dcbs7,mad-fedora,3,Wed Jul 15 04:24:50 2015 UTC,"Doing something that passionate you is always the right thing to do, if for example astronomy or medicine passionate you then yes I would say college is worth it. It's wrong to think that high income can only be achieved by the most educated people, I know a guy who dropped out of high school who makes more than a doctor running a business on the internet, and that guy knows more about the world than I do. Was college worth it for me? No, I left home as soon as I was done with it and I haven't came back yet. If I do decide to settle down I want to try to work for myself, I could've dropped out of high school and It wouldn't of made a difference in my life. What about you? Only you should be the judge. Be what you want to be, not what the society thinks you should be, you want to be free and live on the road? Screw what others thinks, do it! You want to go to college and become a lawyer? Do it! What would make you happy? Ask yourself that question and the answer will  always be the right thing to do."
vagabond,3dcbs7,Alivingy,2,Wed Jul 15 06:30:51 2015 UTC,"Well, it is useful for some things, and not as useful for others. Going to college facilitates intellectual and social activity, it keeps your mind in a state of learning, and it can, if done to completion, make your resume look better.   From my limited experience, however, the people who benefit most from the college experience don't really need to be convinced why college is the way to go. A lot of people accurately claim that there isn't too much you can learn at college that you can't learn on your own; but the point is not that you're able to learn it, but that you DO learn it. Most people aren't self-driven and disciplined enough to pick up knowledge to the depth that is learned in a formal college atmosphere, unless they are in college. We all may fancy ourselves as self-taught geniuses who just aren't motivated but the fact is a big chunk of the difficulty in learning is the discipline, repetition, and work required.   Similarly, if you're interested in starting a business, inventing something, or doing something creative, I don't believe college is necessary. College won't teach you how to write a screenplay or build a successful business, but it can teach you skills that contribute to doing those things.   In short, of course college is not necessary. But if you find yourself drifting, being in an intellectually stimulating environment can help focus your interests towards something you care about.  College is meant to develop a career, not a passion. So if you have the means to develop your passion without sinking 10, 20, or $30 000 into an education, do it."
vagabond,3dcbs7,railroadjake,2,Wed Jul 15 05:22:43 2015 UTC,"This is the conflict I currently face, except I've only become more interested in continuing college as I spend more time on the road. I'm really interested in improving and planning cities so they function better, and seeing poverty and homelessness in major cities the past few weeks have only intensified this passion. However, I'm also interested in traveling and writing, vagabonding is such an addicting lifestyle at my age. My volunteering plans for the next month just fell through as of tonight, and I have another month before the next semester starts. Having spent the past few weeks on the road I'm practically broke but every sign says travel while I can. I really found the critical thinking, multicultural literature and economics classes stimulating over the past couple semesters so it's hard to convince myself to call it quits half way through. An interesting crossroads indeed."
vagabond,3dcbs7,cannabisandcaffiene,2,Wed Jul 15 05:40:47 2015 UTC,"See if you can either graduate with a 2-year degree from the school you're at, or (more likely) transfer credits and finish up your Associates at a community college. You've put in the work, get the credit for it. If you decide to go back to school, it's a lot easier to be accepted and only take the classes you need if you already have the degree. If you're getting Pell grants and state aid, you could be paid to go to school to finish up the 2-year. Not to mention that even just having a 2-year degree in basically nothing seems to be good at job interviews, since it shows you are capable of showing up to something for more than two months at a time."
vagabond,3dcbs7,RiotGrrrl585,2,Wed Jul 15 12:12:52 2015 UTC,"We've all had this problem. It's going to be a bigger problem as overpopulation gets worse, degrees become more common and more useless, and the remaining available jobs get filled.  I stayed in school and graduated and I am glad I did, although I came extremely close to dropping out several times. In 2008 I had the chance to move to California to just become a waiter with a girl I liked, and I almost did it. Around 2011 I had a chance to travel with another girl from West Virginia to California with a horse, and I couldn't because of school. Around that time I got into permaculture, and all I wanted to do was convert the world to a sustainable food forest. In 2010 I went to a few Rainbow Gatherings and met people who had finished their degrees, and people who were simply runaways, drifters, vagabonds, hitchhikers, and I wondered what it meant to be really free. There were times when I hated school, when I felt that all it did was hold me back. But I hung in there and I finally did get my degree. It took three years longer than it should have.  Since you have been in school for two years, there is an option you may not know about. Go to your admissions office (or some relevant office - they may send you to a few different offices for this, man that brings up bad memories) and ask them for your associate's degree. My university had this as a ""secret"" option and I only found out about it by asking around. Most universities won't give you associate's degrees because they expect you to stick around for your bachelor's, but if you ask around you will likely find that they will give you this degree if you have the right number of credits.  With your associate's degree firmly secured, you can relax a bit, travel for a semester or two, enjoy your youth without worrying about losing all your credits. If and when you decide to go back to school for your bachelor's, it'll only take you two years because you have your associate's. It's exactly like doing two years at a community college first and then finishing your bachelor's at a university, but you've done both at university so it was more expensive.  Perhaps you are in the wrong city or state. Perhaps you stayed at home to live with your parents, which can really put a damper on your early 20s university experience. Perhaps you are not studying something that interests you.  I do recommend you keep having an education open as an option. Try to finish school.  My bachelor's is somewhat ""useless,"" but it can get me in to get a master's program. I recently lived in a city and discovered that I love urban planning because part of the reason why many of our lives are so shitty is because we live in suburbs.  Eventually you may discover a career path you like. Another option is technical school. People used to shit on it but it's turning out to be a smarter investment than university. One of my buddies went to technical school for two years and now he's got a niche career involving dentistry which is so highly paid that he can actually afford to live in his own place."
vagabond,3dcbs7,the_broccoli,2,Wed Jul 15 14:53:41 2015 UTC,"I graduated high school and went to the local community college. I hated it, thought it was crap and traveled. Now I'm back in school waiting to transfer to a university. Taking time away from school helped put things in perspective for me. For one, I hate manual labor and retail, and those were the only jobs I could feasibly get sans degree.   I originally went back to get an Economics degree, but the math melted my brain so I switched to my original major: English. It's not a particularly glamorous degree, but I've always liked writing and now I want to get serious about it and become a better writer. I certainly don't need school for that, but there are a few big things that influenced my decision: for one, I get ~$10,000 a year to go to school via Pell Grants and Work Study options (I work for a radical English professor); second, my tuition is covered because I'm eligible for the Board of Governor's fee waiver.   So after traveling became less exciting to me I had the option to live in a nice place for a few years and go learn stuff for practically free. It wasn't a bad trade-off.   Anyway, I think you should definitely take some time off and clear your mind. If you wind up back at college, you have to adjust your mindset: they're degree mills for some people, but there are also students and faculty who are passionate about their subjects and don't care about employment prospects.  And again, you don't need schools to learn things, but I think they're valuable because information is concentrated in them. The local community college has one of the first Chican@ Studies departments in the nation. One of the local universities has some of the top-ranked cognitive scientists in the world. Sure I could probably meet with them one on one and learn a thing or two, but to be able to study under and work with those people is a much more engaging experience I think.   That said, college just isn't for everyone. I thought I was one of those people for many years. Do what feels right to you, but don't do things because you think you should do them.   (edit: for you and anyone else -- if you plan on returning to college, check out financial aid options! I think once you're over 25 in California [whenever you're no longer a dependent] and your income is under a certain range, you're eligible for the $5645 Pell Grant and BoG fee waivers...hell, register for 4 online classes, pocket the cash and do homework while you're sitting in the hole waiting for a Z train to pass!)"

It cost me a fortune, limited my travels for 4 years, and forced me to work far more than I would have liked. I'd like to tell you that I regret it completely, and that you should leave, but I'm kind of glad I did it.  For one thing, I actually enjoyed my degree. The subject matter has always fascinated me, and I loved the intellectual atmosphere and the people I met.  The things I learned haver come in handy too. It all seemed pretty abstract when I  studied it, but it makes for great conversation material and helps me better understand and navigate the world. It has also made my experiences richer. I like looking at the world and interpreting it with the ideas and theories and background I learned in school that I likely never would have discovered on my own.  And finally, just having a degree opens up options. I'm considering teaching English in Chile, something that would be near impossible without my degree. All in all, my useless education has been pretty worthwhile.  But I've met lots of dropouts who are doing well, and are glad they didn't stay in school. And your situation is no doubt different. For one thing, I graduated without debt, which may not be feasible if you're studying in the States. In the end, everything's pretty unpredictable, so there's not really any choice that's guaranteed to work out better than the others. But don't forget the less obvious benefits of a degree."

I just want to weigh in on a few things some stuff might be redundant but bear with me.   do not get into debt- there are very few exceptions to this rule but in high school some people I worked for said this was an overarching rule to follow and it is for sure your #1 rule if you want to live an at least part time transcient lifestyle.   don't earn a degree in something you don't need a degree in- great example; languages. universities have a broken system of teaching foreign languages. want to be a translator? the only thing people care about is if you are fluent or not. other examples are computer coding, and the fine arts, graphic design.  be passionate about what you're studying and have an end goal.self explanatory. if you don't know what you want to do. spend time on the road and in nature and let your intuition speak to you. it will come, you just need time to step back and analyze yourself.  hope this helps, good luck"

You want lots of foot traffic with people who aren't trying to get anywhere fast. Touristy spots are perfect for this, especially if they have bars around."

There might be some section for free (or very cheap) stuff in your region on Craigslist, but there might be better websites where you live. I am sure that there are some bulletin boards in your area. You can write a request for free or very cheap things that you need. Also, you can try to go to a local flea market just before they close - if you explain your situation (or just be friendly), some people might be happy to give you things they did not sell, so they don't have to bring them back home. Finally, there are many NGOs and churches trying to provide people in need with clothing, showers, places to sleep and food. It is summer right now, so I would not focus on winter clothing first. Start with what you can get and then improve step by step."

vagabond,3d8ex1,JLSMC,13,Tue Jul 14 10:02:31 2015 UTC,"How to get gear:   I would say you check out dumpster diving (kontainern auf deutsch;). It's ridiculous what get's thrown away because of damaged packaging or similar stuff. Not only in regards to food but also when it comes to equipment and more expensive stuff. I have a few outdoor shops that i check regulary. That you find good stuff in the bins there is rare but it happens. Found a sleepingbag there for 240€ with a small cut that i've sewn together. The glorious internet! Check out Facebook groups like Free Your Stuff Berlin or other local sharing/ giveaway groups. You can write down what you plan to do and people will smypathize with your idea and probably help you. If you also offer the rest of your shit they will love you. But you will still need a bit of money. Easiest way to get it without finding a real job and without becoming a criminal is: Festivals! You can work there to build up the place or even better: help cleaning it up. I worked on a pretty big one (>30 k visitors) not only did they pay good money but they basically take everyone who asks. If they don't have anything written on their homepage just call them and ask. You even find money, drugs, tents, camping, gear, sleeping,bags, matrasses etc. You can pick up the empty cans there and make good money off it. 100 € (400 cans at 0,25€/can) per day isn't difficult if you go there to work and not to party. It's also a great place to start because there are shitloads of people who are relatively open minded and who drive long distances.   How to use you're last 14 days: Prepare yourself for the trip. Get all the vaccines that you can get for free in germany, let doctors check you if you're fit to do this trip, ask them for information. Get basic stuff, like a good knife (check the laws of the countries you want to visit first), a prepaid emergency phone, fisihing hooks, tape, a sleepingbag (check what gear /r/backpacking would recommend) etc. If you need basic medical stuff. Go to the next junkyard and ask them for outdated first aid kits. Loads of people leave them in their car. Outdated is still better than nothing at all.  Backpacks are comparably cheap. That one is preety good for it'S price and really light.  If you realize you are not able to do this, because of financial reasons, health problems or any other thing. DON'T DO IT! There are a lot of social security nets in germany. I know it can be hard to admit that you're unemployed and desperate for help but you don't have to feel bad. While you had a job you (hopefully) paid your taxes and that is what they are there for.  If you're not here illegaly there's literally no reason not to get help!  If you have any more questions/want more tips write me a private message. You can write in english or german (I'm german myself)  Good Luck"

vagabond,3d7jjj,plantsforhigher,11,Tue Jul 14 03:14:49 2015 UTC,"I have a regular job now, and have had for several years.  I'm getting close to retirement age and how much you get in Social Security and a pension depends on how much you made the last couple of years when you were working.  So I don't get to spend a lot of time outdoors lately.  The last time I did get to catch out was between jobs, and my riding partner and I spent a month riding trains.  It was in late September/early October and it got pretty freakin' cold up north for this Southern boy.  We were sleeping outdoors in weather as cold as 25 degrees with snow. The more layers of insulation you can put between yourself and the cold ambient air, the better.   What the insulation does is trap a layer of air, and allow it to warm up.  A completely waterproof barrier (like a deflated cargo ""air bag"") is good if it's wet outside, but not so good if it traps the moisture from your body and your breath.  The moisture can condense on the inside of the air bag.  A little bit of ""breathability"" is not a bad thing.  This is why I prefer a tarp or air bag ""taco.""  The tarp stops ambient moisture (rain, dew, snow) but allows moisture from my bag/breath to dissipate.  If you have a cheap bag, but you can put it inside an envelope of static air by putting it inside a tarp taco, you just enhanced the ability of that bag to keep you warm.  My buddy used to carry several sleeping bags and he put the smaller, thinner bags inside the larger bags, wrapped up in a tarp taco and then slept on top of a blue camping pad, on top of several layers of cardboard.  I'm sure this sounds like way too much trouble, but when you are sleeping outside in the cold and have no alternative it doesn't seem like too much hassle at all.  The colder and more windy it is, the more I wish I was in a tent.  The wetter it is, the more I wish that tent had a 5x8 rain tarp flown over it for a rain fly."
vagabond,3d7jjj,SunsetRoute1970,6,Tue Jul 14 03:48:54 2015 UTC,I used to live in my truck in the winter and even with a good bag it can be tough. Mine was rated for 20°F and some nights it would feel like I was sleeping without one so I would wrap myself in a blanket inside and wear a hoodie some nights. If your going to sleep in freezing cold I would suggest some sort of shelter to keep the dampness off of you.

Protect your head! That's where you lose most of your heat. I use two layers: a nice, tight fleece one, and a cheap sloppy one over that Put your clothes between your pad and your sleeping pad, spread out as much as you can. Exception is your (thermal) undies. Do jumping jacks until you can't, then get in your tent without your clothes, but with hat. If you wake up from cold, put your clothes on. Get some thermal underwear. Army surplus should have some cheap ones. Stuff crumpled newspaper under your top, and around your crotch ...and if you need to pee, pee in a bottle INSIDE your bag, and leave it by your feet. Hope it doesn't come to that :)"

vagabond,3d4shd,Mjunp,12,Mon Jul 13 15:00:06 2015 UTC,"I use a bear can. There's a few different sizes and models. They're a bit on the heavy side, but they are honestly the best way to keep your food away from every animal out there. For me, I'm not so much worried about losing my food, that would be annoying but not that bad. I'm worried about accidentally letting a bear get a taste of human food. If that happens you have straight up killed that bear. It won't stop looking for more and that will make it a problem bear. Once it tries to get into a house or a car it will be shot and killed. If it's a momma with cubs, the cubs will be killed too.   In grizzly country the safest way to go is to never eat where you sleep, don't wear any clothes to bed that you wore while you ate, and stash your bear can at least 100 yards from you, and out of site of your shelter. Ideally don't cook next to where you store your bear can either. Form a triangle with the three places, sleep in one, eat in another, and store your food in a third place. The chances of having a bad bear encounter are low, but your chances of surviving a bad bear encounter are even lower so extreme caution is warranted.   Hanging food only works in a very few specific locations. In grizzly country if the tree is not big enough for them to climb it is small enough for them to knock over, so that isn't even a worth while option. It can work well for black bears but again, only certain types trees will work and it can be a bitch finding a good tree."
vagabond,3d4shd,4amPhilosophy,3,Mon Jul 13 15:24:46 2015 UTC,Damn dude I never realized bears were this fucking vicious. That's some crazy shit.
vagabond,3d4shd,symzvius,4,Mon Jul 13 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"Bears are not vicious... Depending on what you call a bear encounter 99.9% of the time you will survive one. If the encounter starts when the bear attacks you then you're unlikely to survive but up until.that point you have very good odds.  Also black bears are the proficient climbers, grizzlies can also climb trees but no where near as well as its awkward for them.  In general bears are fearful of people and will stay away unless literally starving or if they become desensitised because of people giving them food or finding food near people. Either way generally peoples fault that bears go anywhere near us in the first place.  Generally you have nothing to worry about, but there's no harm following simple.precautions already mentioned and sleeping with food is definitely not a good idea."
vagabond,3d4shd,Jim1o1t,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That's what I meant by ""bad bear encounter,"" once an attack starts. Most normal bear encounters are a quick view of the bear's ass as it high tails it away from people."
vagabond,3d4shd,4amPhilosophy,5,Tue Jul 14 21:40:15 2015 UTC,"The best way to deal with bears is to reduce your risk of an encounter in the first place.  So, learn how to keep your camp clean. Practice and acquire the tools to hang your food and keep your clothing free of food smells. Also, consider eating less smelly stuff and ALWAYS cook away from where you camp.  Bears can smell fiercely good. People make the assumption that all animals have the same senses and sensitivity as us humans. Could you smell a pack of mentos that happen to be 1000' upwind?"

I'd hate to have to kill a bear, but I would not feel safe in an area where bears frequent unless I was armed with a rifle .30 or bigger.  A .30-06 would be plenty.  I had someone tell me once that a .357 pistol was enough gun for any wild animal.  I was thinking, ""Not for a grizzly bear it ain't."" Bear attacks are pretty rare, but I avoid anywhere I think I am likely to encounter large wild animals because carrying firearms while hitching and trainhopping is pretty much contraindicated."

I grew up with a fair bit of this going on-'I will trade you two point-of-lay chickens for a sack of potatoes' rather than 'I will repair your jeans in exchange for supper'. The point about bartering or using alternative currency is that you need to be part of the economy to use it which deters casual theft; someone might steal your money, but they're more likely to overlook crystals (and chickens), and they're more recognisable if someone within your circle did the stealing.  Another thing I've noticed about travelling people is a considerable degree of 'tribalism'; it's very conspicuous in the Irish travelling community, and still present with more new-age types. A separate economy reinforces that."

vagabond,3d1c3c,AesirAnatman,24,Sun Jul 12 18:33:15 2015 UTC,"I've figured out a cheap, minimalist, no-fridge, vegan, raw or stove-only, 100% nutritionally complete meal plan that I could rely on for a while. (For a week's food it costs ~$40 and weighs ~17 lbs   Please do share :)"
vagabond,3d1c3c,tundra72,3,Sun Jul 12 20:19:40 2015 UTC,Frito's and Oreo's i would bet
vagabond,3d1c3c,jamecquo,2,Mon Jul 13 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"Hey! Sure. This is the diet I mentioned in my post:    2 medium-sized potatoes  1 medium-sized sweet potato  3/4 cup dry lentils  1/2 cup almonds  1/4 cup chia seeds  1/4 cup sesame seeds  1 brazil nut  1 kiwi  1 tsp additive-free iodized sea salt  1 daily D3 supplement  1 weekly B12 supplement    You can check it out on cronometer.com if you want. It is basically 100% nutritionally complete (it's like 1 or 2% deficient in a couple nutrients – something that will be covered when you fill in caloric gaps with whatever you want). The 3/4 cup of lentils can be swapped for 1 can of beans or peas (any legume, really) and maintain the same essential nutritional profile. The kiwi can be swapped for many other fruits with C and potassium and be basically as good (banana, orange, etc.). Kiwi's are just delicious and light. I imagine cooking 1/4 cup of lentils for each meal, and 1 potato. The lentils cook in 40 minutes of simmering and the potatoes will cook in 10 minutes of simmering if you cube them first. The best way to eat the chia is to put them in a bottle of water and shake it up every few minutes for about 15 minutes. The chia will turn into little gel-balls that you can drink in the water.  Also, I did some thinking and realized that if you swap out the 3/4 cup dry lentils a day with 1 can of navy/great northern beans, then there are a few advantages. 1) You don't have to wait 40 minutes to cook your food, just 10 minutes to cook the potatoes and throw in the beans until they are warm. 2) Navy beans have tons of calcium allowing you to cut the amount of sesame seeds you need to eat in half (and eating 1/4 cup of sesame seeds a day is a lot!). There are also 2 disadvantages. 1) A can of beans weighs more and costs more than raw lentils in a bag. 2) Canned food is processed and usually has BPA lining and a high-sodium content.  That's a balance an individual would have to weigh on their own. Anyway, here's the framework diet if you swapped lentils for canned navy beans:    2 medium-sized potatoes  1 medium-sized sweet potato  1 can navy beans  1/2 cup almonds  1/4 cup chia seeds  1/8 cup sesame seeds  1 brazil nut  1 kiwi  1 tsp additive-free iodized sea salt  1 daily D3 supplement  1 weekly B12 supplement    This diet is calorically short, although nutritionally complete. It's not quite 2000 calories, and you'll probably want to be eating more calories than that if you're travelling a lot. You're nutritionally covered, so figure out how many more calories you want/need and get the difference from whatever you want. The healthiest options for calories would be grains, legumes, or fruits. The cheapest would probably be grains or legumes (rice/amaranth/wheat-noodles or more lentils/beans/peas). However, a little sugary or oily food here and there won't kill you (though avoid trans fats as much as possible). Last, have some berries, dark leafy greens, broccoli, mushrooms, etc. when you can. While nutritionally you're fine, these foods have tons of antioxidants and phytonutrients that you don't strictly speaking need but will improve your health a lot.  That's it so far, anyway."
vagabond,3d1c3c,chisono,3,Mon Jul 13 20:39:29 2015 UTC,"I've been on the road 6 years, and stealth a lot, so want any cooking short. I  boil everything in one pot. Red lentils cook fast. Yellow lentils next. Brown and Green lentils take way too long.  In pot, add water, red lentils, boil. Turn off heat and by the time it cools enough to eat, they are done. Can also wrap cotton/wool clothing around the pot to keep the heat in longer - a must when the temps drop. Another thing is soak grains, beans over night, or better: sprout them.  Nutrition profile changes when you sprout. Soak overnight, and then rinse each day for a couple days, depending on the temps again. Chickpeas and peas are my fav. Sprouts are vegies - and need way less cooking.  Brown rice will also sprout - reducing 40min + cooking time to the boil and turn off method."

vagabond,3d1c3c,KetoEater,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"How do you prepare the sesame seeds?   Throw em in for the last few minutes with your food as it cooks, and eat them with the beans and potatoes (or whatever you cooked). Putting about 1/3 of the sesame you'll be eating in the day in each meal makes them a lot easier to eat, too.   Also, is the D3 really necessary considering all the time most travelers spend outside?   Depends on what time of year, what region, the person's skin color, how much time they spend outside, etc. You'd need to figure out based on your own habits whether you need the supp. I put it on there so people don't walk around with D deficiencies thinking they're totally covered.   I'm also curious about keeping cookware clean on the road. I know lentils and potatoes aren't too sticky, but when I cook rice (in my apartment) I always end up having to scrub the pot with industrial dish soap and hot water.   A good question I'm still working on. Alas, I don't live on the road quite yet. I will pretty soon though. I stopped using hot water and dish soap a while ago at home. Most stuff cleans just fine with cold water and scrubbing with your fingers. The only stuff that doesn't clean like that is oil. So I just don't use any oils - problem solved. My question is: where am I going to get water to wash my 2 or 3 dishes? Maybe a river in the wild or a water fountain in a city. But what if those aren't around? Do I NEED to wash my dishes off with water? I'm not sure."

Also food banks and going into anywhere that makes a set amount of food per day and throws out leftovers(esp. pizza) and asking for said leftovers. Something I've done a couple times is call in a pizza order close to closing time, not picking it up and then asking for it as they close. I only do this with chains.

I don't know what to do about packs of fucking pigs man. Shit! Most of them scatter, but just about 50 60 feet and no farther. All the largest boars stayed about 15 to 20 feet from me. I slinked past, continuing on the trail, keeping my eyes locked from boar to boar, as they grunted and stomped a little. I finally went around a corner and lost sight of them, quickening my pace. I'll address my ''face to face with a cougar'' story another day. Then there's the old ''the rattlesnake struck my ankle twice, I didn't know what was tapping on the side of my boot, so I looked down and watched it strike my ankle the third time, and stepped gingerly and swiftly back a ways.''

Be able to leave when you want and you are all good. I know a woman who has done over 40 wwooffs. She gives it a 60/40 good to not so good ratio. I have a friend who has been at it non stop for a few years and he is now hooked up with high end caretaking for rich people, and right now a ''accompanying tourists on their adventures'' Alaska job. He is wayyyyy out there, on a private island where it costs like $750 a day for rich fuckers to ''rough it'' with chefs and luxury in pristine quiet. It is well worth it to spend time doing workshares, as it can lead to big things. That same friend was caretaking/odd jobbing for some rich folks in NM, and they took him to Hawaii to be like a fucking houseboy, but they stayed in all inclusive spa resorts and he didn't have to do shit. He tired of being a lap dog ''friend'' and split. I met him at a 5 star AAA super high end restaurant/B&B we both lived and worked at.

This is rich people caretaking and they don't want parties, thieves, slobs, whathaveyou in their homes. During the winter, many many fancy resorts have ''The Shining'' jobs. It is a very real thing.

It was dark and he arrived at his destination, about 90 km east of Regina. This fucking town's population was about 100 I was hungry and thought about getting something to eat at the town's diner I saw on our way in. So there I was, walking out in the dark night on this street of the town with a few lights on, and I was heading to the diner.  This town reminded me of the creepy ghost town from the movie Children of the Corn. Very similar. Anyway, I entered the diner, and the first sign of creeps I got was the extremely unwelcoming atmostphere. Every single creature which had eyes in that diner pinned on me. I was sweating and tried to make a friendly smile. Then this old hag from a corner walked up to me and said I'm not welcomed here, plz gtfo blah blah. I gently told her I was very hungry and may I buy a small set of meal. She shaked her head and walk off. I then walked torward the server who stood at the serving counter and about to order some food. Then I heard chairs pushed around me, I immediately turned around and could not believe what I see. Every mother fucker in the diner stood up, some was holding weapons like knife and hatchet. I saw a guy with a rifle. There was at least 10 people. Without saying anything, I walked out the diner as fast as I could, run all the way back to the farmer's car, get all my stuff and run with my life torward the highway. I never looked back. Walked non-stop for about 2-3 hours, which was probably 5-10 km away from that zombie town. Camped near the highway torward Regina. I slept with my eyes open and with my sweaty hand on my most trusty knife. Woke up at 5 and ate a canned tuna with tortilla that I brought along. Then at 6-7 AM something managed to hitchhike along with a human being who was also going to Regina. When we entered outskirt of Regina, I nearly cried. Stayed there for about a day and I took a bus to Saskatoon, then from there I took a Greyhound bus straight to Edmonton. The whole trip, I just wanted to get the fuck out of Saskatchewan as fast as I could, even it cost me a lot."

vagabond,3d1wpa,AesirAnatman,2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:28 2015 UTC,"1: Read. Watch the clouds, just think about things. I spend a lot of time repairing gear - clothing mainly - sewing on patches.  2: Tried being cold, not noticing, ignoring people. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Now I just be friendly to everyone. It's only for a short time, so be nice. Never know when you might really need help and that person would be the one. Or, the person you piss off is the one that throws a rock at you the next time they see you. Be friendly and courteous to everyone, it doesn't cost anything.  3: I have a small pocket knife, for cooking with only.  First off, avoid confrontations. There is no way you can 'win'.  If that doesn't work - run! If you can't run away, then using a knife for fighting is still bad idea. Besides the problems of carrying the knife, the skill needed to fight with it, it takes a long time for someone to die of a knife wound. Blunt force trauma is quicker - blow to the head will put someone down faster.  Blow to limb  will put that limb out of action.  Carry a stick/staff - that you can use for walking with. But better yet, avoid confrontations in the first place and run. 4: Don't know. At first I talked to anyone traveling. Now I don't and mostly avoid travelers. It helps that now i travel more remote tracks so see less people. Though, they do tend to stop and ask the same questions over and over again.  Most people are on a holidays, a trip or a tour.  I ended up answering the same questions over and over again. The reward for return isn't  high."
vagabond,3d1wpa,chisono,2,Wed Jul 15 00:34:21 2015 UTC,"You can carry knives as long as you use them as tool (at least for Canada). This is legally speaking so you won't get in trouble when being asked or checked. Of course, you could use them as weapon. US laws for blade are more lax than our, so you're going to be fine as long as you're not carrying a matchete or something. First thing to learn is, don't show your knife to public. And if you need to use them, ask for permission first. Let people aware that you have a knife, and let them know you use it for what intention. If they disagree, don't push on.  As you mentioned your ethnicity, being a Caucasian (most of people in this sub), is much safer than being any other races. I'm not white and in many situations during hitchhiking or passing by place, I wish I could be white.  You're going to be looking sketchy no matter what. Small towns are especially xenophobic to any stranger, let alone you're being a vagabond/hobo. Often things get less tense after the first interaction, which you show them you have no bad intention, and most important of all, being helpful. However, if you see their first sign of trouble, get your stuff and get the fuck out of there immediately. Past experience I had was I nearly got lynched for being at wrong place and wrong time.  There are a few way to entertain myself. Meditating is the easiest thing to do. A radio with AM/FM/shortwave, basically I listen to anything I manage to receive. I also have a pocket book with a collection of novellas. Small sketchbook, pen and pencil, which I draw. Card game. There is my laptop and a phone, which I use to take picture, as a hobby. I'm going to pick up an ukelele first thing tomorrow morning, which now I have an extra hobby, and a way to make extra money."

It's dangerous and unfair to the dog.  (NEVER HIT ROLLING TRAINS ANYWAY.  IT'S DANGEROUS AS FUCK.) You can't easily ride buses or streetcars with a dog. If you get arrested the dog goes to the dog pound and may be euthanized. Dogs have to be fed and watered, and go to the vet for shots. Dogs have to have dog tags, wear a collar and be kept leashed in town. You have to have proof that the dog was vaccinated for rabies.  I love dogs  But they're a hassle.."

Getting people to smile is the goal. Money is a bonus. Not to mention if I fly with some one, one of us will pick up trash, juggle, play an instrument etc.  Your not going to get rich flying any sign.

vagabond,3cutld,BillyTheBaller1996,-1,Sun Jul 12 02:44:53 2015 UTC,"So the intent of the sign isn't to get money? Hoping money comes from it isn't implied?    Begging is when you go out of your way to make some one feel sorry for you.   Just because you decide to define begging in your own way doesn't change the actual definition of the word. It's interesting that you'd feel offended by me using it though and get defensive. You're begging but try to verbally dance around the issue because you don't want to admit that you're begging, that's funny. Especially when I never said there was anything wrong with it, that all came from you and your defensiveness about how your begging isn't actually begging by skirting the issue with ""oh, I'm just telling people to have a nice day with my cardboard sign while I sit on the street with a container full of change people can put money into"" or whatever.   Why so defensive? I was just curious about your methods and how effective it is and asked a question. And you go on some weird mental gymnastics to pretend that you're not begging when you clearly are, as well as you being the only one here who applied any negative connotation to begging by trying to loophole your way out of the connotation. Self-loathing begger, lol?   If someone juggles or plays an instrument or whatever, sure that's not begging, that's true. But I never signed up to get into a debate about begging, I was just asking a question about the logistics of it, which you refuse to answer. Instead of answering a curious question, as a beggar, you just decided to get offended about the part where it is correctly described as begging.   Another term for this is cognitive dissonance. Another one is being in denial. Another one is just being plain unhelpful and defensive when someone asks you a perfectly normal question on the internet after you posted your beggar sign."

vagabond,3cuond,Anticode,9,Fri Jul 10 22:41:47 2015 UTC,"It is not impossible to ""live off the land,"" but it is a shitload of work, and requires a lot of preparation.  You can't successfully do it most places in the U.S. unless you are right on a coast (for fishing) or a river.  Successfully surviving in the wild means being able to hunt large game, preserve meat and gather wild foods for the winter, building shelter, finding a water supply and so on.  It is a lot easier if you are in a group (like the Native American tribes that used to live this way) and if you have an inexhaustible supply of food (like millions of roaming buffalo.)  Trying to live off hunting and gathering is a full-time, 24-7 endeavor.  And if you screw up (like Christopher McCandless did) you will probably starve to death.  (Of course, McCandless' mistake was not realizing what was going to happen when the spring snow melt began to swell Alaska's rivers, and he got stuck on the wrong side of the Tecknaleeka, about forty miles from a paved highway.) ""Living off the land"" is a lot different than just living out in the wilderness with supplies brought from civilization, but you cannot backpack in enough food and supplies to sustain you for more than a week or two.  To seriously live in the wilderness, you need pack animals to carry in supplies and maybe a horse or two to ride.  You would need a dependable water source, too, and lots of it, because horses or mules drink a lot of water, so we aren't talking about some pothole up on a rock.  We're talking about a lake, river or stream of flowing water.  The reason more people don't live out in the boondocks is because it is a huge undertaking.  When you hear about somebody who lived 30 years in the forest, he (or she) had major supply needs being met somehow--a river for water, a forest with animals to hunt, a garden of vegetables to eat, some sort of supply line back to civilization.  Very, very, very few people can just walk off into the wilderness and survive.  It can be done, but it is definitely not easy.  People have a romanticized idea that they could be pioneers, but they forget how many pioneers died out in the middle of nowhere from things like dysentery.  Remote settlements in odd corners of the earth do not live off the land.  They are being re-supplied from civilization by pack trains and muleskinners.  Most Canadian communities way up north could not exist without bush pilots and airplanes. All that said, if you went out to the wilderness WITH OUTSIDE SUPPORT and slowly increased the amount of food and necessities you obtained from the land, over time you could probably wean yourself off of outside support."
vagabond,3cuond,SunsetRoute1970,2,Sat Jul 11 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"I'll second this. ""Living off the land"" is really tough. I'm can last about two weeks before needing to resupply in town. I'd like to not need to do this, but reality is that the country today isn't the same as the country 200 years ago. Clean water is hard to find. Hunting/foraging aren't the same. Hunting/gathering takes time. I do use road kill, and forage what I can as I go. But that amount isn't anywhere near enough to feed me. It adds to my basics I get from towns like a condiment, or side dish. I do wonder about settling somewhere - but that has its own problems; finding a place remote, with food/water available. Feeding yourself long enough to grown anything. Growing isn't easy as plant seeds and wait. You can't just use any patch of ""wilderness""; Becoming Wild! was a good read. Had some details of picking an area to live in - what it needed to have. Also talked about the compromises they made and why. I have a dream to be ""living off the land"", but know that I'm not going to do it. I'll settle for town resupply - as it lets me move about."
vagabond,3cuond,chisono,9,Tue Jul 14 23:28:22 2015 UTC,"My self description is ""forest bum"".  Along the lines of beach bum but in the wilderness.  I tend to get up a few g's and spend as much time as possible exploring national forests, parks, and wilderness out west.  There's a tremendous amount of territory and it's hard to cover, so I started bicycle touring.  Good gear is a huge advantage.  www.apeoid.com look at some older posts and you'll see some of what I got up to.  Always blowing up keyboards... so I didn't get a chance to write much."
vagabond,3cuond,apestate,2,Sat Jul 11 01:16:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is great stuff. I'd love to do something like that as well. How much, if anything, did you take from the land?"
vagabond,3cuond,apestate,5,Sat Jul 11 01:22:26 2015 UTC,"I brought in all my own food.  At times, maybe 10% of my calories were wild food.  You can do more, but it's not realistic.  The land in the west was never really abundant in easy food, and these days it's a fucking tragedy.  However, hunting and gathering was never my primary focus... I was more interested in reading and learning about the wilderness and in living in comfort, and in generally exploring and coming to terms with the character of a place.  I might spend an hour next to a little group of plants learning about them and reading about them, taking photos, making notes.  Mostly I would hump out a shit ton of dry groceries... nothing canned, nothing wet... but loads of oil, sugar, and coffee.  I believe you could spend as little as $200 a month and be in woods for 3-4 weeks at a time.  However, again realistically, it's more like $400 a month and 2 week escapades... for me.  The high-end gear doesn't last long, used like this.  You might get 150-300 nights out of a high end tent or even lose it before that to mold or vermin damage.  My solar power unit lasted about 3 months before it started to act funny.  etc."
vagabond,3cuond,apestate,3,Sat Jul 11 01:47:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty awesome. Are you living a ""normal"" life when you're not on one of these adventures? This sounds like something I'd use as a vacation from ""work life""."
vagabond,3cuond,cannabisandcaffiene,5,Sat Jul 11 01:50:59 2015 UTC,"yeah that's pretty much it.  right now I'm at a mini-crossroads deciding if I'm going to continue, settle down here, settle down somewhere else, or do something completely different.  of course, if I settle down, I'll be saving my pennies for better equipment."
vagabond,3cuond,presology,4,Sat Jul 11 02:11:59 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about having a big pack out in the wilderness is that you don't look like a transient, you just look like a backpacker. Nobody talks to me in major cities when I carry around my osprey pack. Everyone says hello in the backcountry. And not to mention the National park service is way cooler than any law enforcement agency I've encountered. I've spent the past month in between backcountry hiking in state and national parks, hitchhiking, and stealth camping in a variety of cities. I love being in the woods but the instant I come out into a city I can't help but gorge myself with all the food I couldn't of possibly have packed into the parks. As far as electronics go, I'm not too disappointed when they run out of power, my only concern is if something tragic happens to me and I have no way of contacting anyone."
vagabond,3cuond,chisono,6,Mon Jul 13 03:34:22 2015 UTC,"I know of people who did it in Texas. They subsided off trapping small mammals and opportunistically hunting the larger ones. They also had seasonal rounds for plants like nuts and fruits.   They would sell the furs and other wild crafted items at trade shows, arts fairs and those sorts of things.   all in all it is a difficult life. But that is mostly due to the transitional nature of it. How many people are use to eating raccoons, opossums, armadillos?"
vagabond,3cuond,chisono,2,Fri Jul 10 23:33:01 2015 UTC,"I spend most of my time out of the city/town by choice. Camp side of the road, national parks, forests, paddocks. Limited time in town - to resupply, visit family/friends.  Electronics has evolved over time. When I started I had a simple phone, and could only charge it when in town. Only had reception when near or in town. Now, its a smart phone and I use a solar panel, or dynamo on the bicycle. Still can be in places without reception, but the place I can get online has expanded hugely. I take care to keep electrics clean and dry. And budget their use based on the amount of power I have available.  If it rains - no solar, so phone goes flat fast. Cause, other times, just not interested in being online. Bicycle is great to get further out of town, and to get to more distance places. Can cover ground faster than walking, and carry more. But has disadvantages also: harder to get a lift, need some spares. If you know there is water where you're going, max out on carrying food, and use the water there. But if the area is dry, you need to carry water. And sometimes a lot of water. I've carried over 7 gallons at times. Its heavy, but when going places solo and remote you can't depend on someone saving your arse if you you don't prepare. I'm ""gentle"" with my gear to make it last as long as possible. But everything breaks eventually. Have a plan and prepare for when critical items die.  I started as just on a 'between jobs' break, but over time, changed to 'I'm not going back'. I love my lifestyle now. Wouldn't part with it at all.  Once on the path, you change in ways you cannot imagine.  lol. for someone who showering twice daily, shampoo/condition hair, dressing well, make up, fine dining  lol how I've changed!  Accept discomfort: Its not always fine, sunny, beautiful days. It will be hot and  humid, or cold, windy and raining. Not washing for a week, or two (or more) might be uncomfortable, but you'll get over it. Get over being fussy. The food/ water is not going to taste good all the time.  Purify your water, cook the ""food""; being sick from bad food/water isn't fun.  Tip: hold your nose while drinking foul smelling water.  Tip: curry on anything makes it more palatable.  The crappy times, make the good times all the better. What ever happens - good or bad - it will pass, so don't get too attached to it :)"
vagabond,3cuond,railroadjake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:05:34 2015 UTC,Excellent! Thank you for sharing your experiences. I'm sure you have some interesting stories to tell. What sort of ecosystem are you usually staying in?
vagabond,3cuond,meyouanddoom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:08:30 2015 UTC,"It varies from grassy plains to bushland, desert to rain forest. Each ecosystem has its pros and cons, and these also change depending on the season. I've my set of clothes that I can thin down for heat, and layer up for cold. But there are limits. So, I avoid the extremes; it's easier to manage the middle ground. In hot weather that cool moist, shady forest is wonderful, but when the temps drop - it's not so nice. The insects life changes ; people worry about the larger animals, but insects can make life hell - mosquitoes, sand flies, ticks, leeches, ants, wasps, etc   Unless you're really picking where you go, it will always keep changing.  You will work out how manage with what you have. And you will get better at it with time."

vagabond,3cu44z,SunsetRoute1970,3,Fri Jul 10 20:06:06 2015 UTC,I've met a few experienced trainhoppers with radios who use them to monitor traffic at railyards. I couldn't decipher what the hell the railroad staff was saying but I guess like most things that comes with experience.
vagabond,3cu44z,thatjournalist,3,Fri Jul 10 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"This is true.  It takes a little while to learn the lingo.  Railroaders use slang, just like everybody else.  I've heard of people using hand-held ham radios to monitor railroad radio transmissions, too, but one cannot talk on those frequencies legally.  It's legal to listen in, but not to talk.  If you talk, and they realize you are on the train, they will call the cops and stop the train so you can be arrested."
vagabond,3cu44z,AreYouGoingToEatThat,4,Fri Jul 10 21:27:57 2015 UTC,"Trucker here. The CB is not as widely used as it was in decades gone by; however, it is still in use. We monitor channel 19.  I'll level with you. Almost all of us have a strict ""no riders"" policy. A company driver isn't going to risk his job. The driver can also get in trouble with the law if the passenger isn't documented and insured.  So if a driver does give you a ride, that should be a red flag."
vagabond,3cu44z,notacrackheadofficer,3,Sat Jul 11 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"I've caught many a ride with truckers, but I've never used a CB to do so.  I was just wondering if it was possible or practical.  Back when I did a lot more hitchhiking, I think the rules about riders were more lax.  The guys I rode with didn't seem to be too worried about getting into trouble for giving me a ride and mostly were just looking for somebody to talk to."

vagabond,3cu16d,meyouanddoom,2,Fri Jul 10 22:36:11 2015 UTC,West coast hitching is fun and do-able with a buddy. I can usually stick it and get there in less than a week. But cross country you better go rails. You hitch faster alone so it would take ages. I've done it half with a dude I met and half alone and after he stopped in KC I got to NY quick.

And I make my living taking candid photos so I am well aware of having to be fast in a moment and I still find the time to be concious of framing even while having people swing at me so my advice stands, better framing.

vagabond,3ctdd3,stabiloboss12,3,Fri Jul 10 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"It depends how long you intend to stay in each place.  Back in 1971 I hitched non-stop with a friend from Los Angeles, CA to Chicago, IL in two and a half days, but we were very lucky in that we hardly ever had to wait more than an hour for another ride.  We slept in shifts, in the cars, with one of us up talking to the driver.  Several of our rides were with long-haul truckers who passed us from truck-to-truck at truck stops using CB radio to locate another trucker willing to take us.  One ride was with a guy and his girlfriend who were pretty intoxicated and who drove us to St. Louis on a lark.  They sobered up half way, and were kind of like ""Why are we doing this again?""  Given a month and a half, it's definitely do-able, but I question the wisdom of heading across the western deserts in JULY.  Take LOTS OF WATER.  Consider taking something like a plastic five-gallon military water can.  Looks like a gasoline ""jerry can.""  Obviously, you cannot use an ACTUAL gasoline can (especially a used one.)  Try not to get dropped off anywhere except at places like restaurants, fueling stations, etc.  It might take days to catch a ride from some unoccupied freeway exit in Bumfuck, Arizona.  You're much better off in a truck stop--bathrooms, water, food, etc."

Or do you want to just cross the country on the lowest budget possible? You're gonna be so rushed that you won't have time to take any detours, and you'll probably miss out on the best part of a long hitchhiking trip - the chance encounters that go in directions you had never expected. That can still happen, but you need to be flexible, and if you're in such a hurry, that's hard."
vagabond,3ctdd3,SunsetRoute1970,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"yeah you may be right, rushing it doesn't sound great how long would you think to give this kind of trip?"
vagabond,3ctdd3,QuainPercussion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"""How long it would take you?"" is a lot different from ""How long should I take?""  If you have a must-arrive-by date in mind, then calculate the number of days you have available and divide into the miles.  But truthfully, a lot of areas you will be travelling through are not very attractive.  I happen to enjoy the desert, but not necessarily the part you will be travelling through.  Ditto the miles and miles of corn, or wheat, or cotton fields.  So while you could spend several days in someplace like Bakersfield, I definitely don't recommend it. Another good idea is to hitch along established Greyhound routes.  If you get stuck, you could always ride the Dog until you get someplace better.  Same thing with bad weather, etc.  I prefer travelling off the beaten path, but this is kind of how people wind up with a story about spending eleven torturous days going from  Minneapolis to Butte. I hate travelling with a deadline.  I prefer just meandering around at my own pace.  I might meet someone in a small town and hang out for a few days, then catch out to a more urban area.  Travelling on a deadline means that ""I have to arrive on time!"" dominates everything you do.  I prefer travelling on ""Hobo Time.""  I get there whenever I get there."

People were nice but every time someone claimed they could get us some bud they never came back. And it took us 3 or 4 days to hitch out. That's why we dubbed it Terra Hate. Keep your eyes peeled around there. When I was there, there was like 4 other tramps trying to get out. You shouldn't have any trouble finding a road dog. Although you may have trouble finding one that isn't a raging alcoholic. Good luck on your search"

vagabond,3ckk2d,vvvvvvvvvv85,24,Wed Jul 8 17:07:11 2015 UTC,"If anyone is interested I'll explain more. When someone spends the last 10 days in the mosque it is known as i'tikaf. They are worshiping their god from sunrise to sunset and beyond. The 'dinner ' provider is for followers who are breaking the fast that they have held since sunrise. They will welcome you in and offer you food and information on the religion but I advise caution, if you are simply leeching then they won't be happy about it. Of course if you're in need they'll undoubtedly care for you. If you do go then do so with an open mind and remember that we are all humans.  Sorry if this was a little too long."
vagabond,3ckk2d,zenwisp,14,Wed Jul 8 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"Nah you're on point. It's the same thing whenever you grab a meal with the buddhists or hare krishnas, you may not agree with everything they're saying but you're in their place of worship eating their food, so the least you can do is listen with an open mind."
vagabond,3ckk2d,Subalpine,8,Wed Jul 8 22:03:19 2015 UTC,"It's not entirely true. The mosque where I live serves food every single night of Ramadan and from the beginning, there's a homeless dude who wanders around the street and had started eating there. No one bothered him and some gave him money. He would take the food and leave. But, he's been asking questions on his own terms and interested in Islam as far as I know. But, of course not every mosque is the same and not all Muslims are the same."
vagabond,3ckk2d,Redlaron,2,Thu Jul 9 05:13:10 2015 UTC,I think Muslims are prohibited from converting people. I think it has to be a choice of the individual.

vagabond,3ckk2d,huckstah,9,Thu Jul 9 00:04:53 2015 UTC,"I did this back in San Francisco in 2004.  I went to a mosque that was in the middle of a pretty rough ghetto known infamously as the ""tenderloin district""...tons of crack dealers and heroin addicts, awesome place for a young hobo to get stabbed and robbed.   Anyway, this was during the peak of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.  All the anti-muslim sentiment going around the nation had an opposite effect on me: it made me sympathetic to the muslim culture,  and it made me wish to understand the religion and culture even more.   I saw a mosque one day and decided to walk in.  The imam (church leader)  greeted me and introduced me to his English translator. The translator gave me a tour of the mosque, a breakdown of their ritual services,  and informed me that there would be free food for me available in the evening since it was Ramadan.   I stayed for the food, and came back the next day to be a bystander at their afternoon prayer service. I washed all of my various body parts and was given an herbal oil to rub into my beard. I gathered with the men as we knelt on our knees in front of the imam.  I looked behind me and was sort of surprised to see that all the women were segregated to the back of the church behind a vaguely transparent curtain.  I had no idea what the imam said since it was all foreign language.   Upon leaving,  I was approached on the sidewalk by a white person that was dressed way too nicely to be hanging out in the ghetto.  They asked me if I was praying at the mosque, and asked how long I had been visiting there and if I planned to continue visiting.  The questions were rather odd,  but I didn't think much of it at the time since a hobo gets strange and random questions from normies all the time.   Later that week I found out that the mosque I visited was the same mosque that recruited John Walker Lindh,  the infamous American runaway that joined the Taliban and fought against the American invasion. The mosque was under heavy surveillance by the CIA/NSA/FBI for being a sponsor of Al-Quaeda.   Anyway,  mosques are cool...except for that mosque, I guess...but yeah,  I would visit another mosque again 10/10.  Also the food is excellent and healthier than most American crap.  They were also much nicer and sympathetic to me than most Christians."
vagabond,3ckk2d,jsesdock,2,Thu Jul 9 05:14:57 2015 UTC,tbh i think John Walker Lindh had his own kind of poison in his head separate & distinct from whatever he learned in that mosque.

vagabond,3ckk2d,harveypekar84,3,Thu Jul 9 07:51:16 2015 UTC,"Great info!  As an aside, when traveling in predominantly Muslim countries, you can often ask if you can sleep in the mosque for the night. This worked pretty often for me. Just take care to respect the place."

vagabond,3closg,railroadjake,5,Wed Jul 8 21:48:37 2015 UTC,"I carry a rod and reel with me everywhere that I go,  and I've been caught fishing without a license several times.   If you get caught, one of two things are 99% likely to happen:   1) They will realize you are a backpacker simply fishing for an honest meal, and allow you to continue as long as you are fishing responsibly.   2) They will give you a verbal warning and tell you to stop fishing until you acquire the appropriate license.   In my personal experience, they always treat me with respect as long as I treat them the same.  They usually hang out with me for 10-15 mins asking stories about my adventures, often curious about all of survival gear and camping techniques. I've never once been given a ticket, but I have been asked to put away my pole a couple of times.  On that note, I've even had a game warden  tell me ""sorry but I have to ask you to stop fishing...however I leave the park at 6pm and can't control what you do after that,  hint hint""   TL;DR: Don't worry about a license. Fish responsibly,  and treat others respectfully,  and you'll be fine.  I've been a hobo fisherman for 11 years."
vagabond,3closg,huckstah,4,Thu Jul 9 04:43:30 2015 UTC,"For Washington residents they're around $30.00 but for non-residents like me, Washington is $84, Oregon $106, and California about the same, that's not including the small fee for the wildlife card (which you need in order to purchase any kind of license). My intention is to just catch here and there in the evening, certainly nothing that would negatively affect the environment.  I think I'll just risk it and hope not to be spotted anywhere."
vagabond,3closg,Papabig91,3,Wed Jul 8 23:22:23 2015 UTC,"Washingtonian here with lots of connections and experience with the law enforcement side of the forest and park services.   Unfortunately Washingtons out of state resident prices for a fishing license is kinda pricy :( if you are on a tight budget I wouldn't really consider getting one.   When it comes to the fish and game wardens and rangers you are mostly right. They have zero tolerance for poaching of game as well as illegal commercial fishing. However most of them are pretty awesome folk and if they come up on you for the first time and you are kind and respectful they will either give a slap on the wrist or make you throw it back. Just whatever you do don't let them catch you in the same spot again doing the same thing they just told you not to do, if you get caught behave and move on somewhere else. Testing their patience is not recommended. Honestly though Washington is awesome, if you stick to Whatcom, Skagit and even most of Snohomish County you will be fine as long as you don't lip off or act stupid.  Best of luck and feel free to ask me any questions about NW Washington, I'll try my best to help out!"

vagabond,3closg,yngradthegiant,4,Thu Jul 9 04:06:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about washington, but whenever I've had a fishing license it's always been $20-$30. A hundred bucks sounds more like a hunting license maybe?  Anyway, in my experience, game wardens and park rangers are fairly chill people. They're mostly concerned with people overfishing or fishing commercially etc, out of concern for the local ecosystem. If they find out you're fishing without a license for one or two fish for sustenance they're likely to turn a blind eye, so long as you're not making a mess and respecting the area.  I'm not a lawyer, don't quote me on it, but I think the penalties are pretty low. A fine of under a hundred dollars I'd think. If you don't pay the fine, yes, you can get an arrest warrant, which will probably suck if you're ever pulled over in that state again, or trying to cross a border into that state again, but I would think it's a state-wide thing. Not sure what would happen if you're caught in a national park though."
vagabond,3closg,meyouanddoom,3,Wed Jul 8 22:06:18 2015 UTC,"Do not screw with game wardens though, their job can get pretty dangerous.

Hammocks need trees or upright supports. Tents need flat ground.  Hammocks are bad on the back no matter what. Tents require ground mats or they're both bad on the back and suck the heat out of you.  The downfalls of hammocks can't really be overcome unless you're young and have a flexible back, and you plan on being nowhere except places that have uneven ground and lots of trees.  The downfalls of tents are they're either really big and bulky and heavy, or they're really expensive.  The compromise is a bivvy sack. Basically a condom for your sleeping bag. This has the benefit of being tiny and compact, cheap, lightweight, and works on all terrain. However, like a tent, you'll need a ground mat.

Basically it can fit two people but more comfortable with just one. It has a door and air netting on most of the top edges. As a tent theres a hammock in the middle that I can tie up or sleep on and it doesn't require poles or anything cause you just string it up to a couple trees and stake the corners to the ground. As a hammock same concept except you hang from a different set of strings. no trees? it gets to be an inflated tent for the night. Light weight, rolls down to almost nothing - the rain fly is the bulkiest part so I'm thinking of cutting it to just the right size  Only thing is I wanna get something tougher for the bottom so it doesn't wear out too fast. Tyvek housing paper is pretty strong and it's waterproof, think I shall try some of that sometime"
vagabond,3che5y,lifer-throw,14,Tue Jul 7 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"Some advice from my travels:   Get a cheap cell-phone battery charger, saw one yesterday that will give you a full charge for less than 20$, they are quite small. You need good shoes & extra socks (wool are best), probably the most important thing since you will be on your feet a lot. Consider getting a bike, depending on where you are a 5 min bike ride VS an hour walk could make your day. Even if you don't smoke, carry cigs and a lighter. Easy to start fires when needed and trade with people. Always, always have some trail mix, or dried fruit in the depths of your pack. In an emergency it could save your life, never travel with 0 food. Are you light-skinned? Sunscreen and a hat are a must, sunburn or heatstroke fucking sucks. Shave your head or cut your hair short. Much easier to keep clean when you can wash your hair in 5 seconds in a bathroom sink with handsoap. Same for your pubes, much easier to keep clean without hair trapping road dirt to your nuts. Sunglasses are a must if you're going to be out walking a lot, glare will strain your eyes and make you prematurely tired. Toothpaste is not needed, but a toothbrush and floss are a must. Floss can also be used to sew and holds together better than regular thread, it is strong as fuck. Small led flashlight, if the batteries on that run out you can use your phone in a pinch, get a flashlight app. A non-lubricated condom can save your ass as it can be used as a waterproof storage bag and takes up no space. Keep an extra lighter or matches in there if you know you could get wet. Also great for pregnancy free sex. Carry a small paperback book, boredom can be hellish on the road. If you're going into town and it's been more than a day or two since your last shower WEAR DEODORANT. Living outside and moving around all day makes you smell like a moose really fast and people will be much nicer to a clean-ish smelling hobo than one that you can smell from 300 feet away. Staying as clean as you can will make people much more likely to lend a hand. Always carry a couple asprin and benadryl. Asprin if you get a fever can save your life, and benadryl staves off allergic reactions of all kinds not just nose-runny allergies. You never know what plant you will brush up against and find out you're allergic to. If you're gonna be carrying cash consider converting 50-100 bucks to a Visa Gift card. Sometimes using cash won't be an option and I'm gonna assume a recent heroin user doesn't have a credit card/bank account. In that same vein, get a cell phone if you don't have one right now. I doesn't need to have a plan attached to it, Wifi is your friend and GPS on cell phones works with no contract. Use wifi to set your destination and once you get out of range your gps will keep working, most people don't know this. Some people carry a knife for protection, I would not have just a knife. Carry a multi-tool instead. Takes up the same amount of space and is much more useful. It is also much easier to explain to police why you have a multi-tool rather than why you have a knife. Army Surplus is your friend. Military issue cargo khakis are the only pants you need. They never wear out (I had a pair I beat to shit for almost 10 years working a warehouse job and they never ever tore, they are magic) and not too hot in the summer and offer great protection from the wind in cold weather. Superglue can be used to close cuts that would normally require stitches, it is safe. Medics in Vietnam had this in their kit."

I'd also add to get out in nature, and do some work to help prevent relapse. Addiction can creep up on you, and it's really important to develop an understanding of the underlying reasons you turn to hard drugs in the first place, so that you can get out of that trap if you ever trip in."

My demons are a bit different,  but when I was preparing for discharge, my team and I made a relapse-prevention plan.  Not all the ideas proved useful, but even the act of trying can be helpful. Delaying tactics, reasons I sought out recovery in the first place, things like that. Hot line numbers are good to have too, though I personally have avoided using them (no good reason to avoid it, that's a problem I'm still picking apart)."

vagabond,3che5y,hunter10howard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:44:21 2015 UTC,"It's got a crazy big transient/vagabond community and is quickly rebounding as a city (it's also New York's second biggest city). There's concerts every night, monumental abandoned industrial architecture and a deep rooted DIY ethic. I like to think of the Big Dirty as being the most punk city in the US. Because the region was stuck in forty years of economic depression, everything is dirt cheap now. You can get a super nice apartment in a old historic home for dirt cheap, plus there are several different punk/squat houses scattered through out the city. Buffalo has this weird cult community surrounding it, people either absolutely hate it or love it. It's been called the New Wild West by a lot of people because it's transient lawlessness anything can happen reputation.  Check out these articles:  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/upshot/where-young-college-graduates-are-choosing-to-live.html  http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06Squatters-t.html?_r=0  Another good place to go camping for the summer would be up in the Adirondacks. It's easy to find out jobs work at summer camps or logging and it's one of the most dense wilderness areas in the US."
vagabond,3che5y,banlieueouest,2,Wed Jul 8 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"I wish I had found any of that in Buffalo. Everywhere else I went, people were pretty nice. Buffalo was the only place I had problems. I had to stop in a neighborhood to check my map for directions to one of the state parks. I was freshly showered, I don't look like a bum, and I'm a tiny young woman. A guy in a BMW came into the neighborhood, and when he saw me, he gunned it towards me. He stopped just inches from my legs and started screaming obscenities at me: ""c, get out of my neighborhood, stupid b*"", and so on... No idea what I was doing wrong.  I found some local vagabonds to ask if they knew any good sleeping spots. They also called me a c*** and threatened to rape me. I was scared shitless to sleep anywhere in that city. I stayed awake all night with my knife hidden in my sleeve.   As I was leaving, I had hitched a ride out, and people were screaming at the driver for not accelerating fast enough at lights, and people just being generally agro and scary towards each other.   They are quite fond of the word c*** there. Maybe they are nicer if you're a dude. Don't think I'll be back.   But Letchworth was nice. Would recommend."
vagabond,3che5y,Hashisme,2,Wed Jul 8 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it was Buffalo? It doesn't really sound like the people here and we also just got a state park in the city this summer, otherwise the nearest one would be.  Niagara Falls state park. Letchworth is nearly on the other side of the state from Buffalo. It just seems especially unusual because the city is roaming with young college aged people, Buffalo gas problems but public harassment isn't one of them."
vagabond,3cg06j,xjr562i,14,Tue Jul 7 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"One time about 10 years ago I was hitching out of Calgary, Alberta with this digeridoo player I met. We tried to be prepared in case we got stuck in Saskatchewan or somewhere, so we panned/busked up about a hundred bucks, bought food, smokes, lighters, a sharpie, picked up cardboard for signs, tried to think of everything we might need. We took transit to the edge of town and started walking towards the highway when it hit me. We forgot to buy weed. We were bummed out, but not enough to go back into town so we kept walking. Not even ten seconds later I saw a piece of trash in a ditch on the side of the highway that called to me. It was a red pouch of American Spirit tobacco some 20-30 yards away, and for some reason I decided to walk over and pick it up. Sure enough, it contained about an eighth of really dry and crumbly weed that must have been out in the sun for days, but it was exactly what we needed at the time."

The entire province is completely flat and featureless with nothing except wheat for hundreds of miles. Half the world is yellow, the other half blue. Towns are sparse and often have populations in the double digits. It's very likely if you get dropped off in the middle of nowhere you'll only see a couple cars per day. It's incredibly, mind numbingly boring to be stuck in Saskatchewan, so yeah. Marijuana was essential in case we got stuck.

It had some shrunken, shitty handwriting on the side (had obviously been written while inflated, looked like ballpoint).  Writing said ""Please, I love you"".  No idea what the story was, but it just struck me as one of saddest things I'd ever seen."
vagabond,3cg06j,Javacalypse_Now,2,Wed Jul 8 04:43:10 2015 UTC,"This is what really happened:  Jane's eyes welled as she read the words on the balloon. ""Please"" and ""I love you"" it said, scrawled by a pen in his particular, childlike handwriting. She remembered all the times shed heard Chris speak those words, and the tears slowly began rolling down her flushed cheeks.   He'd spoken them as words of comfort when her father was diagnosed, his warm arm wrapped around her, keeping her safe.      Later, those words had returned life to their home. He'd sparked warmth back into that dark building, and into her heart on that cold winter day. It was Chris and those words which had put the grief of their daughter's passing to rest.   She looked up from the balloon and into his sorrowful, regret filled face. His silvering hair was now framed by the sparkling trees, and she remembered the first time they'd made love. They were still young then, and silly with passion. It had been alongside this same creek, in a clearing further upstream, out of reach of their families prying eyes.   Jane frowned for a moment, remembering the day he'd cheated on her- with that young, blonde, floozy of an assistant. But again, her anger faded as she recalled his words that day too, how his voice had cracked with emotion while tears flooded and stained his shirt.   Jane looked at Chris now, as he kneeled before her like a broken doll. She looked, she remembered, and she forgave.  Reaching out, she helped him rise to his feet and put her arms around him. ""Oh Chris... I could never stop loving you... No matter how foolish you can be. You're a clown, but I forgive you."" Chris smiled again, the first time in weeks, and honked his big red nose. He reached into a pocket and pulled out a fresh, new balloon. Jane watched in delight as her blew up the long thin balloon. In seconds his skilled hands, still nimble despite the arthritis, had twisted the balloon and he presented her with an inflated heart. She was crying tears of delight now, and together, the bearded lady and the Chrisco the Magnificent walked off into the fresh autumn sun, leaving the balloon of desperation behind them like his transgression. They walked back to their home, and made love in that special, slow and squishy way that old people do. They lived happily ever after, and that sad, hopeful balloon just sat by that stream, slowly deflating."

Still got it, and it works great.  Flares for it are a little pricey, though.  Pistols like this were used on B-17 Flying Fortresses to signal ground support whether or not they had casualties on board, when they were landing back at their base.  There was a ""flare port"" on the side of the plane, and the crew would insert the flare gun into the port and launch a particular colored flare to signal what kind of support they needed--ambulance, fire fighting crew, explosive ordnance disposal, etc.  It's worth at least $100 or more.

For me the reason is that i work 40 hours a week at a supermarket as I have no qualifications etc and cant get anything better. And for what? of my approximtely £1100 a month, £680 goes to rent, about £50 on eleccy and gas and water, and about £200 on food and running my car (to get to work) and internet,phone etc. I basically have no free time to do what i want and all my money goes solely on surviving. I work endlessly a job i fucking despise and yet at the end of the month cant buy myself anything that i want.  All for a roof over my head? well fuck a tent technically has a roof too!! And I cant lie I have always been a bit lazy when it comes to work, school etc ( hence my position ) but i dont think there is anything wrong with that its just the way I am. Some people are goal driven, some people arent.   Just want to not get to the age of 50 and the only thing i have ever done in life is go to and from work, get pissed at weatherspoons on £3.50 pints of Carlsburg, and sit at home in front of the tv.   And since i never really have money to buy material things, I have lost interest in them and have no real wants. I JUST WANT TO SPEND MY TIME DOING WHAT I WANT NOT SHIFTING AROUNG CRATES OF APPLES ALL DAY AND MAKING SURE THE FUCKING SHELVES ARE NEAT AND TIDY. FUCK OFFFFFFFF. but for now its just a dream. Dad is proud of me for working and standing on my own two feet and ive been at it a year. Im going to stick with it for maybe another year see if i cant get a better job, but if not then yea fuck it i shall first go up to scotland, then maybe get a £30 megabus over to Netherlands then fuck around europe for a bit.

vagabond,3caxsx,cyberphonic,5,Mon Jul 6 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"I wear glasses full time and travel on foot; hitchhiking, hopping trains and whatnot. I don't wear contacts but I would imagine that wouldnt work to well because my hands are almost never clean to put them in and most people have to take them out to sleep, which I would forget to do.  I don't have any problems keeping up with my glasses and your vision seems worse than mine so I have a feeling you wont have a problem loosing them. Bring a backup and you should be fine. I definitely wouldn't spend a bunch of money on surgery that you wouldn't do normally to go on the road."
vagabond,3caxsx,Nathaliealoise,4,Mon Jul 6 15:12:13 2015 UTC,"I set out with 3 months worth of contacts. I went through the majority of them within the first month but I've kept the last two pairs well maintained. I know I'll be without clear vision soon but I'm confident something will come up and I'll be able to see again. No, it's not responsible but I have to deal with the cards I've been given."
vagabond,3caxsx,Clockysauce,4,Mon Jul 6 21:30:14 2015 UTC,"I need prescription eyewear too.  I have one set of glasses, and use 2 week disposable contact lenses. Keeping the contacts clean is paramount, but it's not that hard.  Before touching the lenses/case/bottle:   If there's a lot of dirt and grime, rinse that off well with water. Use some non-scented and no lotion hand santizer. Rub it really well. Rinse your hands off with water. Dry your hands with a small cloth used just for this purpose. Manage the contacts in your eye hole. Rinse the case and store the case and small cloth someplace where it won't get grime. Store your glasses by wrapping them in this towel Wash the small towel every time you do laundry"
vagabond,3caxsx,anywhereness,3,Mon Jul 6 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"Like /u/heartbeats said, use a glasses cord, of some kind. Contacts are a bad idea if you don't have clean hands. Also, make sure you have a sturdy eyeglass case for when you sleep to keep them from getting dinged up or scratched."
vagabond,3caxsx,flyawaylittlebirdie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"I never take them off unless I'm washing my face. I've got a 10 year old pair of plastic spring-hinged frames. I've got another pair in a storage unit across town. Not exactly great, but, there is always risk. If you want to get paranoid, get a hard case with a spare pair and keep it in your pack, It is unlikely that you will get your worn pair smashed AND your secondary pair stolen at the same time."
vagabond,3caxsx,boxmole,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:36:05 2015 UTC,"How old are you?   Laser eye surgery is really best for young people.  I had it done at age 58, and it was only partially successful.  Yes, my vision is better, but past age forty the problem is accommodation (the ability to switch focus from near to far and back again.)  So despite having had laser eye surgery, I still have to wear glasses.  That said, I have hitched and hopped trains all over North America and never lost my glasses.  I had a screw come out once, and I broke out my handy roll of white fabric bandage tape and taped them up until I could get to a drug store and buy a handy-dandy eyeglasses repair kit. On the road, you ALWAYS WEAR AN EYEGLASSES KEEPER STRAP.  My eyes were bad enough that if I lost my glasses, I probably could not have read a standard road map or a compass.  With laser surgery, they're better, but far from perfect.  Take an extra pair and always, always wear an eyeglasses keeper strap, especially if you hop trains."

vagabond,3c8xfy,ShearJoy,12,Mon Jul 6 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"Leaving without explaining what you are doing may set off a police search for you.  Your parents may not agree with you, but if you are over 18, you are an adult and you have the right to make your own decisions.  If you are UNDER 18, this is not true, and your parents can have you picked up and returned home.  Minors do NOT have the right to leave home or live without their family's supervision in any state in the U.S.    If you leave without establishing with them that you are of legal age now and can live your own life, you are asking for trouble.  Don't tell them you are leaving ""forever.""  You may need to return, and if you do, you don't want it to be any more embarrassing than it needs to be.  Tell them you are going on a ""camping vacation"" to see the National Parks or some definable goal like that.  If need be, start out on a Greyhound bus, waving goodbye to Mom and Dad.  At the next town, get off, cash in your ticket if you can, and do whatever you please.  It's good idea to send them a postcard from somewhere just as you leave, telling them you just got there and how wonderful Yosemite is, etc.  That way, they think you are at Yosemite, but you are actually en route to Portland or whatever.  Regular postcards, short letters or cell phone calls will keep them off your back.  If they are worried about you and freaking out, you can expect undesired attention from the police.  Travelling with a friend that they know is even better--just you and your BFF, off to see the Grand Canyon like two tourists.  My girlfriend and I took off in 1971 under bad circumstances--her family was furious at her (and me too.)  We were both in the I.W.W. and we mailed sealed letters home through the I.W.W. branch in New York City, and the New York Wobblies re-mailed them back to Texas.  Eventually, my girlfriend screwed up and called home from a pay phone (cell phones had not yet been invented) and had an argument with her mother.  She was so mad, she forgot to pay the long distance charges, and her mother was contacted by the phone company and asked to pay them.  Her mother readily agreed, if the operator would tell her the physical address of the pay phone.  Diana had used a pay phone a block from where we were staying in an anarchist commune in Highland Park in L.A..  In less than 24 hours ""somebody"" (we couldn't figure out exactly who) had the phone booth staked out (they had ""private detective"" written all over them), waiting for Diana to return.  We caught a northbound freight that night."
vagabond,3c8xfy,SunsetRoute1970,9,Mon Jul 6 05:21:35 2015 UTC,"Um, I'm sorry, but you can't just cut off the story in the middle like that.  How did you figure out that the payphone was staked out, and why were you so sure it was for you (or your girlfriend)? How did you find out the part about Diana's mom and the phone company? Where did you take the train to? Did you or her ever return home?"
vagabond,3c8xfy,the_broccoli,7,Mon Jul 6 09:30:23 2015 UTC,"We lived on a hill, in a two-story house that was owned by a group of California anarchists.  They had bought the house with money they got from a complicated lawsuit involving computer services (it was like in 1969 or 1970) and the Bank of America.  I was an anarchist and an organizer for the I.W.W.  My girlfriend was a working-class white girl from North Houston who was separated from a Klansmen-type husband.  We decided to leave and go stay with my anarchist friends in Los Angeles, in Highland Park. The commune had a phone, but we didn't want to leave a paper trail back to Texas, so whenever Diana called home, she paid on our end at a pay phone.  The day she screwed up, she got mad (she kind of had a temper--red-haired cowgirl from Texas) slammed down the receiver and walked away, forgetting to pay the extra long-distance fees.  The phone company called her mom, mom paid the fee in return for the address of the phone.  So now they knew what part of L.A. we were in. Once they knew we were in L.A., we think they hired a private detective to find Diana.   We always used that same phone, and they knew it.  People from the commune walked up and down that hill, right past the pay phone several times a day.  Somebody noticed ""two narky-looking guys in sunglasses"" parked in a car, apparently watching the phone.  Several of us went down there to check them out.  They didn't look like cops, exactly, but they were definitely staking out the pay phone.  We talked about it.  It wasn't safe for us to remain in the commune, because it was just a matter of time before somebody figured out where we were, either these two narks or maybe Klan or Nazis from L.A.  So, the commune gave us some money, and a ride to the train yard, and we caught out north towards Oregon.  I have no idea how long they watched the pay phone, we left and never went back.  From there we went to Oregon, then Washington, then into Canada on Vancouver Island, and eventually travelled east across Canada back to I.W.W. headquarters in Chicago (back then), and then back down to Texas about a year later.  When we got back to Texas, she reconciled with her parents and we found out that we were correct about her mother getting the address of the pay phone, but her mom never did admit to whether or not the two guys were detectives or L.A. Nazis or what.  Just like we anarchists had friends all over the country, the Klan and the Nazis did too.  It would have been easy for Diana's husband to call up some branch of the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP) and ask them to go check out the address of the pay phone.  You've got to understand that the 1960s-1970s was kind of like a war.  Both sides were dead serious.  KPFT Radio (hippie, liberal, listener-sponsored public radio) in Houston was bombed off the air TWICE by the Klan.  The restaurant where I worked, Family Hand Restaurant, was bombed once (at night, while we were closed) and we got about a million telephone bomb threats.  The offices of Space City! News (underground newspaper) was attacked frequently by drive-bys and once with a grenade attack.  Several small hippie stores that carried Space City! were bombed, one only two blocks from my house.  One time a couple of male staff members of Space City! jumped a notorious Klansman at a anti-war rally and held him while they took his picture.  They put it in the paper----two Texas hippies holding the notorious racist militant Louis Beam in a head lock.  Boy, the Klan was pissed.   We were travelling partially to avoid being in one spot all the time.  Staying in one spot makes you too easy to target."

However, whether you're leaving to satisfy your wanderlust and to explore the world, or you're leaving to escape an unhealthy relationship or difficult circumstances, I would try to leave on a good note. Be positive in the letter, be open, but don't be hostile or defensive.   If it is indeed something you feel the need to do, say so. Hopefully your family and friends will be encouraging.  Also, don't say that your intention is to never come back again. You never know how you might feel after a few months or years of travel.  I've never left forever before but I think that leaving with a big fuck you could only come back and bite you later.

This is part decoy (if you're robbed, give this up while complaining bitterly) and part convenience for if you need access to more money than you planned for the day. 3.

vagabond,3c1h95,lambda_llama,3,Sat Jul 4 01:31:40 2015 UTC,"Obviously, you never want to reveal the fact that you are carrying a lot of cash.  The money belt thing is a good idea, but serious crooks may force you to take off your belt, too.  It would stop pickpockets and gear thieves though.  Carrying a couple of ""decoy"" money stashes is a pretty good idea.  I like the idea of a neck pouch and a wallet with your daily expenses in it, combined with a money belt.  Seriously, though, to rob me the crook is going to need a firearm.  I will (and have) fought people armed with knives, and managed to escape intact.  When catching trains, I have used a homemade ""valuables pouch"" made of a piece of thin, dark blue cloth that combines a ""belt loop section"" and a ""pocket"" section.  To use it, you thread your belt through the first couple of belt loops on your blue jeans, then through the belt loop section of the valuables pouch, and then through the rest of your belt loops.  The pocket hangs outside your pants,  facing outboard, so you can access it easily.  Put your passport, traveler's checks, cash money, Visa card, etc. in the pouch, then FLIP IT BACKWARDS inside your pants and re-fasten your belt.  Now the pouch is INSIDE YOUR TROUSERS and nothing shows except a strip of blue cloth covering your belt between two belt loops.  Wear your shirttail outside your pants, and nobody can even see that.  To access the pouch's contents when it is flipped inside your trousers, though, you are going to need some privacy."
vagabond,3c1h95,SunsetRoute1970,2,Sat Jul 4 06:32:41 2015 UTC,"first thing that comes to mind is leaving the money (cash) with someone you trust* who is stationary. When you're going to be needing some money alert them somehow, so that they can get a money order from the bank and send it to your local post office for pickup. You can cash it at a number of stores. (for some sort of fee) That way your name wouldn't be on some bank statement somewhere and this person would just give the bank the cash on the spot for the piece of paper anyway. Never done a money order but I think that's how they work..?"

vagabond,3bxgu1,SunsetRoute1970,7,Sun Jul 5 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"Here's my ""coffin story."" In 1968, back in the hippie days when there were thousands of long-haired, anti-war, pot-smoking young people swarming all over the country, I was 17 and in California on a VW camper surfing trip with several of my buddies.  We had a major disagreement over a plan to go to Mexico, score a kilo of weed and then smuggle it back into California inside the insulation cavity of the icebox in the camper.  It seemed incredibly risky to me, and I refused to go.  All my buddies gave me shit and called me a gutless pussy, etc.  (This was my first big life lesson in ""Never allow your friends to peer pressure you into something stupid."")  Predictably, the Immigration people searched the van, and did not find the weed, but they ripped the van to shreds. Instead of going on this ill-advised weed mission, I volunteered to accompany the 21-year-old daughter of the family with whom we were living (we were crashing in their basement) on a trip up to see her boyfriend in the Navy in Seattle.  The trip up there was pretty awesome--I was a 17-year-old cruising with a beautiful 21-year-old surfer girl.  Anyway, when we got to Seattle, Mr. Wonderful had apparently found himself a new girlfriend.  My companion was crushed, and her rebound included going camping as a couple (with me) for a week in Washington. Eventually, I headed back south, hitching  to California down Interstate-5.  About the second ride I got was with a frizzy-haired hippie guy about thirty travelling with a 14-year-old girl in a Chevrolet panel truck.  When the girl opened the door, a huge cloud of marijuana smoke rolled out.  They were going to Eugene, Oregon and I climbed right in.  I was sitting on a big foam mattress on top of what I thought was a big box, maybe seven feet by four feet.  It turned out to be a coffin that they were hauling up to some commune.  It made for a weird ride, all of us high as ten kites and me sitting on a coffin, while Mr. Off The Pigs and his long-haired blonde 14-year-old girlfriend regaled me with tales of the Revolution.  They dropped me off at the S.D.S. house in Eugene, where student revolutionaries cranked a mimeograph machine all night in the kitchen and loudly discussed Marxism.  I tried to get some sleep crashed out on the floor in the dining room while fending off the house's dog, who wanted to share my sleeping bag. The Sixties was a very, very weird time in America.  Thank God."

Food/money can be had from begging or working odd jobs, and you can wash in rivers or at truck stops or homeless shelters.   Is the movie ""Into the Wild"" a good example of what this sub is?   No, that guy was an idiot who ran off alone into a remote area without any supplies or planning in order to escape all modern society.

He was a pretty damned good survivor, while down in the Lower 48.  He just seriously misjudged how difficult surviving in Alaska was going to be.  He had lots of experience surviving in pretty harsh environments (desert, mountain terrain, National Forests, etc.) and he became overconfident in his ability.  He was trying to ""go wilderness.""  There are no more places on earth that are truly wilderness, because we have satellite-mapped the entire Earth.  But if you have no maps, then ""It's wilderness TO YOU.""  He screwed up, but he was not ""an idiot.""  He made a few mistakes, and it cost him his life.  He starved to death about forty miles from a town, seven miles from a cable bridge with which he could have crossed the snowmelt-swollen river, and four miles from a fully-stocked cabin.  TAKE A MAP. His major mistakes were, IMHO, not taking a USGS map of the area into which he went, not notifying anybody that he was going there, not taking a serious .30 caliber rifle and ammunition (for hunting,) not taking any TRAPS (this was a giant mistake--this alone may have saved his life) and not knowing anything about butchering and preserving meat. (He actually killed a caribou or an elk with his .22 rifle, but most of the meat spoiled because he had no idea of how to butcher and preserve the meat from the carcass.  He needed SALT, as well, of which he did not have nearly enough.) Everybody he met in Alaska told him he was fucking up, but he refused to listen to people who actually knew how harsh Alaska can be."

vagabond,3bw4u8,generator10,21,Thu Jul 2 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"The obvious answer to your question is ""male predators.""  I know two female tramps who have well over ten years riding solo on the rails--Stray Cat Julie and Portland Jenny.  They both have told me more-or-less the same thing: they are friendly and nice with everybody up to a point, but are constantly aware that EVERYBODY THEY MEET catching out is a potential hazard.  Both of them are relatively young (I estimate that Jenny is in her late twenties/ early thirties and Julie is in her late thirties/ early forties by now) and have a very highly developed ability to read a situation and determine whether or not it is dangerous.  Both of them carry knives that they can open with one hand.  Julie, in particular, is a master at using friendliness and subtle manipulation to get out of unpleasant situations.  Both are attractive, and although they would probably deny it, they use their looks and personalities to talk their way out of tickets, arrests and other encounters with authorities.  I would sum this up as they are ""experts at passing the attitude test.""  The greatest danger to a woman travelling alone is not some brute force lout, but someone who befriends you and then betrays your trust.  There are rules about catching out--things like ""Never ever allow someone whom you do not know well and trust implicitly to board your car.""  If you are travelling with someone else, never allow anybody to outnumber you by boarding your car.  Wherever YOU go, your gear goes WITH YOU.  Do not accept a drink from anybody that is not in a sealed, unopened container (in fact, it is considered very rude to open a beverage container before handing it to somebody else, especially to a girl.)  NEVER hand over your knife or any valuable item for someone else to examine--once he has your knife, he is armed and you are defenseless.  If someone asks to see it, just say, ""I don't do that.  It's The Rules.""  (""What rules?""  ""MY rules."")  Predators often travel in groups of two or three.  Strictly avoid situations where you are outnumbered by men and they are drinking or drugging.  If a situation starts looking bad, LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.  Don't wait, and don't tolerate ANY verbal abuse or disrespect.  Creeps' behavior doesn't get better because you politely ask them to stop.  They see it as a sign of weakness, like sharks that smell blood in the water.  The only thing they truly respect is superior force.  ""Please give me my space"" isn't nearly as effective as ""Do you see this knife, asshole?  Back up or I will fucking stab you.""  In general, I find that male tramps who are not predators are very respectful and considerate of women, because there are so few women out there.  But I think it's a safe bet that virtually every male you meet, and many of the women, have an agenda.  I'm sure there will be a loud chorus of guys denying this, loudly proclaiming to be feminists, etc., blah blah blah.  I don't believe it, because it is contrary to my experience.  My girlfriend (later my wife) and I spent 18 months continuously on the road.  We were armed with sheath knives that entire time, and I also carried a goon stick sticking out of my pack.  We never actually had to cut anybody, but we had a couple of close calls, and we had several situations where somebody we met on the road propositioned my girlfriend or tried to threaten or intimidate her.  I did get into a couple of fist fights protecting her, but both times it was when we were crashing with supposed ""friends.""  (Some friends they were.) I'm sure people on here will tell you, ""That's bullshit, I hitch everywhere and I never have any trouble.""  Yeah, that's true.  Until the day you DO.  And if you aren't thinking about defending yourself, it will catch you unprepared to do so.  ""The Road"" has plenty of creeps and perverts and predators.  You cannot reasonably trust people you meet on the road and whom you barely know.  You are much better off travelling with a trusted friend, including another woman.  The two of you should know how to fight.  If you don't know how to defend yourself, I highly recommend that you learn how to do so before you go out on the road, either hitching or catching trains.  A month isn't a lot of time, but they create combat-ready Marines in 78 days.  You can do a lot in a month if you really work at it."

Of course there are all the dangers mentioned.. as far as hitchhiking, I recommend using common sense and always listen to your gut instinct. Like look inside the vehicle, speak with the driver. Note the number of people inside. If there are 2 guys, do not get in. If there's a guy with a girl that's more safe usually. Ask questions before getting in, like where the person is headed to. Watch their body language, if they seem twitchy or squirrelly in some way don't get in. Notice any clutter in the car, like open beer cans. If the person is under the influence then it's not safe to accept the ride, no matter how well intentioned the person is.  Do not fall asleep while hitching a ride.  When looking for a place to sleep, do not make camp near people if you can help it. It's much safer to walk a good ways into the woods to ensure nobody will run across you. Always carry a weapon. I have a knife, a penny sock, and 3 pepper sprays I keep accessible at all times. Never ever trust anyone you meet on your travels. ""Friends"" stealing your shit is one of your biggest concerns. Practice using your defense weapons. Also, if you dress like a guy less men will proposition you. And always remember, it's ok to say no, it's ok to pass up a ride. And always listen to your gut. Just my 2 cents :)"

vagabond,3bw4u8,baiz6,0,Sun Jul 5 02:43:18 2015 UTC,"The main danger if you're hitchhiking would obviously be to get picked up by someone who has bad intentions, especially as a woman travelling by herself. I am a fit man and I would never even risk hitchhiking alone myself. Get a knife and some pepper spray, chances are you will be harassed by men wherever you go if you are somewhat good looking, I've seen it happen way too many times. I really suggest you find a partner, preferably a man to travel with.

What other people think of as right or wrong matters little. You need to experience it for yourself, and then decide for yourself whether it's the right thing to do."
vagabond,3bsnpl,Ezraah,6,Wed Jul 1 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"I recommend that you try the life you would like to live before you actually leave home.  Take the gear you think you need and go try it out camping in state parks or national parks, etc.  An actual shake-down cruise will point up what you need but don't have and also what you have but don't really need.  You don't want to jump into it and suddenly discover that you absolutely hate camping out, sleeping on the ground, bathing in a bucket and pooping in the woods.  IMHO, you always want to have an ""escape route"" back to the life you left behind.  ""Three ways in, six ways out.  Always."""

Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters came to Houston in the 1960s, and parked their painted-up hippie bus down the street from my girlfriend's home, but unfortunately I never got to meet them. ""The Dharma Bums"" was written in 1958.

A sillcock is one of those commercial exterior water faucets you see on the outside of commercial buildings and on large campuses like a school or a business park or a warehouse area.  Sillcocks have no faucet handle, just a square-shaped valve stem.  This particular sillcock key fits four different sizes of stems.  There are other types, too, some of which only fit one size stem, usually a 1/4"" stem.  The 1/4"" type has a butterfly-shaped handle for your fingers to grasp.  You can go nearly three weeks without eating and still survive, but more than 48-72 hours without water and you are dangerously close to serious dehydration and death.

vagabond,3bd6z3,Petrarch1603,10,Sun Jun 28 07:25:22 2015 UTC,"truck stop sink and a bar of soap works great.  edit:  I'm of the philosophy that less gear is better than more gear. I understand packing a pocket rocket, or maybe a toy like a slingshot or something. But things like tents just add weight. Pack a tarp and some string instead. When its down pouring and your lazy you can just cocoon it. When its cold you can cocoon it. Dont even buy a fancy camo tarp, just one of those blue ones and a few cans of spray paint to paint that fucker black. Black is a tramps friend.  I'd rather have room to put dumpster scores and beer in my pack than be all decked out with yuppie camping gear. I guess it depends on your goals or whatever. If you're just trying to be a street kid, fuck all that mess. If you're trying to hike the PCT, then yea youre gonna need some serious camping gear. But in the context of riding trains and hitch hiking, you just need some clothes and a sleeping bag. Room for train food and drink is a must.   Plus for those of you who have never been out, remember you gotta carry this shit everywhere. Everywhere. Only in cities like New Orleans where its a trip to OPP if your spotted with a pack do you ever stash you shit. Stashing your shit is like saying good by to it. Other bums know good stash spots and other bums dont give a shit about street code and will go through your shit and take what they want if they dont just take the whole fucking bag. My girl had a bitch steal her vibrator and leave dirty tampons in their place. Bums can be fucking nasty. Don't think that everyone you meet is cool, cause at the end of the day you dont know them and theres a high percentage of street people that are a little thrown in the game."
vagabond,3bd6z3,cptainhitler,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:57:00 2015 UTC,Definitely tarp and string over tent. Tents are made to use twice. Plus you can do so much  with a tarp.

It's a 50 mile wide massif that rises about a mile out of the plains. Approaching from East or West, it looks like they appear out of nowhere. On top it's all rolling meadows and dramatic crags and empty space; feels like a secret world.   I did see he worst mosquitoes of my life in July in Wyoming, though.

vagabond,3ba0gl,avc123wtf,3,Sat Jun 27 05:19:48 2015 UTC,"These are sold by different retailers but are all the same device and are highly recommended:   Generation 1 Anker Astro Pro 2 (previous poster recommended) MP-16000/MP16000 powerbank XTpower MP-16000 Voltaic v60 (NYC) Tenergy Power16 (Frys)   For those wanting to know what this actually does.. It will take the power from a solar panel and store it. It can then be used to charge your laptop/phone/tablet without adapters. They usually come with a wall adapter for charging off house power. Also included are a huge amount of adapters for all of the different phones and tablets and laptops. This unit can take a solar charge and charge a device at the same time. Meaning if you have sun you have continuous power for your device. The capacity is about the same as normal laptop battery so that's how long it will last without power going into it. There are charging lights that also serve as double duty for charge level ie 1-5 leds, 5 being full.  They are robust and rugged. They are limited on the solar input to 1.23 Amps. That means they will only accept 25w of solar. Putting a bigger solar panel on them will not harm them. An expensive solar panel or and an inexpensive--nominal 12v--solar panel will not make any difference. Look for the distinctive alloy case and the curved LED charging/capacity indicator.  The USB is configured for Apple device charging. They will need a charging cable or have the centre pins lifted and soldered for full speed charging of Samsung/Motorola/Nokia/Android. The charging cable for micro usb might already have this done to it so check first before altering going out and buying your own cable.  My friend has literally climbed mountains with his and his is all battered and bruised. I got it for him and he has since recommeded it to others. He recently asked me to fix it, it needs a solder point reconnected but otherwise in good working condition."
vagabond,3ba0gl,digital_bum,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"You know your stuff, man. I noticed that the same device was being sold by Voltaic (as 'v72') and Anker.  Can you recommend a good portable solar panel around 25w that doesn't cost too much? Apparently this thing is only about 2.5 lbs, but I'd like to know of any cheaper options.  Or would the typical 14w anker panel be enough? I feel like it would take 10-15 hours to charge a 20,000mah battery.  This solar panel backpack attachment looks interesting too, but again, too pricey imo, and 10w seems pretty low for the battery provided."
vagabond,3ba0gl,Ezraah,2,Sat Jun 27 21:57:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the compliment. It's all there, online, just a lot of nonsense to go through.  Those Instapak solar panels are available under different names on Aliexpress perhaps for a bit less if you can stand the waiting time. They don't have a battery. So, what happens is the solar panel is wired in different ways to be able to charge a 12v battery as well as to supply the USB. The problem is USB is properly a regulated 5v and these panels only provide the solar electricity without regulation. It's haphazard as solar panels are current source devices.   That's why those batteries you first mentioned really are great for a robust, simple, solar charging solution. Use any solar panel, cheap or expensive to tap our benevolent Star's power.  I wouldn't sweat the extra 4000mAh of the V72. Just get a knockoff 16000mAh I've seen them $US80 shipped anywhere in the world. By the way these are misrepresented slightly in their capacity. They are really 4Ah 12v batteries. The 16000mAh (16Ah) is at 3.7v. From memory I think they are wired 14.4v inside (4 series) and get upverted / downverted for 5v USB and 16v respectively.  I would just put a bit of money into the battery and buy a couple of these cheapo 10w epoxy solar panels for $US22.99 300gms (10oz) each and not sweat it. Two wired in parallel will charge a 16000mAh in a day, give or take an hour or two, from flat. Try and keep 2 LEDS worth of electricity inside the battery.  I've seen the Fuse 10w as well. Great design.. Voltaic are a fucking awesome company if you ask me (I don't have any association with them and live halfway around the world from them). That's how I got onto those batteries in the first place. They replaced a faulty unit I owned no questions asked. Their solar panels are very rugged. And I've tried them all, CIGS flexible (sunlinq, global solar, military panels), thin film flexible (aka powerfilm), standard mono/poly crystalline. Theirs are monocrystalline with an aluminium sandwich backing and a clear, hard, encapsulation. Those instapark ones are nonflexible mono in a fabric I think. Anyway, if you can support Voltaic--great. Even buying their panels cheaper from Adafruit supports them I guess."
vagabond,3ba0gl,digital_bum,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"I think the anker 14w solar charger is the most 'efficient' price-wise.

Check out the Anker Astro Pro 2, but the old silver version which has a 19v dc port."

Definitely more awesome than what I would of been doing in a few months from now if I still had my old life. I've surely learned a lot about myself and life in general, follow your heart, set yourself goals and aim for happiness. Do not force yourself to continually do things that will never satisfy you because society says It's what you should do. I think about my mom often, about how she is constantly struggling, how she is always depressed, how many times she shared suicidal thoughts with me and It makes me really glad I quit that way of life."

vagabond,3b76pv,dood-man,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:11:17 2015 UTC,"It depends what kind of career, I certainly wouldn't leave the lifestyle to repair bikes for a living and I don't do races nor do I know how to do any stunts at all. It'll have to be a career that would allow me to see more than I would ever be able to see on my own, a career that would send me and my bicycle to places all over the world to bring breathtaking pictures and stories back, for that I would quit being a vagabond and get a home somewhere. No amount of money is worth my happiness, I wouldn't leave behind what makes me happy just to make money. Now if there happens to be any sponsors reading this...!"

Climbing a bridge for no reason, then using a chain as a grappling hook? I seriously doubt that chain would snag on anything in any way that would support the weight of a person. But somehow it does...  Then he leaves his backpack, which apparently was only used to carry a chain, teleports to a tunnel, and then a train magically appears."
vagabond,3b3cw8,Anticode,3,Thu Jun 25 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"Add to this, don't you think the train driver would have applied the emergency brakes to the train? I'm not expert, but surely the driver would have see grylls actually board the train afterwards? Would the train keep going anyways after an incident like this?"
vagabond,3b3cw8,Anticode,6,Thu Jun 25 19:09:19 2015 UTC,"They probably would have applied the brakes, but it can take miles for a full-speed, full-load train to stop sometimes. He may have not seen him board the train, if this was real, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't.   If Bear wanted to show actual survival strategies he (obviously would have not climbed the bridge and risked death), and instead followed the tracks, found an easy way up, and then examined the rail to see if it was still in use (lack of rust or debris is an indicator) and then set up shop in the shade for a train to show up so he could signal that he was lost via sign or signal. Then all he'd have to do is wait for the train conductor to call it up and await rescue.  Of course, fakefake."
vagabond,3b3cw8,sapiophile,2,Thu Jun 25 19:11:22 2015 UTC,"In an emergency, if you can make an electrical link between the two rails, it will provide a signal to nearby rail employees that something is wrong, and it will get checked out - or at the very least, the train is going to be going VERY slow over that block.

So either a camera guy is climbing up and down with ~30 pounds of equipment, or they have some way of lowering people from the top of the bridge. That was probably how they shot this: lower Grylls onto a section of the bridge, have him climb a few feet, then move him up.  On top of that, in this shot you can't see the top of the bridge.  Also, in the tunnel, the train is clearly 30 feet or so behind him, and they're still outrunning it."

vagabond,3b0jxf,Paxstrider,18,Thu Jun 25 00:15:14 2015 UTC,"I never intentionally vagabonded, so my experience may be different. I found that having money, while useful, only functions as a tether to your ""old lifestyle"". Only when you've used it all do you start to see things a bit differently. Suddenly, money is a tool again and not a focus of existence.   There is something freeing about having no true obligations or expectations. You can go where you wish. The line between idea and plan becomes blurred. There is freedom, especially once you've realized that you were enslaved to money all along.   The true value in life is the people, the natural world, and our experiences. Money only serves to obfuscate this truth.  Of course, it is a useful tool. Clothes, food, etc... But, I'd still say that sometimes being homeless (assuming you've supplied yourself beforehand) is easier with 0 dollars than with 1000.  If you're interested in the best combination of these factors, I'd suggest choosing a distant location and sending the rest of your money to yourself there. This way you get to experience the journey ""from zero"", you get a safety net at the end of the road, and when you finally get that money back into your hands it'll be immensely more valuable than when you started. You'll have learned how to appreciate and stretch what you have. What was just $1000 at the start of your journey will end up lasting as long as $5000 due to the way your perspective changes during the adventure.   There's not so much as a learning curve as there is an adaptation phase. Your observations about the universe are as applicable, if not more so, as they were previously. Keep your eyes open and mind active. The experience is less about learning and more about noticing. You'll note that there aren't any ""vagabond schools"" and that the advice you'll read online (and in person) varies incredibly. A successful vagabond has learned to become his own person, his own teacher.   This is why you so often hear, ""just go ahead with it"" or ""do what you want"" rather than ""X + Y = Success. Do this."" Someone who has lived a life of true freedom tends to have a hard time telling other beings what they should do with their life. Especially when they've realized the lesson is in the journey, not the destination.  “Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.”  ― Frank Herbert, Dune"
vagabond,3b0jxf,Anticode,6,Thu Jun 25 05:47:48 2015 UTC,What is your summarized experience in the vagabond lifestyle?  What you been up to?
vagabond,3b0jxf,Dendriversal,6,Thu Jun 25 06:08:19 2015 UTC,"Summarized? That's tough due to the fact that I'm a bit wordy at times (ie: all the times) and because it's difficult to summarize such a rich experience. Of course, my original post functions as a type of philosophical summary, or at least in relation to the currency-blood that so often functions as the river of our lives.  I'm not vagabonding at this time, and haven't for at least 4 years. I ended up leaving the vagabond lifestyle to join the military, to seek more life lessons and experiences. Additionally, I wanted a counterweight of structure and discipline to equalize the experiences of freedom and independence given to me by the vagabond life.   Now I'm a civilian again and it's so tempting for me to sell my car and go wander the country or world. Many people say that the vagabond life is addictive - I'd agree. But, there are few addictive things that are truly good for you... Especially when you've lost control.  I think everyone should try it once for at least a few months. The lessons and perspectives gained over even such a short time will last your entire life. Though, I think that the military has a similar function. Both of them are not, and should not, become end-states in your life.   Again I'd stress the importance of the journey, not the destination - to travel or serve in the armed forces is the journey. The destination should be a nebulous dream in your mind that changes over time as you reassess, learn, and experience life.   TLDR; The vagabond lifestyle functions as a valuable shortcut to enable a person to learn about themselves, their dreams, and the world around them. Few lifestyles force a person to become so humble and perceptive and independent.  To know a thing well, know it limits. Only when pushed beyond its tolerances will true nature be seen."

vagabond,3b0jxf,joZeizzle,3,Thu Jun 25 05:17:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a vagabond that works. I usually travel around for half the year and then find a job somewhere, generally when it gets cold, I work for a few months and then go somewhere else. When you don't have any bills what most would consider very little money (minimum wage jobs for example which there are too many where I'm from) can literally get you anywhere in no time. All of my equipment is of excellent quality and I always have access to money in case something goes wrong. Really I'd say it all depends on how you plan to live the lifestyle, I move on a bicycle and often need money for reparations, something for example a hitchhiker wouldn't have to worry about. Do I think I could go now without any money on me? Certainly, but I would most likely have to change the way I'm moving around which would cost me all the independence moving on a bicycle brings me.  I've met this couple last year in Ontario that sold weed on their way, they never ran out of money, that's something you could consider doing if you got the balls for it, buy in bulk and make mad profits on your way. Also, be responsible with your money, the first time I left I had thousands of dollars to my name and I went through them pretty fast, I was not used to eating canned and cheap food and so I would often go to grocery stores to buy steaks, BBQ chicken, energy drinks, etc.  You'll learn the value of money pretty fast on your way though, if I had to start all over again tomorrow with the money I had when I first quit and with the experience that I have now those thousands of dollars would of lasted me at least a year longer. To me it's just a matter of using your brain, being responsible and liking pop-tarts. Good luck."

vagabond,3azr9o,Richard_Engineer,22,Wed Jun 24 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"That is a lot of unnecessary and redundant items.  You should visit r/ultralight to get some more ideas and use lighterpack website to track your weights.  Lightening up your big three (pack, shelter, sleeping system) requires significant cost so I'll leave that part to your discretion.  Fires should be reserved for emergencies.  Their ability to keep you warm overnight is questionable, and they make you reek.  You also run the risk of starting your gear on fire.  Keep your emergency fire items and send home the torches, flint, excess matches, and extra flint.  Seriously, starting fires sucks unless you're in a group and have a real reason to start one.  Your clothing should be your main line of defense for staying warm.  Speaking of cookwear, cooking outdoors is heavier than not.  The following items are redundant/unnecessary and should be sent home:   calculator (you have a phone - apps are more functional and lighter) nail clippers (use your teeth) ruler trousers (only need 1 good pair) book (again, use your phone) spare cell phone (not that neccessary) phone charger, only need 1 knife, only need 1, and you'll barely use that one towel, use the air what's the bungee and paracord for?  Planning on scaling cliffs? lighter fluid - Vaseline makes a good fire starter in bad conditions and has tons of other uses. scissors, you have a knife already..... deoderant, you don't need that much, and I only use it when I get into towns.  Yo should get a tiny of bottle of dr. Bronners, it will last you a LONG time. batteries, get 1 of the small anker batteries and make sure all your electronics are USB compatible.   Water, 1L is not enough.  I have storage for over 10L.  But it really depends on where you are.  2-3L at a time is normal, but again, really depends on the situation.  You also need a water filter.  Thats not optional unless you will ALWAYS be in a town.  Purification tablets are okay but get expensive after a while.  A Sawyer squeeze is like $20 and weighs like 2 oz.  Food choices are fine.  Peanut butter is amazing too - cheap, delicious, filling, no hassle, nutritional.  1 jar can last me a week if that's all I'm eating (get boring fast, don't recommend).  Your first aid kit leaves much to be desired.  There are some good prebuilt setups at REI that are around 8 oz.  You also don't need 500 ml of antiseptic.  I carry a 2 oz. Bottle of iodine that doubles as an emergency water purifier (4 drops per liter, 30 min wait.).  You probably don't need 2 boxes of wound dressings but it's not a terrible idea.  Oh, you 100% need a tarp, tent, or bivy in case you have to sleep outside in the rain.  You need a sleeping pad as well.  You also need a LED headlamp to see at night."

vagabond,3azr9o,sapiophile,6,Wed Jun 24 21:39:01 2015 UTC,"1 sleeping bag   Keep. If you have money you could look into an ultralight bag.   2 shirts  2 trousers   Necessary.   1 pair of tracksuit shorts   Not strictly necessary.   2 pairs of socks  2 pairs of underwear   Necessary.   1 balaclava/scarf thing  1 pair of thermal gloves  1 thermal vest  1 pair of thermal leggings  1 beanie hat   Where are you adventuring? This is fairly heavy, but obviously it can get really cold out at night, depending on where you are.   1 waterproof coat  1 small towel   Fairly necessary. You might be able to get a lighter jacket that still meets your needs.   1 pair of sunglasses   If you wear prescription glasses, clip-on attachments might be an option. How useful have these actually been for you?   1 book   This is tough. Books are heavy, but I don't agree with the suggestion of reading with your smartphone, that's going to kill the battery. Keep either your backup cell phone or the book.   various pens  1 calculator  1 ruler   Not really necessary.   1 large torch  1 small torch  various batteries   How reliable are your torches? You might be able to do without one.   1 smartphone  1 spare cell phone  2 mobile phone chargers   See above.   1 flint and steal  1 box of safety matches   Skip unless you're staying at campgrounds often.   1 swiss army knife  1 spare small spare knife   Keep the knife, if it's any good.   85 feet of paracord  1 bungee cord with clips  1 spare clip   Why?   1 pair of scissors   Pick either the swiss army knife or this.   1 and a half bottles of lighter fluid   Pass unless you're visiting campgrounds often.   1 passport  1 ID card   A passport should work anywhere your ID does.   1 USB stick   Why?   1 pair of pliers   Eh...why?   3 small cans of deodorant   +1 Dr. Bronner's   1 500ml bottle of anti septic   Way too much, unless you're getting wounded constantly.   2 boxes of assorted wound dressings  various plasters  1 roll of micro-porous tape   Keep less than half.   1 set of nail clippers   Okay.   1 small tube of anti-septic cream  1 set of spray on anti-septic plaster   Way too much in the way of medical supplies. Keep a few bandaids, a small amount of antiseptic, some afterbite and something you could turn into a makeshift tourniquet if needed.   1 liter of water   Moar. Consider a water bladder if your pack would support one.  3 tins of meat and fish  1 packet of beef jerky  1 packet of wasabi nuts  1 box of breakfast crackers   50 water purification tablets   These are heavy, look into a lighter water purifier.   1 spare flint and lighter wick   Decide on one method of fire, whether that's matches, a lighter, or flint & lighter fluid."
vagabond,3azr9o,Anticode,4,Thu Jun 25 01:11:45 2015 UTC,It would help if you could be a little more specific about what exactly you are carrying.  A victorinox German army model swiss army knife is a bit more substantial than say a SAK Cadet.  How heavy is your sleeping bag?  What temperatures is it rated for and what temps are you planning on us sing it for?  That looks like it is going to be the heaviest item in your list and could theoretically be swapped for a much lighter item or maybe taken out entirely. I think you should bring more underwear and more socks too.
vagabond,3azr9o,positivenessness,4,Thu Jun 25 02:02:40 2015 UTC,"Ditch both torches for a lightweight, good-quality LED headlamp. These days I'm liking the Black Diamond Ion.  Ditch the towel; you can use a clean bandana and wring it out a few times as you wipe. A spare bandana has a lot more uses than a towel, and is about 50x smaller.  As mentioned, 500ml is way too much antiseptic. In fact, using antiseptic on wounds these days is pretty well agreed to be a bad idea, as these agents destroy both the invading cells and your own cells that heal the wound and repel them. Most doctors now recommend simple soap and water (or just water/saline for deep wounds, which should not be soaped).  Not sure what you want the plasters for, but there are almost certainly more compact options.  3 cans of deodorant is a joke, and the fact that you say ""cans"" suggests that they're the spray-kind. If you must have it, get a solid stick (much more compact and long-lasting), and if it's getting low just get a replacement when you need it.  Ditch the scissors, swiss army knife, pliers, ruler and potentially the nail clippers and replace them all with a good multi-tool, like a Leatherman Wave or Charge TTi.  Ditch the waterproof coat and replace it with a lightweight nylon poncho (make sure it's one that can cover your pack, as well). If you get a good one, it can double as a small tarp for shelter, which seems to be something you're lacking.  Ditch the calculator, replace with a smartphone app.  Ditch the bungee, learn how to tie proper knots instead. I hate bungees - they're dangerous, unreliable, heavy, bulky and completely unnecessary. Anything you can do with a bungee, you can do with some 550 cord and do it better. Learn the Trucker's Hitch, the Taut-Line Hitch, and the plain old Two Half-Hitches (with optional Round Turn), and you'll never use a bungee again (and perhaps never lose an eye to a bungee because of it).  Unless you're absolutely married to using a Zippo or IMCO refillable lighter, ditch the lighter fluid. Make a couple of vaseline-infused cotton balls in a plastic bag if you absolutely must have firestarting aids, or gather and dry an ounce or two of one of the many tinder fungi.  Ditch the thermal vest, and replace it with a thinner layer that actually covers your arms and that may be useful in more situations. Vests are extremely inefficient for warmth. I know that this may be controversial.  You will want at least another 2 pairs of socks. You will want at least the capacity to carry another 1l of water when needed, plus another gallon at times which you can buy or dumpster a jug for at the time. You will want at least a few reliable lighters (Bic) scattered throughout your person and your pack. And as already mentioned, you will want some kind of tarp - or at least a bivy if you're one of those people.  The rest, I think you're doing alright."

(Ticks, snakes in creeks and rivers) You are not invincible.  Should I stash my gear and go into town light? Stash only if you are capable of walking back to get your gear  Suggestions on how to keep my clothes and I clean? Well, showers and laundromats are ideal. Next best thing is the oceans, rivers, lakes, and swimming pools. Then it's like McDks bathroom, sprinklers, or the occasional mud puddle.  How to safely move trough wooded areas where there is a possibility of hunters? Make yourself known. Bright colors or maybe a whistle.  How important is it to make my footprint on the area minimal. Very important. Don't piss off locals. Be respectful."
vagabond,3b11m1,hichet,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"Towns are not inherently dangerous, but if you are ""stealth camping"" you will probably be trespassing.  Be wary of being seen much and do not ever leave trash or any evidence behind that you were there.  Avoid any behavior likely to attract the police. Unless you are travelling in remote areas in the Rocky Mountains, serious National parks like Yellowstone or Yosemite or in genuine wilderness areas, you are not likely to see any large animals like bears.  Maybe, but it's a big maybe.  Small critters like raccoons, skunks, etc. are much more likely.  My biggest problem with animals was domesticated dog packs and coyotes.  Mosquitoes, flies, no-see-ums and ticks are the really hazardous wildlife.  Use insect repellent liberally. In my opinion, wherever YOU go, your gear goes WITH you.  Bathe in streams, lakes, rivers, truck stops, McDonald's bathrooms and/or a clean 5-gallon plastic bucket full of water in a discreet location.  Going swimming is a good way to bathe, and fun, too. Legal, licensed hunters only hunt during hunting seasons, which are pretty much universally in the fall/ early winter.  Poachers are unlikely to just shoot anything that moves.  They are usually hunting for meat, not sport. Don't piss off the locals.   Be RESPECTFUL."

It's good to have so close, because as a bum, you do have a lot of wasted time (waiting, etc). About every week or so, I would write up a nice, coherent story about something I found interesting. I think in the end I have about 50 pages worth of stuff from that trip, but if I put my mind to it I could probably write a decent sized book about it.  Alternatively, the absolute minimum effort is to take a picture. Road signs, drivers, random stuff. Take more then ten every day, and you should be able to reconstruct a lot of things."

When I'm partying with shadier characters or spending time with a pretty girl for example.  I also can not keep a charge on my phone to be able to take pictures all the time.    I also find myself with very little wasted time.  Only on the rare instance of waiting at a train or greyhound.   Even when I'm hitching I'm walking down the road with my thumb out.  I've been meaning to start making ""focused time"" where I just sit for an hour or two with Van Morrison in my ear but have so far been unsuccessful at that.

Typically, I wear a pair of work pants (like Dickie's) and a t-shirt, one pair of boxers and some decent socks, and my military surplus boots, and a baseball cap.  In my pack I carry several pairs of socks, another pair of boxers, another t-shirt, a shorts-like bathing suit, a pair of blue jeans, a pair of leather gloves and a knit cap (for cold weather.)  Under the straps, outside my ALICE pack, I carry a military field jacket with liner, and a pair of winter Walls' canvas coveralls.  This, along with a sleeping bag and tarp, is a pretty heavy load.  I also carry a gunboat, knife-fork-spoon, a stainless steel bowl and a unbreakable plastic coffee cup tied to the outside of my pack with a piece of paracord.  Plus food.  I carry my water jug in my hand (on a nylon strap loop), but a lot of tramps don't like to do that and put their water in their pack, so their hands will be free.

vagabond,3amvpe,psychedelicjournal,2,Mon Jun 22 00:31:28 2015 UTC,"Instead of getting multiple plastic bags, get Dry Bags from Wal-mart. They give you three sizes, they are lightweight, and are cheap (under $15). This will save you weight as the wet bags are a super lightweight material and are much more water proof than plastic bags. Also, I noticed your selection on clothes is a bit heavy. May I suggest this;  *1 pair of jeans- You are not going to need two pairs of jeans during a hitching adventure. Having one in your bag and one on your persons is just to much weight. You figure, an average pair of denim jeans, weighs roughly a pound or so? That pound could be use for food/water, survival gear, and/or safety tools. Drop the two pairs and go to one. You will thank me when you won't have to toss one pair away from weight.   *1 pair of shorts- Cargo shorts are pretty nice but I find them to be on the bit bulky sizes and you never really use the pockets. All your gear is already tucked away in your bag and very rarely are you going to have to use your pockets on your shorts. Go to something more lightweight. I rock the denim jean short look.   *2 shirts- This is a good choice.    1 long sleeve shirt/thermal- I would drop the hoodie. They will cause uneven pressure on your back when walking and for the weight. Are just not worth it. I would invest in a thermal long sleeve to wear under your shirt. Worse comes to worse you can get 2-3 dollars and get a hoodie and dump it when you no longer need it.    *2-3 pairs of socks- Feet are important.Period. Three should include the socks you have on your feet.   2-3 pairs of ACTUAL underwear- Basketball shorts are a bit heavy. I would drop them, pick up a lightweight pair of swimming trunks that you don't mind wearing as shorts as well.    My total pack weight is usually about 19 lbs. I always give myself room for adding more weight on the road. You never know what cool shit you will run across."

They live in a non-descript white van with no evidence externally that it is a van-dweller's van.  They have built-in bunks, cooking facilities and a composting toilet, but no shower.  They do a lot of flea marketing, eBay sales and Craigslist, but according to the guy, his living comes from ""wise investments I made very young.""  They usually either buy attractive items at flea markets or garage sales for a low price compared to value and then re-sell on eBay or Craigslist.  Some items they dumpster dive.

I always end up spending/wasting the money I do have. So my answer to that is take as little as possible and spend as little as possible.

vagabond,3adknh,Jim1o1t,10,Fri Jun 19 07:16:38 2015 UTC,"Again, it depends on you and what you are willing to tolerate.  The old tramps I broke in with made a lot of their own gear out of stuff they found.  Do you need a $200 pack, or are you happy with military surplus?  Do you need an expensive, goose-down sleeping bag, or are you happy with a blanket bindle?  Everything is a trade off.  I like tramping the Old School way, but not everybody likes the idea of cooking in a coffee-can gunboat and carrying water in an Ocean Spray cranberry juice jug.  I strongly suggest that you do some shake-down cruise camping locally before you go out on the road, and find out what you need, what you don't need, what works and what doesn't."
vagabond,3adknh,Frightened_Peasant,4,Fri Jun 19 07:31:15 2015 UTC,"That'll be enough, sure. I'd budget 100 for a pack, 100-150 for a sleeping bag and bivi then get a cheap closed foam mat and a pot to cook/drink/eat out of. You could do it a lot less buying second hand stuff if you've got time to source it. Buy the big things first because you can get sucked into buying little things that all add up and you probably don't need.  If you want gear advice I heard good things about the us military modular sleep system for a sleeping bag and bivi.   Wherever you get your pack try it on loaded first and don't feel bad about looking round the shop for an hour whule wearing it to make sure its comfortable. They should have weights for you to try with."

Does it have that little detail of the sepal having that little hook in it? Are they opposite or alternate leaves? Knowing the terms and what makes one plant different to another, informs you of what details to use when trying to ID comparing a specimen to a picture or technical botanical description.  That said, there is magnitudes more that is safely edible compared to toxic, while toxic stuff often advertises it's compounds. Spiky or shiny leaves? Umbel flowers like Hemlock? Almond smell?  But then you're talking in /r/vagabond which suggests travelling on highways and railways. Many plants that you'd use as staple foods, which grow along road-ways, are heavy metal sponges which bio-accumulate toxins. Often they're used for this very purpose as artificial wetlands or the like. So depending on the environment, the best stuff can be ruled out by pollution."

There are plenty of edible plants out there that are easy to ID that don't have toxic look alikes.  If you want to get started learning check out Eattheweed's channel on youtube.  I would also add that no matter how good you are at IDing plants you are unlikely to be able to gather enough to live on unless you plan on making a fulltime job out of gathering.

vagabond,3ac5ao,SunsetRoute1970,10,Wed Jun 24 04:39:21 2015 UTC,"Like everything else about trainhopping and tramping, there are RULES about dumpster diving.  --NEVER eat anything straight from a dumpster.  Dumpsters are germy places, and I shudder to think what kind of germs might be on prepared food, like pizza or fried chicken, that was just tossed in a dumpster.  --COOK EVERYTHING THOROUGHLY.  If you dumpster pizza, DO NOT just eat the pizza.  That would be a great way to contract gastroenteritis, and you'd be barfing up your guts and shittin' like a goose.  BOIL EVERYTHING at least a few minutes.  Most germs like shigella and E.coli will be killed by temperatures below boiling, but don't risk it.  Boil everything.  I've eaten pizza soup numerous times.  It's not bad, especially if mixed with some other stuff, like rice, macaroni or Ramen noodles.  Boiling will kill 99.99% of all bacteria.  Dead bacteria are not harmful to you (except botulism, but that comes from bad canned goods or poorly done home canning.)  Keep in mind that elevation is important.  Water will boil at a much lower temperature in Denver than it will in Corpus Christi.  Buying a small pressure cooker is not a bad idea.  --NEVER eat anything from a swollen can or a can with rusty, dark-colored seams.  The risk of botulism is very high, and could kill you.  Dented cans are highly suspect.  If there is pressure inside a can when you puncture it, forget it.  Throw the can away.  Don't confuse a vacuum inside with pressure inside.  Vegetables, etc. are canned ""hot,"" to kill germs.  When the can cools, it creates a vacuum inside.  When you puncture the can to open it, it should SUCK AIR IN, not blow air out.  The vacuum makes a little ""Pssp"" noise when the can opener punctures it.  --COOK ALL DUMPSTERED RAW VEGETABLES.  You may find vegetables in a grocery store dumpster that just have a little bad spot, like carrots, potatoes or cucumbers.  They're perfectly okay, just cut out the bad spot,  but you MUST COOK THEM before eating.  Fruits that have a non-consumable skin (bananas, oranges, watermelon, etc.) are okay to eat without cooking if the skin is intact and the fruit isn't rotted.  Wash them off first--you might want to add a little Clorox to your wash water. --Canned goods that are ""out of date"" are okay as long as they aren't more than a month or two OOD.  --Medications in sealed containers (aspirin, ibuprofen, Tylenol) are fine if they are out of date.  Pharmaceutical ""expired"" dates are complete bullshit.  It has to do with marketing, not medicine.  People in Third World countries buy the out-of-date American pharmaceuticals at a discount price and use them in hospitals.  I say again:  SEALED, UNBROKEN CONTAINERS.  I have heard people say that they have taken loose tablets or capsules dumpstered from behind a pharmacy.  This is not a very good idea.

vagabond,3ac5ao,RiotGrrrl585,2,Fri Jun 19 13:49:36 2015 UTC,"Another important consideration is the ambient temperature.  If the temperature is lower than 40 degrees, nearly all bacterial growth slows way, way down or ceases completely.  (This is why refrigerators work.  The food is kept, or should be kept, at 38 degrees.)  Dumpstering food in summer is a great deal more hazardous than dumpstering food in wintertime."

Farmers markets are definitely better scores, and unfortunately 90% of vagabonds never even think about it. I've gotten my best scores at farmers markets by helping the people breakdown their booths/tables when the market ends. I always go for the avocado vendors or sweet potato vendors, since those are the most filling and nutritious for easy cooking that goes along with anything.   Also farmers markets are great places to find jobs. ask every single vendor there if they are looking for a farm hand or someone to landscape or pull weeds. Even better, when other vendors see you working or helping out another vendor, they are much more likely to hire you or hear the word of mouth that you are looking for a job. It's good social networking for a hobo, and guaranteed food."

As Shazzam said make sure you have the proper ID and having no criminal history will help.    EDIT: i just read you plan on entering via LA, but I figured NYC since you are in the UK.  If you do the bus ticket route obviously make the onward bus somewhere close...like washington state to canada if you land in LA.   I also believe some bus tickets are refundable if you pay more."

Go through your gear with a fine tooth comb to make SURE you don't have any leftover weed or anything like that anywhere in your stuff.

They grilled me about it for a while and searched all my stuff. If you tell them you are just traveling, I would invent a rough plan (the man loves to plan) and tell them you will rent a car or something. Or maybe find an LA redditor to let you use their address as a friend you are visiting. They will be really butt hurt about the money (or may just let you in without a care, probably depends on a ton of factors out of your control) so any plan you can invent that involves not needing much money is better.

vagabond,3a46h8,sillybird99,10,Wed Jun 17 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the biggest impediment to going on the road is all the ""stuff"" we collect when we are stationary.  The best time is when one is first ""emancipated"" (age 18 or so) when you have nothing.  You leave your parents' home and you rent an apartment and all that's in it is a mattress on the floor, cardboard boxes and a table and two chairs.  No flat screen TV, no stereo system, no painstakingly accumulated antique furniture you'd be loathe to lose--nothing.  When you could ditch it all without a thought, that's the time to go tramping.  Lose your job?  Break up with your girlfriend?  No kid, no mortgage, no obligations?  That's the time.  There's nothing wrong with ""part-timing"" it, either.  You go when you can, and when it's time to go back to university, back you go.  I have cautioned many a college kid on-line about how to ride the rails, and I always remind them that the MOST DANGEROUS THING about trainhopping is that it is addictive and it's hard to stop once you start.  You catch out one night at age eighteen, and the next thing you know you are twenty-six with no education, no career, no money and no prospects.  But the ride was sure fun. I didn't start college until I was 36 years old.  Think about that."

It isn't always an easy lifestyle and most people who tries it end up giving up on it, It's something you gotta be seriously mentally prepared for, it sounds to me that you are not satisfied with the way things are going in your life and you're just trying to run from it all, I am not trying to ""talk you out of it"", I haven't had an easy life myself and thinking about it now It's the reason why I have chosen the lifestyle and yes, I'm happy now, took me a long time to grow the balls to leave home though, I sat with most of the gear I needed in my room for over a year before I felt truly ready, and we're talking about a lot of stuff here, stuff worth a lot of money, got me months behind on my rent, just to say that not because you think you're ready for it that you really are. If really you are decided and nothing in this world will hold you from doing it I think you should work for a while, clear you debts and save up some money, have your credit cards ready in case of an emergency. Now what exactly are your plans? How are you planning on living the lifestyle? How are you gonna move around? Train hopping? Hitchhiking? On a bike? A van? A motorcycle? On foot? Where do you live? What kind of weather do you deal with? How are the winters there? Where and how are you going to sleep? How are you gonna eat?

I plan on hitchiking/ back packing and busking along the way. I busk in my hometown periodically and make a few hundred a month if I do about 5 hours a week. I live in Oregon now, and I would probably head south and then east. No real plan other than seeing the country, lost friends and found friends, and overseas when it works out.

I moved to CO last year and due to a less-than-ideal roommate situation, moved back home.  Got my old job back, moved back in with my old friends... and it sucks!  Driving cross-country to a place I've never been before and calling it home for little while was a great experience.  But now that my job has worn me down with stress and frustration, and my car loan is less than what I could sell it for, I'm itching to leave again.  Buy a van, pack up the essentials, get rid of the BS and hit the road.  Having an in-demand skill set (line cook/kitchen area) means I could get a job anywhere there's a restaurant, and even the tiniest of towns have at least one.    But even as I type out all of this, I'm trying to reflect on what's holding me back.  Money is always an issue, but I've scraped by before and I've got more in my savings now than I've had in years.  Fear of the unknown is probably what it boils down to for me and every one else.  It can't be predicted and no two people could have the same experiences.  It seems really cathartic to me, I guess."

There are rules about trainhopping.  They have been in place for many, many years and they were designed to greatly reduce the hazards.  --""Never ride the rods, the ladders, the bumpers or the deck.""  This is a very old rule, as railcars no longer have ""rods"" under the car upon which someone might ride.  The ""bumpers"" are what we would call couplers today (the part where the cars connect) and 'the deck"" means the roof of the cars.  --Never get on a train without at least one gallon of water.  --Spend as little time standing up as possible.  Sit down, with your back against the forward bulkhead of the car in a boxcar.  (This is because of slack action.)  --Always have at least one hand on a grab iron.  --NEVER ride IN FRONT OF A LOAD (or between loads, either.)  If the train derails or hits something, you will be crushed when the cargo slides forward.  --NEVER hit a rolling train.  Board trains when they are STANDING (i.e. ""stopped"") at signal lights, at crew change locations, in yards, etc.  Certain places on the railroad are traffic choke points, where the trains must stop and wait for a green light signal.  That is where you board.  --Pitch your gear before detraining from a slowly moving train.  It is possible to safely get off a train, but always drop your gear first, then go back for it.  If you try to get off wearing a pack, you are going to go ass over teakettle.  --Wear sturdy boots, leather gloves and a hat.  Take a coat everywhere you go, even in summer.  You need a sleeping bag or blanket bindle, a tough, durable pack that can take hard use and abuse, some kind of tarp, and at least one 1-gallon water jug made of unbreakable plastic.  I recommend Ocean Spray cranberry juice jugs.  They are very tough."

The obviously over-the-top example of inappropriate behavior is very unlikely (it was supposed to be so exaggerated anybody could see it was deliberately so) and also would obviously cause any witnesses to it to immediately want to beat the crap out of the fictitious ""me"".  The connection between inappropriate clothing/behavior/flaunting of social norms in my fictitious café, and inappropriate behavior of your average crusty is apparently a bridge too far.  Which is unfortunate, because the point, while not made well (or apparently, at all) is valid.   One cannot just dress, and behave, and maintain whatever hygiene regimen one chooses, and not piss off the rest of society.  And my example there was ""How would someone fare if he went down to the Castro carrying a sign that says, ""God hates fags""?  Obviously, he would not fare well.  Clothing is Communication.  Behavior is Communication.  Hell, BATHING is communication.  And what one is communicating to the rest of the world, if one dresses in a fashion CALCULATED TO OFFEND is ""I hope this offends you.""  Nobody is going to improve the world by deliberately setting out to offend the majority culture.  It's reckless, and dangerous.  Especially in the Central United States.

I'm willing to bet there are stipulations and you can't just say you're coming to stay for half a year without any savings or plans.  Last time I traveling, I was told the best ways to cross from BC to washington were either: There used to be lousy border control on a ferry from Victoria to Port Angeles. That was one way, but I'll bet you anything they've changed that by now. Another was train hopping, though they've tightened up security a lot and they have things like infrared scanners now. The other way was to cut your hair, wash your clothes, and make up a story about how you're visiting x relative or some other valid reason that you're going to be there for only a short period of time to do one specific planned task.   Take that with a grain of salt. I'm not a lawyer and my advice is anecdotal. I would definitely look up that 6 mo thing though, see what that's about. If that's really a thing, check to see if you're allowed to work, because they're typically very strict about that and they'll make you get a work visa and file income tax and shit."
vagabond,39r74h,pseudolobster,2,Sun Jun 14 03:33:28 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the answer. As far as I know Canadians do not require visas to enter the US and can visit the country for 182 days before having to come back into the country. I plan to work while I am in Canada and I expect to have enough savings to support myself during my stays in the US, I don't plan on sleeping in hotels and eating restaurant every day, I won't live on much money. I know for a fact that many foreign cyclists comes into the country to do that sort of thing, as long as I tell them that I will sleep in campsites and not camp where I shouldn't be I don't see why they would deny my entry. I will also have my credit cards in case of an emergency IF never something happens. Simply put; have money on you, be honest with them, tell them you're a cyclist and really I don't see why you wouldn't get in.  The internet says that Canadian visitors are generally granted a stay in the U.S for up to 6 months at the time of the entry, from what I am gathering from the multiple forums and sites I have been reading is that usually Canadians are allowed to stay in the country for 6 months but if suspected of anything or if the agent doesn't believe you will be able to support yourself during your stay, or if the agent simply doesn't like you he can decide to give you less or simply deny your entry.  I could be wrong here but I also believe that if you decide to cross the Mexican border from the US, days spent in Mexico are counted as days spent in the US so you would have to take a flight there back to Canada."
vagabond,39r74h,IT_is_not_all_I_am,2,Sun Jun 14 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"After a quick read of the US Embassy website (http://canada.usembassy.gov/visas/information-for-canadians.html), it does look the like 6 month thing is real, although as an article in Forbes (see link below) points out, you aren't actually limited to 6 months in a calendar year, but you must exit after 6 consecutive months.  Although note: ""All Canadians are reminded that U.S. law requires all foreigners to qualify for the desired stay and purpose at the time of their initial entry. A visitor who intends to live, work or study in the U.S. without disclosing this information beforehand may be permanently barred from the U.S."" -- so I think that means you need to be honest about how long you intend to stay and what your purpose is when you cross the border.  I think you probably want to say that you are visiting for vacation, and intend to stay for up to 6 months, and have your route plans mapped out that you can show them. You will not be studying or working (since you need a visa for that).  You have adequate money for your travel, plans for where you will sleep, etc.  I would think that crossing the border by bike might actually be easier, since you look less like someone trying to move across the border permanently.... my brother once got stopped trying to cross the border when he was moving from the west coast to the east coast of the USA -- he wanted to drive through Canada to see Toronto and Montreal on the way, but he was denied entry; he figured it was because they thought he was actually trying to emigrate to Canada.  Here's some more info I found that might be helpful:  http://www.cyclecanada.com/Borders.htm  http://www.theslowlane.com/paths/route.html  http://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2015/01/19/how-long-can-a-canadian-stay-in-the-us-and-vice-versa/  Edit: to clarify, I think you should carefully map out an itinerary of where you're going and when, with hostels and campgrounds marked that you can show the border guards, even if you don't actually plan on following any of it or are really planning on wild camping.... although planning your trip for real is probably a good idea anyway."

I'm usually able to find somewhere dry if I know rain is coming though. I rarely have to set up the second tarp. Then I have a super light foam pad and a lightweight sleeping bag.

vagabond,39r8or,SunsetRoute1970,3,Sun Jun 14 10:52:49 2015 UTC,"There are different criteria that one uses to decide on acquiring/keeping any particular piece of gear.  You will always be able to use a sleeping pad.  You will not always be able to use a hammock.  Sleeping pads insulate you from cold ground.  You would freeze your butt off in a hammock in chilly weather, and using one would be ill-advised in the extreme in really cold weather.  Sleeping in a typically American hammock is not great for your back but ""matrimonial"" hammocks from Latin American countries seem to serve many people very well.  (They are not designed to be packable, though.)  All that said, I still carry a cheap Wal-Mart hammock.  Mainly for wet, muddy conditions where there are trees between which to swing it. My preference is for a tarp over a tent, although many people disagree with me.  Tents are too difficult to exit in a sudden crisis, in my opinion.  (Once burned, twice shy.)  Tarps are less effective in inclement weather, true, but more versatile.  Two people travelling together, each packing a tarp (hopefully the same size/design tarp so that the grommets will align) can actually rig a variety of different shelters.  Even if you decide on a tent as primary shelter, a tarp rigged as a rain cover allows you to create extra storm-proof accommodations.  My tarp is mainly to protect my sleeping bag from rain, dust, etc. and to create a ""foul weather taco"" if the weather kicks up after I'm already rolled out."

vagabond,39r8or,AesirAnatman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:44:45 2015 UTC,"Those are really big questions that require long, complicated answers.  Short version, you rig a tarp or tarps mainly as a rain fly or sun shade.  If you get a really big blow, you'd probably be better off in a tent.  Tarps don't shield you much from wind.  In wind conditions, you roll out ""taco style"" with one tarp, on cardboard if you have any, and rig a low fly with a very low, flat peak and a short pole.  Stake deeply in windy weather.  In cold weather, I go to a Southern state about a month before winter starts good.  Never used a bivy sack or bivy tent, too restrictive.

Do you carry stakes and tent-poles with you to do the rigging?   If the SHTF, I want to be able to get out of my gear and tarp and on my feet ready to fight in a hurry.   Okay.

vagabond,39r8or,AesirAnatman,2,Tue Jun 16 06:17:17 2015 UTC,"Depending on the situation, you can rig the tarp with a high front pole and no back pole, with a steep runoff, or two high poles with steep runoff, or a lower front pole with no back pole and shallow runoff, or two lower poles and shallow runoff; or two front poles and no back poles, etc. Get a 3x5 card.  Fold it in half so it looks like a little pup tent.  Get some toothpicks and kitchen matches.  Poke small holes (for toothpicks) along the edges of the card that match the grommets in your tarp.  Now you can fold and refold the card various ways for various conditions.  Strong wind?  Rig a low-to-the-ground pitch that will weather wind better, with deep tent stakes and strong anchor lines.  Slow drizzle rain, but no wind?  Rig a high-rise, shallow run-off rain fly, pretty high off the ground so you can move around, cook, etc.  If there are two people with two tarps (and it's not raining yet) lay the taps out flat with a 6-inch overlap and duct-tape both sides of the overlap.  (You'll have to tape one side then flip the tarps over.)  You could then rig high with two tall poles and six slightly shorter ""fly poles"" on the sides.  I often have or cut a good walking stick.  It's a good idea for you and your partner to have walking sticks pretty much exactly the same length.  In a pinch, there's your two main tent poles (especially in the desert, where good sticks are sometimes hard to find.)  In a wooded or brushy area, you can cut field expedient tent poles wherever you can find them, out of limbs or branches.  Too flimsy and the wind will bend them.  Too stout, and if the tarp collapses, you might be beaned by a tent pole. Tarps are cheap, maybe $10.  Buy a 5X8 brown, woven-vinyl Wal-Mart tarp, go out in the back yard or at the park with some poles, some 550 paracord and eight stakes, and start rigging.  Before long, you'll get it."

vagabond,39r8or,AesirAnatman,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:50:54 2015 UTC,"They certainly can be, along with wind and blown rain, etc..  But I prefer dealing with all of the problems that sheltering under a tarp entail rather than pack a tent.  My biggest concern, as a trainhopper, is having someone come upon my camp without me knowing it, being inside of a sleeping bag in a zipped up tent.  Like I said, once burned, twice shy.  I want to be able to come out of that sleeping bag in a big ass hurry, ready to defend myself. Normal tramps understand that entering into someone else's camp unannounced (""HELLO the camp!  Can I come in?"") is tantamount to an attack upon the camp.  NEVER do this.  Stop well outside the camp and ask permission, and stop walking until you get it.  If the people in the camp say, ""Not today"" or something like that, you would be wise to respect it and keep going elsewhere.  Entering into someone else's camp is like entering into someones living room in regular life.  If you just barge in to a stranger's living room you could very well be hurt or killed.  Don't do it."
vagabond,39r8or,SunsetRoute1970,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:38:25 2015 UTC,"Good advice. I'll keep it in mind. As far as setting up in my yard, what's the best basic set up (in decent weather conditions)? Throw the tarp on the ground, a sleeping pad on that, and then a sleeping bag on that?"
vagabond,39r8or,Frightened_Peasant,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:16:48 2015 UTC,"I normally carry my sleeping bag rolled up inside of my sleeping tarp.  I fold the tarp in half lengthwise, which leaves me with a 3x8 tarp ""envelope.""  I stretch my zipped-shut, partially-folded-in-half-lengthwise sleeping bag out on the tarp, then start rolling it up in the tarp, starting with the open ""top"" end of the bag.  (I partially fold the sleeping bag in half lengthwise to make it more-or-less the same width its entire length to make an evenly-rolled-up final result.)  The sleeping pad is under the bag, between the tarp and the sleeping bag. After I roll the first layer, I ""fold in the tarp"" from the sides, so that the tarp will be trapped in the TIGHTLY rolled up sleeping bag as I go.  Every few inches, I pull the tarp into the bag from the sides.  When I am close to the end, I fold the ""leftover"" tarp at the foot of the bag back in on itself, and the end result is that the bag is completely and tightly rolled together with the sleeping bag, completely covering the bag, and protecting it from getting wet, dusty, dirty, etc.  I tie it shut with a couple of pieces of thin 1"" nylon strap which have a loop tied into one end.  Thread the running end through the loop, cinch it tight, then throw a couple of half hitches so it can't loosen up until you want it to. To ""roll out,"" I loosen the straps, and ""flip"" the rolled up bag, which more-or-less unrolls by itself.  If it looks like it might rain, I open the folded-in-half-lengthwise tarp and put the sleeping bag inside, like a ""taco.""  (In fact, this arrangement is called a ""tarp taco."")  When I was a kid, back in 1970, being able to roll up your gear in a very tight, very precise, almost military fashion was the mark of a ""good tramp.""  People who were sloppy with their gear were considered to be inept and not serious about Tramp Life.  Obviously, in a serious rainstorm, this arrangement is not going to keep you dry.  Some people carry two tarps--one for their bag and one for overhead cover, like a ""fly.""  Two people travelling together can combine tarps to create a better shelter.  Plenty of people just carry a pop-up tent.  I like tarps because they are less likely to break, they are lots cheaper to obtain, and very versatile."

A sleeping pad is like a lightweight mattress and you're going to have a tent anyway, so you can just get the sleeping pad and still have room in your tent for your gear"
vagabond,39r8or,Jim1o1t,6,Sun Jun 14 00:18:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a side sleeper and I slept in a hammock for a year with no problem.  You sleep diagonal in a hammock, so your body stays essentially flat, and it's easy to twist onto your side or even stomach.  They do make fancy ones with bug nets, tarps, and insulation systems for winter camping.  And in a pinch, if you can't find anything to hang it from, you can use a hammock as a bivy sack.  I think a real downside of traveling with a hammock is you can't really offer shelter to traveling companions, like you can with a tent or larger tarp.  You also need to figure out a way to keep your pack dry and secure while you sleep.  If you're shopping for hammocks, take a look at Hennessy Hammock (hennessyhammock.com) and Eagle Nest Outfitters (ENO) (https://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com) -- they both make good stuff."

I said  ""yes,"" we travelled together for about 18 months, then returned back to Houston and later got married.  Didn't last though.  I actually wanted to be on the road, to live on the road.  For her, it was more like a desperate, I-have-to-get-the-hell-out-of-here-right-freaking-now sort of decision.  On the road, I was highly skilled at how to survive on the bum: Mr. Wonderful.  Back home in Houston, though, it was ""When are you going to grow up and get a real job?""  (I should have bailed, the minute she said that.)

There's not much you can do about some psycho who suddenly pulls out a gun, but experienced people, especially experienced women, seem to gain a sort of ""sixth sense"" (I know, it's stupid) about weird-ass people.  My first wife and I travelled together for about eighteen months, and sometimes she would take one look at the driver and just say, ""Nope.  Not this time,"" and I would just have to pass it up.  I could never really see what she was talking about, but I definitely believed she could sense trouble.  She was the same way about riding trains with people we didn't know well.  Sometimes she would be okay with staying in a jungle, sometimes she would say, ""We need to go."" She was pretty damned fearless and never complained, so when she said, ""No,"" I listened to her.

The U.S. is a pretty hazardous place if you are on foot and alone.  (I hitchhiked everywhere when I was a teen . . .)

(We were fresh off the road after 18 months of tramping and we couldn't get to sleep in a bed because it was too soft, we slept on the floor in sleeping bags.)  Dean Corll had been killed and his two teenaged accomplices, David Brooks and Elmer Wayne Henley were telling the police where the bodies were buried.  The County morgue was located directly across the hall from the laundry where we worked and the odor of death was absolutely intolerably strong.  We called the union, but they never really did  much.  It was a awful couple of weeks until they had them all identified, x-rayed, etc.  Horrible.  I was lucky in that I spent most of my time on the road, but the smell just seemed to linger on and on.  Dean Corll was a monster.  So are Henley and Brooks (they got life without parole.).  Some of the victims were school friends of the two boys, sold out to Corll for $200 each and the use of Corll's Corvette.  The entire episode is just so ghastly and horrible, it makes one doubt humanity.  The victims' parents all thought they were runaways.

If you're looking for company PM us; we might be a good match. Right now there are four of us: two cis-men, one cis-woman, and one transman. As a group we're between 18 and mid 20s.  About half of us have done dirty kid stuff before, but only one of has experience with trains. We're thinking of hopping from Worcester and aim towards albany, but really we have no agenda other than to get on the road. I can't guarantee anything, but another hand couldn't hurt."

It would help if you learned more active language and storytelling skills. So many sentences start with dependent clauses and that makes it a bit tiring to read. You also rely heavily on transitive verbs and it makes it feel like you're telling a story about yourself, rather than putting your reader in the driver's seat with you.  No disrespect of course. Just some friendly advice."

vagabond,39i6gb,Travelingmane,4,Thu Jun 11 21:53:52 2015 UTC,Spray paint.
vagabond,39i6gb,cptainhitler,5,Fri Jun 12 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"Depending on the urgency of the situation: 1.)  Use what you've got if it can be used.  I never owned a messenger bag, so IDK.  Almost completely broke?  Spray paint.  Absolutely NO money?  Fly a sign, raise $5, then spray paint, I guess. 2.)  Ebay for some kind of decent pack.  ITWM, I'd choose an ALICE pack.  Super durable, pretty cheap (< $50) and it will blend in well with your hard corps brethren.  (Valuable gear attracts jackrollers anyway.  Who needs it?) 3.)  Roll up your sleeping bag bindle style, swing it off one shoulder on a nylon strap, load your possibles in the freshly-painted messenger bag.  When you get a little ahead, invest some money in durable boots, and a warm coat.  Doc Martens boots should be okay for now.  Use what you got.  ""Use it up, wear it out, Make it do, or do without."" 4.)  Anything you can't carry or don't need sell it on Craigslist or EBay.  Stereos, expensive skateboards, electronic whatever-kind-of-games, etc.  Hit the pawn shop and turn that excess crapola into food money. 5.)  Fly a sign.  Don't get cute.  You're broke, and you need help.  Bring your gear to the corner so the tourists can see you aren't screwing around, that you really ARE broke.  Get food money.  Look for a job you can manage while out on the street.  I'd try for a restaurant job, you usually get a free meal with every shift you work.  Start off as a dishwasher until you get bored and/or itchy feet.  Be fair to your employer, don't leave him in the lurch. 6.)  Start planning and making better decisions so this doesn't happen again.  You should always have a safety net--a bank account, a credit card you never use, SOMETHING so you don't wind up fucking yourself up again."

I don't think you want a bag that stands out for loads of reasons plus messenger bags aren't anywhere near as comfy as a proper backpack. If it's worth anything sell it and buy something else.

vagabond,39i6gb,SunsetRoute1970,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:49:21 2015 UTC,"When you are suddenly and unexpectedly forced out onto the street, the problem is that you are not PREPARED for this abrupt onset of distressing circumstances.  So.  Prioritize your needs quickly.  (You can use Mazlow's Theory of Needs.  Google it.) 1.) Oxygen.  Already covered, but #1 and most important. 2.)  Water.  You need a source of clean, drinkable water ALL the time, and preferably without any limitations.  You could go maybe three days without water.  After that, you die.  Think desert, think trapped in a boxcar, think trapped below ground or in a dry cave.  Understand?  Water.  SILLCOCK KEY (Google it), filtration tool, water purification tablets, etc. 3.)  Shelter.  Now we're getting somewhere.  You need shelter, and soon.  Couch surfing, rescue missions (they have their own set of problems), or camping out.  For camping, you need a sleeping bag or blanket bindle, a woven vinyl tarp (brown or camo, but not blue unless you have no choice) and some good , flattened, cardboard boxes.  And a safe place to roll out. IF YOU HAD THOUGHT AHEAD and owned a VAN, your shelter problem would be non-existent, because you could just live in your van.  If you can't afford to buy a tarp, look for those printed advertising tarps flown by new real estate developments, etc.  Be cautious flying the printed side locally, though.  Spray paint on the advertising side a little to obscure the business' name and phone number. 4.)  Cooking and eating.  Dumpster dive restaurants for the makin's.  Promote a 1-gallon tin can (coffee can or food can only, no chemicals or anything, Duh.)  This is called a ""gunboat.""  It's your free cook pot.  Scrounge up a fork & spoon and a bowl at the Sallie Ann or St. Vinnie's.  Look for a PLASTIC coffee cup.  (No glass, they break and they're heavy.)  A long-handled wooden spoon would be good, too.  Buy oatmeal, dried beans, rice, cornmeal.  LEARN TO COOK ON AN OPEN FIRE."
vagabond,39i6gb,SunsetRoute1970,2,Tue Jun 16 08:26:03 2015 UTC,"You need an income, like yesterday.  Get as cleaned up as you can (you can bathe and wash clothes in a clean, 5-gallon bucket.  I once washed clothes in the Mississippi River.) and start pounding the streets looking for a job, PREFERABLY A JOB ON THE BUS LINE SOMEWHERE.  If your appearance is weird, FIX IT.  Get a haircut, trim your beard (or better, shave).  Get paper & pencil, make a resume'.  You need I.D.  You need a Social Security card.  You need a phone number (thank God for pre-paid cell phones.)  You need references,  Forget Day Labor places, they are rip-off exploiters.  Go Craigslist.  Fly a sign, raise money for a 30-DAY BUS PASS so you can look for work. Once you get a job (restaurant jobs are good), your life now revolves around the job.  Don't be late, don't call in sick unless you really are sick.  Do an excellent job at work.  No fucking around, no stealing shit, nothing like that.  DO A GOOD JOB.  Get a bank savings account and start filling that sucker up with cash.  (Save up money to buy a van.  It will take a long time.)  Start studying mechanics, you need to know how to fix cars. MOVE CLOSE TO WHERE YOU WORK.  Buy a used, beater bicycle or dumpster dive junk bikes and bike parts and build one out of parts  Get a few tools, you need to be able to fix your own bicycle.  Nice weather, bike to work.  Shitty weather, take the bus. You can survive by dumpstering most of your food.  You can raise capital flying a sign.  Don't get into the habit (it's all too easy to do so) of partying on corner money.  Once you own a van, you have a permanent, MOBILE place of residence.  Your paycheck will go a whole lot farther if you don't have to pay RENT.  You will have to have somewhere you can receive mail, though.  I recommend a either a friend's house or a Postal Box service for stuff like car registration, Driver's License, car insurance, eBay stuff, etc. Understand?  Your goal is to be FREE and INDEPENDENT and earning your own living. If you go the other route and hit the road, my suggestions would be slightly different. Be honest.  Treat everybody with dignity and respect, but take no shit off of anybody.  As much as you can, obey the law.  Be a man of honor and self-respect, because your word is your bond.  There Is No Law But Hobo Law, and Hobo Law is Law Enough."

vagabond,39970w,Ezraah,3,Wed Jun 10 05:45:30 2015 UTC,Thanks! You should do it! Preserve the moment and encourage others. I'm travelling light. I've got a D3300. I ditched my kit lens and just use a 35mm f1.8. It's good for a lot of situations but I obviously run into a TON of limitations using only one focal length. I'm thinking about getting a job to save up for a better camera.
vagabond,39970w,Ezraah,5,Wed Jun 10 05:49:41 2015 UTC,"Nice! I have a D5300 with that same lens! As well as a few others.   Honestly as much as I love the 35mm prime, I could never give up my Sigma 17-50mm f2.8. If it's not night, or I'm not doing quick street photography, I have the Sigma mounted instead. Your best investment would probably be good fast standard zoom like that, instead of a better body.   Idea: I've thought about busking by taking photo portraits for donations. Might be a fun way to make a few bucks. Take the shot, hand out the url they'll be uploaded to, make some money. Plus you get to practice your photography.  Win-win."

vagabond,39dvcl,presology,3,Thu Jun 11 02:25:33 2015 UTC,"Well if prison has taught me anything, let me tell you some good recipes:  Get some top ramen, I usually go for shrimp as it goes with fish quite well. Break up the noodles into tiny pieces, pour boiling water, drain, add the fish, mayo, mustard, hot sauce, bits of cheese (if you have it) and then add the seasoning packets. If you have a packet of frozen veggies they are great in the dish also. You don't need to add mayo, mustard and hot sauce, but they thicken the meal and gives more flavors. But if you are afraid you might ruin the flavor of the dish, just go with ramen, fish, and veggies. the cheese is extremely good though."

I've never had much of a tick problem actually. Mosquitoes are annoying but I have bug spray which keeps them away for the most part.   I just added up my hitchhiking milage. It's around 2200 miles. I'm pretty new to it still. I've gone 5500 by van, 1900 by bus and 350 by freight train. Oh and 450 by Amtrak. That's a little over 10,000 miles altogether now I guess.

I don't plan on doing the a.supertramp thing anyway and there's tons of ways to keep mosquitos away.    I gotta say I am so jealous.  I could ask a million questions.

I carry the minimum because my dogfood, camera and mandolin make up for a lot of weight. Two sets of clothes, a length of rope, a pocket rocket stove, a spoon, can opener, sew kit, toiletries, a little first aid and a frisbee for my dog. I've got two tarps. One for the ground and one for if it rains. I've got a foam sleeping pad and a lightweight sleeping bag. I just upgraded from a heavy sleeping bag + no sleeping pad and this is way better and lighter. What else? .... I've got maps, song lyrics and a notebook. Oh and a Nintendo DS for playing Pokemon when things get slow. I'll try to make a full list with pictures and post it tomorrow.  You're so not making yourself a pest. Feel free to ask away!

What I had in mind was more walking than hitching so I'd probably do less miles.  What kind of camera? I have a decent dslr I don't wanna give up but it's bulky and I know it'd be the first thing recommended to leave behind if I asked for advise.  What's the coldest you've been out in and how did your gear do in it? I know once I step out there's no going back so being in a warm place for the winter is important.  I have a telecommunications background so I don't really need a phone but I gotta have my laptop.  I'm a bit of a gadget guy but I also like being able to make my own gear.  I'm pretty sure I could build everything I needed given enough time.  Except for a few obvious electronic things.   I have read everything in the side bar (and downloaded most of it) here and in all the subs that seemed appropriate.  Watched Ali the YouTube videos i could find and if anything I'm over thinking it (which is common for me)  What kind of dog? Does the dog help or hinder getting rides? How old are you? Anyway, I appreciate you putting up with me.  I'm a 44 year old wanna be,  but wandering was what I used to dream about when I was a kid.

You need to find people who already know how to catch out, and get them to teach you.  You can't learn it from a book, although there are a few good books about trainhopping out there.  Google up ""How to Hop Trains in North America,"" by Duffy Littlejohn.  Read it cover-to-cover about two or three times, then start practicing the lifestyle doing some camping.  Once you know, through ""urban camping"" stuff, that you can survive, start seriously looking for trainhoppers.  What you want is an experienced, veteran tramp, not a new guy, if you can find one.  Stretch Wilson used to take people out kind of like a trainhopping ""guide,"" but I heard he's retired from the rails.  Stretch likes a drink, so the new guy bought the beer and supplies and Stretch did all the thinking, kind of a win-win situation.

Most human cases of babesiosis in the U.S. are caused by Babesia microti. Babesia microti is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and is found primarily in the northeast and upper midwest. •Borrelia miyamotoi infection has recently been described as a cause of illness in the U.S. It is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and has a range similar to that of Lyme disease.  •Colorado tick fever is caused by a virus transmitted by the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni). It occurs in the the Rocky Mountain states at elevations of 4,000 to 10,500 feet. •Ehrlichiosis is transmitted to humans by the lone star tick (Ambylomma americanum), found primarily in the southcentral and eastern U.S. •Heartland virus infection has been identified in eight patients in Missouri and Tennessee as of March 2014. Studies suggest that Lone Star ticks may transmit the virus. It is unknown if the virus may be found in other areas of the U.S.  •Lyme disease is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in the northeastern U.S. and upper midwestern U.S. and the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) along the Pacific coast. •Powassan disease is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the groundhog tick (Ixodes cookei). Cases have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region. •Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis is transmitted to humans by the Gulf Coast tick (Amblyomma maculatum). •Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is transmitted by the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), and the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sangunineus) in the U.S. The brown dog tick and other tick species are associated with RMSF in Central and South America. •STARI (Southern tick-associated rash illness) is transmitted via bites from the lone star tick (Ambylomma americanum), found in the southeastern and eastern U.S. •Tickborne relapsing fever (TBRF) is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected soft ticks. TBRF has been reported in 15 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming and is associated with sleeping in rustic cabins and vacation homes. •Tularemia is transmitted to humans by the dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), the wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), and the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). Tularemia occurs throughout the U.S. •364D rickettsiosis (Rickettsia phillipi, proposed) is transmitted to humans by the Pacific Coast tick (Dermacentor occidentalis ticks). This is a new disease that has been found in California.  Diseases cause by LICE:  Intense itching (""pruritus"") and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense itching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the skin. When body lice infestation is long lasting, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become thickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body. This condition is called ""vagabond’s disease."" Body lice are known to transmit disease (epidemic typhus, trench fever, and epidemic relapsing fever)."

vagabond,394q6z,SunsetRoute1970,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"An excerpt from Earth Abides:   Of half a million species of insects only a few dozen were appreciably affected by the demise of man, and the only ones actually threatened with extinction were the three species of the human louse. So ancient, if not honorable, was this association that it had even been used as an argument for the single origin of man, anthropologists noting that all isolated tribes scratched and picked at the same parasites and therefore inferring that the original ape-men must have carried the original insect-ancestors outward with them from their point of dispersal.  Since that first departure, throughout hundreds of millennia, the lice had adjusted their life nicely to their world, which was the body of man. They existed as three tribes, taking as their domains, respectively, the head, the clothing, and the private parts. Thus, in spite of racial differences, they amicably maintained a tripartite balance of power, setting for their host an example which he might well have followed. At the same time, becoming so exactly adapted to man, they lost the capacity of existing upon any other host.  The overthrow of man was therefore their overthrow. Feeling their world growing cold, they crawled off in search of some new warm world to inhabit, found none, and died. Billions perished most miserably. At the funeral of Homo sapiens there will be few mourners. Canis familiaris as an individual will perhaps send up a few howls, but as a species, remembering all the kicks and curses, he will soon be comforted and run off to join his wild fellows. Homo sapiens, however, may take comfort from the thought that at his funeral there will be three wholly sincere mourners.     ... the demise of the louse, however, would bring about a grand celebration the likes of which had only been witnessed once - which was during an all you can eat buffet of liver & onions provided free of charge by The Great Hunt, of the Unseelie Courts.  The Restaurant at the end of the Universe provided both venue and free soda or tea as compliment and enticement to the aforementioned buffet.

Lost your job, don't have money for food because you've been paying it etc.   They should give you a discount and lower the payments to next to nothing. They are genuinely pretty helpful.  If you dont have money to pay, they can't do anything to you. If you have money and refuse to pay you can go to prison for 3 months."

The only debt they can jail you for here is unpaid Federal income taxes (and it has to be a lot) or unpaid child support payments.  Texas has no garnishee laws whatsoever.  If you loan somebody money here, and they don't pay you back, there's not much you can do.  Taking deadbeats to court is pointless.  If they had any money, they wouldn't be deadbeats to start with.  Banks and loan companies will try to jack with your credit.  Big deal.  I don't want any credit to begin with.  I LIVE DEBT FREE.  If I can't pay cash, I can't afford it."

However cops in small towns will go much further, such as asking to search your bags, or straight up kicking you out of their town or county. Small town cops are bored as fuck,  and the only experience they have with hobos are from shitty horror movies or urban legends. They don't want ""our kind"" in their area, and they will harass you to the point that you'll leave whether you want to or not."

(I was in the Marine Corps, about to be shipped overseas that August to Okinawa.)  She was absolutely furious about getting fired, mad as hell, and I was trying to calm her down.  I said, ""Let's look at this as an opportunity.  You've got severance pay, so you can take your time looking for a job.  So, if you could do ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO DO, what would it be?"" She thought about it for a second and said, ""I've always wanted to be a merchant sailor in the merchant marine.""  I was pretty much astounded, but wanting to be supportive, I said, ""Well, hon, if that's what you want to do, you go right down there and sign up with the National Maritime Union.""  It's a Catch-22 situation.  You can't get your union card unless you have a Coast Guard Z-Card.  You can't get a Z-card unless you have a job on a ship.  You can't get a job on a ship unless you are in the N.M.U.  (Whew! I thought.  She has like zero chance of shipping out.)  I drastically underestimated how stubborn my girlfriend was. She went down to the N.M.U. hall in San Pedro, CA EVERY FUCKING DAY FOR SIX MONTHS.  She played dominoes with the old guys.  She brought the union office staff home-baked cookies.  She passed out leaflets for the Democratic Party in shitty neighborhoods door-to-door, for the union.  Finally after seven months, one of the old guys took pity on her and threw down on a job in the twice-daily shape-up (of course he got it, he had a very low card number, indicating a very senior member of the union) and then called in sick at the last minute.  The hall was empty, except for my girlfriend, ready to go to work.  The business agent says, ""I've got this job as a steward utility.  Anybody want it?""  She stands up and says, ""I do.  I'll go!""  When the union rep showed up on the ship to ""wish her good fortune on her first trip,"" she slipped him ten $100 bills, rolled up with a rubber band around it, as she had been instructed to do.  She shipped out on that boat for seven and a half months, and banked about $65,000 (a freaking fortune in 1979.)  Then she had five months of Unemployment benefits coming before she needed to ship out again.  Her first trip was on the second-largest crude-oil supertanker in the world.  Her second ship was a stretched WWII Liberty ship gasoline tanker which was a disgusting tub.  After a couple of years shipping out, dealing with all the assholes and creeps that are merchant seamen, she finally stopped going to sea.  While she was shipping out, I was stuck on Okinawa, pissed off that I was stuck there. It's not impossible to ship out.  But it is a scummy, corrupt, shitty life.  As my wife says, ""It's like being in prison, only with the possibility of drowning.""  She carried a Gerber Mark II combat knife in the back of her pants every second she was on those ships."

vagabond,38vaas,031619832,11,Sun Jun 7 03:14:50 2015 UTC,"The main objective when you are rolling out in a city or town is to not be seen by anybody.  It's unlikely that you would have many problems from regular citizens in a small town trying to rob you or attack you in some way, but they generally don't like outsiders who don't follow the regular rules of life.  They feel threatened by anybody who is a ""transient,"" i.e. a person who is unaccountable to the community.  Small town people will call the cops on you in a heartbeat if you have an unconventional appearance, so your objective is to conceal your campsite.  A grove of trees, a bunch of bushes, a spot behind some kind of industrial building, under a railroad overpass, etc. is probably best. In the big city (Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, etc.) there are going to be tons of ""homeless"" people.  You don't want to be in neighborhoods where they congregate.  First of all, the local straight citizens are sick to death of them hanging out, ""spang""ing everybody and generally being present and having endless unmet needs.  A huge percentage of homeless people are mentally ill.  Spend five minutes with them and you'll understand what I'm talking about.  Plus, if you have any assets (money, a credit card, a camera, a cell phone, an iPhone, whatever) you definitely do not want to let them know.  The life of druggies/alcoholics revolves around generating serious money every day to feed their habit.  From their point of view, EVERYTHING is secondary to them getting their fix, including you and whatever resources you may have.  The entire world revolves around getting that bottle of whisky or that crack rock.  If they have to rip you off to get it, ""oh well."" You want to find a place to crash that these people do not frequent.  This isn't easy to do, because they know every hidey-hole in the neighborhood.  Best choice: get away from ""homeless support services"" areas--Salvation Army facilities, St. Vincent de Paul, SHAPE, Loaves and Fishes--any place that homeless people congregate.  The area all around these support services area will be ""tramped out.""  The local people around there will have major compassion fatigue and the cops will be intolerant.  Keep going until you get clear of Skid Row. Avoid ""ghetto"" areas like the plague.  It's a dog-eat-dog world, and certain ghetto dwellers will see a traveler as an easy score.  I have successfully crashed in large city parks, but predators prowl these parks for the same reason I went there--cover and concealment.  I have also slept on rooftops of small buildings (large buildings have security) and in unlocked parked cars (lock the doors when you get inside.)  In San Francisco, people often leave their car doors unlocked and a little 3x5 card sign taped to the passenger side window that says ""Please don't break my windows.""  (You almost never see a nice car in San Francisco that has a radio still in the dash.  The thugs break the window and steal the radio while the car is parked on the street.) Meeting somebody who will let you sleep on their couch would probably be the best solution for young people in a large city, but be aware that a lot of creeps have ulterior motives.  (Older tramps virtually never get invited to couch surf.)  Travelling girls and young, attractive boys get hit on constantly by creeps.  The main thing you are trying to accomplish is finding a safe, concealed spot to sleep.  I never feel safe in a big city, but that's probably just me.  I have known so many people that got robbed, ripped off, raped, sexually harassed, threatened and bullied in cities that I do my best to avoid them altogether."

Talk to everyone, and be prepared to haggle.  -------And never sell yourself short. If you're in a place where haggling is happening often, maybe raise your asking by by $20 and expect to come down to your original asking price. Keep aware of cops/security. --------Ever have the cops confiscate steal your stuff? Shit sucks. There also a good chance you'll never get it back.  Speaking of cops, make sure it's easy and quick to pack up your setup.  Never sell yourself short.  Smile, even if it's fake as hell. Nobody wants to talk to an unhappy face. Be attentive.

vagabond,38qg9l,Frightened_Peasant,2,Fri Jun 5 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"Don't take what I'm going to say as gospel, I'm only going by what I was told at the interview and I'm going to Sitka, not Valdez.   I was told Salmon season starts very soon and it is their busiest time of year.  He advised us to expect sixteen hour days every day. My living arrangements and yours will probably be quite different so I won't go into that.  I slightly suspect he might have been exaggerating a little to frighten off people who would chicken out midway through the season, but I wouldn't bet on it.  Pay for someone with no experience starts at 10 dollars an hour with all the usual overtime rules applying."
vagabond,38qg9l,Frightened_Peasant,2,Sat Jun 6 21:58:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know about that, I was just hoping to find out how much we would make by the end of the contract season. Like do you get hit like a truck by taxes? Because with 16 hours/day at $10/hour with overtime and double time laws, you would make about $220/day before tax, and $1540/week. So after 2.5months that is $15,400 before taxes. I just want to make sure we aren't going to be shorted because I heard some people on Youtube and stuff complaining about working an entire season and only leaving with $5,000.  I have worked 20 hours/day 7 days a week with only 4 hours off every 24 hours before, so this 16 hours a day is simple. And it is just for 2.5 months which is easy to power through.  I wanted to know like what kind of places we would be staying in, because some people said Valdez does tents, where you sleep outside, and some say it is like a hotel, and some said it is like cots in the backroom.  I am 100% fine with any of the options as I have been homeless for the past few months and without money so anything is better than nothing. Valdez is also colder than the rest of the plants which is why we start a little later I believe. I just want to be prepared for what to expect when I get there. That way I can be like ""Alright so far everything seems legit"" and I don't get caught off guard or scammed."
vagabond,38qg9l,Frightened_Peasant,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about double time laws.  As far as I know we get time and a half for everything worked after 40 a week.  I don't know who you have been talking to, but I know Silverbay pays better than most places and season length can vary considerably.  One of the smaller plants I looked at had a season that only lasted a month.    I got the impression that these plants operate most of the year for different fishing seasons, the guy I interviewed with is a former processor who worked for Silver bay 7 months of the year as a processor.  Taxes are going to depend on how much you made at other jobs over the past year.  If you've been unemployed all year then you'll probably get back most or all of what was deducted from your pay.  I'm pretty sure 15,000 minus the standard deduction is well below the poverty line."
vagabond,38qg9l,JonnYWalkerWhite,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:42:24 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry was thinking of California, if you have to work over 12 hours it is double time, but yeah still without double time it is still $200/day.  The law states that Alaska must pay overtime after 8 hours per work day. http://www.legalandrew.com/2008/09/08/overtime-laws-your-right-to-overtime-pay/  They can tell you ""It is after a 40 hour work week"" but that isn't 100% true, if at any time you work more than 8 hours in a single 24 hour day, you must be paid overtime. The 40 hours a week goes towards if you work 7 days a week but each day is 8 hours long, you don't get overtime until the 40 hours has been passed, but we will get overtime for 8 hours everyday.  The guy I interviewed with is the manager of the Valdez plant and he said they are going from end of June to approx end of August, and possibly a little later than that if the fish are still coming. I would love a bunch of months to work because that just means more money, but the Valdez manager said min 2.5 months max 3.5 months.  But yeah if you see your check and they didn't pay you atleast 72 hours of overtime then you need to contact the labor board or their HR because they are scamming you. They can say whatever they want about how ""we don't have to pay you until the 40 hours is up in the week for overtime"" but the law for Alaska states anything over 8 hours in a day.  http://labor.alaska.gov/lss/whact.htm  That is the Alaskan government labor website  it states this: Payment for Overtime - An employer may not employ an employee for a workweek longer than 40 hours or for more than eight hours in a day. Should an employer find it necessary to employ an employee in excess of these standards, compensation for such overtime shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half times the regular rate of pay."

Is the waterproof jacket a lightweight one? I wouldn't bother with  Goretex or anything like that this time of year a tiny thin rain jacket is fine.  Have you got a photo of your key? The american ones might not work, most the bins here open easily with pliers they're on a spring once you've done it once its easy. Triangle shaped locks. Some have the square ones.  Tarp, bivy, foil blanket and 2 bin bags, for me bring the bin and bivy leave the rest. It's not gonna be cold for a while and unless you're staying one place a long time or there's more than one of you a tarp is dead weight.  Trowel you can use a stick or rock or your hands.  Quick dry trowel Id use another poly cotton T-shirt more uses but does the same thing.  I hate those platypus things because they leak but yours might be good I just don't trust them in a bag with all my stuff.  What do you use masking tape for? Duct tape or electric tape is usually more useful unless you have a specific use.  It's a good list, you can always get rid of things as you go and some of my suggestions won't suit you but it's always better to start off with room to spare. That's not really that heavy if it includes the 2kgs of food and 2kgs of water if you ditched the tarp and hoody it'd probably be a couple kilos less?  Also bring a sewing kit.. And that's a lot of rope!"
vagabond,38oje6,Jim1o1t,2,Fri Jun 5 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for points! Don't really know how long I'll be there; probably about a month.  Waterproof jacket is a light weight piece of shit one I've had for over ten years (I wore it when I was about 8 and it was huge). Does the job though, y'know.  I checked my key thing with some people I know who do dumpstering sometimes, it works for the ""new"" locks but not the older ones. If I don't use it I'll just ditch it on the way for someone else to use.  There are three of us travelling together for the 1st leg of the journey. I was going to ditch the tarp but it might be quite good for us to sit under as a group. If I'm on my own I'm gonna ditch it or stash it though.  Trowel seemed like a waste of space, yeah. I bought it a while ago and haven't used it so thought I'd bring it to get some use on it. Oh well, a wasted £5 hah.  Good idea with the t-shirt/towel thing! Will do this.  Platypus thing seems quite sturdy, if it's not though I'm happy to just go with 1L  water and find something better on the way.  Masking tape was a typo, meant to put duct tape. Always get them mixed up. Using it for repairs and stuff.  Sewing kit is in FA kit for some reason, wouldn't really go anywhere else without it falling to the bottom of my bag and getting lost.

vagabond,38oje6,boxmole,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"From another post;  I suggest a bivi is better than a tarp, and a tent. You can be enclosed in it, like a tent, it doesn't take much space and is easy to hide. If its hot you can sleep in it without a sleeping bag or sleep on top of it in your sleeping bag. If its cold it adds a few degrees to your sleeping bag rating. Its as light as a hammock, but you can sleep wherever, packs and weighs smaller and less than a tent but still fully waterproof. A tarp can be difficult to rig up some places so a lot of people end up rolling up in them basically a second rate bivy that's not enclosed not as breathable warm or comfortable and make annoying noises. You need a ground sheet if it rains with a tarp. You are still in the open. Lots of bivis have bug nets."
vagabond,38oje6,Jim1o1t,2,Fri Jun 19 06:26:39 2015 UTC,"Fold up trowel (tiny shovel) - Tell me more about this piece. How much does it weigh and what do you intend to use it for? These are generally junk because they warp and break with little use and a fixed handle garden trowel will usually serve you just as well and be more concealable. That or drop it altogether.  Have you considered getting a digital version of your book on your phone?  I would also swap out one pair of underwear(I suggest wicking boxer briefs) for 2 more pairs of thin socks.  I would consider swapping out the metal flask and tatonka flasks for a food jar  (like this: http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00408LQN8 ) that you can still use for water but are easier to clean and will keep hot food hot and cold food cold if you want to. A couple bottles of powerade or gatorade I'd refill with water will beat pretty much everything else for carrying water.  I don't notice a camp cooking pot or anything, is that an omission?  Some cologne in a sturdy plastic bottle or spray can would also be wise along with baby wipes in a resealable container you can use to wipe your pits and crotch down with if you don't have access to a shower. Travel size shampoo and deodorant(or talc powder if you are sensitive to deodorant chemicals). A sewing kit with heavy thread and good needles bought from a big box store and then pre-thread the needles- all in a small hard case."

I would get a digital version but I've got an old school phone :/  Good point on underwear/socks. And will look into those flask things, seems like a multi-use thing, which could save space/weight. Don't have a cooking pot (at least not a sizeable one), plan was to use tatonka flasks for this: not really a flask, more like a mess tin.. but mug shaped.. if that makes sense?  Baby wipes is a good idea, lightweight too. Might not bring cologne though, I was thinking of just walking into a store and using their free samples they always leave out..?

This is probably because heat is insulated OUT of these insulated containers as well as it is insulated IN. In addition, the insulator is usually flammable styrofoam.

vagabond,38iyv7,1stCitizen,9,Fri Jun 5 06:22:54 2015 UTC,"I advise you to try out the lifestyle and practice the necessary skills BEFORE you leave home.  Go camping.  Learn how to dumpster dive, go fly a sign and see if you can make a buck.  Put together your gear and then go hump it all over your city.  Go watch trains, learn how they do what they do and why they do it.  Practice the lifestyle for a weekend.  Then try it for a week.   Learn to cook on an open fire, learn how to make , say, TEN simple meals.  Learn how to get water without buying it.  Buy a sillcock key and go around the city finding places where you can turn on sillcocks to get water.  Measure the valve stem nut on a fire hydrant and find out what size crescent wrench you need to turn one on.  Living on the street is a set of skills that anybody can learn.  Learn those skills before you actually leave home."

Finish high school first, and then figure out what you want to do. You'll have a much stronger hand if you graduate, even in regards to vagabonding.  And stop fucking using, since you're clearly terrible at it. 4 stints in rehab before the age of 18 is kind of pathetic.  You're almost an adult, and I know that can be an extremely stressful time.

vagabond,38lmjy,gtbuzzed,6,Fri Jun 5 00:52:49 2015 UTC,"It is extremely difficult to get a job without at least a high school diploma.  If you can handle working and going to school, try to get a 20-hrs-a-week job just so you'll have some life/work experience.  I made a living for my family for 14 years with nothing but a high-school diploma.  It was hard as fuck.  I went back to school at age 36 and got a degree as a machinist.  It was better, but still very hard.  Then I went to nursing school when I was 43.  It was like hitting the Lotto.  It took ten years for my wife and I to pay off our student loans.  It wasn't easy, but we managed to do it.  Now I'm about to retire after working twenty years as a nurse.  My advice--FINISH HIGH SCHOOL.  Take a little time to enjoy life and get some life experience, but don't wait too long.  Then go to a community college, knock out the first two years of a four-year degree at a more affordable school, then finish off your bachelor's degree at a four-year state university if you can.  Dropping out would be a huge mistake.  When you go to college, DO NOT pursue some bullshit degree like political science or art history.  These kinds of degrees are worthless.  You want a degree in something SALABLE TO THE MARKET.  Computers, engineering, healthcare, etc.  A trade school education is good too, if you don't want to go to university.  I know someone who makes a good living selling and repairing small, hobby drone aircraft.  There's a lot of ways to skin a cat.  I know you want to be independent, to be an adult.  Well, start by making adult decisions right now.  Dropping out is irrational and childish.  You are living rent-free with no expenses.  USE THAT SUPPORT to prepare for adult life."

Not having vaguely clean dishes for yourself is a decent way to get an unhappy digestive system.

Riding trains, if you do it correctly, is about as dangerous as riding in the bed of a pickup truck.   The problem is the people who hop trains who have an ""ANYTHING is just A-Okay!"" attitude.  Their behavior is like the behavior of a deranged person.  They try to catch out drunk or high, or both.  They completely ignore even the most rudimentary safety rules.   They get into all sorts of bullshit drama conflict with people they barely know. They behave like lunatics.  Their judgment is TERRIBLE.  They take all kinds of really stupid risks.

We lived in our school's jurisdiction, but the buses didn't come to our neighborhood.  We had almost no practice but we needed transportation so one day we picked a moment and tried jumping.  Luckily, we all made it without something bad happening, though that can't be said for the departure.  It was nothing too serious, though, mostly just some scrapes, cuts, and sore limbs.  Since it was the first time and we thought it went well, we tried again with better results.  We eventually got used to it and forgot the risk, my friend's worst mistake by far.  We were getting off one day and my friend took a bad jump.  His leg got caught in some rock and ended up snapping his ankle.  To this day you can still see the limp when he walks.  I haven't thought of trying again since.  I can't stress this enough, a teenager should not be jumping trains.  You should wait a few years and get some form of traveling experience under your belt.  Than, if you think your ready to train hop, try to find someone with experience to help you, because it's a sharp learning curve, with or without a guide."

vagabond,38h7fl,Jim1o1t,2,Fri Jun 5 13:18:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not a vagabond, but I know a bit about cold temperatures, since i trek the Alps often.  The first thing you need to know, is that if you're planning to sleep, you need to have at least 4 inches of insulating material between you and the ground. It can be dead leaves or Styrofoam depending on  your location. And as everyone said, a good sleeping bag is a must.  Also, always remember that when you build a fire you want three things: a fire that is as long as you lying on the ground, a good fire wall to redirect the heat towards you, and a solid back wall to contain the heat you receive.  Never get wet. Remember that only 100% wool will keep its insulating properties when wet.  You want to dress in layers, with a skin-tight layer as underwear and then loose clothes to form air sockets that keep you insulated. Spend good money on a good coat.  Wear a hat and cover you ears. It will prevent a lot of illnesses. If you need and extra layer to shield you from the wind, newspapers are great for that.  Try not to drink freezing water.  Keep moving. Moving keeps you warm. If you feel very cold, bend your spine like as if you were bowing, and the rotate your arms, It will bring blood where it is needed.  Try to eat highly caloric foods and fatty foods.

Don't drink hardcore or get into hard drugs. Be smart, really. Don't take handouts you don't need and clean your fucking campsite. There you go"

Unless you plan on going on a magical fantasy journey with a wizard guide and a pack of dwarves. I'm sure you have all the ability you need to find what your looking for. That's where you should start actually. Its good to ask questions but try to gain some independent understanding as well.

I think what these guys may be hinting at is that ""vagabonds"" by default are independent and take the initiative for anything they may need. By asking and expecting to have the answers given to you - when all it takes is some effort on your part - when it's been compiled already, makes it seem like you are an entitled brat. Sorry.  Nobody is refusing to help you but if the food is in front of you, should others feed it to you so you may decide if it way tasty or not? It's not a matter of kindness but I agree some of the answers may have been a bit harsh. But that's why you travel to learn, and grow.   Put in an effort, meet people halfway, and they'll be glad to help:)"

Not so that people could tell me to go spend two hours doing the research myself.  Entitled brat? No, I just expect people who don't have anything useful or nice to say to not be rude and waste my time. I think asking a few simple questions and wanting an answer from people who know the answer isn't too far of a stretch.  I'm not asking because I want to become a vagabond, I'm asking out of curiosity. To automatically assume I'm going to dedicate myself to a lifestyle I know nothing about is kind of ridiculous.  Sure, I'd be happy to be directed to a specific resource, but telling me to go check out the sidebar is, well, unhelpful to say the least. But it's nice to know I have to prove myself to this subreddit, even if I think that's a pretty inefficient idea."

I don't know what experience you have with hunting (I'm assuming that's what the gun would be for), but if you haven't done it before I would strongly recommend getting some experience before putting yourself in any situation where you'll depend on it.  Trapping/fishing/foraging are a lot easier in my opinion, so I would put a higher emphasis on developing those skills if you want to source food from nature.  On a side note, I prefer tarps over tents. They're cheaper, lighter, take up less space, and are more durable/adaptable than tents.  Not nearly as good at keeping critters out/insulating heat which might be an issue depending on where/when you go, but the advantages usually outweigh that in my opinion."

If you get arrested with any type of firearm on a train, it turns a simple trespassing ticket into a ""criminal trespassing"" felony arrest.  Guns for a backwoods dweller are great.  Not so much for a traveler.  I recommend two things:  join a martial arts school and LEARN HOW TO FIGHT, and if you are going to carry a weapon, make it a legal-length sheath knife.  Then learn how to fight with it.  These are not casual suggestions.  They both require serious commitment."

vagabond,382ox9,OddGoldfish,6,Mon Jun 1 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"Id try a wind up headlamp! I couldn't go back to a flashlight though. My batteries last a while, around 2+ months, but they are kinda wasteful. Rechargeable headlamp with a phone charger socket would be good providing it lasted as long. I don't fish because I feel evil killing them. I stopped eating meat too, I mean I'd never buy it anyway but I don't really feel right eating it anymore either"
vagabond,382ox9,JustCallMeEro,5,Mon Jun 1 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"I don't fish because I feel evil killing them.     Ah. Yeah, I didn't think a well thought out pack would inadvertently omit a fishing kit without good reason. As far as a wind-up headlamp? I didn't even think they make those or didn't think of extending it to that! My wind-up radio has a usb port which I wasn't even expecting nor its solar panel atop, which brings me to another pertinent suggestion. There are companies (like Eboot) that make portable solar chargers that can cling to your pack to charge, store the charge (I believe), and is water-resistant. That's my next purchase as I've become jaded by searching for holes and now batteries I've noticed are so antiquated in my mind.    My I ask what it is that you do eat?

vagabond,382ox9,Ineedtobe3,2,Mon Jun 1 21:05:55 2015 UTC,"I have a bivy and sleeping bag I really like the simplicity and low profile.   I don't climb with that rope, I guess you could but it's probably not that safe if you fall on it. I like climbing though, trees and onto roofs.   I use it mostly as washing line or to tie my pack up to a tree so no one sees it while I sleep. Plus sometimes it's useful hanging your pack on a tree just to get to stuff easier and not have it on the ground. I put a loop on my bivi so if I'm under a tree I can put a bit of rope through and it pulls the material up makes it feel roomier. I'd trust the rope enough to  rappel a short way but haven't had the opportunity. I don't think I'd have enough to make a half decent harness and have much left over as climbing rope. So I mostly use it for boring stuff.  High five back, I watched this film that tore my heart out even thinking about it."

I work day labour type jobs as well and do odd jobs for money, I just finished fencing a vegetable farm in Italy.    You have to be really careful with knifes, if I'm in or near a city I put my knife and multitool at the bottom of my pack. In the country I'll have it on my belt but hidden in a pocket and working or camping it's fine to have it. I've never had trouble from it but I'm always in mainland Europe in the UK I think carrying it even in a pack unaccessible can land you in jail for the night with a court date. Most countries are realistic and reasonable."
vagabond,382ox9,OhMyGoat,3,Tue Jun 2 10:52:06 2015 UTC,"I'm from the UK, and the laws and kind of confusing.  Don't quote me on this, but you MIGHT get away carrying that sort of knife in an inaccessible place if you're carrying all your camping gear, but all depends if the police officer wants to arrest you or not I imagine :(  Also do you find jobs online or just by asking face to face?  Where are you from originally?"
vagabond,382ox9,i_only_troll_idiots,2,Tue Jun 2 12:28:34 2015 UTC,"UK knife laws seem intense, a friend of mine was arrested and ended up with a record and doing community work as a punishment for carrying a locking knife. Apparently his lawyer told him he was lucky!! Maybe in the countryside its more acceptable, you can't imagine that no one uses a knife outside their home.  I find jobs just by asking people. I don't think the internet is great for finding work because people don't take it so seriously here and in most of Europe its not used for as much as the UK. Things are still quite local, if you want to find something out you have to go to the area and find the right person kind of thing.  Im from ireland originally."

Do vagabonds/hitchhikers get offended or upset when someone doesn't pick them up, or is there an understanding that people who can pick them up and want to, will? I pick up hitchhikers when I can, but I am an open-hearted yet safety-mindful female often traveling solo or with my young daughter, and often on my way somewhere specific in town. In these instances, when I have to get on the highway and pass by hitchhikers, I feel that I've disappointed them by passing them by, and it breaks my heart a bit. It seems you were offended that Jason Aldean didn't pick you up, though you could be joking...what's your take on all this?"

It's always fun to poke at shitty celebrities though, and I think that was OP's intention. No one expects a mega-celebrity-douchebag in a tour bus to actually stop and pick them up.

My husband and I often pick up hitchhikers, and we also open our home to couch surfers and airbnb guests. When we talk to friends and family about our experiences, there is often some shock that we could be so trusting of strangers - it seems like the mentality is that strangers=danger! It doesn't help that we are in the American South, which is one of the most guarded places in that regard that we've been. It's really sad - I wish people understood that most people are good, kind, open people. The overwhelming amount of people on earth do not want to murder you. Or rob you. Or rape you. Or whatever people are so afraid of."
vagabond,380nm3,canibuyatrowel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:35:18 2015 UTC,I'm sure that most hitch hikers are cool fascinating harmless people.. But the one time I picked someone up they mugged me as I was dropping them off.
vagabond,380nm3,hannnnaah,5,Fri Jun 5 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"I was sort of worried someone would take this post that way but no, I'm not offended at all, even though I had my mandolin out and we could have been friends!  It's easy to get bitter when hitchhiking. Sometimes hundreds or thousands of cars will drive by before you catch a ride. Empty cars going right where you need to be. It doesn't matter if it's raining, snowing, freezing or 100F +  It's just something you've got to prepare yourself for and I'm thankful for every ride I get.   Thank you for being open minded and keep being careful"
vagabond,380nm3,canibuyatrowel,3,Mon Jun 1 04:42:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured you didn't mean it that way - it just allowed me to ask this question I've been wondering for a while. There have been a few times that I've passed a hitchhiker when it's really hot (South Carolina here) or raining like crazy, but I have to be at a doctor's appointment at the next exit in 5 minutes, that sort of thing. I always wish I could help in some way, hate passing them and not being able to help,  and so I just focus on hoping they get picked up soon. It's crazy how people are driving these completely empty boxes for miles and miles and they won't stop to take someone exactly where they're going. I hope you have safe and easy travels henceforth!"

Also, people assume that serial killers are less likely to be playing guitar while hitching (i don't know if this assumption is true or not). People just give you a waaay less ""omg, danger!""-vibe when you're a traveling musician vs. drifter in so many situations... Another note, I recommend no case or cloth-case (and a back up trash bag for rains). This way you always have it handy and can play while walking or standing by an on-ramp....     also... semi-permanently affix your strap to the guitar... like with duct tape...        . .p.s.go.for.happier/prettier.guitar.decorations"

By the end of the first month, I was as familiar with the weight and bulk with the guitar as I was my pack.   As far as slowing you down concern, it will actually speed up the process. An easy 3/4 of my rides began with ""I saw the guitar case and..."" Only advice I have is to make the case noticeable. Prop it up against the pack with the body facing oncoming traffic. It's also cool to use for shade for your water so you don't have to drink lava.   Also, bring something extra to cover the case in case of rain. I used an extra poncho I had, some use trash bags or oversized dry sacks.   Just bring it. Soooo many good times will be born from it, I can assure ya.

vagabond,37v1ls,blanky1,5,Sat May 30 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"well, have you ever gotten the urge to run or walk around in the woods or in grass? try it barefoot nexttime. The only reason you have soft baby feet, like everyone lol is cause we're all wearing shoes everywhere all the time. . They may be soft now but they'll build up proper resistance like you hands have now compared to someone who wears gloves 12+ hours a day everyday.  some things I found really compelling were those switching over to being unshod (without shoes) immediately stopped heal striking (if they were) because they could finally feel how painful and unaligned with their natural structure it was. Runners stopped getting shin splints, people gained better balance. & those who go barefoot more often than not generally have bigger calves from the ""correct"" posture, which in essence are like springs that propel you easily on your way....  here is one of the better articles written on the topic,  http://theeasynomad.blogspot.com/p/footwear.html    /r/barefoot/    /r/BarefootRunning/"

I dont know why he said in the woods, which have rocks and other things that are uncomfortable to walk on, but in the city concrete exfoliates your feet, and gives your socks a chance to dry out.

Personally I hate jeans when camping (or anything cotton), and instead of swim shorts and hiking pants have you considered zip offs? (or w/e they are called).  Maybe something to sleep in, I have a day (wet, dirty, anything goes) & night (cooking, sleeping, lounging)   I have a wood burning stove too (Vargo), but I hate it.  Being on the Wet West coast, dry wood isn't always available.  I've switched to a penny can stove and I use the vargo as support / windscreen.  I've never had a use for a machete, other than random bush fuckery, my folding saw has always done the trick.  Not to mention it might not be legal to carry when in town and you might get unwanted attention from the 5-0.   Lastly can you tell me what the name of your solar shower is?  I've considered getting one, but the weight / functionality has always turned me away from them.  Just a few items I carry that don't weight a lot or take up a lot space - compass, mirror, bug mesh hat (I got all those from amazon for $5 or less), 1st aid kit (I carry a few band aids & single use super glue, tweezers), sewing needle & floss, head lamp, ferro rod.

vagabond,37pg18,homeboy422,4,Fri May 29 10:56:24 2015 UTC,"I have had quite a few encounters with railroad special agents over the years, and only once was I ever physically harmed, and that was in Pocatello, Idaho, where the ""bull school"" was located.  I was twenty years old and I tried to outrun the bull.  He caught me at a fence and as I was going over the fence he hit me a couple of good licks with his stick, but I still got away. I discovered that treating cops with respect goes a long way towards getting you out of trouble.  The bulls don't really want to work any harder than they must.  They hate filling out paperwork, so if you are respectful, address him as ""Officer,"" and ""sir,"" your chances of getting released with a lecture are pretty good.  Calling a railroad bull disrespectful names and acting contemptuous is a really bad idea.  There is nobody out there but you and him.  If he decides to beat you black and blue and then claim you attacked him, who is going to deny it?  Treat everybody who works for the railroad, including bulls, with respect.  Don't drink or smoke pot in a yard or before you catch out.  Behave like somebody with some sense.  Dressing and behaving like somebody who hates society and has no regard for rules, law or common decency is not a good tact to take with a railroad cop.  Most cops are pretty straight arrows (not all of course.)  Most cops are very conservative, usually patriotic, often military veterans, and are inclined to let you walk if they can.  But if you are communicating ""FUCK SOCIETY AND ALL YOUR FUCKING RULES"" by your appearance and demeanor, don't be surprised if the cops take you at your word, and do their best to lock you up for as long as possible.  In other words, don't antagonize The Man unnecessarily.  Don't give him any reason to WANT to jack you up.  Be polite, apologize, act contrite, then come back later when he's not there and catch your train."

Besides most states require no tresspassing signs to be visable in order to charge you with tresspassing.
vagabond,37pg18,JimboJimWV,1 point,Fri May 29 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"Most bulls don't have hobos on the top of their priority list, to be honest with you.   The railroads top priority when it comes to yard security are these two things: Safety & Security. And both of these boil down to $$$.  For safety, the railroad is concerned about deaths/violence. Over 90% of train-related deaths are local pedestrian deaths or worker-related accidents. These are NOT hobos. The railroad company is well-aware of this, as they have done multiple statistical reports about this.   For security, they are worried about thieves and vandals. Gangs and tweakers will raid rail yards at night looking for scrap metal and steel to pawn, tools to steal, etc etc. On the otherhand, vandals will come in, damage equipment, tag graffiti, etc. Once again, these are NOT hobos.  The railroads corporate concern with safety/security is pretty obvious: It all boils down to MONEY.  Local deaths cause bad business relations and local tension with the company. Worker deaths cause shit tons of insurance payments and possible lawsuits. Also, over 60% of deaths in trainyards are murder or suicide, and this sort of stuff gets in the media and causes really bad PR. If there's one thing the railroad cares about most, it's $$$.  Likewise, the concern with gangs, thieves, and vandals, once again, boils down to $$$:  Railroads spends several million dollars a year covering up graffiti, repairing vandalized equipment, insuring stolen goods, etc. Railroad companies are pinching pennies these days thanks to the trucking industry, and unnecessary repair costs is a major concern on their quarterly reports.  Railroad companies know hobos are just going in and getting out without trying to cause any fuss. Just a small mouse that darts in during the night and is never seen again. They also know that most of us know a SHIT TON about the rails, and we know how to do it safely and respectfully. We don't damage equipment or steal crap metal, we are there to simply catch a ride.  They also know that if we end up dead, the media and locals usually don't give a shit or cause any fuss about it because ""hey, it's just another dead bum...an unknown transient""...  Hobo's don't cause any damage, loss of profit, or bad PR, and that's why most railroads don't focus much attention on us."

I've had them give me kickdowns of weed, money, food, etc, and had a few come back and hang out with us at camp.  I've always sort of considered them our brothers in arms.

vagabond,37rgth,SunsetRoute1970,4,Fri May 29 20:24:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I absolutely do not agree with this statement.  If I want to live out-of-doors, that is my right.  If I want to buy a piece of land, that is also my right.  Once I own a piece of land, it becomes my property, just like my ruck or my bindle or my truck or anything else that I own.  I have a right to use my property and to control its use by others.  If I own a house and I am willing to allow someone else to rent or lease it, we make a contract.  A contract is a promise, a promise which is enforceable by law, because society cannot function without people being able to trust that when an agreement is made, both parties will abide by it.  The only other alternative is brute anarchy, in which the strongest, most powerful person wins.  So I rent out my unused house to a renter.  He agrees to pay me a certain amount of rent per month.  If he uses my property without paying me, it is the same thing as him putting a gun in my ribs and taking money out of my wallet.  If he doesn't want to pay rent, he can move out and live out-of-doors.  I have certainly done that very thing plenty of times in my life.  There is nothing to stop the renter from working, saving up his money, and buying his OWN piece of property.  And if he doesn't need it right now, he can rent it out to somebody else.  When these two pitch their tent somewhere and come back and find it (and all their stuff) being occupied by somebody else, then I want to hear them say ""Fuck the landlord, use his property however you want, he can't do anything about it.""

The pictures are really awesome, but it's a pretty misleading title, particularly for /r/vagabond.  The title of your post suggested that it was a picture of a vagabond being fed and housed by a local South American family, but the link simply leads to random pictures of conventional backpacking. I would honestly suggest you try another subreddit, but it seems that you have already submitted this link to every travel-related subreddit on Reddit already. Spam, much?  If you want to promote your traveling blog, we totally allow that at /r/vagabond and encourage all travelers to share their blogs here.

vagabond,37o2yz,huckstah,3,Fri May 29 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"Isn't that an American dog tick though? While they can harbour tularemia and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the Wikipedia article on them says that they aren't viable Lyme vectors for humans. I think that the ticks that give you those are the deer ticks, which usually have a dark colouration near their heads and a distinct red band of colour that starts at the end of the thorax. They're also almost completely identical to the black-legged ticks that you can find in coastal Cascadia, which harbour Lyme at a much lesser rate than their eastern cousins."
vagabond,37o2yz,pathofraven,3,Fri May 29 13:23:03 2015 UTC,"To anyone not knowing what it is, it is a certain kind of tick that can cause dangerous diseases like Lymes disease (Borrealis), TBE and Erlichiosis. Definetly read up online to learn how to identify and remove them."

vagabond,37o2yz,tundra72,3,Fri May 29 20:50:35 2015 UTC,"No, no diseases, but I have probably spent a king's ransom on insect repellent over the years.  The best one is DEET, but long term use has some hazards.  Among other things, I blouse the bottom of my trousers, spray Deep Woods Off liberally on boots and bloused trouser legs as well as my hat, the back of the collar of my shirt (if it has a collar) and everywhere that my clothing has an opening. The military has a LOT of experience dealing with the hazards of living out-of-doors.  Generally speaking, their methods of dealing with insects and potentially hazardous insect borne diseases are pretty reliable (if you leave out the massive spraying of encampments with god-awful insecticides.)  Don't forget, Lyme disease and malaria, et al are ""natural and organic.""  Ditto with Yellow fever, cholera, anthrax and etc.  Nature has its ways of naturally limiting the human population, just like it has ways of limiting the jackrabbit, deer, raccoon and coyote populations.  We just don't want to be felled by Lyme disease or Four Corners fever any more than the jackrabbit wants to succumb to the coyote.  The natural world is brutal.  We try to stack the deck in our favor."

I know a total of 7 people who contracted Lyme disease from ticks while living in the state of Florida ..6 were Florida natives and they also said they noticed the tell tale ""bullseye"" marking at the bite site. The 7th person was originally from lyme Connecticut and we believe her hunting dogs she brought with her might have been carrying the tick that infected her. Although, it's believed by most doctors that contracting Lyme disease in Florida is rare, my friends will all tell you from experience that it's more common than most people think. Just my 2 cents."

I can't use the Deet or other ones with toxins, I get pretty sick from them.   Even better, get a little spray bottle and mix lavender oil and tea tree oil with water. I shower in the stuff, as Mosquitos loved to feast on me. It's great for all kinds of insects.   My dog got a tick in her paw. She cried, I nearly fell apart trying to help. This stuff is also good for wound healing. It's antibacterial as well."

vagabond,37o6aq,FoundersDiscount,3,Fri May 29 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"Hitchhiking from L'ville to Sac-town won't take any longer than a week or two if you don't fuck around or get lazy inbetween towns. 2-3 weeks at the very longest, and that's considering that you're being slightly lazy and choosing to spend a couple of days in a few towns along the way. You could hitchhike coast-to-coast several times in 4 months, actually.  Since you have such a loose time-frame, I honestly suggest that you take your time and enjoy every place you go through as much as you can. Spend a week here, a couple days there, a couple weeks here, etc. Go with your heart and your gut.  Remember, the real beauty and best experiences are in the journey itself: all those little random stops along the way between point A and point B, not the destination itself.  Also, DON'T forget the small or medium-sized towns that you have never heard of before, because those places are where some of your BEST experiences and memories will come from. Major cities are all fun and glittery for a few days, but it's the small towns that will really stick with your heart and change your mind the most."

vagabond,37n0gz,justinglasen,3,Thu May 28 22:50:15 2015 UTC,"In terms of difficulty, it doesn't get much harder than Chicago. Chicago is widely considered the mecca of the American rail system. Dozens of large train yards spread all over the entire city, making it really difficult to figure out which rails go where. It's almost impossible to figure out unless you've been doing it for a few years."

vagabond,37n0gz,Perfect_Booty,2,Fri May 29 04:21:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't divulge any secret information to where exactly you should hop out or anything like that. If you hop out anywhere for the first time, do it with an experienced trainhopper. And if you try to do this in Chicago alone as a greenhorn, you'll end up getting on a train that goes the wrong direction 99.9 percent of the time. Chicago is 10/10 level difficult.  Feel free to pick my brain, but I can only give you subtle hints and the rest of the research is up to you."
vagabond,37n0gz,EpicPoptartPuma,1 point,Fri May 29 04:37:20 2015 UTC,the level of  difficulty  is  very  disheartening.  I  get  stopped  by trains  ALL THE TIME.

vagabond,37lb08,TrespassersWilliam_,2,Thu May 28 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know about now, but I lived in a number of communes back in the 1970's for various periods of time.  I was a cartoonist for an underground newspaper in Texas.  I lived in a ""medical commune"" near the Texas Medical Center in Houston--med students, an intern, nurses, lab technicians and a kindergarten teacher. ( And me--I was a hospital orderly.) I hung out for a while at Drop City in Trinidad, Colorado.  I worked at a hippie restaurant in Houston, and most of the staff members lived in a squat a couple of blocks from the restaurant.  I stayed at the S.D.S. house in Eugene, Oregon.  I was young, it was all a big adventure, but I worried about the children and how they were being raised.  My son-in-law (who is a university instructor) was raised on a pot farm commune in Mendocino.  He absolutely hated it, and despises everything about the 1960's hippie movement, especially marijuana.  He uses the word ""hippie"" like a curse word."

Now that I think on it, I've always met at least one person that had lived in a commune recently at each church I've been to.

I've spoke with Matt several times concerning this, and he's excited about it as well.  We asked alot of users about this, and most people interested in going will be working summer-seasonal jobs during July/August, and preferred to do a gathering in early September after most of the jobs end and we all start hitchhiking out of the PNW. So far, I have about 50-60 people interested in going.  Perhaps a suggestion would be to merge the hitchgathering with the /r/Vagabond and STP gathering. If you're willing to meet us in the middle by doing it in early September, we would definitely meet you in Yuba as opposed to other suggested locations."

Matt Derrick and I were trying to aim for early September, particularly the first week of September, so you should have plenty of time.   I'm going to be working in Alaska until the second or third week of August, personally, and most other users that have messaged me about a possible gathering are also working in National Parks or Alaska this summer also.   That's probably the most ""asked"" question I get in concern to the gathering when we suggested doing it in the summer: everyone is pretty much busy working the seasonal gigs."

vagabond,37lg0w,Kalamazoo_Kat,3,Thu May 28 14:08:49 2015 UTC,"I-64 will be fewer stops for hitchiking all the way to D.C. It's a more rural route, which means commuters will be going longer distances without dropping you off in some random town inbetween. Much quicker hitch, in the long run.  On the otherhand, I-70 has more traffic, as it goes past more larger cities (Indianapolis, Cincinatti, Dayton, Pittsburgh, etc). Fewer people will be going all the way to D.C. This means you'll probably have to make a few stops and throw out your thumb several times to get all the way there. Pain in the ass, and really time-consuming, but more traffic is definitely a PLUS.  For I-64, go to St. Clair and thumb out by the exit ramp of Hwy 159 to I-64. It's a huge shopping center, so it's a good place to stock up on any supplies also.  For I-70, go to the Flying J truck-stop 15 miles north of town...it's on the intersection of Chain of Rocks rd. and Highway 111. Most of that traffic jumps onto Interstate 270 eastbound (Interstate 270 turns into I-70 further east).  Sincerely,  Bernie Sanders"

However hiring people is expensive. Especially if there's training involved. So I'd not be pleased if someone I hired quit after a few weeks.

When it comes to jobs, working as a restaurant dishwasher would be a good short term job.  Requires little training and any idiot can do it.  You should be up front with the manager though.  Also look for labor jobs with small construction outfits or for farms.  A lot of cases they are only looking for a strong back and basic skills."

Without clean plates upon which to put his culinary creation, even the finest cordon bleu chef cannot serve a meal.  Don't believe it?  Go read something about the organization of a restaurant kitchen.  Chef, sous chef, pastry chef, expeditor, sauté chef, line cook, fry cook, etc., etc.  The lowliest position is the most important.  Creating clean, sanitary table service (plates, glassware, stemware, silverware, etc.) is the difference between fine dining and dysentery."

vagabond,37dpy9,Blinkinlincoln,0,Tue Jun 2 00:46:19 2015 UTC,"The person renting the room out (the ""landlord"") should get first AND LAST month's rent up front.  They should establish with you from the outset what the deal is.  Many people are renting out a room because they desperately need the money to make their monthly note.  If you suddenly decide to leave, you forfeit the last month's rent.  That allows the ""landlord"" a month to find another renter before the note is due again.  If you don't like this arrangement, stay in a motel.  They don't care when you leave.  The same thing is true of an employer.  He should establish with you, through a contract perhaps, the minimum time you will be working there.  Most employers hold your first paycheck to be sure you don't fuck them over before you leave by not giving notice, by tearing up equipment on purpose, etc.  A lot of young people have the idea that employers are exploiting their labor.  This is not true.  the biggest expense for ANY BUSINESS is the payroll expense, along with the employer's share of your Social Security tax (he pays half), benefits, health insurance, unemployment insurance and so on.  Your wages are just a small part of what it costs an employer to hire you.  After he trains you (you aren't very productive as a trainee, so he's going in the hole for your wages) for him to break even on a new-hire the new-hire must work there for several months at least.  If you work two weeks and then decide to quit and run off to Burning Man or something, you just fucked over the guy who took a chance by giving you a job.  Of course, he'd be pissed.  Wouldn't you be?"
vagabond,37dpy9,SunsetRoute1970,4,Thu May 28 08:23:52 2015 UTC,I don't see how you think most businesses are not exploiting workers. Capitalism is based on exploiting your workers to make a profit.

Of course, I have also seen him light a fire with a plastic bucket and a Bic lighter in an emergency situation (cold, wet, in and the winter.)"
vagabond,374uj1,SunsetRoute1970,2,Mon May 25 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely true. Fire is survival in some situations so you better be able to light one, having 3 or 4 ways to do that is a good idea.  Charcloth is easy to make but not so easy to get fire from in a damp environment. Might end up using a lot of cloth to stop your ember going out!   I carry a mag rod as well there's just less that can go wrong with it unless you use it up it'll always strike. A T-shirt worth of charcloth that weighs nothing sealed up in a plastic bag, and a few of those cubes they sell for barbeques. I've usually got at least 3 lighters in my pack and one on my pocket.  I learnt about a year ago to use a bow drill to make fire by friction and while it's the easiest fire by friction it's still pretty damn difficult until you've got the right wood and technique."

The only real insight I have to the lifestyle is a lot of the documentaries I've watched, with what little bit of travel experience I've had. By travel, I mean by air, bus, and catching rides from some of the tenants in the situations I've been in - but I've put myself in quite a few predicaments that were not exactly planned trips, and survival was dependent on my resourcefulness. I've slept in strange places before, but it wasn't a deliberate life choice - which is where I am lacking in experience.  However, at this juncture in my life it's not exactly something I have an immediate choice to do. There are some material investments I'm making, and though I do want to travel, I would like to have a home base to return to. If that ends up going to shit, then fuck it all, you know? But for now, I'm kind of stuck here with the little bit of sight seeing I've done.   I am however, close friends with a few train-hoppin' kind, and I've heard a lot of their stories and spent many, many hours asking questions and getting to know what their lives have been like.   I just figured that, from what I know, and from what information I can gain here, I'll be doing the best I can to at least convey a good atmosphere and feel. It may be amateur, at best, but I'm super grateful for any information and knowledge I can gain from this thread - wisdom in these endeavors will be what I'm truly lacking. And what I'm thinking is that the common reader that is being targeted with the subject matter won't likely know too much of a difference, but then there will be people who've actually experienced it, who might think to themselves, ""this chick is full of it"" or ""this is really poorly done"".  Which I would really like to avoid."

vagabond,374nwt,SunsetRoute1970,11,Tue May 26 04:16:04 2015 UTC,"There are major railroad routes that run between major cities.  Because these rail routes have not moved in 100 years or so (and are not likely to move, either), they have become very well-known to tramps.  Some of the best known routes are The High Line, that runs between Chicago, Illinois (actually, Cicero) and (depending on which tradition you follow) either Seattle, WA or Portland, OR..  There is also an alternate route, that some call the Low Line, that runs south of the northern route.  (These are not the most northern rail routes at all, but once, many years ago, they were.  Canada has a plethora of rail lines much farther north than the High Line.) The old Frisco Route, now known as the UP Superhighway, runs between San Francisco (actually, Oakland) and Chicago.  Union Pacific's Sunset Route (used to be Southern Pacific) runs between New Orleans and Los Angeles.  Canadian National has a major route between New Orleans through Memphis to Chicago (surely you've heard the song, ""City of New Orleans?""  Kansas City has rail lines heading out pretty much to all points of the compass, mainly BNSF and UP.  Norfolk Southern and CSX dominate the Deep South and the east coast.  The trains bypass most small towns now, but they do stop to change crews in the same places over and over, and there are certain large yards across the U.S. where they stop to marshal trains, do some work dropping off and picking up cars, etc.  You will need to know where you are coming from and going to, and people can tell you what towns trains stop in en route.  Let's say your protagonist starts in Chicago and goes to Minneapolis.  There are certain places on that route (not necessarily a town) where the train might stop to work, like Prairie du Chien or East Winona, but La Crosse is a very likely one.  Learn where the rail routes go, and what railroad predominates.  For instance, Eau Claire is on UP track running between Milwaukee and St. Paul, MN.  La Crosse is on BNSF track  running between Cicero, IL and Minneapolis.  They could both get you to the Twin Cities, but the destination yards are in two different cities, on opposite sides of the Mississippi.  If you want your book to be accurate, you'll have to study the rail routes, crew changes and destination yards for each respective railroad in the area where your characters travel."

The hard rock miners of the IWW were considered to be the most revolutionary and most committed of all the Wobblies.  They worked in the western deserts and habitually carried guns and knew all about explosives.  One of the most famous of all the IWW organizers was a man named ""Big Bill"" Haywood, who killed a union official of the American Federation of Labor in a ""High Noon"" style shootout in Goldfield, Colorado.  The AFL man was killed, and Haywood's arm was paralyzed by his opponent's bullet.  A lot of these little towns out in the middle of nowhere have a shocking history.

vagabond,374nwt,TIGit,2,Tue May 26 11:53:25 2015 UTC,"Buffalo, New York has a huge transient/punk rock/vagabond population and a long history with the culture. It's probably  one of the biggest epicenters of counter culture in the United States right now. It was once one of the biggest rail centers in the United States (right after Chicago) and was a hot spot for migrant workers during the Erie Canal Days. Since the city is located right at the mouth of the Niagara River and right in the center of Toronto, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Rochester and New York City, it's a major stopping off point for people passing through.  It recent times the city has started to see a rebirth with young people flocking to the city. Since things got so bad between the 1970's to 1990's with the industrial decline/loss of jobs, the region was pretty much left with nothing and had to re-invent itself. Now and days, all the old Victorian mansions are turning into squats/punk houses/diy communities, old industrial factories and warehouses are becoming show/art spaces, bands and vagabond travels are constantly passing though.   Buffalo has been referred to as the ""new wild west"" because it's one of the few places in the country where you can truly go to re-invent yourself. Buying a house, starting a band, opening a business, creating art or really just starting a whole new life is possible there because of how cheap the cost of living is. The Do It Yourself mindset has inherently became a part of Buffalo and a support system has been built in to help people out with places like the Lexington Co-Op, Sugar City DIY space, and a ton of other positive force groups.  Here are some good articles about what is and has been going on in the city recently. The first one is about the Bird Haus, one of the hot spots for counter culture travelers in the North East/Great Lakes region.

And what you can't show others you got deep down in your soul, the bitch is that few people can relate or even care about your travelling ezpereonces(even if they act like it), but in the end they are sill there, even if they are just memories they can still be beautiful. Customer service is a fucking drag, I can relate.. Still trying to get into this work thing after 5 months on the road. But in the end it is honest work, and you get a lot of opportunities to make connections, meet people or even brighten up someone's day. Still tho I totally get you, t is nothing long term and no way should it be, frankly.(for me at least) travelling isn't a long term gig either. If you want me opinion which you do cause your posting on reddit.. Hang tough a little longer, keep stacking money, have fun trying to live frugally, go camp for a weekend by yourself, read books etc. you say you're discontent with normal life, a lot of people are.. What is it that you don't dig? Are there any changes yor could make? You also mention being poor, which frankly I just can't feel. Poor isn't something you just are dude... It's a result of your actions.. Stop buying those packs a day, maybe drink less beer, cook for yourself(which is another skill you should be workin on anyways), and you'll save shit loads.   Don't take it all too seriously tho dog. I am more or less in your exact situation so I do know how it goes.

Make sure you have lots of money saved (and don't tell anyone about your secret saved money/backup plan) and have a really solid backup plan to fall back on.   You should sit down and think about what you want to do as a career though. Sure, customer service sucks, but you can't just go live on the streets eating trash from dumpsters for the rest of your life (well, you could). So, think about something productive you could do that would actually be fulfilling.

If you're wanting to make a documentary about trainhopping, you might find some interested hobos. But asking trainhoppers to go out of their way and use their time to personally train you? Probably not.  You can go down to the Haight and the horseshoe at Golden Gate Park and find trainhoppers, but they'll likely throw a beer can at you if you approach them like that..."

Some crusties are pretty cool, but alot are drug addicts and scumfucks that will screw anyone over, including their road dawgs.  Also, you can't get to SD from SF. You have to go to Oakland, and then hop a UP SBD to Colton/San Bernadino.  Only way a group of trainhoppers are going to teach you is if you already got miles under your belt and youre wearing a pack.  But even then, if you have a home and aren't really homeless, they'll likely ostracize you altogether.  Alot of people get pissed off at this and claim we're being ""elitist"" or being ""stuck-up"", but they fail to understand this lifestyle is illegal, subject to getting blown up, and generally reserved for those that have needs other than freelance journalism/blogging."
vagabond,36xwf6,ORcrush,1 point,Sat May 23 02:07:33 2015 UTC,"Don't mean to be a dick but I'll just simply state what most here will...  You won't get help here, the people who hop trains are those who absolutely have to, I.e they need to cover the Midwest where hitching is difficult and at parts near deadly(try waitin on the road in Texas for a ride during July)   Not for some trendy documentary film so that some yuppie in sf can make some bucks and then jerk off while telling all his cool friends how he hopped a train once, meanwhile lookin down at his local homebums trying to make some money.  Also asking around haight is a prettty terrible idea if you ask me, the kids there don't fuck around.. Lots of drugs,crime around that part, it's not the chill hippie scene it used to be. They will take one look at you as a ""freelance journalist"" and ultimately end up taking advantage. It's honestly too easy, you should realize that if you are thinking of hitting the road.  Speaking of danger, have you even thought of what hopping a train entails? Maybe read a few stories of how people got there legs chopped off, maybe hat would be lucky for you idk im sure it would open up a lot of writing time.   In short don't do it Ben, i don't mean to come off as a total dick cause that's usually counterproductive . However you need to look out for yours and others best interests, it is a risk to your own safety, and ultimately that type of documentary shit is gonna encourage even more kids wanting to hop trains. Bad for the dumb fuck kids who get hurt and even worse bad for the kids who don't have any other option but to hop freight.   Do you even have any travel experience? You must realize that hitching is fairly easy on the west, especially this time of year."

One way that they load coal cars is with an auger that spews coal out like a water hose, as the car moves slowly beneath it.  If they were passed out from drugs or alcohol, they may have been killed when the car was loaded originally.  Or, like the article said, may have been sitting on top of a loaded car and dropped through the dump gates at the generating plant when the car was unloaded.  The thing I don't understand is that these industrial processes are unbelievably LOUD.  You would have to be unconscious to not realize what was happening."

I grabbed as many as I could grab (around 20-30), and I started passing them out to everyone walking around the 16th street mall for free.   I basically just walked up to dudes and said ""Hey man, here's a rose, impress your girlfriend tonight""...  I probably got 20 men laid that night, if not more."

Got spooked when another car came onto us, thought it was a cop who saw us from Timmy Hoe's, but it was the same two kids. Smooth as fuck, I pulled this fresh daisy bouquet out of the Aldi dumpster and gave it to the girl. We giggled, it was adorable.   Didn't get laid and never saw her again, but ran into the dude a year or so later."

Not everybody vagabond is a working hobo or clean-cut backpacker, you know?  Who is this guy hurting by choosing to be a crusty vagabond anyway? He's taking a few months off to go camping and exploring places he's never seen, and looking for friends to join him. He knows that showers are going to be hard to come by, and that dumpster-diving may become necessary.   Sure, he wrote this in a shitty comical/satirical style, but atleast he is proving that he's honest and prepared. Dumpster-diving and infrequent baths/showers is the reality of any vagabond, and he is clearly mentally prepared for that reality. Kudos to him!  Sidenote: OP (/u/JayDecay), it was a funny post. Ignore this asshole, as it's probably from a troll account anyway. Keep on keepin' on, OP, and good luck with the craigslist ad.  thumbs up"

My overall point is this: If you don't like people that can't shower often, or people that hop freight trains, you're likely in the wrong subreddit.   If you happen to be past puberty, the typical reaction would be to hit the back button on your browser, and hopefully find an online community more suitable to your tastes. If that's just too much to ask, and you feel like you MUST be heard here, atleast approach our community with a bit more respect and understanding.  Look dude, I could have banned you already. But I try not to be a dickhead moderator until someone absolutely proves they are here with intentions of trolling/harassing us.   If you don't like us, leave. If you wanna stay here, try to open your mind and heart a little bit, or learn when to bite your tongue."
vagabond,36h2mh,huckstah,-4,Tue May 19 20:42:26 2015 UTC,"No one is trolling or harassing you. Just because someone expresses a strong opinion does not make them a harasser.   I can guess at the power trip that being a moderator can put people on within these forums. The idea that only people who support a certain viewpoint should be allowed within these forums (otherwise you are a ""troll"") is silly. You can down vote me if you like. You can express your opinion about my viewpoint like I am expressing one about yours. And a strong one too!  When people comment on a news article or post about abortion, is everyone required to be pro choice or pro life? Do the moderators ban people who might be one way or another? What if people are expressing strong opinions? Hurting other people's feelings? What if people use bad words? Would that upset the cry babies around here? If I say something that hurts a pro choicer's feelings, will you ban me?  I'm calling a spade a spade: The guy in the CL ad listing is rolling around in dirt drinking from bottles of liquor like a bum and if I call him out on that I'm a troll and a harasser. If all he gets is support for his behavior, then why would he ever reflect on his choices? Maybe this should be a support forum instead? /r/vagabondsupport?  This is silly nonsense. No one running reddit can make up their minds; Either stand for principles on which these forums are supposedly based on, or stop pretending that this is some space for open debate or opinions."

Most of your past comments are leading people into arguments, and you have been dowwnvoted into oblivion multiple times on various subreddits.  No wonder you're highly sensitive towards forum moderators restricting your comments or banning you: you are an internet asshole.  And please, don't hold me to some ""moderator pedestal""...I'm a fucking trainhopper that's trying his best to peacefully run an online community of vagabonds, and it certainly doesn't help to deal with trolling comments submitted by obvious throwaway accounts.   If you are unhappy with our community, leave. If not, be respectful. If you can't be an adult and do either choice, I can make that decision much easier for you."

It's not ""calling someone out"" on something, when what they're doing doesn't hurt anyone at all. So, if you're not a troll, then you're just a real life complete judgmental asshole. Why should I reflect on any of my choices? You have no idea what I've done in my life, besides what I've posted on here, in a humorous craigslist ad, and four pictures of myself.   I don't have to have to explain myself to some random internet dickhead, but I'm willing to bet that I've done way more good in the world than you ever will. People enjoy being around me. I've touched lives. I've fed thousands, if not tens of thousands of people. I've gotten people off drugs. I've helped build hundreds of gardens in poor communities. I play music and make art that new people hear and see every day. I've helped build churches. I've rescued animals. I've taken care of the elderly. I've volunteered at pretty much any type of organization that you can think of. Today alone I'm hanging out with a friend and making sure they're okay while they detox from drugs, and later I will be performing music for free to benefit a local community center.  What have you done today besides been a judgmental piece of shit? Think before you have opinions on someone, or maybe at least get to know them a little bit. You are the problem with society."

She was born in the Canadian Maritimes and speaks French as a first language.  She is a very experienced and resourceful trainhopper with about twelve or thirteen years on the rails.  She has, in the parlance of the tramps, ""long legs""--she rides long distances.  She is the only tramp to ever ride into the National Hobo Convention at Britt, Iowa in the last fifteen years of which I am aware.  If anybody else did it, they kept it very quiet.  (There is so much law enforcement at the National Hobo Convention that riding in on a train is virtually impossible.  Unless you are Stray Cat.)  Google her.  Stray Cat Julie, Queen of Hobos."
vagabond,36ha3n,airdice_are_bestdice,13,Tue May 19 11:31:24 2015 UTC,"You can definitely trainhop with dogs. However, keep in mind that you need to think about how your dog will react.  Freight trains are big and loud. Most dogs are extremely nervous around them the first time they get up close to one. For example, what will your dogs reaction be if the horn blows? Is it going to freak the fuck out and try to jump off the car? On the otherhand, is it going to start barking, therefore blowing your cover on the train?  You have to train your dog to be next to trains, hear the horns, and get adjusted to that. Best way to do that is to camp out OUTSIDE of a train yard, keep your dog on a leash, and go sit by the tracks so that it gets used to the sounds and movements of trains.  The biggest downfall to this is that you're not going to be able to catch trains on the fly with a dog that size. But hey, it's fucking stupid to catch trains on the fly anyway, unless you have years of experience, and even then it's still pretty stupid.  Also, please remember to have your dog tied up on the train. Dogs can get knocked off a train by ""slack"" just like a human, and a good jerk can easily send your dog flying off the car at 40 mph, and you will have no hope of ever, ever seeing that dog again or knowing if it lived or died. PLEASE keep your tied up on a short leash!  Leash or no leash, your dog is going to need discipline/training. Hopping a train with a dog is no instant process...you have to train and prepare your dog to do this, just as you need to train and prepare yourself for doing this.   Another thing: Please clean up after your dog. Last year I hopped a perfect grain-car, only to discover 3 piles of dog shit on the floor. One of these piles was still kinda wet, and it got on one of the straps of my backpack. I had to throw my damn pack off the car, jump off, then run 4 cars down to find another good grainer to ride. Then I had to use the last of my shit-tickets (napkins) to clean the dogshit off my straps."
vagabond,36ha3n,huckstah,4,Tue May 19 13:24:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of crusties hop because hitching with a dog is such a(n even bigger) pain in the ass. Along with everything /u/huckstah said, remember that wherever you go, you won't be able to ride a bus once you get there. We'd always end up walking from one end of town to the other once we got to a city because half the kids (or at the very least, one) had dogs. Most bars, stores, and the like aren't going to let you bring your dog in with you, and it's not like you can leave him at home. Also remember that no matter how well-trained, a dog may act very different on the road. I think they enjoy being nomads, but sometimes that makes them more territorial, and they may bark at people (like yard hands or bulls) or be aggressive towards other dogs, though they didn't previously.  Not trying to talk you out of it, by the way, just offering the first considerations that came to mind."
vagabond,36ha3n,maxbastard,1 point,Wed May 20 03:25:46 2015 UTC,"I ride with my dog, but I got her after I learned the rails. This is all she's ever known and luckily she likes it. If have a dog, I'd think twice about bringing it if I were you. Yes, the dog may love you and want to be with you, but it may also not adjust to the road very well. Also, if you're learning the ropes, it leaves a lot of room for error and possibly losing your dog. Also, keep in mind the cops can be pretty gnarly and you can be arrested for 'vagrancy' at any time which means Fido goes to the pound. A emergency money for bailing your dog out/unexpected injuries is a must IMO."
vagabond,36ha3n,FrankieLynn,1 point,Fri May 22 23:26:51 2015 UTC,"Hopping trains with a dog is difficult, but hitchhiking with a dog has got to be even worse.  I once hitchhiked across Canada with a girlfriend and a mama dog and a cardboard box full of puppies.  Despite the fact that my girlfriend was very attractive, it took FOREVER because of all the dogs.  My advice is to not hop with a dog that is not a ""hobo dog,"" i.e. a dog that has been raised on the rails.  I advise you to learn all about it first, then get a short-haired, brown colored puppy from the pound that comes from small parents, parents that weighed no more than twenty-five pounds.  (This type of dog is a classic Third World survivor-dog.)  Make sure he or she is spayed or neutered,  has all his shots, a rabies tag, a city or county dog license, AND A G.I. DOG TAG WITH HIS NAME, YOUR NAME AND YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER.  Raise the puppy ON THE RAILS, on train cars, with all the banging and clanging and loud-ass train noises, so he or she will be used to it and will think of a loud-ass train environment as ""normal.""  Keep his veterinary paperwork  with you, just like you carry your passport, I.D., etc.  If you get busted, the police will threaten to have your dog euthanized if you get more than a day or two in jail.  You can call Animal Control, beg them not to kill your dog, promise them anything if they will hold him until you get out.  If your name is on the dog tag, it's unlikely they will euthanize him.  Do most tramps do this?  No.  And the Animal Control people frequently kill tramps' dogs because they are unvaccinated, unkempt, infested with parasites, unlicensed and the owner is unidentifiable.  Being an oogle's dog is practically a death sentence."

vagabond,368srn,airdice_are_bestdice,8,Sun May 17 07:31:02 2015 UTC,"The real trick to ""campfire cookery,"" is that you never use an open flame.  You cook on COALS.  This means that you need to learn how to build a fire that creates a good bed of coals to begin with.  That means choosing wood that is appropriate and learning to ""lay a fire.""  Just piling up wood willy-nilly and setting it on fire with a fusee or lighting off a plastic bucket is fine if you are just trying to avoid freezing to death, but it will not yield a good fire for cooking.  It takes some time for a fire to burn down to coals.  Hardwood makes the best fires.  Oak, ash, walnut, pecan, mesquite, beech, birch, apple, pear--pretty much any kind of fruit tree--cherry, chestnut, etc.  Obviously, you aren't going to encounter a lot of exotic hardwoods laying around a hobo jungle.  What will you find a lot of?  PALLETS.  What are they usually made of?  Hardwood.  They are a bitch to break up, though.  There are a variety of ""lays"" for a fire.  I think I prefer two.  The ""teepee"" lay for windless days where you have to fan the fire, and the ""log cabin"" (or ""criss cross"") lay for days that have a little breeze.  Start by gathering a large quantity of DRY, appropriately sized wood.  Some tinder, some firestarter wood, some actual fuel.  No logs.  You really want small, dry tinder, wadded-up newspaper, dry cardboard strips, dryer lint, or ""fire starter"" sticks (made by making cuts on a bunch of dry sticks that leaves them covered with ""tongues"" that will catch fire easily.)  Having a blow tube or a fan (I like real estate signs) makes this a lot easier.  Make a teepee of small diameter, DRY sticks (DRY, DEAD squaw wood, broken off of trees and bushes)  with the tinder inside.  Light it off with a Bic lighter, or, if you just insist, with kitchen matches.  Once it's burning well, start adding SLIGHTLY LARGER pieces of DRY WOOD.  (If you drop a log on your fire, it will not catch, understand?  It has to be only slightly larger pieces of wood.)  Okay, you got a fire started.  Start feeding the fire SMALL pieces of busted-up, hardwood pallet.  Once it gets burning good, it will make very little smoke, unless you do something stupid, like feeding the fire wet wood, green wood, or leaves, all of which create tons of smoke.  While you are waiting for (enjoying) the fire to burn down, assemble your meal and pots.  WHEN YOU HAVE A BED OF COALS, then you can start cooking.  A grill out of an old junk refrigerator is good, suspended on a few rocks or chunks of concrete.  You can suspend a pot over the fire on a dog chain suspended from a tripod.  Using a ""Z-hook"" made from a nail or the S-hook off of a trucker's rubber bungee cord, you can raise or lower the pot on the dog chain, adjusting the temperature.  Once the fire burns down to coals, you will have a nice, even heat of around 700-800 degrees, far too hot for cooking.  You don't want to put pots directly on coals this hot.  Elevating the pot/ skillet/ coffee pot/ etc. a few inches makes a lot of difference.  Radiated heat from a bed of coals can easily be 350-400 degrees.  You can fry, broil, boil or bake on a bed of coals.  I never actually baked a cake on a campfire, but I have baked bread in a coffee-can gunboat closed up with aluminum foil.  Or, you can use a gasoline-fired backpacker's stove.  Not too cool, but definitely efficient."
vagabond,368srn,SunsetRoute1970,10,Mon May 18 07:01:06 2015 UTC,"Instead of carrying a heavy glass bottle, most of us just grab packets of hot sauce from taco bell or other mexican fast food places. Same thing with packets of ketchup, mustard, mayo, salt, pepper, etc.  I would honestly avoid rice and go with pastas, unless you buy the quick-rice brands that only take 10-20 mins to cook. Rice is almost impossible to get right over a typical campfire, unless you get the temperature and water JUST right. It's a pain in the ass. It also makes a mess and it's almost to impossible to clean the bottom of your pot.  One of my favorite hobo recipes is stuffed bellpepper. I usually buy a single potato, a single onion, and a single bell pepper. Slice off the top of the bell pepper, and stuff it with sliced onions and potatoes. Wrap the whole thing up in a aluminum foil, and lay it on top of some coals after the fire has died down. Poke it with a stick and pull it out after 20 mins...season it with some salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Delicious and really filling. Good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Can't get any cheaper than a single potato, onion, and bell pepper, and they don't add too much weight or diameter to your pack either. Buy some tortilla wraps to go along with it, and now you're really talking about a filling meal.  Otherwise, I like carrying beenie weenies, sardines, tuna, canned stews/soups, etc. PEANUT BUTTER is a MUST!  As far as cooking skills that will impress other vagabonds and hobos, learning to cook over an open campfire is the most essential."
vagabond,368srn,huckstah,9,Sun May 17 07:55:49 2015 UTC,"Rice can be tricky. Let me share the way I learned. It works every time for perfect fluffy rice.   First I throw the rice in my pot, usually about a cup or whatever. Then I fill the pot with water until the water level is over the rice, up to the first knuckle of my index finger. I bring that to a boil with the lid off and continue to let the water level drop until it's just under the top of the rice and I see little bubbles/channels formed up. Then I put the lid on, remove the pot from direct heat and just keep it some place where it will stay warm, off to the side of the fire or on a hot stone. Even setting it out in the sun works just fine on a clear day. I basically just let it finish soaking up the rest of the water, which takes about 15 minutes.  It's not the traditional way to cook it, but it yields perfect fluffy rice every time and takes out the guesswork for me. It's not as fast/easy as quick rice, but way cheaper and it still only takes about 25 minutes in all.   I eat rice at least once a day, and it can get old really fast. I usually throw in some canned veggies and/or canned chicken to mix it up a bit. Rice will pretty much accept any flavor you decide to throw in there."

Go in there 10-15 mins before closing, and just ask them if they can give you a couple tortillas...offer them some change in your pocket if you have it. They'll give them to you 99% of the time. Also ask if you can have a packet of hot sauce, and they'll likely give you a handful.   Don't be surprised if 75% of the time you do this they give you a styrofoam plate of their leftover refried beans and rice. I'm not exaggerating.

In the modern world we tend to pawn our satisfaction as if it's a currency to be banked for some future prosperity, and no longer live in the moment. When you can appreciate what you have instead of worrying about what you want, the relentless drive of consumerism becomes empty and pointless.

Not everyone that chooses to be a functioning productive member of society is shackled by some imaginary chains.

People take loans out to pay for big ticket items the can not immediately afford.  Financial institutions usually do not loan out money unless you have a means to pay for it.  Most tend to want at least 2 years of stable employment (which is a different topic of you want to compare the value of his freedom to the ball-and-chain of a job).  There would be little to no way for a hobo to collect enough money to pay for a house in cash.  Eventually you will pay off that loan and now own a property that will, hopefully, grow in value.  Cars are a different story, they lose value.  But, most people find it a necessary debt to facilitate their ability to pay for a loan.  If you manage it right, you should make more income than you have to pay monthly for your debts.  The best way make this as cheap as possible is to maintain your credit score.  It isn't hard to do, just pay back what you owe.  We are all honest people, if you buy something on credit and don't pay that credit, you are stealing.  I don't like all the fees and extra charges, so I am picky with what credit options are available to me.  Get rid of bad debt, keep good debt.

They're my absolute favorite travel wear, because they're typically fairly tough, they're really light, and the zip-off's are nice when it gets hot out.   leather coat    I can't imagine leather ever working well out on the road but that's just me. I think you could find a lighter, potentially warmer and more compactable jacket at a thrift store.   knife, box cutter, multi-tool   I've got a Leatherman Wave that functions as all of these things. Does your multi-tool sufficiently cover your knife/boxcutter needs? If you're carrying a knife for self-defense purposes, get mace instead.    main headphones   Why two pairs of headphones? They weigh nothing so it's not like you'll notice but just curious.    extra belt   Do you need an extra belt?   flashlight   I suggest a headlamp. I've found myself in many situations at night where a headlamp is just easier.    footwear   I'd invest in some top dollar trail runners.

Note that you can probably find sufficient footwear if you hit thrift stores hard enough, but for a traveler, feet are crucial.    What other things do I need to add?   Do you have stuff for sleeping? I'm a huge fan of inflatable air mattresses and hammocks. Also paracord (or any cord, really) is useful. If it rains, you can just string up your hammock and tie up your tarp over you as a rain fly.   I also agree with huckstah...get a proper pack. Unless the Janspot (fully loaded) feels good for you. It's hard to gauge sometimes because your pack can feel fantastic for ten minutes, but picture having to walk ten miles in 100F degree weather...is it still suitable?    What should I also carry if I'm traveling with a dog?   I don't have a dog but I think the basics would be: food (obviously), bandages, antibiotics that can survive the temperature swings of travel, vitamins/etc (there's a supplemental paste you can feed dogs that has like 5000 calories in a 1/4 teaspoon. Also, take into account emergencies. Imagine your dog breaking a leg or getting parvo or worse...will you have the $100, $500, $1000 to spend? If possible, CareCredit or something like that may be worth looking into. Sure, you'll go into debt, but isn't a companion animal worth it?   Otherwise you've got a good pack here!

vagabond,365ffr,SunsetRoute1970,2,Sun May 17 00:06:16 2015 UTC,"It's all about choices.  When I returned to school (at age 36) I was supporting myself, my wife and my 2-year-old daughter on $99 a week Unemployment.  It was hard as hell.  We ate beans and rice a lot.  I had a 1972 Datsun pick-up up on blocks in my back yard, a 1970 Harley-Davidson FLH motorcycle in pieces all over my house, and I was driving a rattle-trap 1966 Dodge Power Wagon 4x4 that desperately needed a valve job and tires.  The bitches at Social Services told my wife they ""couldn't possibly"" give us food stamps because we owned three vehicles, and they made a point of telling her we'd have to sell the Harley, ""because I have a good State job and so does my husband, and WE can't afford a Harley.""  My wife stood up and told her, ""If you think my husband is going to sell a Harley-Davidson motorcycle so we can get fucking food stamps, you are out of your mind.  FORGET IT.  We don't need your goddamned food stamps.""  That year we were SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS below the Federal poverty line for a family of three.  Fuck welfare.  We made it without them, and now I probably make three times what that bitch was making.  GO.  TO.  COLLEGE.  And don't study some bullshit like Art History, either."

But they will sure help every scumbag ghetto rat who refuses to take any responsibility for himself or herself.  That year we made my daughter's Christmas presents from scratch.  My wife sewed Barbie clothes out of fabric scraps, and we hand-sawed-up dumpster-dived 2x4s into an apple box full of children's blocks.  I cut down our Christmas tree illegally in the Umatilla National Forest.  I rebuilt my Harley's engine in my living room on a homemade work bench.  We heated our house with slash-pile firewood from logging operations and scrap wood I salvaged from behind a cannery.  We grew a 1/4 acre garden, raised rabbits and chickens for food, ate venison and elk my father-in-law shot the year before and put in his freezer.  I worked for barter off the books and then bartered the barter for child care while we went to college.  Fucking welfare bastards.  Screw them.  We survived in spite of them.  My little girl learned about how to survive on nothing (or practically nothing) at a very young age.  I quit drinking.  Couldn't afford it.  I quit smoking.  Couldn't afford it.  Our ""entertainment budget"" was $1.50 a week (this is absolute truth.)  We used it to rent a video tape for my kid, most weeks.  She was watching us kill and butcher rabbits before she was four.  She helped hoe weeds in the same garden that produced the food she ate.  She sat and watched me do a valve job on the Power Wagon in the snow.  Life can be hard.  We have to be harder.  You know you are broke when you have to BARTER WORK for junkyard auto parts, and install them out-of-doors in a snowstorm."

vagabond,35zbkp,Scribblessd,4,Thu May 14 19:50:14 2015 UTC,"When I was homeless I lived in abandoned buildings with a guy who had 3 dogs. Those dogs were some of the happiest dogs I've met. They ate well - always before the humans - and got to hang out all day with their friends. People have severe misconceptions about what dogs want. I saw a horrible movie once in which a young lady finds herself in financial difficulties and has trouble keeping her dog fed and safe. In the end, she abandons her dog, leaving her with some random people who just happen to have a fenced-in yard. I know my dogs would prefer to live in hell with me than in heaven with some strangers who have a fence. Dogs are not like humans. Comfort isn't their number 1 priority at all times. But even if it were, why assume homeless people can't give a dog a great life? There's no reason why it can't happen if the person loves their dog as themselves. I really hate that movie and I'm glad I forgot the title of it. Dogs love adventures and a vagabond life is usually full of those."

Then I remember all the times when I was working 9 to 5...or 10...at the office all day, and she would be stuck inside listening to the radio all day. I wonder if she would be happy just being a lazy, fat dog in a fenced yard.   Her excitement when we are on the road tells me she wouldn't be. When we work on farms, bullying the chickens, catching flies out of the air, running after birds -- that's the life for her. Not to say it's all fun for her. We've had to sleep in train stations & in our tent. She always gets most of the blankets and her food is first priority. Her vet checkups are #1 in our tiny budget. She even gets first (and last, and middle) bites of my food. She's probably the most spoiled dog in the universe. Also the most loved & cherished. She's my best friend.   Screw that other movie. We just saw ""Tracks"", about the woman who crosses the Australian outback with her dog & 4 camels. Watch that one instead (just beware the tears). There's a good quote from it:   “It seems to me the Universe gave us three things to make life bearable: hope, jokes, and dogs. But the greatest of these gifts is dogs.” - Robyn Davidson"

That being said if you can get out of Toronto heading west on a freight and actually make it past subdury, PM me and tell me how you did it, and if the answer is correct Ill happily fill you in on the rest of the way.

If you are my advice is get that van looked over while you're there, until you get to eastern Europe where parts can be expensive labour is ridiculous and you'll regret not getting it sorted there. Parts are cheap in England and you get dirt cheap tyres, oil changes, maintanance, etc.  I did a similar thing 10 years ago and leaving that country was the best thing I ever did. I had a beat up car with a slipping clutch and old squeaky belts. I didn't have the money at the time to get anything done but it woulda cost a fraction of the price it does here in mainland. The car made it anyway with some inventive fixes and I sold it.  If you need to get anything fixed you're much better off waiting till 5:30+ and asking around a bar if anyone knows someone who can do it for cash. You might have to wait around a few days till he has time but savings are easily worth it.  Don't go on toll roads driving unless you're on a schedule, but if you're hitchhiking toll roads are your best friend because its much easier to get picked up.   Anything else specific just ask"

vagabond,35ptjr,Chtorrr,2,Wed May 13 00:31:43 2015 UTC,"Also, in your first comment, you use the term outsider. If you're interested in philosophy, check out Colin Wilson's The Outsider for an exploration of the Outsider archetype. A truly marvelous book (partly because of his age when he wrote it) that deals with a fair amount of Tolstoy whom, if I'm not wrong, you're interested in. He says something (which Bukowski almost echoes verbatim) like, those who feel themselves apart from society feel compelled to become either saints or sinners, monks or murderers, which I dig (if ""murderer"" is thought to be representative of criminality, not immorality). The overlap is obvious. Renunciation and revolt are more similar than different. How, now, can someone imitate Christ - become a wandering holywoman - without breaking a law or three?"

vagabond,35qaoe,Brownplayboy310,3,Tue May 12 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"Back in the early 1970's I knew a couple that were tramps that had two children, a girl and a little boy.  The husband was a shipyard worker, among other things, and they travelled from one shipyard to another looking for work.  They travelled various ways, depending on their economic situation, but it seemed like one hard-luck story after another.  They bought an old beat-up truck, then the engine blew up.  They'd find a house to rent, then the house would have some problem, a leaky roof, or the plumbing, or something.  One time they were using candles for light and the house caught fire and burned down and they couldn't rescue all their stuff.  When I knew them they were sleeping on the floor in sleeping bags and the children were sleeping on an old mattress on the floor.  The house had water, but no gas and no electricity, so they were cooking on a little hibachi charcoal grill in the back yard.  It wasn't a good environment for the children, especially the baby boy.  Eventually, her parents agreed to allow her and the children to move into their home in California, but they refused to allow the husband to come.  He was living on the street, and she and the children were living an upper-middle class life with her parents.  The grandparents doted on the little girl (she looked a lot like her mother, who was very attractive) but they did not like the little boy because he looked like his father.  The grandparents went to court and got complete custody and guardianship over the children, against the mother's wishes.  While they were living with the grandparents, the little boy died in a tragic plastic dry-cleaning bag accident.  The mother suspected her parents of deliberately allowing the boy to play with the plastic bag, and she took the little girl and ran for it, hiding out in a commune in Arkansas for several years.  One day, she failed to signal making a right-hand turn in a commune truck, got stopped by the police, the cops ran her for warrants, and she was arrested when the cops found out she was charged with child kidnapping in California.  The grandparents regained custody of the little girl and just ""disappeared.""  They sold their home in California, emptied out all their bank accounts and left no forwarding address..  When the mother got out of jail, the trail was cold and the grandparents had taken the little girl and were long gone. I don't know what happened to them after that.  The father is still a radical anarchist political activist.  The mother was living in Washington State on Disability last time I heard anything about her. The smart thing to do if you are on the road and have a child is to settle down somewhere and adopt a more-or-less conventional lifestyle.  It is very hazardous (because of CPS) to do otherwise, and if you stay on the road you risk losing the kids..  I know a man (who is now a university instructor) who was raised like an orphan on a marijuana farm in the late 1970s and 1980s.   He hates drugs, especially marijuana, and he uses the word ""hippie"" like a curse word.  He told me once that he had 22 ""mothers,"" but his own parents abandoned him to be raised by the commune.  He goes back to visit every few years, to see his ""mothers.""  He told me, ""I like seeing my mothers, but it's in the middle of fucking  nowhere.  You have to drive sixteen miles to even buy gasoline.  Every single adult is high as ten kites every minute of the day and night.  I couldn't wait to get the hell away from there."""

That is crazy. I brought my baby home on a city bus though, in the 90's. I wonder if they call CPS now if you can't afford a cab/car seat or car wtf  A few ways I have seen homeless/travelling women handle pregnancy are: abortions (NY and CA are free through medicaid up to 24weeks, maybe other places). A family member taking care of the child. Going to a shelter with the baby (or before) wait around there some months to get subsidized housing and welfare. Going off to intentional communities with other couples/families with children. I have known three women to have their child/children taken and put in foster care (sleeping in squats/car/church) :( So far only one has re-gained custody (having gone through a shelter)   I have not personally known anyone with a baby in the rubbertramp mode of travel, but that seems to me (with no rubbertramp nor driving experience lol) it could be the most feasible"

Transporting a child under four years old or 40 lbs. in a vehicle without him being belted into a car seat is a $500 ticket.  Second offense is $1,000 ticket.  Third time, CPS gets the kid. When I was a kid, cars and trucks did not even have seat belts at all.  I must have ridden 10,000 miles in the back of my Dad's pick-up or my uncle's pick-up and never got so much as a scratch."

I worked for six years for Juvenile Probation as a corrections nurse (like a jail nurse.)  The stories I heard every day would break your heart--mothers who left the kids alone for days at a time while she turned tricks for drugs in a crack house; a boy whose family checked him into a psychiatric hospital, claimed he was suicidal, then moved with no forwarding address and abandoned the kid in a locked psych unit.  (It took three weeks to track those assholes down--they moved to another state and were hiding.)  I must have dealt with two or three hundred kids who were sexually abused by mother's boyfriend, several who were turned out to prostitution, forced to sell drugs on the street, involved in crime with their parents (burglary, auto theft, shoplifting, etc.)  CPS workers have a horrible job, and they have a very high rate of depression.  One of my co-workers was an ex-CPS investigator, and she told me,"" I had to quit.  I was either going to kill one of those child-molesting bastards or kill myself.  I couldn't stand it any more.

It was a legitimate way of getting around without a car.  Now Uber has monetized it! :-)   For the most part didn't meet too many creeps.

Im subbed to /r/vagabond because i'm interested in doing some sort of aimless trip when i get out of university.  I would just say that it probably isn't the best idea to dream about this sort of lifestyle.. it's pretty distracting. If you hate school then you may be able to do something about it, perhaps talk to teachers or a councilor. Just keep going, talk to your friends about it and you may find some understanding from them.   Perhaps try to do a few short trips without a goal. Like you know maybe a whole day just fucking about without a goal. Then try and stay somewhere for a weekend. Then try and go on a longer term trip in summer or whatever.

Put all this feeling you have about the bullshit you go through every day into a short film or a book or a song. Talk to people. Have fun. Find new shit to do new music to listen to new games to play.

I'm not a vagabond, so I can't speak from the lifestyle, but I can speak from my personal experiences.  Im in my mid 20's and am going to graduate in the fall after taking 6 years to go to school.  I hated it at first!!  Didn't want to go, considered dropping out, and took some time off.  I learned hard lessons throughout my college career, and most of them didnt actually involve school (which I have learned so much by continuing my education).  I putzed along, got by, failed some classes, would ditch school, and just went to go, I saw it as pointless, much like you.  But that all changed when I had an unexpected life event happen to me, which really put things into perspective.  I couldnt pay rent, couldnt pay my medical bills which were upwards of half a million dollars, and the shitty job I was working wouldn't cut it.  I saw what having an education could do for me, not only financially, but mentally as well.  Life is about learning, and working hard, having shitty times and having great times, and school helped me with that.  People always ask me what I want to do with my degree, and I tell them that I just want to be happy.  So do what makes you happy, but don't do it for the wrong reasons.  I dont know you, so I'm just making a very general statement, but if you want to give up at school because it sucks, what makes you think that you can live off of nothing for days on end, carrying a pack for miles if you dont get a ride?  Or when you get caught up in a shitty situation, whats going to push you through it?  While this lifestyle has a lot of allure and freedom, this shouldn't be mistaken for a lazy life, because its going to be work, just a different kind.  Again I'm saying these things to get you to think, and not judging you or making any assumptions.  This maybe exactly the kind of life you want, but again I stress that you make the decision because its something that you want, and not to run away from things, becuase they can very well catch up to you.  Summer is about to be here and school over with, so take some time to explore, go back packing or a road trip and test the waters so to speak, but in the end you have to do what makes you happy; school or no school, traveling or working a job, and that's only for you to know.  I hope I don't come accross as preachy, I just wanted to share a perspective and my experiences with you in hopes to get you thinking.  Best of luck!"

Now I'm not encouraging you to runaway I'm just highlighting what realistically are possible methods for expressing what you want( freedom from school).

Last time I was there, I saw tons of younger boat-punks buying up cheap sailboats and repairing them to live on.   Otherwise, Florida craigslist is always good.

Lots of concerned weekend sailors will toss every line on their boats on a semi-annual basis, so if you can dig through the dumpsters there come spring cleaning time, you can get lots of good rope. Also just weird gear and tackle which is good to stockpile on a boat.  I wouldn't recommend doing this without a membership though, not unless you can guarantee you won't get caught. In my experience if you're supposed to be there they overlook it, but rooting around in boatyards when you're not invited = bad news.   Another thing about owning your own boat and not much else is that you need a massive amount of tools to make things work. So many people assume they can buy a fiberglass boat cheap and go TransAt the next week, but it ain't like that. Probably accumulating a massive stockpile of tools and supplies is the second most important thing, after ownership, followed by actually learning how to sail. But that's just my two cents, because I like doing things the hard way."

Marines actually use this tape to mark certain things with their name stencil kit (or did, back in 1976) but it makes an excellent repair tape if your glasses frame loses a screw or otherwise takes a shit while you are in the field.  I have had to repair my glasses while trainhopping a couple of times, and I hauled out my trusty white bandage tape with which to do it.  Works great.

vagabond,35fv7k,SunsetRoute1970,22,Sat May 9 23:18:40 2015 UTC,"My mentor in 1970 wouldn't even use military surplus gear, which was very cheap back then.  Army-Navy surplus after WWII and Korea was dirt cheap.  When I was a boy all my friends and I each had nearly a complete set of combat equipment--packs, cartridge belts, canteens, canteen covers, canteen cups, etc., etc.  My old friend wouldn't even carry a combat knapsack, which back then you could get for about  two or three dollars at any surplus store.  He used a ""tater sack"" (a burlap bag for potatoes) and a piece of cotton rope for a ruck, slept in a two-blanket bindle (also carried with a piece of cotton rope) and carried an old-style Clorox jug for water.  He always said, ""Fancy gear just attracts jackrollers and I don't want to have to kill nobody.  Not today, anyway."""
vagabond,35fv7k,negroyverde,15,Sun May 10 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"Goddamn good post right here. I'm wayy greener than you, but I've been around a bit, and can definitely say that not only are you right that the expensive gear isn't necessary, but also, over time, it's inevitable that any well-used gear setup is going to have its quirks and jimmy-rigs. Eventually it's gonna be almost all rigged, DIY shit. My nice backpack's strap broke - I sewed it with dental floss and moved on. My whisperlite broke - I made a stove out of a pineapple can and a paint can that burned pinecones and it was often better and easier to deal with. My silnylon tarp burnt up one night and now I use cheap camo tarps cut to 4 x 7 and barely notice the weight difference.   I've seen a fair few ""aspiring nomads"" end up using the 'gear' line to delay their date of hitting the road. Gotta get my $500 setup (that might get stolen and will definitely wear down within a year)! Fuck that. You wanna travel? You can get what you need in a week's time at most if your eyes are peeled and you've got $0 to $100. Hell, my pack got locked into a squat once (learned my fucking lesson) and I was traveling for a while with a blanket, a knife, a steel mug, a trashbag, and a lighter rolled up on my back with some rope. It was freeing in a way that these huge, ""luxurious"" setups just don't seem to provide. I've found a decent middle ground, I think."
vagabond,35fv7k,_drybone,13,Sun May 10 00:16:24 2015 UTC,"Sometimes cheaper is better, sometimes it's an illusion. One thing I'll never cheap out on is boots.

If you have to replace those wally world kicks every couple months, they really aren't saving you anything (especially not your feet)."
vagabond,35fv7k,_drybone,3,Sun May 10 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"There's always a lot of discussion about boots, and I agree, cheap Wal-mart boots aren't the best, but I've gotten some good use out of Herman Survivors, which Wal-mart sells.  Brahma boots are less satisfactory, but at least they're cheap.  Actual high-dollar hiking boots are less attractive to me because of the expense, but if they are fitted correctly, they are the best choice, of course.  For durability and toughness, though, it's hard to beat military surplus boots.  They last and last and last.  I paid $65 for the last pair  I bought..  That was about four years ago or so and they're still truckin'."

vagabond,35fv7k,ictbob,2,Mon May 11 01:32:50 2015 UTC,"With the Modern Army, they have stuff in smaller sizes now, because there are a lot more female soldiers.  Where military boots in size 7 or 8 used to be difficult to find, today it's easier.  Fit is everything.  Don't forget, try on boots wearing the socks you will wear ON THE ROAD.  If you are gonna wear two pairs of socks, then try on boots with two pairs of socks.  Then remember, carrying a load, your feet will SWELL and your feet will FLATTEN OUT.  Take that into consideration.  Do you need arch support or inserts?  Buy them beforehand  and use them when you are trying on boots, along with your sock situation."

vagabond,35fv7k,Digimad,3,Sun May 10 12:25:42 2015 UTC,"Tyvek (construction weatherproofing--it goes on the outside of the studs, etc. before you nail on exterior plywood, siding, etc.) is actually pretty good material with which to make a ""sleeping bag.""  A couple of blankets and a big piece of Tyvek (say about 8-1/2 feet x 8 feet) folded over to make a ""taco"" and the bottom and one side taped with duct tape about halfway up makes a pretty good sleeping bag when paired with a couple of good wool Army blankets.  This is kind of a version of the ""air bag"" sleeping bag.  The only bad thing is that Tyvek is stark white with great big Tyvek logos printed on it.  It shows up bad at night.  I make water jugs out of Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice bottles.  They are made of Type 1 PETE  (polyethylene terephthalate)  recyclable plastic, and it is tough as hell.  I reinforce the plastic bottle with a piece of tough cardboard or Masonite on the bottom, and wrap it in a couple of layers of duct tape, then spray-paint it a dark color (dark green, black, brown, dark blue, etc.) because anything light colored shows up bad at night.  I also put a loop of nylon strapping through the handle, so I can loop it around my wrist and not have to carry it with my fingers.  I reinforce the bottles so that when I gently drop them off a slow-moving train from which I am about to debark, they are less likely to get holed and leak.   (I wear a dark bandana at night when I'm snooping and pooping through the yard, too, because I'm Caucasian and your face will show up brightly at night.  In the Marines we wore cammie face paint, especially at night, but that's too weird when you're in town, to have the remnants of green/black/loam face paint on when you go into the supermarket or somewhere.  (White Marines put on green and black, the black guys put on green and loam, which is kind of light-brown-dirt colored.)  Also, if you run into any railroad workers they would shit themselves if you were wearing cammie face paint.  If I know I'm about to be discovered, I pull the bandana down so my face isn't concealed.  It's scary enough to discover trainhoppers hiding on your train, the less frightening you appear to be, the less likely they are to turn you in.)"
vagabond,35fv7k,AesirAnatman,2,Sun May 10 23:41:15 2015 UTC,"Does tyvek take dye? Maybe you could run it through the washer with a double dose of black dye?    Could you use mylar for the jug? It has excellent insulating properties and is quite thin. (doesn't the jug get heavy tied to your wrist?) I picked up a cheap camelbak and an extra bladder and I figured to carry a couple small water bottles.  My problem is weight. Just the empty rucksack, tent, and sleeping bag are like 20 lbs. With my cooking gear and a few tools that's already 30 lbs...then clothes and food and water...I'm pushing 50lbs...I just don't know how far I can walk with 50lbs on my back.   Am I overthinking it?"
vagabond,35fv7k,AesirAnatman,2,Mon May 11 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"I never tried to dye Tyvek, so I don't know.  I kind of doubt it, it's moisture resistant plastic ""fabric"" designed as a vapor barrier for the building construction trades.  I'd be surprised if any kind of water-based dye would affect it.  Paint, maybe, but that's too much hassle for a tramp.  Most tramps would just use it ""as is"" without trying to modify it.  Even duct-taping the bottom edge and half the open side would be too much hassle for most tramps.  I just use a brown tarp from Wal-mart.  Eight bucks, IIRC.  I am a trainhopper more than a hitchhiker, although I do both at times.   My orientation is catching out, and to do so effectively at my age and physical condition, I am forced to travel light. To me, fifty pounds is too much gear, but I have a friend who routinely humped 65 pounds and up.  In the Marines, the basic combat load was 66 pounds, and then they started adding stuff on.  (The average age of the Marine Corps is 19.  And they are in excellent physical condition.)  Jarheads are basically pack mules with a buzz haircut and a rifle. I'd say pile all your stuff on the lawn and start with Maslow's Theory of Needs. At the bottom of Maslow's pyramid, oxygen.  Are you going trainhopping?  Where?  If you go west, through Colorado, Montana, Idaho, that means tunnels.  Tunnels mean diesel smoke.  You can get by with a wet bandana and the inner sleeve of your jacket for a field-expedient respirator, but it's pretty unpleasant.  A Mine Safety respirator or a military gas mask would sure be welcome, if you are clean shaven.  If you have a beard, it degrades the effectiveness of the mask, but it's still better than a wet bandana.  (Wierdly, diesel exhaust contains very little poisonous CO (carbon monoxide---Google it) but this is not true of gasoline engines or coal-fired/ oil-fired locomotives.  Both of those both produce tons of CO.  Mine Safety respirators screen out CO, but of course they do not add O2 (oxygen.)  Diesel smoke contains a very unpleasant chemical called ""aldehydes.""  Humans are very sensitive to it (it STINKS) but it is not very poisonous.  You'd have to be in diesel exhaust for many hours for it to kill you, although you would probably be barfing your guts up from the stinking aldehydes.  Not very many tramps carry a gas mask.  But it wouldn't be a bad idea, although digging through your pack to retrieve it from under all your other shit in the dark would be pretty unpleasant.  Okay, next, WATER.  Water is top priority.  You MUST have it.  You cannot go for more than three days without water without dying.  You seem to have water covered pretty well.  I take at least one gallon, per person, per day, no matter what, and TWO gallons if I'm headed west of Dallas/Ft. Worth or so, where it's hot and dry.  Water weighs 7.8 lbs. per gallon, so that's 15.6 lbs. right there, about one-half of your load.  A backpacking water filter would be great, but they are $$$ expensive as shit.  However, they are WORTH EVERY PENNY if all you've got available to drink is ditch water.  Never pour out your jug until you are ABSOLUTELY SURE your new water source is drinkable, potable water.  Screw this up one time, and you will never make this mistake again.  Next, SHELTER and CLOTHING.  Take a summer hat and a winter stocking cap everywhere you go.  Ditto a jacket or coat, better with a hood, even in summer.  And leather gloves.  (I use trucker's gloves/ railroad gloves; I don't like ""Mule Shoe"" type leather+fabric farm gloves.)  In winter, insulated work gloves from someplace like Tractor Supply. (I like to froze my ass off one August in Iowa at the National Hobo Convention.  Trust me.  Take a coat.)  I carry one set of extra underwear/t-shirt (maybe two), lightweight trousers (like Dickie's, etc.--- not blue jeans) and lots of socks,. preferably wool socks or wool/synthetic blend.  You will change socks frequently.  Riding trains, you wouldn't change clothes much/ever.  Wash one set of skivvies, wear one set.  Yes, it's dirty.  Yes, it's stinky.  That's trainhopping.  Wash clothes when you get somewhere.  You need a good sleeping bag or bindle.  A good tarp or some kind of shelter like railroad plastic or a flattened-out air bag.  I don't like tents much, too hard to fight your way out of one.  I don't zip a bag shut in summer, same reason.  In winter time, it's too cold, you have to zip it shut.  If you start out with a tent, pretty soon you stop setting it up, then you realize you're humping it and not using it, but you don't want to ditch it because you paid $100 for it, etc.  Sometimes I weather rainstorms rolled up in a tarp.  If it's not a freakin' hurricane, I usually don't get too wet.  If it's real bad, I look for shelter., like an overpass or an open boxcar on the RIP track or something like that.  Do not take shelter under a TRAIN, for obvious reasons.  (They could move it, and kill you, duh.)  Getting wet sucks, but it's not the end of the world.  You'll dry out.  FOOD--you need stuff that is lightweight (like ramen noodles, trail mix, peanuts, crackers) and also stuff that is edible uncooked from the can (Spaghettios, pork and beans, beanie weenies, sardines maybe.)  The traditional hobo meal, mulligan stew, is rarely seen these days, if at all.  Most tramps fly a sign, then buy something from the dollar menu at McDonald's.  But since there's no McDonald's on a train, you'd best bring something you can eat straight from the can.  If you have some kind of stove, you might try cooking on a train, but the vibration and slack action make this pretty much impossible.  For hitchhiking, it's only limited by what you're willing to hump and whether or not your ride will cooperate.  I carry a gunboat (coffee can cook pot) a stainless steel bowl, fork and spoon, belt knife, and insulated plastic coffee cup.  Sometimes I make coffee cups out of tin cans, a piece of hollow (copper) tubing and copper wire just for the pure hobo-ness of it.  People spend a lot on cook gear.  I don't think it's really necessary, but out West you will need a small backpacking stove because in many ""forest fire"" states open fires are illegal..  This is the basics.  Other stuff (radios, GPS units, iPhones, laptop computers, musical instruments) all just adds to your load.  The problem comes when you are sick of humping it, but you don't want to shitcan an $800 computer.  Do you REALLY, REALLY need it?  Strip down your gear to ABSOLUTELY BARE ESSENTIALS.  Then start pitching stuff.  Take a few test cruises around your city/town/part of the state.  Anything you don't use, leave it at home/ sell it/ donate it/ give it away."
vagabond,35fv7k,AesirAnatman,1 point,Mon May 11 02:12:37 2015 UTC,"I grew up in an auto mechanics shop so I did know that about diesel exhaust. (Knowing what to pipe out the door in winter is important when running vehicles)   I already have a green rip-stop tarp for under my tent and I picked up a cheap tarp at wallmart that compresses really small and weighs about a pound. I have considered a hammock instead of a tent but I live in Kansas so I am all too aware of not having available trees.   I don't really plan on hopping trains but I'm not ruling it out.  I may at some point want to get somewhere quickly but my starting out goal is just the journey.   Clothes wise I may be overdoing it.  I still need to pare down my list.  My need to be prepared is overwhelming.   Water I think I have covered.  I also have a small pump filter and purification drops.  But I don't plan on going through the desert either.   I've spent what professional career I've had as a lineman for the cable company.  So being outside in bad weather is not unknown to me.  You haven't lived till you've been on a 30 foot ladder grounded to miles of wire in a lightning storm.  If god wanted me dead....he had his chance.   You know the original mountain men never changed clothes.  They would just add layers as the old layers would decay away.  Makes you wonder how they snuck up on anything. ;)  Food is something else.  I'll probably be carrying a couple days food and hitting dollar stores/dumpsters as available.  I don't see myself flying a sign or anything like that.  I may tri wwoof or similar.

vagabond,35hf8r,egodrop,3,Sun May 10 11:49:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, as /u/defau2t says, hitching is way easier when you're in south Florida, and hitching doesn't take any $$$ either. You also won't end up getting busted, arrested, losing your limbs, going the wrong way, etc etc.  Also, if you've never hopped trains, don't do it alone. Find a trainhopper to help you. That is a MUST.  In addition, read the trainhopping articles on the sidebar, and do some other research if you ever attempt to hop alone. Checkout the trainhopping forum at STP and do some real research into this."

Sustains-food & water  Clean water, how much is needed minimum and a comfortable amount. Water is not the same quality  It is here.  Food-  what will be foragable? Thing like bread is eaten all over so no need to carry that. I suggest lots of enriched rice, cans of chopped chicken and canned veggies. All non perishable with long shelf life. Dont say MRE ""s or it will be one constipated stinky bus lol.   Supply  Gas- no shit right? But is our bus gonna hold enough fuel from one station to the next?  Need some one to get ""recon"" on the route. Quality of fuel, will they gouge us for being tourists?  Oil-air filters- oil filters- fix a flat& and or spare  Sanitation   40 people taking a shit can cause problems for people not prepared for it. Thats a bunch of shit paper as well.

I feel like he did a kind of Bob Ross thing for vagabonds. His story inspired a lot of people and brought the lifestyle to a larger group of people. At least he wasn't Thoreau or London who just sat around and speculated ect. I agree the idea that it inspires is overly romantic though. If you're interested in a better constructed and more realistic view of life outside of society I highly recommend checking out Harlan Hubbard especially the book ""Shantyboat: A River Way of Life"" Hubbard wasn't a vagabond but he was a man who lived completely off the grid and my personal inspiration."

vagabond,35bvj8,Ezraah,13,Fri May 8 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the denial of information is a form of exploration and adventure itself.   Jon Krakaeur writes about McCandless:   ""In 1992, however, there were no more blank spots on the map—not in Alaska, not anywhere. But Chris, with his idiosyncratic logic, came up with an elegant solution to this dilemma: He simply got rid of the map. In his own mind, if nowhere else, the terra would thereby remain incognita.""   The issue I take with your first comment is that it seems like you're making absolute judgments on a very subjective ideology. That's your personal opinion, and I respect that, but consider that parallel arguments can be made for plenty of the lifestyles of the members of this subreddit, or the vagabond lifestyle in general.  For one to enjoy a journey, there must be some parameter of unknown, and that parameter varies greatly from person to person. There will always be more information freely available no matter how much you learn, and eventually you just have to say 'fuck it' and go with what you've got.  McCandless decided to go with very little, and intentionally so. I can respect that, even if it cost him his life. Men have died for worse reasons."

I can kind of respect what he was trying to do, by throwing away the maps so the wild would be ""wilderness to him,"" but he was really bad at taking sound advice from people who actually knew what the fuck they were doing. What if McCandless had been a sailboater rather than a land-based wanderer.  Would we all be saying, ""Oh, he was totally cool for sailing off into the Pacific without any charts or a compass or even knowing how to sail, or to fish, etc?""  No, we wouldn't.  We would expect him to LEARN HOW TO FUNCTION ON A SAILBOAT before ever weighing anchor.  He walked forty miles out into the Alaskan boondocks with nothing but a .22 rifle, 400 rounds of ammunition and a couple of bags of rice.  That is some stupid ass shit right there.  If he had just brought some TRAPS, he probably wouldn't have starved to death. McCandless isn't the only one, by far.  There have been a whole litany of dumb asses who went out into the Alaskan boondocks and starved to death.  One guy had a bush pilot fly him out into the mountains and then realized he had forgotten to tell the pilot when to come back and pick him up.

While I agree that a lot of his freedom-actions were maybe not thought out the best they could be, there is possibly more to the story. And, that extra part of the story might make folks take it easy on the whole ""McCandless was an idiot and nothing more"" parrot speak. Take the story for what it is.

vagabond,35bvj8,dasii,1 point,Sat May 9 04:53:26 2015 UTC,"Well at first I read Walden by Thoreau, which chronicles his time spent living in a small house he built himself. He lived very spartanlike with very few commodities. In the book he says ""Many of the luxuries and so called comforts of life are hindrances to the elevation of man.""   I then read a couple of essays by Tolstoy in a collection called Government is Violence, in which he condemns the indirect usage of violence in order to force people to pay taxes and obey their laws. He also talks about how the State in a way enforces conformity  and how freethinking is condemned.   Then I read the Way of Zen by Alan Watts, which gives a history of Zen Buddhism and the philosophical movements that inspired it.   The major point of this book is that the past is nothing but memory and the future is nothing but anticipation, and all that truly exists is this very moment. Zen is often used as a way to kind of reverse the cultural conditioning of our youth and helps one to see reality for what it really is, without looking through the lenses of preconception and prejudice.   Im currently reading an essay called Self-Reliance by Ralph Waldo Emerson, which talks about how an individual needs to be comfortable and confident in his own beliefs and dreams and not allow others to shame you into following their way of life.  So far what Ive gotten out of all these books is that we take so much for granted, and that without seeing what it is like to have nothing we can never truly appreciate having something. Also, most people slave away at their jobs and careers only to afford a certain level of comfort. Many put their extravagant lifestyle over their leisure time. If you work for just enough to survive, you will have much more free time to do whatever you like. I plan on using this free time to read, write, meditate, and experience all this world has to offer. Im hoping to spend a year or two just hitching and trainhopping around America, affording just enough to survive, and visiting each of the major national parks and hiking in them."

On the other hand, it's probably a lot less dangerous for a newbie than riding freight trains if you don't wind up dead of heat exhaustion somewhere.

I've traveled via car around that area before and feel it'd be far more hospitable than risking the diamondbacks, scorpions and heat that lie West TX.

All of a sudden he looks at me like I was going to kill him or some shit, and I noticed his eyes were looking behind me. Turned my head around and there was a brown bear standing about 30-40 feet away from me, staring right us. If the bear had decided to charge me, I would have been absolutely fucked. We slowly started walking backwards parallel to the creek, and the bear just looked at us like we were a mere curiosity. He lowered his head and started pawing at the stump of a tree that had fallen over, I guess he was pawing for worms or grubs or something in the wood. Anyway we just kept walking backwards, and it never poked its head back up at us again. Got in the truck and decided to find another spot to fish.  Once while I was spear-fishing at Kealakekua, Hawaii, I was circling the bay looking for schools of fish, and suddenly I looked down and their was a Sand Shark napping/resting at the bottom about 15-20 feet below me. The shark was about 8 feet long, definitely big enough to scare the living shit out of me.  Black-widow spider crawled onto my hand while chilling out at the hobo camp/jungle in Colton, California. Looked down and it was crawling up my wrist. I freaked the fuck out because I hate spiders, and I successfully shook it off my arm.

Pretty amazing to see that. I've never seen wild buffalo.   Wandering primarily around California means snakes. I was doing a survival course, of all things, and I was told to be barefoot and blindfolded - and follow a rope through a trail. I took a step, and the ground started moving. I ripped off the blindfold and saw my foot directly on top of a snake. Naturally, I freaked the f*** out, but he just kept moving. Probably pissed that I stepped on him. I think it was a California King Snake. He wanted nothing to do with me.   When I was a pre-teen, I was hiking with my dad and our Saint Bernard - eastern central California. I heard a rattle at top volume that I will never forget. This snake was pissed. Our dog started to get too close, so my dad shot it. I was a kid, animal lover, bleeding heart...etc. I was upset my dad shot it. He just said ""it was either him or us"", cut the rattle off and gave it to me. I still have it. I try to avoid them, but if it's a choice of who lives and who dies... If I had the same encounter without my dad today, I don't know what I would do. I also have a dog to worry about.   More snakes in Florida, water moccasins and big black snakes. Luckily, none have tried to lunge. Yet. I fell into a swamp with a known moccasin presence. I have never swam so fast in my life.   I guess snakes are my main threat. Other than that, mosquitos. Eff them. I drench myself in tea tree oil, and now they avoid me. Tea tree oil is a necessity in my pack.   Oh, and sharks. Being a surfer, it's always in the back of my mind. I was in the water with a Mako, and was caught in a rip tide at the same time. I nearly exhausted myself to death getting out of it.

There is no promise of safety in life.  That being said I have on two occasions almost watched a person die while on moving trains. Its no joke whether new or a seasoned pro.

Otherwise, Ms. Beninati probably would not have survived.  I listened to an online recording of the nurse's (edit: EMT's--I thought it was the nurse) 9-1-1 call, and it was awful, with the EMT repeatedly shouting at would-be rescuers trying to move the girl away from the tracks, ""DON'T MOVE HER!  DON'T MOVE HER!"" and Ms. Beninati moaning and crying in shock and pain in the background, it was horrifying and agonizing even to listen to.  Every person who thinks that catching a moving freight train might be a good idea needs to listen to that 9-1-1 recording.  DO. NOT. CATCH. MOVING. TRAINS.  911 Tapes Reveal Horror Of Train Accident, Victim Identified  September 6, 2011 5:00 PM  train crossing 911 Tapes Reveal Horror Of Train Accident, Victim Identified Longmont Train Accident (credit: CBS)  LONGMONT, Colo. (CBS4) – A Colorado State University student suffered horrific injuries after apparently attempting to jump aboard a moving freight train. On Tuesday authorities released a 911 call from a former emergency medical technician who was passing by as the incident happened.  The accident happened just after 1 p.m. on Monday in Longmont.  Police said the 17-year-old victim, identified as Anna Beninati, along with her friends, three males ages 17 to 20, were in Denver earlier Monday. They were later dropped off in Longmont to try and catch the train so they could get to Fort Collins. Beninati apparently tried to hop onto the train as it moved northbound about 18 mph on the tracks, but in her attempt she slipped and fell underneath the train causing it to run over her legs, which were severed at the knee. Former EMT Nicole Crowley and Nurse Kathy Poiry happened to be waiting for the train in their separate vehicles when the accident happened. They jumped to action when they realized Beninati went under the train. Crowley immediately called 911.  “Don’t move her, don’t move her,” Crowley can be heard saying to others at the scene on the 911 call.  911 Dispatch: “Longmont 911, what’s the address of your emergency?”  Crowley: “Oh my God. I’m on 3rd Avenue at the railroad tracks. Somebody just tried to jump on the train and severed her legs.”  911 Dispatch: “You can probably do more help than anyone else there if you’re an EMT, okay? Let me know when you’re with her.”  Crowley: “Hang on. Hang on.”  911 Dispatch: “They’re on the way, they’ve been on the way since you’ve called.”  911 Dispatch: “Do not tourniquet, do not tourniquet.”  Crowley: “She’s awake.”  911 Dispatch: “Is she breathing?”  Crowley: “She’s very, very, very pale … she’s alert, she’s talking. Now she’s trying … don’t move! Don’t move!   Fire (Emergency dispatch) … there’s two fires (firefighters) here now.”  911 Dispatch: “Okay, I’ll let you go then. You talk to them, okay?”  Poiry said, as she tried to hold in the blood,  Beninati was alert and talking, asking if she was going to live.  “I just kept trying to keep her with us. Like, once she closed her eyes and I just yelled at her to open her eyes and she did and she was awake and talking the whole entire time,” Poiry said.  “All I did was I just got down next to her and I said, ‘Hi, what’s your name? How old are you? Where are you from?’ I was trying to keep her alert and talking,” Crowley told CBS4’s Mike Hooker over the phone. “I just knew if we could control the bleeding maybe she’d stay alert and she’d stay with us and we could keep just enough blood in her body so she could survive.”  Police said one of the young men, who is from Broomfield, did manage to get on board the train, but they have not been able to find him.   Another one of the victim’s friends also was able to board the train, but the 17-year-old suffered minor injuries after he quickly jumped off.   His identity isn’t being released because he is a minor.   He and another friend, identified as Charles Hamilton, 25, of Gillette, Wyo., who did not board the train, were ticketed for trespassing.  Beninati was airlifted to Denver Health Medical Center for treatment.  Beninati’s parents live in Sandy, Utah. Beninati was listed in serious condition Tuesday evening.  “From the first responders, to the hospitals both in Longmont and Denver, we are thankful to everyone who came to her rescue,” Beninati’s family said in a released statement. “We are especially grateful to several bystanders who provided aid for our daughter at the scene.”  The three males are not CSU students.  Police said alcohol and drugs weren’t involved."

Nobody is going to tell you what to do. People will actively discourage you because your bumbling could get other riders caught. Also you could die, but who cares about a statistic? You should not do this. You're a small thinker, I mean you could get a job for the summer and save up enough money to tour SEA or South America but who wants to leave the country when you can spend the hottest part of the summer waiting on trains in Texas, NM, and AZ? Riding in a giant metal box when it's 120 sounds deadly. Seriously, forget trains unless you make friends with some experienced riders. What about other options?  CCC, WWOOF, Work a way, Church Missions, Wildland Firefighting, Merchant Marine, Cruise Ships, Fishing in Alaska, anything in Alaska, etc? Call your Mom, she loves you. You can bicycle or hitch hike across the country.  If you play your cards right you won't look like an undesirable vagrant and will attract less police attention. There is a magical freedom machine called a motorcycle and you might really enjoy taking one across the country. And you can still die!"
vagabond,35c82z,Teardownstrongholds,3,Sat May 9 00:47:01 2015 UTC,"this person. listen to them.   train hopping right now has started to become a huge fad. i dont deny that i also would like to do it,  but it is plain and simple not worth the risks. it is not this glorified idea that people are portraying. it is really difficult,  and you are very likely going to get hurt.   If you wanna travel on a dime,  hitch hike with a friend, some pepper spray and a knife. it's slower,  but you're a lot less likely to get your legs chopped off. Or get a moped.   I dont mean to discourage you. Go travel. go out on your own and live your life. But you need to live.. and not paralyze yourself.  In addition, many people in the train hopping/migrant worker/homeless communities have a lot of issues that can be a risk to your personal safety. I'm not trying to scare you,  I'm speaking from experience. Obviously not every person you come across is going to be a nut job,  but it just comes with the territory. People that have fallen through the cracks end up in these communities. You should not just disappear leaving a note. You are young and inexperienced and vulnerable. It is just a reality that you have to accept.  Just don't do it!"

Second of all, you're young and inexperienced,  you'll need their help if you ever get into a situation you can't get out of. Do this right, man. Gather information BEFORE you leave.

vagabond,35c82z,OhMyGoat,2,Sat May 9 11:37:46 2015 UTC,"I live in Houston, too, but it is against the rules of Reddit, I think, to just publish an internet address or a phone number and say, ""Call me.""  I recommend that you start camping/hiking/trainwatching locally in Houston for awhile without ever trying to catch out.  Houston is a big city.  There is plenty of adventure right here, and plenty of risky situations to be in without going anywhere.  Do you know anything at all about the rail yards, movement of trains, crew changes, etc. that are right here in Houston?  Get a Houston city map and a yellow highlighter.  Carefully highlight every rail line in the city (there are lots, Houston has a long history of being a rail hub.)  Near every major rail yard, and many smaller rail yards, there are hobo jungles, catch-out spots, nearby bus stops, groves of trees, freeway overpasses, etc. where both homeless people and trainhoppers hang out.  Identify on the map places that seem like a natural spot for a jungle.  (i.e. there is a yard there, there are major rail junctions close by, there is a railroad ""wye,"" there is (or was) a yard tower there.  (In most cases the actual tower has been torn down and there is only some foundations.)  Significant spots are places where there was once a signal tower before CTC train control was introduced.  The big yards are patrolled by the railroad special agents (the ""bulls"") and in some cases, Homeland Security.  Since 9-11, a significantly increased amount of railroad security has been introduced.  The larger yards, Englewood Yards (Tower 86) on Liberty Road. Settegast Yards, Casey Yards, Basin Yards, New South Yards, Manchester Yards (Tower 30) (especially Manchester, it is the lead-in throat to the petrochemical plants along U.S. 225 going east through Pasadena and Deer Park----major SWAT-type security) and others.  Do not trespass on railroad property in the daylight.  At the very least you will get a ticket.  You might get arrested.  ""The night time is the right time.""  Bring bug dope.  Washington Street and Congress Yards (east of the downtown baseball stadium,) and the surrounding area are crawling with sketchy homeless people and have a lot of missions, Salvation Army residence places, the Loaves and Fishes soup kitchen and so on.  A major UP subdivision (the Glidden sub) runs north and south between U.S. 90 (South Main) and the east-west feed to Hardy Yards and Congress Yards.  There is a hobo jungle (the ""Eureka Hilton"") north of I-10 and Memorial Park on the north-south line between West Junction (at U.S. 90) and Eureka JCT right off of Washington where it turns into Hempstead Road (Tower 13.)  All these places are sketchy as hell.  Englewood Yards and the Settegast neighborhood are in Houston's  Bloody Fifth Ward.  Watch your ass around there.  Third Ward too.  Dangerous as fuck.   Basin Yard has lots of security because it serves Port of Houston, which is itself crawling with Homeland Security guys.  If train crews see you, they may very well call it in to the bulls.  It's summertime.  It's hot.  There will be a million mosquitoes everywhere at night.  If you want to ""experience life,"" I suggest you try the hobo life by trying some rough camping right here in Houston.  Maybe hitch down to Galveston.  Summertime in Texas is a tough time to be on the street.  Buy a bus pass good for a month (it's cheap, maybe $32) then learn the bus routes, where they go, and how to get from one place to another without using a car.  Every major rail yard but two are accessible by bus and maybe a short walk.  If you take a car or truck, it's easier in the short run, but then you have to leave your car or truck sitting out somewhere where people can see it.  (I used my pick-up truck when I used to reconnoiter rail yards, but several times I found either local gangsters or cops checking out my truck, so I started using the bus.)  North of Houston, in the town of Spring, there is Lloyd Yards.  It is where the radio dispatcher for the entire south Texas region is located.  Needless to say, it has a couple of bulls.  Lloyd Yards is huge and runs north-south for 2-1/2 miles.  On the north end are several switches that lead to lines going to various other Texas cities.  There is a huge overpass going over the yards, but there isn't any dedicated pedestrian walkway.  If you go up there you are walking on the ""shoulder"" where the bump strips are.  I'm not sure if it's legal to walk on it or not, but I suspect the cops would tell you to get off of it.  There are also some great bars/restaurants in Spring.  There are Houston METRO buses that run to Spring, but I'm not sure where one catches them.  You can learn a hell of a lot just by walking around with a map and a compass.  Remember, NEVER, EVER TRY TO CATCH A MOVING TRAIN."

Anyways, here's a couple of my favorites of his stuff: US Highball - about a hobo's journey from California to Chicago And On The Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma    Its crazy hard to find live shows of this stuff now, since there are very few people in the world who have the instruments to be able to play it, but NewBand and MusicFabrik are two ensembles I've heard of that are trying to play his stuff as it was meant to be played."

I always was a walking panhandler - as a moving target I got next to no hassles. If I flew a sign, I'd make it the most artistic sign I could, and in fact I might have fun trying this sometime - go out with a bunch of humorous signs and just have fun. Probably donate the money to charity since I don't need to panhandle these days.   OK so that being said, polite panhandling pays! I always asked just once, always said thank you even if it was 11c or a ""fuck you"" lol, I was cheerful, upbeat. I'd work up one side of a street like say University Avenue in Palo Alto then down the other side, then pick a different street like say California St. in the same town. I did not panhandle inside establishments.   The most giving people were working class, although once in a while I might get a $40 tip from some high roller.   It increased my ""faith in humanity"" - at least working class humanity - 1000X."

vagabond,34vhn6,cdycwl,3,Mon May 4 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"Trespassing is usually a misdemeanor, and very few states will extradite you for a misdemeanor.  However, if the local cops are looking for a reason to screw you around (read: if you GIVE the cops a reason to want to screw you around)  they can jail you and hold you for misdemeanors committed in another state.  Since they know that the jurisdiction where you were charged considers misdemeanors a very low priority, you will probably either get released or wait weeks for the jurisdiction where you were charged to get around to coming to get you.  And you may not get credit for time served while waiting for transport. For sure if you get carded for I.D. again in that same jurisdiction you are going to jail.  Cops and courts HATE bail jumpers.  And jumping bail is a much more serious offense than simple trespassing.  My advice--pay the ticket."

vagabond,34uavx,SunsetRoute1970,2,Mon May 4 23:19:33 2015 UTC,"I have encountered younger trainhoppers a couple of times who were travelling with 20-inch BMX style bicycles on freight trains.  It's a hassle, but once you get where you're going, you have a bike to ride!  Another way to do this is to either buy or borrow a bike once you arrive somewhere.  Way back in the day I knew some anarchists who were inspired by the Dutch ""White Bicycle"" movement and would fix up bikes and then paint them white and just let anybody who needed it take them.  They kept showing up in pawn shops though.  Because stupid people are just stupid and you can't fix stupid."
vagabond,34uavx,anywhereness,2,Tue May 5 02:26:25 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:  Put a Shimano freewheel on it (about a tooth or two lower). Then find some cheap used rear racks and some cheap/free backpacks. Strap your luggage on the racks in some home made pannier bags and just pedal. Sometimes you'll need to walk up hill, no big deal with the bike carrying your luggage.  Get a lift where you can, but you can easily make 50 miles a day in the saddle without much real exersion."

And I don't have a rack or anything on it, yet (I may get one in the future) but I do have a Gregory pack that I load all my crap in. It is great for hiking and general traveling but I am not sure what to do when I am on a bike. Should I just ride with my hiking pack on since i have no other way to strap it to my bike? That seems like my back would be killing me by the end. I will likely be trying to get out of here next week or so, so I have time to figure out the details."
vagabond,34uavx,terriblemothra,1 point,Wed May 6 00:44:00 2015 UTC,"A cheap aluminum rack can be had for $10 or less... Just poke around. They're good enough to get started, just use quality hardware to attach it.  Instead of the big backpack, try two smaller bags. ex: some whatever cheap canvas ones from an army surplus store. You can get these bags for $5-10 each. Or use empty cat litter boxes. (Google it)  Additionally, you can strap things to your handlebars really easy and cheap. $5 in straps and you're set.  If you want fenders, they're easy to make with some crappy scrap plastic and ziploc bags. Free if you scrounge it all.  So, for ~$30 you can have your bike ready to get pedalling and are now a bicycle touring vagabond. Rock it out."

So who knows.  On the other hand, those straps on the front look awesome and have me thinking about what I could strap there. Maybe my sleep ""kit.""

The only trouble is local laws and waste disposal. 1 the laws for every place varies greatly, and this kind of floating domicile falls into a lot of grey areas of the law, so it's very easy for a CO to fuck with you. And 2 you really shouldn't be dumping you shit ( both literal and figurative) in bodies of water, it just makes it gross for everyone, and actually there is very stringent regulation on what companies and cities can dump in.

I also don't have a car nor can I afford one...a huge reason I did this is because of money problems.  I was going to end up homeless in my rural town so I figured to take control and see if I can turn things around Last time I attempted I hurt my ankle and couldn't walk on it for a few days!    I say I suck at it for a few reasons....because unless you have the money to do so, you're pretty much winging it. .  Suggestion, hitchhiking in rural areas is a bad idea...or in my experience, it is.  Its much tougher to get people to take out out or even give you a ride.  Butler tends to be mostly socially segregated and the entire county is rural....so its a few miles of literally nothing but countryside.  I walked 30 or so miles to highway 65 and hitched to tusky and worked on this mans farm for 100 bucks...I ......then after 2 weeks...I came back cause of a family death.   What is your motivation?  Ask yourself this...if you stayed where you are, will life get better?  Will you be the carver of your destiny?   Will you forgo pride and do what it takes to survive, to be something bigger than yourself?  If so, then spending hours sticking your thumb out hoping someone stops you and gives you a ride will be worth it.  Your feet will get tired!!!!  Even if you get over that mental block....it is still a dangerous thing.  You are going on practically blind faith and you need know who you're riding with.   Carry protection.  A knife.    You will have sleepless nights and you will have really shitty days.  But you will also have a purpose every time you wake up.     But I am just one guy.  I haven't had a bad hitchhiking experience except this one girl I was semi interested in.  Turned out she was into vampire bdsm and wants to suck my dick literally blood dry.  I noped the hell out of there!  It's best to have a traveling buddy.  I kinda wish I did...but there was a couple of places I wanted to go!   I'm traveling to find a place to call home."

I've thought about it for a few months now, the only way i can keep myself out of digging into a hole that won't let me travel at all is traveling with the bare minimum. I've got a destination set, but from now until August or September it's going to be prep and pack. Sell what needs to be sold, hopefully find a travel buddy and pack out.   It's all i really want out of life anyway, if i can get by fishing, selling my homemade lures and working jobs out there to support myself I'll be content. Just so long as i can fish."

Only difference is some people are...uncomfortable picking a black person up.  And don't get me started on police harassment.  One time this cop stopped by me, asking where I was going....I said I was heading to eautaw...he started prying into my life....asked for my ID...I showed him.

For a completely green guy, this is both equally terrifying...and equally freeing.  I smell...I look disheveled...my feet are on fire...and walking feels like forever.  But I've learned 3 things.     Oatmeal and peanut butter sandwiches are cheap lifesavers when you're hurting for cash.  The less you carry the better  Some people can't find an office to complain about, so they hit the road to find where they belong.   I saw your article in Newsweek.  Good stuff, but I think the article failed to represent or make note of those that decided to travel this way because there was nothing for them at home...for some, it is an adventure away from the usual...for others, its sheer survival and an attempt at their own life.  Everyday more and more people lose their jobs and become homeless.  You have made a life out of it.   That takes real skill  I'm still very unprepared and my shoes are worn out!!! But nothing traveled, nothing gained.  Maybe one day...traveling alone can be scary and lonely, but if you survive, you can go anywhere you want, and I just happened to wanted to visit some friends, if you know what I mean...I'm heading to eautaw to see a gf...then I'm gonna make some money in a few lawn care businesses, head to Tuscaloosa, get a tix to Huntsville, get my laptop I ordered from a friend...and go from there...  I'll need to be in contact with wwoof...as per suggested in Huntsville reddit page!      Wish I could have traveled with ya though.  It can get lonely!"
vagabond,34kxlv,megasoarus,10,Sat May 2 01:37:27 2015 UTC,"Be prepared to be scrutinized. Most ""traincore"" kids dislike outsiders. Especially college students on their summer breaks. They will label you as a trustafarian, summer bunny, oogle, greenhorn, or whatever... If trains are not your lifestyle and you are just seeking a summer thrill I suggest you reconsider.  If hopping trains don't fuck you up then the drunk, agro, homebums, or crusties will. Seriously be careful out there and travel with someone you can for sure trust. Always travel with a clear mind, don't get wasted or get pulled into the drug scene. Be strong and always go with your gut. It's not all sunshine and rainbows. You most likely will get dirty, wet, smelly, cold, hot, bored and be miserable as fuck at one point or another.   All in all, I would highly recommend hitchhiking first. It tends to be less demanding and safer then hopping trains. That way you can get acclimated to living on the road and paying attention to your surroundings. Also, you will most likely get introduced to the train hopping world through the people you encounter, that's just the way it goes usually.  Either way good luck and safe travels!"
vagabond,34kxlv,hichet,2,Sat May 2 05:35:14 2015 UTC,"Also, you will most likely get introduced to the train hopping world through the people you encounter, that's just the way it goes usually.   Yes, this. It's better to make a friend you feel safe with than find some random rider to train trains to a couple random prospects.  And don't ask about ccg if you're already looking for an experienced rider; it'll just make you look like more of liability."
vagabond,34kxlv,SunsetRoute1970,3,Sat May 2 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, yes, travelling with a guy who is big enough and tough enough to defend you is a good idea.  On the other hand, your post somehow conveys the idea that you are a ""outdoors"" kind of girl who enjoys camping, hiking, running as a sport, and could get interested in something like Tae Kwon Do.  I strongly advise you to try out the lifestyle first by doing some hard times camping.  (No cheating, now.  This is a learning experience.)  Start with the basics (ruck, sleeping bag or blanket bindle, cheap/free Salvation Army cook gear and some clothes you are willing to sacrifice to the Road Gods.)  Camp out somewhere you are not actually permitted to camp, like a grove of trees near a railroad yard, and restrict yourself to just the items you brought with you.  (There are no convenience stores in the middle of nowhere.)  Rain, storm, sleet, whatever, you can't go home until your test period is up (48 hours, 72 hours, whatever.)  You must cook in the open, no restaurants, no fast food.  You must take care of all body functions right where you are.  Your restroom is a bush.  (Don't forget toilet paper.  Dig a hole and bury your poop.  We are not barbarians out here on the road.)  Your shower is a baby wipe, and then a washcloth and water from your jug.  Take plenty of water, at least two gallons per person, or one gallon per person, per day.  Keep in mind, your job is to hide from the police, the railroad special agent (the bull,) and dangerous homeless people.  Observe (from cover) the movements of trains.  Become comfortable with moving at night, learn to use whatever objects are around you for concealment.  Try to determine where the trains that stop near your camp site are going.  You are thinking, ""Why should I do all this crap?  I just want to have fun riding trains.""  Because 90% of riding trains is just like this.  Hiding out, dirty, uncomfortable, hot, sweaty, tripping over shit in the dark, lugging a bunch of heavy crap like sixteen pounds of water, plus your ruck, plus your bindle, all over creation while you try to figure out what in hell is going on with your train.  And no, I'm not trying to discourage you.  But if this lifestyle doesn't seem like fun, well, draw your own conclusions.  People paint a romantic, ""hip"" picture of trainhopping.  Ask the kids that caught the wrong train and wound up in inner city Detroit by accident.  They got kidnapped by a gang.  The boys were shot and the girls got gang raped.  Not every day is this bad, but hopping trains is no picnic. On the other hand, the real danger is not in getting hurt or getting arrested.  The real danger is loving it so much you never want to stop.  I first hopped trains in 1970.  It's harder to quit than smoking.  I know more than one kid who dropped out of college and decided to be a hobo instead, so be warned.  Once you start, it's hard to stop."
vagabond,34kxlv,huckstah,2,Sat May 2 17:08:28 2015 UTC,"Are you hopping trains because you just want to hop trains? No offense, but nobody just starts off hopping trains because they look at it as some summer adventure or something. Most of us hop trains after being on the road for many, many months, and we usually turn to hopping trains for personal reasons.  I think you need to figure out hitchhiking first...actually, I think you need to figure out to be homeless period, learn the ropes, and only hop trains if its necessary.   Once again, no offense, but doesn't sound like your hopping trains out of necessity, OP. Sounds like a summer vacation before Fall classes start, and that's the type of people that end getting killed on the rails."
vagabond,34kxlv,ththth3,9,Sat May 2 06:47:53 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I started, you don't have to be impoverished or living on the streets for months before realizing that train hopping is a free, adventurous, rarely seen way to explore our country. Please don't try and tell people that it's some secret society you have to be jumped into or something. If a kid wants to take a summer to train hop and experience life outside the campus I say go for it. You're young, mobile and there's no reason not too try it"
vagabond,34kxlv,SunsetRoute1970,6,Sat May 2 15:51:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I can think of a few reasons  that give one pause for thought.  1.)  It's illegal.  The last ticket I got, in Boone, Iowa, would have cost me $350.  Fortunately we were not actually on a train when we got busted, because we would then have gone to jail, or so the arresting officer said.  The cops were pretty cool, though.  They directed us to an undeveloped part of a city-owned park right next to the tracks and told us we could camp there for a week.  We caught out the next morning at 0300.  The district attorney dropped the charges, for which I was grateful.  2.)  There are a lot of people riding trains who are criminals, rip-off artists, drug addicts, alcoholics, bullies and entitled little shits who think they have some right to mess with people whom they don't happen to like.  Forewarned is forearmed.  If you ride trains, be prepared to defend yourself, and strictly avoid obviously fucked up people.  Do not carry a gun, it's a serious felony if you get caught trespassing on railroad property with a gun (criminal trespassing vs. simple trespassing.)  A legal-length knife is okay.  Practice knife fighting with a stick or something.  What really protects you is the obvious willingness to do some serious harm to an aggressor.  (""You may get a steak, asshole, but I'm going to get a sandwich."")  These assholes are attracted to weak, helpless potential victims like a magnet.  Don't be vulnerable.  3.)  Being on the road, away from normal creature comforts wears on you after a while.  Trains are filthy dirty.  You have to constantly be looking for sources of clean water.  You cannot trust every faucet/ water source you see--they are not all potable water.  Never pour out your jug until you know FOR SURE that the water source is good.  You are cooking out in the open, in all kinds of weather.   Sanitation is difficult.   Some people (especially women) have a problem taking a dump or urinating more-or-less ""in public"" in a bunch of bushes or something like that.  There is very little ""privacy"" on the road.  Everything you do is more-or-less being done out in the open.  There may not be anybody around, but having some railroad worker walk up on you while you are changing clothes or bathing with a baby wipe is disconcerting, and could be dangerous for a woman or girl.  4.)  It's a little dangerous.  Trains move unexpectedly, especially if you don't understand the noises they make.  Slack action results in a certain amount of injuries among careless train riders.  Getting on or off a moving train is very dangerous.  Imagine trying to jump into the back of a slow moving pick-up truck, or jumping out of one.  It's somewhat like that.  The ballast (the gravel under the tracks) will skin you up bad if you take a tumble.  Obviously, if you seriously screw up and go under a train you will be killed or horribly maimed.  (Google Colorado girl loses legs while trainhopping.)  6.)  The incidence of tuberculosis (and drug-resistant TB) and all STDs, especially HIV is much higher among transients and homeless people than among the general population.  Keep your distance from strangers.  Uganda was actually partially depopulated by HIV in the 1980s.  At the height of the epidemic, the rate was 4% (4 out of 100.)  The HIV rate among homeless American teenagers is 12%.  It's a shocking and sobering statistic.  7.)  People on the road who are not middle-class ""tourists"" have bottomless unmet needs.  Do you have some food?  They need it.  Do you have water?  They need it.  Do you have alcohol?  They need it.  Do you have tobacco?  They need it.  They need EVERYTHING.  And since you are rich and they are poor, you should just give them what they need.  Oh, you don't want to share?  You bourgeois bitch!  We should just TAKE what we need, you tourist!  Understand?  They think you owe them something.  You don't owe them shit.  Be prepared to defend yourself.  On the other hand, if you meet people you can trust (which is not an impossibility at all) they probably already know a lot of the skills and knowledge that you need.  It may seem like a very fair trade-off to share some of what you have in order to garner the skills you need.  The guy that taught me to hop trains had food stamps, but no cash money for alcohol or tobacco.  I bought the Boone's Farm and Bugler, he provided the food.  You have to use common sense.   When somebody tries to make friends they are not ALWAYS trying to rip you off, but that possibility needs to always be in the back of your mind.  You need ""street smarts.""   You need to be able to read the situation.  Are you the only woman present?  Are the men drinking and using drugs?  This is (obviously) not a good situation.  NEVER LEAVE YOUR GEAR WITH ANYBODY ELSE.  Wherever YOU go, your gear goes WITH you.  EVERY TIME.  It is unreasonable to think you can trust people you barely know who have enormous unmet needs.  ""Whatever you have, they need it.""  8.)  There are some things that you NEVER ""share.""  Things that are so essential to your survival and well-being that you cannot do without them, things that you never allow anybody else to examine or ""borrow.""   The classic example is the, ""Hey, new guy, cool scanner.  Let me see it for a minute"" routine.  Do not hand over anything valuable to another person.  Cell phones, iPhones, radio scanners, GPS units, anything like this is very valuable to tramps and very difficult for them to obtain.  It's a lot easier to ""hog"" you for your cell phone than it is to go earn the money to buy their own.  When you ask for your scanner back, they say, ""What scanner?  You mean MY scanner?""  NEVER hand over your KNIFE (or any other weapon) to anyone else to examine.  ""Wow, awesome knife, Jane.  Let me check it out.""  Once he has tossed your knife out the boxcar door, then he says, ""Okay, now let's talk about you giving me some pussy.""  You cannot depend upon conventional social norms on the road.  There is no Law in your boxcar, unless somebody in there with you enforces it.  Being on the road is like semi-anarchy.  You are on your own, in virtually every way, unless you are part of a crew.  A member of a crew pretty much shares everything.  Understand?  Everything.  There are mostly decent, honest people riding trains, but there are always the few who are predators.  If you join that world, you must be tough enough to deal with it.  In many ways, it's like prison.  A woman or a girl (or an effeminate gay boy) is better off with a protector, unless she is one bad ass chick.  Are you bad ass enough to ride alone?  Because if you do ride alone, you had better be prepared to defend yourself--whatever that takes."

I personally don't view it as something that only should be done out of necessity. While I agree doing it for a ""summer thrill"" is not for the right reasons, I don't think wanting to trying to convert to a simple/freer lifestyle is a wrong reason, and not everybody wants to completely commit at first, they want to dip their toes in just a little. I agree starting to hitch might be a better way to start, but if someone is a complete train nerd (like myself), how can you blame them for wanting to start with trains (talking about myself again)?! As long as they properly prepare themselves and don't approach the sport lightly, and as long as they didn't just come up with the idea yesterday, I don't see a problem.

That said, his book is a good one, and has made him a nice piece of change, which was the whole point of writing the book in the first place.

vagabond,34kxlv,TheWarlockk,1 point,Thu May 7 18:12:43 2015 UTC,"I also don't think train hopping should be marginalized and I support Duffy LittleJohn for making that apparent. I'm seeing middle class people want to break away from how they were raised, etc., and just getting hate from it by the community. Just because they're middle class doesn't give anyone a right to tell them they should stay middle class and not try and make a different in their life and way they are living. Maybe train hopping isn't a good start, but I think they should be supported just as much as anyone else."
vagabond,34kxlv,SunsetRoute1970,2,Thu May 7 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"The reason the tramps don't want trainhopping to become popular is because they know that if it becomes so, it will ruin it for those that are already into it.  More people catching out means more injuries, more police, more anti-trespasser measures and so on.  Some of Littlejohn's basic premises are very questionable--he is trying to sell books, so he sugarcoats it and tries to sell trainhopping as a ""sport"" for bored young hipsters.  How many books that tell the truth do you suppose he would sell?  I hope they all just decide to start rock climbing or parachute jumping, or spelunking.  ANYTHING but hopping trains.  Any endeavor that becomes ""popular"" inevitably become gentrified, exploited and eventually, co-opted, pussified and emasculated.  Rich people start holding ""executive adventure trainhopping conferences"" and concerned mothers start demanding laws requiring safety equipment--forty years later the 1948 Hollister Riot becomes ""H.O.G.S."" with middle-aged executives dressing up in black leather and cut-off jean jackets, weekend Harley-Davidson warriors tooling down the highway in their millions.  White water rafting in the 1950s was dangerous as a motherfucker.  Today, you have people taking their grandmother down the Snake River along with their elementary-school-age children.  The first attempts to climb Everest cost a bunch of serious mountain climbers their lives.  Now we have thousands of tourist climbers trudging up there every year, and hauling their tons of garbage off the mountain is a big problem. This same phenomenon showed up in the Richie Rich ""New Left"" revolutionaries of the 1960s.  The Weathermen and their ilk were all the sons and daughters of extremely wealthy people.  They used to joke that you couldn't get into the Revolutionary Youth Movement II (RYM II) unless your parents made more than $250,000 a year.  Nobody was going to tell those dumb asses that they couldn't be a revolutionary, by God.  If some dirt-poor clod in Uruguay could be a communist revolutionary, well then well-educated students from Harvard damn sure could too.  After all, we are IVY LEAGUE communists.  We can do whatever we want.  As long as the people riding trains and getting injured and killed are ""nobodies."" then the Nanny State won't give a damn.  But the first time a Patricia Hearst or a Chelsea Clinton loses her legs under a train we will be covered up with Federal laws crushing trainhopping.

If you go out looking for real trainhoppers to train you, and you have never lived on the road, much less hitchhiked for an extended time with some miles under your belt, they are likely to laugh/cuss you out of the jungle.

And then, when you cook your rice, put the ramen flavor packet in it. It fully absorbs into the rice.  Also masa harina, the mexican corn meal is great to have around. Makes an awesome breadding for fish. You can make areppas, which are like bannock corn bread.

vagabond,34inqq,JimboJimWV,30,Fri May 1 14:03:11 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, reaching all the way back to Dionysus and Jesus, the ""transient street philosopher"" has been alive and well. I was about 12 when I was convinced I'd do something like that. I'm from a squalid backwater country town with very little economic activity of any meaning (aside from Wal-Mart distribution and NYS prisons, and fuck those jobs). Tried some college but couldn't stay pinned down. Mom and stepdad broke up, sold the house, moved away, and I dropped out of college with no money and a lot of dreams about traveling. My path, then, was obvious.  I've been an anarchist since I was 14, meaning, the abolition of systemic social hierarchy has generally seemed to be the most attractive thing to seek out. Over time, it has become clear that most people don't care enough about things like ""social hierarchy"", no matter how it effects them, and are content with the society they find. Even if they say otherwise, the fact that they continue to be loyal to that society's interests suggests to me, that like addicts, you can't force them to give it up. I can do a lot for my addicted friends, but at some point, it's on them. And they ain't biting. So I drift around and make this dying world a playground. I write poems and have wild conversations with people from all sorts of backgrounds. When I talk to people, my only goal is to shake them out of their current way of thinking, and I'll say anything to do this. My friend called me an ""idea artist"" the other day, which I thought was hilarious and accurate.  I respect what the beats did back in the day, the Kerouacs, but think that today if any revival of that ethos exists, it is a sort of stripped down, more intense version of those ideas, contextualized by climate change and financial collapse. The oblivion of the 90's intermixed with the desperation of the 30's and the apocalyptic overtones of the 40's, with the internet to boot.   As far as whether the world owes us anything, I don't think anyone owes anyone anything unless they perceive themselves to. I'm a nihilist. I think some already see it that way - the ones who give me a bed, a ride, a $5 bill or a coffee and chat with me for a while. Outside of that, like I said, most of the masses love the whip. They don't want whatever we're pushing, however nicely it might add depth to their human experience. We ain't gonna save the world. We might as well play with it and huddle up together with those with a thought in their head and a feeling in their hearts, you know?"

I propose instead of reforming the industrial system that we instead live in the temporal breakdowns of the state's capacity to inflict its will on us, nomadically moving between them.

I have tried to share many of its posts with /r/Tramping. Feral Jesus is kin.  I agree with /u/negroyverde's assessment of Jesus as tramp philosopher, but before the Nazarene was Diogenes of Sinope, and before him the Taoist hermits of China. Stephen Graham, whose books on tramping I find most beautiful, describes the tramp as ""the wandering hermit"", so wilderness hermits may, I think, be considered tramps. They (e.g. Hanshan) did influence Kerouac and the Beats generally, also mentioned by /u/negroyverde.  What do you make of the view of Novatore as tramp philosopher, /u/negroyverde? His frequent use of the word vagabond gave me cause to think of him as one, or an aspiring one, in the fashion of Alexander the Great saying, ""were I not Alexander, I would be Diogenes""."

Wow dude if you're into Renzo and you're a tramp, damn. We should ride. Anyhow I feel certain he must've lived a vagabond-like lifestyle at times, given that he is said to have gone ""on the lam"" being pursued by the state for his various crimes. More importantly, unlike even some real vagabonds, he was intellectually a vagabond, never certain of anything but his own existence, never a dogmatist. Can a sedentary person come to such a conclusion? I sincerely have my doubts."
vagabond,34inqq,SunsetRoute1970,7,Fri May 1 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"I don't classify myself as a philosopher by any stretch. But I've made some statements to this subreddit before that barely scrape the surface of my ""philosophy"" of living (I'm not particularly taken with the word). But there are several others I've seen on here speaking of very well rounded beliefs and philosophies. Then there's those who are just good, wholesome people.  Chances are that no modern thinker, writer, philosopher, or whomever will take to a platform to deliver their thoughts, let alone be heralded by the masses, because it goes against the narrative of the way of living we've been sold. They'd more than likely be demonized and juxtaposed to communism, socialism, or any system or class that contrasts the sense of patriotism that's been so carefully sewn in to our hearts and minds. I'm of the thought that change sweeps most effectively through individuals anyway. In my experience people lash back pretty defensively when conversations like that are on the table. When people mention ways of life that don't involve the fancy corner office, a big expensive house, sharp wardrobes, capitalism, monetary systems, etc. and are instead centered around simplicity, (true) freedom, peace of mind, and to be a part of something more than themselves, people take it rather personally. They feel that they themselves are the ones being scrutinized. To no fault of their own really. It's all they were presented with throughout their whole lives, how were they to know something different could be obtained? Sure, they had the same resources any of us have had, but maybe they lacked the drive? The curiosity? The string of events that lead them to the thoughts? Maybe they're too scared to question themselves, the masses, or the ""official"" story. There's a lot of variables to take in to consideration. So all you can really do is speak to the point they're willing to listen to, or that they're curious about. It's not our position to change people, only show that it's possible to change. No matter how well put and sincere the words, no matter how enticing the stories, no matter what the evidence they see, they must be willing to seek it out on their own."

Is owning a home in the suburbs, getting married, having 2 kids, and working 9-5 until you retire then die a better lifestyle than vagabonding?   I think that different lifestyles suit different people. Some may find the above mundane capitalist lifestyle to be suitable for them, others prefer the freedom of vagabonding. There certainly are many people who end up with either lifestyle above involuntarily to their great misery, but for some their lifestyle is a choice and is existentially fulfilling."
vagabond,34inqq,negroyverde,1 point,Fri May 1 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"A person can objectively live a better life. Better foods, medical care, shelter, entertainment, and a wider access to knowledge is available to some and not others.    For instance, a man decides to live in Alaska. He has plentiful access to fish, big game, and shelter. He has books, he has community, and he might even have internet. His body has access to plentiful nutrition, he learns enough to contribute to the knowledge of the people around him, and he is well off enough to live into his 80s.                   Lets compare Alaska man to a victim of child abuse. Timmy gets so hungry that it hurts. Timmy is suffering from depression. Timmy has a mean step dad that hits him sometimes. Timmy gets bullied. Timmy dies of a drug overdosage at 26, alone in his apartment.  Objectively, Timmy didn't have as high of a quality of life as Alaska man. Without mental illness or drug usage, it would be physically impossible for Timmy to experience the happiness that Alaska man did.           While emotions are somewhat subjective, there are some objective aspects to emotion.  Better food is related to people experiencing better emotions. Better entertainment is related to people experiencing better emotions. Better medical care is related to people staying alive and getting to experience their emotions longer. These are all products of society and more of them are earned by working as a cog of society.                      Now I know what you're thinking. Life is meaningless, right?  Experiencing better emotions means nothing doesn't it?        Absolutely.                                              In spite of this, shouldn't we strive to be happy?            Yes. I know your answer is yes because you want to be homeless.                                Now, if both of these things are true, wouldn't the most responsible way to live your life be in a way that optimizes how happy you are as well as the people surrounding you?                  Noone says that if you're not homeless that your only other option is to get married, have two kids, and work some shitty job until you're dead. Your only limits are your own creativity and abilities. And besides, objectively speaking, having a family and a job can lead to a person experiencing good emotions, depending on a few variables.                           Now, with all this in mind, shouldn't our goal as a society be to create a better society for the people of tomorrow to experience more freedom and better emotions? Is the engineer who works his life away on building rockets to send us to space a misguided robot? Is the guy who flips burgers and keeps other people well fed and happy wasting his life if his life is worth more in happiness to other people? I think that sacrificing some of yourself in exchange for society is the most sensible option, and there is also that some happy medium of exchange for this exists. In fact, a way to contribute a shitload to society and be happy is probably there if you look hard enough. Actually, I imagine that there is happiness that cannot be achieved without working with society.             There are other ways to experience freedom outside of homelessness. I'm saying that homelessness isn't the optimum choice."
vagabond,34inqq,SunsetRoute1970,1 point,Fri May 1 20:40:42 2015 UTC,"I suppose I should have made myself more clear. I was not referring to standard of living when I was talking about lifestyles. Timmy's standard of living is low compared to the Alaskan adventurer and this can be an objective metric but it's not what I meant by lifestyle. Lifestyle is an existential process, standard of living is circumstance.  Timmy may have grown to be a damn good welder in his adult years before his unfortunate end. His lifestyle was sound for him and he enjoyed what he did, but owing to his traumatic life, his standard of living made his life miserable despite his fulfilling lifestyle.  In many cases, lifestyle and standard of living go hand-in-hand. A homeless man may be less likely to procure food, leading to a higher chance of having a lower standard of living. But nevertheless a multimillionaire Wall Street banker who has everything may still be unfulfilled because of his lifestyle.   Noone says that if you're not homeless that your only other option is to get married, have two kids, and work some shitty job until you're dead.   Of course not, but there is a strong societal pressure to do just that. Why would. I want this? Would I really want to have a dull albeit comfortable life as a cog in the machine? I want to experience as many different things as possible and sometimes that's outside the comfort zone.   shouldn't our goal as a society be to create a better society for the people of tomorrow to experience more freedom and better emotions?    This simply is not how I think. I'm an individualist anarchist, not a utilitarian - I don't want society to expect things from me and I don't want to expect things from society. Why should I make sacrifices for the supposed (not objective) betterment of future generations? By taking an existentially dead job so I can help oil the gears of capitalism so that future people can propagate and continue this cycle? Utilitarianism neglects the personal identity and aspirations of individuals for the authoritarianism of the collective - we shouldn't be viewed as cogs for a societal engine.  No thanks. I want to further my own life, not this socioeconomic system. Besides, I have long since abandoned the idealistic views of progressivism and I have little interest in seeing what is in society's best interests.  Is vagabonding the optimum choice for a lifestyle for me? I don't know. I'm at a time of experimentation in my life and I have a thirst for adventure, so why can't I try different things? Maybe getting that 9-5 job is for me after all, but I want to try these things out before making leaps of faith. However I am viewing vagabonding as a potentially viable lifestyle just like working as a lawyer or some other profession despite society's negative outlook on it. In essence, I am looking at the lifestyle to see if it's good for me as an individual and care little of what society at large views the unorthodox."
vagabond,34inqq,runescapethug,1 point,Fri May 1 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"In many cases, lifestyle and standard of living go hand-in-hand. A homeless man may be less likely to procure food, leading to a higher chance of having a lower standard of living. But nevertheless a multimillionaire Wall Street banker who has everything may still be unfulfilled because of his lifestyle.     I fully agree with this. What I don't agree with is that being a hobo is ranked so high on fulfilling lifestyles, its treated as a holy grail of ideas around here. With homeless people experiencing a lower standard of living, its pretty much impossible for it to be one of the top 10% of options to choose from when living your life, as there are probably routes out there that have both a high standard of living and a good lifestyle.    As a side note, you have to take into account that the millions of dollars of stimulation that the wall street man provides to the economy may increase the standard of living of other people to an amount that negates his own misery.               Would I really want to have a dull albeit comfortable life as a cog in the machine? I want to experience as many different things as possible and sometimes that's outside the comfort zone.                This could just as easily be ""I like learning and haven't found a job that satisfies me yet"", you have more in common with the academic/working class than you may realize.                                  Why should I make sacrifices for the supposed (not objective) betterment of future generations?   Because working with society is mutually beneficial. You gain, and so do others, so more is gained than possible alone.  As to why you should worry about the people living tomorrow, well, thats up to you, but don't use your selfishness as an argument for homelessness. There are much better ways to be selfish from within society. You can manipulate women, scam people, find a pseudo-cure for cancer, whatever. Choosing to be homeless for only self-gain is like saying you just haven't found a better way of self-gain yet. Besides, my original point was that this is a selfish philosophy, so if we're in agreement here than I guess this is over.                   By taking an existentially dead job so I can help oil the gears of capitalism so that future people can propagate and continue this cycle?                Yes the zeitgeist is an issue, but if you truly disagree with the way people are living, than working from within society will allow your voice to be heard more vocally (as you are now, posting on a public forum)  and your impact to be larger             idealistic views of progressivism           Increases in the standard of living due to productivity in society is not idealistic daydreaming, it has happened and is happening."
vagabond,34inqq,negroyverde,1 point,Sat May 2 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"That's a fair argument. But we didn't ask to be part of this society or cultural grasp. So why do we owe ourselves to contributing to society when we could instead contribute to humanity as a collective on an individual level? Society expects something from you and allegedly you're indebted to it. But what is society? Which begs the question, what is it you're really contributing to and is it really all that noble to do so? I see no real benefit to anyone from contributing to an intangible entity that 1.) isn't working toward helping itself and 2.) is corrupted by a myriad of vices. Personally speaking, it seems more practical to contribute to the people if you really want to contribute to something. Prototypical presumption is to contribute via resources, i.e. money. But why not cut out the middle man? Why not work on a local farm growing products that will be distributed to local markets which in turn are directly distributed to the people? Why not contribute your time to volunteering at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter? Why not contribute to bettering yourself as a human, so that you can better humanity as a whole? Why is contributing to ""society"" the more suitable way of life? Society is merely a thin veil to disguise the fact that it's made up of us, the individuals. We feel obligated to the masses and in the worst way. As I said in my previous comment, I think change is most effective at the individual level. I see no reason to throw money at a government owned by businesses who in turn tell us how to live and that we should contribute to ""society"" like a well-behaved citizen (only to turn around a grow their wallets while passing on the most minimal amount they can get away with to anything except something that that will really bring change) and say ""Hey, here's my money. I hope you do something good with it."" Why not shed the superfluous things from your life and contribute directly?  Side note: Hopefully that didn't come off abrasively."
vagabond,34inqq,runescapethug,0,Fri May 1 20:19:26 2015 UTC,Its kind of a selfish philosophy though.   All philosophies are. The question is whether we're the ones benefitting or if some other egoist benefits instead. I owe no society anything.

I was asked whether I had applied for ESTA, whether I had any drugs, why I was coming into the U.S., how long/where I'd be staying, those kinds of things. For what it's worth, I don't think anyone on our bus was denied entry. If you are denied entry, you'll probably be on the next flight home (but that's just a guess). It might be smart to say you'll be backpacking instead of being a vagabond though. No reason to lie, but there's also no reason to make going through borders more painful than it needs to be.

If your answer to that question is yes, I do have some things I can recommend. First, I happen to know of a lot in Dade County, Florida, that sells old school buses for like $2,000, which is as cheap as you'll find for old school buses.  Second, I know two people who run a place in Broward County, Florida, called I Love Yoga Studio. They have a bus which they decorated, refurbished the interior, and pimped out to run on vegetable oil. They may be interested in participating, you could search for I Love Yoga Studio in Davie, Florida, or I'll send them a link to this thread. They'd be into this.  Another thing is Project Nuevo Mundo. They are permaculturists who drove a bus from San Diego to Panama at the end of 2013. They, too, have a bus and will likely be interested in this project."

vagabond,34cvnh,Digimad,23,Thu May 7 07:47:50 2015 UTC,"All right Noobs, you want to buy a bus?  You want to tear up a bunch of the seats and put in bunks, and a kitchen, and a bathroom, and everything else?  GOOD FUCKING LUCK.  I've converted 2 short buses over the past 4 years.  The first was a friend of mine's, after he bought one, I bought my own.    Reddit Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/1khhv0/i_spent_all_summer_turning_a_retired_school_bus/ 2013 Album:  http://imgur.com/a/2HquV 2014 Album:  http://imgur.com/a/giqBA  First piece of advice is to hop on craigslist and find a bus that’s already done, or close to what you want.  My bus has cost me about $12,000 over the last few years which is about how much a complete bus sells for.  Mine is short, and doesn’t have a kitchen, or plumbing, or 120v outlets, or anything like that.  Mine is seating and party roof only.  Seriously, one of the biggest regrets of pretty much everybody who has built a bus from scratch is not buying one that’s already done.  Second.  While doing your google searches, look up “ACTIVITY BUS”  or even better “PRISON BUS”  Both of these buses have built in storage in the under the floor boards. A Prison bus has a bathroom built into it already.  Storage is a major problem on these trips.  Cabinets suck to build and everything goes everywhere when the bus drives down some janky ass road.  Third.  Cupholders for the driver.  Make it happen.  Forth.  Keep the bunks near the floor, side to side rocking for sleeping.  Fifth.  Parts for this thing are going to cost more than the bus itself.  If you guys find a good deal, you’ll get a decent low miles bus for $3,000.  My shorty cost $2500, and I had to replace the batteries and alternator right away ($500).  I found some spare tires for $20each on craigslist, new they go for $200+.  Thank god nothing major has gone wrong on it yet, and the day it does, I’m sending it to the scrap yard.  This isn’t a car, this is a heavy piece of industrial equipment.  Basic things that break will cost 2-3 times as much to fix.  My friend had his radiator crack on his bus, it was $3,000 to repair.  If that shit happens when you’re in the middle of the Yukon, have fun paying for the shipping on top of that.  All in all, it’s FUCKING AWESOME owning a bus and going on trips with it, but it gets super expensive.  I see you guys asking about needing a CDL.  You don't need that.  Once you register it at the DMV, reclassify it as a motorhome.  You're also not using it for commercial purposes."
vagabond,34cvnh,Thenamethatismyname,10,Thu Apr 30 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"You are talking to people who live out of rucksacks YEARS at a time. If the bus is 100% empty think everyone would be fine with that lol its just a mode of transport, no kitchen, no bathroom it just needs to drive thats it.    You paid a diesel mechanic the 75$-150$ an hour labor rate to repair your bus I am sure and that is the primary cost in the repairs.  I just put into a auto parts search radiator for a Bluebird 1990 diesel bus and it was 298$ bucks. I have striped Jet's sure I can change the radiator, with that being said simple radiator leaks can be fixed with putting table pepper into the system, The pepper will plug the leaks like a scab. JB weld is also a option if the whole is larger then what pepper can scab over.  The only thing that would be detrimental would be if something inside like a rod or cylinder problem where the whole top end gaskets and such would have to be removed. I am sure I could do it, but it would be a bitch with out the proper tools."
vagabond,34cvnh,Thenamethatismyname,6,Thu Apr 30 16:07:45 2015 UTC,"reclassify it as a motorhome.    Which means that anyone behind the driver can have open containers while the bus is in motion, according to a ride I got in Olympia, WA!"
vagabond,34cvnh,Digimad,5,Thu Apr 30 21:58:27 2015 UTC,"...Sort of.  It varies from state to state.  And even though it is legal in Washington, local municipalities can overturn that rule in their jurisdictions at their leisure."

We could always try to indiegogo fundraiser and buy a Vagabus, that would be awesome so we could paint some sort of awesome color.  http://www.bendsource.com/binary/7b6d/f1eba2c7bcd5ebb53a0a339662f7f625_large.jpg  Whos got the kool aid :D  would have to spend some time  Panama my father is from there, no I do not speak spanish lol I got a couple of skills Was a aviation mechanic in the Marine Corps if I got a manual I can fix it.

vagabond,34cvnh,2xws,4,Fri May 8 06:21:44 2015 UTC,Where were you thinking about getting a bus from? A bus auction?
vagabond,34cvnh,Hobo_Hero,6,Thu Apr 30 03:49:29 2015 UTC,"Just look for the best deal honestly I use a program called searchtemptest that crawls sites like ebay can craigslist that list stuff for sale. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg1mjruY6W0  Thats a youtube video showing some of the Rvers and Vandwellers how to use it.  Check this out I found with a quick search http://norfolk.craigslist.org/cto/4965666822.html Something like that is great could be built to suit, Bunk beds are great so we can hot seat drivers if need be.  With a Bus in the USA we may need someone with a CDL of some sort to drive till we hit ol mexico."
vagabond,34cvnh,Hobo_Hero,2,Thu Apr 30 04:15:49 2015 UTC,That bus is exactly what we need.
vagabond,34cvnh,tru_wanderlust,3,Thu Apr 30 04:24:39 2015 UTC,"Yup slap some Solar panels on the top, with 4 deep cycles so we can charge electronics and etc we are good to go. Batteries are prob going to be one of the more expensive items.  Some things to be thought out would be 1) who to register and what state to register it in. 2) Insurance so we can get in and out of the USA 3) Are we for sure going to need a CDL for traveling in the USA if so we need someone to take a class or test to get it."
vagabond,34cvnh,Hobo_Hero,4,Thu Apr 30 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"We could just pay by the month for insurance...probably only needs 3 months of insurance, which would be around 200 I'm guessing at the most.  As far as registration, I guess whoever helps pay the most would naturally want to register it to their name.  On another note, we could also find a cheap camper trailer, and just tow it with a truck that someone would dedicate to the trip...I'm sure we can find someone with a truck willing to volunteer for this.  Who knows. I love the bus idea, but I'm also open to anything else. I'm going to try my best to contact some people that might can help us finance this, fingers crossed. Otherwise, it's going to be all on us.  The biggest hurdle would be the price"
vagabond,34cvnh,tru_wanderlust,4,Thu Apr 30 04:48:19 2015 UTC,"Now that you got this idea in my head... Thanks huck lol. I started researching it we will also have to pay to have any rides shipped across the Darien Gap, Its around 1k from what I have been reading.  http://www.drivetheamericas.com/node/481  If you know anyone willing to finance ask them to go indiegogo,  bet we could get enough to float a Bus and solar set up. Seen full time RVers pull 6k to just take a trip and record it.. We set up perks for people, like t-shirts, cards, let the view any content we record before the public like private screenings, maybe like a return gathering where we meet up with people and have a party. I know most people would hate this, but maybe some Corp sponsors and let them plaster names on the bus."
vagabond,34cvnh,EuropeanSun,2,Thu Apr 30 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"Yep I'm aware of the Darien Gap and ferry price...  Just found a bus that supposedly runs good for only $1,900:  http://mobile.craigslist.org/cto/4983128611.html"

Lets fucking do this! PLEASE hmu via email bro.  I'm lingering in Canada 4 months prior before departure we can sort out my share of $$ then for the bus or fuel whatever, I'll feel more comfortable handing over physical cash opposed to via the internet!"

vagabond,34cvnh,the_broccoli,2,Thu Apr 30 15:45:08 2015 UTC,Emailed. (Y) I'll communicate via email from now on (:
vagabond,34cvnh,ickaprick,4,Thu Apr 30 15:51:15 2015 UTC,I am really really interested! I know that retired school busses can be pretty cheap (few thousand bucks) because the camp I work for bought one a few years back from a public school system in Vermont. If you guys want more details I can call my buddy who actually made the purchase. If I remember correctly he said the schools need to get new busses for regulations or something so they have PLENTY of them that are old but still good. Another thing is that we would need to figure out is visas - maybe/probably you can get them on arrival but it's worth looking into. When would you guys wanna go?
vagabond,34cvnh,kingbooga,3,Fri May 1 02:53:00 2015 UTC,"As long as we stay for less than 90 days in each country, there is no need for a Visa. Atleast that is what I've been told thus far.  I would really love to get in touch with your friend! I'm familiar with the state bus auctions, but I'm sure your friend will have some really, really useful advice since he/she has already been through that process. Is there anyway you could get me in touch with them?   Also, perhaps you and your friend would like to come, and we could use their bus!"
vagabond,34cvnh,peacefinder,3,Thu Apr 30 09:12:38 2015 UTC,"So we couldn't use his bus because it's not really his but it belongs to the summer camp we work at, he just bought it. I will contact him and see what he says, I don't think he would be cool with me giving out his number (he's in his 40s and is the type of guy who is skeptical of the Internet as a whole) but If I could convince him to come along it would be epic. He is a licensed bus driver and expert mechanic. Would be a tough sell but MAYBE I could convince him to come. I'll get in touch with him and get back to you"
vagabond,34cvnh,ljlf,5,Thu Apr 30 09:19:49 2015 UTC,"We definitely need a guy with a license and bus mechanical experience. Let him know its for a good cause, and that it will be an absolutely amazing adventure. As driver, he would not be obligated to working on the farms or volunteering..his sole job would be captain of driving and mechanical issues. We will have a relief driver for him as well, and more people that can help him with motor issues."
vagabond,34cvnh,TheEyeDontLie,2,Thu Apr 30 10:25:56 2015 UTC,I will do everything in my power to get him to come along but he's finicky and can be stubborn. Would departure be in the fall? I spoke to some friends and they said you don't need visas for North America but after Mexico you do. They said they are about a hundred bucks a pop and can be purchased on arrival
vagabond,34cvnh,aweeby,4,Thu Apr 30 10:31:36 2015 UTC,Oh man I'd love to go but I'm stuck on the other side of the Atlantic. I know a fair bit of Spanish as well so I could of helped out on that front. If I ever manage to get some money together I'd love to fly over but I bet it'd be a fortune.

vagabond,34cvnh,Digimad,2,Thu Apr 30 12:11:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, are you from the UK? With a British passport you've got the Visa waiver option so you're kinda sorted there. Flights wise I came across flights from London to Anchorage, Alaska for around 400-500 bucks for September. Work somewhere and save up till then. The British pound goes a long way with it's it exchange rate (£1=$1.53). As Huck said, make it happen! I live in England so possibly we could get a flight together."
vagabond,34cvnh,EuropeanSun,2,Thu Apr 30 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"Hmm I think I'll try to see how much cash I can come up with. Looks like the flight changes at Frankfurt so it'd be possible to hitch out there first to save some cash (flights look like £250-300 then). This is seeming like a better idea by the second.  Fuck it I'll find a way to make it happen, I'm coming"
vagabond,34cvnh,pan_demonium,2,Fri May 1 11:36:07 2015 UTC,Yes man! I'll be in Romania for a couple of weeks at the beginning of August and then I'll hitchhike my way towards Frankfurt. pm me to exchange details

vagabond,34cvnh,Digimad,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:21:54 2015 UTC,The Darien Gap on foot or bicycle? Can it really be done? I heard it's dangerous and full of drug traffickers. Do people do it?
vagabond,34cvnh,A_95,1 point,Thu May 7 22:35:54 2015 UTC,"only adventurers. I think the biggest threat would be nature though. mosquitos and weird parasites, getting lost or stuck in the bush, no clean water, etc."
vagabond,34cvnh,hichet,3,Tue May 5 14:55:16 2015 UTC,I would love to go on this trip. I feel like I could Learn a lot from all you guys together like this and it sounds like one hell of a trip.   But sadly I am not well versed in the vegabond lifestyle and as such only have a few skills I can bring to the table. I have had a few years experience as a hard scape landscaper and as a residential electrician. Both of which would only really be helpful with the community projects. I however do have both the time and willingness to learn a language or skill if that would be required. I live in Washington state and should be right along the way.  Money would be an issue for me. I could try and get a grand saved by then. Maybe a little more if I really cut everything. I'm not sure how much you are looking for everyone to have.  I'd like to learn more about the logistics of this and if you think I'd even be a suitable candidate. I also may know of someone else who would be even more excited to go than me. She has a little more experience than me and I think would be a great addition to the team.  Please pm me. I'd love to hear everything I can about this and maybe talk to see how I can make myself both prepared and more useful to this adventure.  If this really is happening I'd love to be a part of it in any way I can.  Edit I just sent an email to one of the processors in alaska. I also have a reference to someone who works with a processor so hopefully if I'm able to go up and work for for the summer I will have more money for this trip.

I'm also a bit of an artist (graffiti/cartoons) and write alright blogs. I'm going to be doing a similar thing (working for accommodation/food and hitch-hiking) in Central America from a few weeks time until about September. Then I could fly up and join. I'd have basic Spanish and some knowledge of Mesoamerica by then too. I'd love this opportunity and it would be great if I get the chance to learn a few things from some experienced guys before going to vagabond Europe for a year or two.

vagabond,34cvnh,beverbutts,4,Sat May 2 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"If the driver of the bus not only has his/her CDL but also a chauffeur's license, you could legally have open alcohol on the bus. Just a thought.  HOWEVER: Won't the driver need to get a commercial license in the US, Canada, Mexico, etc etc every country all the way down to Argentina?? Your best bet is to find someone on Reddit for each country who has the license and is willing to drive. The only other option is hiring a driver in each country which would probably be super expensive considering the mileage and hours they'd be putting in."
vagabond,34cvnh,Scribblessd,4,Sun May 3 06:03:58 2015 UTC,"There is a reciprocity law that allows other countries to honor our CDL and we do the same for them.

vagabond,34cvnh,Zenigata91,4,Sun May 3 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"Form submitted! Fluent English/French/Spanish speaker here. I was planning to do the same trip on my own so I'm definitely up for it. Money is saved, job is quit, passport is ready!  I would suggest buying two (or more) minivans instead of one big bus. That way if one breaks down we always have the other to run errands, and if one dies along the way we can keep going. If they are the right size we won't even need special driving licenses which can be a real issue in other countries. Everyone will be able to drive too and that's a big plus when you go long distance. Regarding the financial side of things, I would recommend that each van be owned by only one person who rents the van to the others for an agreed upon daily price, and I don't think too much money and time should be invested in the minivans prior to departure. Like /u/Digimad said: ""If the bus is 100% empty [I] think everyone would be fine with that"".  Edit: two or more big buses also works, if there are that many people."
vagabond,34cvnh,mikeysaid,3,Sun May 3 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"We already have so many people signed up we would need a like 4-6 vans.  Mini vans hold 6 people with light cargo, pile the packs in and your talking more like 4.  Current stats are 11 HELL YES I am going about 7 conditionals.  Now multiple gas X 6 vans, oil changes, ect.  6 X paying Darien crossing your talking 750$ + Fee's each car.   I might not know much about vagabonding but I do know about logistics of moving people and supply ""thanks Marines :)""   Van Rentals, anything over 30 days will require special permission from the company ""Leaving the country is hole different issue"". I am pretty sure what the would require would be some sort of large deposit, normally they hold 250-500$ for 30 day trips.  Frugality in this is going to be key, as the majority of us can not afford to fork out 1000's of dollars.  Once we hit Mexico drivers license really will not matter, you think Jose in Mexico knows the difference between a NY,FL, CA, or TX license or can run them... Nah lol.   The change of registration for the bus to non-commercial will fix that, a way to keep the bus from being a for hire is to register it into a Trust. A trust is kinda like a company but what it does it Trust's Property to a Person or persons for a set time or conditions.  For example the Vagabond Trust  The vagabond trust hold Bus Vin #XXXX from Jan 1st to March 3rd, After the experation of the the trust it will be turned over to X person to do so as they please.  This means the Insurance, Registration and other stuff will be registered to the Vagabond Trust. Its a private vehicle not for hire and we can have it registered as a RV or other type.  The more moving parts something has the more it can break, this includes logistics and supply lines.  http://www.legalees.com/revocable-living-trust-owned-vehicles/"

I have been searching for an interesting story to document for years now. I have pro equipment and it has been specifically tailored to be light weight and all fit into my 10 day marine mountain backpack. I charge my batteries off a small portable 12v system I rigged up. I have the money, the time, and the talent(s) to be a part of this. I have a mechanical background as a chair lift mechanic for Timberline Lodge (the famous hotel used in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining). I was a boy scout. I learned to hunt and fish along the John Day River as a teen. I am basic First Aid and CPR certified as of last year. I used to play the drums and after college, played in multiple gigging bands and toured the west coast. (I can provide an in-the-pocket back beat on a 5gal bucket). I get a long great with people and can adapt fast. More importantly, I am great behind a camera. I dove face first into DSLR film making a few years back and I have been progressing my craft ever since. I have traveled around the US and Canada, but never another country. (Canada doesn't count. Sry Canada). I am dying to see the world and gain some much needed perspective. I'd love to offer my talents to help out, photograph and film this amazing experience. All for a chance just to be a part of it, and see some amazing country along the way. Thanks for your time reading this Huck, and anyone else potentially going on the trip. If you get a chance, I'd love to hear your thoughts on filming the trip. Also, I invite you to check out my websites and get an idea of who I am and the work that I do.

Don't bypass this step, unless you want your dog taken from you. Make sure your vet is thorough & attentive to the issue.

The only bit of advice I can give you is this:  The miles postings heading east count down, with crew changes being at or around MP 0 (for the most part). SO even if your unfamiliar with where your at, if you pay attention to these you'll do okay.  Try to get on a train where you got off (provided your within a mile or two of MP 0. Also try to stick to intermodals with a few locomotives pulling it, those will be your best bet on going all the way across. If you catch CP out of Vancouver and your brave enough, you can get to Toronto  in 4 days (if to stay on.)  Also keep in  mind with the warmer weather now, the railroad's are looking out for riders so don't fuck around."

But if two people are patient and want to communicate, they will find a way.  Either by drawing, acting, or lucking upon words that are similar enough to be understood.

vagabond,34a2x4,BoxofWhine,6,Wed Apr 29 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea to do a little prepping before you ever take off to go tramping.  A lot of long-legged tramps who have been on the road for years lose their ability to re-integrate into society.  For instance, you must have valid identification for just about any kind of interaction with any governmental organization.  You need a copy of your birth certificate, a Social Security Card and a Driver's License (assuming you know how to drive a car or truck) at the very least.  A passport ($$$) would be an excellent idea.  Do people tramp all over without these things?  Of course, but everytime they encounter a cop there is the risk that since they cannot identify themselves, he may detain the tramp until such time as he can be properly identified.  ""Should"" or ""Fair"" doesn't enter into it.  It's POSSIBLE, and if you want to avoid sitting in a jail cell while waiting for your fingerprints to clear NCIS, carry some valid state-issued identification.  I have a friend who has been ""on the run"" from a charge of ""unauthorized use of a motor vehicle"" for about 25 years.  He took his father's car without permission when he was in his late teens, drove it across the country and abandoned it, and because he is convinced his father filed charges against him, he has been living in the shadows for years--no I.D., no SS card, can't get a passport, no birth certificate--which means no ""food stamp card"", no benefits of any kind, etc.  I have another acquaintance who fathered a child out of wedlock in 1968, got sued for paternity, refused to support the kid, and has been on the move constantly since 1969.  He works at a job for several months, then quits and moves to another state.  He has not filed Federal Income Tax forms since 1969.  The State of Washington says he owes his ex-girlfriend thousands and thousands of dollars in back child support.  He is adamant that he will not pay it, and prefers the life of a transient rather than accepting the judgment of the State.  The ""baby"" is 46 years old.  Living completely without ties to ""the grid"" can be very debilitating. Accumulating skills that one can use is very valuable.  Simple things, like having a commercial truck driver's license, can make life a lot easier.  With a CDL, you can find work virtually anywhere.  Having mechanic skills, knowing construction, knowing how to pour concrete, knowing how to weld, knowing basic electrician skills--these kinds of things are very valuable.  Most young kids on the road are not interested in doing the hard work of society.  They are much more likely to want to make a lot of money quickly flying a sign or busking rather than doing something like pouring concrete or mending fence.  I suppose that today there are some jobs available doing things associated with computers and computer amusements, but it's not something I know about.  I always gravitated towards manual labor like  truck driving, construction labor, swamping on tractor-trailers or sweeping at a warehouse.  Work today, get paid today, and down the road. Quite a few people follow the harvest.  Crops are ready to be harvested at different times, but there is a pattern to it.  Most people, other than itinerant farm workers, do not complete the entire harvest route.  They work in sugar beets, or wheat harvest, or apple picking, make a winter stake, and then go travel and enjoy themselves.  ""North in summer, South in winter.""  Few tramps carry heavy winter gear.  When it gets cold, they head South.  Carrying all the gear necessary to ""live out"" during winter is called carrying a Montana bindle.  Tramps who do stay up north during winter usually rent or lease a cabin and occupy it for the owners, protecting it from looters, who will break in to other people's summer cabins and rob them during the winter. Once you have a stake, the idea is to stretch it as long as possible.  I did my best to make whatever money I had last as long as I possibly could.  The most expensive items in my budget were tobacco, alcohol and the occasional toke.  I just about never ate in restaurants back then, way too expensive, although I worked in quite a few as a dishwasher and scullery worker, and usually received a meal for every shift I worked as part of my pay.  To work in a restaurant in some states you must have a Health Card.  Usually if you have one from one state, your employer will accept it in another state.  Women can often get jobs easily in bars as a bartender or a waitress, especially if they are young, attractive, and have a more-or-less conventional appearance.  (Yes, it's sad commentary on the state of society that a woman's physical appearance and her attractiveness to men greatly influence her ability to make a living.  It's no different for waitresses than it is for bank CEOs or potential presidential candidates.  The fact remains that cocktail waitresses make more money than nurses or teachers, albeit they have to put up with a certain amount of boorish behavior from men to make decent tips.)   And waitresses make a LOT more money than warehouse sweepers. Finding a good place to camp or crash takes up a lot of time.  An excessive amount of gear is not only a burden to carry, but it is actually a security problem.  Travel light.  Wherever YOU go, your gear goes WITH you.  You are a lot safer if you are travelling with a TRUSTED travelling companion.  Just teaming up with anybody is not a good idea.  This is especially true for women.  It's not completely impossible for a woman to travel alone, but it is pretty hazardous.  I advise against it, but people are going to do whatever they do.  Any woman travelling alone should be mentally and physically prepared to defend herself without hesitation.  That said, I know several female trainhoppers of many years experience who travel alone most of the time, but they are very good at detecting trouble (almost like a sixth sense) and they travel armed, usually with fixed-blade knives."

vagabond,3492bc,Skirtz,3,Wed Apr 29 07:08:47 2015 UTC,"Well man, I just hit the road a few weeks ago but I think I can help you based on some of my previous experiences.   All depends on what hygiene is to you.  I would say definitely brush your teeth every day.  You can find gas station restrooms to wash your face and do a quick wipedown with a wet towel.  You could always swim in ponds, lakes, rivers, but I wouldn't use soap there.  I feel like that could affect the water environment.  In truck stops you can buy a shower.  A gym membership like, planet fitness, will give you access to all their locations.  They have showers. I've been through 14 countries including Russia and Ukraine, and some sketchy places in the U.S. and never had an issue.  A lot of it isn't being able to defend yourself.  It is all about situational awareness and preventing yourself from being in that situation in the first place.  Start watching people and really paying attention to what happens around you.  You will be able to pick up when something isn't right and then it is time to move on.  Always trust your gut.  And if you are getting mugged or what ever, chances are the other guy has a knife or some sort of weapon.  Close quarters knife combat probably doesn't end cleanly.  So best choice is to turn tail and run.  No shame in that and you won't end up in the ER if you are fast. No clue there.  But walk around cities enough and you will get the general feel for where they are located, but each is different.  I would try to avoid them though.  Plenty of locations to free camp outside cities. Be smart, know what happens around you, be kind, never be afraid to walk away.  Your possessions typically aren't worth physical harm."
vagabond,3492bc,byesociety,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:32:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! How do you know when you've found a good place to camp out?
vagabond,3492bc,byesociety,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:06:45 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you don't.  Typically you can tell if a place gets any foot traffic.  Things like a worn path, trampled grass, or trash are good give-aways.  Just find some where that it looks like people don't go.  A story, trying to stealth camp on my motorcycle in Germany, I arrive at what looked like a good spot and decided to wait around about 30 minutes to see what was around.  A man walks out of the woods with a shotgun, crossbow, and rather large dog.  He didn't speak English really but he was a local and eventually got across that there were wild boars in the area.  I did not camp there.  While he scared me initially, I thank him, he could have saved me from having a much worse encounter."

Without delving too deeply into her business, she has substance abuse issues and had been on doctor prescribed methadone before leaving home. Her mother had been in contact with her before she lost her phone. It isn't a situation where she is running away to escape an abusive situation, she has a very loving and supportive family that is worried about her.

Often times the problems people have come from WITHIN THEMSELVES, and wherever they go, they wind up recreating those same problems again and again.  Learn to be at peace with yourself.  Stop desiring things, and let yourself be part of the world, without shame, without desire and without judgment.  LIVE IN THE MOMENT.  The past is past, the future is unknowable.  We only have the present minute.  Accept without judgment, as it is impossible to really know the details.  Have a set of correct life principles that you fully believe, and then live by them.

If you are thinking each person has their own blog, you might lean more towards Drupal. If it is one blog with contributors I would lean towards WordPress.

I had a website for a video game I was designing that used wordpress for the blog and most of the content.

That are the roots, at least. Today Wordpress can be used as a CMS, too (since it allows static pages and a hierarchical page structure since 1.5 IIRC).  And Drupal can also be used to create a simple blog, of course.  In my humble opinion Drupal gives you more possibilities than Wordpress, but may be a little harder to learn. (Don't know the current version, did a few sites with Drupal 5). Both are lot easier to handle than Typo3 of course. ;)  Edit: I don't have much experience with both, cause I use another (developed inhouse) system, but maybe this may help:  http://websitesetup.org/cms-comparison-wordpress-vs-joomla-drupal/"

And I've always had the heart to travel and rough it!"

How can I know you won't go off on me in the same way, if you don't consider me ""vagabond"" enough to be a travel partner?  I'm not being facetious, or attacking you, I'm generally curious.  I mean, I started my travels hitchhiking across Canada, but since then have gone on cruises, and backpacked Europe and traveled parts of Australia and NZ by camper-van - the last two trips cost be over 10k each. Does this mean I don't ""qualify""?"
vagabond,3410ic,augustwes,7,Wed Apr 29 04:26:32 2015 UTC,"Haha...ok ok, I went off a bit too much on the guy. I didn't handle that the most appropiate way that I could, thats for sure. Kinda blew my top, but then again, I'd spit on that guy in real life anyway.  As far as my ability to get along with someone on the road/rails/camping, I've done tours of duty with a dozen redditors from r/vagabond.  Quite frankly I don't care how much money you've spent on travels, or if you've went on cruises.

The general level of English in Argentina and Brazil (I haven't spent enough time in Chile to compare it) is much better than most of Latin America, and you can get around without speaking Spanish/ Portuguese, but your experience won't be nearly as interesting. As for the rest of Latin America, you don't need to know Spanish to get from point A to point B, but if you want to actually meet people and learn something about the country and the culture, it becomes necessary."
vagabond,3410ic,WanderfulSpirit,2,Mon Apr 27 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"In most Central America and South America, Spanish is absolutely necessary.

I made it from Vancouver to Toronto in 3 days by going with a trucker. Fruit picking in the Okanagan is a fun experience - pays peanuts (unless you are super speedy- I did meet a guy that bought a car with his fruit funds) - but definitely enjoyed my time. Rent in Vancouver is typically sky rocket high but I've managed to save up money and live for $200 a month- I know people who are long-term couch surfers here as well as a guy who's paying $350- so it definitely IS doable! As for work - pick up the local paper when you're in the town, Kijiji/Craigslist are given and temp agencies as well as word of mouth is a great if you can stay in a hostel.

Trustafarian is JUST a label. And that label is abused just like any other label.  To me, a trustafarian is a shitty hippy kid that masquerades as a ""low-income"" traveler, yet finances their travels from daddy's bank account or inheritance. To others, a trustafarian may mean something slightly different.  It sounds to me like you've earned your money, and you should just be yourself. If some scumfuck or crusty-kid calls you a trustafarian, just take pride in the fact that you're not a heroin-addicted scumfuck begging for money on a sidewalk, and just keep on keepin' on!"

Is it wrong to be more financially prepared than the next guy?   Plus the fact that it's money earned and not given would make it impossible to be a trustafarian by the very definition, no one gave it to you with a silver spoon."
vagabond,341c40,SunsetRoute1970,4,Mon Apr 27 15:41:31 2015 UTC,I think the trick is to do what you want to do the way you want to do it and not give a damn what anyone else thinks. every second you spend concerned what strangers think about you is a wasted second.
vagabond,341c40,Digimad,3,Mon Apr 27 15:55:38 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I have a brother-in-law who was a Marine Corps platoon commander in Vietnam.  When he was in NROTC in college in the early '60s he bicycled across Europe and through several Communist countries.  When he got back to the States he was contacted by people he was pretty sure were CIA, who wanted to talk about what he saw there, and wanted copies of all the photographs he took.   We live in a different world now.  Go green!  The Corps needs good officers."
vagabond,341c40,Digimad,4,Mon Apr 27 17:11:59 2015 UTC,"First off I am a USMC Vet, So I hope you go Marines lol. The second thing is its so HARD to get into that school most of the time you end up being career officers. The Naval Academy can pretty much set your career in the Military, I would ask you give being in the military a chance before you decided to split. I would have gave a left testicle to go to the Navel Academy and get my butter bars. What I am trying to say is think about the spot you took from someone who wants to make a career out of the Military before you just chunk it to the side. I was enlisted, if I would have had the resources to become a officer I would still be in.  If your going to go into the aviation side the are going to require a contract extension I can almost promise you that( 2-3 more years of school).  My MOS was 6541 Aviation Ordnance Mech I- Level I went to school at NAS Pensacola trained with Navy/Marine officers. Pilot is a different breed they don't act like normal asshole officers, most the time all they care about is if the aircraft is ready to fly or not. Here a pretty cool tid bit, when I was stationed on NAS Pensacola the Blue Angles office was in our barracks so I got to chat with those guys on a regular. Being in a barracks of enlisted Marines they would never wear a Cover so they did not have to salute the 200- 300 enlisted Pvt's-Lcpls in the barracks."
vagabond,341c40,SunsetRoute1970,2,Mon Apr 27 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"That honestly is where I got the idea to go Naval Aviation, the community seems much more locked on with missions and relaxed with daily things than other options like SWO. I assume the same holds true for Marine Air Officers as well. And you do have a good point, if I did get Aviation (which is a BIG if) I would be looking at a service obligation of closer to 7-8 years, depending on if I did NFO or Pilot school.   Don't get me wrong, I am very grateful for the opportunity I have been handed, and am still amazed that I got accepted. I just am not sure if the career military path is right for me, and I want to serve my enlisted as well as I can, not just be some shitbag officer looking for the next promotion or assignment. I just kind of figured I'd burn out before the twenty year mark anyways.   Did you find Naval Academy grads made more competent officers than ROTC or OCS? Because I've heard some are extremely arrogant ""ringknockers"" in the fleet."
vagabond,341c40,the4ester,3,Mon Apr 27 17:12:42 2015 UTC,"I have seen 4 distinct type officers. 1) Butter Bar ass wipe thinks cause he has a college degree he is god almighty and the enlisted should do everything in the power to praise him like a god. Life for them sucks after the Staff NCO's catch wind of this shit. 2) Officers dedicated to specific jobs ""like airwing officers"" they joined to do a job and they love it, they act like a normal manger and are generally pretty easy and great guys to work with. 3) Mustangs, prior enlisted. If you ever have a problem or need something these are your go to's cause they understand what its like 100% 4) Crusty old officers, these are motivators they usually Lt.Col and up. They come out on friday before leave and give ""thump your chest cause your a Marine and don't be in my office monday morning for a NJP speaches"".   When I got out of Combat School and we got to Pensacola we were given one of these speaches I will never forget. ""Marines it is not funny paint your face kidnap sailors and tie them to palm trees."" We had USN, USAF, USMC all on Pensacola and the Chairforce under NO CIRCUMSTANCES was to talk or engage with the Marines. It might have been the fact that if we seen them PT on bicycles we would give them hell lol. You should have seen the look on their faces when 100+ Marines would do beach assults at 0600 coming out of the ocean with faces painted and full packs and rifles. Or urban warfare training through out the barracks going for one to the next clearing buildings.   The advantage the Navel Academy gives you is a Rank one, its like the Harvard of USN/USMC officers so they get promoted faster in general and have better billets like pentagon and such. I am a 3rd Generation aviation Marine, My dad was a Vietnam vet and Crew Chief on HMX-1 ""Presidents Helicopter"" My grand pops was a B-25 mech in wwII. My dad left the Marines in 1982 and went to work for the NADEP ""Naval Aviation Depot"" Where he rebuilt every CH-46 on the planet, when the USMC retired the last 46 squadrons my dad retired that was in summer of 13 I think. My dad also has silver dollars he got from some officers when they got commissioned, I got 1 silver dollar when I was in college I mentored a kid doing the 1/2 and 1/2 OCS during college helped him with some of the Marine basic stuff, how not to be that ""officer"". What its like for the enlisted guys and stuff like that. When he crossed I went to quantico and watched him walk and got the first salute.  But if you go into aviation... you better love ships, and being at sea 3/4 of your career. Well shit if you go navy better be ready for that. If you go USMC 1/4 of your time will be on MEU but MEU's have not been going out like they used to since 9/11.  My I level job kept me off ships the Navy did all our I level work at sea so I got to hop a plane and skip the ship.   I dono if Navy officers have this but look into FTS ""Full Time Support"" Billets you get attached to a training squadron and spend 2 weeks on ship a year. You get duty stations in Key West, FL, Washington DC, Falon Navada, New Orleans, Falon Navada and whiteby island WA. My ex a Navy FTS AO-3 we went to school togther she spent 4 years in key west with 0 ship time and is now in New Orleans."
vagabond,341c40,SunsetRoute1970,2,Mon Apr 27 18:13:06 2015 UTC,"FTS billets are exceedingly rare for Naval Academy grads who are still below O-4 to get, unfortunately. The Navy considers our talents best utilized on platforms at sea, not in support, even though I'm sure no grad would be upset about a FTS in Key West or Whidbey Island.   As for love of ships, I do enjoy them, and would have no issue being on a ship six-nine months out of a year, especially if its stationed OCONUS.   I wasn't actually aware USNA graduates are promoted faster or given better billets, I assumed that that would all be based on fleet performance as an officer, not how we commissioned.   And I pray I wind up being that second type of officer. There's a prior enlisted Marine in my company who was an E-5, and I've been talking to him a lot to get some perspective from an up and coming mustang. That guy is going places, I wouldn't be surprised at all if he makes it past Colonel.   Also, seriously? Air Force pts on bikes? wow, glad I didn't go to the Air Force Academy!"
vagabond,341c40,peterfahita,2,Mon Apr 27 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"I think Naval Academy officers have the same problem that Harvard grads do--other officers who went to school at Ohio State or somewhere like that resent them.  The ringknocker thing is true, but NA grads in the Marine Corps have to be careful, there are plenty of mustang officers who outrank them and who will not tolerate any abuse of the troops.  And once the unit actually goes to combat, well, it is just extremely unwise to piss off the troops under your command.  The bottom line is ""Is this for MY benefit, or is this for this young Marine's benefit?""  Good officers are always looking out for the troops.  And remember, today's fuckup PFC may be tomorrow's excellent squad leader.  Many times it only takes good leadership to transform a discipline problem into a good Marine.  LISTEN TO YOUR STAFF NCO's.  They will very rarely steer you wrong.  You have to ""make the decision,"" but if you are wise you will at least consult with the experienced NCO's. In MOS School at Aberdeen Proving Ground, the Marine barracks was next door to the Air Force barracks.  We invited them to come play ""touch football"" in the rain.  It resulted in a large number of very muddy people getting evac'ed to sick bay on both sides, and us jarheads having to replant about a half acre of lawn during our liberty hours.  (But it was an epic football game.)"

One night, on a date with my upscale girlfriend (she was a young businesswoman in Dana Point) we were sitting at a table with some young Canadian tourists having a nice, civilized conversation when 81 Mortars platoon from Weapons Company, 2/1 crashed open the door and came trooping in, carrying their passed-out platoon commander in a fireman's carry like a casualty.  They came straight over to our table (I was trying to shield my face) and said loudly, ""Hey, that's Sergeant SunsetRoute!  What's up, Marine?""  The kid carrying Mr. Brown swept all the bottles off a nearby table and deposited his unconscious body on it with a crash.  We introduced the squad leader to the Canadians, who looked a little freaked out.  The whole place was dancing, and the Canadian girl was pissed that her husband wouldn't dance.  After a little chit-chat, the 81's SGT asked the Canadian girl if she would like to dance, and, looking daggers at her husband, she said, ""YES, I WOULD.""  The Canadian guy was looking at me accusingly, like I had somehow engineered this fiasco.  The 81's SGT danced with her, then escorted her back to the table like a perfect, slightly drunken, gentleman.  As soon as the band struck up the next song, the highest-ranking 81's corporal stood at attention, introduced himself and asked the Canadian girl if she would care to dance.  ""YES, I WOULD.""  Things weren't looking too good, the Canadian guy was getting really pissed now.  About this time, the previously unconscious Mr. Brown suddenly came to life, sat bolt upright in the middle of his table and shouted, ""SERGEANT!  SIT REP!""  My date said, ""Uh, I think it's time to go.""  As we were leaving out the front I heard a tremendous crash and what sounded like the beginnings of a riot.  That Monday I saw LT Brown in the BN Headquarters and he was sporting a tremendous black eye.  ""How was your weekend, sir?""  ""Just fucking splendid."""
vagabond,341c40,nuvistor,3,Thu Apr 30 07:16:47 2015 UTC,"So what you've got a bit of savings, that just means you can splash out once in a while. My understanding of a trustafrian is someone who has already got enough money in there bank account that they never need to work and subsequently lounge around not really doing anything and have no concept of the worth of money. They often partake in buying jeroboems of moet at ski resorts at 1 in the afternoon and then just spray said champagne over people. So in essance having savings before you go travelling is just plain practical and if you really want to live the vagabond life style set yourself a tight budget and put the rest in a savings account. You are the one who ernt that money so don't feel guilty bout spending it."
vagabond,341c40,FuchsiaGauge,3,Mon Apr 27 15:42:56 2015 UTC,"You are not a trustafarian. A trustafarian is a campus liberal with a trust fund. You, being a student at the naval academy  at the Naval academy, are probably neither."

vagabond,33z6iq,Wreckspowercolt,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:00:37 2015 UTC,"They did a hitch gathering last August in California. I seem to have the thought that a 2015 NA would be announced, but I could be wrong. I guess since /u/thewindandrain is still ooc, hitchwiki//r/hitchhiking's might not happen.   I'd be down for helping with a vagahobo event, but I'd likely be east coast or north central around that time."

I've been to a few of the european hitchgatherings (which arent organised by Hitchwiki exclusively, though there's a lot of overlap), the location tends to be finalized somewhat last-minute depending on local organizers/scouts and trying to come to some sort of consensus. The last few years they've been doing them in rural locations (within Lithuania, Slovakia, Albania) and setting up camp for about a week give or take, living a bit off the land and cleaning it up well before leaving, and also from the local dumpsters and village grocery stores. I've heard some talk of bringing them back to cities and visible public spaces though (first ones were in Paris and Odessa, Ukraine)  I'm not sure who's been the main organisers in the past for the hitchgathering in the US but I'd be surprised if a location has already been decided."
vagabond,33z6iq,antibubbles,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:53:42 2015 UTC,Yeah id be down but i dunno theres rainbow nationals in (perhaps michigan) some where up north and the the grateful dead show in chi-town.

vagabond,33z9zw,SunsetRoute1970,2,Mon Apr 27 01:43:07 2015 UTC,"The Fort Fisher Hermit got killed by local idiots.  Not recommended.  In my opinion, common sense would have been for him to arm himself.  Simple."

They aren't defying much of anything.  The police arrest them every chance they get, while the more or less normal tramps give the cops a tip of their cap and go catch out.  The dirty kids might as well be holding up a big sign that says, ""I'm a problem.  Please arrest me.""  (Edit:  grammar.)"
vagabond,33z9zw,_forgotmynameagain_,0,Tue Apr 28 06:29:05 2015 UTC,"Also, I think that sign has been photoshopped or something.  The photo is probably some kind of joke, but I don't get it.

They might as well be holding up a big sign that says, ""I'm a problem. Please arrest me.""   And why aren't they ""normal""? Because they look different than you? Are you kidding me? That you can't see what a blind bigot you are is fucking depressing.   People deliberately act in ways to make the rest of the world despise them, then cry about how mistreated they are.   People deliberately act in ways you don't like so you hate them for it. Brilliant. People are different. This is the typical redditor ""stop liking things I don't like!"" response. Grow up."
vagabond,33z9zw,FuchsiaGauge,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"Attacking the person rather than his ideas is an ad hominem attack.  You say ""they are better persons than you as an individual"" and that I am a ""blind bigot.""  These are ad hominem attacks against me, rather than against my stated opinions.  You do not know anything about me personally, so commenting on the supposed state of my character is an ad hominem attack.  The ""Dirty Kid"" thing is a COSTUME, like somebody in New York City going about dressed like a cowboy.  It is contrived to annoy people that the said D.K. imagines to be ""straight citizens"" who supposedly will be shocked and offended by the D.K''s appearance, body odor, clear lack of regard for the opinions of those around him and his pretty obvious rejection of the mainstream values of the society in which he lives.  I have had illegal immigrant farm workers ask me ""What the hell is wrong with those guys?  They were born here, but they act like crazy people.""  Frankly, I can't help but agree with them.  It's a free country, but just as the D.K.'s have a right to dress in filthy rags and refuse to bathe, the rest of the world has the right to be disgusted with their behavior, and to voice it."

I have no problem with anyone choosing a vagabond lifestyle, but then looking down on others that have it FAR WORSE than them is redditry in a nutshell.

vagabond,33z9h0,samlir,3,Mon Apr 27 03:33:52 2015 UTC,"I've only tested it at home with a USB device and it worked swimmingly. No issue with the socket whatsoever. For power and safety, USB 3.0 uses only about 5 watts per device, and the adapter can handle 660, so you're good there. The only issue is the watt rating of the bulb socket itself. Most of them I believe are rated around 60 watts, so it might not be good for certain devices like laptops.   You can always check the inside of the socket for a wattage rating.  Another minor drawback is that there's no grounding hole in the plugs but its no big deal for me."

vagabond,33wu5p,Ivyleaf3,5,Sun Apr 26 20:02:07 2015 UTC,"Hello there, Brit here :)  Disclaimer-I am not a houseless traveller.   I think two of the main differences, certainly in the UK, is that trainhopping would be much harder (maybe not possible, and fare-dodging is a different art) and bedding down wherever might be 'wild camping' which is technically illegal (not in Scotland). Obviously it varies a lot depending on where you are, the landowner, and it's pretty hard to get caught if you're on your own and secrete yourself away (I've never been nabbed whilst sleeping out in the dunes or forests, hehe).   There's been quite a few questions from UK vagabonds here recently-searching the subreddit should bring you a wealth of information on moving about and getting on in the UK."
vagabond,33wu5p,metalaffect,2,Sun Apr 26 13:58:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah train hopping isn't on my agenda at all, hitch hiking will probably be my main mode of transport, worse comes to worse I'm an avid cyclist so can pick something up, a lot slower but maybe nicer?  Know anything regarding temporary jobs, where to go for the winter, stuff like that?"
vagabond,33wu5p,_forgotmynameagain_,2,Sun Apr 26 14:14:43 2015 UTC,"I'm in the East Anglian fens, and people are really twitchy about picking up hitch-hikers, to the point where I haven't even seen one thumbing for years (apart from blokes with trade plates). But my part of the world is rural (and somewhat insular at times) so it may be easier elsewhere. I think Gumtree still has a liftshare section, although I assume you'd be expected to contribute. Cycling might work out-Britain's not that big!  As for temporary work, a lot of jobs that traditionally would have been done by migrant workers are now covered by Eastern Europeans. Crop-picking and the like. Again, keep an eye on Gumtree, look in libraries/community centres for 'help wanted', and bar work is a possibility (I'm not sure how that would work without an address)."
vagabond,33wu5p,metalaffect,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:44:42 2015 UTC,"I'm in East anglia too :)  Yeah I haven't actually hitchhiked around these parts, will have to see how it goes sticking my thumb out :)  Want to get into Europe as soon as possible really, hoping to get down to Dover and across to Calais asap and would like to spend some time in Germany (maybe Bavaria and the alpine regions) as I speak a little German already :)  Any Germans roaming around?"
vagabond,33wu5p,_forgotmynameagain_,3,Sun Apr 26 15:39:52 2015 UTC,"hi. I'm european, from london but lived in the us for a long time and did some vagabondy-kind of stuff in blue moon days. travelling anywhere in the UK is really difficult, but it's easy to get to continental europe and enter hyperspace. freight trains are almost impossible (almost ;) ), but passenger trains are surprisingly easy to 'hop', if you can call it that - austerity means less conductors, if any, and less desire to bust people for floating around like a french new-wave movie.  the trade off is that squatting is a lot easier and more enjoyable. while a lot of oogles think it's illegal, it isn't... only commercial properties are illegal, and the ban on residentials is often unenforcable. it takes a few people for it to be really bearable/feasible, and a few more to get to a critical mass where it becomes worthwhile. you meet people doing similar things in europe, also. know a fair number of germans; hitchiking there is definitely easier, especially if you speak some german. would suggest trying to sneak into fusion fest in late june, great place to meet other vagabonds. calais and ZAD in france are also neat spots, and hitchgatherings/squatters convergences if they end up happening.  i personally hate hate hate hitching , but it's definitely 9000% more fun if you have someone to do it with."
vagabond,33wu5p,_forgotmynameagain_,2,Sun Apr 26 23:40:08 2015 UTC,"the trade off is that squatting is a lot easier and more enjoyable. while a lot of oogles think it's illegal, it isn't... only commercial properties are illegal, and the ban on residentials is often unenforcable.   I thought it is legal in commercial properties as long as no ""criminal damage"" is done to get in and a criminal offense in residential properties as of 2012?"
vagabond,33wu5p,RedSmoke_,3,Mon Apr 27 08:49:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I messed that up, sorry. Only 'residential' property is supposedly illegal. Squatting in commercial property is still legal. the 'criminal damage' thing is used arbitrarily to evict certain people in certain areas, but really it's not a reason to evict... if someone is caught doing criminal damage to a property, they might be arrested. But it's important folks don't let it get used as a reason to evict; just because criminal damage has been done to a property in the past, it doesn't necessarily mean it was the current residents who caused it. Squats in residential properties are supposedly illegal, also, but it's still a lot safer legally and physically than squatting in most places in Europe, let alone the United States. Just don't talk, don't snitch, don't plead guilty."
vagabond,33wu5p,RedSmoke_,2,Tue Apr 28 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"just because criminal damage has been done to a property in the past, it doesn't necessarily mean it was the current residents who caused it.   Exactly. ;)"

I've got quite a few loose ends to tie up my end too and don't see myself heading out until next spring unfortunately, but hey it'll be worth sticking at the 9-5 slog I suppose to get that extra bit of dough saved up :)  Where abouts are you leaving from out of interest?"
vagabond,33wu5p,infisterra,2,Mon Apr 27 22:36:23 2015 UTC,"Next spring is long. I've got my stuff pretty much packed and everyday I get so bored, it's like being 8 years old and waiting for Christmas haha.  Probably going to cross the border from Newhaven to Dieppe. Considered Dover but Dover is a very grey place and also quite busy. Newhaven is quite quiet."
vagabond,33wu5p,infisterra,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"Didn't know about Newhaven!  Do people pay per car there or per person?  And yeah next spring is long but just wouldn't work for me right now :(  Well it would buy it would burn some bridges, biggest problem about working for extended family, if it turns out you hate the job you can't really just say ""fuck your job"" and leave :("
vagabond,33wu5p,_forgotmynameagain_,2,Tue Apr 28 10:35:10 2015 UTC,"Bad times, but yeah, I know what you mean :/  Newhaven is same as Dover as far as I know. Pay per vehicle. You can hitch across but I'll probably get a ticket (£20ish for walking). People don't tend to pick up hitchhikers at border because if hiker is smuggling anything then the driver is guilty for it, not the hiker. So people get a bit sketchy about it, understandably.  Also, I think because of all the hype about immigration and stuff, when people book tickets they have to state how many people will be in the vehicle. So if they say they're travelling with 3 people and suddenly there's this dirty looking tramp sitting in the back seat, border control might get aggy."
vagabond,33vmda,huckstah,11,Sun Apr 26 01:34:54 2015 UTC,"This doesn't surprise me at all. Welcome to the world of internet marketing and advertising. This is nothing new and most travel blogs out there do this type of for-profit traveling or sponsored traveling.   It makes total sense though. Yuppies have been squeezing themselves into subcultures for many years. If it makes them look cool or can profit from it there will always be the posers. Ultimately, the whiskey gets watered down too much and becomes no good.   Tomislav Perko is just one of many profiting from a subculture born out of necessity. Riding the backs of his greedy corporate sponsors it's easy to shovel shit into eager college yuppies minds (no offense lol). We live in a world of monkey see, monkey do. Of course MasterCard would sponsor this guy, of course he would become successful with his travel blog. It doesn't take much to make this lifestyle seem appealing. Who wouldn't want to ""travel the world with ALMOST no money"" according to his blog? This guy just did as any person with a background in marketing and corporate greed would do. He found a niche market and capitalized on it.  I say let it be. Let him do his thing. It's not worth trying to expose him because any true vagabond, hobo, trainhopper, or tramp knows a thing or two about capitalizing on opportunities. Let's save our breath and share some stories about living free."
vagabond,33vmda,hichet,7,Sun Apr 26 16:10:02 2015 UTC,I'm glad you shared it with us. It has brought a great conversation and really helped me think about this lifestyle in a less romantic way.
vagabond,33vmda,Iqua3,5,Sun Apr 26 16:48:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting the backstory. It does put him in an entirely different light...
vagabond,33vmda,foxchosen,7,Sun Apr 26 22:20:23 2015 UTC,Well that's pretty terrible. I'd argue that most of what he did is totally possible without a mastercard sponsorship. The point he's trying to make is still valid even if he is full of shit.
vagabond,33vmda,QuainPercussion,6,Sun Apr 26 06:09:21 2015 UTC,"It's the ""full of shit"" part that bothers me about this. And the part that makes me most annoyed is that he planned this ENTIRE trip for the purpose of monetizing it. That's just fake.  It's one thing if you do this lifestyle for months or years and then find an honest way to make a few bucks from a blog or whatever. Hey, whatevers gravy and floats your boat, all hail to you. But the way he has done this is just 100% bullshit. Mastercard as a sponsor? Really? A fucking credit card company? Oh sheeeeeesh...don't get me freakin started...haha.  And now the TEDx shit, this is just the end-of-the-tunnel-epic-level-bullshit.   He now profits from a bunch of googly-eyed wander-lusting hipsters with his fake tales of ""traveling for little or no money"", just like he profited from his family and friends with fake tales of throwing all of their savings into some AMAZING junk stock he discovered.   This is just 10/10 level fraudulent, and now he's fucking with our community, and I take offense to it.  You know, TEDx or whoever could get someone like YOU, /u/QuainPercussion, that is a real vagabond to discuss the realities of this lifestyle, but hey, that isn't romantic or exaggerated enough for Mastercard to hook you up with speaking presentations, is it?   This is just bullshit. And it's shitting on real travelers that REALLY DO travel with little to no money..."
vagabond,33vmda,DataPhreak,4,Sun Apr 26 07:29:19 2015 UTC,"The scary part about this is that it's going to make people with no experience in survival, and no skill in monetizing internet media. These yuppie hipster college kids are going to get out there, get stuck, and have to call their parents for a rescue or get themselves killed. I'm sorry, but if someone wanted to pay me 12k a year to backpack around the country wearing a t-shirt, I'd take them up on it. I can't fault him for that. However, lying in his blog is bad journalism morality. 1.3k is not a lot of money. Maybe a months wages or so, but predating unfortunate investors, many of whom probably gave him their life's savings is unacceptable. And then he wants to write a book about this? Fuck this guy."
vagabond,33vmda,DataPhreak,-1,Sun Apr 26 07:42:23 2015 UTC,"I commented on his youtube and blog accounts. Of course, the blog comments will likely be deleted, but he can't delete the comments from TEDx youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7vmHGAshi8"
vagabond,33vmda,IdahoSal,6,Sun Apr 26 08:39:27 2015 UTC,"Nice. I did want to add, I met a guy who did something similar to what this guy was doing, as far as the media whoring, and to a point it can be honorable. The guy was from Idaho, and he was walking 1 mile for every soldier that died in Iraq. This was back in 07-08 i think. I gave the guy a full army sleep system. Both bags, the gortex bivvy, and the sinch sack. But here's the thing, they guy would only accept rides on dangerous stretches of highway, and only took back highways. When he would come into a town with a news station, he would contact the news station, let them know what was going on, and they would either run a story or they wouldn't. The publicity he gained would earn him handouts that both bolstered his spirit and fed him to his next location. (He never accepted money. I tried to give him money and he wouldn't take it. Only food or gear.) If they didn't run a story he'd walk to the next town. And he always made it about the soldiers, never about himself. He was truely one of the coolest dudes I ever met."
vagabond,33vmda,butttastik,4,Sun Apr 26 08:42:37 2015 UTC,"THAT is actually respectable...and I give full kudos to him for doing that. Like I said, I totally believe in REAL travelers finding a way to monetize and support their lifestyle. However, Tomislav is just a fraud."
vagabond,33vmda,1000daysofsummer,7,Sun Apr 26 08:50:00 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of Tomislav Perko until this reddit post.  That said, it seems that he directly answered the array of charges leveled at him.  In response, he gets a load of emotion-laden rhetoric sidestepping Perko's refutations.  Not exactly credible.  And no, I'm not a vagabond, and I don't have a mastercard."
vagabond,33vmda,DataPhreak,2,Sun Apr 26 09:46:51 2015 UTC,They video didn't even give real information. His rules for hitchhiking were dumb
vagabond,33vmda,1000daysofsummer,8,Sun Apr 26 13:05:04 2015 UTC,"Hi - Tomislav Perko here.  There's a lot of work here, so lets start with some simple true/false points, later I will explain in details:   I was a stock broker who convinced his friends/family into bad investment and at the end of it all, owed 30,000 dollars - TRUE. When investors started demanding their money back, I ran away - FALSE. I smuggled away 1,300 dollars, and used that money to monetize a traveling blog BEFORE I even started traveling - FALSE. I accepted a deal with MasterCard - TRUE. I was housed and fed by the generosity of poverty-stricken families in third-world countries - TRUE and FALSE at the same time. I had paid vacations and preplanned excursions - FALSE (I did used sponsor money to pay for that skydiving and my fathers visit to Kenya). I raised 12,000 dollars on Indiegogo for my book - TRUE.   So, you have 3 1/2 out of 7 right. 50%.   Let me know explain in details:   I was a stock broker, young and naive, and I did convince my family members to lend me money so I can earn more for them. I succeeded for a while, until 2008. Then I lost everything I had, and much of what they gave me. So yes, guilty of being a self confident stock broker, but instead I was more of a gambler. I did fuck up, and had to find a way out of it. And then we come to the point #2. I didn't run away. The people I owed money were my family. And they even didn't ask their money back, but I felt the obligation to give them what is theirs. So I started working in one juice bar in my city, while hosting 100-150 people on CouchSurfing. Then, I started traveling myself, 5 days to Bulgaria, around Croatia, 2 months around Europe. That was 2009/2010. So I was ""home"" 2 years after I ""ran away"". When I was posting photos of my ""vagabonding"", friends told me they like it, so I opened a FB page and started posting things there. I went to Spain for 2 months, and the FB page grew bigger, I ended up in media, gave few talks in my city. When a lot of people wrote to me that they would like to try something like that themselves, I organized a hitchhiking race from Croatia to Turkey. We had 2 sponsors for that race - we got free travel insurance, T-shirts, and some rakija. The race was a huge success, but there was no 1,300 dollars and monetized blog. After the hitchhiking race, I was approached by MasterCard, and they told me - keep traveling like you do, we will give you our T-shirt and our card, mention us in your blog, take some photos with our T-shirt. And I said yes. The reason for that wasn't because I needed money for traveling, but because of my debt. I saw this as a perfect opportunity - I will continue doing what I want (traveling) using ways I want (hitchhiking, couchsurfing, busking, etc.) and use the sponsor money to pay off my debt. Then I went on my RTW trip called ""1000 Days of Summer"". MC said they will sponsor me two days before I embarked. I planned this year since July 21st 2009. I started it in September 2011. I was fed and housed by poverty-stricken families in third-world countries - yes, as everybody who is traveling in third world countries. But did I take advantage of them - I don't think I did. I wasn't a free loader - I was hosted by people like I hosted people in my flat. I cooked with them like people cooked with me in my flat. It was an exchange. I had no planned excursions - I received a monthly salary (which was directly going to paying off my debt), and I used that money twice in 3 years - for skydiving, and for bringing my dad over to Kenya to fulfil his lifelong dream. Plus, I was always clear about that. People who read the story from the beginning, they knew everything. When I started writing my book, I had two choices - to self-publish or to accept some publisher proposal. I saw crowdfunding as a perfect way of getting what I want, and I offered perks in exchange for money. Is that a problem? Or everybody asking money via crowdfunding is begging?      There you go. I am willing to discuss this further if anyone has any questions.   Peace out, T.  PS. You will be happy to know that my debt of $30,000 just got payed off couple of days ago, thanks to MC sponsorship and profits from my book."

However, when someone puts your link in our community, I'm going to be here to call you out.  You, Tomislav, are a complete FRAUD. You are like the ENRON of investing money for friends/family, and the ENRON of profiteering on Vagabonding and houseless traveling. Enron got busted, and now so are you.  You are a former stock broker that lost everyone's shit in a phony market, and you ran away from your problems to pursue a ""vagabond career"" that is now sponsored by credit card companies. Now you've fabricated this entire ""vagabond story"" so you can ASSUMABLY pay back your investors.  It's so noble that you were able to ""pay back your investors while using Mastercard"", after you previously ignored/hung-up/ran-away from their phone calls so that you could ""hit the road"" and monetize/exploit OUR ENTIRE FUCKING LIFESTYLE.

Don't fool yourself like you try to fool that TEDx audience, we aren't playing that game here.  You can come up with a bullet-point of fancy excuses, elaborated justifications, and further bullshit marketing to glamorize your world travels.  The bottom line is this: We are ACTUALLY vagabonds. We don't brag about leaving a life of financial servitude, only to turn around in utter hypocrisy by getting our lifestyles sponsored by conglomerate financial institutions that thrive on debt.  What the fuck are you THINKING, man? I mean, are you fucking serious? Are you going to look us in the eye and feed us this horse shit?  Are you REALLY going to sit here and talk to a community of REAL hitchhikers, rubbertramps, and trainhoppers, telling us that your Mastercard-sponsored vacation is a legitimate form of living life on the road?

You see, Tomislavc, there is going to be no more of this TedX bullshit rhetoric. No more Mastercard damage control. No more safe-haven of a monetized blog. No more taking the image of REAL travelers and COMPLETELY exploiting our reputations for the sole sake of profiteering and paying back your investors.   You END this bullshit fraudulence RIGHT NOW. That's the deal.  Either you start being a real vagabond without using corrupt corporate sponsors (including paid vacations!), or you apologize publicly to the entirety of the /r/Vagabond and squattheplanet.com community right fucking now.

Chill out man, this is not a competition. Find me one place where I said I was the ultimate vagabond/traveler/nomad. You and your group of real vagabonds dont have to feel threatened.   My cards are open - I said what I had to say in prior comment. I am not trying to be real vagabond, I'm (or I was) just a traveler. In my own way, respecting people that travel their own ways. I would never say that someone who is traveling differently is less worthy than me. And that is exactly what you are doing here.

As you could see by that 30 minute research you did. Do I feel sorry for that? Not really.   Do you have a mobile phone? Do you feel responsible that ""the main part of minerals used to produce cell phones are coming from the mines in the Eastern DR Congo. The Western World is buying these so-called conflict minerals and thereby finances a civil war that, according to human rights organisations, has been the bloodiest conflict since World War II: During the last 15 years the conflict has cost the lives of more than 5 million people and 300.000 women have been raped. The war will continue as long as armed groups can finance their warfare by selling minerals."" - that took me 1 minute of search.  You are not the first hater I had in 6 years of my travel writing. And probably not the last. You just ""exposed"" the story that is available to people if they, like you, do 30 minute search. Well done.  All the best in your future, vagabond."
vagabond,33vmda,1000daysofsummer,6,Sun Apr 26 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"You're a clever man, but it's not hard to see past your deceptive tone.  You open your post by attacking Huck's emotional state, then move on to shame him.  Asking someone to show proof that you said you were the ultimate vagabond is bullshit too, because it's a challenge no one can fulfill.   The issue here that people are taking with you is that you seem disingenuous by giving advice on how to lead a lifestyle that you personally did not lead.  All the other stuff you're prodding at is just fluff. The semantics of the word vagabond, Huck's moral inconsistencies, none of that matter. Your credibility in regards to the advice you offer is what is being challenged here.  I don't have a side in this fight but it's disappointing to see someone resort to the tactics you're using."
vagabond,33vmda,DataPhreak,6,Sun Apr 26 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"You seem very self assured for one whom the road has taught nothing.  You proclaim to be a true vagobond, yet risk nothing. Yet claim that he who has created a community dedicated to helping vagabonds dedicated to educating those who would strive to uphold the morals of the vagabond community as being childish? Putting people into categories is what has ensured the survival of the vagabond community. Perhaps you should take 30 seconds to research the first hobo congress. Of course, how could I deign to assume you have not done that already?  Your cards are open? Really? Lets see the full history. As well as your credit report and all other monetary accounts you hold. Being a traveler is one thing. Being a minimalist traveler who holds no assets and subsists on the least amount of fiat currency possible is totally different. One who travels by private jet and private yacht is just as much as a traveler as one who walks from place to place. But only one may call themselves vagabond.  Nobody is asking you to be sorry for accepting money from any organizations. What we are disturbed by is your portrayal of this as being a valid course of action for others. If other persons pursued your same path, they could find themselves in danger or bankruptcy. This is the exact path that you lead the investors that you took for a ride. Are you prepared to provide insurance for those who would chose to follow your path? If not, what you are doing is bullshit predatory journalism. If you took media and journalism and put it on a pedestal, upon which it does not belong anyway, what you are doing belongs in a sewer. It's like saying, ""I joined the army and went to japan and had sex with 40 japanese people and you should join the army so you could do the same thing."" No, if anyone tried to follow the path which your blog has proposed, especially in east africa/mid east/east europe, they'd probably be beheaded by isis without any question. In america/mexico/canadia they'd just have to call their mom, or starve/dehydrate because they couldn't find their way to the resources they need to survive because you don't talk about that in your blog.  And then.... AND THEN!!! you try to go and blame this on /u/huckstah because he uses a cell phone? I'm sorry, but go eat a bag of dicks. Every single resource that is utilized in any electronic device could probably be linked to the same conflict you cite for his lack of resources. I fail to see exactly what resource a cell phone uses that a laptop, which is what he carries, or a tablet, which is cheaper and more convenient than a laptop, could require. Or do you do all of your publication online? Are you a vegan? Also are all of your computers powered by solar? You're sure nowhere you've visited gets power through oil or coal? GIve me a break man.  You're not the first poser i've seen in the last 6 years of my travels, and probably not the last. You've just ""exposed"" the idiocrity that is avialable to peoul if they, like huckstah, do 30 minuts research. Poorly done.  Eat a bag of dicks, sell out."
vagabond,33vmda,CookieDoughCooter,-2,Sun Apr 26 10:13:45 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh noooo Mr. Mastercard, not so fast! Oh no, no, no buddy, you aren't leaving on that note. You aren't going to play the ""non-chalant"" charade of bullshit excuses, and you certainly aren't going to blame REAL vagabonds for foreign civil wars in Africa.   Furthermore, how dare you blame a vagabond with a smartphone for damaging this world, meanwhile you partner with Mastercard Corporation that does far, far more damage to the world. Hah, trying to trick our subculture into believing you are a low-budget traveler? Try again, Mr. Mastercard. You're the world-wide fuck up, not us.  So let me get this straight: Vagabonds like myself are contributing to ""world evil"" because we are using smartphones, meanwhile YOU are a direct-paid employee for one of the worst financial corporations in the world?    ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? That's your analogy to justify all the bullshit and profiteering that you've committed? That's the ultimate excuse?  Wait, wait. Once again, just for the record, let's get this straight: You DIRECTLY signed a contract with one of the most bullshit companies in the world, yet that's completely justified because now you blame Vagabonds with cell phones for indirectly contributing to civil wars and human-rights violations in Africa?   (Wow, for fucks sake dude, you really are good at marketing. Mastercard should just straight up find you a job in Public Relations. This is some 10/10 level top-notch bullshit to distract the current relevancy of an opposing argument. Kudos, you clever fucker.)   BACK TO THE REAL WORLD:  HOLY shit, you are literally blaming cell-phone-wielding vagabonds for the chaos in Africa? That is, without a doubt, one of the most exaggerated and bullshit-escalated excuses that one could possibly resort to, not to mention that EVERY HUMAN ON EARTH is guilty of this, not just vagabonds.  So, while you work for an internationally corrupt corporation that directly contributes to worldwide corruption and poverty, you blame REAL vagabonds for the troubles in Africa? Are you ABSOLUTELY fucking serious? Do I need to pinch you? Maybe snap my fingers? Hello? Fucking reality check? How many fingers am I holding up. ARE YOU FUCKING THERE?!?!  So, apparently it's okay to dance around the world wearing a fucking Mastercard logo, because real vagabonds contribute towards civil wars in Africa? You are absolutely out of your fucking mind, and you must simply be scraping the bottom of the barrel for more excuses at this point. Sheesh dude.   This is worst than talking to an infomercial. This is like arguing with a used-car salesman that is going to SELL ME THAT CAR no matter what it takes, no matter what he has to say, no matter how much he has to lie, no matter how much he has to SELL HIS SOUL.  No, you didn't DIRECTLY say you were a vagabond. You just directly PRETENDED to be, all the while making sure that profit was your primary agenda. You know exactly what you've done, unless you have ACTUALLY convinced yourself of this elaborated lie.  So fine, you can sit here and try to take a gracious exit, and play the ever-so-graceful and non-chalant gentleman card. Kudos to you, Mr. Public Relations.   However, my good sir, I live on the road, and I'm not playing the ""gentleman"" card. Oh nooooo sireeeee...! I'm playing the hobo card: I SPIT on you.   From the nether regions of the back of my throat, from a powerful nose-snort full of the most nasal-congested mucous that I can possibly muster, I fucking SPIT on you. There will be NO grace or humility in my approach to corporate frauds like you, with your phony blogs, bullshit speeches, and stealing the credibility of our lifestyles.  Pack up your expensive backpack, grab your Mastercard shirt, and get the fuck out of the Vagabond community.  Stop your shitty monetized blogging, end your corporate sponsorships, and stop taking advantage of digital crowd-sourcing websites. There are real vagabonds with real ideas that could really use the peoples trust.  End your bullshit now, and apologize to the public. Otherwise, don't expect any real traveling forum or traveling website to take this bullshit seriously. Do the right thing."

HOWEVER, since it's too late to change your ticket, here is my advice about Oahu:  Do NOT try to sleep at the Ala Wai canal or anywhere downtown...you'll get mugged or beat up in a heartbeat. In fact, don't stay in Honolulu period, because the rest of Oahu is much better for Vagabonds.  I'd suggest taking the bus out towards Waimanalo and Kaneohe area..much safer for camping, and you can find jobs on farms if you look for them. Also checkout Haleiwa area...awesome camping, more ""hippie"" vibe and vagabond friendly, and you might can find a farm to work/live at there also."

In fact, as I am writing this, someone is hopping on a train in Roseville, or getting off of one.  Roseville is just BIG, not very complicated. The size of the yard really intimidates people, thus confusing you, but the layout is actually pretty simple when you start learning train yards.   As far as what goes on there, it's sort of the crossroads of California and the entire West Coast, and the second-biggest train yard West of the Mississippi River. One of the primary jobs at Roseville is to attach/assemble more power (engines) to Eastbound trains so that they climb over the mountains and high elevations of the continental divide.  It's also an assembly yard for cars that are headed north to Oregon.  Most train yards have a classification and work section, a departure section, and the main rails for go-through traffic, arrival, or final departure, and Roseville isn't much different.  Hobo's don't care much about the classification yard, or the work yard. Those trains aren't moving for hours, possibly days.  We focus on the departure yard and the main-rails. We want to see the trains arriving for a brief stop/layover, or the trains departing the yard to take their loads onward."

In the event of an overcharge condition, it is possible for excess pressure to build up inside your battery. Your new batteries are equipped with check valves that are engineered to open at between 2-3 PSI depending upon the specific brand. What will be expelled is hydrogen gas, and you want to vent that as it is quite explosive.""  Also: Being covered in battery acid is not fun."

vagabond,33hz1q,gettindemdownvotes,2,Thu Apr 23 11:25:01 2015 UTC,y0 dawg.. it's been a week. How's it going? Have you left? I NEED UPDATES! lol.
vagabond,33hz1q,gettindemdownvotes,3,Thu Apr 30 14:10:00 2015 UTC,"I lived in several different kinds of vans when I was younger.  My first van was a VW microbus.  This was a popular vehicle in the late 1960's but it was a mistake--too underpowered and it wasn't big enough.  I also lived in a Ford Econoline  and a Chevy van.  The Econoline was the best.  I had a bed built out of 2x4's and plywood behind the driver's side seat, with a plastic-covered hospital mattress I got out of a psych hospital dumpster on it.  These mattresses are what they put in ""seclusion rooms""--very lightweight, foam mattresses.  I also built in a ""bucket potty.""  I found that having a place to take a piss was very advantageous.  I lined the bucket with a plastic trash bag and ditched the bag in dumpsters after I used it.  If I didn't have a bag, I just used the bucket and emptied it in the toilet in gas station bathrooms.  (Back then the head was usually ""around the back"" in most gas stations, and the attendants didn't care what you did back there.) I mostly cooked on open fires, but later on I bought a two-burner propane hot plate and fueled it with a twenty-pound barbecue propane tank that sat in a propane tank rack on the right-side back door.  I also built  a full-length roof rack to carry cargo, with a ladder bolted to the left-side rear door.  I got it stuck a few times, and digging it out was a pain in the ass.  If I was building one today, I would build a receiver-hitch bumper front and rear, and buy a receiver-hitch cradle-mounted winch, so I could move the winch from front to rear if need be.  (The winch rides inside the vehicle unless you need it.)  Probably the most important things are a good water supply for drinking, extra gas cans, a good full-size spare tire, a Hi-Lift farm jack, a set of basic mechanic's tools and a repair manual for your model van.  If you aren't a mechanic, you need to become one.  Breaking down in the boondocks just really sucks big time.  I carried a few extra parts from the Pic-A-Part junkyard--a fuel pump, a brake wheel cylinder (my vans had drum brakes), extra universal joints, etc.  Always carry a few cans of engine oil and transmission oil, a can of brake fluid, power steering fluid, etc.  You just never know when you may need them."

I might do have too much stuff but this is my first time going on a trip like this and I don't have anything to fall back on so I'd much rather have too much stuff and get rid of it as I need to than be under prepared"

vagabond,33k9x5,evilyou,3,Thu Apr 23 15:19:34 2015 UTC,Story of my life.
vagabond,33k7tm,NeonUp,14,Thu Apr 23 04:37:25 2015 UTC,"Let's see...  In Laramie, Wyoming my train only slowed down to about 15 -20 miles an hour, and I had to bail off. Busted my ass, and lucky I was able to walk away without any broken bones.  In 2008 in Pendleton, Oregon I tried to rescue my friends guitar from a flat car, and I fell down near the train while running full speed and I almost ended up rolling underneath the wheels.  In 2006 I took a train 500 miles the wrong way because the train took a fork/switch that was impossible to predict.  In 2014 I fell asleep during the crew change in Cheyenne, and when I woke up I discovered that the car I was on got dropped off in Sidney, Nebraska.  In 2014, a coal train skipped past the town we wanted to get off in, and took us 20 miles away to the middle of an industrial zone and we got kicked off in freezing temperatures and had to walk several miles to find any form of civilization.  In 2014 a rookie bull (railroad security) pulled a gun in my face and I thought the son of a bitch was going to shoot me dead.  I could go on, and on, and on."
vagabond,33k7tm,huckstah,5,Thu Apr 23 05:30:51 2015 UTC,Did you manage to save the guitar in 2008?
vagabond,33k7tm,Dudeimshawn,4,Thu Apr 23 11:08:19 2015 UTC,"No :( It was a Fender Stratocaster owned by my friend. He couldn't catch up to the speed of the train, although I had already hopped up on the car and thrown his guitar on top of the flatbed car.  My friend simply couldn't catch our car, or the next car, and he couldn't hop on period.  I was much more used to trainhopping than him, so it was left to me to jump off the train, run aside the flatbed car, and try to retrieve the guitar.  I gave one pull and it wouldnt come. I gave two pulls, still wouldn't come. Third and final push was the last breathe of strength I had, and it failed as well.  No breathe or strength left, I hit the ground really hard. I tumbled 4-5 times and saw myself rolling towards the wheels. I stopped myself with my hands and knees, less than a foot aay from the wheels.   Close call. But I didn't leave unscathed. I had a fractured knee, and a fractured rib. It really fucking sucked."
vagabond,33k7tm,huckstah,2,Thu Apr 23 11:20:36 2015 UTC,I'm confused. You and the guitar were already on the train? Why didn't you just grab the guitar before you jumped back off?
vagabond,33k7tm,Dudeimshawn,8,Thu Apr 23 11:25:01 2015 UTC,"I threw my backpack and his guitar on to the flatbed floor of the car. I then jumped onto the LADDER of the car, and immediately looked back at my friend. I told him to run faster, catch-up and jump on, but he was clearly giving up and couldn't catch up to our car.  Immediately, I jumped off the ladder, started running beside the train car, and jerked my backpack off the car.   While still running, I tried to jerk his guitar off, but one of the straps to his guitar case was stuck to the car.   While running full speed alongside the train, I pulled once on the guitar case, couldnt get it. Pulled twice, still couldnt get it. Pulled a third time and I simply had no strength left...fell face first into the railroad rocks and ate shit."
vagabond,33k7tm,huckstah,2,Thu Apr 23 11:41:14 2015 UTC,That was a really well written and baller story. Thank you for telling it.
vagabond,33k7tm,Brave-Ulysses,2,Fri Apr 24 04:53:32 2015 UTC,"I was in a derailment. It was a total mess and I'm lucky to be alive. We went in the rear unit, but we were looking at cars further up the train and had considered them. It was early in the morning and we were sleeping in the rear unit, nice and comfy. All of a sudden the train starts slowing down really fast, in spurts almost. As if someone was pumping the brakes. I was lying down and it woke me up. A big red emergency light came on in the unit, and we were like WTF? Then we left, no sense in sticking around. So many cars ahead of the rear unit were totally trashed and if I was in one of those, I would be seriously injured or dead. I'm talking huge rail cars with large sections crushed. The front units and other cars had split and were way up ahead. I haven't hopped since."

I worked valet in a big city and chuckled at a dude like this (but drunk) trying to pick up a woman on my ramp.  He heard me, stomped over as the woman watched and gave me a similar line: ""You see this fucking watch? This watch is worth more than your salary!"" I was working so I was limited as to how I could reply but said something like ""Sir, I'm in college, but good on you for owning such a great... watch."" Wish I said more because I quit soon after."

vagabond,33grj5,mutokangius,13,Wed Apr 22 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"The people that own 50k A. Lange & Söhne's generally have more money than God. I've known people whose ""beater"" watch (the durable watch that you don't care about what happens to it bc it is cheap - for normal people, a G-Shock) is a 20k Patek Philippe Aquanaut. They genuinely don't care much if it breaks. It's not much money to them.   You can't envy people for having more money than you because there will always be someone richer. You could have a billion dollars and there will still be smug fucks richer than you that treat you like shit. Your happiness cannot relate to a rich/beautiful/successful person putting you down. Why should it? Those who matter don't mind.   You can't covet material possessions. Isn't that why we're all in this sub anyway?

Yeah they have a shit ton of money and a nice house but at the end of the day they're alone, miserable, and no amount of nice watches is going to change that."
vagabond,33grj5,krymsonkyng,3,Thu Apr 23 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"Man you have no idea about rich dude watch culture. It's less about the actual watch and more about the social game they play with one another. It's like wearing a suit to a job interview, you're saying, ""Look I can conform and play by your rules!"" Expensive watches are the same. They're the not-so-secret handshakes of the rich. A normal rich guy with a five figure watch dreams of being an abnormally rich guy with a six figure one. Weird shit."
vagabond,33grj5,Isaeus,2,Wed Apr 22 20:04:08 2015 UTC,"There are weird nuances too, like finding a watch that matches your rings (1 per hand max). It's kind of like the nuances around punk patches and piercings in certain scenes. I'm no expert on either set of subtle rules, just a casual observer, so take this comment with a grain of salt."
vagabond,33grj5,krymsonkyng,2,Wed Apr 22 21:41:31 2015 UTC,"I can't say I have ever heard of a limited amount of patches or piercings in any punk scene.

vagabond,33grj5,Isaeus,2,Wed Apr 22 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"Define annoying... There's your limit no? I agree on the mouth thing, but there's certain ones(e piercings) I find more attractive based on skin tone and whether or not I expect those lips to meet mine. Everyone's got personal preferences, but those collective desires add up and folks try to fit the bill for what their expectations are. Cliques are formed. Compare your standard issue west coast ""bro"" type to an east coaster crowd and the differences (maybe subtly, maybe not) are there.  The same is true in any ""uniform"". Crusties seek crust, glammers seek glam (that's a thing right?). Bosses seek to look bossy, techies seek to look like they know which side of the usb goes on top by feel alone.  Whether wittingly or not, people try and look the part they want to play. I like to watch folks when I travel (I'm an interloper here as in everywhere, please don't hate me), so I try and look as nondescript as possible.  Got a lot of local bands or a high turnover of folks? I'm willing to bet 10 patches isn't unheard of.  Small scale town with a dedicated few? Expect to see fewer flags and such. shrug Humans, for good or ill, are tribal at their core. The trick to living happily imo is blurring the lines and being free to navigate the clique-sphere, regardless of circumstance, location, or purpose.  E: I'm not saying there are hard and fast rules, just saying folks have their own definitions of chiq or cool or tight or whatever."

After going to jail on multiple occasions for possessing marijuana, I realized that it was a matter of time before I was going to get into more trouble with my parents and local law enforcement. I became really depressed, even suicidal. The situation I was in was literally bringing me to the brink of doing something stupid and desperate. Eventually, I dropped out of school, got kicked out of my house, and there I was: on the streets. I had two options: Try to make the best of my situation as a homeless person, or just fucking end it all.  Fortunately, I decided to give life one final shot, and went to San Francisco to join other houseless travelers.  After a rough year of learning the tips and tricks of being a vagabond, I eventually sharpened my skills, stopped being a bum, and chose to become a career hobo.

I spent 4 months working at McMurdo Station. A friend down there told me to apply for work in Alaska, and now I spend my summers working in Denali National Park.  I tried to go back to work full-time, but last about 2 months before I became really depressed. Now I spent my time hopping around in between jobs and seeing things. Much better."

Cut westward towards the Susquehanna River and follow it north/northwest At about Duncannon, PA, the Juniata River branches off in a more westward direction At about Hollidaysburg, PA, Blair Gap Run branches off, follow that south westward   I'm currently at work, so I will add more when I get a chance. That should get you at least to a little outside of Pittsburgh   Update: work has slowed down so I can continue for a bit   If you travel west from Hollidaysburg, PA about 26 miles, you come to Summerhill, PA where you can catch the Little Conemaugh River. Take that west About 50 miles later you come to Saltsburg, PA, and the Conemaugh River turns into the Kiskiminetas River. That eventually ends at the Allegheny River in Scheney, PA. Take the Allegheny River southwest until it hits the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, PA. The Ohio River connects with the Mississippi River in Cairo, IL. Take the Mississippi River north until you hit the Missouri River in Hartford, IL. From the Missouri, you can take a couple different routes. You can take it all the way to Three Forks, MT where it ends or you can take one of the many, many, many other rivers that branch off of it.   Edit #2: Here is a map overview"

They interview and confirm your employment through a phone call as opposed to making you show up for a personal interview.  As far as the deckhand job, I definitely recommend that job over any job at a cannery. You'll make more money, and the type of work is far better.  However, I definitely don't recommend you hop a train to get there without first doing it with some hobos that know what they are doing. If I was in your situation, I'd just hitchhike to Washington, then figure out your way to Alaska.

vagabond,33fd4k,ECAM-FCA,14,Wed Apr 22 01:49:55 2015 UTC,"As a psychology major I have taken this test several times, with varying results each time. The MBTI is just a slightly more advanced version of a ""Which personality in Seinfeld are you?"" type of thing you see on Facebook all the time. Personality and how you identify as you are far more complex than 4 dichotomous categories, but of course when you read the description you'll think ""omg that's so me."" It's some sort of funny irony that the only thing about ourselves that is really uncovered by modern personality tests is that we nearly invariably attribute the results to who we are. Most people would read a blurb about their chinese animal and think the same.  That being said, I would think the most successful vagabonders, and those who are most likely to choose the lifestyle, would be EITP, with E and P being the most important to the lifestyle. You probably won't enjoy yourself much if you have to plan everything to a t and don't particularly like being around other people. But of course you could seclude yourself in the woods and plan it extensively, so even that is not tried and true.   I'm not taking the test again, but if you ask me what I really think, I'd say I'm about 50% of all of them :-)."

Every standardized personality and intelligence test (IQ) is completely unreliable. As several of my professors have said, none of those tests should be taken seriously (criminal court cases, job application process for example). They should only be used as a ""recreational"" activity. Like you said, ""which personality in Seinfeld are you?"" is a perfect comparison. Now if only those over at /r/INTP would understand/believe that. The MBTI and other personality tests are a lot like horoscopes. You can find a trait in yourself that matches with your results and makes you think, ""wow! that is spot on!"""

It's seems odd that an ""introvert"" will reach out to find social common ground with others about how unsociable they are. Reddit is truly one of the great examples of why tests like this are deficient. Millions of people who identify themselves as incapable of proper social interaction are actually able to do so just fine if given the proper context."
vagabond,33fd4k,interestme1,5,Wed Apr 22 07:00:29 2015 UTC,"Ugh, as a self identified introvert, ugh. Does 'introverted' really mean 'incapable of social interaction'?"

vagabond,33fd4k,_drybone,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:26:00 2015 UTC,"In the MBTI sense, no it doesn't mean that.  Jung invented the term and the MBTI is based on Carl Jung's work.  It means ""inwardly directed"" as opposed to ""outwardly directed"".  Now, the most popular personality measuring system in current psychology is the Big 5.  The Big 5 definition of extroversion is intended to measure social characteristics which is a deviation from the classical definition of extroversion and introversion."
vagabond,33fd4k,INTjaded,3,Fri May 15 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"The MBTI is just a slightly more advanced version of a ""Which personality in Seinfeld are you?"" type of thing you see on Facebook all the time   That's pretty much what I think of this test, probably about as accurate as a horoscope.   Also, from your description of an introvert, I'm guessing you're more extroverted. I don't know about the psychological definition of an introvert, but being hidden away in the woods away from everyone doesn't sound like a good time to me. I like to be around people (well, certain kinds of people), but I tend to keep my thoughts to myself, at least until they are fully formed."
vagabond,33fd4k,_drybone,2,Wed Apr 22 04:46:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't identify myself as either an extrovert or an introvert in all contexts, my point was more that one of the great joys of vagabonding is meeting and relating to new people. To have a successful and fulfilling experience as a vagabonder you would have to at the very least be comfortable around new people, if not positively jazzed at the idea.   Introversion is truthfully not as great a predictor of this as optimism probably, except for in extreme cases (such as autism). Overbearing cynicism is the surest way to distrust a new potential friend and aid, and the quickest way to miss out on opportunities as they arise. Unfortunately the MBTI doesn't cover that one.  The typical definition of introversion and extroversion is basically the question that the MBTI asks you six ways from Sunday: Are you energized by social interaction or does it tire you? Of course that is an oversimplification of how we interact, and most people who believe they are one or the other will have something of a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby they use this fairly arbitrary label as a crutch for deficient behavior (eg. I can't help that I don't want to meet new people I'm just an introvert), and thus slide more to one direction than would happen otherwise."
vagabond,33fd4k,interestme1,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:47:38 2015 UTC,"You've taken ""the test"" several times?  Which one is that again?  There are dozens of imitation ""MBTI"" tests out there and many of them are garbage.  Now the actual MBTI, which is owned and administered by a for-profit organization, has been scientifically analyzed in thousands of studies.  It is known to be imperfect but absolutely does have measurable validity.    The MBTI is based on Jungian Typology and there is a lot of non-MBTI study of Jung's work as well.  While some people will never type neatly into one of 16 types, if you're on some random Internet site, even with clear test results you might find yourself reading a poorly written, half-plagiarized profile that is little better than a horoscope.  That said, there are good tests and well written profiles out there.  The best I know of is Personality Junkie.

vagabond,33fd4k,INTjaded,1 point,Fri May 15 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"I've taken the test administered by the university where I studied psychology several times. That wasn't an imitation it was the most scientifically accepted version. Most people don't fit neatly into one of the 16 types through their whole lives, or even through a whole year. While I admire the effort to describe different personality types, this and other tests I've been exposed to thus far are much too simplistic to adequately describe the fluid and complex personality of an individual. It needs to take more external factors into account.  At best it's just a fun triviality that partially describes what someone may identify with in a particular period of time. At worst, it is another detrimental case of psychology models grouping people too aggressively and causing a self fulfilling prophecy for people who take it too seriously."
vagabond,33fd4k,interestme1,1 point,Sat May 16 22:00:10 2015 UTC,"Jung's theory was about information processing.  It's not about how people act, but how minds deal with sensory information.  The confusion in testing happens when people find themselves identifying with how they act rather than who they are.  Self typing can be difficult and even the MBTI has issues (it's imperfect as I said above, despite having scientific validity).  The MBTI was a test devised to determine one's preference for Jungian functions, but it did so by separating the functions into parts... Jung had judging and perceiving functions and these would either be introverted or extroverted in direction.  There was no ""extroversion"" as a thing unto itself.  People who are still interested in Jungian typology are lately moving beyond the MBTI and looking directly at these functions.  If the MBTI is a flawed test, it doesn't mean that the underlying Jungian typology is flawed.  In short, it's easy for people to mistype even with a good test. You really can't reject Jungian typology without first understanding the theory of cognitive functions that underpins it.  If you wanted to know more about that, then at least read this page and the follow up (Typology 201):  http://personalityjunkie.com/typology-101/  The reason I'm so strongly interested in this stuff is that I've always typed as an INTJ and never wavered from it.  The authors of this website have written the most accurate things about Jungian typology that I've ever seen.  They're much more grounded in the underlying theory than many typology sites which often read like horoscopes.  Spend a little time poking around there (you don't need to buy the books, 90% of what's in them is on the website)."
vagabond,33fd4k,INTjaded,1 point,Sun May 17 16:00:55 2015 UTC,"It would be a bit misleading to say it's not at all about how people act, as that is a key part of information processing. As I said, I was a psychology major and studied this fairly in depth. This work, as with all personality typing, is interesting and certainly not in of itself a bad thing. What I don't like is what is in section 2 of that link, which posits that one can derive life, relationship, career, and deep personal meaning from categorizing a person as 4 dichotomous traits. Though there is certainly some truths to be uncovered with things like this, they most certainly are far too weak of tools to be wielded in such important endeavors.   Let me ask it this way. Eventually, possibly soon, we could replace this test with one where we actually observe someone's brain as they go through situations similar to those given on the test. Do you think there will just be 16 variations on the results that are seen? Would you expect the person's brain to light up the same way every time throughout their lives? I would expect to see numerous subtle variations based off the person's past experiences, relationships, setting, and many other things. Someone processing information a certain way is far more likely to be the result of many life experiences and neuronal nuances than a personality group type. It's really the problem I have with a lot of psychological modeling. It's only a small portion of the truth, and as such should only be used in a small portion of circumstances (namely trivial ones for fun because humans like belonging to groups or extreme ones where no better tool exists).   I very much doubt you act or process as an INTJ is purported to act and process in 100% of situations, even if you test as such repeatedly. The most scientific of these tests skirt around this by saying things like ""generally"" and ""tend to"", which ironically enough is exactly the sort of language a J wouldn't be likely to tolerate. The thing is people really only conform to groups like this if they truly believe that they belong to one group or the other, and even then it's only some of the time. But that to me is a far more freeing realization, that you can and do go through all the spectrums of personality at various times throughout your life. You aren't relegated to spend your whole life through the lens of an INTJ, you can experience the full monty."
vagabond,33fd4k,interestme1,1 point,Mon May 18 04:00:49 2015 UTC,"Concerning whether it's about how people think or act, Jungian Typology is about how people gather and synthesize information (perceiving functions) and then what to do with that information (judging functions).  Judging is more about the decisions made and how they're made not the actions taken as a result which will indeed vary greatly based on one's environment.  It's also about our preferred way of doing these things not the only way.  Any type can do the things any type does, but it wears a person out to try to think in a way that is not natural to them.  There is an obvious limitation in typing all people into 16 types but that doesn't make the concept useless.  I've spent time online in groups of INTJ and found deep similarities and a lot of superficial differences.  Am I just imagining it?  Well, both the INTJ and the INTP subreddit are equally popular with a ton of subscribers and you'd predict that we should be very similar having only a single letter difference.  In fact, we are quite different and underlying Jungian Typology predicts this.  As it turns out, INTJ and INTP have none of the 8 Jungian cognitive functions in common.  INTJs are Ni>Te>Fi>Se and INTPs are Ti>Ne>Si>Fe.  By the way, the 8 functions are extroverted and introverted variations of F/T (judging functions) and N/S (perceiving functions).  For example, Te is extroverted thinking.  There are alternatives to MBTI style tests that attempt to gauge how much a person uses the 8 functions which, if accurate, would define ones type.  Typically I'll score very high on Ni and Ne, but higher on Ni.  I'll score similarly high on Ti and Te and low on everything else.  The top two functions are definitive however since the function stacks follow a pattern.  If you know your leading function with certainty, then there are only two type possibilities at that point (once again, according to Jungian typology).  Concerning whether you'll see 16 variations in brains, Dario Nardi has done research in this area which does support the existence of discrete cognitive functions.  For that to ultimately support Jung's concepts, you'd need to also demonstrate preference due to some underlying physical mechanism.  You say that I shouldn't be willing to tolerate generalizations as a J type, but you have a very limited understanding of the underlying Jungian typology.  As an IJ type, my dominant function is perceiving not judging.  In the MBTi interpretation, the P/J dichotomy refers to whether or not the strongest extroverted function is judging or perceiving.  As an IJ, my leading function is introverted perceiving (Ni).  I'm open minded but with my auxiliary function being Te my intuition tends to converge to decisiveness in the end.  In summary, I don't think Jungian typology is perfect by any means, but it is useful.  Do I act like an INTJ 100% of the time... of course not.  But I'm acting like one right now...  you strike me as an INTP, but that's just a casual observation at this point.  I don't know you very well."
vagabond,33fd4k,INTjaded,1 point,Mon May 18 13:18:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the more in depth breakdown you're right perhaps I don't understand the typology as much as I supposed. I still would say its uses should be limited to trivial cases, as a fun curiosity more than a true guide to understanding people. Psychological models are necessarily limited and incredibly difficult to accurately test given the number of confounding variables that plague them (especially when self-reporting is involved). Doesn't mean they don't have their place, I just don't think that place is really guiding someone on interpreting human thought and behavior.   I have indeed tested before as an INTP, then again I've also tested as an ESFP. And a couple in between. One time I just read the descriptions without testing and decided I thought the blurb for INTP was most identifiable, so maybe you're onto something."
vagabond,33fd4k,interestme1,1 point,Tue May 19 11:00:35 2015 UTC,"Well, INTPs love to talk in shades of grey and the primary motivation in the life of an INTP is usually the search for important truths as an end in itself (often at the expense of more practical concerns).  INTx's love to talk in depth about subjects and are more at home doing so on Internet forums than any other type.  Look at this chart and you will see that INTJs and INTPs are massively overrepresented in their interest in MBTI on reddit.  It shows that 75% of subscribers to reddit's MBTI subreddits are INxx types.  Another 15% are ENxx types.  ES and IS types just aren't big fans of in depth discussions of ideas... online or off.  Your clear rational arguments suggest T over F.  Those shades of grey I mentioned suggest INxP or ENxP so that makes your INTP or maybe ENTP if you are more extroverted than i realize. However, I doubt it.  You probably wouldn't be on Reddit having this discussion if you were an ENTP.  The author of personality junkie (a PhD) is actually a self-declared INTP.  He's probably written more about the INTP than any other type.  I find his profiles to be the best online and I'm curious what you think of this profile.  That said, I'm a little iffy on his 3 phases of growth sections and generally a little reluctant about talk of inferior functions in general.  http://personalityjunkie.com/the-intp/"

vagabond,33cwsv,saxmaster98,5,Tue Apr 21 14:40:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, there are lots of homeless backpackers that spend part of the year on the AT and PCT trails. Not all backpackers are rich kids with thousands of dollars....some of them are houseless travelers and consider backpacking and wildnerness camping their primary lifestyle.  However, as a vagabond attempting this, you'll need to plan carefully. I would definitely recommend downloading the survival books from our sidebar, especially the books about edible plants, poisonous plants, etc. Also, equally important, you are going to need a portable water filter such as the Sawyer Mini.  Your main problem is going to become FOOD & WATER. Most AT hikers setup food caches along the trail, or kept in temporary storage in towns along the trails. These food drops are pre-planned simply because one cannot carry enough food and water on their backs for the entire hike. So typically a hiker will hike for a few days, stop in a designated town, pick-up their food cache, then hike a few days to the next town, and repeat.  For a vagabond doing this, I would pre-mail packages of food to various towns along the trails. The post offices along the AT are very familiar with this, and they will hold your package for you until you arrive. I recommend lots of beef jerky and trail mix...    As for most of us, we are primarily backpackers that focus a bit more on hitchhiking, trainhopping, and rubbertramping around the USA. Trainhoppers usually stick to walking the tracks, whereas hitchhikers and rubbertramps are primarily on the highways and interstates. However, there are alot of hobos like me that will trainhop and hitchhike part of the year, and then spend part of the year camping in national parks and national forests."

vagabond,33cwsv,SunsetRoute1970,4,Tue Apr 21 15:16:17 2015 UTC,"The problem is when one runs out of food/supplies/money.  There is remarkably little to ""survive"" on, it's not like hundreds of backpackers are going to be able to hike along picking up edible food off the bushes and trees.  Even water is extremely scarce in some areas, especially on the PCT.  Hiking the AT or the PCT requires some serious logistical support.  If you have never read Cheryl Stayed's book, ""Wild"" you should read it.  The idea that one can travel for ""free"" out away from civilization is only true for people that have really made it a point to learn to literally survive on leaves and berries, etc.  IT IS HARD TO DO, VERY HARD.  People who literally live ""off the grid"" on foot normally plant wilderness gardens all along their usual route and harvest a few vegetables as they get to their garden plots.  They travel the same route, back and forth, back and forth, tilling and planting, harvesting, hunting and fishing."

The government asked for volunteers, and the tramps answered the call to become soldiers.  Personally, I fought long and hard against the Vietnam War.  I marched, I demonstrated, I did everything I could think of to hasten the end of the war.  I did not, however, ever disrespect any veterans.  It is never the troops' fault if the Puzzle Palace gets us into a war.  Soldiers do as they are ordered to do.  I did two year's conscientious objector alternative service in a hospital taking care of paralyzed men and boys.  I was sincere when I began opposing the war, but as the years went on, I began to have doubts.  After Vietnam, I enlisted for four years in the Marine Corps infantry.  I was honorably discharged at the rank of sergeant.  I was a squad leader.  Hawks hated me because I refused to go to Vietnam.  My old left-wing anti-war buddies thought I had ""sold out.""  You know what?  Fuck both of them.  I did what I thought was RIGHT, and I don't regret it one bit.  I worked as a truck driver, a construction laborer (called a ""nail driver""), I worked pouring concrete, I learned to weld and worked in several shipyards, I worked in machine shops, and oil industry fabrication shops.  I've  picked apples, and drove an ag truck in wheat and green pea harvest.  I made my living for fourteen years as a welder.  I welded on farms, in shipyards, in a wood stove factory, built burglar bars and off-road truck winch bumpers.  When I got sick of welding, I returned to school, earned a nursing degree and I have worked on-and-off for twenty years as a registered nurse.  I HAVE DONE MY SHARE.  Anybody who wants to look down on me, or belittle my contribution to society can absolutely go fuck themselves.  I've paid my taxes, I served in our armed forces, I built, I harvested, I cared for the sick and injured.  And the entire time I did it, I was a tramp.  And proud of it."

The modern western world is chock full of completely irrelevant jobs that serve no purpose other than moving funds up the ladder of wealth. The hordes middle management people are nothing more than rungs on that ladder.   The reaction of the vagabond lifestyle is not a critique of one failing to contribute to society. It's the feeling of lack of control when someone challenges the way one feels the world should be.   There's certainly a bit of envy involved too, and the misconceptions of how vagabonds actually live and function are a catalyst to that envy. For comparison, people who have paid off their student loans are adamant that student debt not be forgiven, even if there would be some potential societal benefit there.

Working people are in it for themselves not for some selfless martyrdom of contributing to the greater good. I simply see the traveling lifestyle as a better way of doing that (I'm not saying that it objectively is, it's just my opinion, and that's why I like this sub).

I will say though, and this is more philosophical than practical/relevant, that even jobs like teacher and firefigher have some selfish motive (at least, they would for me). I think if I ever do get a career it will be teaching (my passion) but even still I wouldnt be doing it because I am a saint, its just what I ENJOY doing. Makes me happy. I have also been interested in becoming a volunteer firefighter later in my life - that too would be because I think its sweet. Its exciting, there is comradery, you are respected - I think it would be really fun for me. So for me, even being a teacher or a firefighter would be selfish because they are things I think I would take pleasure or satisfaction from. So even still I wouldn't do it in order to contribute to society, that just wouldnt be my motive. If I can contribute and do what I love that's great, but I wouldn't do it purely because I saw it as my societal duty or something."

I also work on farms: coffee farms, apple farms, tomato farms, avocado farms, etc, in the hot sun, working beside mexican and filipino migrant workers that were sent here because MOST AMERICANS are too goddamn lazy and privileged to work on a ""dirty farm"".   It must be easy for a person to call me ""lazy"" while they're sitting in an air-conditioned office, pushing a pen, and munching on a strawberry, meanwhile I'm out in a hot field picking those strawberries for them.

These same people complain that the United States is no longer the manufacturing capital of the world.  If every American lived as frugal as someone who sleeps in a tent or communal housing most of the year this nation would have no problem competing with China or Japan.  I think the real reason they look down on you is because people in this country judge each other by their level of consumption.  They hate you because you don't consume as much as they do, therefore you are inferior.  It's plain old classism.

For their company, sure, they increase value, but there's another marketing guy at another company undoing his work. Contribution to society? IMHO slightly negative, i find a lot of ads quite reactionary and disturbing. Or those nice ladies who do other people's nails. Sure, they make people happy, but only in an indulgent way. They don't create more wealth for future generations. I'm sure the world can cope with shitty nails and still maintain a high degree of wealth. Here's a longer, good read on ""bullshit jobs"".   I think the ground truth is that we need only a small fraction of people to ""contribute"" directly to society to maintain our security and infrastructure (road workers, doctors, farmers, etc...) at a medium comfort level. A large fraction of the people are engaged in producing and wealth (writing ads, creating luxury products and services), which is then consumed by others. Which is totally fine. But they're not servicing society as a whole, or helping us inch closer to some utopia. They don't research, they don't philosophize, their contribution is as much a 0 operation as most vagabonds. They just make the machine larger, but not better. Is their value in that alone, in that hard work? Personally, i don't think so. I don't admire a person who digs a ditch just to fill it up again.  Personal philosophy: you're dragged into this existence without consent, and your existence can be taken away at will. Why would you add to that by forcing people to live according to any more societal rules then strictly necessary? Why do people have to work hard, even if that work is total bs?  PS I switch between full-time employment as an engineer, and bumming.

They who never go to the holy land in their walks, as they pretend, are indeed mere idlers and vagabonds, but they who do go there are saunterers in the good sense, such as I mean. Some, however, would derive the word from sans terre, without land or a home, which, therefore, in the good sense, will mean, having no particular home, but equally at home everywhere. For this is the secret of successful sauntering. He who sits still in a house all the time may be the greatest vagrant of all, but the Saunterer, in the good sense, is no more vagrant than the meandering river, which is all the while sedulously seeking the shortest course to the sea. But I prefer the first, which indeed is the most probable derivation. For every walk is a sort of crusade, preached by some Peter the Hermit (1) in us, to go forth and reconquer this holy land from the hands of the Infidels."" source"
vagabond,33aiqw,neonoir,5,Tue Apr 21 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"Spent about sixteen years off the road, but those seven years I spent as a hobo? It made me the person I am today.  I learned about caring for people down on their luck. Not just driving a Prius to some homeless fundraising, but actually going out there and helping people. I spent enough time among the bums and beggars to understand where they're coming from, and how to help them. I'm out there delivering food, shoes, blankets and toiletries. That wouldn't have happened if I hadn't been a hobo.  I learned about hard work. Oh, even back in the eighties there were trustifarians out there, who were always one wire transfer away from mom and dad giving them food. I wasn't. Didn't matter if I was doing a fortune telling routine, or picking strawberries under the hot sun. I learned, like most of us, that we needed to work to live.   I learned to care about the environment. Not in the ""save the cute panda"" bullshit, but in the same tradition that led to the birth of our National Parks. I've seen how beautiful the wild spaces of this country was, and I fight like hell to preserve them. I pick up the trash along the rivers and railways of my city by hand because of my time on the road.  I learned to not judge people, and to give a shit about everyone regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs. You know, I grew up in an industrial city. I figured the south was full of ignorant rednecks. Being a vagabond means coming in to contact with people from all walks of life. From ganstas to bible thumpers, from illegal aliens to skin heads, I've seen the generosity found in the majority of us, when you strip away the labels.   I don't think I would have been moral without stepping outside society."
vagabond,33aiqw,bobroland,9,Tue Apr 21 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"We don't contribute to the destruction of our environment.   Most of us do, though. Eating fast food, or meat, or subsidized GM corn isn't really environmentally sustainable. Nor is drinking corporate beer. In the case of train hoppers, you're livelihood is based on big, diesel guzzling locomotives carrying stuff like coal and dead trees and paper and plastic all over the place.    We consume the absolute minimum.   This is not a statement that's representative of travelers on the whole.    Hitching a ride or catching a train costs society absolutely nothing.   In many ways this is correct, and likely in all ways it's correct. I've been tempted to try finding out what the loss is from having trains stopped to remove trespassers is. Dispatchers in busy areas usually have their hands full. I've seen (and been on) trains get stuck in holes for hours on end. When the name of the expedited intermodal game is speed, every second counts.   Of course the biggest cost is likely lawsuits. Let your idiot child run around the tracks and grease the rails and you've got a multi-million dollar lawsuit on your hands if there's a lack of signage or fences. Litigation is probably the biggest reason you can't freely ride freight trains in the United States.    Hobo culture is a HUGE part of American history   It really starts in the Antebellum era and gains prominence in the Great Depression. Perhaps the paramount irony of hobos is that there's always been a massive public backlash against them, yet they're essentially the prototypes of the ""American Dream"": rugged individuals, setting out on their own to survive on their own terms.   Of course when the Wobblies took hold of hobos, that ruined everything. If there's one thing America hates, it's socialism. So to add to the irony, hobos are essentially the perfect and most antithetical personifications of the American Dream.    In addition, some of us protest for better wages and income equality for those who CAN'T because they're stuck making minimum wage to support their families.   I would argue this demographic is negligible, and again, protesting hobos = communist anarchist socialists = people you can comfortably disregard in American culture. The hobo as a political force to be reckoned with has LONG since been dead.    While some of us do beg in some situations, it's not the norm.   In the train-hopping world, it absolutely is the norm. Flying signs, for example, is begging for money. I've seen all sorts of justifications that it's hard work standing in the sun for hours on end (I'm sure it is!) but in the traditional capitalist sense, it's not, it's never been, it can never be. This goes back to that irony: many hobos I know work really goddamn hard going from seasonal work to seasonal work. In that way they're perfect Americans. To supplement the in-between times, though, flying signs is a good way to make a few bucks. In that way, no longer perfect Americans.   Essentially, this is a normative debate that will never truly die. Protestant work-ethic types will feel entitled to their things because they worked hard in the traditional capitalist sense, and they'll be happy with life. Anarchist/socialist/whatever vagabond types will feel entitled to their lifestyle because it's liberating for them, and they'll be happy with life. Who's right?   I really want to write a paper on this topic. (Summer research project?)"

In the case of train hoppers, you're livelihood is based on big, diesel guzzling locomotives carrying stuff like coal and dead trees and paper and plastic all over the place.    How are hobo's responsible for this? The reason hobo's can't afford to eat gluten-free all-natural organic food is the same reason that 80% of American can't afford to eat healthy: It's too expensive, and difficult to access. Who expects a homeless person to be able to buy organic kale or gluten-free pasta? This is not a symptom of hobo's negatively impacting society, but rather a symptom of American's not having the access and income to procure healthier food. I'd blame the FDA for this, not a hobo trying to scrape up a dollar for a cheeseburger.   We consume the absolute minimum. (This is not a statement that's representative of travelers on the whole.)   I beg to differ. Most vagabonds' entire life's possessions are possessions that are meant to LAST. We don't buy consumer grade crap that is meant to be thrown away and replaced by a new purchase. Everything in my bag is meant to last for YEARS, not weeks or months.   Also consider that most vagabonds own less than 500 dollars worth of gear and equipment. Everything you see on their back is everything they own, and all of it together probably costs less than your TV or Smartphones. And thats not just SOME vagabonds, that's 99.9999% of us. No matter how you look at that, that is considered pretty damn minimalist.   In the case of train hoppers, you're livelihood is based on big, diesel guzzling locomotives carrying stuff like coal and dead trees and paper and plastic all over the place.    That's a bit unfair to blame hobo's for whatever the railroad is shipping. That train is going to exist and continue to exist whether there are hobos or not. Simply because we catch a ride on it does not implicate that we are adding or contributing to the environmental impacts that trains make. We aren't responsible for coal-mines, deforestation, or the plethora of other environmental concerns linked to trains.   It really starts in the Antebellum era and gains prominence in the Great Depression.

This reads more like a personal disgust against socialism and labor unions, which is more of a politicized opinion as opposed to a fair analysis of the history and influence of hobo's in America.  I'd also like to add that hobo's were quite organized during the Occupy protests. I participated in Occupy New Orleans, and nearly 1/3rd of the protestors were politically active hobo's and vagabonds.  Likewise, during the Iraq war protests in San Francisco, I was joined by over a thousand other hobos and vagabonds that were united at the very front of the protest lines. Many of them were war veterans as well."

Most vagabonds' entire life's possessions are possessions that are meant to LAST.   I really don't agree, but our experiences may be different. I have seen/known a lot of kids who just go thrift store to thrift store and exhaust those items. Not that either one is better or worse (I prefer buying stuff that will last for years but not everyone is in the position to do that -- as you said, most possessions total <$500).   That's a bit unfair to blame hobo's for whatever the railroad is shipping.   I agree and I'm not trying to make that case, it's just something I always thought was humorous: Earth First types riding coal cars, etc. To be a hardcore environmentalist and also a vagabond means you have to make a few unpleasant choices regarding your mode of travel.    This reads more like a personal disgust against socialism and labor unions, which is more of a politicized opinion as opposed to a fair analysis of the history and influence of hobo's in America.   Is it wrong, though? Look at what happened with EPIC in the 20s -- Upton Sinclair was promising people the world, but couldn't get FDR's support because EPIC was too radical. Hobos have by and large always been people to fear by the standard American.   [...] nearly 1/3rd of the protestors were politically active hobo's and vagabonds.   What did Occupy actively accomplish? Thomas Piketty's lone book Capital has done more for the inequality debate than all of Occupy. Note that this isn't me trying to deride or belitte Occupy, but I'm not so sure even a well-organized, well-spoken group of vagabond political protesters have the capability of swaying the minds of Americans.  Additionally, what impact did hobos have on changing anything with regards to the Iraq War? Had a graduate student or a welder or a bus driver been in your place, would the impact have been any different?"

Why? If you hitch a ride on a coal car that is already going somewhere, you aren't contributing anything to harm the environment. It's going there whether or not you are on it. You aren't paying to take the ride, so you aren't encouraging the use and shipment of coal. If anything, your train hopping discourages it."

I'm not going to argue on either of those points. After reading through the thread I'm kind of disappointed to see that we still feel the need to justify the lifestyle (for those looking to fire a shot, I haven't started living it yet. But I'm less than a month a way) so passionately as to harbor hatred for a different lifestyle and forsake rationale and empathy. The fact of the matter is that with every lifestyle, another lifestyle will view it as an opposing force to their way of living. Such is the nature of our society. We hate and fear what we do not understand. I think as vagabonds we have an amazing opportunity to transcend that mentality. Vagabonds are just as much a part of society as desk-jockies. Desk-jockies contribute just as little to society as vagabonds. But from where I stand, society isn't something we need to be contributing to anyway. It hinders and segregates us as humans from one another. I have absolutely no quarrel with anyone just because their perspective may be different than mine, on any front. Some may say that I'm perpetuating the justification for negative ways of living. Perhaps on some plane they'd be right. However, by staking one way of living as the better way of living, are we not ourselves giving definition to a negative lifestyle, whatever it may be?  I'm taking to this lifestyle for the very reason that I have no quarrels. I simply want to live peacefully. I can only imagine that is what everyone else wants. Thus, I will let them. So why do we waste time arguing the morality of any lifestyle? Most of us stepped away from the prototypical American way of living because we saw the flaws and cracks. But this way of living will end up no better if we can't cultivate within ourselves what we feel society lacks. I've said it before, but I have a deep sense of commaraderie with any traveler: weary and joyful alike. What I didn't state before is that I feel the same sense of commaraderie with everyone else as well. We belong to the same family; humanity. I've seen the words said time and time again, especially in this subreddit. But it's time for the words to fade and for us to become the essences of that idea. We can't make anyone else take on that responsibility, nor should we. However, we should be holding ourselves accountable if that's truly the way of life we're after. The blame and praise need to be put away in order for us to move forward.  edit: grammar"

vagabond,33anxu,_drybone,1 point,Wed Apr 22 09:20:43 2015 UTC,"Brush with flouride toothpaste every night at least, then rinse once or twice (don't swallow that stuff). Floss well every night - and use mouthwash vigorously for 1 minute immediately after to kill germs dislodged by flossing, especially if your gums bleed (you don't want the bacteria to enter your bloodstream). ""Floss the teeth you want to keep"". A little $1 bottle of mouthwash could last you almost a week. If you grind your teeth, use a night-guard. Try to set money aside over a few years to get your wisdom teeth properly taken care of. This is especially important for young people who are poor and can't afford it, but are at the age when they erupt or impact your other teeth. Start saving early, before you need it. If you can, get a thorough cleaning every six months. A lot of dentists take cash and will have their hygienist will do it for $50 to $100."

vagabond,33ar46,TransFender,9,Tue Apr 21 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"I would strongly advise against sleeping in a hammock for any extended period of time. For a few days, at most, it's fine, but if you plan to do this for several weeks or months, it is eventually going to cause major back and neck problems that will persist for the rest of your life.  Also, replace the 7 watt solar charger with a 15 watt solar charger (trust me, you will NOT regret this upgrade): http://www.amazon.com/RAVPower-Charger-Foldable-Portable-Technology/dp/B00OQ0CAW6/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1429577328&sr=1-1&keywords=15w+solar  Also, get yourself a decent first aid kit. That's a must have if you're going to be doing this solo in the wilderness. Speaaking of wilderness, please take advantage of the wilderness survival books on our sidebar. Put them on your phone, kindle, laptop, thumbdrive, whatever.  Also, it may be worth the extra money to get a camping shovel or folding shovel. Bury your cooler in the ground and your ice will last much, much longer, cutting your costs of buying ice in half, if not more. Another trick is to line the inside of your cooler with a thick trash bag, and then add ice. The bag adds and extra layer of insulation, and will preserve ice longer.  Otherwise, your gear sounds greats. Good luck and post some pictures for us when you get going!"

vagabond,33ar46,40647906,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:49:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I was referring to the hammock in question, the Hennessy Hammock.  As far portable hammocks for vagabonds, there are ""flat-bed"" hammocks like this one that you can adjust for various sleeping sleeping positions so that your back stays straight.  Of course, it cost's much more than the cheaper hammocks, but when it comes to preserving your back/neck, it's a far better long-term sleeping solution.   Or you could just get a tent and tarp, which is by far the most practical choice for most vagabonds and backpackers."

I knew some teenagers up in Michigan whose parents owned twenty acres on the edge of a vast tract of undeveloped land (I'm not sure how much.--a lot.)  The boys built a two-room shed out of scrounged materials and plywood back on the back part of their parents' property.  It had a barrel stove and electricity, but no water.  (They ran an electric wire from the electric service box on the back of their parents' house.)  They had a clean 55-gallon barrel mounted on a cart that they used to haul water from their parents' house out to the shed.   The only thing they used electricity for was powering their stereo, as 1970's rock was usually blasting 24-7.  They actually used kerosene lanterns for light.  They hunted, fished, rode motorcross bikes, etc. on the undeveloped land, and pretty much stayed continuously baked for weeks at a time.  I used to kid them about thinking they were Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. BTW, you can bathe very well in a 5-gallon bucket.  Wash clothes too."

vagabond,339jz3,anonymousindividual7,19,Mon Apr 20 19:01:50 2015 UTC,"All of the above, really, but that would be pretty expensive to supply all of those things.  As far as material goods, I think sleeping bags and socks are probably the items in most demand.  As far as getting people off the streets, most of the people begging and sleeping on sidewalks aren't just homeless, they are mentally ill, addicted to hard drugs, and veterans of horrible wars. Our nation does NOTHING as our veterans and mentally ill citizens sleep in dumpsters and shit in doorways. We should be absolutely EMBARASSED.  I remember one time there was this girl and guy from Finland that was hitchhiking across America, and I stopped to hang out with them in a park. There were LOTS of homeless, mostly bums, that hung out in that park.The Finnish couple asked me why there were so many homeless people in America, and I told them that atleast half of the people they see in the park right now are skitzophrenic, autistic, severe bi-polar, PTSD, drug-addicted, and veterans of Vietnam and Iraq.   THEY LAUGHED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT I AS JOKING! They simply could NOT FATHOM the idea that a country would allow mentally ill people to sleep on sidealks, or mentally ill veterans of war to become homeless and addicted to drugs. It BLEW their fucking mind! They immediately started asking me ""why aren't they in hospitals? why aren't they in rehab centers? why don't they have healthcare? why aren't doctors checking on them? why doesn't the military help the homeless veterans?""...and all I could really say is ""I dunno, I guess our country just doesn't care about any of them really, or atleast it hasn't cared enough to come up with any viable solutions""...  I thought the Finnish girl was about to cry...it pretty much destroyed any idea they both had about our country, and I'm sure it was one of the first things they told their friends and families back in Finland.  Homeless agencies should unite together and lobby our government about this. Is there actually anybody in DC lobbying for the homeless? I sometimes wonder. That would probably help out much more than a pair of socks or a backpack.   Also, as far as something the general public can do to make our lives easier, that's pretty simple: Please learn the difference between a bum and a hobo...or a bum and a vagabond.   Unknown to the public, most hobos and vagabonds are quite sensitive to that, and I think that creates a bit of tension and confusion with our crowd. For example, you don't really approach a hobo or vagabond like you would a bum. We're usually not beggars, and we work as we travel. It's kinda weird and demoralizing when someone walks up to me to offer me a peanut butter sandwich right after I just got through eating a full meal that a paid for with my own money. I usually just smile and say ""no thank you"", or either I'll take it and give it to the next bum I see. However, it does kind of bother me that society automatically assumes that anyone living without a house is by default a hungry beggar. It's almost like if you happen to be wearing a backpack, you're a beggar, which in turn leads some people to think we're freeloaders or some sort of drain on society."
vagabond,339jz3,huckstah,3,Mon Apr 20 21:07:17 2015 UTC,"It's kinda weird and demoralizing when someone walks up to me to offer me a peanut butter sandwich right after I just got through eating a full meal that a paid for with my own money.   Similar happened to me twice as I was backpacking: first time I just had finished a doner kebab in front of a large church in Eindhoven and decided to sit there (dressed in army pants and hoodie) for some time cause I was tired from all day working. All of a sudden a woman came by and offered me a large bag of Thai food. I thanked her, but declined, trying to explain I was staying in a hostel and just had finished a meal.  Second time was in London. I went to a KFC (mostly to use their restroom, tbh) and ordered only a small portion of french fries. As I sat down, one of the construction workers sitting there approached me and asked if I wanted to have something else. I was quite puzzled and didn't realize at first that he offered to buy me some more food. This time I also declined.   I usually just smile and say ""no thank you"", or either I'll take it and give it to the next bum I see.   I thought a lot about those two instances and how to react. Both times the good people who wanted to help me seemed to be quite puzzled as I declined their offer. The woman in Eindhoven even seemed to be very embarrassed.  So I think, next time something like this happens, I'll just accept the offer, thank cordially and pass it to someone in need if possible.  What do you think?"
vagabond,339jz3,_forgotmynameagain_,5,Tue Apr 21 09:17:00 2015 UTC,Free showers.  Seriously.  That would make a huge difference for minimal expense.
vagabond,339jz3,_Zeppo_,4,Tue Apr 21 04:28:20 2015 UTC,"1.)  Public restrooms with showers and a place to lock up your stuff where it will be safe while you shower. 2.)  Free Laundromats so you can wash your clothes. 3.)  A way to get whatever medications you need without having to ride a bus halfway across town and sit in some crappy waiting room forever just so you can see a doctor for ten seconds and get your prescriptions renewed for 30 days.  Then you have to do the whole thing again next month.  I'd rather just not take the meds.  The whole medical thing is entirely too much hassle.  Why not write prescriptions for 90 days, like the rest of America? 4.)  Recycle centers that will pay you in cash for aluminum cans, scrap copper wire, deposit bottles, etc. without ripping you off. 5.)  Temp job agencies that won't rip you off or charge excessive fees for stuff like hard hats or work gloves. 5.)  A ""private property"" park  where you are PERMITTED TO DRINK A BEER without getting hassled by the police.  The police officers in some cities act like it is some major felony for unemployed people to enjoy themselves, listen to music, and just hang out.  If I wanted to work and have an apartment or a house, I would DO that.  I don't want that.  I LIKE living outdoors and not having to worry about rent and bills and landlord's intrusive demands and requirements. I'm going to live a free life regardless, but you asked, so there it is.  And I know full well we'll never see it, so you asking us and us telling you is a complete waste of time."

Prepaid seems like it's the only way to go. It's cheaper. Don't need an address. Don't need a system of payment. Not everyone has the privilege of being on a first tier (3G/LTE) network. Our phones and our networks are an extension of who we want to be perceived as in society. It's actually quite silly. Bigger screens and more speed please.  Access is access though. And that's the point."

No matter what we do, or who we are, we're all just ""freeloading bums"" that are too ""irresponsible to settle down"" or whatever. I really think it's so that they can legitimize and justify their boring and pathetic lives, and so they can only do that by making us look bad or look immoral, therefore making their sad lives justified.

vagabond,336y4p,huckstah,6,Mon Apr 20 06:23:08 2015 UTC,"I have a question for huck that I know is going to be unpopular but I have to ask anyway - How come if you are homeless by choice then fuck you? Why cant people who have other options but would prefer to live nomadically or ""rough"" do it?"
vagabond,336y4p,2xws,12,Mon Apr 20 06:55:07 2015 UTC,"First of all, I really have no prejudices towards other travelers. I just sort of see everything in a ""c'est la vie"" approach, and I think its awesome if anyone can do this lifestyle no matter their circumstances.   There's a fine line between what is considered a ""choice"" or not. Sometimes you DO have other choices, but isn't is kinda like choosing the lesser of evils? I don't consider that a ""choice""...I consider that as someone that is unhappy, and all there other choices are so shitty and mundane that the best choice is to just DROP everything and hit the road! Did you have other choices? Sure! But weren't those choices pretty shitty? Yep! So hey, hit the road man! I totally agree!  At the beginning of my lifestyle, I had no choice but to hit the road. After a few months and years of honing my skills and learning how to sustain this lifestyle as a vagabond as opposed to a bum, this lifestyle is now my choice. I understand both sides, and I have nothing but love for ANYONE that chooses this lifestyle.   My ""fuck you"" was NOT directed with that intent, or directed towards travelers that had other choices. This is just mistaken out of context, or maybe how it was written by the journalist, I'm not sure.  As far as my ""fuck you"", that was directed towards people that assume most of us started this lifestyle as some sort of ""fun"" or ""adventurous"" choice simply because we were simply lazy or irresponsible citizens. FUCK that OPINION: most of started off because we didn't really have any options left, and we hated whatever depressing situation we were in. That's not being lazy or irresponsible, that's simply getting out of a depressing situation so that we can seek a better and more viable future. That's what we do, and for me and many others, it was the best decision we've ever made. We're happy now, and we'll definitely say ""Fuck You!"" to anyone that considers us as irresponsible and freeloading bums."
vagabond,336y4p,huckstah,3,Mon Apr 20 09:20:26 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you so much for the reply. Awesome to clear that up and I understand what you mean.

vagabond,336y4p,2xws,2,Mon Apr 20 09:28:29 2015 UTC,"If you're unhappy, try it out.

No matter what, if life makes you unhappy, you always have the option to hit the road and find what does make you happy. We will be here to assist you in doing that if you ever find it necessary, and you will certainly get no hate from me or other travelers.

It seemed, to me atleast, that you were enjoying our sub and even contributed by making a funny and entertaining post, however uncreative.   Awesome, right?  And now, just hours later, you are bashing me personally, bashing our entire lifestyle, and making it seem like all vagabonds are just irresponsible assholes that are too lazy to rent an apartment. The fuck?  So, what is your fucking deal here in our subreddit?   I'll be honest, you sound like an elitist and conservative condescending asshole to me, and it's leading me to think that the only you reason you posted the Onion article is because you are actually making fun of vagabonds, trolling our forum, and disrespecting our overall community.   As a vagabond, I'm generally a pretty open-minded and forgiving dude, but I'd really like to know what justification you have for this, and why you continue to visit a subreddit of houseless travelers you apparently have no respect for."

vagabond,336tks,Betazerg_,8,Mon Apr 20 02:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'm an Atheist but Jesus Christ is one of my biggest heroes, especially as a vagabond.  Whether I believe in religion or not is irrelevant to me when it comes to Jesus Christ. He was a very great man that traveled as a vagabond with other vagabonds, going town to town, spreading gospels of peace, love, and forgiveness. He went so far as to challenge the corrupt Jewish establishment, as well as the entire Roman empire. He was a true revolutionary that became the most famous vagabond on Earth, and he was tortured and killed because of his threat to corrupt politicians and religious leaders.  I also carry a St. Christopher pendant everywhere with me as good luck. St. Christopher is the patron saint of travelers and vagabonds.   I've learned on the road to just be more open-minded and accepting towards everyone. I used to be a douchebag like some of the people you see on /r/atheism, criticizing and hating others beliefs. But these days, I've found that there is alot of good in alot of religions, and you just have to find your own way of filtering out the good from the bad and finding your own belief.   Also, that new pope y'all have seems like a pretty good guy also...he has helped the homeless out alot in Vatican City. Checkout these links:  Pope Francis Sneaks Out Of The Vatican At Night To Serve The Homeless  Pope Francis Surprises Homeless Visitors During Private Vatican Tour  Pope Francis to build showers for homeless in St. Peter’s Square"

vagabond,336tks,symzvius,13,Tue Apr 21 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"I began to read Henry David Thoreau about six months ago, and his work sent me on a spiritual and philosophical quest. I wanted to downsize my life physically and sell all the things that i am attached to. So I went ahead and did that. Then I started to read Buddhist In Theravada books and it was all beginning to come all together. During one of my meditations, I focused solely on a quote from Walden that I had translated into the present.    ""I wish to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I can not learn what it has to teach, and not, when I come to die, discover that I have not lived. I want to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that is not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.""   During the meditation, it felt as if my mind was wearing rose-tinted glasses, through which I was viewing the false version of reality that is my preconceptions and prejudices.  The views I had on almost everything shattered when I realized these misguided notions were influenced by the subjectivity of the society I was raised in. I had an epiphany of what raw, unfiltered existence was.   I realized what is core to the human experience;what is there before culture conditioned my views and desires.  Life is most beautiful and pure when you are both physically and mentally free.  ""Do I really want this, or do advertisements and other propaganda tell my subconscious to want it?""  There is a whole world out there to explore. Having the same horizon for too long destroys the unpredictability of the future. If you explore this planet with your own eyes you will fully realize the entirety of existence.  There is an overarching wholeness to all of the universe. Every single action that occurs, performed both by us conscious beings and insentient forces of nature such as gravity and wind, influences another action, which then influences another, and another, and another. An infinite amount of reactions occur from a single action.   Dropping a small pebble in center of a large pond will create a ripple that'll touch the shore.   This revelation was a kind of spiritual ecstasy. It was as if I had been wearing glasses I didnt need on my mind, and those glasses caused my mental vision to be blurred. Once the glasses of prejudice, preconceptions, cultural conditioning, and expectations were taken off, I viewed existence and the present moment with such stunning clarity.  True happiness and true freedom lie in the nomadic, Spartan-like way of life. When one is constantly facing new experiences, when every day brings new scenery and a new setting to the production of life, freedom is found.    ""Most of the luxuries and many of the so-called comforts of life are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.""   I apologize for taking so long to explain that, but I was finally able to allow my abstract, loose thoughts to finally take form in the physical world. They make more sense now then they did when they were only thoughts."

vagabond,336tks,SunsetRoute1970,4,Mon Apr 20 12:35:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a Christian, and I came to that realization while hitchhiking west on I-10 in 1971.  Without going into a lot of detail, I was in a bad situation, about to be arrested (the cops were about 200 yards away, arresting some other guys.)  I was an atheist and an anarchist, but for reasons I cannot explain, I said out loud, ""Okay, God, if you are really real, get me out of here.  I want to go to Phoenix, not to jail.""  About the same time I said this, a station wagon coming towards me abruptly changed lanes, pulled off the road and stopped.  It was at least 100 yards away, or more, when I spoke out loud.  I grabbed my pack and jumped in.  A woman was driving.  She floored it and off we went.  I thanked her.  She was very conservatively dressed, hair up in an up-do, three-quarter sleeves, high neckline on her dress.  She was clearly an evangelical Christian woman. She said to me, ""Son, I am forty-four years old, and I have never picked up a hitchhiker in my life, but Jesus came into my heart and told me to pick you up.""  I tried for years to deny it.  I minimized it.  I told myself it was coincidence.  I tried not to believe.  But in the end, I came to know Jesus Christ.  And my mission is to spread the Gospel.  Those that don't understand or believe cannot possibly be any more atheist than I was.  I was filled with anger and hatred towards the wealthy and powerful.  But Christ wants all people to come to Him, including the wretched sinners in the gutter and the jails, as well as the vain and arrogant rich people.  I believe they will all accept Him eventually.  I don't think I'm special, I'm just a tramp.  But I am a Christian tramp, and God has a plan for me, as He does for everyone.  If God wills it, even the hardest heart will open."

vagabond,336tks,caymatt,6,Tue Apr 21 02:22:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a Christian (I know that starting this comment off that way is a dangerous thing to do, but hey, I want people to know where I'm coming from with all of this).   You're onto something with the John the Baptist. Keep in mind though that he was a prophet - they tend to live weird lives. I'm into the whole locust and honey lifestyle though.   Then there's Jesus, who fasted out in the wilderness for more than a month. He wasn't the only one though; I think Jesus' time in the wilderness shows readers that he was someone to be taken seriously - a lot of major figures in the Bible before Jesus had wilderness experiences before they went out and did big things. Jesus was following a trend.  There's also Jesus' life. He was a total vagabond between the time He was baptized and His death: ""When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” But Jesus told him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”  He also said, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”  The way I see it, money and things are to be used as means to ends. They aren't inherently bad, but idolizing comfort, things, money, and security isn't a great idea in my opinion.   If you're into reading up on post-crucifixion examples of people groups who have lived this vagabond lifestyle out, research the persecution of Mennonites (and Anabaptists in general) during and after the Reformation. There's some serious history of frugality, travel, and simple living to be discovered there."

vagabond,336pqu,huckstah,5,Mon Apr 20 02:12:35 2015 UTC,"I started because I had other choice to make...  I was a black sheep, getting in trouble with the law (minor shit like marijuana), and I had no job or educational oppurtunities available to me. I lost my place to live, and there I was, suddenly on the streets.  After hitting the street for the first time, there were some hard times and I had to learn all the tricks and tips of being homeless in America. Where to sleep, where to eat, how to find work, how to travel, etc.  After eventually meeting other people that were just like me, I figured how to go from being homeless to being a vagabond, a sustainable traveler. I simply fell in love with the freedom and adventure of that lifestyle, and decided not to re-integrate into normal society.  In the last 11 years, I had a few chances to stop, get an awesome job, live in an awesome place, but within a few weeks or months I just find myself unhappy and want to go back to traveling.  So, at first..I had no choice but to be homeless. And now, being houseless IS my choice.  As far as women, yes, there are TONS of female hobos and vagabonds. I would say that the rise in female travelers is the biggest increase in demographics of our society, particularly in the past 25 years. Females today are more confident and stronger than females of the past, and they no longer let societal stereotypes and rules hold them back from doing things that were once considered ""male-only"".   As fas as finding wifi or electricity, we just hit up places like starbucks, the local library, stores, etc. Some of us have solar chargers and external battery packs.  In terms of food, we all eat really good. I don't know any vagabond that is scared of where he is going to find food.

I've been looking for about a month to get some sort of summer job in the fishery industry up in Alaska. The problem is that I'm only available to work during May and June, because I've got plans in July. I've already tried calling a bunch of different canneries, but they all told me that they don't hire anyone until July. What? Well ok then.  Anyway, my plan WAS to hitch up to Seattle, then take a ferry to SE Alaska and do as much manual-labor as possible for the months of May and June...but without some sort of job confirmation, I'm kinda worried about going up there and floundering.  Do you have any tips for me or contacts I could try who would be hiring? I'm 24, in good shape, not afraid of work, and I also love the ocean.  I'm really impressed that you applied to over 100 places, but kinda disheartened because I KNOW that's a lot of work. Frankly it's hard finding the places to apply for in the first place.  I dunno, your description about the type of work is pretty much exactly what I'm looking for, but my problem is I'm too green with this sort of thing.  If you've got any tips for me, I'd appreciate it. And if I do get to make my way out West, it'd be cool to cross paths."

vagabond,3338q9,Neon_Jam,3,Sun Apr 19 17:34:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting. This model seems more convenient and effective.
vagabond,3338q9,Verndari,2,Sun Apr 19 21:20:10 2015 UTC,Thank you! I was looking for this. This is the easiest stove I've made and it works really well. The key to an even burning stove is to have the holes evenly spaced and the same size. This kind of design takes a lot of the guess work out of it and saves me from poking my fingers while trying to make the holes.
vagabond,3338q9,_drybone,5,Mon Apr 20 01:45:55 2015 UTC,Is that just lighter fluid that he puts in that?
vagabond,3338q9,1YearWonder,8,Sun Apr 19 04:56:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure what. Most hobos use rubbing alcohol or denatured alcohol.  For the price and burning times, I recommend 99% Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol. 91% Isopropyl works also, but it takes a couple of minutes longer to boil a cup of water, however it's also cheaper.  As far as fuel is concerned overall, you can use lighter fluid, heet, pure grain alcohol (everclear), methanol, ethanol..."
vagabond,3338q9,runescapethug,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:47:49 2015 UTC,That's спирт which is Russian for rubbing alcohol.

vagabond,3338q9,_drybone,2,Sun Apr 19 23:43:16 2015 UTC,probably cotton
vagabond,3338q9,Sandvichette,2,Sun Apr 19 23:43:33 2015 UTC,Its a wicking material. You can use anything from cotton swabs to perlite. It holds the alcohol and releases it more slowly. It must be about efficiency because these stoves work without it.
vagabond,3338q9,Ezraah,2,Mon Apr 20 01:31:31 2015 UTC,cotton

vagabond,3338q9,_drybone,9,Sun Apr 19 23:47:49 2015 UTC,"Weather permitting, I usually cook most of my food on an open pit. I cook my can of beans by setting the can directly on the coals, or I'll cook my fish/meat wrapped up in aluminum foil pockets and placed directly on the coals.  However, there is a time and place for using hobo stoves. For me personally, there are two main scenarios that I'll use a hobo/can/alcohol stove.   1) Wet conditions when all the wood and kindling is damp, and you can't start a normal fire.  2) Areas that you have to stay low-key/ninja and cant build a camp fire or produce lots of smoke/attention, etc."
vagabond,3338q9,ClodKnocker,2,Sun Apr 19 09:32:55 2015 UTC,I'm surprised you light fires that often. That explains the two hand chainsaws in your pack.

If you're alone, theres something about a fire that is almost like having a second person with you...its mesmerizing and entertaining to watch, and its alive. I'm not a pyromaniac by any means, but I do love the comfort of a fire."
vagabond,3338q9,_drybone,2,Sun Apr 19 12:58:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, makes total sense to me. My mother lives in a very comfortable house with my father and pets for company... and she still likes to have a fire in their woodstove, more often than not for similar reasons you described. There's nothing like sitting by the fire."
vagabond,3338q9,ThatBitterJerk,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"You probably already know this, but be careful about directly heating cans on a fire. Most cans are lined with materials to protect the food from the can and they'll melt and become toxic when heated."
vagabond,3338q9,_drybone,4,Mon Apr 20 14:59:24 2015 UTC,"This is quicker than collecting wood and building a fire (especially if it's wet out), it's quicker to put out, less likely to leave a mark, less smoke (depending on the fuel I guess).  That's all assuming you've actually got the materials for it and/or already made the stove."
vagabond,3338q9,ThatBitterJerk,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:48:14 2015 UTC,What is your opinion of a small wood burning stove like this for cooking on?
vagabond,3338q9,kd0ocr,1 point,Sun Apr 19 10:11:09 2015 UTC,That seems really expensive for what it is. I've seen similar stoves made from two tin cans. Its a large can with the bottom cut off and a hole in the top just big enough for a smaller can to fit through and catch on the rim. Both cans had a bunch of little holes in the bottom for ventilation. Fuel goes in the smaller can so it sits up off the ground and out of the wind.

vagabond,333iix,jikacle,7,Mon Apr 20 04:54:36 2015 UTC,"I have met a lot of young people who seem determined to be as antisocial and stand-offish as they can be.  They seem to hate every single aspect of what I consider to be ""normal"" tramp life.  They profess to be anarchists (I became an anarchist in 1968, when I was in high school, and studied the major anarchist writers for years) but the way they live their lives has virtually nothing to do with actual anarchist philosophy, and much more in common with nihilism.  Anarchists believe that one should live one's life in a way that DOESN'T REQUIRE LAW AND GOVERNMENT.  The young ""anarchists"" I know seem to be determined to prove that law and government are absolutely required, and that some more-or-less benevolent form of government, like representative democracy, isn't going to be adequate to get them to live a life free of violence and criminality.  It's as if they are daring society to crush them with fascism.  They dress as weirdly as possible and behave in ways calculated to piss off the regular citizens in the towns they visit.  All this bullshit is virtually guaranteed to result in a crackdown by the cops on trainhopping and tramp life.  Montana was a tramp haven for over a hundred years.  But misbehavior and an arrogant, entitled and criminal attitude by some (not all) members of the FTRA in the 1980s resulted in all the states (through which the High Line ran) passing laws severely punishing activities that were never a problem when I first started riding trains in 1970.  People cannot act hostile and violent towards ""normal society"" and not expect normal society to crush them.  All this weird-ass behavior is going to result in extreme repression.  At the same time, these people say they miss the easy, carefree life that trainhoppers lived ""back in the day.""  Well, tramps were not provoking the authorities back then.  We embraced the same culture that the citizens did.  If you turn yourself into ""the enemy"" don't be surprised when the larger society treats you like the enemy, i.e. harsh as fuck."
vagabond,333iix,SunsetRoute1970,3,Tue Apr 21 04:24:33 2015 UTC,Are jungling and jungle terms still used?
vagabond,333iix,TheRevMrGreen,6,Sun Apr 19 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Hobo jungles were never like the shanty towns and Hoovervilles of the 1930s.  An actual hobo jungle then, and now, is generally just a bare camp ground, maybe with a fire ring and a few 5-gallon plastic buckets to sit on.  Back in the 1950s (when I was a boy) jungles had steel 5-gallon buckets instead of plastic, but they were essentially the same as now.  There are a few jungles that have a hooch.  Country's hooch in Fulton, KY is/was a very elaborate hobo shack with shelves, a built-in bunk and a wood stove.  The Eureka Hilton, at Eureka JCT in Houston has a gable roof, walls made of shipping pallets and is sheeted on the outside with plywood scraps and plastic political campaign signs.  The UP workers say that the Hilton is known throughout the Union Pacific.  I don't know about that.  Maybe.  There are pictures of the Hilton on the graffiti website, ""12 oz. Prophet."" in the ""Hobos, Tramps and Homeless Bums"" thread.  Most jungles are just a clearing in the trees with a place to build a fire and roll out."

All personnel had to be de-loused, then all uniforms had to be dry cleaned, all personal gear and deuce gear had to be sprayed with insecticide and the entire squad bay had to be steam-cleaned with steam hoses.

If you look for it, Washington has a lot of free campsites, but I don't know of any in that area, I know more of them on the Olympic Peninsula.  If you go through Montana and feel like hiking/backpacking Bozeman, MT has a wilderness area called Hylite that has a ton of waterfalls up the trail and you can camp anywhere on it, (it also has a lake with car camping capabilities.) Montana has a lot of BLM land which is awesome for what you'll want to do.  I don't advise staying in Idaho unless you go way up north."

Tucked within a quiet neighborhood and you will completely go unnoticed for however long you plan on staying. I don't know if the spot has been blown up since but if you are interested PM me and I can give you directions. There might be someone squatting there already but you are welcome to check it out for yourselves.  I spent two nights in downtown Seattle and will never do that again... definitely prefer Queen Anne or Magnolia. It's kinda shitty walking up and down the hill with a pack but it's not too bad.

vagabond,32pat4,Vagabond-Wannabe,23,Wed Apr 15 16:52:46 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the people on here mean well, but their advice kind of sucks for somebody who is unemployed and living with her mother.  $2-3,000 for gear?  Are you insane?  I could probably travel for years on three thousand dollars. Buying a bunch of gear when you don't know anything about it is a bad idea.  What you need is information (which you are getting here) and experience.  I strongly recommend that you start out just by going camping right where you live, instead of heading out halfway across America, far from hearth and home.  The big advantage is that you can always go home if the chit hits the fan.  I suggest you start off by taking simple day trips, camping trips where you can go there and back in one day.  State parks and national parks are a good, relatively safe destination.  It seems like you're really out in the boondocks, but really you aren't. IMHO, the first purchase should be decent footwear.  Remember, you will be carrying weight.  This flattens out your foot.  Everybody has different opinions about boots.  Read some books about boots.  They are expensive, and you don't want to buy boots you will hate.  I have always relied upon military boots, but I'm used to them.  I wore combat boots every day of the four years I spent in the Marine Corps infantry.  They suit me.  They're tough, they wear like iron, but they are not really a super comfortable boot, but they do a good job of protecting your ankles and feet. They must be broken in, if you buy a new pair.   Other people are going to have different opinions about boots.  Listen to everybody, but THINK FOR YOURSELF.  What's best for you?  $300 boots may not be best for you.  Neither may $50 boots from Army-Navy Surplus, or $35 Brahma Boots from Wal-Mart..  It's your feet, your budget and your boots.  Do what YOU think is best.  DO NOT buy a new pair of boots and immediately go hike five miles.  You will wreck your feet if you do this.  Buy boots big enough so you can wear extra socks, AND boot inserts.  Try them on in the store with two pairs of socks and the inserts in the boots.  Stand in the bathtub with your boots on, get them good and wet, then go walk around the block a couple of times.  Go home, take 'em off, remove the inserts and stuff them with newspaper so they'll dry.  DO NOT use a hair dryer on them, it causes the leather to become harder..  Once they are dry again, wet them down with ""neats foot"" oil and start walking around your neighborhood for maybe ten  or fifteen minutes at a time.  Do they cause blisters?  Put moleskin on the irritated area and ""shoe stretcher"" grease on the offending area of the boot.  It takes time to break in a good pair of boots right.  When you're out for a walk, take tennis shoes with you.  If the boots start killing your feet, take them off, put on the tennies so you can get home without wrecking your feet.  Start wearing your boots around the house, wear them when you are just going about your regular day.  Eventually, and without a lot of pain and hassle, your boots will become broken in and comfortable.  Take good care of them and they will last years.  When they get muddy, clean them.  Clean them with saddle soap.  Treat them with Sno-Pruf in the winter time.  Oil them once in a while with neats foot oil.  Once you can walk a hour without blisters or painful areas on your feet, start hiking around your city/town.  Hike in parks, go places you've never been before.  Take water and a map and compass.  LEARN HOW TO REALLY USE A MAP AND COMPASS.  It's important.  Start considering what pack you want and what pack you can AFFORD.  Bigger is not better, especially for a woman or a slightly built man.  I carry a 1967 military surplus pack called an ""ALICE Large.""  This would probably not be a good pack for a woman unless you are as big and strong as the average man.  If you are 5'10"" and like kickboxing and rugby, maybe.  For the average woman, you need a pack that you are unlikely to overload.  Shop for at least fifty packs, and REALLY EXAMINE THEM CLOSELY, before you buy a pack.  Go to REI, check out a bunch of them, including military surplus packs.  Mil-spec gear (""military specification"") is extremely durable and tough, but it is usually heavier than civilian gear.  Outdated military gear (like ALICE packs) is much cheaper than ""current military issue (MOLLE (1980s), ILBE (current issue.)  (ALICE is an acronym that stands for ""All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment.""  MOLLE stands for ""MOdular Lightweight Loadbearing Equipment.""  ILBE stands for ""Individual Load Bearing Equipment.""  Balance cost, comfort, capacity and durability.  Mil-spec is cheaper, generally speaking  Top name brands are expensive,  Try not to skimp on packs.  They take a tremendous beating on the road.  IMHO, go for tough, not lightweight.  Okay, get some empty 2-liter soda bottles, start weighting your pack.  Start walking around your neighborhood.  If you get thirsty, drink the water!  Water weighs 7.8 lbs per gallon,  It is probably the heaviest thing you will hump, since you aren't humping ammo.  You need at least one gallon, if not two, if you are really going ""off the grid.""  For serious wilderness backpacking, you will need a backpacker's water filter.  They are expensive.  Check 'em out at REI.  Plan a simple meal that you are going to cook in the Park.  You don't need expensive cook gear.  A 1-gallon coffee can (free) equipped with a coat-hanger bail is called a ""gun boat.""   It makes a great all-purpose kettle.  A cheap stainless steel bowl and some silverware from Family Dollar or Salvation Army Thrift Store, and you're set.  I fry in a cheap, stamped-steel tienda frying pan, $6 from a hardware  store in Clinton, Iowa.  Maybe a pot-handler from REI (a couple of bucks) that sort of looks like a pair of pliers.  You will need a P-38 can opener ($1 Army surplus.)  A small bottle of dishwashing detergent makes washing dishes easier.  (RINSE WELL, you don't want the Hershey squirts.)  Build a fire in a fire ring (no cheating, this is a learning experience.)  Cook your meal, eat just like you would in the boondocks.  Sit on a five-gallon plastic bucket.  Eat exactly as you would if you were on the road..  If you absolutely hate it, then maybe being on the road isn't such a great idea for you.  Cooking out of cans is 100% okay.  I eat cold chow out of cans all the time--Spaghettios, pork and beans, beanie weenies, etc.  It's not great, but it's a lot better than going hungry.  Do this several times in different weather.  There is nothing like trying to cook in the rain under a fly tarp to give you some perspective on ""normal"" life.  This kind of experience (cooking in the rain) is a life lesson in the value of something like an MSR multi-fuel Whisperlite International  backpacking stove, or a Butterfly stove.  Yes, they are great.  No, they are not essential.  Water is essential.  Backpacking stoves are a luxury.  Once you think you've got cooking on an open fire down well, start looking into sleeping bags.  Research them.  Learn all about them.  They can be expensive.  Lightweight bags cost money.  WARM bags cost money.  You can use cardboard for ground insulation, but in wet weather it turns to nasty mush.  You need a good DARK COLORED tarp, about 5x8.  I suggest Wal-Mart. but any hardware store should carry camouflage or brown tarps.  Don't buy blue or silver--they show up very well, and will attract the police.  You don't have to have a sleeping bag.  As a young Boy Scout, I camped a lot with a bedroll made of a couple of wool Army blankets and a sheet.  It wasn't bad, a little chilly in winter, down South.  Couldn't have done it up north.  Are you getting the picture here?  You don't need super expensive gear.  Learn by doing, close to Home.  Read books about camping from the library.  If you forget something (toilet paper, Bic lighter, extra socks) trust me, it's a lesson learned that you will never forget.  Accumulate gear little by little.  HUMP WHAT YOU USE, NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED.  If you don't use it, don't carry it."

vagabond,32pat4,Betazerg_,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"Great post, thanks for taking the time to write that.  One idea I've had as someone flirting with the idea of long-term backpacking is to start by sleeping in my backyard only using the things I would expect to have in my backpack when traveling."
vagabond,32pat4,AesirAnatman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:06:18 2015 UTC,This is an excellent idea.  You should actually try this.
vagabond,32pat4,SunsetRoute1970,17,Tue Jun 16 05:44:21 2015 UTC,"equipment: go as light as possible and don't buy crap gear, buying cheep is throwing your money away. go to rei. get a membership. 20 bucks, and anything you buy there, they will replace if it fails or gets too f'd up (usually). plus the dividend is great and they have ""scratch and dent"" sales where members get deeeep discounts.. get sized for the backpack, an Ill fitting bag will ruin life. get THE BEST sleeping bag you can find within your price range, compressable, down filled (mountain hardwear q-down bags keep you warm even while wet.) some stuff is better to get online.. right now I'm bidding on a 150$ bivy on ebay for 5 bucks.. speaking of, bivy sacks are better than tents, weight-wise and less obvious.. the one I'm currently bidding on is gray (outdoor research helium) and I'll look like a rock when I set up under tree/bridge/ditch! a sleeping pad.. there are several types, inflatable, ""self inflatable"", solid.. I use the thermarest folding one, can't pop like inflatable ones and it's super light, if a bit bulky. wool socks, in fact, wool (smartwool is a great product) everything if you can, keeps you warm when wet.. being wet is a thing in the Pacific Northwest where you are heading. I bring a climbing rope everywhere, but that's just my thing. a headlamp, with a red setting, so that when you are outdoors at night you can see but not light yourself up. a canteen, I go stainless steel, Nalgene style.. stainless steel, so that if need be, you can boil water in it. a Leatherman is a great tool to carry. there are all the little things.. but it's very key that you find the right backpack, then load it up to see how/if everything fits. have the peeps at rei help, they live for this shit.  money: can you sing? get a ukulele, and a sharpie. I play music everywhere I go and make more than I ever do when I work the 9-5 I invariably end up getting when I stay somewhere a while. 3 chords and you know 10,000 songs. very simple to play and light. the sharpie is for the classic cardboard sign.. I call sharpies a ""hobo credit card"". never fails that the kid flying the sign by walmart or wherever makes more cash than me when I play my music.. and sometimes you break the string or the whole thing (trains have eaten more than one of my instruments) and need to go do the sign thing. also, you can use the cardboard sign to hitch rides. and the sharpie is great for leaving your moniker, and drawing on a friend who passed out with their shoes on. there is wolfing, which is just like, working temp labor jobs at farms and the like.. I do ""farm work"" in northern California during the fall, sometimes it's amazing. there is sugarbeats closer to you, and cranberry harvest.. and fish season in alaska, though grueling, is worth it. you can apply online, and they will fly you there and back (if it's the right company) and give you room and board. a few weeks of 12-14 hour days with no need to spend hooks it up pretty good, but only if you can hack it. no plane ticket back if you don't finish!    sleeping: super variable. you meet people traveling. i pretty much could get housed up everywhere now. things play into one another, because i play music, people often approach me offering a shower ect. most folks have a 3 day limit. on the couch surfing web site I have only hosted, have never been hosted. haven't tried really. I sleep In the rough lots... being discreet is important, trespassing is something that WILL happen, so keep in mind that waking up early is vital to not being harassed by cops.  safety: I'm of the school of thought that anybody regardless of gender can kick ass, and that it's all technique. but what's the best technique? NOT GOING ALONE! find a like minded kid. company is golden, makes every long walk shorter. make sure you get along and that you and the other are mature enough to handle stress, because there will be arguments from time to time. I would carry mace or something, and a whistle. if you are determined to do it alone, just stay mentally vigilant. your best defence is not getting into bad situations in the first place.   technology: you likely have a smartphone. that's a computer, use it! if not, get one. I haven't had phone service in  years, yet I'm on my phone right now typing this. wi-fi is free at tons of locations, you can play songs and watch movies, look at Google maps and have access to huck's sidebar here on r/vagabond. I like pre-paid, if you DO want service you can pay for it, if it runs out you still have wi-fi and all the things. and they are cheap as dirt these days. keep an extra charger.   there are a million things... I could go on and on.. but this sub is full of great advice from legit travellers, so just read all the stuff. the sidebar is dope. use it. I requested a lady friend of mine to join this sub as to help you and the other  females via her personal insights. hopefully she'll be on here soon and can help answer the questions us fellas can't.

vagabond,32pat4,AesirAnatman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:13:21 2015 UTC,"well a plain tarp is a must have. sleeping on the bare ground is just bad for all sorts of reasons, so a tarp can provide protection, from not only the ground (rocks dirty wetness syringes glass thorns sticks bugs) but from rain/wind too. however, there are alternatives, and having the wits to make something work when you have nothing can save your life. I've had my gear stolen, and hell, I didn't start out with the fancy 5 buck tarp I have now. in a pinch cardboard is where it's at, and construction dumpsters often have all sorts of good stuff too. ahhh, the memories, washing dishes under the table for 5 bucks an hour for a Chinese buffet and spending my nights in my cardboard shelter in the alley drinking beer.. shit, anyways I'm waiting for my plane leaving anchorage and I'm goofy tired.. uh, so yeah, now bivy sacks are neat, and I'm really looking forward to putting my new one to work, the advantage of them is that they are pretty weatherproof.. and mine has a bugnet built in.. it could kill me too because it's a bit TOO airtight ha. a lot of them are annoying orange or red colors, and when you're trying to be inconspicuous that's lame.. mine is grey (outdoor research helium bivy) which is ok... but in a pinch a plastic trash bag could provide protection.   I'm gonna take a nap."
vagabond,32pat4,pagandroid,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:34:44 2015 UTC,That's awesome and a good explanation. I heard an argument against tents and bivys from another user saying that they only use a tarp. They wanted to be able to jump up immediately in the case of a not-so-friendly person approaching them in the night. They didn't want to be trapped in a tent/bivy in a potentially dangerous situation. What do you think?
vagabond,32pat4,AesirAnatman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:06:53 2015 UTC,"totally true, but I guess it's all in where you sleep.. I tend to sleep in secret spots. I carry both a bivy and a tarp, the bivy is purely to placate my upper crust sensibilities. I just got back from alaska yesterday, in pdx now.. I used a tent in AK at denali.. but here in portland it's pretty warm so I'm just tarpin' it. my bivy is super compressable, and basically it's for when I'm in a downpour.. but my tarp will be on the ground no matter what.. my SO's bivy is cheaper and more practical for the type of travel we do, and I'm jelly, because it circumvents the ""I gotta get up now 'cuz shit is going down"" scenario.. basically it's a black waterproof bag cover. terra nova is the brand. you could sleep next to black trash bags on the roadside and be invisible! lol."

vagabond,32pat4,HighAngleAlpha0331,4,Wed Apr 15 17:41:39 2015 UTC,"Gear: geartrade.com has good used gear. A quality used bag is far better than a new piece of crap. The important things are: Shoes, Backpack, Sleeping Bag, Shelter, Cookware (in that order). Besides a small water bladder, don't get anything else but that to start.  Clothes: If you can afford merino wool, go for it. At least get some underwear and socks in merino. Start keeping an eye out for sales right now.  Hygiene: Learn how to camp bathe using a small washcloth and a bowl. Start getting comfortable doing it before you go, seriously, start tomorrow. Fill the bowl with warm water, wash yourself down with the cloth rinsing frequently. Stand to dry. Done. Also: Baby wipes. Seriously.  Electronics: Get a small cheap Android cell phone. I recommend a Moto E or Moto G. Install Hangouts, Hangouts Dialer. Get a Google Voice number and merge Hangouts and Voice. Voilla, no SIM card phone calls and text messages any time you're in wifi range. It's also your camera, email, tv, etc Bonus: Load an SD card with music to tune out.  As a Girl: Don't be a girl. Wear loose clothing. Tie your hair up. Sports bras. Walk around with confidence. Wear a fake wedding ring. If you look like an boy from 100', you're good to go.  ... also, don't over think it. Every assumption you have will be completely crushed when you get out there. Do some research, sure... But the best teacher is experience, and there's only one way to get that.    Save your money by not going out. Learn to cook simple healthy meals in one small pan Always have a packet of unscented baby wipes with you. Always. Learn to listen, and in contrast, how to approach people to ask questions You'll find work along the way if you want to. Just hint to people that you're looking for work and don't turn any job that feel right down. What feels right, is right. If something feels bad, sketchy, etc... get the hell out of the situation. You'll soon learn to tell the difference between ""cultured fear gut feeling"" (false positive) and a real gut feeling. Just go for it. The worst that happens is you need to get go back to the lifestyle you had before."
vagabond,32pat4,anywhereness,3,Fri Apr 17 02:38:21 2015 UTC,"Really good advice in this thread. Wanted to add with something that seems missing:  There's no reason you have to go at it alone. Few people start out in the vagabond lifestyle on their own with no experience, and that's even more true for women. Honestly, it seems you're very inexperienced, and if you're at all afraid about things as getting murdered, why wouldn't you just hook up with experienced, like minded folk, and take it one step at a time?  I met a lot of vagabonds before I had the guts to start hitchhiking, and it took quite a few kilometers before I felt comfortable enough to start hitching by myself. After that I did it tons, had a great time. But it took a while before I got to that, and had to learn a lot of lessons the hard way.  My advice? Get in touch with some people through Couchsurfing, the hhing community, or even just backpackers in a hostel, and try to learn from them. If your first trip you're committed to doing something big, on a small budget, slumming it, alone, you're at a very high risk of just having a plain 'ol bad time."
vagabond,32pat4,harveypekar84,3,Thu Apr 16 12:17:16 2015 UTC,"MONEY: 2,000-3,000 dollars worth of gear is way, way, way overpriced. No offense, but I carry probably TWICE the amount of gear that you see on typical backpackers and hitchhikers, and I'd estimate I have around 600-700 dollars worth of gear at the very most.  Just get a 200 dollar back packpack, 100 dollar sleeping bag, 100 dollar tent, and perhaps spend another 100-200 on stuff like headlamp, socks, canteen, cooking stove, knife/multi-tool, first aid kit, pepper spray, and whatever else you think you might need. There is certainly no need to spend over 1,000 dollars, unless you just trying to buy fashionable name-brand over-priced stuff from expensive stores like REI. Go to military surplus stores, or use amazon, and get better quality gear at much lower prices.  You should probably checkout some of the posts on gear here at r/vagabond, and start from there.    SAFETY: As far as safety as a female, find a traveling partner. If you're not going to be hitchhiking, you're only options are taking smelly buses or amtrak trains everywhere. I personally recommend finding a travel partner and just go hitchhiking, but that's just my opinion. You can find tons of safe travel partners here if you make a post asking if anyone wants to join you. There are tons of other travelers on /r/vagabond seeking partners for their journeys too, including other female travelers!    POSSESSIONS: As far as your possessions, just store them at a friend or family members house, or either give it all to salvation army. Store the important stuff, give away all the stuff that doesn't mean anything to you or can be easily replaced later.    PARENTAL OPINION: When it comes to your parents opinion, everyone in life has to make a decision that isn't going to perfectly please their parents, and thats just simply part of growing up and getting out of the nest. My mother certainly wishes I lived a ""safer"" lifestyle, but then again she'd tell you in a heartbeat that she would rather me be a backpacker as opposed to someone that races motorcycles, free-climbs dangerous cliffs, fighting for the military, or the plethora of other occupations and hobbies that are MUCH more dangerous than being a backpacker and houseless traveler.  Just explain it to them in a positive spin, ya know? Show them pictures of backpackers like THIS, so that they don't have some awful vision of you being like THIS. Explain to them the difference between becoming a homeless bum and becoming a ackpacking bvagabond!  Let them know you'll be safe, having fun,exploring America, and living your dream. Send them pics of you at national parks, or meeting other awesome backpackers and having fun, etc.   They'll eventually come around and respect or appreciate your lifestyle. If not, well, like I said, part of growing up is accepting that your parents aren't going to be 100% agreeable with your 100% of your decisions as an adult."

vagabond,32pat4,GOBLINTEETH,2,Wed Apr 15 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"Should I think about some weight training before I make my leave? Perhaps walking around town with a small backpack filled with weights?   Speaking to my experience as a hiker/backpacker (not a vagabond though), weight training and cardio conditioning will help tremendously.  The more experience you can gain while hiking the more it'll help in conditioning your body to be able to handle being a pack mule."
vagabond,32pat4,soloxplorer,2,Thu Apr 16 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"If you are really set on walking I would suggest taking the ferry to Milwaukee and start heading down route 20, you can walk yourself right into Oregon if you so please.. I've walked parts of route 20 and hitched as well on it, very easy scenic route.  However, hoofing pavement 15+ miles a day with the weight of a small child strapped to your back will really make you miss your mommy and a nice warm shower. So plan on hitchhiking if you want to make it to the Pacific Northwest before Fall.  Others have already offered some really good advice so I thought I'd just wish you the best of luck and safe travels!"
vagabond,32pat4,hichet,2,Wed Apr 15 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"I first caught out on freight trains when I was twenty, in 1970, but I was on the road, hitching and travelling with older teenagers who had a car, etc., from the time I was sixteen.  From age 11-1/2 until age fifteen, I was in the Boy Scouts, and I learned pretty much everything I needed to camp and survive in the Boy Scouts.  My Boy Scout experience helped me immeasurably when I was in the Marine Corps.   In all those years on the road, I only had a few really scary experiences, but I did have a few close calls, and I did meet several people who had very, very bad experiences.  Most of the true horror stories happened to people because they were excessively naïve and trusting of other people.   In 1967, when I was sixteen, while surfing in California with some older friends in Encinitas, CA, I met a really cool kid about my same age.  I needed a place to stash my clothes and possessions while we were at the beach, and he said, ""Just leave your stuff in our car, it'll be okay, nobody will bother it.""  He and I were surfing out on the point with a lot of other surfers, and he wiped out and lost his board and had to swim in.  I caught a few more waves, but when he didn't paddle back out, I went in to find out what happened.  The car was gone.  All my stuff, my clothes, sleeping bag, SHOES, my money and everything I owned except a pair of surf trunks, a beach towel and a surfboard was GONE.  I was sixteen years old, on foot, barefoot, at dusk, 1500 miles from home, with absolutely nothing.  .  My friends had gone down south to San Diego to surf at Windandsea.  I was scared shitless.  Luckily for me, when I started asking everybody in the parking lot at Swami's (the surf spot) if they knew the kid with whom I left my stuff, and they said ""no,"" and I told my story, they were sympathetic, and helped me.  Somebody gave me a t-shirt, somebody else gave me a pair of blue jeans, and they directed me to a nearby commune/head shop called ""Noah's Vibrations.""  The hippies at Noah's took me in and the next day my friends found me (pissed off because they didn't know what happened to me) at the beach. NEVER AGAIN.  I learned my lesson in one day.  WHEREVER YOU GO, YOUR GEAR GOES WITH YOU.  You don't leave your stuff with ANYBODY unless you are absolutely 100% sure they are absolutely trustworthy. I travelled all over the U.S. and Canada with gear that probably cost less than $100 in 1970.  I remember I bought a brand new pair of Levis in Canada and they cost $11, and I was outraged that they were so expensive.  I wore an Army surplus field jacket that I paid $6 for, and the liner was an additional $4.  I made my own cook gear out of tin cans and things like steel pie plates I got at Salvation Army.  I carried water in an old style (pre-1965 or so) Clorox jug.  (They were made of a different, much tougher plastic back then than now.)  Today, I use a one-gallon Ocean Spray cranberry juice jug wrapped in duct tape.  They are very tough. There's nothing wrong with good gear, but it can be devastating if you lose it somehow.  There are LOTS of thieves and ripoff artists on the road.  I always ask young women who want to go on the road, ""Do you know how to fight?""  If you do not, I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU to join a martial arts school (Tae Kwon Do is among the best) and LEARN HOW TO REALLY DEFEND YOURSELF.  You need to know how to no-shit really fight.  I know a 68-year-old woman who is a third-degree black belt.  She looks like your grandmother and she is fully capable of completely beating the shit out of every twenty-year-old man you ever met.  She can put any man in the hospital, in traction, in three movements.  She has been studying Tae Kwon Do for twelve years--started when she was fifty-six.  You could become a black belt in about two years, but you could become a proficient fighter in less than six months.  Experience, street smarts and knowing how to no-shit really fight will make you 100% safer."

vagabond,32pat4,_forgotmynameagain_,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:31:08 2015 UTC,"Compared to others here I have very little experience and only experience in UK, so take everything I write with a grain of salt ...   I'd imagine somewhere in the $2000-3000 range is my eventual reality.   I'd suggest to travel lightweight. I was in UK twice for a month each time and my gear was basically this. Photo I took in Bristol.  Only things I bought specifically for travelling was the bagpack (20 € IIRC, used german army backpack), the tarp with pegs and paracord and a rain poncho (~80 €). I already had a (20 years old but quite good) sleeping bag and a sleeping pad. I also already had clothes (obviously), so no need to spend money for that.  I was backpacking from city to city (travelling by coach/bus mostly - quite cheap in UK) and sleeping in hostels, never camped or (really) slept rough during those two trips. But I would have had the things needed for that with me.  Do you really want to camp in the woods or something like that? If not, you don't need a tent or cooking equipment IMHO. A tarp and sleeping bag/pad will do. Even the pad is not really needed, cardboard will provide the same comfort level and is available for free almost everywhere (in towns/cities).  Keep in mind that every little piece you pack in your bag or strap on it you'll have to carry around all the time. So I'd suggest to start with little and if you feel the need to have something while on the road, you can buy it then.  Another point: you don't need to look like an oogle, but I prefer not to look like I just spend a small fortune at an outdoor/camping shop. Would only make people assume you are rich and maybe have some large amounts of money or other valuable stuff with you.  Good shoes/boots (already broken in) are essential though, I speak from experience (blisters). Also pack a lot of socks.  One change of clothing plus jacket/coat appropriate for your weather conditions should be enough. You don't need to change clothes or shower everyday while travelling.  Electronics: I took my smartphone (Galaxy S2) with me and an external battery. Served me well for internet, taking photos, listening to music and ... well ... doing some phone calls now and then.  I suggest you take a few small trips first (like 1-2 weeks), you'll experience what and what not you need on the road.  Just my two cents ..."

vagabond,32kk6b,The_Last_Shamuria,165,Tue Apr 14 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"My favorite Ray Bradbury quote goes, ""Sometimes you've got to jump off cliffs and build your wings on the way down.""  I have some similar issues to you and I do think you need to throw yourself into new conditions to trigger your mental ability to adapt. It's nearly impossible to think yourself into a better mental state. I only say this because I've experienced this adaptation myself.   Just plan well, have some sort of plan with mental progress in mind, and be honest with yourself, for better or worse.  My advice: before you do anything rash I'd try spending a month in relative solitude. Get some supplies and spend a month without the internet. Work out regularly. Eat healthy. Spend time in sunlight. Read books. Spend every day dedicated to yourself. If you can rent an apartment somewhere for a month in a new place, do that, or if you can go camping in a national forest while making regular trips for food & supplies that would be good too.   Reinvention through solitude is extremely underrated in current society. It's a trope we see all the time in mythology and storytelling, both old and new. Some high tier athletes even do it to reach the top of their sport (look up Michael Phelps' training regiment for the Olympics). Martial artists do it to develop their body and mind. As do philosophers, travelers, hell, it's even an anime character trope.  Anyway, just an idea to think about."
vagabond,32kk6b,Ezraah,204,Tue Apr 14 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"This is great advice. I couldn't have said it better myself, because I had somehow forgotten that I came to the same conclusion not long ago.   I think a lot of depression stems from society, directly. You spend all day playing games you can never replicate in real life, watching shows with characters who are unreal, seeing ""only happy"" people on facebook, browsing r/news and seeing 95% problems with the world. These things eat away at you, slowly. You don't notice it because this societal fabric is something we were born into - We breathe it like water, but it's not good for us. Taking a step back and ""unplugging"" is the easiest way to find out who you really are and what is really important to you.  You may find that travelling is what you want to do, some people do it their whole lives. But, you might find that the hardships of the road do not add much to your existence. If you can find somewhere solid, where you can be you, away from electronic entertainment (music is alright), and recharge. It's hard to believe how much influence the world around us has on our views and dreams.  I find that depression is sometimes the result of a cognitive dissonance related to this fact. We've built very interesting cages for ourselves, but cages nonetheless.  I'm also dealing with post-military depression and have been considering meds/psychiatry as the fix. But, the poster above me has reminded me of how I used to think when I figured that treating the problem, not the symptoms, was the best option.  I will be seriously considering some abrupt changes in the near future to break a cycle that I forgot I was in."

I've been out of the military almost as long as I was in, and didn't realize I was experiencing that sort of depression until very recently. I found a group of veterans I now do all sorts of physical activity with and it's been very rewarding for me. I feel the camaraderie and the ability to relate to one another through our common experiences. It's been one of the most important things to happen to me in my life.

vagabond,32kk6b,Anticode,8,Thu Apr 16 01:59:22 2015 UTC,"Although mine is not comparable to yours, all forms of experienced anxiety among all people are in principle the same. I found acknowledging these emotions and accepting them to ease much of the anxiety; it is as you say, that much of this is born out of cognitive dissonance resulting in tension from fighting reality. It was like a breath of freash air in accepting it. The second point that might help is finding meaning and purpose in our state. In the pre-modern period, these sorts of emotional and cognitive states were often associated with a person who saw the illusions that build up society and run peoples lives. Perhaps that relates to what you said about always seeing 'happy people' on media and social media. These states were always associated with the religious and spiritual ascetics, who were known for their long periods of meditation and fasting, travelling and writing, and of course, thinking and reforming. I found for myself, ""the world of the living"" was like a time of death and suffering, while the spiritual world of meditation and discipline, theosophy, was a liberation from it.

vagabond,32kk6b,unknown_poo,17,Wed Apr 15 13:53:19 2015 UTC,"There's this thing in Psychology called Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  Basically it's talking about motivation and what you need to be content.  At the bottom is your health, then your personal safety (are you in danger, do you have a place to live, do you know where your next meal is going to come from).  Once those base needs are taken care of you get into the higher stuff that's more about your mental health (do you feel loved, do you feel confident, do you feel like you know your place in the world and are you happy with that place).  As you get higher in the pyramid of needs you'll start to hear people say things like ""I don't know what's the matter with me, I have a great house and a good job and make enough money to get by but still I'm depressed all the time.""  This is because they're missing something in that higher order of needs.  It sounds petty because it's not important stuff like do you have enough to eat, but it's part of our needs nonetheless.  I think deep down this is why you see depressed people who suddenly toss everything and go wandering the world suddenly feel better.  What they did was drop down the pyramid, now their mind is more concerned about those baser needs which are easier to solve than high up mental issues about one's self.  They can actually solve things like where will my next meal come from, or am I out of the rain at night."

Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology, some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. Maslow used the terms ""physiological"", ""safety"", ""belongingness"" and ""love"", ""esteem"", ""self-actualization"", and ""self-transcendence"" to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through.

I went from seeing someone once every two weeks to maybe twice a year, my next one is in about 8 months, for basically a general how are you doing its usually only about a 15 minute appointment.

vagabond,32kk6b,danby,5,Tue Apr 14 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"If you are depressed (and I assume you are). You are straight up not in the emotional and mental position to assess whether or not you are a burden to others or not. If you haven't been explicitly told that you're a burden then you musn't assume this is so. As you're depressed and smart (judging by how articulate you are) you likely feel you have some kind of objective view here but you don't, you're current opinion of yourself is too deeply tied to what you think others feel about you.  As you're smart you probably do intuit that people around you display some degree of concern/angst around you. Perhaps it is this that you're reading as signs that you're a burden. Much more likely is they see that you're in pain and their empathy and impotence affect them deeply. But this is not a sign of being a burden, these feelings in others come from a place of love.  Now, it's not always the case that friends and family can help directly. Most people do not have infinite time and infinite emotional resources. More often than not a counsellor, doctor or psych ward is that place for structured help which will actually help. But the the people in your life who will definitely be there to support you.  A good friend of mine has been long term depressed for a long time now. He did most of what you're doing now. Dropped out of life, stopped working, got rid of the gf so he wouldn't be a burden, etc... Perhaps that temporarily helped him but his actions were certainly no less of a burden to friends and family than he previously felt he was being.  Perhaps going off on the road will be a good plan but I can't imagine you're in the correct mental state to make that call. If you haven't told all of this; your depression, your thoughts, your plans to at least two folk in your life you need to do that ASAP. Perhaps they'll change your mind perhaps they'll be onboard but a little sanity checked from a wellwisher is never a bad idea.  Good luck with whatever you decide"

When I was in Albuquerque, I had a mental breakdown and quit my job, and broke up with my girlfriend and found myself in a very deep depression. I wanted to move again, I had to escape. I had only lived in ABQ for 9 months and had to get out. The next two months I burned through my savings on rent and food and then found myself broke, with no job, and no place to live. This is were my advice to you comes in.    I had a friend from when I was in high school offer to move me up with him. He got me a job, gave me a room, and really changed my life. I can never thank him enough.    I recommend reaching out to a friend, or a relative, and finding a change in scenery. You don't need to make a drastic change like hitchhiking into the sunset. When you live with bipolar disorder, finding yourself in a town that is unfamiliar with no resources or knowledge can be terrifying, and could trigger your depression. Traveling is an amazing thing, and I'll never stop. I highly encourage you get out and see the world, its a beautiful place.    Best of luck to you in your travels."

This way they don't show up as dropped courses or fails on your transcript at all and can't affect you in the future should you decide to go back to school.

I'm not trying to dissuade you from taking meds or hitting the road, there are just some serious considerations to be had with the combination of the two. Some meds can make you more suicidal and running out is definitely bad news. Having an established relationship with a health care provider is crucial for psych issues.

Right now, what is happening right now... I was wrong... I took a nice little trip to the hospital and thankfully enough I was only there for 2 weeks. But in that two weeks I learned so much. 1. I'm not alone and 2. Other people have it worse than me. It put my life in perspective. Now I'm not saying go hide yourself up in a mental ward because honestly if you live in the US you will be absolutely SoL'd. The one thing that helped me the most was having time to myself. My mom still tells me that a healthy body equals a healthy mind. These thoughts they are natural and in no way wrong. And the problem with being bi polar or any depression is that you can't snap out of it. The nice thing is you can set you self up to ease out of it. Take time to yourself. Camping, being in the outdoors brings relief to some (it does for me) meditating and not for just to find yourself but to just be without thought but living. Find a hobby, it can be collecting sticks. Do some research on natural herbs and vitamins that promote stable emotions. I will straight up tell you it has been 14 years before I have felt so stable I could kiss anyone just for it. Life is hard. Don't tread alone. If you would like someone to talk to you can PM me and I would love to help out. I do not know where I would be if it were not for my best friend that helped me out in my time of need.   One last thing. NEVER be afraid to ask for help.  Tl;Dr I deal with bipolar myself and sometimes it's hard to even get out of bed or to think of being in a relationship.

And also knowing that it isn't a bad thing. In most cases it can be very fruitful. Don't give up on the fight I'm sure you'll prevail. I would recommend keeping in contact or getting help from your closest family member or friend. You might feel like your a burden but to someone who really cares, you're not."
vagabond,32kk6b,brainphat,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"Two things.   Keep school open as a possibility for the future. You can likely get courses that you have failed removed from your GPA calculation though an appeal process. If you go back seek out the schools disability resource center and utilize their services. I couldn't have gotten through school after being academically dismissed without someone else giving me this advice.   Second, you will be more of a burden to your friends and family by not accepting help from them that will get you back into your feet. The worry and stress of knowing you are out and about still struggling is much worse than the ""burden"" of giving you some food and a place to stay. You have a safety net, use it. Even if you make it through the fall unhurt you still have further to climb back up. Swallow your pride and accept help. In the end it's more about where you end up and not how you got there."
vagabond,32kk6b,obvom,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:26:34 2015 UTC,"Though never in the military, I've battled depression my whole life and known plenty that have. The great military guys on here that have dealt with this and are willing to help can probably steer you on a better path a-la coping. I just wanted to touch on the notion of ""being a burden"".  Two thoughts.   One is a burden is usually something one takes on oneself, not something you can bestow upon another. A burden is something you bear, not something you are. That may be semantics; you be the judge.  Second and more importantly: the people in your life that care about you will never consider you or helping you out a burden. Let people in (like you have here). I consciously haven't and don't and am the poorer man for it. Don't let your perceptions right now get in the way of becoming the person you want to be.  Good luck, man. We're all pulling for you."

Everyone be careful. Lying about food is a common game among hosts. It seems that MOST Hawaii work/shares are not what they are advertised and communicated to be. You'll be scrubbing sidewalks and washing cars for some rich cunt if you don't do your own diligent research. Always be prepared to get out quickly, if you need to.

A majority of them are incredible places owned by some really cool progressive farmers.  However, Hawaii is an entirely different animal. Hawaii is filled with trustafarian rich-kids and retired yuppies that have grown up all their life being ""served"" and having other people do the hard work for them. This is why most of them tend to treat their guests more like servants as opposed to ""farming interns"". But hey, that's simply the way it is when it comes to dealing with rich people, no matter where you are, and unfortunately Hawaii has a more concentrated population of rich people than other states.  TL;DR - WWOOF is a great program, but stay away from 50% of the farms on Hawaii, or you'll become some rich persons slave."

Jumping into a random box is not so recommended. ;) If a farm doesn't have a website, well....that is kinda weird. What serious organic farm is not using the internet? Is the farm selling anything produced at the farm? Can you find any information about the ''farm'' beyond the work share website posting and facebook and emails? That bitch in NC I posted about totally claimed, and posts online and emails about his ''organic'' farm. His farm is 80% roundup ready feed corn [dent corn] just loaded with pesticides. For food, he grows peppers and okra. Period. End of food plant list. ''I have so much food growing here I dont know waht do do with it haw haw haw.'' Just an example of what's out there, recollecting as accurately as possible. An 18 year old girl showed up to workshare one day. He had been crowing about getting this ''hot young bitch'' to his farm for days and days. I assumed she was older the way he was bragging about nis emails and whatnot, all excited to get up on this girl. She arrived like a deer in the headlights, totally unaware. Farmer Dicknose starts whispering creepy shit to me. [I enjoy letting folks expose themselves for who they are sometimes, and will put up with lots to witness life as it is. If that makes sense].

Maybe I've just had bad luck, but in Hawaii I know that over 50% of the farms I worked for was total bullshit. They mostly just wanted a slave to pull weeds for them, or someone to be their house-maid at a retreat/bed-and-breakfast. Oh, and what do you get in return? Maybe some rice, beans, and a few avocados.  Never heard about Portugal's work-trade farms, but I know the WWOOF farms in New Zealand are supposed to be pretty legit, and many even offer pay."

And as a result of such progressive visa workforce policies? New Zealand is now one of the top tourist destinations on earth, combined with having a low-risk, cheap workforce to support their biggest domestic market: agriculture. That's genius."

But I did, about 3 days away from the nearest store that had a spare. Heavy duty plastic bags. Keeps things dry and organized. For your passport, get a smaller one, computer cables come in good bags. Getting your shit wet can and will get your spirits down a lot.   Extremely useful (no reason not to)   Some rope, such as a storm cord for your tent. Again, weighs nothing, comes useful (eg replacement laces, tying something to a bus, drying clothes,...). A big book with small print. No form of travel doesn't involved being bored for hours. Doubles as kindling, and a ghetto pillow. Pictures of your family. Instant conversation starter, even when you don't share a language. A butt load of socks. You can not have to many socks.

I'm actually not done with the articles, as I still have a couple of more fishing articles to write."
vagabond,32cooc,_drybone,8,Sun Apr 12 17:58:25 2015 UTC,"Floating bait (powerbait) is meant for pond fishing, not for stream/river/creek fishing. Always remember that.  I wouldn't bother with any bobbers or sinkers, really.  No matter where you are in America, you can catch a fish with a spinner, such as a rooster-tail / fan tail. No swivels, no weights, just a simple spinner tied to the end of your line.  When you're fishing a single spot, whether its a river or lake, it's important to know how to find the fish. Alot of inexperienced anglers tend to keep casting out to one spot, usually as far as out as they can cast, over and over and over again, and then get impatient and gives up when nothing strikes. Then they assume that area is dead, and they walk several meters to another spot, and repeat the exact same thing, eventually just giving up altogether and calling it quits. This NOT how you should fish.  ALWAYS fish in a ""fan"" strategy, and make SURE you include the banks in this strategy.   Example: http://i.imgur.com/a91szj8.jpg (pretend black dot is you)  Cast out to each red dot, and slowly reel back in, occasionally giving it slight jerks to mimick something injured. Slowly reel for 3 seconds, give it a slight jerk, reel in another 3 seconds, give it another jerk, etc. Repeat. Hit that entire fanned area, every spot, for atleast 30 minutes before moving to a different spot. And like I said, do NOT forget trolling the banks. Tons of big bass, bluegill, crappie, and trout will sometimes be sitting just INCHES away from the bank, hiding in the grass/weed/cattails/etc.  For example last week, I was fanning too deep and not remembering to troll the banks. I started getting frustrated, decided to reel in and move to a different spot, and then STRIKE...a MONSTER bass, atleast 7-8 pounds, and I caught it only 2 feet away from the bank, directly to my side where I had completely forgot to fan.  As far as getting a license, I don't ever bother with it because   A) I'm usually too broke to buy an expensive daily permit, especially when I'm trying to catch a fish for food.  B) I move around too much, which would require me to buy dozens and dozens of permits for every area I go to  C) I fish responsibly and sustainfully. I catch my fish, I put it on a grill, and I eat it. I'm trying to catch as many fish as possible, nor am I doing it for sport/recreation.  Despite my reasons, it is still illegal. I always fish guerilla. I don't fish near the crowds or city ponds unless I'm desperate, and I stay very low-key. I catch my fish and I'm out of there like a ghost."
vagabond,32cooc,huckstah,3,Sun Apr 12 23:31:22 2015 UTC,"This is pretty vague, so the best thing to do is to ask people of their methods at each particular spot.  I learned everything I know just by talking to other fishermen."
vagabond,32cooc,Guitar-douche,2,Sun Apr 12 18:32:12 2015 UTC,I've asked a lot of fishermen in person and they never seem to wanna help out. Bad luck I guess.
vagabond,32cooc,thephartmacist,3,Sun Apr 12 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"Where are you and what do you intend to target? For all-around fishing in general, I recommend worms. A) You can find them easily. Look under rocks with moist soil around the river. B). They're cheap, if you have to buy  a tub. Get nightcrawlers if you do and chop them into pieces. More bang for your buck. C). Just about all species will eat a worm.  I can't speak for all states, but most require a license, if not multiple depending on the season, the species that you may catch, and if you're in a state of national forest). So, if you're staying in one state, look into the licenses available and ask if you need to. If you're traveling interstate, that could get expensive staying legal... You may have to stick to thickly wooded, off the beaten path areas where game warden's aren't often.  TIP: If you are fishing an area that has fish in season, for example trout, look up the trout stocking schedule if you can to see where has been recently stocked. Then, DON'T go there (if you aren't going to be licensed). The most recent stocking areas are where the game wardens will be more often.  Now, if you are sticking around somewhere for seasonal work, I would encourage making friends with anyone local that may have a pond on their property, explain your situation, and ask for permission to fish their pond. More often than not, they will be glad to allow you to fish their pond. Fisherman are kind of heart."

vagabond,32bt0t,huckstah,3,Mon Apr 13 12:55:25 2015 UTC,"The High Line, and Montana in particular, was a hobo haven for well over a hundred years.  I broke in on the Low Line (the next east-west rail line south of the High Line) and we never had one bit of trouble with bulls, cops, yard workers, train crews or anybody.  But, in the 1980s, the FTRA was formed, and it wasn't long before it kind of got out of hand.  Guys getting out of prison started flocking into FTRA and the crime rates in towns and cities skyrocketed.  ""Sidetrack"""" Silveria (who was an FTRA member) killed a string of unaffiliated tramps to rob them and steal their identification and Social Security benefits.  Sidetrack was eventually arrested, convicted and imprisoned.  Another FTRA guy (an acquaintance of mine) the late ""Dog Man Tony"" was arrested and charged with murder but was acquitted.  All the crime pissed off the citizens and the states passed a bunch of harsh anti-trainhopping laws, which heated up the High Line so bad that you couldn't ride from one town to another without going to jail for six months.  DO NOT COMMIT CRIMES ON THE RAILS.  All the thug behavior is going to make tramping impossible if people don't stop."

vagabond,326u3g,stupid_adage,2,Sat Apr 11 03:10:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it can be a bit crazy. It's a war among boats out there. You'll never see rivalry and cussing in your entire life until you get into Bristol Bay or Frederick Sound in Alaska. Skippers constantly at war with other skippers.  As far as dangerous waters, that's mostly for the crab season, and not the salmon season. Waters will get choppy every once in a while, but it's definitely not the Bering Sea.  If you have access to TV/Internet, checkout a tv show called Battle On the Bay. It's specifically about working on gill-netter boats in Alaska."

vagabond,326u3g,bobaa904,6,Sat Apr 11 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"Not trying to answer for OP, but I've worked the fisheries in California, Alaska, and Hawaii.   Commercial fishing has a rivalry and bullshit-vs-bullshit mentality more than any other industry I've ever, ever, seen in my life.   Fisherman in California hate the Alaskan & Washington scene, just like Hawaiian boats hate the Guam scene.   It's all a bunch of spiteful territorial bullshit in my opinion, and everyone that owns a big boat owns an even bigger ego. Seiners hate trollers, trollers hate seiners, gill-netters hate long-liners, and everyone hates the gill-netters. Hell, even gill-netters hate other gill-netters, just as much as they hate seiners and trollers as well. Everyone thinks they are ""top shit"", and that every other fisherman is somehow inferior, at the end of the day.  Truth of the matter when it comes to California vs Alaska fishermen is this:  California fucked up it's salmon scene years ago, and now the state is barely able to open any salmon runs. Recent progress has been slowly made, but for most part, it's a completely defunct fishery that is on the edge of being non-existent. Most of the states salmon boats are now parked for sale in the harbors of Alaska, if truth be told. Just check the wanted-ads or Craigslist...tons of boats for sale with California area codes.   On that same note, all those former deckhands and cannery workers in California are now having to migrate to Alaska every Summer like the rest of us, and that fact simply speaks for itself. It's been that way for the past 10-15 years, and until California creates a sustainable Salmon fishery, these workers will continue to leave for another decade, at the very least.  Alaska, on the other hand, is the complete opposite: Alaska has INCREDIBLE hatchery and rehabilitation programs, which is why 2015 is predicted to be one of the best Salmon runs in recent history, despite continually increasing in boats and canneries. Alaska not only sustains their wild salmon population, but also increases that population, decade after decade, including this year.  TL;DR - All fisherman talk shit about other fisherman. Yet, despite all the bullshit rivalry/argument, Alaska is the renowned King of fishing, year after year, and it will naturally always have it's haters because of it's enormous success as a sustainable fishery. Unfortunately, most of the world's fisheries are completely fucked, and fisherman in those areas are forced to travel far away and hope for better luck in places like Guam or Alaska."
vagabond,326u3g,_drybone,1 point,Sat Apr 11 04:52:01 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, yeah I think that's where he's coming from. I've been doing some research on Alaska and they really do have a lot of jobs up there. I even found some postings for entry level seasonal jobs in hatcheries.   That's good news on the salmon run this year. I just interviewed for a processing job up there and it sounded like I'll get hired, but I wont know until May 1st or so.   By my estimations I'm expecting to make at least 10k or up to a max of 20k which is all I really care about. If it works out I can see myself working in Alaska every season and living off that money for the rest of the year.   I'm gonna be driving up to Seattle from socal and hopefully find a cheap storage unit to stash the Exploder. Ideally I'd like to be working on a boat but I figure this will be some good experience to show captains and give me a chance to check out the state with little risk.

So let me get this straight, there is no federal service dog registry?   What should I say to police who question me? There's one particular place I have in mind where that could be a problem. Pearl Street in Boulder, CO is a no dog zone (but people bring their dogs all the time). I love Boulder and Pearl Street is really the only good place to busk. Busking is my only income. Am I likely to be arrested for calling my well trained dog a service dog when a cop comes to write me a ticket?  Lots of people outside our community will probably hate on a post like this and I'm sorry for that. Vagabonds really do have needs. Being homeless with a dog means you can't go inside a store to buy supplies, fill up your water or even go to the bathroom. These are necessary things for anybody. We don't like abusing laws meant for the disabled, but we have to survive somehow."
vagabond,326kmn,TheRavenAZ,3,Sat Apr 11 11:59:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, no federal registry. While legally, you would be well within your your right to be there. Not everyone, including police officers, knows the ADA law. Many times it will happen where someone will get upset and call the police, and the police not knowing better will ask you to leave.  Best thing to tell police is the ADA law that requires you to have your dog(who is a medical device, and NOT a pet) anywhere you go as long as it's a place the public is normally allowed to go. Tell them you have a disability and you are not comfortable divulging what it is, and that the dog helps mitigate the disability by preforming trained tasks(not tricks) when you need them.  This can sometimes be avoided by using a fake dog registry that looks official, carrying the ADA laws(on printed paper), or carrying a letter which is recommendation from a doctor to have a service dog for your disability. In my experience: the better looking harness you have, and the more well behaved do you have, the better time you'll have. People put a lot of value in looks when trying to spot a fake.  Usually in the situation of getting kicked out of a place, you'd escalate by getting the cop's information and taking it to the sheriffs office. You might be able to get help by finding local media coverage ""Local homeless man trying to make a living discriminated against because of disability""  and find some help from people that way :P"

These companies have always hired vagabonds, and for the foreseeable future, will always continue to hire seasonal/migrant workers.  As far as work, just google ""working in a cannery"" or search youtube. It's mostly slicing fish bellies, chopping off heads, cutting fins, sorting fish by species, putting them on ice, and then putting them on stacked trays to go into the massive freezers. Lots of guts and slime, and constant monotonous work.   Working in a cannery is mental and physical hell, to be honest with you. Only 1/3rd of the canner workers going to Alaska will last until the end of the season.  It's no joke. It's hard work, and hard on both your mind and body. It comes down to whether you are willing to work hard and make a shitload of quick money.

They put a posting on Craigslist for interviews in my city and I went and they said ""we will email you in a week"" well 2 days later I got an email back. If you have no qualms doing anything to make money you can get a job. I have a roommate who I went with to look for jobs and we went to the Mall and he was passing up every store that he didn't like and so I said ""Dude, what are you doing? You could apply at all those places."" And his response was, ""But I can't work there I don't like there stuff, you can't work for somewhere you don't respect.""  This guy is still jobless, and had the same opportunity to find a job that I did. Beggers can't be choosers, you want to make money you put forth the effort, you go to where the jobs are hiring.

vagabond,324dpq,Ezraah,4,Fri Apr 10 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"I spent 18 months on the road hitching and riding freight trains, continuously living  outdoors and on the bum.   I have gone back to hopping freights several times during my life.  I love it, and it's hard to quit doing.   In my early days (1970) I carried two old style, 1-gallon Clorox bottles, which were made of a different kind of plastic than now, and were very tough, almost unbreakable.  In more recent times, I have used 2-liter soda pop bottles (several, depending on where I was headed, i.e. into the boondocks where water is scarce or into a city/town) and now I carry two 1-gallon Ocean Spray cranberry juice bottles wrapped in duct tape and armored on the bottom with a circle of Masonite.  If you are really going off the grid, what you really need is a backpacker's water filter.  They're expensive, and the water sometimes tastes bad, but these filters filter out bacteria, protozoa, organic matter etc. down to a few microns.  Another option (and far less expensive) is to strain crappy water through several bandanas, then boil it.  Boiling kills 99% of bacteria, but it doesn't eliminate giardia SPORES.  (It does kill giardia bacteria, though.)  Remember that if you are in the mountains, water boils at less than 212 degrees.  Some bacteria will die at temps as low as 140 degrees, others, not.  I've never carried one, but a mountaineer's pressure cooker pot would be great to have. I am a low-dollar adventurer.  I cook in a gunboat, make coffee cups out of tin cans, sleep under a tarp, carry a military-surplus ALICE pack and so on.   One of the greatest compliments I ever got from a fellow traveler was that my field-expedient stove made from a spike can and a large railroad tie-plate was, ""pretty freakin' hobo, kid."""
vagabond,324dpq,SunsetRoute1970,2,Fri Apr 10 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"You will almost never need a 10-iter bag unless you are walking through the desert or boiling absolutely everything you cook.  Also, 10 liters of water will weigh about 22.5 pounds. If you want to carry everything you need to survive plus an extra 10+ kilos, be my guest.  A 3-liter bladder should sustain you for a couple days at least, and if you're really pressed for clean water, carry iodine tablets (which weigh and cost nearly nothing) or a lifestraw."
vagabond,324dpq,FarmerHandsome,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:57:54 2015 UTC,I was thinking more along the lines of spending a week camping out in a forest somewhere and having the available water. It wouldn't be any amount to regularly travel with.

Even if you're strictly platonic friends there are certain emotions and reactions that crop up. It's hard for men to turn off that 'switch' in their heads.   I think you're too caught up on trying to justify your beliefs and pegging him for being dishonest. I don't know the extent of your friendship, but he doesn't have any obligations to travel with or protect you. If you two did begin traveling together however, he might start to feel those obligations. There's a good chance he's trying to avoid that feeling. It's not a bad emotion to have in a traditional lifestyle but when you're desperately seeking freedom, its another bar in the prison cell.

vagabond,324hsi,jhaismine,4,Fri Apr 10 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"This is true.  Two of the ""longest-legged"" trainhoppers I know are women, but they are exceptionally experienced and they really have a very, very fine nose for trouble.  A woman or girl by herself is pretty vulnerable.  There are a lot of ex-convicts and guys with a sort of ""1%er biker"" attitude about life out riding trains.  It is not impossible for a woman to ride alone (Stray Cat Julie probably has 12 years or more and over a million miles on the rails, Portland Jenny probably has eight years or more) but they are exceptional women. It's not that you can't do it.  You can.  But at what risk?  Two women together, both armed and knowledgeable in how to fight would be pretty safe.  One woman, less so.  Brute force is not the hazard.  The hazard is making friends with somebody (or several somebodies)  who then betray your trust.  Tramps are not the only hazard.  You also run into citizens who think you should be grateful for whatever help or kickdown they give you, people who hate and despise any woman who looks ""homeless,"" people in official positions (railroad workers, cops, bulls) who may think you owe them something for them giving you a pass.  It's a hazardous world. Having a dog is a good idea for a woman, and especially a dog small and light enough that you can pick him or her up.  Don't pick a puppy from dogs that are bigger than you can easily carry.  (Obviously a big dog like a German Shepherd is great for protection, but can you lift her into a boxcar?)  Public transportation like buses or commuter trains will not let you board with a dog.  Go online and buy one of those harnesses for ""Service Dogs.""  Service dogs are not just for the blind anymore.  Your dog must be very well trained and very calm in crowds for this to work.  If you arrive at a train yard in one part of a city, how are you going to get to your departure yard on another railroad in ANOTHER part of the city if you cannot ride a city bus with your dog?  Wear dark sunglasses, put the ""service dog"" jacket on your dog,  nobody will give you any hassle."
vagabond,324hsi,SunsetRoute1970,3,Fri Apr 10 18:06:59 2015 UTC,"Thankfully I've got my own vehicle, but a lot of what you said makes sense for my situation too. Thanks!"
vagabond,324hsi,SunsetRoute1970,3,Fri Apr 10 18:14:55 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with rubber tramping.  If you want to travel by vehicle rather than hitching or riding freight trains, CHOOSE A VAN.  If you live in a van, you need to know the basics about mechanics and how to maintain it and keep it running.  Go to a reputable auto parts store and BUY THE REPAIR MANUAL for the model van that you own.  They usually cover a span of years.  You should have at least a small collection of tools, too.  (I buy a lot of tools at garage sales and flea markets.  Pawn shops, too.)  I lived in several vans over the years.  You don't necessarily want a van that looks like a camper van.  If your van is nondescript, you can park on the street and crawl into your sleeping bag back in the camper bed you built in the back and nobody's going to be  the wiser.  A mini-van is not a very good choice because it's not big enough inside.  A cargo van is much better, but they are more expensive to buy and less efficient on gasoline.  If you buy a cargo van, you want one that can accommodate a bed (you can build it yourself to fit the size RV mattress you have., it's not difficult.)  I got several really good mattresses from  the dumpster at a psychiatric hospital.  I just asked a maintenance guy if they had any old mattresses, and he led me around to the service dock where the dumpster was, and there was an old, ratty, plastic-covered seclusion room mattress (foam) sitting in the dumpster.  Perfect for my van bed.  I re-covered it with a military surplus mattress cover.  (Marines know this item as a ""fart sack."")   Your van will also need a ""head.""   One of the biggest problems of van living is the lack of a bathroom.  An actual toilet, like a chemical toilet is not too expensive, but I built a ""bucket head,"" in which I used a 5-gallon bucket (with a lid) for sewage.  I would empty it in gas station bathrooms and places like that.  Way out in the boondocks, sometimes I just put the lid on and carried it out in the woods, dug a hole and poured it in, then back-filled the hole.  If you put a plastic bag in the bucket, it makes disposal a lot easier and less nasty.  Just remove the bag, twist it shut and tie a knot in it, then discretely place it in a dumpster, maybe in an empty cardboard box.   Not to be too gross, but urine is much less a problem than feces.  If I was anywhere near civilization, I would stop at a Buck-ees or a truck stop or something.  But sometimes you get caught short.  Pull over, pull your privacy curtains, heed the call of Nature, put the lid back on the bucket and drive on.  I knew somebody once that had a ""trap door"" in the floor of his van.  He would park over a sewer grating, open the trap door and just pour his sewage into the storm sewer.  When I tried to explain that this was pretty nasty, what I got was the ""Not my problem"" response. The actual throne I built took the form of an open front box with a hole in the top and a toilet seat, with a 5-gallon plastic bucket beneath the toilet seat ""bowl.""  I was a VERY low budget van owner.  I built the bed to be just high enough to allow the storage of items inside milk crates underneath it.  My Volkswagen mini-bus had no potty.  It was a hassle.  My Chevrolet van and my Ford Econoline van both had a built in plywood & 2x4s bed and a bucket head.  The Econoline also had a homebuilt camping kitchen that was on the right side of the rear doors, and the outside of the right-hand rear door had an RV propane tank bracket bolted to it, with the 20-pound propane tank hooked up to my two-burner propane hot plate.  A friend gave me a full-length roof rack for my micro-bus (he had sold his VW van) and later I built a full-length roof rack for the Econoline.  It was sturdy enough to go up and walk around and sunbathe on.  I carried all manner of crap up there, used bicycles, dumpster-dived hooch materials, cardboard boxes of extra clothing, lawn furniture, etc.  When you build a bed, drill appropriate size holes and use CONSTRUCTION SCREWS, not nails, and glue everything together with liberal amounts of construction adhesive.  I went all out and painted mine and everything."
vagabond,324hsi,SexyButtDaddyDom,2,Sat Apr 11 08:06:36 2015 UTC,"Please don't recommend service dogs to people who aren't disabled. If you're going to fake having a service dog fine, but most people will take just the surface advice of buying a vest and leaving it at that making it much harder for the actually disabled.   I'm actually disabled and eligible for a dog and I also understand the need to have your dog with you at all times as a traveler. I'm not actually against that. But a person wanting that should be seeking to learn what it takes to truly have a service dog on their own so they can fake it well, and not cause enough ruckus to get service dog registry laws enacted to cause many people to loose the privilege. Putting a vest on a well trained dog can get you by some people, but you'll get caught eventually without knowing the laws and making sure the dog conforms to them.

There are some things at REI that are probably worth the money, but I've been humping a modified ALICE Large for probably ten years, and it cost me about $40.  Comfort?  No big deal.  Durability?  Well, I've been throwing it on and off freight trains forever and it has held up quite well.  I ditched the frame, though.  Too awkward boarding units.  I used a piece of sledgehammer handle I picked up on the tracks to fit in the frame pocket, with a couple of slots for the ALICE pack straps and extensors.  It's jury-rigged, so what?  Suits me.  And it was cheap."

Sure, if you're only going to be doing this lifestyle for 3-5 months in warmer states, you can get away with the thin patrol bag.   But if you're going to be camping out in the late-fall/winter/early-spring, or simply in areas or on nights when a sudden cold-snap can occur, you are going to FREEZE your ass off in the patrol bag. I wouldn't sleep in any temperatures less than 50-55 degrees in this bag unless you layer up.  I use the MMSS, and I only carry the cold-weather bag. However, I travel all-year round typically, and having a -10 bag has saved my ass alot.  Also, speaking of bag temperatures: If you are shopping for a bag and you see a degree rating, remember that the temperature rating is for survivability, NOT comfortability. Always subtract 20 degrees when looking for your comfort/warmth level on a sleeping bag.   If the bag says 30 degree, subtract 20 and get a 10 degree bag if you want to be warm at 30 degrees."

I do it when its not raining but I want the added warmth.  combined with the three piece sleeping system you can camp in any type of weather no matter how hot or how cold.  and its durable as hell

vagabond,322e91,huckstah,4,Wed Apr 15 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree slightly. I'll take durability over weight, anyday.   If you're doing this lifestyle for a few months or longer, commercial packs will eventually fail. After a few months of libing on the road and rails, the bag's straps/buckles/zipper/fabric will go to complete shit, and your bag will eventually fall apart.  Those bags are meant for short hiking trips, or a few months on the AT or PCT. They are not made for long-term vagabonds, especially hopping trains.  Also, if you are going to be trainhopping, don't even bother going to REI or Sports Authority or wherever. Those backpacks are not going to take that type of abuse for a long-term period.  I'm kind of bias in my opinion, because I do this long-term, and on top of that, also hop trains. A commercial backpack gets chewed up in just a few months with my lifestyle."
vagabond,322e91,ak1ndlyone,0,Wed Apr 15 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"I dont mind switching out broken bags because of the weight savings and comfort. I just hate having a heavy bag, it lowers my morale a lot when having to hoof it"
vagabond,322e91,huckstah,2,Fri Apr 10 02:47:20 2015 UTC,"Switching out broken bags when people are paying 200$+ for a commercial bag is not very economical for a low-budget hobo that is on the road long-term.   Plus, the ILBE Gen II is a 600$ backpack that can be bought for 100-200 dollars. It's also the most comfortable backpack you can get as far as padding on the back-support, lap-belt, and internal framing design.  I think the little bit of extra weight is worth the durability, price and extra padding. Also it's much cheaper, which is my primary concern."
vagabond,322e91,heartbleedtookmyacct,5,Fri Apr 10 06:03:15 2015 UTC,The argument to not get a hiking bag is that they don't last as long and get torn up easier. Especially when train-hopping. It just matters what you are doing.
vagabond,322e91,ak1ndlyone,2,Fri Apr 10 06:27:07 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Civilian backpacking bags will not last nearly as long.  I like the ilbe pack.  Its comfortable, semi water proof, and will last forever.  It's meant to carry over 125 lbs.  I had the same pack for 4 years in the marine corps.  Two deployments and countless months in the field training.  I've been out for two years and I still use it for all my backpacking and camping.  The durability definitely makes up for the weight.  Plus no other pack is as flexible with configurations and attachments.  Imo if you can't carry the weight your a big pussy and should probably look for another life style"
vagabond,322e91,SunsetRoute1970,1 point,Fri Apr 10 08:39:28 2015 UTC,I think it's about what you are doing. If you are staying near towns and aren't getting into the bush a lot then a civilian pack works.

Sometime's 7-10 miles on a bad day, but I carry an ILBE Gen II with 50+ pounds of gear and I do fairly good. I have to stop every 60 mins and take a 5-10 minute break, but half the reason I do that is to sit down and smoke a cigarette anyway. The weight of the military packs are not really that bad for me, but then again I'm not walking 15-20 miles everyday like you."

(if you're a dude) If you're rural keep a trash bag handy that your pack fits in and you can straight up bury your stuff in a shallow grave as you need to. Or even up in a leafy tree. Just make sure it can't be seen from the ground. Also, only for short durations (especially if you have food in there) or else your pack will be dug up by animals. You need to use extra caution because aside from getting stolen, there is the very real danger in this day and age of being reported to police for leaving a bag laying somewhere unattended.

vagabond,3203zs,turkfactor,1 point,Sat Apr 11 08:54:58 2015 UTC,"Whenever you can, I would keep it with you.  I was homeless in LA a few years back before I turned 18, and I always tied my backpack closed and to my wrist when I slept.  But that should be fairly obvious.  It's more difficult to figure out what to do if you want to leave your backpack somewhere (like if you're going to a job interview), which is probably why you're asking in the first place. People have already mentioned renting lockers somewhere, and if this is an option, I think it's best. Another thing to consider is behind dumpsters at fast food restaurants.  At a lot of standalone places, they have a walled-off dumpster area.  This is iffy, because some places have cameras and wouldn't like it.  Most places, though, don't seem to ever check behind the dumpsters, so that could work for short-term storage.  I had a friend who used to sleep in the dumpster area of the fast food place he worked at for a few months in the summer. Another important consideration is WHERE you decide to be.  Any downtown of a large city is going to be fairly risky, but if you go to the suburbs or to a smaller city you won't have as much as a problem. Hope that helps, and good luck."
vagabond,3203zs,SunsetRoute1970,3,Mon Apr 13 04:06:35 2015 UTC,"Uh, brother, the dumpsters at fast food restaurants attract impoverished, hungry homeless people like a magnet, and if they spot your gear, it will be gone in a flash.  NEVER leave your gear with anybody you are not absolutely sure without any question they would never rip you off.  I once had several checks stolen from the back of a check book in my stuff by one of the best friends I ever had.  At the time, I never suspected him, but as the years have passed, the probable awful truth finally dawned on me. (Look up Occam's Razor.)"
vagabond,3203zs,turkfactor,1 point,Tue Apr 14 08:12:58 2015 UTC,"I guess that comes back to where you are, exactly.  In some cities you are 100% right, and I wouldn't leave anything anywhere in that case (probably not even in a locker).  Other places I've been I'd think would be fairly safe.  I mean, we're talking about if you have no choice but to leave it somewhere, and don't have any other options.    In order, my choices would probably go like this: 1.  Keep my stuff with me at all times. 2.  Lock my stuff up at a place I own or rent. 3.  Leave with a friend I know I can trust. 4.  Leave somewhere where I don't think people will find it.  Where this is depends on the place; I had no problem leaving my stuff behind dumpsters throughout Idaho and Wyoming, but wouldn't think of doing it in California.  Of course, if it were money or a checkbook, I'd almost always just keep it on me."

vagabond,31zvyr,jomodojo,4,Thu Apr 9 13:39:03 2015 UTC,"This is a map of the states in which it's legal to hitchhike in. I think starting in California would be a good idea as it is one of the easier states to catch a ride in.   ALICE packs are solid and will hold everything you could need. Just make sure that it everything on it is double stitched and check the material it's made of. Nylon is going to be more abrasion resistant and able to take a hell of a beating, while polyester is pretty strong and more water resistant. Note that I said resistant and not proof. Something to keep in mind is that  ALICE packs will typically be used as they aren't standard issue anymore. MOLLE packs are an amazing alternative. Both are great packs, so really it comes down to preference.  Busking is not illegal from my understanding (given all the other things are government's cracking down on that may change in the future) and is incredibly common. However, I have read quite a few stories of people getting harassed. But these are few and far between. So I wouldn't sweat that. Carrying a guitar WILL be a hassle and one more thing you've got to keep up with. A lot of people generally use ukuleles or mini travel guitars. Mandolins are also a favorite.  I wouldn't really worry about being a foreigner wandering around. I met a girl recently who hitchhiked her way from Nova Scotia to Texas and she hadn't had any problems. Hell, cops may actually be more lenient with you as you can play the ""I'm not from here"" card. You're definitely going to run in to other travelers as we're kind of all over the place.  All in all, I think you'd be perfectly fine."
vagabond,31zvyr,_imabox_,4,Thu Apr 9 14:37:32 2015 UTC,"awesome thanks for the info! do you think it'd be a good idea to wait until i'm in the states to pick up the pack from a surplus store, is there a chance i wont be able to find one? or are they pretty common?"
vagabond,31zvyr,_imabox_,2,Thu Apr 9 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"I would definitely advise getting one before you leave if possible. If you get here and can't get one (for whatever unimaginable reason that may be), you're going to find yourself in a pretty unfortunate situation. I don't know that I would say they're ""common"", but you can find them in bigger cities pretty frequently. I know there's probably 3 in a 25 mile radius of where I'm at now. But that's going to vary city to city and state to state.  Edit: grammar"

vagabond,31zvyr,Ezraah,3,Sat Apr 11 00:48:12 2015 UTC,"If you go for an ALICE you can modify it to use MOLLE waistband and shoulder straps, which are 10x more comfortable than the antiquated old system. You can also modify it to hold a sleeping system beneath the pack. Basically all these modules attach to an external frame that sits against your back. I would not recommend an ALICE pack with the old straps and waist belt.   Google alice hellcat mod for more info. It's really easy and cheap to assemble. I believe the total capacity ends up around 65L, and you increase that by attaching some extra pouches to the side of the pack if you wish. You can easily turn it into a 80L+ bag. More than enough space for anything you need."

So long as you pack right and keep the weight well balanced that's all that really matters. The great thing about the ALICE pack is that the main compartment is relatively small, around 35L, so it's easy to keep that weight near your mid-back. The rest of the space is just pockets and the sleeping stuff.  Then again if you're not going to be throwing your shit around you could always get something more modern and comfortable."

vagabond,3219ce,Moggyman,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"I camped up in Nederland because Boulder wasn't very friendly, and I hated Nederland even more. Sure, it's a pretty town in the mountains, but it isn't vagabond friendly.  Mostly trustafarian hippie kids, rich people, and tourists. The place was pretty stuck-up, overall.  Where the bus stops, you have to walk a few miles uphill to the nearest campsite, which is kind of a pain in the ass.   Last fall, there was a bunch of older bums causing a ton of violence and drug abuse at the campsites, which ruined it for all travelers.   So anyway, first thing I did in Nederland after getting off the bus was to hit up the local bar, check out the vibe/scene of the locals, and chit-chat with the bartender about places to camp. Sitting next to me was an old dude on a laptop that was a rubbertramp living in the national forest. Him and the bartender told me the whole story of the war against the bums, and the rubbertramper said he had to move his campsite to a really secret area because he had a ton of shit stolen from his campsite.  So after hearing all that, I finish my beer and decided to hop on the next bus back to Boulder. As the bus came through, one of the bums was getting off, as he had been panhandling in Boulder all day, and coming back to Nederland to camp. I talk to the dude for like 5 minutes, and then he wants to know if I want to buy any crystal meth, then he bummed a beer from my six-pack, and then he started offering to show me the campsites and all this shit. I was like no fuckin way dude, I'm going back to Boulder, fuck this scene.  I ended up finding a chill camp spot in Littleton, next to the Platte river. I stayed there for over a week without no disturbances. There was one more hobo staying down there, and he was a pretty cool dude that was a dishwasher for the local restaurant.  TL;DR - Fuck Nederland."

Keep in mind you will likely be competing with tons of Chinese and Indian competitors that are trying to do the same thing.  I would recommend learning Mobile Application development. You can go business to business, asking them if they would like a cheap app made for their business."
vagabond,31x7ls,huckstah,18,Thu Apr 9 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"I made my living as an arc welder for 14 years.  It's a great skill to know, and can be a good business if you are producing something for sale for a profit (you take $200 worth of material and turn it into a $1,200 barbecue pit, etc.)  But working for wages as a welder is not very profitable. When I was on the road I worked at a variety of jobs.  Most employers are looking for a semi-permanent employee, not a temp.  I did a lot of labor jobs, pick-and-shovel, construction, site clean-up, truck driving, building demolition and recovery of materials, wheat harvest (bobtail truck driving), green pea harvest (bobtail truck driving), welding, catskinner (crawler tractor) and so on.  When I was younger, I usually got jobs dishwashing, because it normally includes a meal with every shift you work.  My girlfriend worked as a waitress, because she was young and attractive and made awesome tips, and sometimes she worked as a bookkeeper.  A lot of young people on the road today delight in looking as bizarre as possible.  Visible tattoos, all kinds of piercings, bizarre hair colors, etc. are all fine if you don't mind being despised by regular society, and many of the kids on the road don't mind that.  They seem to WANT society to hate them, then bitch and complain when society reacts to them exactly the way they seem to want them to react.  If you want to WORK, you must be willing to meet your employer's expectations about appearance, attitude, dress, personal hygiene and so on.  If you're happy digging ditches (I probably dug ten miles of piping ditches for a plumber and hated every second of it) then fine, dress however you please.  But if you want to work in a job where you go into people's homes (painter, sheetrock, carpenter, handyman) or in a restaurant (waiter, waitress, cook, hostess) you must meet a certain appearance standard to get hired.  Dee and I had a fairly normal appearance, especially her.  She could put up her hair, a little make-up and a dress and get work anywhere.  I had a beard and longer hair, so it was more difficult for me, and I usually wound up in industrial jobs that did not pay very well. You are always better off running your own business than depending on anybody else for an income.  Create something (LEGAL) that other people want.  I've known tramps that made all kinds of stuff, rings, necklaces, earrings, tie-dye shirts, sold used musical instruments, handmade knives, sold pocket knives on the sidewalk from a knife roll (if you have to leave in a hurry, you just roll it up and split) and so on.  Owning your own business as a tramp usually means living in a van or some kind of vehicle."

Another good backup skill is housekeeping, though like that other poster said,  you'll want to look decently 'normal'  to get a job like that. It's probably something that is hard to get into on a more person to person level,  but if you can connect with someone and get them to trust you it can pay off. That guy I worktraded for in Hawaii had me there officially as a housekeeper. He was an exotic photographer and I spent two months living in and cleaning his bachelor pad that had a pool and a yoga studio and a jacuzzi and all that kind of stuff. After a while he started referring me to his friends,  and I was making $10 an hour just cleaning really nice homes at my own pace. Even got paid in mushroom chocolates once,  which was pretty cool.

As an added bonus, GSM phones are usually cheaper than most CDMA phones, simply because the world produces more of them for more countries.   Most GSM phones today come unlocked by default now, as opposed to older GSM models from 4-5 years ago, which required having them unlocked from the cellular provider and/or manufacturer. Make sure in the specifications just in case, as not all phones are unlocked.  If your phone is LOCKED, don't worry. Most phones can be unlocked, it just takes a little bit of googling and youtubing.

vagabond,31w38l,_forgotmynameagain_,3,Thu Apr 9 10:20:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of the knowledge I have about ""living out"" is stuff I learned while in the Marine Corps.  A good example is the survivalist ""Rule of Threes.""  (Three seconds of panic can kill you.  Three minutes of no oxygen can kill you.  Three hours of exposure to weather extremes can kill you. Three days without water can kill you.  Three  weeks without food can kill you.  Etc.)  It is hard to switch from the mindset of a ""house dweller"" to the mindset of a ""non-house-dweller,"" but one of the first things to go is the idea that you need to change clothes every day and bathe every day.  Spit baths are good (just washing with a wet washcloth the most important parts), and I have taken a bath in a five gallon bucket many a time.  Swimming in a creek or river?  All good.  If you get a chance to take a mission shower, WEAR YOUR SHOWER SHOES.  Flip-flop shower shoes are an essential part of your gear, especially if you hit a mission or a YMCA or somewhere like that to get a shower.  Athlete's foot fungus lives in wet shower/ bathroom floors.  ALWAYS WEAR SHOWER SHOES IN THE HEAD.  There's nothing more miserable than being twenty miles out in the middle of nowhere and coming down with athlete's foot.  The same fungus that causes athlete's foot also causes jock itch and ringworm.  First you get it on your feet, then it spreads from you touching your feet with your underwear when you put them on.  Then you scratch your jock itch, then scratch somewhere else--""bingo,"" now you have ringworm. Missions are notorious for three things: lice, athlete's foot and thieves.  A mission bed just ain't worth the hazards and the risk, at least not to me.  To avoid cavities and dental work, you should try to brush your teeth and floss as often as possible.  Wealthy people can afford to be careless about their teeth, but poor people brush three times and floss every day, or they wind up losing what teeth they do have.  It is not ""cool"" to neglect your health, and only a ""trustifarian"" poseur would think so.    Change your socks often, every couple of hours on a long hump.  Tie the sweaty socks on the back of your pack with string, so they can dry and get some sun.  Wash them in a stream or under a faucet if you can find one.  If you find a place to swim, go in with all your clothes on, armed with a bar of Fels-Naptha and a scrub brush and ""wash"" your clothes while they are still on your body, right there in the stream.  Then get out, hang up your nice, clean clothes on a few bushes, and go back in swimming, wearing your dirtiest pair of boxer shorts.  It's always a good idea to pick a sunny, breezy day for ""Wash Day.""  Wear your cleanest clothes next to your skin.  There's a lot of ways to wash clothing.  A five-gallon bucket full of hot water and a few flakes of Fels Naptha, agitated for twenty minutes with a ""dog stick,""  will do a pretty good job of washing stuff.  RINSE THE SOAP OUT THOROUGHLY.  Always, always carry multiple ways to do everything.  There's nothing wrong with a Bic lighter, but its not worth much if it's out of fluid.  A magnesium fire starter never runs out of fuel, and neither does flint and steel."

vagabond,31svro,mackraslo,5,Wed Apr 8 05:20:38 2015 UTC,Don Blanding. He has a book of drifting/vagabond poetry in a book called Vagabond House. The book was given to me by someone that owned a wifi cafe.

vagabond,31tfql,calrebsofgix,11,Wed Apr 8 04:49:59 2015 UTC,Canned beans and peanut butter are good for cheap protein. Energy bars are great if you can afford them.
vagabond,31tfql,MrMMMM,6,Wed Apr 8 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"Gotta be the perfect balance of durable(like wont be crushed in my pack. ie cans), nourishing(actual protein and carbs), and cheap. I've never been a picky eater so I can be very practical when I need to be.   IMO canned beans is the best road food bc they have very little fat and salt, while offering a ton of protein, carbs and vitamins. Also, canned beans are super cheap."
vagabond,31tfql,SouthTampon,4,Wed Apr 8 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"What /u/MrMMMM said, throw peanut butter on an apple and you're good."
vagabond,31tfql,fluffsnstuffs,3,Wed Apr 8 02:26:45 2015 UTC,"What I found most annoying while backpacking: there are almost no things in small quantities (for a reasonable price).  For example: I liked to toast some bread in the morning or evening to make a cheese/ham sandwich or something like that. So I bought bread (like 20 slices), cheese (like 10 slices) and ham (good enough for 5 or more sandwiches).  Next day or two I was on my way to another town. Backpack quite full with all my stuff. Where to pack the bread, cheese, ham? Some things should be stored refrigerated (esp. when opened).  Would be nice if there were also packs of 4 slices of bread or alike.  Some kitchens serve things like olive oil, salt or other cooking basics, others don't.  So I left quite a lot of stuff (including bottles of oil, packages of flour, packages of salt, rice, left over meat, etc.) in the self-serving kitchens for everyone's use just because I didn't find a reasonable/comfortable way to take them with me.  It's nice you can save money buy buying large packages of everything or ""get 2 for a discount"" but with the limited space of a backpack it's quite difficult ...  Where do you normally store your groceries?"
vagabond,31tfql,_forgotmynameagain_,6,Wed Apr 8 07:32:50 2015 UTC,"This is where substitution comes in.  Bread? Buy a small bag of rolls. Or soft pitas and put them in a big old ziploc bag you've had for the last 50 pita runs. Forget wonder bread.  Ziploc bags are your friend. If you make some other real friends, you can buy something and split it.  The dollar stores also often have foods in odd or smaller portion sizes."
vagabond,31tfql,anywhereness,2,Wed Apr 8 16:02:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. Will definitely go for ziploc bags.
vagabond,31tfql,_forgotmynameagain_,7,Thu Apr 9 08:19:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not on the road atm, but I currently live on $90 per month for food.   First of all I buy a 10lb bag of rice. I eat on that every day and it lasts the month. It gets old fast so I mix it with different things like canned veggies and meat for variety. Once in a while I cook a little rice with some milk and sugar to make a shitty rice pudding in my rice cooker. Of course I invested in a big ass bottle of soy sauce and some salt.   Rice is my main staple, but of course I need to supplement that with protein and fat. For those I turn to beans. Sometimes I get canned beans, but raw beans are so much cheaper. The downsides are that it uses lots of water to rinse them well and they take 2.5 hours to soak and cook.   Beyond that.. oats, canned fish, cheese(I have an addiction), and of course peanut butter. Lots of peanut butter. Just the biggest container they have.  It goes on bread, tortillas, in the oats, or I'll just eat it straight as a snack.  I try to get as many condiments as I can at fast food places while spending as little cash as possible. Like at Jack I'll buy their 2 soy tacos for a dollar (and save the receipt because it's a coupon for 2 free tacos) then get as much ranch and frank's red hot sauce as they'll give me. Hot sauce can make anything interesting and the ranch I use for sandwiches.  In a pinch, food banks are a good source of emergency food. They're everywhere, even my little town has one once a month."
vagabond,31tfql,_drybone,2,Wed Apr 8 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"As a rubbertramp, I get to mix in fresh groceries a lot, as they're easy to get. I also have a small cookpot and a super cat alcohol stove.  Staples almost always in the food bag:   Oatmeal Tortillas or Pitas Ramen or Couscous (mix in veggies and stuff) Canned ""firm"" veggies Whey protein powder Dried fruits / nuts Tuna packets A bag full of spices, all in individual little ziploc baggies Random assortment of condiment packets Multivitamins The most important vitamin of them all: Coffee   Staples for use within a day or so after purchasing:   Spinach Hard cheeses / Bread (often on sale) Frozen ""soft"" veggies (broccoli, ready potatoes) that also double as edible ice pack Fresh fruits or veggies (check what's on sale) Bananas are always on sale Hard boiled eggs (some places have 2-packs) Beer (it's a dietary supplement. no really!)"
vagabond,31tfql,anywhereness,2,Wed Apr 8 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"You don't really go shopping like you're thinking unless you're going to be in the woods for a while, or riding a particularly long train. I carry just a couple instant miso soup packets and a small instant mashed potato packet just for emergencies or in the rare moment I'm hungry and have no access to anything. The only other thing I keep is salt, pepper, and mayo packets.  So how do you eat? Ask for people's leftovers, dumpster dive, pick through trash cans (you'd be surprised what gets thrown away in cans), hit up stores/restaurants for free food, etc.   A few snacks are ok on your back but cans of food are heavy and bulky. Go light, be resourceful-- waste is everywhere and it's free and delicious."

vagabond,31tfql,SunsetRoute1970,2,Wed Apr 8 07:15:03 2015 UTC,"Once you open a can or package of something that must be refrigerated, you either eat it all or eat as much of it as you can and then offer the remainder to others.  When we are riding, we usually only eat one meal a day anyway, and that tends to be something like ramen noodles fortified with a can of tuna or something else like that.  Canned food is HEAVY, because it contains water, but the good news is you can eat Spaghettios, etc., cold, straight from the can, and it ain't half bad, especially if you are hungry. Think about the poor people in Third World nations.  They eat dried food that doesn't need to be refrigerated--frijoles, dried beans of all kinds, corn meal, flour, rice, dried fruits, jerked (dried) meats, peanut butter, whole nuts, hard cheeses, hard salami or other dried meats.  Some fresh vegetables like squash, fresh corn and edible gourds keep for a long time.  Tortillas, both corn and flour.  Bread baked in a gunboat.  Fresh meat--just cook and completely consume it within a few hours of it leaving refrigeration.  Poor folks in Third World nations don't eat nearly as much protein  as Americans and western Europeans, and they very rarely have any refrigeration at all."

vagabond,31u2cy,burningdemtrees,4,Wed Apr 8 03:52:21 2015 UTC,"If this your first rodeo out of high school, I recommend experimenting with it and see if you like, first. Ya know, do it for a few weeks, couple of months, see if it's the right direction for you and something that makes you happy as an individual.  If you are in NOLA, go down to Jackson Square or down by the Esplanade and waterfront near the quarters...lots of hobos, travelers, gutterpunks, vagabonds, scumfucks, you-name-it types of travelers down there right now. Also checkout the trainyards in New Orleans...avondale, etc...lots of hobo's hopping north right now and hanging out in the local vicinities.   You should have no problem finding partners in NOLA...just gotta filter out all the scumfucks and crustbums"
vagabond,31u2cy,huckstah,2,Wed Apr 8 07:37:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the headsup man. Yea, there are loads of traveling street kids here, especially right now in the springtime. I could always meetup with someone in NOLA but it'd be a little strange, in my opinion anyway, just to go up to someone and ask them if I can travel across the country with them. i just don't know how someone would react to that. I'd rather meet up with someone on here that way I could get to know them at least somewhat and they wouldn't feel like total strangers, if that makes sense."
vagabond,31st92,hella-jeff,8,Tue Apr 7 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"What will motivate you to survive every day on the road? If you're not even motivated to pass school or hitchhike by yourself, how will you get anywhere?  Not everyone can become a vagrant and be as successful as huckstah at it. You're going about this in a dangerous way that will lead you down a path far worse than suffering in school.  You can run away from your location but you can't run away from the problems in your own head."
vagabond,31st92,Ezraah,5,Wed Apr 8 06:34:34 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you whether you shoud hit the road or stay in school, as that is something entirely up to you.  However, as a tip, I wouldn't limit yourself to seeking travelers in Indiana. There are TONS of travelers in Chicago, although you have to filter out the scumfucks.  Look for travelers that are ANYWHERE, and just hitchhike to them, even if they are two or three states away from you. Afterall, if you're going to hit the road, there's no better than way than going out there and sticking out your thumb. You'll be doing alot of solo hitchhiking eventually, as it's VERY difficult to get a ride for a group of 3-4 people. Anything more than 2 people standing on the curb, and you'll be standing there FOREVER waiting for a ride to come.  I'm assuming you have gear, atleast a sleeping bag, tarp, and backpack?  Also, what about your medications? Are you going to drop all of that, or do you have a plan to have meds mailed to you on the road, or?"
vagabond,31st92,huckstah,2,Tue Apr 7 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"This is really an ad for anyone, just thought id put where im based at.

There's a record of who picked up who, where, etc. Could there be some way of checking kosher numberplates, and the information about type of vehicle etc can be verified by the hitcher? So if they're meant to be getting a lift from, eg, a silver Ford, and a black Kia rolls up with that plate, they know something's amiss? Of course the 'official' side of the plate check may carry a charge."

vagabond,31quaa,lithedreamer,2,Thu Apr 9 17:35:49 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on how secure the system needs to be from the start (I'm inclined to go with 'very bloody tightly-locked-down secure' because it's both my job and nature to have plans B, C, and D prepared), what sort of 'scores' are acceptable (there will always be people who can't even be arsed to swipe. Do we assume that one missing 'yep, all fine here, not murdered' count is OK? Two? What about the unlikely but possible scenario of a killer forcing their victim to click or swipe?)  So basically, what level of risk is acceptable? In a system designed to minimise risk to risk-takers, who decides where to draw the line?"
vagabond,31quaa,Ivyleaf3,2,Thu Apr 9 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"I have to say, the system doesn't have to be perfect; just good enough to stop most murders. Just like Uber, traditional taxis and every other service is going to have crazy people, we can't stop them all. Instead, it's worthwhile to brainstorm a bunch of ideas; criticize them, and finally settle on one.  That said, I'm not actually writing the program, so it's merely food for thought for me."

vagabond,31l55b,huckstah,9,Mon Apr 6 02:47:00 2015 UTC,This looks approximately like the American Discovery Trail.  http://www.discoverytrail.org/
vagabond,31l55b,ATstripe,7,Mon Apr 6 06:27:18 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hitchhike it, but the fact that its considered the ""loneliest"" is a big turn-off as a hitchhiker, as it sounds like waiting several hours or even days sometimes for a ride. Plus it's going through some pretty hard states to hitchhike in, right through the central gut of America. Beautiful places, but definitely not the easiest places to hitchhike.   This definitely sounds more like something for rubbertramps to try, not hitchhikers."
vagabond,31l55b,Frightened_Peasant,3,Mon Apr 6 02:57:53 2015 UTC,For someone who is just starting out though it means less police and less public exposure when you find a quiet place to set up your tent at night.  It seems like it might be a nice training ground for new hitch hikers who aren't in a hurry.  I'm seriously considering heading on to the road when my lease expires.  I might just save this submission.

However, it's usually never fun to be stranded in the middle of nowhere for 2 days trying to get a ride, and then when a ride finally comes, it only takes you to the next small town 30 miles away, and then you are stuck there for 2 days also. I could see that happening quite a bit on this route. I'd recommend taking alot of water and food, and definitely a book or some music."

All high desert, no water, no shade. The part over the Rockys goes over the US's highest pass. Once you hit the front range in Colorado though, it's corn to the horizon for hundreds of flat miles. Between california and Kansas on 50 there seems to be 6-7 towns. I just pulled off the side of the road on my motorcycle and slept 50 feet off the shoulder some places without another car disturbing my sleep for hours. It was badass but hitching? Wow. My tank would get about 125 miles before needing a fill up and I remember turning it to reserve a couple times. Nostalgia."

vagabond,31joft,GlicketySplit,9,Sun Apr 5 19:13:01 2015 UTC,"Hell yes having a pet limits my job opportunies. My stable job opportunities anyway. Your average guy needing help moving on craigslist probably won't care. I usually busk (street perform) for money and I think having a cute pet helps attract attention to my performance.   I feed my dog dried dog food that I lug around in my backpack everywhere. I get the smallest bags and they aren't too big to carry. I don't let random people feed her pizza or whatever. I'm pretty strict on her training and want her to know not to beg. Plus it's healthier for her not to eat random junk.   The biggest advantage is probably having a guard dog to wake me up when danger is around or just discourage muggers or whatever. Also, companionship is nice. The biggest disadvantages are that I have to lie about having a service dog to get in ANYWHERE. I can't go shopping in peace and I can't go to movies or concerts or anything unless someone is watching her or she's tied up at camp, which rarely happens."

vagabond,31joft,huckstah,5,Mon Apr 6 03:17:30 2015 UTC,"Owning pets, dogs for example, comes with several different cons and pros, depending on what type of traveler you are, the size of your dog, the discipline of your dog, etc.  The biggest pro is that you have a companion, protector, and friend. Also people will usually feel more sympathy for travelers with dogs, so you'll get lots of free food and money if you happen to be busking or panhandling.  The biggest cons is that you cant take them into public buildings/stores/whatever, and you have to leave your dog tied up outside. This is a great way to get your dog stolen in a major city. Also, it's much harder to hop a freight train if you happen to have a dog.   There is a debate between whether hitchhiking with a dog is a pro or con. It can go either way. Most people don't want pets in their cars, but for people that do allow pets in their cars, they will pull-over immediately upon seeing your dogs cute face. I personally think its harder to hitchhike with a dog, but whatever, that's just my two cents.  TIP: lots of travelers get their dogs certified as service dogs. Some travelers do this legally, but its a real pain in the ass. However, alot travelers also do this illegally, such as buying a used/fake service card on ebay. Store employees and security guards don't really know how to check if service cards are real or not, and so it works 99% of the time."

vagabond,31jn16,heinsickle31,3,Sun Apr 5 20:42:32 2015 UTC,I've met over a dozen hitchhikers and trainhoppers that have banjos. Just make sure you get a durable hard-shell case.
vagabond,31jn16,johnmal85,5,Sun Apr 5 21:13:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not a vagabond, but I take a didgeridoo camping - it doubles as a walking stick & the ones I use are PVC & ABS -- which are immune to basically any sort of wear & tear, weather, or even damage from using it as a tool instead of instrument, and they're super-inexpensive. You don't need a case - just a strap for when you need both hands or get tired of carrying it."
vagabond,31jn16,heinsickle31,4,Mon Apr 6 23:49:21 2015 UTC,"There is a type of guitar called a backbacking guitar.  It doesn't have the traditional guitar shape.  The sound body is kind of a tall triangle, and but scale is the same as a normal guitar.  My understanding is that they are a little less loud than a standard guitar.  Whatever instrument you choose, buy a STURDY, HARD CASE. Some of my friends play violin, mandolin (same scale as a violin,) ukulele, banjo, banjolele, banjolin, drums (also 5-gallon plastic buckets), cigar box guitar, cookie tin banjo, flute, recorder, harmonica, etc.  People choose instruments with a shorter neck and overall size (banjolele, banjolin, violin) because they are easier to carry around.  Traditional bluegrass banjos are heavy, because they have a heavy brass ""tone ring"" underneath the vellum (skin).  Cheap banjos have an aluminum pot, no tone ring and are a great deal lighter.  Banjo purists look down upon cheap banjos, but for hopping trains and busking on the street, they're fine.  I bought one for $45 at a pawn shop, but they usually sell for somewhere around $100-125.  Good banjos are much more expensive, $350-600.  (Don't take a $600 banjo trainhopping . . .)"
vagabond,31jn16,redemma1968,7,Thu Apr 9 00:21:07 2015 UTC,"A guitar is definitely not too large or fragile to carry around, especially with a hard case.

In Las Vegas, everything comes down to tourism/$$$, and allowing the bums to hangout underground is better for the tourism scene going on up above."
vagabond,31ia82,huckstah,2,Sun Apr 5 20:51:29 2015 UTC,I have been seeing articles about these guys for a while. I am sure they just sweep back in.   I just wonder if they will have time to get out if there is a heavy rain.
vagabond,31ia82,Moarbrains,4,Sun Apr 5 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"I can assure you, they are still there. I was just in the tunnels 8 months ago, and I walked through about 10 miles worth of the tunnels. (I do NOT recommend this)  There a few different entrances, and a few different tunnel systems, so it can be quite confusing.  In one tunnel, you could definitely tell that recent floods had caught alot of the people by surprise....clothes, blankets, pillows, etc, all washed up near the tunnel exits, buried in several inches of mud. On the otherhand, some of the tunnel camps were really prepared, and they built their shelters on elevated stilts.  I'll personally never go back to the tunnels. It's full of heroin addicts, meth tweakers, felons, thieves, low-lives, and creeps. They are definitely not what you would consider a ""vagabond"" or ""hobo"" community.  Last time I was in the tunnel, I heard a girl crying, and two men yelling at her. Suddenly the two men came charging down the dark tunnel with a flashlight, chasing me for several hundred yards. I'm pretty sure they would have killed me if they could have caught me.  In another tunnel, a homebum got really, really pissed off when I spotted his camp, and he started to chase after me also.    Here's my personal advice for anyone wanting to checkout the tunnels:  Each tunnel branch is owned by a certain gang of bums or drug addicts. It can be a community of just 3-4 people in one tunnel branch, and a community of like 20-30 people in another tunnel.  They all know each others tunnels, and they also know to stay away from certain tunnels, and which certain tunnels to protect from other tunnelers. It's a weird labyrinth of different tunnels systems, and they are all split off into different gangs and compounds, which makes it even twice as confusing. All the tunnelers know whats up though, and they have it down to a science, so to speak.  If you happen to walk into one of those tunnel compounds and they recognize you don't belong in that certain tunnel, they will chase you out, and possibly beat the shit out of you or even kill you, depending which tunnel community you stumbled into. Some tunnels might be nicer than others, but I use the word ""nice"" very, very lightly. Expect to be rudely kicked out, at best.  Also, once you get 50 meters into a tunnel, your cell phone or gps device is NOT going to work. Now imagine walking 500 meters into a dark tunnel, only to discover a rude encampment of meth/heroin addicts that want to steal your shit. Don't even bother calling for 911, because there is NO SIGNAL in a tunnel.   I don't suggest going in there unless you meet a tunneler with alot of credit with other tunnelers that can safely invite you in. Otherwise, you'll probably be robbed, beaten, stabbed, whatever.  Best suggestion is to find out where the tunnel entrances are. There are quite a few entrances, and they are pretty easy to access. However, they are hard to find unless you know a local home-bum that can show you where to find them.  If, and when, you do find a tunnel entrance, just sit back 100 meters from the tunnel entrance and watch the tunnelers come in and out. 6pm-8pm is the best time, because that's when most of them are headed out or coming back from panhandling and scoring drugs on Las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont district.   If you want a ""tour"", approach whatever tunneler you see with extreme caution, extreme respect, and a damn good excuse as to why you want to enter the tunnel. Otherwise, they'll either tell you to fuck off, or perhaps even rob/beat the shit out of you.  TL:DR: Do NOT go into those tunnels if you don't know what's up. I'm fucking serious, do NOT go into those tunnels. I'm not saying this to keep them secret, I'm saying this because I will personally never go into them again myself, and I am a seasoned hobo that is well-armed. Do NOT go into those fucking tunnels, unless you have been invited into them by a group that you feel really comfortable with. It is NOT safe for weekend warriors, urban explorers, amateur journalists, photographers, etc..."

Most of the people down there will yell and curse at you demanding money for being near the tunnels.

If your really up for a tour do Newfoundland also.  First train I ever hopped was out of Saint John. I had no idea where I was going to end up. The line took me to gort yard in Moncton. From there you can go east to Halifax, or head west towards MTL and beyond.  But ya to keep things short, hitching the east coast is great. Dont bring too much shit. If you make it to Cape Breton, at the north western tip is a town called Pleasant bay. If you hike the road further north from there (only one) it takes you up to a Buddhist monistary which is pretty cool to visit. Just beyond that you can climb down the cliffs to the ocean which is untouched and absolutely breath taking."
vagabond,31h216,wizehopt,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:36:43 2015 UTC,"Sweet, if you don't mind me asking, where did you catch out in Saint John? I know quite a few places but like I've said I've never actually tried it.  I'll probably go to Newfoundland on a longer trip, probably in a year or two. As of now, I'm heading to Halifax for the weekend (not backpacking, taking a bus) and I'll keep an eye on the highway route, as well as the city. I'm thinking NS is the best bet, but not sure if I'll make it to Cape Breton."
vagabond,31h216,wizehopt,1 point,Sun Apr 5 14:10:22 2015 UTC,"Man its been a while so cant remember exactly, but I believe it was the yard that ran along Rothesay Ave. Keep in mind this was back in 99, so a lot has probably changed.  From what I remember the city is pretty small and the line through it is pretty linear so it shouldn't be to hard to find a spot to catch out. If you live there then you have lots of time to scope it out and come up with a game plan. From the day I left, the train departed around 2-3am, there was also an earlier one which I missed which departed around 10am. IN my humble opinion the cover of darkness is always a safer bet, especially if its your first time.  Also I had to catch it on the fly at that point so you may be petter off catching out closer to town where it may be parked. But as of right now I couldn't tell you where that is.  It would take a day (or 2 max) to make it to the causeway hitch-hiking, and the trip around the Cabot trail is well worth it. Or even head up to PEI, some really sweet spots to explore up there as well. Its easy navigating the east coast and people are pretty friendly so I wouldn't worry too much about anything other than rain and keeping a bit of extra food on you cause its not all that populated in parts."

I'm also planning on scouting renforth/rothesay area because the train runs along the highway and goes into some shady groves, but chances are it's probably moving at quite the pace by then.  As for PEI, I love that place, it's city are really friendly and the weather is usually quite nice. As for food, the place is loaded with potatoes ahah."

vagabond,31b8ys,kaips1,17,Fri Apr 3 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"Ha... Before the paint I could park almost anywhere and get away with it, usually for multiple days in a row. After the paint the police really started hassling me in the mornings. I would be woken up weekly with a knock on the door. Normally you would just ignore it (Because they couldn't see in. What were they going to do about a parked car on the street?). Of course the knocking would scare my dog and she would howl at them, which gave me away. I never got a ticket or anything, they would just run my id and ask me to leave. They were usually pretty nice about it actually.   After dealing with that for a while you make sure to let no one see you get into the van at your parking spot and find a new place most nights. Since I was traveling it wasn't a really big deal to move often."

However, if we could hitch together for a while and learn from you directly, that would be the tits!"
vagabond,31d08z,_drybone,5,Sat Apr 4 05:45:40 2015 UTC,"That might be possible! I'm headed West now! Where are you hitchiking to? Arcata or Eugene or somewhere?  I'm planning to go to Kenai area and get a job on a boat.  (secret tip: If you scan alaska craigslist everyday starting right now, you can get a job on a boat instead of a cannery.)  I'm going to Alaska in mid-June hopefully. I might actually hitchhike there, but we'd have to talk about that privately.  Which cannery/company are you going to? Icicle or Silver Bay? I think you meant Naknek, which is up in the Kenai Peninsula, which is exactly where I'm going. Great fishing and camping up there."

vagabond,31d08z,KeelVerezy,2,Tue Apr 7 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"If you tell Canadian customs you're planning on hitching up the Alcan, they'll be less than impressed. I'm sure if you tell them, ""I'm going to the nearest border city"" they'll be pretty happy, but I know driving through to Alaska invokes a lot of questions like ""Do you have the money? What are your plans for gas?"" Aside from that, travellers on the highways are wary of hitchhikers because you never know where the hell they're going or how long they're going to be with you. Once you're in Alaska, hitching is rather easy, at least on the George Park's highway. I've never seen anybody between the border and Fairbanks, but I imagine it's rather similar because people have a destination in mind and you're either going to Tok or Fairy.  I work in Denali during the summer. If you make to that area, drinks are on me. Plenty of jobs if you don't want to work on a boat, too, but the majority probably don't pay as well."

vagabond,31a4g4,HighAngleAlpha0331,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:37:19 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the content of the sub. I'm not really concerned with reading other peoples' opinions or stories, but I love looking at photos and seeing where people are going. It motivates me to keep on chugging with an uncommon existence instead of settling for the permanence of a 9-5 job. Really, we could just keep everything in this subreddit and rely on self.posts instead of a blog, but would that kind of stuff be upvoted?"
vagabond,31a4g4,HighAngleAlpha0331,-2,Fri Apr 3 19:22:09 2015 UTC,Literally no one uses the phrase rubber tramp.  And why is it every time I see your user name it seems like you're setting up some way to monetize your experiences?
vagabond,31a4g4,TeoEsBueno,2,Fri Apr 3 18:05:27 2015 UTC,"If you don't know the difference between a rubbertramp and a vandweller, you're probably in the wrong subreddit.  Also, the website is a personal webspace, and it's non-monetized. If other travelers would like to get sponsors on the blog and share the profits equally, I would have no problem with that. But for right now, there are no intentions by anyone, including me, to gain any profit from this.  Anything else?"
vagabond,319xp0,Imnottheassman,10,Fri Apr 3 04:15:37 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend saving up some money for food. India is a country where the people literally can't feed/house the homeless population, much less some white/western backpacker. People literally starve to death on the sidewalks there...  Also, there has been a pretty big rise of gangs and kidnappings in India. Westerners have recently been targeted as easy kidnapping victims in the hopes that their families will pay whatever bribe is offered. The police are so deficient that they really can't do anything to stop it, or either they simply don't care enough to try. The city of Pune is the worst for this, so definitely avoid that area.  I'd probably recommend trying to look as humble as possible. No noticeably expensive backpack/gear, and don't pull out your smartphone or kindle in public, unless you really know the neighborhood you are in.  As long as you look fairly humble, and stay cautious of your surroundings, you should be fine through most of the country.   I'd probably try to hit up a cheap hostel for a few nights, find some other like-minded backpackers, and go as a team of atleast 2-3 people. That's your best bet."
vagabond,319xp0,huckstah,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:13:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude.  I think you're right, in that you'd need to rely as much (if not more) on westerners and other travelers (of which there are many, fortunately). But good advice on remaining humble and not trying to appear too ragged."
vagabond,319xp0,epicitous1,2,Fri Apr 3 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"see if you can hit up wizehop. he caught out in india. Travel is stupid cheap there though, so i would recommend just saving up."

vagabond,319xp0,wizehopt,2,Fri Apr 3 09:56:31 2015 UTC,"Again, having spent half a year there and traveling all over, I found the complete opposite to be true. So many friendly, generous, and goodhearted people, and no shortage of people and families willing to happily let you crash for a night and offer a meal if you're friendly and engaging. That said, I wasn't camping or sleeping rough, so that is more of what I was asking and wondering about."

Here's the deal: The FTRA is not dead. How do I know this? Because I met over a dozen ""FTRA"" just last year alone. Some were members from the original FTRA heyday of the 1980's, and some are recent punks that ""claim"" to be FTRA.  The problem is that whether a persons claim to be FTRA is true or whether it's bullshit doesn't really matter. What matters is if that that person is willing to wear a black bandana and slice your throat or push you off a moving train, and that is now happening, yet again...  FTRA is making a slow/pathetic comeback with this new group of ""wannabe"" FTRA members. They aren't nearly as organized as the old FTRA, but they are still every bit as deadly and dangerous. Even worse, their numbers are slowly growing.  If this recent rise (past 10-15 years) continues, these shitbags WILL eventually get more organized, and we are going to be dealing with an FTRA 2.0.   Watch the fuck out, trainhoppers. Avoid the jungles, is all I can tell you. If you see someone bragging about FTRA, or someone that has an FTRA tattoo on them, don't risk it: get the fuck out of there."

vagabond,30y5i3,w2g,5,Wed Apr 1 07:00:02 2015 UTC,"contributing? Lol, probably to liver damage. We ruled the world at that point, and it was great. The mall thing was only a small portion of our vagabonding. We ended up making it all around the country, Ocean Beach San Diego and Manhattan were my favorite places, but that's another story. The biggest challenge was at 9:00pm we had to be at the squat because the security guard would circle the parking lot after the mall closed. He had no idea we were back there and we wanted to keep it that way, but if we missed getting there that was that, we slept elsewhere, or had to maneuver through a mile of thorny overgrown brush. Another challenges was my wife had to keep her one uniform clean without having any real good way of doing that, and no real motivation for doing it right. We weren't all that concerned about the job, was just an easy 50-75 bucks a day, and if she got fired for being dirty then oh well, we would just move on. No sweat. Man what i wouldn't trade to go live a few days of that life again. Children have a way of changing your priorities."

vagabond,30y5i3,wizehopt,3,Mon Apr 13 17:44:13 2015 UTC,Have you slept in a hammock before?  You will need a good pad and sleeping bag or even better quilt.  Is there a forest close to your work in Hamburg or do you have a car?
vagabond,30y5i3,_drybone,2,Tue Mar 31 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"I sleep in my hammock every night, indoors. I have slept in it over 30 times outdoors in the last year. I have an underquilt, and a good blanket/pillow. I am currently doing a Google Maps search within a 30 minute bus ride from my work for some forest. No car though, don't plan on getting one when I have a card that my work provides me for public transport."

vagabond,30y5i3,wizehopt,2,Tue Mar 31 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"I mean I kind of fully explain the routine that I'd commit to.  I mean I just want to enjoy moving around the city, sleeping random places, living outdoors, being ultra-frugal, etc. Sort of a way to unconventionally minimalize."
vagabond,30y5i3,nuvistor,2,Wed Apr 1 06:57:31 2015 UTC,"Seems to me like you have it all planned out. I vagabond and work but I don't have an office job (i do restaurants, labor pool) and sleep in my van. But yes, I would say vagabonding while doing a 9-5 is feasible. But like others have said, it will be rough. Think about the money.  Most certainly, the gym will become like your best friend.  Mainly you should focus on getting a good night rest every night. Showing up to work tired from the night before could affect your job performance and outcome. Locating safe and good areas to sleep is key.   Stay safe and good luck."
vagabond,30y5i3,positive_pangolin,3,Wed Apr 1 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"Fuck I cant find it but I'm pretty sure it was here on reddit. There was a guy who had been living in his office. He would get up to shower at the building gym before people showed up for work and when ever he was dating someone and they were hooking up he would just say he had too many roommates and sleep at her place.  Not sure if your situation warrants those opportunities but if I can find the article Ill send it your way.   You could even save on food if you have soup kitchens and food banks in your area.  $100 for fun per month, damn dude...don't forget life is for the living also."
vagabond,30y5i3,positive_pangolin,3,Wed Apr 1 01:50:32 2015 UTC,I kinda did this at my last job. I had to commute 60+ mile with my own vehicle for three months when I was hired for training and they paid the gas mileage. I took my truck down there with a camper shell and parked it in their yard. It was a huge yard and there were lots of random vehicles mixed in with all the work vans so nobody spotted me that I know of. The building had a gym with showers so I worked out and showered there every morning for most of the 3 months and still cashed out on the gas alotment.

In the center of these countries, if you arent in a city, there tends to be alot of industrial sites, places with big wearhouses and long 3 lane motorways. a bit grey and grim for walking. if you stick closer to the coast, (not next to the sea) you tend to get better landscape and more grassland/farmland etc which can be more pleasant  Around coastal  portugal southern spain southern france and italy i would say would be the ideal place for walking"

vagabond,30xfa4,beginnavagabond,22,Tue Mar 31 14:21:50 2015 UTC,Knowledge is very lightweight and doesn't take up much space. The amount that you should have is more.
vagabond,30xfa4,huckstah,7,Tue Mar 31 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"When it comes to living a lifestyle that is on the road and outdoors, there is no such thing as too much mental preparation.  When I first hit the road, we didn't have all the technology and information that is available on the internet today. Sure, there were well-funded backpacking and survival bloggers, but certainly not this wealth of information about hitchhiking, rubbertramping, trainhopping, etc. There was no hitchwiki, squattheplanet, r/vagabond, tons of documentaries, video diaries, google maps, etc.  You basically just stuck out your thumb or hopped on a boxcar without knowing wtf you were doing. That led to lots of mistakes and bad experiences, including kids getting killed.  As one user put it, the brain has tons of free storage space and information doesn't add any weight to your pack, so definitely use it and learn as much as you possibly can.  Also, since you are apparently choosing this lifestyle and preparing beforehand, you have the option of ""experimenting"" with this lifestyle before you start living it full-time. Take as many camping trips as you can. Learn your gear, perfect your skills. Test out various different tarp setups and shelter designs, sharpen your firemaking skills, learn to fish, etc. You can do these things on the weekends or during summer breaks.  If anyone tells you that too much mental preparation is a bad thing, that person is a fool."
vagabond,30xfa4,OhMyGoat,5,Tue Mar 31 21:11:38 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily spoil. A good amount of research is always necessary to gain a certain idea of what you'll be up against. I say, keep researching. Gather ideas, make up plans, learn from the mistakes of others. But, you won't know everything there is to know by research alone. You have to live the lifestyle first. I will be on the road by the end of the year, and I've done quite a bit of research over the past couple of years. I've befriended people that are on the road, asked them questions, etc. Do you read blogs? Check out HitchTheWorld. He's a Texan that fucked off from home with 300 bucks on his back pocket and gave away to chance. He hitchhiked for a couple of years, travelling through South America, then stayed a couple of years on the Amazon river in Brazil. A very interesting guy. There's a pretty extensive archive on his blog, I bet you'll get a lot of kicks out of reading some. He's an excellent writer, down-to-earth, and with good advice.  I love reading stories. But I prefer to live them. It's like dipping your toes before going all the way in."
vagabond,30xfa4,CXR1037,5,Tue Mar 31 14:56:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because I'm a student now but I research the hell out of everything. Like others have said, you won't be able to know it all until you go experience it, but more knowledge is a good thing.   Also be advised: take everything you learn with a grain of salt. Especially from people you meet out on the road. People are often full of shit and have no idea what they're talking about. That's where research comes in handy.   For example: a drunk homebum told me once there's no way to get from LA to Chicago on UP. Of course before riding trains I looked up the UP system map and saw a thick red line...from LA to Chicago."
vagabond,30xfa4,anywhereness,2,Tue Mar 31 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"Don't overplan. Also, don't fall into the trap of ""oh, if I have/do/research this one more thing... I'll be ready.""  Where expectations meet reality, that's the special place where things go to get crushed. Usually those things are assumptions, expectations and naivety, and if you're not careful, maybe you.  So, keeping that in mind, insulate yourself from getting smashed to bits by using the tried and proven technique: Walk into the experience with an open mind and a child's curiosity.  Bring next to nothing. Acquire it if you need it. Discard it if you don't use it. Learn to ask the right questions. Above all else: Assume nothing except that you will persevere."

vagabond,30u0cx,huckstah,2,Mon Mar 30 22:36:44 2015 UTC,"Hey man! How old are you? I'm 21 years-old and from Argentina. I'll be hitting the road soon, just like yourself. You and me share the same fear. I decided to hit the road a couple of years ago, and think about it every single day. I'm also afraid that, after all the energy put into planning, buying the gear, reading up on some info, and all that time daydreaming will become nothing after I find out that the lifestyle is really not for me and decide to go back a month after leaving. But that's okay. Stepping out and heading to the road is all I need. I don't care if I come back 2 months later or 2 years later. I still pursued my dream, as scared as I was, and did it. So leave that fear behind you, and if this is what you want, then do it.   Don't worry about being an introvert. Out there, you're putting yourself in a position where no matter what you do, you'll have to at least talk to 3 or 4 different people everyday. You'll get used to talking and meeting new people.   Good luck man. Keep us posted with your travels!"
vagabond,30u0cx,OhMyGoat,2,Mon Mar 30 22:39:55 2015 UTC,"Man its a fuck of a lot easier than your thinking. Getting over the mental hump is the hardest part, and after your first day out there you will see. Keep in mind that most people who loose everything and end up on the street, don't do so because its the hardest thing on earth. It can suck at times, but its not hard.  Food isn't half as hard to come by as you may think, try to search out soup kitchens, bum feeds, food not bombs, ext when ever you arrive in a new city. You shouldn't ever have to resort to eating wild plants unless you really want to. Which if that's what your into, you shouldn't be worried, you should be exited.  Tent wise personal I would ditch it. I got rid of mine years ago and have never looked back. Keep in mind everything you have, you will need to carry. a bag which doesn't seem heavy when lifting for a second, can get really fucking heavy after a day of walking. Half of what you think you need you don't!  You will meet a shit tone of people don't worry there, and honestly if you talk to anyone who has traveled you will be hard pressed to find one person who would talk bad about it, or want to go back to being the person they were before they left.  Even if you hit the road and find out its not your thing...then its not your thing, no big deal. Your at a fork in the road man. Become the man you want to be, or live in fear the rest of your life."
vagabond,30u0cx,wizehopt,2,Tue Mar 31 02:57:42 2015 UTC,I say do it! What's the worst that could happen? If you don't like it you can always go home knowing that you tried. But if you don't go you'll always wonder what would have happened and probably regret it.

vagabond,30td3d,QuainPercussion,9,Mon Mar 30 15:33:26 2015 UTC,I've met 2 people in the past year that I knew from my gutterpunk days 20+ years ago. It happens.
vagabond,30td3d,keeeen47,7,Mon Mar 30 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"For me, it happens all the time. I mostly stick to the Western USA, and West Coast trainhoppers pretty much know most other west coast trainhoppers, atleast mutually.  I run into 4-5 people a year that I have seen on previous travels. San Francisco and New Orleans is where it happens the most for me.  As for how big the community is, I'd say the population of American trainhoppers is probably around 5,000-10,000 people, depending if it's summer or winter. The hitchhiking community is definitely larger, perhaps around 15,000-20,000."
vagabond,30td3d,huckstah,8,Mon Mar 30 22:24:40 2015 UTC,"It's somewhat common, especially in certain cities along certain well traveled routes. The catch-out spots/jungles/stores near the two and also highway on-ramps have been pretty stationary over the years, most people funnel towards the same few spots.   I've ran into the same folks more than once on almost opposite ends of the country. It's a wonderful feeling to experience, especially if you've had some extraordinary past experiences with the same person you run into so far away from wherever that other encounter took place.   You might have escaped a dangerous situation together, and shared that rush. Maybe you both endured something miserable together a few years back, a torrential downpour of rain or whatever. Now you're seeing that person again years later and the weather is gorgeous this time.   It's just a really nice affirmation that you're not alone out there, even if you're solo for the most part. Sometimes the run-ins feel incredibly serendipitous and you end up joining them and riding back the exact direction you just came from.   Trying to gauge the size of the community is difficult. It feels a little smaller than it was a decade ago, but I've also done a little less traveling in that decade so I'm not entirely certain of that."

vagabond,30rbxk,huckstah,8,Mon Mar 30 05:28:40 2015 UTC,"Haha say no more brother...I believe you.  I grew up in Green Acres BLVD. I left Butler when I hit the road, just like you are doing now. I left in 2004, after Don Lolly and his gang of crooks threw me in jail for possessing a small amount of marijuana. Also, I hated Butler all my life, and always told myself that I'd someday leave it for good, and that's what I did.  So now, by some amazing coincidence you have found my subreddit r/vagabond.   Even more of a coincidence, you are really, really, really, lucky right now, because I just came to a town 30 miles outside of Butler to visit some friends.  Want more coincidence? I am planning to go back on the road the EXACT same week you are!  This is, indeed, mind-fucking-blowing.  If you want to join me and learn from a pro as opposed to going off alone, as someone from Butler, it would be my honor and priviledge to help you out as much as I possibly can. It is my honor, as a fellow Butler refugee.  If you don't believe I'm from Butler, just listen to my podcast interview. I mentioned it :)  I remember your username from when you posted earlier posts here, such as this one. It's amazing to finally discover this weird coincidence. This is probably the strangest coincidence in my 11 years of traveling."

vagabond,30rbxk,ak1ndlyone,2,Mon Mar 30 06:15:03 2015 UTC,"I ran the mileage down from here to livingston via UWA.  45 miles from here.  That's a 15 hour walk.  Should be manageable so I'm leaving butler in the early afternoon and be around the college by Tuesday.  Since I'm currently without a cell phone...long story...talking on my bros tablet.    My mission is basically find work and make money where I go.  I have a few places I wanna go.  Ones in Kansas city Kansas.  One is in Texas.  Huntsville was where I was going to gather supplies to do this journey...since she's an old friend of mine.  My ultimate goal is Seattle.  I do not have any concrete goals.  But what I do know is that staying isn't helping.  I've one some basic research on the lifestyle...I by no means romanticizing it, but I'm aware that sitting around playing video games in a crummy town isn't living life.  I want to do something outside of my comfort zone.  Who knows?  I only have one life.  I have friends online who were at one point travelers themselves.  Ever heard of the rainbow warriors?  I believe they are environmentalist vagabonds.  I know a couple of guys from there.  My plan is to gather supplies up in Huntsville and then travel up north for the summer.   But plans can and do change.  You move forward, regardless."

I've been homeless 3 times in my life...I've had to scrape together stuff on the fly just to make it through some nights.

vagabond,30o6sa,ablino_rhino,19,Sun Mar 29 04:24:42 2015 UTC,"If you don't already have it, get a AAA membership (the upgraded membership, it's like 70/yr). The main reason for me is that you get three 100 mile tows on top of the roadside assistance, discounts, and other perks. A single 100 mile tow would cost you more than that for sure.  If you get to the end of the year with tows left over you can just use them to  get you further down the road without using any fuel. Personally I use the leftovers as designated driver tokens :D  There have been a couple times when I broke down, called AAA to buy a membership, then call them right back to ask for a tow. If I was down to my last 70 bucks and needed to go a few hundred miles I would spend it on AAA membership."
vagabond,30o6sa,_drybone,8,Sun Mar 29 04:49:53 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's genius! I never would have thought to use leftover tows to get further down the road. Thank you!"
vagabond,30o6sa,_drybone,4,Sun Mar 29 04:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah just tell them it won't start and don't let the tow driver tinker with it. You prolly don't even need to do that but I do it just to avoid trouble. And you do need to give them an address to drop it at, they won't just arbitrarily drop you 100 miles on down the road."

vagabond,30o6sa,TomAndOrSven,5,Sun Mar 29 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"I always carry a small bag of bathroom things so when I can hit a public restroom or river or whatever, I can clean up. Toothbrush, nail clippers, a baggy of Q tips, a metal tweezer. I'll keep my passport, razer, fork, spoon and butter knife in it too because it's a small bag I can wear with me under a light jacket or flannel and it doesn't get in the way.  I ran around with just a backpack so my backpack had all my clothes wrapped in a garbage bag, an extra roll or two of toilet paper, a small thing of mouthwash, universal soap like dr bronner's, then food on top. Sleeping pad was the frame. Tent closer to my back for support.  You have a bus so you can carry waaay more and be more comfortable. Plus you can have a stove for cooking and better food/water storage."

But, putting some distance between yourself and a bunch of negative influences in your life, that can be a great place to start working on yourself.  If you do hit the road, do so consciously.... Have a plan. Maybe part of that plan is to find a decent enough place where there are also free mental health clinics. Maybe that means finding something, however small, that's meaningful to you to be a part of. Whatever it is, it's for you and from you - always."

The first night by yourself in a Wal-Mart parking lot is a good feeling despite the sore neck.  You can kill whoever you were and build whoever you want to be.  If there's nobody left around you to define who you are, you can just consider who you were to be dead, and leave the definition of the new person you are up to yourself.  You can delete your facebook and get a new phone number and literally 99% of the people you knew won't have a way to contact you unless they knew your e-mail.  And you can always get a new e-mail.

vagabond,30lt2k,SunsetRoute1970,3,Sun Mar 29 14:47:41 2015 UTC,"If you go, be sure to tell your parents and friends before you bail.  This may seem counterintuitive, but the last thing you want is every State Trooper in America looking for your license plate.  If you decide that cars are too much overhead/burden (I did) pack like an infantry soldier--nothing you don't actually need.  Newbies and girls always bring way more stuff than they can reasonably hump.  It's not a big problem if you do, because after the first 48 hours you'll be shedding unnecessary gear like a scene out of ""Platoon.""  (Extra boots?  WTF?  Out. Entrenching tool?  Are you nuts?  Out. Three pairs of blue jeans?  Bullshit.  Out.  Ten changes of underwear?  Out.  Keep one.  Socks?  Okay, keep them.  Pitch the raincoat. Et cetera.) Don't carry a bunch of heavy crap.  Don't carry a bunch of expensive crap.  In fact, don't carry a bunch of crap, period.  Learn to make do with whatever you actually have and/or can scrounge. Things you will definitely need: --a backpack.  Everybody has their own opinion on packs.  Expensive backpacks are fine if you are hiking the PCT.  They are okay for hitching, but lousy for trainhopping.  Personally, I tramped for years with a self-modified M1952 canvas mountain rucksack with no frame.  After I wore it out, I switched to a Vietnam-era ALICE pack.  ALICE packs were hot shit and new back in the 1960s, but today are considered to be dinosaur technology by the kids.  They are tough as an anvil, and cheap, maybe $50-60 with frame.  Without frame (my style--slightly modified) maybe $35.  If you want to really go hobo, make your own pack, or just carry a bindle.  --sleeping bag.  Again, everybody has their own idea about bags.  I carried a goose-down, zero degrees  North Face bag back in 1968.  It was a pretty good bag, very warm, but it was made for mountain climbing, not train hopping, and it started showing damage and dirt pretty quick.  Today I carry a cheap, $14 Wal-Mart bag in summer and a ECW Marine Corps bag ($50) in winter.  Sleeping bags get beat up.  IMHO, they are disposable, almost.  In really cold weather, you need a serious bag, but in summer?  Not so much.  Go south when it gets cold.  --a good compass (learn to use it properly) and good maps.  --a roll or two of TOILET PAPER in plastic bags.  I use empty plastic bread bags..  (If you forget shitpaper, you will regret it.)  --Good boots.  I won't type that ""Everybody has different opinions"" crap again.  The kids like new-tech Buck Rogers boots.  I wear military surplus combat boots, $58 at Command Post.  I am opposed to wearing tennis shoes on the road, but whatever.  You turn an ankle in a hazardous situation, well it's not good.  Mileage may vary.  --Lots of socks.  Avoid cotton (""Cotton Kills"").  Change socks every two hours on a long hump.  I prefer wool-synthetic blend.  Wear a pair of inner backpacking socks to wick moisture away from your feet.  Take very good care of your feet.  Give them a rest from boots if you can when you take a break.  I carry a pair of $3 flip-flops for wear in a secure camp area.  If you are in a hinky situation, do NOT take off your boots, as you may have to run.  --a good, durable coat.  I carry a brown canvas chore coat in summer and a M-65 field jacket with liner and hood in winter.  You always need to have a coat, winter and summer.  --good, sturdy, dark clothing.  Blue jeans, Carhartts, etc.  Avoid bright colors.  --a good hat.  I use a Union Pacific crew cap, like a baseball cap.  --good leather work gloves..  I use ""trucker's gloves,"" I don't like the Mule Shoe type farm gloves.  --several bandanas,  They are exceedingly useful, for wash cloths, bandages, emergency toilet paper, etc.  --at least one gallon of water.  I carry a Ocean Spray cranberry juice jug that has been armored with duct tape and Masonite (on the bottom) to armor it up for dropping from moving trains.  In summer, I carry two gallons, one gallon of ""train water"" and one gallon of ""camp water.""  You don't EVER want to run out of water in the middle of nowhere.  A backpacker's water filter is not a bad idea, but they are pretty expensive.  Carry iodine tablets or pure Clorox in an eyedropper bottle to purify water.  Ten drops per gallon, or twenty if the water is muddy.  Wait 30 minutes before drinking.  (Chlorine and iodine taste like shit, but it's better than dysentery.)  --a gunboat to cook in.  Also, a plastic or stainless steel bowl, a knife and a spoon.  You can stir chow with a stick if you have to.  Don't forget lots of different ways to make a fire--Bic lighters, magnesium fire stick, etc.  In a real emergency any kind of oil or plastic will make a good fire starter aid, even potato chips.  So will a 5-gallon plastic bucket, if you have one.  --a decent knife.  Make SURE it is of legal length and design.  Check state laws.  --Food.  Good luck.  Write your mother, she'll worry."

Just make your plans, set a date and fucking leave for somewhere, anywhere be it in a car or hitching. Pack a sleeping bag, a pair of boots and socks and thats pretty much all you need.   Note though, that just because yu decided to be a bum for a few years doesnt mean you'll not want to eventually retire, which you'll likely do with like minimal real world experience (real world being like normal yuppie world experience cars, banks, jobs, taxs, education etc) and that puts you at a deficit especially if your like me and decided to do the school boy route."

I used to hate my hometown, so I traveled a bit, when to school, worked in my chosen field, then moved back to my hometown.  I don't hate it as I did before because I've learnt that you can be happy or miserable, lonely or surrounded by friends, in love or heartbroken anywhere in the world.

vagabond,30hgdm,kitty-committee,7,Fri Mar 27 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"We loved each other, but I think she could tell I wasn't happy. When we first started dating, she said she wanted to travel, but wasn't ready just yet. Eventually, she knew I was restless, so we had a talk and she admitted that, realistically, she didn't want to leave her family/friends/church and so we broke up. It was very civil and mutual though. We're still good friends! We understood that it was just too much of a lifestyle difference."

I don't think that this is about being a tame or feral human, you'd probably be just as happy with a job if you had the right one. Your emotions are more about your thoughts and needs than anything, and i'm sure you could have the right thoughts and needs in other ways than traveling.

vagabond,30f5qf,xpseudonymx,11,Fri Mar 27 01:42:18 2015 UTC,"I hope that ""new"" means ""new to you"". Don't buy a shiny new bike. Buy a used one that has great records and was shown TLC from a previous owner or two.  Not only did they work out all the kinks, you'll save thousands of dollars."

vagabond,30f5qf,shlerm,2,Fri Mar 27 22:01:49 2015 UTC,I have a Honda for the moment. It does its job but doesn't sprinkle my adventurous side.
vagabond,30f5qf,_drybone,2,Fri Mar 27 23:03:15 2015 UTC,So I guess finding a busted one to repair is out of the question.
vagabond,30f5qf,xpseudonymx,3,Fri Mar 27 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"I meant new to me; though, I have been entranced by the new Indian scout 2016. Most of the used bikes I was looking at were around the same price range as the Indian new; but I am hoping to find a gently used RUB purchased 2015, when I buy in 2016. I'm currently saving around 1k a month, so 15k has always been my purchase limit. I quit school in November 2014, and started saving in January of this year, and I am at 3k already, so by the time May rolls around I'll have 15k to play with. Don't know which bike i am going to get. Not getting a dual-sport; going for a cruiser. I know Dual-Sport will get me more places, but I plan on writing a book similar to Steinbeck's Travel's With Charley, and I plan on doing a LOT of highway miles, and trekking it on foot for nature areas.   I've been looking at Honda, Kawasaki Vulcans... anything liquid cooled and six geared in the gently used aisle... but damn, that Indian Scout just looks like a beast... I know, I know.. first year model... but damn..."
vagabond,30f5qf,xpseudonymx,5,Fri Mar 27 04:31:51 2015 UTC,"3-4k is the sweet spot. That'll get you a nice KLR, DR, DRZ, Strom, UJM.... The most ""proven"" cheap touring bikes.  If you're high balling, put a bit into making it comfy and fit for you. Including getting the suspension done again for luggage.  Take the rest you save and live, rather that buy stuff. Buying stuff is the core anathema to vagabonding; you won't need it. A shiny bike isn't going to make the trip better. Arguably, it'll make it worse, as you'll be worried about it more. Take that mental space that gets saved thinking about meth heads with bolt cutters or scratches on your shiny paint and park it in the rain still covered in filth to enjoy the ""Voted Four Times Best Damn Burger and Beer in the County!""  Edit: Fixed a word."
vagabond,30f5qf,_drybone,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about stuff. I've sold or given away 50% of my possessions in the last 6 months. In July, my lease is up and I am moving into a 1BR apartment with my best-friend and current flatmate in his living room. I'll have the opportunity to live in his living room bill free from July 2015 - May 2016.   My current ride is a 2004 Kawasaki Vulcan 500. I've put 30k miles on it in 2 years of riding. The longest single day trip I made was Chambana IL to Denver CO in 1 Day (22 Hours, 1050 miles). The second longest trip I took was from Philadelphia to Chambana IL (16 Hours, 800~ miles). The longest trip I've ever taken on my motorcycle was three weeks, from Chambana to St. Louis MO, Kansas City MO, Denver CO, Omaha NE, Enid OK, Kansas City MO, back to Chambana.   Before I moved down here, I was actually homeless for three years and lived in Homeless Shelters, in a Chevrolet Cavalier Coupe, a Honda Civic, Ford Ranger, in the woods, and bumming around. I actually got out of homelessness to attend University; until I realized that I wanted to travel, and not live paycheck to paycheck and/or waste my days in the neurosis and effeminate culture of academia.   As far as ""worrying"" about my bike; I'm not buying a 'new' bike because I want something 'new and shiny'. My little Rosie has riden through rain, sleet, snow, mud, gravel, dirt, asphalt--all the way from Illinois' in -10 degree weather with snow, to the Mountain air of Pike's Peak all the way to the salty air of the Atlantic Ocean. I've camped in Mark Twain's National Forest, the Rocky Mountains, the Ozarks, and on many a church parking lot and a farmer's field next to the highway.   The reason I have a particular bike fetish, is not because, ""Ooh! It's new and shiny!""  But, I've already been homeless, and living with nothing; and I'd consider myself a Biker first and a vagabond second. I LOVE motorcycling. I love the feel, the way the wind blows through my hair, the freedom, and the whole shebang. I don't like sports bikes. I can appreciate them, I can oogle at their bodies, but I just don't like the way they feel on me. Dual-Sports are also fantastic. My buddy has a BMW KTM and is a missionary in Guatemala and it's a great bike. I have another friend who has a Triumph Tiger--beautiful bike. But, when I am riding a dual-sport, I just don't feel it...   When I ride a cruiser, I feel spiritually akin. I'm not demanding that make sense. Nor am I suggesting it is the best vehicle for my plans. But, a Thunderbird, Scout, Vulcan, Highball, is more than likely in my future. I have no problem trashing it. No problem scratching it. But, to me, it's not about the destinations, not even about the journey, but about the ride--both figuratively and literally. I'm not looking to buy a new bike and trade it off; or buy a clunker and scrap it if needs be for another 3-4k bike. I'm looking at having a companion, my motorcycle will be a part of me, as Rosie is now.   So, yeah. You're 10/10 right. I am wrong, but that's kind of my MO. :D"
vagabond,30f5qf,adhoc92,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yeh I'm totally the opposite. I never saw the point of a cruiser when a dual sport is just so much more versatile and more fun to ride. I think of cruisers as old man bikes, jmo hehe"
vagabond,30f5qf,adhoc92,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:27:10 2015 UTC,Is it possible to buy a good-enough used motorcycle for a thousand? I'm a college student working a less than part time job and I want to head out this summer.
vagabond,30f5qf,adhoc92,2,Tue Apr 21 00:16:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely, but only if you have some mechanical aptitude to buy a bike that needs some ""TLC"". You might not be a motorcycle mechanic yet, but find some friends who are. Work with them to buy one that needs some work, and learn.  But, the risk down this route is that the reason why a cheap poor running motorcycle is running poor is that the reason why it's running poorly is worth more than the bike. Hence; having friends pick out a winner for you.  Really, you're looking for a bike that has something like a shot strator, and the guy is getting rid of it because he doesn't ""work on bikes"", can't be bothered, or some other nonsense."
vagabond,30f5qf,Humavolver,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:16:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for getting back to me! I've seen some bikes on Craigslist that the owners claim are in perfect working order (one is a Honda Nighthawk that I'm interested in). How wary should I be of those claims?
vagabond,30f5qf,Humavolver,2,Tue Apr 21 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"A little wary, but you know... If it idles OK, runs and rides, that's FAR better one that's a complete basket case. Again, I'd enlist some help from someone in your area to take a look with you.  Ones that have superficial damage (scuffs, scrapes, chips, small dents, etc) are the winners. You save a ton of money."
vagabond,30f5qf,residude,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:20:42 2015 UTC,Thanks again. I'll take a look around.
vagabond,30f5qf,_drybone,5,Tue Apr 21 22:57:51 2015 UTC,"I've thought a lot about doing this. Thing is, if you decide to work at a town or city for a while, would you leave town every night for sleep? Say, drive over to the nearest National Forest or BLM? I guess the mpg wouldn't be too bad on a motorcycle. Or would you urban stealth camp? If so, how?"
vagabond,30f5qf,residude,10,Thu Mar 26 22:05:46 2015 UTC,"The scenario you mentioned is actually a frequent occurrence, usually in BLM or NFS land. I've done this for weeks at a time if the spot is good.  One of the plus sides of having a motorcycle is the speed at which you can get between places in contrast to bicycling or backpacking. With a high MPG motorcycle, it can be cheaper than bus fare into town.  Usually, I'll pick a spot that is moderately accessible from a road, so I can keep the bike in visual range at night. I try not to pick a place where you have to ride/hike far from the road, as riding off trail really makes the rangers irate. Ideally, the tent could be obscured, or in a heavily camped area, placed prominently to mark my space.  Treks that are 15+ miles into town, down a winding mounting road... That's just your ""commute"" and it's usually a pleasurable experience.  I wouldn't advise urban stealth camping, as it's hard to find a spot where nobody will mess with you. Because of the ease of covering ground, the trade offs against the being in the boonies just don't add up."

vagabond,30f5qf,Sl33pT3rr0r,3,Fri Mar 27 02:32:11 2015 UTC,"Works great, but something to consider is that on a motorcycle you need to keep your gear super dry.

vagabond,30f5qf,jack_o_all_trades,9,Thu Mar 26 23:42:46 2015 UTC,"It's a 2001 KTM 640 Enduro, which I paid about $3,000 for. You can get an Asian dual sport much cheaper.  Even cheaper, is the Chinese versions. For example the TMEC 200 sells for $3k new. Or the newly released Zongshen RX3 which is $3500 new, with hard case panniers. You can imagine what they go for used.  Or even cheaper, just pick up a small displacement ""UJM"" for less a grand nearly everywhere there are barns.  Edit: minor wording  Edit 2: I know that a few thousand dollars seems like a lot of money, but really it's a decision away. You decide to make whatever sacrifice to save up for it, then commit to it. Maybe that means an apartment and crappy job for a year, or selling whatever, or no side entertainment for a bit... Whatever it takes if it's what you really want."

I noticed the lack of grass with all that sand might mean southwest where it's hot.  Do you do the regular vagabond jobs, dishwasher, linecook, labor etc?

Can't always eat granola bars and at cafes for Brekfast, lunch, and dinner what do you usually eat and how do you cook it/store it?  How many friends have you made doing this? How do you keep in touch with them? Is there a lot of couchsurfing?  Do you have a list of people you know in each state that you stay at?  I'll think of some more questions in a second.

My goal is to see how long I can keep this up for and validate this way of life against my expectations for ""success"".  I've been all over the USA. The outdated gallery is located at www.anywhereness.org, which will hopefully get an update soon. My plans are to get to Central and South America sometime soon. Both to explore and hopefully bring down the cost of living. I try to avoid snow, but everywhere is fair game.  I could be considered a ""digital nomad"" too, as I have a part time gig doing software development. On the side, I'm trying to create some ventures that will hopefully make me financially independent of any job. Being in business for yourself is the best kind of business.  I have an address. Previously it was with some friends, but have recently ""moved"" to South Dakota. SD is one of the few (or only) states that let you have a mailing service as your principal address. I use America's Mailbox, and there's a sign up deal here, but the downside is that you need to appear in Rapid City, SD in person.  I use a super cat stove, HEET (yellow) cook fuel, and some nice Snow Peak cookware. Sometimes meals are cold, sometimes they're hot, but I try to eat well. To be honest, in America it's pretty easy to make healthy cold or hot meals for yourself, especially since a supermarket isn't a bit deal to get to with wheels.  I've made a ton of friends. Most have faded. Some we just touch base now and again. Some seem to stand the test of time and we're close still. I have done couchsurfing, but not in the last year through the web site.  I try to avoid calling up to bum a place for any more than a day or two, if I can help it, unless it's a girlfriend or close family member.

vagabond,30f5qf,fluffsnstuffs,2,Fri Mar 27 03:12:26 2015 UTC,"Hm... ""Pleasant""? Well... Here's the raw deal.  There are definitely ups and downs. But more so than ""regular life"", it is what you make of it. You try your best to make it best for you, whatever that is. For me, it's being outdoors often, rocking out coffee shops with my laptop, drinking beers with new friends and hopefully making a positive impact on people.  There are downs, negative events and man... They hit hard, especially when you're homeless and there's no refuge or ""safe place"" to fix it. You have to be inventive to make that safe place, and be prepared for it should it arise. You need to fully trust in yourself.  So, I guess it averages out to be pretty good though. I wouldn't say ""pleasant"", as much as I'd say it's liberating, and if you make it such... sometimes awe inspiring amazing."

vagabond,30fnkt,OctavianBC,3,Thu Mar 26 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"I would think it depends on the concentration of fumes and the length of exposure.  The particulate matter from diesel exhaust would be mostly handled by a bandana or respirator. Particulates are responsible for long term effects, like cancer. The more present danger comes from inhaling carbon monoxide, which binds with oxygen receptors and can kill you without you knowing.  Chronic exposure to either cannot be good.  if you are exposed for such amounts of exhaust that you are even thinking about a respirator, you probably just shouldn't. Are you getting headaches?  Edit: added this:  A bandana or respirator will not help against CO."

Can just the diesel particles themselves cause severe acute reactions?"
vagabond,30fnkt,tjdavids,3,Fri Mar 27 05:50:12 2015 UTC,"honestly, from a chemist's perspective you might try alternating whipits with CO and it'll unbind the CO a lot faster, but that being said probably a lot slower than it'll unbind the O2. more realisitically your looking at tar and hydrocarbon poisioning which a wet rag would help a lot with, if you want to grab a lot of the CO too you can douse it in a stronger acid, think vinegar or lemon juice."

I've been through the two longest tunnels in North America in a 48 well with only a dry bandana. Yeah it sucks and I wouldn't take deep breaths but your not gonna die or poison yourself. Honestly the cigs I smoked afterwards were probably way worse.
vagabond,30fnkt,wizehopt,2,Sun Mar 29 05:44:41 2015 UTC,"This may be a bit overkill, but some good facts here http://www.iapa.ca/pdf/carbon_monoxide_feb2003.pdf  Also a N90 respirator wont do shit for you if your ever in a situation where there is too much carbon monoxide. You would basically need a self contained breathing apparatus or a mask with special chemicals to survive, which is not really practical for hopping trains.  Here is a quote from the above PDF encase your to lazy to read it.  ""Carbon monoxide interferes with the ability of the blood to transport oxygen. Haemoglobin, a protein present in the red blood cells, normally binds oxygen (to form oxyhemoglobin) and transports it to all parts of the body. Carbon monoxide competes with oxygen and binds to haemoglobin (to form carboxyhemoglobin or COHb) much more easily. Carbon monoxide is therefore a chemical asphyxiant. This means that it prevents sufficient oxygen from reaching the tissues of the body. Insufficient oxygen can cause DEATH""  From another source:  ""Smoke particles can rapidly clog gas mask filters, and filters with special chemicals are needed to protect against carbon monoxide and other gases that may occur.... Not all gas masks and escape respirators protect against these hazards. ""  So even a special mask with the right chemicals to block carbon monoxide will not necessarily help you because they don't replace the oxygen which is missing in the air.  All that being said, I wouldn't worry too much about getting killed in a tunnel. There are enough other things to worry about before you even get into a situation like that."
vagabond,30fnkt,TexasDenizen35,0,Sun Mar 29 22:13:55 2015 UTC,"There is actually very little carbon monoxide created in diesel exhaust.  This is not true of GASOLINE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES however.  Gas engines will kill you in a New York second.  Diesel exhaust contains lots of oxygen (O2), very little carbon monoxide (CO.)  It would require hours and hours of exposure to diesel exhaust to hurt you.  It would be very unpleasant though, because of a class of chemical present in diesel exhaust called ""aldehydes.""  Human beings react badly to the presence of aldehydes.  It's what makes diesel bus exhaust so unpleasant.  It smells horrible, but it's not poisonous.  AGAIN, diesel exhaust stinks, but it's not poisonous.  GASOLINE EXHAUST WILL KILL THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.  Any way you can filter the particles of diesel exhaust out of the air will improves things.  Wet down a bandana, tie it over your face, then put your face in the armpit hole of a coat or jacket and hold the cuff of the sleeve closed tight.  This will create a more-or-less clean reservoir of air to breathe, inside the sleeve.  Most tunnels are just a few minutes long.  The worse one I was ever in was about twenty-five minutes, and that was because the train slowed down to a crawl for some reason.  NEVER GET OFF YOUR TRAIN IN A TUNNEL.  NEVER!  It's pitch black, and dangerous as hell.  If you get off the train there is a very good chance you may die or be seriously injured.  How would anybody know you were there?  How would you call for help?  Who would you call?  NEVER GET OFF YOUR TRAIN IN A TUNNEL.  Be calm.  Don't panic.  Wait.  The train will eventually clear the tunnel. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_exhaust"

So I guessed there wouldn't be much of a problem with police.  And since there were people around all the time, I felt safer than at some remote location."

If you're just sleeping and aren't obstructing anyone, you're generally not going to be bothered unless you're in certain areas (e.g. embassy row)"

The only recorded version i've found is here. The lyrics are also hard to come by.   Edit:  McClintock was a radio personality, so he was responsible for popularizing alot of tunes. I used to busk with ""Hallelujah I'm a Bum"" which is an old IWW song. If I recall correctly he sung more than a few wobbly songs."

vagabond,3055aw,calrebsofgix,10,Wed Mar 25 03:37:23 2015 UTC,It's patriotic - but really patriotic. Not that flag-waving tail-wagging grandstanding patriotism. The kind of patriotism that calls you out when you're wrong.
vagabond,3055aw,robshookphoto,4,Tue Mar 24 21:11:30 2015 UTC,I don't know about that. People in Guthrie's area of politics are generally anti-nationalist. It's hard to be patriotic when you disagree with the concept of states and countries altogether.
vagabond,3055aw,calrebsofgix,2,Wed Mar 25 02:40:25 2015 UTC,"As I understand Guthrie, he was more of a populist and a union supporter. I don't recall him being specifically anti-nationalist but rather being a victim of the early rattlings of communist fear-mongering."
vagabond,3055aw,robshookphoto,3,Wed Mar 25 03:11:16 2015 UTC,"As I understand Guthrie, he was more of a populist and a union supporter.   1) The song was written in response to ""God Bless America,"" which he criticized for its nationalism.  2) ""As I went walking I saw a sign there  And on the sign it said ""No Trespassing.""  But on the other side it didn't say nothing,  That side was made for you and me.""    That is fairly blatantly against private property, which is not populist - it's leftist.   3) A  quote from Guthrie - ""The best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party.""   I don't recall him being specifically anti-nationalist but rather being a victim of the early rattlings of communist fear-mongering.   The problem with the red scare is not that people were communist; it's that they and communism were deliberately smeared."

I've had a lot of success with ""Edible Wild Plants"" by Thomas Elias and Peter Dykeman.  The Peterson guide to wild edibles is really good too in that it teaches you about the different plant structures you need to know if you want to get good at identifying plants, but personally if you only get one guide I'd go for the first one.  The usual disclaimers are to be absolutely sure you know what you're eating and to check with a local expert.  There are wild edibles with look alikes that will kill you in a matter of hours.  If you stick to the easy to ID ones provided in that guidebook you'll probably be fine, but if you catch yourself scratching your head and wondering then you don't know what it is so you shouldn't eat it."
vagabond,307pt8,Frightened_Peasant,2,Wed Mar 25 13:16:43 2015 UTC,"David Arora's ""All that the Rain Promises and More"" is also a really handy one for mushrooms. It's small enough to fit in your back pocket, with a great system laid out for quick identification in the field. Even has a lot of good information on specific flavors/recipes etc.  (I think it is specifically for North America though, so might not be safe/reliable to use in other countries)"
vagabond,307pt8,Javacalypse_Now,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:44:04 2015 UTC,One final piece of advice.  Don't trust IDs you get off the internet.  In one of the Facebook groups I'm in some jerk off mistook cow parsnip for fennel and told op to eat a little to see if it tasted like licorice.  Cow parsnip is one hell of a nasty plant that you don't even want to brush up against let alone eat.
vagabond,307pt8,Frightened_Peasant,2,Wed Mar 25 13:27:45 2015 UTC,I would take that a step further and say if you have to look the plant up dont eat it. and never eat a mushroom. Foraging doesnt give you an easy time if you fuck up an ID

vagabond,2zzmje,dkdaniel,5,Mon Mar 23 15:41:46 2015 UTC,"You don't get biodiesel from a restaurant, you get waste cooking oil, which you can run a car on if you make the right modifications to a diesel engine. Biodiesel can be used on an unmodified diesel engine, but if your RV runs gasoline, you're out of luck. Another thing to consider is the age of the vehicle. Some older vehicles have hose components that will be dissolved by biodiesel (don't know about veggie oil).From what I've heard, it was possible to get waste oil and do a cross country trip 5 or more years ago. These days, a large fraction ends up going to commercial biodiesel plants. You might be able to do it, but be prepared to shell out cash for a regular diesel fuel up, or even for some canola oil at a grocery store. Other things to consider is that you will likely have trouble running veggie oil in cold climates, and a block heater is a necessity."

But I've also run into people who treat their animals poorly, don't bring enough food/water for them, don't bother with vets, etc. Those people can rot in hell. I remember watching some oogle girl's chihuahua shivering in a boxcar in Oregon in winter and all she kept saying was: ""OH LOOK SHE LIKES IT!""   Also I think dogs are about the only animal you should take traveling. Though I have seen discussion on pack goats, and that seems neat, but I don't know how they deal with most modes of transportation. And for the love of god, do NOT bring rodents on the road. Unless you're traveling with a pharmacy of drugs, a nebulizer, a temperature controlled cage, and plenty of food and water, you're just going to kill them."

vagabond,2zsyol,Wildbark,22,Sat Mar 21 14:21:18 2015 UTC,"She's about two years old now. I found her on Craigslist somewhere near Albuquerque last fall. A family was giving her away because they were moving, but I really suspect she was abused. She was INCREDIBLY timid when we first met. Deathly scared of me, of cars, of trains and other people. She didn't know how to walk on a leash and never had worn a collar. My first time walking her she slipped out of the collar and hid under my van in the rain for about an hour one night. I just crawled under there and talked to her the whole time until she let me catch her.  After a lot of time spent with her, she's really become one of the best behaved dogs I've ever seen. She barks only when I'm sleeping and danger is around (or police). She can walk through a crowd at a parade with sirens going off everywhere without a care in the world. Being together all the time gives me so much time to do any sort of training I want and shepherds learn quick. She's still timid around strangers, but never aggressive.  Unfortunately people think I was the one who abused her and I get all these sideways accusations when she slinks away from strangers trying to pet her."

Just go to tiling places like Rite-Rug, or go to developmental housing areas and try to find supers or carpenters and ask if they're hiring or need another person in their crew. This is definitely the time that work is kicking up in those areas and they're always looking or people. Especially painters. I walked up to one straight up and just asked him if he needs a hand for a few weeks. He gave me a job and I just crashed in some of the houses, or they left a truck near the site and I'd just sleep in that. Good money in too. Can make anywhere from $150 to maybe as steep as $500 a day.Mostly all in cash at the end of the week too. Great skill to have to. Buy a used cargo van, get some tools, start getting solo jobs through the same supervisors, work and live out of the truck for a month or two. Then if you like it, hire your own crew; they'll just meet you at the job sites everyday; or the warehouse i you're doing carpeting or laying tile. Then just go from there, save and get a place. If you start running your own crew though, save a lot more money in case of back jobs where someone messes up. usually companies make you take those out of your own pocket."

Be respectful and cool as LA don't play. I witnessed plenty of violence while I was there.   If you stay in Venice Beach there aren't many places to go when it rains. I've had tense moments that I thought would come to blows trying to keep my covered spot in a rainstorm. I had more more luck finding peaceful covered spots in the canals.   Alcohol is super expensive on the beach so if you want to drink be prepared to walk a ways/catch a bus to somewhere cheaper. $10 for a Sidewalk Slam is highway robbery if you ask me.  I made no money panhandling on the beach. Too much competition. I made decent money flying a sign in downtown Culver City.   Be very wary of older locals. I don't know how old you are or your gender but there are tons of predators that prey on transients in LA. The police won't give a shit if you end up getting killed or raped either.   If you have ID you can find work on the beach holding up signs for dispensaries and other such businesses.   Don't sleep on the beach or under the life guard stands. They do sweep them and will arrest you. I'm going to tell you about my old squat though, and this is open to everyone else of course. It's in a parking lot on Ocean Ave just south of the Santa Monica Pier. Here's a Google Street View of it. Do you see that waist-high concrete wall? Sleep between that wall and the bushes that are on the other side. I spent a whole winter right there behind that wall.   West Hollywood is very unfriendly to transients. LA County Deputies don't mess around. They'll just arrest you immediately. Hollywood can be a fun place to hang at night.   Oh yeah, if you hit the beach ask around for this Catholic feed called something something Roses. Not exactly clear I know but that was the best feed around by far while I was there. The locals will surely know it.   I hope I didn't scare you. Despite all of this I had a great time the winter I spent there.   Edited for clarity."

Insulin that is not in use should be stored in the refrigerator. If refrigeration is not possible, it can be kept at room temperature [15-25 degrees C] for 28 days. The in use vial may be kept at room temperature [15-25 degrees C] for 28 days.  In use cartridges should be kept at room temperature and SHOULD NOT be kept in the refrigerator.

Since you're in the PNW, I'd also suggest an underquilt or a sub-zero sleeping bag (which would be great for in the hammock or in the car). All together you're looking at $200-$300, but it's well worth it to have warm, dry, and comfortable place to sleep anywhere without having a big bulky awkward tent to deal with. I doubt you'd ever have trouble finding a tree or something to hang from in the PNW, but as you travel, you can also DIY a pole setup pretty easily and cheaply to hang your hammock from your roof rack to the pole. Great option if you're in Utah for example. No trees to hang from and snakes on the ground? No problemo!"

Already looking at ways to build an insulated platform for a bed, curtains, all the stuff to make it feel home-y.  I'll probably live in it for a few months at least after I hike the JMT in July...."

vagabond,2zpxs0,drivingaroundusa,4,Tue Mar 31 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"Go for a truck or van. The ford econoliners are plentiful and cheap when bought second hand. Check out /r/vandwellers for more info. That's really a much better resource than this. There's a few rubber tramps, but it's mostly hitchikers/trainhoppers. 10 years ago, I went from phoenix to mezula montana, to little rock to phoenix to little rock to phoenix in a ford econoliner. always had 2,3, or 4 people one was 6'2"". No problems. we had a fold out foam futon couch in the back, and carpet. That was enough cushion and insulation. You'll run into some condensation issues. If you can glue any kind of fabric to the metal, that should handle most problems, then you'll just need a towel on hand to wipe the windows with when you're ready to roll. Also, make curtains for all your sleeping area openings. If security/cops see you sleeping back there, they'll sometimes try to run you off. If they can't see you, just ignore them and they'll usually leave."
vagabond,2zpxs0,explodingNeko,2,Fri Mar 20 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"Ahhh. I hadn't discovered /r/vandwellers yet. Thank you! :) And I spend a lot of time in a tent. Condensation and I are old friends.  Good suggestions.  Im going to try and National/State Park hop my way around, so the cops should get along with me, but curtains are probably a good idea regardless.  Also, the trip you took sounds a lot like the one I'll be making if I can get the vehicle in time."
vagabond,2zpxs0,satiredun,3,Sat Mar 21 01:19:50 2015 UTC,I came here to suggest /r/vandwellers. I have the same goals as you. I went and got a van and am currently fitting it out. I've Invested less than $2000 on it. Check out my post history.
vagabond,2zo1o7,IrishBoJackson,5,Fri Mar 20 04:32:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on the type of homeless person, I think. Some houseless people are happy doing what they do, and some are out on there ass while still relying on normal society.People like me don't want or need help getting on their feet. We are on our feet. Our feet just happen to be dirty. I know I have no desire to be off the streets anytime soon. The standard newspaper-house dwelling bum probably does cost more to get off the streets."
vagabond,2zo1o7,huckstah,5,Fri Mar 20 04:46:58 2015 UTC,We are on our feet. Our feet just happen to be dirty.   Wonderfully well put.
vagabond,2zo1o7,huckstah,5,Fri Mar 20 05:02:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can either be bum, and or be a vagabond. That's the choice really. And a vagabond can be a rubbertramper, trainhopper, hitchhiker, backpacker, whatever.   But if you're going to sit on a sidewalk, in the same town, long-term, and panhandle every day? That's just being a bum. Panhandling or flying a sign has it's place and time, but certainly not doing it in the same town for many weeks in a row. That's not vagabonding, that's straight-up bumming.   However, most bums are mentally ill or drug-addicted, in which case they need rehabilitation healthcare. Unfortunately, homeless people don't have healthcare insurance, and our government provides very little assistance to address those issues."
