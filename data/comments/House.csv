House,3dfc7d,Factor1,8,Wed Jul 15 20:48:02 2015 UTC,A dj is a disc jockey. A person who plays tracks.   A producer makes the tracks.   A dj may produce tracks.   A producer may dj.
House,3dfc7d,Sofiztikated,4,Wed Jul 15 21:18:51 2015 UTC,Succinctly and accurately summarized
House,3dfc7d,disco54,2,Wed Jul 15 21:46:16 2015 UTC,"Here's how this all started:   In the beginning, there were musicians, and there were singers. Musicians played one or more instruments. Sometimes they also sang.  Then the musicians got together and formed bands. It was more fun, and they could create much more together than alone. Sometimes they also sang. Then came a way to record them. First the phonautograph, then the phonograph, then vinyl and tape. Finally, bands could be enjoyed without hearing them live! Bands became huge. At the same time, radio disc jockeys became a thing. They played records. They presented records. They selected records. And then the shit hit the fan, and the lines started to blur. A lot:   1960s: Reggae brought an important innovation: the emcee (on the mic) + the selector (playing records). Eventually, the emcees morphed into rappers and the selectors morphed into DJing.  1970s: Disco (live bands + singers) became massively huge. Also, New York DJs like David Mancuso and Nicky Siano became hugely popular, playing all types of music including disco. Nicky Siano taught Larry Levan and Frankie Knuckles how to DJ (in New York). Not a lot of people know how to DJ at this time. The techniques are still very new.   1977: Frankie Knuckles took a job DJing in Chicago. At the Warehouse. He played a lot of disco and other stuff too. Other DJs in Chicago also become very successful, including radio DJs like the Hot Mix 5. The techniques of DJing are starting to evolve.  Late 1970s: Disco starts to die out  Early 1980s: Drum machines from Linn and Roland! Hooray! (But they're super expensive, so there are only a few producers right now). Afrika Bambattaa releases Planet Rock. Marvin Gaye releases Sexual Healing.   1983: By now, with disco practically dead in America and basically everywhere except Italy, so Frankie can't find enough disco music for his club nights in Chicago. So he asks a sound engineering friend of his to help him create his own disco mashups and special edits by cutting and pasting reel-to-reel tape. A house DJ is now also starting to 'produce'. Frankie also starts putting disco and soul vocals over drum machine beats. House Music is born (see also 1984)!  1984: BIG YEAR for the word 'Producer' Meanwhile, while Frankie and his friend are cutting up tape to make disco mashups and extended edits of his disco songs, producers like Jesse Saunders (who is also a DJ!) and Jamie Principle make the first huge hits that become House records: 'On and On' and 'For Your Love'. And the price of a Roland drum machine plummets, which means...yay, producers become more common! And with the success of DJ Jesse Saunders and his song...lots of other DJs start producing!  And this is all before Chicago invents acid house, Detroit invents techno, Germany invents trance, England invents Drum and Bass, etc.!  Okay, so recap: DJs used to only mix songs. But then drum machines came along and some of the DJs started also making songs. Some producers kept just producing and not DJing, but in reality many producers also kept DJing. So really, from the very beginning of dance music (starting with House in Chicago), DJing and Production have been two peas in a pod. Oh, and some DJs say they Produce but they don't actually make the songs themselves...but that's a story for another book.  Also, this documentary is a must-watch for any fan of dance music:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1HpY65cXDA"

House,3dfc7d,disco54,2,Thu Jul 16 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"It used to be fairly simple. DJ's played tracks that artists produced and until we got to disco it was that way.  Then Tom Moulton started re-editing and remixing tracks to make them more suitable for the dancefloor, pretty soon other DJ's were invited into the studio to remix other artists work. After all, who better to make a record dancefloor friendly than a guy who stares at dancers and dancefloors and listens to music every night? The idea of the DJ/remixer is a reality  By the time the early 80's roll around technology is cheaper, better, more flexible and available for use at home so the first generation of house DJ's in NY could make tracks at home as could techno producers in Detroit. So the DJ was now an artist in his own right.  And that is roughly it. Although to complicate matters there are some producers and artists who learned to DJ because they were offered vast sums of money and it made sense to learn to play, famously Todd Terry describes himself as a producer first and DJ second  As for where you can listen to it try this site.

Taking out right pay and not getting royalties, not having his name featured on the track. You can tell he learned his lesson now, with starting his own record label.  Talented vocalist definitely, business guy not so much at least previously. Hopefully he finds talented artists to collaborate with that share the spotlight with him so everyone gets credit."

You can only think Morgan Geist and whoever else knew exactly what they were doing when they payed him off. The success of the song would have been impossible to predict however, a lot of it came off the back of MK's remix.  Also to be fair to Morgan Geist, nobody outside of the underground knows who he is even and most people never payed any attention to the Storm Queen project itself, it was Marc Kinchen who got the majority of attention from that song."

It's basically criticizing the track, and some old dude who made a song 50 years ago is disgusted by it. Next is a young fan of the two guys who made the track. He thought it could bring a wrong message and thus sent a mail to the local newspaper (looks like it's ~8 pages) with some way too serious remarks.   A popular radio commentator gets nostalgic feelings when people get upset about the content of a song. It used to happen a lot in the thirties but nowadays no one does it to this extent.   When ronnie and lil kleine did a live version of the track they used different lyrics. Liquor and drugs became crisps and cola (there have been more parodies, brownies and downies, vegetables and fruit)  Lil kleine says he doesn't promote drug usage.  Old grumpy guy rambles a bit about drugs and how it's always present in society because people can't get enough of it."

House,3ccpdx,InspiredRichard,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:23:47 2015 UTC,"Yeh I feel what you're saying, I guess from talking to artists that fit in this a spectrum, 'exposure' isn't really something they want or need. Additionally there are a number would actually prefer people pirated, rather than give money to Spotify who then doesn't pay artists.   As far as going into debt, give yourself a budget and stick to it; I give myself $150 a week to spend on music and I don't go over that.  I guess it's not in a lot of ways, however, you're not paying any money to listen to it there, so the artist isn't missing out on anything are they?

I'd like to see that money divided amongst the musicians I listen to, rather than the total of who people listen to. I'm hoping that one day they change this."

House,3bzk4c,the_stone_roses_1337,2,Fri Jul 3 12:37:47 2015 UTC,"Not as good as the original  Edit: I thought I would add why I don't like it really. If this is your edit then this is my opinion, obviously you don't have to listen to it but here it is any way. I am not a massive Jamie XX fan but I do like the original mix of Gosh because for me it actually feels unique. A lot of Jamie's music is unique but it's very hit and miss for me. However with Gosh, I loved it. The breakbeat tone and throwaway vocals made it sound like it was a demo straight out of the London underground club scene back in the 90's. Only to have that amazing synth build up crescendo moment for the latter half of the track, it had a proper Euphoric feel to it. But this edit basically takes away all that and turns it into a bit of a boring 4x4 track. The drums seem to have been made the main point instead of the awesome synths and the whole thing just seems generic and doesn't stand out at all. Adding that 4x4 beat made it a lot less interesting, for me anyway."

House,3broqx,Scythin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:34:49 2015 UTC,Really great track. I know this track exploded last year but was it the Joy Orbison essential mix that started it or was it gaining steam before that? If it was the former it really goes to show how much influence Joy O has. His essential mix is also one of the best ever in my opinion.
House,3bqdgr,djmashupredsthe3rd,3,Wed Jul 1 08:24:30 2015 UTC,"Bicep are really confusing me at the moment, I've followed them for just under 5 years now. I've been to see them twice in the last 6 months, the first shortly after their Hot Tub Slamz 2 (a very light hearted summery mix) mix and the second a couple of weeks ago at Sonar. I have to say I was expecting them to play their old style, and stuff like this, especially the Sonar set which was a sunset set. But instead they went for more moody techno, which is totally fine, but I'm just confused as to the disparity between their releases and their sets. Anyone else seen this?"
House,3bqdgr,DigbyDoesDallas,3,Wed Jul 1 11:50:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's more they don't want to be shoehorned as an act where you know what you are gonna get before you even see them. I see so many acts on lineups and I know exactly the kind of set they will do before they even come on, and that's boring. I've seen Bicep loads of times and every time it's different and brilliant. Just look at their XOYO lineups and the big diversity in artists, from disco to techno and weird stuff like Hodge. They even said they want to go the whole 13 weeks without playing the same song twice which I think is so cool. You see quite a lot of artists just regurgitating the same set every time they play but the artists which stand out for me always bring something different each time you see them. The same ethos goes for the music they release as well where they like to incorporate a lot of genres that they love. Be it 90's house, early 2000's techno, or 70's disco. A year ago they released their LWE podcast which was full of dreamy techno and then this year they do the hard hitting Hot Tub Slamz II which was a big difference in style but both were brilliant (Their LWE Podcast is probably my favourite all time mix with Joy O's Essential Mix). I think it's awesome that no matter what they decide to play or release they always kill it."
