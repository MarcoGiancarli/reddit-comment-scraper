When I bought the nail polish (in full boy mode, which is all I have for now), the cashier said ""this color will look great on you"". I was speechless, and had a moment of pure joy. I'm 99% sure she was trying to make a stupid joke. But wow. Just. Wow."
transpositive,3e4knh,ultravegan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:00 2015 UTC,"I went informed consent, so it was pretty straight forward. I talked to a medical doctor, we discussed effects of HRT, then I got blood work done. A week later, I talked to a therapist at the clinic and we went over a lot of basic psychological health stuff, covering any issues or concerns that I had. Once she had gotten to know me a bit (1 hour) she okay'ed me to start HRT. Another week later the doc and I went over my blood work, talked about dosage and options, and I walked out with a prescription. Cake."
transpositive,3e4knh,Solem3,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:12:10 2015 UTC,So since I'm going to see a  therapist first he will tell me to go see a MD if he wants to give me a prescription?
transpositive,3e4knh,Solem3,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:30:14 2015 UTC,"If the therapist is associated with a doctor that does informed consent, then you will probably be seeing a doctor or soecifically an endocrinologist soon. If the therapist is more of a standalone deal, you'll probably take longer to get on hrt and the rherapist will eventually write you a letter which you will take to an endo- who will then run bloodwork for you and write you a prescription. It really depends on where you're going and the policy of your therapist- it would be good to ask them what their usual policy is for getting patients on HRT."

HRT is a common route, along with top surgery to get rid of breasts, and some undergo surgery downstairs. Surgery downstairs is rarer for trans men since the surgery not as good as MtF downstairs surgery in creating a neopenis (MtF neovaginas can be indistinguishable to natal vaginas, even to gynecologists), but it's something.  And you can't currently grow sex organs and transplant them. If you could, a lot of trans women would be on that boat, since it means we could get uteruses and possibly give birth.  Oh, and the proper term for non-trans is cis. Before bigots feed you what they say it means (it's not a slur), that's the real meaning. Someone who is cis is just someone who has the same gender identity as the one they were assigned at birth with."

Trans, from Latin, meaning ""across,"" or ""other side of,"" + gender = someone crossing the gender barrier (sex). Cis, from Latin, meaning ""this side of,"" means someone identifying as the gender assigned at birth, also known as your ""sex"" (some people may be intersex, though, so it's better to say assigned male/female at birth)."

transpositive,3d2vdj,mirandapd,2,Mon Jul 13 03:34:28 2015 UTC,"Surgery downstairs is rarer for trans men since the surgery not as good   The reason it's rarer, as far as I know, hasn't been something actually asked. I am fairly sure this is just an assumption. If I would guess, I would say it's more because of the misconception that bottom surgery for trans men is bad and all the negative talk around it. The trans community (including trans men) has a kneejerk reaction to putting it down. Among other things.  I have a theory it's also because it's easier to deal with something you lack rather than something you have too much of. (Though not for everyone.) Having something you have to actively hide every day is much more stressful, in general. Binding and tucking can cause actual pain and physical side effects where as padding and packing don't. So my theory is that it is more of a priority for trans women to have bottom surgery because it's hard to deal with that ""excess"" that is wrong, just like top surgery is often a priority for trans men because it is hard to deal with that ""excess"" that is wrong. Plus bottom surgery is tens of thousands of dollars. If quality was an issue, a lot of trans men would probably not have top surgery considering the prominent scars and the possibility of never having proper feeling return to your chest, not to mention the common loss of any erotic feeling in the nipples.   Please don't say the reason is just because it's not good. Most trans men are happy with their results. I think there are a lot more reasons why it's rarer then the quality, because it's a pretty good surgery. Besides that, I don't think we have surgeries to have ""neo-anything,"" we do it because of dysphoria and to survive with the bodies we have.  FtM thread: ""Talking about bottom surgery."""

transpositive,3csoqn,zoltan2069,3,Fri Jul 10 13:34:39 2015 UTC,"Hi all,  I know this is supposed to be ""transpositive"" but I thought I would share this video. I am  an Australian 27 mtf who just came out as trans,  have started HRT and have switched to living full time as a girl. The experience of coming out and finally being able to live as myself was the scariest and most exhilarating rush I have ever experienced. I work as a mechanical engineer in a coal power station and came out to everyone at my work. I was absolutely blown away by how accepting and loving everyone has been to me. Within a week of coming out I was walking into the power station in a work dress and using the female bathrooms. Within a week of coming out to my friends, I was at my best friends bucks party in a black dress and heels in a nite club. Within a few weeks of coming out my family I met my 89 year old grandfather for the first time dressed as a girl after staring smiling at me he told me that I looked beautiful. I feel like the luckiest girl in the world and couldn't have asked for a more positive coming out experience, particularly having gone into it knowing full well the rejection and hardship that most others have faced going through the same process. As you can imagine this time was the highest of highs  periods in my entire life.  But now months after the dust has settled and things have quietened down, I find myself in one of the worst depressions of my life. I guess the crash and burnout from the highest of highs, coupled with the gripping fear that now the genie is out of the bottle and there is no turning back has hit home. I think it needs to be recognised that depression is an illness that can affect anyone no matter how well their life is going. I would describe it not so much as being dominated by sadness and hopelessness (although very much present) but an overwhelming physical and mental fatigue coupled with an inability to perform basic functions involving planning and concentration. I recorded this video as a bit of a project to keep me motivated and it took me nearly 3 weeks to shoot and share online. The content is very shaky and heavily edited as I couldn't last very long without losing my train of thought. Never the less I am very proud that I was able to make and share this vid and I know the future will be bright.  Lots of love, Adrianne"

I replied to her message this   I love you and it breaks my heart to know that I've hurt you in any way but there is nothing you could ever say that would make me think any less of you so I'm having a hard time with you as well as other folks who just can't accept that this is my life and my choices and this is a real legitimate life path that millions of people have taken since the beginning of time.  I didn't choose to be transgender and I didn't choose to be raised in the conservative south.  Those two things were forced on me from birth.

Thank you for posting your example.  I'm planning a facebook coming-out for sometime in the future. Might be soon, might not, but it's helpful to me to think about it. I hadn't thought much about private replies, either, so this has been helpful to hear about.  My inclination in my own letter is to request that anyone who can't be supportive just go ahead and unfriend. I don't know if I have the patience to deal with people who feel the need to express disapproval of my identity. I say this because I've privately spoken with my immediate family and close friends, so I have the privilege not to worry that I will lose anyone I would be badly hurt by losing."

You won't be able to give birth, but you'll still be able to adopt (and there are enough kids in the world without parents anyway).   For right now, focus on transitioning (if you've decided you want to), and worry about those things later.   Think about it this way: Would you rather be married (and/or whatever other life events you had in mind), and unhappy as a male, or happy as a woman, but not having found Mr./Ms. Right (or whatever)?"
transpositive,3bpwzj,andynotandy,3,Wed Jul 1 10:22:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a trans girl. I'm married, and have one other growing relationship on top of that. My wife and I are poly, so don't worry my wife and the other person both know and are totally enthusiastic about it.  I also know for a fact that there are a couple other people interested in me. But either I don't feel the same, or I don't have the time and resources that would go into having a relationship with them and still maintaining my others. Or in one case, the person is a trans fetishist and just eww.  Before I transitioned, interest in me was much, much lower. I don't even think that has been a product of my getting more attractive, but through my confidence and my own self image going up by so much.  Now, I do live in a very liberal area and my experience has been better than a lot of other trans people I've talked to. But, I only have my own experience to share. Having rewarding romantic relationships is definitely possible as a trans girl."
transpositive,3bpwzj,Valicit,2,Wed Jul 1 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to play devil's advocate with you. I'm 32, married for 8 years as a man to my wife and we have a son together. I felt that same want of family and I got it. But while this is close to the dream that many aspire to, the truth is that there is no running from who you are.  It has complicated things far more than I ever could have imagined, and while my son is my everything, it makes me sad that he won't grow up with two parents that love each other (to be fair, she's still trying to make it work on a platonic level and co-raise our boy). Had I been honest about things from the get go (both with her and myself) it might have gone differently, but if you are thinking about it now, you'll almost certainly be thinking of it in 5, 10, 30 years down the road. Ultimately, it's never too late to find love and start a family, but it's important that you're happy and healthy first and foremost.  TL;DR: it's never too late to find love. Don't let that be the reason you hold back from transition."
transpositive,3bpwzj,_dEm,2,Wed Jul 1 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"I'm married to a trans woman who didn't know she was trans until very recently. I wish we had figured it out a while ago, so we could be a lot farther down the road to transition.   Like others have said, plenty of trans women get married and have most of the same goals that cis women do. If transitioning will improve your quality of life, then by all means do it! The first few steps are really tricky, and I'll admit to often being terrified, but I'll tell you this.   NOTHING has ever been as satisfying as seeing my beautiful wife walking around in public and smiling genuinely. Seeing her relaxed and having fun as herself made all of my fears and worries disappear. You can absolutely find happiness and a fulfilling relationship as a trans woman."

transpositive,3boo3q,penguin_devil,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:13:46 2015 UTC,"Head over to r/mypartneristrans for another community that might help out. PFLAG is a good resource with a lot of information, they focus pretty heavily on gay and lesbian but there is some trans support.   Personally, I like having handy information packets that I can send to coworkers, family or friends. General info about transitioning, state by state laws on trans care or inclusivity, that sort of thing. Maybe some links to positive portrayals of trans people in media, like a book/movie guide?   Good luck, let us know when you've got it up and running!"

transpositive,3bhkqx,MuffinFairy,10,Mon Jun 29 12:02:39 2015 UTC,"Kind of a crapshoot, since it basically just goes ""here's all the relevant reddit threads I could find for this video!"" But it's still better than seeing the definitely terrible youtube comments every time."
transpositive,3bhkqx,MikkelManDK,5,Mon Jun 29 12:13:36 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it depends on which subreddits have posted the video, but generally it's significantly better than youtubes notoriously bad and thoughtless comments."

transpositive,3bhkqx,PariahSilver,3,Mon Jun 29 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"I wondered that too. I thought it was going to follow the bit about suicide rates, it seemed a natural progression.  As disappointed as I am that he didn't talk about murder rates, I can't fault him for giving a wonderful presentation. Hell, he also could have talked about housing and employment, which are also terribly important. But I can't be upset, the whole thing was too positive, and we need more of that."

transpositive,3bhkqx,misanmeme,4,Mon Jun 29 13:17:55 2015 UTC,"For the most part a great video, just unfortunate that it always takes a person who isn't trans to have these things heard and that it can't be actual trans voices that have been saying the same stuff for years."
transpositive,3bhkqx,finiteteapot,5,Tue Jun 30 02:32:28 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, that's how it starts. Sucks, but it's a minority thing, not a trans thing."

transpositive,3bhkqx,finiteteapot,5,Tue Jun 30 03:10:47 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's a side effect of the basic problem. If the voices of the minority were being heard adequately, the discrimination would probably not be as bad to begin with. As frustrating and unfair as it is, we all need allies sometimes."

transpositive,3bhkqx,amcma,5,Tue Jun 30 00:03:28 2015 UTC,"I've been told by a friend that saying ""transwomen"" is offensive and to call then by their name and this video reinforces that belief. Because it is impossible to call a group of 700,000 (in the US) individuals all by their name when referring to the trans community, is saying transwomen or transmen actually offensive or was this person just trying to make me feel bad?    Sorry just looking for discussion in a trans community since the person I was talking to was a cis female"
transpositive,3bhkqx,AprilRyan8,28,Mon Jun 29 10:01:57 2015 UTC,"I think saying it is fine, but writing it I think putting it as two words is preferable. ""Trans women"" or ""transgender women"" are preferred since transgender is an adjective that describes women who happen to have been assigned a different gender at birth. ""Transwomen"" as a noun is othering. Also it's only appropriate when trans issues are involved. You wouldn't say something like ""my trans woman friend Jenna makes a rockin' guacamole"" you'd just say ""Jenna's guacamole rocks."""
transpositive,3bhkqx,amcma,14,Mon Jun 29 10:20:20 2015 UTC,"Ok cool. I'll definitely make sure to make it two words from now on as I write it, and totally agree with your example."
transpositive,3bhkqx,AmazinglyAudrey,6,Mon Jun 29 10:28:11 2015 UTC,"It's funny how much I have to adapt my own label to fit a unified front of being transgender. I've been referring to myself as a transwoman whenever I need to address an issue from the perspective of being both a woman and trans. I'd never seen the separated ""trans woman"" term until you mentioned it. Is this the accepted thing now?"
transpositive,3bhkqx,theonlyotheruser,9,Mon Jun 29 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"The way it was explained to me is that you just treat ""trans"" as an adjective describing what type of woman. You don't say ""tallwoman"" or ""newstudent"".   Unless you're speaking German."
transpositive,3bhkqx,AprilRyan8,12,Mon Jun 29 16:02:14 2015 UTC,"This pretty much explains it, and while the grammatical argument may seem arcane or silly, the point is that if we make transwoman or transman separate nouns there is an implication that transgender people are somehow set apart from others of their gender rather than it being merely a descriptive term to refer to people who share a common characteristic. Writing 'Transperson' instead of trans person or saying 'transgendered' instead of 'transgender' doesn't cross into 'offensive' in my opinion, (I'd hold back that term for truly dehumanizing slurs) just problematic."
