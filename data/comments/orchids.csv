EDIT: to answer your question, my only bet would be sphag n bag, but even then it might not work, is just matter of patience and luck."

orchids,3dmukd,Trephine_H,2,Sun Jul 19 04:33:32 2015 UTC,"Ohi, sorry for the delay, well spahg and bag is a method widely used to save orchids in precarious conditions, it basically just consists of putting your plant into a ziplock bag alongside some wet sphagnum moss, and then leaving it somewhere with enough light for a few weeks and hope for the best, it's not a guaranteed success, but in cases where there are no options left, it's a good one.   If the plant has any chance of life, it might throw some leaves or roots, if not well, each time is knowledge and experience that can help a new plant to survive."
orchids,3dmukd,Pizzacrusher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:03 2015 UTC,"probably not.

orchids,3dlare,GProteins,2,Fri Jul 17 04:49:20 2015 UTC,"Some will and some will not. I think it depends on what nursery the big box store contracts with. Some nurseries will buy back the dead / dying plants, in order to prevent the mark down of product. Other places, the garden managers just can't be bothered to go through the hassle of discounting and selling the dying plants. You just need to explore a bit and find one that does. Independant florists / garden centres might be an option too."

I have my orchids in a room with an east facing window and they seem to like it there just fine. Less is more in terms of watering. It's hard to tell what your orchid is potted in. If it's potted in moss, let the moss dry out before giving it a small drink of water again. If it's potted in bark, take the plastic cup hidden inside out and soak for 4-5 minutes once a week."

You can dab a little rubbing alcohol to the damaged spots to ensure no disease attacks them (you don't want any nasty bacteria or viruses to get ahold of them--it won't harm your plants) and keep them oriented to the sun the way they were. They'll heal and keep growing.   Good luck!

orchids,3dfryq,CookieFace,2,Wed Jul 15 22:44:02 2015 UTC,"Hard to say, but it's a cymbidium. Where I live, we pot it in amended potting soil and leave it outside and they grow like weeds. Most indoor growers use a fine bark mix of their choice. For the leave loss, it's normal after a couple years the leaves tend to brown and drop, however if it's excessive and the pseudobulbs are turning brown and mushy, it might be time for a repot and to adjust watering schedules as it may be too wet. Best to cut away the rot before it spreads to newer growth!"
orchids,3dfryq,lolpiplup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:59:21 2015 UTC,It probably does need repotted. I got it in January and it bloomed twice. Not knowing the cycle I wasn't sure to heavily fertilize or let it go dormant.  So I kinda half ass fertilized.
orchids,3dfryq,lolpiplup,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:56:44 2015 UTC,"For cymbidiums, I would go medium, heavy fertilizers while it's growing new growths. After they mature/stop growing, cut water a little; it will be around end of fall into winter time. The chill itself will probably be enough to initiate spikes, but keeping them dryer will help with the rot that sometimes happens. When spikes start and get to a good size, resume watering without fertilizer. After spiking or towards the end of the flowers in the spring, begin the fertilizing regimen all over again! A good time to repot would be right as the spikes die off and growths are a good size AND you can see new roots emerging an inch or two long."

orchids,3d8zaf,BrunetteBunny,2,Tue Jul 14 13:35:53 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew! It's mounted on a grape vine, and the roots have grown under the bark, maybe that's why? Tolumnia like to get wet in the morning and then dry out in a manner of hours- perfect for growing as a mount. I think if you honor their need for a morning watering, they're pretty tolerant of low humidity otherwise. The spanish moss I have growing all over it could also be helping to shade the roots from the sun a bit."

orchids,3d5dio,justgoodenough,3,Mon Jul 13 17:34:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use it.  The green stuff is just moss someone picked up outside.  It isn't sterile, so it will have bugs in it (your house will be filled with gnats and other fun critters that hatch out of it), and it doesn't compress well.  It will also decompose into dirt after a few months of being in the pot.    You will want AAA-grade New Zealand Sphag, or similar Chilean Sphag.    Sphag moss will dry out quickly if it's not compressed, so make sure you really cram it in there when you pot your orchid.  It also holds a lot of water, so make sure you water sparingly.  Phals like it relatively dry.  I leave about 1/4"" between the top of the moss and the top of the pot.  When I water, I just pour in enough to take it to the top of the pot (maybe less if it's winter, or if the plant isn't actively growing).  The water will soak through the moss and disperse evenly over the few hours after watering.    This is my preferred brand, but there are others.  Just look for AAA-grade on whatever you buy!"
orchids,3d5dio,logictwisted,2,Mon Jul 13 19:13:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I have a really tiny phal and it is just... not doing well. When I bought it, it was in moss, but it was too moist and the roots were starting to rot, so I swapped it for bark, but the bark dries out too quickly and even when I try to water it more often or spray it with mist, it's not getting enough water anymore and the leaves are all spongy and sad. So I think I will try combo moss and bark and see if that works.   Right now my only plants that are doing well are succulents and my method of care is to look at them while thinking about water once a week."
orchids,3d5dio,logictwisted,3,Mon Jul 13 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"I've tried the combo, and I know professional growers who use it.  Put in a bit of pearlite as well, just to add some air in.    Personally, I prefer just sphag, but pack it in tight (don't just leave it loose and fluffy!).    Sphag behaves like a sponge.  An uncompressed sponge will hold more water than a compressed sponge.  So, if you want your phal to dry out more quickly, compress the moss.  The growers in Taiwan really stuff it in there!    I also find I don't really care for those slatted orchid pots when I use moss.  The water flows out at the top of the slats leaving the plant overly wet at the top and too dry at the bottom.  Just a boring old plastic pot will work fine.  Save the slatted orchid pots for the Cattleyas.  If you mix, I would chop the sphag up a bit first (the fibers can be a bit on the long side).  Make sure you change the media after 12-18 months - the media will start to degrade into dirt, and the pH will change, causing it to 'go sour'.    Phals love to be repotted, especially into nice, fresh media after they finish blooming.  Water sparingly (if at all) for the first three weeks after you repot to give the roots a chance to heal.  When you see green tips on the roots, or new roots starting to emerge from the crown, increase the water to normal levels.  A few weeks after that, hit it with a quality orchid fertilizer to get as much growth out of the plant as possible.  This should result in a big, healthy plant that will bloom well when the temperature changes in the fall.    If you can grow your succulents, you can grow orchids.  Phals don't have water storage organs like some other orchids, so you have to keep on top of watering without over doing it.  Once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy.  I my house, a quick water about every 5-7 days is more than enough.  When you repot, don't forget to trim off any dead roots (they'll be soggy and rotten).  Good luck!"

orchids,3d2a4y,Av33na,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:11:20 2015 UTC,There's debate in the orchid world on if you should cut the stem (even when it's green) when the blooms fall off. Some say to cut right away and some let it the orchid do what it wants and only trim the brown sections. I'm not an expert at which node you should cut but I generally am of the mindset that the orchid tells me what it wants. Where it's brown I'll cut. You should visit orchidboard.com.
orchids,3d2a4y,lolpiplup,3,Mon Jul 13 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As a member of orchidboard, I've found them very helpful and extremely welcoming. There's a handful of regulars that update regularly and the beginner's section is always... interesting? Anyways, if it were up to me, I'd cut the stem to the nearest green node after the flowers have fallen away. In some cases a new bloom spike will emerge. At worst, the spike will continue to die which is probably a sign to cut the whole thing off. The cases for cutting the stems green would be if the plant is struggling from root rot or leaf loss or other maladies, cutting the spike even with flowers on it would signal the plant to start growing rather than reproducing via flower spike. The plants WILL flower themselves to death if they're in bloom for too long (1 year+)."
orchids,3d2a4y,sowon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:06:05 2015 UTC,"You can cut it at above the 3rd+ node and you have a decent chance of it putting out a secondary spike at that point. Or you can just cut the whole thing off (just above the 1st visible node) and let the plant invest all its resources into growth in anticipation of the next time it flowers (which can be months to 1/2 year or more away, if it's kept healthy).  Also, a large day/night temperature difference is a pretty surefire way of promoting blooming in most phals."
orchids,3d0eg2,EccentricEpicrates,2,Sun Jul 12 13:09:45 2015 UTC,"D. laevifolium, from the section Oxyoglossum is one of the more warmth friendly ones, and can appreciate intermediate temperatures. do keep in mind this entire section hails from highland/cloud forest environments where humidity and air flow is high, and temps seldom make it past 85F, so while D. laevifolium can tolerate warmer temps than the rest of the group, it shouldnt be pushed too far into warmth. As for a south facing window, that might be too much for it--Im growing mine on a north facing window and it seems to do just fine. the spots on your plant might be an indication that it is getting sunburned.   But to answer your questions: 1) only if warm temperatures are consistantly outside it's warmth tolerance. 85F during the day and 75F at night are what i would consider peak tolerances. 2) this orchid is not deciduous, though bulbs that have lost their leaves may continue to produce flowers. 3) i also suspect your plant is sunburnt and the leaves are not a result of a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection. i dont think it is necessary to remove the leaves, but if you do, remember to sterilize your equipment before doing so, re-sterilizing after every cut."

orchids,3cxsra,DiscoJaguar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:07:30 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would be to repot them in new orchid mix if you haven't already. This is because when you purchase orchids they usually have elements in the potting media that keeps them wetter longer. This is great for nurseries but not for you unless you're careful not to overwater and drown out the roots. Another reason to replace the potting mix is because generally you want to replace orchid media every 2-3 years or so. Potting mix deteriorates and creates oxygen deprived pockets that kill the roots. Other than that, if you have the time, I also recommend fertilizing as often as you can. For example, if the fertilizer instructions call for 1 tbs of fert/gal (just for example) per month, try fertilizing a fourth that dose every week. IMO this more closely mimics nature. Good luck, keep us updated, and welcome to our community!"
orchids,3cxsra,Photronics,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"I would repot the spectabile into fresh medium after trimming any rotted roots. Most people recommend good quality sphagnum for optimal moisture, humidity and drainage in the rootzone, the idea is to give the plant everything it needs without any of the rot. If you're truly dedicated to the spectabile rescue, you could invest in something for bottom heat like a seedling mat. It does wonders for keeping a warmer night temp and, of course, keeping the roots of your plants nice and warm!"
orchids,3cxsra,lolpiplup,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:38:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the advice! I actually have an old reptile heat mat I can jerry rig to a dimmer so it doesn't get too hot. Repot it is.

Get him a nice 5 or 6 inch pot with lots of holes for good air flow to his roots. Im sure he would love some fresh bark too. When bark is new it doesnt hold water as well though so make sure not to let him stay dry for too long.

orchids,3cvxo8,Pizzacrusher,2,Tue Jul 14 02:32:40 2015 UTC,"i've shied away from the ice cube method.  I take and soak the plant in its plastic cup in water for 5-10 mins once a week or every 10 days or so, then let it drain for a few minutes before putting it back in its decorative over-pot. some of mine I dont even put in a decorative pot, just the clear plastic one. I am told the roots can photosynthesize too, so having light shine on them doesn't hurt.  I actually use very dilute fertilizer every time I soak it"
orchids,3cvxo8,xanderono,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:47:14 2015 UTC,"Along with what /u/pizzacrusher said, a great way to tell if you should water is to stick and leave a bamboo chopstick or skewer into the centre of the moss mass. If you pull it out and it's still damp in the centre, it's doing great! Wait till tomorrow and check again since it's always better to underwater than overwater."

Place the orchid in a brightly lit spot (windowsill that receives mostly indirect light) with no direct sunlight.

orchids,3cjwm4,Cypripedium-candidum,3,Wed Jul 8 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"Has it always looked like this, or is it a new development?  Overall, while the plant looks rough, it is quite viable; howearas are pretty robust plants- the parent of that hybrid (Howeara Mini-Primi) is a classic, a very easy-to-grow plant.  Looks like someone divided up a larger plant that had been a big neglected; always look at the new growth- that's the stuff that should be looking good. If the older growths are bad but the new stuff is good, it's not really a problem- orchids ""accumulate"" damage. If the new growths look rough, then you're doing something wrong.  This is one of those plants that likes a nice, open mix- what you have is a good choice. Make certain the roots get wetted now and again, but that the medium isn't wet all the time- wet, dry, wet, dry. Some light fertilizer will help it, and a drop or two of SUPERthrive (hokey stuff, but it really does help with roots) will go a long way. If you feel like it, a spray bottle with dilute fertilizer goes a long way: rather than watering it in, just spray the roots at the base of the plant once or twice a week, just enough to wet them down. Helps with hydration and nutrient uptake without soaking the medium- reduces the risk of rot."
orchids,3cjwm4,orchid_fool,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:06:23 2015 UTC,"I think it looked a bit like this when I got it, but has gotten worse in the past few weeks. I read that Howearas like to be watered a little more often. I've only been dunking it in some water for a minute about twice a week, so maybe I should up it to 3 times a week?   I have some 2-3-2 organic orchid fertilizer but have yet to use it. I still need to pick up a spritzer from the dollar store."
orchids,3cjwm4,carbontae,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:20:33 2015 UTC,The older leaves are curlin and have some spots on them. I just got this a few weeks ago in the mail. Is this curling a sign that I'm not watering it enough? And are the spots anything to worry about?
orchids,3cjwm4,carbontae,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:15:21 2015 UTC,"check if there's rot below the base of the plant, judging from the first picture, it looks like there's some rot, and this could have been the cause to the wrinkly leaves and pseudo bulb. I have the same Howeara lava burst, my Howeara generally won't go wrinkly on the leaves, even when the pseudobulbs are extremely shriveled. Since your pseudobulbs are still plump, I'm taking a guess that the rot is not due to the lack of watering, but a bacterial infection caused during the shipment, the high temperature and humidity during the summer plus the low ventilation in the package might have caused the problem. but since there are plenty of green roots on the new growth, I wouldn't worry too much. The leaves that have rots would probably eventually die off, but no biggie since the new growth is still vigorous. I would recommend a repot just to see what is in it, and if something doesn't look right, I would suggest cutting off the flower spike, Howeara would put so much energy on the blooms, as mine kept on blooming through the fall and winter, the plump pseudobulbs ended up being very shriveled.   Your watering regime seems fine to me, just put some cinnamon powder on the rot, and just do what you normally do. keep the plant well ventilated. Again, the shrivel leaves might eventually fall off, but you got a new growth and plenty of new roots, your plant should be okay."
orchids,3cjwm4,carbontae,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:11:48 2015 UTC,"Well here's what the roots look like. I'm guessing the foam was the source of my problems. How do I proceed, since so much of the roots are rotten? There's 2 pseudobulbs, looks like the one with the flower stems and new growth is also the only one with good roots growing. Should I just cut off the good one and throw away the other?http://imgur.com/a/zzG0H"

I came back to this, as pictured.  *Incidentally I most definitely should have consulted the orchid board on what to do for the orchids before leaving on a 2 1/2 week trip. I see you, /u/GrandmaGos, gave very good advice this query just a few days ago."
orchids,3bsqd0,pinkmelody,2,Wed Jul 1 21:03:40 2015 UTC,"I have used pea gravel alone and in combination with bark and charcoal. I have never used it with peat moss or Sphagnum moss. Moss tends to rot my roots because I tend to have a heavy hand with water. Mainly, I use it for Dendrobiums that are tall and like small pots. They tend to get really tippy and the rocks add weight and stability."
orchids,3bsqd0,adrift4fun,2,Wed Jul 1 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"In my earlier days (last year) I experimented with Gritty Mix out of curiosity. My family had a bunch of dendrobium nobile NOID's that grew like weeds so I did a comparative experiment. The mix with fine bark, pea gravel (instead of granite), turface, and perlite worked well. It dries fast with good airflow and doesn't need to be replaced very often. I eventually replaced pea gravel with pumice.  As for peat moss? I grow cymbidiums in an ""orchid potting mix"" that comes in a bag. I know you're not supposed to, but here in the Bay Area it saves a ton of water and cymbidiums generally do fine in it; the exceptions I hang in a net pot with bark. Peat moss because of its particle size washes away easily and is hard to moisten after being dry. People tend to use sphagnum instead to keep moisture because it's bigger and stays put.   EDIT: Additional thoughts. Remember to have your mix ingredients to be relatively the same particle size. Otherwise smaller particles will fall and fill in the crevices between larger particles and all you'll have is a mess, waterlogged bottom and less than optimal air movement."
orchids,3bsqd0,lolpiplup,2,Thu Jul 2 00:25:37 2015 UTC,I put pea gravel in the very bottom of some of my plastic pots to help keep them from tipping over...
orchids,3bsqd0,rhapsodyknit,2,Thu Jul 2 10:46:06 2015 UTC,"No, because every time you water it--assuming that you're watering completely, whether from top or bottom, and aren't just leaving a couple of ice cubes to melt--a little bit of the peat moss will wash out the bottom of the pot. Eventually you won't have any peat moss left, just the pea stone.  In normal potting mixes, the peat moss has things like vermiculite and compost to mix with, and their small particle size helps keep the peat moss from washing out."
orchids,3brzts,Krustenkeese,9,Wed Jul 1 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"Why are you keeping it in water? That's basically asking for sudden death of an orchid. Honestly, with how cheap hybrid Phals are at the moment, I would toss it and buy another."

I immediately repotted it when I got home, but stupidly used my phal mix with some of the moss it was packed in, like a mix. I only watered it once, I filled the pot with water then drained out all the excess (or so I thought). A couple times I found the drainage tray full of water and immediately emptied it again. I had an phal before that did really well in the same pot with the same watering method, but before the bottom never filled with water. I think it was the addition of moss. Learned my lesson! Anyway, the roots are almost all empty to the touch and it's super concerning. There are two roots that I found that still have some resistance to them. I think one half died. How do I save the other?"

orchids,3boet6,mike6000,3,Tue Jun 30 21:05:58 2015 UTC,Losing flowers is very different from dying and it's a pretty common response to stresses such as being relocated to very different conditions. Was the actual interior of the car only 85F or could it have gotten warmer than that?
orchids,3boet6,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:17:12 2015 UTC,it could have certainly reached 90*F but i doubt much higher.  it was a typical hot summer day but nothing above average.

They will sometimes drop their buds and blooms under a severe change in conditions, yes. It doesn't mean they're dying, just that the plant decided to abandon ""blooming"" for the time being.  There is nothing you need to do differently for next time. I have brought home Phals in freezing winter weather, and they didn't drop their flowers. Probably leaving them in the car wasn't the best procedure, but it's not a life-threatening thing.

Black spots on leaves can be a disease, but if they're not spreading, then they're an indicator of deep unhappiness. Your plant needs every square centimeter of photosynthesizing cell surface that it can muster to fight back, so ""cutting off the leaf"" is not your solution here.

When I came home, I could easily remove the orchid from the potting media because it was still so soaked. Of course, most of the roots were rotting, so I moved it to bark and also moved it out of the light so I would not stress it out. The waxy spots were back on the leaves.

The first thing you need to do is move it to somewhere shady, whether that means putting it inside or somewhere else outside. The roots look healthy, so it has a chance to pop back I think. I would just clip the papery roots on the bottom and keep the humidity high. I've never had any of mine sunburn that bad, so I'm not sure about clipping the leaves. Some will fall off though, possibly most of them."

(these next steps I'm not too sure about because I've only done it once, but it worked for me. However, someone with more knowledge can correct this if I'm wrong.)   Put it into hibernation mode. Gradually water less with one or two generous soakings a month. Cut off the  **spike and any bit that looks like it's just going to get worse, like the dry papery bits of the leaves. You may even have to take entire leaves off, like the two that are next to each other on picture 2. Put cinnamon on the wounds to keep out infection.   You want your orchid to focus on making new foliage, not wasting energy on the bits that are on their last legs.  **If you decide to not take off the spike do not stop watering. Blooms take up a lot of energy and watering less while there are blooms can hurt the plant."

The phalaenopsis are repotted into 50/50 sphagnum moss and coarse bark, save for a few which are in 100% bark.

orchids,3agfbs,lady0navy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:03:41 2015 UTC,Here is a good resource for information:  http://www.orchidspecies.com/mashirtzii.htm  So the black at the  base of the stem is normal for that species.  Most Masdevallias like to have a lot of moisture in their medium - so they are usually kept in tightly packed moss in small terracotta pots. Looks like the plant is over-potted. It's too large and the plant is diverting energy to the roots. Also that large bark is going to drain water away and dry out too much for a Masdevallia.  It could be the plant is also very stressed from being shipped/ repotted. Going from a greenhouse environment to a home.
orchids,3agfbs,cupcake_of_DOOM,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:56:17 2015 UTC,Thank you! I didn't have any other pots when i repotted this one but I'm definitely going to buy a smaller one now. And beneath the top layer of bark it's mostly sphagnum and I have a few humidifiers around it but I'll put a bit more moss in to see how it does.
orchids,3agfbs,SolarBears,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:44:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, and I hope I'm wrong, but it looks like its on its way out. It starts with one or 2 leaves, and then you get sudden leaf drop. That's why these orchids are called the suicidal orchids. Sudden leaf drop occurs when temperatures spike, and there isn't enough humidity for the plant. They just give up and die. I had a coccinea dropping perfectly healthy green leaves, and through a change in temps I was able to keep it hanging on for another month. Accidentally left it outside during a 90F day, and it died.  Bark is not a good medium for these plants as they need to remain consistently moist. So, I hope that's sphagnum moss under the bark.   In the future I would suggest not only researching the plant before bringing it home, but also getting a hybrid. Species are notoriously difficult to care for. Hybrids are very forgiving, and can take some abuse. Next time you go to a show, talk to the vendor about the care the orchid requires, and what they would recommend would suit your environment. Don't buy from someone who is just trying to make a buck.  Edit: Oops, forgot to add what you should do in the meantime. If the plant were mine. I would get a cool pot designed to keep orchids like these cool and moist. Repot the orchid in sphagnum moss. Keep the plant evenly moist, and in a cool area of your house."

orchids,3affcj,eruru,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"That looks like a little bit of sunburn, but not bad.    Watering- Here's how I do it with good success.    1- Put a bamboo skewer in each pot and leave it there.  You will find that when  you water the plant, the skewer gets somewhat wet (duh).  2- Check the skewer every five days or so.  Eventually, the skewer will be dry to the touch on your fingers, but slightly moist if you put the skewer up to your cheek or lips  3- When the skewer is dry, but not sahara desert dry, water the plants completely with room temperature tapwater or distilled water.  You want to ""flood"" the plants where water is actually flowing out of the bottom of the pot.  4- For orchids like the ones in your care- Phalenopsis- it is very important to keep the crown of the plant as dry as possible.  They tend to trap water between the leaves and the base and rot.  Because of this, I water mine with an inexpensive condiment squeeze bottle.  I also water my phals in the morning, when water has ample time to evaporate  Otherwise, I think you're doing okay.  The sunburn isn't going to hurt anything drastically or forever."
orchids,3affcj,Sloots_and_Hoors,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:36:01 2015 UTC,Thank goodness! I was mostly just worried it was fungal or bacterial and that maybe I'd already compromised the other two as well. I'm going to be picking up skewers tonight to better gauge water intake for the rest of the time they're in my care. Thank you for the detailed advice!
orchids,3affcj,GrandmaGos,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:51:02 2015 UTC,"You have not endangered their orchids.  Fuzzy mold on the root means they're too wet. Generally the ice cube thing is once a week, not every 3 days. Person A is correct, Person B is not.  Continue with the ice cubes, but once a week. And stick a bamboo skewer down into the bark before you add more this week, to be sure it's really dry down there, and not wet. They are Phalaenopsis orchids, the #1 mass market orchid in the U.S. If you bought your mom an orchid at Kroger or Walmart for Mother's Day, you bought her one of these. Which means they're pretty bombproof. You could kill these if you poured boiling water on them from a teakettle, or took them out in the parking lot and drove over them repeatedly with your car, but they can actually go the entire 20 days without being watered at all. They might be a little wilty at the end, but they're epiphytes, and they're hardwired for feast-or-famine rainfall. Sometimes it rains in the jungle, sometimes it doesn't.  They have those leathery leaves and big fat roots for a reason--they are no stranger to drought, and Phals actually prefer to be a little on the dry side, hence the ice cube trick which makes them so popular at Walmart. They're not on the same level as succulents or cacti, of course, but neither are they fussy drama queens like Boston or maidenhair ferns. This is just a toe stub. Move it back from whatever direct sunlight you have it in. They can go 3 weeks, easily, with just the indirect ambient light from a window 6 feet away. You're not trying to get them to bloom--you're just trying to keep them alive for a short period. They stay alive much longer than this in the relative darkness of the Kroger florist shop, lit only by the industrial fluorescents far, far away.   There is a sidebar link here to Phalaenopsis care, which you can direct your friends' attention to when they return."

If it grows, your options are to cut... and cut... and cut, although you don't have much plant there to cut and have it live.  1) Water in the morning. Standing water on leaves = bad. This is how fungal spores germinate and find a nice stomata in which to insert themselves. Bacteria, too.  2) Air circulation. At high humidity, more air circulation means any water that DOES end up on the leaves will evaporate quickly.  3) Keep water out of the crown, at least until you're an expert and have ideal conditions. See #1 and #2.  4) When you fertilize, keep the solution off the leaves, particularly if you use urea-based fertilizers. The waxy cuticle of orchid leaves is too thick for them to absorb any reasonable amount of nutrients that way anyhow."

orchids,39sq9t,SolarBears,2,Sun Jun 14 13:04:40 2015 UTC,"That looks like Promix which is a water retentive mixture used by many nurseries. Cuts down on the cost of watering. When the time does come to repot, you're going to need sphagnum in the mix. This orchid is used to having a lot of water, so if you go straight to a bark only mix you'll have some shriveled bulbs. Over time you can ease the orchid into a bark only mix."

orchids,39ni47,autowikibot,2,Sat Jun 13 03:21:40 2015 UTC,"It was a fairly bright area, but they probably only received a few hours of direct light a day.  The other photo I uploaded to the comments here was in a considerably brighter spot.  It's interesting to see them thrive so well, because the soil appeared to be fairly poor quality glacial till.  I've been told that Lady Slippers need gypsum in the substrate in order to thrive, and there are huge gypsum deposits 150km to the north, so the continental ice sheets probably deposited a mass of gypsum on that spot when they retreated. The Ice Ages had a profound effect on Nova Scotia, and the results can be seen everywhere.  (and I'm not just talking about last winter!)"
orchids,39ni47,snoopychick8,2,Sat Jun 13 11:14:54 2015 UTC,"They like acidic soil; I think it was Scott Durkee at Vermont Ladyslipper Farm that figured out they could be de-flasked and watered with water acidified with apple cider vinegar to a pH of <4.0 and they'd do OK after that. People spent decades trying to figure out what it took to get them to survive transplanting, along with a lot of myth and legend about how the roots didn't like to be disturbed, so you had to move this HUGE root mass- it had nothing to do with roots being disturbed, it was just the ""native"" soil had a low pH, so they lived longer!  When that came out, it was a big surprise for me because the largest colony of acaules I have ever seen was ""perched"" on top of sandy limestone. You wouldn't expect to see a low pH, but the plants were living on very acidic duff that had accumulated over the decades; there were huckleberries, which also like low pH, so that should have been a tip-off for me but it wasn't.  The reason I ask about the light is that there's one paper where they popped up after the gypsy moth came through, and it suggests that defoliation and disruption of the canopy causes dormant acaules to pop up all of a sudden. They like more light than people think."

Do you put orchid fertilizer in your water?   How long ago did you get it? Recently repotted? Sometimes orchids get pissy when they are moved/shipped/repotted. Like When I got my  stanhopea it dropped all but one of its leafs.   For the future, I recently read something somewhere suggesting not to water recently potted orchids for a few days to give the roots a few days to heal.

I get a lot of my plants bare root and I've never had a problem before but it makes sense that that's why the leaves are dropping.   I really wanted to use a plastic basket to pot this guy in but terra cotta is the only thing I had on hand.

orchids,39cl00,carbontae,2,Thu Jun 11 14:17:03 2015 UTC,"when you watered your orchid, did you leave the water in the crown?  judging from the overall condition of this orchid, I would have to agree with orchid_fool, the chances of this orchid recovering is low, I've seen people on orchid forums who revived leaf-less orchids with only the root system remaining, however, even if that worked out, it would take at least a few years before you will see the orchid bloom again. I would personally go out and buy another one, it's common for people to kill a few orchids before becoming really good at taking care of orchids. But, reviving orchids from brink of death is always fun and rewarding! if you are still wiling to give it a go, what I can suggest is to first cut off the orchid spikes, so the plant can conserve and focus all its energy on the recovery. Then, remove all the dead roots, (the ones that feels papery and dry), dust the rotting areas and cuts with cinnamon powder, keep the orchid in high humidity, place it on top of a tray of water with pebbles, or by misting the orchid daily, or putting a ziplock bag over it, just try your best to mimic a misty rainforest environment..(you can also check out the sphag and bag method). Also, judging from the dry roots, watering once a week is not enough, especially during summer time, you should water whenever the media starts to feel dry, as phals prefer a moist environment. Hope this helps, and best of luck."

I have had great success with this type: http://www.repotme.com/orchid-potting-mix/Orchid-Mix-Cattleya.html   But all of the cattelyas and phals are also resting on a sand mix that is about 2 inches high so they get a lot of evaporated water.

If it will, what is the best ratio to use?   Also, how would you go about repotting these? Soak them first (their current medium seems pretty solid) and then trim any dead roots? Also, how do I tell which side has the newest growth so that I can put the other side against the side of the pot (that's what I do, right?)    I appreciate any help you can offer!"
orchids,398nkf,wennyn,2,Wed Jun 10 01:35:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about if you put the older growth on the side of the pot with these guys (someone please correct me if I'm wrong), but it sounds like a good idea. A way to tell the newest growth is that the freshly grown pseudobulbs will have a lighter green color. Also, those that look more plump/have fewer wrinkles are generally the newer ones.   If you're worried at all about repotting, just drop them into a bigger pot filled with a bit of your media without trimming or soaking anything. They look like they're sitting in a bit of moss so they might be more used to more water being available than they would get with bark. But all of this really depends on your watering schedule. For me, I have quite a few different kinds of orchids and I'm a bit lazy with watering, so I use a mix of 50% sphagnum moss and 50% orchid bark."

orchids,395o7x,Raviepooh,10,Tue Jun 9 12:58:13 2015 UTC,"This actually looks like clivia (Clivia miniata), not an orchid. They prefer to be super root bound, which is why there may not be a potting medium.  Have you seen any flowers on it yet?"

orchids,391z7f,SolarBears,2,Tue Jun 9 00:12:03 2015 UTC,Judging by the more oblong pseudobulbs I would say it is a Coelogyne. A flower would give you a definite genus.

orchids,391lk6,damnreccaishot,4,Mon Jun 8 16:15:33 2015 UTC,"Apparently you can overwater orchids and that can cause the roots to shrivel.  I have the same problem with a new (got it 6 mo ago) orchid.  I've had luck with the watering method detailed in the sidebar for Orchid care (Phalaenopsis Care for Beginners).  Once a week I take the pot over to the sink and run water through it for a minute or two.  This has kept the green roots healthy and it even produced another leaf.  But I'm such a noob, I probably should let the pros answer this instead.  Just thought I'd mention that watering method works and the plants leaves will shrivel if overwatered too."
orchids,391lk6,Eight43,3,Mon Jun 8 16:31:49 2015 UTC,"The air roots are completely shriveled and brown   That's because the air inside your home is dry, and the aerial roots are not getting sufficient moisture.    the roots in the soil are still green   That's because there is more humidity, and the water is held for longer periods of time so the roots get plenty of moisture to stay plump.   I also see some white moss looking things that may or may not be fungus?   Where there is decaying matter, there are fungi. Can easily be solved with removing the dead matter.  Here's what you do. Unpot the orchid and remove all media. Get some fresh media. If you like to water a lot get some large particle bark mix. The larger the particle size, the more quickly the medium will dry out. You can play around with how long the media will retain moisture by adding sphagnum (more sphagnum for more water retention, less sphagnum for less water retention). It doesn't matter what kind of medium you use if you can keep the plant moisturized and happy, but bark is the easiest to find. Make sure to soak the bark overnight, or for at least 2+ hours.  Using sterile scissors (isopropyl treated) trim all of the dead and shriveled roots. Dead roots are easy to spot because they will be mushy, brown, and when you squeeze them they give way. Firm roots are live roots.  After trimming you take your clear pot and put some soaked media down at the bottom. Place the orchid in the pot, and then gently fill in the spaces around the remaining roots with bark or sphagnum. Becuase the media has been soaked, you don't need to water the plant again until the media is almost dry.  FEEL the weight of the pot when the media is laden with water. Then feel the plant throughout the week, you'll notice it gets lighter. This is a good way to see if your plant needs water. You can also see the sphagnum in a clear pot (dark brown is wet, light brown is dry). You can also see the roots (silver is dry, green is wet). So, there are many identifiers on when you need to water.   If you have questions, I recommend watching some YouTube videos on repotting orchids. Takes the guesswork out, when you can see someone doing it in front of you."
orchids,391lk6,SolarBears,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"This is very detailed. Thank you so much for this. I might wait until it finishes blooming, like Pumma81 said because I don't want to lose flowers, but I will do this when I can.  My question now is will that fungi hurt the plant's growth if I don't remove it?"
orchids,391lk6,SolarBears,6,Tue Jun 9 01:57:13 2015 UTC,"Repotting doesnt always mean the loss of flowers. If it were my plant I'd repot, but you go with your gut. The fungi won't hurt the plant. They're just feeding on decaying matter."
orchids,391lk6,Pumma81,2,Tue Jun 9 02:09:55 2015 UTC,"I do not recomment replanting the orchid while it is blooming.  It will cause flower loss, and those flowers will take about a year before they come back. Enjoy it while you can.  I prefer bark as a media because where I live, the moss holds on to too much moisture and causes root rot.  It's ok to let orchid dry out between watering.  I probably only water my Phals every two weeks, and they are happy.  If you are really concerned about your roots, wait to repot until after blooming. SolarBears gives a good method. You are going to loose some roots because your home is not a greenhouse, and that's ok.  Your plant will adjust to your home in time, growing new leaves and roots as it finds necessary."

They often offer a small variety.  Also, since you are part of the EU you can simply order from European nurseries that have online shops. The majority of them ships Europe-wide and you won't have trouble with taxes. Shipping can be a little expensive (15-20€), so I suggest placing a large order with many plants at a nursery with a wide variety of plants."

orchids,38y3og,glowpear31,2,Sun Jun 7 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"I always allow the plant to jettison the leaves itself, pulling them off only when they're crispy brown and dead. Even a damaged leaf is capable of photosynthesizing and making a contribution, and the plant is the best judge of when it's no longer of service.  Cut off all the dead roots, pot it up in some proper orchid bark, give it medium light, fertilize it. All Phals go through a ""just a dead stick"" phase when they're recovering from trauma or from a big flush of bloom, so be patient.  Light is probably the most important thing for reblooming, along with ""not overwatering"" and ""supplying sufficient nutrients"".  What kind of light do you have it in?  If it's actively putting out new roots, it's not dying, so you can relax. There's a reason Phals are the pre-eminent mass market orchid--they're pretty bombproof."

orchids,38y3og,GrandmaGos,2,Tue Jun 9 06:52:27 2015 UTC,"""Indirect sunlight"" means don't put it directly in the blazing hot sun because it can burn.  Putting it in a window is nearly always fine, because windows tend to be a little bit underneath the eaves or overhang of the building, and usually the plant is a little bit back from the actual window, and so the sun is unable to blaze directly onto the orchid.    If it's in a bay or greenhouse window, watch to see if the leaves start getting a red tinge, because that means it's getting a lot of light. A small amount of red on the leaf edges is normal and good, but if the leaves start getting a lot of red, you want to move the orchid back from the window a little."

""Look, honey, I got this amazing piece of tree stump, and I can't just stick some Kroger florist orchids up there, I gotta have something special...""  Failing that, the cattleya if the dends are really small, also because they have more decorative leaves if there aren't any flowers yet IMO."
orchids,37vl93,GrandmaGos,1 point,Sat May 30 20:26:50 2015 UTC,Agreed. Some small dends or compact carts allowed to go nuts on top of the stumps could look convincingly tree like with time. Very cool log!
orchids,37vl93,Pabloxanibar,2,Sat May 30 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"I did something similar. Looked great for a while, but by the time the plants were really firmly attached and starting to produce spikes, it was breaking down pretty badly due to the actions of natural insect and fungal decomposers. I have had success mounting phals, dendrobiums, encyclias, and oncidiums on bark, old branches, etc. I've decided to only use really hard, insect/fungal resistant woods now, like pine heartwood that is bleached and aged. Good luck, but know that it may get punky on you in a few years and you'd have to eventually move the plants.   Another option would be to mount the plants on bark or put them in small pots, and arrange the pots/mountings on the 'tree'. You could accent with some tillandsias or spanish moss, and if the tree breaks down, no harm no foul."
orchids,37vl93,DoggoneCat,2,Sat May 30 20:48:08 2015 UTC,"You could also seal the wood first, you know."
orchids,37vl93,petit_cochon,2,Sun May 31 12:20:35 2015 UTC,"True. I'm just not sure you could seal it well enough to completely negate the effects of fungus already in the wood. That tree is riddled with woodpecker holes (The Yellow-Bellied Sapsucker, Spyraphicus varius I would guess) which means it has been open to infection for some time. Sealing it would likely extend its usefulness though. I sealed mine with a light spray seal to no effect. I could hear (on quiet nights) the chewing of wood borers, the chief spreaders of fungal spores in the wood."
orchids,37vl93,DoggoneCat,2,Sun May 31 14:25:05 2015 UTC,"Probably better used for bromiliads or wood ferns, one of which doesn't mind being moved and the other which just loves rotting wood!"
orchids,37vl93,petit_cochon,1 point,Sun May 31 15:28:41 2015 UTC,"When I made something similar, I used some very tough wood from the root of a white oak, and baked it in an oven first to kill any bacteria/fungi. It's too soon to say, but it'll definitely last longer before going punky."
orchids,37vl93,CPmanNye,1 point,Sat May 30 22:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you can get it into an oven and bake for long enough to kill any bugs in it, you can seriously curtail the action of fungus they may spread.

orchids,37vl93,only_ceremony,1 point,Sat May 30 19:44:01 2015 UTC,"If that's oak, I wouldn't use it for mounting at all. Oak breaks down very very quickly; the wood would already be breaking down by the time your orchids were established there.   If you're in the South, try looking for harder woods. Woods like cypress, cedar, magnolia, and orange are all fantastic options. Most other woods down here are too soft (like oak) or too sappy (like pine) to use for mounts.

Some people suggest it adsorbs compounds that are inhibitory to growth (mainly phenolics such as caffeic acid), but it looks like orchids don't really produce those compounds unless they're injured while in vitro. Could be that it helps darken the media, which (for some roots) helps with negative phototropism, i.e.: roots like it dark, where the moisture may be."
orchids,37oguo,Perfester,2,Sat May 30 06:10:09 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but more likely agar that is black due to being mixed with activated charcoal.  Activated charcoal is used to help keep down microbe or fungi development, also might have an effect on pH."

Phalaenopsis orchids like relatively high humidity and moderate indoor temps (65-75 degrees). An eastern or western window with dappled sunlight is good--full sun can cause sunburn to the leaves. They also have a dormant period after blooming, so you will have months during which they are concentrating their energy on growing more leaves. The bloom period is typically in the fall/winter months, although some bloom in late winter (Feb./March). Mine have just completed their blooming cycle and I'll be looking for new spikes in November/December. Keep doing what you're doing!"

orchids,37ncsv,Perfester,3,Thu May 28 22:17:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with all of those, but I am familiar with asking loved ones to water the plants for me.  You want to group them so that they're divided up into similar watering requirements.  For example:  Group 1: all the cactus and succulents. Group 2: all the African violets. Group 3: all the orchids (Phalaenopsis, Cattleyas and Dendrobium in my case).  You put them physically in these groups so they're all sitting next to each other. This means that you may have to make compromises on lighting and humidity, but remember that the end result is to keep the plants alive, not necessarily to give them optimal care and keep them in bloom.  You need to have all the pots sitting on egg crate above big plastic  trays or something, so your loved one doesn't have to futz around with emptying saucers.  Excess goes right into the tray.  Then you give your loved one explicit words of one syllable written instructions,e.g.  Water Group 1 on the First of the Month. Only. Give each plant one turkey baster squirt of plain water. [or whatever measurement you deem fit. I use turkey basters.]  Water Group 2 on Mondays. Give each plant 2 turkey baster squirts of plain water.  Water Group 3 on Tuesdays. Put 1/4 teaspoon of this fertilizer here into this clean gallon jug, fill it up with water, then give each plant 2 turkey baster squirts of it.

I make this advice because from time to time I've come to cut some ""dried"" roots that upon cut are still green inside, so they might look dead but aren't, and if you don't have more roots, cutting them might be counterproductive.  Aside from that, older pseudobulbs are used by the plant as energy reservoir, drying and dying, so they usually don't require roots anymore."

orchids,374jha,Easygrowing,1 point,Mon May 25 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"Damn, it took two years? I just picked one of these up and was hoping for a flower this year. If you don't mind me asking, but how should I care for this type? Like how much light, water, and did you repot it? Looks beautiful btw!"
orchids,37584r,wildstripe,6,Mon May 25 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"Dendrobiums actually rather like being potbound but that one looks like it's had a bit of a rough time of late. Now while it's producing a new lead is the best time to repot it because it's already sending out new roots. Cut off the back three dead canes then just get your thumbs in and break the rootball apart, open it up and cut some of them off. Try not to damage the ones on the new lead. Plenty of videos on Youtube showing you how to repot. You'll probably need to stake it for awhile until new roots take hold of the pot and the bark."
orchids,37584r,Chunkeeguy,1 point,Mon May 25 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! I've repotted orchids before, but never something that was literally a ball of roots, so I was just really unsure where to start, what to cut exactly.   Before reading this I actually cut off all the canes. Which I kind really regret cutting off that healthy one on the left. I didn't really know whether to keep it with no leaves or not. But I did it properly and stuff so. It'll be fine. :("

orchids,370u2p,Perfester,1 point,Sat May 23 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I am having difficulties adding text to my post, but I posted my question!"
orchids,370u2p,GrandmaGos,1 point,Sat May 23 21:03:38 2015 UTC,I'm having trouble posting text with this photo.   I rescued these orchids from a local Chinese restaurant last night. I think they were over-watered because I found a lot of rotted roots. I also think they were not in good light.  The blue one's leaves are starting to get droopy. One leaf has black/blue looking stain on it.  The white one looks to be in better condition.  Both plants has flowers that are about to expire. My question is what are my next steps? I have cut off the rotten roots and I didn't water it because I want it to dry out a little. What should I do once the flowers have fallen off?
orchids,370u2p,GrandmaGos,2,Sat May 23 21:00:42 2015 UTC,"Did you repot it, or when you say you cut off all the rotted roots, you simply cut off the rotted surface roots?  The blue stain is the remnants of the food coloring that is used at the production facility to make it the gorgeous bright blue color you see on the orchids at Kroger and Walmart. It's an underlying white orchid, which you'll see when it reblooms."
orchids,370u2p,Nazrath2112,1 point,Sun May 24 11:50:58 2015 UTC,"I cut off everything I could reach. There are two plants in one planter for the white one, I tried to take the whole thing out, but it's pretty tight in there. Probably not good for the orchid, but I didn't want to damage anything by taking it out."

orchids,36vlro,snoopychick8,1 point,Fri May 22 14:36:20 2015 UTC,"I grow everything intermediate. I recently moved and all my plants are stressed from being in a greenhouse to now living in a south facing sunroom/grow room. It is consistently moist and grown extremely humid (80-95%) temps vary in summer from 15 low to 28 high and winter 12 low to 19 High, however I do dip it lower occasionally for my Coelogyne orchids. This recent winter my greenhouse dipped to 3c due to a furnace failure. Everything seems to have recovered just fine!"
orchids,36vs17,HowAmIEvenAlive,1 point,Fri May 22 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"Can you take a picture of your potting mix? If it has a lot of small particulates (small bark pieces, peat moss, etc.) then it might be too dense to allow proper air flow. You want a super coarse bark mix.  Pictures of your orchids would be helpful as well. My guess is that your mix is too dense and is causing root rot. The wrinkliness of the leaves might suggest that there aren't any roots left to allow the plant to take up water.   Did you repot your first set of orchids?"
orchids,36vs17,stopthebefts,1 point,Fri May 22 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! In my opinion, my mix is pretty coarse. There are a lot of spaces between roots. Its Better-Gro Phal mix. It says ""coarse peat"".   Anyway, here are the two first ones I got, never had any problems with either other than no new flower shoots on the one.   Here's the first one, Flowers are falling off, but the leaves still look healthy and are holding themselves up nicely.  Here's number two, flowers still look nice BUT smallest leaf is turning yellow and theres a yellow spot on the ones above it so now I'm freaking out a little :( Really don't want this one to die. The flowers are so heavy they're pulling the plant to the side though, I hope that won't hurt it.  Thanks for the reply!"
orchids,36vs17,GrandmaGos,2,Fri May 22 20:11:44 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at pictures of two happy and healthy phals, and I'm not understanding the problem.   I'm not seeing a smallest leaf that is turning yellow. Do you mean an emerging new leaf, or an old leaf?"
orchids,36vs17,jddavies,1 point,Sat May 23 13:19:04 2015 UTC,Phals need a temperature drop to induce flowering.  Put them in a porch or some other room that gets down to about 50°F for a few days.
orchids,36vs17,GrandmaGos,1 point,Sun May 24 10:05:23 2015 UTC,Just to clarify for the OP:  A winter chill zap can help if your orchids are normally living at warm temperatures.  I've had mine for several years now in a basement that holds steady in the upper 60s and they bloom year-round without needing any chill period.

I had a ""wild cat"" orchid (I think it is dendrobium?) and it had a horrible stench. I loved the blooms until I got too close to the smelly plant....I had to move it out of the way. I was sad when the smelly think died though! :( I find a lot of the orchids that are super exotic looking or pretty actually smell gross. I love to look at them but they smell awful!"

orchids,36qgvx,NiftyShadesOfGray,2,Thu May 21 08:48:40 2015 UTC,What kind of potting medium is it living in? Is there a drainage hole in that pot? Are those pebbles on top of the soil? What kind of fertilizing have you been doing?
orchids,36qgvx,GrandmaGos,1 point,Thu May 21 12:56:04 2015 UTC,"It sits on a ball of moss and is planted in little porous rocky things that are supposed to keep moisture in and give it off slowly. There's also some bark. I used a special orchid fertilizer(at least that's what it says on the bottle).  I kept it in pretty much the same conditions for nearly 2 years. Same spot and same watering habits, but now I feel like it deteriorates. It sits on an east facing windows sill and gets a like 3 to 4 hours of pretty light morning sun."
orchids,36qgvx,GrandmaGos,2,Thu May 21 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"Is there a drainage hole in the bottom of the pot?  I would repot it into straight-up orchid bark medium, as the most logical thing to try, and because I know that my Phals do beautifully in it."
orchids,36qgvx,GrandmaGos,1 point,Thu May 21 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"Nope, no drainage. But I took care not to over-saturate the medium - which is probably why I didn't water enough as it seems. My mother keeps her orchids the same way, though, and hers are doing great.  I'll try to get some orchid bark medium and repot it after the bloom is over."
orchids,36qgvx,GrandmaGos,2,Thu May 21 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"And, this time definitely put it into a pot with a hole in the bottom. Excellent drainage is non-negotiable for orchids. Root rot kills them faster than anything. You may as well eliminate one possible source of problems as long as you're repotting."
orchids,36qgvx,succulentsnthangs,1 point,Thu May 21 18:59:30 2015 UTC,What would root rot look like?
orchids,36qgvx,Rain12913,2,Thu May 21 19:04:37 2015 UTC,"The leaves will wilt inexplicably, and when you slide the plant out of the pot, the roots will be brown and bad-looking, not white and normal."
orchids,36qgvx,jojofroyo,1 point,Thu May 21 19:07:46 2015 UTC,"There's some old and dried up roots there, but also plenty that are yellow and firm. Some have black spots at the tips though.  Edit: Well, apparantly it's a reaction to toxic medium...I think I should repot asap..."
orchids,36qgvx,Roren_Marquis,2,Thu May 21 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"If there's no drainage, it might be a reaction to buildup from the fertilizer and water."
orchids,36qgvx,GrandmaGos,1 point,Thu May 21 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"There isn't a drainage hole in that pot?  If not, then that's your problem.  Orchids need drainage."
orchids,36qgvx,Roren_Marquis,2,Sun Jun 7 03:50:06 2015 UTC,"Changing seasons sometimes require changing watering patterns to deal with environmental effects.   What I'm saying, water more often with less water.   Phals can handle so many leaves at such and such humidity only. If you go below that point it starts killing them.   But it could be a root issue from overwatering too, I dont really think that though, since the same thing happened to mine.   Edit: I looked again and noticed that since its planted in moss and looks like that, you must be way under-watering it. Pull the plastic pot with the orchid out of the outer pot and soak it in water for like an hour. Let it drain for another hour and then put it back. Then switch over to watering weekly or so. The moss shouldn't be soaking, but you shouldn't let it get bone dry either at least during the summer.   Edit 2. Don't water aerial roots. Only pour water on the potting media."
orchids,36qgvx,jojofroyo,2,Thu May 21 13:56:11 2015 UTC,"Just a question, why should you water the aerial roots? I water mine all the time. Am I doing something wrong?"
orchids,36p9hq,mrssweetpea,3,Thu May 21 01:14:52 2015 UTC,"That's beautiful! If I'm not mistaken it's a dockrillia wassellii.     I recently got a dockrillia linguiformis, along with a couple of other miniatures and I'm looking forward to get them to flower for me."

orchids,36pgpf,B73W,3,Thu May 21 02:10:44 2015 UTC,"I would take the whole container apart to see how the orchid is planted as well.  Your other plants are succulents and would like to be in well drained soil.  Water them well and then leave them alone until a finger stuck in the soil comes out dry (then water them again).  Your orchid might be in spag. moss and need to be repotted in orchid medium, also in a pot that drains."
orchids,36pgpf,mrssweetpea,2,Thu May 21 02:21:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  I'll give it a go this weekend!
orchids,36mt59,Katers1226,2,Wed May 20 15:13:47 2015 UTC,That could just be the reddish tinge that some leaves get. Post pictures.
orchids,36mt59,GrandmaGos,1 point,Wed May 20 15:31:04 2015 UTC,"Are they brownish and mushy like rotting vegtables? Do they smell bad? That could be a sign of bacteria infection. Bacteria will attack if the medium has been kept too wet and you have rot going on. If the leaves a brown and dry, it could be die off from the orchid adjusting to a new environment. It could also be the plant was kept a little too dry or cold or wet before you bought it. Start with watering once a week. If the moss still seems wet, then wait longer between waterings. If it is in a decorative pot without drainage, take it out and water over a sink. Let it drain and then place back in the pot. You might find it takes 10-14 days before the moss feel dry."
orchids,36kg87,joey1886,1 point,Wed May 20 01:15:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe it will, maybe it wont.   Yes, that is a new pbulb, new bulbs usually sprout like that; two leaves, some will keep two leaves, some just one, it's up to species and such.   In this case this just indicates it's a new growth, but to answer your questions, new pbulbs do tend to be the ones that spike, so it might put up a flower if you treat her good.  That depends on the shape of the plant, if its been reppoted, and a lot of factors, but if its putting new growth it will probably flower soon."
orchids,36kg87,Trephine_H,1 point,Wed May 20 06:11:25 2015 UTC,Ok thanks for the info. I purchased some divisions from eBay. I just recently built a vivarium so I mounted them all on tree fern plaques and put them in there. All 3 have new growth and are putting on a Ton of roots. I have more bulbos  but I've never seen a new growth with 2 leaves. They seem happy so I'll just keep doing what I'm doing. Thanks again!
orchids,36goh4,A999,1 point,Tue May 19 06:33:49 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming since it's grown on a tree fern mount, that the roots have probably grown into the tree fern, and would be difficult to extricate without causing major damage. If you want to grow it in a pot, you can just stick the whole mount into a pot. Why do you want to grow it in a pot instead of on a mount anyway? Cattleyas typically prefer mount culture over pot culture."
orchids,36fqgf,sobestruddle,3,Tue May 19 01:06:06 2015 UTC,All is not lost. (1) good call moving it out of the direct sunlight - that leaf is sunburned. It will fall off but won't kill the whole plant. (2) flowers fall off when they're old or the plant is stressed - nothing you can do about it now (3) looks like your plant isn't getting sufficient drainage - transplant to a pot with much better drainaige and some looser potting mix (especially if you like to water frequently). Good luck!
orchids,36fqgf,Owl_ist_Eule,1 point,Tue May 19 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"Okay thank you sooooo much!!!! Don't they sell orchid specific soil? If they do, would you recommend it? Thanks again :)"
orchids,36fqgf,Owl_ist_Eule,2,Tue May 19 02:32:04 2015 UTC,"For this type of orchid, the standard ""Orchid Mix"" from your nearest nursery/Home Depot will work just fine! Should be a mix of wood chips and rocks. And make sure the pot is just barely big enough to fit the roots. Orchids hate being in spacious pots."
orchids,36fqgf,Miuface,1 point,Tue May 19 03:09:04 2015 UTC,"Phalaenopsis don't do well in soil.  Look for an orchid potting mix.  It'll be mainly composed of bark chunks.   there's this weird looking thing growing on the top of the pot   It's hard to make out details in the pics.  If it's an exposed root, that's okay.  Phals do that."
orchids,36fqgf,stopthebefts,1 point,Tue May 19 03:03:15 2015 UTC,"NOT Miracle Gro Orchid Mix! It's composed of a mixture of peat moss and coarse chunks that suffocated a few of my babies. You might get away with using Miracle Gro Orchid Mix - Coarse, but I prefer Better Gro Orchid Mix, which is recommended by the American Orchid Society.   You won't need to find a bigger plastic pot, but you might want to poke a couple more holes all around it for better drainage. There's lots of great videos on Youtube on how to repot orchids if you need tips. Store-bought phals are usually tightly packed in sphagnum moss, so be gentle,  While you're at the store you might also consider picking up some orchid fertilizer. Most growers feed weakly, weekly (or, 1/2 the recommended dosage every time you soak your orchid). Avoid food ""spikes"" as they don't feed evenly and are typically more expensive."
orchids,36fqgf,GrandmaGos,1 point,Tue May 19 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"NOT Miracle Gro Orchid Mix!    Shout out for this. I once needed to repot something but was out of mix, and didn't want to drive all the way to Lowes or Menards for ""real"" orchid mix, so I settled for some Miracle Gro at Walmart. I got it home, and I was like, wait what? It was peat moss, with some bark.   So I googled more about orchid mixes, and settled for diluting it 1:1 with perlite, which fortunately I had plenty of.    So every time I watered the ones that got the Miracle Gro, more of the peat moss washed out of it, whether I was doing bucket-soak or top-water. So after a while they were basically in what amounted to normal orchid bark, with perlite.  So, not only was it an inferior product, but also half of what I paid for got washed down the drain.  So it was lose-lose.   I may add the remainder of the bag to the compost pile."
orchids,36ebwt,clearlyjoyful,2,Mon May 18 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your first orchid! Can you show more pictures of the leaves, roots, possibly the media?"

I'm not at all experienced with any type of plants, so I'm not sure how much disturbance the plants can take without experiencing... stress, I guess?  Roots  Leaves  Roots again  I'm not entirely sure what media is in there right now... like I said, not well-versed in the first place, lol!"
orchids,36ebwt,stopthebefts,3,Mon May 18 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"Like most grocery store orchids it is in sphagnum moss, which holds moisture very well. You can choose to repot it now or later; I typically favor repotting after the blooms have faded as long as there's no significant rot. Because the moss is tightly packed to better hold shape during shipping, you'll want to be conservative with watering. Unfortunately the pot your orchid is in is opaque; I tend to favor clear pots so you can see how dry your media gets and how healthy your roots are."
orchids,36ebwt,vettechmb,1 point,Tue May 19 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"Good to know! I did choose to repot it (and hopefully it works out okay!) and there were lots of dead roots underneath when I peeled away the moss... I repotted it last night and took it to work and it seems to be faring okay, but I guess only time will tell!"
orchids,36ebwt,GrandmaGos,2,Tue May 19 23:37:15 2015 UTC,"Don't pot while it is in bloom! You will lose all of your flowers. Try to give it the same amount of light it was given before and don't move it. They are pretty temperamental when they are blooming.   Edit: just saw the roots. Looks like it has been over watered, which is easy to do with sphagnum peat moss. I would hold off on watering for at least 7-10 days. The striations on the leaves make me think that the roots have been over watered as well."
orchids,36ebwt,vettechmb,3,Mon May 18 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"Don't pot while it is in bloom! You will lose all of your flowers. Try to give it the same amount of light it was given before and don't move it. They are pretty temperamental when they are blooming. Beautiful orchid!   I would have to disagree with this very strongly. I'm normally the Great Plant Killer--if anything requires more than cursory attention, it's soon in the trash can, brown and withered. I'm the person who can't keep Boston ferns, pileas, peperomias, or rex begonias alive for more than a month or two. Even pothos and philodendrons find it difficult to survive at my house.  And I've had a basement full of Phalaenopsis orchids for a couple years now, and not only do they not lose their flowers when you change their light around--when I water them, they sit on the basement floor to drain, and then they get put back on their shelves in purely haphazard order, so nobody ever gets the same lighting twice--but I have also ruthlessly banged them in and out of pots without losing a single blossoming experience. I have even dunked newly purchased phals in a bucket of water in order to patiently tease away the moss from around their roots, and they've gone straight into their bark and have continued blooming, no problem.  So possibly you misread what kind of orchid the OP has? Because Phals are tough as old boot leather. I'm the living proof of that.  There's a reason they're currently the mass market orchid of choice. If they were dainty princesses, they wouldn't be ubiquitous at Walmart and Kroger, and they wouldn't perform so spectacularly when rescued as $1 clearance specials."
orchids,36ebwt,GrandmaGos,1 point,Mon May 18 21:17:00 2015 UTC,"I certainly did not misread what kind of orchid OP has. Not sure why my comment warranted such snark.

The trouble with communicating on the internet via pixels is that you don't have any visual cues to help you assess the other person's mood and delivery, so it's very easy to read emotions into a post that were never intended to be there. Please try reading my post again, but without any sarcasm or snark in it, just a simple disagreement.  :)  There is ""what the books tell you"" and there is ""what works in real life"". The books tell you, ""Never repot when flowering"" and real life tells you ""You can repot when flowering""."

orchids,36ebwt,moorlock666,2,Mon May 18 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Just a general FYI, it's potted in sphagnum moss, not sphagnum peat moss. Sphagnum moss is the living bits growing on top, whereas peat moss is the dead material underneath. Sphagnum moss on left, peat moss on right. I would make this distinction because most orchids can't breathe in peat moss, which is often too dense and similar to soil (actually makes up a lot of bagged soil mixes), but will do fine in sphagnum moss."
orchids,36f4ec,losernameamirite,1 point,Mon May 18 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I snipped my orchid back in september, but instead of doing it two nodes from the bottom, I did two nodes from the top. Now, that green thing in the photo is growing from the top of the stalk itself. Is this a new ""branch"" that will flower? Does the orchid need special food? It's a standard philaenopsis in case that means anything specific for these answers."
orchids,36f4ec,stopthebefts,8,Mon May 18 22:14:13 2015 UTC,"This is a new branch that will flower! Your orchid is fine. Water and fertilize as usual (weekly, weakly with orchid fertilizer is what most do).   The two nodes from the bottom thing is a guideline, not a rule. Some phalaenopsis can grow another spike from the uppermost node, as yours has. It is simply more aesthetically appealing to have the spike coming in from a lower node as opposed to a higher one.   Another tip regarding future spikes: they will grow towards light. If you want a dramatic waterfall effect, it's better to just leave the plant in the same position as the spike grows. As you can see, your spike had to spend extra energy to twist around the existing spike to grow towards the light from the window."

orchids,36c4m3,logictwisted,2,Mon May 18 04:50:50 2015 UTC,"Hey- didn't see this question when it first came up.  No roots is definitely not a good sign on a phrag or a paph, but it's not always a death sentence. If you have rooting powder, it might help it throw some new roots, or maybe not; subfamily Cypripedioideae doesn't always respond to hormones like other orchids do. But it couldn't hurt. If you don't have any, send me a pm with your address and I can send you a bit.  Tough to go wrong with sphagnum- nothing inhibits bacterial growth quite so well as sphagnum. The trick is to keep it just damp enough to promote roots, keep the humidity high enough to keep the plantlet from drying out, and hope for roots!"
orchids,36c4m3,orchid_fool,1 point,Sun May 24 00:49:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks - I can get rooting hormone locally.  Not sure if I'll bother trying it, though.  I've done the plastic bag with sphag trick with other orchids, and honestly, didn't have the best luck with them (they were some bare root plants from Ecuagenera).  I'll try again and see how it goes.  Might give the cutting to a friend with a greenhouse and let her put it under a fogger or something and see what that does.  Nice thing is the parent plant was very healthy when I repotted it, and it's got two new crowns coming up."

orchids,365ml3,thedavidbjorn1,2,Sat May 16 16:41:41 2015 UTC,When is the last time you repotted it? Can you repot it and take a look at the inner roots and make sure they don't have root rot?
orchids,365ml3,Owl_ist_Eule,1 point,Sat May 16 16:05:59 2015 UTC,"It's definitely been awhile but worth pulling out and looking at the roots. If they are rotted, do I just snip them off?"

orchids,365ml3,moorlock666,1 point,Sat May 16 21:28:59 2015 UTC,Ok that's what I'll do then. I normally water once a week and always make sure it gets drained but will start doing it twice a week.

orchids,35zfet,clementine416,1 point,Thu May 14 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"Yes you will definitely want to check out the roots and repot it. You most likely have a lot of rotted roots that aren't able to absorb water. Repotting might make the flowers die, but the whole plant will be more likely to die the longer you wait! I would remove all the moss, cut off all dead roots (any that are black or squishy), and repot. I've heard that when switching from moss to a bark mix, it's best to still use a little moss (New moss, not the old stuff!) around the roots so it's not too drastic of a change. And then when you repot next year you can use all bark. I don't usually use bark mix myself though so I'm not much of an expert on that, although I have used mixes from repotme.com in the past and I think they are great. Hope this helps!"
orchids,35zfet,leannerae,1 point,Thu May 14 20:54:59 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I have always used the ""bucket and swish"" method to remove all the moss from around my mass market clearance orchids (Phals, one Dendrobium, a bunch of Cattleyas) because a thing I know about myself is that I'm a congenital overwaterer, so no moss for my orchids, and have simply dropped them into pots full of bark, and they're all doing well.  The thing I like about orchids is that the mass market species are great survivors, and apparently can take anything I can throw at them. :D"

I'm usually an orchid killer :( my boyfriend bought this for me two years ago and it flowered for the full two years. I let my boyfriends dad take care of it because I didn't want to kill it. We recently broke up so when I got my orchid back the poor thing was infested with these.  http://imgur.com/nAtivI9    I cut the spike and the leaves, washed it. Soaked it in physan and root hormone and repot it.  http://imgur.com/ntbxZJH    It looked like it was on the road to recovery but now something it attacking it again.

orchids,35xz43,bergskey,1 point,Thu May 14 13:25:54 2015 UTC,"They just don't look good. I'm not sure if this is normal or if something is wrong. The weather here has been really odd, fluctuating between 65 and 85 in the last two weeks. They get indirect sunlight and I soak them in water 5 minutes once a week."
orchids,35xz43,jojofroyo,3,Thu May 14 13:27:08 2015 UTC,Looks like they're getting wet than drying out really fast. What's your average humidity? You might wanna try splashing a little water on them between your big waterings.   With my orchids during the summer (I soak weekly for 30 minutes the rest of the year) I switched to pouring a little water directly into the pot every other day since its drying out so quick since I live in a desert.   But yours doesn't look to be in danger of dying anytime soon. I bet you could stick to doing what you've been doing and even if those roots die back the plant will still be fine. It looks very healthy.
orchids,35xz43,anitalready,1 point,Thu May 14 14:21:08 2015 UTC,"Getting wet and then drying really fast - is this why my roots have brown and black stains like OP?

orchids,35wihk,succulentsnthangs,3,Thu May 14 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"""Easy"" depends on your conditions and set up.  Usually, Paphiopedilum and Oncidium hybrids are considered easy.  The first is low light and can be moister because of their terrestrial nature. Oncs like more freely draining media but also more light.   Both are pretty easy to get too.  I would consider Maxillariella (Maxillaria) tenuifolia to be pretty good too and Brassovola nodosa.  Neither have big, flashy flowers but both are pleasantly scented.  Both take more light than Phals though."
orchids,35wihk,Miuface,1 point,Thu May 14 04:52:25 2015 UTC,"Paphiopedlium is a very easy grower, but my experience with these is that they are very slow growers. Dendrobium are good too, I would branch out to dendrobium/phalaenopsis as your next orchid. Dendrobium nobile might be tough because they require a winter rest. But I echo everyone else, just do your research and buy one that fits your living arrangements (light, humidity, space)"
orchids,35wihk,Av33na,1 point,Thu May 14 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"Brassovola nodosa are really easy, and while they do take more light, I had one bloom under a ordinary 20w florescent growlight as it's only lightsource. The flowers are simple but I still find them flashy, and the vanilla scent is intense, but only after the lights go out."

orchids,35wihk,GrandmaGos,1 point,Thu May 14 12:53:25 2015 UTC,"Dendrobium nobile hybrids are something I can recommend, they can take more sun and water than phals but are overall hardy and have beautiful flowers. Plus they grow super fast.  Multi-species hybrids are also often easy to maintain. They might need some more water though.   Cattleyas need a lot of sun and they also like to dry out between waterings, so all in all they do not need much care."
orchids,35wihk,NightCiel,1 point,Sat May 16 12:14:31 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of hybrid Epidendrums that have done surprisingly well in my low humidity house.  They can get tall, however.  Also, some of the Cattleya intergenerics can be fun too (I've had lots of luck with Potinara).  They're more forgiving from the species varieties, and some can be much more compact too.    Also try Phragmipedium.  Grow them under light using the semi-hydroponic method (read: put them in clay pellets and then set them in a bucket of water) and they'll go nuts.  I live in a northern city, so I grow under artificial light - it's greatly expanded the types of plants I can grow.  I just have to make sure that I get plants that can tolerate the low humidity of my house.  So, no Vandas and such for me."

orchids,35vehe,Silvialikethecar,1 point,Thu May 14 02:38:46 2015 UTC,It was very dehydrated with very little roots. I neglected it for quite sometime thinking it was dead due to overwatering. As time went on i realized this plant was a lot tougher than i'd imagined.  First I put it in  a ziploc bag elevated above about one inch of water to raise the humidity and sprayed the roots with water daily. This lasted about a month with no drastic change. Then i wrapped what roots it had left in sphagnum and watered about as often it took for the moss to dry out which was about every two or three days. This lasted only another month I grew tired of having a bag of water on my desk so I found a terracotta pot and went straight sphagnum. THIS is what really made the difference as time went on the leaves plumped and firmed up. Months passed until new roots and leaves began growing along with the spike it has now. /u/Silvialikethecar   Here is a closer view of the color

I'm having a hard time getting it to stay up in the bark chips since I switched over from the sphagnum I bought it in :/
orchids,3528df,Miuface,2,Fri May 8 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, when you repot, you need to make sure that the bark bits get into the spaces between the roots.  Some people use makeshift tampers or thick dowels to push the bark in.  You're not trying to shake it down since than would just sort the smaller bits to the bottom.    The stake needs to brace itself in the firmed up potting media.  You generally train the spike on the stake when it's still young and somewhat bendy.  You can very gently and slowly curve older parts of the spike but risky.  Clips are okay for most Phal spikes but I use solid core wire for the thicker ones."
orchids,3528df,sowon,2,Fri May 8 01:44:18 2015 UTC,"A rule of thumb (I have no idea if it's valid but I do it anyways) is that aerial roots should stay in the air and the medium roots should stay in the medium when you repot.  It sounds like you're not being aggressive enough repotting. It's OK to be a little rough when you pack the orchid in, because it is crucial that it's nice and snug in the new pot. If the orchid is loose or wiggly at all, it's going to have a difficult time establishing and that'll retard its growth or even harm it. It's also sorta ugly if it's leaning or lopsided or whatnot.  The media should come right up to the base of the stem. Also, avoid watering for about a week or so after repotting so you give any root injury it might've suffered during handling a chance to scab over and not rot."
orchids,3528df,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Thu May 7 01:43:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!! I repotted it this morning and made sure to be more aggressive with it. Wish me luck!
orchids,34zsf9,moonpurr,3,Tue May 5 22:34:28 2015 UTC,Six dollars and you only bought one?  You have more self-control than me.
orchids,34zsf9,Miuface,2,Tue May 5 23:27:00 2015 UTC,My SO is holding firm that I have to start planting all of the orchids I've been collecting and gifted to free up space for woodcarving. Then continue buying them.   He says there should be a television show about plant hoarders so he can nominate me. ;) I can't help it. I adore orchids and unique plants.   Looks like I'm on a mission to mount some orchids to trees and fern stumps.
orchids,34zsf9,Miuface,2,Tue May 5 23:46:26 2015 UTC,It looks beautiful!  Thanks for sharing!
orchids,35075a,pickledrabbit,3,Wed May 6 00:40:15 2015 UTC,"Whoops.  Put it in a reasonably small plastic pot, and put THAT in the ground. Contain as much of the existing soil as you can within that plastic pot. If you wish to move it later, it means not having to dig it up and further damage the roots.  I don't know how susceptible these things are to deer and rabbits, but you might consider a chickenwire cage to protect it."
orchids,35075a,orchid_fool,1 point,Wed May 6 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, this I can do. Thank you. I imagine, based on the small amount of soil I got with it that it was near a pine of some sort. I've read that Calypsos are dependent on trees for their nutrition so I assume I should plant it near a tree, but all I have is a holly and some plums (nothing coniferous at all on my property). Any thoughts?"
orchids,35075a,mattintrees,1 point,Wed May 6 06:31:51 2015 UTC,They are dependent on trees perhaps because the fungi they partner with also gain nutrients from trees. I know Calypsos have green parts but I am not sure how much photosynthate that provides the plant by itself. Considering how touchy Calypsos can be I would say it isn't enough by itself. The issue is that it can't be just any old tree. Orchids can be quite specific about the fungi they will partner with and most yard settings are simply too degraded to contain the right species of fungi. Your best bet is to do as orchid_fool recommended and pamper the heck out of it. You may even want to pick up some orchid fertilizer and water it with that for a while to supply nutrients to make up for missing fungi. Best of luck!

orchids,35075a,GregTJ,1 point,Wed May 6 18:41:57 2015 UTC,I would also possibly look to mulch with pine litter. You might be able to encourage fungal growth
orchids,34w7lk,jamiethemime,2,Tue May 5 01:49:07 2015 UTC,Update when it blooms!
orchids,34w7lk,Silvialikethecar,1 point,Tue May 5 21:55:05 2015 UTC,Will do!
orchids,34w7lk,accioalife,1 point,Tue May 5 23:14:21 2015 UTC,Looks great!

orchids,34wl0c,thebrightesttimeline,1 point,Tue May 5 03:48:56 2015 UTC,Most orchids produce sugars like this to some extent. Nothing to worry about apart from its attractiveness to ants and in some climates mould growth.
orchids,34wl0c,Chunkeeguy,1 point,Tue May 5 04:44:55 2015 UTC,"Thank goodness, I was worried they were infested too."
orchids,34wl0c,panterran,1 point,Wed May 6 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, orchids do this all the time.  You can actually taste the sap.  With the more fragrant orchids, you can actually taste what the open flowers smell like."
orchids,34wl0c,xTETSUOx,1 point,Tue May 5 05:31:35 2015 UTC,I might have to try that
orchids,34wl0c,NukeAndPave,1 point,Wed May 6 02:04:53 2015 UTC,"This is not uncommon.  The worst types of orchids to make these droplets are the oncidiums.  Every time one of my oncs put out a flower spike, the surrounding floor becomes sticky due to these sugar droplets and scales come out of the woodwork to feed.  You can wipe the droplets off and kill the scales by using a cotton ball dabbed in isopropyl alcohol."
