policeporn,3dm2h3,ThePlanckConstant,7,Fri Jul 17 12:47:43 2015 UTC,A camera just has way more room for optics than a rifle scope too. The scope is pretty much as good as it can get for being of that size.
policeporn,3dm2h3,unfickwuthable,3,Fri Jul 17 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. You have to think about the sensor size as well. CCD chips in video cameras are much smaller, and require a smaller area of magnification vs an eye and its required optics"
policeporn,3dm2h3,JonasIsAwesome,10,Fri Jul 17 17:05:06 2015 UTC,"Probably easier to gain an overview using the camera. I've never looked down a scope, but I'd image having a pretty narrow view in it, compared to the camera? I don't really know..."

Rifle scopes for military/police want to maintain decent field of view, so often don't have magnification over 10x, sometimes 25x. The camera likely has much more.  The quality of optics that you can fit in a camera are much better, since it doesn't get smashed around by recoil, and has MUCH more room for lenses, and likely an objective lens 2x as big."

policeporn,3ckbub,Ex1DJ4Sw7Qg1CZeiBfW5,10,Wed Jul 8 22:28:11 2015 UTC,"It's an LMT assault rifle, most likely the CQB 10.5 SBR with custom rifle butt and an EOTech sight. A lot of police units in the UK are using this rifle, or variations, and I believe they were ordered by the Ministry of Defence as a bulk buy, so similar rifles are likely in service with UKSF.  The yellow paint is either for identification, visibility or training purposes. They're police so I doubt they're trying to remain hidden or concealed."

PORS also carry their Glocks in the tradition hip holster whereas the TOU bloke has it on his vest.

Even without the tent I'd hardly classify him as non-Westerner since his approach is less streamlined than Westerners. Which doesn't mean it's bad or wrong, it's just a different approach."

The UK has had ANPR for years and all Dutch marked police cars also have ANPR. As does our Royal Constabulary in their unmarked cars, which is tasked with border protection and border traffic control."
policeporn,3amlvt,SmugBuster2012,-2,Mon Jun 22 14:30:01 2015 UTC,"Like I said before, it probably is the first in Western Europe because it is a new generation which probably works faster and better.

policeporn,3amlvt,rythmicbread,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I've got to disagree. Neither the article nor the video suggest anything to support your statements. The article only states that those cameras are going to be used in the same manner that ANPR cameras are currently being used. Just the fact that they might have a higher processing rate doesn't make such a system unique to Western Europe. We've been using these cameras for years.   Ever driven over the E34, E25, E19 or E314? As you pass the border you're driving past fixed position ANPR cameras that do exactly what the article and video say your new cameras on that car will be able to do. (Edit: Note the linked article is from 2013.)   If you've ever driven over one of the smaller roads between Belgium and The Netherlands or Germany and The Netherlands, chances are you've driven past mobile ANPR positions without even realising it. This VW Golf is fitted with ANPR for instance.   Since you're Belgian, and linked a Dutch source, here's the internal ANPR briefing of the Dutch National Police, back when it was still the KLPD. As such this document is a couple of years old, but it gives you a good general idea of the ways ANPR is currently being used within the Dutch National Police."

They went lights and bells, and started waving urgently, whilst looking each driver in the eyes and accelerating.  They all start accelerating, up to about 150kmph (90mph) and he looks in his rear view mirror and there are 3 white commodore's travelling in convoy behind him, 1 with the Aus number plate 1, the other #2, the third #3.  They come up on an highway intersection and the bikes that sped past him have blocked off highway entrances, the bikes in front of him had slowed down such that they were blocking the highway in front, and were indicating with their arms vigorously that my mate and the other cars were to get off immediately.   They took the exit, and #1, 2 and 3 Aus plates sped flying past him.  I've never wanted to be a politician more in my life.

Class A is almost always dress uniform, consisting of little or no equipment.  At least in Chicago, most of the time when you just see an officer on patrol, they are wearing their Class C uniform. The following is from the Chicago Police Department Directives:   The Class C Uniform is a field uniform consisting primarily of garments which are specifically designed for field use.   Class B is a step between a Class A and Class C.     The Class B Uniform is a prescribed uniform similar to the Class A Uniform but without wool garments and with someprovisions for field use.

I assumed that a GDs car had mounted the curb during a pursuit and chased a stolen car into this garage and subsequently rammed it. I wondered where abouts that was outlined in their standard operating procedures haha.

It looks big enough for a small weather radar unit, but that's a pretty rare accessory for a helicopter."
policeporn,331awm,GlenOnReddit,4,Sun Apr 19 04:12:00 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: this is all just a guess from looking at the same picture.   For the FLIR placement, it seems that the ground clearance under the helicopter is far too low to mount the camera below. Instead, they probably just had to pick a side to place it on. They may have picked that side to aid right-hand seated pilots or there is an obstruction on the other side.   Dauphins are used heavily by the US Coast Guard during some pretty harsh conditions so a weather radar in the nose doesn't seem too unlikely to me."

G-36K is the mid range / medium sized rifle G-36c is the compact portable rifle.

This model served throughout WW1, and in 1939 the UK started manufacturing the No 4 MKI, which was adopted by some commonwealth nations, but not by India or Australia or New Zealand, who retained the No 1 MKIII*.  These are not, interestingly the Ishapore 2A1 rifles, which is the Indian designed and made designation for the No 1 MKIII* modified to use 7.62mm NATO rounds. You can tell these are original No 1 MKIII(*)s because they have the sloped magazine, and the original buttstock and sword bayonet."
policeporn,30nbmx,collinsl02,1 point,Sat Apr 4 11:47:54 2015 UTC,how does policing work in india?
policeporn,30nbmx,shaymos,4,Sun Mar 29 06:30:54 2015 UTC,"This is kind of an open ended question, but I'll give it a shot.  The Indian Police can be separated into two main categories: State Police and the police controlled by the central government of India.  The State Police can be subdivided into:   Metropolitan Police: Local police for large metropolitan areas. They do normal police stuff Traffic Police: They can be grouped under metropolitan police in large cities. State Armed Police (Indian SWAT): Provide policing in particularly violent or serious situations. They also sometimes are assigned VIP duty and take part in counter-insurgency ops.   The police controlled by the central government of India can be subdivided into:   Central Armed Police Forces: This category functions more as a paramilitary force than police force. They are in charge of border security and conduct many counter terror and counter insurgency operations. They even operate abroad as part of UN Peacekeeping missions. National Security Guard (Basically Super SWAT): It is made up of personnel from the Indian Army and the Central Armed Police Force. They mainly conduct counter-terror ops. Central Investigation and Intelligence Institutions: This category is made up of many other agencies that serve similar functions to the FBI, DEA, DOJ, ATF, etc.   This is an extremely summarized version of policing in India. The sites I've linked provide a lot more info for those who are interested."

policeporn,30h5kv,SmugBuster2012,5,Fri Mar 27 15:46:26 2015 UTC,Sorry but I have to correct you on a few things because I'm a nitpicker. It's actually a turbo inline six rather than a V6. Also the first FG Falcon came with a V8 in Xr8 guise until it was axed in 2010. The current FGX has reintroduced the V8 Xr8 model.
policeporn,30h5kv,Blakrat,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:12:33 2015 UTC,Yeah your correct.  Ford have had a v8 model almost every year for the past 20 years.  It was the 10 years or so before that where they lacked a few extra cylinders

Note: What I'm saying is that there is a personal logic to where everything goes, that others wont see. I'm not saying experienced cops are stupid/insert-suitable-word."

I say the LVMPD academy exam and seminar a couple of weeks later. At one point they show a slideshow of all Las Vegas police officers killed in the line of duty, and this was the first time they had to add in those officers.  You could hear the shaking in the voice of the officer in charge of the exam."

As someone from a flyover state, this is pleasantly surprising news. I assumed a big department like Las Vegas Metro would have quite a few OIS incidents and therefore deaths. Is crime in Las Vegas mostly misdemeanor stuff? The impression I get from COPS is that Las Vegas is like the Disneyland for cops - weird and funny stuff day in, day out."

DOJ got involved, and the department out a new plan into effect that seems to have tapered that problem off."
