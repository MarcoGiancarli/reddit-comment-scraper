shrooms,3e255a,barret50,2,Tue Jul 21 11:11:15 2015 UTC,"I've only done shrooms once, and I took about 2 grams.  I'd say that I experienced mild visuals/perception changes. That being said, shrooms are a very powerful drug, and 2 grams will definitely get you feeling the effects. I would recommend starting with 2 grams.(You could always take more!)  Effects lasted about 6 hours.  I Plan on doing an eighth soon. :)   With your anxiety and lack of confidence, I would probably advise doing shrooms by yourself if you are comfortable alone, or another person, and maybe a sitter, a best friend that knows you well. Shrooms will allow you to face yourself, and your problems if you wish. I know first-hand, tripping with a lot of people around, especially if you don't know them very well, can be very very unsettling. But if you are comfortable and friends with everyone there, I don't think you'll have a problem at all. Shrooms are fun as helllll, and either way you'll have a blast trust me. Just be ready to face yourself....  P.S.  I would avoid fucking with research chemicals like 25D-NBOME. Little is known about some of these drugs and the long-term effects are not clear.  LSD is the shit though, and wayyyy more enjoyable than nbome's in my opinion.  Good luck and let us know how it goes!!!"
shrooms,3e255a,hEyHeYwhatup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:58 2015 UTC,"2 grams is a perfect first dosage. You will certainly feel the effects and ""become one"" with the universe, as if you're watching trees breathe and the grass sway with you. You should be able to see geometrical shapes and kind of see how the world is created; it's tough to explain. You might see your emotions visually and you will face said emotions head on. It can be a truly liberating experience!  Having somebody else there is important just in case as a support. I wish you best of luck, and feel free to message me if you have any extra questions or concerns!"
shrooms,3e255a,MrB_2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:33 2015 UTC,Eat 2g.  It will be fun.  Make sure you are comfortable with the space and people on your journey.  As long as you are amongst friends it's unlikely you will have a bad experience.

It's a little trickier to grow and it's pretty saucy stuff.  Once you leave the world of cubes, there's actually big differences in the substrate you use, the behavior of the species and the environment in which you'll fruit it.   A fun species to play with is the shiitake mushroom. It's great for beginners and a good teaching species for growers. You can grow the PF-style by replacing the brown rice flour with sawdust. You use the jars throughout fruiting to coax primordia development- after birthing dunking and rolling, you just put the cakes back in the jars without a lid and put them in your SGFC. Check /r/Sporetraders and /r/Mushroomgrowers for spores/cultures.  (Shiitake are inactive, but tasty. It's good to grow some non-active species along with your actives. You're the guy who's into mycology, not the guy who just wants to get fucked up, ya know?

""B....but...but I don't wanna fan and mist so much becau-"" YOU DON'T have to fan and mist the bin 800 times a day. Fanning is for dialing in tubs and not a requirement when the SGFC is built properly. Misting is pointless except when dialing in a tub and if your cakes have dried out somehow. All the techniques that say to fan and mist every single goddamn day are as wrong and outdated as the techniques that say to colonize in darkness and I wish they would go away. Perlite wicks moisture into the air because vents on the bottom allow air to get through. This keeps an air cycle while maintaining proper humidity. Putting a regular SGFC in the closet with no fan and a simple light and never bothering with it except to harvest will do so much better than the circus you're talking about.)  🍄 rhizo"

IMO you are approaching this whole thing completely wrong, i.e. trying to get fucked up and use it as a party drug, and also trying to be way too much in control over the whole experience. Tripping is about losing control. It's a journey/adventure, and sometimes you have to go off the beaten path, sometimes you have to face scary monsters etc... Take this as an opportunity to get in touch with nature and just enjoy the beauty and craziness of life. Forget about expectations and control."
shrooms,3e17l8,happiefish,6,Tue Jul 21 06:47:48 2015 UTC,"I would focus on just having a clean first experience on shrooms. That way everyone can experience it for itself then make judgements on what may aide you on consecutive journeys. It's crazy how pot can drastically change a trip for a person based on their individual biology. One person can love it while the next will spend the next 8 hours fighting dizziness and paranoia. I've never done xanax.  Have plenty of good snacks, healthy ones are preferred, and clean water on hand!  Besides that just provide a handful of headphones/music devices incase an individual needs to personally zone out, and maybe a few light visual toys or activities. Be prepared for some to be really social and some to possibly want to internalize. Just keep em comfortable, and have a blast!  Ooh and mosquitoes suck ass when you're tripping - if that might be a problem lol"
shrooms,3e17l8,Oaknot,5,Tue Jul 21 09:10:35 2015 UTC,"No alcohol, beforehand. Shrooms are a great experience on their own, so a strong mind altering substance like psilocybin is already a big leap.   If none of you has any psychonautic experience, I recommend having a sitter.   If you guys feel comfortable enough, enjoy your trip!   P.s. have a nice groovy playlist at hand. Try some Glass Animals(they're cool)"
shrooms,3e17l8,woodJelly,3,Tue Jul 21 05:06:21 2015 UTC,"Forget the Xanax - you don't need it. I'd say forget the weed too. Some people like it at any point in the trip, but if you guys have never tripped before then why would you want to go into the experience on other drugs? My suggestion is to start your trip cold sober, and well rested and hydrated, so you get the full clean experience. Weed changes the nature of your trip pretty drastically - it can male your visuals more intense but the weed-induced visuals have a somehow more superficial less meaningful quality to them, and your headspace goes from clear and focused to foggy and disconnected. I do occasionally like to smoke during the comedown, but not until I feel almost normal again. I also like to drink 2-4 beers at that stage of the journey - it seems to pull me back to earth and help me to get to sleep too. I'd advise against hard liquor, as sometimes your perception of how much you're drinking can get a little off. I had a friend once who thought it would be a good idea to take a little drink off a bottle of vodka - ten minutes later we all realized that he had downed the whole bottle like it was water.

I was advised not to roll after my initial birth because, due to a different error (my guess is too much light when still in jars) my jars were heavily pinning in vitro. Online I read that rolling in verm if pins are present is a no-no, due to the sharp edges of the verm potentially hurting the pins.   Even though its the first verm roll, was it still a bad idea? I hope things are going to be okay, but if not, the first time was supposed to be a learning experience and I've surpassed my initial goals anyways by getting a successful initial flush."

After the cake has begun to produce fruits it becomes more sensitive and susceptible to problems. The dunk was overboard and the roll was probably stressful for it.

You then drop some of your LC syringe into it, and incubate that for a week or so.. shaking to break up the mycelium chains growing inside.. this is how you would expand LC.

If you are not in a right mindset, you should set up an enviroment that lets you deal with the 'issues' properly while shot into another reality.  Otherwise it will likely surface in places you are not ready to fight it.  Doing mushrooms recreationally (Concert, Movies, Party, group get-together) needs a pretty clear mind, no major emotional issues happening.    Have a dark chocolate candy bar at the ready while you trip.  Dark chocolate helps bring people down while having bad experiences on psychedelics (mushrooms particularly), but only eat it if you want to quicken the ending of your tripping.  It will definitely knock a few levels off the experience.  Galindoi"

If they sat in the fridge inbetween innoculations the spores can settle and germinate a little, kind of looks a little clouds when they do this.  When this happens to me I REALLY have to shake it up to break that clump apart.  You can re-innoculate the jars if they haven't had to long to dry out.  Probably still get a harvest from them.

But if u insist on trying it out then i would recommend you take an extremely small dosage, around a level 1 trip and have a clear schedule so you don't worry about time management.

shrooms,3duh9e,IwillMasticateYou,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:40:15 2015 UTC,"Grinding them up into a powder with a food processor always did the trick for me. Yes lemon juice would work too, though I never noticed any difference so long as it sits in it for 20 or 30 minutes. (well, no difference except that I don't care much for lemon juice, too acidic would give me heartburn which lead to a very bad trip that I'm not in the mood to discuss)"
shrooms,3duh9e,Fistedfartbox,4,Sun Jul 19 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"I love the tea.  I've done shrooms over a dozen times, but last time i did them, i did the tea for the first time.  I used a french press to brew the tea, using green tea, lemon, and honey.  It tastes MUCH better,  kicks in sooner, and doesn't last as long.  When eating them directly,  the effects have lasted about 8 hours (for an 8th usually). With the tea,  after about 4 hours i was through the really intense part and able to go visit friends at a bar (something i wouldn't do normally after eating shrooms)."
shrooms,3duh9e,Niablo,4,Sun Jul 19 16:41:11 2015 UTC,"I enjoy eating them more, tea goes down easier but in my experiences doesn't last as long and is less potent. That may just be the way I made it in the past, but I like to eat them to be sure I'm getting all of it. Edit:in my opinion chocolate milk is a great thing to take them with. It's thick and delicious so it masks the texture and taste perfectly."
shrooms,3duh9e,Psilos88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:43:36 2015 UTC,Tea makes it easy to digest. Eating it in my opinion is better since it lasts longer and is more intense. A jb&j&shroom sandwich always hits the spot. Crunchy peanut butter to better handle texture.
shrooms,3duh9e,kingofspain131,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"Try some flavored tea, they will mask the taste of the shroom. Just don't use black tea, the caffeine kills a bit of the buzz. If you want the trip to last longer you can drink Mate. It's a form of Argentinean tea that is a mild MAOI. Just be careful though, MAOIs are nothing to fuck around with. But Mate will make the trip last longer. Sometimes though making a trip last longer is not always a good thing.   When making your tea, don't simmer the mushroom in heat. The temperature kills the molecule. You want the water to be almost boiling, turn off the heat and wait a few minutes. Why rush it right? Take your time. Then pour the water and let it sit there for a while. Drink it and be happy.  One thing to consider, if you have a way to grind the mushroom. This will increase the contact surface and you will get more psylocibin in the water. Tea is just like eating in terms of come up and duration of the trip."

Highly recommend   I just did my own variation of Don Quixotes tea tek.....like 30 min ago. Took 7g of ground mush. Soaked it fresh lemon juice(2-3 lemons, enough to turn it to mud) let it sit for 30 min. Boiled some water. For this, I took 2 10oz bottles of water so I could then use the water bottle to put the finished tea back into. Put the lemon tek shrooms in the water (after I removed it from the stove). Steep 4 peppermint tea bags in the mixture for 15 mins. Also whIle it is steeping i squeeze another lemon worth of juice in. Then ran through a coffee filter back into the bottles. I don't like the taste of tea particularly so I cut it with some store bought iced tea.

I usually eat a big chunk of ginger while I'm getting ready to eat the shrooms. There is a chemical in ginger that helps prevent the psilocin from binding to the neuroreceptor responsible for most of the nausea, and ginger helps stimulate digestion so you'll get through it quicker.   You could also try lemon tek. It changes the dynamics of the trip somewhat but it is much easier on the stomach than just eating the shrooms as they are."

I'm not sure about mint specifically, but I know there are several herbs that have other chemicals that perform a similar role to the one in ginger. Off the top of my head: rosemary, sage, oregano. They are not as good at it as ginger is though."

Chances are you could make a wicked ginger/basil/lemon tea that would taste great and keep you refreshed. Since it's summer (at least this side of the equator) I suggest you drink it iced. Don't add milk as I've heard dairy breaks down psilocybin.

shrooms,3drnuk,wakacockaboom,2,Sat Jul 18 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"I had my funnest trip at the beach. Me and my best friend drove to the beach and ate 5 truffles (roughly 8g of psylocibin) each at 8 o'clock at port St Joe in fl and ended up back at my house in south GA at 5:30am.. it was INTENSE! The sky's were incredible and it was an isolated beach and it was so calming. Be careful of crabs, they gave me a bad trip for awhile. Lots of bug, so bring lots of bug spray. Stay  together, it will be VERY dark.. It was my favorite trip. Make sure you feel the water a little bit and just stare at the sky and out into the ocean. Its amazing. I loved meditating while I was out there too. Have fun! Just go with the flow. We saw a random man out in the middle of nowhere at 1am and I was seriously convinced he was God and my homie was convinced he was a cop and he knew everything! But it was so adventurous and explorable. Live in the moment, not your head! Don't worry about problems that aren't real yet."

shrooms,3drnuk,Beanbaker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:39:36 2015 UTC,Be conscious of how far out in the water you go (last time I tripped at the beach I only went to about chest height in the water and it was just fine). And make sure to use a lot of sun screen/reapply over the course of the day (if you need it). Burned the shit out of my legs after not really having a concept of time while lying in the sand :p

Having a sober tripsitter there helped to organize everything though so it could've been worse. Nonetheless, bring the essentials!

shrooms,3drnuk,alias_alexis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:44:54 2015 UTC,"My only trips (2) have been on the beach. The first was one of the best experiences of my life. Lots of friends, food, and good times there. The second experience was more quiet, in the very dark of night. I had a much larger dose, we had a good fire going but it still got cold there. Bring clothes just in case (I know you are in FL but the night might get a wee chill to it). Also bring plenty of water, beaches dry you out even at night. Also, for some reason orange juice was the absolute best thing in the world for me when I was coming out of the trip and walking home."

Just drove down onto it, put up a tent in case I wanted a place to just lie down and relax out of the sun (I did, after the peak), and drank a mild dose of shroom tea. Didn't swim, just explored some rocks and looked at the sand, a rather relaxing trip. It would have been a really nice place for a group trip.  I'd rather not trip at a crowded beach."

shrooms,3dtgw9,turkeysaladwork,2,Sun Jul 19 08:06:34 2015 UTC,"All right, since you are more experienced with other chems I will give you an analogy you can understand. You know when you take anything in your body be it a drug or food and you have that feeling that what you just took is doing it's intended purpose but at the same time it's also poisoning you. That cigarette feels ohh so good when you smoke it. You know it's killing you, but it's is like you can't function without that first cigarette in the morning. It's that starbucks frapuccino that you know will make you a fat ass but you still take it.  This happens with all types of substances that enter our body, be they alcohol, caffeine, heroin, nicotine, pharmaceuticals, cocaine, nootropics, anything that is not supposed to be inside your body. It's funny though, sometimes you realign yourself with a chemical, is like your body needs it to function. I say this because before starting on mushrooms I had totally quit smoking nicotine. I don't remember how long I was without it, something like 6-7 months, but it felt like an eternity. Lately I have restarted smoking cigarettes and I don't feel that ""regret"" I used to feel before. My breath stinks but that's an understandable side effect of the feeling that the smoking gives you.   Ok back to your question  Mushrooms have been used throughout 5000 years modern human history. The LD50 of mushrooms is something ridiculous like 2 pounds, I think. You'd have a hard time ingesting 5g let alone 2 pounds.   So you can up your dosage since you have some experience. But you have to take a threshold dose. You have to feel the punch in the face. Now here is the thing, the trip is you within you. If you have been naughty, fear will most likely crawl up and you will have some difficulty during the trip. it's temporary though.   The thing about fear though, is that once you let got, it looses it's hold on you. For you to have a really enjoyable mushroom experience, you will have to learn to trust the Oracle.   As far as preparation, if you go though my post history and read it, it's almost as it were a manual for mushroom taking. Basically it is this: plan and protect your trip, be comfortable, and do what feels right in your gut. If you want to crawl on the floor, do it. If you want to stare at clouds do it.   Or something like that :)"
shrooms,3dtgw9,YearGood,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:34:10 2015 UTC,"Just be sure to ask yourself in the middle of the trip, ""What do I desire?"". Laugh and cry uncontrollably when you figure it out."

shrooms,3dryx2,figure_d_it_out,3,Sat Jul 18 21:55:48 2015 UTC,For me the first time I ate an 8th I was zoned out and I snapped back to reality and it felt like I had been on auto pilot for years of my life. Then I went outside and thought about how we all develop personalities and interests to craft who we are but they can change at any time. We have the power to be whatever we want to be but who we are is a reflection of our subconscious just acting how we are use to acting. Idk I was really confused because I felt like I was concious and aware of the world for the first time in my life.
shrooms,3dryx2,XanderTheMander,2,Sat Jul 18 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"To me it means that i can't keep a conversation with almost noone. I like to go and be separete, and not inside a house. I need to be by trees and plants. And then i can meditate. Which is something i cannot do unless i'm on shrooms. I like the feeling of nothing. Wich is opposite of what i feel when i'm not on shrooms. People disgust me in real life to. Actually i hate almost everyone. On shrooms i don't think about that, but it is very hard to be around people. Certain people impossible. I just get up and walk away immediately.  In the woods with the animals is where i belong.  Edit: To me Ego death means not even trying to be social, because i really don't care about most of the people i've ever met in this life. Some people appear uglier that others, but they are all equal in that they don't contibute to anything interesting. They don't offer anything of interest of their own selfs. They are cowards. So all the fake stuff i do when not being on shrooms, i stop doing. I do not think about anything."
shrooms,3dryx2,straightedgefred,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"As far as I understand Ego Death in my limited understanding of it. In the beginning, before you learn the ways of the Oracle, you go through life and you develop a sense of identity. You develop this sense thought your entire life.Your education growing up, your home environment, how your parents raised you and etc. They are your morals, your values, your beliefs. This also encompass your career choices, general habits, consumer habits, life in general. You are here, here is your identity. Once you start taking the mushrooms you start to lose that artificial ego and start to align them with what you are meant to be. Who you really are. Your true identity. The interesting thing about when you make these choices, they are hard in the beginning as any hard choice is. But then you start to follow the ways of the Oracle and life starts to give you a break. The breaks start going your way. It's like the mushroom is teaching you to follow your gut. It's a weird feeling, that sometimes boggles the mind. But it's there.    I was a drunken, arrogant idiot who was a fat slob when I first started taking them. I was totally lost in my life. Now I work out everyday, know what I am in this life, have taken up gardening as a hobby, want to start a new business and I can't be happier about it."

Pour in boiled water (let it calm down a bit) and wait fifteen minutes. Strain out the material and put it back in the cup, put the mush-water aside. Repeat again with the same material.  At this point I discard the material, and filter the mush-water. I like to then mix in some koolaid mix. I refrigerate until I get a chance to get to it, try not to take longer than a week to get to it- tell SO or roommates not to drink it like idiots and/or clearly mark it.  You can make jello too! Use the unflavored mush-water as the cold water in the jello recipe and BAM! Psychedelic jello! 🍄"

I learned how to sink my body into a slower state with calm regulated breathing and a form of empty thought concept. Just closing the eyes and letting things surface, don't focus on any one thought that's what sends you into spirals. Let everything empty out and find what floats up to the surface and pokes it head then disappears and wait for the next... My trips have been a whole lot cooler since that one big mushroom night.

shrooms,3doix5,ineedmymedicine,4,Sat Jul 18 14:53:37 2015 UTC,"I experienced the sensation of ""dying"" on my first trip, as have many others. There is a state known as ego death (which interpret as primal consciousness absent of any identifying characteristics ""i.e. I am John Smith and went to Baker University and was born in ..."" etc.) There is an idea that it is an abberent psychological ""growth"" so to speak called the ego (this goes back to Indo-European mythology -- pre-Hindu), each of us so closely attached to our own identity or sense of being, and this is the fundamental problem with humanity and the source of great suffering.  Example: You are the center of your experience, so you see your experience, thus life, relationships, jobs, etc. as being very important. And naturally you want the best for yourself (who wouldn't?). But EVERYONE feels this way primally, so life becomes a constant battle of subconscious competition and the stress and rat races that come with.   We see a squirrel and it is just ""a squirrel"". All squirrels are pretty much the same to us, even different species that look totally different. ""That's just a squirrel"". We condense all the idiosychrocies, feelings of every squirrel in existence and reduce it to one single identity of general ""squirrel being"".  What we need to do is do this with ourselves, collectively as a species, but because of evolutionarily coded complexes of self-benefit and survival, we believe our own personalities to be the most important thing. At high doses of mushrooms, the ego disappears (""ego death""), and we are left with the universal, primordial consciousness, a state we are not familiar with, and we feel as if the ""ego"" (personality construct) has died (which it temporarily has) which we interpret as US dying.  Mckenna also recommended the heroic dose in silent darkness. I would recommend setting up a friend in the other room (pizza beer netflix internet) to keep as an ""anchor"" in case things get too much but otherwise the trips should mostly be taken alone.  I think in small doses (a couple stems or a cap or two), mushrooms are great for social settings, but at the larger doses society is just obnoxious."

I would just say be prepared for 'phases' where you can feel really sick at times, but just think of it as being purged of psychic toxins. Keep some pleasant music and activities on hand in case you start to focus on anxiety. Switching up by stepping outside to watch the moon, getting in the shower or massaging with your partner will make a huge difference if ickiness sets in.

Sometimes a song would bring them back and I would do everything I could to distract myself. Now I try to think about my mortality as often as possible. Not in a morbid or anxious way, but to remind myself how precious life is and specifically to identify with my ego less. It is some kind of mental or spiritual weight training to face your own death.   Of course ""I"" am still scared to die, but dwelling on the negative aspects just seems silly. You die either way, use the confusion and anxiety instead of succumbing to them. Or not, it's your death! I mean life. :)  If you want a solution: meditate, meditate, meditate.

I personally have experienced things that would make someone believe in a greater force of life or spirituality, but I don't know how literally I should interpret the it.

If you've watched I, Pet Goat II I think the character with the screen genie hatching from his head and then gnashing at him is a great depiction of it. I don't think our situation has to be an inherent property of technology, but it is what it has become for many people. Technology isn't about ""answers"", and it isn't even very often about real solutions. I don't know why material intelligence has superseded wisdom as the way to measure real human progress, but here we are.    I don't know how literally I should interpret... Do most people see it as a result of the chemical or could it truly be a glimpse into the origins of the universe?    Ask 100 people who have spent any time trying to answer that question for themselves and you'll get 100 answers. I don't think having a concrete answer to the questions you raise is even necessary; the fact that we can have these experiences whether they are placebo, neurochemistry or direct evidence of divine influence does not change their relevance and significance for me one bit.

Sam Harris has some good insights on the mono/dialogue in his book Waking Up:   All parents have seen their children put their growing powers of speech to use by maintaining running monologues with themselves. These monologues continue throughout life as though they were, in fact, dialogues. The resulting conversation seems both strange and unnecessary. Why should we live in relationship to ourselves rather than merely as ourselves? Why should an 'I' and a 'me' be keeping each other company?   Imagine that you have lost your sunglasses. You search the house up and down, and finally you spot them. You promptly think, 'There they are!' as you make your way to them, but to whom are you thinking this thought? You may have even uttered the phrase out loud, 'There they are!' but who needed to be informed in this way, as 'you' had already seen them. Is there someone else in your search party? The truth is that conscious thoughts are continually happening in our minds, but who is thinking them and who is communicating them to whom is simply a personal, baked-in metaphor which we have come to believe in, but upon introspection, no matter what metaphor we have become accustomed to, it is not the only metaphor available."

I prefer to be alone to be able to go fully introvert, but the first time it can be nice to have a friend there whom you fully trust.  Music is good to have to trigger certain thoughts. Choose wisely the songs for the first time.   Turn off the internet and phone.  Have a movie you have seen a couple of times that makes you happy ready to watch. It can be good to have if you want to get out of your own head for a bit if it gets too intense.  Going outside for a bit can be nice if you feel comfortable. Avoid places with people, go in to a familiar forest or similar.  Over time you wont have to plan so much. I can even watch trillers by myself without having a bad trip, but I'm very comfortable with my trippy self.  Be sure to atleast have a friend that you can call just in case. Even though you most likely wont need it, it's a comfortable safety net.  Aslong as you plan beforehand and dont take a way too large dose the first time, you'll have a great time!  Good luck!"

I'd say play it safe, and save one or the other for another day :) A fantastic combo for shrooms, however, is Cannabis."
shrooms,3dod6w,RedAssTOMDOSS,4,Fri Jul 17 23:04:46 2015 UTC,Combining shrooms and mdma presents no increased risk of serotonin syndrome any more than mdma by itself
shrooms,3dod6w,dsfo45,2,Sat Jul 18 01:41:20 2015 UTC,This is correct. I think the reason is because shrooms do not cause your brain to release serotonin directly like MDMA does. There is no difference by adding the shrooms

shrooms,3doltt,Psychotic_psychosis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:13:38 2015 UTC,Depends on the type of substrate you use as well as the amount of spawn vs. amount of substrate. I'd say on average it takes about 2 weeks to be ready for fruiting conditions. Patience is key in this hobby. As long as you give it time it will pay off in the end
shrooms,3do1ou,in_bulk,2,Fri Jul 17 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"No, those are referred to as ""fuzzy feet"". That along with the stretching stems and poor production are indicators of bad air exchange. Whatever ""automatic terrarium apparatus"" you're using sucks total ass. It's waaaay too wet in there and there's obviously next to zero air exchange.  The fruits you have are safe to eat, but if you want better results than that nightmare; build a better fruiting chamber. And that cake has aerial mycelium all over again because of poor air exchange. Healthy fruits and cakes, totally shitty environment.  Edit/ ok I see what you're talking about. Yeah that cakes tamned up. Wet it down first (which shouldn't be difficult), and remove it. It may spread, but wait and see. Build a better chamber, that one totally blows. You could clean it out and use it again, but don't. Because it's a terrible design."
shrooms,3do1ou,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Ok, so here is my next question:  I have a job where I can mist/fan at most twice a day about 8 hours apart. Is that enough misting/fanning with a SGFC?"
shrooms,3do1ou,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:39:02 2015 UTC,Too much. Just leave them alone. Only fan when dialing in the tub (you shouldn't need to) and only mist when cakes look dry (they shouldn't for some time)
shrooms,3do1ou,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:33:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, I was using the link to ""A post detailing the PF tek for growing shrooms (great for beginners)"" and it says:  Fanning and misting is a daily ritual that you will need to do to provide your cakes with the needed moisture and fresh air exchange to promote optimal growth. You will have to plug in your own variables and environmental conditions to find a routine that works for you, but here is a basic overview:  Misting should be done 2-3 times per day. I like to mist lightly in the morning, in the afternoon, and then once more before bed. You want to set your spray bottle to the fine mist setting and directly mist the cakes. Do not saturate them, but allow a good portion of the mist to settle onto the cakes. As well misting helps replenish moisture to the perlite and keeps up relative humidity. After each time you mist you should be fanning your chamber with the chambers lid, a book or magazine. I like to fan for 15-30 seconds, this will start the process of evaporation off your cakes, which is a major pinning trigger.  NOTE: If you work long hours your chamber will be fine if left 10-14 hours without misting or fanning. Just be sure to give them a good mist and fan before work, and then once again after you return. This will not effect your mushrooms negatively. If you are around to give your mushrooms more attention by all means do so, but do not worry about leaving the chamber for 10-14 hours.  Fan every time after you mist, along with a few more times throughout the day. While I only mist 2-3 times per day, I tend to fan somewhere in the range of 5-6 times per day. This allows fresh air exchange and will keep your fruits very happy. There is such a thing as fanning to much tho, do keep in mind."
shrooms,3do1ou,CornbreadAndBeans,2,Sat Jul 18 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we've all read these teks (check out how old it is), but they're pointless. If you open up your chamber every day and yell at your cakes for forty minutes mushrooms will still grow too. Doesn't mean it helps. If your SGFC is built properly and off the ground, you only have to mist when it's dry, and fanning is laughably stupid. It's just something we're growing away from.  Tbh, you could go either way, just saying absolutely none of it is necessary. The air cycle from the design expels co2 and brings in fresh air while the perlite wicks moisture into the air. The system's already there, no need to fuck with it."

Every time I've went hiking on shrooms once it kicks in good, I would sit in the same spot for two hours with nothing to do having a blast.

Setting: be somewhere safe that you are comfortable in. Don't trip at a buddies house you barely know or something like that. Do a familiar park or your own house when no one is around who will be condescending.  If the taste is too much for you make a sandwich out of it. Try not to eat a ton of extra stuff though since it'll slow down the digestion process.

I have heard anecdotally that taking the same amount the next day has approximately half the effect, and then if you were to trip on the same amount a third day in a row, you would feel basically no effects. Tolerance builds up fast.  So long story short, if you want to have a similar trip again, wait like a week, or increase the amount you consume."

shrooms,3dkdmm,AnalogueMemories,2,Thu Jul 16 23:47:52 2015 UTC,"There are no studies that suggest that baeocystin is toxic. It is an analog of psilocybin (very similar molecule structure). However I did find this:  https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_chemistry1.shtml  But again, no studies suggest that baeocystin is toxic, so I believe the website you linked is mostly bullshit.  Edit: Also shit like this makes me seriously doubt the credibility of the report:   If we consider that the average content of active indolic compounds makes up to 1 per cents of the weight of the dry mushrooms and that a dry Psilocybe semilanceata weights around 200 mg, then, this species bears approximately 2 mg of psilocybin. Thus, 5 of these mushroom are necessary for a trip. This is what the followers of the mushroom cult propose by setting the dosage to 5 to 10 mushrooms for small trip, and to 20 to 40 for a big trip. The maximum dosage to avoid a bad trip is 60 mushrooms."
shrooms,3dkdmm,TOLBUHIN,2,Fri Jul 17 01:34:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware of any mycotoxins that cause such a rapid death. The LD50 for psilocybin would require an ingestion of 15-30 kilograms of fresh mushrooms, though it's unknown if the human LD50 would be a simple extrapolation of the lab LD50.  There's no reason to believe baeocystin would be fatally toxic at the sort of dose mentioned in the case -  a peculiar case full of factual errors, unfounded suppositions,  and ending with ridiculous conclusions, but nonetheless a tragic tale.  Hippie John Griggs died of a overdose after consuming an unmeasured dose of what was purported to be pure synthetic psilocybin. Anything is lethal in a high enough amount - even water has an LD50, and people die every year from water toxicity."

This is the same type of thing that psilocybin is (again with, psilocin). Baeocystin, concentration wise, is typically the far lowest of the three ""trip"" compounds.

You just have to give your body time for the shrooms to leave your system or else the higher doses won't give you the full effects that you want.  Wait at least a week or two in between the trips but working your way up is definitely smarter than 4.5g all at once.  I've only gotten to do a 1.8g trip and next time i might do 1.8-2.5g.  You never know the potency of your shrooms until you've tried a dose of them too because the potency can very to an extent among strains.  I think its probably smart that before you plan on taking a large dose of your shrooms, take a smaller dose of the same ones so that you can gauge how much you should use for the big dose.  If you are excited and think you can handle it than you probably can if its just 1 gram! it should still get you a decent trip if they are good."

I once saw a graph that showed to get the same effects the following day you would have to eat like 1.5x or 2x your dose from the day before and this continues every day of continuous use.  I can't say I have experience with this but I'm pretty sure the tolerance both builds up fast and goes away fast."
shrooms,3di7ni,digdog303,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:42:04 2015 UTC,"Starting with a lower dose is a very good idea. My favorite dose is just under 2g, but if it seems relevant to you a bigger dose can be worth it.  I don't necessarily recommend mixing shrooms with food, especially something heavy and inflaming like (presumably wheat) pasta and oil. Shrooms can have interesting body loads and I think the more empty your tract is, the better. If you want to eat them raw with food to get rid of the taste, I'd say go with some fruit. But I know some people mix them with meals and do fine, so do whatever makes sense to you.   If you want to move towards spiritual experiences, tripping alone is the way to go. Once you start pushing your goal dose I would recommend having an informed friend on standby in case it starts to get too intense. If you do your homework and get comfortable with the experience during your smaller doses, you can give them enough information to keep the worst from happening even if they've never tripped themselves.

Just place them on a cookie sheet or something and put them in the freezer or fridge.   If you want to try something else, making chocolate mushroom cubes works really well too, and it's relatively easy. All you do is chop the mushrooms finely and divide them by weight depending on how many grams you want in each cube. Melt the chocolate.  To set this up, put the divided mushrooms into ice cube trays. Pour the chocolate into the tray and stir while the chocolate is still warm. Then freeze. Now you have perfectly portioned mushroom cubes. This works really well with mint or orange flavoured chocolate as well! I normally eat them frozen really slowly or you can thaw them too.

Lots of idiots ask for ID's on anything that turns blue when bruised, it's not the first question, it's the last.  After you narrow it down to ""just might be what I'm looking for"" that habit of Psilocybes to bruise blue comes into play.

shrooms,3djp03,K_rey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:07:59 2015 UTC,What this person says is exactly right... wet totally fresh mushrooms are 10 to 1 ratio.... 20g would be right fresh mushrooms because that's like 2g dry.
shrooms,3djp03,K_rey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:53:00 2015 UTC,"Truffles or cubensis? If cubensis, 2-3g is good, that's still what I take for a recreational dose. I know truffles are weaker per gram, but I don't know enough to recommend a dose."

There are a lot of factors involved, ending up with one of my friends in the hospital and having to get him released while coming down.

shrooms,3dgv7l,WhyDontHobos,2,Thu Jul 16 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"From the description it looks like they don't actually include the cubensis spores? In that case, you might as well buy all these things yourself and set up your own grow. It's not hard at all, just go over to shroomery.org and read up on some teks. Feel free to ask me any questions :)"
shrooms,3dgv7l,happiefish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:42:50 2015 UTC,"shroomery has a ton of information.  I'm planning to start soon too and I plan on getting all of my information from shroomery.org, they also have links to valid spore providing websites."
shrooms,3dhdrv,sroggg,5,Thu Jul 16 07:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yes to everything, shrooms have helped me immensely on an emotional and spiritual level. I like to trip at least two or three times a year as a cathartic cleansing.  The best way to approach the trip is with an open mind. Try not to have any preconceived ideas or expectations of the trip. Before I do a heroic dose I like to say a little prayer, stating my intent, something like ""sacred shrooms, show me what you have to show, teach me what you have to teach"" etc...  If there are specific issues you want to work through, it can help to write down some questions before the trip so that you can reflect on them while in an altered state for a fresh perspective. Mostly I've found that at high doses, shit just gets so crazy that normal thinking isn't even possible. The shrooms show me things I didn't even think to ask before. Just relax and go with it, leave the deep thinking for the reintegration / come down the next day."

shrooms,3dhdrv,noodlyjames,2,Thu Jul 16 11:46:20 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a sitter to guide you through your mind if you don't know how to ask yourself questions while tripping. You can have ""conversations"" (quotation mark because it's really hard to have a conversation while on 6g) with your sitter about various subjects, and beforehand you can ask your sitter to guide you through subjects you have predetermined. For example, if you want to meditate on your youth, you can ask your sitter to tell you a story where both of you were in at a younger age, then the mind will do the rest.   Preparing yourself mentally before taking shrooms is an important part. If you want answers to questions, you need to know the questions firts. Meditating when you're coming up on the shrooms definetly help with that!  Trip safe"
shrooms,3dhdrv,tehKreator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:06:08 2015 UTC,Yes! What I did was have headphones on with smooth jazz and a blindfold and say in bed and just laid with my mind. Less physical stimulus helps a lot

shrooms,3dhdrv,Bout_To_Shit_Fuck_Up,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"I think the key to having profound and eye-opening trips is to prepare ahead of time. Some key factors are.   get into a regular and consistent meditation practice, this will help you keep calm and focused and it will greatly reduce the chance and of having a bad trip. there's alot more benefits look it up. i think having a month of daily meditation practice under your belt before you trip is enough. i would do a one week juice/green smoothie, green leafy vegetables, fruit, in a blender. look up joe rogans kale shakes. have this breakfast lunch and dinner. this will help you cleanse your body and will give you a ton of energy and keep your mind clear. get regular exercise on the day you want to trip i would fast for six hours and take the mushroom on an empty stomach in silent darkness. Go into the trip with the intent ""i want to get rid of my fear and ego"" or ""how do i become love""  talk to the mushroom say hello. on your way up 30mins before the trip hits just sit and meditate."

shrooms,3dg30f,djwonderful,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:14:20 2015 UTC,I was trying to get a better look since the jar is dark. (That's a fuck up on my part. It's my first time growing and left them on the heat too long and I read something that said that using a wash cloth would help reduce cracking and I was smoking while it was on the stove. Everything else was done sterile and proper though to the best of my ability) and tbh I thought this was a failed batch. I had forgot about it until my friend mentioned shrooms. And I decided to check on them.
shrooms,3dg30f,MushroomPikmin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:17:23 2015 UTC,Well now that you opened the jar it's probably contaminated :/

shrooms,3dg30f,Poop_Scooper_Supreme,2,Thu Jul 16 02:29:57 2015 UTC,I think I got lucky cause I pretty much forgot about them. They were in a suitcase that had been moved around. The foil was off the top too. So idk. I'm hoping for the best.
shrooms,3dgtgc,goldmembersP,3,Thu Jul 16 03:57:52 2015 UTC,"You've asked for cheapest way to grow, but there's quite a few qualifiers here. Buying mad bags is certainly not economical in the long run, neither is pftek. Getting a pressure cooker, bulk buying grain, and doing Monotub grows that yield 3-4 dry oz per tub will likely be the most bang for your buck.  However, if you don't have the money to invest, then a mad bag with a sclerotia producing species in a spore syringe will be the cheapest up front cost."
shrooms,3dgtgc,ygbplus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:07:14 2015 UTC,How much would you say all the stuff for monotubs are all together? Also it's kind of hard to source stuff like coir and manure.
shrooms,3dgtgc,ygbplus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know, 2-300 bucks for the outset, but that would get you everything you need for multiple grows."

They taught me a lot but I won't be doing them again (I'd still recommend them as a good place to start though, just for the education). Going to monotubs and grain spawn really isn't hard. I haven't had any problems with my grain (WBS) so far, and doing g2g transfers to knock up new jars is super easy and fast. Also the monotub is different from the SGFC for pf tek, so if you just start with a monotub you can save yourself the cost and effort of making a SGFC. For yield and speed, pf tek doesn't come close to monotubs."
shrooms,3dgskj,Jediflipper,2,Thu Jul 16 03:49:38 2015 UTC,"Most of the things said are going to come down to preference. Some people swear by all of them for their own reasons and others swear against others. It's whatever man. I usually eat them as they are, maybe throw em on a slice of pizza (since I don't have a beef with empty stomach biz), or just whatever. If you have a weak or the like kind of stomach I might say something with ginger because they do make your tummy rumble and I imagine many people get nauseous, but again, that's all just some home remedy stuff to help with psychedelics you could find anywhere on the internet. I don't mind the taste at all, so long as I feel fine physically, but the texture can be weird, so food can help with that, but they just taste kind of woody/earthy, which I like (so naturally they're good with most any meal food :D. tacos pizza burger YOU NAME IT, just avoid burning them I'd imagine. just warm, or put them on right when you're ready to eat them. And eating on a (kinda) full stomach can mean a longer time for it to kick in, but most references (like erowid) also say that chewing them and holding them in your mouth with lead to a quicker onset, so that's up to you, but reaalllyy dude, unless you have a schedule to stick to, I just wouldn't worry about it, and just go with what makes you comfortable). good lluck :D I had 3 little mushrooms and an extra half a cap (not sure what the weight together was) and a tab of some bomb ass acid I have and had a grand ol' time, no issues with the body load or anything, just a bit trouble sleeping, and my stomach gurgled a lot (was also very gassy eheheh), but aside from that, all fun :D.

Although at a really heroic dosage, the system would break down because you'd be to fucked to read that shit lol who...who wrote all this alien gibberish on my...ha...hand, man...."
shrooms,3db9vk,rhizomorphicoreos,10,Tue Jul 14 23:34:23 2015 UTC,"HAHA, very true. It would be nice to have that reminder. I've had a few trips where the anxiety lasted a little too long. But no doubt, once you go past the heroic dosage, some writing on a hand would not be enough.  The first time i tried 7g, for about 2 hours(but it felt like it was never ending) I had every memory that has ever been stored in my head flashing in front of my eyes all at what seemed like the same time. I seen shit that I forgot that i even forgot about. And at that point, crouched on the couch in the fetal position in almost complete darkness, no writing on my hand was going to change the overwhelming feeling that I was going through. At the time it felt like a horrible trip, but ended up being one of the most powerful trips i've ever had. I've had amazing 7-8.5g trips several times since and never have I had that happen to me again. But I will get there again, so i keep upping the dose."

Some farmer joke about a goat's balls or something. And I like felt a light come out of the top of my head (I can't even explain what that was) and I was back lying on the couch.

I would take it either as soon as I woke, or right before walking into the office. It's not like I was super tripping out, but that day it hit me a little too noticeably. It was distracting as fuck and I kept spacing out. I seem to get long lasting benefits from massive doses spread out over long periods of time than small doses over short periods."
shrooms,3db9vk,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:14 2015 UTC,"Did you microdose every day?  I think tolerance builds too quickly at everyday intervals, every other day is enough so tolerance stays steadier... At least in my experience"

shrooms,3db9vk,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:18:00 2015 UTC,Woow thats a big microdose. It's obviously very very subjective to who's taking it but I've been thinking about starting an organised microdose schedule and I was gonna go with around .2 or .3 at most for the first couple weeks or so. I would probably be distracted by slight visuals at .9

In the same way, I just don't see myself 'forgetting' that I am tripping. I would just become completely immersed in the experience, not questioning whether I'm tripping or not. Does that mean I 'forget' I'm tripping? Who knows? Who cares?  It's just a giant pissing contest for people to say 'well you haven't done enough yet because you didn't feel what I felt'. I'm sure I could come up with something I've gone through and tell other's they just haven't done enough because they haven't experienced what I've experienced. It's just a stupid comment and people shouldn't brag about 'tripping hard enough'.   I see my original comment sounds like I don't believe people can forget, and that's not what I meant. I just have never personally felt like I needed a reminder, so I'm actually not sure how people 'forget' they are on something.   On 'high' mushroom doses (which is relative I guess), I just become completely immersed in the moment. Does that mean I 'forget' I'm on mushrooms?"

I've definitely needed to remind myself, you're just on mushrooms, you'll be back to normal in 6 'normal' hours. Since I need to remind myself, does that mean I somehow forgot I was on them? I've also been 100% immersed in the 'now' while tripping. Is that 'forgetting' you're on mushrooms? 'Forgetting' I'm tripping, I'm just not sure what that would even mean to me.

Just wondering because I recently finished three tubs also using Damions tek and got about 12oz total but I only used three jars of spawn per tub and I was thinking about trying more spawn on my next go to see if it would increase my yields.
shrooms,3datri,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:33:37 2015 UTC,Won't increase yield but it will speed up colonization time a lot. That much spawn probably ripped through the sub like fire

Make sure no one will bother you and scare you (family, etc)  make sure youre in a safe place. Have some kind of safety phrase written somewhere. (Example : ""its just mushrooms"" written on your hand). I wouldnt reccommend trippjng anywhere public. Dont listen to heavy metal... dont watch scary movies.

shrooms,3ddw3p,itsathrowawayspencer,2,Wed Jul 15 14:51:38 2015 UTC,"You can trip whenever you want, you will just need to up the dose. That being said, I'm not sure how much tolerance is even there after a week. At that point who's to say it isn't 'in your head', as in, the trip might just feel not as intense because you just had a mushroomy experience a week prior.   I wouldn't drastically up the dose after a week, but if you felt like you could do more than the first time, why not?  If you enjoyed 2g, 2g a week later shouldn't be too different. But if you want to go a little deeper / make sure it's just as potent as the first time, you can always bump the dose to 2.5g.  I don't have a ton of experience testing the strength of 'tolerance', but mushrooms vary so much trip to trip it would be a hard thing to test for anyways (too many factors will influence the 'intensity' of a mushroom trip, and it would be nearly impossible to isolate how much of that is caused by tolerance after a week break) . What I would do is just re-dose the same amount, wait an hour and a half and make a judgement call on re-dosing or just riding it out."

All I can think of when people do things like this is Terrence McKenna who built his whole life assuming mushrooms had the answer to the universe, and when they finally showed him the nothingness at the end of the tunnel, his whole life kind of collapsed (yes, this guy who tells everyone to take heroic doses of mushrooms in the dark, he eventually stopped tripping after having a terrifying experience that shook him to the core).

shrooms,3d88qr,FelidiaFetherbottom,2,Wed Jul 15 14:40:28 2015 UTC,"Just to let you know, 1 gram is a very light dose, some people don't feel any effects on it, so with that being said, a couple things:  Some people DO have intense trips on low doses, so don't let me discourage you, but since you have a babysitter, if you have more than that, you might want to think about redosing if you don't feel any effects or very low effects after an hour or so, or maybe even starting out with a higher dose (2-2.5).  If you go the whole night on the 1 gram and feel almost nothing, so you want to do a higher dose, wait at least one week.  Tolerance to psilocybin increases extremely rapidly.  Don't want you saying the shrooms.  But it also decreases very rapidly, so a week (or preferably 2) should be plenty.  You can redose a couple hours later, and if you do, I would suggest about 2 more grams (by then that first gram has almost run its course, so you won't really be having a 3 gram trip).  Good luck either way, they honestly changed my life and I recommend them to anybody who hasn't tried them.  I would suggest growing them if money/space allows, that way you can always have access."

I understand that abusing the substance can lead to unwanted effects, but not really on the same magnitude of Other schedule 1 drugs such as Cocaine or Methamphetamine. In order to be schedule 1 in the US, a substance must have no medicinal value, an extreme risk for long term dependence, and no accepted safe use even under medical supervision.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of medical professionals, I don't think it can meet any of those criteria. Its used to treat cluster headaches, is proven to be very low risk for dependence, and is pretty safe in terms of usage. This boggles my mind sort of. Im in Canada and its Schedule 3 Here."

For an individual to be diagnosed with HPPD, the symptoms cannot be due to another medical condition.

shrooms,3dcxdm,richpop98,3,Wed Jul 15 07:57:58 2015 UTC,"7jars of spawn and 11jars of substrate   That's a little less than 1:2 which is fine.   Once all 18 quarts are colonized i then case it.   That doesn't make sense. Once the grain spawn is colonized you then mix or layer it with the substrate. Once that is fully colonized you could optionally case it with a thin layer of inert casing material. * or I guess you could mean once the mix is colonized. I'm tired and it seemed like you meant they'd colonize separately like you were injecting spores into substrate.   To me it sounds like to much risk of contam exposing it twice.   You're only exposing the grain spawn after it has been fully colonized and that can be exposed to open air as the fresh mycelium is resistant to competing organisms as it has taken hold of the food source. The substrate will be pasteurized and hence is free to be exposed to open air.   Or do you case it and put the other 11 in at same time.   ಠ_ಠ what the fucking fuck does that mean. That sentence is insane. You either have your terms confused or you're confused about the process you're attempting or both.  *edit- do you mean can you put a casing layer on before the spawn/substrate mix is colonized?  If that's what you mean, yeah I guess. You'd just have to be patient while waiting for it to colonize. Probably wait for pins before introducing FAE. May get a few more aborts that way, but you'd be better off. You know you don't really need the casing layer, right? You could just fruit as is. I use a thin casing of vermiculite and maybe a sprinkle of peat moss. A very thin layer right before fruiting it."
shrooms,3dcxdm,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:08:29 2015 UTC,Nvm mind my post this is what i am going to do. 3+ 1/2 jars of spawn for each monotub (2tubs). And then 15 more for sub. After i mix it and its colonized i will case it. Does that make more sense. Sorry the post was made when i woke up at 3 am Edit: ive read that casing cubes doesnt do much but help with humidity and pin set so im going to try the cash casing tek lol
shrooms,3dcxdm,CannabinoidConcentr8,3,Wed Jul 15 11:57:46 2015 UTC,"No, this makes even less sense. WTF are you even doing? What tek are you following?  Let your grain spawn fully colonize. Once it's at 100%(it is now resistant to contams and can be allowed in open air), mix it evenly with your prepped and pasteurized substrate. I used 10qts spawn to 10qts substrate and had great results. Once that is fully colonized, you can introduce fruiting conditions and case it if you want, but casing is not necessary for cubes."
shrooms,3dcxdm,CannabinoidConcentr8,0,Wed Jul 15 12:22:51 2015 UTC,"So I have 7 jars of spawn fully colonized and 30 pasturized sub. I mix that together with a ratio of 1:4, in 2 tubs.

I feel bad for your fiancee, and hopefully the experience didn't ruin mushrooms for her."
shrooms,3dba4c,ZornsLemmon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed myself. I think it's just a personal preference. I am very excited to do it again honestly.   I felt bad for her as well. It took her a couple of weeks to finally get over what happened. She has gone floating on the river since and taken shrooms since, so I don't feel there were any adverse affects.   You are correct, it is definitely not for everyone. If you can't handle that intense of a trip, tube shrooming is not for you."
shrooms,3dba4c,ZornsLemmon,2,Wed Jul 15 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"Taking a couple of weeks to get over an experience is definitely an adverse effect in my book.   And your 'if you can't handle that intense...' statement just propagates the pissing contest that psychedelics are some sort of 'test' where handling your shit is some indication of personal prowess.   I personally would love shrooming while tubing (on a low dose), but the point is to not try to force it on others (not saying you did this to your fiancee). Just because someone would rather just float a river doesn't mean they can't handle that intense of a trip, it just means they don't want to be tripping while tubing down a river.   If someone didn't consider themselves a great swimmer, for instance, or they had a fear of drowning, that doesn't mean they 'can't handle' an intense trip, it just means that tubing while tripping is a bad idea for them.   Also, obligatory, tubing is already dangerous, tripping while tubing only amplifies that. I've been tubing and had some totally zonked girl, stranded from her group, join our floating group. She then proceeded to get dragged underneath us, dragging along the rocks at the bottom, and eventually left us and was still stranded from her group. Fun times?"
shrooms,3dba4c,ZornsLemmon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:49:20 2015 UTC,"That was my point, sorry if I wasn't clear.   The intensity of the trip stems from being able to handle shrooms while having to swim, navigate a river, and possibly interacting with other people, and the like. It's not for everyone.   I'm sure some peopld don't want to be tripping while tubing down a river, but in that case they shouldn't do it. I imagine other people would love to do it, but just can't handle it. And then even others... can handle it and will do it. There's a whole spectrum.   I am not someone who thinks psychedelics are a test of personal prowess. If anything, I think it's not for everyone. For people that it speaks to, that is great, but it's definitely a personal thing.   Thank you for your insight in the matter. I hope this post helps other people who might be thinking about this kind of a trip."

shrooms,3d9fou,Slap-Jackalope,2,Tue Jul 14 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"Ended up not feeling much at all other than a small bodyload. Super disappointed, but shit happens haha  A friend came round and brought with him some 5-meo-mipt. That certainly kicked it up a gear; but other than that, seems like they were dud shrooms :("
shrooms,3d9fou,Slap-Jackalope,2,Wed Jul 15 00:09:29 2015 UTC,Bummer man. Did you buy from a new person or something or is your dealer just unreliable?
shrooms,3d8efh,Big_Man_Ran,3,Tue Jul 14 08:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking tolerance might be it but you seem to have had long breaks in between.  Try go on a tolerance break from LSD, Mescaline and shrooms (any psychedelic really), for a month and then try 3.5g dried.  Maybe it was the mushrooms you had. Do you grow them yourself or do you hunt?"
shrooms,3d8efh,Mrwazztazz,2,Tue Jul 14 11:36:24 2015 UTC,Ive had almost a 3 month break from lsd and 8 months from shrooms -never had another psychedelic.  Grown myself (4th or 5th grow overall).  3.5 g never did anything for me - my bare minimum was 7g dried or 70 wet.  Hopefully when I take 14g dried I'll experience the magic again.
shrooms,3d8efh,Mrwazztazz,3,Tue Jul 14 11:43:29 2015 UTC,"sheeeit, 14g! If that really doesn't work then I think maybe it's time to hang up the phone and come back to it later in your life.  But yeah it's definitely not a tolerance issue. It could potentially be other medications/drugs that are weakening the effect. According to this table, alcohol, opiods, as well as MAOI's and SSRI's among others can all potentially decrease the effect of shrooms.  My last guess must be in the shrooms that you grow. Whether buying from a dealer or the darknet markets will help, I dunno."
shrooms,3d8efh,digdog303,2,Tue Jul 14 12:22:23 2015 UTC,Well said!
shrooms,3d8efh,digdog303,2,Tue Jul 14 22:58:21 2015 UTC,Dayum. At those doses I would be losing my shit. 2 tabs is almost too much for me sometimes. Are you on any pharma or taking supplements?
shrooms,3d8efh,WoundTrack,2,Tue Jul 14 21:45:45 2015 UTC,"No drugs or supplements - just a natural tolerance to anything I take.  I have a weird brain chemistry where I can't get addicted to anything and it takes alot of anything to affect me - be it sleeping pills or opiates.  I smoked cigs for years just so I can have a smoke break at my then job and just stopped one day with no desire for a smoke.  I was prescribed painkillers and after a month I stopped taking them with no desire to take more.    I hate alcohol as that's the only thing that I feel sensitive to.  One drink and I'm throwing up (not drunk, just sick)"
shrooms,3d95wn,drtybubba,3,Tue Jul 14 13:59:20 2015 UTC,"Those look exactly nothing like magic mushrooms.  You say you've lurked here a while. People post pics of psilocybin cubensis on an almost daily basis. A three second google image search will show you what magic mushrooms look like. If you are really interested, do a bit of research! Also, try growing your own. It's not hard and having a reliable source is awesome.   If you just want an ID, head over to /r/mycology. I really hope I'm not coming off as mean, because that is not my intention at all. It's just that there are at least a dozen posts a day asking if all sorts of random shrooms are active that could be answered by a quick google image search, and it gets frustrating."

I've done some reading on shroomy.org and it looks like these are the shrooms that are most likely to be found in Ohio:  Ohio   Gymnopilus aeruginosus Gymnopilus junonius Gymnopilus luteofolius Gymnopilus luteus Panaeolus cinctulus Pluteus americanus Psilocybe caerulipes Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata   Before I picked these mushrooms, they looked almost exactly like the shrooms in this photo (Panaeolus cinctulus): http://files.shroomery.org/files/14-47/652549748-IMG_0953.jpg   I then had to run some errands, so I wasn't able to get a photo right away. The photo was taken probably 2 hours after they were picked, and the caps did not look all curled up like that when I picked them...  Most of the shrooms in that list seem to grow in or on mulch / dead wood, and i found these in a mulch bed...so that is why I was curious.   Like I said, I didn't really think that they were what I am looking for, but I just wanted to check.  -Peace!"

shrooms,3d5oau,canned_salmon,2,Mon Jul 13 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"Great TR, very fun to read. I feel like too many people that I read about or talk to take shrooms for personal or cosmic revelations...while I've had one or two truly spiritual, soul-expanding trips, I think shrooms work best when taken at a moderate dose (3.5 grams is my sweet spot), not intending to solve life's troubles but just to have a good time and connect with people you love. 10/10 would read again."
shrooms,3d5oau,canned_salmon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:50:02 2015 UTC,While the personal revalations are extremely meaningful and I would not trade them for the world... shrooms have just as much ability to support a fun innocent trip as well! Depending on what you want from them shrooms can be used for a few different main reasons!  I'm glad you found your lane man thats awesome to hear! I would like to read one of your trip reports if you choose to write one next time!  Thank you so much for the compliment by the way it means alot!
shrooms,3d5oau,tehKreator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:08:29 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, there are many valid reasons to take shrooms (and who am I to say which are in-valid???); I guess what I meant is that the simple experience of increased zen, joy, and friendship is often overlooked for heavier reasons. While shrooms shouldn't be taken lightly, I think peeps miss out when they always take them too seriously.  I'm currently growing for the first time, I'll post a report when I'm able to partake of the fruit of my own labor :) Thanks for the correction."

shrooms,3d81i8,Robosheeeiiit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:05:05 2015 UTC,"So after doing brief research it doesn't seem like this drug has any activation in your serotonergic receptors. For that reason there should be no chemical interference that would cause problems. However epilepsy does make you prone to seizures from things like flashing lights or maybe high anxiety situations. So I would advise you to first see that your epilepsy is not that severe, if it is then psychedelics may be a bit much to handle. But good thing you asked about this. There are people who regularly take SSRIs and will take a psychedelic and have a seizure in result because of the mixed responses in the serotonin receptors."
shrooms,3d81i8,InSovietChicago,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that it's too severe, seeing as I've only had 2 seizures over the course of 4 months.  Thank you for the information though!"
shrooms,3d6qtb,stay_private,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:26:08 2015 UTC,"I am a man in my upper 30s who has had extremely limited exposure to any drugs.  I don't like weed.  Any opioid makes me itch like a stay dog and dry heave off the back porch.  So, I don't do drugs.  I am a product of Nancy Reagan.    I am also a business owner with brands in the US and Ireland, a stay-at-home parent, and I like to hang out with my friends whenever I get the rare chance.  I've always had a struggle with depression, especially when stress is applied to my life.  With everything going on around me (my twin daughters are only 2; my business has exploded in the past couple of years, and I struggle to keep up; my social life has taken a shit), stress has been piling up.  And so has the depression.  And the anxiety.  Oh, the anxiety.  This is something new in my world.  I didn't realize how much SUCK is in anxiety until it hit me.  What's worse is I can't predict it or plan for it. One day, I might as well be on a beach next to the ocean, sipping pina coladas.  The next, I might as well be in the ocean, sharks swimming about.    My doctor gave me some antidepressants, but like I said, I'm not much of a drug taker.  Antidepressants have only a very slight advantage over placebos, which tells me you have to believe in them for them to work.  And I don't really believe in them all that much.  I happened across an article a while back about how mushrooms are being studied on patients with PTSD, anxiety and depression, and are going through the end of life.  A single massive dose, from what I read, can re-wire the brain and give the patient a very long-lasting ""cure.""   So, I decided that maybe it's something I can do to treat myself.  A single dose of shrooms to make me operate better in my day-to-day life with no chance of ODing?    I then discovered microdosing, which also sounds like a godsend.    So, I came up with a plan.  I am going to take one good tripping dose of 3g or so.  Then, every Monday and Thursday, I will take a microdose of .3g or less.    I created a plan, now I need the drug.  But I am as WASP as they come and don't know the first thing about buying illicit substances.  I've done some networking, but it really hasn't led anywhere.  But then I started reading this sub and was given the advice about Teks.  I read up on it, ordered my spores, and did my inoculation today!  The only problem is that I couldn't find brown rice flour, so I used whole rye flour instead.  I don't know if that is what is making my jar darker looking than what was in the Tek, but I followed everything else exactly.  I have a pressure cooker and jars anyway (I'm a gardner and canner... see?  WASP.), so the process was actually really cheap.  I think I spent $6 in vermiculite and flour.    I decided to go with Penis Envy for the shroom.  Half of you say they are more potent than any other shroom, the other half say that that is bullocks and a Cube is a Cube.  I guess I'll find out, won't I?  I'll keep everyone updated with my progress with growing.  Here's hoping everything was sanitary!"
shrooms,3d6qtb,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"Hey man, that's a big decision you're making for yourself and I do hope you get what you're looking for. Many have found relief from depression with psilocybin, but try not to take it while depressed, eh? It's kinda a catch 22.  Rye flour will work, and it's a good thing you've got a pressure cooker as rye flour tends to have more endospores present than rice flour. Boiling them rarely works.  But....  You picked the most pain-in-the-ass cube imaginable. They actually are a smidge more saucy- but they're a frustrating bitch to grow on cakes. They just don't get down well with PF tek for some reason. Make sure to ""dunk and roll"" as the cakes performance will improve a lot, especially with that mutant bastard penis envy. The first flush will be blobs. They'll be just as good as regular mushies, just...well...blobs. I have a post on /r/Shrooms (titled ""pssst...wanna see my balls?"") with a pic if what the blobs look like. Again, it's just the first flush. The second flush will be more normal. Just make sure your fresh air exchange is good- that's really the big key- worry about air first, humidity second (people tend to over-emphasize the importance of humidity. It's important that it's not dry in your tub, but don't be that guy spraying the fuck outta the tub and ruining their work.) Just set up your SGFC (your fruiting chamber) right and then leave 'em alone for the most part.  I really want you to be successful so at least you can know for sure if this route of medicine will improve the quality of your life. Feel free to PM me with any questions-  Good luck and may the spores be with you. 🍄  Edit- heres the pic so you don't have to look for it"
shrooms,3d6qtb,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"Great... I pick the hardest one to grow.  I didn't realize that.    How do/did you pick your blobs?    I'm also doing a diet/exercise regime change as well.  In my upper 20s/younger 30s (when I had no responsibilities), I worked out all the time.  But when the real responsibilities come – when you are responsible for others' lives (kids, employees, etc), the self care seems to get pushed back.    I know the shrooms won't be a cure-all, but they will be a piece of the pie.  That's why I'm planning on maintaining with just microdoses.  To each his own and all, but I don't understand why you would want to trip over and over again.    Anyway, yeah.  Thanks for the advice!  I'll keep the sub updated with my progress (or lack thereof)."
shrooms,3d6qtb,Big_Man_Ran,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:36:00 2015 UTC,"Well it's not that hard, lol And you just twist and pull the blobs the same way you'd harvest a regular mushroom. From my own experience blobs tend to be pretty potent. You're not some kid with no sense so you'll have no problems. It's just a tad less forgiving of bad conditions. But you'll get it set up fine.  I'm rooting for ya! You can do it! Haha :) it's fun, you're in for a treat."
shrooms,3d6qtb,Big_Man_Ran,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:55:22 2015 UTC,Consider doing a bulk grow (search for dub tub) and using a different strain.  My first ever grow was cambodian and penis envy - 10 jars each.  The cambos did well but the penis envies did NOTHING.  I recently did the dub tub (wbs to coir and peat moss casing) and 1 jar had more on the first flush than the entirety of any other grows I've done with the half pint jars (pf tek)
shrooms,3d6qtb,Big_Man_Ran,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:45:03 2015 UTC,Forgot to mention - I've never found brown rice flour either - but I've made it with brown rice and a $10 coffee grinder.
shrooms,3d6qtb,Big_Man_Ran,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:47:16 2015 UTC,"I definitely second the mono tub, but idk about the penis envy's. Did they not grow, or did they just not have an effect when you ate them? If they didn't grow maybe you just got a bad syringe and if you didn't get an affect maybe they weren't penis envy's. For my first grow I was looking for those and couldn't find them anywhere that would ship to my state (still need to get some), which makes me think they're rare so maybe the supplier just claiming to have PEs."
shrooms,3d6qtb,Big_Man_Ran,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:58:28 2015 UTC,They colonized all 10 jars they were put in (albeit slowly) and when it was time for birthing they just didn't do anything.  No contams or weird colors - after a month in the chamber they started to rot and I threw them away.  I got 1 or 2 tiny shrooms off of them altogether (about an inch long) and the Cambodians that were in the same FC as them did wonderfully.  I've heard that PE's are more potent but they're just not a reliable choice- ESPECIALLY for a first timer.
shrooms,3d6qtb,digdog303,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:19:17 2015 UTC,"Oh man that's interesting. I guess the PE's really are difficult to grow, maybe they needed a different substrate. Growing mushrooms is really interesting, I was so nervous doing all my sterile procedures and ended up stabbing myself with the syringe during inoculations. But I was surprised to find the 32 half pints colonized just fine. Then I did g2g from these half pints with almost equal amount of fuckup, but those 40+ quart jars came out just fine too. Basically, mushrooms have been very kind to me,  I'm glad I didn't end up finding PEs when I started and get discouraged at them not growing. Then there's the whole thing of isolating a good strain from your own batch and all kind of cool cultures and grow teks, it's actually really fun and sciency"

shrooms,3d5upw,nachoknuckles,14,Mon Jul 13 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"I think you had a bad trip, yeah. But I also think it was a relatively mild one too. I think you controlled your bad trip well and that it could have gone way worse. When I bad trip, it starts out just like you, wors gut feeling, ""oh shit this is too much right now.."" and then if I let the bad trip go ahead of me it gets much worse. I get freaky visuals and intrusive thoughts and time loops and such.   All in all, yep, it was a bad trip. But you handled it pretty well. It may/may not happen again, just be careful with the set&settings !  trip safe."
shrooms,3d5upw,tehKreator,6,Mon Jul 13 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"That could be come-up anxiety also. Some beginners fear for what to come right after they ingest, and it kind of facilitates a feeling of anxiety through the entire trip. Im kind of more experienced but am familiar with this feeling. I had an excruciatingly bad trip on LSD and if I dose with mushrooms, Ill often get come up anxiety, and it can ruin the entire trip. you just got to keep in mind that everything is going to be okay, its just a drug, itll wear off, and you purposely took this substance for whatever reason. Think of the people you love, think about the good things in your life, and realize that you have no reason for feeling this anxiety.  If Im having a bad experience I remind myself that I am in a loving relationship with someone I love very much, I have a good job and a family that loves me. Suddenly things are okay and I can go on and experience the reason I took the drug in the first place. Look around on some psychedelic subreddits and read some tips on handling come up anxiety and general anxiety in your psychedelic experience.  Thats my 2 cents, and I hope it helps you."
shrooms,3d5upw,Sporelock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"Just a thought but, Sometimes people who are tripping and having a difficult time try and think of loved ones in their lives or the good things but then realize that their life is hollow and empty which puts them in a worse mood. I finally accepted I was a deeply depressed person on a more intense trip and have since tried to enrich my life and increase the love energy in the chunk of the universe I occupy."
shrooms,3d5upw,WoundTrack,6,Wed Jul 15 13:09:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like the term ""bad trip"" is a bit of a black-and-white statement, because during most trips I experience both positive and negative feelings at some point.   I'm sorry your first trip was more uncomfortable than you might have liked. When I feel uncomfortable, I usually put on some relaxing music or binaural beats, crawl under the soft covers, and close my eyes until it passes (which it will). It may or may not happen again, but if it does, plan on some coping skills to help yourself calm down: make some tea and snack before the trip, queue a playlist of relaxing music, call a friend who knows what's happening, etc."
shrooms,3d5upw,myceli-yum,5,Mon Jul 13 22:05:28 2015 UTC,"I once heard to think of a ""safe word."" Just any word that you think would be effective, and keep thinking of it. It's amazing how easy it is to distract yourself from these bad thoughts just by switching topics in your mind. The hard part is remembering to, I've been deep into the rabbit hole before myself and sometimes it's difficult to even think about how easy it is to change the situation.  My word is ""moonbeams."" It always makes me think of beautiful moon beams, shining through cracks in the ceiling of a dusty barn or something. By the time I've imagined that whole thing, my bad thoughts are long gone!"
shrooms,3d5upw,bub166,3,Tue Jul 14 00:03:28 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea. My mantra for myself when I'm in a pinch (including tripping): ""This too shall pass.""

Remember that you're in control. Often times, when tripping with friends at my house, if someone starts having anxiety, I tell them to remember that the trip ends. Always remember that nothing lasts forever, and that this moment is fleeting.  Generally, thinking about something larger or greater than yourself like time or the universe evokes the ""out of body/third person"" perspective that tends to quell your anxiety as you mentally wander. Through distraction, rationalization, or acceptance that this goal is achieved likely varies from person to person, but the end result is the same."

shrooms,3d7idi,Cranberr1es,0,Tue Jul 14 03:31:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, expect more contaminates. Boiling is no way a substitute for a pressure cooker. Put enough water in there so no water gets into your jars and the rest is self explanatory."

shrooms,3d7mvt,A-Frank28,3,Tue Jul 14 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"Four grams is a good trip, but I don't know what you're idea of ""deeper"" is. ""Strainds"" are meaningless for the most part. Penis envy is the slightly more prized cubensis. Then there's other species of hallucinogenic mushrooms.  It's unlikely for you to come across in typical local dealer settings, but they can be grown/hunted. Psilocybe Azurescen is my all time favorite. These can be grown, but only outdoors because of the very specific conditions they require. And they can only be grown in the right areas (places that get really cold around early fall). Then there's hundreds of species I can only dream of coming across one beautiful day.   But as far as you're concerned you're probably gonna get some redish goldish orangish brownish capped cubensis. Unless the DNMs have some really cool shit, which I doubt. Maybe you can find cyans or pan cams or something, and if you do go for that.  As for tips, go outside and do something. Hiking, biking, fishing (maybe if you're handy with a hook- otherwise I'd avoid that one).  Or stay inside and crank some chill music and play some easy games that don't require being all that coordinated or giving a shit. Or do both. I dunno, it's not a big deal. You've done psychedelics so you know about the weirdness...and what Hunter S. Thompson would call ""the fear"". Just be open to the new experience and have a blast as best you can. Although you can expect occasional uncomfortable feelings, thought/time loops.  But four g's is an easy dose. I don't bother with any less than five. I'm not a fan of small doses. There's something shitty about them. There's a threshold you cross at some point where things become blissful and beautiful. For me, at least, The smaller two gram doses are terrible. I think a lot of people take and recommend lower doses out of fear of ""bad trips"", but every terrible trip I had was a low dose trip type thing. Good luck with everything, hope all goes well."

shrooms,3d8hyv,XanderTheMander,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:36:17 2015 UTC,"I'd make a set up to dry them as best as possible. The drier you can get them, the more likely you can ensure that they will last until you want to use them.  Moisture in the mushrooms is what will cause them to spoil, get moldy, etc."
shrooms,3d8hyv,ShroomyGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:51:32 2015 UTC,"If your room isn't too humid, you could just leave them on a shelf folded in a paper towel. Usually, I just put them on a paper towel and have a desk fan aimed at them for a day or so. I think the key is a cool dry place."
shrooms,3d7wgm,tripmassster,2,Tue Jul 14 05:11:16 2015 UTC,"No perfect way, especially as a trip can go in any direction, but here's a pretty good general description courtesy  of disregardeverythingisay: Visual Effects, Cognitive Effects, Misc. Effects."
shrooms,3d7wgm,veridikal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:29:12 2015 UTC,"It's like trying to explain what an orange tastes like to someone who's never tasted an orange. It'd be impossible for anyone to convey something so subjective on top of that, It's like telling someone exactly what a certain song is going to make them feel or think or how a piece of art is going to move them. You could base it down to a few commonalities, but you'd only be describing things we feel every day. If I had to try, and I never have, I'd fail every time. Watch:  Tripping is like all of the things that make you, your personality, your senses, your impression of yourself- everything has to restructure by means of a random act of subconscious selection. Your brain has to rewrite what it tells you ""bagel"" is. Your mood can be effected by a change in the wind. Childhood feelings come back in a way that you hardly notice at the time, you're just too wrapped up in everything else. To busy connecting everything to everything and just being.  See? Epic fail. But I'm pretty stoned. So that probably made it better. Would've been worse if I were sober."
shrooms,3d7wgm,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:04:42 2015 UTC,"It's such a subjective and varied experience...  If you are talking about just the physical effects, those have been written about extensively and are pretty common across the board.  I suppose it really depends on how interested the person you are explaining it to is in shrooms/tripping. If they are really keen, I'd recommend that they read some trip reports on erowid to get a general idea, but ultimately accept that the only way to really know is to try it themselves.  If their interest is just casual, don't bother too much. Some people just aren't interested in psychedelics.   My attempt: Everyday awareness/experience is incredibly small and narrow. On some level we all suspect that there is something more, something deeper going on, but we don't know how to access it or what it would even look like or feel like. Some people accept this and get on with everyday life, but some will always wonder... Tripping can potentially help those who are curious to peek behind the curtain. To see what there is to see. It's a grand adventure, a journey inwards and an expansion outwards, the realisation that they are the same thing, and that all the wonders of the universe are there for us to experience, if only we allow ourselves to.  bleh. Talking about the transcendental is haaaaard!"

shrooms,3d87qx,richpop98,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:01:17 2015 UTC,Why would be the reason to plant it outside? Could it help heal itself or something?

shrooms,3d87qx,richpop98,2,Wed Jul 15 07:20:16 2015 UTC,I think those fruits should be fine. I say plant it outside becasue sometimes the mycelium does heal it self and expands outward and takes a little bit of the good nutes to make one last flush

shrooms,3d4n71,Whtfawvy,3,Mon Jul 13 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"I have to be honest and say I'm disappointed in this album. I have been a huge Tame Impala fan since Innerspeaker came out, but this album doesn't have the same zing to it. It honestly seems like something a million pop artists could have come up with. I miss the psychedelic guitar riffs, insane drum solos, and Kevin Parker's magical vocals. Currents lacks these things. Lonerism is amazing. Their best work of art IMO. I don't even mind when artists switch things up, but I feel like Tame Impala is only going backwards."

Just positive vibes from every song and a real psychedelic aesthetic.  Edit: Daft Punk-Within  IMO another good one from that album. The whole song (even down to the lyrics) evokes a sense of outer-dimensionality that resonates perfectly with the psychedelic experience.  ""There's a world within me that I cannot explain/many rooms to explore but the doors look the same/I am lost I can't even remember my name""  I'm convinced that the song is on some level meant to serve as a double meaning for psychedelic exploration."

You need some maturity and life experience behind you before you indulge in shrooms, and I think that doing them too early can be extremely detrimental to both your mental growth and your relationship with psychedelics.

I  recently tried pyschedilics again (real LSD and shrooms on different days) and had a great time. Set and setting are very important, for you I would suggest doing a small dose. Nothing wrong with not ""matching"" the doses your friends take. I'm sure you have a great time.

If you check them constantly you're going to get sketched out at every little thing.- ""is that myc right on that edge there? It looks kinda whispy...I hope it's not mold..."" If you're seeing healthy growth at any rate your job's done. You did well, now let nature take over. You could colonize a cake with two spores. (It'd take a long time but it'd work). There's nothing to worry about, it's gonna be fine, go find something else to occupy your time.  Checking them constantly makes it feel like forever.

Making a time lapse has actually helped me be more patient becaue I can see how far it goes each day. If you can do it give it a chance, even if you just kind of take a picture on your phone (and delete it afterward so you don't have photos of growing shrooms on your phone) everyday."

shrooms,3d6egj,KickedinTheDick,3,Mon Jul 13 22:21:58 2015 UTC,^ correct answer.
shrooms,3d6egj,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:52:32 2015 UTC,"u/KickedinTheDick has it dead on right. Tolerance is greatly over rated.    The psilocin experience is by its nature a variable thing so much so that any tolerance you might get from one small trip, if it has any effect at all (I say it won't) you wouldn't be able to sort it out from how variable the shroom thing is in the first place.  I can't tell you how many times I've gotten of to a mild trip, while wild picking, and then gotten of to a heroic dose later that same day."
shrooms,3d6egj,BarryZZZ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:37:56 2015 UTC,With lsd small doses within 3 days of a larger dose had a noticeable effect on the trip/tolerance. I assume it would be the same for shrooms.

shrooms,3d5rcy,RuffRyderRoll,3,Mon Jul 13 19:10:26 2015 UTC,"I think there is cross-tolerance between LSA and shrooms, but any psychedelic tolerance typically doesn't last more than 2 weeks at the most, so in your case you shouldn't have had tolerance to psychedelics if you last tripped 2-3 weeks before. I would then think that weak shrooms would probably be the culprit"

There's nothing inherently wrong with kits- it just depends on whether you want an experience or a hobby. If you plan to make a hobby out of it, you'll start to see what people are talking about- for an extra fifty bucks more than the kit would cost (roughly) you can literally grow for the rest of your life without ever ordering another thing off the web. But if you just want some shrooms and don't really see yourself doing it long term, or even off and on, you may as well save the $$ and get the kit.  All about what you're thinking.  now get growing!"

Generally I make sure I get orange juice, mango juice, yogurt, wheat germ, hemp seeds, turkey (tryptophan), banana (same), spinach (same) to maintain an essential balance of what is needed to stay fresh.  Dark chocolate helps as well. You have to watch out for caffeine, about 3 hours after you get some withdrawal can bring on that drowsy dopey feeling.

In a time and space far removed from here and now, we'll all be whole again.

Two young guys, sitting in a sheep field (where there would likely be mushrooms growing), suddenly see an angel come down from the sky. At first they are scared (I have gotten a little scared at the beginning of psychedelic journeys before and I don't think it would be that uncommon at all). Then the preacher described how they saw a beautiful light and spoke to god through this angel. That is, to me, the exact description of the experience that so many people have on shrooms.   For this story, I have no evidence. I have heard a lot of evidence for the entire religion being based on entheogenic compounds, and that Jesus himself was a shaman. There is apparently a lot of evidence that mushrooms were an important part of many cultures all around the world pre-christ. I just don't think the possibility is too far out there, given the story. And personally, I think it's a hell of a lot more likely that they were on mushrooms than they actually saw and spoke to god sober."

Another myth says that Jacob, in a dream state, crossed over to the other side to struggle with the divine and came back with a new name, Israel, knowledge and a pact, a convenent.  That sounds like a Shamanic journey if I ever heard one.  R. Gordon Wasson, to whom the Mazatec curandera Maria Sabina revealed the continued existence of the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico, believed that all ancient religious traditions have shamanic roots. If those two had never met this subreddit would not exist.  I think he was right. Now it seems you do too."

Eat an hour and a half into the trip, fruit or salad, trail mix, peanut butter and yogurt are all nice snacks while dosed.  Eat dark chocolate and have a glass of Orange juice just as you feel the trip coming on, this will produce endorphines which will turn the ""wtf is happening"" anxiety to ""this is nice"" vibes.  Eat dark chocolate and have orange juice when you feel the trip mellow or you feel unpleasant. Not too much orange juice, or you'll get an acidic belly and maybe too much sugar. I try 4oz at a time.

Almost 6 monsters later I took the same amount from the same person and literally nothing happened.   Just like any other drug there are going to be occasional bad batches. You may also need to eat more of them, stupid sounding I know but weight can produce different highs. And some people I know can only see nice visuals after smoking some pot. It's a pretty common opinion that its much better being outside than inside with shrooms, just saying.   You can try a different batch/buy it from another person or try it again with some pot.

shrooms,3d2fdk,explicitlydiscreet,-3,Mon Jul 13 02:33:34 2015 UTC,Ok....you've READ that that's supposed to be enough. Yes you'll get high but you won't trip like you should on shrooms if you take that low of a dosage. Thats basically for people to get there feet wet and to learn what to expect so you can up the dosage to the proper amount. Yes everyone reacts differently to shrooms and the high depends on some factors but for the most part 3.5 is when tripping starts. I've taken them numerous times at different dosages and 3.5 is when tripping starts.

shrooms,3d2fdk,happiefish,2,Mon Jul 13 04:08:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. Experiences with psychedelic drugs is entirely objective and we're all just doing this to feel like shit. There's no such concept as thresholds with drugs and you can expect any higher dose to be an exaggerated version of a low dose. We're all lying about our experiences to fool people into feeling crappy. There's no way you just went into it with a low dosage, unrealistic expectations and a bad mindset... It has to be that all those crazy mushroom taking hippies were really happy looking, but actually were zoning out while peeing and complaining about their numb, painted faces. You got it man, you figured out the secret.  I'm gonna go ahead and guess psychedelics aren't your thing. And that's....ok. You could just as easily assume that you're just not into it instead of assuming other  people's experiences were a lie.   had a feeling mushrooms were just ""pot 2.0"" and not the deep bullshit people claim them to be.   Yes, and alcohol is mescaline 2.6 and LSD is aspirin 1.5 and cocaine is windows 98.   At some point, we have to assume that maybe it's not everyone else that's wrong...and maybe you just had one bad experience and can't understand why, so you're just gonna assume the drug that people have been ingesting for thousands of years is actually sooper stipudz and everyone's a big stupid doodoo face.  I get that you didn't like it, but there's some big leaps of logic you're making. If I decide to start jogging and I go and buy some cool sneaks and a jogging suit and a headband- then in the morning when I head out on my first jog I fall and stub my toe, and I get super winded and cramped up, and I wanna puke, and I didn't feel the same satisfaction others claim to get from it, I don't accuse jogging of being bullshit. It just doesn't add up.   I don't like Vicodin. Other people do. I don't take Vicodin. I also don't assume the people who enjoy it are having the exact same experience as me.  People have had profound experiences with psychedelics. This is fact. They weren't laying about their flats feeling like shit. You did. And that sucks.  If you tried a larger dosage, you'd get it. It'd click. It'd all make sense in an instant. But you won't now. Because of one bad experience where the fault cannot be placed.   I dunno...it's four am and I can't sleep and I gotta get to work by six. Forgive my excess of salt. But even though the guy was being a prick by saying you were being a bitch about it- the guy's kinda right. You want a psychedelic experience? Do enough psychedelics to actually have an experience. Or don't. I don't care. But don't tell me my experiences were imaginary. Mushrooms aren't ""pot 2.0"" They're fucking mushrooms. It's so damn glib to dismiss something based on total whiney horseshit. Just another person who wanted to see what was in the water but only dipped their toes in the water and complained of the cold.  I don't mean any of this to be offensive, I just wanted to express my feelings about your assessment of psilocybin. 🍄 *and seeing how your friend has had experience with this substance, yet couldn't stop puking makes me think you guys ate some moldy shrooms, or some Amanitas (eastern yellow fly agaric have yellowish caps...) but I haven't a clue.

Who the fuck are you? I actually hope you never get to do shrooms correctly and always get bad batches. We tried to hold your hand and tell why it didn't work but if you don't want to listen to experienced people then fuck off. Now your saying we're junkies who only use drugs to have fun and that sober fun is just as good? Thanks mom!! Buddy, you came to us and asked how to use them because you couldn't figure it out yourself. The fact that you associate us with a typical good for nothing druggy is insulting. I can only speak for my self but I work 2 jobs at 60 hours a week and am taking 2 summer classes, no not because I'm behind but because I want to get ahead.

The first hour of solid tripping I was basically at the mercy of some very weird dark-colored beings that felt like they could either seduce me into carnal joy or rip me to pieces at any given moment. It was very disturbing. I felt really alone and worried for a while, until suddenly, I just wasn't. It was like a lightbulb turned on and I was immediately laughing my ass off and punching the air with glee. Such a great turnaround. It really felt like the substance was trying to show me how good the good life can be when it follows trials and tribulations."

Personally, I think grow kits are a waste of money, but I can see the appeal to someone who only wants to grow once and then move on.  Every kit is more or less the same thing. Pre-sterilized grain in a bag with a filter patch and a spore syringe. Depending on where you are, you may be able to get pre-inoculated grain trays that you could just wait and fruit.  I guess I'm saying to base your purchase on the company's reputation for shipping and good service. Otherwise it's all the same shit. 🍄"

shrooms,3cz95d,Tussthethief,3,Sun Jul 12 03:43:21 2015 UTC,Weed and acid can cause psychosis. It just depends on the person. I wouldn't be too worried about it. Just something to consider.

Sounds like you had a pretty good first time! The body high hits people differently, but its usually nothing to worry about. Sometimes you'll feel weird body sensations like being stretched, feeling heavy/light, that kind of thing. If you're having a genuinely bad physiological reaction, it won't be feeling a little funny it would be something like intense vomiting. But Ive really never heard of anyone being allergic to psilocybin. But the body high will catch you off guard if you've never felt something like it, I've found it's pretty similar among all the tryptamine hallucinogens."

They look really nasty to me, I wouldn't eat, especially since you said they aren't cracker dry and smell like dog food. You MIGHT be able to salvage some 'good' parts that are drier, less funky / black looking (although you're right, black can just be spores).   Mushrooms (cubes) should be cracker dry, gold caps, blue bruising, smell very earthy like a mushroom, not dog food.   Whoever 'dried' these did a terrible job and ruined them. Just my opinion based on what I see, though. You could eat them anyways but I would imagine it would hurt your stomach bad and you'd just throw it up anyways."

It also helps the pasteurization process in some uses. you only sterilize grain. You pasteurize substrates. Pasteurize by keeping at 145-165 degrees for 90 mins. There is also the bucket tek, and others. Just look up ""bulk substrate pasteurization"". And again, it won't smell.

shrooms,3cy2oq,snakeoil-huckster,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"Don't use a PC, fill until either halfway up jars or until bag floats. Also, spawn is the grain you sterilize and inoculate. After colonization of grain it becomes your ""spawn"" that you mix with your pasteurized substrate."

shrooms,3cy2oq,snakeoil-huckster,2,Sat Jul 11 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"You could either pot the substrate in a turkey bag or jars. Your grain should be sterilized. Your substrate should be pasteurized. Let's say you put it in a bag: you'd put a rack on the bottom or something to keep the bag off the bottom. Then you'd put in the bag. Fill with water until bag begins to rise. Turn on high heat. Once it starts to boil, turn off heat, cover and leave for 90 mins. You could also use a food thermometer to check the core temp if you want to be exact."

shrooms,3cy2oq,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:14:29 2015 UTC,"You mix your substrate, bring to field capacity (water shouldn't drip when squeezed, only a little) bag it and pasteurize.

shrooms,3cy2oq,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:54:32 2015 UTC,"The bucket tek is not using bags jars or anything, dumping in a bucket, filling with boiled water, then cover with lid over night. Squeeze out excess water with hands. I wouldn't do this with manure, at least not just manure. Coco coir would work better with maybe a 30% mix of manure. For your first time, I suggest utilizing coco coir as it's far easier to work with and less prone to contamination. Start with coir, then keep adding in new stuff like manure and straw when you know what you're doing a little better."

The reason people have shitty trips most of the time is because they're over-thinking everything and stressing themselves out.  If he smokes, let him smoke. Just advise to roll/grind up any herb he may want to smoke. It's difficult as fuck to roll a joint while tripping.  As far as food, he's not gonna be that hungry. Maybe afterwards, but probably not during the trip. If anything, some chips, pizza bagels, whatever. Stoner foods. Above all else just stop over-analyzing the possibilities.

Obviously that's roughly 1.5 grams a piece.  Expect some slightly enhanced colors, maybe a little bit of smiles and chuckles. You took a pretty low dose so don't expect flying dragons and wizards and shit- just a little background weirdness for the most part. Have fun! 🍄"

How often do you hear about someone growing mushrooms for themselves (not dealing) get in trouble for it?  If you think the potential benefits outweigh the risks (what possible situation do you ever see arising where you are caught growing?) I say go for it. If you're not selling I really don't see why you should be scared. If you're in a sketchy living environment where someone you know might tell on you or something, maybe you should wait a while before growing."

After that trip, I decided to up the dosage to 12gs. In the meantime I had a 4g trip with a friend. Now, during this trip, I briefly saw a black entity that scared the shit out of me. Think pure evil personified. After that, I was a bit shaken about the whole experience.   Now, I still wanted to do that 12g trip, but the date I had planned for it didn't work out. I have learned not to force the issue and let things flow. But I wanted to get high, so I took 3gs friday a week ago. I had a really nice trip, and made peace with that black entity. It was as if the mushroom decided to fuck with me that one time, just playing around.   So I just added up 12g + 3gs and went 15gs."

I probably walked 20 yards away before I became paranoid of the other campsites and their fires, imagining they were other tribes and that this must be how primitive people felt coming upon other tribes. So I sat down where I was. I looked back upon our campsite, where my friends were, and watched the horizon wash over in waves of color and the light from the fire danced underneath the tree where it was lit. After, what felt like and eternity, I laid down in the grass staring up at the clear night sky. Realizing I was staring into the cosmos I immediately got the sensation the earth held me up against the night sky and was pushing me through outer space, as if I was disconnected from the earth hurling through the night sky with the stars.

shrooms,3cum03,ConAcide,4,Fri Jul 10 22:21:17 2015 UTC,"I've done open-air inoculations in the past with success.  I'm going to go into a lengthy description of how I've open-air inoculated in the past before with success, but I'm going to add emphasis to the following paragraph if you want to save time and not read anything else:  Making a very, very simple still air box (SAB) will go a long way. It can be something as simple as a cardboard box with saran wrap wrapped and taped over one end and two little holes or a slot cut into another side of the box for your hands to go into and put in/take out materials to work with. Google around or search Shroomery.org for still air box inoculation tips and to learn how to make a still air box.  The main thing is to clean the room you'll be working in pretty well. I'd caution against using a bathroom, actually, as people shower, shit, shave, and piss in there. Clean it as much as you want, but that's a regularly dirty and moist place. I usually open-air inoc. in my room.  Just dust and vacuum well. No need to go crazy. Just give the room a good clean. I recommend doing this the morning of the day you'll inoculate or the day before. Wait a while after cleaning before you proceed to let any leftover dust settle and to slow down and take your time.  Definitely shut off the heat or air conditioning and close all windows and doors for that room for 20+ minutes before you'll begin working. Some people will spray a lot of Lysol (or water/bleach solution) into the air. Lysol helps to be sprayed on surfaces nearby the immediate working area. You can go the extra mile by taking a shower and changing into clean clothes while you wait the 20+ minutes for the air/Lysol to settle.  Wiping the immediate working area with 70% isopropyl alcohol and paper towels is good.  I'll usually use one of those surgical face masks that'll filter out pollen at least and I put a hat on or a bandana to tie up my hair. Latex gloves are a must, be sure to use 70% iso on your hands and arms, let dry briefly, before donning the gloves, and then once you have the gloves on wipe them again with 70% iso.  I'll also iso wipe the lids of the jars well before inoculating with the needle. I use a LOT of 70% iso and the little pre-sterilized pads come in handy for that. If you're doing open-air you really can't use too much iso alc.  You mainly want to keep the needle clean and get your inoculation down quickly and accurately. I constantly re-cap and iso wipe the needle, probably more than necessary. If you heat the needle tip to be red hot with a butane lighter, let it cool a brief moment and then wipe with iso alcohol, and before you use it to inoculate squirt just a teensy bit of spore solution to cool the needle. It may evaporate a bit/steam off, but that's OK and you're not wasting all of your spores so don't sweat it. I usually have my inoculation holes covered in masking tape and I'll just inoculate right through the tape. When you actually inoculate the jars you want them tilted slightly at an angle and you want the needle to touch the edge of the jar. This ensures that you can see the solution going into the jar and it also ensures that the solution goes in along the edge of the jar so you can more easily see signs of growth.  Basically it's common sense and being quick and accurate.  And yes, once all is said and done you can move the jars to another location.  I didn't go into what you would do with the still air box because, if you Google around, there are loads of posts on how to make simple still air boxes and how to inoculate within one. You can save time by using a simple still air box and you'll up your chances of success, but open-air inoculation just means do your best to be clean, trying to have a semi still air environment (AC/heat off, windows shut, give time for dust to settle before working) but no need to go nuts about it. So long as the room is relatively clean and you've let everything in the air settle you more or less have a still air environment and you just need to be quick, accurate, and keep the needle clean at all times.  I know I've repeated myself a bit here but I wanted to be thorough in my description."
shrooms,3cum03,negbo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:19:18 2015 UTC,"Innoculating something like a BRF jar really doesn't require a ton of preperation. As long as you are heat sterilizing the needle you are good to go. A SAB is really more for agar transfers or G2G (I do my G2G open-air in the bathroom though). The biggest sterility comes from the PC, and then the dry verm layer keeps your BRF quite safe."

shrooms,3cua46,pedrobotella,7,Fri Jul 10 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"Cannabis (weed, pot, etc.), even at very low doses (just a tiny toke even of subpar weed) when you're already tripping can REALLY potentiate (make much much stronger) the effects of psychedelics.  This could potentially cause you to become anxious and have a panic attack, or to feel uncomfortable, or it might 'reinvigorate' the trip (bringing back lots of visuals and other effects) later on into the trip. A little bit of pot could go a loooong way if you're already tripping.  If you're going to smoke weed, make sure that you've already become comfortable and used to the mushroom trip. Just take a TEENSY little hit and WAIT a long time before considering having any more. I'm serious... a little bit can really make the trip suddenly mindblowingly intense, even if it's been wearing off for a while.  So just take it slow! Oh, and because your sense of time can get really wonky on mushrooms write down the time you took a toke on a piece of paper. Usually it's safe to wait 10 or 20 minutes between tokes.  I'm only saying this because it'd suck to have too much weed and freak out on weed AND mushrooms. Just take it slow. You can always have more later, but you can't have too much and undo having too much at once.  And yes, even if you smoke all the time and have high tolerance please just start with one toke and wait! You can refer to this graph from Erowid about the effects of cannabis in a handy graphic image:   https://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_effects.shtml   So long as you don't overdo it, smoking a little bit of pot during a mushroom (or LSD trip) can be awesome and REALLY increase the visual candy."

If ppl doesnt recommend it i'll Just give the 5 to them and tripsit   If not, please link me... I'm just aimlessly browsing Reddit and kind of drunk so please forgive me.  I'd say just take it slow with the pot. One of you might be able to smoke more and feel great, but another one might smoke a tiny bit and get anxious, and the other might freak out. You never know, so it's best to just take it slow and take note of what time each of you had a toke. Better to start slow and work your way up than go all out.  Also, different people will react differently from the same shrooms at the same dose in the same setting, but if you're all splitting 5g mostly equally you should be fine... depends on the individuals, how strong the mushrooms are, how people are already feeling, etc."

So don't do like I did and trip at night then smoke an hour or two before bed time, was very uncomfortable :P A cautious little bit mid trip, long before sleepy time, is probably cool though, like most people are saying :)"
shrooms,3cua46,Dr-NguyenVanPhuoc,2,Fri Jul 10 22:24:19 2015 UTC,I almost always trip with at least a little weed. It's a critical ingredient. The weed high is totally different while tripping.   Best way to do it if you are unsure is to wait until you feel like you wish you were tripping harder and then hit some weed and enjoy some music.
shrooms,3cua46,amorphousbob,2,Sat Jul 11 01:50:44 2015 UTC,"smoking weed will influence your trip and your overall experience. when i took shrooms + mao inhibitors, the trip was oven more intense and way stronger. it was absolutely mindblowing, but make sure you feel comfortable and are in a friendly environment, or you'll have a bad time. when i took shrooms + dxm, the visuals were insane. smoking some weed slowed them down and made they feel more smoothly. i'd say smoking a little weed really improves your trip on shrooms."

There was an account of somebody on either this forum or another, great referencing here haha, who said he sauteed them for a meal and thought the heat would break down all the psilocybin and ended up tripping."
shrooms,3cu3b7,ThePsychonaut420,3,Fri Jul 10 22:30:52 2015 UTC,"Psilocybin does have a point where it will indeed breakdown, but its more robust than we think. I made mushroom tea often and always did my steeping in already boiled water after it had cooled a bit, ive also cooked with them at lower than max stove temp in a speghetti sauce, but erowid has some backing to the theory.  Q:Do high temperatures, such as boiling water, truly degrade psilocybin/psilocin? If so, at what temperature does degradation occur?  A:Psilocybin and psilocin are sensitive to oxidation, with psilocin being particularly sensitive. This process is accelerated at higher temperatures. There is no specific temperature at which this breakdown occurs, however, the longer you expose the psiloc(yb)in to a raised temperature (in the presence of oxygen or an oxidizer), the more will be degraded.  To my knowledge, there has been no study or report of anyone quantifying the amount of degradation at various temperatures. Qualitative reports however seem to indicate that less than an hour of boiling or steeping seems to have little to no effect on the potency of psiloc(yb)in water solution."

It will undoubtably contaminate.   no, that's called aerial mycelium and it occurs when the air exchange is poor. Not the end of the world, but a sign that you're not getting enough air in the tub. Make sure there are holes everywhere, especially the bottom and keep the tub at least five inches off the ground without blocking the ventilation holes. if you birth an uncolonized cake it will mold over. You'll know it's ready to birth when the visible substrate is colonized and you've waited five to seven days. There's no point in slicing them up. (?)   I guess that's it."

I'll work better with the ventilation on the fruit chamber and for the poor cakes that had no gas exchange until now, they'll have to wait a little more.  About slicing them, I once saw a man with a terrarium full of ""half cakes"", so I though this might be a desperate measure to ensure colonization :P  If one contaminated/molded cake is put in the fruit chamber (like I did for testing purposes with this one), I'll be able to see mold and different colors on the cake, right? Do you think maybe moving them outdoors might help?"
shrooms,3cty9i,rhizomorphicoreos,2,Fri Jul 10 21:11:45 2015 UTC,You could bury your cake with a half inch of soil on top and hope for something.

Psychedelics will have a tolerance that decreases exponentially each day you go without them, the max being about two weeks. Normally I give it a week, if I dosed multiple times then maybe 1.5-2 weeks. The difference from waiting 8 days versus 14 might not hugely noticeable so many times there is no need to wait a full 2 weeks."

Either way, the graph and link above will give you a better idea on how to deal with mushroom tolerance. You need to wait at least 2 weeks between trips to really feel much of anything. Sooner than that and you may get some effects, but you'll need to dose much, much higher than the last time. Personally, keeping it to once a month maximum seems to give me a full, totally magical mindblowing trip every time and I don't waste any mushrooms."

I've never ordered from there, but have known people posting here to have success with this place and others. This is just the only place I remember so you may want to Google around for cubensis/magic mushroom kits with a .ca domain.   The thing that makes these kind of kits different from the ""never buy a grow kit"" stuff that's sold in the USA is that you're actually getting dried mycelium. If you live in the USA you shouldn't buy kits because you'll need to do the PF tek from scratch anyway. Since you live in Canada, you can buy these ""just add water..."" kits legally. Things only become illegal once you actually are growing the mushrooms.  If I were in your shoes I'd take advantage of your situation and buy a kit and enjoy the tons of mushrooms you get from it. Seems like a good deal, but don't take my word for it Google around and poke around on Reddit, etc.  If you learn and do the standard PF tek with spores you'll fair even better, but with an easy option available to you who wouldn't try that?"

shrooms,3cri90,throwaway137413,2,Fri Jul 10 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"The lemon tek is just as easy as you described it, grind them up, soak in lemon juice(enough to cover the powdered shrooms and allow stiring) for at least 20 minutes, and consume! Lemon tek does come on quicker, is more intense, and gives a ""cleaner"" trip with MUCH less muscle tension(for me), but the cost is shorter duration. Eating shrooms straight I usually get a ~6-8 hour trip depending on dosage. With the lemon tek it drops down to ~4-5.5.   As for the nausea, I've never experienced any even when eating them straight. I think one of the things that may contribute to peoples nausea is that the shrooms don't taste very good. The lemon tek would help in that regard as it covers up the taste pretty well. If you're really picky dilute the lemon juice with some water, add some sugar/sweetener, and enjoy the magical lemonade!"
shrooms,3cri90,iaskforbananas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:18:58 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply! Oh shaving off a couple hours isn't all that bad. Can I really expect that duration off a measly 2G? I'm happy to hear you don't experience nausea, I've had a gram several times and never found the taste to be all that off putting (I mixed them with a handful of nuts each time). I thought it was more of a physiological reaction. if this is the case I don't anticipate having any trouble eating them. Could you elaborate on the muscle tension?  Also, just out of curiosity, would you prefer to eat them during the day or closer to the evening? Initially I thought day, however I wonder if being around strangers (campground after all) might affect my headspace and therefore leaning closer to the evening might be more wise? Given my intended dose I don't quite think I'll be out of my mind and don't exactly plan on interacting with the fellow campers, so maybe I'm over thinking things? Any thoughts on time of day?"
shrooms,3cri90,happiefish,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:47:56 2015 UTC,"I like to take shrooms late afternoon in the summertime. The change of light is just amazing. Tripping in the day is fun and bright, and then the sunset is gorgeous and you almost feel like the trip is over, and then night falls and it's a whole different world. So I would take about 3 hours before sunset. Just make sure that you are familiar and comfortable enough with your surroundings that you won't have problems getting around in the dark.  I did a lemon tek last weekend, it masked the taste very nicely. I got it all down in one lemony gulp. I didn't find that it affected the length or strength of the trip that much."
shrooms,3cri90,iaskforbananas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:31:07 2015 UTC,"The duration of a 2 gram trip is really hard to estimate as there are so many factors. Obviously the strength of the shrooms, but also the individual. Everyone reacts differently, 2 grams may be really weak to one person and really strong to another. I am a bit of a hard head when it comes to psychedelics so 2 grams would be a low level trip for me, but maybe not for you. 2 - 2.5 grams is usually a good starter dose to help you figure out where you land on the spectrum.  In regards to the muscle tension, again it depends on the individual. I seem to be more susceptible to it than most. It usually manifest as slight to moderate tension in my neck and jaw, but it is never bad enough to ruin a trip or impact it in any real way. At the absolute worst my neck will be a little sore the next day, but a little stretching fixes it right up. For some reason the lemon tek completely eliminates the tension. I have no idea why, but it is one of the reasons I like it.   Day or evening is a matter of preference. Personally I like to time it around sunset as that is my favorite time of day.  The most important thing is that your comfortable, so just think about what time of day you'll be most relaxed and have the least likelihood of interruptions. 2 grams probably won't get you wacky, but it still might be a good idea to time it to avoid other campers."
shrooms,3cri90,iaskforbananas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:32:03 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks! Sounds like sunset is the time! I took what I would estimate to be 0.75g last weekend, it was basically a tear off one of the larger caps, and three 1inch stems. I went for a bike ride and had a blast, reminded me of a weed high but a more introspective and ""philosophical"", despite my thoughts being goofy. I've always been a bit of a light weight with drugs, so I'm thinking this should certainly have me enjoying myself greatly without much risk of going too hard.   Everyone here is so helpful, I'm curious if you think having fairly robust experience with marijuana may allow me to take slightly more without reaching an extreme. I'm not in the mood to be under much stress, but I'd of course rather my trip be a marked difference than my soft (but fun!) bike ride last week.   If you're at all interested I'll gladly let you know how it goes.   Thanks again."

The sky was an explosion of pink and gold and purple and blue, reflected in the sea. Then the stars came out, and there were no other lights so they were super bright. The sea was really calm, black glassy water that reflected the sky like a mirror. Skipping through the warm water was like running though a field of stars.  Then I started hearing it - the Song. It was like an orchestra starting up. Everything had it's own song, every leaf, grain of sand, rock and star. The whole universe was singing together and their song created the fabric of reality. Then I heard my own song. I was also singing along, a part of the great cosmic chorus.  I call it my Bhagavad Gita trip - BG means The Song Celestial.

shrooms,3cq7ij,motherliva,5,Thu Jul 9 22:07:06 2015 UTC,The most effective way would be avoiding tolerance. LSD and Shrooms have a cross-tolerance so that is probably why you didn't feel anything.
shrooms,3cq7ij,muhtoosh69,3,Thu Jul 9 23:13:02 2015 UTC,"Lemontek makes the effects come much faster. Take some shrooms, grind it as much as you want, it can be done with a knife or with fingers, let it simmer for like 20 mins in lemon juice and drink it up till there's nothing left ;)"
shrooms,3cq7ij,hobowizard19,3,Thu Jul 9 22:20:36 2015 UTC,"Lemontek is awesome, It breaks down the something or other in the mushrooms that tend to give nausea which can cause anxiety on the come up, it hits much harder and faster so it can really stretch a smaller amount into an awesome trip, but it doesnt last as long as eating them plain. Its really easy, I dont even grind mine i just cut them up a bit because the lemon juice breaks down the mushrooms to the point where when you drink it you cant even feel the little bits, they become mostly dissolved. Also its a super pleasant aftertaste, a nice lemon punch, theres none of that earthy musk smell to push though, no uncomfortable textures, just all around pleasant. Shot glasses do work best. You can also steep them in tea by cutting them up or grinding them, steep for 20 minutes and this also breaks down some of the stuff that causes nausea and makes it kick in faster, tea is like a step down in intensity from lemontek, but also lasts a bit longer, but not as long as eating them raw. Minimum wait a week after doing shrooms or LSD to do the other, but I would suggest waiting a bit longer. Also if you do shrooms, then want to do acid a few days/week later, its easier then the other way around to trip off of. But again its just a better idea to wait a bit inbetween. You don't want to loose the magic of tripping by making it a regular thing."

Personally id feel great come bed time, could talk and listen really well in conversation, would feel comfort and happiness.  But really, 1 liberty cap can be enough, to not notice. Maybe once or twice a week or less?  If its a cubensis then Id eat a really small one or a half that, if the effects were too much i would try less in a few days. Maybe a small cap, like the size of an aspirin would do.  She could start on a day off and see if the effects are too much.

shrooms,3cppce,thevidyy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:20:01 2015 UTC,Yes. They saw a couple minutes of light each day when I was checking them or adding new batches of jars to the incubation chamber. I birthed them last night. I was using regular mouth mason jars so I had to shatter the glass to get the cakes out. They got kind of bruised but They'll have soaked for about 24 hours when I get home from work. I likely wont roll them after the dunk because of the amount of pins that are on the cakes.
shrooms,3codfp,stay_private,4,Thu Jul 9 13:57:34 2015 UTC,Cubes grow on grains. You add the vermiculite for moisture.  They do grow on cow patties in the wild.
shrooms,3codfp,djwonderful,2,Thu Jul 9 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"In the wild they grow on dung the best. When we are able to manipulate the condition by growing indoors, unlike mushrooms just growing by chance in the wild, they do best for beginners on vermiculite and BRF.   Mycelium does very well on Verm/BRF (brown rice flour), and something what people will do is ""case"" the birthed cakes with manure in a monotub or something like. You'll get larger flushes from casing with dung, or a dung/coir casing. Vermiculite holds in moisture as well, where as in the wild, the manure is moistened from natural rainfall."
shrooms,3codfp,Sporelock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:48:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Can you tell me what casing is?
shrooms,3codfp,Sporelock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:55:51 2015 UTC,"Casing is a thin layer designed to hold moisture and/or nutritious value you put over your colonized substrate to promote healthier and more bountiful fruits. If you make a spawn bag, people will typically put it in a tote bin/ monotub and case it with manure, coir, and with some species wood chips or sawdust for better and healthier yields. If you do a brown rice flour and vermiculite cake you should soak the cake in water for 24 hours to hydrate the cake, and then roll it in vermiculite (acts as a casing to hold moisture) before fruiting. This greatly increases fruit health, fruit quantity, and number of possible flushes."

shrooms,3con7z,hushd_,2,Thu Jul 9 15:13:46 2015 UTC,"Heres what you should do. You can sterilize it yourself. go buy a 1-litre mason jar, put the rye in it (maybe wet it a bit first, but it should not be soaking wet even in the slightest. Too much water is bad) and then put it in a pressure cooker at 15PSI for 1 hours, OR put it in a regular pot and fill water about 1/3 to 1/2 way up the side of the jar in the pot and boil it with a lid on for 90  minutes. This is considered sterilized. If Pressure cooking, put a ""spacer"" between the bottom of the PC and the jar bottom to protect yourself from glass cracking or burning your grain. Also with either method you must wait 6-8 hours so everything totally cooled before injecting your spores or else the spores will die a fateful death. If PC'ing only fill a little past the bottom of the jar, but still enough so that it wont boil dry (worst case scenario) during PCing. Do not open the lid before youre ready to inoculate with spores and only open it when youre everything ready to inject spores/  Also please put one or two small (1/16 inch, or 1 millimeter approx. in diameter) so that you can inject your spores into the substrate (the rye).   Then once its 30% colonized, err maybe 40%, shake the jar up to disperse the spores/mycelium through the jar then wait for it to be fully colonized (entirely white with mycelium). Then follow the instructions to the letter that came with your kit.  this will be safer if you have a pressure cooker, but if you don't, that's cool, it will still work. For better reference, look at this or google ""how to make a spawn jar for cubensis.""   http://www.shroomery.org/9032/6T-WBS-Tek-Wild-Bird-Seed-Bulk-Spawn-Preparation-Method  This uses Wild Bird Seed but the method is totally the same for your rye.

shrooms,3con7z,Sporelock,2,Thu Jul 9 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"The tyvek acts as a contam layer, but some people use polyfill as their layer or use micro pore tape.   Tyvek works he best, but Google alternatives. Tyvek is cheap and found at literally any Home Depot or related store."
shrooms,3cpo6g,hobowizard19,2,Thu Jul 9 19:48:25 2015 UTC,"What's a casting? You mean a casing? And you're describing a substrate, not a casing (a casing is an inert layer of material put on too of the substrate optionally. It's generally peat moss and vermiculite). As far as finding substrate, you can find coco coir at any major pet supply store. It's found as compressed bricks (get the bricks) used for reptile bedding. Also, you could get a bag of composted cow manure for five bucks for fifty pounds. Between the coir, the compost, and a little vermiculite, you've got a substrate. And no, you don't sterilize your substrates in a pressure cooker. You only do that with the grain or substrate you plan on inoculating directly. You pasteurize substrates. Keeping the material between 145-165 degrees for 90 minutes. Also, if you want to make a monotub, fuck the PF tek route.

OP, keep up your vegetarianism! You get to know you aren't participating in animals getting unnecessarily killed (nearly 50 land animals and 150 ocean animals are killed a year per meat eater in America), it encourages you to learn how to cook really good food since you don't have as many preprepared options, and it seems to be making you happy.

shrooms,3coo2q,hobowizard19,0,Thu Jul 9 23:21:41 2015 UTC,"Milk has 25 times less B12 than meat, 60 times less than liver. Meat also has many other important things. Lamb should be eaten twice a week. Pig, if living in cold places, once a 10 days or so, beef if wanted once a week. That's how I eat, at least, ain't saying that everyone should eat like that, but I advice eating meat at least once a week. And pig once a month. (also, fish has even more important stuff in it). Anyway, I have nothing against vegetarianism, but only if the person is older than 30 years old. My opinion, though. Chill.  BTW, the bad thing about animals getting killed is not what you said, but that they are made (grew) to be eaten... People give them shit for them to grow faster, which makes the meat worsen... Anyway, the cruelty is real, but only on those farms which are fabric kind.   Peace."
shrooms,3coo2q,gamyak,2,Thu Jul 9 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand your huge concern over B12. I take a B12 pill once a week and my levels are just fine (and I know plenty of other vegans that are the same). It really is that easy to get enough B12. As for any other health/dietary concern you have, the ADA, who I'm pretty sure has way more knowledgeable people on the subject of healthy diets than either your or me, says that   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.   So your ""only if a person is older than 30 years old"" statement is kind of silly and not based in fact or reality at all (I know you said it was your opinion but it's still an uninformed opinion). I also have no idea where your seemingly random numbers for how frequently you advise eating certain types of meat but I feel certain they aren't based on any scientific evidence.  And yeah, cruelty is a much bigger issue than them just being killed but I still don't think we should be killing them and I don't like talking about the cruelty aspect because it makes me upset and was trying to keep things slightly more positive. There are also a lot of other reasons though such as environmental concerns, decreased risk of certain types of cancers, you don't have to worry about eating under cooked food (1 in 4 meat eaters every year end up getting food poisoning), decreased risk of heard disease, it's cheaper, and probably a few others that I'm not thinking of right now but those are what matter to me personally.  I just have no idea why you're trying to convince OP to not be vegetarian and am trying to provide him with factual information so he isn't dissuaded or scared by you."

You're just sharing your opinion, making it look like it's fancy in scientific way which it isn't completely. Have it your way, man, but please chill out, I don't want to speak no more about this thing and I'll leave it as an good scientific study by some slavic guy... I really don't know who he is, but I talked with one guy who was interested in his work and he told me that by his (slavic guy) studies that humans' jaw is designed to eat vegetables.

Suppose you had a dose of each that would produce about the same levels of visual effects, banging great glorious visual effects that they are both entirely capable of producing.  (I think pople that think shrooms aren't as visual aren't doing enough)  In two hours time the LSD is starting to get some really nice rushes going, and they grow, and grow, and grow towards a peak thats still a ways off.  The shrooms are peaking at the two hour mark, it's showtime!.  If you get the idea in your head, ""Holy shit! These things are strong!  What's this going to be like in two hours???"" It can be scary.  What you are actually going to get in the next three hours of the shrooms is a slow, beautiful mellowing of the experience.  LSD and Shrooms can get you into the same sort of trip space,  LSD pushes you along to it for a while.  Psilocybin sort of yanks you by the neck.    If you just relax and let it you'll be fine."
shrooms,3con9h,BarryZZZ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:48:21 2015 UTC,"LDS is more intense, at least in my experience. Mushrooms feel to me, more natural and earthy, so to speak. That being said, the visuals may be less intense, but theres a fun body high (tingling all over your body, in a good way). And your headspace is more fucked. This can be good or bad depending on how you feel about taking them. Thoughts are far more abstract. people describe high doses as a ""mindfuck"" in terms of interpreting logic. If youre dosing high, the visuals will be pretty similar.   All in all, its fairly different, but if youre comfortable with LSD, youll be absolutely fine and in control of your actions on mushrooms. I wouldn't worry about it tbh. How much approx are you going to take?   If you're wondering about how much I've done before, I can draw good comparisons about what each drug has to offer as I've done high doses of each drug. About 6-tabs of LSD (~650mcg) at once, and 7-8 grams of mushrooms."

As far as me and the people I've talked to have been able to tell, every 2g of shrooms is about as intense as 100ug of LSD. So take 13g of shrooms and tell me LSD is more intense.

Your substrate had fly eggs in the substrate when your jarred it and didn't sterilize it well enough. If you used just a pot and didn't use a pressure cooker or autoclave, this is a definite possibility.   Secondly, it pays to cover the jars with a blanket if youre keeping your incubating jars in a tote bin or something. Just put a blanket or piece of cardboard over all the jars to keep flies from physically being able to lay eggs around your jars. The dry vermiculite layer that works for keeping contaminates out sadly wouldn't work for fly offspring, because they can hatch in the dry verm, and then venture down to the nutritious substrate.   Either way, really really look over your process and your sterilization technique. Something like this is not really likely to happen again if you take some action in in improving your technique"

Shrooms make this process a lot easier and more natural, as you can focus your attention on your mind and the focus will remain there without effort.  Make sure your environment is stable and predictable, that nothing will bother you, not even your own worries about tomorrow. Make sure that you will be able to let go and completely forget about yourself and your responsibilities for some time and that nothing is keeping you alert or worried.  Also, I would say be careful with taking 5g just yet, that's more than double what you took last time. You may be caught off-guard by how much more that is, and there is no mercy here."
shrooms,3cjdbw,higgs8,5,Wed Jul 8 13:35:01 2015 UTC,"^ that last paragraph is what I came to say. 5g's can be incredibly unforgiving, and even uncomfortable, if you're not used to it's effects. I'd say (in my experience) that a daytime trip will treat you better than a trip at night on heavier doses, as the sunshine, and brightness can do a lot to put you in a positive mindstate, especially one that'll be conducive to a better 'learning' experience"
shrooms,3cjdbw,vertebral_placenta,2,Wed Jul 8 14:13:19 2015 UTC,there is no mercy here.   Truer words never spoken.
shrooms,3cjdbw,theraydog,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for this! I definitely plan on meditating and seeing what comes to me. I'm not worried at all about taking 5g because I want to be overwhelmed if that makes sense. If I have a difficult trip I will be ok with it because I might learn more from it in the end :)
shrooms,3cjdbw,ZornsLemmon,4,Wed Jul 8 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"5g is going to be quite a different ride than 2g. Just be open to the experience. I've had great results 'seeing more' by simply asking the mushroom to go deeper. Same works for 'hey there man, this is getting kind of intense, mind if we throttle back a little bit'. Also, smoking some weed can definitely take the trip to another level.  That being said, a trip can only give you a glimpse at 'enlightenment' and the ineffable, it's what you take from your trip and apply to your daily life that is important. You won't suddenly be a completely enlightened deity after taking mushrooms, they are just a tool that can give you a temporary glimpse.  Also, shrooms have a very mischievous side to them, and some people go too far down the rabbit hole to really take anything positive from the trip. Even some of the most experienced trippers have seen the bottom of the abyss, and been faced with the nihilistic bleakness beneath it all, and been traumatized by the experience.   Go read trip reports that claim to have 'learned so much' or whatever, and you'll notice that it's extremely vague what it is they actually learned or if it's even applicable to living your life better.   I'd say, don't take such a serious 'I'm doing drugs not for fun but for mind expanding' standpoint. People take enthogens because they give them a glimpse at the impossible. Part of why you should be doing it is to experience the strange, feel inter-contentedness on a different level, and to change your perspective (temporarily) and maybe muse on your own life from a new angle. Obviously you aren't doing shrooms just to get fucked up, there are way better drugs for that, but at the end of the day you're taking a drug to alter your state of consciousness.  If you want to go be a monk go be a monk; a truly enlightened person wouldn't need to use mushrooms, for us laymen it's more of a tool.   TLDR; drugs should be a good time (hopefully). You don't really want to have a bad time on shrooms, the experience is already intense enough, you may as well enjoy yourself during the trip."

If you want a transformative learning experience, try what I call the ""psychiatrist's trip"" - put on some drums, take 2.5g, pick a personal growth type topic you would like to grow in*, and start journaling about 45m after ingestion.  It will be powerful.  *2.5g is probably right for this, really - 5g has it's place, but 5g is way more than 2x2.5g, and you're more at risk of having a bad trip or just short circuiting and not getting a lot of transformative change out of it.  **Really, any reflective topic will do - trust me, you will end up writing about what you need to."

shrooms,3cifc3,Xrutgers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:01:14 2015 UTC,"Congrats! enjoy the ride friend.   What should you do while tripping? I would say as little as possible. You should set up a cool nature documentary on Netflix, have a few different music genres queued up, maybe a lava lamp or some christmas lights up in your bedroom and then some silly and fun activities in another room. This is all here to help you do a bunch of different things. You might do several things in a trip, you might just want to sit by yourself for a while and think interesting thoughts... that's one of the best parts about a trip, you really aren't sure where it's going to take you. You just enjoy the ride.   Environment should be your home, or someplace you know very well. You want to be comfortable, feel safe, and not have to worry about the outside world.   Music... I like zen relaxation music myself. You can also google trippy shroom music if you want. Personally I would rather just put on 10 hours of rain or a thunderstorm or the beach...   Movies... Nothing dramatic or serious or ugly or that involves a lot of killing. You want something fun and light and adventurous. Something with stunning visual effects and cinematography. I would suggest Nature documentaries, just something that puts you right into nature and lets you observe it for a while.   I would also have some weed handy and smoke that... it helps with the nasuea and the experiences when you first start to trip.   Most people experience something profound and spiritual. I remember when I found my spirit animal on my very first trip that I took with shrooms I grew myself. I wasn't looking for a spirit animal, mind you... I was just enjoying the feeling of breathing and had my eyes closed, and all of a sudden this scatterplot appeared in my vision, and it just formed together to that of an ancient turtle.   It was almost like we just bumped into each other. He seemed to be having a profound trip of his own, and merely said hello. I instantly felt like he was my mentor and wanted to learn from him.   He didn't give me advice or help me find the path to inner peace or anything... but every time I think about that turtle I remember the smirk he had on his face when I told him I was a fellow adventurer like himself. I don't think I will ever forget that.   Anyway, to answer your question shrooms are an intense trip. It is a big roller coaster and you feel some very big and profound emotions. There have been scientific studies that conclude most people who shroom have some spiritual or profound experience of some sort.   Ego death is a part of that as well. That is usually saved for heroic doses though, something over 5 grams. Instead of an outer trip, the ego death is a completely inward trip. When I have those, it is usually by myself in a quiet room while I am meditating...   Those are some of the good ones.   You should eat all of it. Either chop it up in a food processor and drink it with orange juice... or if you have a temperamental stomach make some tea from it. Either way I would take all 3.5 grams. That is a perfect normal sized dose... you will be able to really feel what a shroom trip is like."

You will see everything ""through the veil"", if you go to party women will look hot as fuck and men will be your competitor lizards, komodo skin faced, tattoos might move around on their skin like snakes, be aware!  This all will be fun of course, it is about understanding the package we get while touching the void of these things  who am I, what are they, and so on and so on  do you understand what I am telling to you?  the heavier the trip the more the R-complex wakes up, the more fun it is  but some people think that a heavy trip is bad or something  but the R-complex in this moment says that, for they are weak, the do not deserve the full light that comes from eating the visions of god O_O  =)  I just like telling things the way I've understood it.  Witch house might be great music, look it up  if you want to trip heaven play some ""Year of No Light"", the album Ausserwelt is excellent for soul travel in dimensions beyond this plane"

Thing is, mushrooms grow alongside molds and bacteria all the time but being forced to compete causes poor results in terms of yeild. Some mushrooms like P. Azurescen prefer a dirty unpasteurized substrate ( sterilize the spawn) for some reason. Wild cannabis deals with pests and pollen (hence seeds) and they don't produce a lot if not cared for by more than nature and luck.  Same thing. We don't want our grows to compete with anything."

The fact that we don't live ass deep in mushrooms is certain proof that nearly all of them fail to reproduce.    Five acres of low wet cow pasture, literally tons of shit laying around for weeks at a time and if you go out and pick 40 mushrooms you are having a great day!  If you've got lots of time and a five acre closet you might want to go for it.  Enough of my smartassery.    I once lived in a place where free and at the time legal wild picking was easy as hell. I attempted a transplant.  I collected a few cow chips that I'd havested some nice shrooms from, and a couple that had not fruited and mixed them together.

All this can vary depending on your body-weight, the strength of the shrooms etc....  First time at a concert might be a bit overwhelming. When I trip I hate being around non-trippers and you might freak out (unless it's a trance party and everyone is tripping, that's rad). Have a save space like a tent or a car where you can chill and be alone if you feel overwhelmed. If it's going to be a heavy concert with lots of aggressive music and drunk people, don't trip, go for a more woodstock type vibe, e.g. outdoors, groovy music, everyone on the same page.

shrooms,3ceyth,szubsa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:32:05 2015 UTC,"How do you know that?  To put it simple: There is the naturally occurring reality. The world/universe as it is made by nature. It's the best possible world.   If the world is made by nature, couldn't we call nature God? Since God is said to have made the world and nature fits that description. Anyway, something made our world and keeps making it day in day out. We, as humans, originate in this world, have our roots in this world, are permeated by its laws and are connected to it. Connected to the underlying principle of physical reality. Connected to what fits the description of God.  Science tries to improve the world made by nature/God or this principle. They solve a problem but, at the same time, by changing natural reality, create a myriad of new problems. It's like an addiction. Someone uses a stimulant so he can be more productive and have a better/richer life, but at the same time gets some physical problems from his drug abuse. Until the stimulant causes more problems than benefits and he goes to hell/end up in the gutter or whatever you want to call it.  So science, which tells us there is no God, is like the snake from the bible. Telling us we can be in charge of the world and that we don't have to bow for the principle/God creating the natural world. While they cannot deliver on their promises and make us masters of the universe. How can you believe in science when it's obviously a fake?"
shrooms,3ceyth,szubsa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:45:31 2015 UTC,"ok, let me reformulate... the general concept of god and divine, is just that, a concept, social construct by humanity to fill up all the gaps that we (for now) cannot understand/explain/etc.    that doesn't mean that i don't believe in something ""higher"" than me and you... i just don't call it god or divine and i don't expect that to be ""better"", ""more pure"" or ""perfect"" than me and you ... i can conjecture that we could be some lab experience in a petri dish of some civilisation, but i don't expect that they care about me or even know that we exist... like you are no god to an ant or some microorganism, maybe there is something ""higher"" than us, but they are no god... and the opposite is true, maybe there are billions of universes around us, but they are so small, or so different in a sense of reality that we aren't even aware.  like in The Wizard of Oz, there is something behind the curtain, but it isn't divine.

I didn't have any stomach problems or anything from the shrooms. They didn't taste great but they didn't taste particularly horrible either.   Find a nice place to do it (I suggest nature. I always go for nature. Really though, shrooms in nature was nothing short of heaven), make sure the people with your friend are people he is comfortable with. Make sure to get rid of any possible sources of anxiety. That's all I'd suggest. I hope your friend enjoys the trip."
shrooms,3cg40i,deathnate4,3,Tue Jul 7 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"You should smoke if it is something that you find calms your nerves. If smoking has a tendency to make you feel a little more anxious, or you think it might, then its safe to just skip it until youre in the trip and comfortable with what it has to offer. Also dose low. Try out like2 grams each to start with. That's probably a good starting point. Always remember this, You can always consume more later, but you can never turn back if you've eaten too much. Better to slowly meet your goal, then totally overshoot it and have an awful experience."

shrooms,3cg40i,Shadesbane43,2,Tue Jul 7 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"I tried two grams my first time. That's a good starting dose. I had already tripped acid several times, however, so it was a little underwhelming for me. I assume you don't have any experience with psychedelics (other than weed, obv.) since it wasn't mentioned in your post.  I've also seen a person have an awful, terrible, no good, very bad trip with two grams. Thankfully that part only lasted maybe 30-45 minutes for him. Just make sure you don't have any commitments for about six hours after you dose. You'll most likely be fine. Set and setting and all that. I have no clue how he could flip out that much from such a small dose, but I tolerate psychedelics better than a lot of people.  I'd say just go for it. If you can have a babysitter experienced with such things with you, great. If not, it'd probably be a good idea to at least have a sober person with you, just in case. He/she can smoke with you guys too.   Do you like mushrooms? Like everyday, run-of-the-mill shiitake and portobello? If so, the taste will be fine. If not pleasant, at least tolerable. IMO, they taste like peanut shells. One of my friends puts his on a peanut butter sandwich and says you can't even taste them. Some of my other friends put them in empty capsules. Unless you get them online, they're actually kind of tough to find, but you can empty out cinnamon gelcaps or something else with rather large capsules and grind up the shrooms and put them in there. They take longer to hit you and I always gave them shit for it. I always just eat them straight with some OJ to wash them down (supposed to help with digesting them).  Go for it man. Just remember in the back of your mind if the trip gets intense that you're feeling that way because you ate some mushrooms. You're on a drug. If you have any questions, reply or PM me.

shrooms,3ce9o2,LilShroomie,3,Tue Jul 7 06:02:40 2015 UTC,"While you may end up getting some ""general wisdom"" type comments on how many stems equals what, it's not really the best way to be going about this. Ideally, you want to know the exact weight (in grams, with at least .1 gram accuracy) to properly dose. A typical dose is somewhere around 3.5 grams; some say 2 grams is good for a first time, others like to take 4 or 5 grams each trip. What I would recommend is patience and doing things properly for your first time. This also includes having a sitter, or other people around who can help you if things get a little too intense.   To reiterate my point, I've had some stems only be about .2 grams or so and others are well over 4 grams (rare, but they exist). That's an extremely wide range of weight, so do keep that in mind. All of that said, you likely don't have enough to go too far down the rabbit hole, but I still want to give words of caution.   Lastly, I would recommend either the lemon tek or making tea (Google them, I'm sure there are plenty of posts on Shroomery and elsewhere). These two make it a bit easier on your stomach and are typically a little bit more mellow. They also hit you fairly quick, so you don't make the rookie mistake of waiting an hour, thinking you didn't take enough, and gobbling down more only to have them all kick in another hour later."
shrooms,3ce9o2,chronicENTity,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:28:33 2015 UTC,"Do you have enough to get high? Yes.   I know shroom stems range in size, but if your friend takes shrooms regularly and knows what they are doing, then they gave you 4 dried stems not quite as long as a pinky finger and about as thick as a straw.  Let me know if I am way off here...   If that's the case, you have more than enough for a nice little trip. You aren't dosing enough that you're going to kill your own ego, but you would be out of the range of a microdose. You are well on your way to the magic kingdom friend.   Now, from the way you said you ""Need halp pls,"" I am also going to assume you are fairly young... perhaps even in the high school range. So, I think I am going to play a little fast and loose with my normal shroom tips, tricks and warnings.   Take them. Take all 4 stems. Either make some tea and put it in that, or put it in a food processor and mix it with orange juice and drink it all down.   Then, go to your room and listen to some nice music that you like.   That's it.   Just wait for it.   Don't worry, it will happen soon enough. And when it does... don't fight it. It's going to be fun, it's going to be interesting, and you will have no idea what is going on.... but that's half the fun of shrooms, especially the first time.   I hate to be the old Morpheus ""You need to see it for yourself,"" but I think it applies in this case. Shrooms is the kind of drug that isn't like most others.   This isn't a funny silly high like pot.   This doesn't give you energy like coke.   This doesn't make you feel better like ecstacy.   This messes with your brain, in several different ways. The only way to experience it is to do it for yourself.   4 stems isn't a big dose. You should be fine.   Enjoy yourself. And let us know what happened. I love hearing Field Reports."
shrooms,3ce9o2,Sillycomic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:39:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response :) I hope you're correct, because I really want you to be right. However, another comment I got makes me think I might not have enough to get high. You were right too, the stems are about 2/3 the size of my pinky. I do have quite a few more questions too, honestly.  Also, I'm actually 22. I guess I can see why you think that; I'm really not that bad normally, I'm just really high (weed). I'll probably try those out tomorrow night."
shrooms,3ce9o2,Sillycomic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:53:17 2015 UTC,"You don't have enough for a full dose by any means, but you have enough to see some cool visuals and enjoy yourself. I imagine if you watched a movie or a documentary, it would be one of the coolest you have ever seen. I highly recommend shrooms and documentaries, especially nature ones... such an amazing experience!  Ahh, 22. I was close. Considering I'm 34, that's about right. I get really high myself at times and am not always comprehensible. I usually tend to stay off reddit during those times though...   Or, I will post something and halfway through realize it's more of a bother than it's worth and delete it.   We're always here for more questions if you have them. Nothing is too stupid or random to ask."

Oh, and yeah, I usually stay off reddit but I was really anxious to talk to someone about this. I wanted someone to help me feel alright about doing it cuz I was a little scared.

shrooms,3cdd1z,wololointensifies,8,Tue Jul 7 01:03:48 2015 UTC,"My friend! Well first off it comes to what you should be looking for.  Your mushrooms should be dried (they should feel like they can snap or break in half at the stems, and look evaporated/shriveled up).  Chances are they will have a soft blue bruising on the stems, so if you see that, its a good sign. Now as far as the trip itself goes, Tim Leary once said that its ""set and setting"".  Make sure you are COMPLETELY comfortable before you trip.  Find a place and time where you know you will have NO responsibilities with the outside world for at least 9 hours.  You can't plan out a day on shrooms like you would with cannabis. Make sure you have no negative energy or bad thoughts going on before you trip, no matter how miniscule.  Ive  once had a bad trip because I was worried about a parking ticked that wasn't even mine. During the trip, it WILL be more intense then you could have imagined.  There's no question about that.  I recommend a dose of 2 grams for a first trip.  It will be enough to really show you a new side of life, and give strong open and close eye visuals.  If you start to feel like you are having a ""bad trip"", then I would recommend changing the setting.  Usually changing your surroundings makes a trip feel completely different, as your emotions become attached to your senses.  Remind yourself that mushrooms are completely safe, and you will return to normal soon.  Write on your hand ""You are tripping, you will be normal again soon"" if you have to, I did when I began my psychedelic experiences and it truly helped me out of a lot of jams. Feel free to message me any time about shrooms, other psychedelics, or anything really.  always down to hear about experiences! Have a nice trip -Fistyfetus"
shrooms,3cdd1z,fistyfetus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:50:47 2015 UTC,What's wrong with fresh ones? If you buy them not long before you use them and they were just picked you can use fresh ones. Which will probably give u a better trip seeing as drying kills the psilocin. I grow my own and love to eat them as fresh as possible.
shrooms,3cdd1z,Xx420yoloscopes_w33d,4,Tue Jul 7 11:01:39 2015 UTC,"Well, they are going on a camping trip in a few weeks, and I doubt they will be buying the shrooms the day before the trip and taking them on that first day. I imagine dried shrooms is something they can pick up in a few days and save for a few weeks until the trip...   That being said, if you do have an opportunity to get fresh, please do so. They are so much better! Harder to get, but well worth it."
shrooms,3cdd1z,Sillycomic,2,Tue Jul 7 16:15:31 2015 UTC,thanks for the feedback everyone! We where thinking about eating them at night by the campfire. What are you thought on that?
shrooms,3cdd1z,fistyfetus,2,Tue Jul 7 20:55:23 2015 UTC,"Being outside is preferable in my opinion.  The fire will look beautiful.  I actually usually dose at around 2 am, so I am peaking during the sunrise.  it is beautiful."
shrooms,3cdd1z,Sillycomic,2,Wed Jul 8 04:09:44 2015 UTC,"My only suggestion would be to make sure someone isn't tripping who can actually tend to the fire. That's not something you want to mess around with during that trip.   But... that being said that's exactly how I would do it during my camping trip. By a bonfire. Maybe I would lay a blanket out under the stars not too far away, and go back and forth between the stars and the fire.   Good times friend. Enjoy it!"
shrooms,3cdd1z,SmartShark,2,Wed Jul 8 07:55:22 2015 UTC,"Hey brodiddly. My first time was very similar, myself and my two best buds, at night, around a campfire in the woods. It was absolutely great, and I think that's the ideal situation for it. Although being in the woods during the day was just as good for me, although different. I don't think you can go wrong in the woods!"
shrooms,3cdd1z,Sumasu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:12:45 2015 UTC,"Hi folks and thank you for your feedback! I'm one of OP friends and I too have a question.  Doing some research, some people were recommanding to make some ""tea"" with the shrooms instead of eating them. Based on your knowledge would you say that it would be a good idea for a first trip or it would ruin our experience?"
shrooms,3cdd1z,fistyfetus,2,Tue Jul 7 21:45:50 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  I think that tea cuts from the trip time, and is less intense.  I think that its more fun to eat them, because the trip is much longer and it just feels so primal and natural.  At the end of the day its up to you though! Happy Trips!"
shrooms,3cdd1z,Sumasu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:11:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer! Some people were recommanding to make some tea because they think that shrooms taste really bad if you eat them. If that statement is true, do you know some ways to improve the taste or to make it less bad?"
shrooms,3cdd1z,fistyfetus,2,Wed Jul 8 22:40:28 2015 UTC,"Shrooms don't taste good obviously, but they really aren't as bad as people make them out to be.  The fact is that if you just chew them up a tiny bit, and take a swig of water, you will barely taste them.  However, there are two ways that I have done that work well.  Eat them with potato chips, or with m&m's.  They make it go down much easier"
shrooms,3cdd1z,Sumasu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:07:22 2015 UTC,"We'll probably try it that way than, thanks!"
shrooms,3cdd1z,Sillycomic,2,Fri Jul 10 13:49:58 2015 UTC,"If you are generally a sad sack? Oh goodness.   I am hoping your intention was to just reiterate that set and setting is important. If you are in a happy place in your life, you will most likely enjoy yourself. That being said, sometimes bad trips happen.   I had a bad trip once that happened halfway into the experience. I was with my fiance and we were ready for a trip. It was just a normal dose, but about 2 hours in I just had one lingering though of negativity that would just not go away. It bounced off the walls in my head repeating over and over again. I couldn't escape it.   Eventually I moved to another room, listened to some music and was able to move away from it, but it still makes me anxious when I dose. I keep thinking I might have another one of those trips.   It has nothing to do with confidence though, or personality really. Someone with a melancholy personality can enjoy a trip and someone who is always happy and smiling could have one of the worst trips in their entire life.   Set and setting are all you need to worry yourself with. Just be confident that you have set everything up well, and you will be fine."

The actual mushroom is what makes you sick and some of us feel very sick the whole time and it's not very comfortable.

shrooms,3ccluv,BudFromBC,2,Mon Jul 6 22:25:47 2015 UTC,"There is no ""level"" or any way to determine that. There are so many factors. How much you took, what type they are, where they grew, how long they've been sitting before you took them, whether you ate or not before, how much you ate, the types of foods you have been eating, your emotional state, setting, people you're with, how prepared you were, the activities you did, etc. Plus everyone reacts differently. Just pay attention, adjust based on your previous experiences, and pretty much just do whatever the fuck to make it how YOU want it to be. You'll never ever be able to figure out what ""level"" it was because we all perceive experiences differently and ultimately nobody but yourself can experience what you've experienced.

You have stomach content, tolerance, state of mind, potency (which is aforementioned) and others."
shrooms,3cbhl3,sbarret,3,Mon Jul 6 16:48:04 2015 UTC,"For me personally, 4-aco-dmt produced much less of a weird headspace. Less mental changes, but far more visuals than I normally get on shrooms. Because of that I felt like I didn't get as much out of 4-aco-dmt, it was like a fireworks show but without a lot of substance. Shrooms are always charged with some kind of emotion and strange headspace for me.  Just my experience."
shrooms,3cbhl3,theraydog,3,Mon Jul 6 19:18:51 2015 UTC,The real question is how is there a difference between the two? Although it is theorized that 4 aco dmt is converted to psilocin in the liver people still report mushrooms as having a more definite presence and richer trip. Could it be that the other alkaloids in the fungi make for a different experience than its synthesized counterpart?

Personally, they feel perfectly identical to me. I would not be able to feel a difference if I didn't actually observe what I ingested.   A few friends of mine that I trip with, who are far more experienced with psychedelics than I, say there is a very minute difference to the highly experienced tripper, but the 4-5 times I've taken 4aco, it was so superbly identical, I was really surprised how identical it was. best part is you're able to buy it online.  All this being said, its a lot easier to take more than you bargained for with 4aco, because its a very small white powder, and just an extra ""knife-tip"" can be the difference between comfort and too much to handle. I suggest getting a milligram scale for dosing.  If you hate the taste of mushies, 4aco is your girl - just be careful."

My panic attacks are few and far between, but they were almost every day for 3 months when this all started for me.  This isn't to dishearten you, just to let you know you're not alone. I hate that one bad trip has ruined this for me, I wish I knew how to help myself and fix it. I would suggest therapy... but that's all up to you.

Just try to be a fly on the wall and help them if they look like they need your help, but other than that I wouldn't try to influence them in any way.   I don't like being around others while tripping, if they want to be left alone you should let them. Don't constantly ask them 'are you okay? are you okay?'.  That one is probably the most important; a lot of people get psyched into not feeling okay by others saying stupid shit like 'you doing okay? you don't look so good'.   Being on mushrooms you are very easily influenced by everything, so I prefer a trip sitter to not really do anything other than make sure everyone is okay (without intruding unless necessary). If they feel like being social, that's fine, but don't force anything on them.   As for activities, drawing, music, eating fresh fruit, melting into the soft carpet.

Mushrooms are the reproductive parts of a much larger organism that lives in the soil and makes its living rotting the grass cuttings from your lawn. There is nothing short of pavement that will get rid of that part so it will remain in the soil and continue to make mushrooms when the conditions are right.  You are pretty much stuck with them so whatever actions you take will have little effect.  However, using a mower to grind up the spore producing mushrooms and mix them with grass cuttings is likely a great way to encourage the growth of more.  They're pretty, and poisonous, but there's a lot of stuff in a suburban landscape that fits that description.  I don't worry about them.  You a golfer?  You could practice chipping them out into the street with a wedge?"

The lemon tek which converts psilocybin to psilocin prior to taking the stuff ought to go around that entirely.  I'd be concerned that the high acidity of lemon juice would irritate mucous membrane to which it otherwise never encounters.  A trial of lemon juice alone could rule that out.  Better to go for a ""my butt burns"" experience than a ""my butt burns and I'm tripping balls!"" sort of an event."

As soon as you come down off of your first trip off of those consider eating a great big bowl of bran flakes, all bran, you know the high fiber helps you poop stuff.  When that big load comes through mix it with some water and soak the stuff into a pile of straw.  Or mow the grass when it's still wet and gouge out that thick green ""mower manure"" that tries to clog the machine up and ""innoculate' it with your poo.  Keep it watered.

It was honestly one of the best experiences I've ever had. I'm fortunate to have a big backyard in the desert, and I did like two walkthroughs, just absolutely astonished at the diversity of life. The visuals certainly added to the experience.   It was genuinely amazing. I felt genuinely happy for the first time in quite awhile.

It can be consumed (being fully hydrated), used in another batch, or discarded.

That's one way to use them, if you have something to prove to yourself or others.   I'm definitely one to acclimate myself to something new. Taking 1g is like dunking a leg into a pool that you haven't gotten used to. 2g is like plunging up to your belly button, which if you're not used to the temperature of the pool can be pretty uncomfortable (as I'm sure anyone who's ever gone swimming can attest to).   Jumping into a pool that's a little too cold is easy though, it's not hard to ignore a light negative sensation if you're a stable and composed person.

That's because the trip can be affected by hundreds of factors and the potency and dose of the mushrooms are only two of them. That doesn't mean that PE are stronger than other cubes. In fact they aren't. Like all cubes they have about 0.5-0.6% psilocybin concentration on dry weight.

I haven't seen any lab data on it, but I can tell you my homegrown PEs give me visuls on really low doses, and a 4g trip on them would be very intense (more than I would ever want to do).   Also remember that not everyone has the same sensitivity as you. Your 4g isn't my 4g. Be reasonable when giving people dose guidelines, because a 4g trip isn't for everybody and for some will be way too much."

shrooms,3c8c5e,Otadra,9,Sun Jul 5 21:13:36 2015 UTC,"Winner winner, chicken dinner! Those are most definitely Amanita Muscaria mushrooms.   NEVER eat these raw; you won't enjoy the benefits of these plants unless they're dried or decarboxylated in any way. Check out my post history, specifically the posts that are titled ""about to ingest the holy mushroom"", and ""OP delivers, Amanita Muscaria trip report"".   To know how to prepare them, you need to know the basic chemistry of Amanita Muscaria mushrooms. Ibotenic acid, the prodrug to muscimol, are abundant in fresh mushrooms, and there is little no none of the muscimol that you want. When you dry the mushroom caps, you convert the Ibotenic acid, which causes cramps, nausea, sweating, and other nasty stuff, into muscimol, which is the source of the psychedelic/euphoric effects.   Before you dry the caps, clean them off with a wet paper towel, but try not to scrape off the white dots; some say they are very potent. Disinfection isn't necessary provided there isn't any bird shit on them; I've accidentally eaten dried mushrooms that still had dirt and pine needles stuck to them, and I turned out alright. If there is dung or some other terrible substance stuck to a mushroom, cut that part off and discard it so that you don't spread bacteria when you wash the cap off.   To dry Amanita Muscaria mushroom caps, you should completely separate the caps from the stalks, and set them on cookie sheets lined with aluminum foil. Preheat an oven to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and set the cookie sheet in. Leave the oven door cracked open very slightly, and remove the mushrooms when pieces snap off when you bend them, or at least get them dry enough to almost snap.   Edit: you can eat these mushrooms straight once they are dried, but you will get much more powerful effects if you tear the caps to tiny pieces, soak the mushroom in water/organic grape juice for 6 hours in a vessel covered by a thin hand towel or cheesecloth, then strain, dilute with 2 parts water, and drink. Dilution is important. I don't know why, but many people, myself included, have noticed that the Ambrosia (the water/grape juice extraction) is stronger when you dilute it.   IMPORTANT: don't drink any carbonated beverages 2 hours before or 6 hours after ingesting Amanita Muscaria; the carbonation will turn muscimol back into Ibotenic acid in your stomach, and this will reduce the euphoric/psychedelic effects and increase the unpleasant side effects.   Edit 2: more info in this PDF (viewable on mobile)  http://www.ambrosiasociety.org/files/herbofimmortality2.pdf  Edit 3: I totally forgot to mention dosages! Potency wildly varies depending on region in which they were picked, the time of the year, the age of the mushroom itself, and the quality of the soil. Generally speaking, 3g-5g of dried cap is a light dose, 6g-8g is a medium dose, and 9g-14g is a strong dose. I wouldn't advise going above 15g, but people have done so; some people like high doses, and some people can't take high doses. Listening to the information your body gives you is a must when you consume Amanita Muscaria (or any other psychoactive substance)."

shrooms,3c80ga,ygbplus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:33:46 2015 UTC,You might do better with making tea first and then add lemon juice. The lemon juice will convert the psilocybin to psilocin and I believe psilocin is more prone to damage and oxidation.

shrooms,3c80ga,HandshakeDrugs99,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if you consume it immediately. Think of it like this...  Psilocybin is more stable than psilocin.You can heat psilocybin to 160ish relatively safely without losing potency. If you convert psilocybin into psilocin with lemon juice, you've altered the chemical and made it more unstable. Heating it at that point will be more harmful than if you heat it before converting it.  So, make your tea first. Slow the psilocybin to be extracted from the mushroom. Then add lemon to the tea and let it sit for a few minutes before consuming."

Also, you've placed your cakes directly on the perlite with a layer of verm?  That's what it looks like at least. This is going to encourage the cake to grow mycelium into the perlite layer instead of spending that same energy on producing mushrooms. You want a barrier there, most use a square of aluminum foil.

I looked into arduino automation, but there's not really a good off the shelf humidity meter that can accurately read at 90 percent and up. So you might need to have a low conductivity slightly absorbent material and read voltage across it.   If you want to just control the fae, you can get 8 40mm computer fans. Put 1 in each corner on the smaller sides of the box. One side blowing in the other pushing out. Use stocking as dust filters."

Monotubs use bulk substrate instead of brown rice flour which isn't that great. And the monotub is set and forget.

I've eaten about 4 grams as my highest dose but that didn't come close to the 1.5 of a certain strain I had. Just take one and see what happens so you can gauge it. I would wait about 4 days at least before trying again and upping the dosage. A 3 in reference to what you speak of is awesome. But shrooms are something you should go into with no expectations, so you can really absorb the full experience. They also can be a little overwhelming the first time you trip really hard so it's good for anyone to start slow when you don't know how your mind reacts to a new drug. Since you're about my physical build from what you describe, a 1.75ish gram truffle can bring you anywhere from a 1 to a 5 depending on how good they are.

shrooms,3c4g7w,Albertrain,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:09:38 2015 UTC,"Not at all! There are a few ways that you can go about it. The best way is to use a food dehydrator if you're willing to invest the $30-500. Or you can use desiccant (the little silica packets that come in packaging that say ""do not eat"" all over them). But I used the fan drying method which required a fan (obviously), paper towels, tape, and time. You start by facing the fan upwards to make a table for the shrooms, then you put a paper towel over the face of the face, put the mushrooms on top of that paper towel, and then cover the mushrooms with another paper towel to make a mushroom/towel sandwich. Once that's set up then tape the ""sandwich"" down to the fan and turn it on. You'll need to leave the fan running for about 12-24 hours depending on how big the mushrooms are.  The other, faster method that people use is to put the mushrooms in the oven on the lowest heat setting which is usually 150-170 degrees and leave them for an hour or two. There is an argument as to whether or not that type of heat destroys the potency of the mushrooms, however. I played it safe and stayed away from doing that.  Hope that helps and isn't just rambling. Good luck!"

My last trip recently gave me this indescribable feeling of everything is just going to work out. I was questioning a lot if my life was going in the right direction, if my dreams will work out ec. And when I took the shrooms, a reprogramming took place in this brain and I was left wtih this rock solid, undeniable feeling that everything I wish, hope and desire for is coming and being manifested and everything I've been fearing isn't real.

I still have my impulsive short tempered reactions but I try to remember and tell myself I'm better than this. Sometimes this happens after I've said/done something stupid, sometimes before.

shrooms,3c3tuu,abs1337,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:00:03 2015 UTC,You gotta remember how you did that while you were tripping and apply it into your own life. Epiphany is useless without implementation. We call them magic mushrooms but they aren't gonna magically make your life better. I suggest journaling on the tail end/after your next trip.

shrooms,3c4ixp,regenzeus,2,Sat Jul 4 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"Stop fanning so much. Why is everyone under the impression that you need to fan so much? They're mushrooms, they don't have lungs and they are 90% water. Also, the signs that you aren't getting enough FAE are obvious (mycelium growing past the cake or on the base of the mushrooms, things looking too soggy / mushrooms not growing 'upwards').  Humidity >> FAE >>> light  Just like a watched pot never boils, if you're f'ing with your kit 10+ times a day you won't see progress.   If anything you should be misting 10 times a day and fanning 3-5 times a day. This is becoming frequent where people are fanning absurd amounts of times to the detriment of their grow, so I'm not sure where you guys are getting your information.   TLDR; drop fanning to 2 times a day, mist vigorously after fanning and then just leave your kit be. Come back in a week."
shrooms,3c4ixp,ZornsLemmon,2,Sat Jul 4 18:38:40 2015 UTC,Thank you a lot. So fanning does not increase FAE(=Fresh Air Exchange)? Does that mean that I should drill more/bigger holes to improve FAE?  My box is fairly small. I thought it would be enough since I only have 2 small cakes. Does this have anything to do with the bad FAE?
shrooms,3c4ixp,ZornsLemmon,2,Sat Jul 4 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"So you didn't understand anything I just said...  Fanning DOES increase FAE but stop doing it so much! Fanning too much / opening up your chamber too much compromises the humidity which is far and above the most important factor.   Looks like your chamber has a decent amount of holes already, and fanning 10 times a day there is no way you're keeping a decent humidity in that thing.   Every time you open your mushroom chamber you want a dank, mushroomy, rain forest atmospheric condition in there. You want your chamber to be not soggy (no soggy perlite) but basically DRIPPING in moisture (ie: 100% humidity).   Not getting enough FAE will cause the issues I talked about earlier (and maybe slightly stunted growth), but it won't stop your mushrooms from growing in the same way that having not enough humidity will."
shrooms,3c4ixp,ZornsLemmon,2,Sat Jul 4 19:03:59 2015 UTC,"I did understand that oO but I was confussed because you wrote:  ""Also, the signs that you aren't getting enough FAE are obvious (mycelium growing past the cake or on the base of the mushrooms, things looking too soggy / mushrooms not growing 'upwards').""  means that I have too less FAE oO. And I am just very unsure why less fanning will help with that(but I can see why it would help with humidity).  Edit: Thanks for the effort. I understand now and know what to do!"
shrooms,3c4ixp,negroflaco,2,Sat Jul 4 19:06:54 2015 UTC,"The point of that statement is that you shouldn't stress so much about FAE, it's obvious when you're not getting enough. In fact, my whole post is about how you're FAE focused too much and not humidity focused enough."
shrooms,3c4ixp,Blazeron,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:10:25 2015 UTC,from what i read the fanning is not to exchange air. at this stage fanning is a pinning trigger.

These are unlike the 'mushroom grow kits' that are peddled to USA people (which are generally worthless and a ripoff)... The kits you can get from Canada have pre-colonized cubensis mycelium that are dried... Then you just follow the instructions (water, light, wait, harvest). From what I understand they are legal to order and possess, but it only becomes illegal once you harvest the actual mushrooms (I'm a USA guy who grows.)  It's an easy way to grow. Just, as I said, add water, light, wait, and harvest. Most of the vendors who provide this are in Canada (.ca web address.)  http://www.magicmushroomkit.ca/ is one such website that I've known internet shroomy friends to have ordered from and have success with. Seen it on other mushroom forums online, too. There are probably others as well, but since I don't reside in Canada I don't know them all.  Growing is more beneficial and 'fruitful' than hunting sometimes. If you get an easy grow kit or even order spore syringes to grow 'from scratch' with the PF Tek you will at least know for sure that you're getting actual cubensis magic mushrooms. When you hunt you may find poisonous lookalikes or may not have much luck at all"

Mushrooms can be extremely frightening and can basically stop time and create very bizarre head-spaces with feelings of rebirth / repetition. A lot of people feel that tripping hard on shrooms feels like their losing grip with reality / going insane (many people including myself feel moments of 'holy shit this is what a schizophrenic person must feel like').  Respect the shroom. Even some of the most veteran trippers have been taken to the most bleak and meaningless places while on mushrooms and it can permanently change people in negative ways. Everyone hopes to 'get something' out of a mushroom trip, and I think that bad trips are trips that are difficult in that they produce nothing positive and were a terrifying / unpleasant experience to go through.

shrooms,3bw27w,tehKreator,10,Fri Jul 3 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"I've taken 10 strong LSD blotters to the head at once a few times years and years ago with no issues. LSD was always very forgiving. I could dose high or low with LSD and it'd always be a good time if I was in the right mindset and in the right setting. I've also experimented heavily with lots of Shulgin's psychedelic phenethylamines and other psychedelic RCs, usually coming out of things OK unless I really pushed my limits.  It's easy to get cocky and think that your past experience means that you could handle anything, even if you're thinking to try something for the first time. That's a mistake, though. You never know until you try, and it's always safer to go into something new (or a new batch) with a very low dose and slowly working your way up over time.  Mushrooms I don't find are very forgiving. You also can never really know the potency of any batch of mushrooms without first trying them at a low dose to see how they affect you. Whether you buy them or grow them yourself you really need to start slow and low on an empty stomach (wait 2 to 3 hours after your last meal) to see how potent they really are to you.  I encountered a great deal of anxiety and panic on a 5'ish gram trip from home-grown cubensis last year. I was completely fine with 2 to 3.5g of my home-grown, but more than that was almost too much. It took all I had, all I'd learned over my years of tripping to hold it together for what seemed like 10 hours when it was really probably 2 or 3 hours. I thought that the garbage men picking up garbage from the street curb were out to get me, secret DEA or something, and they ""knew"". The paranoia was unbelievable, but midway into the trip things got less crazy and I managed to enjoy the remaining few hours.  Take it slow with the mushrooms and always be sure you're in a good frame of mind/mindset and in a good setting with no obligations/worries when you trip. Trust me on that. :)  Seems like you and I both learned an important lesson with the mushrooms. I prefer lower doses and don't like to push things too far with cubensis.  If you dose low and don't get the effect that you want you can always wait 2+ weeks and take a slightly higher dose. If you dose too high you can't go back and take less --- You're stuck with whatever you get and it isn't always going to be pleasant. :)  I've found that very low doses (2g and less depending on potency) will get you happily comfortably slightly trippy in a very good way with no bad things, but everyone responds differently so start LOW and SLOW and SLOWLY work your way up over time. :)"

shrooms,3bw27w,BudFromBC,5,Thu Jul 2 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"You say you expected it to be a more visual version of LSD, which is generally not what people say. I often hear it's less visual. You also say you had dinner before, and most people will agree that shrooms can be hard on your stomach even if it's empty, but if you've eaten it can be quite bad. Then when you're tripping on 4g it's very hard to figure out what the hell is going on when you have intense nausea but you can't put your finger on what's wrong, all you know is that it's bad.  My advice: take much less, like 2g. Prepare yourself properly, do not eat for 8 hours before (do them in the morning and don't have breakfast), do not expect it to be like LSD, and also don't expect it to necessarily be pleasant all around ;)  The key here is that once you get the physical discomfort out of the way, all you'll have to deal with is the mental stuff. To do that, you have to be able to really accept whatever your mind throws at you instead of trying to fight the thoughts, feelings or emotions.  But I'm sure that nausea with a full stomach on shrooms is guaranteed to be really bad, so once you avoid that, you'll have a much better time.  I doubt this will affect future trips. If you feel like you want to do shrooms again after all this, that means you probably should. Just next time be careful, take less, don't eat, prepare more."

I find it very interesting that many people have strong visuals on LSD. Of course the brain is extremely complicate organ but I'd like to know the purpose of this. If there are any experts on brain chemistry, please educate us.  LSD gives me visuals like this: https://i.imgur.com/ckobT.jpg Everything is also morphing really slowly and I recognize patterns everywhere. I do not see any fractals or neon colors.  While I was coming up with mushrooms everything was way more colorful and morphing that LSD. It was very beautiful but when I got scared a scenery through window looked something like this: https://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2rcpn1CB71qc0k4ao1_500.gif  I could get rid of most visuals with great focus but closed eye visuals were always there.

shrooms,3bw27w,higgs8,2,Fri Jul 3 08:26:26 2015 UTC,"There's a study that deals with that exact question, and tries to explain what you see on psychedelics and the mechanisms behind it, here's an article about it, and hopefully the study is in there somewhere: http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/why-you-see-what-you-see-when-you-trip  It has to do with how various layers of the brain interpret various signals (there's a part for vertical lines, a separate part for horizontal lines, a part for colors, shapes, etc...) and these parts start to work differently. Also when you stare at something on psychedelics, the object may start to ""grow"" and ""morph"" and become really complex, which is very similar to what the recent Google Neural networks images explore: http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/18/google-image-recognition-neural-network-androids-dream-electric-sheep  Basically your perception of reality is the result of combined memories and expectations fused with sensory input, and you don't actually see the raw sensory input, you only see the final, stable ""perception"" that your brain comes up with. On drugs, this balance is broken and less stable, and you may see more of your sensory input with less memories, or more memories and expectations with less sensory input (for example when you close your eyes). Then when your mood changes, your expectations also change, which in turn changes your perception more drastically when you're on drugs (so being anxious can cause frightening, more aggressive visuals to justify - and enhance - the anxiety)."

It's been about 2.5 years since then and in hindsight that first very difficult trip was a combination of my own bad mental/emotional state/no spiritual consciousness/ignorance of psychedelics (although before you take psychedelics the literature is pretty hard to understand) among other things.   I would definitely recommend trying low doses next time for fun. Go for a hike or maybe somewhere in nature alone or with friends you trust and just take one small to medium sized mushroom (stem and cap), find a place to lay and relax and in 45 min. you should be feeling quite nice.  In my experience, being in Nature almost always improves trips with psilocybin  Trees, plants and insects are more detailed and seem to ""stick out"". The stark ""3-dimensionality"" of trees and certain vertical plants is so incredible to me every time. The sky and clouds are beautiful. The air smells wonderful.  From there, if you want, you can work on fixing the damage you perceive the mushroom inflicted. It's been almost entirely benevolent to me since that first trip, which in hindsight feels more like a punishment a parent would do to straighten their kid out for their own good.  If any of my friends read this they'd think i'm a crazy person."
shrooms,3bw27w,smellytongues,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:54:43 2015 UTC,I have definitely experienced a feeling as if the mushrooms I ate were sentient and were teaching me a lesson for being naive and going overboard by eating too much. Crazy I know but during the trip it made sense and freaked me out.

shrooms,3bw27w,Slap-Jackalope,2,Thu Jul 2 22:19:29 2015 UTC,"This is EXACTLY what happened my first time. My and my roommate tripped in our room and I started feeling sick and it all spiraled downward after that. On top of that, the come up happened when we were sitting in our room. My next big trip I decided rather to let it hit me in my room, we were going to go for a walk instead. It completely distracted me from the momentary nausea and the rest of the trip was fine. We would stop and sit every now and then on the come up, but I would start to feel bad again so we would keep walking. Try this next time.   I have also read orange juice can alleviate the nausea? I'm not 100% on that but I'm doing that for sure next time."

shrooms,3bw27w,belac9001,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"I probably ate about 4 grams my first time with mushrooms. This was the day after I took a couple hits of L so I had some cross tolerance going. It was the best shroom trip I've had so far in the two dozen or so I've had. Just perfect time and place. But with that being said, I've never had a bad trip from shrooms. Contrarily though, I've had some bad times on L and have been way higher off that from even 2 hits compared to 8ths of shrooms. Potency does vary a lot but in my community, but there was definitely good quality of both. Shrooms were a lot easier for me to control and felt like they affected my head space less. Both had about the same amount of hallucinations and such but much different thought processes.  So all I'm trying to say is, it's different for everyone. Don't let anyone tell you this or that. You have to find out for yourself, either the hard way or the not so hard way. There's not usually an easy way  edit: wanted to add. Things tend to get better after a bad trip like that. You don't seem bothered/scarred or any ptsd. You had a mental break down and had to piece yourself back together building a stronger psyche. For your next trip if and when, I would take half that and put myself in a place where this is no worries or stress. Or take some L instead to get the hang of tripping in a good mindset again. It wont do you any good taking one gram while a bit tense and worried"

But the panic attacks kept coming and all I could do was to think ""Oh shit, here we go again"".    This perfectly describes my second trip on a little over an 8th. To all the experienced shroomers, is this normal?   There were moments where I would feel terrible and then I'd suddenly have logical thoughts and think stuff like ""I'm on shrooms, I'm okay.""

Started out pretty well, getting excited about the trip, then turned sour (we were like 10 people inside a mad house on shrooms). I was very young and to be honest simply not ready for this. I tripped last sunday for the second time, with a lesser dose (2.5-3g), with two sitters, and everything went perfectly fine. I was in control (not really, you're still on shrooms and they control you) for most of my trip and was able to get a positive revelation from it.  My point is : I think you weren't ready. Next time you'll trip, consider proper set and settings, and you'll have a blast :)  Trip safe!"

Sometimes the spores will end up on the top of the cap doing the spore releasing!

shrooms,3byeyg,Magnison,2,Fri Jul 3 04:34:28 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar place (in that I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for most of my life), and I would definitely recommend trying mushrooms.   People like us tend to have more ""difficult"" trips, since we can get thrown off by little things and all of sudden feel terrible anxiety or feelings of (seemingly) endless despair while tripping. We have to be more careful about setting up a safe, comfortable environment beforehand, but we most certainly can have wonderful, blissful adventures on mushrooms. My first time, I accidentally (if I had known exactly what I was getting into, I would have been more careful with dosage) ate 4.0+ grams and had one of the most terrifying and amazing experiences of my life, but no lasting effects other than a better outlook on life and a fuller understanding of my place in the universe.   I've also had very pleasant trips by taking just taking 1 gram, and although they aren't really ""mind-blowing,"" they brought about feelings that helped me remember how I felt and thought during my bigger trips, and were also a great deal more manageable in terms of anxiety.  In your case, I would play it safe and take maybe 1 gram. Enough to give you a taste of the ""weird"" feeling you get while on mushrooms and help you expand your mind a bit, but not really enough to bring about any major panic attacks or tough experiences. We're all different, obviously, but 1g should be safe. If you feel like you took it well, and want to go deeper, then I would probably go for the standard eighth (after proper preparation and whatnot; good environment, etc) and enjoy the ride :)"
shrooms,3byeyg,ahriik,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:22:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks or the reply.   I don't really suppose that I think, ""Oh god, if I get any amount of psilocybin in my system, I'll definitely have HPPD forever and my life will be ruined.""  It's just that I had read about the risks inherit with psychedelics and thought, ""Oh most of these are at higher doses so if I take small ones, I should be fine."" Then to read about the same stuff happening at little doses kind of left me feeling disheartened. Also, reading about how 1 gram can sometimes be almost as powerful as a bigger dose trip didn't help either.   But it's good to hear from somebody else with anxiety saying they benefited from taking mushrooms."
shrooms,3byeyg,negbo,2,Sat Jul 4 00:17:13 2015 UTC,"Slowly working your way up with a dose from any new batch or any new grow of yours is the best way to go about things. Potency can vary quite a bit with mushrooms so that's a wise plan of action. Just be aware that it'll take at least 2 weeks since your last dose for tolerance to go back to zero. You can always take more the next time if the trip is lackluster, but you can't untake too many. Your plan seems cautious, but very responsible and surely pretty safe.  If you have some anxiety and depression issues, make sure to only dose mushrooms when your symptoms are low or absent. Everyone responds to mushrooms differently, but anxiety and some paranoia usually only occur at higher dose trips. You want to be sure you're in a good mindset and that you'll be tripping in a safe and comfortable setting. If you aren't sure don't trip. Wait until it feels right.  Also, please be sure to do as much research (or more research if you've already done it) on mushrooms so you know what to expect. Here's a link that contains many other useful links (on effects and dosage ranges, how long the trip should last -- when it kicks in etc., dosage, experience reports from others who have written about their mushroom trips, health information, and more):   https://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms.shtml   There's a treasure trove of information there if you haven't already read it all. The more you know about mushrooms the more prepared you'll be and the less scary/anxious you'll be. You'll be going into it armed with information, and the more you know the more comfortable you'll be.  Don't trip unless you feel completely comfortable with doing it. It's ultimately up to you to decide if you're ready.  As far as HPPD, people who get serious HPPD after one trip or a low-dose trip are usually in the extreme minority. Generally, most people who get HPPD of some kind trip very often on many things (or just one psychedelic in particular) over a long period of time. I have HPPD: I see haloes around lights at night and some visual static at night, and, day or night, any movement at all, the slightest waggle of my finger, insects or birds flying around, cars driving past, any sort of movement has motion trails behind it. The motion trails are always there, but are not as vivid and long-lasting as the ones you'll see when you're tripping. My HPPD doesn't negatively interfere with my life at all. I actually like the haloes and the motion trails. Keep in mind I went through a multi-year phase of wanting to try as many different types of psychedelics as possible. I also used to trip way more often and at higher doses then was necessary. I'm fine now, though, and these days only occasionally trip on mushrooms.  You probably don't have to worry about HPPD, but yes, there is a risk and I'd be lying if I said there's no chance you'll get it. Pretty doubtful you'll be one of the unlucky few who gets it from a low-dose trip or your first time.  HPPD is more likely if you trip often and/or over a long period of time.  I think you have a good plan. :) I've tried very low dose and what was, for me, a higher dose (6'ish grams from a home-grow). I prefer 3.5g and less, and my sweet spot is between 2g and 3g. If you start low and slow and take your time, and make sure you're in a good mindset in a good comfortable setting you should be fine and have a rewarding time."
shrooms,3byeyg,negbo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:09:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the good advice.   I will definitely research more if I plan on doing them, and I read on Erowid a lot, I think it's pretty interesting.   I wish I could say that I would be okay with having lasting HPPD symptoms like you say you have, but I feel like I would think I ""broke"" myself in some way.  Still, reassuring to hear that it's less likely to happen than I might worry about.    Being a person who loves to grow stuff, I would probably get as much enjoyment out of growing shrooms as taking them, ha. Just interesting all around."
shrooms,3byeyg,negbo,2,Sat Jul 4 00:24:25 2015 UTC,"Anybody can plant a seed and grow a plant. Growing mushrooms isn't rocket science, but it is a bit more involved than planting a seed. It's a very fun and extremely rewarding little home science project.  Perhaps if your mushroom experiences go well for you you may consider learning how to cultivate psilocybe cubensis for yourself at home. :)  I'm sure you'll be fine. You seem to be approaching this from a very level-headed, cautious perspective. Nothing you've said makes me concerned in any way for you. I wish you the best and I hope that your mushroom experiences are fun and therapeutic."
shrooms,3byeyg,happiefish,2,Sat Jul 4 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm usually pretty cautious about this kind of stuff anyways. Worst case scenario, I try them, don't like them, then I can just go back to injecting black tar heroin. NOT SERIOUS."
shrooms,3byeyg,ph420,2,Sat Jul 4 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"Worst case scenario, I try them, don't like them, then I can just go back to injecting black tar heroin. NOT SERIOUS.   :)  Yeah, I think you're approaching the mushroom situation pretty well, like I've already said. Unfortunately, most people don't go into it as responsibly and as cautious as you seem to be doing, so I give you major props for that.  I just hope that what I've said has you concerned or worrying less than you did before you read my comment. You seem to have a smart approach to the entire thing so I think you'll be just fine.  Mushrooms can be extremely therapeutic, and even at 'sub-tripping' doses I feel, personally, that anyone can get an awful lot of benefit from them. So long as you aren't highly symptomatic with anxiety and depression when you dose low and slow I think that you will be able to highly benefit from them.  Mushrooms can really help to ease minor anxiety and depression if you're in the right set and setting and you're well-prepared and informed on what to expect. They can provide clarity and peace of mind. If you're already too anxious, depressed, or otherwise mentally troubled the trip could bring out a darker side, though.  I, myself, have bipolar disorder, however I've been 100% stable and on medications since 2008. I wouldn't dream of tripping during a difficult time (that's what therapy and medications are for), but if you've been mostly OK and stable for a while the mushrooms can sometimes bring something extra and positive to your treatment. They can help you view your life and your situation in an entirely new perspective and that can be truly amazing and provide for a great sort of healing.  That said, the dose of mushrooms based on how you respond (self-assess potency low and slow as I've said before) can really help out, and again I'm going to say that dosing LOW can actually REALLY benefit people. You don't necessarily have to dose so high that everything becomes a disjointed and juxtaposed mosaic of fractal freakishness.  Personally, I find that mushrooms are pretty relaxing and dreamy. With LSD and other psychedelics I always had great difficulty getting good sleep the night of the trip, well after the trip wore off, even if I dosed at say 5am. LSD and most of the psychedelic phenethylamines (2cb, 2ci, 2ce, 2ct2, etc...) would leave me completely unable to sleep long after the trip wore off (sleep is important!), but with mushrooms the trip provides visuals and mental affects similar to LSD (for me at least) with a shorter trip time (4 to 8 hours versus 8 to 18 hours) and always leave me tired and being able to get amazing sleep afterwards, waking up energized and well-rested the next day. The 'afterglow' (beneficial effects lasting several days or weeks even after your trip) with mushrooms is much more pronounced, in my experience, than with LSD or other psychedelics.  I really do hope that your experience will be beneficial, rewarding, fun, exciting, and therapeutic for you when you do try them.  I'd like to request that, after your first trial, you consider posting here with your experience. If you write about it this may help others who are trying to figure out if mushrooms may help them.  Again, I wish you the best of luck, but I'm pretty sure, from what I've read of what you've already written, that you are well-prepared and should be ready to take the plunge."

Are you asking if there are any psilocybin-containing mushrooms that also contain some other compound which could potentially kill someone? The answer is a hard no. If you're asking if they're mushrooms out there that are poisonous that look a little like mushrooms that active, the answer is yes.  I don't know what else you could be trying to ask here. And I don't know why you'd find the idea of a certain species of fungi not being poisonous as if all fungi must be poisonous in some way.  *edits- to be fair, there are the Amanita muscaria, which contain ibotonic acid, that, while not ""poisonous"" in the sense of killing you, will make you quite sick. But this converts to Muscimol with heat and drying, which is the active compound in that mushroom species. But, there's no psilocybin in A. Muscaria so it's besides the point anyway. Also, psilocybin is thought to have evolved to ward off pests so it could be thought of as a ""poison"" in itself. Although not to humans. Chocolate is terrible for dogs, but not people. Same thing.

I grow my own sometimes and you never know what you'll get without first trying them. If at all possible, take an even lower dose for your first time to see how you react to them, then wait 2+ weeks (I recommend a month really) before slightly upping the dose. Be sure to take the mushrooms on an empty stomach (2 to 3 hours after your last meal.) Taking them on an empty stomach will help them kick in sooner and stronger.  Also, if you've used LSD recently, please take note that there will be a cross tolerance. That is to say that if you took LSD recently it will affect your tolerance to mushrooms.  Please consult this thread (it has a handy graph) about LSD and mushroom tolerance:   http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/479297-The-Big-amp-Dandy-LSD-amp-Shroom-Tolerance-FAQ-and-Discussion-Thread   Your tolerance should go back to baseline (no tolerance) at 2 weeks or more since your last dose.  Have you guys tripped on anything before?"
shrooms,3buw9p,kiggidykog,9,Thu Jul 2 10:13:41 2015 UTC,"It sounded like an interesting trip, though I don't think what you experienced was in fact ego-death.   A lot of people confuse the realization of ones place in the universe, as ego death, even though its the exact opposite thing.   This is taken from another post from /r/psychonaut which explains it much further than my experience can:  ""The ego is a self-referential, personal definition of who you are. For example, I have two siblings, a mom, and a dad, so I identify myself as a member of that family. I also explore my mind and take interest in psychedelics, so I identify myself as a psychonaut. I am (insert real name here), who likes to play tennis and play guitar. It's an endless feedback loop. ""  ""Ego death is when you separate the ego from your mind, and you simply observe from an undefined point in space. ""You"" are there, but ""you"" are not aware of yourself in any way. You are observing, but not analyzing or thinking, and there is no emotion""  As soon as people start referencing their ""ego-death"" with phrases such as ""I felt..."" or ""I was...."" or ""I experienced..."" means they didn't experience ego-death. You are totally separated from your sense of self. There was no ""you"" to experience anything.  Im not trying to be over critical or anything, you sounded like you have a generally positive trip in the end, and it sounds like quite an experience, but I don't think it was ego-death. :}  The quotations are from /r/Psychonaut user /u/Corndog_Enthusiast From the thread ""ELI5: Ego Death"""

Salicinus only grew in Europe, but on the Shroomery's hunting guide location's thing it said that they were found in this region, although it was very rare. IMO it looks most similiar to Salicinus but I could totally be wrong.

Just kidding I use grow kits myself due to convenience and have no complaints about the amount of shrooms i get etc. Is this a supra grow kid? If it is I read alot of people saying to buy a proper filter bag rather than using the filter bag provided but yours seems to be doing fine.  I'm not an expert on these things at all but i would leave the pins pressing up against the tub if I were you. Someone may overrule me but I have never removed them and they haven't caused any bother before. You probably risk contamination more by removing them than you do just leaving them.   Once you have harvested all the shrooms and are resetting the kit thats the time when I usually remove any of those pins that grow on the side or the bottom.   Looks pretty normal to me, just keep spraying the bag daily and airing a couple of times a day. I noticed from the pictures you do not have a heat mat, I would recommend getting one. I did a few grows without them and I brought one this time around and it has made a big difference in the yield. They are pretty cheap to get hold of, i got mine for 13 euros."

You want to firmly grasp, twist and pull the shroom off the cake at the base. If they are all together they are in a cluster and you can gently pull them apart. This will break the mycelium that is holding them all together but not pull the shrooms from the base. This won't work as well if the shroom is in the middle of a cluster though as it'd be to hard to seperate.  Other than that, it's semi rare that a cluster wouldn't all be ready to harvest within 8-12 hours of each other. Are you sure the 3 smaller shrooms aren't aborts and the only survivor was the big one?  Pictures would help a lot."

Great big trip, fits of uncontrollable laughing, incredibly vivid open eye visuals, better to remain seated on the floor heavy body load; none of that clinging to the old reality to get in the way.    I'm reluctant to do trip reports but it was a whole freaking lot stronger that what I hear people describe off of 2.5 grams here.

shrooms,3bnd0d,Carnagh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"I did a lot of mushrooms in my late teens, then didn't have any for twenty-odd years... Had a chance to reintroduce myself to a bit of acid last year, and just a wee while ago some mushrooms this year.  Anyway, that's just a little context... What I've realised trying a few mushroom trips recently is how ridiculous my trips were as a teenager. I wont get into details as the numbers would sound a bit silly, but we used to come back from Dartmoor with them in a carrier bag.  And yeah the feeling tended to be that the best way to jump in was with a dose that would put you on your back so you couldn't really do yourself any harm... Not saying that was a good idea, and I saw that go wrong for one individual, but otherwise it seemed to work out well.  In hindsight... If you have limited opportunity... say the chance crops up and it may not do so again for a while, I'd probably advise someone to be a little bold perhaps. In that case 3.5g is probably what you want to try on for size the first time, and it is moderately bold, but not foolish.  If you've the ready prospects to try it out over a period of time... why rush? Low doses are a lot of fun if you want to be cautious. Start with 1.5g and have a colourful giggle with really good music.  I'd advise a lot more caution with lsd than mushrooms, which can be equally intense, but for me at least seem a lot less edgy.  And for the record... the one person I saw having a rough time on a large dose wasn't technically having a rough time to begin with. They were having an orgasmic time and were just repeating over and over ""Awwww Woooowww!"", and couldn't be talked away from it, they were utterly enraptured... After about 30min of this everybody else freaked and screamed at him quite hysterically... and he went silent... for the rest of the trip... then went home... It was really unfortunate all the way round, and I look back on it with genuine regret, but everybody involved was probably too young to handle it well... The guy was okay after the fact, but he really did have his parade pissed on."

shrooms,3bprlz,chronicdemonic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:02:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for you input!  There's about 4 inches of perlite. Soaked it and drained it before placing it in the chamber. It's been about a week since birthing. I'll wait another week before dunking  the cake.   Should I add another inch of perlite and also resoak the perlite already in there?
shrooms,3bprlz,chronicdemonic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:00:07 2015 UTC,"Could you take a pic of your FC? It's possible you don't have enough perlite which would imply your humidity is low. Also, a week is still early - in my experience, cakes may take upwards of 2-3 weeks to fruit. Even if they fruited invitro in the jar during colonization.  I don't think resoaking perlite is necessary. Just make sure to mist 3-4 times a day, enough to cover the cakes in tiny droplets of water, and then fan more afterwards; every other hour if possible, to encourage evaporation which will in turn trigger pinning.  As for dunking, if you did it before birthing into your fruiting chamber I think it's not necessary to dunk again. If you see signs of the cake being dehydrated (blue bruising, cake weighs less when you pick it up) then you might consider dunking to rehydrate. But I say, give it another week first."

This has helped me greatly in how I interact with the world post-trip. Paraphrasing:   ""A warrior must know first that his acts are useless, and yet, he must proceed as if he didn't know it. In other words, a warrior must know he is unimportant, but act as if he is important. That's a shaman's controlled folly. Nothing being more important than anything else, a warrior chooses any act, and acts it out as if it mattered to him.  ""A warrior has no honor, no dignity, no family, no name, no country; he has only life to be lived, and under these circumstances, his only tie to his fellow men is his controlled folly. One must strive without giving up, without a complaint, without flinching, until one sees, only to realize then that nothing matters. You're too concerned with liking people or with being liked yourself. A man of knowledge likes, that's all. He likes whatever or whoever he wants, but he uses his controlled folly to be unconcerned about it.  ""Thus a man of knowledge endeavours, and sweats, and puffs, and if one looks at him he is just like any ordinary man, except that the folly of his life is under control. Nothing being more important than anything else, a man of knowledge chooses any act, and acts it out as if it matters to him. His controlled folly makes him say that what he does matters and makes him act as if it did, and yet he knows that it doesn't; so when he fulfills his acts, he retreats in peace, and whether his acts were good or bad, or worked or didn't, is in no way part of his concern. A warrior may choose to remain totally impassive and never act, and behave as if being impassive really mattered to him; he would be rightfully true at that too, because that would also be his controlled folly."""

shrooms,3bltn3,gerfw1,2,Tue Jun 30 07:14:26 2015 UTC,"I have as well, at least I think it is the same type of feeling. For me it is a more sustained and mild sensitivity to what feels like electric/magnetic pulses(Not science just feeling)  It feels like a grid around me and as I move through it I can feel hairs on my skin stand up or physical sensations of touch. I also hear the buzzing sound ever so slightly."
shrooms,3bltn3,codey_coder,2,Tue Jun 30 08:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly as you described. It happens most as I begin to sink deeper into the metal space. My mind once created this auditory ""picture"" of a serene nature space with running water and chirping birds. This soundscape crept through the back of my mind and so I closed my eyes and attempted to invite it to the forefront of my consciousness. The sounds got louder and more crisp until it felt like I was on a threshold between that world and mine. As I felt like I was about to ""cross over"" that electrical snapping sensation grabbed me and shook me out of it. Not unpleasant just unexpected."
shrooms,3bltn3,sativan,2,Tue Jun 30 12:42:15 2015 UTC,"I would say it was almost unpleasant for me.

I basically use spores to grow the mycelium in rye and case it with coir. When I make new jars I keep one full jar to dump some colonized rye seed into the uncolonized jars. What do you mean by isolating & cloning?"
shrooms,3bl969,TheHouseCalledFred,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"Well you can take a fully grown specimen from any noncontaminated substrate and then (under sterile procedures) take a piece of the inside tissue and drop it on an agar plate.   From there mycelium will begin growing among the plate and then you basically cut out small portions of where the mycelium is different in growth and transfer to a new plate. After a few properly done transfers you'll have what's called a monoculture, which is where it's almost all the same genetics.   Then you test the strains by growing them in rye or whatever substrate/spawn and see how it does. From there you can choose what strains you think did better and expand upon it.   I'd advise looking more on the shroomery forums about this, I am not very experienced, this is just information i have learned and have been very interested in."

I just sit down and eat until I don't want to anymore.""* Five grams is the sweet spot- I guess aim for exactly that. Also note that when you're with other people you tend to notice the head-fuckery a little less. There's just something about being around other people in bright light that takes away from OEV's and also keeps you from ""spiraling out"" for the most part. But five g's should hit hard either way. High doses are fun, I actually don't like smaller doses. Just feels like I'm waiting for the space ship to take off and it just never does :/ End up with that 'what now' feeling and a bunch of anxiety. Be brave man, no biggie. 🍄   found the actual quote- Quote:   RogerRabbit said: I've said it before, but scales are for little girls. You should sit down and munch until you're full.  I've eaten well over 30 dry grams before.  Remember, there is no OD threshold for psilocybin, so eat all you want. Besides, 2 grams dry is for very, very, very little girls.

To me, using a scale is a helpful tool to ensure you are eating the exact amount for the kind of trip you want. You then also know how much to dose for your next trip based off what you weighed out your previous trips. I guess I just see not using a scale as a bit sloppy and unpredictable"

I filled up half a teacup and slammed it then filled it again and drank that after I ate the mushrooms. The reason I believe it potentiates the mushrooms is cocoa has naturally occurring chemicals that in large qualities can have relaxing effects and stimulate certain receptors (like anandamide the molecule THC mimics) and can actually be Drank to feel a buzz all on its own.

shrooms,3bih0v,EagerPlantStudent,3,Mon Jun 29 14:25:18 2015 UTC,Mono tubs do not require misting. A fan in the room gently circulating air around is enough. Do not point the fan directly at the Monotub holes.  Your substrate should be at least a couple inches. 3-4 is plenty and over 4 you're probably getting too much substrate. Make your holes among the bottom at whatever height you want your substrate to be and fill the box up to the bottom of those holes. You want the substrate right at the level of those holes for proper gas exchange.

That was why I wanted to lay out my basic plan though: to make sure I wasn't mistakenly calculating 2+2=22  I know the shroom community is very DIY, and I don't want to go for a full ""kit,"" but for my first grow I've just ordered 5 pre-prepared sterilized rye bags from shroom supply. 5 might turn out to be overkill, but I want to prepare for the possibility that some might fail. Once they are fully colonized I'll mix with pre-pasteurized compost from the same source and put it all in a monotub. (Still debating whether or not I'll also use their casing mix)  I'm completely open to the idea of a full DIY process in the future, but for my first grow there is great appeal in controlling variables and reducing vectors for contamination/screw-up."

If you like cannabis, vape/smoke immediately after downing the smoothie to get in the mood. Actively try to ""inspire inspiration""; listen to sweet music, check out new visual art, etc... And try to come up with something to draw/paint/design/whatever. You'll probably be coming up pretty hard by the time you've decided on an idea. This is good; it will help you really capture the craziness of the trip. Your perception will be totally off, and you'll probably make a lot of mistakes, but the small imperfections is what makes a lot of art cool and fun. Last time I painted a 7-legged giraffe, but I only painted 6 legs, so I later had to turn 1 leg into 2 legs, which made it look even more ridiculous.  I highly suggest creating something while tripping. It's fun."

shrooms,3bgopl,ImNotFunny420,2,Mon Jun 29 01:48:50 2015 UTC,"There's no way to know for sure how shrooms will affect you, but 2.5 is a pretty reasonable dose if you don't have any significant mental concerns. Anxiety is not unusual, and trying to fit into our society almost should be accompanied by some anxiety, so I wouldn't worry too much as long as you're able to ""look normal"" when you have to. That said, safe and comfortable environment (and responsible sitter) are important just to be on the safe side. For most people, 2.5 is somewhere in the threshold of being in and out of control, so you can probably pull it together if you have to. Much stronger than 2.5 and you're getting into the territory of surrendering control to whatever lessons the shrooms have to teach you, so it's important to have responsible support around you should you need it. Good luck. And remember, what you resist persists, and what you feed grows, so it's valuable to have something like basic meditation skills to learn to allow uncomfortable feelings without fixating on them."
shrooms,3bgopl,tanvanman,2,Mon Jun 29 03:41:24 2015 UTC,"Set and setting is key. Where you trip and who you trip with can greatly impact how you feel. Go in confident and if you start to get anxious or feel a bad trip approaching, change location/music."
shrooms,3bgopl,LysergicallyCharged,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:16:56 2015 UTC,"IME shrooms are much less likely than LSD to amplify anxiety. Do you have any experience with LSD? And in addition, I think you're taking the perfect amount if you're worried about being anxious. I wouldn't take any more, but that's a great starting point and probably not enough to give you bad symptoms.    Another thing that can help is to do something like writing a message to yourself on your hand or something. If you write ""You're on drugs, the world is same as always, it will pass soon."" It may seem extreme but it's mostly just precautionary, and that will be more than enough to get you out of any sort of signs of a bad trip - IF that even happens! The most likely scenario is you'll be so blissed out by how awesome, cool and hilarious everything is that you'll laugh at yourself later for even worrying. :) Best of luck!!!"

Typically we experience things like smell and not smell, body and not body, vision and not vision, mind and not mind, etc.   In large doses your brain stops trying to uphold duality and synthesia begins occurring. If you close your eyes, your brain has no reason to think there's one there so you stop experiencing it.   Meditating and focusing on breathing is interesting when you feel out of body. Try feeling the sensation of your lungs expanding, it's definitely there it just gets crowded out if you don't focus on it.   On my hardest trips I've experienced loss of self too.

Sterilize some seed or grain, and then just introduce some sections of mycelium into them. Just make small cuttings and quickly get them into the grain/seed in a SAB. Move on from there doing g2g to build spawn. I'm sure you could make a liquid inoculant out of it, but that's not my thing, so I won't speak on it. I'm sure someone else has experience with that. I've never seen the point."

shrooms,3bbxe3,rhizomorphicoreos,3,Sat Jun 27 19:44:01 2015 UTC,"No vermiculite, no flour, only bird seed or corn or rye seed or wheat berries, etc.  you're gonna have to look up how to prepare these things. I'll give you the bird seed prep: Rinse the seed well. Place in pot and fill with hot water. Leave overnight. Rinse off the seed again and allow to drain for several hours. Spread them out on paper towels after that to really remove excess water. Once they aren't clumping together as much, place into any sized or shape jar about 3/4 of the way. Pressure cook for 90 mins. Allow to cool. Inoculate in sterile conditions. Allow to colonize. Once it has colonized a 35-40% chunk of the visible substrate, bang the jars on a bike tire or roll of tape carefully to break up growth and distribute it throughout the seed. Once it's been 100% colonized you break it up again the same way (make sure you've left some room at the top so this is possible) and mix with a pasteurized substrate. I use 30/20/50 manure/vermiculite/coco coir. This mix should be put into a tub that will also serve as the fruiting chamber. here's everything you need to know about monotubs It's a long road ahead, but PF tek is for a small personal stash...it's not something that produces well. And if you managed to get a culture going on agar with some dried cubes- my hat's off to you sir. This shouldn't be hard at all."

shrooms,3bbbrx,Magic-M,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"Lemon tek will only bring you to plateau faster, I don't think it exponentiates the effect though.  Although, the faster the psilocin enters your brain the more time you have with very crisp visuals.  That is the only difference IMO is the visuals get a kick in the pants from the lemon tek.  I grind them, make a tea, and swallow the mush at the bottom of the cup.  Takes 20 minutes to prepare and the only unpleasant part is swallowing the mush at the bottom.  An hour in if I dose another half it extends the trip for about as long as I can handle it.  It's perfect for me."

Many people urinate far more than usual, some always need to poop, some people feel like they have to poop, but can't. I'm really not aware if any ""cure"" or helpful hint to this. But I have noticed it really isn't everytime. In my experience it only seems to happen when I'm indoors, near a bathroom. When it's a day trip, and I'm out with friends I notice very little along the lines of ""gotta go"" feelings. I rarely enjoy a trip indoors at night, it's almost always too intense....I guess would be the word. I just seem to focus on every little thought and flash of discomfort. I never feel that way during day trips outdoors. The difference is night and day. Try it out, just try not to worry about these things.

shrooms,3b7n06,Auraxicus,23,Fri Jun 26 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"The law of really big numbers plays a part, as it does for all of life- you won't find Psilocybe growing on every piece of manure globally.   Psilocybe cultivation attempts to ensure 100% success but this isn't required in nature for future generations; it just takes one fungus reaching fruition.   Dung and wood are the two most common substrates of Psilocybes, substrates which are not hosts to their attackers and allow the Psilocybes to get a foothold and put up their own defense systems. Once established if a fungus (not just Psilocybe) senses it is at risk of being killed/extricated from the substrate it produces mushrooms before dying off. It can't run away, but it can give the next generation a shot.  So it's a mix of the spores growing/succeeding where it is favorable for them, and death shortly after germination for places that aren't."

shrooms,3b7qpi,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:56:15 2015 UTC,rhizomorphicoreos already gave a great reply but i just wanted to add that my recent harvest took nearly 2 weeks to start pinning. I started getting worried around the 2 week mark but overnight dozens of pins showed up. Just dont pick up the cakes to look around for pins. Really fucked up my first grow by touching them too much.

shrooms,3b9tls,fleshmissile,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:01:47 2015 UTC,"Four days is just long enough a consolidation period to not cost you time fruiting. They look great. Only thing I could say is get it off the ground- get at least five inches of space between the table surface and the bottom of the tub. Also, the humidifier isn't necessary when you've got perlite, but if you must rock it, rock away, good sir.  Good job, good luck and keep us posted :) 🍄"
shrooms,3b9tls,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:24:36 2015 UTC,Thanks man! I'll work on moving it around a bit. I know both humidifying methods weren't needed but I originally wasn't gonna do the humidifier but decided too after I purchased the perlite and didn't want to waste it so I figured fuck it can't hurt. I know it's kinda hard to tell from the pictures but do you think my airflow will be a problem? The terrarium has about 50 3/16 holes around with 18 on the front and back and about 8 on either side. Do you think this is sufficient for CO2 exhaust or should I make the holes bigger? Again thanks for the reply and I'll definitely be keeping a record here!
shrooms,3b9tls,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"You need vents on the bottom and top as well. You don't want water pooling up. Keeping it close to walls hurts airflow as well. Take it easy on the humidity, too much is actually a bad thing. You want moisture to condense on the surface of the substrate, and quickly evaporate off. Bombarding the tub with an overabundance of moisture will cause water buildup on the bottom and hurt the overall pinset.  Get holes on the top and bottom, and go easy on the humidity. Think of a patch of mushrooms growing on a cow patty in a field. It's not living in a fog bank but there's a good dew in the morning, and hopefully it's shady and breezy with some good humidity in the air. More isn't necessarily better. Keep it simple and get that air cycle right."

The mycelium needs to be able to breathe, the gas built up during colonization needs to exchange. This is accomplished by using a porous material such as polyfil, filter disks, micropore tape or Tyvek that will allow this gas exchange while filtering out contaminant mold spores and bacteria/bacterial endospores. You haven't introduced the spores into the medium yet, let alone have a bunch of mycelium building up gas. Just switch out the tape. Take off the tape that's there and replace it with one of the materials listed above. No, you don't have to do this in a SAB. No, it won't contaminate everything, you have a vermiculite barrier, remember? Some people don't use anything to cover these holes and rely solely on the verm barrier D: This is why people say PF tek is easy. It's almost idiot proof.

If they're ready to be birthed by the time you leave, and have been so for at least five days, you can just go ahead and put the FC (provided you built it properly) and you can just come back to harvest your first flush. If it's not done you can put them in the fridge (but you said ""no freezer"", so I guess that's out. Although I figured of course no freezer, you never put anything in the freezer man!).

Boiling water is too hot, you'll want the water to be at the starting point of boiling, then turn it down a wince and let it go from there.   Also, as for storing ground up shrooms, shroom water/tea, you'll wanna make that to order. Psilocybin and psilocin degrade when they come in contact with oxygen and heat.

shrooms,3b6i1v,EmbraceTheMurtian,5,Fri Jun 26 12:29:37 2015 UTC,From what ive read the psilocin is what really makes you trip and what crosses the blood brain barrier (not 100% about that last part) but your stomach will break down everything before having a chance to convert too much of the psilocybin. Putting it in citric acid begins the process of that conversion outside your body so when you eat it you have a lot more psilocin ready to be immedietely absorbed.  I havent done it much but whenever ive lemon tekd it seemed like a pretty strong trip. My friends who tried it felt the same and that it intensified it.

Of course, you can't ever say this ""correctly"", but you can say it in ways that are less likely to be misunderstood.  The ego is who you THINK you are. The ego is NOT who you are, it's not the ""I"" element of the soul. It's like clothes that you wear on your real self.  Who you are IS who you are. You ARE indeed who you are, but everything you would normally think about that ""who"" is wrong. For example, I am who I am, but I may still think that my name is John and that I'm a nice person or whatever. That's not who I am. I simply am, and there's nothing more I can really say without being wrong.  When people say they took a lot of acid, then they died and then they were floating around in nothingness, with no personality, no concepts, no nothing... And then started to panic because they thought they had died, they're missing an important thing that they could have known right there: if you know you're dead, then how can you be dead? Yes you may think your body is dead, but if you know your body is dead, then you must be something beyond your body, which isn't dead. The point is, whatever you are, you exist, because you're conscious.  When you take drugs to dissolve your ego, your ego does dissolve temporarily. But YOU stay there. That's the most important thing, and it's easy to overlook it. If you witness the loss of your ego, and if you witness nothingness, if you know about what is or isn't happening, if you can later remember what happened and talk about it, then YOU were THERE when it happened. Maybe you didn't say to yourself ""hey I died but I'm still here to witness it"", but that's what happened. You died and you remained aware of you being dead. Obviously, you didn't die if you witnessed yourself dying. It sounds stupid but if you know anything about anything then you obviously exist in some form. Except there's not much else you can say about it. Yes, you exist, but you can't grasp who you are and what you are, what your name or identity is, and perhaps you can't even have thoughts or emotions. You may not be the body, you may not be the mind. But you exist. THAT is who you really are."

shrooms,3b4x80,Bout_To_Shit_Fuck_Up,7,Fri Jun 26 04:26:12 2015 UTC,"Do you not believe that your mind has a sense of self?  *Edit: in other words, do you not believe that you consciously experience having an identity?"
shrooms,3b4x80,srdyuop,0,Fri Jun 26 04:29:12 2015 UTC,"It must be perfectly understood that seeing a sight is 'seeing'. Hearing a sound is 'hearing'. Everybody seems to be split minded with a chaotic schizophrenia in the western world... Thinking a thought is 'thinking'. The 'you' that you think exists is just another member in the stream of thoughts. Also, when you describe what something is, a scientist will list the things that it does. Just as u/embracethemurtian has tried to state below me, if I am to tell you who I am, I start to list everything that isn't normally referred to as me. The bottom line is that you are not this thing or ego in a bag of skin, walking around this planet."

You're correct, you are not an ego but you still have an ego. It's an interaction system for how you deal with the world. They aren't real or dont exist in the sense that they aren't tangible but they are in the sense that they're a daily and easily identifiable pattern of thoughts/beliefs that guide actions."
shrooms,3b4x80,EmbraceTheMurtian,0,Fri Jun 26 06:07:27 2015 UTC,"The notion that you 'have' and ego is just another thought. You said it yourself, too, that it is an 'interaction system for how you deal with the world'. If that is what an ego is, then what about the self being defined as the ego as mentioned earlier? Who is it that needs an 'interaction system for you to deal with the world'? Who is the you in that statement? Does this help elaborate it a little?"
shrooms,3b4x80,Bout_To_Shit_Fuck_Up,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:14:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are perfectly correct. It isn't necessarily that certain drugs cause your ego to die, but rather that you may be more aware that identity, ego, doesn't actually exist at all and is only a construct of your conscious experience. This is partly due to diminished prefrontal cortex activity caused by certain drugs."
shrooms,3b4x80,srdyuop,0,Fri Jun 26 05:42:09 2015 UTC,"And I agree too. It's just that, more times than not, there are people who fervently believe that it actually exists.

I am a human living on the planet known as Earth and I use societal guidelines that I learned growing up as a child to follow social norms pre agreed upon by everybody.   All of these things and many more relate to your ego and form it and create how you view yourself and in turn the world around you. On high doses of psychedelics all boundaries dissapear. The boundary between yourself and everything around you is gone. You are no longer a human who has taken a funny drug interacting with your environment. In fact there is no ""you"" to speak of. You dont know who/what/where you are. Its impossible to distinguish yourself as any different from anything. You simply are."

shrooms,3b6293,dumbassneedinghelp,3,Fri Jun 26 07:06:17 2015 UTC,"A trip is a very individualized thing. The best place to be is the place where YOU'RE most comfy. Of course you should take into consideration that you should trip where your friends are most comfy too. For my friends and I, we find that outside around a fire at night is the most comfortable setting. Would that be so if one of us had nyctophobia, that is, fear of the dark? Of course not. From my personal experience, I would recommend doing it with the sunrise/sunset while outside. For me, it radiates a very calming effect. As a word of advice, I would also recommend turning off anything that may cause you unwarranted stress or anxiety; turning off your phone, etc. As another word of advice, if things do turn ""bad"" per say, it's good to keep yourself anchored to reality. Remember that it will end, you will return to normal, your friends aren't plotting against you, etc. Have a plan if things turn sour for you or one of your friends; perhaps have a set up in a room with relaxing music and other things to help him/her relax? My final advice I could give would be to make sure you only trip with people whom you don't hold ill-tides for. If you're angry or hold any resentment towards a member of the group there is the possibility that it will eat at your mind and be the only thing you can think of during the trip. Talking these issues through will undoubtedly help.   As for the dosage, for a first timer I've heard everything from 2 grams to a full eighth. Of course there is no idea knowing how potent they are until you eat them, so I would recommend doing around 2.75-3 grams for your first time. This too is very individualized, as you can do an eighth of the strongest and still be okay if your mindset and control is good. (Although, I definitely wouldn't recommend this for the first time)  Above all, remember to relax and enjoy yourself. If you have any other questions, feel free to message me."
shrooms,3b6293,demureness,2,Fri Jun 26 10:14:17 2015 UTC,HI :) Do you think it would be better for a first-timer to do the lemon tek for better potency?
shrooms,3b6293,kazumicortez,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:12:09 2015 UTC,"Lemon tek seems to act as a catalyst of sorts to speed up and intensify the trip. For the first time I would personally recommend doing it without the lemon tek, just so you can get a more pure idea of how you feel for the first time. There is always next time, and this way you have a lower chance of overdoing it. :)"
shrooms,3b6293,demureness,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"thanks! i'll drop the dosages for some of them to 1.5-2g and i might go a little higher. i slightly over 2 tabs of lsd at a festival recently and my mind held up positively, so hopefully that's an indication of what's to come with shrooms?"
shrooms,3b6293,demureness,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:49:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really have any experience with LSD, but I do know that starting with a lower dose will minimize any chances of overdoing it. You can always increaese dosage the next time assuming you enjoy it. There is no need to rush into any dose size that is large. Another thing to remember is that they may also take some time to work their magic. It varies greatly between my friends and I. Don't tempt yourself to eat more just because you haven't noticed any effects when you think you would expect them. :)"
shrooms,3b6293,demureness,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:01:47 2015 UTC,thanks! ill try lower. what's the typical break between shroom trips to be safe?
shrooms,3b6293,happiefish,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:55:37 2015 UTC,"Generally it's best to wait a week or two between trips so you feel the ""full affect"" of the latter trip. If you meant between dosing, there is honestly no telling how long. I've read some stuff about it not affecting people for up to an hour after they ingest them. In general, give yourself a longer window period if you ate before ingesting, as it will interfere with how fast your stomach digests them."

Moving from day to night / night to day is so freaking cool!  Day trips are bright and colourful and fun and as it gets dark things get mysterious, it's like one part of life goes to sleep but another different part is now waking up. Or when you've been tripping all night, daybreak is like rebirth... It's kinda hard to put into words. You'll get the idea :p"

shrooms,3b5e6x,PM_ME_YOUR_LUNATICS,2,Fri Jun 26 02:49:17 2015 UTC,I think it's a bit ambitious to aim for ego death etc on your very first trip. It's nothing like being stoned or drunk and nothing can prepare you for it. My advice is to just have fun and see where the trip takes you. Enjoy nature and laugh and play. Save the ego death and serious navel-gazing for later trips.

Since your in the field of psychology I'm actually really excited for you because I would almost guarantee it will have a profound impact on you and your line of work. Once you experience it you'll be ready for the next trip, and that's when you can start to do and experience some pretty awesome things.

shrooms,3b4e1d,EverGreenPLO,3,Thu Jun 25 23:35:58 2015 UTC,I don't think the aborts are really a sign of things being off in this case. There is a very tight clustering of shrooms at that spot on the cake and the bigger ones that started growing first will choke out the newer pins that form and cause them to become aborts. I will agree that it looks like OP might not have enough FAE though since the shrooms look kind of long and thin

It won't affect your trip. However, and I don't have any evidence for this, it might be best to let the prozac even out and start showing its effects before you take any seriously mind altering substances (like shrooms). If you've only been taking it for three days you'll still be in the trial period where you need to see how your body reacts to the drug. Any problematic reactions you might have with prozac generally don't manifest until several days or a week after starting your full regimen. Because of this, its probably best to maintain a constant baseline for yourself in terms of mind bending. My advice is to put the shrooms off until you know that prozac works for you for sure (about a month from starting your full regimen)"

shrooms,3b35qf,pedrobotella,3,Thu Jun 25 16:18:20 2015 UTC,If she's never done them before and is quite thin I'd say 1.5 to 2 grams. For you since you have a little experience 3.5 grams or less for you. This of course is dried weight.  Since you're not using dried shrooms multiply that by 10. So 15 to 20 grama for her and somewhere less than 35 for you. I'd go with 25 just because you haven't done that strain before and it's better to be safe and handle it than not be able to handle it.

shrooms,3b2b8y,sativan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:42:05 2015 UTC,"AFAIK drying doesn't lose enough potency to be noticeable. Technically drying increases the Potency/Weight ratio, although such an observation should be obvious. Freezing fresh mushrooms damages the delicate structure of the fruit by expanding the water inside and exploding cell walls.  Dry, then freeze. Your 3g trip will still feel like a 3g trip.  Edit: I know nothing about Weroroas. I operate under the assumption that they behave in a similar fashion, and do not recommend freezing while the fruit bodies still contain water."

Eric and Chad had known each other for about 5 years. Both of them were pretty chill guys and I hung out with them pretty regularly. I've taken shrooms with both of them probably a dozen times as well as having done DMT, LSD, Al-LAD, MXE, DOM, 4-AcO-DMT and probably a few other drugs with them so I figured they could be trusted when it came to drugs. They were living together and Eric had shrooms growing in his room. This situation went on for about a year until the two got into a fight over some petty shit. That's when Chad showed his true colors. When it was clear that he was in the wrong and couldn't win the argument, he pulled out his phone and dialled 911. He proceeded to tell the operator about all the drugs in the house and even said that Eric was threatening him with a gun. Sure enough, a team officers show up to the house with their guns drawn several minutes later. After seeing that shit go down and watching one of my really good friends nearly have the rest of his life fucked over by someone I would've trusted with just about anything, I really don't think you should trust anyone. And that snitching didn't even happen as a result of a plea deal or some bullshit. I can't imagine how fast that fucker would have cracked if he was sitting in jail looking at prison time and was offered a deal."

If possible, have a sober ""trip sitter"", or an experienced tripper to guide you. If not possible, have someone who knows you're tripping and can help if possible.)    Then there's a few tips: 1. Relax. 2. Don't try to ""big dose"". No cool points given for going too hard and tripping out. 3. Relax. Let whatever happens happen, and go with the flow. 4. Respect the mushroom. Realise that you're dealing with an unknown, and explore responsibly. 5. Relax. Remember that wherever it takes you, it is temporary. 6. Try to eat less before tripping. I've found that half a snickers bar gets rid of the horrible taste though. 7. Relax. And enjoy your journey.

I think you might be overstressing ""sterile"", The only places that have to be sterile are the insides of the jars/substrate, and the needle used to inject spores. Unless you are doing something more complex like creating spore syringes from prints you might be over thinking it.   Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, Target, Aldi, Rite Aid, Etc all sell isopropyl"

shrooms,3azizg,shroomthrowaway12,2,Wed Jun 24 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"Bruising before fruiting is generally a sign that it's drying out. If it's in a bin with perlite, make sure there are holes on the bottom as well as all the sides, and make sure the perlite isn't packed down. Air needs to get through there and wick moisture into the air properly. It's also possible that during the ""dunk and roll"" you handled them a little too rough and caused some bruising. Kinda hard to do when the cakes are young. But it's possible. Couldn't hurt to make sure your SGFC is working correctly."
shrooms,3azizg,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:26:53 2015 UTC,Would it be a good idea to dunk it a second time?
shrooms,3azizg,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:39:18 2015 UTC,"No, mushrooms have not yet begun to take the water out of it, if it's drying out, it's drying out on the surface. Fix any air flow/humidity problems and simply mist the surface of the cake well, to moisten the vermiculite you rolled it in, then let them be."
shrooms,3azizg,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"So i misted the surface of the cakes but for some reason the bruising on the cakes became more distinct and spread out. Is this a problem?  http://imgur.com/a/9V7uc  Also I attached some pictures of my SGFC, I have holes drilled on all sides of it. Is the perlite layer too thick? What is possibly wrong with it?  Thanks so much!"
shrooms,3azizg,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:35:20 2015 UTC,"Hahaha ok man you went just a mile or seven to far with that mister. You wet the ever loving crap outta it! This is what you're looking at- There was a patch of aerial mycelium there- it dried out a little for one reason or another (that buggering fan!). This caused some bruising. When you went to try to dampen the surface- and that's all I meant was just mist lightly to dampen the surface- you went kinda crazy with it. The aerial mycelium that was already bruising got beat up even more by the mister, and also a larger section of it was bruised as well. That blueing you see at the base of your mushrooms now suffered the same stress- just being soaked and bombarded by a harsh mister. Make sure the mister you're using only let's out a faint mist. Be really gentle and back away from the tub when you use it. You only want a fine mist raining down, and you only want a few pumps. Put away the mister right now. put that shit in the closet for a good while- you won't be needing it for a long time. The next time you mist is when the verm on the outside of your cakes look dry- and then only very lightly. A proper SGFC doesn't need constant attention. So just leave it be until harvest.   Don't worry about anything, just leave it alone. Take a hands off approach from here on out.  The most important thing is vents on the bottom, under the perlite. Get the tub at least five inches off the ground. Fluff the perlite if it seems packed down. You want air to get through it, and get the airflow and humidity right.  There's nothing wrong with your cake, you're just beating the poor thing up. You're good now- just make sure the bins designed right, and everything will work itself out. Just don't do anything.  *edits- just looking at the pics again, Jesus it's so much bluey going on...  Really let them be, I hope the air gets around well in there. So blue...it's borderline scary"

I don't really eat during a trip, but when I do I crave fresh, clean food like fruit. I recommend having some on hand, never mind hunger, the textures and getting all sticky is really fun. Have LOTS of water on hand too.  Got to have? Sort out a good playlist of chilled happy music before the trip begins. Sorting through files on a pc or ipod while peaking is hard. If you are going to be smoking, you may want to roll a few blunts beforehand too, co-ordination gets sloppy :) Make the space comfortable. I like mattresses and blankets on the floor or out on the grass.   Like to do? Shower or bath. The heat and wetness is just so weird and awesome. Painting and drawing is fun. But being outside is really the best. Nature is the biggest trip of all."
shrooms,3axqbw,happiefish,3,Wed Jun 24 11:06:14 2015 UTC,"I think happiefish has covered all the bases here, but I just wanted to add to your last question:   What do you like to do during a trip?   You should let the mushrooms take you wherever they will take you.  Try to become a passenger on the trip and let the mushroom do the piloting.  The best way to accomplish this, is doing whatever feels good at that moment. To give you an example: Let´s say you want to stare at the clouds. Only do that if you feel like. If you force yourself to stare at the clouds, you will be fighting with yourself and that may lead to frustration, which will decrease the quality of the trip.   So what is the best thing to do during a trip? Just let go!"

If you trip inside make sure to have some nice lighting, as in a lamp, or maybe some Christmas lights. Something that isn't the plain overhead lighting. Its just very calming.  Don't go into it with a ton of expectations. You just gotta....be. If that makes any sense. Don't force it, just let it take you in.  I must agree, tripping outside is amazing.....especially if you want to feel like part of the earth.  Also, the one food that I found amazing while tripping was ""Sour Patch Kids Explosions!"" otherwise, I'm never really hungry.  Good vibes your way! :D"

My fiance and I love listening to nature sounds while tripping to be honest with you. She always puts on soft rain or a waves rolling in on a beach.   If you are doing it outside on a camping trip... don't play music at all. Listen to nature. Listen to the leaves rustling through the wind, birds singing, hopefully there is some water trickling through a creek nearby.   If you do prefer some music, I would do something along the line of either Zen relaxation music, or there is a station on Pandora called Tribal Relaxation. Just something simple with a nice melody that won't distract you too much.   Hope that helps friend!"

The eerie instrumentals of Thomas--A Perfect Circle left me feeling so frightened I called out for my SO, and I usually manage my feelings pretty well during trips. Then again, I am a giant pussy so YMMV. Other tracks by APC, however, especially ones with many layers, are a delight.  I also really enjoy listening to nature sounds or binaural beats with a sleep mask on in bed if I'm on a high dose.

shrooms,3auotq,Bobmannissniss,5,Tue Jun 23 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"This has beem explained a lot of times already, but here you go: You cut the opened cap off a fresh mushroom, put it on a piece of paper, cover it with a glass and leave it overnight. Then you remove the cap and you'll be left with a nice spore print."
shrooms,3avj2r,Throw_some_Ds,2,Tue Jun 23 21:03:28 2015 UTC,"I would say 2,5gr is a good dose, as for preparation you can do it wherever you feel comfortable. I think it's best to do it around your house because you usually have a sense of safety there and you can always just go for a walk and return, also the visual effects are very diminished in daylight. One thing to remember if your having any negative thougts is that you are NOT going insane, NOT dying, you will be totally fine, everything will pass.  Weed intensifies the effects quite a bit, take hits and wait a while before taking another to see if your comfortable with smoking more, smoking on the come-down can prolong the effects.   Hope this helps, have fun!"
shrooms,3avj2r,phacid,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:49:16 2015 UTC,"2.5 gr each? We also have no idea about pricing so what is a decent price range?   Yes, were planning on being home, after a short evening stroll, in a safe environment and we have one friend who is nearby on call...just in case. We have Adventure Time lined up and Interstellar.

shrooms,3avj2r,phacid,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"Yes each. Price is very different depending on your location but I would say around 12-20 bucks is what 5gr goes for in my area. Watching movies can be fun but you will notice you are too easily distracted during the peak to really enjoy them, just try and walk around a bit or even better lay down with your eyes closed and some good music (Closed eye visuals are way more awesome as open eye ones).

shrooms,3avj2r,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:13:55 2015 UTC,"Dosage- around 2 grams dried per person is a manageable amount for new comers.  Prep- make sure you don't have anything important to do, turn off your phone, do some hiking in the woods with friends. Anything mellow away from the busy world is good.  Other drugs- I'm not a purist, so other opinions vary. I think pot is a must when taking mushrooms, just be sure to roll joints beforehand because it will be difficult while tripping. It's better on the latter end of the trip, but a little bit before can help with anxiety on the come-up. Or make it worse. Depends on your tolerance I guess."

shrooms,3au6tn,FluffyPuppies,2,Tue Jun 23 15:20:31 2015 UTC,"When was your first time tripping on shrooms? Always keep a week between tripping because otherwise you can't feel the effects due to tolerance. Also, eating shrooms over a couple of hours is likely to result in very diminished effects, try to eat them in 15-30min (also, redosing is not possible). I strongly advice against taking 7gr because it is a very heavy dose and only for very experienced trippers. Hope this helps!"
shrooms,3au6tn,phacid,2,Tue Jun 23 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"Very well said.   Apart from that, they could just be weak shrooms. I have had quite a few trips on 3.5 that felt more like a microdose. And then, I tried to microdose on less than 2 grams and instead ended up having one of the biggest and most exciting trips I have ever been on.   Potency is weird from shroom to shroom. But, you should take everything you plan on taking all at once for the full effect. It isn't like weed where you can slowly work up to a good high.   I would suggest taking a quarter next time... all at once. That should let you know how potent and good the shrooms really are.   Best of luck friend. Hope you enjoy it."
shrooms,3au6tn,Sillycomic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"That discrepancy between potencies is why I was trying to gauge them out first. So if I need to gauge them by just taking a full dose all at once, do you have a standard amount that you eat first?"
shrooms,3au6tn,Sillycomic,2,Wed Jun 24 00:07:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 3.5 grams is standard for a full dose. That is about an eighth dried.   Microdose is anywhere from .5 to 1.5 grams.   And they call anything over 5 grams a heroic dose.   Yes, you take it all at once. Preferrably with some citrus, as they say that helps with potency. I like mine finely chopped in orange juice. My fiance has a weaker stomache and enjoys making tea with some lemon."
shrooms,3au6tn,phacid,2,Wed Jun 24 00:16:41 2015 UTC,"Ah wonderful, that was pretty much the answer I came here for, thanks. I'll probably try putting them in orange juice next time, I fancy myself some orange juice."
shrooms,3au6tn,xeyve,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:33:12 2015 UTC,"My first time was about 8 months ago. When I first took them I was told to eat a cap and two stems to assess the potency, and then eat more based off of that. That's what I was trying to do this time. So on my next trip I'll eat everything at once, do you think just an eighth will do?"

If you could upload a few more not-dried pictures I might be able to point you to a genus.  My guess from the picture you have up is Clitocybe like C. nuda.

shrooms,3au4zh,rhizomorphicoreos,2,Tue Jun 23 19:35:51 2015 UTC,I usually dry them using a two step process. 1) Place on a drying rack (like for cookies or whatever) in front of a fan on high. Give them a day of drying. 2) Buy some desiccant and build a little drying chamber. http://www.shroomery.org/images/DRY-3.GIF

shrooms,3au4zh,ZornsLemmon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:32:37 2015 UTC,"It's not going to stink up a whole room like smoking weed or anything. It will obviously smell a little earthy mushroomy if you're near it though. Once in a sealed desiccant chamber it shouldn't smell at all!  You can skip the fan drying if being discrete is that important, but I think fan drying works better on fresh shrooms than desiccant. I just use the desiccant chamber to get the shrooms from dry to cracker dry."

I could have easily fallen asleep on the park bench. I did have some mild CEVs though, jagged lines, fractals, a flash of blue Mayan pyramid covered in mycelium with a few pins, pretty cool.   Although no visuals outwardly, I still felt very much in control, just very sleepy and jelly legs (which would occasionally buckle slightly as I walked home). My biggest mistake was going to bed late and getting up early I think. I'll be trying 2.5g next time. How about you?  An interesting note, I got home from the park and lied down on the sofa. There was some time dilation, I thought I was asleep for hours but it was more like 1 hour 20 minutes. As I was drifting off to sleep with light fractals, I must have fallen asleep briefly, only to 'see' someone lean over me, wearing a wide-brimmed rice farmer's hat and say something like 'HEY' in a deep, gruff voice and jolt me awake briefly. I laughed afterwards and continued sleeping, my brother was sound asleep upstairs so it wasn't him. Maybe the mushroom wasn't impressed with me falling asleep at the good part?

shrooms,3arzvq,throwawayshrooms1,26,Tue Jun 23 01:09:56 2015 UTC,"Just about everything you're concerned about up there is complete hogwash.  The only sense in which it permanently changes you as a person is by the same mechanism any major life event changes you (and your first psychedelic trip is a major life event).    Consider the parallel to a ""real"" trip.  Imagine that you've never left your hometown (maybe you haven't, I don't know).  And you get an opportunity to travel to a foreign country.  It's very disorienting; the culture and customs are different, sometimes this can be a bit scary.  But it's exciting and you get to interact with people and places you've only read about.  It's a little weird to eat this one thing, and why do they say goodbye like that?  But this one thing they do, it's so much fun! I never even imagined I could have this much fun doing activity X!  And when you come back home, it's good to be home.  You're home, safe and comfortable.  But now you sit with this knowledge and understanding of a place entirely different than everything you grew up in.  And you're faced with a choice.  You can choose to become a traveler, and learn everything you can about the vast varieties of the human experience.  You become more open and accepting of other cultures since you've gone and seen that they might be weird over there, but they're good people.    But you can also choose not to.  The world is a huge, overwhelming place.  You can return to life as is.  The years go by and that one time you went in that fascinating trip will still always be a cherished memory, and you can't unsee the experiences you had.  But it's not forcing you to become a traveler.  That's up to you.   And that is the one way going on a psychedelic trip can permanently ""change"" you."

shrooms,3arzvq,Spaghetti_Already,9,Tue Jun 23 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"What made me want to try shrooms the first time was learning about the life and death of comedian Bill Hicks.  I highly recommend the documentary American: The Bill Hicks Story or the biography Love All the People.  Psychedelics do change you, but not so much your brain chemistry as your perception of things.  Many of us feel that was we see on shrooms is The Truth.  It strips away the filters, and my deepest insights are with my eyes closed and in as much silence as possible.  That said, shrooms reawakened my quest for enlightenment that I was on many years ago before I'd used any psychedelics or had any interest in them.  I am a psychonaut.  I explore inside my mind, my being, my existence.  This is common depending on the type of experience one has with psychedelics.  Just know that DMT, one of the primary molecules in shrooms is produced by your pineal gland and exists in almost every living thing. I also recommend the documentary DMT: The Spirit Molecule.  It can be found on Netflix and Youtube.  Personally, I do mushrooms alone with the exception of one friend I will do them with, and we have been friends for a very long time and we both seek inner peace and have a similar goal whenever we partake.  I am still the same person I was before, but I have more clarity about my existence on this blue marble and in the universe.  This happened after something called ""Ego Death.""  It is not real death, but you cease to be human for a time.  I experienced oneness with everyone (including you).  We all come from the same place and will return to it someday.  I have never had what one would describe as a ""bad trip.""  So far, they have all been very positive and pleasurable.  I no longer think of shrooms as recreational either.  They have become a tool to help me see beyond the veil.  They have helped me with physical pain, anxiety, and fear, which in turn helps me focus on my path so that one day I can see beyond the veil without the help of psychedelics.  All that said, remember that if you take them, your experience will depend on your mindset and your setting.  Be sure that there is someone sober or very experienced there to guide you should you become anxious or overwhelmed.  Feel free to ask about anything I've said here."

Nothing, someone told them it was awesome so they went for it, no searching on erowid or reddit for all this flawed information.

These symptoms were already there.The mushrooms unburied them and brought them into her conscious mind. It's known that mushrooms work on the amygdala and ""facilitates extinction of the classically conditioned fear response""  Now some people may think that this fear, may be something deep down that happened in her past. That is not necessarily the case. It could be some anxiety she is feeling right now that for her might be crushing, but for someone else it might me something trivial. Only she knows what those things are, she may not be aware of them, but she knows.   Talking about it might help, understand though that she may not want to talk about this with you. So if she said she wants to seek professional help, you should encourage that.   As far as the sleep is concerned, I know this will sound like cliche, but exercise helps a lot."
shrooms,3aryow,YearGood,2,Tue Jun 23 04:39:57 2015 UTC,Is she taking medication for her depression and anxiety?  Has she told you specifically what she experienced or described what frightened her so much or still frightens her?  Right now the best thing you can do is be reassuring.  Validate her feelings and let her know it's okay to feel those things and that you will help her in whatever way she wishes.    She may still find something positive from the trip if she confronts what it was she experienced.  Bad trips aren't uncommon but it's rare that there is no lesson to be learned.
shrooms,3aryow,Didymos_Black,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:34:32 2015 UTC,She isn't taking any medication right now because she wants to be able to feel normal on her own. She is however planning on going to therapy sessions since that's what she did when she first felt depressed. As for what caused the bad trip she says she doesn't remember she just got very confused and didn't know where she. She said she felt scared but she didn't know why and that freaked her out even more.
shrooms,3aryow,slious,0,Tue Jun 23 01:51:54 2015 UTC,"but how depressed is she? depressed that she missed her favorite show ( thats not depression, its dissapointment)  depressed that she is not having any fun ( thats not depression, thats bordem) so depressed she can not get out of bed, or function properly ( that's depression ) - and if she has that 'able to feel normal on her own is not going to work.  I hated the plasticly feel of prosac - but it gave me the change of mindset to fix shit.  A depressed person trying to become not depressed is like a cow dreaming they can fly. not without some major change will things change.  the immediate problem: how long has it been since her bad trip? Under a week? 2 g - thats not a lot - here's what i think happened - she got in a funky mindset - and tried to control it, or push it around, and spent all her energy smashing against a brick wall. if she is already depressed, then her energy does not rebound, she needs to do something to refill. how does an empty cup fill itself?  I'm hyper focused on the 'wants to feel normal on her own' statement - cause in my mind, its a sign that she isn't ready to change. I've been there. For me, the cuddling and comfort was reversed modivators - why change when there is no desperation?"
shrooms,3aryow,slious,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:04:50 2015 UTC,"Depressed enough that she's considered suicide, has broken down crying to me and often has trouble doing the social things she wants with her friends because she'll start to feel anxious and scared.  Also I feel the same way about the feeling normal on her own but it's pretty ingrained. I think she feels as though she's somehow weak or less of a person if she uses drugs. I think the stigma and idea that mental health is something you can just fix has poisoned her opinion against anti-depressants. Granted I do know people who suffered from depression and no longer use pills."
shrooms,3aryow,sativan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying one takes pills for the rest of their life. I was diagnosed, even hostipalized. I used the drugs as a means to flip the switch.  I hear and understand the thought that mental health is a fraud and it also doesn't help that the term depressed is used for when things don't go your way.   But then there's doing what's right for yourself. Who cares what other people think, if it works in the end isn't that what counts."
shrooms,3aryow,sativan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:10:32 2015 UTC,"We saw a doctor today and he wrote her a prescription for anti-anxiety/ depression medication. I think she's seriously considering it now that she's talked to a professional after he made her realize that doing nothing won't solve the issue. Thanks for all the advice, me and my girlfriend appreciate it"
shrooms,3aryow,domo_origato,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:39:20 2015 UTC,"The issue now is she still can only get a few hours of sleep a night and generally feels more depressed and anxious than before the trip.    I would say her diet is fucked and likely so her her circadian rhythym. Get her some B-complex vitamins to start off, get her some cereal with 100% daily supply of folic acid, get her yogurt and Yakult, get her spinach and bananas (greener is better for the skin than yellower). Make sure she wakes up the same time every single day, and she eats her yogurt and cereal and gets sunlight for one hour to start her circadian rhythm. Make sure she eats every four hours so she doesn't go into a stress response that triggers anxiety. Read labels and limit sugars, reduce caffeine intake, no caffeine after 3pm. Make sure she's getting fiber, lack of that will turn you into a ghost, high pulp Orange Juice is a easy source for that, but watch the sugar, 26grams per cup, that's almost an ounce, jeeze!  Her emotional condition has NOTHING to do with the shrooms and 100% with the fact your girlfriend is already a broken person who doesn't know how to take care of herself properly OR she'd have jumped right on what's wrong and fixed it before two weeks passed.  Get her on this diet/schedule thing and make it habitual and its a start of learning to care for herself.  Oh also for anxiety chopped onions, celery and romaine lettuce every single day. Helps with blood pressure and mastication helps with mental stimulation, soft diets are detrimental to mental health and acuity.  As someone else mentioned, exercise will naturally stimulate sleep hormones.  A nice long walk makes for a nice long nap."
shrooms,3aryow,LebManJoe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:59:25 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice. What i don't understand though is if this nothing to do with the shroom trip and is just a dietary issue why was she feeling and sleeping fine right before the trip?
shrooms,3aryow,LebManJoe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"She had anxiety and depression before the trip, so she has imbalances or sensitivities already, anything can trigger her to be out of balance if she's not constantly keeping herself in a balance with schedules and healthy diet.  Falling in love. Relationship stress. Job stress. Using drugs. erratic diet times. etc all can throw off her neurtransmitters and cause an anxiety response or depression.  Diet is super important for the condition she has  Mushrooms leave  a healthy person more sensitive, than before, and she's already overly sensitive.   Tell her to try ibruprofen once or twice a day, depression is an inflammatory stress response, and if she can ease the inflammation off her hypothalmus for a few hours she may find some relief. But of course if she relies on that instead of good diet and exercise she'll just die of liver or kidney failure with a bad headache eventually.  There are dozens of ways to relieve anxiety, so there's no excuse to suffer it needlessly. Peeling oranges, or eating oranges or bananas for starters."
shrooms,3aryow,LebManJoe,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:00:30 2015 UTC,"Shrooms can release a lot of inner demons, which can be overwhelming if you're not prepapred. It isn't just a ""fun"" drug like ecstasy.

shrooms,3an4dx,muddywater87,3,Mon Jun 22 13:47:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that we should not turn them away but i think this sub should be for psilocybin mushrooms only. True, not everyone knows the term Mycology, but that fact that there is a sub for other mushroom ID's means there is a proper place to put those ID requests. If people read the Sub's rules then they would know what to do. If it doesn't look active then comment telling them to go to /r/mycology.

I believe we should educate people on how to properly make an ID Request instead of redirecting them. I have never had a problem with ID request. If they don't follow the proper guidelines then maybe the Mods should delete the post, but i don't see why we wouldn't help people out. Some post are look a likes and warrant an ID request, but they just need to do it right. Minimum of three things: pic of top, pic of bottom, and spore print. If they don't have those things, then delete the post. Some are so obvious that its easy to say, ""not active"". But i just don't feel the need to get rid of them all together."

shrooms,3apy5c,BarryZZZ,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:00:23 2015 UTC,When I was drying them with a towel the towel did get quite blackened so I'd imagine they did rub on each other when they were all squashed up.  Anyone know if there is a known low dose that I could take to check for toxicity or is it just not worth the risk?
shrooms,3aocj6,fistyfetus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:12:47 2015 UTC,"New England area, I usually get Cubensis but these are clearly different.

shrooms,3aocj6,Brooklyyyn23,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:14:12 2015 UTC,Soft is no Bueno. It means they weren't dehydrated correctly. I'm no expert but they do seem to have some cube like properties.
shrooms,3aocj6,mystery_disease,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:31:56 2015 UTC,"they aren't really soft, I know they are dry because the bruising is fine and they all are right, but the caps feel kinda flimsy, maybe just thinner"

shrooms,3an83w,psykeymykey,6,Sun Jun 21 21:50:58 2015 UTC,"Give it 3-5 more days. Just because you're not seeing mycelium spread doesn't mean nothing is happening. I'm assuming you used the pf tek method, in which case your mycelium (if its fully colonized all visible substrate) is busy allocating its sugar resources in the most efficient way while it prepares for fruiting. For future reference you really don't need to cold shock anything before you birth it but it probably didn't hurt anything. General rule of thumb for future grows is notice when the mycelium has colonized all visible substrate, then wait a week from that day and birth. That will give it the appropriate amount of time to allocate sugar to give you the best flushes possible. Good luck and happy shrooming!"

Assuming the above is true, the jars don't need foil excepts for when pressure cooking, and they don't need to be in or out of a tub or anywhere particular.  Basically you're fine for now. This stage should be characterized by a period (3-6 days) for the spores to germinate, followed by mycelium growth in the jar medium. Once growth reaches 25%+ give them all a solid shaking to distribute grains (Assuming: bulk grow, not pftech, Dont shake pf jars.)  Basically at some point your jars should be fully covered in bright white mycelium. At that point +5-10 days you should be ready for the next step."

If you made a tea and filtered it, you would greatly reduce the amount of fungal flesh in your system.   Plus, tea is just the way to go.

shrooms,3al6tf,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:04:14 2015 UTC,"PE? Now's a good time to case that sub. PE is a tricky summabitch if you don't get everything nice and dialed in.  Just a simple verm casing will do, maybe a 50/50 peat/verm. Just a thin layer. PE likes a good casing. And air. PE will reward you for getting your FAE right.  As far as when pins will show up, after you introduce the air cycle, they'll pop up after a few days. Have some patience, but it won't be that long after. PE tends to be weird on the first flush, but not always, and noticeably less so when there's a casing layer and the FAE is proper."
shrooms,3al6tf,Brooklyyyn23,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:13:51 2015 UTC,What's the function/benefit of casing layer on cubensis? Seems like most that I've read agree it doesn't affect outcomes much.
shrooms,3al6tf,rhizomorphicoreos,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:38:01 2015 UTC,"Helps retain moisture, provides a nice microclimate on the surface of the substrate (similar to using wax paper or bubble wrap), and it protects fragile primordia early in formation. It isn't necessary for cubensis, but some prefer to use it. PE is a finicky variety and a casing layer helps it do a little better. I use casing layers because I find it helps cut the abort ratio a little bit, and it also prevents puddles forming on the substrate."

I don't go the traditional route with 1/4' casing to 1' sub, I tend to just go about 1/4' total with the casing regardless of the height of the sub. You don't want fruits growing on the casing, but from underneath. I just think of it the same as I would a cake- just a little verm/peat layer covering the exposed mycelium."

This started to get creepy and was almost convinced I was going crazy. On the comedown I smoked with one of my close friends and reflected positively on the trip at the end of the day. Love hearing of others' trips & tips"
shrooms,3aklhk,sailorofthemind_,2,Sun Jun 21 05:19:34 2015 UTC,inside world and outside world... two absolutely completely things while tripping....
shrooms,3aklhk,ckinz16,3,Mon Jun 22 06:32:26 2015 UTC,"Your post brought back some memories of my 5g trip, where I was lost in infinite...nothing/fractals...there was nowhere to hide, and it was terrifying.  It seemed that behind the veil is infinity, and infinity could be just as much nothing as it is everything.  I am a believer in Christ, the Bible, God, etc.  I took 5g of shrooms, and met a woman, which I was led to believe was a face or personality of God.  What I saw as I tried to understand who or what was speaking to me, was something large, powerful, with many tounges coming off of it.  It looked exactly like a sun, with each flare being a separate personality or consciousness.  But the things she said and showed me made me afraid, because I didn't understand.  It's taken me a while to even be able to put any words to it at all.  We are all apparently one consciousness, or network, which is growing and mapping itself by the power of love.  Like a growing consciousness in a world of infinite fractals - which was terrifying for me to behold.  I felt that to look at it for too long, I would cease to be human - that perhaps my physical body would no longer exist, and I would be lost in this place forever.  Even darkness, which exists because infinity is full of infinite possibility, has a consciousness, which appeared to be an extension of the same great growing consciousness.  I became afraid at one point, because I did not know a female God - not to mention one that was so utterly powerful that I had to submit, I had to give up everything.  She claimed to be a Mother, she called me son.  Her personality was so nearly identical to that of Lady Polgara in David Eddings The Belgariad that I took note and she seemed to say that the character was inspired by her.  It seemed that God is so God, God can be literally anything, even everything.  We are all God exploring consciousness.  We are all here in a shared dream to explore ourselves.  God is so God that God can even be the God in the Bible, or Jesus.  God is so God that when I met one of God's faces, I was driven to my knees, and had to give up everything.  All of my ideas, individuality, and even the very concept of God.  God is so God, that even meeting one of its faces means you must give up on even the concept of God, or at least that's what I had to do.  I had a very difficult time with this, and knew real fear.  I seem to remember thinking to myself that this must be the ""fear of God,"" or rather, the fear of the unknown - indeed, the completely unknowable by any human means.  I wondered if I met the Devil.  But I could find no holes in what I experienced.  It even fit with what I know of the Bible.  At a later point I took 4.8 grams (having worked up to this due to being very trepidations about the infamous 5g dose experience) and met her again briefly.  This time, I had had time to think about the whole thing, so I was able to look at it differently and started to piece together what had happened during the 5g trip, and why it was so difficult for me.  I was required to give up the notions of God in my head, which is all I have.  Now I'm not sure what exists.  But then again, maybe that's the truth of it all.  That's why we're here; to explore.  I've had to do some difficult thinking since then, but it all fits from what I know.  I'm not sure exactly what to think anymore, but anyway, that's what what I remember.  It might be worth mentioning that, right before she began speaking to me, I was pondering something and asked a question.  I have smoked salvia many many times, and almost every time, I come into some form of contact with a female entity.  We call her Lady Salvia.  I recently met her again during a salvia trip, and saw her eyes, and her arms.  I won't describe the trip just now, but that's what I saw when I looked up during a trip that was almost identical to the previous.  Then I later learned that the Spanish name for Salvia is ojos de la pastora, ""eyes of the shepherdess.""  In a strange moment, I wondered why this was - because I remember seeing her eyes.  I wondered...why ""the shepherdess?""  Who is the shepherdess?  I smoked a bong rip of weed, and the effect was almost identical to taking a big rip of salvia.  But then again, right after that I also asked if the darkness has a name, which felt like a dangerous question to ask once I'd asked it.  That's when she began speaking to me."
shrooms,3aklhk,budgetless,3,Sun Jun 21 13:18:32 2015 UTC,"This post hits home. My first time (like an idiot) was with 4g - absolutely mind-blowing. HARD looping/living of alternate lives and overwhelming sensations. As you did, I had unexpectedly heavy foot traffic, and later on an embarrassing social situation.  To compound my issues, I was quite physically disabled by the dosage. I was barely able to walk, and I couldn't really speak or get full sentences out. Long story short, after being brought back home by a friend, my negative experiences were the fuel for a radical reinvention of myself as I came down. I felt like I had aged a decade and traveled the world, and wouldn't have changed that experience for anything."

shrooms,3aklhk,Ktaostrophe,2,Sun Jun 21 12:38:46 2015 UTC,"I'm 110% serious in this post. I had the same exact experience. Exactly. I took an 8th of shrooms with my best friend in a house I trusted where I knew everyone and I had shrooms before but a much lower dosage. My experience was dark. Very hard to describe and it felt like I was on a ride. I took zero control. My trip basically blacked me out. I was eating my shrooms an started feeling ""funny"" and started realizing I was starting my trip. So I was inside and I didn't like it so I said lets go outside. I went to my friends room grabbed a jacket, and remembered absolutely nothing from my outside experience. Apparently we went for a decent sized walk, an I have zero recollection of it! I do remember small glimpses in an out of me being in my friends room trying to sleep it off. I felt very oppressed almost, like I didn't want to interrupt my friends or go an bother them but, I knew I wouldn't. I just didn't make the choice for myself. I rode the trip out. I stayed in the room and everything felt real. I felt so many negative emotions and thought I had gone insane. I even thought I had killed people or I was being experimented on. I eventually acquired the courage to walk out of the room and into the living room, ate something but went back. I could hear my several friends outside playing BP, laughing talking like I was in the same room. I then, best way to describe it is blacked out, and woke up again just standing in the living room building up the courage to walk out to my friend. Once I finally did, the feeling was amazing. It made all of the bad worth it. It felt like I was reborn and reconnected to my body, like my mind was floating around an decided to hop back in my head. When I ""came back"" I didn't know who I was, where I was, or what happened. All the dark stuff that happened I thought was real. I had to ask my name where I was and what happened. My friends explained to me who I was where I was an that I took shrooms. After that I ""came back"" a lot more but still was feeling negative. My visuals in the room was insane and it carried after my ""rebirth"" so to say. It made it so worth it. I would do shrooms again just because the after feel.   Months later I did acid at grad night an had some of those dark thoughts again. My actions where much more controlled and I made my choices so it didn't last long. It was weird that I had some of the same thoughts and negative feelings. After my negative parts I have a great time and would do it again either its acid or shrooms. You described my experience perfectly! I had to tell you I had the same feeling. Sorry it's so long hahaha."

Here's my tip to you from my first experience similar to yours which could have gone the frightening way instead of blissful way.  I started getting scared as the intensity of the trip suddenly increased and reactively started whispering ""acceptance,"" asking for acceptance from the mushroom spirits.  Whether you believe in the spirits or not, it can set your mind up to be more accepting of the experience and shed some fear going in.  And here's my most difficult experience to date.  I've been exploring possibilities for several weeks now and have concluded that I was not possessed, but that I met my id, and it took the opportunity to take control.

We pitched tents on the beach with the intent to spend the night. We ate our goombas and waited for it to take effect. As its hitting everyone, we are all feeling a little uncomfortable. Some were more uncomfortable than others. My SO became very unsettled and just felt the need for her bed and pillows but we were far from home. My brother and friend just had the normal slight nausea. I had a beast stomach ache, the Kind that makes you want to poop your Guts out. Fast forward. Everyone is taking turns having 1 on 1 time with eachother, talking about old memories and the future and how we are feeling and it was completely majestic. I saw circles above their head with lines spanning out in different directions stretching to the lines in the sky going across the ocean. Where things took a turn for the worst was when my friends tent started to blow down for an intense period of wind. We were all tripping trying to take his tent down. Some were laughing while others began to panic and become very frustrated. Soon after i joined in. Being paranoid that my tent would soon fall, i tried to take it down with my brother. Frenzied, we ended up tangling the fiberglass rods with the tent itself with everything everywhere! Beers, food, clothes, blankets, belongings. It was an utter mess beyond belief. My girlfriend which at this point had 4 watery eyes, sat me down to look at what seemed like a storm had hit where we were. At this point i laid down and began to think of all the shit that would soon happen whether it involved cops arresting us, me trying to commit suicide, or my parents shaming me. I didn't know what was real anymore, or if anything ever really mattered. I laid down and felt as if i was genuinely going to die. My body went limp and i was unresponsive yet knew what was going on. It was so intense. My head started to flood with images and an infinite amount of possibilities of what would happen next. I visioned dying and being born again as a boy named Jacob. I felt every feeling possible, saw every shape, demons, angels, sex, mushrooms, suffering, happiness, peace and love. I gripped my SO the whole time because she felt the same way. We ended up Peeing ourselves together (LOL) because we were either scared as hell or just really thought it was the end. As this is all happening. My brother and friend are cleaning up with my friends GF who wasn't tripping. They ended up getting everything into the cars and my brother stood for a good 1 hour trying to get us to snap out of it. Almost instantly, the trip was over just like that. I felt as if i was born again as well. Got up as if nothing happened, put on my skeletoes, grabbed my SO's hand and walked to my car, following my brothers lead as he had a flashlight in the dark beach. Definitely a night ti remember. Was the best bad / good trip ever"

I felt completely ripped appart and couldn't remember basic aspects of my life like where i was and why i was there, the feeling was very similar to what i felt when i tried salvia, but way less intense, and i still was aware of my ego. It was like this thoughts became alive and started to disrupt my perception of my world. At the end my roomate talked with me for a while until i became more concious again. Very weird experience but it was very valuable because i got to SEE those thoughts that usually bring me down, and now i can adress them in order to improve my quality of life and get away from the destructive behaviors and thoughts that bring me down from time to time.

shrooms,3ankq8,Bout_To_Shit_Fuck_Up,0,Mon Jun 22 17:16:54 2015 UTC,It is almost impossible to positively identify any wild mushroom as anything that can or should be eaten. I would suggest eating only mushrooms that were grown by someone. Some places in the world have Liberty Caps but I still wouldn't trust it. Curbing enthusiasm for finding and trying to identify wild mushrooms with an intention to eat them should be everyone's answer.

Going 'mushroom hunting' and then asking if they are active is a bit silly.   Just my opinion. If you want to eat mushrooms, buy some edibles. If you want to trip mushrooms, don't look for them outside."
shrooms,3ankq8,mystery_disease,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:05:58 2015 UTC,"Many actives can be identified as easily as morels. Perhaps OP doesn't really know what he is doing, and that's a 'perhaps', and maybe then I can understand where you're coming from. The side of the subreddit explicitly states all the important rules that need to be known. But what you're saying altogether is that no one, not even people who know what they are doing, should go mushroom hunting and post it on here to help corroborate their findings. Correct me if I'm wrong here."

I personally don't think anyone should go pick wild mushrooms with a view to find actives and eat them. Bad things will happen is that is what should be known, in my view. I am not on this sub a ton, but I haven't seen anyone identify wild actives and eat them. Maybe it has happened but if you do some on this sub to ask, you probably don't know what you are looking for other than mushrooms. It just doesn't make sense to be constantly identifying on this sub and asking, 'active or nah', when 1/1000 times you have only found poison. If you have a real interest in identifying mushrooms then just take a picture of them, leave them where you found them, and post your question in r/mycology."

It's kind of math-rock, almost tech metal but it's so clean and absolutely beautiful, especially if you're in a ""muddy"" section of the trip.

Shrooms and LSD was enough. 400 ug lsd is kinda more intense because of all the mind fuck in the beginning and the end. And we were three this time. I recommend two. Hard to give attention to both.

shrooms,3aia1n,Didymos_Black,3,Sat Jun 20 13:18:30 2015 UTC,"The latter.  I tried to have it in two separate lines, but I'm still new to reddit and it's formatting.  8g is my max dry, though I was still under the influence of Cymbalta (SNRI) during both of those experiences, so it was somewhat lessened.  And it was 60g fresh (I found the forum post I made that day, keepin' me honest).  60g fresh was much easier to get down.  Sometimes the bitterness gets to me, but in that instance I made a mushroom marinade with a little tamari, oil, salt, pepper and lemon.  60g, and the 8g dry on the other occasion made me feel awesome.  The 8g was at work one day, after I'd decided to leave my job, didn't have anything work related to do, and had learned how to function on large doses by that point.  The 60g (as I look at what I wrote immediately after and it keeps me honest) was at home and I met my id that day.  I don't know if you've ever had involuntary patterned muscle movement, but I did.

I told an old friend I ate an entire eighth (3.5g) and he said that's generally enough for 2-3 people.  It also depends.  Do you take SSRIs or SNRIs?  Are you going to use anything else?  Do you know about fasting before a trip?

shrooms,3ajmqo,Didymos_Black,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"So, you should be hungry when you take them.  I often take them around 9 or 10am when I've been up for several hours and my stomach is really grumbling.  You can fast as long as you like, but they are actually much easier on the stomach when you're hungry.  If you have problems with blood sugar getting low, you can blend them with citris.  I recommend grapefruit, but I love grapefruit.  If you wait 15 minutes after blending to consume, the trip will start more quickly (that's referred to as Lemon Tek).  I have also ground them in a coffee grinder and mixed with peanut butter on a piece of bread.  It's okay to have a little food.  The nausea they cause usually lasts about 45 minutes for me if I don't distract myself with something, such as reading or listening to music.  Your hunger will disappear as you peak and return once the experience is coming to an end."

shrooms,3agsn2,YearGood,4,Sat Jun 20 17:21:35 2015 UTC,It was awesome. 100% would do again. It was exactly like I thought it would be from watching TV and I had such a good time. Ended up taking 3 grams in total. I thought it would be more of a fast onset with long lasting effects but it was slow onset and the longer it went the better it got. I got to a place where all the bullshit of life seem to fall away and everything just made sense.

shrooms,3aftuh,costa45,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:07:08 2015 UTC,"I approach shrooms as if they were a good friend of mine.   Sometimes we just like hang out and have a great time together. Other times though, that friend likes to take you aside and tell you a lot of things which you would rather not hear. Still, all of those things are said with love, always looking out for your best interest.   Having said that, @ 1.75 grams you will barely scratch the surface of what is possible. Just prepare your trip and try to enjoy it."
shrooms,3aftuh,YearGood,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:53:18 2015 UTC,"Having been in the same boat, and thinking perhaps mushrooms may help me get out of the mental rut that keeps there, I did some experimenting.  I agree with everything YearGood said, but I'm gonna throw my experience into the discussion.  My first trip (33 grams wet, which equates to about 2.5g dry) felt as though my thought patterns were changing, but I also had the distinct feeling that I needed to take more next time.  They will indeed open your eyes, and sometimes that can be difficult.  I do believe they work like that - like going to a cosmic shrink who is also a magic brain surgeon.  A level of passive trust must be maintained, free of demands.  It has been helping me work my way out of a rut over the last several weeks, and it has done wonders for me.  I still have a ways to go, but I feel as though they are working.  Again, this is not because they make me feel better per se, but they are like therapy sessions.  Therapy isn't always easy, but the goal is better health.  Sometimes I have a really fun, euphoric time, other times I experience levels of intensity that are difficult to handle.  Along with periodic trips (usually between 2-5 grams dry) I have also discovered benefits to microdosing (for me, this is anything less than .8 grams.)  This does not impair me, yet I feel as though it is cleansing/purging the tension out of my body, allowing me to heal.  I've done that a few times now, and I recommend everyone give it a try."

shrooms,3afdfg,Gimli_Related69,2,Fri Jun 19 18:00:23 2015 UTC,"Get a field guide.  They are based on a bifurcated key structure, it's a series of ""this or that"" questions used to determine an ID on a mushroom.  Things like spore print color and apperance, gills structure (or pores), habitat and substrate, are all important things to consider in getting to an ID.  Learn to use it.  Mycology clubs, groups, would be a great idea.  Once you get the gist of how the guide is used you can look up species of interest and learn what you need to look for in those kind.  The first things you should get to know is how to recognise a member of the genus Amanita since some of the deadliest mushrooms are that kind.  Then there's the informal group, LBM's, little brown mushrooms, tricky and rewarding, and there are deadlies too.  Know about Galerina.  There are bold mushroom pickers, there are old mushroom pickers, there are no old bold mushroom pickers."

shrooms,3af0h8,julianXbryan,2,Fri Jun 19 16:22:01 2015 UTC,"1.5 is kind of a small dose. You will only get a tiny taste of what the real experience is supposed to be like; and at best you may not get a bad trip but you're going to want to do them again, which costs money, not to mention the anticipation and excitement you'll have to endure waiting for ""the day"".   I would recommend 2.5 (or if you have 3, just take em all at that point). That was my first dose and it was fun, mindfucked me to an extent but the visuals were lacking. Overall enjoyable but I was extremely disappointed and was often wishing it was more intense. My second time tripping I took 3.5 and it was the perfect amount, the whole ordeal was infinitely better than my 2.5g experience. I've never done acid so this is coming from someone who has little experience with psychedelics. I'm going to be tripping for the 3rd time next week and I'm going to be taking 4.5g.  The trip lasted the same for me when doing 2.5 and 3.5. Onset was about 30 mins, peaking at around the 1:00 mark. I was about 90% normal by hour 7. Still felt extremely weird the rest of the day and pupils were dilated until the next morning.  Ive smoked on the come up and it seems to ease me in to the trip a little bit. I've never smoked weed when tripping because I was so immersed in the experience it didn't even occur to me to pull out my piece and smoke. some people say it clouds the trips, others say it makes the trip go south, others say it enhances the trip greatly... It's subjective, so just play it by ear."
shrooms,3af0h8,akame_21,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"Shrooms are different than acid.  Usually most people have this mentality that ""Drugs = Party"" and that is absolutely not the case with Mushrooms. They are a completely different beast altogether. You will understand once you take them.  Tolerance builds up extremely quickly and re-dosing is usually just a waste of product. Your trip will get longer but won´t get you necessarily higher.   Since you mentioned you already have some experience with lucy, @1.5 grams you will probably just be annoyed by the whole thing and it might put you off entirely.   As far as the weed is concerned, I don´t really like doing it while shrooming because you loose your edge. The shroom trip is so clean, your brain is firing with all cylinders, you become so aware that I do not want anything messing with that feeling. But if you want to do it, I recommend doing them on the comedown. After you have peaked and are ready for a bowl.   My thoughts for you: I would rather prepare for a 3 gram trip, at home and enjoy that trip fully than at a festival. But, if you have set you mind on doing them at the festival, I would try to find a place where you can be away from the crowd, where you can be left alone with your thoughts. The last thing you want to be dealing with is drunken people or people that wanna pester you while tripping.  For example, at a festival the music might become too loud and there is nothing you can do about that, that alone might ruin the trip for you."

You should've done that the moment you started to feel anxious in the first place.   Whenever I start to freak out, I calmly and rationally talk to myself. No, I am not crazy, just tripping. No, nobody is watching, nobody knows, the cops are not coming for me. No, I won't trip forever, this too shall pass.   It was only your 4th trip (was it your first time alone?), so this will become easier with more experience. You should absolutely try shrooms again, just make sure you are properly prepared. That makes the rationalising easier.   e.g. I tell people that I'm having a romantic weekend with my husband and we absolutely do not want to be disturbed. That way I don't worry about unexpected visitors or phone calls, and in the unlikely event of someone knocking at the door, I just ignore it because I know it isn't someone I know.  Always have happy music and creature comforts on hand. If you are really worried, have a trip sitter, i.e. someone you trust and who is sober, to be with you next time you trip."

Understand that a 5-6 gram trip will be completely different than a 3 gram trip. It´s not as simple as ""if I double the dose I will feel double what a 3 gram dose feels like"". At 6 grams, you might feel it 10 times harder than 3 grams.   Since you are doing it with a friend, I actually recommend you doing only 4 grams and see how you will fare. But if you think you should push the envelope further, I say go for it."

That said, it is in the nature of the beast that 3 grams of cubes are not ever likely to do the very same thing every time you do it.  I once lived in a place where all the shrooms you could want were fifteen minutes and a barbed wire fence away, free and legal.  Did a lot.  Tolerance?  Not like I ever noticed.    Tolerance is an issue, ""they just don't seem to work anymore"" for people that I think are most likely doing it all wrong.  Consult the Oracle from time to time, don't nag her. She'll get tired of your shit.  What you did three days ago has nothing at all to do with what is going to happen should you choose to do three grams again today.  Any amount of tolerance you may have developed (which is likely zilch, zip, nada) would have an effect so small as to be totally lost in the inherant variability of the shroom experience.  Doubling the dose in an effort to compensate for tolerance at this point would not be a real good idea, seriously."

The genus was initially described by mycologist Rolf Singer in 1958 to accommodate the single species Secotium novae-zelandiae reported by Gordon Herriott Cunningham in 1924.  It has been suggested that the genus may represent an intermediary evolutionary stage between an hypogeous (underground) ancestor and the related epigeous (above ground) genus Stropharia.

The double helix was discovered in 1953 when LSD was hardly yet known. Kesey, one of the big figures in LSD culture, didn't even get his hands on the drug until 1959 when he took part in CIA experiments at standford.

Cut out a piece and transfer it to whatever you like. It will colonize any kind of grains, it's not exactly picky there. After it's fully colonized it will form tiny white knots on the surface which will turn into mushrooms. Boom, done.

My brothers friend sent this this flick to him and from speaking to the friend, I have gathered he doesn't really know what he is doing and has never heard of getting a batch ID'd. For his safety, i'm hoping these are subs but I don't really know what i'm doing either. All I know is that he picked these in Melbourne, Australia in a typical SE burbs park along a walking trail.

I think festivals at lower doses are fun and save the higher doses for soul searching. you don't want to get tent locked or zonked and ""miss the festival"". Unless you are going to the festival just to have a safe place to blast off. That's fine too but I'm personally a fan of putting the festival first and finding things to make the festival more fun. I think you should just plan one trip for the weekend. You'll thank you self a couple weeks from now you realize you have some left. That's why people usually each a cap or two at festivals so they don't blast off. Last time I took 2.5g I got couch locked for almost 8 hours.

That way if you start feeling anxious you can just listen to the music. Have comfortable things on hand, e.g. some water and fruit, some blankets, easy access to a toilet, etc... Bonus if you can trip outside on a beautiful day. Make sure you will not have to interact with any non-trippers and turn off your phone.   If you start feeling anxious or stuck, change something. Get up and go outside, change the music, etc... A little change can make a big difference. Also, if you are tripping with others, talk to them, lift each other up. If things do start going a bit sideways, don't resist. Ride the wave. Even the dark and ugly things can teach us and are a part of us. Don't deny them, own them, embrace them and bring them into the light.   But ja, don't worry about it too much, just enjoy yourself. Shrooms are very forgiving and loving."

So, start low, relax, be sure to trip in an environment that allows you to be alone if you need it but also to be able to get back closer to your friends and girlfriend if you are feeling overwhelmed.

Take them by your self with no one around so you can use them as a tool instead of just getting giggly with your friends. Def don't trip around someone who isn't tripping. There is no way to explain what mushrooms feel like really, or even tripping in general. The mushrooms will guide you. There are no bad trips, just ups and downs along the way like life it's self.

shrooms,3a1x8q,Muurvin,2,Wed Jun 17 12:17:07 2015 UTC,"My liquid cultures are both honey based. If anything, you could always sterilize a jar of honey and water then inject some into the karo mix. It might help and it'd be worth it to not waste spores you already put in the jar."

shrooms,3a1x8q,Muurvin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:31:05 2015 UTC,I prefer honey but harder to tell when contaminated so I switched to Karo instead. What's your honey process like? I should switch to organic honey though.
shrooms,3a1x8q,Muurvin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:40:41 2015 UTC,Same as karo.  Add about a half teaspoon honey to a pint jar of water.  PC on 15psi for 20 mins. Measurements don't have to be exact though.  I use any old used salsa and pickle jars and throw just a bit of honey in.  If you're unsure of amount it's best to err towards less honey.  It only takes a little bit.  After it's more less f I lot colonized you can store in the fridge and it'll be good for months.

Also, randomly unrelated side question: I'm using an all american PC and the rack that it comes with has my jars sitting in the water when the PC is filled with 2 or so inches.

shrooms,3a27wm,happiefish,2,Tue Jun 16 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"The jars should sit in the water, about 1/3 to 1/2 in the water, so it sounds fine. What you don't want is for the jars to sit directly on the bottom of the PC, so a rack is perfect.   Also, you should put foil over the top of the jars so that no water can get in and alter the water content inside the jars. Just be careful not to make the foil too long, (it should just cover the lid and the top 2 cm of the jar), otherwise water will seep up inside the foil.

Looks like 2 grams, maybe less.  2 grams makes me trip, but not so hard I can't hike, or even drive if I totally had to (but I prefer not to, just saying.)  At that dosage, visuals are extremely mild IMO.  On an eighth, a bike ride becomes magical, yet challenging.  at 4 grams, I'm talking to elves in my head.  At 5, God shows up and scares the hell outa me.  Haven't done more than 5, way too trepidatious.  Compared to LSD, shrooms are NOT weak.  Don't even let yourself think that.  It's all about the dosage.  If you take enough, you'll get launched to salvia/fractal land, and sunshine will pour in the windows as rainbows and kaleidoscopic patterns.  If you are used to LSD, try doing more.  If you want strong visuals and all that jazz, try doing at least 4, if not 5.  EDIT:  I've tripped like 3 and 4 days in a row, and tripped mad bawls.  I take mushrooms as a spiritual awakening/perspective/healing, but I'm telling you...tolerance is a thing, and you may have better luck if you wait a week, but then again, it doesn't make any noticeable difference to me."
shrooms,3a1gxt,budgetless,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:36:24 2015 UTC,"I would wait a week and then try 4-5gs. More like 5 if you're looking for visuals. Mushrooms are more ""consciousness expanding"" than LSD. I always found acid harsh compared to shrooms."
shrooms,3a1gxt,domo_origato,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"Its also possible that the shrooms you got werent very potent. If you have potent shrooms an eighth should be plenty for you to get more of an experience than you described. But if the grower used spores to grow them instead of a tested isolated strain of mycelium, then it can be a crap shoot as to how potent they will be. Also, factors such as heat, light, humidity, and age can cause the active compounds inside to degrade and lose potency."
shrooms,3a1gxt,chasingreno,-4,Wed Jun 17 00:10:36 2015 UTC,"Well, your tolerance is going to be up now, so it will take even more to get you to where you were last night, I would recommend chilling out on the psychedelics for at least a month if you want to enjoy your shrooms, but acid is from what I understand kind of a level up from shrooms. Shrooms are more about the body high and the way it makes you experience things rather than awesome visuals, not that you cant have them, but it takes more to get there and a recent acid trip can take away from the experience the same way that sex on ecstasy can lessen normal sex for a bit. There will probably be someone who more knowledgeable than me that can break it down better"
shrooms,3a1gxt,Dracron,3,Tue Jun 16 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"Mushrooms and LSD affect the same receptors in the brain, namely 5-HT (serotonin) receptors. The mechanism of action is similar and therefore the effects are similar.  The reason why LSD so readily produces visual effects is that it's much more potent (relative to weight) than psilocybin. That doesn't mean shrooms produce more of a ""body high"" compared to LSD. Take enough of them and believe me, they'll melt your brain as much as acid. Conversely, take a small enough dose of acid and all you will get is also just a body high."

A 40mm fan coming on based on a timer coupled with an ultrasonic humidifier doing the same should ideally replace the need to mist and fan.

I think the best would be to probably put them on a pizza (after the pizza comes out of the oven)  But why do you want to cook with shrooms? Taking them on an EMPTY stomach is definitely the best and will produce the most potent results. If it's the taste that bothers you, you can use tea, honey or lemon tek etc to cover the taste."
shrooms,39zjbf,happiefish,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:24:16 2015 UTC,I've heard like the exact opposite though. I heard that since they are really hard to digest (that queezy stomach feeling) that cooking them releases the enzymes in the shrooms easier and has no effect on the trip but makes you trip faster due to digesting the shrooms faster
shrooms,39zjbf,happiefish,2,Tue Jun 16 12:33:26 2015 UTC,"um, no. If you eat them whole, it will take longer to kick in than if you grind them up. If you eat them with other food, it will take longer for everything in your stomach to digest, therefore longer to kick in. My preferred method is to grind up the shrooms to a powder, usually with a shotglass and scissors like I would for weed, and then to down handfuls of the powder with orange juice. I start coming on within 20-30 minutes every time.  If you don't want to take my word for it, just try your own experiments. Try one trip where you cook the shrooms, and one where you grind them, and see what works best."

shrooms,39x63e,Junokali,2,Mon Jun 15 15:05:00 2015 UTC,"What you describe is the existential anxiety of modern life. Tripping is a process that requires you to learn and explore. Your depression is part chemical, part emotional, part psych-spiritual. To gain the effect you are looking for, a time of sobriety followed by a 5-gram trip is in order.   The dose isn't the most important factor. Rather what's key is how you structure your life/environment in order to derive the greatest healing effect. Plan a healing trip for several weeks. Walk in with intention and the openness to handle a higher dosage, which I think you can.   My suggestion:   On trip day,  Sleep well. Be rested.  Eat a light meal of healthy food.  Clean your abode and clear your schedule.  WRITE and get out onto paper all your anxious thoughts, as well as questions for seeking clarity. Get it out of your brain so the ego can let go of it and explore beyond.   Dose. You can take all of the shrooms (5grams) or take two, come up, and dose another 3 grams. Terence McKenna recommends 5 grams dried for healing and I agree from my own experience. Sometimes opening the door wide is what we need to see clearly Beyond.   Then, relax. Breathe.   The come up is when the most healing happens. It can be scary. You'll feel as though your mind is being invaded by a super consciousness. That your brain is being taken apart by something that is You, but not You. This is the ""spirit"" of the molecule. Its conscious vibration. It will take about an hour to go from sober to truly tripping. During that time you are entering into the mental domain of the psilocybin molecule.   In that time of transition, relax and focus on being mindful of all the little changes. Breathing is so important. You will not be harmed by the experience, no matter how much you take.   When you begin to feel uncomfortable, turn on soft lighting, relaxing and harmonious music, and lie back. Close your eyes, or focus on something such as a candle or smoke from incense.   Welcome the experience. Mediate. Give yourself to it. BE A WILLING PARTICIPANT. Eyes open. Present. Scientific. Unafraid. State your intentions. Reach out for help from your greater self.   Allow the molecule to search your mind. ""Get to know you""   Attune your mind to the vibration that the chemical is brining to you. Relax and embrace it. Allow the music to guide and harmonize your mind.   Let go of the outside world, outside worries. All burdens you carry for others.   Repeat to yourself ""I am taking this time for myself. To know more. To become better. To be nourished and grow with universal energy.""   Then, when you are feeling less lethargic, more comfortable and energetic, draw.   Have paper and pen ready and just draw.   Anything you like. Allow the movement of artistic expression and the joy of music to harmonize your life with the universe.  You might have to deal with difficult things. Thoughts, memories, regrets. That's ok. Don't be afraid of yourself. Knowing your whole self is important. What's more important is to seek beyond the difficult things, to find the truths buried deeper. The truth behind pain and fear.   One must face death and fear to truly understand courage and life.   You might also find, paradoxically, that all your anxieties are pretty foolish and temporary. That your sufferings are all contingent on things you ultimately control, and that much hope exists. Many solutions can be found by working together with many psychedelic molecules in this way, where seemingly none existed before.   The mushrooms are natural, a symbiotic being, a friend. A healing spirit here to help you. It is not malicious. Keep yourself in good circumstances and in control, you will have a good trip.   You are strong. You deserve to be happy. You are capable of love and healing. You are a shining Buddha of light. You will create value with your life for the sake of those you love and the future of your species.   You are not your bank account number. You are not your degree, CV, or resume. You are a human. Capable of doing great magic and works of goodness.   These are the messages that have been given to me. I've been shown my flaws. Forced to throw up and purge suffering (stomach upset is not unusual and some people can throw up. If it happens, embrace it as a physical purge of negativity. The voice of the molecule will guide you.) But the mushroom has always been compassionate to me and kind to my sincere seeking spirit. Every single trip has ended well. No regrets.   The best advice I can give you is to trust yourself and the molecule. Work together in harmony to induce healing, learning, and joy.   Trust, my friend, that behind the veil of your own mind dwells powerful beings and great vistas of inner realms.   Bask on the shores of your inner ocean. Captain the ship of your mind.   Enjoy this experience. It's rare. Powerful. Sacred. It has meaning and purpose to you and it hasn't even happened yet. You are planning and asking questions. You are doing it right. You are correctly using the molecule.   Therefore, trust that though your preparation you can create for yourself a healing and enlightening experience.   Tripping is like being able to sit down with an ancient, powerful deity for a few hours. Ask whatever you like. You might be surprised at the wisdom and power of that inner voice.  So alien.   And yet, familiar.   So familiar.   Like dreaming.   Like dying.   Like being with a lover.   Tripping is special and primal. It is your birthright as a human being. Something enjoyed by humans on this word for tens of thousands of years.   A birthright denied you by a fascist system of panoptic social control. Fuck them.   Have a bad trip and ""they"" win.   Have an enlightening trip and you win.   I want you to win.   So win.   Best to you, come back safe and share the experience of your vision quest with the Reddit tribe.    EBS"

If you can't do this you could either wait until you can birth them... Which might be too late, as the Mushrooms could start to rot after a while and be a threat because of contamination, or you could pick the mushrooms and place your cake back in the jars, but this wouldn't be optimal either, as you might get a lot of contamination on the cake, upon picking the shrooms, that will spread fast, when you have no FAE and high humidity, which usually is the case for the substrate in the jars... Additionally you will get bruisings on the cake and what so not...  I guess I would try to wait until you can fruit them and hope the mushrooms dont start to rot... But that's also just a guess... Maybe someone else more experienced knows the right way to handle that.  PS: Light in general does not necessarily start growth but it can increase the chance of it, but usually when shrooms already started growing, darkness won't stop them from growing..."

shrooms,39uq23,Gman_16,3,Mon Jun 15 00:30:21 2015 UTC,"Just go with it man. In my experience, anxiety comes from resistance of some kind. You had a bad experience in the past, at a time when your mind wasn't all ""there."" Now as the effects of the psychedelic are coming on again it is triggering your memory of the bad trip and in turn creating fear that the current trip will be bad as well. Break the cycle. How? Just go with it. Stop trying to not feel anxious. If you're feeling anxious just feel it and accept it. Surprisingly this with reduce it. This exact concept is how I stopped having panic attacks, even before ever trying psychedelics. When I would feel one coming on I would get anxious and ""try really hard not to have a panic attack."" This resistance actually triggered the attack. Eventually I would feel it coming and just think ""Yeah, I might have a panic attack. That's ok."" And then I wouldn't. Idk, give it a go I guess."

I haven't felt any anxiety from a trip in awhile. When I first started I would plan it out at least a week or two in advance and I usually got anxious just untill the trip kicked in and it was gone. Maybe try meditating before and during trip.

MC is a not very pleasant place when you're sober. It must be disgusting as fuck if you are high on shrooms. Second: Interacting with strangers. It's in my opinion just a big NO. I ALWAYS start to freak out, when I have to behave ""normal"" while being high, because it's one of these situations where you have to fight the trip. That's bad!  For the future, get a playlist, that gives you good vibes. Not just something that sounds good, I'm talking about music that you can listen to, when you had the worst day in your life and after listening to it you will feel atleast good.  And for the last thing. If you start tripping with a bunch of friends, try to stay together, until ALL of you are sober again. Else you might start worrying about your friends on the one hand, and on the other hand it just fucks up the whole situation you had before. When being split suddenly someone you could interact with is gone, and then it's just normal to ask yourself what to do now (esp. if you are on shrooms lol)...  When I am on shrooms I beforehand usually try to create an environment where I won't be exposed to strangers when I don't want to, where I have enough food and drinking, especially fruits and juice + water is great, all in all just a very safe place. If possible some kind of music device aswell. And very important no cellphones or too distracting things, etc. An unwanted call can fuck you up pretty hard, if you are tripping ballz!  Try to plan ahead a bit the next time and good luck, my friend :)"

shrooms,39tsud,redtrx,-1,Tue Jun 16 03:28:07 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly indicative of a reckless apathy towards your body. I'm convinced that my displeasure from processed foods while tripping partially stems from an intrinsic knowledge that it is terrible for me.  Also yeah, as to what you did wrong: SET andmuthafuckin SETTING  Was your mindset right? Were you prepared to meet the needs you might have on the trip?   You could have steered your mindset to a better place once you got out of the situation causing anxiety, but you weren't prepared for it. Learn some deep breathing, and learn to allow those negative feelings to wash over. Truly a skill which will help you in life.  As for SETTING...Who were you with? Where were you at? Were your friends informed you would be tripping and how to interact with you? Nope. McD's awful idea, I'd have gotten a fountain drink to stare at the bubbles and sat there patiently giggling to myself, but you allowed the environment to consume you. You have to be careful in public, especially if you care that people know. I've found that I'm generally much more normal than I perceive myself to be in that state and I can interact with strangers in a casual capacity, though I prefer not to.  These are things you should give thought to if you plan to continue using this substance. I hope this drug teaches you responsibility before it teaches you fear."

shrooms,39sr31,Auraxicus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:34:41 2015 UTC,"White balance is important. Do you see the changes in color of the counter or whatever they're resting on? That variation indicates that the colors aren't balanced and could be shifted. It's good to use white light and as uniform as possible for reliable results.   With multiple pictures if even one different feature is present or more prominent, or if the white balance is different in any, that could be helpful for comparison.  Even if you think they're worse, more bad pictures is better than fewer and I don't think this one was far off."

As difficult as is to ID a shroom over the internet I'm concerned that's not actually a GT. The white of the stem doesn't look right. Its too dull. The cap isn't the right color at all. it should be pure/mostly gold, not fade to white towards the edge so quickly. Also no blue bruising on the stem at all. Cubes are fragile and psilocybin oxidizes easily so just merely picking it should create some bruising.  Then again maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about, but it just doesn't look quite right. Possible look-a-like? Are you brushed up on the imitations in your area?  I wouldn't eat that without doing a spore print. But I like my liver."

The two are strikingly similar, but the Subbs/Cincs are gonna be the guys to make you trip as opposed to the foes. There have been times where I have thought I'm picking the psychedelic ones, and it turned out to be a Pan foe. I ate them, nothing happened... The best way to tell is to spore print that guys ASAP. Take the cap, throw it on blank white paper with a cup over top of it to protect it, let it sit for a whole day.

shrooms,39mgwp,AngelBurger,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:38:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think the grain jars need to consolidate, the substrate is a matter of debate though."
shrooms,39mgwp,ShroomyGuy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:23:40 2015 UTC,When it's just reached 100% colonization it needs a week of consolidation. This will allow the mycelium to gorge on all the available nutrients (mainly on the inside that isn't visible) and help your cakes start pinning and fruiting a lot faster once birthed.

shrooms,39o888,frangtanstic,-2,Sat Jun 13 19:02:06 2015 UTC,"Amanitas aren't very similar in general. Even the some of the closest relatives to A. Muscaria don't look similar enough to be mixed up to those who know what they're looking for. I'm simply throwing caution to the wind, which is something one should do when ID'ing mushrooms for an internet stranger.   For example, this mushroom can look similar to A. Muscaria, and it grows in some of the same places, but it isn't related at all. I'm not saying that OP found a bad mushroom, I'm simply stating that while his caps look ok, I wouldn't encourage him to eat them unless I could identify them with 100% certainty in my eyes, but I'm not shouting ""DON'T EAT THEM"", because they seem ok to me.   All in all, with the pictures provided, we can't ID something with 100% certainty unless we're actually physically examining it, and this goes for most mushrooms in general."

shrooms,39o888,frangtanstic,2,Sat Jun 13 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks frangtanstic - for putting it straight and clear.  In recent days, the character you've just experienced has been actively trolling forums, mainly 'get high' ones - acting himself the world's foremost voice of expertise about Amanita muscaria.   There seems a Modus Operandi, running on clear intent - to try and get people at random, anyone will do - to eat fly agaric.    Confronted with the documented facts about recent poisonings by this species - including fatalities - the character you're just told what's what, uses the same type speculative obfuscate 'on his authority' - to deny the mushroom involved was even fly agaric.  Talking about how great it is to get stoned on - 'effective' - goes with fallaciously defending its 'safety.' The Fly Agaric Medicine Show has a big grievance over 'slander' of its 'holy mushroom' - by anyone calling it poison) by so many people.  Just wanted say thanks for telling it like it is.  The party you've addressed, as I've seen lately, is actively using this reddit site for his fly agaric crusade.  With his identity safely hidden, he's been actively (desperately?) trying to get others at random to get interested in eating it - not friends or family (in whom one might reasonably assert a legitimate personal interest); strangers who 'qualify' - i.e. don't know any better.    He's even posted informercials offering his own concocted 'trip reports' pretending in glorious technicolor description of the wondrous and spiritual properties, the amazing grace etc.    Besides riding John Allegro's cockamamie 'theorizing' as a warrant of fly agaric's virtues - he had the audacity to advertise the late Donald Teeter's 'grail' and 'elixir' bullshit, as further testimony in evidence to ... all the reasons we all need to, ought to, eat fly agaric.  I did about like you - per his fraudulent advertising. Not just for this wonder mushroom falsely maligned, victimized as 'poisonous' by terrible people saying that. Also - on behalf of his free expert consultation and advice, worth every penny charged no doubt.  He didn't like it, and created a new account name, AmaNitaLia - to rehash and reboot his traveling Snake Oil Medicine Agaric show. SOMA is a new pet acronym I get for this species, in 'honor' of its use to bait and entice whoever, to 'try it.'    Its quite a creep show.  Considering 'drug culture' sites set on mycology and interest in mushrooms at this thread - I don't think he has any business here, even if his motive is clear enough (from my experience, and realization). Here he is striking up his travelling band, with his 'helpful expert' FYI campaign, as he has done over and over, soliciting (just two examples of his myco charlatanism):  http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/32v79h/op_delivers_amanita_muscaria_trip_report/  http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/38xqu9/i_just_took_3_amanita_muscaria_caps_ama/"

The one with a big cap was near the center of them, and has the same kind of stem/ innards as the others so im assuming by this its the same mushroom. I took some last night, no caps just stems, and got a nice little body high the whole night (i know taking them before knowing is dumb but hey whatre you gonna do) I heard that taking just stems gives a body high rather than a more psychedelic visual trip. EDIT also the stems have a sort of hard to cut core, almost like wood but more spongey(?) They smell (and taste, bleh) like shrooms taste and smell. If you look closely you can see some blue oxidation on the large cap and some of the smaller ones. Theyre dry now but im guessing the blue is still there cause they were frozen over night. I felt no sickness from eating them (other than a little shitty in the morning but thats most likely cause i was awake all night. One thing to note (anothe reason why i thought telling you guys i had only stems was so important) is that last night i took at least as much if not more of those in fresh shrooms (just ball parking it) and as i said i felt a body high synonymous to shrooms ive taken before but little of that delightful delirium i associate with shrooms. light visuals, but that mightve been my own creation, im not sure.

If you're taking shrooms several times a week it's a waste of shrooms, not to mention it's bad for you. Eating shrooms is essentially food poisoning yourself."
shrooms,39ljff,CornbreadAndBeans,5,Fri Jun 12 23:28:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry friend, but you have literally no idea what you are talking about. I spend a lot of time researching these, and there are definitely noticeable positive effects at small doses. Also psilocybin is not ""poison"" anymore than Lysergic acid diethylamide is."
shrooms,39ljff,7456312589123698741,3,Sat Jun 13 00:40:27 2015 UTC,This is all wrong on so many levels. LSD tolerance ramps up just as quickly as psilocybin. Psilocybin is no more toxic than any other tryptamine and it can definitely be micro dosed with beneficial effects.

If he is worried he might have schizophrenia, I wouldn't take them. I would go to a doctor first, if there is a test to see if you have it I would take it. But yes, people with schizophrenia should not take them."
shrooms,39kvt7,purplelephant,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:48:43 2015 UTC,"can this possible predisposition trigger him to schizophrenia as well?   There is no studies or evidence that shows people with family history of schizophrenia will be predisposed to it as well because they ate psilocybin mushrooms.  Now, with that being said, If your friend already had schizophrenia, then the answer would be no. But if he doesn't, then there is no reason to be worried. Maybe a small dosage his first time, then work his way up when he is comfortable."

He stayed to watch over me, at least for a while, to make sure that i would be fine. but during the trip he was really bringing it down. Not anything he did, just the fact that he was there was bringing me down. As i looked at him his face stared to look different. Different eyes, mouth, nose. It was weird but not scary. It was the evil grin that i saw on his face that was throwing me off. I asked him to leave and he did. Rest of the trip was awesome. i called him later to talk to him about it and i told him what i saw. He said other people have said the same thing when he is with them. This guy slowly just turned into a rather unpleasant human being after my trip. Maybe it was things i just didnt notice before or maybe its just because that is who this guy is.

The second trip i had with shrooms I was much more prepared and did 4g straight up on a 6 hour empty stomach. I was blown away and amazed got awesome visuals and everything was amazing, also no weed. I highly recommend you try 4g next time on an empty stomach but skip the lemon tek as it might come up too hard at 4gs for you. 4gs definitely seems like the experience you are looking for, it was everything that I wanted. Good luck!"

Also if you haven't looked into Tea already I would suggest it.  I Personally won't do shrooms another way. It helps the taste and performs the same function(basically) as a Lemonshot:)

shrooms,39ixb4,RawFiber,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"Commonly grow on cow shit and horse dung. Its gross, but you can clean them. Look for a pasture with cows and check. When you're finding shrooms, look at a guide to try to identify it. There's sites online that can tell you where some grow in your region like Shroomery.com. you wanna also make something called a spore print to identify them. A mushrooms spore color and pattern can vary depending on the species, and sites online can show the differences for which are psychoactive or not, etc. Best of luck"

If you don't like it, well, when you have more mushrooms you know you want to mask the taste.

shrooms,39arkf,klj2lk3j4lkj4,2,Wed Jun 10 23:59:06 2015 UTC,"once the cakes are out of the jars, remove the pins and rinse them off under the tap of your kitchen sink.   then, submerge them in a container full of water and wait 24 hours. leave the container out on the counter (dont put it in the fridge), and also make sure your cakes are 100% submerged in the water (use something to hold them down since cakes are buoyant). if part of the cake is sitting out of the water, it can lead to contams growing. i just use a big pot full of tap water with a dinner plate on top of the cakes inside to hold them down.   once 24 hours has passed, take the cakes out of the water and rinse them off again. then, roll them in dry vermiculite so that all sides are covered with a solid layer of verm.   finally, place the cleaned+dunked+rolled cakes in your shotgun fruiting chamber and let the fruiting commence :) if you did everything right, you should see pins in about 4 days, then itll be another 5-7 days before theyre fully mature and ready to pluck. dont forget your fanning/misting, but dont overdo it. especially once the pins start to grow....if youve built your SGFC to spec, once the pins are growing you can basically quit misting and just fan once a day and you'll get a proper harvest. good luck!"

shrooms,39arkf,Narcotic7,3,Thu Jun 11 03:02:10 2015 UTC,"Looks like those little guys started growing in vitro in their original jar. They're a bit bruised, but totally fine.  If you're not sure, take a Q-tip and run it gently over the blue/dark blue/supposedly green areas. If it rubs off onto the Q-tip it's probably mold/contamination. If not, it's just bruising and they're fine and will recover.  They look fine/healthy to me and I mainly grow in vitro for the convenience.  You can pick what you've got there already or let them grow a bit more if you like. If you're using a larger fruiting chamber you can stick them in there and see if they grow more for the first flush. If you pick what you've got so far be sure to dunk the cake, though.  You didn't mess anything up from what I can see."
shrooms,39arkf,sativan,2,Wed Jun 10 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"Just as  klj2lk3j4lkj4 already said. Don't worry, pick the shrooms, go to dunk and roll and keep it up.

shrooms,39e3b5,pengleberry,2,Thu Jun 11 03:15:27 2015 UTC,"Larger chunks will take longer to metabolize, so delayed onset and overall decrease in effect is expected. No way to know. Maybe shitty shrooms, maybe not the weight believed, maybe not chewing it up is really hampering the effects. Have you ever thought of making tea? With DMT being the exception, there is very little cross tolerance between hallucinogens."

Strain. Repeat with new water. Strain. Combine water extracts. Add flavor if wanted. The hot water won't denature the psilocybin."
shrooms,39e3b5,YearGood,2,Thu Jun 11 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, let me try to answer to the best of my experience.     Does swallowing pieces whole affect the trip in any way besides delayed onset? Purely because I struggle to handle the taste and it's alot eaasier for me to swallow down with water.    There's a bit more than delayed onset. On the first couple of trips, when you eat a batch of shrooms, it's not uncommon for people to experience some nausea. This nausea is usually caused by the sudden influx of dried mushrooms in ones gut, which are now expanding because they are being hydrated. But, also, the nausea can be caused by the first onset of the binding of Psylocin to your serotinic receptors in your brain. It's the dreaded come up some people always talk about. The nausea caused by these, can sometimes ruin someone's trip.   My advice:  Prepare physically for a trip.  Fast for at least 6 hours before ingestion.  Try to fast for longer if you can.   As for method of ingestion, yours is fine.   I like to grind mine through a coffee grinder and mix them with water. I like to use pure water because I do not want anything messing with my mind or my gut while I am about to trip.     Have tripped several times and haven't been able to get great visuals.    Mushrooms don't provide visuals most people usually expect. Trails, patterns everywhere, walls breathing that type of stuff. Mushrooms offer different type of visions, visions into your future, into your past and into yourself. Try to enjoy the trip as a whole, as those 4-5 hours where you are out there by yourself, with your thoughts. Every time I trip, I get great visuals.   Having said that, try these things:   Do them in a dark room and have a single dim source of light with music on. Close your eyes and the world should explode in colors. Clouds and trees offer great pattern recognition. Clouds are beautiful. Tiled floors if you stare at them, sometime will start moving. But if you blink it's back to square one.     However, I've heard some people say large doses bring on visuals as intense as a DMT trip so i was wondering why i haven't been getting great visuals even though I've been having decent doses (3g+ dried).   Never done DMT.  From experience though, I can say that mushrooms in large doses, things get really complicated. You go beyond the realm of visions or no visions.     Is the cross-tolerance between LSD and psilocybin significant? I'm guessing if you tripped on shrooms then had LSD 3 days later it would have a lower impact on LSD tolerance than if you tripped on LSD then tripped on LSD 3 days later but haven't been able to find great information on this.    You can abuse your brain all you want. Tolerance or no tolerance. The difference is that if you want to improve the quality of your mushroom trips, you will also have to have a clean body where the magic is allowed to happen. You want a clean canvas for your trips. Most psychedelics work on the serotonin system so there will be some tolerance one way or the other. You just have to decide if that is the experience you want."

The trip will kick in quickly, but it's comfortable, LSD has a rolling feeling similar to MDMA, Mushrooms have more of a classical high. You get a serious case of the giggles on the come-up and then you experience some heavy visuals, the trip should last a few hours (3-5 roughly).  If you're a smoker I recommend having a pack handy, it's always nice to have something comfortable to go to if you start to feel uncomfortable for whatever reason.  Don't listen to people that tell you it's a dark emotional experience, shrooms are wonderful and you shouldn't go into it with the expectation of having some unfathomable introspection.  If you want something and don't know what it is, you want water.   If you're going outside, bring sunscreen and please don't get lost.  For consumption, I recommend grinding them up and eating them with your favorite ice-cream."

You may have a revelation and your fear and anxiety about your sexuality be blown away. Maybe you'll learn to accept that not everyone will agree with your choices but I doesn't matter because the universe loves you for you and will forever. Where ever your journey takes you in your mind, I hope that you take away nothing but love from your experience. Happy tripping, friend."

shrooms,39ah2h,klj2lk3j4lkj4,2,Wed Jun 10 15:07:10 2015 UTC,Thank you for the response! This is one of the reasons I want to take mushrooms. I want to figure out me I just don't want to be vocal about it.
shrooms,39ah2h,klj2lk3j4lkj4,2,Wed Jun 10 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"hard to say op, also depends on the size of your dose, who youre with, what topics come up, etc.  i have full control over my speech while on shrooms, but due to the nature of the barriers that shrooms break down while tripping, ill often say things i wouldnt normally say in a social setting. not like...random blurt outs, but topics that i might normally avoid seem so easily approachable on shrooms.   either way, i wouldnt trip with anyone youre not 100% comfortable with. if these people would judge you for being bisexual, you shouldnt be tripping with them.   also it sounds like youre very young, possibly still in highschool. i would recommend that people avoid psychedelics until they become mature, independent adults and get their life in order. doing psychedelics in highschool could seem harmless but could have long-lasting effects. the tweaks your mind will undergo during a psychedelic journey could change your outlook and ambition, causing you to make life choices that might negatively impact your future. just my advice."
shrooms,39ah2h,tanvanman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:34:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. Although I am young (22), I am independent (been living on my own for 3.5 years) and mature in many ways. My parents are very open about their negativity towards homosexuality and bisexuality, yet they refused to discuss even straight sexuality in any way so I've denied anything contradictory about myself to myself. (They're good people just stubborn and of a mindset stemming from ignorance.) Some of my friends come from a similar type of upbringing. I don't mean to dump my life on you but i think this info is important to help you understand where I'm at mentally and to explain why I'm a bit behind the curve. I am hopeful that the mushrooms will give me a better understanding and actual acceptance of myself. I just don't want to come out to someone until I'm comfortable with myself. I'm a pussy haha but these are my concerns."
shrooms,39ah2h,tanvanman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"gotcha, thanks for the details. you sound a bit like me....im not bisexual but i grew up in a religious, conservative household and didnt break free until i was in my 20s. had my first psychedelic experience at 26 and now im almost 30.   to be honest....it might be worth waiting if your friends are from a similar worldview as your parents. who knows, you might have an amazing time with them, or you might get lost in your own thoughts and stress about everything -- wanting desperately to talk to them about your sexuality but knowing you cant. shrooms, for me, is like a lie-prevention drug. the idea of saying something that isnt true becomes an absurd concept because it makes me want to talk about truth and knowledge non stop. its like a key to a door in your mind that, when opened, reveals everything for what it truly is in its most basic form.   best case scenario: you have a great time, no hiccups and the topic of sexuality never comes up.  worst case scenario: you have a horrible time lost in thought and paranoia, wondering if your friends know already and/or fearing that youll accidentally tell them...and/or you'll tell them while on shrooms because it feels ""right"" to talk about the true you, but then later regret it after the shrooms wear off and you can't take those words back  gonna be a tough choice...good luck! if youre determined to dose but are really afraid of the consequences, just do less. 1g will have you feeling the effects, but youll never lose control or get overwhelmed by your thought processes."
shrooms,39ah2h,only_spoons,2,Wed Jun 10 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"It's a legitimate concern. It could come up. Fortunately, shrooms tend to have a boundary-dissolving effect, so if your friends keep taking them they should start to become less judgmental. If one's honest, most trippers come to at least the temporary realization that gender labels are arbitrary. How your friends will react to that is anybody's guess."
shrooms,39ah2h,psychestoner,2,Wed Jun 10 14:36:58 2015 UTC,Thank you for responding! In all honesty I want my boundaries to dissolve and I want to better understand myself. I just don't want to be vocal about it. I am debating if I should just wait for another time or if I should just go for it.
shrooms,39ah2h,SukSumDong,2,Wed Jun 10 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, a low to moderate dose isn't likely to cause you to spill the beans. We all have countless 'inappropriate' thoughts, and I've never found mushrooms to interfere too much with the filters to verbalizing those thoughts (not saying your sexual identity is an inappropriate thought). However, if your sexuality is very much a front burner issue in your life right now, then suppressing that could be like not scratching an itch - you can do it, but enjoyment of the trip will have a lot to do with your ability to focus on different things. If you go through with it and the subject comes up, I recommend telling yourself that you can attend to that later, because it's best to catch negative thought loops before they become obsessive (which is a lot of what a bad trip is about)."

Everyone told me I was crazy because I opted to stay awake even the dds but I told him I wasn't paying for anesthesia it was like most of the bill so he wrote me a script for for 1 5mg vallium that I took an hour before surgery then I got a total of 8 shots of nova Caine two by each tooth only two were impacted he yanked the other two right out and cut the other ones out I was totally spaced out watching blood and tooth pieces hit his plastic face shield with the sound of the drill and elevator music in the background. When it was done he said that was the quickest and easiest extraction he had to do because I was awake and able to move how he told me I didn't bruise or swell up like I see most people look after oral surgery.

shrooms,39c0h6,HuntedLEM,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"16 is old enough, shrooms are a good first time psychedelic. My first time I split 22g (fresh) of some stronger shrooms with a friend and it was great. It's best to lie in a dark room from what I've heard, so my advice would be to go to the lake at night time. Don't eat in the 4 hours before you trip (shrooms are stronger on an empty stomach) and important: remember to stay hydrated when you're tripping. Bring a bottle of water with you."
shrooms,39c0h6,Xx420yoloscopes_w33d,0,Thu Jun 11 09:39:09 2015 UTC,A half track probably won't make yu trip that well. I'd eat like 2.5-3 grams depending on the shrooms for your first time. You really should wait until you are at least 18. Be safe.

shrooms,3992gh,Triple-V,5,Wed Jun 10 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"The comedown is probably my favorite part, tbh.  I have the same deep thoughts you do and have come to some pretty profound realizations about my life and existence in general. And yes, the thoughts persist with me too, and thats another thing I like.  They can really change you for the better...when done properly and not abused.  It is these experiences that have led me to truly believe that shrooms really are something special with the power to bring peace and growth when used properly.   I would say you are very close to having the same experiences but it sounds like you are fighting the strange thoughts instead of embracing them and seeing where they may lead.  Shrooms can bring us some things from your subconscious that you may not be necessarily ""fun"" but can really help you grow as a person if you go with it with the intent to learn.  Try to keep and open mind and see where your thoughts take you.  I would recommend reading some books on philosophy and doing some meditation as practice and primer before your next journey.  Listen to some Terrance Mckenna talks on youtube too. These things can help get you on the right level of consciousness to prepare and get the most out of your trip.    With all that said, if you're really just looking to have a fun goofy weird time, go with LSD.  Its more recreational imo. Shrooms can be a blast too but it often does bring the mental depth, which is good, but not always right for every situation."

Only I had done shrooms before, for the other 3 it was a new experience. We did it in a sunny day in vondelpark, and it was so beautiful.  They all loved it, it hit all of us differently but me and another friend were definately hit the hardest. There were some points in the peak that I was losing grip of basic concepts, I even forgot where I was at one point and couldn't feel/move my arms. We were kind of lucky in that 1 friend didnt get hit so hard so he looked after us more.  This sounds a bit scary but none of us freaked out since we all knew it was just the drug, and the pure euphoria we experienced was just mind blowing. If you can find a park with no humans thats great, but we couldnt so we just used vondelpark. Honestly, other people dont bother me that much but I know some people get a bit paranoid. It was also great as once the peak had passed we were all went on a big walk around the park, stopping to appreciate everything and felt like a real adventure.  Imo 15g is a good starter dose, it will blow your mind but you wont lose to much of a grip on reality. Me and my friends bought 15g with the plan to take 10g since we were pretty nervous about taking it all, but we just decided fuck it, and i completely dont regret it! Good luck, any questions let me know!"

shrooms,3971rq,Yawaworht_7331,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:28:19 2015 UTC,"You sure?   I thought it was just due to some funky law thing.

However, from here I doubt that you would ever see that many pins, and after many pftek grows in have never see that many of pins with such harsh discoloration.  My advice would be to separate these cakes (assuming there are others)  into a 2 liter ""poor mans"" terrarium and empty and clean your current chamber. There's no point in jeopardizing your entire harvest for a couple of bunk cakes."

Little more details:  The cakes looked great when I birthed them and everything went fine with dunk/roll on May 18th. Been decent, but not amazing at misting/fanning. Got some blue-ish/green marks that someone said was bruising and they suggested a secondary dunk/roll. Did that and was good about misting ~3 times per day and fanning 4-6 times per day. I've seen no growth except what you see here. Temp has been between 69-75 degrees F. Humidity occasionally drops below 95% but I will mist and it goes back up. Getting some sunlight each day.   Main concern: contamination. Secondary concern: why I've seen absolutely no progress.  Any help: greatly appreciated."

shrooms,397f4a,AngelBurger,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:46:52 2015 UTC,I dunked for 24+ hours. I'm pretty sure I gave them their 7 days (I thought I was ready but realized I was going to be out of town so had they had to wait).
shrooms,397f4a,OneFunGuy03,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"As someone recently pointed out to me, 24 hours is way too long for cakes. Those appear to be wide mouth half pints, which will take 12ish hours. If you were doing pint cakes 24 would be on the too much side but fine. My only theory from here is you drowned them and it's stalled the grow. If this is the case expect continued slow growth until they've recovered, if they recover."

shrooms,397tzf,Aieqqmm,2,Tue Jun 9 23:01:38 2015 UTC,I would agree with you except those are definitely cubes. They may be old and leathery but you can tell from the caps (and particularly the way the caps have mottled after drying... cubes have a kind of distinctive effect there) and the blue bruising in a few of the pictures.  That and it's pretty unlikely some sketcho at a music festival went through the trouble of finding random look-a-likes to sell to the unwary as cubes so that he could risk drawing massive heaps of legal attention to himself when someone dies of liver failure from ingesting toxic shrooms. It's not like OP picked this in the wild and wants us to ID them.  I'm 99% certain those are Psilocybin Cubensis. They just look like shit.

shrooms,394fe7,DarkAngel401,2,Tue Jun 9 04:49:08 2015 UTC,"These popcorn jars are just hitting two weeks now, and I have seven jars that look similar to it. I started with ten but three were lost to contams, sadly.   Bulk typically (afaik) employs the use of a monotub. It just ends up producing a lot more fruits than the traditional BRF tek. The yield is much bigger as the amount of spawn that the mycelium feeds off is much greater than in little brown rice flower cakes. I can't give an exact number on that, as this is my first monotub grow and second grow altogether.   I'm extremely optimistic though!"
shrooms,394fe7,DarkAngel401,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:59:00 2015 UTC,I purchased spores today and hope to receive them by the end of next week. I'm super excited. I tend to be fairly good with growing plants. Let's see if I can do fungi. Im having high hopes.

shrooms,394fe7,Narcotic7,3,Tue Jun 9 13:19:17 2015 UTC,"Make some LC from these jars.  Just before you spawn them, take your syringe filled with sterile, non chlorinated water and inject it into a jar before shaking up the grain.  Shake it up.  Then, tilt the jar, pierce the port with the syringe and extract the water.  Bam!  You now have liquid mycelium to innoculate more grain with and next time colonization time will be cut in half.  Plus there will be less risk of contamination."

It's recommended to case them and not do cakes, as they may produce mutant/strange fruits.  In terms of the high, in my experience it's definitely fucking worth it. I've never grown them but had the chance to try them myself, and a gram of these were probably as strong as 3.5 of some old B+ cubes.  Of course if you really want potency from B+ cubes they can easily match PE if you isolate a strain on agar, but from the spores they seem to be much stronger."

They really need to be grown via bulk like a monotub, they don't seem to do great with cake grows.  I've always felt that PE is completely worth it to grow for personal use.

They don't grow as easily, and yes, some of them do mutate and look bizarre, but all in all if you're an experienced grower they shouldn't be that much harder to grow, you might just not get as big of fruits."

shrooms,395x8p,muddywater87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:04:00 2015 UTC,"How much should I start out with for shrooms?   If you're just taking the run of the mill Cubes, then I suggest an 1/8th for your first time. That's what I did and many of my friends and family have started that way with no issues.   How's it compare with acid?   I've never done it personally but friends of mine have said that you might not get as strong of visuals but it takes your mind much further out there.   How long would it last?   6-8 hours depending. If you do the lemon Tek, it might come up faster and peak faster and the trip will be cut by an hour or so."
shrooms,394mkt,walkerfall,9,Tue Jun 9 05:47:41 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a paradox. On the one hand shrooms will amplify whatever you are feeling, so it's better to wait until you are in a good space.   On the other hand, shrooms can make you feel connected and full of love, which I have found very beneficial for my own depression.  Since it's your first time, I'd recommend waiting until you feel better. Tripping is not like being drunk or stoned, really nothing can prepare you for it.  Why don't you take your portion of the shrooms and keep them for another day? I'm sure your friends will understand if you explain to them how you feel. Properly dried shrooms will last for many months."
shrooms,394mkt,happiefish,2,Tue Jun 9 07:10:27 2015 UTC,"Oh i answered but seems like it didn't post :/ Since they always take the shrooms together and wait a long time after one trip I am not sure if they'd give me some to wait. Also I am a little bit nervous because I always hear you can't prepare yourself for a trip and it is not what you expect. I've read hundreds of trip reports and I feel ready to expirience the unexpirienced, but the last thing I want is a bad trip."
shrooms,394mkt,greeniguana6,2,Tue Jun 9 12:43:53 2015 UTC,"You should absolutely wait. Obviously nobody is ever without problems, but if you're feeling angry and stressed you should strive to work out those issues first. Smoke a few bowls with some friends and try to clear your head.

shrooms,394mkt,Hnnssy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:09:51 2015 UTC,We would take it at one friends house since his parents are gone over the weekend and head out later on if the trip goes well. Since the friend grew the shrooms on his own I can decide on my own how much I want to take. I have thought about 2 grams and after waiting maybe more but that depends on how strong the trip would be. What would you recommon? My friends are more expirienced so I will ask them too.
shrooms,394mkt,Hnnssy,3,Tue Jun 9 07:45:26 2015 UTC,Here's what i would recommend.   Spiritual trip  3.5-5g so you get a full trip and experience letting go of your ego i would do it at your friends house and maybe not leave until you are past the confused state. Maybe get a fourth friend to tripsit so you are safe and have everything you need. This could help with your negative feelings. Note it wont be a very fun trip but it will be enjoyable and you'll learn a lot about yourself.  Fun Trip  If you just wanna trip to have fun 2g will be enough and you should go exploring with your friends but stay away for busy roads etc. after the confused state ends while you still be high it wont be very intense you can redose if you feel the need but you will need to take more than the first amount.  Anyway goodluck and good vibes :)
shrooms,394mkt,Hnnssy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:34:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply and good wishes :) I'd totally love to expirience a spiritual trip but I didn't know if this was appropiate for a firt trip. I read a lot of things about losing touch with reality, OOB expiriences and things like that. If I am in a state like this is it still possible to communicate with my friends and feel my body, or I am just completely gone? I wanted a not tripping person at the place but I found no one in for it. My friend said its not that big of a deal if we are staying inside and just go out if I feel safe enough.  I heard a lot of things about people being on shrooms and hallicunating crazy stuff and jumping out of windows and dying becausw of it. Is this really possible or just an exaggeration?

Again, i'm just about to mix mine up, but I've seen other with that same problem and it was suggested to gently use a paper towel to remove the extra moisture on the top.

Even though it says 5 days, I should probably wait longer.  I should also mention that I'm not directly misting the mycelium (nor misting it 6 times a day) i'm just misting the casing to make sure it stays moist.  I think I might gently dab with a paper towel. The moisture seems to have dripped down from the lid and is pooling slightly ontop of the mycelium. I'll report back with any changes :)  edit: I just went and put on some clean gloves and started lightly dabbing the mycelium with paper towel. Wow, there was quite a bit more water pooled on the mycelium than I thought. I dabbed the whole monotub and got as much of the excess water off as I could without damaging the structure. Then I fanned the whole monotub quite hard to try and remove any extra water as well as provide some FAE.  Hopefully this while help my casing finish colonizing and my pinset will follow shortly afterwards. Does anyone know if pins start to form before the casing layer is fully colonized? Thanks!"

Some teks also use a microwave to sterilize substrate. It all depends on what tek you are doing.  When you inoculate you need to be very sterile. You can build a glove box or even cheaper, a still air box. Wipe down all surfaces with alcohol, a bleach solution etc... If you say you've watched many videos, then they should have covered all the sterile techniques.   If you are inoculating with a syringe, be sure to flame the needle until it is red hot between each inoculation point.

shrooms,3931ti,anatomyboyz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:07:53 2015 UTC,"You need to explain further.   My goal is bulk and so far I will be using verm and tin foil   Vermiculite is inert. Just placing grain in a tray and putting verm on it is an option, but not a ""bulk grow"". Mixing it together and fruiting it is another option, but again, not a bulk grow. You need to mix your spawn into something nutritious that the mycelium can actually draw nutrients and water from. The idea is providing a much larger medium to hold water and nutes with a larger surface area that can sit inside a tub and create humidity on it's own rather than providing it through some other means.  A ""fruiting chamber"" can apply to any bin or bucket you grow in, so this doesn't make sense to ask what the difference is between the FC and a bulk grow. Even if you spawn to a larger sub, and setup a monotub style ventilation system- the bin itself would still be referred to as a fruiting chamber.  What exactly are you planning on doing? A jar of wbs isn't considered a ""cake"", and yes, you are going to have to break up the seed to tray it- although if you've got a wide mouth jar I guess you could just dunk and roll them and fruit them like BRF cakes? That would be kinda stupid though.   Bulk just means ""big"". You can take your spawn and make your substrate as big as you want, but you'll need more than verm, and it's going to tack time on to colonize more substrate. It's worth it, but it's up to you."

There's a way to get a monoculture going without agar if you want a quick write up.  Substrates- yeah, the 50/50 verm/coir technique's great to start with. Nothing gets the results horse poo does, but start with the 50/50 and then go from there; adding more stuff with new go-arounds. Straw, peat, poo- use coir as your base and keep trying new additions into the substrates. Eventually you'll settle on something or keep trying to improve on it. You can't really go wrong with the mixtures, you'll know when it's looking right. Too wet, add in more dry material.  I'm using coir/verm/black kow manure at probably a 50/20/30 split respectively these days. Just clean out any large debris, mix, hydrate, pasteurize and mix with the spawn. You can always make shit-tons of spawn in all sorts of fun ways, and generally coir/manure/verm/straw etc. are pretty cheap. Experiment with reckless abandon!! 🍄"

The dehydrator removes time and energy and costs a little more, while the other route requires days and days and requires building stuff and buying random things to make a desiccant chamber."

I actually just had my first major journey with them yesterday morning, after my last trip three years ago (which was without preparation and the blind intent of recreational use - having fun witnessing the kaleidoscopic geometric patterns) - which without doubt turned into the most intense, terrifying experience I've ever gone through.   Like you say, of course every one has the right to the sovereignty over their own consciousness and I wouldn't think ill of anyone who uses recreationally, but I sure would never go into it without proper preparation and without the intent of learning and analyzing and exploring my psyche, the end goal being becoming a more spiritual, humble, loving, better human.   Most people I know have no idea that there's deep spiritual purposes and medicinal benefits outside the realm of recreational use and getting 'fucked up'.  I can only speak from personal experience, but three years ago - accidentally dosing myself too high and having to deal with the complete disembodiment of mind from body without knowing what kind of neuropsychological power psilocybin holds, certainly shook me up, opened my eyes, and made me realize that these are certainly not something (for myself anyway) to be fucked around with and disrespected.

shrooms,38wfmb,Khalestrophy,6,Sun Jun 7 15:24:36 2015 UTC,It slightly shortens but strongly intensifies the high.

shrooms,38wfmb,Luigi_From_Frozen,6,Sun Jun 7 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"I suggest you use lemon, water won't work. The point is that the solution is acidic as this converts the psilocybin into psilocin directly instead of your stomach doing it and thus it goes faster into your system."

shrooms,38wfmb,Luigi_From_Frozen,3,Sun Jun 7 17:53:20 2015 UTC,It will be no different from just eating them. The point of lemon tek is that the lemon converts the psilocybin into psilocin (which means you gotta eat it after 20-30 minutes or they start breaking down too) and thus creating a somewhat shorter but more intense high.
shrooms,38wfmb,KaptenBrunsylt,4,Sun Jun 7 18:22:43 2015 UTC,"It comes on really fast too, I was tripping before I finished my glass of lemonade shroom slush haha. That was the craziest shroom trip I've had thus far."

shrooms,38wfmb,KaptenBrunsylt,2,Sun Jun 7 23:03:59 2015 UTC,Nope grinding them up and putting them in cold or warm water to drink them would be just fine. It will just save you from chewing them. He is saying water is not the same as lemon juice.   You can take them anyway you want. Lemon/orange juice is not a necessary part of the process. Your stomach acid will convert them just fine.   For your first time just take them how you want. No reason to add more variables into the mix. Once you know how you react them you can start messing around.   Slightly shorter but slightly stronger does not equal better just different. Enjoy your trip.
shrooms,38wfmb,acrosonic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:03:28 2015 UTC,"Although not to the same extent perhaps, grinding them up does increase the surface area and speed digestion, even without lemon juice. Think about dropping a whole mushroom in acid. The acid has to work its way from the outside in. Powder has a greatly increased surface area and digestion occurs more quickly (in your stomach acid).   But like /u/acrosonic said, yes you will become intoxicated with or without lemon juice."
shrooms,38wfmb,myceli-yum,2,Sun Jun 7 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"I'd assume OP would not swallow the mushroom whole. Chewing well and grinding are simular but they thankfully don't get caught in your teeth when you don't have to chew them.   It's rare I get nauseous with shrooms but I gag when I have to chew them. Drinking them in a tea, cold water or grind them into chocolates makes it go down better.   BTW If your stomach does bother you, know it will pass. Just chill maybe go for a walk and distracted yourself you will be feeling fine soon."
shrooms,38wfmb,acrosonic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"I was just trying to explain how a larger surface area helps speed digestion. Most people chew at least a little when they eat large mushrooms, I hope!  I agree that powdering them beforehand for tea/water/whatever is more palatable to having to chew them (gag). Extracting them in everclear can really cut down on nausea too!"
shrooms,38wfmb,myceli-yum,2,Sun Jun 7 19:14:33 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time with dosing my Everclear extraction. I use it with my spent cakes so I don't have a starting weight to compare it too.

shrooms,38wfmb,acrosonic,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"Don't bother potentiating it. I do recommend grinding them up and mixing them with water, as this makes the stomach load a little easier, but you don't need to do the lemon juice thing. 2g is pretty low, though, I'd do 2.5."
shrooms,38wfmb,ComradePyro,3,Sun Jun 7 16:55:43 2015 UTC,"Really? Alright then, everyone says it depends on your mind set and currently I'm the happiest I've been in my whole fucking life so I guess I don't have to worry about that. Any other tips? I'm planning on having a (sober) friend watch me and hang out with me while I'm tripping, then a few weeks later I'll do the same for him."
shrooms,38wfmb,Luigi_From_Frozen,2,Sun Jun 7 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"Only tip I can think of is to be willing to explore any feelings you have, good or bad. People talk about ""bad trips"" but I never use the term, I call them ""difficult"". Dunno how to explain it clearer than that, but the difference is important. Being open to receive is important.  Bothering to potentiate before you actually do your dose seems like counting your chickens before they hatch, approaching the thing with the wrong mindset. I do highly recommend dosing higher than 2g (I'd say don't go above 3.5 for your first time) though, as dosing low is usually more uncomfortable than dosing high."
shrooms,38wfmb,ComradePyro,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:25:04 2015 UTC,"This first time and probably the next couple times, don't go into it with too many expectations or plans. Take some time to just explore this other realm. The first time I tripped, I dosed way too low, and went in with ideas of what I wanted to contemplate and tackle. Way too much for the first trip. The next 3 times I just had fun. I put on headphones and blasted off into space with EDM pumping in the background.   Once you've spent some time feeling out the psychedelic world, then you can start trying to accomplish something with your trips. Best advice I can give you is to just have fun, man. The serotonin release will have you grinning from ear to ear before you even feel anything. Pretty soon after you'll start feeling a little tingly, then in no time at all you'll lose your perception of time, your senses will sort of expand (music sounds...different, almost wider), and you'll feel like you're a million miles/years away from everything."

shrooms,38wfmb,inidostry,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:54:52 2015 UTC,"Do you have any evidence? I mean breaking up the psilocybin is possible, I've tried with and without the tek."
shrooms,38wfmb,KaptenBrunsylt,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:25:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's a lemon tek correct? It increases the high?"
shrooms,38wfmb,ComradePyro,2,Sun Jun 7 15:25:22 2015 UTC,Shorter and more intense. Psilocybin is converted to psilocin in the acidic solution. Since psilocybin itself is not active (it is a prodrug for psilocin) this is desirable as it circumvents the required metabolization from psilocybin to psilocin.
shrooms,38wfmb,myceli-yum,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:00:39 2015 UTC,IMHO lemon tek speeds up the onset but does not increase the intensity. It's not like it magically adds to the psilocybin content of the fungus. Grinding them into a powder without the lemon juice (surface area vs. your digestive juices) also speeds onset.
shrooms,38wfmb,ComradePyro,2,Sun Jun 7 16:04:42 2015 UTC,"It actually reduces the psilocybin content of the fungus, the acidic solution reacts with the psilocybin and converts it to psilocin. Since psilocybin is a prodrug for psilocin, this is desirable.  Anecdotally, I can attest that it does increase the intensity by a fairly large margin for me when I do it."
shrooms,38wfmb,myceli-yum,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think there have been any papers on it (who would fund this stuff), but I haven't had the same experience, comparing lemon-tek vs. powder. All I get is a faster onset.   I agree that the acidity of the lemon juice may have some effect at converting psilocybin to psilocin pre-ingestion (more quickly), but your body does the same thing with its digestive juices post-ingestion. I can see how absorbing more psilocin at once (thanks to lemon tek's ""pre-digestion"") could result in a more subjectively intense, shorter experience, but it's still the same amount of psilocybin which converts to the same amount of psilocin; the question is just the timing of how your body is absorbing it."
shrooms,38wfmb,arkanys,2,Sun Jun 7 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"The aspect of timing is very important though, because timing does determine intensity. Intensity can be related to peak plasma levels of the chemical. The higher the plasma concentration, the higher number of receptor sites actually come into contact with the chemical. By converting the psilocybin to psilocin, one achieves a higher peak plasma concentration, because the psilocin is absorbed more quickly compared to taking them normally. Because your body absorbs more in a shorter period of time, it has less time to metabolize the psilocin, resulting in a higher concentration of psilocin throughout your body, which corresponds to intensity."
shrooms,38wfmb,myceli-yum,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:06:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with this assessment. I think my question about the lemon tek would be how much of the conversion happens because of solely acidity vs. enzymes unique to the stomach? You obviously know your stuff so if you can explain the mechanism of conversion I'd love to learn.   What I also mistakenly see on this sub sometimes (I know you're not saying this) is that lemon juice somehow objectively increases psilocybin and therefore psilocin content of the fungus, which would make the trip both longer and stronger."
shrooms,38wfmb,arkanys,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:13:53 2015 UTC,"As far as I understand it, the chemical Psilocybin differs from the chemical Psilocin by a phosphate group. Whatever mechanism can perform dephosphorylation will do the job of converting it. So if an acidic solution dephosphorylates the psilocybin entirely, which is really a matter of duration, then there will be no more left for the metabolic system to take apart. There are other enzymes in the human body that perform dephosphorylation, but they will only aid in processing whatever hasn't been processed. Here's a good source from maps on the subject: http://www.maps.org/research-archive/w3pb/2002/2002_Passie_22704_1.pdf"
shrooms,38wfmb,myceli-yum,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:41:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch for the article.   I'm still curious--wouldn't there need to be alkaline phosphotases in the lemon juice in order to foster the conversion? The information I could find suggest these enzymes are only found in animals and bacteria. If alkaline phosphotases do not function well under acidic conditions (as opposed to the more basic environment of the liver), how do they do their job in lemon juice? Or is that not the desired mechanism with the lemon juice?  Could it be that the lemon juice helps break down the chitin in the mushroom cell walls and that causes the faster absorption instead (or perhaps in addition to)?"
shrooms,38wfmb,arkanys,2,Sun Jun 7 23:00:38 2015 UTC,"No problem! I'm actually confused about this aspect as well. If dephosphorylation is occurring in the lemon juice - which, you're right, is uncertain - then it is not occurring enzymatically, but by being denatured by the acidic solution. I'm not sure if this is the case, because your suggestion of the acid breaking down the cells which would contain the psilocybin seems parsimonious to me. I wasn't able to find anything on dephosphorylation via acid, but one way to test this would be to take pure psilocybin and expose it to lemon juice, and compare this to the experience of the pure psilocybin alone, if you could obtain pure psilocybin."
shrooms,38wfmb,ComradePyro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and speed of absorption is important for intensity. This is easily understood when comparing injecting an entire gram of heroin to taking a gram of heroin orally over the course of 2 months. Same amount, different intensities because of speed of absorption. Same applies for alcohol, you can drink a few shots on an empty stomach and be totally trashed, whereas you could drink the same amount on a full stomach and only get a light buzz.  Remember that as soon as the drug is in your body, it's on its way out of your body. So if it gets absorbed faster, the peak amount of the drug in your system will be higher than if it were being absorbed slower. This seems to indicate that the dose being lemon tek'd will determine how noticeable the effect is. I'm sure that lemon teking 2g will have a much, much less pronounced effect than doing the same with an eighth or more."

shrooms,38wfmb,BOOBS_AND_DRUGS,5,Sun Jun 7 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"Very mild effects, slightly shorter perceived duration (~3 hours depending on dose and how much you are paying attention to your body). Lights might seem brighter, you might feel a little different, but you would not have the bright closed-eyed fractals and loss of body boundaries that come with a large dose.   If it's your first trip, however, I do recommend taking a small dose. Safety is #1 and I thought it was nice to ""dip my toes in"" my first time so the next time with a larger dose I didn't feel afraid."
shrooms,38wfmb,Superhippie1000,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:02:23 2015 UTC,"Start with a relatively small dose, and you'll appreciate the next trip that much more. The first time I tripped it was only 1.8g, and I spent the night confused and not really sure what I was supposed to be feeling. I got into kind of a weird mindset, and that would have been sketchy on a higher dose. The next few trips I went substantially higher on dosage and had a friggin blast.   Definitely work your way up though. I don't think micro-dosing is really a good way to get used to the feel of shrooms, but 1.5g to 2g is generally a good starting place.

I guess some tips would be:   Prep is super important, even more so than with a normal trip since you will be extremely far gone when you peak. On a normal trip, an interruption might be unpleasant or inconvenient, but you can potentially still deal with it. Make extra sure that you'll be safe and that you'll have everything on hand, water, comfort, etc... Probably best to take a dose like that inside your home or private garden.  Don't fight the trip. Let it take you. Ride the wave. Things are going to her SUPER weird. Just roll with it. Don't try to force it and leave your preconceptions behind.  I guess that's it.

They are mycorrhizal (you were close) the actual vegetative body of the mushroom is growing underground around the roots of their symbiotic hosts (it looks like a white web). While each mushroom fruiting body has millions of spores on their gills there is only a very small chance that one of the spores will come into the right set of conditions and meet the correct type of spore and host to germinate and fruit.   In the ""wild"" this will take years to get from spore, to mushroom to fruiting body."

Would it be possible to dig into the ground and remove some of the vegetative network of the fungus from around/above the roots without killing the whole fungus and then transfer it along with the fruiting body and plant it in my yard, making sure one part of the underground network touches a tree root? as well as disperse seeds in that same spot. is there any chance that that would result in the fungus attaching itself to the new host tree in my hard and take less time than many years to develop enough of the vegetative body underground to sprout new fruiting bodies?

shrooms,38zx16,Corndog_Enthusiast,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"A great way to increase your harvest would be making a ""Holy Grail"", as the Ambrosia Society calls it.   The process is basically inoculating a terra cotta pot with Amanita Muscaria mycelium, and using the pot as a never-ending supply for ambrosia (an A. Muscaria infused drink). Each time you add the grape juice to the pot and let it steep, you're creating ambrosia and feeding your A. Muscaria culture at the same time!  Here's a link to their PDF outlining the details of every possible A. Muscaria preparation:  http://www.ambrosiasociety.org/files/herbofimmortality2.pdf  Instructions for creating the grail start on page 60, but I strongly recommend reading up to it from page 53.

shrooms,38zx16,Corndog_Enthusiast,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"Grape juice is very acidic. Can the fungus survive that level of acidity? How would the fungus survive without a host (a tree?) I don't want to unnecessarily kill the fungus for my amanita, that would be selfish. When you pick the mushrooms you're not killing the fungus or even preventing it from creating new fruiting bodies... Harvesting the myocelium, if done carefully, would leave the myocelium on the ground alive, but if you plant it elsewhere you're taking in a new lifeform as your responsibility. If you plant it, you're giving it life in your yard/garden instead of destroying it, but if you plant it without a host then it will die... That doesn't seem like the right way to go... Also, eating the mushrooms is the traditional way, I'm drawn to it. :) Thank you for the suggestion anyway. If I misunderstood anything you can PM me to explain more."
