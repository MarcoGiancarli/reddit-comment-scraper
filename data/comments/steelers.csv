I can't hear it without thinking of steroid use or even a live broadcast I saw where ben got hurt and went to the lockers a bit early at half time. The commentators said he was going in to ""give him the juice"" which I can only assume means some sort of frowned upon pain killer or muscle relaxer."

steelers,3e4wrs,kingeg,5,Tue Jul 21 23:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'm from Britain too, got into NFL about 3 years ago. One general tip I would have for you is don't try to understand everything at once. Obviously consume as much as you want but it's pretty complicated at times and you won't enjoy it if you try to get too complex before you know more basic things. I recommend this book by Pat Kirwan, it covers things like formation and strategy in really clear terms, good for people who know the very basics but want to know more.   Sky is pretty good with broadcasting games and the advantage of supporting a team like the Steelers is that they have more primetime games, meaning that they have more dedicated coverage on Sky. However if you want to watch every Steeler game you'll have to start using illegal streams (these will be linked in game threads), of which there are plenty but the quality is generally pretty shit, or buy a Gamepass subscription. Gamepass is Â£130 for the whole season, which is obvoiusly a lot of money but the service is fantastic. Not only can you watch up to 4 games live simultaneously, switching between the audio whenever you want, but you can also watch back any team's games not only from this season but from the past 5 seasons too. I find this really useful for when someone here or on /r/nfl mentions a specific play that a player made which perhaps didn't get a highlight on nfl.com, you can go back and watch it from multiple angles. There are also plenty of threads in /r/nfl where OP asks for good games from the past 5 years to watch if you're just wanting to watch some good games. However you wanna watch games, get used to long, late Sunday nights and shitty Monday mornings (they're usually bearable if the Steelers win).  Steelers.com is also an excellent resource. Watch as many of the videos and articles as you can to keep up with team activities, and spend some time this offseason learning about the different players battling for spots on the roster, as this makes preseason quite exciting.  When it comes to actual games both this sub and /r/nfl will have gamethreads where you can talk about the games as they happen. I usually have the game in one tab and the /r/nfl gamethread open in another. This is especially useful for people here in NFL illiterate parts of the world, as if you're like me you probably aren't watching the game with anyone and it's good to have a few thousand people to banter with during the game.   I've found the more I put in the more I get out. Obviously games are exciting, but I'm at the point in my obsession where I was jumping around in excitement at the beginning of this year's Free Agency period. It is quite possible I am in too far, but I'm pretty happy with it. It's an awesome sport, and gets a kinda unfair reputation over here because of Rugby. If you've got any questions I'm here, but you can also ask /r/steelers or /r/nfl any wonderings you have about the game. If you explain that you're new and just trying to learn they'll go pretty easy on you."

steelers,3e2lha,Antonio_Browns_Smile,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:33 2015 UTC,Ben is the best player in our division. It's not even close... As the 2nd best QB in the league he is the most valuable player in the AFC in my opinion. JJ Watt is the best player in the AFC though.
steelers,3e2lha,DriArcher,6,Tue Jul 21 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"If you started a team, would you rather have Watt or Big Ben?   Look at it this way, Houston is still a bad team with Watt. That's how important the QB position is. The Steelers without Big Ben are a 4 win team."
steelers,3e2lha,Maculate,3,Tue Jul 21 14:19:26 2015 UTC,"I love Big Ben and all, but no I don't think we would be a 4 win team if we replaced Ben with a league average QB.  Dalton is it?  With Bell, Brown, Bryant, a vastly improved offensive line, and a young but promising defense, we get at least 5-6.  Most years Ben is able to pull a mediocre team up, but he has a pretty great supporting cast now."
steelers,3e2lha,Antonio_Browns_Smile,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:04 2015 UTC,I said that Ben is the most valuable. There are many many QB's I'd rather have than JJ Watt. But that doesn't mean that Watt isn't the best football player in the league.

steelers,3e2lha,Antonio_Browns_Smile,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:22 2015 UTC,"I just don't think it's fair to shrug off a player just because they aren't a QB... If I had to choose between having Andy Dalton and some scrub DE or JJ Watt and some scrub QB, I'd rather have the Andy Dalton package. But there's no way in hell Dalton is a better player than Watt... The QB position is just too important. It's just not fair to compare it. In a bubble without influence of positions Watt is a better DE than Big Ben is a QB. IMHO."
steelers,3e2lha,tonytroz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:06 2015 UTC,As the 2nd best QB in the league he is the most valuable player in the AFC in my opinion.   You rank him above Rodgers and/or Brady? There's no way that's objective.
steelers,3e2lha,Antonio_Browns_Smile,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"I think Ben is better than Brady right now. Prime Brady was better than Big Ben could ever dream of being. But if I had to choose one to go into next season with, I'm glad Ben is our guy... The most valuable player in the league is Aaron Rodgers and it's not even close, he's easily twice as good as Roethlisberger, who I believe to be the 2nd best QB."
steelers,3e2lha,SleestakLightning,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:35 2015 UTC,"Rodgers isn't close to being twice as good as Ben.  He's better, sure. But it's closer than you're giving Ben credit for.

steelers,3e1bj1,MattEven,3,Tue Jul 21 14:01:03 2015 UTC,Exactly. Anytime I hear Tomlin bashing I bring up this fact. He's a great coach and the players play for him.
steelers,3e1bj1,Bauter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, his first four years or so he was using Cowher's loaded roster. Any decent coach would have had similar results. His last four years when that talent ran out were two 8-8's and two wild card game losses. Those are disappointing seasons, and an 8-8 season IS a losing season when the expectations are this high.  He's still a good coach though. 4 division titles and 2 super bowl appearances in 8 years is no joke even with heaps of talent.  Still, I want to see him make another deep playoff run or two before Roethlisberger's time is up. It took 5 years to build this top tier offense, anything less than a conference championship game with it is on Tomlin."
steelers,3e1bj1,tonytroz,5,Tue Jul 21 17:17:31 2015 UTC,It wasn't Cowher's roster it was Colbert's. The same man who built Tomlin's teams.
steelers,3e1bj1,MattEven,3,Tue Jul 21 18:24:34 2015 UTC,"Cowher still had most of the control over the roster when he was here. When Tomlin took over they pushed practically all of that responsibility to Colbert.  Regardless, Tomlin was dropped onto a Super Bowl caliber team and he produced. The teams since 2011 were not Super Bowl caliber but still decent and he didn't produce a playoff win. His legacy will include both periods, and great coaching legacies can boost decent teams to great teams."
steelers,3e1bj1,tonytroz,0,Tue Jul 21 18:38:56 2015 UTC,Cowher didn't want to draft Big Ben so there's that.
steelers,3e1bj1,sw337,0,Tue Jul 21 22:49:06 2015 UTC,I can't stand the argument that anybody could have done well with that roster.  It's bullshit.
steelers,3e1bj1,Diarygirl,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:19:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I am curious what the excuse will be if we are 1 and done in the playoffs this year. We have one of the top 5 offenses in the league talent-wise. And Tomlin was supposed to be this defensive mastermind. The defense shit the bed last year and LeBeau took the fall. If they suck again will we sacrifice Butler?
steelers,3e1bj1,social_psycho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:11 2015 UTC,"They've invested a ton in Butler and didn't leave him much established talent so I don't think there's any chance they dump him after one season. This defense is probably going to take a couple more seasons to get back to the Steelers traditional top tier defense, but as we saw last year you can still win a division without that.  The playoff game was a 5 point game with 10 minutes left last year and the offense got shut out. That can't happen this season."

steelers,3e1bj1,ctornync,4,Tue Jul 21 17:02:27 2015 UTC,I'm a big Tomlin fan but this is undeniable. Didn't the Cowboys get a dedicated game manager so their head coach doesn't make game-time strategy calls? Sometimes I wonder...
steelers,3e1bj1,marianeditor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:15 2015 UTC,"Tomlin looks better than he really is because he has had Ben QBing his team since day one. And LeBeau has long been the other key man in the organization, so it will be interesting to see how much the team misses him in the next couple years. But w/o a franchise QB like Ben, Tomlin's game management issues would be a much bigger problem.   The Bottom line is that Cowher was a much better coach. Cowher's teams rarely blew big leads or lost to obviously inferior opposition - both of which have been significant problems under Tomlin.  The Steelers could do a lot worse than Tomlin, of course, but when Ben's career is over, Tomlin may not look all that good anymore."

My old man and I have had a pretty rocky relationship and we don't currently speak but when we did no matter what was going on in our lives we always had the Steelers to talk about.

I remember Super Bowl XL was almost an afterthought to me. I mean, I was excited, but I wouldn't have cared if we lost. As we got into the 2010's, I became more aware of the ins and outs of the NFL. I was really interested in the stats, ratings , and what not. These past few years have been pretty tough for me for a number of reasons. And football has been there to sort of take me away and have something to invest in time wise."

My mom died from cancer when I was 8 years old in spring 2005. A quarter of my family was cut from my life, and the rest of us just kind of had to keep on going. My dad was a Steelers fan his whole life from watching them in the 70's, and the 2005 Super Bowl season cemented me as a Steeler fan for life just like him.   That season meant a lot for me. 4 hours every week watching the Steelers with my dad, its something we could share ever since then. I'm not religious or even spiritual at all, but I believe my mom helped us win the Super Bowl that year. To give us a little distraction from life at the time.   Go Steelers"

So as a child i didnt understand much about why my dad would yell at the tv every sunday but i soon learned. then i became a big fan and started watching every televised game here, and super bowl xl was an amazing thing to watch. watching bettis was so awesome, i will always remember his clutch goal line TD vs the bears in the snow. i would watch the season dvd with breakfast every morning just to relive it. then super bowl xliii came and that was even better, ive never screamed so much after that holmes catch. i was so upset after the super bowl loss in 2010. i take great pride in being a Steelers fan and have always been given a ton of shit being from where i am from, but i always remember to stay strong, which is just what Pittsburgh is all about. the Steelers are probably my favorite thing to be a part of and they will always be a part of me"

There may be a little bit of shade in the upper rows of the bleachers, but it's better to be safe than sorry. There are trees at the one end of the practice fields they use most, but that limits how much you can see a little bit as well.  Your best bets for autograph seeking are the stairs coming down from the Student Union building (opposite side of the fields from the bleachers) because that's where the locker rooms are. The coaches don't use those stairs, but instead go up the path near those trees I mentioned earlier and straight back up to the dorms. If you're trying to get autographs after practice, make sure you head over to the stairs a little while before they're done.  If anybody else wants info on restaurants and stuff around training camp, let me know."

Carey Student Center. You can congregate on top of that hill, right on the sidewalk/road in front of the Student Center, as well, but you have to go around the long way up past the admissions building to get there. The coaches go up the path by the first base side of the baseball field then head towards Rooney Hall.  Oh, and if you're going for the very first open practice, they won't be in full pads, just helmets or helmets and shoulderpads, so they won't be doing any live tackling. If you get there early, you'll have a chance to get autographs as they're heading down to practice and then see them do their pre-practice stuff (everybody likes watching the QBs try to throw into garbage cans and the punt returners try to catch punts while they're holding a bunch of footballs)."
steelers,3dysum,Diarygirl,3,Mon Jul 20 17:33:51 2015 UTC,"It sounds like so much fun!  Everything you've written is so helpful.    Questions about autographs:  Is it realistic to expect to get autographs?  Of course I'd like AB to sign my jersey, or Le'Veon to sign my son's, but I can't imagine that happening.  So any ideas about what I should ask a random Steeler to sign?  A TT seems like it would be hard to write on.  I have a Steelers calendar, but there's probably only about 9 current players on it, and of course none of the rookies.  It doesn't seem like it would be cool to be like ""Hey, Senquez, could you sign this calendar that you're not in?""  Please forgive me if these are stupid questions.  I think this heat and humidity is affecting my brain."
steelers,3dysum,rhino43grr,2,Tue Jul 21 01:10:34 2015 UTC,"It's definitely realistic to expect autographs if you're in the front row along the fence before or after practice, just don't be disappointed if one specific player you're hoping for doesn't sign your stuff.  The players will sign whatever you have, but I know Ben doesn't like signing Terrible Towels because they're hard to write on like you said. I'd say footballs are one of the easier things to get signed. The one practice last year, Antonio Brown signed for people on the complete opposite corner from where the stairs are. My younger cousin ran all the way over there when he found out Brown was over there. He was the last one AB signed for that day. Brown started riding away on the golf cart with his ball and had to toss it back to my cousin, so he kept bragging that he caught a pass from Antonio Brown."
steelers,3dysum,Diarygirl,2,Tue Jul 21 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"Wow!  I would freak out if AB threw me a ball!  Of course I would probably drop it or it would hit me in the face.  I don't know why I didn't think of a football.    Yeah, I don't expect anybody specific.  I'd be happy with any Steeler."

steelers,3dwaqb,ColdNose,5,Mon Jul 20 06:13:31 2015 UTC,I disagree.  The defense doesn't need to be full of pro bowlers to get to the Super Bowl.  I think our offense is to the point where the defense only needs to be above average to win.
steelers,3dwaqb,gravitythrone,2,Mon Jul 20 11:08:09 2015 UTC,"To have a good shot at beating a team like Seattle, the D needs to be 15th or better with no giant holes like last year's secondary. Yes, our offense is phenomenal. Good enough to be a first round exit in last year's playoffs with a lousy D. People do, in fact, get injured. What happens if one of the three B's goes down? We need a D that can at least not hurt our chances to realistically have a shot of going deep.   Check back with me in November if our D sucks. You're full of July optimism right now. You can't be great in one phase and shit in the other (assuming average ST) and expect to go deep in the tournament when the teams start getting good.   Edit: Actually, we're in agreement. I said we needed 1 or ideally 2 (of the 4 I listed) pro bowlers out of 11. 15th or better with no glaring holes should be enough to go deep."

What's more sad is that Worilds was the other player with 7.5 sacks & he's gone. The saddest part of last season was that a 36 year old James Harrison that was acquired during the season and didn't play every down was third on the team with 5.5. I pray that we can actually get after the QB next season."
steelers,3du2ql,JBProds,3,Sun Jul 19 20:15:49 2015 UTC,"I know we're all down on Jarvis, but I've still got some faith that he can put it together and have a sort of mini-breakout year this season. The surprising thing about him is that he's much better at setting the edge and dropping into coverage than I imagined he would be in the NFL. The guy is a natural, instinctual football player. He'll never be a 12+ sack guy, athletically he'll never be that kind of threat, but he can still be a jack-of-all-trades OLB for the Steelers and a quality player in this league. At least I hope. :/"

steelers,3du2ql,hippydipster,9,Mon Jul 20 15:27:16 2015 UTC,I expect that number to be a lot higher this year too. Dicks system relied on defensive ends to act as gap stops.

steelers,3duq1s,DriArcher,7,Sun Jul 19 17:42:28 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know what to expect. If we see Bryant turn into the amazing receiver we want(and think) he will be, maybe Wheaton's targets will go down. If Bryant has a sophomore slump, maybe we get even more from Wheaton than we did last year. And who knows, maybe Coats is amazing as well. It will be very interesting to see how Ben and the staff want to spread the love around. We have so many good receivers that we need to give each of them there fair share. It is a very good problem to have."
steelers,3duq1s,tstscavo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"Bryant is exceptional at getting open and busting big plays, but he still needs to work a lot on his hands (most catches came when he was wide open because of his speed and size). While I go think he's a hugely useful tool for the offense, he can't be relied upon as a possession receiver yet. I think there will still be touches for Wheaton even after Brown and Bell."
steelers,3duq1s,laboratory_koala,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:05:52 2015 UTC,"Usually WRs improve a lot from 1st to 2nd year, because of how much more they understand the playbook.  A Sophomore slump is unlikely."

steelers,3duq1s,JackLambertsBalls,2,Mon Jul 20 01:20:57 2015 UTC,"I think Wheaton will see more time as the #2 in 2-WR formations than most people expect, not 100% of the snaps but pretty close to half.  The key is that he attacks all levels of the defense: fast enough to run vertical routes and good enough to get separation on short, one-cut routes if the corner plays off."
steelers,3duq1s,kenzington86,2,Sun Jul 19 22:28:06 2015 UTC,"Wheaton is a talented, athletic WR but I think he's often overlooked because of the crazy good players around him (AB and Bell primarily but also Bryant and Heath come to mind). I think he will be an exciting slot WR and will cause grief for defenses. They'll put their best DBs on AB, have a safety/ILB watching Bell, 2nd CB on Bryant, and then hope theyve got a 3rd CB to keep pace with Wheaton. I think his targets will be comparable to last year but think his receptions, yardage, and TDs will increase."

He is very talented, 3rd season in the system with Ben will help a lot, an off-season practicing slot, etc.    The Steelers offense will be more well rounded this year, which means they will be better.  Wheaton should be a big part in that."

If he doesn't drop balls and blocks when he's asked to he's fine in my book. Seems like he has the ability to be effective on the bubble screen type plays we've had some success with, or the speed to get into space on end-arounds. Can he throw? Randel-El-like throwback to Ben to a wide-open whoever? Job opportunities abound"

Myself, I may not like the rule but I was angry at Le'Veon for breaking it.  I know I'm generalizing, but I feel like Pats fans think Brady and BB can do no wrong ever.  I'm confident it will be reduced to two games."

I think it will be reduced since it was a first offense and he's been proving himself and been saying all the right things to show that he has learned from his mistakes.   Good luck in fantasy! I won fantasy last year with Bell last year.
steelers,3du6nd,sweatergang,5,Sun Jul 19 14:47:54 2015 UTC,Bryant will be a sleeper WR
steelers,3du6nd,tstscavo,5,Sun Jul 19 17:23:40 2015 UTC,I think everyone's well aware of him by now. At least I am. He'll torch the Pats' secondary Week 1.
steelers,3du6nd,hawkeyes1847,7,Sun Jul 19 20:07:27 2015 UTC,"No outrage at all. I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that they are so busy with the Brady case that they need to only focus on that.  No word. Bell doesn't even know. I think there's a definite chance it gets reduced, but I'm not holding my breath. No chance it all gets taken away. I think if it gets reduced, it will be to 2 games. But I still think it stays at 3 games."

We don't know how many games Brady's suspension can be reduced, or even eliminated.   Not knowing who your RB is gonna be for week 3 is very different from not knowing who your QB will be week 1, 2, or 3."

steelers,3du6nd,kingpatzer,2,Sun Jul 19 23:28:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone about 1 and 2, but I sincerely doubt that his suspension will be reduced. First offense, yes, but the CBA draws very hard lines as to how substance abuse issues are handled. The appeal was only lodged because NFLPA recommends all punishments to be appealed, but there is little to no expectation of a reduction. That said, I hope very much that I am wrong and Bell gets a break, but there is no realistic reason to thing that he will."
steelers,3du6nd,Chris-T,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:54:39 2015 UTC,"I think there's a very good chance the appeal will be marginally in his favor. As I understand the ruling, he is losing 4 games paychecks but only suspended 3 games. That sort of inconsistency (and a demand that he work for free) is the sort of thing that should get over-ruled. Now that said, I expect the outcome of the appeal to be that he only loses 3 games pay and can't play in 3 games not that the game suspensions will be reduced."
steelers,3du6nd,1htaehn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"I remember the Josh Gordon's appeal taking forever, the time before the last time.   People had to draft him in fantasy not knowing if he was gonna play at all that season."

steelers,3dnf7r,InhumanTarget,11,Fri Jul 17 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"Great idea. I know I don't post here much, but I'm glad the sub is around.   My only request might be to limit the number of threads that jump up around the same topics. Like, if we all want to talk about someone's contract, let's keep to one thread, rather than having three people start a new thread just to share what they think. I don't ever want to limit anyone's opinion, but maybe we can just trim down the sub some and keep it focused.   Just my two cents."
steelers,3dnf7r,RenderedInGooseFat,5,Fri Jul 17 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"I try to do that somewhat.  The issue I see is if something happens when no mods are online, and say 2 threads are posted, I don't really like deleting one, if they both have a decent amount of comments.  If each thread is at 20+ comments by the time any of us see it, it kind of sucks to just eliminate all of the comments in one because a different thread was posted earlier.  I definitely understand the cons though also of more clutter, and somewhat fractured discussion.  If I catch it soon enough, or if most replies are in one thread over another, I will usually delete one though."
steelers,3dnf7r,InhumanTarget,3,Fri Jul 17 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"It would be nice if there was a way to merge the two, but I appreciate the effort that goes into keeping things lean and mean."
steelers,3dnf7r,RenderedInGooseFat,3,Fri Jul 17 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"I would love to be able to merge threads, unfortunately, it isn't possible on reddit, outside of just copy and pasting stuff, which doesn't really have the same effect as a comment, or telling everyone in a thread to re-post what they had elsewhere.  One thing I could try is setting up an automod rule, that will respond to every comment in a thread with a given flair.  I could flair the post,  so autmod responds to everyone saying there is another thread, or something along those lines, then remove it.  It isn't perfect, but that should be doable."
steelers,3dnf7r,InhumanTarget,2,Fri Jul 17 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"That's kind of cool, actually. It might be a nice way to nudge everyone onto one thread, everyone mixing ideas. Nice. Thanks for taking some time to think about it."
steelers,3dnf7r,RenderedInGooseFat,2,Fri Jul 17 19:16:17 2015 UTC,"I added the rule.  That should make it a little easier.  I think it will only remove future posts, but I'm not sure."

steelers,3dnf7r,ChickenLiverNuts,3,Fri Jul 17 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"The flair selection is a bit generic and not very fun.

steelers,3dnf7r,RenderedInGooseFat,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:30 2015 UTC,"I would be fine with adding player face flair.  The issue is finding good pictures, and having identifiable players.  In basketball it is easy, since there isn't really any padding.  Football is a bit tougher, with the helmet obscuring the face of players.  Outside of Ben, Brown, Bell, Beard, Heath, Harrison, a few o lineman, and a few past stars, I wouldn't be able to pick any players based on their face.  For instance I have no idea what Markus Wheaton looks like, or any of our corners, or safeties.  Timmons has been on the team for a decade, and I'm not sure if I could pick him out of a lineup.  I can look at adding a few iconic heads though, like we have for Tomlin, and Cowher."

Thanks to everyone here and the mods for being an awesome sub! Go Steelers!"
steelers,3dnf7r,JackLambertsBalls,3,Sun Jul 19 00:45:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I have been away in a country that only has 3G internet.  Can I say something?  1.) Kudos to u/renderedingoosefat and the rest of the mod team for taking suggestions from the last State of the Sub and putting them into practice.  AutoModerators are the gold standard shit and you guys are kicking ass.  I also love the weekly Swag Wednesdays, Shitty MS Paint and Photoshop Thursdays and the other ways you guys have accumulated all of our random banter and mental diarrhea into specific days.  My OCD commends you, you guys are doing a great job.  2.) PLEASE KEEP UPVOTE PARTY THREADS! Now that we have AutoModerators can we utilize them for GDT, ONE UPVOTE ALL CAPS AFTERPARTY and the Post Discussion Thread?  I think there is something to be said about the importance and need of an Upvote Party.  Yeah, yinz reckon that people just want to karma whore.  So what, use an AutoModerator.  It is a place for users to come and act like sexually aroused camels on rollerskates.  This helps to keep users from going off to other team subs and being abusive and tarnishing our fanbase's reputation.  Also, they are shit-tastic fun on a bun.  It is such a hoot to act like a midget with a jetpack that has chugged 20 Iron City's while having his testicles hooked up to a car battery (image missing.)  PLEASE KEEP THE ALL CAPS UP VOTE PARTY AND ALLOW THE AUTO MODERATOR TO MODERATE!  3.) STAT-sorry, State of Subs are great, thank you for doing them.  How about one before the season and one at the end.  This way we keep the engaged users of the sub interested in staying engaged with the community aspect of r/steelers.  It is awesome to see the mod team starting to show themselves a bit more and I understand that yinz should lurk more than you should comment.  Thank you for asking for feedback and putting that feedback into practice.  I just worry that we will dilute the State of Sub effectiveness if we throw one every month.    4.) ""Reddit was never supposed to be a bastion of free speech."" A lot of shit has gone down recently.  I think that you the mod team has done a great job over the years at limiting harassing, threatening and discriminating comments.  I would like to say you can do more.  I think that you guys should be deleting more comments and casting a discriminating eye over some of the shit that gets posted around here.  We had that incident a few weeks back and I for one would like to give the mod team more latitude (or at least blessing or backing) to delete more comments that are deemed detrimental to the sub.  CondÃ© Nast reckons Pittsburgh is great, so lets help the overlords know that r/steelers is just as good.    logik, wiggy, sam, goose, you are all good apples in my book.  Thank you for doing the hard yard and giving Steeler Nation a place for fans around the globe somewhere to talk stillers and screen passes.    Can we have a Todd Haley Day?"
steelers,3dnf7r,Diarygirl,3,Mon Jul 20 00:49:00 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree with you more!  Yes, please, please, we need to still have upvote parties!"
steelers,3dnf7r,RenderedInGooseFat,2,Mon Jul 20 03:08:27 2015 UTC,"1.)  Thanks  2.)  I am fine with leaving 1 up per week, the issue is it has to be started by a user, instead of automod.  Automod is great for things that will be posted at a very specific date and time, but not so great with flexible times, like the end of a football game.  For something like that, we would need a bot, and the biggest hurdle there is hardware.  I can write the code to do all the stuff we want, but I need a server that is running 24/7 for that to work, and I don't have that yet.  3.)  I can definitely see that point of view, and maybe we can dial it back to every 3 months, or maybe even just twice per year.  I agree there probably isn't enough that happens here to warrant a monthly topic about this.    4.)  Part of that is us not wanting to steer conversation too much, and part of it is also lack of reports or modmail about issues.  Reports are fine for putting something in the mod queue, but mods don't get any notification that something has been reported.  We have to either check the mod queue, which is largely just spam by shadow banned bots, or happen to come across the comment/submission that was reported.  If you see something that is absolutely harassment, or something that absolutely needs to be reviewed, send mod mail to get our attention.  When you report something we get no notification.  With mod mail, we get a red message indicator on the upper right of the page.  It will just help us get to issues much quicker.  I do realize that means you have to put your name to the report, so if you, or any other user, feel uncomfortable doing that, I definitely understand.   Can we have a Todd Haley Day?   You can do whatever you want.  This is your sub not ours.  Our job should be to try to limit, and eliminate, harassment, doxxing, and stuff that is just off topic like posts about how to process steel the metal.  It is the job of the users, which includes the mods, to drive content.  If you want a Todd Haley day, I would get behind it."

steelers,3dn0ov,fatguyinakilt,9,Sat Jul 18 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"I honestly think this is the year the team finally admits their mistake with Landry Jones.  I think they roll with Ben, Gradkowski, and Boyd.  I don't understand the infatuation with Devin Gardner. If he looks like he can play receiver, fine then let him make the team there... but is he all that different from Dri Archer (who isn't getting cut no matter what, being a 3rd rounder)?  Devin Gardner was a TERRIBLE college quarterback. What makes anyone think that he'd be better in the pros. Yes, I realize he'd be 3rd string, but I'd rather sign Charlie Batch off the street TODAY if we needed a QB than start Gardner there. If he was the Indiana version of Antwaan Randle El, I'd say at least he did it in college, so maybe something translates there.  I really hoped they'd go after Terrelle Pryor. Pryor can do everything Gardner does, better. He's got a bigger arm, he's more accurate, he's bigger, he's faster...  (FYI I'm not ranting on you OP, I'm more trying to understand why the Steelers are even playing him at QB)"
steelers,3dn0ov,steelbydesign,3,Fri Jul 17 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think he kind of reminds people of Kordell Stewart, the slash type player who would be a valuable weapon for the offense.

steelers,3dn0ov,steelbydesign,3,Fri Jul 17 17:50:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have any problem with a QB that is versatile, I have a problem with Gardner... because he's a terrible QB. He threw 10 touchdowns and 15 picks his senior year.  Both the guys you mentioned were pretty good college QB's. Dixon had 20 TD, 4 picks, and another 9 rushing TDs his last year at Oregon. Kordell had 10 Tds, 3 picks, and 7 rushing TDs."

steelers,3dn0ov,batypus,5,Fri Jul 17 21:22:00 2015 UTC,"Jones has to go. Personally, I'm kind of rooting for Tyler Murphy, UDFA QB working both receiver and quarterback prep for the Steelers in addition to Gardner.  After transferring from Florida last year, he broke the Boston College record for rushing yards by a quarterback (both single-season and career), passing former Boston College legend Doug Flutie in only 9 games. He also broke the ACC single-season rushing record by a QB with 1,079 yards gained.  Completed 131-of-230 passes for 1,623 yards with 13 passing touchdowns. I watched the Pitt game last September when he ran for a 51-yard score and threw for a 48-yard TD.  http://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/pittsburgh-steelers-opinions-reactions-news-updates/2015/5/28/8677017/former-boston-college-qb-tyler-murphy-the-unaccounted-for-steelers"

steelers,3dn0ov,Fragile_FRA_GEE_LAY,2,Fri Jul 17 16:50:11 2015 UTC,"Part of me wishes we kept only 2 QBs on the roster so we could fortify some other position. I get that the 3rd QB could be needed but the possibility seems so remote. Perhaps we will sign Murphy or Gardner at WR with the possibility of bumping them into QB if disaster strikes.  as it stands now, I think it will be Ben and Bruce, and I think they will give Landry every opportunity to show some of the talent he displayed in college."

steelers,3dknj8,Diarygirl,4,Sat Jul 18 03:20:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you have to take those risks. Some pay off, some don't (see the Antonio Brown contract that is arguably the best in the NFL because they gambled on one 1000 yard season). This is a market value deal for the type of player he is and he's only 26. If he goes to free agency he makes 70M+ and the Steelers lose him.  Guess how many other DL had sacks for the Steelers last season? McLendon had 1, Tuitt had 1, Keisel had 1, and Cam Thomas had 0.5. Heyward had 7.5 himself. Let Heyward go because he hasn't made a pro-bowl and you don't have anyone else that made one either."

steelers,3dmcxv,steelbydesign,2,Fri Jul 17 13:07:27 2015 UTC,Nice opinion piece. It seems like players of his talent usually end up getting good/appropriate contracts early if they're being significantly underpaid.
steelers,3dmcxv,tinkthe,-5,Sat Jul 18 05:03:30 2015 UTC,"Iâd say Antonio Brown might be a better receiver than Megatron, and his cap hit is about half of the Lionsâ starâs.   Antonio Brown 2014 - 1698 yards receiving Calvin Johnson 2012 - 1964 yards receiving    Antonio Brown 2014 - 13 TDs Calvin Johnson 2011 - 16 TDs    Can we please stop with the comparisons already? Megatron was banged up last year and still managed to put up his 5th 1000 yard season in a row despite only playing 13 games. When he's healthy he's objectively the best receiver in the league, hands down.  Yes, Brown was the best receiver in 2014. No doubt about it. I'd expect another 1500+ yards and another 10+ TDs in 2015 as well. But 2014 was his ceiling and Calvin could realistically put up 2000 yards. His best season was over 100 yards better than Jerry Rice's best season."
steelers,3dmcxv,tonytroz,7,Fri Jul 17 15:41:07 2015 UTC,"How is 2014 ABs ceiling? He's done nothing but improve each year.   I think the ONLY reason CJ is considered a better WR I'd because of his size.  Antonio runs routes better,  plays the sidelines better, and straight up burns people in open field. Calvin is so big and strong that he can go up and get a ball,  or roll over people that can't tackle him.  Now imagine AB if he was CJs size.."
steelers,3dmcxv,DriArcher,4,Fri Jul 17 20:16:43 2015 UTC,"Johnson will also turn 30 in a couple of months. I didn't say Brown was absolutely better, I said he may be. Saying Brown ""reached his ceiling"" seems pretty subjective to me.   Yes, so far, Megatron has been better. I wouldn't be shocked to see Brown's numbers surpass his over the next 5 years though.  And the point was about money. Give me AB at an 11 mil per year cap hit over Megatron with a 20 mil per year hit ALL DAY.  Get your panties un-bunched."
steelers,3dmcxv,wendysNO1wcheese,2,Fri Jul 17 16:40:36 2015 UTC,It was only AB's ceiling because we have so many other options on offense.
steelers,3dmcxv,jfuss04,5,Fri Jul 17 17:41:17 2015 UTC,Ab hasn't declined so why is that his ceiling
steelers,3dmcxv,ChrisZuk14,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:31:33 2015 UTC,I would say he hit his ceiling also because Ben threw at his every chance he had. The same as Romo and Stafford do with their receivers. This year and the foreseeable future we will have more options for Ben to throw at. I say that 2014 was his ceiling for the Pittsburg Steelers for the next 5 years.
steelers,3dmcxv,wendysNO1wcheese,2,Sat Jul 18 02:02:05 2015 UTC,Ben threw at him every chance he had? Don't think we were watching the same team.
steelers,3dmcxv,ChrisZuk14,0,Sat Jul 18 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"Brown had 129 receptions during the regular season. Wheaton had the second most out of the WR's with 53 receptions. If you combined every other WR reception, Brown still had more receptions. Big Ben threw to Brown early and often in every game. You're right I don't think we were watching the same games."
steelers,3dmcxv,wendysNO1wcheese,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"Did you not mention Le'Veon's 83 receptions on purpose so it fits your narrative or just because you're stupid? *And oh, Heath had 66 receptions too. Third highest in his career."
steelers,3dmcxv,ChrisZuk14,0,Sun Jul 19 13:18:39 2015 UTC,I said out of WRs. Why would you bring a RB into a conversation about Ben throwing to receivers? It's just my opinion man. No need to call a complete stranger and fellow steelers fan stupid.
steelers,3dmcxv,ChrisZuk14,0,Sun Jul 19 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"But just to drive the conversation: Brown was targeted 181 times, which is 3 passes shy of 1st place (D Thomas 184). Third place was targeted 163 times and 4th was 151. So saying Big Ben didn't pass to Brown every chance is simply wrong. Not saying it's a bad thing. Just saying when Ben dropped back to pass he was always looking to see if he can get the ball in Browns hands."

Plus he's improved every year, there's no reason to believe brown couldn't do more with less opportunities if he has improved on his game since last year."
steelers,3dkrk2,helpimtooawesome,4,Fri Jul 17 01:49:39 2015 UTC,Yes we should be able to sign both. Don't forget Lamarr Woodley's contract comes off the books next year.

steelers,3dkrk2,taryuken,2,Sun Jul 19 01:07:08 2015 UTC,"It's possible. Assuming Heyward has a cap hit of about $10M next year, they will have around $14,000,000 in cap room next off-season. Beachum should probably get around $8-9M of that, then DeCastro is still under contract for next year, so his won't take effect until 2017. As for having cap to play with? Since they overpaid Gilbert and Allen? Probably not."
steelers,3dkrk2,maltrab,2,Fri Jul 17 02:19:53 2015 UTC,Gilberts contract isn't that unreasonable. I was thinking if we cut Cam Thomas we can add the cap savings from that to next years cap which should gives us a little bit of room. Also we probably won't keep Harrison and DeAngelo Williams next year. But it's not long til we have to sign Bell.... Which should prove to be very expensive. We may have to draft a Foster replacement.  EDIT I keep forgetting we're going to have to sign Steve McClendon and Willie Gay as well.
steelers,3dkrk2,maltrab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:49:14 2015 UTC,I'd let McClendon and Gay walk honestly. Keeping guys into their 30s got the team into the mess in the first place
steelers,3dkrk2,IdunnoLXG,4,Fri Jul 17 14:05:27 2015 UTC,"McClendon, yes. Gay? No.  There were times when Gay was the only one on the secondary who cared and outside of Timmons and Harrison he was the only one on the defense who cared to even show up against the Ravens in the playoffs. If you look closely had he not been on the team, the game would have been worse than it actually was.   I don't even know if we beat the Jags without Gay doing what he did. We can't let our best DB just walk."
steelers,3dkrk2,maltrab,3,Fri Jul 17 14:19:15 2015 UTC,"When he's going into his 30s and only going to get worse, then yes you can."
steelers,3dkrk2,Drakengard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:25:10 2015 UTC,"One would hope someone younger that we've drafted will be good enough to play his role.  I love William Gay, but we'll need to move on from him if things get tight enough."
steelers,3dkrk2,klubsanwich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:17:50 2015 UTC,"Might as well cut Harrison and Big Ben while we're at it.  Every season, you take the best guys available. Maybe you don't give a 30 year old a long term contract, but you don't cut a guy just because he's a little older."
steelers,3dkrk2,maltrab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:59:16 2015 UTC,I never said cut Gay. I'm just saying that it might be best to just let him walk when he hits Free Agency and not commit long term to him. Short term? Sure. Long term? No thank you.
steelers,3dkrk2,knows_some_people,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:24:44 2015 UTC,Gay has shown  nothing but improvement every year. I short  term deal is deserved and necessary.

steelers,3dkrk2,maltrab,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:17:45 2015 UTC,Issue is the dead money we would actually be paying him at that point. I'd like for the team to get a clean cap sheet for once.

steelers,3dkrk2,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"I doubt Heyward's hit will be $10M next year.  His yearly average is a little under $10M, and cap hits usually go up over time.  I wouldn't be surprised if his cap hit next year is $5M-$6M.  Same for Beachum.  He will probably get a big deal, but his first year cap hit will likely be low."

steelers,3dj9n1,kspauld2,15,Thu Jul 16 18:45:34 2015 UTC,"There is little doubt that after winning his second MVP award in 2014, Aaron Rodgers is the best quarterback in the NFL.  What does remain in doubt is who ranks second on that list.  Arguments can be made for Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck, Drew Brees or Super Bowl XLIX MVP Tom Brady. But when all of the evidence is weighed, the Pittsburgh Steelers' Ben Roethlisberger is now the second-best quarterback in the NFL.  Roethlisberger had a fantastic 2014 season. He was tied for the league lead in passing yards (4,952) and actually led that category if penalty play (e.g. pass interference, defensive holding, etc.) yards were included. Roethlisberger tied for third in yards per dropback (7.5) and ranked third in yards per attempt (YPA) (8.1), completions (408) and completion percentage (67.1).  EDITOR'S PICKS  Joyner: Steelers are favorites in AFC Ben Roethlisberger's elite numbers and the presence of the best wide receiver in football are among the reasons Pittsburgh is the team to beat in the AFC. A major factor in the upper-tier placement in these metrics was Roethlisberger's elite passing totals on vertical throws (aerials traveling 11 or more yards downfield). He placed third in vertical Total QBR (97.9) and was tied for the highest vertical YPA total among quarterbacks with 200 or more attempts at that depth level.  What makes these rankings even more impressive is Roethlisberger posted these figures while doing a fantastic job of protecting the football.  He was second only to Rodgers in bad decision rate (BDR) among quarterbacks with 500 or more pass attempts last year. BDR measures how often a passer makes a mental error that leads to a turnover opportunity for the opposing team.  This had been an area that Roethlisberger struggled in previous seasons, but his 0.8 percent BDR in 2014 indicates he made a mistake of this nature fewer than once in every 100 pass attempts. This was also an area of strength on the vertical passes, as Roethlisberger had the lowest vertical BDR among passers with 100 or more vertical attempts.  That is a very strong case for Roethlisberger. Now let's take a look at his competitors.  Peyton Manning, Denver Broncos  Manning ended the 2014 campaign with some impressive numbers, but his statistics faltered badly down the stretch. From Weeks 10-17, Manning posted a 10.8 vertical YPA mark that ranked 15th in the league. During that same span, he also had seven bad decisions on vertical passes, a major reason he finished tied for 25th in interception percentage (6.5 percent) in that time frame.  The Denver brain trust knows that asking a 39-year-old quarterback to carry an offense for an entire 16-game regular season and playoff run is not a good idea. It's one of many reasons the Broncos are going to more of a run-heavy system this year. It's also a good argument for why Manning can longer be considered the second-best quarterback in the league.  Tom Brady, New England Patriots  Leading his Patriots to a Super Bowl win puts Brady into contention here, but his metrics quickly rule him out.  Tom Brady won the Super Bowl, but the metrics show his 2014 numbers weren't elite. Elsa/Getty Images Last year, Brady ranked tied for 18th in YPA (7.1). The quarterbacks he was tied with were Drew Stanton, Matthew Stafford, Andy Dalton, Colin Kaepernick and Austin Davis. Teddy Bridgewater had a higher YPA (7.3). So did Brian Hoyer YPA (7.6), Shaun Hill (7.2) and Mark Sanchez (7.8).  Brady was just as bad on vertical passes, as his 10.5 YPA there ranked 20th. One may be tempted to blame that mark on the Patriots' wide receivers, but Kansas City's Alex Smith, a quarterback whose wide receivers accounted for zero touchdown passes last season, had a higher vertical YPA (11.0). Smith also did not have the benefit of throwing to Rob Gronkowski, who led all tight ends in vertical yards (609).  If the statistical gap was closer than this, it might be possible to put Brady over Roethlisberger, but this metric distance is just too far to give Brady the win.  Andrew Luck, Indianapolis Colts  Luck may be the best young quarterback in the NFL, but he still makes too many mistakes. Luck ranked tied for 24th in BDR and tied for 18th in interception percentage. He also had 13 fumbles (ranked 33rd among quarterbacks) and lost six of those (ranked tied for 32nd).  Add in placing 23rd in completion percentage and ranking 12th in Total QBR, and it shows Luck has a lot of improvement to make in order to be classified among the top two passers in the NFL.  Drew Brees, New Orleans Saints  Brees' prolific numbers could give him the strongest alternate case for this spot, but even he had more than a few signs of decline last year.  Brees placed 11th in YPA and tied for the second-most interceptions (17). The vertical game had long been a point of metric pride for Brees, but last year the Saints had only 52 pass plays of 20 or more yards, the team's lowest total since 2010. Add in the loss of tight end Jimmy Graham and a likely move to more of a run-heavy attack for New Orleans, and it is enough to move Brees out of contention.  Bottom line  In addition to his top competition being in a declining state, Roethlisberger will benefit from the continued development of Martavis Bryant (a speedster who could give the Steelers an even better vertical passing game) and an offensive line that could be the best in the NFL. It all points toward Big Ben solidifying his claim as the second-best quarterback in the league."

steelers,3djd8l,Green89,3,Thu Jul 16 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  We're picking sleepers for every NFL team, and this is the AFC North edition. I'm guessing that DeAngelo Williams won't be many people's first choice, but I hope that the reasons I gave at least made sense.  My question is: If you could pick one sleeper from the Steelers, who would it be? I was thinking of Sharmanko Thomas, but his lack of production/my lack of knowledge of him put me off.  Thanks guys!"
steelers,3djd8l,JDChristy36,4,Thu Jul 16 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"I think the obvious choices have to be Bryant on offense and Shazier on defense, but if I had to pick a deeper sleeper than I'd go with Daniel McCullers. Many may not agree, but toward the end of the season I was watching him and I noticed one thing..... He absolutely pancaked almost everyone he went against and as big as he is, I think he could be our next potential Hampton"
steelers,3djd8l,kingkoons,2,Thu Jul 16 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"you are right about Shamarko. I think Bryant at this point is no longer a sleeper. teams will/have caught on. I think Williams is a good choice but i would have picked Shazier, Stephen Tuitt, Sean Spence, or Moats. They all (except Shazier) did really well this year, but got very little recognition."
steelers,3djd8l,huet99,2,Fri Jul 17 02:54:41 2015 UTC,Stephon Tuitt. Round 1 talent and was decent as a rookie.
steelers,3djd8l,yeshua1986,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:41:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely Tuitt. He has a year under his belt, will play full time, and will get to pass rush more."
steelers,3djd8l,Deckz,2,Sat Jul 18 17:55:45 2015 UTC,"No offense, but it seems like this article did more homework for the Bengals than any other team. Williams is a really poor choice no matter how you try and explain your opinion. There's so many unknown commodities on this team you can make a reasonable claim for, it seems a little ridiculous to pick a guy who won't do much once bell returns. You could've picked Coates, James, McCullers, Geathers, Vince Williams, Shazier, Spence, Dupree, Jarvis Jones, Shamarko Thomas, Golson, Grant, ect. I could make a sleeper case for any one of those guys because they are promising talents without years of production to hang their name on. Williams is a known commodity, just seems a little lazy to me despite the fact hes in a new offense."
steelers,3djd8l,Nelson_Pancakes,3,Thu Jul 16 22:34:20 2015 UTC,Spence would be my pick. Kid has a ton of talent and without that injury I feel he'd be a starter on more than half the teams in the league. I'd love to see him back to the way he played at the U.

steelers,3dfvyb,babyfarmer,9,Thu Jul 16 00:00:03 2015 UTC,"Kevin Colbert is pretty good at drafting receivers. I'm not too worried. DJax and Allen aren't comparable to AB. Sanders had one great season in a pass heavy offense, Denver will be more balanced up Kubiak this year, Sanders already admitted his production will go down this year. Hopkins has potential but his QB situation is dicey. I think you're getting ahead of yourself. We still have AB for 3 years, whether he likes it or not."
steelers,3dfvyb,yinzerjagoff,0,Thu Jul 16 00:45:17 2015 UTC,"None of those players are comparable to AB but will be getting paid the year after the AJ/Julio contracts, the year after Dez/Demaryius contracts."
steelers,3dfvyb,enz1ey,2,Thu Jul 16 01:32:03 2015 UTC,"Dez Bryant and Demaryius Thomas got paid like the top WRs in this year's FA class because they are the top WRs. Julio Jones will get paid probably around the same, and AJ Green will probably get slightly less than that. Yes, the value of a position climbs, but nobody will be paying some decent/okay WR to a blockbuster contract just because Dez and Demaryius got paid. Players get paid what they're worth. Antonio Brown was JUST resigned not long ago, so I don't understand why you're bringing it up like he's going to be a free agent next season.  We should probably give Ben a new contract ASAP since Phillip Rivers and Eli Manning will both be FAs next year, amirite?"
steelers,3dfvyb,steelbydesign,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"Using Ben as an example is ridiculous, not only is Ben over 30 and AB young, but the QB market has nothing to do with the WR market right now."
steelers,3dfvyb,MattEven,7,Thu Jul 16 17:06:35 2015 UTC,"I've posted my opinions of this in the NFL sub and don't understand why so many people disagree with me.  The Steelers gambled on Antonio big time when they signed him to his extension. They gave him a 42.5 million dollar deal after just 1 good season. Yes, he was coming off a 69/1100 season, but scored just 2 touchdowns. Keep in mind that was the offer they originally made to Mike Wallace who was coming off of 2 straight 1200 yard season and 18 touchdowns over the previous 2. Antonio Brown was over-paid by the Steelers when he signed his extension.  The good news? The team got a huge return on their investment. They took a risk, and it's paid off for them. Keep in mind the extensions being signed by Dez, Demarius, etc. is their 2nd contract. AB has already signed his.  AB is under contract for 3 more seasons with cap hits of 9.8, 12, and 10.8 million... Compare that to Megatron's hits of 20, 24, 21, 17, and 18.  What reason do the Steelers have to extend Brown? They could build a championship roster with the cap savings they're getting from Antonio... And sure, he may try to hold out and get a new deal, but what leverage does he really have? What's he going to do? Sit out 2 seasons?  The team could control him for a 4th season with a franchise tag, at which point he'll be 30 years old and Big Ben will be retiring, and hopefully they'll have well-seasoned Martavis Bryant and Sammie Coates, and will have committed money to Le'Veon Bell... So maybe you let AB walk at that point. It seems cold, but Antonio really sorta messed up by signing that extension so early in his career.  Antonio Brown's contract is comparable to the Seahawks getting so much out of Russel Wilson, while paying him nothing and thus signing a stacked roster."
steelers,3dfvyb,steelbydesign,5,Thu Jul 16 11:42:13 2015 UTC,They took the chance and paid Brown because they knew Mike Wallace was going to walk.
steelers,3dfvyb,MattEven,2,Thu Jul 16 12:58:10 2015 UTC,"I know that, but it doesn't change the fact that they gave AB more than he'd earned at that point. They gave him the same contract they were offering to a 2 time pro bowler."
steelers,3dfvyb,jfuss04,0,Thu Jul 16 13:34:46 2015 UTC,You can say they over paid all you want. They knew what they had in AB. They threw him an extra bone for loyalty not being a whiney baby like Wallace was.
steelers,3dfvyb,Diarygirl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:16:32 2015 UTC,He isn't insulting about he is just saying you get paid for production. And ab being number 2 and not having the production yet means they over payed
steelers,3dfvyb,jfuss04,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"Can I try to end this argument?  In hindsight, it's a great deal for the Steelers.  Of course you can say they knew what they had, /u/MattEven, but I've been a football fan a long time, and I've seen a lot of guys not live up to their contracts.  Management looks smart right now, but if AB hadn't an incredibly couple seasons so far, who knows?"
steelers,3dfvyb,steelbydesign,2,Fri Jul 17 01:04:03 2015 UTC,Well said. All contracts are gambles on a players future. Ab just happened to work out
steelers,3dfvyb,enz1ey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"I will say it because it's true. That's not a knock on Brown, it's just fact.  Even if they knew what they had, his production to that point didn't match what he was being paid."
steelers,3dfvyb,steelbydesign,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your comment except for the last part. It's not comparable to Russel Wilson at all. What would be comparable is Brown playing at this level over his entire 6th round rookie contract. Wilson wasn't extended by the Seahawks just before he broke out, he is playing under his rookie contract. Big difference."
steelers,3dfvyb,enz1ey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:41 2015 UTC,"It'd a big difference in the amount of money, but it's comparable in that the Steelers (like SEA) are getting a high level of play on the cheap.  Yes, Brown is making WAY more than RW... but I'd say his level of play at his position is much higher than Wilson as well.  I get your point, it's not exactly the same, but the Steelers, like Seattle could take advantage of the situation to put $ in other positions to strengthen the entire roster."
steelers,3dfvyb,steelbydesign,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Right, except Seattle is on the brink of a huge problem with Wilson's upcoming free agency. He has obviously outplayed his rookie contract and is going to command top three QB salary, but they've already spent much of that savings on their big defensive stars. They're gonna be in trouble over the next three years or so unless they continue their streak of amazing drafting."
steelers,3dfvyb,meowdy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:46:39 2015 UTC,"It's already started with guys like Tate, Clemons, Red Bryant, Browner, Thurmond, Maxwell, Malcolm Smith... but that's what happens with every Superbowl team.   The Steelers kept it up forever because they drafted insanely well, so they let guys walk and had cheap talent to step in. The Ravens had a similar roster purge after they signed Flacco to a mega deal.  I feel like we're getting off topic though. The POINT is getting a high level of play for way less than market value is what helps teams get to Superbowls. The Seahawks did it with Wilson, the Steelers could do it with AB."
steelers,3dfvyb,Sex_E_Searcher,4,Thu Jul 16 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"I am worried, with Bell coming up for contract negotiations in a year (2 years under contract, but can begin negotiations after his 3rd season), Brown needing a new contract in 2-3 years, DeCastro needing paid in 2-3 years, Cam Heyward being in the last year of his contract, Beachum needing taken care of after this year, and I feel like the list goes on and on. The downside to our young talent is that the bill will be heavy in 2-3 years.   Omar Khan, our salary cap guy, has his work cut out for him."

If Shazier stays healthy, there's no reason why he can't be an all-pro level player in year two. The best chance is Cam, if he continues to build on last year and maybe add a few more sacks."

steelers,3d50ol,heavymedicine,2,Mon Jul 13 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"Bengals fans suck.   I live in Cincy, and honestly they love to hate us more than they like their own team. In 2013 they clinched the playoffs the same week that we were eliminated and my facebook was more ""fuck steelers"" than ""we're going to the playoffs.""  Booing Andy after he throws a pick or has a bad game is understandable. Booing him at a celeb softball game is personal and bush league. The guy is part of the reason the Bengals are no longer a complete joke, and does a lot of really awesome things in the Cincinnati community... but yeah let's boo him."

Most of the time they seem content rooting against the success of other teams rather than rally behind a team that has a lot of talent on the roster.

Besides Brad Johnson in '03 which is still over a decade ago, ever other Super Bowl winning QB since has a good chance to be a hall of famer.  If Dalton plays better they probably still don't win a super bowl but they at least win a playoff game. You absolutely need an above average QB to win in today's game."

steelers,3cz1no,kingkoons,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"Hack & Jones are projected to go early in next year's draft. Can't see them drafting a QB in the first round let alone get a top 5 draft pick. It's early, but many mocks have both going within the top 3. This one has (Hackenberg going #2 with Jones going #3)(http://walterfootball.com/draft2016.php).  May I interest you in some Cody Kessler. Isn't getting much hype due to his 6'1 215 lbs frame, but 3826 yards and a 39 to 5 TD to INT ratio looks good to me.  Watch him here if you've never seen him play."
steelers,3cz1no,JBProds,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"he's not bad...depending on this season tho, Hack is reasonable. Kiper had Jones going top 10 and hack going 15. this makes me think he will slip through. jones, maybe not. ben is getting up there. if i was them i would be okay with drafting whichever of the 3 is possible either 1st or 2nd"
steelers,3cz1no,kingkoons,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:09:04 2015 UTC,The reason why I chose Kessler is because I've never seen anyone view him as higher than a 3rd rounder which would allow us to draft other positions and then select him and allow him to learn under Ben.
steelers,3cz1no,JBProds,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:11:18 2015 UTC,"i like that idea, but it'd be a dream come true to get 12' Gauge or Hack"
steelers,3cz1no,kingkoons,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"Would definitely be crazy to get one of those two, but not sure if they'll use a first round pick on a QB just yet. I wouldn't be against it, but we just need to let the season start first. We would need to see how our defense is and see how the new DBs and pass rushers do."
steelers,3cz1no,JBProds,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:51:11 2015 UTC,"yeah that's what i was thinking. if our Defense gets better and our offense stays on top, we might as well get as big of a QB as possible to boost success after our FQB retires. That is really hopeful but oh well."
steelers,3cz1no,kingkoons,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:07:48 2015 UTC,Am I wrong to still have hope for Jarvis Jones? He was just so dominant in college. Hopefully he comes around and he'll help solidify our front seven and that should help the DBs.

steelers,3cz1no,6enericUsername,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:48:52 2015 UTC,Ohio State doesn't even seem sure who is going to be QB - even with Cardale being the front runner.  I'm hoping that Ohio State quacks and tries to use a tandem of QB's to trick there way to winning ways but looking at how that was with Notre Dame I don't think they will win another BCS.  The major draw is he is competing with two other QB's - he fucks up just a little even in one game then he gets the hook.
steelers,3cz1no,ThatDriftingPixel,2,Thu Jul 16 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I think Braxton should've transferred. JT too, really. I really would love Cardale in PGH.

Beyond that... you look at the stream graph kind of like a stacked area chart (same visual issues), or you can peek down at the bottom for detail per city.   Interesting you mention the other leagues... Having some similar discussion on that topic in /r/Buccos I'm leaning towards only including big 4 sports, but could be swayed depending on what you guys (the fans) want / think. For bigger cities it could get really complex which would be cool... but then you run into having rival teams on the same print, so if I ever sold them that may be a turnoff. Example would be in Chicago, do I do separate posters for White Sox and Cubs? Or throw it all on one? What do you think?"
steelers,3cwxm6,cafeconcarne,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. That would be a different kind of chart... meant for comparison... this one is more about composition.

The Y being HOF-ers http://www.chartball.com/posters/MLBhistALL.html#.VaFK_5NViko   I think I'll continue to focus on cities where there's not that much competition, NY and LA would be interesting... but might require a different treatment."

Watched him knock Earl Campbell out of a game with a simply phenomenal, and clean even by today's standards, hit. The guy was surrounded by HOF material but, IMHO, he should be in the HOF.  He was that good. If you can find a few clips, you'll see for yourself. He wasn't just a brutal player, he was smart, positioned himself well, covered a ton of field, and, as the INT figures attest, had good hands."

I'll assume based on the fact you're posting this question that you're a fairly avid fan of the team and not just someone who watches a few games on TV each year and can name a handful of players.  It's free to park and free to watch practice, you get a good chance at getting autographs before and after practice if you're into that and you get to see your favorite team up close and personal. If you live within a few hours of Latrobe and/or you can't afford to go to games, it's probably worth it. If you're not interested in trying to predict the roster or do your own amateur analysis of the new players and think it would be boring to sit in the hot sun and watch guys who won't make the team do drills, it's probably not."

steelers,3cotrt,Diarygirl,3,Thu Jul 9 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"One game that I feel like doesn't get talked about much that had me on the edge of my seat was the '95 AFC Championship.  It was low scoring, and back and forth all game, with 5 lead changes.    Colts got ahead earlier with a field goal, we tied it, Colts got another field goal, we scored a TD on a pass from O'Donnell to Stewart with 5 seconds to go in the half, Colts got another field goal, and we followed that up with a field goal of our own.  At that point it was 13-9 with the Steelers ahead going into the 4th.  The Steelers had lost the conference championship the year before to the Chargers, so it was looking like we might get our first SB bid in 16 years.  The Steelers get great field position on an Andre Hastings punt return, only for Norm Johnson to have his only miss of the day.  The Colts make a couple big plays and take the lead on a 47 yard TD pass from Jim Harbaugh to Floyd Turner.  The Steelers punted the next drive.  The Colts followed that up with a fumble that they recovered, then eventually punted.  With 3:03 left, the Steelers were down 3.    The Steelers then marched 67 yards for the lead.  A dropped int, and a conversion on 4th and 3 kept the drive going, along with a 37 yards pass from O'Donnell to Ernie Mills.  Bam Morris punched it in to take the lead with 1:34 left.  Again it looked like a SB appearance was ahead.  Then the Colts marched the ball down to Steelers 29 yards line with 5 seconds left. Harbaugh dropped back, lofted the ball into the end zone in a crowd of players, and it somehow landed on Colt's receiver Aaron Bailey's chest, before falling to the turf.  The Steelers had prevailed by the skin of their teeth for their first SB appearances since the '79 season/'80 SB.  Here is the video fo that final play to show how close we were to missing the '96 SB.  That is a game that I will probably never forget even though it is one that is not talked about a ton."

steelers,3cmvq4,akmalhot,0,Thu Jul 9 11:24:19 2015 UTC,"They wanted to know because that's their job, the whole reason they even exist as a network is to bring sports news and info to the public. Whether it's good or bad, it's news. They couldn't force anyone to give out his records, someone chose to and they have the freedom to report it. Unless we find out that someone at ESPN held a gun to someone's head to get those records then they did nothing wrong.   But I agree, Schefter is a tool."
steelers,3cmvq4,rkwwvu,3,Thu Jul 9 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"Yes If it just fell into their laps, sure. However since they were the only ones w the actual medical record, I'd imaging some sort of influence was in play...

There's no additional information on the chart beyond the medical term for the procedure - no personal information or anything regarding how the injury came about - it literally just listed the procedure.

One thing to note though is that HIPAA places the blame at the hospital (if it was negligently left available to be stolen) or at the employee who stole it.

Ultimately Tomlin has final say but usually they will try to come to a consensus.  The way the Steelers draft is fairly unique in that they let their board dictate who they choose so it's not Tomlin's say or Colbert's say or Rooney's say (thank god).  They will all get together and decide who they feel is draftable out of the upcoming class. Then they go through and do their own mock draft as if they were picking in each of the 32 spots in Round 1. And they decide who they would pick at each position based on who is available.  That's how they set their draft board. The first 32 players are already ranked. As they get drafted, they get removed from the board. When the Steelers come up they select the highest rated player on their board.  Later rounds will be a combination of this exercise with at-the-moment input from the coordinators and position coaches if they can't come to a consensus."

steelers,3coi8y,fearstrikesout,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:41:54 2015 UTC,That's a meme that needs to be put to rest. The Ravens are no better than any other team in drafting players.   The one thing they do better than any team that isn't New England is work the compensation pick formula to their advantage every year. As for actual selecting of players they hit-and-miss as much as anyone else.
steelers,3coi8y,SleestakLightning,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:09:13 2015 UTC,that's a pretty good point.
steelers,3coi8y,fearstrikesout,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:11:17 2015 UTC,I know. :)
steelers,3coi8y,SleestakLightning,0,Fri Jul 10 18:17:05 2015 UTC,"I won't mention that they took Mosley while we took Shazier because it's only been their rookie year so far. Reminds me of how ""stupid"" we were for passing over Eddie Lacy for Le'Veon Bell and Kevin Zeitler for David DeCastro after each of those players' rookie years. Those worked out pretty well for us when we had more to evaluate than just the rookie years.  And even if it were valid, it's one example. What else is there? Hint: Not much. Let alone much closer than some may believe, Colbert and Tomlin's drafting may not even be worse than Newsome's at all."
steelers,3coi8y,Steinerway,-3,Fri Jul 10 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"Antonio Brown is a terrible example of a good draft team.  If they thought so highly on him, why did they pass on him 5 times?  Same logic could be applied to Brady, it's sheer luck.  The first 3 picks are where the scouting office should be evaluated.  Finding late gems in drafts as a ""skill"" is not real, because why wouldnt they just take them earlier? its very hard to evaluate talent"
steelers,3coi8y,Untoldstory55,3,Fri Jul 10 11:29:00 2015 UTC,Why draft a player in the 1st round if you know the consensus on him is that he's going to be available in round 6?
steelers,3coi8y,SleestakLightning,-2,Fri Jul 10 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"I'll buy that, but 3rd? 4th? 5th? At what point do you not question if anyone else has him on their radar? How often do 3rd round picks play a game in the NFL? It's not likely"
steelers,3coi8y,Untoldstory55,6,Fri Jul 10 18:12:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on the situation.   They already took one WR in that draft. Their scout LOVED AB. Arians LOVED AB. But they viewed it as a luxury to pick a 2nd WR. So if someone else took him, it didn't really matter to them.  They stuck to their board and when they got to the 6th round and AB was at the top of their board and they had two people lobbying to pick him, they went with the 2nd WR.  If Arians wasn't adamant about drafting him they may have passed for another position."
steelers,3coi8y,SleestakLightning,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:17:45 2015 UTC,I understand your thought process but a lot of the talent in drafting takes place late. Its not all luck. Some of my family in the Giants organization would argue that early draft picks are the easiest decisions to make while late picks have a high probability of error or bust. It's also a game of league knowledge - meaning having a good guess on what other teams are gonna do late in the draft.

steelers,3cmaba,jrile,20,Thu Jul 9 01:36:19 2015 UTC,I feel like Ben really got shafted. Luck was WAY too high! And I don't understand how AB could possibly be behind Calvin Johnson.
steelers,3cmaba,ThatDriftingPixel,9,Thu Jul 9 01:47:16 2015 UTC,Popularity contest. Did you know that Aaron Rodgers will probably be number one?
steelers,3cmaba,huet99,8,Thu Jul 9 02:06:20 2015 UTC,"Well, that is also well-deserved. Rodgers is by far the best quarterback in the NFL."
steelers,3cmaba,gingerswiz,3,Thu Jul 9 11:28:47 2015 UTC,Well now we know that doesn't put you at #1 since jj watt is a player in the NFL
steelers,3cmaba,huet99,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:31:47 2015 UTC,"He plays quarterback, which is the most valuable position on a football field. He is essentially the consensus #1 player from football sites. He is far better than the second best quarterback in the NFL, which is arguably Andrew Luck (IMO). He is also one of the most efficient players in the history of the NFL. It's kind of hard to compare a QB with a pass rusher, and if you do, you're kind of splitting hairs anyways."
steelers,3cmaba,gingerswiz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:00:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that Rodgers is by far the best QB, but as of last season, I agree with the players that Watt had a better season, with regards to his position. You also need to remember that there are players that belong in the top ten based on last year that are left out because this whole joke is a popularity contest, if I went with loyalty id have le'veon bell, big ben and antonio brown in the top 5."
steelers,3cmaba,huet99,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you that it is a popularity contest, but in regards to the top two they definitely got them right (whichever order they're in is hairsplitting)"

steelers,3cmaba,ThatDriftingPixel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:22:44 2015 UTC,"But it misses the point....of....best 100 players of 2015 when he didnt get to the Super Bowl and won - nor the fact that the man that REALLY BROUGHT HIS TEAM TO THE SUPER BOWL AND LED THE COMEBACK OVER HIM got 22 while Brady scored top 5.  Its really a biased list and I have spent way too many words and headaches over this every year when I should just say ""pffft ofcourse"" and go watch something none NFL Network till the season starts or something Steelers is on.  and btw - RODGERS DIDNT GET 1 he got two behind J.J Watts. Thank you J.J for breaking the QB popularity mold."

steelers,3cmaba,huet99,2,Thu Jul 9 01:04:05 2015 UTC,He's definitely going to need a contract soon. He is arguably the most underpaid player in the NFL.
steelers,3cmaba,Prometheus88,2,Thu Jul 9 11:29:35 2015 UTC,"I considered not even replying but I had to. This is a ridiculous statement. He is the 16th highest paid WR in the NFL. Is he a good value for the money? yes. But the Steelers didn't have to twist his arm to take the money. Also, there are tons of guys in the NFL who are underpaid relative to their status. 1.) Russell Wilson made $526,000 and change last year. 2.) Le'veon Bell, who is one of the best backs in the league, will only make $1 million this year. So to say that he is arguably the most underpaid player in the league with a $6 million 2015 salary (without incentives) is simply ridiculous"
steelers,3cmaba,schlangtowngitstash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:57:53 2015 UTC,He is one of the most underpaid players in the NFL that isnt still in their rookie contracts.
steelers,3cmaba,Prometheus88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"I'll agree that he is paid below his production. However, it's not like he is egregiously underpaid. The Steelers took a bet on him becoming a big producer and it paid off in a big way. There is nothing wrong with a team having good value in a player. Also, how many other 6th round draft picks are getting paid that much money? (outside Tom Brady)... not many. If AB has another year similar to the one's he's had of late, he will be in line for an early extension."
steelers,3cmaba,huet99,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"He took the contract when he was the third receiver on the team. Now, he is the most dominant receiver in the NFL. There isn't one NFL player or analyst (I thought fan, until now) that wouldn't say he is underpaid."
steelers,3cmaba,Prometheus88,0,Thu Jul 9 20:26:17 2015 UTC,"So, the second a player outperforms their contract, you instantly give them a new deal? Even with 3 years left on the contract? You need to remember that at the end of the day, this is a business. The Rooney's have to spread out the money to the entire team. AB is an absolutely stud and I want nothing more than for him to retire a Steeler. However, he agreed to a contract. He is honoring it, which is what he should do. This whole notion that he's ""criminally underpaid"" is laughable."
steelers,3cmaba,huet99,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:36:04 2015 UTC,"It's the degree of his performance to his contract. Usually, no. But I think most NFL analysts, coaches and players would all agree AB is one of the, if not the most underpaid player in the league."
steelers,3cmaba,huet99,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:00:36 2015 UTC,"And the guys you mention are on their rookie contracts, so it doesn't count."
steelers,3cmaba,Prometheus88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:26:52 2015 UTC,Ok. How about Willie Gay? I'd say he's outperformed his $1.5 million/season salary. Do we give him a raise?
steelers,3cmaba,huet99,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:37:33 2015 UTC,"When his contract is up, yes. That's how the NFL works. Only reason I am giving the exception for AB is because of how good he is. If William Gay were Sherman, yes I would renew his deal and give him a raise before his contract expires."

Now on to my points - of course im biased - Brown should either be higher but of course Ben and Bell need to be higher. I mean you are talking about the 2nd best offense in the whole league.    Got to have a great QB, great WR's, great O-Line and great RB to even pierce the top 5 of best in the NFL offense.  However, Kudos to Brown.

Just because we're Steeler fans doesn't prevent us from being reasonable. Moss is arguably the best receiver of all time, and Brown is trending towards a HOF path but you never know."
steelers,3cmaba,TheBigMcNasty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:33:00 2015 UTC,"Never said that Moss didn't work or that AB had bad genes. I also never ranked them.  I was just referring to how AB's work ethic has got him to where he is. I guess along the lines of this quote from Jerry Rice:   ""It was hard for me to swallow because I was not as talented and I had to work harder,"" Rice said. ""To see a guy with that much talent not give it 100 percent, it was almost like a little slap in the face. But Randy was Randy."" [...] ""He could have been one of the greatest if he had worked just a little bit harder. [...] I don't think he wanted to give it 100 percent. You never knew what you were going to get with Randy.

Back in the day when the Browns, Packers, Bears and mainly every team not the Steelers were dominant, you'd still be hard pressed to find a Pittsburgh native who didn't cheer on the Steelers. Yet we're called bandwagoners to this day.   We weren't forged on pageantry or grandeur like the Bears or Packers. We're not a major city who put in a lot of money into our teams like the Eagles. We were a team who decided we weren't going to play, ""good old football!"" like those Packers or Cowboys to please the good people of the community.  Rooney didn't want that. Rooney wanted a team made by Pittsburgh, for Pittsburgh and played like Pittsburghers. This resulted in hard hitting smash mouth football. People hated us because we didn't follow traditional lines of ""how the game should be played!"" or being the traditional ""good guys.""   We set the NFL, not ablaze, but brought down a curtain made of steel. We played hard and let other teams know that we're the hardest hitting team in the NFL, not them. Not that the team is made of a Lombardi or a Starr or a Brown but made out of guys made of steel like Joe Greene, Lambert and Blount.   We created our own football style and the NFL has hated and scolded us for it. We weren't made to be America's team, we were made to be Pittsburgh's team. And no matter how much people may disdain us for it, it will never change the fact that the Steelers are the Steelers."

Most memorable moment, other than this, was that the stadium basically turned into a Steeler's stadium when all the Cleveland fans left. As Cleveland was driving down to break the shut out, the place was going nuts, and came unglued after they knew the shutout would hold.   Also, a shitfaced Santa Clause told me and my eight year old (at the time) brother that if ""you don't turn your jersey's inside out Ima fucking kill you"".

Combined with the fact that were the only rust belt city that has been consistently good with the exception of the mid to late 80s, and you can see why our fanbase is so big. Born in Pittsburgh, moved to Atlanta when I was a teen in the late 90s. Atlanta has more Steelers fans than any other team except the Falcons, and even then we are close to em. I went to the game here in Atlanta last year, it was about 60% Steelers fans id say."

steelers,3ck2oe,steelbydesign,2,Wed Jul 8 15:02:02 2015 UTC,"As a Clemson fan, no thanks. The guy has been average at best; looks the part, but his technique needs some serious work. And that's not even mentioning the massive character red flags that are pushing him into the supplemental draft in the first place. Giving up a 3rd next year for him would be a huge mistake. I'm not sure what makes gambling on him now a better move than drafting a better guy higher next year, and that's all assuming we don't retain Beachum in the first place."
steelers,3ck2oe,UnicornFondler,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:41:44 2015 UTC,Clemson fan here. Definitely some character flaws. Didn't he punch someone in the face on the field?
steelers,3ck2oe,AnalBravado,3,Wed Jul 8 17:10:51 2015 UTC,Yep. Also the reason he declared for the supplemental draft is he failed a drug test for the third time and Clemson was going to kick him off the team otherwise.

Keisel is a fan favorite, and a better pass rusher, so he jumped off the screen more, but Heyward deserves to be on that team. He's by far the best in our front 7 right now."

steelers,3cgbcv,russbii,7,Wed Jul 8 11:22:59 2015 UTC,Peezy at ILB? I think you gotta put Levon Kirkland there instead of playing someone out of position.
steelers,3cgbcv,steelflapjack,14,Tue Jul 7 18:49:22 2015 UTC,I'd put Timmons in that spot.
steelers,3cgbcv,russbii,3,Wed Jul 8 00:46:46 2015 UTC,That's the only other player that's acceptable. Kirkland was a big thumper with speed. He covered the underneath routes well and he punished runners in between the box.  He's the consummate plugger. Perfect behind that line.
steelers,3cgbcv,smacksaw,2,Wed Jul 8 01:19:18 2015 UTC,Kirkland was too limited. He's not even our 5th-best LB at any position. He may not even be 8th. Kevin Greene should have been on there.

steelers,3cgbcv,MattEven,3,Wed Jul 8 00:43:11 2015 UTC,I would replace Potsie with Levon Kirkland.  I think he's one of the most under -appreciated linebackers in Steelers history.  Greg Lloyd doesn't make this list without him.

steelers,3cgbcv,russbii,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:36:41 2015 UTC,"It's an opinion.  You've given me a list of things, which is nice.  But I watched both  play and I believe Levon Kirkland was the better inside linebacker.  And that's not to denigrate Potsie because he was also a great linebacker.  Levon was fast, talented, gritty, and an absolute behemoth.  Like Potsie, he was a lunch bucket kinda guy, didn't get into a whole lotta showboating, just crushed people and jogged off the field.  And I have never seen a linebacker who could destroy offensive linemen like he could.  That's where I give the edge to Levon; his size gave him unique capabilities and he opened things up for everybody around him.  I do like the list you posted, it's nice to encapsulate the encomiums.  ( sorry, couldn't help myself) posting from vaca, my apologies for the delayed reply. (I'm not Canadian but I try....)."
steelers,3cgbcv,MattEven,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:05:21 2015 UTC,I watched Kirkland play too. He was a great Linebacker in his prime and had pretty good hands too but I would still take Porter over him anyday. Joey just wasn't just a QB's nightmare but a vocal leader in the locker room and on the field. Peezy walking up and down the 50 yard line during warm ups with his jersey hiked up just intimidating the hell out of the opposing team. I like a guy that throws in a little psych warfare into the mix. If he got inside their heads early he knew they had already lost the game.

steelers,3cgbcv,russbii,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:54:42 2015 UTC,It's funny because I actually do want to replace Porter with Farrior. Playing Peezy out of position seems like a bad idea.
steelers,3cgbcv,Questfor7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:57:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this list isn't so much about proper positioning as it is here's the best of the best from the modern era. Farrior has two rings and he was a big part of why they won those titles. He was also a vocal leader especially after Porter left. If you remember Kirkland didn't do shit in Seattle or Philly and his last year in Pittsburgh was less than stellar. I loved Kirkland in his heyday in Pittsburgh but I would not put him in over James. Farrior also had a 14 year career."
steelers,3cgbcv,Traderious,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:15:02 2015 UTC,I'm saying start Farrior and Kirkland inside...  I wanna sit Joey Porter. He's the top backup at his position. I'd even take Lloyd off the field and play Peezy (55) on passing downs because he's way better in coverage than Lloyd ever was.

steelers,3chlav,amnesiajune,5,Tue Jul 7 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"I bought a bumblebee bell jersey from aliexpress, which i'm completely satisfied with. I haven't compared it side by side a legit one. I'd imagine i'd be able to find some differences if I did, but it's pretty damn solid.   Any vendor with lots of positive reviews is a pretty safe bet, and they have pretty solid buyer protection if you aren't satisfied.  Brown or Bell are probably the safest choices. Heath is also a fan favorite, though not as young or flashy. Lot's of people are expecting Martavis Bryant to have a break out year, and his jersey will likely become more and more popular as the year goes on.  Even though he retired, Polamalu is an excellent choice. as /u/steelflapjack said, his jersey will never go out of style."
steelers,3chlav,spooTOO,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:32:05 2015 UTC,"Heath is another excellent choice, definitely beloved by the fan base.  A bumblebee Jerome Bettis might be neat also since he gets into the hall of fame this year, 4-5 weeks from now.  I don't think he played in the bumblebee throwback era so it won't be something a lot of people have."
steelers,3chlav,steelflapjack,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:10:05 2015 UTC,"Even though he retired, Polamalu is an excellent choice.    Agreed, even better BECAUSE he is retired."
steelers,3chlav,justacincinnatiguy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:07:56 2015 UTC,I'm sure you could still get a Polamalu jersey from a place like that.  Since he retired a Steeler and will almost certainly make the hall of fame it will never go out of style.  James Harrison or Hines Ward probably fall into that same category too.  I wouldn't get them a duplicate of a jersey they already have though.
steelers,3chlav,steelflapjack,2,Wed Jul 8 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"Question for you:  I'm confused.  You said ""favourite"" so are you British?  I only ask because if you are, Pats seem to be an odd team to be a fan of.  I'll echo everyone and say aliexpress.  Just look for good ratings.  Some people have had an issue with the bumblebees being stiff, but there's ways to fix that.  And it's always a safe bet to get a retired player because they'll always be a Steeler.  Your instinct with Troy was a good one.  James Harrison and Brett Keisel are good ones too.    Now, me, I have a Brown and a Bell jersey, but I'm afraid we won't be able to afford to keep them some day.  TL/DR:  Get a retired player off of a seller with good ratings on aliexpress."

steelers,3chlav,TCpls,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:43:54 2015 UTC,Polomalu jersey out of respect for his career spent here with the steelers. He's an idol to many of us and he's a legend to the entire NFL no matter what they say about him.
steelers,3cezru,Myburgher,21,Tue Jul 7 11:53:45 2015 UTC,"It's still fairly early to say, but so far Emmanuel Sanders has been phenomenal after leaving Pittsburgh.   As a Steeler he was mediocre about 2-3 on the depth chart (based on when Wallace left and our team having a severe lack of depth/talent at the WR position at the time ) and had a lot of games where he would drop balls we really needed him to catch. After he arrived at Denver though he has exploded for whatever reason and has certainly helped my fantasy teams win a few times.   Denver gave him a better deal and we can't really shit on him for taking it, especially with the results so far. He plays much better ball with Peyton compared to Roethlisberger and has stated that Peyton is a better leader to him (though this could just be bitterness for all we know). I really have no ill will towards the guy and hope he has a long and successful career.   Unless he's playing us that is... if that's the case? fuck him!"
steelers,3cezru,Verksus67,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:02:14 2015 UTC,"Cool beans. I'm actually stoked for him. Always thought he was good for it, and understood when he left. Also managed to be a great fantasy sleeper (along with Bryant - sometimes being a homer pays off)"

I know a lot of people dont like posting themselves on here, but maybe we could incorporate some kind of pride theme. Have you been to the hof? Share and lets see. You the only guy/gal in steelers gear surrounded by another team's fans? Taking a road trip? Lets see a terrible towel waving around a monument. Maybe your family has a few generations of Steelers fans. Whats that like and whats it mean to you? Ever get into a fight over the Steelers?

steelers,3cbk3b,OnePoint21Jigowatts,2,Mon Jul 6 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"I think something like that is a good idea, over the Throwback Thursday idea.  My initial idea with that was a spot for people to talk about old games they remember, former players that they were huge fans of etc, but a more general post about pride in the team, would probably bring about more discussion.  It could still fit my initial idea, but also provide a spot for discussion on all the things you talked about.  I will probably go with that over the throwback idea, but need a to think of a more all encompassing name, that gets the point across better.  Maybe something like General Fandom Thursday with a short explanation as the body of the post."
steelers,3cbk3b,WildBananna,3,Mon Jul 6 18:32:36 2015 UTC,"General fandom, sounds good to meðð. I think that definately covers what I threw out there. I always enjoy reading and seeing how people show their pride. It especially fascinates me to see just how big Steelers Nation is across the states and the world. I was reading a story somewhere, cant remember now, but it was about Steelers fans in Mexico.

steelers,3c2016,DruTangClan,19,Sat Jul 4 00:51:06 2015 UTC,I think Shamarko has a great shot. He's got a great attitude and seems to have a knack for being around the ball. Also i think Cam Heywood will be the staple of a defense for sometime. That guy is the greatest
steelers,3c2016,steelcurtain87,8,Sat Jul 4 00:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree that Heyward is/will be a solid leader of the defense for some time, and I'm hoping Shamarko's time training with Troy pays off, it would be great if he could inject some fear factor back into the Steelers' secondary."
steelers,3c2016,weizhong5,18,Sat Jul 4 01:07:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on Shazier, I hope that his bulking up and rest from the injury will return him to his beastly preseason form of last year.  However, I can't help but think that Cortez Allen's breakout would actually be the most helpful for the team. Our secondary is awful, and a direct boost to them through stronger secondary play would be great to see. I know pass rush helps mask a secondary's faults (the old LeBeau school of thought), but honestly, they can only do so much to hide a problem if it's as deep as ours."
steelers,3c2016,huet99,2,Sat Jul 4 02:42:05 2015 UTC,"Yea that's true, and we have at least some playmakers in the linebacking core (like Timmons) and a decent d-line so it would be nice to get a playmaker in the secondary.  It would be sweet if Golson or Grant could make an impact but I try not to get my hopes up too much for rookies, at least until the actual season starts."
steelers,3c2016,Tall_lankybaldguy,9,Sat Jul 4 02:58:30 2015 UTC,"I've been reading a lot about our sixth round pick Leterrius Walton and almost seeing positive things across the board. Scouts say he improved every year and is explosive and will be good against the run. Seems like a really good pick.    If anyone is interested, here is his scouting profile: http://www.nfl.com/draft/2015/profiles/leterrius-walton?id=2552444    Edit: Oh, and I am also really excited about Stephon Tuitt. He was supposed to be a first round pick and looked really good last year."
steelers,3c2016,Tall_lankybaldguy,3,Sat Jul 4 05:17:33 2015 UTC,Agreed on both fronts. I never heard Walton's name or saw any game tape about him prior to being drafted. Everything I've learned since then seems to have enormous upside.   Tuitt was great as a rookie and I think he will only get better
steelers,3c2016,tolas,6,Sat Jul 4 07:26:37 2015 UTC,I've been eager for Shamarko to get consistent playing time since we drafted him a few years ago. I think this is his year.
steelers,3c2016,ajk5376,6,Sat Jul 4 02:19:09 2015 UTC,Ryan Shazier will make the pro-bowl.  Bud Dupree will surprise a lot of people with how quick he contributes.  5+ sacks for him.
steelers,3c2016,kenzington86,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:33:39 2015 UTC,"Id love to see Dupree get some sacks, but think his early impact will be felt most in the run game and his ability to drop into coverage.  Having experience dropping combined with the freakish speed should hopefully make for a smoother transition.  I'm hesitant to predict pass rushing success right away. I think it may take some time for him to improve on his handwork and development the war chest of moves.   I also think moates is very underrated and wouldn't be surprised for him to hold the spot for 85+% of the snaps this season.  I'll be happy if Dupree can get 4 sacks (with the assumption he's limited to a rotational and situational role).  Very excited to see what comes of the training camp competition at LOLB."
steelers,3c2016,huet99,10,Mon Jul 6 22:18:04 2015 UTC,"Most likely for next year is Jarvis Jones.  He started last season well, and I think his regression after the injury was a lingering pain and lack of strength in that hand that hurt his technique.  With a full offseason to recover he should be back near 100%, and while working out with Harrison is great the real difference will be from learning technique from Porter (who can actually devote all his time to teaching, since he's a coach).  I think he gets to double digit sacks next year, especially cleaning up QBs that get flushed as Heyward, McLendon, and Tuitt are given more opportunities to attack from the inside."
steelers,3c2016,tahmoose,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:08:24 2015 UTC,"He started last season well for Jarvis Jones. He still looked like an average pass rusher, both of his sacks were uncontested and I remember him still not being able to get past any tackles."
steelers,3c2016,zdonabedian,3,Sun Jul 5 02:07:45 2015 UTC,I could see Mike Mitchell having a decent year as well if his groin injury was large factor last year.

steelers,3c2016,BTCru,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"If Shamarko Shazier and Jarvis all do well, we could easily be a top 10 defense. Add Tuitt and some of our rookie corners panning out, we could be scary good."
steelers,3c2016,GiveMeMOBeer,2,Sun Jul 5 18:52:18 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say Antwon Blake, even though it won't be ""breaking out"" in the fashion of Antonio Brown or LeVeon Bell in previous years. I just have a feeling that this is going to be a good year for him. He's already one of the best athletes in the secondary. I think this is the year he combines playbook/on-field knowledge with his athleticism."

From LU, and might not even make the 53, but apparently he is making a name for himself in practice and has intercepted Ben a few times.   Apparently Coach Tomlin gave him a nick-name (two-G) and he has respect thus far.   Wishful thinking but I always root for the lesser known guys. It would be awesome to have a CB that can really play come out of nowhere."

steelers,3c2016,Jack_Lambert,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:34:45 2015 UTC,"I can't pick just one - or even just two. I feel like this is the year for Jarvis Jones, Ryan Shazier, Shamarko Thomas, Daniel McCullers, and Stephon Tuitt.  All of them seem equally likely to make a huge impact in 2015 compared to their mostly-limited contributions in 2014. I would include Martavis Bryant on this list, but I'd say he's not a ""break out"" as much as he'll continue to do what he did for the second half of last season.  The sleeper pick for me is Golson. DB's tend to struggle their first year in the NFL, but I could see him breaking out late in the season. Dupree, Holliman, Golson, and Coates could surprise us too.  I know some of you didn't, but I REALLY liked this years draft. Not a dud in the bunch IMO."
steelers,3c2016,ajk5376,2,Mon Jul 6 13:11:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, I actually really liked this years draft as well. Also yea I really hope McCullers pans out I was really excited when they picked him up last year, he's so big if he improved his game he could be a monster"

steelers,3bwi6y,Craaaig_,11,Thu Jul 2 23:11:42 2015 UTC,Well our #1 defense for all of those years helped.
steelers,3bwi6y,KanyeWest_GayFish,2,Fri Jul 3 00:34:44 2015 UTC,"Our defense was good through the 90s too, but look what happens when you go from O'Donnell and Stewart to a hall of fame caliber QB.   Yes, Ben doesn't win championships without a top defense, but there's only a handful of QBs over the last couple decades that complete that pass to Santonio with the game on the line or take a team to the Super Bowl from a wildcard slot. All of those QBs will likely be in the HoF."
steelers,3bwi6y,tonytroz,2,Fri Jul 3 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"Oh I certainly agree with that, but saying that he saved the team isn't really true from 2004-2007 especially"

steelers,3bwi6y,Craaaig_,9,Fri Jul 3 03:25:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't believe Ben will ever receive the right amount of credit he deserves for what he does year after year. When they don't make the playoffs, it's Ben fault when they do they give credit to other players like they did with Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell last season. Of course those two were incredible, but Ben was the one being overlooked. As Steeler fans, we should be used to it."
steelers,3bwi6y,JBProds,3,Thu Jul 2 22:26:12 2015 UTC,30 years from now there will be a Big Ben documentary and people will finally realize he was actually a good QB.
steelers,3bwi6y,po_ta_to,2,Thu Jul 2 23:50:44 2015 UTC,"I can totally see it & that's sad. Maybe not 30, but there will probably be a 30 for 30 a few years after his retirement focusing on him coming into the Ravens game & then going undefeated during the regular season, being the youngest Super Bowl winner ever, being arguably the toughest QB to tackle, the accusations and then ____ amount of Super Bowls he wins when he's finished."
steelers,3bwi6y,JBProds,3,Fri Jul 3 00:08:12 2015 UTC,"Didn't he just sign a 6 year contract worth $108 million, with over $60 million guaranteed?  You can't always control what other people think of you, but it seems like the Steelers just gave him plenty of credit for a job well done."
steelers,3bwi6y,el_capitan_obvio,2,Fri Jul 3 17:57:25 2015 UTC,The organization and fans definitely know what we have in Big Ben. I think the fans just wish the sports networks would give him proper recognition.
steelers,3bwi6y,el_capitan_obvio,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:41:58 2015 UTC,"People from my parents' generation feel the same way about Bradshaw. Despite being a 4-time Super Bowl champion, he wasn't really seen as one of the greats until after he retired. When a guy is a winner - but wins without the big stats - then people begin to shift credit away from him directly and give it to the team/organization. It's a catch-22. But you're right - the team and the fans know he's one of the main reasons we've been legit contenders the entire time he's been on the roster."
steelers,3bwi6y,Blawdfire,4,Mon Jul 6 15:13:39 2015 UTC,"I get that and I agree, but I legitimately had someone telling me how bad Ben's been over the past few years.

People seem to need to realize how flawed this list of players picking players is. Its a popularity contest at heart. Eddie Lacy and Shady all did poorly and yet ones almost as high as Ben and the other broke well through the top 100. I can go on. While i smile that we may finally have a player that has gotten to the top ten of this - I turn and look around at all the players missing on this list. Almost first offense and we got how many offensive guys on here?
steelers,3btoq0,ThatDriftingPixel,2,Thu Jul 2 19:58:37 2015 UTC,Who would you argue is missing?
steelers,3btoq0,ShaquilleO_feel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:09:25 2015 UTC,"Admittedly I havent made sure who is and isn't on this TOP 100 but DeCastro, Pouncey, and Beachum.  If they are on the list they should be higher then where they were being they helped create the top Passing Yard QB, 2nd Rushing Yard RB and helped assist Ben in making Brown get the numbers when he was doing his thing.  Probably put Pouncey a hair above DeCastro but nevertheless as a great running and passing team you need an o-line and while ours aren't big salary names they rivaled with some of the best this season.  For the first time ever - with a healthy line - I can say the woes of an O-Line are finally gone."
steelers,3btoq0,ThatDriftingPixel,3,Fri Jul 3 05:46:24 2015 UTC,"These kinds of things are harsh on O-Linemen because it's hard to pinpoint particular examples of great play, plus, there aren't any big stats to look at (aside from maybe sacks allowed). O-Linemen aren't in the limelight enough for them to be well known by players, and it's not like coordinators write plays to counter them. All of that hurts their standing in something like this.  I believe Pouncey was something in the 80s though, which is respectable for a Center."
steelers,3btoq0,weizhong5,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:14:27 2015 UTC,I agree - but as someone who used to play organized Football I always talked about Lines when describing how good a team's offense or defense was and where the weak points lie for the other side to take advantage of.   Where Im going with this is - I'd think O-Linemen would jump out a little more to players on field then people watching.  Meaning even in a popularity contest - like this one - a really great O-Linemen would stand out.
steelers,3btoq0,ThatDriftingPixel,2,Fri Jul 3 23:50:29 2015 UTC,I disagree that he should have been above Charles who was ranked #12. I think he'll solidify his spot as the second best RB in the league this year. Lynch is going to come down a bit once people stop underrating Wilson
steelers,3btoq0,9000watts,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"Charles should of gotten the love he got, but I don't think he should of been placed ahead for a few reasons.  Charles while having a better average with 5.0 per rush over Bell's 4.3 - Charles fumbled three times with less rush yards and less carries to Bell's 1.  To me that's substantial in ranking a RB - his Turnover ratio to his production.  Turnovers kill.    Bell's production in the air game is way past Jamaal's with almost a 500 yard gap between the two.   Charles arguably got so much attention due to the fact that the Chiefs didn't have WR's at all.    Bell sits behind Brown in these rankings with a distant Ben who is a whole other argument in itself."
steelers,3btoq0,ThatDriftingPixel,12,Sat Jul 4 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Not bad for his breakout season. He obviously wouldn't be ahead of Murray due to the numbers in rushing, but he's far more valuable of a team player."

I rank him as the 3rd best on our team alone, behind Big Ben and AB. Add on top of them the obvious guys like Aaron Rodgers and JJ Watt."
steelers,3btoq0,DKnight32x,5,Thu Jul 2 04:06:33 2015 UTC,"No. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy, but I can't argue him being better than JJ Watt, Aaron Rodgers, Justin Houston, Antonio, or Earl Thomas."
steelers,3btoq0,CeeBeast,6,Thu Jul 2 04:04:40 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how you look at it.  This is a popularity contest not an assessment of football skills.  But if you were to look at biggest impact to a team, then I say he is better than any defensive player period.  Really you could put 10 QBs 1-10 if you wanted followed by top RBs, and WRs before you hit major defensive impacts like Sherman, Watt and Thomas.  I guess in my head I abbreviate that and kind of compare relative to other at the same position, what is their impact.  Then obviously impact of position plays into it too.  Id probably rattle off the top 2 or 3 QBs then top RB and WRs. And he be in around the 4-7 range:  Rodgers Brady Manning RB1 WR1 RB2 WR2 More QBs That puts him at 4 or 6  The best way I think to really judge it would be:  how much does the point spread move if this guy is out of the game?  After QBs. Bell is damn near the top of that list."

There's some small part of me that just can't get past the fact that football is a team game, and AB is AB in very large part because of the teammates he has around him, the coaches he plays for, the owners and general manager, and a host of other factors that go into providing him the opportunity he has to shine.   His stats are the way they are in large part because he has a QB who believes in him, and more importantly, is in sync with him about how to make reads.  He could go to a different team, be used differently by other coaches, have a QB who may be statistically better than Ben but who just doesn't develop a relationship with, and his performance could tank.   These lists seem to miss all of that, and it depresses me for some reason."
steelers,3buq8g,kingpatzer,8,Thu Jul 2 13:54:49 2015 UTC,It's not even just that. There's no real indication what they're basing the top 100 off of. Is it last year's stats? Is it projected for this year? Is it some combination? Are you going by pure talent or by wins or by yardage etc. It's just a bunch of people in a room going alright lets rank some people objectively and they did. It's a fun list to look at and discuss but there's no actual merit to it so don't worry too much about it.
steelers,3buq8g,axxl75,3,Thu Jul 2 15:13:24 2015 UTC,Exactly.  That stupid list lost all credibility with me when they ranked Ben at 26.  At that point I just felt it was a popularity contest.

I really don't think Ben helped Antonio Brown pin the ball against his helmet, catch the ball on his toes at the back of the end zone, or juke 6 people on a swing pass to win the AFC North title. AB is great, and yes obviously having a QB helps, but it works both ways."
steelers,3buq8g,huet99,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:24:25 2015 UTC,"about no one would say ""it's the teammates around him""   Then they would be equally ignorant.

steelers,3buq8g,kingpatzer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding my point. Yes, a lot of the productivity of both players is because of the players around them, but they are both remarkable players, and still would be great no matter who surrounds them. Obviously throwing 500 yards would be a stretch, but they are both independently amazing players, regardless of who they share the field with."
steelers,3buq8g,huet99,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:08:17 2015 UTC,"My point is a lot of (potentially) exceptional players never are seen as exceptional because of the team around them. And a lot of performing players change teams and proceed to disappear, or non-performers make a move and blossom in a new system. Hell, look at Harrison as example, or how many of our star players have moved on and disappeared.    Anyone trying to evaluate a player without considering the team around them is simply engaged in a futile task.  Many a remarkable player has failed to be great because of who surrounded them."
steelers,3buq8g,kingpatzer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"James Harrison was scheme more than anything, combined with age. I agree with a lot of your saying, I just object to questioning how great a player is because of the team around him. It just seems wrong to do to a player so fun to watch that has given Pittsburgh something to get excited about. Conversely, if AB wasn't on our offense, we wouldn't have a good offense."
steelers,3buq8g,huet99,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:18:38 2015 UTC,"Carson Palmer never had an interception rate above 4.2% at Cinci. He went to Oakland and at 4.9% was knocking on the door for worst QB in the league that year.   He then went to Arizona, and his INT% dropped to 1.3% last year, among the best in the league.   Good players are good because scheme, coaching, and players around them elevate them. You don't get to the NFL unless you are among the best athletes in the world at this game. But it is the fit with the team that determines how well the players actually perform."
steelers,3buq8g,kingpatzer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"They are components of creating a good player. But you can see with AB's hands, elusiveness, route running, and quickness that he is clearly one of the best receivers in the game. Do you just never acknowledge player greatness then?

steelers,3brftj,sweatytacos,2,Wed Jul 1 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"it's hard to disagree with now but I think in a few years down the line it would be hard to argue for anyone other than Bell. He's just too talented, he just needs a couple years under his belt to solidify the argument."
steelers,3brftj,King0fTheImpossible,2,Wed Jul 1 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"If we're talking ""in their prime"", Willie P should be in the conversation. He didn't have a spectacular career, but he played a huge role in getting to and winning SB XL."
steelers,3brftj,klubsanwich,4,Wed Jul 1 18:31:14 2015 UTC,I've got a soft spot for Willie.
steelers,3brftj,IdunnoLXG,2,Wed Jul 1 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"Parker was wildly inconsistent. He had a knack for breaking out with the ""big"" runs that Cower loved so much. I think he wasn't that great, Bell I think is much better, but he will forever be remembered in Steeler Nation for that 70 yard TD run against the Seahawks.   Once Willie got in the secondary, on the rare occasions that he did, he was gone."

steelers,3bp9rn,Kodyak77,2,Wed Jul 1 01:57:41 2015 UTC,Ahh ok thanks! I really hope they can fix that because he has a lot of potential otherwise
steelers,3bp9rn,SteelHurtin56,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:28:44 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, he can hit as hard as anybody.  It's just his tackling that needs work.  He's big and physical enough, he just needs to learn to get guys on the ground."
steelers,3bp9rn,Drakengard,0,Thu Jul 2 18:24:09 2015 UTC,"Even so, you'd think someone would have taken him before the 7th round.  Not that I'm complaining or anything."
steelers,3bp9rn,Goldenface15,11,Sat Jul 4 02:43:21 2015 UTC,"I've never seen anything but highlights, but from what I've heard, he is an absolutely terrible tackler that will take lots of work to fix, if it's even fixable. I hope he can get it worked out but if we look at it realistically, a tackling problem so detrimental that it dropped a player with his accolades down to the 7th round will be hard to fix."
steelers,3bp9rn,jfuss04,3,Wed Jul 1 02:06:25 2015 UTC,I read he was a good punishing tackler before his shoulder injury
steelers,3bp9rn,1htaehn,5,Wed Jul 1 03:49:45 2015 UTC,Correct. He's kept away from that shoulder making big hits since the injury -- so he knows how to tackle. He just needs to be comfortable doing it again.
steelers,3bp9rn,DriArcher,9,Wed Jul 1 14:22:01 2015 UTC,"What these guys said, tackling. It will 100% stop him from playing so I think he'll get it together"

steelers,3bp9rn,Goldenface15,3,Wed Jul 1 14:27:00 2015 UTC,"If its the tackling that dropped his value, I wonder what made his stock drop in the offseason."
steelers,3bp9rn,heavymedicine,2,Thu Jul 2 02:21:51 2015 UTC,"I read yesterday, he want's to start this YEAR! I admire his passion and hope he ends up making the 53 man roster. Not sure he is going to be able to beat (Tomlin's boy) Will Allen."
steelers,3bp9rn,rhino43grr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"He hurt his shoulder and has kind of avoided contact on that side since he came back from the injury. It's hard to tackle when you're worrying about not using one side of your body, so he looked like a terrible tackler who was scared of contact.  I think if they can get him over the shoulder injury mentally they could have a steal. The problem with that is that until he's mentally ready to trust that shoulder, he's not going to be able to be trusted as a special teams contributor either."

steelers,3bntby,Kleefo,6,Wed Jul 1 02:06:16 2015 UTC,"I'd still prefer this over him/other rookies not saying this.   Besides, he was actually a pretty solid tackler before his shoulder injury (and was projected to go in the first round back in January), so I definitely think he could get reaccustomed to tackling.   Overall, I can definitely see him having a Beachum-esque upside, especially if he goes all out after that starting position."
steelers,3bmwx0,thursdaynext1,7,Tue Jun 30 14:42:09 2015 UTC,So 3rd in AFC.
steelers,3bmwx0,King0fTheImpossible,2,Tue Jun 30 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they made an error in their title (which I dutifully copied). Here's the full ranking, which I was able to see on ESPN's UK site without Insider subscription:"
steelers,3bmwx0,Brutuss,8,Tue Jun 30 17:28:15 2015 UTC,The Patriots seem pretty high considering Brady is going to turn 38 in a month - they think he's gonna tear up the league at 41?  Other than that I don't really get worked up over stuff like this. It's all in good fun.

steelers,3bmw4r,IdunnoLXG,5,Tue Jun 30 17:10:09 2015 UTC,"Troy did suck this year, no denying it. However Mitchell also didn't do a good job of covering and always wanted to ""hit stick"" instead of breaking up plays and wrapping up tackles."
steelers,3bmw4r,MattEven,4,Tue Jun 30 17:16:05 2015 UTC,You mean the exact same thing Ryan Clark used to do but was praised for it? I have a feeling Steelers nation will be eating their words come September on Mitchell.
steelers,3bmw4r,IdunnoLXG,3,Tue Jun 30 17:24:05 2015 UTC,I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt last year because of the injury he played through and Troy's mistakes. This is his redemption year and he won't get another chance.

steelers,3bedst,DriArcher,5,Sun Jun 28 19:07:51 2015 UTC,Cortez Allen did a great job covering him.  He is big enough that he isn't a complete mismatch.  I'm pulling for Cortez to recover from an off year and play well this year.

I really couldn't believe how bad he was last season. Hopefully just a down year mentally because an injured Ike Taylor was better last season.  With that being said, I think Allen will have to defend the 6'3 210 lbs Brandon LaFell. I leaning towards Shazier defending him although he can't do it by himself. I guess that leaves Gay to defend Edelman or maybe Golson if he shows enough in training camp & preseason."

Women are already equal legally, tangibly in some ways, behind in others, and men are behind in some others. It's not a simple issue."

I'm talking about in the U.S. of course. White women have achieved and surpassed equality with men.   In other countries it's truly awful how women are treated and it needs to change. You think the entitled white women of this country care though? No, they'd rather keep bitching about how awful they have it. Sickening. Grow up ladies."

steelers,3b1xs1,rhino43grr,6,Thu Jun 25 17:28:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it's more a situation where Ben may be being underrated as opposed to Wilson being overrated.  Wilson is one of the better QBs in the league and he isn't even in his prime yet.  If you are considering age as a factor in such a ranking, I think Wilson should be above Ben.  Assuming they aren't, I don't think he should be, but I think they'd both be really close, so why nitpick over 4 places?"

Sure Ben has the stats but at the end of the day it's who wins Super Bowls and Russel has won recently where as Ben hasn't won since 2008.  Matthew Stafford also has the stats, his 2011 season was phenomenal but you know what, he didn't win anything."
steelers,3b1xs1,Deckz,0,Thu Jun 25 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"Matthew Stafford hasn't won anything, so don't compare him to Ben, Ben is a clutch proven winner who made arguably the best game winning drive in Superbowl history a reality. I'd bet you anything that Russel Wilson will not have as many career wins as big ben in his 11th year. Ben has been to three super bowls and won 2, Russ won one and lost one. Once salary cap issues rear their head, that team will no longer be dominant. 6-7 years from some other young kid will be exciting on another team and people will underrate Wilson because he hasn't been to a sb in a few years. And let's be clear, ben flat out out played Wilson last year, not even a contest. Wilson's team was better, maybe not on offense, but that defense gave him plenty of chances which turned out to be even more valuable than our prolific offense."

He never struck me as a GREAT running back, and certainly not HOF worthy.   Not trying to troll, I'm just genuinely curious what you guys think as football fans, not Steeler fans. I can't wrap my head around it."
steelers,3azkn0,BmoreStyles,10,Thu Jun 25 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"Fourth in career touches, sixth in yards and tenth in TDs; those should be HoF numbers.  He also rarely dropped the pill and rarely got injured, add to that a sunny and fan-friendly disposition.  When you combine that with the numbers above you get a once-in-a-lifetime RB."
steelers,3azkn0,ericfg,-6,Thu Jun 25 01:24:15 2015 UTC,"But I see his numbers of touches and longevity of career to be a huge contributor in those stats. He collected solid stats throughout a long career. I don't see the greatness of a Hall of Famer. Out of 13 seasons, he only finished in top 5 for rushing three times."
steelers,3azkn0,BmoreStyles,5,Thu Jun 25 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"He has the stats and longevity, but it was his style that got him in."

He was an icon in terms of running style.  No running back has ever had his size and footwork.   In terms of breakaway run plays, bettis didn't have that.  But he had an automatic 3 yards plus no matter what."

steelers,3azkn0,jrile,0,Thu Jun 25 03:37:20 2015 UTC,"The same reasons that everyone says who opposes him being in the Hall....  â¢ Out of 13 seasons, he only finished in top 5 for rushing three times.   â¢ Most TDs scored in a season 13... Good, but not Hall of Fame  â¢ Only 2 seasons over 10 TDs  â¢ He collected solid stats over a very long career.  I think he was a very good player, but not Hall of Fame."
steelers,3azkn0,BmoreStyles,3,Thu Jun 25 04:18:41 2015 UTC,"You have to watch players, not just evaluate their stats. Numbers aren't everything, he made everyone on the offense better because he wore opposing defenses down. He closed games like no other running back, and there's evidence in the history books. He made Brian Urlacher look like a meek chump on the football field with his physicality. He was beyond tough, and was a great leader. Bringing up a bunch of stats makes me think you never watched him, ever. Plus, his stats are good enough. The great thing about Jerome is he NEVER went backwards, rarely did you ever see him lose yards. I never once saw him get pushed back, he's tougher than any back in the league today by miles."
steelers,3azkn0,Deckz,3,Thu Jun 25 09:39:07 2015 UTC,"Urlacher was in his prime at the time if I recall, Bettis was in the 13th year of his career. Shit like that makes him a hall of famer too, not just stats."
steelers,3azkn0,snookyface90210,-1,Thu Jun 25 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"Obviously I agree that numbers aren't everything, but they're the best way to compare players, and while I look at his stats I see a very good player who put up solid, but not great numbers, for a very long time.   People point to his number of carries... I'm not sure how that stat is reflective of any greatness. Durability? Absolutely, but doesn't mean you were great. 6th in yards for running backs seems GREAT, but then you realize that he averaged below 4 yards a carry for his career, which suggests that he wasn't great, but rather solid over a long period. Same goes for 10th in TDs, he only had 2 seasons with 10 or more TDs, which is far from great.   I think there's a very legit argument for those that don't think he should have made it, they're not just trolling Ravens fans. I objectively think his character and longevity were the biggest reasons he was considered for the Hall."
steelers,3azkn0,BmoreStyles,2,Thu Jun 25 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of players don't make it in to the HOF because they never had long careers, even though they were fantastic. Bo Jackson comes to mind.  Did you ever watch him play?"
steelers,3azkn0,jrile,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:12:04 2015 UTC,"That's a point I'm willing to concede, that if you want to say his longevity and durability is why he's in the Hall, I can somewhat accept the reasoning behind it. But as I've explained, his longevity hurts his stats some... He finished 6th in yards for RBs, but averaged below 4 yards a carry. That screams, mediocre production over a very long career (at least in terms of yards). Below 4 yards a carry is not HOF worthy. And same story with his 10th in career TDs... He only scored more than 10 TDs twice in his career... Again, not a great stat. But what he did do was put up solid stats for an extraordinarily long career.  I think objectively speaking, there's some strong points to be made against Bettis getting in. There were more than plenty of people who opposed him making it, and they weren't just Ravens fans."
steelers,3azkn0,BmoreStyles,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"Okay, valid point. But those numbers don't tell the whole story. I take it you have not watched Bettis play.  Also, I'm sure there are other RBs in the HOF with 3.9 y/c."
steelers,3azkn0,jrile,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"There's only one other RB in the HOF who averaged below 4 yards a carry... John Riggins. Who was the original nimble footed big back.  However, Riggins played in 17 fewer games, had over 1400 less carries (a lot less!!!!). Bettis outgained him by about 2300 yards, but only because he had 1400 more carries. That being said, I'd also have a problem with Riggins getting in if he made it today, however, he was the real first nimble, big back, so there's some intangible element that I feel people wrongfully place value toward. The same way they do for Bettis, even though he wasn't technically the first of his kind, I understand why some fans try to claim that. I'm not some blindly bias troll just hating on the guy because he was a Steeler, I'm a football fan, I just don't see GREATNESS which the Hall is supposed to be reserved for. I kindly agree to disagree."
steelers,3azkn0,BmoreStyles,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"Guy go watch some of his games. Stats are half the story. His play style for his size was the most impressive thing about him. He floated vertically and horizontally down the field like a man half his size. NOT TO MENTION if he wanted to he would just barrel down the centre and carry 2-3 LBs with him. His stats over as long a career as a RB could have plus his size durability and style, throw in his ever positive team first attitude and leadership and you have a HOF career"
steelers,3azkn0,jolly_peno,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:26:18 2015 UTC,"Terrible music aside, watch this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umdlrLMvfU0  Watch as he runs through multiple defenders, pay attention to how big he is and how quick he can change routes and move his feet, watch how many people try to strip the ball from him and it doesn't hardly budge. Sure this is just a highlight reel but he played like this every game. These highlights became what was expected of him every game, and he delivered far more often than not.  You don't see many backs, especially at his size, that show this level of athleticism and finesse. Combine this with his stats and character and you're hard pressed to find anyone comparable."

The fact that he's handing it off to Bell and throwing it to Brown probably mitigates his ranking given that niether of them have shown up on the list yet."

The league is filled with hogwash from Rodger-lovers and Brady Boys. Bet you there will be a good amount of QB's on the list higher but you know what? I don't care because I know what he did and he did more for the franchise then most of these QB's did for theirs.

The company I work for has a shutterstock account, so I was able to find a whiskey bottle to my liking.    He's been posting a bunch of crazy obscure whiskey on Instagram so I figured, hmm Steel Curtain sounds like a cool whiskey name so that's where I came up with this idea/concept.    Ahh I didn't know that about the emblem.  Good to know now!  This was my first go at a whiskey bottle and I did it pretty fast so not toooo much research went into bottle design and what not.  Anyway, I also did some beer labels that I posted today as well check it out! http://www.reddit.com/r/suns/comments/3auomq/i_designed_some_az_sports_inspired_beer_labels/"

steelers,3av0dr,Blownbunny,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:52:55 2015 UTC,"Generally, you want to stay away from labeling a complex-curved surface (bending in 2 or more directions) which is typically found on the shoulder (the part just before the neck).  Typically, you need an allowance of 1/16"" to allow the label maker room for error.    To fix this, you could simply create a flatter surface on the shoulder for the label to be applied to.  Many brands will actually press in their emblem into the glass to create a stamped look.  Also, some tips for creating a luxury/premium feel to the bottle, try experimenting with a thicker glass base and a non-plastic closure. 1792 is an excellent example a bourbon bottle that says premium."
steelers,3av0dr,strangebru,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:10:42 2015 UTC,That is a gorgeous looking bottle!  I was going for a painted/embossed glass hybrid look on that emblem to emphasize the quality of the bottle!    I'll keep that in mind for the next bottle I design!  Appreciate it!

I can't really give you plenty of Boston tips because I haven't been there a lot, but regarding Gillette Stadium, be prepared to get shit talked and mocked like no other. It's terrible. I don't know how it is at other stadiums but I get shit all the time when I go to a Steelers game at Gillette. Even the Pats games that aren't against the Steelers that I've been to, the opposing fans also get mocked. They are terrible fans. Awesome stadium and awesome venue in and around the stadium (shops, dining, movies, etc.) but the fans are terrible. Prepare yourself for that whether you want to shit talk back (I don't recommend it) or not, but DO NOT stop cheering for your own team. They'll be all hyped up because ""Free Brady!1!11! Fuck Goodell!!1!!1!"" and it's opening day. Every Pats fan and player will be fired up with rage and excitement. Don't get involved with their shit. Be respectful and courteous and let the score do the talking, even though the fans may not be. Nothing wrong in a little comment here or there, but just be weary of what you say because you never know who you're going to be around and keep it fair. I'm sure you know this, it's common etiquette while at any sporting event but I say it again because the New England fans can be brutal, obnoxious, and annoying than most other fans. There is a reason why they are labeled as some of the worst fans in the NFL.  Besides their terrible and obnoxious fans, you'll have a blast. I always love going to Gillette. Any NFL game is always a ton of fun! Pre-game, you should explore around at Pats place, where they have awesome food, shopping, and movies if you want. OH! I HIGHLY recommend visiting the Bass Pro Shop they have there. I'm not an outdoor guy, but damn the store is fucking cool. Check it out and you'll be amazed with how big it is and what they have in there. If you want, you can try and find a tailgate party to join, and as obnoxious and annoying as the fans are, I'm sure they would let you join into tailgate. You could even check out the Pats museum they have that is right above one of their pro shops (I forgot what the museum/exhibit is called) and that's an interesting place to visit even if you're not into the Pats or their history. Seeing the Super Bowl trophies and all the activities and memorabilia is cool to see. I can admit that coming from a Steelers fan.   What to do in Boston, I can't help with.

steelers,3atuoz,WildBilllll,18,Tue Jun 23 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"Screen passes are great for setting up future plays even when they don't seem to initially be productive. Here's an example of a successful play that was set up by other screens that were called throughout the course of the game.  http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013111707/2013/REG11/lions@steelers#menu=gameinfo|contentId%3A0ap2000000283053&tab=videos  You hear this sort of thing pretty often but they are meant to keep the defense honest. You can see AB faking like he's getting ready for a screen and Cotchery ostensibly getting ready to block for him but then slipping by the secondary after they bite on it.  This play is especially excellent given the context, It's a crucial third down just before the two minute warning where the steelers have the opportunity to very likely put the game away. Haley has some stones and definitely has confidence in his playcalling and this is awesome. This play is pretty much all Haley.  This is also from the season where 31 year old Jericho Cotchery had the most TDs of his career with 10, and that's not a coincidence."

I'd imagine Nate Washington could have had a more prolific career (not that his stats are bad, just not eye-popping) if he'd had a QB like Roethlisberger or Manning throwing to him in his prime instead of whichever journeyman happens to be under center in Tennessee."

Plenty of solid coordinators have gotten HC jobs, stumbled, had success again coordinating and then gotten another shot to be an HC, but Haley's time in KC was nasty. Accusing the FO of tapping his phone, undermining his authority with players, and generally ripping the team while still under contract... I feel like teams would be really leery of Haley as a HC."
steelers,3atuoz,Deckz,4,Tue Jun 23 14:29:56 2015 UTC,"I think Haley would be very leery of moving to another organization after what happened in KC. People come and stay here because we're not just a well run organization, we're well run and great to work for evidently. You don't land a offensive line coach like Munchak without being a great organization not only for winning championships, but cultivating a family like atmosphere. God, I fucking LOVE being a Steelers fan."
steelers,3atuoz,meowdy,3,Tue Jun 23 20:01:55 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna agree with you. I think maybe if our offense carries us to a super bowl win, we might see him get a job, but I think he will be here for a while."
steelers,3atuoz,GI-Jew,2,Tue Jun 23 14:52:53 2015 UTC,"I love what Haley has done in Pittsburgh, but he needs Someone controlling his temper and ego. A former coworker played for him and had plenty of stories. Whole locker room despised him.  Not sure how well liked he is by the players under Tomlin, but the results have been great."
steelers,3atuoz,Work_E_Searcher,2,Tue Jun 23 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"The other thing about being a HC is it's not just coaching anymore.  There's so much more admin.  It's like any job, the higher you climb, the less of your time is spent on the original reason you worked there."
steelers,3atuoz,Steelering,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"for some reason I'd thought he had already been a head coach twice, and failed twice, of which I was going to say that there's no way he's given a 3rd chance...but I was mistaken (perhaps because his time towards the end in KC was such a dumpster fire that it felt like it was a 2x fail), he's only had 1 go at HC, so I would think some team would be desperate enough to give him a 2nd chance, there are always such teams.  Cleveland, for instance."

steelers,3atuoz,pyates13,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:55:22 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the hate for Haley, even with his recent success here, comes from people who never got over his perceived arrogance when he arrived in Pittsburgh (taking the reins of the offense from Ben, their subsequent feud, etc.).  I'll agree I disliked the hire for a while myself, but Roethlisberger and Haley have proven they can set aside personal issues and create the well-oiled machine we know as the Killer B's. I think it was a big ego check for Haley (Big Ben as well!), and i'm glad he responded the way he did.  Side note: He does have a pretty smug face, which I think steers people the wrong way sometimes haha. At least it did for me at first."

steelers,3atuoz,DKnight32x,2,Tue Jun 23 15:44:57 2015 UTC,Why? He's excellent IMO. The fact that he's keeping Ben healthy alone makes him my favorite OC. A healthy Ben and a mediocre OC is better than a completely destroyed Ben and the best OC of all time.

steelers,3axnn6,ColdNose,18,Wed Jun 24 09:25:01 2015 UTC,"Hayward is a beast.  Steve McLendon is the starter, not McCullers, who hasn't really done all that much.  McLendon, however, is an above average starter in my opinion.  Stephon Tuitt was average but has a lot of potential.  Cam Thomas is a walking butthole. Shazier and Jones have flashed potential but have not done anything.  Moats has also shown flashes but has never been a full time starter.  Timmons is a beast.  Harrison is 37 and Dupree is a rookie.  Sean Spence is decent and you forgot Vince Williams, who's awesome.    So, this defense has the potential to be very good, however I would call it average until proven otherwise."

steelers,3axnn6,DriArcher,0,Wed Jun 24 12:19:18 2015 UTC,Jones and Shazier both showed valuable skills being injured. Switch Dupree and Harrison if it makes you feel better.
steelers,3axnn6,1htaehn,3,Wed Jun 24 09:53:07 2015 UTC,"neither showed nearly as much as kendrell bell did as a rookie. yes shazier has much of the same skill set and probably more coverage skills if he remains healthy, but its still speculation at best. wasnt most of what shazier did show preseason too? Bell was healthy early on only to have injury issues derail him, shazier so far is well behind that. as to jones, he needs to show a lot more. the common knock is that he needs bend, i honestly didnt watch him closely enough to really break it down."

We don't know what we're getting out of Shamarko Thomas, I feel like he works hard and can be a starting safety here for awhile for us. We're not going to get much out of Cam Thomas he's there for depth. Heyward, Timmons, Gay are really the only ones we can brag about right now. But if we see jones, shazier, Dupree, tuitt, Grant, Golson and get Cortez going again we should be in good shape. On to Mclendon though, we need to resign him, he's not quite the Casey Hampton and I'm Not sure if he ever will be. I'm not bragging about him too much, because we can find a replacement for him but he does great work and if we don't get him a contract someone will pay him good money."

You know, because Jones being injured then Lebeau insisting on sitting him repeatedly while throwing out the likes of Taylor and Polamalu time and time again means Jones is a bust /s"
steelers,3aujw2,IdunnoLXG,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"I think sitting Jones was the right call if his hand was still affecting his play.  The biggest complaint on Jones is he needs to be stronger, but in the NFL you don't just need strength you need strength and technique.  If his injury is preventing him from using proper technique he might as well just be a really weak linebacker and not give the team its best shot at winning."
steelers,3aujw2,kenzington86,3,Wed Jun 24 01:56:56 2015 UTC,"Okay but Harrison wasn't given a chance to play and people thought Timmons was a bust before that due to the fact Lebeau wanted him to sit out for his first 3 years before seeing any serious playing time. There was something so very wrong about his mindset. Also it was clear Taylor was hurt when he played and Polamalu was getting torched but Lebeau still wanted to play those two instead of giving guys who stepped up like Thomas and Blake a chance to take over. It cost us, potentially, the Wild Card due to his stubbornness."

steelers,3aqqrg,MattEven,10,Wed Jun 24 13:59:09 2015 UTC,Fun fact: Rashard Mendenhall is writing for the show. Should be really authentic.  The funny thing is that ESPN had a similar series called Playmakers ~10 years ago and the NFL pressured them to drop it because it was making them look bad. Now the NFL has done such a great job at making themselves look like idiots and they can't do anything about it since it's HBO.
steelers,3aqqrg,tonytroz,5,Mon Jun 22 20:32:51 2015 UTC,Also the NFL doesn't have anywhere near the pressure on HBO that they have on ESPN

steelers,3aqqrg,MattEven,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:01:45 2015 UTC,HBO does Hard Knocks so I wouldn't be surprised if they leveraged that to get the rights to use them. They also might have just negotiated with the teams themselves.
steelers,3aqqrg,tonytroz,2,Wed Jun 24 14:50:21 2015 UTC,Actually they legally don't need permission to use the trademarks as long as they are used as intended.

Also only weird thing is when there's a fantasy player you have on your roster playing against the Steelers. I think it's great if you're watching a game you're not overly invested in and making it more fun.  For example everyone was watching the Lions Thanksgiving day game. Now usually I wouldn't be overly invested in it or have a side but I had Megatron on my team. So damn right it gave me more of a reason to watch, cheer and enjoy the game then I normally would have.

steelers,3ak9ij,The_YoungWolf,2,Sun Jun 21 00:50:11 2015 UTC,"Just a few things...  The screens are often not the intended play, but rather, something Roethlisberger checks into after his pre-snap look. You'll see oftentimes they'll run it when they have two blockers and a receiver vs. two defenders. Ben sees that after reading the defense and checks into it.   The Steelers' offense is as good as it is now because they have so much experience together. They're talented, yes, but because they have so many players (and an entire offensive line) that's played at least one full season with the same group and the same coaches/coordinator, they're able to install more stuff per play. Because of that, Haley can prepare Ben to have several play options depending on the defense, and he can call any one of those plays at the line of scrimmage.   Conversely, this is why you're hearing so much about Keith Butler's defense being so ""simple."" It's not that it's simple by design, it's that they won't be able to call as much immediately because of the massive amount of turnover they've had the last two years. It'll be the same thing again this year. Tuitt's starting his first Week 1 game, as will Moats. Jones hasn't played much, neither has Shazier. There's a new strong safety, either Thomas (who didn't play at all last year) or Allen, and either one of them hasn't played much with Mitchell.   The hybrid defense thing is a misnomer. The Steelers have been lining up in variations of a 4-3 defense for years. It's a question of where your linemen are and what gaps the linebackers are covering. They're not going to have two DTs playing the 1 and 3 techniques, and their defensive ends won't be in a 7 technique, but they will have a DT playing the 3 technique (or 4i is more accurate) and an OLB playing a 7 technique.   Butler has said he wants the DEs to push up the field more, which is smart, considering the amount of power they have between Heyward and Tuitt (blow-up candidate this year). Plus, they need to get some kind of pass rush production, that's sorely lacking the last few years. I'm not sold on any OLB getting more than six sacks this year. But if Jones, Harrison and Moats each had six sacks...we might have something.   I don't think Dupree gets on the field much. That's just my take. I didn't think Jones should have either, but that was more out of necessity. Worilds just didn't want to take the position on his own, but if Woodley didn't get hurt, Jones wouldn't have been playing over the second half of the year. Dupree is infinitely more athletic, but he's raw, maybe even more than Jones was.   Blake will be the third cornerback, but he's going to be on the outside. They'll move Will Gay inside in nickel packages, so I'd say there's some competition for Golson between both Gay and Blake. If he can show enough to convince the team to leave Gay outside, Golson gets the job inside. If he's not better than Gay inside, he won't play.   /rant"
steelers,3ak9ij,ncoolong,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:19:38 2015 UTC,"With Bell out for the first four games, we will be relying much more heavily on the passing game during that time.   Three games. That is my only nit-pick."
steelers,3ak9ij,sw337,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"Pretty good, however Butler has come out and said he wants Harrison playing at about 25 snaps per game essentially boiling him down to a situational pass rusher (fresh Deebo is best Deebo).  Also, Holliman had a shoulder injury in college which may have led to his piss poor tackling.  However thats just my own speculation."
steelers,3aiahl,cubert2,21,Sat Jun 20 13:16:38 2015 UTC,"The Steagles were such a weird thing to have happen.  They couldn't get either coach to agree to a demotion, so they had a season with two head coaches who hated each other.  The Steelers also apparently only had about 6 players before the merger, and the Eagles had 16, which is why the colors were those of the Eagles, and 4 of 6 home games were in Philly."

Also, if you guys ""respect"" us you wouldn't start redneck threads about us and how we're into such nonsense like incest and have it be the most upvoted topic in /r/browns.

Your words are appreciated and welcome.  Second, I would like to return the favor by wishing that you, your fellow Browns fans, and your entire city be treated to new franchise owners who will return the vaunted Browns to the glorious days they once enjoyed.  I have loved no rivalry more than that which once existed between our two teams.  That one half of this rivalry has fallen on hard times - making the once-beloved rivalry so disappointing each year - is painful to me.  We have replaced the Pittsburgh-Cleveland rivalry with one that involves the Baltimore Ravens - a team which some folks consider to be the Browns of Old.  I'd like to see this reversed.  I want the Baltimore team to suffer crushing defeats each year and to have our rivalry with you Cleveland Browns folks returned to its once-lofty position in the NFL.  Finally - and I mean this with all the respect and warm feelings that I can muster - Fuck the Browns.  Fuck that team, their fans, and their Browns-fan children for generations to come!

But if the mods aren't going to remove them then there's not much to do about it. I just felt like there was so much wrong with this article that I had to say something.

But don't act like you're looking for discussion then avoid any actual discussion. If you want real discussion about the actual quotes by harbaugh you can check the post I linked from r/NFL. It's mostly jokes though but that's because there's no real story to discuss. I don't know why you thought you would get solid discussion about how harbaugh is practicing in a manner to acclimate his players to surprises. This is a steelers subreddit.

steelers,3aj3n6,shstron44,5,Sat Jun 20 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  I'm starting a series ranking each NFL team's positional groups on our sportsblog, and I chose to start with the Steelers. I'd really appreciate some feedback and I'd be interested to know your thoughts on the rankings, I think I might have been a bit too harsh on your defense. I was really surprised when I thought about your team in depth actually, I didn't realize just how strong your offence was. Depending on the play of the defense, I wouldn't be surprised to see you make a deep playoff run.  Thanks!"
steelers,3aj3n6,ncoolong,3,Sat Jun 20 18:12:43 2015 UTC,"If the defense can get 40 sacks and 20 takeaways, they're a 12-4 team. Bell not being on the field for the first three games could end up being the difference between a team that can make a serious run and one that fails to defend its division title.   It'll come down to a few plays in games against the Ravens and the Bengals. Going to Seattle is a loss 95 percent of the time, the Pats, even without Brady, won't be easy considering the circumstances (Belichick's going to work that team into a frenzy and maybe hand out his untraceable strand of HGH this offseason). Very tough schedule, but their offense could score 28 a game. The question is really can the Steelers' defense just be average enough to give up 27 a game?"
steelers,3aj3n6,RenderedInGooseFat,3,Sun Jun 21 01:32:37 2015 UTC,"For TE, I would probably drop it a bit, as Heath is getting up there, James is unproven, and Spaeth isn't that great.  B may work, but I would go with a C until James is proven.    WR, I would go with a B, as Brown is a proven beast, while everyone else is a question mark.  Wheaton, and Bryant could be good, especially Bryant but haven't completely proven themselves.  Coates is just a total question mark as are all rookies.    OLB would be a C or D from me.  Harrison is old, Jarvis looked good last year, but only for 3 games, Dupree is an unknown, and Moates is a place holder.  I don't think that group can be anymore than a C.  CB would be an F for me.  There may not be many CB groups in the NFL worse than ours.  Gay looks like a solid starter, nothing more, Allen has a solid year, and an awful year, and golson is a rookie who probably won't do much this year as rookie CBs tend to struggle.  Outside of that, I agree.  For your site, I would recommend a header re-design.  The background of the header is very pixelated, takes up entirely too much space, and has too much going on.  There is no need to have eyes on the ball written twice, and your twitter handles are cutoff despite the amount of screen real estate your header occupies.  I can only clearly see @eyes_ontheball.  Also since the rest of the page is a slightly dark grey, with white for the center div of your body, I would stay away from the very colorful background of the header.  It doesn't flow with the rest of your page.  I don't want to come off as a dick.  Just giving my honest feedback as a web dev/Steeler fan."
steelers,3aj3n6,RenderedInGooseFat,2,Sat Jun 20 22:27:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's really helpful :) The blog is through sportsblog.com so we're sort of limited on our customisation options, but your feedback meant that we've decided to go with a more general header, and leave our custom one for the social media pages where it fits better.  As for the ratings, I'm pleasantly surprised that both you guys have told me that the ratings are too high if anything. Heath and Harrison are old but productive, usually that means fans will rave about them like they were in their prime."
steelers,3aj3n6,KanyeWest_GayFish,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:02:10 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest things with position groups like our OLBs, and TEs, is there needs to be somewhere higher to go.  For instance we have a 3rd year OLB with 3 career sacks, a rookie OLB, a 37 year old OLB, and a career backup.  If that is a B, what is a team like the Ravens with Suggs, and Dummervil, the Chiefs with Houston, and Hali, the 49ers with Brooks, and Smith, the Broncos with Miller, and Ware, with Shane Ray as an unproven backup, or the Packers with Peppers, and Matthews etc?  The Steelers group could be as good as some of those, but right now Dupree, and Jones are complete question marks, Harrison is a rotational pass rusher, and Moats is a solid stop gap.  Those teams have two dominant, proven starting pass rushers, while the Steelers have none, but have the potential for two.  I would say right now the Steelers are middle of the road at that position, with the ability to climb high depending on the young guys.  Ranking by number, then changin that to a grade may make more sense, but would take more effort.  for instance F- would be 30-32, F would be 28-29, F+ would be 26-27, D- would be 24-25, D would be 22-23, D+ would be 20-21, C- would be 18-19, C would be 15-17, C+ would be 13-14, B- would be 11-12, B would be 9-10, B+ would be 6-8, A- would be 4-5, A would be 2-3, and A+ would be 1.  Something along those lines.  I don't think the Steelers TEs, or OLBs fit in the top ten based on that system.  I figured you were a little limited in what you could do with the site.  Do you have control over all the css on the page, or is most of it preset?  Are you able to add javascript to it, or is it basically HTML+CSS for what you can do?  I definitely understand the being limited, as here we only really have access to css for the whole page, and HTML for a given div on the page."

Being in shape is one thing, but being a great player is something entirely different. He's had every opportunity to learn from a great player and had taken advantage, now he needs make it show up on the field. It's year three, I feel like it's make or break time."
steelers,3aeee3,DriArcher,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:05:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's quite make or break time. This will be his first season as a starter, I think he may deserve a year or so like most guys do. He was just unfortunate to have to wait on troy to retire"
steelers,3aeee3,Ryan5493,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"I'm irrationally excited to see what he can do in a starting capacity. He's an animal on special teams, and everyone that follows the Steelers know that in order to be a key contributor, you have to make your mark on special teams."

steelers,3aesf2,batypus,8,Fri Jun 19 15:19:49 2015 UTC,Not likely that the Pats make it back (and as always I'll be rooting against them every step of the way). Steelers/Colts would be a good one though.

I am excited to see how he preforms behind our line though. The steelers run blocking is a bit of an upgrade from Carolina. So we'll see how he can do!"
steelers,3aesf2,tonytroz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:52:36 2015 UTC,Am I the only guy stoked about D'Angelo Williams?    26 year old DeAngelo with his 1500 yards and 18 TDs maybe. Not the 32 year old that ran for 200 yards last year. 30 is game over for almost every RB.
steelers,3aesf2,Ryan5493,3,Sat Jun 20 05:31:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, he doesn't have a ton of mileage under his belt, and he was part of Carolina's running backs by committee system. He seems to have the right attitude going I to the season, and I could see him adding a nice contribution to this team."

steelers,3ae6ir,lightoasis,2,Sat Jun 20 17:37:42 2015 UTC,We are staying at the Westin Inn/Convention center. Would it be easier just to walk the mile and a half to the game than trying to catch a the T or a taxi? And how sketchy is the downtown walk at night?
steelers,3ae6ir,KOERNDOG,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"You should be good there at night, provided you use some common sense ie don't go down dark alleys, walk in a group, don't waive your money around etc.  It is a nice area of the city, just don't do what you wouldn't in any other major city.  I am assuming you are just talking about walking back from the stadium area.  For walk vs taxi, it depends.  I would say walk, because there are bars on the way that I would stop at, and I would probably grab a drink on the way to avoid stadium pricing as much as possible.  Not sure what you situation is though."
steelers,3aezb4,TheBullfrog,8,Fri Jun 19 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"The main thing I took away from this article:  Apropos of nothing, Shazier asked Heath Miller during a break the other day if his middle name was Earl, because thatâs what heâd heard.  No, Miller corrected, Earl is actually his first name, though not many are aware of that.  After a bit of silence, Shazier politely asked, âCan I call you Earl?â  âYou can call me Heath,â Miller replied."
steelers,3aezb4,akatora,3,Sat Jun 20 01:41:51 2015 UTC,"I found that hilarious!  I'm so glad Shazier was at least polite about it, because otherwise he would have sounded disrespectful.  Or maybe he was trying to be funny.  I'm just picturing Heath saying that while giving a death glare to Heath.  It's entirely possible I put way too much thought into their exchange."
steelers,3aezb4,Diarygirl,6,Sat Jun 20 03:00:42 2015 UTC,"From this, and the article a few days ago where Cam Heyward talked about getting more 1 on 1s, I am led to believe that Butler is either going to incorporate a lot more 1 gap 3-4 concepts, or will be leaving our d-line on the field a lot in 3-4 situations.  If we go more 1 gap, Heyward may have a monster year number wise."

How great would it be if he cracks off three straight 20-carry, 100 yard games? Gotta think if that's his stat line, they're no worse than 2-1 heading into a short week against the Ravens in Pittsburgh. That's a winnable game as well, and going 3-1 in the first quarter of the year, three of which without your MVP, things would be looking up on the year for sure."

steelers,3acm8v,Kj201,4,Fri Jun 19 00:43:22 2015 UTC,"Another fan from Toronto here.  As far as I've noticed over the past 3 years of being a fan and attending a game a year is to buy as soon as the tickets come available, which this year I believe is this coming Monday. You tend to avoid prices rising this way and those crazy scalpers.   I've always sat in the 500's because I enjoy the overall vantage point. That being watching the game from above. Normally I've been lucky and gotten tickets around the 50 yard line. This year I opted for right behind the goal posts for the Broncos game to watch the drives come and go away from me. It's personal preference but I like the 500's.  To do in Pittsburgh I've never made more than a day out of it unfortunately but Primanti Brothers is KEY to visit even if you're there just for the day. Best. Sandwiches. Ever. I'm sure there are users who are residents who can better inform both of us.   Make sure you have a Terrible Towel, a few beers, and cheer on your team through thick and thin. I was there start to finish when they lost in the wild card round last year and I was cheering until the end! And just make the most of the experience cuz it's a crazy one!

I thought he was better than people gave him credit for.  I would love him as the next slash. Make him a WR and special teamer primarily, and backup QB. Can you imagine how deadly a read-option game would be with Pryor and Bell running it? I'm not saying I want Ben coming off the field, but if he got hurt for a game or two TP could hold his own.  I haven't seen this mentioned yet, but I'd like to try him out at kick returner. He's more of a long strider than Hester like make you miss guy, but so was Josh Cribbs.   If the Steelers are intrigued by Devin Gardner, they should sign Pryor. He does everything Gardner does, but better."

Well said, that's where I was going in the column. It saves a roster spot in the sense he can be your emergency QB, but you can still work him as a receiver. You're just looking to get out of the game alive if both Ben and Gradkowski were to go down, and after that, you can look at what other options you may have. He's insanely athletic, that's what this team is going for nowadays.   Probably won't happen, but I think he's worth a tryout."

steelers,3a5q7e,GhoullyX,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:51:21 2015 UTC,I'm glad I'm not the only one that says this
steelers,3a5q7e,godspeedmetal,6,Wed Jun 17 16:50:40 2015 UTC,Are you new here?
steelers,3a5q7e,curlbaumann,8,Wed Jun 17 16:52:16 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much our motto at this point.   Between the bumblebee jerseys and the Killer B's on offense, we might as well make that an official chant."
steelers,3a5q7e,Juventus19,3,Wed Jun 17 16:56:20 2015 UTC,Now we are talking!
steelers,3a5q7e,Juventus19,8,Wed Jun 17 17:25:16 2015 UTC,Fuck yes. I love that they keep bringing them back!

steelers,3a5q7e,jakdak,5,Wed Jun 17 13:33:02 2015 UTC,So we're wearing them twice this year.  Wish we wore them about 5 more times.
steelers,3a5q7e,DriArcher,4,Wed Jun 17 14:50:06 2015 UTC,I think they made an exception to wear them twice for the Oakland game. The only way we are beating them is in our bumbles. >:0
steelers,3a5q7e,DriArcher,4,Wed Jun 17 13:47:46 2015 UTC,That's what I said when they announced it. God damn raiders
steelers,3a5q7e,toadstyle,2,Wed Jun 17 13:56:17 2015 UTC,Are we wearing them twice this year?  Where is that stated?
steelers,3a5q7e,DriArcher,2,Wed Jun 17 13:59:03 2015 UTC,It was announced awhile back that we would wear them against Oakland . I'll try to find the link   Edit : http://www.steelersdepot.com/2015/05/report-steelers-to-wear-1934-striped-bumble-bee-throwback-uniforms-in-2015/

steelers,3a5q7e,MichelangeBro,2,Thu Jun 18 17:52:15 2015 UTC,Go Bell.
steelers,3a5q7e,corywyn,2,Wed Jun 17 20:46:17 2015 UTC,But who could say no to that smile?

steelers,3a8f6b,batypus,3,Thu Jun 18 18:52:35 2015 UTC,This X's 1000000000000
steelers,3a8f6b,steelbydesign,8,Thu Jun 18 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"We've had a hard enough time getting more than 8 wins in a season recently, Tom could use the break."
steelers,3a8f6b,Gdoffmylawn,16,Thu Jun 18 03:48:27 2015 UTC,"Suspended. I couldn't give a fuck a less about the ""DURRRR WE GOTTA BEAT THEIR FULL TEAM OR IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD DURRR"" crap. If we get a massive advantage in a road game where we're missing our starting all-pro RB  against a team that we may well need a head-to-head tiebreaker over for playoff seeding later on in the year, I think we should be ecstatic."
steelers,3a8f6b,ns156,5,Thu Jun 18 01:45:13 2015 UTC,"Suspended.  A win is a win, and if we win, NE can't say we wouldn't have done it with Brady since we won't have Le'Veon."
steelers,3a8f6b,Diarygirl,2,Thu Jun 18 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"Do we want to win?  Then him being suspended is the only way that will probably happen.  Do we want to see what we have as a team?  Him playing is the only way we'll find that out.     Personally, I want the win early in the season.  If it was week 12 I'd want him playing because that's when the team should be playing it's best and gearing up for the playoffs (hopefully)."
steelers,3a8f6b,ThisIsTheBlack,2,Thu Jun 18 13:25:28 2015 UTC,"We can't beat the Pats with Brady?  I respectively disagree. Would be a very hard game, but to say it would be the only way (he being suspended) I think is short-changing the Steelers"
steelers,3a8f6b,ThisIsTheBlack,2,Thu Jun 18 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't say can't.  I said probably won't.  The Steelers, on paper, aren't good enough defensively to stop a team like the Patriots.  It doesn't mean they can't win.  Ben might throw for 500 yards and 6TDs that game.  It's going to take something like that if Brady is playing though."
steelers,3a8f6b,DTX180,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:55:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we have had maybe 1 win vs Brady since he entered the league. The only one I can think of was Ben's rookie year to end their undefeated streak. Have we beaten Brady in any other year? We beat the Pats the year he tore his ACL when we won the SB in 2008, but thats it I think."
steelers,3a8f6b,NimbusHex,5,Thu Jun 25 14:27:05 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see him play, I get that we're at a disadvantage without Bell but it's like 1/10 of the disadvantage the Pats would have without Brady.  Williams is at least a competent replacement for Bell, Garappolo is an astronomical downgrade at the most important position.  Let the secondary get the shit kicked out of them the first week to show them how hard they need to work the rest of the season."
steelers,3a8f6b,IdunnoLXG,2,Thu Jun 18 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"Don't agree with you there. Bell was a multi-faceted player and it was clear how much we missed him against the Ravens. I don't want it to seem like we were going to win since we got blown the heck off the line especially in the 1st half but Bell's dynamic playmaking was sorely missed. When a play breaks down Ben doesn't have Ward or Miller to rely on anymore. He usually relies on Bell who doesn't just turn a negative into a positive, but sometimes even rushes for 20 or so yards.  Probably the thing that got me the most was in the beginning of the Ravens game when a play broke down and Tate was there. Ben tried to just get him the ball so that he can make a play on it and it could have sprung for a major gain. However Tate dropped the ball and the tone was set for the entire game.  That's the type of player we miss when we don't have Bell. He is a key player on offense."
steelers,3a8f6b,KurtTheDeerman,2,Thu Jun 18 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"A win is a win. But, if Brady was playing, we'd get to see a real test for our defense to see how the rest of our year is going to play out. There is also the case where going into the game everyone is going to pick us to slaughter the patriots because we're going against their backup, and instead he ends up torching our defense. And we end up being the butt of every joke. Similar to the Teebo situation a few years ago."
steelers,3a8f6b,zjrk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:44:03 2015 UTC,"If it weren't for the incredibly hard schedule we have, I'd want him to play. but we need to catch some breaks this season and I consider this one of them."
steelers,3a8f6b,EpicallyBoss,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'd like to see how we'd fare against an elite team like the Patriots and Brady...but if Brady has to be suspended then, ayy I'm not complaining. I'll take one win pls."

steelers,3a2p9g,MedicGirl,13,Tue Jun 16 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"The drawing was quite a process in itself.    MedicGirl suggested a drawing of some kind.  I told my daughter this and gave her no further suggestions.  What to draw was entirely her idea.  She immediately knew she wanted to draw Antonio Brown catching a touch down catch over his shoulder with the ""ball still in the air"".  After some vigorous searching, she found a picture that was suitable to her.   Other than the Google searches, I provided no assistance."

You would probably have to cab/uber over to the game, that's a far walk.    Also, you could stay at the DoubleTree on Bigelow and walk to the Primanti's in Market Square and then either walk to Heinz Field or take the T over.    Or you could just stay right in the North Shore and eat at Bettis' Bar/Grille and walk to the game.    For Friday I'd recommend going up to Mt. Washington seeing the amazing view of the city and stadiums.  Make sure you eat at Primanti's at least once or you basically didn't even come to Pittsburgh.  If you are staying Friday night or even Thursday night then you have to go dahn southside and get hammered to celebrate the Steelers kicking some raven ass."

If you stay closer to the North Shore you probably don't need to leave that early however if you're staying outside of the city get there early since the traffic is hella bad. If you can snag a hotel that doesn't require you to travel through the parkway the better.

steelers,3a1pgt,GrinnerKnot,2,Tue Jun 16 17:28:07 2015 UTC,If you go on Ticketmaster it says there is a pre-sale starting tomorrow.

steelers,3a1zic,dj0,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:06:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, he's an awesome ST player and gives us even more WR depth.  Sure he never panned out as a starting WR, but he contributes in other ways."

steelers,3a1zic,dangerm0use,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:45:37 2015 UTC,Clifton Geathers was on the Steelers' roster at the end of last year.

steelers,3a1zic,dangerm0use,2,Tue Jun 16 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"Aha, Geathers signed in December of 2014, and since this is an offseason review, he comes off the list, thanks.   Correct about Green, I think it is appropriate as written.  I got all contract numbers from here  What happened was I originally put the whole contract value and decided half way through to change it to average salary. I forgot to change Devins and Jordan Berry, fixed them now. Thanks!"
steelers,3a0r63,letownia,29,Tue Jun 16 09:22:44 2015 UTC,I would say Bell but only because we don't have as much depth at RB compared to WR.
steelers,3a0r63,BioSin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:02:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the depth behind the player is just as relevant as the player's skill when comparing relative importance. If DeAngello plays really well, one could argue that Antonio Brown is more critical to the Steelers succcess."
steelers,3a0r63,1htaehn,2,Tue Jun 16 11:40:08 2015 UTC,"According to Panthers fans on /r/nfl, he's a shadow of his former self. I wouldn't expect anything more than a solid backup role for DWilliams."
steelers,3a0r63,IDontNeedThisIndigo,3,Tue Jun 16 17:17:38 2015 UTC,And I think it's safe to trust their opinions because Williams is a beloved ex-player - this isn't like Steelers fans talking about Wallace and Sanders as if they're scrubs
steelers,3a0r63,1htaehn,2,Tue Jun 16 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They talk about him like they still wish he was great, even though he doesn't play for them anymore."
steelers,3a0r63,VaderShake,13,Tue Jun 16 18:54:59 2015 UTC,"Basic football 101, it's Bell, a starting RB touches the ball 17-25ish times a game a #1 WR has 8 touches or more. With no significant threat at RB we also expose Ben more to hits and pressure. Antonio is a great player but without a legitimate or high end RB threat safeties can cheat a little more in coverage."
steelers,3a0r63,Homeless_Prophet,5,Tue Jun 16 12:30:23 2015 UTC,"Bell.  Pittsburgh has been a WR factory lately.  Brown is special, no doubt, but the Steelers could get the offense back up and running with the younger guys on the team."
steelers,3a0r63,ThisIsTheBlack,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:08:39 2015 UTC,"Pittsburgh has been a WR factory lately.     You ever notice how a lot of those WRs go elsewhere and are very average, unless they have Peyton Manning throwing to them?  I think Ben makes guys look pretty good at times, just like a Manning does."
steelers,3a0r63,Homeless_Prophet,2,Thu Jun 18 13:28:38 2015 UTC,I sure do.  I'm hoping that AB recognizes that and stays here his whole career.
steelers,3a0r63,dj0,3,Thu Jun 18 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. But I would lean towards Bell. Our passing game is comprised of a top 3 QB, Bell, Bryant, Miller, Wheaton and now Coates. Without AB they will still play good ball.   At RB however, when Bell's out we haven't got anywhere near as much. Williams is a decent backup but doesn't even come close. Bell's massive contribution to the passing game might just give him the edge right now.   In saying that I think AB's probably the better player right now, but honestly I don't know."
steelers,3a0r63,DHend10,3,Tue Jun 16 11:06:32 2015 UTC,See playoff game last year: Having a Rb like Bell does so much for an offense.  Taking nothing away from AB though
steelers,3a0r63,Kodyak77,2,Tue Jun 16 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"Le'Veon. The quick passing, HB dump-off strategy has been vital to our offense the past two years.  I feel like Bryant, Wheaton, Coates could still get the job done outside."
steelers,3a0r63,steelbydesign,2,Tue Jun 16 11:20:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're just saying like a 1 game situation, or looking towards to future.  If it's a question of down the road when contract situations arise, I'd keep Bell.  I think we could be ok at WR with Bryant, Coates, and Wheaton."
steelers,3a0r63,Drakengard,2,Tue Jun 16 13:36:20 2015 UTC,"Bell.  It's not even a question.  Brown is a great WR if not the best in the league right now.  BUT we have depth at WR.  Once you lose Bell, your drop off is significant.  He doesn't just touch the ball, he also picks up blocks and at times is a WR on a screen passes.  Bell's versatility is more important than Brown's absurd route running skills."
steelers,3a0r63,Rocthepanther,2,Tue Jun 16 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"Bell. A great runningback can effect the passing offense much more than a great wide reciever effects the running game. If recent years have proven anything, it's that balanced offenses are much more effective, and recievers are a dime a dozen compared to runningbacks."
steelers,3a0r63,ctornync,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"Must be Bell, now that the internet has determined that he is a better receiver than Brown, right?  Hopefully that guy can work up a QB metric for him too so we can see if he can sub in for Ben sometimes."
steelers,3a2b9f,Taz-erton,2,Tue Jun 16 17:55:53 2015 UTC,They're still overpriced
steelers,39ucig,Losalou52,6,Sun Jun 14 21:14:02 2015 UTC,"Wheaton is clearly a talented guy, for some reason the timing between him and Ben just always seems a little off, it very much reminds me of Sanders."
steelers,39ucig,NimbusHex,4,Sun Jun 14 21:29:23 2015 UTC,He's still stepped up when we needed him to. He reminds me of Cedric Wilson except he's not a head case. When we needed key 3rd down conversions he was there to get open in space and make a play happen.
steelers,39ucig,IdunnoLXG,2,Mon Jun 15 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but even when he makes a catch it's like the ball is always a little bit in front of him or a little behind, and he has to do something to make the catch that prevents it from being a bigger play than it could have been.  I'm not sure if it's him, Ben, or both that causes this."
steelers,39ucig,NimbusHex,4,Mon Jun 15 01:20:12 2015 UTC,Maybe Ben could do what Manning did with Sanders and put in extra time? Because according to Sanders that was a big difference between BR and PFM.  edit - http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000370763/article/emmanuel-sanders-peyton-better-leader-than-big-ben
steelers,39ucig,social_psycho,8,Mon Jun 15 00:02:45 2015 UTC,"I know Sanders said that, but I'm still having trouble buying it. Peyton, Ben, you, me, doesn't matter who's throwing the ball. If it hits you in the numbers you catch it. Sanders didn't do that often enough in Pittsburgh, but he did it last year in Denver. All these bonehead mistakes that were all on him. The two point conversion failure against Baltimore in 2013. Again against Baltimore, caught a pass from Charlie Batch and had a clear path to the endzone but fumbled the ball, untouched, as he's trying to secure it. Those aren't mistakes that Peyton Manning cured, they're mistakes that Sanders himself finally focused on on the field. It's not Ben's job to make sure Sanders remembers the basics from high school or earlier."
steelers,39ucig,Steinerway,3,Mon Jun 15 04:49:41 2015 UTC,"You are certainly entitled to your opinion. Ben has had maturity issues for the better part of his career. What Sanders said and then stood by seems more plausible than other theories, IMO anyway."
steelers,39ucig,social_psycho,3,Mon Jun 15 04:59:45 2015 UTC,"I mean...hardly an opinion that Sanders made bonehead mistakes while he was here, but ok. Especially compared to other receivers like Holmes and Wallace who were headcases in their own right, yet still far more successful with Ben than Sanders was."
steelers,39ucig,Steinerway,2,Mon Jun 15 19:21:39 2015 UTC,"Ben would hit Sanders in the fuckin numbers and he'd drop it.   I wouldn't be surprised if Manning goes through more reps than Ben, but you don't get to the point Ben has without putting in the work.   Seems to me like maybe Sanders started working a little harder once he got to Denver."
steelers,39ucig,steelbydesign,-1,Tue Jun 16 15:25:30 2015 UTC,"Eh, probably more to do with the fact that Manning is a once in a lifetime QB.  The dude has one of the weakest arms in the league and still puts up elite numbers.  Peyton would've made Limas Sweed look good.  Be it because he is a coach/qb hybrid, or his ability to read defenses, or whatever else that makes him so great - Ben just isn't Peyton and unfortunately won't ever be."

steelers,39ucig,GreatWay2StayInShape,0,Mon Jun 15 20:08:21 2015 UTC,You missed my point. You don't have to be a qb/coach hybrid to put in extra time with receivers to make sure you are on the same page. Sanders flat out said that was a big difference.
steelers,39ucig,social_psycho,2,Mon Jun 15 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"No, I got your point, you missed mine. Regardless of what he said, Peyton is a better QB on the field and off the field, this in addition to practice time.  That's my point, it could be any combination of things including what you mentioned."
steelers,39ucig,slivr33,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:55:55 2015 UTC,This is what I see.  Hopefully him and big ben get on the same page.  I personally think that happens and we see a big year from Wheaton.

steelers,39ucig,meowdy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:23:47 2015 UTC,"He reminds me of Sanders too. However, Wheaton is as good in year 2 as Sanders was in year 4. Hopefully Markus will continue to improve and take the next step that Sanders didn't/couldn't take it Pittsburgh"
steelers,39ucig,President_Puddles,2,Mon Jun 15 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"Makes complete sense. With Bryant stepping up his game last year, and drafting Coates in the 3rd, it's definitely a make or break year for Markus."
steelers,39ucig,belovedkid,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"Bryant and Brown will be on the outside. Once Coates comes of age, I could see him and Bryant on the outside in 3-4 receiver sets w Brown or Wheaton in the slot.   You can carry more than 3 receivers. Wheaton is the perfect size/speed/hands combo for a deadly slot weapon."

steelers,39v88g,stuckmeformypaper,16,Mon Jun 15 02:04:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's more to give Jones and maybe Dupree as well more reps to prove themselves than to reduce Harrison's role.  It's year 3 and they just need to figure out what they have in Jarvis at this point, and that's not going to happen if they just give Harrison all the reps from the start.  If they struggle Harrison's playing time will be increased as the season goes on."
steelers,39v88g,PhantomJB93,3,Mon Jun 15 03:41:01 2015 UTC,I think a better way of saying it would be; Jarvis will get an opportunity to earn his playing time.
steelers,39v88g,slivr33,9,Mon Jun 15 17:46:58 2015 UTC,I don't see why you'd be upset about that. He's 37. The fact that he's still playing at all is surprising considering his extremely physical playing style. Do you really think he could hold up for a whole season as a full time starter? It just won't happen. His body is just old now and can't take as much abuse as it used to. I'd have been surprised if he wasn't in a reduced role.
steelers,39v88g,rackcs,-1,Mon Jun 15 03:44:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe reduce it to where they try to use him mainly against pass-happy offenses or in obvious passing situations for the opposing offense. As for durability, I've found more issues with the 25 year-old Jarvis Jones than the 37 year-old Harrison. With the right preparation, it's quite amazing what the body can handle. See Tony Gonzalez."
steelers,39v88g,rackcs,3,Mon Jun 15 04:00:17 2015 UTC,"I'll just take the key word from your first sentence: ""reduce."" That's what the Steelers are doing, they're reducing his role. For all you know, they could be reducing it to exactly what you're talking about. I could be wrong but I don't think the coaches have indicated how much they would like to use him next year.   As for Jarvis, I agree that he's probably not going to be durable enough to handle a full load, but it's not as though they're going to start a 37 year old with a deteriorating body over a recent first round pick with high expectations. They've got too much riding on Jones to have him ride the bench behind a 37 year old.  Tony Gonzalez is the exception, not the rule. Many, many more players have significantly slowed down with extreme age, even in the span of one offseason. It's hard to know how their bodies will hold up with age. Granted, Harrison is a beast but it's unreasonable to expect someone that old to play like they did years ago. I love Deebo, he might be my favorite all time Steeler and I'm glad he's still playing at this age but I'd rather he play sparingly and stay healthy than get pushed too much and do even worse damage to his body."
steelers,39v88g,ColdNose,2,Mon Jun 15 05:10:20 2015 UTC,Butler has come out and said he wants Harrison down to 25 snaps a game.
steelers,39v88g,NotJoeyWheeler,7,Mon Jun 15 06:11:10 2015 UTC,"Nah, I don't mind that decision at all because he's not the future. If he's playing the best and can handle a larger role, then put him in more, but we need to focus on developing our young players more for the future and giving them valuable experience."
steelers,39v88g,Rorbotron,6,Mon Jun 15 04:38:34 2015 UTC,"Everyone is making the mistake in assuming that Jarvis Jones is going to be the one splitting time.  Harrison if he splits time at all is going to be splitting with Arthur moats and Dupree.  Worilds is obviously gone, Dupree is still raw and Moats while solid is a journeyman.  Jones will take majority snaps on his side and Harrison the other if he's up to the challenge and the load."
steelers,39v88g,NapoleonBlownapart87,4,Mon Jun 15 03:50:53 2015 UTC,"Deebo is a physical freak, but he's also 37. He played great last year, but also remember how fresh he was since he missed training camp and the first 4 games of the season. If you think about it that way, it's probably about 1/3 of the season he missed and was fresher down the stretch because of it. Since he's going to be in uniform from day 1 reducing his role to keep him fresh makes sense."
steelers,39v88g,herpendatderp,0,Mon Jun 15 15:08:10 2015 UTC,He wasn't fresh he was fat and old
steelers,39v88g,Sex_E_Searcher,5,Wed Jun 24 04:08:03 2015 UTC,"At his age, using Deebo every down will wear him out.  You'll get more effective lay using him sparingly."

steelers,39v88g,steelbydesign,3,Mon Jun 15 03:08:51 2015 UTC,Fans crack me up.  How many people over the past several years have been upset at the organization's reluctance to sit aging vets in favor of getting young guys on the field.  It's time to let Jarvis Jones sink or swim.
steelers,39v88g,kenzington86,2,Tue Jun 16 13:38:37 2015 UTC,"First off, I think Jones has a better chance than most people give him, his start to last year was great (3 sacks and a fumble in 3 games) and then the complaint later was with his strength in hand fighting with offensive linemen, while he was recovering from a hand injury.  Secondly, I won't complain about under using Harrison until we actually see them in game. We don't know how moats will do in year two or if Dupree is ready to play. If they are even close skill wise I'd be fine saving Harrison for the playoffs."
steelers,39v88g,VaderShake,2,Mon Jun 15 19:14:15 2015 UTC,If our NT can hold and command a double team like Steed & Hampton did it wont matter much who is at outside LB we will get pressure.

steelers,39v88g,kingpatzer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:35:55 2015 UTC,"Why don't we go ask Lambert to suit up again while we're at it.   I get that Harrison contributed last year. However, we have an offense that can win any game the defense lets us stay in. We need a long term solution to defensive weaknesses so that we can compete for multiple shots at the title. Sticking with Harrison does not give us that option."

steelers,39qbms,Connor_J_Hughes,5,Sat Jun 13 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"What I'd like to see the Steelers do in the future is retire a player's number for the rest of that player's life and re-issue it to another player only if they ask for that number and the team votes to allow it.  If the Steelers are going to retire another number any time soon, it should be #52 - Mike Webster's number.  The Steelers have never re-issued that number.  Retiring it is the least we could do for the man."
steelers,39qbms,WiseCynic,7,Sun Jun 14 01:28:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  For us, I think we should not retire jerseys.  With the whole #44 thing in Syracuse going on, it got me thinking. I think we should not retire jerseys, but reserve them for certain player in the future.   Think about #26. That could be two HoFers if Bell continues on his path, but it's offense and defense.   To me it would be pretty cool if the team voted to give someone a jersey change. Like...say you were a dominant lineman. We'd offer you #75. Maybe you are a great WR, PK, P, whatever. You could have #12 if you wanted. As long as you are:   Eligible Great   You could change your number and then join the list of people who had it or you could make your number one of the greats."
steelers,39qbms,smacksaw,4,Sat Jun 13 19:52:11 2015 UTC,"Also not to mention teams that retire numbers, teams like the Cowboys, Packers and Niners are teams based on major personalities and ""larger than life"" guys. The Steelers were the opposite. Rooney made it a point to build the team off of collectivism and that no one player was ever bigger or meant more than the team."
steelers,39qbms,IdunnoLXG,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:47:28 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting point. If the Steelers wanted to, imagine how many numbers could be retired right this minute. 12, 26, 36, 47, 52, 58, 59, 66, 82, 86, 88 and a ton more in future years like 7, 43, 92, etc.   Putting numbers on reserve for players that go above and beyond in representing what we call ""Steeler football"" would be one of the greatest honours a current player could hope for. It would ensure new memories get created, adding a new legacy to a legendary number. I'm all for it."

steelers,39qbms,wendysNO1wcheese,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"Some soccer clubs actually do something very similar to this.   For example, #7 is iconic in Manchester United. Many of their legends have worn it. A recent example of handing the number down was 2003, when David Beckham left the team, and the #7 jersey was vacant. Alex Ferguson (The manager) decided to give #7 to an 18 year old Cristiano Ronaldo, because he thought he could live up to that #7. Rest is history. I do love your idea though, and I love the idea of numerous legendary Steelers donning the same number as past legends."

steelers,39nira,imtoosticky,12,Sat Jun 13 00:39:20 2015 UTC,Just a note. They're doing this strictly on one year income. Since NFL contracts have big signing bonuses whichever the biggest signing or extensions of a year are will make it on the list.
steelers,39nira,Intropy_,2,Sat Jun 13 02:16:38 2015 UTC,That makes sense because I know some of these international soccer players have tons of endorsements and make bank as well.
steelers,39nira,drxzoidberg,2,Sat Jun 13 11:11:34 2015 UTC,"The chart actually breaks it out into salary/winnings and endorsements. You're right that the top soccer players get a lot in endorsements. Ronaldo made $27M and Messi made $22M. But the ones who really clean up on endorsements as a percentage of income look like golfers and tennis players. Federer made 9M on winnings and 58M on endorsements. Phil Mickelson made 48M on endorsements compared to 2.8M winnings, but the most scewed one is Tiger woods who made 99% of his money on endorsements, 50M against 600K."

The game that was won by a Keyaron Fox INT for a TD with a minute left  2010: Raiders. The game Big Ben got punched in the face by Richard Seymour  2011: Pats (See Above)  2012: Eagles. A few bad calls in the game, and I had really bad seats (Upper deck opposite the open end and surrounded by Eagles fans) but the day was saved by a Shaun Suisham game winner  2013: Lions: Megatron goes off and the Lions score 27 in the second quarter, but Steelers pull ahead in the 4th to win by 10.  2014: Bucs: Blocked from my memory, sorry."

steelers,39g5am,TenTonsOfAssAndBelly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:02:56 2015 UTC,Is it just the audio or is that a mobile issue
steelers,39g5am,snookyface90210,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"This was one of the most satisfying regular season wins ever for me. A team we historically have struggled against, and this was in the middle of the era in which Lebeau was having our corners give HUGE cushions that allowed talented quarterbacks to pick us apart all day. For this one game we abandoned that strategy and it worked amazingly well."
steelers,39g5am,teh_hasay,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:32:14 2015 UTC,"You know how we won that? We didn't try to get fancy in the secondary. Zone blitz is a great scheme because it works against most quarterbacks. Not the top quarterbacks. You have to get physical in the secondary while getting pressure up the middle.   Brady likes to get rid of it quickly and rely on YAC, something that's not as effective against tight man coverage. He'll still make some plays but he'll slip up on his accuracy enough times in a game that a stout defensive game plan can take advantage of. Finding weaknesses in zone coverage? He'll do that all day without missing a beat. Much of Brady's success has been from defensive coordinators trying to out-fancy him."
steelers,39daft,EpicallyBoss,19,Thu Jun 11 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's arguable at all. He's never had more playmakers to work with. Brown, Bell, Wheaton and Bryant all came up big last year, Miller is still a solid all-around TE, and he has an offensive line that can keep him upright for the first time since Faneca left and Hartings retired. The Steelers have had a lot of solid possession receivers under Roethlisberger, and he brought out the most in guys like Santonio Holmes and Mike Wallace, but this is the first group of receivers that seems like they'd be good weapons with or without Roethlisberger at QB."
steelers,39daft,TitoTheMidget,4,Thu Jun 11 02:35:53 2015 UTC,This times one-million. It is the best offense the steelers have had period...ever.
steelers,39daft,matttopotamus,17,Thu Jun 11 16:05:18 2015 UTC,"Let's break it down. Pouncey is one of the best centers in the league, which is where everything starts. With the zone blocking scheme last year, it's an overall solid o-line. Probably the best Ben's ever been behind, as a group. (I don't want to discount Faneca in his early days.) Brown is the best wr Pittsburgh has ever seen, and he's done it enough seasons to make it more than a fluke year (see Wallace who had a really good 1.5 years then fell off a cliff). Hines was great, but he was never talked about as best in a league filled with extreme talent at the position. If Bryant continues (rumor has it he's been at the gym all off-season putting him at 6'4"" 225) he will be a better Plaxico. Miller has always been clutch. And while I want to say Bell is better than Bettis, arguments can be made. For instance, Bell is young, Bettis has had a long career to show his hall of fame talent. The bus may never have been a receiving back, but he was the definition of a power back, up the gut and (almost) never fumble kind of guy.   Tldr:  Brown vs Ward, Bryant vs Burres, Bell vs Bettis, Pouncey vs Faneca, Heeeeeaaath"
steelers,39daft,drxzoidberg,13,Thu Jun 11 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"It must suck being a running back. Bettis had an amazing career, but everybody knows exactly which fumble you're talking about when you have to say ""almost"" never"

steelers,39daft,kingkoons,8,Thu Jun 11 10:25:24 2015 UTC,"Bettis wasn't exactly a playmaker when Roethlisberger was playing though. In 2004 he split carries with Duce Staley until Staley got injured, and in 2005 he was a glorified goal line back. The Bus' best days were behind him by the time the Roethlisberger era had begun."

steelers,39daft,Taz-erton,2,Thu Jun 11 18:09:52 2015 UTC,No he didn't. Bettis retired after 05. Holmes first year was 06.
steelers,39daft,maltrab,6,Thu Jun 11 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"He's right.    It's probably not the best OL he's had, but it is the best he's had since very early in his career (when it was Faneca, Hartings, Marvel Smith, Max Starks etc.). Maurkice Pouncey is an elite center, he and Hartings are probably comparable. David DeCastro isn't Faneca, but he might be elite in a year. Kelvin Beachum might be the best left tackle Ben's had, although I'd argue Marvel Smith was probably better for a short time. Le'Veon Bell is better than any of the Bettis' years that Ben was a part of. The reason the Bus is a Hall of Famer is because of his longevity, so that's what he has on Bell. But Bell is probably at the same level the Bus was talent wise (despite very different skill sets) at his peak. Dri Archer isn't squat yet, but if he could just be a 5 snaps per game X-Factor, he could be extremely dangerous. I'd say the same for Antonio Brown vs. Hines/Plax/Santonio/Wallace as Bell vs. Bus. I love Hines, but he was never on the level that Antonio Brown is right now. Throw in an emerging Martavis Bryant and 3rd year (when receivers tend to blow up) adequate slot guy in Markus Wheaton. I don't want to get my hopes up but I could see Sammie Coates being at least a dangerous field stretcher as a rookie."
steelers,39daft,steelbydesign,5,Thu Jun 11 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"I'm still amazed that, at one point, his receivers were Antonio Brown, Mike Wallace and Emmanuel Sanders"
steelers,39daft,Dleslie212,3,Thu Jun 11 13:30:55 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this was before Brown was a breakout star, and Sanders hadn't developed into the form he's in right now."

I never cared one way or another about him, he never wowed me but he wasn't terrible. But it turns out if he actually cares he could be really good. Had he gave us that effort he'd be in a much better place right now to be in position to win it all. With Brown, Sanders, Bryant and Bell as weapons Big Ben would look like a Greek God out there... Too bad he was a bitch and left us. Good riddance to him."

On the other hand, he has absolutely no idea where the ball is and Fitzpatrick just scrambles right by him, I think he gained like 5 or so yards on the play. Good news is that gaining that awareness comes from experience, he'll have it soon enough."
steelers,39atm0,Steinerway,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:22:11 2015 UTC,Question. Do players in the NFL line ever get moved from Defense to Offense like in college football? It seems his ability to create holes like that can really help an offense out.
steelers,39atm0,gryffon5147,2,Wed Jun 10 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"Well this play is kind of a highlight as to why he shouldn't go on offense. He didn't create a hole on that play, his goal was to get to the QB by any means possible. Just so happened that he chose to do it by driving the lineman back...but again, he completely lost the guy with the ball. Imagine being on the OL and having to peel off a defensive lineman and take on a linebacker, or something of the sorts. How good would he be at tracking the linebacker if on this play, he didn't even react to the QB scrambling right by him?"

The Cavs, on the other hand, are missing two All Star players, and should really have no business at all beating Golden State.

steelers,397otp,SMc-Twelve,5,Wed Jun 10 05:36:11 2015 UTC,He asked me how LA was. I don't live in LA. I shouldve told him I did so he'd leave me alone lol.

He'll lose the ability to message you, and if he stalks you outside of /r/steelers (to a sub where he's not banned - like he did with me over at /r/Christianity the other day), you won't even get a notification or anything.  His post will just show up as being collapsed if you happen to enter a thread where he's posted.  Highly recommended.  Also, if you use RES, you tag him as a troll, to remind you why his comments are appearing collapsed for you."
steelers,397otp,IdunnoLXG,8,Wed Jun 10 12:45:11 2015 UTC,"This is the best thing to do. He wants attention, so block him and forget about him. He'll get bored if we forget he exists."
steelers,397otp,rhino43grr,5,Wed Jun 10 15:46:11 2015 UTC,Thank you!  I was wondering how to block him.  He PM'd me and told me I should not worry about his mental health.

steelers,397otp,akatora,15,Wed Jun 10 02:49:25 2015 UTC,"/u/akatora, what do you mean, despite being a girl?  It's not like your opinion is less valuable.  I guess I don't go to many subs where there's sexist shit.  Sure, I get called ""dude"" a lot but most people here know I'm a girl, and once in a great while I get called ""bitch"" or the C word, but for the most part gender is not a part of it whatsoever."
steelers,397otp,sw337,4,Wed Jun 10 04:53:37 2015 UTC,"FWIW I read that as either ""thanks for making me feel welcome despite being a girl [in contrast to other Steelers forums on the internet]"", or ""[in contrast to other parts of reddit].""

steelers,397otp,SMc-Twelve,6,Tue Jun 9 23:35:06 2015 UTC,"Is there really any evidence that people actually ganged up on him and downvoted his comments?  It just seems so time-consuming to do that.  I'm afraid it's a mental-health issue, and he needs help.  Sometimes his comments made a lot of sense, and then he started talking about people threatening his life.  He could very well be bipolar or schizophrenic."

steelers,397otp,rhino43grr,11,Tue Jun 9 22:38:11 2015 UTC,"I guess I missed this but after checking his profile, all of his shit is getting mass downvoted.  DO.NOT.TOUCH.THE.POOP  If you vote on anything he says or does you're risking triggering the shadowban system. It works by being very liberal in selecting you and then you have to message the admins to get your account restored.  I don't downvote very often to begin with, but I never downvote something with a ton of downvotes because that's how I got shadowbanned to begin with. If a comment/post/user starts getting rained on with downvotes, STAY AWAY.  The other way to get SB'd is upvoting a bunch of stuff, but it seems like he won't have to worry about getting those from the community.  Finally, consider for a moment that he's trying to get you to react; to do something. He doesn't win/lose if you downvote him. But if you get shadowbanned brigading him?  You lose. He wins.  So just leave him be."
steelers,397otp,Deckz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:14:30 2015 UTC,"What is a shadowwban? Is it just like the Reddit powers-that-be ban you from posting or voting on things without warning?  As someone who downvoted his transphobic rants and horrendous MS Paint masterpieces, I'm hoping I'm not at risk now that I have him blocked."
steelers,397otp,Lugia_,5,Wed Jun 10 19:04:51 2015 UTC,"It basically means you don't exist on reddit.  All of your comments are automatically deleted, and your user page will say page not found to every one, except you.  To you it will look like everything is normal.  I saw a post about a month ago where a guy was shadow banned for over a year, but just thought no one wanted to respond to his posts.  I have found 4 members of the sub who were shadow banned before all of this happened, let them know, and now they are un banned.    If you just downvoted his stuff by going through this sub, you are probably ok, since downvotes are allowed.  I believe when you follow him to other subs, and go through his history downvoting that you get into trouble.  I think it can also happen if you are vote brigading (such as linking to a post on another sub here, then downvoting stuff in the other sub).  I have been trying to tell users when they have been shadow banned, so if you get shadow banned, and I find out, I will let you know.  I have been finding shadow banned people by checking the mod queue, seeing things that weren't deleted by the mods, and checking to see if I could see the user page for that user.  If I can't then they are shadow banned."
steelers,397otp,adawg58,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:47:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's nuts. I assume I'm not shadow banned since you were able to see and respond to my comment. Thanks for the explanation."
steelers,397otp,psychoticdream,3,Wed Jun 10 19:54:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah you aren't shadow banned currently.  /r/shadowban is set up to test that.  They have automoderator approve every post, and have some system set up to test if you are, or aren't shadow banned."

Honestly he sounds so insecure and immature, and his calling anyone who disagrees with him a ""Caitlyn Jenner male transitioning to female"" doesn't help. He made a new subreddit where he has gone on the power trip he wanted.  Good luck to him but he sounds like he needs help."
steelers,397otp,rhino43grr,7,Wed Jun 10 02:02:26 2015 UTC,He asked /r/NFL to make his subreddit the one in the sidebar.  This is hilarious.
steelers,397otp,adawg58,3,Wed Jun 10 05:05:07 2015 UTC,His sub is really depressing. It's basically just his own personal subreddit where he can talk to himself and pretend people are paying attention to his downvote gang conspiracy theory. It almost makes me feel bad for him. Almost.

He has created several alts, and at least 7 of them have been banned (though I have every confidence he'll keep creating more, sadly necessitating an enduring game of Whac-A-Mole).  For those who enjoy popcorn, a trip over to /r/ShadowBan may provide some fun - but please, limit yourself to reading; do not interact over there (I embedded a non-participation link for the sake of precaution, but still worth pointing out).  He's been taking advantage of the way that sub configures auto-mod to auto-approve all submissions from banned users, as it's now the only place in all of reddit where he can actually post.  Anyhoo, if you notice this user popping up with more alts, I encourage you to report them to the admins by sending a modmail to /r/reddit.com."
steelers,397otp,IDontNeedThisIndigo,-4,Sun Jun 21 15:56:05 2015 UTC,Somehow he's still not as bad as /u/Social_Psycho.
steelers,399h6e,TombaFan123,7,Wed Jun 10 05:36:24 2015 UTC,I disagree that we have 'a lot' of depth at runningback but I really like Josh Harris. Dri Archer is a runningback by name only and does not possess the ability to ever be an effective between the tackles runner. Harris can fill that role and can be groomed to take over the backup spot once DeAngelo Williams is gone.
steelers,399h6e,ColdNose,3,Wed Jun 10 06:11:41 2015 UTC,By depth I meant that we have talent enough to make the last spot a battle
steelers,399h6e,steelbydesign,4,Wed Jun 10 06:16:33 2015 UTC,"I really hope Harris sticks with the team.   Someone correct me I'm wrong but I believe Le'Veon won't count against the roster while he's suspended... So we'll sure roll with Deangelo Williams, Josh Harris, Will Johnson, and Dri Archer for the first few weeks.  The question becomes who's the odd man out after. I think Harris could be the safest to make it to the practice squad if they cut him... However I'd like to see Harris get some FB snaps in pre-season and use him instead of Will in the rare instances that we even have a FB on the field."
steelers,399h6e,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:36:28 2015 UTC,"I do not believe he counts against the 52 man roster while suspended but I don't know the broader impact (on the practice squad for example).  Also one thing to think about in the whole RB depth chart piece: some have suspected that they may look at Archer as the #5 receiver as opposed to the #3 RB, so if that's the case Harris would have a lot better chance of sticking."
steelers,399h6e,steelbydesign,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:12:59 2015 UTC,"If Archer was going to be a WR, I think you'd already see him working there.  Brown, Bryant, Wheaton, and Coates are locks. I think they like DHB as a special teamer."
steelers,399h6e,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:13:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying actually playing WR full time per se, but being more of a swing guy like De'Anthony Thomas. That way it's not so much Josh beating out Dri as much as it is Josh beating out the #5 WR.   DHB is a heck of a special teamer so I could see him getting a helmet in place of a defensive ST guy."
steelers,399h6e,DF_1982,4,Thu Jun 11 23:22:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me, that Josh has to beat out DeAngelo Williams for a roster spot.  He's not really in competition with Dri, because Dri isn't Le'Veon's backup.  It could happen, but if not, it's practice squad.  It would be nice if he can stay with the team, because DeAngelo won't last too long."
steelers,399h6e,JackLambertsBalls,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:13:28 2015 UTC,But with the injury/suspension to Bell the Steelers would still keep Josh Harris for the first few games?
steelers,399h6e,DF_1982,2,Wed Jun 10 21:09:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think a suspended player counts as a roster spot.  In that case, I would say yes.  I'm not sure how it works though..."
steelers,399h6e,JonVig,2,Thu Jun 11 12:16:01 2015 UTC,"Well Rob Schuereman (I think that's how you spell it) is wearing the number 40 in practice, so I'm not sure if Harris is still with us. I think he has what it takes to be a backup and we could use some more security at the position. I think Dri will see more snaps as a slot guy or screen guy than actually running the ball.   Edit: I'm going to check the rb list and return after I see who is listed."
steelers,399h6e,RenderedInGooseFat,3,Wed Jun 10 10:13:57 2015 UTC,"Looks like he is still on the roster, and may be in awesome shape also.  On the Steelers site, Harris is listed as 25 now, so I guess he changed his number."
steelers,399h6e,JonVig,2,Wed Jun 10 11:33:13 2015 UTC,"Well if he's still on the roster, I think he has a shot at making it. He had some good plays last year that really helped after Blount was released and Bell was injured. I'd also like to see if Schuereman gives him a run for his money, he wasn't too bad and he has some good speed."

Montana got 3yr/$10m, which was too much for us with our commitment to O'Donnell at the time.   I can't believe I remember the rest of this. I was going to say ""I think the cap was $36m that year and the argument was that Montana wanted 10% of it which was too much""  Googled it...1994 was $34.5m and 1995 was $36.5m  It's amazing how you never forget trauma.  But I accept it. Made sense at the time. He just wanted too much money.   He wanted $3.3m/yr.  ROFL"

steelers,396gs2,russbii,7,Tue Jun 9 16:28:53 2015 UTC,"I can look into setting one up later, but don't count on it.  I have off on Friday, so I can look into it then.  I'm not sure if it is possible currently though.  We can't write any javascript, HTML, or really any code in the sidebar.  From what I have read, you basically need a server running the code, that produces an image, that you then point to.  That may be doable, but I don't think we currently have a separate server running, and I'm not sure the work that would be entailed with pointing to that server, from the sidebar.  One other possibility is a bot running somewhere, that has internet access, and mod powers, that updates the sidebar every so often.  That would not be a real countdown timer, as in it would only update after a given timeframe that we would feed it, but it could be set to update every x amount of seconds.  That would be much easier to implement, but would still require something that is on, and available 24 hours a day, and a little bit of coding, and would not be animated or update in real time.  It would basically be static info that updates occasionally."
steelers,396gs2,RenderedInGooseFat,2,Tue Jun 9 17:39:45 2015 UTC,Geeeeez. I didn't know you couldn't have any moving parts in the sidebar. Sounds like way more work than it's worth.
steelers,396gs2,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:48:00 2015 UTC,"Basically everything we can do on the page is static text/images, with css effects.  That allows us to flash/change images, and text, but nothing more complicated than that.  Anything beyond that, and you need an outside source to run whatever code you are using, and you would still just point to a static image produced by that outside code.  Basically the countdown would be an image of a countdown that doesn't refresh, unless you reload the page, or navigate elsewhere in the sub.  It wouldn't be the prettiest solution, but if it was just number of days left, it may not be terrible.  Auto mod allows us to do a little more, but I don't think it can update the sidebar."
steelers,396gs2,Opuski,2,Tue Jun 9 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"I think a ""DAYS LEFT UNTIL FOOTBALL: XX"" solution would be plenty awesome.

I suffered through a decade of fandom watching my beloved team fall from grace at the hands of the cow-pies in Super Bowl XXX....  And then a shimmering glimmer of hope emerged in Thomas Gunz Maddox...  Who as luck would have it suffered the now infamous spinal concussion at the game you attended.  We lost the game, but Ben's poise and dominance was clear... And then we went 15-1."

We can all speculate and based on what I've read recently a few beat writers do t believe beachum will be extended.  I thinks that's crazy and he's performing.  Tunch is working with him a lot and he really beefed up in a good way this off season.  What we as fans should realize is that the steelers don't give a damn what the media reports.  Wallace didn't want to sign? The steelers offered big money to a semi unproven wr in Brown.  Who could have predicated that was going to occur?  I want beachum signed.  I could see foster signing on the cheap to stay BUT the steelers are going to be the Steelers.  I personally look to wexell more than anyone else but I've come to really enjoy DK.  Its the off season and things are slow, speculating that a couple of our lineman in their final year might get resigned really isn't worth reading.  Its pretty obvious to even the most casual fan.

All I see is a message from you to our mods, and a message from /u/SmC-Twelve, who is a Patriots fan, and didn't threaten you in any of those posts.  Don't post a link to imgur.  Post the exact words where you feel your life was threatened.  I see nothing threatening in anything you posted.    Every single thing you have posted for the past month or so has been reported as being a shit post, but almost all of them were let through, since it is the most down time there is in the offseason.  Then you started being an all around ass hat, on top of shit posting, which is why you were warned by the mods.  People aren't following you down voting you because they are trolls.  They are doing it because they don't like your content, and think they are shit posts.  The mods don't really encourage any type of content, especially in the offseason, and especially at this point in the offseason, where there is no news.  If we were really trying to block the type of content you have been posting, don't you think we would have just deleted every one of your posts, and banned you?  We are trying to give you every possible chance to not get banned, since you have been posting here for a while, but you are making it very tough.

And my brother and I will keep the party going as long as we can i'm sure.  We both like live music and great pubs.  Not into clubbing or anything.      But during the day, I would like to see the sights for sure.  We are all big sports guys.  Dad is a broadcaster.  We owned a radio station growing up.  And he still does a sports show every Sunday.   When the NHL schedule comes out, we are praying for a home game on the weekend.  But if not,  is there anything worth going to see as far as the penguins go?"

steelers,38sqfg,mrsammercer,3,Sat Jun 6 15:02:33 2015 UTC,"The Sheraton is a good recommendation as you will have immediate access to good food, night life, and, ultimately, a ride via boat to the stadium.    As for other hot spots to consider, go to the strip district for food, local vendors of all sorts (including Steelers gear) or go to the southside for food, night life, bars, etc. Primanti Bros is a top tourist restaurant and is located in the southside or downtown.  my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant, if you don't mind a dive, is Big Jim's in the run, which is in theGreenfield neighborhood. They have the best Italian food I have had anywhere. You will get enough food for two large meals and at a low cost."
steelers,38sqfg,whosjellisnow,3,Sat Jun 6 15:43:57 2015 UTC,"My favorite thing to do on a Saturday afternoon is to chill in the Strip district. Start out at DeLuca's, Kelly O's or Pamela's for breakfast. Or skip that and just eat street food. Stop at Wigle distillery for a cocktail. Then just kinda walk around.  Week 13 is, what, early December? As long as it's not really cold there should still be stuff going on there."

steelers,38sqfg,Treacy,3,Sat Jun 6 18:01:10 2015 UTC,"My opinion on just the game. Go @ 8:30-9am. Bring a cooler with alcoholic (or non, whatever) beverages, and if possible bring a small portable hibachi. Bring and setup lawn chairs. Dress appropriately. If you think you are just good enough warmth wise, pack another 2 layers. Pretend you are camping out basically. Walk around the different lots, get sauced, talk to other steeler fans.. like drunk vikings reminsce, argue or shed a tear for some of your favorite moments communally. Stop drinking 1 to 1 1/2 hours before the game. Do not drink during the game. That will give you 5 hours or so to sober up. If your not OK to drive, wait out some more over by the car. Stopping drinking ample time before the game is huge though. As a season ticket holder since the early 70's.. this is what reminds me of proper full regalia Steeler Sunday the most.  Edit : have a jersey and a terrible towel.. folded and tucked into pants preferably ready to wave"

steelers,38sqfg,AshKatchup,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"In that case, be sure to visit the Heinz History Center in the Strip District part of town.  It has the Western PA Sports Museum there which you might be interested in.    The Strip varies depending on when you visit.  It's a spot for night life but it's great in the day as well.  Some of the greatest places to get breakfast are there including Deluca's and Pamela's as well as some great cafes like Enrico Biscotti.  During the day you can check out some little specialty shops, I recommend visiting Mike Feinberg Company for authentic Steeler and other sports related gear.  There's nothing like shopping in the Strip District on a Saturday morning in the run up to Christmas.  Also, it has the original Primanti Bros.  I know the local PBS station WQED gives tours of their multimedia facilities, including the Fred Rogers studios (he's a legend here).  I'm not sure if they'll have a date to schedule for when you're here though as it might still be on Tuesdays and Thursdays only.  The studios are in the Oakland section of the city where the universities are.  Oakland also has the Carnegie Museum of Natural History which I think would be a great place to check out, as well as Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens.  If your dad is a veteran, stop in and see Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall too.    There really is a lot to do here contrary to popular belief so it's wise that you're planning ahead so you can squeeze in more things to do.  Before you go, be sure to ride one of the inclines up to Mt. Washington to get a few pictures of one of the best views in the country."

And, honestly not to suck up, I would not want to engage anywhere else...especially that nfl cesspool.  So, maybe pull back a bit. Try healthy engagement with the members of this community.

steelers,38ywzs,Diarygirl,0,Wed Jun 10 17:43:47 2015 UTC,Because it differentiates between a transgender male and a non-transgender male.
steelers,38ywzs,klubsanwich,2,Wed Jun 10 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"See the thing is, and I just know someone will find this offensive, I understand you'd be talking about a non-transgender male or ""cis male"" (douchechills) if you just said male. There is no need to say non-transgender. Now if you're talking about a transgender male, yes I would guess that is something not normal, so it makes sense to say ""transgender male"" in context. Because a LARGE majority of the population is not transgender, this makes sense. Because a LARGE majority of the population is not, let's say in a wheelchair, we don't have to label someone as a non-wheelchair bound male or female or whatever the fuck. This does not mean we still don't accommodate them though. To me it's simply a ridiculous term that is used to divide rather than unify EVERYONE."

Mind you, I didn't come to this realization overnight, but if someone's born a female and they identify as male, then to me they're a male.

steelers,38olc9,MUCKSTERa,2,Sat Jun 6 00:03:31 2015 UTC,I think he could be pretty damn good. He does a lot of holistic and metaphysical training which leads to having really good balance and a pristine mental state.   To snowboard well you need both of those things. You need to be able to relax and maintain balance. Troy's got that.

steelers,38sns0,DeadHeadAhead,5,Sat Jun 6 13:54:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly being in a different system would have changed how is was as a QB. Also being 25 miles from his hometown, he would have had so much pressure on him to play well. The the defense was starting to slow down as we were losing players from the championship teams once he entered the league. Our drafting wasn't as good as the 49er drafts either.   Too many factors to play what if."
steelers,38sns0,Traderious,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:32:30 2015 UTC,"Well, we already know how things turned out having Mark Malone, Bubby Brister and Neil O'Donnell as our QB's. I'm pretty sure that we would have had a much better chance with the best QB to play the game behind center."
steelers,38sns0,Traderious,4,Sat Jun 6 16:30:49 2015 UTC,"He may have not been the best QB in Pittsburgh. Same thing goes for Brady. Had Bledsoe not gotten injured, Brady wouldn't have got a shot and you never would have heard of him. There are way too many factors as to why things end the way they did.   We had Bradshaw in his prime when Joe was drafted. Now with the QB'S you threw in there, if you said that about Marino with Bradshaw in his final years then yeah I could agree with that logic."
steelers,38sns0,k__e__n,2,Sat Jun 6 19:15:26 2015 UTC,Yeah Marino was definitely the what could have been QB.
steelers,38o9ra,cpurcell34,7,Fri Jun 5 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"1.) The two point conversion rules don't really change much, kickers are still reliable from the 15 yard line. 2.) Suisham is one of the most reliable kickers from mid-range. 3.) Our redzone offense has been weak (I think it's mostly our power-blocking). 4.) I had a 4th point but I forgot it."

steelers,38o9ra,Prowlerbaseball,2,Fri Jun 5 16:05:08 2015 UTC,"I think this rule change can really benefit a team like the Steelers. A quick Google search showed me that NFL teams have a 47.9 percent success rate on two-point conversions. I think the Steelers have enough offensive weapons and talent to convert more often than most other teams, most likely above 50%."
steelers,38o9ra,reppapalooza,2,Fri Jun 5 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"Since 2001, the Steelers lead the league in 2-point percentage at 72.7 percent, according to ESPN Stats and Info. The New York Jets are last in the league at 27.7 percent."

steelers,38o9ra,Half_left,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:35:13 2015 UTC,I like it as a danger-zone trick thing. Just like that one play every year that we run that tricks everyone and either looks wildly stupid or stupidly awesome.   I think playing it safe with one-point could be better then trying to always go for the 2-point. I would like to see maybe a 2-point play exercised in preseason and see how that does - but again either keep it in the Steel Hat of tricks or as a comeback tool.

steelers,38lyoj,Diarygirl,3,Fri Jun 5 05:53:19 2015 UTC,"Deebo as a teammate and Porter as a coach is going to do wonders for JJ, Bud, and Flex Luthor. I have huge confidence in them. We likely won't see them break out this season (at least, not all of them) but just like what Tomlin said about Bryant, I think we'll see them improve with every snap that they're on the field.  And from the looks of OTA videos that have been released, Taylor is taking on some sort of coaching role already. That bodes well for Golson and Grant, and could help Cortez break out of his funk.  God damn, it's way too hard to not get overly optimistic during the offseason. I just want the preseason to get here. I'll even take the HoF game at this point :("
steelers,38lyoj,MichelangeBro,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:16:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I didn't know about Ike taking a coaching role.  That makes me happy.  I think the reason Cortez infuriates me is I know he's talented and can do better."
steelers,38lyoj,Diarygirl,2,Sat Jun 6 02:44:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know for certain that he is coaching, but the videos they've released from OTAs show him in a t-shirt and hat ordering around and giving advice, so I would think that's the case. Maybe not yet officially, but it could be coming down the pipes.  I really hope so, because Ike has always had one of the most likable and hard-working personalities on this team. I don't want him going anywhere!"
steelers,38lyoj,MichelangeBro,2,Sat Jun 6 03:31:03 2015 UTC,"Ohh thank you for that!  Ike doesn't get the respect he should.  He got way more interceptions than people will ever give him credit for, and like you said, super likable and hardworking."

However the guys being labeled for breakouts really should be heading for breakouts.  Bryant played in spots just like tuitt and absolutely tore it up.

Needless to say, I'm a diehard Stillers fan and often make fun of the hapless Bears.  Anyway, this game is by far my favorite game of all time.  It was a thing of beauty.  The significance.  The Bus.  The snow.  The fact it was against my asshole father-in-law's Bears.  It was just a perfect Sunday afternoon football game. I have a cherished photo of Jerome's knee hitting Urlacher's head framed in my basement Stillers' bar, here in Chi-town.  Cheers!"
steelers,38k71f,AsianCarp,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:39:18 2015 UTC,That was beautiful. The first NFL game I ever watched was SB40. And I've been trying to track down a copy of this game ever since lol

I like the Bears, a hell of a lot more than the Packers!, and that moment where Bettis runs over Urlacher was magic. We are the hard hitting team of the NFL.   This was also a major turning point. The Steelers started out 7-2 and fell to 3 straight losses going to 7-5. People said no way we'd win that game and the team dialed it in for Bettis' last season. And it was Bettis, himself, that ignited and lifted that team to what was a Super Bowl winning season. The second best moment I had ever witnessed as a Steelers fan, the best was the season before when people said that Ben will get wrecked by the genius of Belichek which gave way to us demolishing the Pats and the 21 and DONE. Iconic image was when a Steelers DB ran a pick six back with a convoy of blockers. Was a major Steelers image even up until recently.  ""Hard hitting football baby, Pittsburgh style!""   -The BUS"

This game reminds me of the old NFL films games were it was cold and tough, two defensive minded teams going at it, and to make it better the Steelers win! One of my favorite games and really just a miracle season, Bettis last year with a chance to win in his home town and  Rothlisberger's tackle!"

I'd question your characterization of Bryant's absence for the first six games as being a coach's decision, though. He was injured in the preseason (shoulder, I think) and I remember some early speculation he might be a candidate for the IR-designated to return list. I'm sure the coaches didn't rush him into action, but one has to assume his development was delayed at least slightly by that injury."

Not Sanders, although Wallace certainly made a bad choice (although not a bad financial choice, can't blame him there), chemistry just wasn't there for Sanders; not sure if it was chemistry between him and Ben, him and the system, or just a combination of factors, but I think its hard to argue that the explosion he saw in Denver would have happened with us had he stayed."

Reminds me of a part of Warner's football life where Fitzgerald talks about how Kurt pushed him to not settle for ""good enough"" but aim for ""best""  Here's to the offense living up to their potential, go get Ben the MVP (or at least offensive player of the year) and the team another Lombardi.

Only difference between Davis and Rooney, honestly, was that Rooney wasn't as vocal or liberal. He more or less kept to himself.  It seems like we're also villains, we just never embraced the moniker. I think we are villains, I just hope we can one day embrace it considering there is so much disdain for our team.

I don't care about having a debate one way or another, but plenty of people won't cheer for a team headed by a twice-accused rapist. Doesn't matter whether he is or isn't innocent. Six Super Bowls. I don't think there are many who really care, but it might be a minor factor. A huge fanbase. Some people might simply be annoyed because of how big and widespread our fanbase is. On the other side, a big fanbase means a large volume of idiot fans, who are often the most vocal, painting the rest of us bad. Like those who call us Sixburgh or who always bring up Super Bowls when it comes to discussing good teams. History of success. We've only had seven sub-500 seasons since 1972. That can rub people the wrong way.   Villain Anti-Points:   Some other very likable, young players. Brown, Bell, Bryant, Heyward, Timmons, etc. As someone else mentioned, people have a short memory. We went to the Super Bowl in 2010 and lost. Our most recent victory was in 2008. Since then, we haven't made it past the Wild Card round. Some people might not view us as one of the ""top tier teams"" right now, so they don't bother hating us. We play old-school ball. Or at least, we tend toward that. Right now we have a top-tier passing offense, but we still have potentially the best RB in the league, and have typically focused on our defense rather than offense. Other fans may appreciate that.   Meh, I'm sure there's more, but that's the gist."

When the Steelers come to town, other teams don't play them with a feeling of hate or malice. They play them knowing that they are quite probably about to get smacked in the mouth, and it will take everything they've got to come away with a vitctory.

steelers,38aexl,zjrk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:45:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there's not one call in that game I would call terrible. Seahawks refuse to believe that their offense just couldn't get out of their own way in that game."

steelers,389nr7,saggy_balls,7,Tue Jun 2 21:38:17 2015 UTC,I don't think he was nearly as bad as everyone keeps saying.  It's all a little over dramatic. He was noticeably better when troy wasn't on the field.
steelers,389nr7,DriArcher,4,Tue Jun 2 23:00:03 2015 UTC,I imagine it's difficult to play both safety positions at the same time.

steelers,389nr7,-deteled-,3,Fri Jun 5 05:46:01 2015 UTC,I 100% agree. He was far from great out there but he was even close to the biggest problem in the secondary last season.
steelers,389nr7,tahmoose,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:56:04 2015 UTC,He had to cover for Troy's mistakes so many times plus play through injury because Troy was hurt. Show some goddamn respect.
steelers,389nr7,zjrk,2,Wed Jun 3 01:10:46 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone realizes just how much Clark did while Polamalu was doing his thing. He was an incredible safety who covered all of the earth while Troy was free-wheeling. I bet we see Mitchell get better strictly because he will be playing more traditionally.

They should be available already, but they don't appear to be on the ticketmaster website.  Last year, I think they were available May 12.  It will be a limited number of seats, and will likely sell out though, when they do go on sale.  You are most likely going to have to use NFL Ticket Exchange or something like Stubhub.  This article gives a little bit of info about ticket pricing, and says they will go on sale in June."

steelers,387xoh,RenderedInGooseFat,2,Tue Jun 2 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"There are some tickets already on each, likely from season ticket holders.  Here is the link to stubhub Steelers tickets, and here is NFL Ticket Exchange.  Crappy seats will run you about $100-$130 per ticket, while lower level will be a couple hundred dollars each for now, although depending on how the team does, that could go down.  You are definitely paying over face value on each of those, but you may not have much of a choice.  I would suggest just checking for news of individual ticket sales every day, and maybe following the Steelers twitter account, then try to get tickets through ticket master as quickly as possible."

steelers,384k6l,ImPhelpsingIt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:02:02 2015 UTC,I think Brown is more likely to make the top 10 than Bell is
steelers,384k6l,huet99,5,Tue Jun 2 18:31:03 2015 UTC,"Based off of the voting prior to the official listing, Bell received 0 votes. However, it could've just been NFL. com not showing all of the votes"
steelers,384k6l,zb9194,3,Mon Jun 1 22:35:47 2015 UTC,AB should definitely be in the top 10 and I think there is a chance Bell breaks the top 10 but probably falls in the 11-20 range. Ben I see either being in the 11-20 or 21-30.

steelers,384k6l,SomerTime,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:38:05 2015 UTC,Bell is a consensus top 3 rb but I do think this survey to the players needs clarified. It seems to me that they often treat it as a full body of work to some extent instead of just the previous season.
steelers,384k6l,deverhartdu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:34:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. To give the most glaring example I can remember - the year after he didn't play a single down, Peyton Manning was voted number 50."
steelers,3845or,beerandcoffee,20,Mon Jun 1 18:51:01 2015 UTC,I would think the Steelers FO would be crazy not to retain a top-ten LT for a bottom-ten LT salary.
steelers,3845or,enz1ey,6,Mon Jun 1 19:00:28 2015 UTC,"I would think you're right. Besides, the Steelers like to sign their own FAs. At the very least Beachum will get an offer."

steelers,3845or,steelbydesign,2,Mon Jun 1 19:13:13 2015 UTC,"No, but I really don't think he'd be targeted by many teams for much more than that. I could see him being paid somewhere mid-range, but if the Steelers offer him something fair then the odds of him signing are high. This article makes it sound like they aren't interested in even making him an offer, which would be ridiculous."
steelers,3845or,enz1ey,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:16:34 2015 UTC,No way he gets a bottom 10 salary. He's getting at least 8M a year.

That, does not = the team won't extend him this off-season."
steelers,3845or,steelbydesign,2,Mon Jun 1 19:18:56 2015 UTC,Why would we give this guy's money to Gilbert?
steelers,3845or,social_psycho,3,Tue Jun 2 01:49:12 2015 UTC,I'm curious to see what numbers you guys would pay Beachum..  Is 5yr/$40M (w/ a team option for a 6th year at a lower annual price in case he tears his knee) too much considering what we already have vested in the O-line?
steelers,3845or,Ogaminator,7,Mon Jun 1 19:36:46 2015 UTC,Honestly I would take him at 5yr/40mil.
steelers,3845or,CeeBeast,3,Mon Jun 1 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"I would too, I think best case scenario he takes like 5/$35M but with a little bit more guaranteed. Wonder what DeCastro will sign for.."
steelers,3845or,Ogaminator,4,Mon Jun 1 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"DeCastro already made lots of money in the league compared to Beachum. I suspect that will just mean he's going to want more, if anything."
steelers,3845or,1htaehn,2,Tue Jun 2 14:04:17 2015 UTC,I'm concerned that after we pay Heyward $60mil (see: Cameron Jordan deal) there won't be enough money to throw at both Beachum and DeCastro.
steelers,3845or,Ogaminator,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:58:46 2015 UTC,I'm thinking the same thing.
steelers,3845or,1htaehn,3,Tue Jun 2 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"That's probably what they'd offer him, I'd say a decent amount of it would be guaranteed. He's rarely hurt and one of our more dependable linemen. If definitely take him at that price."
steelers,3845or,enz1ey,2,Mon Jun 1 20:18:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. Nothing flashy about him but he just gets the job done.
steelers,3845or,Ogaminator,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing for me is this: Beachum is going to want to stay with the Steelers. Nothing looks better for an o-lineman than playing with top-tier talent around him - and a HoF coach.  If he decides to test FA after his second contract, he could be in line for a huge payday -- or maybe the Steelers can pay the man at that point.  Either way, I think the Steelers get something of a hometown discount because of the fact that we're putting him in such an excellent position to succeed."

steelers,37yorx,corywyn,2,Sun May 31 23:47:37 2015 UTC,Honestly.  Without a doubt he has been out best addition in the past 2-3 offseasons

steelers,37yorx,MichelangeBro,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:43:41 2015 UTC,"No doubt.  He brings a fire to the LB group that we definitely needed.  That said, I don't think he is at the level of Munch quite yet, if not simply due to lack of coaching experience"
steelers,37yorx,wok_into_mordor,2,Mon Jun 1 14:49:41 2015 UTC,"For sure. I wasn't saying that he's had more of an impact than Munch has. We had such a crap O-line before he got here, and now a lot of people have us in conversation for top 5-ish. That's all Munch."
steelers,37yorx,MichelangeBro,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'd give Haley a lot of credit for that as well. As his system has taken hold we've seen an improvement everywhere. He has a rep for getting the most out of players, just like munch."

steelers,37yorx,MaHab133,2,Sun May 31 17:25:37 2015 UTC,Munchak and the players can be really proud of how they played and turned around what was once a very leaky OL. Without them we wouldn't be in the conversation for a top 3 offense.

I don't think arm-chair-sports writers with internet connections have a fucking idea of what this season will hold.  Additionally, now that Munch is a year in, and has our O-Line ""all learned up"" I think you've seen the best of what you're going to get with the current crew.  I have all the faith in the world that our O-Line will be eaten alive by the AFC North pass-rushers this season.  Between Cincy, Cleveland, and Baltimore... the sacks from those 6-games will account for at least 90% of the sacks that Ben has on the season.    All the sheeple on this sub will point to how well the line ""congealed"" after someone on it gets hurt, and how over the ""final 5 games.."" ""...they played commendably.""  And I'll be sitting there, alone, yet again... laughing, knowing that our O-Line barely performed to NFL standards.  And everyone on here will be predicting DB 1st round again next year, as we have yet to go CB in the 1st since Chad Scott, who sucked by the way....  And I'll be here 11-months from now, hoping that Goodburger finally proved how big of a liability he was... how Adams finally succumbed to Darwinsim... and how Beechum proved his worth as an NFL caliber guard, but not yet as a tackle.    And in 11-months, again... regardless of how this season goes... I'll predict OT 1st Rd.  And will do so, year after year... not as a troll but as a student of the game...  until we finally do draft it...  And when we draft it, I'll post a picture of my nutsack with the Steeler emblem drawn on it in sharpie..."

steelers,37yorx,stealthycanadian,3,Mon Jun 1 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"Well the reason there seems to be a consensus among armchair sports writers is because it's...you know...factually true. Kind of like how everyone agrees that the sky is blue even if they're not scientists who can explain how blue has the shortest wavelength of the colors and as such is most easily dispersed when sunlight hits the earth's atmosphere. Even those who are colorblind accept it as fact, and they can't even see the blue sky to begin with! They just don't trust their own flawed analysis.  And besides that, you don't even need to listen to ""armchair analysts."" Just look at what the Steelers themselves did. They didn't take an OT in the first round. Or the second. Or third. Or fourth. Or fifth. Or with the first of their sixth round picks. Or with the second of their sixth round picks. Or seventh. Did not draft a single offensive lineman, made absolutely no effort to improve the position...possibly because it doesn't need to be improved? Don't need to be an armchair analyst to figure out what the team themselves are or are not prioritizing."
steelers,37yorx,Steinerway,-1,Mon Jun 1 21:33:28 2015 UTC,So you're saying there's a chance?
steelers,37yorx,dmremic,2,Mon Jun 1 22:45:29 2015 UTC,"There's a chance that they try to improve the starting OL? Given that free agency and the draft are both done, no. I don't know if you missed it, but in case you did I'll tell you that we signed a running back and drafted some linebackers and DBs. And a TE. Some more depth at WR too. You know, the positions that your hated ""armchair analysts"" identified as the needs instead of OL.  Looks like the team listens to those armchair analysts! And does what they suggest! Or maybe the armchair analysts were simply correct."
steelers,37yorx,Steinerway,0,Mon Jun 1 23:49:44 2015 UTC,"Did you really just suggest that the Steelers front office looks at r/steelers for advice on who to draft?    You are one of the more in-depth posters on here, but holy shit... That's a dense thing to even imply."
steelers,37yorx,dmremic,2,Tue Jun 2 00:40:14 2015 UTC,"I suggest you reread my post and reconsider the context.  You say you don't think the armchair sportswriters have any sort of idea, so you don't trust their analysis that the team doesn't consider OL to be a priority and won't address it, especially in the first round.  It turns out that team does not address OL this offseason, let alone not going near it in the first round. So why is that? In my post, I proposed two reasons why the team did not go OL:   The team reads what these armchair analysts have to say and believes them when the they say that the team does not need anyone new along the OL. The armchair analysts were correct, and the team did not believe OL was a priority. And the team came to this conclusion without consulting /r/steelers Beachum is a very good left tackle, Gilbert is a good right tackle, the starters do not need to be touched. And as facts have it, the starters were not touched this offseason.   Now, you yourself say that one would have to be dense to even imply that the first option is the answer. Therefore, in your own words, the armchair analysts were correct in their assertion that OL is not a need. So where does that leave you and your belief that it is one?  Or, in more Reddit-esque terms: Whoosh"

steelers,37uudy,snookyface90210,0,Mon Jun 1 01:05:23 2015 UTC,I think he replaces Wheaton but not this year. In fact he could end up taking snaps from Bryant if Bryant doesn't work out.
steelers,37uudy,tonytroz,2,Mon Jun 1 01:08:06 2015 UTC,"This. Bryant had his big plays off of mostly go routes. He wasn't even close to having enough routes down to be a consistent slot receiver, let alone an X or Z. Wheaton hasn't produced but he's been in the system long enough to control his own fate with his #2/#3 job. The reason kids like Coates go in the middle rounds is because they aren't ready for that. He might have the talent to replace Wheaton eventually, but it takes more than talent to play every down."
steelers,37uudy,snookyface90210,2,Mon Jun 1 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"I have faith in Bryant based on what I saw in the last two games, but not based on his stats. I think people are way too confident in him at this point. He is by no means a sure thing."
steelers,37uudy,UnicornFondler,0,Mon Jun 1 18:03:28 2015 UTC,"The only reason Bryant became active was because the Steelers had no WR depth.

Some players have strengths in one facet of the position while deficiencies in the other, Bell was pretty much all strength. Probably the one thing keeping him from being perfect is his top-end speed, but you're born with that and there's nothing he can do about it. And he's more than making up for it.  I'll admit that while I didn't think Bell would be bad, per se, I wasn't particularly happy that we passed on Arthur Brown. Man am I glad that I was wrong. It's awesome to think that at age 23 and entering his third year, even after last season we can still say he's going to be special."

steelers,37qi99,stuckmeformypaper,-6,Fri May 29 19:31:25 2015 UTC,"He needs to stop smoking weed first. He's got incredible talent but if he gets popped again I doubt the Steelers front office will want to keep him much longer.  One of the reasons we all love the Steelers so much is that they don't put up with too many off field issues.  The Steelers are a blue collar, nose to the grindstone, work your ass off and earn your place on the field kind of organization (see James Harrison). Ben had his share but following his suspension he shaped the fuck up. Here's to hoping Bell does exactly the same.  EDIT: Oh crap, I mentioned stopping weed on reddit. Bracing for the downvote army."
steelers,37qi99,professorbooty25,15,Fri May 29 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"""Marijuana is not an important thing for me,"" he said. ""It's something I easily can set by. If I wanted to do it later on down my life, I'll enjoy it later on. It's something that got me in trouble. Football is what I love. I love the game of football and nothing will come to jeopardize that.""  Hopefully we can take him at his word."
steelers,37qi99,Steinerway,2,Fri May 29 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"That part where he mentions partaking later in life, that's pretty non-standard. Sounds genuine."

steelers,37qi99,Steinerway,5,Sat May 30 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"Well the downvote army has come for a couple of reasons, and neither are ""mentioning weed.""   Bell has strongly indicated that he already has stopped smoking weed, so this comment is kind of unnecessary. Ironic (and dare I say somewhat hypocritical) that you mention Harrison as a role model and how the Steelers don't put up with off the field issues. He was arrested for assault around the same time as Cedrick Wilson. Wilson was cut. Harrison was not. Not to say the team was wrong to have that kind of double-standard, the harsh truth is that this is still a business and you'll try to keep your best players at all costs while guys who are regularly deep down the depth chart are expendable. But it definitely seems like the reality contradicts the point you're trying to make.   Bell has said many times that he accepts he did something wrong, he's accepting his punishment, and he will never let it happen again. What's the point of bringing up the mistake in an article discussing his play on the field?"
steelers,37qi99,maninorbit,-7,Fri May 29 22:16:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry I don't suck Bell's dick and hang in his every word all season. Bottom line, he broke the law, he'll sit on the sideline for 3 games because he was acting like a selfish imbecile. I know a lot of fucktard pot heads who are capable of saying, ""I'll never do it again"" but couldn't pass a drug test if their lives depended on it. Talk is cheap. The only way to prove anything in the NFL is on the fucking field, the field he won't play on till the 4th game of the season."
steelers,37qi99,Steinerway,6,Sat May 30 00:02:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds like I hit a nerve. That was a bit of a strong response based on your own speculation and cynicism, though I'm surprised you ignored the part about Harrison. I'm sorry that you know people who like to say ""I'll never again do a drug that has been factually, objectively, beyond a doubt proven to not be as dangerous as alcohol,"" and then do it again. But that's not quite a reflection on Bell."
steelers,37qi99,maninorbit,-9,Sat May 30 00:05:11 2015 UTC,Nobody cares pothead. Go Wiz Kalifa your life away.
steelers,37qi99,Steinerway,4,Sat May 30 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"You'll probably choose not to believe me, but I actually am not a smoker myself. Though I do enjoy a couple Wiz Khalifa songs, he's got a couple catchy tunes that get me pumped up when I'm about to play pickup ball with friends or while I'm on a run. But I digress. Anyway, I just allow facts to do the talking.  THC, and even nicotine used in many tobacco products, do not have the negative effects of your body than ethanol, found in alcohol. The worst long-term effect of THC that has been found so far is reduced memory. As opposed to, say, lung cancer through smoking tobacco or liver cancer via alcohol. Alcohol tends to invoke more aggression and somewhat violent tendencies, marijuana is more of a relaxer. Anecdotal so given your predisposition you'll choose to ignore it, but I've heard that people consider driving while under the influence of marijuana is not only less dangerous than driving while intoxicated, but also less so than driving while sober but overtired. A parole officer I know has said that he would MUCH rather try to interact with a parolee high on marijuana rather than one drunk on alcohol.  That's just the tip of the iceberg though, I myself am not an expert. I'm just relaying facts and information, I urge you to look up some studies and literature on the subject.  As far as the legal ramifications, you're right Le'Veon did break the law and I'm not against his punishment and suspension. I'm against judging him as a person and trying to bring up the incident in a discussion about his play on the field, but I'm not against his punishment. That said, there are many things that have been illegal over the years that have since become legal as we learn and become educated. Marijuana is one of those things. Studies are done, we are learning, we see that not only is marijuana not as dangerous as drugs found in legal substances like tobacco and alcohol, in many ways it is less dangerous. And as such, it is slowly being decriminalized, beginning in Alaska, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Washington State. And especially with the results from those states (lower crime rate, booming economy) -against the wishes of the people such as yourself who allow their assumptions to come before objective facts- it will continue and my estimation is that by the end of this century, all 50 states will have legalized marijuana for recreational use. With parameters similar to those concerning alcohol and tobacco, of course. But legal nonetheless. So forgive me if I don't judge a person for participating in an activity that is not unsafe and should and will be legalized within our lifetimes."
steelers,37qi99,professorbooty25,-6,Sat May 30 00:47:52 2015 UTC,"That's cool and all. But it is illegal. Completely illegal. And while under contract and getting paid large sums of money to play football dowing illegal ass shit gets you suspended. And when you get suspended you can't play football.   This is a football subreddit, I like the football players of my favorite football team on the football field playing MOTHER FUCKING FOOTBALL. I didn't come here to debate with weed lovers how good or bad THC is. I honestly couldn't care less. UNTIL MOTHER FUCKING LA'VEON BELL CAN PROVE THAT HE HAS STOPPED SMOKING POT BY NEVER GETTING CAUGHT WITH MOTHER FUCKING WEED NOBODY GIVES A RATS ASS WHAT HE SAYS OR PROMISES TO DO. Shut the fuck up and go score touchdowns."
steelers,37qi99,Steinerway,5,Sat May 30 01:35:09 2015 UTC,"I addressed the part about it being illegal. And also, I addressed the fact that I'm not a weed lover. I'm indifferent about it. I'm a truth, fact, and objective information lover. And if someone allows misconceptions to cloud their judgement on the character (to put it lightly concerning your trigger of emotions) of a person, then I may aim to address those misconceptions. And if I were you, I wouldn't really say ""I don't want it,"" or ""I don't care."" Yeah this is an internet message board about football...but what kind of attitude or even life philosophy is it to say ""I know there's science out there that proves my stance wrong...but I don't want to hear it!""  And ironic that you're trying to say you couldn't care less and only care about touchdowns. This is a thread about him as a player, who's the first person in this entire sub who brought up something concerning Bell outside of football? I'll give you a hint: It was you."

steelers,37qi99,NotJoeyWheeler,3,Fri May 29 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"Are you saying he wouldn't have smoked weed or wouldn't have gotten caught?  Hell for all I know him getting caught so early in his career might be for the best if he cuts it out and grows up quicker than he otherwise would have.  I'm hoping for the best, and I'm a very optimistic sports fan so he will have my full support until he fucks up again."
steelers,37qi99,dj0,5,Fri May 29 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"To be more specific:  I just think that entire ""let's get high and then you drive us to the team plane"" plan was Blount's.  I don't think the DUI incident would have occurred without his influence.  It just doesn't jibe with what we know about Bell.  For what it's worth, I think the league's stance on weed is stupid.  I wish there were an NFLPA-driven effort to change it.  I also, of course, think that it's bad for the Steelers when its superstars get suspended.  I guess I don't really care if Bell avoids suspension via abstinence or being careful, so long as he avoid suspension."

BUT, in the ""words"" arena, I've read or heard pretty much everything he's said since he joined the team, including his reaction to the incident.  I've also read or heard pretty much everything any Steelers reporter has said about him, and what his teammates have said about him.  Repeat all that to a lesser degree for Blount.  In the ""actions"" arena, you can look at what we know about Bell and Blount's respective histories.  How they've behaved as players and teammates.  In a legal trial, I couldn't affirm that this is true ""beyond a reasonable doubt.""  Maybe 99% sure is too high.

steelers,37qkm2,MattEven,34,Fri May 29 18:46:56 2015 UTC,He's looking good but he's def not bigger than Dupree.  I'm also certain he's not stronger.  Dupree is a damn freak of nature.  Either way I've always been a Jones supporter.  I expect him to tear it up this season health permitting.
steelers,37qkm2,Rorbotron,12,Fri May 29 16:56:18 2015 UTC,Dunno why you're being downvoted Bud is definitely bigger.
steelers,37qkm2,TombaFan123,7,Fri May 29 18:10:32 2015 UTC,Who knows.  Dupree is almost 270 pounds and lean.  You can't appreciate how big he is because his arms are covered and he's not right up next to Jones but Dupree is a very large dude.
steelers,37qkm2,Rorbotron,3,Fri May 29 18:13:12 2015 UTC,plus he's wearing long black sleeves and black is slimming
steelers,37qkm2,Steelering,3,Fri May 29 23:07:24 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I think Jones looks great.  What's crazy to me is how lean Dupree appears but he's carrying 270 pounds.  The Steelers definitely drafted him on his potential AND if he successfully adds a few moves to his arsenal he will be absolutely ridiculous.  If he had more rush moves we would have never been able to draft him.
steelers,37qkm2,Rorbotron,2,Sat May 30 01:05:44 2015 UTC,"I'm shocked we were able to draft him in the first place. I know he has a lot of work to do, but Clowney was the #1 overall pick last year and talked about as a generational defender, yet Bud blew his numbers out of the water in terms of speed and explosiveness. He also has a much better work ethic."

steelers,37qkm2,steelbydesign,2,Fri May 29 21:07:54 2015 UTC,If you're not conditioning along with bulking that is how you get hurt. I look at it this way. It is easier for most to keep up in the weigh room in the off season than keep up with conditioning. So a lot of dudes bulk up in the off season for this reason. Now the issues and injuries come when you take that extra weight you've gained in the off season and try to start doing all these explosive work outs as if you were still at full season speed. This  why we are seeing more and more Achilles and knee tears in the summer time. I know this is probably more in depth than necessary but the recent amount  of  off season injuries as it relates to training fascinates me greatly.

steelers,37mal1,HunterAHomistek,5,Thu May 28 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"Disagree for the following reasons:   Point No. 1: The difficult schedule  This one is easy. The Steelers like to play at the level of their competition; the bigger the game the better (or so it seems). The 2008 squad was facing the toughest NFL schedule in over 30 years and went on to win it all. Point No. 2: The defense isn't still bad...it's worse  The D is definitely a bit of a question mark with a new coordinator, but the system shouldn't be changing all that much. True, Troy/Brett/Ike are all gone, but they didn't contribute much last year anyways. The leadership may be missed, but it opens up room for some of the younger guys to take over as leaders. This is a young group with a lot of potential and a very low bar set last season. Point No. 3: Injury  As the article says, this is a cop-out response. Sure, injuries could have a huge impact on the outcome of the season -- but predicting injuries to key players isn't really the point of offseason predictions."

If a team gets hot and things start clicking nothing can stop the Steelers.  We have the 3B's who have the potential to score at will and while the defense doesn't appear as good on paper football games aren't won or lost on paper. Any given Sunday means more today than it did 20 years ago.  On paper the Penguins should have made the Stanley Cup final almost every year since 2009. The team can't get hot down the stretch and into the playoffs.  On paper the Steelers were far from the best team in the league in either 2005 or 2008. The team found a way.

steelers,37go2n,dj0,10,Wed May 27 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah the commentators always draw attention to the fact that Ben wears a glove on his throwing hand, which is kind of unique for a QB. I bet if you asked he'd give a no bullshit answer like ""It was cold, I wanted to wear gloves""."

steelers,37ltgd,DKnight32x,11,Thu May 28 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"Just because he's not as good as he was doesn't mean he's bad. He's still very very easily top 16 at his position right now, there are 32 teams in the league. So that means he's definitely better than at least half of all the other teams starting option. Plus he's a great blocker. Let's not pretend like it's time to kick him off yet. Let's let him play while we start looking for a (future) replacement."
steelers,37ltgd,KanyeWest_GayFish,5,Thu May 28 16:04:41 2015 UTC,I'm not saying they need to get rid of him.  But they do need to prepare for the inevitable.  He declined in on-field productivity in 2013 and 2014 from his 2012 season as the article points out.
steelers,37ltgd,DriArcher,3,Thu May 28 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"Do you know anything about our draft picks? We picked super athletic but raw in pass catching Jesse James.

steelers,37ltgd,KanyeWest_GayFish,3,Thu May 28 16:36:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call jesse James an excellent blocker. He's just really big and athletic.  He's not good at any one thing yet
steelers,37ltgd,Synectics,3,Thu May 28 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, however I would say his blocking is much better than his catching at this point is time. Although someone that big and athletic will surely become a great receiving threat if he can work on his fundamentals more."
steelers,37ltgd,style26062,1 point,Fri May 29 00:34:59 2015 UTC,"Same could be said of Ben (as in, Steelers should be preparing for the inevitable), and yet he never gets brought up. Mind you, Miller and Ben came into the league at the same time, and Ben has seen far more injuries.  Miller simply wasn't a target as much this season. He didn't underperform, but was simply utilized more as a blocker than receiver, due to the nature of the offense changing in an attempt to keep Ben on his feet and utilize Bell and the running game more."
steelers,37ltgd,KanyeWest_GayFish,2,Thu May 28 17:34:44 2015 UTC,"Miller was actually targeted 91 times in 2014, his third highest number of targets in a single season since 2005.  He just didn't do as much with them as he previously had been able to."
steelers,37ltgd,BobbyAdamson,5,Thu May 28 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"What makes you say he's less of a ""difference maker""?   He had 66 receptions for 761 yards in 2014.  44 of those were 1st down receptions, and 3 TDs.  That's his 3rd best receiving season out of 10 years in the league.  I've never heard much complaint about his blocking either.  I agree that he's much closer to the end than to the beginning of his career, but I don't think we should write him off soon."
steelers,37ltgd,KanyeWest_GayFish,7,Thu May 28 16:08:57 2015 UTC,If anything his blocking is the best its ever been when paired with Munchak's zone scheme
steelers,37ltgd,unseth,1 point,Thu May 28 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the rise of the Jimmy Graham's of the league has made people unfairly scrutinize the less ""flashy"" or sexy tight-ends? Miller is a great TE and there's not much competition out there at the position. Might as well ride it. He's still got gas in the tank."
steelers,37ltgd,tapwater86,2,Thu May 28 16:29:33 2015 UTC,Oh it definitely has. Honestly there hasn't been a tight end as complete as Heath until Gronk. And even then 27 year old Heath was almost up there.
steelers,37ltgd,oompahlumpa,2,Thu May 28 16:38:17 2015 UTC,The point is that his per target efficiency has gone down.

His strength in misdirection runs and the screen game makes teams unwilling to send blitzers, knowing they could be caught out of position for a big gain.  At the same time, Bell forces defenders to stay in the box even when the defense does not blitz, allowing Ben to torch thinner coverage than QBs normally see when the defense only rushes 4."

steelers,377mer,TunaNoCrust412,3,Mon May 25 23:31:49 2015 UTC,That's probably because he's one of the best when it comes to making something out of a broken play.

steelers,379don,OriginalOutlaw,1 point,Sun May 31 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"There is something to say about injuries to part-time players. They are standing on the sideline, with just a moment's notice when they have to go in. Sure they ""warmed up"" in pre-game, but that's all faded by now. They go in, play like they were a starter, get mashed up in the brawl and come out with an injury. I believe regular snaps will help alleviate his injury concerns. If he gets injured in game 4, consider me eating crow."
steelers,379don,hippydipster,0,Tue May 26 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"You're right we haven't seen much, but what we have seen, is a very hard-hitting flying into tackles lights-out sort of player, not unlike a young Polamalu in his tackling style and ability.  Whether he can cover and make reads is a completely unknown though."
steelers,379don,Steinerway,11,Tue May 26 14:00:44 2015 UTC,"The offensive line turnaround began with Haley, not Munchak. Munch has been great for the team and accelerated it, but he didn't pull a complete turnaround. It was already mostly turned around.  Edit: And I'm probably editing this too late for anyone to see it, but everyone needs to get the fuck over the bubble screens and stop whining about them. Not every play is going to rip off big chunks of yards. There are some plays that need to be called to keep the defense honest. Bubble screens prevent DBs from cheating on the deep ball."
steelers,379don,OriginalOutlaw,1 point,Tue May 26 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"But bubble screens on 3rd and long....!? Seems to be the only time they are ever employed, and very obviously to no avail."
steelers,379don,Steinerway,1 point,Tue May 26 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yet we had the 5th highest 3rd down conversion percent in the league, and I'm trying to find splits to show 3rd and long stats but I feel those weren't bad either. Yeah a lot of the bubble screens came on 3rd and long...but how many successful 3rd down conversions came because the opposing defense was expecting another screen? That's my point. Plays aren't just successful because they're well-designed. They're successful because they're well-disguised pre-snap, and you've given the opposing defense the idea that you're going to do something different. Can't give them the idea that you might do something different if you never even do that something, or don't do it frequently enough that it'll be a surprise."
steelers,379don,IdunnoLXG,18,Tue May 26 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm kind of worried about the Dupree pick. He has all the measurables, but none of the production. Kind of winced when we didn't take Shane Ray."
steelers,379don,huhwhatweird,21,Mon May 25 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"Don't think you could have justified taking Shane Ray when Dupree was still on the board. The one I really wanted was Marcus Peters but the Chiefs took him. Something Dupree does that Shane Ray doesn't do nearly as well is get in after the ball handler. He doesn't give up on plays and that makes him far better imo.  My biggest issue is taking Sammy Coates. Still don't like the pick. Marcus Wheaton can and has stepped up when we needed him. Martavis Bryant has come into his own. You could've done so much with that pick and instead took someone we don't need at all.  To say, ""oh Colbert has success drafting WRs tho"" is a lame excuse when we had so many needs to fill."

steelers,379don,SicaBiasThrowaway,8,Tue May 26 22:11:20 2015 UTC,Coates is a player who is a solid prospect in his own right. He was taken because he was by far the best prospect on the board without any big red flags on him.
steelers,379don,SicaBiasThrowaway,5,Tue May 26 01:50:21 2015 UTC,"his production wasnt bad. good conference and asked to do more than just rush. one of my big issues with beasley is whether it was his job or not he just sold out for the pass every play often blowing right by the actual play. i forget, but somewhere someone broke down pressures/rush and i think he looked better there. with that said, yeah he needs a lot of technique work, but id have been stunned if we took ray. if dupree was gone i was thinking more owa. reality or not, i still had in my head that we were looking more for a potential lolb and preferably someone with a bit of size"

steelers,379don,DaGambino56,8,Tue May 26 17:10:58 2015 UTC,Cortez will be fine. Ike had similar mental issues.   Jones isn't a bust. He started the season off great then had his wrist broken by Timmons as he was forcing a fumble. Timmons and Heyward took several years to become top dogs. Relax..   Mike Mitchell isn't as bad as everyone made him out to be. Him and Allen did a fine job of holding down the secondary. He needs to work on stupid penalties though.
steelers,379don,gryffon5147,2,Tue May 26 17:14:50 2015 UTC,"He needs to work on stupid penalties though.   This is my issue with him. He still has that Carolina Panthers attitude and needs to remember where he is now. I am all for sticking up for a teammate here and there, but the Steelers do not employ thugs.

The crowd just wasn't getting into it at the beginning of the year and there were a LOT of empty seats through entire games.  In fact it was embarrassing for me and I felt bad for the players. The fans in Pittsburgh need to step it up.  I'm worried that a big part of it is the changing of the city.

steelers,379don,xDalexx,3,Tue Jun 2 03:51:30 2015 UTC,"My most unpopular opinion at this point is probably that bringing James Harrison back was and is a mistake.  Yes, I get that he is still quite awesome, surprisingly.  It took him 5 or so weeks to get back in form, but he did, and  he looked great.    But it didn't get us deep in the playoffs last year, and is not going to make the difference this year either.    But, what it cost us was development of players who will be needed late this year and next and next and next.    Howard Jones - we go another year without much development, and without knowing whether he's worth spending another year looking at.  Arthur Moats - Seemed awfully good at times.  Awfully mediocre at others.  Could have played more.  The Steelers keep doing this and their young players keep getting into their 3rd and 4th years before we begin to really evaluate them.  By then we're up against competing for them in the free agent market and not knowing their value, or not having tied them up with an early contract.  So, in my book, Harrison was as much a mistake as Cam Thomas and Mike Mitchell, and Lance Moore.  Veterans we didn't need taking up slots that should have gone to our younger players."

There were games where it was his fault though, so I can see why you think that."

A Steeler home game is a community event that benefits the city. I drive in from Ohio, and have cousins that fly across the country annually to spend money on airfare, hotels, meals, riding the incline, riding the gateway clipper, shopping at the malls, doing duckie tours, and anything a tourist might consider the ""pittsburgh experience."" This will take money out of the Pittsburgh economy and the pockets of hardworking locals.

But even for me, who I've grown accustomed to mexican Steeler fandom, sometimes I can't believe how many people I see wearing a jersey, some sort of merchandise or gather at someone's place or bar to watch the games. Man you should've seen the streets of Monterrey during the 2008 superbowl. The streets were EMPTY. And for every touchdown you could hear the whole block roaring and chanting.  Bettis came to Mexico like 6 months ago. I was stunned by the amount of people wearing steeler's jerseys on the subway.   And that's without a game in our country. This level of fandom resides in a family tradition passed by our parents who grew up during THE 70's reign. I can only imagine how much money is going to evaporate from our country if there is a proper merchandising plan including a game and some sort of follow up opening official stores or keeping up with the training camps.  Also, going for the Pittsburgh experience, is fucking impossible  for the majority of the mexican fan base. It's not the same as going to Texas or Arizona."

There's a certain elegance (sorry, I'm a designer, i see elegance in even football uniform design) in the high contrast of the colors, the sleekness of the stripes and shapes in the logo. Block letters seem like an afterthought. Not designed, but left over from an era when there were one type of number design. Now, they're designed, and I think they work really well.

steelers,36ixi7,B_Witt,4,Tue May 19 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"It's amazing what happens when the defense is expecting a bubble screen and defends against that, allowing other plays (that would be much more easily defended if it weren't for the bubble screens) to work very well to say the least."

steelers,36ixi7,Steinerway,7,Tue May 19 23:39:19 2015 UTC,"It just boggles my mind. Haley has never really been unproductive here in Pittsburgh. Offense was off to a great start in 2012, not Haley's fault that Roethlisberger had a freak landing on one of the few sacks Haley had allowed him to sustain just one season removed from yet another 40 sack season under Arians the year prior. In 2013, replaced Pouncey with a guy signed off the street, didn't have Bell for the first three games, third string TE for those games as well, Mike Adams completely shat the bed...took some games but the offense finally produced so well that the performance from 2014 was not a surprise at all.  I just don't understand how anyone could have seen how the offense's performance went from Arians to Haley...and still complain. Complaining about bubble screens while ignoring everything else is like saying Ben sucks because of the Jets game while pretending what he did against Indy and Baltimore the weeks prior never actually happened. There's far more good than bad. Get over the bubble screens, which aren't even a bad thing since they open up all the other plays that consistently work."

steelers,36ixi7,Steinerway,7,Wed May 20 01:55:36 2015 UTC,"While having the QB at 1 is obviously a good thing, the other two can also be caused by having an unbalanced offense.  For example, Brees and Roethlisberger tied for most yards, but the top three Saints receivers were 30, 33, and 35 on the receiving list.  If we get too dependant on Brown a shutdown corner or double team could shut the whole thing down."
steelers,36ixi7,mtownlax38,8,Wed May 20 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"You say this as if Brown isn't matched up with the opponent's #1 corner/double teamed already. And as if Bell wasn't the #2 rusher in the league, signifying a pretty balanced offense. And as if Bryant hadn't scored 8 TDs in 10 games, providing another threat across from Brown in addition to Bell out of the backfield.  In /r/nfl_draft, I think it was a Falcons fan but months ago he had the Steelers taking a receiver in the first round. He referred to the 2011 draft, when the Falcons had Roddy White but ""nothing behind him"" so they traded WAY up to take Julio Jones. One problem: The 2010 season, the one before the Falcons took Jones, they were ranked 15th in passing offense. This past season, we were ranked #2. The year before that, when we did have Brown and nothing behind him (even with Cotch's 10 TDs), we were merely ranked 12th. You don't have the 2nd best passing attack in the league with an unbalanced receiving corps. Bryant, Bell, Miller and Wheaton all contributed heavily."
steelers,36ixi7,jolly_peno,7,Wed May 20 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"That's great, but Antonio cannot be covered. Double team, triple team, he'll get open. Game plan all you want for him, but you can't cover him. We witnessed that this year."
steelers,36ixi7,kingkoons,3,Wed May 20 00:58:22 2015 UTC,"Good point except we don't  fall into that category of an unbalanced offence as Bryant and Wheaton had amazing seasons in they own right, and Bell is another receiving threat aside from his Rushing potential and Heath is still performing well. Defences don't know where to go with the amount of playmakers we have. Which makes me very happy in the pants :)"

steelers,36lydt,dmremic,6,Tue May 26 14:13:38 2015 UTC,I would have been ok with them doing away with PAT's all together.
steelers,36lydt,MattEven,2,Wed May 20 13:50:27 2015 UTC,"so no 2pt either?  6 points and done?  I dunno, PATs diminish the importance of the FG.  or are you an advocate of the 7 point TD?  I like the idea of added strategy with having to choose between 2pt and 1pt PATs, and the possibility the 2pt conversion brings to making a late game comeback.  Without the 2pt conversion, if you're down 15 points, you're down 3 scores no matter what and thus need 3 possessions to try and take the lead (or tie if that is possible)"
steelers,36lydt,Steelering,6,Wed May 20 16:18:58 2015 UTC,I like blitz 2000 where you can just take the free point or risk going for 2
steelers,36lydt,curlbaumann,1 point,Wed May 20 18:45:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind that either, but it still allows for PATs, unlike what MattEven suggests  the downside is that the Blitz system would discourage 2 points even more than they already are because the 7 point TD would be 100% automatic instead of 99%.  although that's not necessarily a downside, as the NFL seems to want to encourage 2 point attempts more than what we already see for the purpose of manufacturing extra drama, which I don't know if I care for that..."
steelers,36lydt,Steelering,1 point,Thu May 21 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"That actually is a really nice solution. It will get rid of the 'yawn'  (made PAT) or 'ridiculous failure' (missed PAT) , while keeping the excitement of the 2-point try."

steelers,36lydt,Pineal,1 point,Wed May 20 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of the 7 point TD. FG's are another part of the game that make less sense in the modern era, before they were harder to kick so it was ok that a TD was = to 2 FG's, but with the range kickers have today I think it's important to keep scoring a TD a much higher value than kicking a FG"
steelers,36lydt,Steelering,1 point,Wed May 20 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"I made a joke on r/NFL about this topic, but it was a joke that could have basis in reality.  Basically the gist of it all was to force the player(s) who score the TD be the ones required to attempt the PATs.  Obviously it would be a lot more entertaining trying to watch some of these diva WRs try and kick an extra point, and it would be a lot less automatic than having the kicker do it, and thus encouraging more 2pt attempts.  Although we could take it even further and make it so that only the player who scored the TD could score a 2pt conversion, any other player scoring would be just 1 point.  Could add a helluva lot more intrigue for defenses as it would mean it could pay off to just allow easy 1pt conversions while double/triple teaming the 2pt option, and of course it would add a lot more value to developing a strong run game with a good RB as part of your offensive arsenal as it would mean heavy run oriented teams would be more likely to score the 8pt TDs over the finesse, pass-oriented teams.  I dunno, at the end of the day I'm not really a hug fan of any major changes, because I think the way it works now is brilliant, and just because PAT kicks are boring doesn't mean they serve no purpose or that it should be drastically changed"
steelers,36lydt,Pineal,1 point,Thu May 21 00:29:35 2015 UTC,"It's interesting but I am really against making the PAT much harder because it ignores how much better the kicking game has gotten in ALL facets.  Before 4th down on the 30 yard line meant going for it, because those 3 points were far from guaranteed. So having a field goal be half a TD kinda made sense because you basically needed to get into the red zone. But now FG's are kicked reliably from so far out, I think it's not right to make TD's more likely to be 6 points (as opposed to 7) while not changing FG's.   I agree with you though, I'm against radical changes. I think it works well now and, although it's a poor argument, I like the traditions of the game.   EDIT: And I think the current rules work fine for lower levels of football, which could very likely follow any changes the NFL makes and screw up high school ball, etc."

steelers,36g1jq,Steelering,13,Wed May 20 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"Just noticed the article is from Dave Dameshek, who is a Steelers fan, so there's that obvious potential bias, but honestly its not way off base (the other QB ranking list on here has Ben and Brady flipped).  He might have Romo a little low based on his most recent season but there are still valid arguments to have him that low. Other than that Cam Newton is probably a bit too high, but otherwise it seems spot on, mostly just swapping certain players here and there if anything."

steelers,36g1jq,stuckmeformypaper,1 point,Tue May 19 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"Based on last year, he was arguably second only to Aaron Rodgers. You could make a case for Brady being tied at second. Yes, Brady relies on the best TE in the NFL as well as probably the best offensive system, but Ben also relies on the ridiculous star power his offense has. There's also a pretty strong case for Russell Wilson, who had career-high yardage totals in both passing and rushing and career-low interceptions last year."

And we lost to Vick after Ben threw back-to-back 6 TD games. But I believe it's safe to say it will be an 'easier' time against the Pats.  Not only is Brady out but Blount will be out as well. Take that as you will. One thing I haven't seen talked about in this subreddit is the fact that the Pats have also lost a lot in regards to Corners.    Revis Browner (That's their top 2 from last year) Arrington Dennard Chekwa   Generally this doesn't matter with BB at the helm since he is so good at planning but I don't think any type of planning can account for Brown, Wheaton, Bryant, Heath, Coates (maybe), and Williams out of the back-field with plugged in Corners.   Hopefully our LBs will have more time to rush the QB with Garoppolo at the helm. I don't believe he will be able to get it out as quickly as Brady would (and how we would normally get killed by him.) More pressure can lead to our ballhawk corners making some splash plays...hopefully :D  EDIT: Formatting"

steelers,36bklh,Spiecher,3,Mon May 18 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"He's still going to be 39 soon, and wasn't really that good last year. He made throws when he had to, most of the time. If we're talking about picking a QB to lead your team in 2015, everyone should pick Ben over Brady."
steelers,36bklh,1htaehn,-3,Mon May 18 15:51:30 2015 UTC,"Didn't say he wasn't talented, just saying I don't think he's talented as Ben. Ben vs Tom when the pocket implodes, who makes the play?"
steelers,36bklh,enzomatic75,4,Mon May 18 14:14:07 2015 UTC,Being able to scramble isn't the only thing that makes a good QB. They're both great QBs. Is it really that big of a deal to argue #2 vs #3?
steelers,36bklh,axxl75,2,Mon May 18 14:37:28 2015 UTC,"To me, yes it is a big deal because I feel like Ben has been unfairly underrated most of his career and Brady has been unfairly overrated his entire career, because publicity. But I digress, what subreddit is this again?!"
steelers,36bklh,enzomatic75,1 point,Mon May 18 15:56:25 2015 UTC,"Just because it's the Steelers subreddit doesn't mean that people have to blindly support their own players. Humility is a good trait to have. Brady is talked about more than Ben because of numbers. On a piece of paper, Brady looks better than Ben in most categories. Ben is undeniably a better scrambler than Brady, but Brady has more passing yards (even counting only 2004 on and including Brady's missed year he's +4000 yards), 70 more TDs, 25 less INTs, 6 Super Bowl appearances, 4 Super Bowl wins, and 3 Super Bowl MVPs compared to Ben's 3 SBs, 2 rings, and 0 MVPs.   I love Ben as much as anyone in this sub (most of the time), but you can't deny that Brady is arguably the better QB overall. Especially in an NFL that LOOOOVES numbers, Brady has a better career than Ben.   You saying Ben has been underrated most of his career is partly true (although I think Steelers fans tend to think people hate us more than they really do), but Brady hasn't been overrated his entire career based on publicity. His numbers are amazing. You seem like someone who can't overlook homerism.   The fact that he's even #3 on a list like this should show you he's not being underrated. Most people wouldn't put him in the top 5 if you asked. He is a great QB, he just doesn't put up the numbers that most people latch onto."
steelers,36bklh,axxl75,1 point,Mon May 18 16:20:45 2015 UTC,"I see. Last I checked 1 has 4 years in the league longer than the other as well. This would be a very relevant factor for career metrics. Let's just say one career is waning whilst the other is coming into it's own. Regardless, I do not respect NE, they've been caught cheating twice, and their pedigree lends itself to cheating as well (McDaniels), with this many instances in this much time, some would apply the word ""culture"" to their dishonesty. So we agree to disagree then, I think Ben is the better qb, always have, always will. Call it blind fervor or an affinity for a particular style of playing, I really don't care though, because my opinion matters most to me at the end of the day."
steelers,36bklh,enzomatic75,2,Mon May 18 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, Ben's best season ever (in terms of yardage and TDs) is better than Brady's worst season in the past 5 years. That's including the fact that Brady had a pretty horrible (for his standards anyway) first 4 games and barely played in week 17 because there was nothing to play for.   Even so, other than yardage, their seasons were incredibly similar. On paper, Ben was a better QB last season. Since 2004, Brady has been by far the better QB on paper. The article is about going into 2015, so yeah you can easily make the argument that Ben is better going into 2015 based on last season. You can also easily make an argument that when throwing out the first 4 games and the last game where Brady didn't play or played well below par, Brady only had about 300 yards less in passing than Ben (with a much worse receiving core), 5 less TDs, and 1 more INT. It's pretty similar, but then add that Ben failed HARD in the playoffs once Bell was out and Brady won a Superbowl MVP.   Based purely on the regular season yeah, Ben probably gets ahead of Brady, but you can't really think it's crazy that the 2014 SB MVP has a good shot of being a top 2 QB next year.   Like I said, you're more than welcome to think Ben is going to be better. Personally I think (and obviously hope) that he does better than Brady. But you cannot argue that one group's subjective opinions are insane based on your one highly subjective opinion. They're really close. They're ranked #2 and #3. That's fine.   I also like how your original argument was about how Ben is better on non statistical QB things, but then now list statistics as your argument. Also, I wasn't counting Brady's first 4 years in any of my statistics. Also the fact that you throw out the Patriots cheating (which is completely irrelevant to this discussion) shows how little you have to actually argue with. Not to mention that, despite what you think you know, the Patriots didn't really cheat in Spygate like people think they did (video taping was and is legal, it's just location that they did it which was a stupid mistake but admittedly from Goodell and even Bill Cowher gave them no real competitive advantage) and there's no actual proof of the Patriots or especially Brady actually cheating in this scandal either.   You can argue that you'd rather have Ben on your team than Brady and NO ONE would say you're insane. People might disagree, even on this sub, but you have every reason to think that way. The fact that you think it's crazy that a group would put Brady, the reigning SB MVP and a better QB in every meaningful statistical category over the last 10 years, ONE spot ahead of Ben is just crazy. You obviously have a huge bias against New England and a huge bias for Pittsburgh and can't think clearly about either subject.   Objectively the two QBs are very very similar going into next season, and they were ranked right next to each other."
steelers,36bklh,axxl75,5,Mon May 18 17:48:49 2015 UTC,Brady would have the ball out of his hand before the pocket imploded because he'd know the defensive call ahead of time.
steelers,36bklh,rhino43grr,0,Mon May 18 17:05:15 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter who you put up against Brady in that category. The only guy I've seen with worse pocket presence than Brady was Tebow.
steelers,36bklh,1htaehn,1 point,Mon May 18 15:50:03 2015 UTC,In the super bowl he climbed a collapsing pocket several times to make a throw
steelers,36bklh,jfuss04,0,Wed May 20 23:17:06 2015 UTC,"Brady, regardless of how much people might hate him, has ridiculously good pocket presence. He doesn't scramble, but that's different. Brady can survive in the pocket for a while because he's the best at making small adjustments to stay inside the protection. Brady/Patriots hate gets so over the top on this sub."
steelers,36bklh,NotJoeyWheeler,1 point,Mon May 18 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"I should have re-phrased because you're technically correct. Brady is one of the worst in the league when the pocket collapses. Lucky for him, he's been able to hide behind a good line - and make little adjustments to ensure that he stays behind it most of the time."

steelers,36bgou,Opuski,2,Mon May 18 02:16:26 2015 UTC,"""It might have been the toughest, grittiest and most thankless job to have ever existed in the NFL"".   I think every O-line position is tougher, grittier and more thankless than FB. Whenever there's a passing play FBs either run a route or check out for any blitzes to pass block. If not either, he'll be sitting on the bench. Linemen have to wrestle on practically every down. Sure they get to double team every now and then, but seriously? That quote only solidifies the argument for how the O-line heroes always seem to be left out of the conversation.   P.S. Games are won and lost in the trenches. If i could have just one quality position in my offense, I'd look for the linemen first. Those guys are always taken for granted. A bad O-line makes a great QB look terrible, and a good O-line makes average QBs look good or even great. Same typically goes with the RBs."

steelers,36cgem,hoponthe,6,Mon May 18 07:21:29 2015 UTC,"personally, i don't think he's too much of a threat. he's not terrible at escaping pressure, but he tends to over/underthrow his targets most of the time. he's just not that accurate. seems like he holds onto the ball for 4 seconds at least on every single play compared to brady's 2-ish.   i think with the most likely improved pass rush with the addition of dupree and another year of experience for heyward and co., we'll get a bit of pressure on him and hopefully improved secondary play, we should be alright. if our offense is firing on all cylinders, i'm confident that we can take this game. not having bell will obviously hurt, but it seems like the pats secondary is incomplete to say the least, and with brown, wheaton, bryant, heath, and a hopefully competent coates, we should be able to get by."
steelers,36cgem,SicaBiasThrowaway,2,Mon May 18 07:26:17 2015 UTC,maybe i was watching too many college cuts for CBs for the draft. but watching highlights at least he doesnt look bad at all.
steelers,36cgem,SicaBiasThrowaway,2,Mon May 18 08:56:00 2015 UTC,"i'm not saying he looks bad i'm just saying he's not anything to be scared of. he, like hopefully any nfl QB, has the ability to make plays. and with a starting o-line and receiver corps, he'll likely play better than in this video. but at the same time, he DOES over/underthrow his targets a pretty large percentage of the time, and he's not good at throwing on the run. if golson/grant end up starting or even in the rotation at CB, they should be able to take advantage of some of his misthrows and hopefully turn them into a turnover or two. maybe we'll see some big play willie gay, who knows. i think that the matchups will be on our side this time around."

steelers,36cgem,heavymedicine,1 point,Mon May 18 14:04:56 2015 UTC,"I think he's decent for a first year QB. He will have grown as a player under Tom Brady all of last year, and he will have something to prove in his first game as a starter.   His passing accuracy seems suspect at times, especially when he's under pressure, but the experienced Patriots receivers/TEs might help bail him out despite flaws on that end.   I think the trick for us will be to not underestimate our opponent, have a decent secondary coverage (a great opportunity for our new ballhawks perhaps), and apply relentless pressure on the quarterback."

steelers,36a4ar,Tall_lankybaldguy,2,Sun May 17 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little worried about the line. I'm fine with the fact that we didn't draft early for it. Our GM makes a big point of finding stop gaps in FA so we don't have to reach and can take the best player available in the Draft. Had Humphries not gone right before us I think we would've seen a totally different draft for the Panthers.  I'm hoping that Oher will have a rebirth at Carolina and return to the level he played at in Baltimore.  As far as Shaq, I love the pick. The kid is a pure athlete and should fit into our defense perfectly at LB. With the D line and two of the best LBs in the country around him he should be free to be a ball hawk and that's what he excels at.   Just remember, lots of people chided the Panthers for taking Luke Kuechly at 9th in 2012."

Ben Roethlisberger got better at getting rid of the ball early which cut down on him getting hit. The defense finally started allowing rookies to start and contribute early on.   Wrong:   Continued to fall in love with the pass in the redzone to the detriment of the offense. Continued playing ineffectual starters on defense even when the team had backups who had more to offer. Continued to play down to inferior competition.   Improvements:   Moved on from many of those ineffectual starters either by letting them walk or ""encouraging"" them to retire. Added young talent who can start early on in the secondary.

We should have been doing everything we could to get the ball strictly to brown and do some trick plays like the pass td he had against Houston, run some more pistol or wildcat with bell and brown."
steelers,364py3,TunaNoCrust412,3,Sat May 16 06:24:51 2015 UTC,"Right:     Ball out of Ben's hands faster.  He will only get better at it too. Appear to have had success teaching Martavis to catch with his hands.  To me, this is major.  The kid will not succeed in the NFL if he doesn't learn this, and I saw, much to my surprise and predictions to the contrary, a lot of improvement in him using his hands to catch the ball. OL troubles aside, they really did a great job having the right personnel choices, and guys improving through the year.   Wrong:      Too many young players not getting in games enough and we are now left entering a season with a lot of these players taking over as default starters and we really don't know much about how they'll do.  Players like Shamarko, Tuitt to some degree, Dri.  Also players who might have been but were given no chances, like Howard Jones, Josh Harris  Too many poor free agent choices - Mitchell, Cam Thomas, Lance Moore, James Harrison (I know many are fans of him coming back, but I was and am not one of them.  I think it needlessly interferes with the development of the younger players). Steelers offense still seems infected with a ""good enough"" attitude, whereas for a long time I have felt they needed to development into a Patriots-like ""I still see a defender out there who's soul has not yet been crushed, let's score another TD"".  They have the tools, but the ""Steeler's Way"" seems to be holding them back once they get a lead in a game, they play not to lose, rather than to win.   Improvements - not sure I have any idea, really, but the hell with it:    I'm glad Lebeau is gone.  Of course I love the man, but his time has been up for a while, and I look forward to seeing what Butler does. Drafting all defense.  This has a downside - I am a big believer that OL should be drafted relatively highly nearly every year.  They let Wesley Johnson get away last year, and I think that hurt.  This year, they drafted no OL, which I will always see as a mistake.  I am happy to see the defense, particularly the backfield, get a serious reloading effort going.  Better late than never. Stability remains.  Kept Tomlin, Haley, Munchak, Butler, Porter, Lake, this is all excellent.  Chasing too hard after super bowls usually results in  abject failure. Staying the course and making incremental changes keeps the Steelers relevant each and every year, and that is all I can ask for, as a fan."
steelers,364py3,hippydipster,1 point,Sat May 16 15:38:22 2015 UTC,Can't agree with you about Harrison. That guy works his ass off and is a great role model for our young guys. Don't mind seeing him back.
steelers,364py3,erb149,2,Sat May 16 18:59:04 2015 UTC,"I know, plenty don't agree.  I stated my reason, which doesn't take away from his obvious awesomeness."
steelers,364py3,hippydipster,1 point,Sat May 16 19:03:19 2015 UTC,"True that, Everyone is entitled to thier own opinion. honestly as long as we're getting sacks and winning games I don't give a shit who's on the roster."
steelers,364py3,erb149,2,Sat May 16 19:42:37 2015 UTC,honestly the biggest mistake was the play that got Le'Veon hurt... of course we couldnt have known prior to that play but with Le'Veon we beat baltimore and then who knows what happens
steelers,364py3,FoxeRsmash,4,Sun May 17 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"Right   Picking two corners in the draft. Getting ballhawks in the secondary. Guys who can make splash plays is something that just disappeared from our D with the aging of Troy etc.  Making Ben a steeler for the remainder of his career.    Wrong   Not getting younger at RB. I like DeAngelo and think he will play well for the first couple games with 100% of the load, but I thought for sure we'd take a flyer on a running back. I guess we like Josh Harris quite a bit.  Sammie Coates. Don't get me wrong, I love the pick. I think in a couple years Sammie and Martavis will terrorize secondaries. I just thought we could have addressed a number of areas on our defense our offensive line (TJ Clemmings). Just seemed like a luxury pick addressing our deepest position already. Giving DHB Lynn Swann's #88    Improvements   D-line. Shawn Lemon/Howard Jones will break out. Dupree obviously looks like quite a physical specimen...  Secondary. Adding INTs to the secondary was huge. Just hope Holliman will contribute on special teams and find his path.  Elite offense got better with Sammie."
steelers,364py3,ShaquilleO_feel,3,Sat May 16 03:24:10 2015 UTC,"Just seemed like a luxury pick addressing our deepest position already.   We lost Lance Moore, Heyward-Bey makes the roster for special teams... that leaves us with just Antonio Brown (our only sure thing, outside of injury, heaven forbid), Wheaton, and Bryant - two younger players of which Wheaton was supposed to be our #2 but was quickly overshadowed by Bryant who has yet to play a full season...  I love your optimisim in thinking that we're deep at WR as that suggests you have all the confidence in Wheaton/Bryant (although I think the opinion of our WR corps, good or bad, might be muddled by the production of players like Heath and Bell who aren't WRs but are just as integral to the passing game), but I don't (yet) have faith in Wheaton/Bryant like I do with Brown.  Of the two I think Byrant shows the most promise while Wheaton I think could be best described as treading water, so the way I see it, drafting Coates is a catalyst to force Wheaton to sink or swim so that all parties can move from there  On the plus side, after 2 seasons Wheaton is ahead of where Sanders was after 3, but considering how much Sanders' production exploded with his move to a new team I can't help but think there might be a lack of chemistry between Ben and Wheaton like there seemed to be with Ben and Sanders.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a pretty big Wheaton fan, but drafting a WR isn't just for insurance if Wheaton turns out to be a bust for us, but also if he turns out to be a success for someone else like Sanders or Wallace (although Wallace wasn't really a success for someone else, he was enough of a success for us to earn a payday from someone else)  Plus as long as Ben keeps putting up monster numbers I'm all for feeding him weapons.  Feed the beast!"

steelers,35zqxr,NapoleonBlownapart87,-8,Thu May 14 23:15:58 2015 UTC,"Please tell me Jarvis isn't making this much.   I don't dislike the guy, but he's been as productive as Moats when healthy. Hopefully we see him continue to get better with James Harrison's conditioning and Porter's coaching."
steelers,35zqxr,FightingCoopers,11,Thu May 14 23:21:15 2015 UTC,The CBA makes all rookie contracts fairly standard so I dont really know what to tell you....   He was hurt last year after a decent start to the year so I still have confidence in Jarvis.
steelers,35zqxr,KanyeWest_GayFish,-4,Fri May 15 00:22:59 2015 UTC,Decent start to the year? He was okay against the run but he still lacks a pass rush.  He got a sack where the blocker fell over and another working one on one vs. a Te
steelers,35zqxr,NapoleonBlownapart87,7,Fri May 15 02:20:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't get why everyone shits on Jarvis. First of all, Lebeau's defense was notorious for limiting rookie production due to the sheer complexity and demands that were required at an elite level. Look at 1st round pick Lawrence Timmons. He had 13 tackles in 16 games, and now is an all-pro caliber linebacker.  Second of all, he was doing well before the Week 3 3rd quarter injury last season. Injuries are common due to the brutal nature of the sport and can be difficult to avoid, especially for rookies who are adapting to the intensity at the professional level. Give Jarvis two more seasons before we start to write him off. As for C.J. Mosley, he had Ngata, Suggs, and Dumervil providing pressure, all who were arguably playing at higher levels than anyone on our defense (Heyward makes a good case). Arthur Moats had 17 tackles and 4 sacks in 16 games compared to Jarvis Jones's 9 tackles and 2 sacks in 7 games."
steelers,35zqxr,NapoleonBlownapart87,-1,Fri May 15 02:14:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not shitting on Jarvis, as anyone who watched the first few games last year could see his improvement. My worry is that his ceiling isn't as high as a first round pick should be.  That's not to say he won't be great one day, but i'm right to be skeptical."
steelers,35zqxr,ThePittsburgher,-2,Fri May 15 02:36:38 2015 UTC,He was decent against the run but he still has terrible pass rush issues. He got almost no pressure and he got two sacks but only when a) the blocker fell over (and he almost didn't get it) and b) when he's 1 vs. 1 against a TE.
steelers,35zqxr,Clue57,-1,Fri May 15 02:22:28 2015 UTC,"What I'm judging him on (to this point) is technique, which he still has an issue with in pass rush. He still initiates the bull rush off the inside foot (rather than outside), he still allows him to get pushed up field to easily by tackles, his hand fighting isn't great, and he still is showing little bend to get around the corner after engaging.  I am NOT saying he's a bust. I am NOT saying he's not going to be a productive player. All I'm saying is, based on what he has done to this point he hasn't ""played well"" and there are a lot of things still to improve."
steelers,35zqxr,ThePittsburgher,1 point,Fri May 15 05:52:14 2015 UTC,That didn't take long at all. So many first rounders in the past have held out for a while. It shows this guy wants to have no distractions.
steelers,35zqxr,Sybertron,3,Fri May 15 13:17:34 2015 UTC,"The days of rookies holding out are over, dude. The new CBA pretty much normalizes all the rookie contracts based on where they were drafted. We're probably never gonna see another rookie get an unjustified $100 million contract."

steelers,36051o,DRU_leggo,1 point,Sat May 16 01:10:33 2015 UTC,"Because of Leveon's injury:  Couldn't you argue that the Ravens had no reason to play run D so they were able to pass rush pretty much from the 2nd quarter on... They had 2 elite pass rushers on the edges, Ngata, and bunch of other dudes who are quite good at it.  That wears the OL down quick and easy.  It is a well executed game plan by the Ravens almost every time we play them."
steelers,36051o,I_JERK_OFF_IN_PUBLIC,1 point,Sat May 16 04:12:37 2015 UTC,"So wouldn't the fact that they were getting beat, regardless of the RB, suggest they need improvement? A great o-line should still hold up in pass pro regardless who is in the backfield"
steelers,36051o,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sat May 16 05:01:16 2015 UTC,"Well, my argument and understanding is that fatigue sets in earlier for lineman when they have to back-pedal and play with more reactionary ability as opposed to that easy downhill running that they get with Le'Veon.  Thus, they get tired by the early blitzing and pass rushing, and end up playing like asshole as the game wears on, which happened in the third quarter and early fourth quarter."
steelers,36051o,I_JERK_OFF_IN_PUBLIC,1 point,Sat May 16 18:26:42 2015 UTC,"They were physically dominating the offensive line from the first snap of the game. It had zero to do with Bell missing. The Ravens didn't need to blitz at all. They were getting consistent pressure with 4 rushers. When they did blitz the linemen were clueless as to who they were supposed to pick up.   They got their asses kicked physically for 60 minutes. That has nothing to do with scheme. It's skill, ability, and desire."
steelers,36051o,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sat May 16 15:58:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree... they played pretty well early on.  Their pass rush is fierce.  I'm not arguing they blitzed with more than 4, that's why I said ""pass rush.""  As that pass rush gets called on to do what they do, they get better as the game goes on since they never are getting bullied around in a physically imposing run game.  On the other side of the ball, the OL get tired from having to back pedal and react to pass rushes and blitzing--which the Ravens also did/do consistently when they play us, not just that game."
steelers,36051o,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sat May 16 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"And that shows that the team doesn't need to improve the offensive line HOW, exactly?  Making the excuse of ""Well the Ravens are good"" is stupid because no matter how good they are the Steelers have to face them at least twice a season. If the Steelers had an offensive line as good as Dallas' they'd be a legit Super Bowl contender even with only a mediocre defense."
steelers,36051o,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sat May 16 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"That's like saying your tackle sucks because JJ Watt keep getting by him. Or your receiver sucks because he cant get past Sherman. The Ravens pass rush was ridiculously good because they had to make up for their lackluster secondary, Bell was out, and Ben wasn't good in that game."
steelers,36051o,SleestakLightning,0,Sat May 16 14:21:12 2015 UTC,"The Ravens manhandled the Steelers o-line. They didn't win with skill or speed they won with desire and strength. The tackles got their asses handed to them, Ramon Foster got beat on all day, the tight ends played like dog shit.  Anyone who isn't concerned with the o-line is out of their mind. Are they improved? Sure. But they've still got a ways to go to be really good.  Add to that the fact that they have zero depth and it's easy to see that the o-line is the weak link of the offense and could be their downfall once again."

steelers,36051o,SleestakLightning,-2,Sat May 16 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"No, I've been anti-PFF from the beginning. Their advanced stats are okay.  But a bunch of guys who have literally never played a down of football in their lives trying to assign grades to a player on a per-play basis is stupid."
steelers,36051o,erb149,0,Sat May 16 01:11:27 2015 UTC,You can know a lot about football without having ever played it... there are people who study it just to judge players (like PFF) and some of them have played football
steelers,36051o,SleestakLightning,-2,Sat May 16 14:19:51 2015 UTC,There are some things that come from instincts and knowing the playbook that the layperson can't and won't ever know.  How do they know which lineman is supposed to pick up which player? Sure you're usually supposed to pick up the inside guy but they have no way of knowing who is missing what blocks. All they can look at is one-on-one performance and even that is only telling part of the story.  PFF is trash. Sorry bro. They don't know anything. If they would stick to advanced statistics they may have something. But their ratings are a joke.
steelers,36051o,erb149,1 point,Sat May 16 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"So are you saying that you've been an NFL offensive lineman and know everything there is to know about the position? If not, then your argument that the PFF guys have never played ball doesn't hold much weight."

steelers,35ziwz,Sybertron,4,Thu May 14 20:44:18 2015 UTC,He was the top guard of his generation. I'm pretty sure he'll make it.
steelers,35ziwz,Intropy_,3,Thu May 14 21:59:06 2015 UTC,Over Hutch and Shields?
steelers,35ziwz,MattHoppe1,2,Thu May 14 22:39:55 2015 UTC,"I would rank them Faneca, Hutchinson, Shields. I think if you look back you'll find consistent debate between Faneca and Hutchinson being the best in the league. I obviously have a bias."
steelers,35ziwz,Intropy_,2,Fri May 15 00:33:35 2015 UTC,"Faneca: 9 Pro Bowls, 6x 1st team all-pro. Shields: 12 Pro Bowls, 2x 1st team all-pro. Hutchinson: 7 Pro Bowls, 5x 1st team all-pro.    There's certainly an argument for Faneca. He has more 1st team all pro nods than both Hutchinson and Upshaw and one fewer than Larry Allen. I think all three are a step below the Randall McDaniel, John Hannah class of offensive guards but all three were very, very good. I think Shields was clearly the worst of the three and since he's in, I expect that the other two will be in as well. Not sure if Faneca will be a 1st ballot guy but I can't see a scenario where he doesn't get in eventually."
steelers,35ziwz,k__e__n,3,Fri May 15 02:00:55 2015 UTC,"Possibly, honestly faneca was one of the best ever. Though with Hines next year we'll have a Steelers in every year for quite a bit."
steelers,35ziwz,mrsammercer,5,Thu May 14 22:44:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think Hines is going to be first ballot. He'll get in eventually, but I think they will make him sweat it out just like the Bus had to."
steelers,35ziwz,TheSaltbird,3,Fri May 15 02:27:45 2015 UTC,It honestly wouldn't surprise me if Hines has to wait 10-20 years.

The same year of my arrival was the Gold Coast Suns inaugural year in the AFL and I started 'barracking' for the team because they needed members. I can understand your friend's belief that Steeler Nation doesn't want them because it is standing room only on the bus.   But, baloney.  Yeah we got a full bus, but, only because the bus is freakishly awesome. Seriously. Put away the records, the SB wins, the HOFers, the near sainthood coaches and, if possible, The Rooney Family. What do you have? One fun fucking team. Look at the crows. Their idea of fun is stabbing people and humming the same seven notes over and over again. They are definitely on the spectrum.  How about the Cincy Pussycats, or Pussies? Yeah, they were cool...IN THE 80'S! No Sam Wyche means they are as cool as AIDS. And, AIDS ain't that cool. It's not fun to say, ""My team is as cool as AIDS.""   Then there are the Browns. Here's their team pic from last year. That is one coke party I'll pass on.  And we could go on through the NFL only to find out what we already know to be true: the Pittsburgh Steelers is the best sporting club in the world. So, tell your friends that yes, Steelers Nation is huge. But the alternatives are absolute shit. Tell them the Burg would love to have them. Here is their membership card.

steelers,35uw2p,Matador91,0,Thu May 14 03:56:24 2015 UTC,This. The little shit they add every year isn't enough and arguably the jump in graphics hasnt warranted me to even bother with getting 15 last year.   I want more graphics being used - not it looking like some kinda better PS3 edition and more focus OUTSIDE of Ultimate Team. I mean I get that's the money maker but COME THE FUCK ON.  I would love it if there was some sideline shots while setting up a play where your offense or defense (now on the sideline with the opposite on field) is talking and interacting.
steelers,35uw2p,ThatDriftingPixel,3,Thu May 14 04:20:08 2015 UTC,I don't know why you were down voted but you're right. M15 felt like it was very empty and honestly I think it was a waste of $60. M15 was basically made for ultimate team an Ultimate Team doesn't appeal to me at all and I've never played it. I'm really really really hoping for a be a pro mode or career mode or something where you have to work up the depth chart during the season. M16 need to be a huge improvement especially since EA stopped making NCAA football which were my favourite games on my 360.

steelers,35uw2p,DeuxBoy,1 point,Thu May 14 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"Yup I agree, but I will miss NCAA football so much. It's seems like Madden has taken a backseat among the EA sports game lineup in terms of development and features. The FIFA games get better and better every year and I play FIFA 15 the most out of all my Xbox One games, and I've given up on NHL because NHL 15 was a complete piece of shit. Right now Madden is the only game I really want to see a real improvement this year because i haven't seen any major improvements since Madden 10 and I'm dying for a good football game."

steelers,35u1rd,tapwater86,2,Wed May 13 14:59:25 2015 UTC,Even if he was terrible he wouldn't get cut. The Rooneys don't let go of coaches. Remember early 90's Cowher?
steelers,35u1rd,Homarus_Americanus,4,Wed May 13 17:20:06 2015 UTC,And '80's chuck knoll
steelers,35u1rd,Brutuss,4,Wed May 13 18:35:45 2015 UTC,Noll won 4 super bowls. He would have to run together a couple 2-14 seasons before his seat got remotely warm.
steelers,35u1rd,Homarus_Americanus,4,Wed May 13 19:01:30 2015 UTC,Definitely. Instead of the 6 rings thing I always point out that the Steelers have 3 coaches and 4 centers in my life time.
steelers,35u1rd,EPluribusUnumIdiota,18,Wed May 13 19:03:28 2015 UTC,"Tomlin did inherit Cowher's team, a very good team, couldn't have asked to be in a better position to succeed.  That fact doesn't take anything away from Tomlin's ability to be a great head coach, I think he's proven that he's one of the best in the league.  Fact is, if Cowher hadn't decided to quit coaching to be closer to his family he most likely would still be here.  Think about that, we would have only had two coaches over forty-seven years.  That should tell everyone something about how well-run organizations start from good decision making from the top.  Hiring Tomlin was one such good decision and I hope he stays with us until he decides to retire."
steelers,35u1rd,IdunnoLXG,11,Wed May 13 15:52:07 2015 UTC,"He still made very major decisions that helped to carry the Steelers into the new age. Porter left because Tomlin didn't want to resign him and give Harrison a chance. Had Cowher been there there is no way that Porter would have joined the Dolphins and Harrison would start. The better defense, needless to say, was the '08 defense and Tomlin is a defensive coach. Have to give him credit for working with Lebeau and making that defense what it was.  To say that Tomlin didn't make major decisions himself is wrong imo."
steelers,35u1rd,rmsersen,3,Wed May 13 16:11:36 2015 UTC,"Being a former WR and WR coach, I think Tomlin also deserves some credit for the recent riches we've had at that position. For fuck's sake, Cowher had to win a Super Bowl with Ward, Randle El, and Cedric Wilson as our top three receivers. Now we have arguably the best WR in the league, and with a couple of exceptions (cough Sweed cough), we've consistently hit it big, especially in later rounds.  Maybe it's an insane string of luck, or maybe Colbert randomly developed an eye for receiver talent. Most likely, it's the benefit of a head coach who intimately knows the position. All I know is that there's no way we'd have this kind of offensive firepower under Cowher."
steelers,35u1rd,dufus69,2,Thu May 14 00:45:47 2015 UTC,"So, why did Cowher predict ""his"" team would come in third place in the division the year he left?  Cowher was an underachiever who would have squandered one more super bowl caliber team had he stayed.  We're lucky Tomlin showed up."
steelers,35u1rd,Lfehova,10,Wed May 13 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"I'm actually more impressed with our 8-8 season when we started 2-6. Tomlin was able to maintain poise and keep order within the locker room and bring the team together for a 6-2 run and barely miss the playoffs, despite the fact that we were seriously lacking in terms of talent on the team. I think that is indicative of our head coach's abilities, and we should all be grateful we don't have one of these other twats in the league :)"
steelers,35u1rd,Homarus_Americanus,2,Wed May 13 15:31:38 2015 UTC,Very well said. I've never noticed Tomlin's coaching to be honest. What I mean by that is a when the guy at the top is doing a very good job you don't notice because everything generally goes well. Juxtapose this against Andy Reid who I've seen lose may games because he let the clock run out.
steelers,35u1rd,AnthonyNHB,9,Wed May 13 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"I think any coach that would be hired for the Steelers would suffer the same perception by those who don't understand that the organization overall has a strong commitment to winning every season.  It's not just on one person (coach or player).  It's the whole organization.  At the beginning of every season, from top to bottom, the Steelers set the goal of winning the Superbowl.  This is true every year.  They believe they are going to win it all.  That is the goal.  Everyone is committed to that.  If they aren't, that person usually finds themselves working for a different team.  When you have an organization committed to winning, anyone you bring in is going to be successful, because everyone makes an impact.  The teams were never just ""Cowher's teams,"" they were/are the Pittsburgh Steelers.  They win championships.    Ask yourself, do you truly believe the Raiders, Browns, Chargers or most other teams believe they are going to win the Superbowl every season.  No.  A lot of teams are just hoping to be above .500.    Non-fans will always try to tear the team down, claiming they win because of reasons not attributable to themselves.  Nope.  Again, it's the Pittsburgh Steelers.  They win championships."

The people that say that Tomlin ""cheated"" last year by standing too close to the field and impeding Jones.  No, Tomlin, like anyone else in the world can make stupid mistakes sometimes.  His are just more visible.  He said he tends to watch the plays on the Jumbotron because that gives a better view of the field.  He just didn't realize how close Jones was to him.  It wasn't cheating, it was idiocy.  Also, wasn't he standing there from the beginning of the play? Are you telling me he was able to predict where Jones was going to be and what side of the field the play was gonna happen on? And it pisses me off when people say that him smiling after the play was evidence that he meant to do it.  No, he just thought it was funny, just as any coach would if that happened to them."
steelers,35u1rd,Steinerway,6,Wed May 13 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"That game in general pisses me off. Three HUGE things that really bothered me:   We became the first team in history to go from an away game on Sunday to an away game on Thursday. Huge screw up by the schedule makers, teams always have home games before traveling on a short week. Be it Monday night before an away game Sunday, and especially Sunday before an away game on Thursday. The botched field goal in the first half. Suisham started to move, then the ball was snapped, and Suisham just stopped. So the holder (I'm blanking on who, to be honest) had to scramble and the play resulted in a loss of 12 yards and the Ravens were like 50 yards away, easily allowed them to put points on the board and extend the lead. The reason why Suisham stopped? Because he committed a false start. Dead play, five yard penalty, still fourth down. Not a 12 yard loss. If the false start had been correctly called by the official, the Steelers likely punt it, stop the Ravens from scoring and keep it at a one possession game. Normally I wouldn't complain, but that was probably a 30 or 40 yard swing in a game that ended up having a 2 point differential, so an officiating blunder like that is pretty big. Le'Veon Bell's touchdown being reversed. No penalty called on Jimmy Smith for leading with his head outside of the tackle boxes, first of all. Second of all, I understand the ""dead ball when ballcarrier loses his helmet"" rule for a situation where the player loses his helmet but regains his balance and keeps moving. But taking away forward progress when Bell fell into the endzone, unconscious because of an illegal hit, is simply inexcusable...unless you think you can make a headline about where a coach was standing, apparently. But that touchdown absolutely should have stood. They were forced to waste their 2-point play on the touchdown, which screwed up the actual 2 point attempt (the infamous ""Sanders being Sanders"" play). That was the REALLY big one.   But where Tomlin was standing was the inexcusable action of that game? That's a joke. Fuck the media, fuck idiot fans who blindly believe what headlines the media chooses to harp on and aren't even aware of facts the media chooses to ignore."

steelers,35u1rd,fueymatu,1 point,Wed May 13 20:03:36 2015 UTC,"Not to shit on Tomlin at all - I love him and hope he sticks around for a long, long time. But the situations really aren't comparable.  Cowher, for all his faults, was a consistent winner - at least in the regular season. 14 seasons, 10 playoff trips, and only 3 seasons below .500. He also had enough playoff success (multiple AFCCs, a SB berth, etc) to keep him safe.  Noll was one of the best coaches in the history of the game, and turned a joke franchise into a league superpower. He had a stretch of mediocrity in the 80s that most lesser coaches would not have survived, but his legacy was so entrenched at that point that firing him was unfathomable.   Tomlin does not have a legacy to protect him, and while he had great success from 2007-2010, we haven't won a playoff game in four years, and missed the playoffs two of the last three seasons. That sounds spoiled as fuck, but the expectations in this town are high.   And whether it's fair or not, you can't argue that Tomlin didn't inherit a lot of great players from Cowher's tenure. Now, this team is almost entirely Tomlin's making. His coordinators, his draft picks and FAs. No more Troy, Ike, Farrior, Keisel, Hampton, Ward, etc.   What he does over the next 2-3 seasons will decide his fure. If we're contending for the division, back in the playoffs and winning games, then great. If we slide back into 8-8 purgatory, I don't see any reason for the Rooneys to give him 10 more years worth of rope just because his predecessors were HOFers. Let's not forget that Tomlin's already one the longest tenured coaches in the NFL (6th to be exact), entering his 9th year. If we end up firing him in 2017 because he's not getting it done, that would not be a rash or knee jerk reaction by the front office."

steelers,35tkfp,babyfarmer,1 point,Fri May 15 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"I see the team somewhere around 8-8 or so. That schedule is brutal. I have a hard time believing the offense will be as spectacularly good next season. I know the talent is there, but I am just a skeptic by nature. I want to see them do it two seasons in a row before I'm ready to crown them as one of the best offenses in the league.   And the defense was bad( like, bottom 5 in the league bad) last year. And that was before losing Ike, Troy, and Worilds. Granted, Troy and Ike were shadows of their former selves, but they had to be good locker room influences that will be hard to replace. And I just don't have the faith in our young defenders that others do. I like Tuitt a good deal, but haven't seen anything from Jones, Shazier, or especially Shamarko to say they will step into impact player roles. And Dupree has a lot of hype, but I think I heard a lot of the same arguments about Jarvis when he was drafted (best pass rushing prospect, physical freak, yada yada)."
steelers,35tkfp,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Wed May 13 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"11-5, I don't see this team finishing much worse than last season even with the harder schedule as they have literally improved across the board.  With the exception of the Seahawks, Patriots (w/ Brady), and maybe the Colts and Broncos they're more talented than everyone they'll go up against this year. If they go 2-2 in those games (very manageable), sweep the Browns and Bengals (also very doable as they are quite a bit better than both those teams), and split with the Ravens that's 7-3 record right there and the team is definitely capable enough to go 4-2 against the 49ers, Rams, Chargers, Cardinals, Chiefs, and Raiders."
steelers,35tkfp,babyfarmer,1 point,Wed May 13 15:59:02 2015 UTC,"11-5, I don't see this team finishing much worse than last season even with the harder schedule as they have literally improved across the board.   They lost their leading sacker, and are counting on two unproven players, one a rookie, to replace him. They also lost two cornerbacks, and are hoping to replace them with rookies as well. How exactly are either of these things an improvement?"
steelers,35tkfp,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Wed May 13 19:37:15 2015 UTC,"Because Jason Worilds was mediocre and only got those sacks by rushing the passer constantly, Arthur Moats put up half his production on a 3rd of his total snaps while not being terrible against the run. Ike Taylor never played for them last year (and sucked the previous season) and Troy Polamalu was similarly awful in coverage and against the run to the point the defense was much better with Will Allen on the field. Those three guys are not serious losses, they're name guys who are either past their prime or mediocre and while the name recognition might not be there the guys replacing them would have to be absolutely  awful to not at least equal their production.   The one real loss on defense was Brice McCain and while he was solid he was far from an elite talent. Compare that one loss to what next year's defense is expected to have and unless you have an overwhelming negative view of every player the Steelers drafted as well as guys like Ryan Shazier and Stephon Tuitt you can't argue that the defense hasn't improved. Moving away from LeBeau and his refusal to make adjustments which also killed the D last year is also a plus."
steelers,35tkfp,elias2718,1 point,Wed May 13 22:17:52 2015 UTC,I'd love to be as optimistic as many here seem to be but I think there can be no doubt we benefited quite a bit from the teams we faced last season and we'll be probably face much tougher teams this year (you never know with the NFL though). Therefore I wouldn't be surprised to see a regression in the win total even if the team itself stays the same or even improves overall. Having said all that I'd say the 'realistic' expectation for me at least is somewhere around 9-7.
steelers,35tkfp,JDriley,0,Wed May 13 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like we're going to go 8-8 or 7-9.

More recently, no one has had 36 since Bettis retired in 2006 or 86 since Ward in 2012, and I doubt anyone new will be getting 7 or 43 any time soon.  And I kinda like it this way. Doesn't make much of a difference since no one is getting the jersey numbers anyway, but I think it's still cool to not make a big deal of it and not make it ""official.""

steelers,35pr5f,GreatWay2StayInShape,11,Tue May 12 21:12:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, we have a good idea what Ben actually did. In Tahoe, a close friend/coworker of the accuser gave a sworn affidavit that ""McNulty had bragged to her about having consensual sex with Roethlisberger"" and McNulty dropped her suit as she was proven to be a liar by multiple people. That suit wasn't dropped until 2011, however, so it was still ongoing when Georgia happened.  In Georgia (I moved here to Atlanta in early 2010, and was here when the event happened) there was no evidence of rape, just sex, and no semen or useful DNA. The prosecutor charged Ben with providing alcohol to a minor (despite the fact it's the bar's job to card people entering the bar). He was still under suspicion due to the Tahoe case, so I believe that was the main driving factor in this problem. He may or may not have had sex with her, there's a lack of evidence as to exactly what happened here, and even a DA wouldn't bring charges despite a potential bar full of witnesses.  Basically, he stuck his dick in crazy, twice, at bad times.  And Ray Rice was suspended from the league, not just the initial 2 game suspension."

Whatever they did, it didn't affect the game of football.  There has to be a distinction between violating the integrity of the game and just being an asshole.  I think Brady should have gotten more than four games (which will probably be dropped to two) because it doesn't matter if cheating helped them win or not.  It just doesn't.  Say you were in school and you were found to have cheated on an exam, it doesn't matter if you would have failed the exam.  Look, I don't think Ben raped anybody, and I don't believe in the whole idea of ""rape culture.""  And I think I have a right to speak about this because I've been a victim myself.  I've heard statistics of 1 in 4 college women being raped.  If that's true, that's insanity and we should go back to men and women's colleges.  If I had been raped by a professional football player, you better believe you would not shut me up.  I might call a lawyer after I call the police.

steelers,35pr5f,Brutuss,5,Wed May 13 00:29:37 2015 UTC,"Who in this sub thinks the punishment was too harsh?  While I would have accepted a 1-2 game Brady suspension + $500K team fine + docking 1st round pick , I can certainly understand why the NFL went further.  Remember, it wasn't the actual deflation, it's the cover-up.. the lying.. the misdirection and general obstruction of the investigation which resulted in the severity of the punishment.  At almost every turn before, during, and after the investigation the organization, Brady, and Kraft flipped a big ass bird at the NFL and said, ""Come at me Bro!.. Come at me!""  EDIT: Just wanted to add, this will eventually go to appeal and hopefully neutral abitration and after that maybe we can put the whole thing to rest."

steelers,35pr5f,jj_yossarian,2,Tue May 12 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably too harsh. The suspension is fine (will probably be appealed to 2). The fine is negligible. The draft picks seem unfair though - the Wells report specifically said they don't think BB or the FO knew. The team made both locker room guys available and only put their foot down after the fifth interview request, which is pretty reasonable to me. I just think punishing the team for the actions of one player is a pretty slippery slope."
steelers,35pr5f,shadowslayer978,5,Tue May 12 20:25:19 2015 UTC,"I need to clear up a few things, since the whole thing about the 5th interview request gets repeated without correction or objection pretty much everywhere by /r/Patriots .  They down vote anything against their narratives, even facts which cant be disproven and have managed to muddy the waters.  I dont want you or any of Steeler Nation falling into their circle-jerks and bogus arguments.  .  McNally was interviewed the first 3 times by NFL security (not the Wells team).  Each time he was interviewed he gave different stories.  First he took the balls and went straight to the field.  Then after being told there was video of him entering the bathroom he copped to it and said he put the balls down on the left, and used the urinal on the right.  He said he's used that bathroom many many times but guess what.. there's no urinal on the right, only a stall on left.  .  After the NFL hired Wells, the 4th interview with McNally took place with Wells BEFORE they actually received the recovered (deleted) text messages from the forensic examiners.  It's important to note, there were a number of deleted texts on both McNally and Jastremskis phones.  Both phones were sent to the forensic examiner to attempt to recover the deleted texts.  Some of the deleted texts were recovered but the contact information was lost and it was impossible to tell who sent or received the texts.  It was at that point, after reviewing the texts, they requested a follow-up interview with McNally to discuss the text messages.... This was the infamous 5th interview request that never took place.  ...  Directly from the Wells report.... ""Our investigation did not discover these messages until after our initial interview with McNally.  In response to our request for a follow-up interview, rather than producing McNally, counsel for the Patriots tried to negotiate terms, requested  that  interview topics be  provided  in  advance and offered to âconsiderâ the use of written interrogatories,  all  of  which  we  declined  as  inappropriate  and  inconsistent  with  our  reliance  on  traditional investigative  methods.  We reiterated our offer to conduct our follow-up interview of McNally at any time  or location convenient to McNally, but counsel for the Patriots refused.""  ...  Now does that seem like a reasonable move by the Patriots?  Looks like stone-walling and obstruction.  Doesn't seem like the full cooperation they claim.  Some reasonable persons might conclude they demanded interview questions in advance to prep/coach McNally.  Also, this tactic was used with other interview requests with other Patriot employees, however the Wells team determined they were not essential and didnt pursue them.  Make no mistake, at some point the organization itself made a concerted premeditated effort to impair the investigation.  It wasnt just Brady alone.  .  Sorry for the length of the post, it's just frustrating over the last few days seeing the ignorance, half-truths, and flat-out lies not just in reddit but in some mainstream publications.  Side Note: Peter King is an asshat and a sloppy ""journalist"",  if he can actually be considered one."

With just using a dash of common sense and a tiny bit of logic and research, you could imagine that maybe the accused just doesn't want to be in a court case that will last an extremely long time. Maybe they don't want to be in the news constantly accused of something horrible whether they did it or not. Maybe if the girl was actually raped, you'd think she'd want to see the person who did it go to jail. Maybe there actually WAS evidence of her lying. Maybe a lot of woman accuse innocent celebrity athletes of this all the time, because (and I know this sounds crazy) they want money. Maybe the odds are that a huge celebrity athlete would probably not rape a person in a popular club with the help of his friends and with hundreds of people around. Or maybe we should just ignorantly call him a rapist, because it's just the safe thing to do and we don't want to come across as ""insensitive"". Maybe we're just a bunch of cowards who are afraid to point out anything that might be deemed politically incorrect. Maybe...  I'm just gonna play it safe though everyone. I really don't like questioning anything and need the love and admiration of my fellow anonymous internet ""friends"". Jerome Bettis was a rapist too. It really makes me question why I like this team when at one point in time there were TWO rapists playing. TWO! Shame on us for not stringing up everyone that let this happen.   Ok now let's get back to some football talk guys.  Edit: format"
steelers,35pr5f,TrueSouldier,3,Tue May 12 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100 percent.  I don't think people really understand that a settlement is not an indication of guilt.  What's an indication of guilt is a criminal trial with 12 jurors saying  yes, he did it.  There have been far too many women calling a lawyer and not calling the police.  Of course that looks like the women are only after money.    Court cases can drag on for years.  Lawyers on both sides will take depositions from everyone involved, family, friends, anyone that might have knowledge.  And that means that both parties will have every aspect of their life made public.    Knowing all this, athletes and celebrities have to be careful who they have sex with.  They definitely shouldn't be picking women up in bars.  I'm not discounting women that are actually raped, not at all.  It's an incredibly traumatic experience that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  That's why unfounded allegations make me very angry because it makes it harder for women to be believed."

I understand that in this day in age everyone has to acknowledge these obvious things though, because idiots out there are just waiting to pounce on you for being racist, sexist, etc....You shouldn't have to start any type of dialogue with the caveat of ""rape is bad"". It's the times we live in though.   I am not one of them guys that thinks every woman who says she is raped is lying. I think when it comes to celebrities and people with money that the chances of a woman or anyone else for that matter lying about it are greater. By no means do I dismiss them. I just think that evidence should be given and it needs to go to trial. If the alleged victim doesn't take it to trial then the question of whether she was raped or not should not be of our concern. She choose to not go any further and ended any discussion of the incident in doing so. There will be no more evidence given. It's over. We will never know the true details. When the person is found guilty due to trial and evidence given then ok. But until that happens then the person is innocent."

steelers,35pr5f,rusty022,5,Wed May 13 01:19:20 2015 UTC,"I understand that the Pats were punished not for taping signals, but for basically getting caught and not cooperating with an investigation (sounds familiar).  My argument is this: If what the Pats were doing wasn't illegal, why did the NFL and the Patriots destroy evidence? Why did they act like they had never done it? Why are they doing the same thing now? They're shady bastards, let them be punished.   For the record, I hate Goodell just as much. But I question the legitimacy of your argument when it's been well documented that Goodell has had a close relationship with Kraft for quite a while.   I would agree that this punishment is coming down hard, probably for that exact reason. He can't look like he has favorites.   Goodell is in a lose-lose situation however. Punish them lighter, and people cry favoritism. Punish them hard, people cry injustice and inconsistency. He's set himself up to fail in this regard with his previous boners.   But at the end of the day that's exactly what the owners deserve for putting a puppet up to protect themselves. Goodell was a conflict of interest case from the very start. His ineffectiveness was inevitable."
steelers,35pr5f,TheBigMcNasty,2,Tue May 12 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"Probably because of how grave the accusations were, and they came from two parties. You're talking about one of the most henous crimes outside of murder you can commit, not just some deflated balls. Sure there was no evidence aside from what we heard, and a settlement, but no one knows what he did or didn't do besides him. So I guess I get your point, but the two aren't equal and I agree that the league should've suspended him based on the allegations, and if found innocent or guilty either lessen the punishment or make it larger."

Proven domestic abuse should black ball you from the league, along with any incontrovertible proof of rape or any other heinous crime. Deflated balls is kind of a new one, and there's the implication this is a competitive edge the patriots have taken for some amount of time.

Unless you can say that the man is guilty without a doubt in your mind, then you should view him as innocent. I'm not arguing the suspension. The NFL is not a court system that has to abide by the innocent until proven guilty rule, it is a business and they have to make decisions based on what is best for the business. If Brady went unpunished, the business would look bad in the public eye. Everyone constantly jerking off over the situation calling him a cheater and saying he should be banned from the NFL and the HOF are ignorant and likely just listen to ESPN headlines and decide to throw judgement at the man because it is the popular thing to do."

Wildcards are already sewn up.  Now, how much do you really care that we got a ""cheap win"" in Week 1?  It's one thing to try and take an opposing star out of the game because you think it's the only way to win. That's cheap and dirty. But when the opposing star knocks himself out for breaking the rules, and you just so happen to benefit from it? Fuck yeah, I'll take it."

steelers,35n4zv,Drunk_hooker,43,Tue May 12 13:24:03 2015 UTC,They lost a first round pick too!? That's significant.
steelers,35n4zv,dj0,23,Mon May 11 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"More significant than the suspension, I think.  Year after superbowl is notoriously hard to repeat, so losing 4 early games doesn't mean that much long term to the franchise, but losing a first round pick? That could impact them for a decade."
steelers,35n4zv,maybenotpoor,6,Mon May 11 22:06:48 2015 UTC,"But it didn't the last time. They were fined a first rounder for the tapes in the 2008 draft, then went to the Super Bowl again in the 2011 and 2014 seasons anyway, with the other seasons being all 11+ wins. Given the dice roll nature of the draft, losing a pick isn't that big of a deal if your team is already good and well managed. You'd rather have it obviously, but it isn't ultimately that big of a deal for a team drafting in the last quarter or so of the round compared to one drafting in the top couple of picks where the desperately needed elite talent is. It only has the capacity to hurt a team ""for a decade"" if they are drafting early and are in desperate need of a QB. Every other position can be found throughout the draft, except maybe sure-fire offensive linemen."
steelers,35n4zv,ns156,2,Mon May 11 23:21:40 2015 UTC,Yeah they usually have a late pick and Bellicheck trades out of the first often anyway IIRC
steelers,35n4zv,Circus_McGee,2,Tue May 12 00:18:01 2015 UTC,"While Belichick has traded out of the first more regularly than most, it's something he usually does if we have multiple picks. He's only traded away our only first rounder like 2 or 3 times."
steelers,35n4zv,DCMurphy,1 point,Tue May 12 13:15:51 2015 UTC,I would counter by saying that stealing Randy Moss was like getting an extra 1st rounder.  Imagine what they would have done with another impact rookie!

IMO they should have lost two early picks in 2016 and two later picks in 2017, more than one mill (they made 5x on super bowl merch alone this year, easy) and a 6-8 game suspension. this might seem intense and maybe its cause i am salty, but this is what i see fair. i didn't see a year long suspension fair when it was brought up, but this is not that bad for the pats"

steelers,35n4zv,maybenotpoor,9,Mon May 11 22:01:37 2015 UTC,"The real advantage here is playing the patriots week 1, that's more important than the suspension.  Belichick wins by studying tape. In this case, we have a new(?) DC, and first game of the season has little tape available. With or without Brady, the earlier the game, the better off we were. Now, without Brady, our defense has the opportunity to confuse their QB, and our offense has some nice mismatches.  If we play well, this game is definitely winnable."

First, as you said, they're repeat offenders. Second, this (potentially) affected the outcome of a playoff game, nothing off the field. Third, Tom Brady is just a douche"
steelers,35n4zv,bchris24,9,Mon May 11 23:06:56 2015 UTC,I think it's a fair punishment solely because it was the AFC Champion Game and because this isn't the first time they've gotten caught cheating.
steelers,35n4zv,rhino43grr,9,Tue May 12 06:10:32 2015 UTC,Ben got 6 games later reduced to 4 for allegations. Ray Rice got 2 games later extended to 16 for an assault caught on camera. Brady gets 4 games for essentially spearheading deliberate and likely repeated institutional cheating. Welcome to Roger Goodell's Discipline Grab Bag Bonanza.
steelers,35n4zv,Brutuss,2,Tue May 12 00:36:32 2015 UTC,"I'm OK with them getting punished in theory, but this inconsistency is what drives me insane.

Yes, it was 2 games at first, but then they recognized their fuckup and his suspension was changed. Also, there are only so many ways to punish people. So yes, this MIGHT just have to have a similar penalty as another rule violation. People go to prison for years for fraud and for murder, does that mean they're the same? No, it means we don't have a panoply of methods to punish people.  4 games is fine to me, the picks not so much as that seems harsh. However, the Punishment Reduction Committee, sorry ""Appeals"" will cut the suspension down, it always happens. It's not an appeal, it's just a reduction request that's always granted."

steelers,35n4zv,eck226,10,Tue May 12 00:13:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't think the penalty was steep enough. Forget Rice, let's go back to one of Goodells first suspensions, Ben.

Fucking. Shit."
steelers,35n4zv,otnormal,4,Tue May 12 00:16:06 2015 UTC,"I think it was a good punishment. The NFL cant lose Brady for a whole season, it would lose too much money, thats why they took a first rounder but yeah even 6 games sound more reasonable than 4"
steelers,35n4zv,eck226,3,Tue May 12 00:27:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Six down to four would be acceptable, but I know four will mean only one or two actually missed.

Fuck the Pats homers, I'm and NFL homer and I don't like to see the sport disrespected by these asshole every fucking season."
steelers,35n4zv,ns156,5,Tue May 12 00:32:17 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, I think the punishment is fair, and the Ray Rice comparisons are also correct. I saw it best said on deadspin as ""so the nfl determined that deflating the balls is worse than beating your fiance in an elevator, but not as bad as beating your fiance and the tape getting out to the public?""  That's pretty dead on. It's also hilarious that Goodell added a 4th pound pick, as if he's working off some kind of punishment formula rather than just pulling it out of his ass like he always does."

Yes, it is twice as long, but there's a fucking reason why everyone complained Rice's was too short. They would have made it way longer if they had to redo the whole thing.  I may not agree with the lost 1st round pick but the suspension was warranted. He impeded their investigation and might have cheated, even if it wouldn't have changed the end result.  Doesn't matter though. Not having to play Brady makes me a happy man."
steelers,35n4zv,rmsersen,4,Mon May 11 22:19:56 2015 UTC,"It's because /r/NFL is a fuck Goodell circlejerk the size of Casey Hampton's waistline. They would have skewered him for being too light or too heavy no matter what the sentence was.  Normally I'm all for that, because seriously, fuck Goodell. But in this case, the punishment fits. The league says they have evidence that this was taking place even prior to 2014, so while it might not have impacted an AFCC blowout, whose to say it didn't make a difference in closer games before that?   And people are saying that Spygate shouldn't be considered, but that's the foundation of any disciplinary system - escalating penalties for repeat offenders. And that's what New England is; a team that has demonstrated a pattern of bending or outright breaking rules to maintain a competitive advantage. Goodell had no choice but to come down hard."

The reason Ben had so much success last year was because Bell was dynamic with his running and screens.   Let's hope D'Angelo is a suitable fill-in. I'm still not convinced from his years in Carolina, but that was both an injury prone and crowded backfield. Hopefully, the change of scenery is what he needed."

It's the defending champs. Prime time. Opening night. And while the rivalry with NE may have died down recently, Ben still remembers 2004.  If we don't come to this game ready to play, it's probably going to be a long year."
steelers,35n4zv,pittfan4313,3,Tue May 12 04:36:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I think people already penciling it as a W are getting ahead of themselves.  Obviously no Brady is easier than Brady, but Garrapolo isn't finding this out a week before the game. It's May. He has four months of camp and pre-season, getting first team reps, etc. He also only has four specific defenses to study and game plan for, and we're the first. And on our end, we have no tape to study. At least with Brady, you can study his strengths and weaknesses and try to gameplan...this kid's a blank slate.  He'll be ready for us, no question. And unless he's bad - really bad, like buttfumble bad - this game is still going to be a battle....especially since the rest of the team are taking this punishment as a slight, and will have a bullshit ""us against the world"" chip on their shoulder by the time Week 1 gets here. That's what Belichick does best.  I'd call it 50/50 right now; had it at 70/30 NE when Brady was still in the picture.  All that being said, I'm still celebrating the suspension, because fuck New England."

steelers,35n4zv,student_of_yoshi,3,Mon May 11 21:48:35 2015 UTC,4th round picks are still significant. Losing any draft pick is significant. Just because its a Sunday pick doesn't make it a big deal. Can you imagine how our team would look if we lost a late pick and couldn't get Antonio or Kelvin or a guy like Brett? What the real kicker is is that they can't trade into the fourth round at all and let's say they somehow acquire a second 1st round pick than the higher of the two picks is forfeited. If you dig a little deeper I say this is very fair punishment.
steelers,35n4zv,strathmeyer,1 point,Mon May 11 22:10:03 2015 UTC,The fact that its the next two years - 1st next year (the big takeaway) and the 4th 2017 which is also big. Then you got your star QB out for 4 games (maybe ole Roger will get his love for Brady back and lower it to two) AND you got your organization fined 1Mil and you got a really strict punishment that hurts their organization going forward for the next couple of years.

steelers,35liqt,NapoleonBlownapart87,2,Mon May 11 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"Bud and Flex Luthor are already huge. I hope Harrison's work ethic makes an impression on them, but I don't think they need to bulk up. Especially since I think we picked up Shazer Beam for his coverage skills rather than being able to out-muscle a guard or something.  JJ on the other hand looks like a kid next to the rest of our LB corps. I'm not nearly as negative on him as others seem to be, but he definitely needs to gain some mass if he's going to be a serious pass rushing threat. He looked pretty good last season, so I have tons of faith."

steelers,35liqt,Rorbotron,2,Mon May 11 16:56:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that small movement is attributed to the massive amount of weight he has on that hex.  It only happens before the initial squat.
steelers,35liqt,dmremic,2,Mon May 11 18:53:34 2015 UTC,yeah. his form was pretty damn solid. it's impossible to not wiggle a little bit with the hex moving backwards and pulling itself that way with the momentum of his backwards steps. his form was solid.  source: powerlifter
steelers,35liqt,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Wed May 13 15:36:51 2015 UTC,Agreed   I wouldn't classify myself as a power lifter but I lift pretty heavy.  Your form doesn't get much better than what he displayed in that video.  He's moving a lot of weight.
steelers,35liqt,fishbulb00,-12,Wed May 13 17:18:33 2015 UTC,"Why is this necessary?    He has a bad back... he has spinal injuries that required surgery.  As someone who has a bad back, why go out to set ridiculous unnecessary records???  He is a physical freak that is probably stronger than 80% of the linemen he goes up against.  He needs to have at least one more good year as a starter, and then pass the torch.  If he throws his back out, we're fucked into starting Dupree before he's ready......"
steelers,35liqt,jimbo831,36,Mon May 11 14:52:08 2015 UTC,Lifting weights and improving strength is one of the best ways to protect against injury when done correctly. James Harrison has perfect form throughout the movement and is being coached by some of the best trainers and specialists around.   He's fine.
steelers,35liqt,dmremic,7,Mon May 11 15:10:22 2015 UTC,"And this is exactly why Woodley fell apart the last few seasons with injuries and why people were down on him for being ""lazy."" He came into camp in shitty shape and got hurt all the time.  No one in their right mind dislikes athletes who are injury prone unless they are personally responsible for their injuries, as was the case with Woodley."
steelers,35liqt,EPluribusUnumIdiota,12,Mon May 11 17:49:08 2015 UTC,"When you have physical problems, building up muscle strength around the problem areas is often the best way to mitigate them. When your back muscles are extremely strong, your spine is taking a lot less of the pressure."
steelers,35liqt,jimbo831,-15,Mon May 11 15:22:36 2015 UTC,"When you have back problems...  They strengthen your core, aka your abs.  When you throw your back out, let me know.  I will remind you to max out on dead-lift a month later.  We'll see how much fun that is."
steelers,35liqt,dmremic,3,Mon May 11 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"I've been a powerlifter for 22 years and I have two herniated disks in my lower back due to a car accident.  I'll be forty in less than a month and can rep out full deads of 675, PR is 745 and that was post-accident.  I'm a two inches shorter than Harrison and maybe ten pounds heavier.  My doctor advises against PRs these days and I listen to him.  If you notice Harrison isn't doing full deadlifts, wisely he has the riser boxes to prevent that extreme strain that can be placed on his lower back if he slips out of form.  These are a great form of dead if you have had back problems in the past and aren't worried about competing.  Also, deadlifts are one of the best lifts to strengthen a back with problems, when I was in the accident I quit for a year and the nerve pain was unbearable, so back into the gym I went and it was gone in six months, no painkillers needed.  Also, he's using a trap bar which will put less strain on the lower lumbar region, another smart move."
steelers,35liqt,jimbo831,6,Mon May 11 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"I have thrown my back out.  My doctor gave me quite a few back stretching and strengthening exercises.  I wasn't dead-lifting because I am relatively weak.  For me, basic exercises provide an improvement.  For James Harrison, anything short of dead-lifting is no better than sitting around.  In my case, part of my problem was that a back muscle was strained and that was holding my spine out of alignment.  As it healed, I was told to strengthen my whole core, back included, to help hold everything in place better.  The Steelers and James Harrison have doctors.  I promise they are okay with him doing this."
steelers,35liqt,TyroneBiggums93,-5,Mon May 11 15:42:39 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt a word of what you just said.  I don't doubt that he needs to deadlift to maintain his core muscles and keep his back strong.  I do doubt that he ""needs"" to work up to 800 lb. deadlift.  I do not understand why arm-chair physical therapists on Reddit are down-voting me.    All I am doing is pointing out the obvious facts:  (1) He is dead-lifting a LOT  (2) He has a bad back  (3) He is critical to the success of our Steelers Defense  (4) Given 1 thru 3 above he shouldn't take unnecessary risks  If the above flies in the face of your lifestyle choice, please feel free to downvote me."

They are down-voting you because you're the one being the arm-chair physical therapist.  Based off of absolutely no information (unless you know James Harrison and have kept that a secret), you are saying this is bad for his back.  Meanwhile, James Harrison is working with team doctors and physical therapists and is being told this is good for him.  If it wasn't, he wouldn't be doing it."
steelers,35liqt,TyroneBiggums93,4,Mon May 11 16:16:05 2015 UTC,This isn't even a true deadlift. More a squat-deadlift hybrid. The stress on the lower back isn't as great as a traditional deadlift.
steelers,35liqt,hoponthe,2,Mon May 11 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"Youre right. With this type of bar and motion you work more quads than back. It's like a slightly lower than normal rack pull.  He's working his grip stregth, traps, abs, and quads here mainly."
steelers,35liqt,dmremic,3,Mon May 11 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"The fact that you said ""core aka abs"" shows your lack of knowledge. Your core is much much more than your abs. The lower back, which is being worked with this movement, is a huge part of the core."

steelers,35ls0n,Steelering,1 point,Mon May 11 20:42:50 2015 UTC,At least you don't have a Santonio Holmes jersey you got the season before he was traded
steelers,35ls0n,Rorbotron,1 point,Tue May 12 22:29:44 2015 UTC,"at least he'll always have one of the greatest game winning catches in super bowl history, unfortunately can't say anything about Woodson helping us win a Superbowl :(  and if you want to add value to your Holmes Jersey, you could always combine  Swann/Harris/Bradshaw/Ward jerseys as a Steelers Superbowl MVP collection and hang them on the wall or something  at any rate Bryant is #10 now, so while I could patch Woodson to be Bell you could patch your Holmes to be Bryant  (and this is kind of why I'm against retiring numbers outside of extremely exceptional cases, because it really wouldn't be long before we'd start to run short of them :P)"
steelers,35ls0n,DRU_leggo,1 point,Wed May 13 00:15:04 2015 UTC,Cool with it if ike is cool with it.  I really hope that bring him into the organization in some capacity.
steelers,35ls0n,GreatWay2StayInShape,1 point,Mon May 11 18:59:43 2015 UTC,I've always been a fan of recirculating numbers within a position group. Kind of a next man up mentality. It's common practice among European soccer clubs. My favorite is when college teams reserve numbers for playmakers (like number 1 obviously or the way LSU hands out 7 to playmakers on D). That being said there are some exceptions like 75 or 52 in B&G and 42 in MLB.
steelers,35ls0n,GreatWay2StayInShape,-1,Mon May 11 20:44:38 2015 UTC,"i honestly don't think he should wear 24. The stench from Ike Taylor's terrible play for the past few years might wear off on him.  All kidding aside, there's definitely no problem with it"
steelers,35lcri,steelbydesign,19,Mon May 11 13:17:17 2015 UTC,I don't want that clown on our team. We got burned by Blount and the last thing we need is a box safety with a shitty attitude

steelers,35lcri,MattHoppe1,12,Mon May 11 13:58:11 2015 UTC,He stormed out of a team meeting and refused to play special teams because he is a second round pick and thinks he is too good for it. The anti DHB.
steelers,35lcri,BioSin,3,Mon May 11 14:53:04 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/7B_qhBBxZas?t=2m20s at 2:20 he looks like he is throwing a temper tantrum for what looked like his mistake. Someone I was watching that game with said he is known for that. I don't follow him that much but this might be what he is talking about.
steelers,35lcri,Intropy_,2,Mon May 11 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much what the announcer was saying, but it makes no sense. He's lined up on Brown, and Bell goes out in motion and nobody follows. Somebody needs to cover Bell, but if that's him, then nobody's on Brown. That's what he's yelling about, before the play you'll note. He sees that he's essentially left alone to cover two players over a third of the field, and he's asking for help."
steelers,35lcri,enragedvujiji,1 point,Tue May 12 01:44:54 2015 UTC,"I think this is just bad communication.

steelers,35lcri,imallergictocatsok,5,Wed May 13 17:35:41 2015 UTC,"I live in Houston and am also a Texans fan. Watching him for two years, he's super physical and loves to make the big play...which means he also draws tons of stupid penalties. Can't tell you the number of times it's been third and long and Swearinger gives them a new set of downs.   I wouldn't say his attitude is shitty, but I also don't think it gelled with Bill O'Brien's no-nonsense demeanor. Maybe somebody like Troy could've calmed him down, but if having JJ Watt on your defense doesn't take the fun out of you (saying that in the best way, love you JJ!) I'm not sure the youth of the Steelers D will.  Also, the fact that he announced his departure on Instagram at 3am before the team has been able to announce or, as some of the media is saying down here, even finalize a trade, is pretty shitty. Takes away any leverage Houston might have in getting something for him. We don't need petty shit like that in the Steelers' organization."
steelers,35lcri,cool_hand_puke,-2,Mon May 11 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  I'd still bring him in on a short term deal and see if Carnell Lake could get anything out of him. I think the Steelers D has really been lacking some teeth recently with more mild mannered guys like Jarvis Jones.  I see him as a special teams player and backup with starting experience.  As for the ""taking away leverage"" I don't see and issue there at all. They told him that he was gone, so obviously if they were trading him then a team has already agreed. If they told him he's gone, then I don't see why he can't post something thanking the Texans and fans.  I don't know. Sounds to me like he's a wreckless player that makes some boneheaded moves, but people on here are making him out to be a total locker room cancer, which doesn't seem like the case to me."
steelers,35lcri,WalterMatthau,4,Mon May 11 15:54:32 2015 UTC,"Nah, he's no monster (though his pet pitbull literally took a chunk out of Clowney's leg, so he certainly wasn't helping our locker room...) but I also don't see him taking well to moving from starter to special teams and back up. He's got ego, which sometimes can be great, but it's not backed up by his play, from what I've seen."

steelers,35nzyo,ThisIsTheBlack,-12,Wed May 13 14:20:56 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it was pretty harsh.  I'm perfectly fine with Brady being suspended, but docking the entire organization a 1st round pick is definitely overboard."
steelers,35nzyo,ColdNose,8,Tue May 12 02:17:45 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing though, Brady wasn't the person who deflated the balls or even give the OK to do so; he was just complicit about it and made the investigation harder by hiding the evidence.  To punish the person who OK'd it or actually deflated the balls you kind of have to take away the picks and fine the organization.    Plus, they're repeat cheaters."

Because it's the only thing that might stop or slow the cheating. There are no doubt more Patriots cheating scandals that could become public.

At least, that is my theory, as to why suddenly it is a story and confirmed months after the fact.  Now that it's past, most people are going to forget about it. In fact, I'd wager most fans just don't give a shit anymore. It's all over so many news networks, most are sick of hearing about it.  Maybe this is too much like conspiracy talk.

Down the stretch when we need it most, it was him, not Ben or Brown, that pulled out key wins against the Titans and Bengals.  What I don't like is we have Dupree, Jones, Shazier and Timmons now as our LB corps. I wanted them to get exposure to Brady and see how the new defense operates. Without Brady obviously they won't get a good taste of what the Pats are all about.   Either way to say we have the advantage is so wrong.

At the time I kept thinking, ""YES!  fuckhead Goodell is going to get punked hard"".. It was great how his former best-butt-buddy Kraft was coming after him and basically snubbed him at the Super Bowl.  However the cover-up, lying, refusal to cooperate by the Patriots/Brady definitely deserves a punishment.  Letting them off easy hinders any future investigations because players and organizations can just tell the NFL to fuck off if they know they're not going to be repercussions.  Reports in the loop in the New England area are all expecting 6-8 games.  Apparently the non-cooperation by the Pats/Brady is taken much more seriously by the NFL than even I had thought.  I predict Brady will get a 6 game suspension, which will be reduced to 4.. (I had previously thought he'd get a 4 reduced down to 1-2), and a hefty fine.  Patriots organization will be fined $500k (the maximum) and they'll have a draft pick taken away, possibly as high as a 1st (Same punishment as SpyGate)."

I recall a story from Cornette where he basically said that he and Madden were on the same benefit show, and said if he ever saw Madden in person he'd deck him because Madden was talking shit on him at an earlier time.  So Cornette was at the event, and Madden was locked in a room in the building doing radio promos for it.  Cornette was talking to Bruno Sammartino (who also hates Madden's guts), and apparently Madden walked out to the area they were at, saw them, and immediately turned around and went back to his room.

It starts off with Kevin Costner trading 3 first round picks to move up from 7th to 1st. It has terrible backstories that are not explained or even setup. At the end of the day he picked a player that could have been gotten in the late first round, then traded 3 2nd round picks for the 6th pick and then traded it to get his picks back and a punt returner. This movie could have been 15 minutes as he took his 7th pick, got the same player he got at number one and traded his  3 2nd round picks for 6th and gotten the RB he wanted. It was a comedy that the Browns could make moves and be a good team. You could give the Browns the first 15 picks in the next 10 drafts and they'd find a way to lose 12 games a season."

So people post about the Patriots and Browns, this subreddit isn't exclusively just for the Steelers. Take a quick look at /r/ravens.

Ben and Bell have both had some character concerns, plus they were 1st and 2nd round picks respectively.  Antonio Brown was drafted in the 6th round because he was ""too small, and too slow"".  He wasn't even the first receiver we picked in the draft that year.  Before he was drafted he had to walk on to Central Michigan. And before that he was homeless when his step father kicked him out of the house at 16.  There isn't a bigger underdog in football that overcame adversity the way Antonio Brown did.  Brown portrays the things I want to teach my children about hard work and perseverance.  Plus, he's got the best smile in football http://imgur.com/EAJwiMg"

steelers,35bgpf,IdunnoLXG,39,Fri May 8 22:45:07 2015 UTC,"As for training camp, Latrobe is awesome. Regardless of team affiliations, it's one of the better experiences a football fan can enjoy. You can get close to the players, get stuff signed, watch practices, St. Vincent is just an amazing place.  Given our QB's history I can understand why you don't want your daughter in his jersey. Polamalu was quite popular but he's just retired so it'd be a kind of throwback thing. Bell and Brown are fairly well established, and quite popular players who are likely to be around for a while. I think Shamarko Thomas is going to take a big step forward this year (or fall flat on his face) replacing Troy's hair... so that one's kind of a gamble.  Some unique facts about the Steelers, you can tell her that the team has won more Super Bowls than any other team (though this doesn't mean they've won more NFL Championships, it only applies to the ""Super Bowl Era""). The Steelers have only had 3 head coaches since 1969 (prior to that Bill Austin was the last coach the Rooneys fired, in 1968, and the team went through 16 head coaches from 1933 to 1969). The Steelers 1974 draft is considered the best in league history, with 4 future Hall of Famers selected... including Mike Webster who some consider the greatest NFL center of all time.  They're the only team that wears their logo on only one side of their helmet. They're the only team that uses a trademarked industry logo as part of their logo, too.  The team has been at least partially owned by the Rooney family since its founding. The Rooney family has joined the Mara family (owners of the NY Giants) through marriage. In fact, Rooney Mara, the actress, is named to honor this family connection.  Not sure about where to get cheap Steelers gear, it's like your situation... I can't walk out of a Shop n' Save without passing a rack of Steelers shirts."
steelers,35bgpf,Sks44,14,Fri May 8 19:16:43 2015 UTC,This is awesome!  She'll go nuts over this info.
steelers,35bgpf,puck342,11,Fri May 8 20:03:40 2015 UTC,"And if you want her to be a fan of both teams, you can let her know that the Bears are basically our twin NFC team. You guys were long considered the defensive team of the NFC and we've been likewise of the AFC. It's not about a small community structure, Packers, or about flashiness and white collar cities, Dallas, but a hard working blue collar get down and dirty type team.   You know. Not saying she shouldn't be a Steelers fan, I love how tolerant you are, but you can always cheer for both. :)"
steelers,35bgpf,Brendanaquicz,9,Fri May 8 22:42:46 2015 UTC,"Another tidbit: When there was a money issue with the Rooney's racetrack back in the day, they couldn't meet payroll for the Steelers. They were going to be in huge trouble but George Halas, who was friends with the Rooneys, floated them a loan to cover until they got things straightened out.  Also, when George Halas's daughter went to Penn, she told him she met a guy and they were serious. He called Rooney to have him check the kid out. Rooney showed up at the kids dorm himself. He also brought the Steelers offensive line. He had a chat with the kid and vetted him for Halas."

AB has a policy where he personally will respond to every piece of fan mail he gets.  Nobody could blame him if he has relaxed that stance, but it was a cool story for a while.    The Steelers training camp is a cool experience. They have the carnival type games where you throw a football, or catch a football on a moon bounce, and photo opps with the players.  Pretty Standard.  However, it is in Latrobe PA.  About an hour and 20 minutes from the city.  Near Latrobe though there is a really nice state park (Lynn Run) and  Fort Ligonier.  That might offer some things to do aside from the camp.    For gear, you can probably get a few Steeler jersey pretty cheap as some long time greats retired this year (Troy Polamalu, Brett Kiesel, Ike Taylor)"

Itâs a very special place where little ones can meet their favorite characters from nursery rhymes and children's tales and where parents and grandparents can revisit their youth and reminisce about simpler times.

So other things in the area are great to know.  I would love to maybe do something like Gettysburg as well, but i know that's 3 hours a way, or so not sure if that's a good idea or not.

steelers,35bgpf,CharmCity05,5,Tue May 12 15:09:04 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party but here are 3 under appreciated players to consider:  1) Heath Miller, TE. Great guy, great player, family man, completely humble and selfless. And the crowd roars ""Hhhhhheeeeeaaaaattttthhhhhh"" literally everytime he catches the ball.   2) Matt Spaeth, TE. Spaeth is primarily a blocker for us but a great one at that. He doesnt have a lot of name recognition but he is very valuable to the team. AND you may be happy to know he played 2 years for the Bears before he was re-signed by the Steelers.  3) william Gay, CB. Gay is an under appreciated corner back who has developed into an excellent starter. Maybe more importantly, he devotes much of his life  to ending domestic violence in memory of his mother, who was killed by his stepfather when he was a boy. Gay was a finalidt for the Walter Payton Man Of The Year award last year (should you need/want a connection to the Bears). Gay is the exact opposite of Ray Rice. I realize the backstory isnt approprite for a young girl and realize the name ""Gay"" is not ideal but wanted to share my perspective.  You seem like a great dad, OP. thanks for thinking of us."
steelers,35bgpf,CharmCity05,2,Fri May 8 23:07:57 2015 UTC,I remember Spaeth well.  Total Lunch Bucket guy. And completely underrated as a receiver.  Miss that dude.

steelers,35bgpf,CharmCity05,2,Sat May 9 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"Try eBay, look for Steelers lots and you can get a good mix of different things she'd like. Jerseys, might want to try there or knockoff sites. Brown, Bell and I'd say Joey Porter because he was a player and is now a coach."
steelers,35bgpf,Lfehova,2,Fri May 8 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for deals on gear, you might try to find a Troy Polamalu jersey on the cheap. He just retired after last season, so his merchandise might be available at a cheaper price than current players. In a sport full of self absorbed players with lots of character issues, Polamalu is the exact opposite. He's extremely humble, and puts his faith and family before everything. His jersey was the one I bought my son, because I thought he represented a good example of an athlete doing things the right way. Plus, he's a sure fire first ballot Hall of Famer, so even though he is retired, his jersey still holds some clout.  Here's a nice article that was written about him after he retired. Also, he has a head of hair that would make most young girls jealous... http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/4/10/8382139/troy-polamalu-retires-5-things-will-miss"
steelers,35bgpf,Lfehova,2,Fri May 8 21:08:24 2015 UTC,I've had better luck than I expected finding gear in Will County. I want to say that there's a Kmart in Manteo or something.
steelers,35bgpf,LeRonGuard,2,Fri May 8 22:22:00 2015 UTC,"All the great contributions already made, I would try to see if your daughter likes the defense more than the offense. As a Bears fan you are probably defensive sided as well as is Steelers fans. If that's the case, you can tell her about the zone blitz scheme devised by Bill Cowher, Dom Capers and Dick LeBeau, which the latter perfected and made it a trademark of our defense up to this day.  Great showing of Steeler Nation in this thread to hook you up with some stuff for your little girl!"
steelers,35bgpf,EOUGHE,2,Sat May 9 00:38:03 2015 UTC,"Late on this thread, just wanted to say thanks for being an awesome dad. Also, Steeler Nation always needs a new recruit."
steelers,35bgpf,herobryane,2,Sat May 9 04:03:01 2015 UTC,I want to say I have always considered the Bears the equivalent of the Steelers in the NFC. Both team are historically great who have prided themselves on a strong defense and a solid running game.  Definitely go Antonio Brown that smile is infectious and he just an amazing player to watch and will provide highlights for your daughter to remember forever.
steelers,35bgpf,gimpisgawd,2,Sat May 9 11:44:20 2015 UTC,"Oh god I wish Polamalu, Keisel, Taylor, Smith, Bettis, Ward, Ward were not retired for your daughter, I couldn't imagine a better favorite players and role models,  I consider my self very fortunate to watch these players play throughout their career. But Antonio Brown makes for a nice choice as well.   Unfortunately all of our legendary players have been retiring lately, and the rest of the team if fairly young and hard to gauge what kind of role model they can be for a young child.  But the Steelers usually do a great job of drafting an acquiring high character players and a model for consistency, no body likes seeing their favorite players left go or traded, fortunately we don't have to deal with that as much.    I've never been able to attend a training camp but from all I've heard it's usually great, with a lot of players interacting with fans"
steelers,35bgpf,z4chn45ty,1 point,Sun May 10 15:25:02 2015 UTC,"This was actually the main reason I was inspired to post here.   I was very familiar with your ""big guns"" the last decade, but with Keisel and Polamalu, Taylor and Ward gone...I realized I didn't know any of your core players, beyond Roethlisberger, who, despite never being charged...just didn't want to go there.   I knew Bell and Brown put up crazy numbers last couple years but didn't know if they were character guys or fan favorites.   So in that respect, you guys helped us out.   It sounds like for sure she will follow Antonio Brown but she sounds interested in Bell too so we will see what will happen."
steelers,35bgpf,LeRonGuard,1 point,Sun May 10 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"Id also suggest Cam Heyward who could be one of the better 5-tech defensive ends in the nfl in a few years and is a future defensive leader.  Although he lacks some star power due to not playing a luxurious position.   I'd also suggest Heath Miller, you can't go wrong there although his career in winding down.   I'd also suggest James Harrison or Vince Williams.  Harrison is a little PG13 with his play but there isn't a harder worker on this team and is a defensive leader, and an overall badass.  But again his career is winding down.  Vince Williams,  I just have a good feeling with this guy.  He's an unknown outside of the team and the fantasy, but he was a firey leader at Fsu and is putting in the work this offseason with Harrison, and showed very good potential since his rookie season as well as last year.  The guy just seems like a lot of past Steelers like James Farrier, Harrison, Joey Porter, and Larry Foote.  And he should be the heir to Lawrence Timmons at the BUCK ILB"
steelers,35bgpf,A__Black__Guy,2,Sun May 10 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"My dad is a bears fan as well!! Haha. I got into watching the steelers when I was little for the same reason, they were the 1st team that I watched that I thought were good, and so I took to them. She should be an awesome addition to the steelers family... And I can speak from experience that it is fun watching the games with my dad against each other. We were so close to getting a bears steelers superbowl in 2010, that would have been awesome, but may have gotten a little heated haha."

steelers,35bgpf,Saintzillla,2,Wed May 13 02:41:09 2015 UTC,"Just checking in on the Steelers thread and saw this, this is so awesome! As a Ravens fan I will say your daughter made a great choice (the Ravens would have been a good one too of course). But Steeler nation does it right, and the Steelers represent AFC North football well. You both will enjoy Ravens-Steelers battles for years to come as both teams are starting to look pretty dangerous.   As far as players, I have to agree with the consensus. Antonio Brown is the man, and that's coming from a rival. Torrey Smith and him used to train together and he seems like a genuinely awesome dude... Steelers fans correct me if I'm wrong I think they trained last offseason? (I remember because I was hoping Torrey would pick up a thing or two) If she has any questions on the Ravens-Steelers rivalry or anything like that I'd for sure give my two cents! I will say I think a very large amount of Ravens Nation will be Steelers fans-for-a-day on September 10th.  I just gained a ton of respect for Steeler Nation for this whole thread. I just graduated from KU and pretty much all my friends are from the Chicago area and big bears fans. Hopefully Pernell McPhee does well with his new larger role, I'm looking forward to watching that and hopefully a resurgent Bears team this season."
steelers,35bgpf,ShaquilleO_feel,1 point,Tue May 12 21:41:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, /r/steelers really represented themselves well. Hell, they've convinced ME to follow the Steelers as my number 2.  Thanks for Pernell.  Hope he can take it to the next level.  And...uh...enjoy Marc Trestman."
steelers,35bgpf,Saintzillla,1 point,Tue May 12 21:55:09 2015 UTC,That they did. McPhee's a pretty versatile player so I'm interested to see all the cool stuff Fangio will be able to design for him. Ya I mean as long as he doesn't try and completely revamp what Kubiak did we should be ok haha I'm sure he's glad to get back to X's and O's and not worry about head coaching responsibilities.
steelers,35bgpf,moorese7en,1 point,Tue May 12 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah...except as a Bears fan, I can tell you that it wasn't just head coaching that failed him.  X and O's failed him last year too.    For all this reputation as an offensive genius, there was little evidence of it last year.  His offense was incredibly predictable, easy to stop, couldn't recover from the slightest mistake, of which there were many, and was just wretchedly bad.  He also didn't use Forte, one of the best backs in the league, nearly enough.  And to top it all off, he somehow convinced the national media that EVERYTHING WAS CUTLER'S FAULT by scapegoating him.    I'm curious to see how he does in Baltimore, but I saw very little evidence last year that he even knew the offensive side all that well.  It just seemed like he was employing old concepts that all teams already knew how to defeat and didn't have any counter punches at the ready."
steelers,35bgpf,dangerm0use,1 point,Tue May 12 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"Damn. I have to admit I didn't catch a lot of Bears games last year so I can't comment on what the problems were, but I think we'll be ok if Harbaugh keeps Trestman working within a small framework and not trying to drastically alter the offense. This could lead to a little headbutting between the two though. Our offense is so hot-or-cold it's hard to know what to expect."
steelers,35bgpf,Hilfandor,1 point,Wed May 13 00:39:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  If he's forced to work within the context of a framework, he might be just fine.  And if he has someone to reign him in ""hey Marc, just because it's 3rd and 3 doesn't mean you have to pass EVERY DAMN TIME"" on his crazy predictable play calling, you'll be fine.  To be honest, Marc Trestman is the most crazy paradox ever.  Year one of Trestman was fun, exciting, tons of potential.  Year two was so bad at every single fundamental level that I don't even know if he can spell ""football""."
steelers,35bgpf,NotJoeyWheeler,1 point,Wed May 13 00:46:33 2015 UTC,Lol that's rough. We had to deal with that from Cam Cameron a few years back I don't know if I could watch that again. Weren't there some locker room problems though with Brandon Marshall and others or was that just kind of blown up by the media?
steelers,35bgpf,Hilfandor,1 point,Wed May 13 01:28:25 2015 UTC,"There were locker room problems that arose because Trestman had no idea how to manage grown men in an NFL setting.  All sorts of bizarre things, like moving all the lockers around so players would be lockered next to a random person, rather than by position group or even offense/defense.  Trestman deliberately not leading ""expecting natural leaders to emerge"".  Once that didn't happen, the larger personalities filled the leadership void.  There were even stories about how Trestman would lead all meetings...from the back of the room, behind players heads, as if he was too shy or weak to address them face to face.  Just weird stuff."

I go to several steelers games every season and they give out these cups you can only get at the game if you sit in the box section and order the root beer floats from the dessert cart. I have a couple that I wouldn't mind mailing to you, I have plenty of other cups in my kitchen and I'm sure I will pick up more steelers cups this season.

I just think a lot of people are touched by your endearing story of your daughter's inadvertent stumbling upon our beloved team and we love the ferocity she has for the Steelers.   Plus, your tolerance is seriously impressive and I believe we all want to support you in supporting your daughter's new lifelong passion.   I think I'd cry if my future son/daughter didn't like the steelers."
steelers,35bgpf,pat_pgh,1 point,Wed May 13 14:55:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah that last bit...I'm not too worried about because, as anybody with a daughter around this age can tell you, it's hard enough to keep them interested in NFL at all, when everybody else is isn't princesses and my little pony and all that...stuff...  So I figured, if liking the Steelers keeps her interested in the NFL long enough to emerge as a life long football fan...so be it.  And maybe, down the road, I can persuade her to at least follow the Bears as her number 2.  I'm just glad it wasn't the Packers.  Because FTP."

steelers,35ak9h,Eccentrica_Gallumbit,14,Fri May 8 16:19:13 2015 UTC,I think it might actually help. I think mitchell might look better not making up for troy's lag. We will miss that leadership though.
steelers,35ak9h,zjrk,2,Fri May 8 16:22:23 2015 UTC,Hope you're right.  I'd love to see him get picked up as a defensive coordinator honestly.  His foresight in picking apart an offensive cadence and keeping everyone on the O-line guessing was unrivaled.

The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as âtheâ, âandâ, âI'mâ, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including âtheâ, âandâ, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

steelers,35cw1r,lurkedlongtime,16,Sat May 9 02:23:49 2015 UTC,"Opposites.   Jones high production low athleticism  Dupree is legit clowney esque athleticism, lower production  Normally production being lower would worry me, but pass rushers tend to be raw coming out and end up successful, like Robert Quinn, etc."
steelers,35cw1r,ColdNose,7,Sat May 9 03:02:28 2015 UTC,Apparently he never had a position coach at Kentucky and was asked to drop back in coverage a lot which may have contributed to his lower production.
steelers,35cw1r,FreddyDontCare,1 point,Sat May 9 05:04:02 2015 UTC,His HC at Kentucky said they had Dupree drop in to coverage 40% of the time. That's a lot more than the other edge rushers to go in the first round. Or so I've been told.
steelers,35cw1r,jfuss04,7,Mon May 11 02:15:54 2015 UTC,Dupree has the size and physical attribute that Jarvis lacks
steelers,35cw1r,garglemymarbles,6,Sat May 9 02:41:05 2015 UTC,Dupree is WAYYY more athletic than Jarvis.
steelers,35cw1r,PomfAndCircvmstance,8,Sat May 9 20:58:44 2015 UTC,Jones has limited strength and athleticism while being pretty polished coming into the NFL. Dupree on the other hand is extremely impressive from a physical standpoint but needs a lot of work in terms of developing his skills.  If Dupree busts it won't be for the same reason Jones would.
steelers,35cw1r,Zack_of_Steel,1 point,Sat May 9 03:22:54 2015 UTC,Jones was anything but polished coming in. What pass rush move have you ever seen him employ?
steelers,35cw1r,hippydipster,1 point,Sun May 10 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"His first step.  He has no techniques that I can see, but I'd be hard pressed to name a player with a quicker first step.    He could, in theory become a really good 4-3 OLB, but that seems a tall order, learning-wise.  I have doubts he's much good in pass coverage at this point."
steelers,35cw1r,catzarrjerkz,2,Tue May 12 21:22:18 2015 UTC,"Dupree has all of the measureables to be a great pass rusher, although he didn't do a whole lot of straight pass rushing last year. He spent quite a few plays dropping into coverage, something like 30%. He has the potential to be better than Jones bc of his size, but he's not a ""natural"" pass rusher and time will tell how quickly he'll catch on to the Steelers' notoriously difficult defensive scheme.   Also, I'd say the jury is still out on Jones, his rookie year was a wash bc most players (including the likes of Polamalu) were generally pretty bad their rookie season in the Steelers D. Last year he was out most of the entire season due to injury. I wouldn't count him out as a bust just yet."
steelers,35cw1r,steelbydesign,1 point,Sun May 10 04:40:42 2015 UTC,I can't tell you that Dupree will definitely be productive...  But he does have a better chance of being productive quickly. Dupree is already built like an NFL player which is a big step up. Typically guys like Jarvis are overwhelmed both mentally and physically when they get to the NFL. He just wasn't strong enough.  Dupree on the other hand should be big and fast enough to handle it. He still has a long way to go on technique but he's ahead of where Jarvis was in a big way.
steelers,35bkyk,coastinosten,19,Fri May 8 19:15:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is the first year they're allowing LB's to wear 40-49, as well as 50-59 and 90-99."
steelers,35bkyk,JollyRogers40,2,Fri May 8 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"Think he'll keep it though?  He wore #2 in college (""trying to be No. 1 but I am working like I am No. 2."") but no LB numbers with 2 are available.  Harrison still has 92 and no one has worn 52 since Webster.  Does anyone have 42?"
steelers,35bkyk,Shabba-Doo,2,Fri May 8 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, I think Jordan Dangerfield was 42 last year in the preseason. So if practice squad guys have numbers then yeah."
steelers,35bkyk,JollyRogers40,1 point,Sat May 9 00:04:35 2015 UTC,I'm kind of expecting Dupree to change to either a 50s or a 90s number when something opens up. He might stick with 48 but I wouldn't be rushing to get my Dupree jersey right now.
steelers,35bkyk,elias2718,1 point,Fri May 8 23:47:14 2015 UTC,I'd never buy a rookie jersey before the regular season unless that player happened to keep the same number he wore in college. These things change all the time.

If it was Big Ben deflating the footballs, he'd already be suspended half the season, hit with a huge fine, Tomlin hit with a huge fine, and possibly loss of picks.

Belichick knew that the Steelers always play up (or down) to their competition, and therefore saw that as the underdogs, we were guaranteed victory.  In a bold move, he bribed the league to suspend Brady so as to lower their chances of winning below ours, ensuring that we would play down to them and lose.  That sonuvabitch..."
steelers,35bewx,MichelangeBro,5,Sat May 9 12:35:58 2015 UTC,The Patriots don't win without Tom Brady and that's a fact.

steelers,35bewx,Opuski,9,Sat May 9 01:24:27 2015 UTC,Depends on if the Patriots are currently above or below 500 without Brady

steelers,35bewx,Holliman48,6,Fri May 8 18:36:56 2015 UTC,The game is still in New England against an all round excellent team. Sure it's a different game without Brady but that doesn't mean it's going to be an easy W. They have a far better defense than us and we'll be missing our possibly best player.
steelers,35bewx,dj0,4,Fri May 8 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"I would think with Big Ben, Antonio Brown, and DeAngelo Williams (Who is more than capable of getting the job done) will probably take the W. No Revis is a big hit you have to adjust around and the loss of two key starters on offense will be a hard adjustment to make vs a team that is only missing one starter on offence. Also, I think our defense is smoothing itself out and shouldn't be compared to a defense that lost two of its big players from last year until the season starts."
steelers,35bewx,dj0,2,Fri May 8 20:52:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right, we should win. But losing wouldn't be anywhere near as disastrous as /u/Holliman48 made out."

We were ranked 18th.  What happens to their offensive if you remove some top contributors?   Now. I don't expect Brady to even be suspended, but with Bell out, we still have an excellent chance to beat those chumps. Steelers need to capitalize wins where they can. And the suspension scenario is a win the Steelers have to come away with.   Just my two cents."

It isnt that huge of a loss, however if we had lost the Troy and Ike of six years ago this offseason, it would be a different story."
steelers,35bewx,Holliman48,2,Sun May 10 17:23:06 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't expect Brady to get fined, yet alone suspended. But I am confident we'll walk away with the W."

So a few years ago, my best friend who is a basketball fiend asked me who my favorite NBA team was and I told him the Golden State Warriors. I'm not sure where I heard about them from but I remember thinking that the ""location"" part of their name was ""Golden State"" not just a city like everyone else and that was interesting to me. So as time went by I started to follow basketball more and more and more and for whatever reason I just fell in love with the Warriors. It was obviously a big help that they've been VERY good recently (but haven't won anything I know-__-) and so they've just kind of become my team. It's kind of nice liking a team that you're not ""supposed"" to like due to geographical reasons. Coincidently the story of my devotion to the Steelers is very similar.  tl;dr - I live in PA but I'm a Golden State fan for a few years and now they're good so people give me hell for being a bandwagon fan.

I still think we will get 4-5 more years out of Roethlisberger at his peak so there is still a chance that he gets that elusive third ring."
steelers,35785j,DRU_leggo,1 point,Thu May 7 19:57:49 2015 UTC,I'd say Ben. He did two Superbowls with a lesser team then Bradshaw and he just led the offense to 2nd overall in the league and was tied as the Passing Leader of the season.  Plus WHAT SUPER HUMAN HAS TWO 6 TD BACK TO BACK.

He didn't just tread water behind the shittiest O-line of the decade; he excelled, and put up stats no QB before or since would with that sort of 'protection'. Yes, Bradshaw won 4 Super Bowls, but I've never been one to exclusively associate championships with QB skill. Ben has done more with less over his career and I feel has a greater skill set than Bradshaw; ergo he is our best all-time."

Then again, none were to division rivals and IIRC, the Steelers lost pretty much all of them.  My most vivid memory was when I went to see the Broncos and Steelers on SNF in Denver. The lead up to the game was fun and my buddy (who I was visiting at Ft. Carson) went to the game in full Black and Gold.  On the way in, we got harassed about how the ""Steelers suck"" and ""Big Ben sucks"" and on and on. We got to our section and were in a sea of orange, but most of the stadium actually seemed fairly distributed in terms of Steelers representation.  Anyway, we kept getting harassed and I help up 5 fingers and said, ""5 super bowls! - how many do you have?"". And it got real quiet and one guy goes (in a strange, sarcastic froggy-ish voice), ""not cool man, that's how you get stabbed"". It was super awkward.  Anyway. The Steelers mounted a big comeback in that game, coming from like 28-7 down to tie it at 28 in the 4th quarter. It was crazy. The entire stadium seemed like Heinz Field for a good 10 minute stretch. ""Here we go Steelers, here we go"" ringing out. Broncos fans looking pissed. Roethlisberger come-from-behind win looking inevitable.  Unfortunately, the Steelers left too much time on the clock and gave Cutler enough time to get the ball downfield for Elam's game winner at the buzzer.   I think if the Steelers had won, we could have  been in for some trouble, especially since everyone around us was DRUNK after we tied it up. Buuuuut we lost, and everyone just kinda laughed us out of the stadium instead."
steelers,354t9l,IdunnoLXG,1 point,Thu May 7 04:06:18 2015 UTC,"Hm. Friendliest fans I ever ran into was NYG fans. There was a fair number of Steelers fans in the Meadowlands but definitely we were far outnumbered. Let me tell you the Meadowlands is not an easily invaded place if it's a Giants game even if you are a Steelers fans.  Either way, the Giants fans just smiled at me and told me to enjoy the game. I don't know if it was because we were non-divisional rivals or what but Eagles fans tell me they're jerk fans but they weren't at all. They were all super polite and extremely nice. At the same time be nice to them as well, it goes a long way. Chargers fans aren't like Raiders fans, they're not going to be itching to want to pick a fight. Enjoy the game, be nice to them and get to know them. Connect as people especially since their team's future is uncertainty offer them words of encouragement.   Eagles fans on the other hand, woah boy :p"

I also saw the Steelers there for the SNF opener in 2012 with my gf's family who are Broncos fans and they still treated them like shit just for sitting with me.   Just gotta keep your head down and do your best to ignore them, stadium security will ALWAYS go out of their way to kick out an opposing fan, even if they were not the ones causing problems. I saw the security in Denver take out some Steelers fans that had beer thrown on them by these shitty Broncos fans that had previously been standing in front of us and repeatedly berating a couple and calling them ""fat fucks"" (and the woman was wearing Broncos gear!)."

Their own fans hate them and don't buy tickets.  Especially Monday games.  Those were always blacked out when I lived there because the fans wouldn't attend the games.  You shouldn't have to worry about the fans because Steelers fans travel in numbers.  Last year for that disaster against the Jets, we outnumbers Jets fans in the stadium at least 2-1.  There is a good bet San Diego will be similar.  Plus, it's a night game and the  locals have to work the next day."

steelers,356v1n,Fokken__Prawns,1 point,Fri May 8 11:53:38 2015 UTC,"Jones will wear the black and gold.  He has been steadily improving... he's just been bitten by the unfortunate injury bug.  Few people may remember, but we took a similar risk with drafting another player who had an injury coming out of college that may have impacted his career.  That player?  Heath Miller.  The injury; sports hernia.  Jones's fault lies in his size.  He needs to bulk, he needs to bulk big time.  Jones's under-performance also lies in the fact that he hasn't  had the required support from the DE position, to free him up for Steeler OLB awesomeness, in his limited playing time.  Lastly Jones's under-performance is also attributed to his general lack of playing time, by not establishing himself as a true starter quality OLB candidate.  OLBs take a WHILE to develop in our system.  Look at Harrison now... look at all the times Harrison was cut by us and by the Ravens...  It is rare that we have Lamarr Woodley rookie season type talent at the OLB position.  And in the event we do, it's because we took an athletic college speed rush end, and converted him to a 3-4 OLB.  That has been the Steeler way.  For the most part the only true LBs we've taken are college ILBs or college OLBs, and then they are converted to ILB.    Alas in the current NFL where the spread offense is now king, and power running is archaic.  The  need to have Levon Kirkland esque linebackers is going by the way-side.  Defenses need to be Jimmy-John's freaky fast to keep up with offenses like the Patriots.  You can't have fat-fuck LBs out there getting gassed after 3-plays, even if they give you highlight material sacks on the occasional play.  Long gone are the days of yesteryear where there were 7-step drop, naked bootleg, Y-spider banana screens...  If a QB holds onto the ball for anywhere longer than 3-seconds in the pocket he is getting hit.  Longer than 5-seconds, he is getting sacked.  The NFL is now about the combination of speed and power.  In the olden days it was about who's stronger and who's tougher.    In conclusion.  Look for Jarvis to have a big year.  And by big year I mean he will start for at least 11-games.  If he has another year where he's bitten by the injury bug and misses a lot of playing time, he may be gone... from starting duty, but I doubt the organization will give up on him.  He will easily earn a 2nd contract, so long as he plays average and doesn't get freakishly injured."
steelers,356v1n,dmremic,10,Fri May 8 12:21:13 2015 UTC,Jarvis Jones or Heyward.  Although I won't be surprised if its James if he does truly get a time share and he can be fresh on a majority of his snaps.

steelers,356v1n,Opuski,3,Thu May 7 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"Multiple NFL teams offered him a contract earlier in the offseason, but he opted to go with the Steelers and the bigger bonus money. He certainly doesn't look like your typical pass rusher, but he has a decent closing speed. I wonder if he's skills are really as translatable to the NFL as the demand indicates. Or do good pass rushers come by so rarely, that many teams want to take a shot with him? His CFL highlights show that his opponent aren't comparable to NFL tackles. But I'm going to read every piece of news they have on him this summer. Exciting addition."

He gets more snaps this season than the last one while Dupree is used sparingly. He was very productive in his limited opportunities last season and he has a better understanding of the defense going into this season. In fact, I could see him doing enough to take the ROLB position from Jones going forward and we feature Moats and Dupree in '16 as our starters at OLB."

steelers,35304k,chaz_batch,14,Wed May 6 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"I mean, he has to be suspended, right? If the only punishment is going to be a fine then every QB in the league is going to do this."

steelers,35304k,DriArcher,8,Wed May 6 18:45:52 2015 UTC,There's no way Goodell suspends him no matter how much he deserves it.  Maybe he'll get a fine but it'll only be a drop in the bucket.
steelers,35304k,Diarygirl,2,Wed May 6 19:02:22 2015 UTC,"Holy cow, I just realized we are playing them week 1.  He has to be suspended for at least 2 games.  This is a huge turn if events."
steelers,35304k,A__Black__Guy,16,Thu May 7 04:12:04 2015 UTC,He has to be suspended; Brady messed with the integrity of the game and lied about it. Even Goodell can't ignore that.
steelers,35304k,batypus,30,Wed May 6 18:34:08 2015 UTC,Just you watch him ignore it.

HOWEVER Vegas supposedly pulled week 1 Steelers vs Patriots off the table.  Brady should be suspended and the Patriots fined.  It's also no coincidence that EACH super bowl won by the Pats has been veiled in controversy.
steelers,35304k,Rorbotron,1 point,Wed May 6 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"And the year the went undefeated and lost in the superbowl to the giants, everyone was watching them trying to catch them filming."

steelers,35304k,Verksus67,3,Wed May 6 19:07:49 2015 UTC,I think there is a high chance the Steelers wont be playing against Tom Brady in the opener....win for the Steelers
steelers,35304k,knightro2323,2,Wed May 6 21:36:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say he gets at least 1, if we are lucky."
steelers,35304k,AssassinPanda97,2,Wed May 6 22:26:00 2015 UTC,"I would damn hope so. But you know, it being the God-like figure that is Tom Brady and knowing Goodell, I'm not sure. I really hope so, and he SHOULD be suspended and that'd be awesome for us. If Tom Brady is suspended, especially  for the opener against us, I would bet my life that we could go into New England and win. But only if Tom Brady is out of the game."
steelers,35304k,EpicallyBoss,3,Thu May 7 00:29:57 2015 UTC,"Do you worry that if we win they'll say we couldn't have done it if Brady were playing?  I think it's only fair since Le'Veon won't be playing, and what he did didn't hurt anybody or affect any games."
steelers,35304k,Diarygirl,1 point,Thu May 7 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah the media and fans will definitely say that but who cares? An away win, is an away win even without Le'Veon, I'll take it. Living in New England I'll definitely hear something like ""BUT IF TAWHM BRADY WAS PLAYIN', HE WOULDA FUCKED YA AHP"" and yeah maybe so, but who cares really, a win is a win. Brady SHOULD be suspended and I will be extremely upset if they can find evidence against him and still not suspend him."
steelers,35304k,EpicallyBoss,1 point,Thu May 7 03:39:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, where do you live?  That must be awful living in New England.    It's all about the money, though.  If the opening game is without Brady and Le'Veon, nobody's gonna want to watch it except for Pats and Steelers fans."
steelers,35304k,Diarygirl,2,Thu May 7 04:00:51 2015 UTC,He gets four games reduced to two. So happy we play them week one!!
steelers,35304k,toadstyle,2,Thu May 7 01:00:24 2015 UTC,"I think Goodell will lean heavily on the Saints Bountygate sanctions as a benchmark.  Those sanctions were as follows:  Coaches and FO - DC Williams was suspended indefinitely;  HC Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season, GM Loomis was suspended for the first eight games of the 2012 season, assistant HC Vitt was suspended for the first six games of the 2012 season.  Players - Vilma was suspended for the entire 2012 NFL season, Anthony Hargrove was suspended for eight games, Will Smith was suspended for four games, and Scott Fujita was suspended for three games.  The Saints were also fined the max. $500,000 and had to forfeit their second round draft picks in 2012 and 2013.  Because the Pats are repeat cheating offenders and because they and Brady did not cooperate with the investigation, I would guess the sanctions would be something along the following lines:  Belichick â one year suspension (see HC Payton)  Brady â one year suspension (see player Vilma)  Two locker room guys â indefinite suspensions  Max. $500,000 fine  Forfeiture of 2016 1st round draft pick or multiple lower round picks"
steelers,35304k,consigliere58,9,Wed May 6 21:15:47 2015 UTC,I really wish this would happen but there is zero chance they will do it. Goodell will never suspend Brady for an entire year. We'd be lucky for a game
steelers,35304k,A4thLineDuster7,2,Wed May 6 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"Goodell is a vindictive SOB.  If he believes you've lied to him he takes it personally..  Add into that non-cooperation and the flat out defiance showed by Kraft , he's going to use it all as ammunition.  Kraft demanded an apology and snubbed him at the Super Bowl, plus he's still in denial and defiant with that last press release.  With everything in totality, there are going to be severe fines , and Brady will probably wind up getting a 4-6 game suspension reduced to 1-2 games after appeal."
steelers,35304k,chaz_batch,1 point,Wed May 6 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"Oh man, if only.  Slim chance of basically any of that happening, though, in my opinion.  That was right at the height (not start) of the player-safety movement.  It also directly affected people's health.  This is simply cheating, nothing that would injure anybody directly."
steelers,35304k,dangerm0use,1 point,Wed May 6 21:33:54 2015 UTC,I was just listening to longtime former GM Bill Polian on ESPN talk about just how serious an offense he thought this was. He convinced me that Brady and the Pats were going to get hit with more than a token fine.
steelers,35304k,consigliere58,1 point,Wed May 6 21:42:31 2015 UTC,Didn't the report find that it was essentially on Brady and the two locker room guys and that nobody else was involved? I don't think Belichick will face any consequences.
steelers,35304k,all_nines,5,Thu May 7 00:26:21 2015 UTC,"You could be right, but Goodell has a history in these cases (e.g., Bountygate, Atlanta crowd noise) of assigning some responsibility to the GM even though they may have known nothing about the infractions. Since Belichick is the GM/HC, I'm guessing that he will probably face some sanctions, based on precedent.  Because of Spygate I think Goodell may drop the hammer on him."
steelers,35304k,consigliere58,0,Thu May 7 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"The only way out would be the fact that in that case, they were acting directly contrary to player safety. While cheating is arguably worse, with the history of this administration, player safety is only second to not arguing with the commissioner's office, or by extension referees, on the priority list."
steelers,35304k,Dynamar,1 point,Wed May 6 21:33:00 2015 UTC,"I was listening to the Lebatard show today, and they were talking about Brady giving people Uggs for doing things for him.  Is this for real, or was it a joke?  I can't read the entire Wells report."

steelers,35304k,TheSaltbird,3,Thu May 7 01:11:19 2015 UTC,Why not? Who is Robert kraft in relation to every other owner in the NFL? He's certainly traded barbs with the Rooney's and their name is stronger than Robert Kraft.
steelers,35304k,Rorbotron,-6,Wed May 6 19:40:33 2015 UTC,Kraft is one of the most powerful owners in the NFL. If you don't understand that then you're not paying attention
steelers,35304k,xyentist,3,Wed May 6 19:43:05 2015 UTC,The Rooney's aren't?
steelers,35304k,Rorbotron,-2,Wed May 6 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"Because it's not a police investigation and you're allowed to choose not to hand over your property to someone because they ask to see it?  It was also an NFL investigation, and we don't know if the NFLPA cautioned Brady against handing over his phone. I do know that if I were his lawyer, and they asked to see his phone, I would have had to bill Brady three hours for the time I spent laughing.  Fact remains that there is no evidence of wrong doing, and to suddenly start punishing players, teams and employees of those teams on someone's best guess is a slippery slope."
steelers,35304k,xyentist,8,Wed May 6 18:41:47 2015 UTC,"Have you even read the report?  There is a butt load of circumstantial evidence, beyond his refusal to turn over records... the numerous gifts, the texts, sudden phone calls to the trainer immediately after the news broke - someone he hadn't talked to in weeks, his denials he even knew who Mcnally was or ever talked to him - directly contradicted by both Jastremski and Mcnally."
steelers,35304k,chaz_batch,4,Wed May 6 19:02:09 2015 UTC,There was no evidence against Roethlisberger either...  he got 6 damn games.
steelers,35304k,DF_1982,-2,Wed May 6 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"Correction: you think it makes him look more guilty. I think Brady sitting with them and answering their question filled his role in cooperating. He has every right to refuse to hand over his personal property and private communications.  LOL, so guarding your privacy makes you guilty? So if the cops ask to search your house without a warrant, you're ok with that since you have nothing to hide?"
steelers,35304k,xyentist,5,Thu May 7 04:51:33 2015 UTC,Simply refusing to hand over his phone does not make him look guilty.  Seeing all of the circumstantial evidence against him AND knowing that he refused to hand over his phone makes him look guilty as fuck.
steelers,35304k,drunkenjagoff,3,Wed May 6 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and the Ginger Dictator will use everything in totality when deciding what to do... but fuck Goodell."
steelers,35304k,chaz_batch,5,Wed May 6 19:49:32 2015 UTC,He has every right to not turn them over.. however his employers have every right to use his refusal against him and punish him.  This isnt a criminal matter.
steelers,35304k,chaz_batch,-2,Wed May 6 20:00:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the NFLPA will flay them alive. Unless you think management telling a union employee ""let us see your phone or you'll be fined"" is something they're gonna let slide."
steelers,35304k,xyentist,4,Wed May 6 21:17:13 2015 UTC,That is dependent upon what is in the CBA.   Goodell can use Brady's refusal to turn over the records as a factor when deciding any type of punishment.  That's not debatable.     The report also states they believe there was a violation of NFL policy and non-cooperation by the Patriots in one instance - and that WILL be a factor.

He MIGHT have done it, but even then frankly people are making this blowing this air pressure shit to insane lengths. I love rooting against the patriots because they are a formidable foe, but damn you guys are taking this too far. Plus who wants to beat a Brady-less Patriots.

If they gave out Ike Taylor's number, a guy that spent his entire career with the organization and was a vital piece in winning 2 championships (not to mention a favorite of Dan Rooney's), right after he's retired... They're not going to reserve Woodley's number, a guy that was dominant for a few years and then was cut because he couldn't stay in shape."

steelers,34z514,Lieucen,6,Tue May 5 21:27:18 2015 UTC,"With the mental errors already attested to, I'd like to add some context to the conversation, if I am able.  I guess this my (reluctant) defense of Mitchell.   First, as bad as he was, he was still second on the team in tackles.  It can be argued that poor coverage lead to him being targeted more, leading to more tackles.  While this may be the case, unless you undertake a thorough study of film and know for sure what the coverage assignments are, it's hard to really know who is to blame when coverages are blown.  When that happens, it's easy to assume it's the  fault of the deep FS.  Coverage in general was substandard in '14 with plenty of blame to go around.  Anyway, his 71 tackles compare favorably to Ryan Clark's career best 74 (second best of 71).    Second, he wasn't awesome, but created a couple turnovers. He had two forces fumbles also tie Clark's career best #s, and is on par with Clark's average of 2.25 TOs (during years with steelers).   Three, groin injuries are part of the disappointing stats.   He's fast, having ran a 4.35 at his combine not that long ago.  And agile. It's understandable that your instincts about how quickly you can get to your coverage assignment are going to be off when you've got a couple tweaked/pulled/torn groin muscles. Add into the equation the time it takes to learn a defensive system and the added difficulty of being a safety opposite the unpredictable Troy Polamalu, and it starts to become clear why the Tomlin and Lake aren't as discouraged as us, the fans.   Ultimately, I share in your frustration and disappointment, but will give coach T and the FO the benefit of the doubt.  For now, I remain cautiously optimistic and very impatient for next season."
steelers,34z514,ajk5376,4,Wed May 6 07:05:11 2015 UTC,The first time I pulled my groin was the only time I made the mistake of applying Flexall 454 to the crotchal region .

steelers,34z514,huet99,5,Tue May 5 20:02:20 2015 UTC,Probably because these were either very minor tears or weren't tears at all
steelers,34z514,MattEven,3,Wed May 6 03:37:08 2015 UTC,Also remember he was playing with a Troy Polamalu who is a shell of what he used to be. Mike had to run in and try to clean up for Troy a lot last year. Add the fact he's on a new team with new coaches and playing with an injury. I still believe he can be the guy they brought him in here to be.
steelers,34z514,huet99,4,Wed May 6 13:49:26 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure most torn groins are hard to play on. Let alone two. Maybe he had strains, but he also had a lot of problems with just not being in coverage over the top. I remember one play Ike stopped tracking someones route, thinking Mitchell was over the top, and it resulted in a touchdown. Things like that have nothing to do with injury, although some of his play was probably impacted."

steelers,34z514,NapoleonBlownapart87,2,Tue May 5 20:35:14 2015 UTC,"Things like that have nothing to do with injury,    That's not necessarily true. If he doesn't have the mobility to get into the right position (to get deep) then that could be connected with the injury. Even if safeties have deep responsibilities they can't adjust for lack of mobility by starting deeper because they are giving away the scheme.  Now, I would argue that if this was that bad that they should have let him heal and let Thomas or Allen play, but that's neither here nor there now I suppose."

steelers,34zuv8,Intropy_,2,Tue May 5 22:54:54 2015 UTC,"Smith seems to be more ready to play, but Dupree is the superior talent. I'd say its a fair evaluation, and we seem to be going more for athletes than football players. It makes sense too, because we have an incredible coaching staff who are very capable of developing athletes into highly skilled football players. Our new d coordinator coached farrior, Foote, porter, Harrison, Woodley, Timmons and others to be great players in their prime. And now one of them has returned to be the new linebackers coach. Bud will understand the game as a player more and more each snap he takes, it's a very good pick not just because he's a great athlete, but it sounds like he's very smart and teachable as well."
steelers,34xerx,steelbydesign,7,Tue May 5 10:43:02 2015 UTC,"He's an athletic freak to be sure, but NFL tackles are pretty athletic in their own right as well. If he can add a couple of moves beyond just the speed rush and then the inside counter he's going to be great. That'll take time though.  I don't want to come off as doom and gloom though so let me also add an additional note that isn't in those tweets. The kid is really solid in coverage. Good awareness in his zone, knows how to read the QB, and can use his athleticism to close on screens and dump offs. Between Dupree, Shazier, and Timmons offenses are going to want to go North-South because East-West is NOT going to end well."
steelers,34xerx,NapoleonBlownapart87,3,Tue May 5 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"He needs work for sure... but I don't understand the people that act like he's this massive project.  He has experience in a similar scheme to ours, and was moved all over the place, he's a quick twitch player, he already has NFL size (unlike most OLB's the Steelers grab), and like you said he's great in coverage.  Sure, he has to add more to his pass rushing repertoire, but what rookie doesn't?"
steelers,34xerx,NapoleonBlownapart87,2,Tue May 5 15:10:50 2015 UTC,"but I don't understand the people that act like he's this massive project.   Pessimism/Skepticism mostly. With that being said it doesn't mean its not warranted. Technique is not the easiest thing to teach and implement. There is a ton of nuance to it and you also need to hardwire it into your processes to not lose speed.   Here's an easy example from Jarvis Jones: he tends to initiate the bull rush off of his inside foot, which is a no-no (driving off the outside leg gives you more power). Seems easy enough right? But it's not as simple as just push off the other leg, he has to:   Better understand his footwork at the beginning of the rush so he has the appropriate spacing to initiate the drive off of the outside foot. Since his timing in his feet have changed he also needs to rework the timing of his upper body. He also has to rework his spin move (which he'll use off the bull rush sometimes) as well since things have changed. And he needs to be able to do all of this without thinking - it needs to be second nature.   This of course takes a ton of coaching, reps, and work. It doesn't happen overnight and in some cases it doesn't happen at all. There have been tons of athletic freaks like Gholston and Maybin who haven't been able to convert that athleticism to production because (among other things) poor technique.  Again - I don't want to be doom and gloom here. I think Dupree has the gifts, coaching, and support to become a really solid pass rusher, but it will likely take time. What I will say is that it'll be interesting to see how Butler might use Dupree in the interim in sub-packages in an effort to get him in positions to succeed on blitzes and things of that nature."
steelers,34xerx,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Tue May 5 15:20:38 2015 UTC,"I understand all of that. My point is there's very few guys that come into the NFL as near finished products.  Guys are drafted on potential. Vic Beasley went 8th overall because he's insanely quick. Does he need to hone his physical skills into becoming a good pass rusher? Of course.  My point is that Bud Dupree has really all the things you want from a 1st round pick. He could bust, but the things you can't teach are already there."
steelers,34xerx,zjrk,2,Tue May 5 15:32:14 2015 UTC,"He could bust,   Exactly, so there's nothing wrong with people expressing skepticism and caution about that. He's a solid prospect but he's not a sure thing and there is a decent amount of work that needs to be done to make sure that he's a great OLB as opposed to an average or below average one.  As far as the ""size"" of the project... well we don't know. Like most athletic freaks he probably relied on speed and strength so he never had to worry about technique. At the NFL level. athletes can't continue to survive without solid technique. How quick of a study he is on that technique will determine the size of the project. If he's a fast learner, he could be a nightmare of a pass rusher by the end of his first season. If he's a slow learner (or if he can't learn it at all) then the size of the project increases.  There's always going to be questions about athletic freaks and that's okay - you acknowledge the upside when you take them. Again I don't think it's a bad pick, I'm just acknowledging from the beginning that his maturation (from a football standpoint) will likely take some time."
steelers,34xerx,IveGotAGifForThat,6,Tue May 5 16:17:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, he is pretty much at the ball by the handoff in that third one, pushing the tackle into the blocking back. That's intense. I get more excited about this pick every day.    Can it be football now pls?"
steelers,34xerx,zjrk,5,Tue May 5 11:22:58 2015 UTC,"He'll be great if can learn to use his arms a bit better. He has a tendency to just bum rush defenders, and if they wrap him up he gets stuck pretty good. I'm sure Harrison can teach him that."

steelers,34z4i0,huet99,4,Tue May 5 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"PFF is a decent site. They are best known for their grading system where they watch each player each play and give the performance a score that is summable to game scores and season scores. They also have some metrics that they report that are based on statistics. But those metrics are generally fairly basic things like tackling efficiency or receiving yards per route run. I would class them as a subjective plays grading site with a minor in basic metrics rather than as an advances metrics site.  Importantly, they did not do their per play grading for college football. Their judgments here are based primarily on their metrics, which, as I said, are fairly basic. That's not to say they are worthless. On the contrary metrics are useful, and objective. But they are not the whole story, and here they are even less of the story than PFF generally gives."
steelers,34z4i0,Intropy_,3,Tue May 5 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"One of the problems with PFF is that they rarely know/care what the player's assignment was.  Typically, this doesn't really matter all that much because most players do exactly what you think they would be doing.  For example, Revis is the best corner in the league, so when he has a smart coach he lines up 1 on 1 against the team's best receiver.  He gets graded as if his job was to line up and take away the team's best option.    That said, we all know there are players who are used in really stupid ways, or certain positions where your job is really just to absorb blockers rather than make tackles.  It's those guys who usually receive weird grades from PFF.    All this to say, that I would totally agree that Dupree did not have nearly good enough numbers to justify the pick if you grade him as an edge rusher.  That said, he is also one of the most talented cover linebackers in the draft, and Kentucky used him as such.  He dropped into coverage way more often than you would think, and that was on obvious passing downs where most coaches would have used him to rush the passer.    His numbers still aren't great, and it's true that Porter will have to do a lot of work with Dupree's technique to get him where he needs to be, but I'm not really all that concerned.  It will take time, but in 3 years I think he'll be a beast.  In the mean time, he'll be a valuable role player who will give us some pass rush and some answer to what to do against these ridiculously athletic TEs."
steelers,34z4i0,tennmyc21,2,Tue May 5 22:56:31 2015 UTC,"Goddamn, you guys shit  all over PFF, at least they try to quantify stuff instead of having bullshit opinion pieces.

Hes arguably in those same metrics, more explosive than clowney.  (accounting for broad jump and vertical jump)  https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2013/05/01/jarvis-jones-buyer-beware/"

He had ""stats"" in the SEC, but dear lord, he was a lucky mofo that season (fumbles bouncing into his hands, coverage sacks, et cetera)."
steelers,34z4i0,Rorbotron,2,Tue May 5 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"The steelers would not have drafted him where they did if he had those sort of red flags.  The fact of the matter is when the steelers draft mid round they usually knock it out of the park and the only miss in the last 15 years has been Ziggy hood.  Jarvis Jones gets a ridiculously bad wrap from the fan base and its not seated in ANY sort of reality.  Rookie year, sophomore season lost to wrist."
steelers,34z4i0,chaz_batch,2,Tue May 5 22:26:21 2015 UTC,"Ziggy Hood was pick #32 .. practically a 2nd rounder.  And about Jarvis, people seem to forget Timmons barely sniffed the field his first two years.  He had the luxury playing behind established starters, and it took him two years to bulk up and learn and be comfortable in the system.  Jarvis (and Shazier) was thrown in there right away, let's see what he does this year before declaring him a bust."
steelers,34z4i0,SleestakLightning,-1,Tue May 5 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"Timmon also showed flashes. Jarvis looked okay at best the beginning of last year, but nothing close to a first rounder."
steelers,34z4i0,Rorbotron,1 point,Wed May 6 15:44:09 2015 UTC,He also has some of the worst measurables of any OLB drafted in the first round since advanced football stats became a thing.  He's a horrible athlete which means it's going to be even harder for him to become a productive 34 OLB.
steelers,34z4i0,SleestakLightning,1 point,Tue May 5 22:33:01 2015 UTC,Horrible athlete?  He's in the fucking NFL.  Do you realize how many players have had shit combines and went on to be fantastic NFL players? Terrell Suggs comes to mind.  James Harrison was cut how many times?
steelers,34z4i0,Rorbotron,0,Wed May 6 19:55:24 2015 UTC,"LOL Suggs ran a faster 40 than Jarvis did on his home track. But there's more to what I'm talking about than just 40 times.   Jones' vertical, 3 cone, shuttle, bench press, etc. are all historically AWFUL for OLB. Especially for pass rushers."
steelers,34z4i0,SleestakLightning,0,Wed May 6 21:28:16 2015 UTC,Suggs had a underwhelming total combine and a SLEW of other players were in the same ballpark.  Crap combine performance isn't always the best indicator of NFL success just as out of this world combine performance isn't always the best indicator.  The fact of the matter is the Steelers drafted Jarvis pretty high in the first round based on his game tape and interviews.  Why would the Steelers blow the 17th pick in the draft on a guy you pretty clearly think is the worst first round pass rushing prospect in however long?  The Steelers as I've said here and elsewhere have had one miss in the last 20 and that was Ziggy Hood and he was at the bottom of the first.  Why is it so hard for people to give the guy a healthy season before passing judgement?
steelers,34z4i0,Rorbotron,2,Wed May 6 22:04:59 2015 UTC,"You need to look up WALDO and #ForcePlayers#. You'd be surprised at how much analytics can tell you about how successful a pass rusher will be.  Jarvis was literally the worst tested OLB athlete that's been drafted since they began measuring explosiveness.   The Steelers freely admit they made a mistake with Jarvis. You know why? The very next year after Jarvis they went out and used pretty much every single pick on a SPARQ superstar athlete.  Shazier tested off the charts, Tuitt tested well, Archer was a speed guy. They not only corrected but they corrected hard. They did it again this year. They finally embraced the modern analytics and it changed the type of players they're drafting.  It can't be a coincidence that it happened the year after Colbert sounded like a dumbass saying the team was happy Jarvis was slow as shit at his pro day because it helped him fall.  I'm willing to give Jarvis a chance. I just don't think he is going to be any good. The numbers are on my side of this debate too. Very few pass rushers were ever successful with the awful numbers he put up.  You keep beating the Suggs drum but here's the thing...Jones was WAAAAAY worse than Suggs. Jones also had one year of production in college whereas Suggs was outstanding in college. He had production, he set the single season sack record. Suggs was a million times the college player that Jarvis was. Comparing the two is insulting to Suggs."
steelers,34z4i0,SleestakLightning,1 point,Thu May 7 01:30:46 2015 UTC,You are assuming an awful lot when you say the steelers admit their mistake with jones by drafting explosive players last year and this year.  Are you gonna be here eating crow if you are wrong?  I certainly will be if I'm incorrect on Jones.
steelers,34z4i0,Zack_of_Steel,1 point,Thu May 7 01:50:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not assuming anything. They went with a historically terrible athlete one season then completely changed the style of player they draft the very next year and it's a coincidence? No.  If I am wrong, I will admit I am wrong. I probably won't be wrong. Jones has yet to show anything (even in college) that shows he can be a productive 34 pass rusher."
steelers,34z4i0,Deckz,-3,Thu May 7 01:57:04 2015 UTC,"Watch his tape. All of his sacks came against players that are not in the league and he was often stonewalled by TEs.   SleestakLightning covered an important point as well. His measurables were among the worst of ANY LB to come out. His KEI (Kirwan Explosion Index, one prime indicator of pass rush success when applied to historically good pass rushers) was a paltry 59.75. A good KEI is 70+ (bench + vert + broad jump). On top of that, he boasts a blazing 4.88 40 and a 7.46 3-cone. And these were at 6'2 245, compared to Dupree who shit on his measurables at 6'4"" 269.  Jarvis is weak, slow, and his tape is uninspiring. Past success in the draft does not exempt a team from a huge whiff. Jarvis would've been a better fit in a 4-3, something he has in common with the other bust you mentioned, Ziggy Hood who was a 3-Technique DT ALL THE WAY, but we wasted 5 years ramming a square peg into a round hole.   Tomlin's background is in the 4-3 and we've seen 4-3 players drafted in his tenure and smushed into our 3-4. Timmons was drafted to play 3-4 OLB (to replace Peezy) just like Jarvis and it was dumb luck that he was able to transition inside. Jarvis screams of a Tomlin pick, thanks to his ""stats"" in the SEC. lol  Also, to those comparing the Timmons situation to Jarvis's, you're off base. Timmons was drafted and plugged in at OLB in year one and then had to swap positions. He and Foote shared snaps at Mack (567 Larry/512 Timmons) in his sophomore season and he played exceptionally well in that role and killed it on LeBeau's crossfire blitz.  Edit: I HOPE that Jarvis can turn out the way Timmons did, but I said the moment we drafted him that his only success would be if they moved him to Buck/SILB/LILB where he could concentrate on being a thumper. But that went out the window when we drafted Shazier to play Mack/WILB/RILB and slid Timmons over to Buck permanently."
steelers,34z4i0,Zack_of_Steel,1 point,Tue May 5 23:21:11 2015 UTC,"If you think it was luck you're dreaming. They knew what they had in woodley and timmons, they didn't switch his position over night, it was a calculated decision base in player development and need. Jarvis isn't a bust yet, and that list has some shitty players on it as well."
steelers,34z4i0,Deckz,1 point,Wed May 6 05:57:19 2015 UTC,"Prove it. Point to his tape. His Alabama game was the game everyone pointed to because of his sacks and FF against top competition. That game was atrocious and hard to watch. In the first minute alone of that video he's single-teamed by a TE and gets no push/failed to shed the block as the RB ran past him.   But sure.   As for Timmons, no, they stated unequivocally that he was drafted as a ROLB to replace Porter. They had no idea that Harrison would explode in 2007 and then they moved him to ILB in 2008.    Tomlin also said firmly ""we're a 3-4 team and he's a right outside linebacker.""   But sure. lol  Edit: Jarvis's one redeeming quality is his tenacity. He doesn't give up on plays and he seems like a great guy from the interviews I've seen. As I said before, I sincerely hope he turns out, but I just don't see him having success at 3-4 OLB unless he can learn some Dwight Freeney pass rush moves or some shit."
steelers,34z4i0,Steinerway,-1,Wed May 6 19:23:48 2015 UTC,"PFF is not advanced metrics, they're an opinion site that uses some minor stats they find important. There's often a large disparity between what is seen on tape and their writing. I wouldn't put much stock in it at all. Secondly, the steelers know Dupree has a lot of learning ahead of him, he's a big athletic lump of clay, let the process take care of itself. I just wouldn't expect 10 sacks next season, probably two season from now."

steelers,34u8dv,Brutuss,8,Tue May 5 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"Football obviously gets all the attention in the draft, but it's pretty crazy that on a Thursday or Friday night some random guy a thousand miles away just tells everyone where you're going to live for the next 5 or so years.  Then the next morning you're basically expected to get on a plane and go there, and at least pretend like you like it, all while simultaneously arranging to move your whole life, wife and kids (if any) up, finding a rental apartment or starting a house search, learning which neighborhood to live in, dealing with  everything from car registration to your new contract, finding a new dentist and the best way to drive to the practice facility, blah blah blah.

steelers,35011t,shaad20,1 point,Wed May 6 17:54:31 2015 UTC,"Have you watched Boyd on the college level? That's my logic here, he doesn't look like a QB and likely would find more success playing an entirely different position. You can say similar things about Pryor for sure, but I still prefer him based on what they did in college and also what they've shown in the NFL. In Boyds case that means failing to make two separate rosters as a QB when one of those teams was the most QB starved team in the league minus the Cards."

Terrelle Pryor was a top-five recruit out of highschool, his performances were staggered in college, and he ended up getting drafted in the THIRD ROUND of the supplemental draft (which is essentially the bad boys draft). I'd much rather claim that I was drafted in the 6th round of the NFL draft than in the third round of the supplemental draft."

steelers,34v2nm,TommyFresh,6,Mon May 4 20:22:09 2015 UTC,Hey stick with your guns. I want Holliman on the roster too. He doesn't have to be an all star tackler and it doesn't take that long to become a passable tackler. This guys ball hawking is awesome and worth the risk of a few missed tackles.
steelers,34v2nm,White_Bread21,1 point,Tue May 5 01:56:02 2015 UTC,He has to be able to tackle to play safety. To think otherwise is asinine. That's literally half of the job.  If he can't tackle he isn't going to be able to see the field.  Now how much of his poor tackling was because of his shoulder injury remains to be seen.
steelers,34v2nm,SleestakLightning,3,Tue May 5 22:34:25 2015 UTC,"There was a post earlier today which went through a few 53 man roster predictions, here's mine.    QB:  Ben, Bruce, Jones  RB:  LeVeon Bell, DeAngelo Williams, Dri Archer, Josh Harris  FB:  Will Johnson  WR:  Antonio Brown, Martavis Bryant, Markus Wheaton, Sammie Coates, Darrius Heyward-Bey  TE:  Heath Miller,  Matt Spaeth, Jesse James  OL:  Kelvin Beachum, Ramon Foster, Maurkice Pouncey, David DeCastro, Marcus Gilbert, Mike Adams, Cody Wallace, Hubbard  DL:  Steve McLendon, Daniel McCullers, Cameron Heyward, Stephon Tuitt, Clifton Geathers, Letterius Walton  OLB:  Bud Dupree, Jarvis Jones, James Harrison, Arthur Moats  ILB:  Ryan Shazier, Lawrence Timmons, Sean Spence, Vince Williams, Terence Garvin  S:  Mike Mitchell, Shamarko Thomas, Will Allen, Robert Golden, Ross Ventrone  CB:  Cortez Allen, William Gay, Antwan Blake, Senquez Golson, Doran Grant, B.W. Webb  K:  Shaun Suisham  P:  Brad Wing  LS:  Greg Warren   I few things to note about yours, firstly, i'm not sure we would get by with only Deangelo Williams as our only pure back during bells suspension, Colbert has mentioned that he plans on using Harris in this period so i expect to have him activated in week 1.  The 3rd QB is up for debate, I feel like Jones has the advantage because we have more invested in him but hey, everyone likes a competition.  Might see Branchflower take that 3rd TE spot due to having a year of experience under his belt, but again, will come down to preseason performance most likely.  Your OL is spot on in my opinion.  I can see Cam Thomas being cut before the season for cap reasons, also im not sure if we need 7 DL in a 3-4.  I said this in my prediction already but I don't see Chickilo making the team, he has nearly no experience as a 3-4 OLB and that wont cut it in our defence, not this year at least.  I'd say Garvin over Zumwalt purely because Garvin is a great special teams contributor and his ability to play OLB, this could come down to pre season.  Robert Golden will definitely make the team, he's our special teams captain! I'd also be very surprised to see Holliman in the 53 man roster, the dude can't tackle and he's slow, that means he can't play special teams and if you're a backup safety who can't play special teams, you aint making the team. He needs time to develop, I don't see an advantage in keeping him sidelined. I'd also expect Ventrone to make the team, dude proved he could play when called upon and he's another special teams stud, plus with Polamalu gone we need to keep up the hair quota."
steelers,34v2nm,TechnoViking94,3,Mon May 4 22:37:48 2015 UTC,"Sweet!  Yeah I agree that the investment in Jones could guarantee him the spot. I think we'll go into the season with three QBs although I don't think it'd hurt to just have two...  Ya, I feel like if Blanchflower was a serviceable TE3, we wouldn't have drafted James at all. Competition is good though and since training camp hasn't even started, it's hard to get an accurate read of how much he's developed.  I'd love for Cam Thomas to get cut!  I think Joey Porter is really high on him. And I assume Porter probably doesn't have much of a say in the draft room. I take that as the whole organization is pretty on board with him. Plus, Porter said there'd be 4-5 spots and we need help on the outside.  I just really like Zumwalt. He definitely suffered from not being able to participate in practice until graduation but I think he has a higher ceiling than Garvin. The whole IR thing seemed like a way to redshirt Zumwalt without leaving him open on the PS.  And yeah, definitely agree about Golden over Holliman. Was still riding the high of the draft. I like Ventrone a lot (I went to CV for a while) but I think if these rookies can hold their own on special teams, he may get cut."
steelers,34v2nm,TechnoViking94,3,Mon May 4 22:58:14 2015 UTC,"The main reason I rolled with only 4 OLB's is because Garvin has the ability to play outside, thus nullifying the loss of depth. Zumwalt may be the answer, I can't say i've seen enough of him to argue either way. I still stand by my opinion that Chickillo will not make the team however. The guy is transitioning from playing on the line in a 4-3 to playing OLB in a 3-4, that will take alot of work on his behalf and in my opinion will keep him off the field for a year, but hey, I hope i'm wrong."
steelers,34v2nm,DRU_leggo,2,Mon May 4 23:11:35 2015 UTC,I have a big problem with you cutting Golden for Holliman. Golden was a ST captain last year and is a very capable backup at either safety spot. Holliman is slow and can't tackle so he's no help as a special teamer and he is a long way from seeing the field at either safety spot. He will to need to have one of the greatest training camps of all time to knock off Golden.
steelers,34v2nm,Punch_Broadbent,1 point,Mon May 4 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"Ya, I'm inclined to agree with you. I was expecting more growth from Golden so I had him cut as a necessity. But thinking back on it, I agree that he stays and Holliman or one of the 6th rounders ends up on the PS."
steelers,34v2nm,Aekwon,2,Mon May 4 22:37:54 2015 UTC,"Good write-up, good read. Thanks for posting!   I hope Mike Mitchell doesn't suck so much this year. Every time there's a big play against us, I feel like it's because Mike Mitchell fucked up. Why did we sign him for 5 years at 5 million per? Goddamn is he bad. I Miss Ryan Clark. He's the biggest albatross of a contract we have, it's embarrassing."
steelers,34v2nm,SleestakLightning,2,Tue May 5 14:32:44 2015 UTC,"Good list but I think Howard Jones and Shawn Lemon are being overlooked here. The OLB and ILB training camp battles will be insane this year, can't wait."
steelers,34v2nm,ImPhelpsingIt,1 point,Tue May 5 15:27:08 2015 UTC,No way they keep only 8 O-linemen. They'll keep at least 9.  Zumwalt is an OLB. Terence Williams is probably making the team. One of Zumwalt or Shawn Lemon will make the team as the 5th OLB.  BW Webb isn't making the team. They'll keep 5 CBs.  Robert Golden isn't getting cut. Especially not for Gerod Holliman. Not going to happen. Golden was the ST captain last season.
steelers,34v2nm,GWildKat,1 point,Tue May 5 22:35:41 2015 UTC,What exactly do you think RB will look like at the beginning of the season? How do the spots work out with Bell being suspended? Do we get an extra roster spot while he's suspended? I don't think we'd go 3 whole games just running Williams and Archer.
steelers,34v2nm,Punch_Broadbent,1 point,Wed May 6 17:21:23 2015 UTC,"I believe as long as Bell is suspended, we are free to use his spot on the active roster. I see Harris getting that spot and being used a lot in those first three games, thus getting the chance to beat out Archer when Bell does return. I'd be pleasantly surprised if Harris is that good though as I think Archer's speed and draft spot give him the edge. I can also see the Steelers placing one of the rookies from the 6th/7th rounds on the practice squad to keep Harris."

He's great for fantasy but I certainly don't trust his instincts here. He's also not a big fan of the Steelers as a whole IIRC.  I think A is a tad optimistic, so if we toss out the highest and lowest scores we still balance out to a solid B-B+ average."
steelers,34txv0,NapoleonBlownapart87,23,Mon May 4 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly he's a Ravens fan. So I wouldn't expect any praise and he's kind of an idiot with this anyways. Before the draft he said Bud Dupree will probably go in the first 8 and could be an immediate starter. Since we drafted him he's become a ""project"" for the steelers."
steelers,34txv0,Verksus67,6,Mon May 4 16:16:03 2015 UTC,Haha wow - also gives a bit more context to his note about the Steelers missing out on Maxx....
steelers,34txv0,NapoleonBlownapart87,7,Mon May 4 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"I think A is a tad optimistic   I don't know how you score anyone an A then. Those that draft in the back half of the first round aren't getting players that will be odds on favorites to be day one starters, and those that draft early like a 1st or 2nd overall QB have shown for decades now that they could easily bust.  The Steelers didn't reach and covered every major need. That's an A+ to me. They won the division last year, are returning the ENTIRE top tier offense, and they brought in fresh meat to replace the aging veterans that were garbage all season long. These new guys can't possibly be any worse than what they had."
steelers,34txv0,tonytroz,6,Mon May 4 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"I think to really score an A or an A+ there needs to be quite a bit of luck involved. We got that in the first with Dupree falling to #22, and I also think there were a couple of solid day 3 picks. The second day wasn't as great. I thought Golson was a touch of a reach given his size, and I say that not because I don't think he's going to be a solid player, but I think a lot of teams would have had a 3rd round grade on him.  In addition the Coates pick wasn't a need. Solid blocker and a great athlete, but he's got issues with drops and he doesn't run the full route tree - I think there were other players here.  Don't get me wrong, I would give the draft an A-/B+ so I'm very pleased - I just think of A drafts as being ones with multiple steals or guys that can surely step into base starting roles. To your point those types of drafts tend to be towards the top of the draft and that is why there is partiy in the league (for the most part)."
steelers,34txv0,NapoleonBlownapart87,9,Mon May 4 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of what I'm seeing is that Day 1 and Day 3 picks were worthy of A-grades but that Day 2 is where we lose marks because people think Golson was a reach at 2 and that Coates is a luxury at 3, and that those criticizing Coates at 3 generally don't give any benefit of doubt given Colbert's track record with picking WR talent.  And I have to say I kind of agree on Golson, while I don't hate the pick I can't help but think he would have been available later, but in the end it sounded like they got the players they wanted so it maybe it doesn't matter too much what rounds they got them in."

steelers,34txv0,enragedvujiji,2,Mon May 4 22:50:34 2015 UTC,"College receivers are shorter and slower, and college QBs are less accurate. Everyone acknowledges that he has elite ball skills, but he was also the smallest DB at the combine. There are legitimate questions surrounding his ability to translate elite college-level play into the NFL. There are plenty of elite college players who couldn't hack it in the pros due to physical limitations."
steelers,34txv0,TitoTheMidget,5,Tue May 5 04:03:16 2015 UTC,I just don't see how a 7th round pick could score that low on a guy who could end up being a damn good player if he can be taught the right techniques.

Think about it, we got a solid lineup of Brown, Bryant, Heyward-bay, Coates. I'm leaving Wheaton out because I think Brown might just be a little quicker. You could maybe count Dri Archer too if you class him as a wide receiver. I suppose he would either replace Brown or Heyward-bay, since I'm not sure how quick Heyward-bay is these days. Anyway, quite fun to think about."
steelers,34txv0,TechnoViking94,1 point,Mon May 4 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's an interesting thought, but what jumped out to me was more the notion that Holliman would need to step on the field week 1.

RB:  LeVeon Bell, DeAngelo Williams, Dri Archer, Josh Harris - Josh might not last the whole season on the roster but he will be needed during Bell's suspension, I don't believe we can rely on only Deangelo and Dri during that time.  FB:  Will Johnson  WR:  Antonio Brown, Martavis Bryant, Markus Wheaton, Sammie Coates, Darrius Heyward-Bey  TE:  Heath Miller,  Matt Spaeth, Jesse James - Maybe Branchflower over James? pre-season may determine this.  OL:  Kelvin Beachum, Ramon Foster, Maurkice Pouncey, David DeCastro, Marcus Gilbert, Mike Adams, Cody Wallace, BJ Finney, Hubbard - Back end could get mixed up a bit before the season, but this is as good a prediction as any. Also Hubbard got resigned this year, making me think he has enough to make the team.  DL:  Steve McLendon, Daniel McCullers, Cameron Heyward, Stephon Tuitt, Clifton Geathers, Letterius Walton - We all hate Cam, but we might see him here if somebody under performs.  OLB:  Bud Dupree, Jarvis Jones, James Harrison, Arthur Moats - Don't see Chickillo making the roster, he's a depelopment guy, he's not experienced playing OLB in a 3-4, will need a year to learn the position. Also, i don't think we need 5 outside linebackers, not with the versatility and depth we have inside.  ILB:  Ryan Shazier, Lawrence Timmons, Sean Spence, Vince Williams, Terence Garvin - Garvin will never see the field, purely special teams I feel.  S:  Mike Mitchell, Shamarko Thomas, Will Allen, Robert Golden, Ross Ventrone -  Holliman Will never make the team unless he learns to tackle, did you forget Will Allen? I suspect Ventrone and Golden will rarely see the field outside of ST also  CB:  Cortez Allen, William Gay, Antwan Blake, Senquez Golson, Doran Grant - B.W. Webb Might make the team eventually, maybe if Harris is dropped when Bell comes back.  K:  Shaun Suisham  P:  Brad Wing - Wouldn't be surprised to see some competition during pre season for this spot.  LS:  Greg Warren  EDIT: Formatting  EDIT2: A few tweaks"
steelers,34tkec,TechnoViking94,4,Mon May 4 13:52:51 2015 UTC,Is Dri Archer really the next best RB? I have not been impressed with him.
steelers,34tkec,wedgiey1,7,Mon May 4 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"He's not even really a RB, which is why I think we'll have Deangelo and Bell as the main backs, Dri Will be a utility guy, like it or not we have a 3rd round pick in this guy and it's only his second year so we'll want to see some value from the pick.  Besides, we don't really have anyone else other than Harris who like i said, might be there at the beginning of the year but we won't need to be around all year unless we suffer injuries.  Look at Dri Archer as a hybrid WR/RB speed guy, I feel like in that scenario he offers slightly better value than when people look at him as a RB."
steelers,34tkec,TechnoViking94,1 point,Mon May 4 15:04:33 2015 UTC,Can Worley him return kick off and punts then? I hate having one of our best offensive weapons doing it.
steelers,34tkec,wedgiey1,3,Mon May 4 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, completely forgot about Will. That means Holliman is probably out as Ventrone and Golden are to good on ST to be cut in his favor."

steelers,34tkec,TechnoViking94,2,Mon May 4 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, I don't think we need 9, I was kinda just following OPs template, it's hard to say who won't make it if we take 8, I think finney is a bit more versatile as he is able to play T and G but we don't really need that with Adams on the rosters. Also were paying Hubbard like a vet so ye, a good chance he's the guy if we take 8.  Then you have a free spot, i'd probably activate Webb at corner to  bring us back up to 53, always nice to have additional veteran corners."
steelers,34tkec,Pineal,1 point,Mon May 4 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"I thought Finney's knock was he had short arms (for a center no less), I've heard G as a possibility but not T. But I don't follow UDFA's too closely until camp so I could easily be wrong."

FB Will Johnson   Yep.   WR Antonio Brown, Martavis Bryant, Markus Wheaton, Sammie Coates, Darrius Heyward-Bey   No disagreement here.

At this point, we know what Geathers is and it just isn't that good.  Conrath was cut by St Louis after 3 years, which just says that he isn't stupidly good, given their excess of starting caliber DLinemen.   OLB Bud Dupree, Jarvis Jones, James Harrison, Arthur Moats, Anthony Chickillo   Zumwalt could take that last spot from Chickillo.   ILB Ryan Shazier, Lawrence Timmons, Sean Spence, Vince Williams, Terence Garvin   Zumwalt could also take that last spot from Garvin.  He's played both inside and outside LB and can be a good special teams contributor.  I think he'll take one of those spots but I'm not sure which.   S Mike Mitchell, Shamarko Thomas, Robert Golden, Ross Ventrone, Geron Holliman   Will Allen will take one of those spots.  Probably from Ventrone or Holliman but he'll definitely make the cut.

Probably the odd man out behind Will Allen and Robert Golden, but I hope he sticks around on the practice squad. I'm certainly rooting for him.  The rest of OP's roster looks good.

steelers,34tkec,DRU_leggo,3,Mon May 4 17:18:29 2015 UTC,Seems pretty accurate. I think we'll carry a 3rd QB even though we don't currently have one that is worth a roster spot. HoJo or Zumwalt may sneak in as well in place of a 7th d-lineman. I think the versatility we have on that side of the line could allow us to run with just 6.   That offensive line depth is pretty scary in my opinion. Other than Wallace and Adams (at RT) I am not comfortable with anyone on the bench seeing significant PT. Anything short of signing La'el Collins isn't going to change that in my mind so let's hope for another year of a fairly healthy o-line.
steelers,34tkec,SleestakLightning,1 point,Mon May 4 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"If they keep another LB it would likely be Terence Garvin but I do like Zumwalt so it wouldn't surprise me if he made it.   They have no depth on the offensive line. They have 1 tackle-capable backup on the roster right now. They will have to go out and pick someone up, I can't see how they avoid it."
steelers,34tkec,DRU_leggo,1 point,Mon May 4 17:52:15 2015 UTC,Wow I completly overlooked Garvin. That ILB room is as deep a position group you will find across the league.  I just took a quick look at the FA tackles and it's pretty slim pickings. Probably going to have to wait until teams start trimming rosters if we are going to find any quality.
steelers,34tkec,SleestakLightning,1 point,Mon May 4 19:33:48 2015 UTC,The Steelers should always sign players cut from other teams and stay away from signing free agents. That's the formula for getting comp picks in the draft. The Ravens and Patriots do it all the time.  I'd be more than fine with signing a veteran tackle who is cut during camp.

Dri just brings nothing else other than special teams that Bell and Willams bring, where Harris can be an ok short yardage guy.  Wheaton Vs Coates Vs Bryant will be an interesting battle to grab a second reciever role.  I imagine Coates won't be there quite yet, but none of them are attached at the role right now.  Hopefully it drives Wheaton to be a bit more competitive coming into camp.  Still going to have that silly deep wide recieving corps that the Steelers love.  All about the lines this year.  Lots of new faces on DL and ""time to prove it"" on the OL with still some questions on the Tackles.  Nowhere to hide guys this year, we'll see how it goes.  The lines will be the difference in this team being a contender or not.  When the steelers were so quick to talk about free agency after the draft, I imagine they may have been speaking to getting another Tackle.  Linebackers look very strong, but it's all on paper right now.  Strong camps from Shazier and Jones could make it one of the all time great linebacking corps.  Even with mediocre showups from both, this will still will be a highlight of this team.  My prediction is that spreading so much pressure across the line from the linebackers will give more space for Timmons to have a monster year.  Secondary will be the great question mark on this team.  With such a strong linebacking corps, teams will be throwing the ball one hell of a lot.  HUGE change this year in getting away from the cover guys or physical guys of years past and going for ball hawking.  Ball hawks really compliment the excellent pass rush, but give up a lot more in the run game, and a whole lot more in the risk of big plays.  I forsee a lot more picks this year, but a lot more 60 yard bombs and a lot of YAC. I think the clear steelers philosophy here is that more picks will let the offense on the field more and shift the balance our way, hope the equation works out because last years defensive model did not.  Antwon Blake may make it hard for Golson or Grant to get on the field a lot, he looked great at times just made some mental errors.  It will be one hell of a show when the Ravens come up in the schedule, and Flacco throws those lob balls for Golson to go play center-fielder for."

If I learned anything from the emergence of Bryant last season it's that Tomlin et al don't really care for the depth chart when it comes to WR. Last year for example we frequently ran a big package with Brown, Bryant and DHB, and a small package with Brown, Wheaton and Moore. I imagine we'll keep seeing that sort of thing this year."

Our need for a cb has been blatantly apparent for a couple of years now (in my opinion most of the time if it wasn't for Ike I trusted nobody back there), and I'm personally sick of drafting ""tackling cbs"" aka not going to go up and come down with a pick. Turnovers are crucial.   As far as Coates, I like the move. Brown is legit, but Bryant and Wheaton are both still young and unproven. Bryant killed it when he came in late last season and Wheaton was doing solid. Usually NFL wr need 3 seasons before you can tell if they're with their salt. And to your point, whoever scouts wrs for Pittsburgh finds gems regularly. Brown, Sanders, Wallace, Bryant, and Wheaton were all round 3+.

The NFL is hugely popular and its fans clamor for any news on their team, especially during the drought-like off season. Internet sites want traffic so they're happy to post articles like this, even if it lacks insight. I like having a perception of our draft from others but opinions won't matter for at least another 2-4 years.   Cases in point: Antonio Brown was perceived as nothing more than a return man when he was drafted. Limas Sweed was a safe pick based on his size, speed, and skills. Neither performed as projected in the NFL."

For one, the Steelers aren't an organization that looks to win the Super Bowl in April like some teams expect (i.e. Bills, Raiders, Bucs etc.). I bet these same idiots gave the Redskins a good draft grade when they picked up RGIII and look how that worked out.

steelers,34utwx,heyjuracko,6,Tue May 5 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"2015-2016 Season:  Ben goes down with a thought to be season ending knee injury in Week 4 against the Ravens.  Full on knee destruction, a la Tom Brady a few years back.  During the injury Marcus ""Good Burger"" Gilbert breaks his neck, paralyzing him, and simultaneous hobbling our start quarterback.  In the wake of the devastation Pittsburgh is handed a blow-out loss by the Ravens.  In the immediate aftermath of this horrific turn of events, Pittsburgh erupts into a full on riot, and people are calling for Mike Munchak's head on a pike.    Mike Munchak works some God damned fine magic and moves Ramone Foster to RT, Beachum to LG, and Mike Adams provides a patchwork job at LT.    Bruce Gradkowski put's in a valiant effort the likes of which haven't been seen since Big Ben took over for an injured Tommy ""Gunz"" Maddox many moons ago, leading the Steelers to a 9-7 season and a wildcard birth.  The Steeler's are eliminated in the AFC title game, by the New England Patriots, unable to shake the curse that has been losing to a Tom Brady led team in the playoffs.  It is a beautiful game, in which Marcus ""Wheels"" Gilbert is an honorary captain, in his straw powered wheel-chair, and calls heads for the coin toss... alas it ended up being tails.    The season ends and people questions if Ben could have come back and played, if the QB of the future should be addressed in the draft, etc...  Marcus Gilbert then goes on to popularize ""pimp my chair"" for underprivileged urban families that have a family member with a spinal cord injury.  It is a successful business that makes him richer than he could have ever gotten in the NFL.   Draft 2016:  Steelers yet again are middle/lower-middle of the pack, so glamour positions are all gone.  They await BPA to fall into their laps, even if it isn't truly a need.    The heaven's open.  The 3rd best OT is available, and the Steelers are on the clock.  My moment has finally come...  3-years of predictions and it is finally here.... I will now get all the Reddit Gold, and swim in it like Scrooge fucking McDuck.....  And with the 27th pick of the NFL Draft... The Pittsburgh Steelers select the best Strong Safety in the draft."

He is put on the season ending IR list, and at the end of the 2015-2016 season is released due to being a massive fucking let down, after getting his massive contract (a la Lamarr Woodely).    The Steelers CBs are harassed and exploited all year long.  It is a revolving door of young players, new players, and rookies at the CB position.  By seasons end Pittsburgh gives up 7-game winning touch-down drives all of which end to a fade route to the corner of the end-zone exploiting the tall receiver on small coverage CB.  These are crushing, soul sucking touchdowns.    Mike Tomlin, for the first time in his career, is utterly speechless at the podium.  Keith Butler offers to fall on his sword and resign as D-Coordinator.    Of course he is talked out of doing that.  By years end, Pittsburgh has #1 run defense, but last ranked pass defense.  Mitchel is named to a pro-bowl at SS.  Sharknado get's All-Pro nods at FS, but is a pro-bowl snub.    Total Pro-Bowlers on 2015 Steelers D: Heyward, Timmons, Shazier, and Mitchell.  Come the final game of the 2015 season due to injuries and just frustration Golson is starting.  He turns in a 1-INT and 1-Forced Fumble performance.  People notice... he earns a shot at a starting role next year.  The other side?  a shit show....  Steelers take RD 1 corner in 2016 draft."

They had needs that weren't there to be filled and just focused on finding great players who would make them better now and for the future.   They aren't like the Falcons who had multiple chances to pick O-linemen to protect their best asset (Matt Ryan) and then did jack shit. The Jets are set everywhere except QB, QB wasn't available so they went for solid guys who are complimentary. I liked so many of their guys.

steelers,34pw8q,Kofile,-2,Sun May 3 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's bullshit. I think the Ravens get an A- though because they snagged Maxx early and still addressed their needs.  I'm glad that we went after DB hard. We got a TE and DL. So we did get our shopping list checked off. That we deserve credit for, yes.  But the players we got would be great if 25% of them panned out even if they were low-risk guys. Golson and Coates are both a gamble with a nice payout, but we could be crippled there as 2nd/3rd round picks are where your team is built and the value in those rounds was just tremendous this year. There were almost 100 picks in the first 3 rounds, about 20 players had Round 1 grades and probably 50-60 of them had 2nd-round grades. Safe picks. We had needs for immediate starters. We've got to hit on these guys right away and I hope we do, but at this point I'd have rather done like the Dolphins did last year and draft lower ceiling guys who can play right away because we've got a window to win championships right now. Ben can't wait.  Not an A-. More like a B-."

The SEC isn't the NFL but it's insanely competitive. That means he's had to use a crazy amount of skill and brain power to get to that starting position.

It's going to be interesting to see how Golson and Grant are both used. Both aren't even 6'0 and I figured we would grab Eric Rowe and use him since he's a bigger body. Some people ask if Golson is really a 2nd round pick? I honestly had him going in 4th-5th round but maybe his playmaking ability is just that good. If you go watch highlights on the kid we drafted in the 3rd Sammie Coates lots of the footage at the beginning have Coates vs Golson and Coates played really good against Golson, but Golson has a nack for the ball as he was trying to get it every play."
steelers,34q1p4,TunaNoCrust412,1 point,Mon May 4 12:54:29 2015 UTC,Lack of size has to be a huge concern. But if we're lucky he will be a good no.  3 corner and able to cover slot receivers
steelers,34q1p4,funnyhoney,1 point,Sun May 3 23:50:36 2015 UTC,"In this draft, IMO, drafting Grant and Golson solidified Pittsburgh's future nickel and dime CBs at the very least. These next one/two drafts - and I am using the assumption that Cortez doesn't work out/get his shit together - will work on getting Pittsburgh's top 2 future corners.   I think it's reasonable to assume that Gay has around 2 years left (and this can be even extended another year if he slide into his natural nickel/dime role), and thus a CB1/2 replacement needs to be drafted for him in a few years.  If Allen DOES get his shit together, WOW. That would help immensley. Having a CB corps in 2017 of Allen, Senquez, Grant, Gay/CB1 or CB2 replacement (rookie), 5th CB/Rookie/Vet depth corner could work out with a competent pass rush."

steelers,34rp0s,Steinerway,4,Mon May 4 00:13:04 2015 UTC,"It's the offseason, so read. Just read about the players, coaches, the history, etc. Some good sites and blogs are in the sidebar: steelers.com with Bob Labriola, the ESPN blog with Scott Brown, SteelersDepot with Dave Bryan, Alex Kozora and Matthew Marczi, Behind the Steel Curtain, etc. There are varying opinions on which of those sites are good or bad. I personally don't like Behind the Steel Curtain, but I'm throwing them out there anyway because my point is that you should read as much as you can just to get used to the team. Then when the season starts and you can sit down and watch a game, put it together thinking ""So THAT'S what they were talking about.""  And as others have suggested, play Madden and Fantasy Football. Or keep playing Madden, as apparently you already got that covered. Just to introduce yourself to the big names, then take it from there.  Edit: Put a comma in because I forgot it the first time because my brain farted."

But ever since I finally went to a game last season (AFC North championship closer vs Bengals) my interest has practically quadrupled.

The vinegar-based slaw is MUCH less messy than the mayo slaw.  This messiness was an important consideration because these sandwiches were originally made for truck drivers, dock workers, and train crews.  Before they went 24/7, Primanti Brothers was open from (I can't remember the exact hours) about 10 PM till 11 AM - or there abouts.  They served the night workers of Pittsburgh's Strip District.  A messy sandwich would have been unpopular, indeed.  Next time you order, get a side of the slaw alone and try it by itself.  It isn't bad at all.  Perhaps you'll like it better when off the sandwich."

steelers,34qg6r,Deckz,2,Sun May 3 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"Youre absolutely correct, they're not the same. I think as long as we stay reasonably healthy his knees and back will hold up because he can just play as a rotational player."
steelers,34qg6r,Deckz,4,Mon May 4 00:27:25 2015 UTC,"He played 50+ snaps each of the last four games of the season and 491/742 (66.2%) of the team's snaps while on the team last year, including the first few weeks where he was still getting back into football shape after having bulked up a lot during ""retirement"".   Not sure why you think his ability to handle a starter's snap load will fall off a cliff after a few months. He has less wear on his body than 95% of 37 year old former starters due to his late emergence at age 29. Tim Duncan's still tearing shit up and he just turned 39. Why? Because he was rested for much of the back third of his career and has much less wear on him than other 39 year olds."
steelers,34qg6r,Zack_of_Steel,-1,Mon May 4 00:30:02 2015 UTC,"His effectiveness last year wore as the season went on, I know he takes great care of his body and didn't really play as much until 2006, but he's still 37, it's just a fact of life. And he plays the game in a punishing manner, different than playing basketball. I'm getting older and I take pretty decent care of myself, but I'm no where near as resilient as I was in my early 20s, father time comes for us all. There's no way he'd be able to start 16 games and be effective."
steelers,34qg6r,Deckz,3,Mon May 4 00:56:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but that's incorrect. His sacks came in bunches, but his total pressures/tackles/stops remained consistent via PFF's stats.   37 is WAY different than 35 and 36, where he played well as a starter?  Obviously basketball is not the same as football, lmao. The point is that with less wear an older player can perform at a high level longer, as Debo has proven.   Edit: Also, though I am not a fan of PFF's aggregate grades, his two highest games by a large margin were Week 16 and the WC game. Just food for thought."
steelers,34qg6r,Zack_of_Steel,5,Mon May 4 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"Porter's trying to piss off James Harrison.  Tuck your jewelry when Deebo is pissed off. But in all seriousness, he won't be in his '08 form but don't count him out based on his age. There are NFL players in their 20s who don't have his physical prowess. Sure he may have to work harder to maintain it, but you can be sure that Harrison will put in the work and then some."

For a team like the Steelers, who run a lot of zone coverages, size is even less of an issue (with instincts and awareness being much more important).  Both Senquez Golson and Doran Grant are great fits for the Steelers defense (much better than Alex Carter or Quinten Rollins would have been) mainly because they've got such good instincts and awareness of what's happening around them and the fact that you can trust them to come up in run support only furthers opens up the possibilities for the defense. Unless you're Richard Sherman you generally aren't going to stop a guy like Calvin Johnson or AJ Green by over powering him, you stop him with clever coverages and good defensive schemes that don't allow him to get open. Yeah you might lose some jump balls here and there but those make up a very small percentage of the catches those guys get."

steelers,34o46g,steelerguy91,3,Mon May 4 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"I would not be surprised to see the Browns get good in the next couple seasons. I think Pettine is a very competent HC, and this draft of theirs looks incredibly solid (and not just from the perspective of it being the Browns).  To me, they look like a team that is going to be ""a QB away"" like so many others, and if Manziel really can turn it around and even be just serviceable, we could have a true four-way race for the AFCN.  This both excites and terrifies me."

And even if he doesn't, a team can absolutely be competitive without an elite QB. Eagles went 10-6 splitting their games between Foles and Sanchez, while having a secondary that rivalled ours in terms of shittiness.   Again, I'm not saying that the Browns are getting anywhere near a Super Bowl. Just that they will be competitive."

Whatever helps you sleep at night."
steelers,34o46g,lexussss,-1,Sun May 3 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"And yet he was still traded away in a heartbeat. I like Foles, but the point remains that you don't need a Manning or a Brees or a Brady or a Roethlisberger to be competitive."

steelers,34nx09,The_YoungWolf,7,Sat May 2 23:35:07 2015 UTC,"I don't find it a stretch that the FO leaked ""interest"" in Williams. Clearly the Ravens found it plausible."
steelers,34nx09,rhino43grr,9,Sat May 2 23:36:50 2015 UTC,I think they were trying to move up for Eric Rowe or Jalen Collins originally.
steelers,34nx09,slivr33,3,Sat May 2 23:56:36 2015 UTC,I wanted Rowe so bad.
steelers,34nx09,thejamaicaterror,3,Sun May 3 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"If we got Collins I would've hated that pick. He really isn't that great. Watch his film against Amari Cooper, he looks at the receiver's shoulders which is the worst place to look. You always want to look at a receiver's hips because they will face the direction the receiver will end up going. The shoulders can be used to deceive a db of the direction the receiver will go which happened all night against Collins."

steelers,34nx09,InTheThroesOfWay,4,Sun May 3 23:32:01 2015 UTC,I on the other hand like to think this was a smokescreen simply because how silly the Ravens FO must feel right now if that is the case.
steelers,34nx09,NFLVideoConverterBot,17,Sun May 3 02:06:06 2015 UTC,Seems more likely that the Steelers indeed wanted to pick Maxx and that the Ravens traded up ahead of them. But whatever.
steelers,34nx09,Steinerway,4,Sat May 2 23:46:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this scenario makes more sense to me.  Either that, or they were trying to trade up for a different corner, as others have said.

steelers,34nyer,thejamaicaterror,1 point,Mon May 4 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"Problem with a guy like that is that he has nearly no value on special teams in his first year since he can't tackle. Something that backup safety's have to be able to do, see ventrone, shamarko, golden, maybe our 3 best special teamers. So unless he's starting or has immediate backup role there's no point having him waste a roster spot for us. Also, considering his good size, his pro day numbers were terrible, slow, not very explosive.  Just about all he has going for him is instinct and size, which is why he's a good prospect, but also why he dropped to the 7th round.   Interesting pick."
steelers,34nyer,steelergurl,1 point,Mon May 4 17:26:25 2015 UTC,Yeah him on special teams would definitely not be a good pick. If we put him at FS and Mitchell at SS it could work out well. Though I want to see how Shamarko will do.

steelers,34nvh1,MrGoosemahn,1 point,Sat May 2 23:33:35 2015 UTC,"For sure, he's an INT machine, but only and exactly only that. He is more interested in getting the INT than actually making a play on the ball at times. He'd rather catch it than deflect it. It's going to be Lake's biggest project, probably, to switch his mental aspects of the game. Make him more aggressive and more focused on stopping the completion. Fortunately, he's a ball-hawk, and has shown he has great hands. I think this is a guy who will take two or maybe even three years to fully develop, and that's only if we see progress."
steelers,34nvh1,hippydipster,1 point,Sun May 3 01:29:55 2015 UTC,They should get Antoine Winfield to coach him to tackle.  Antoine was just about the best non-physical tackler I've ever seen.
steelers,34nvh1,hippydipster,1 point,Mon May 4 18:23:13 2015 UTC,Sounds like he'll fit right in as a Steeler safety.
steelers,34nvh1,Folopo,7,Mon May 4 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"Atrocious tackler for a safety, and he only has one year of experience. Excellent ball hawk though."
steelers,34nvh1,ns156,7,Sat May 2 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"He's been referred to as ""The worst tackler in the draft""  Apparently he's a super ball hawk though (14 INTs junior year including two against Winston) so let's hope he learns how to tackle."
steelers,34nvh1,gavreaux,1 point,Sat May 2 22:01:16 2015 UTC,So we drafted the two FBS INT leaders from last season? Interesting.
steelers,34nvh1,TunaNoCrust412,5,Sun May 3 01:44:42 2015 UTC,"He's a shitty tackler apparently, and is hot and cold with his effort level."
steelers,34nvh1,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sat May 2 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"Not the very best tackler, also only one true year starting.. But I watched film on The CB at Louisville Charles Gaines who got beat sometimes one specific time was vs GA Chris Conley hit a double move on him and there was no safety help from Holliman. I'm sure he has some flaws along the way"
steelers,34nvh1,Kofile,12,Sat May 2 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"Great ball skills and hands, worst tackling NFL prospect i've ever seen. He doesn't wrap up, he takes bad angles, and he gives a poor effort. He's a pretty average athlete as well and has tight hips, takes plays off at times too.  In the 7th round it's a decent risk/reward pick."
steelers,34nvh1,SicaBiasThrowaway,4,Sat May 2 22:01:11 2015 UTC,With Lake coaching up DB's I have more faith in newly drafted/acquired DB's than usual. I love this pick
steelers,34nvh1,Juventus19,1 point,Sat May 2 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"my thought when we drafted him was maybe the worst tackler weve ever drafted. so while some say he slipped to the 7th, i say its a complement that he was drafted at all. he has real skills, but i think weve drafted a punter who was a better tackler  edit. im expecting an inquiry on that last part remember this?"
steelers,34nvh1,MrGoosemahn,2,Sun May 3 00:49:37 2015 UTC,"If Sepulveda's ACLs weren't made of balsa wood, he would have been an All Pro punter. Dude just couldn't stay healthy"
steelers,34nvh1,ColdNose,7,Sun May 3 13:53:49 2015 UTC,"Damn good 7th round pick. Ball hawk who doesn't tackle well, but had a whopping 14 picks last year.   This is the type of pick I love to see in the later rounds, guys who need some work but offer a lot of potential. Definitely a project player, but one with a ton of upside. Would also be a superb complement to Shamarko if he does improve his tackling."
steelers,34nvh1,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Sat May 2 21:59:35 2015 UTC,I don't remember too much from when I watched him so I don't really remember.  Is he a willing tackling who just can't?  Because all that matters to me is the willingness to tackle because form can be fixed.
steelers,34nvh1,ColdNose,2,Sat May 2 22:02:05 2015 UTC,Is he a willing tackling?   Not really. At times it seemed like he almost went out of his way to avoid having to tackle in run support and he sort of half asses it when he does try to tackle. I don't know if he hasn't been taught and as a result he doesn't bother trying or what but it is concerning.
steelers,34nvh1,MrGoosemahn,2,Sat May 2 22:05:45 2015 UTC,Eww.  Hopefully Lake can light a fire under his ass.  Guy could turn into a solid safety.
steelers,34nvh1,MichelangeBro,1 point,Sat May 2 22:06:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, he doesn't like contact. It's a combinarion of bad technique and shying away from contact. It's part technique, part mental."
steelers,34nvh1,slivr33,1 point,Sat May 2 22:03:29 2015 UTC,"Far as I'm concerned, both can be coached."

steelers,34nvh1,ColdNose,5,Sun May 3 06:27:44 2015 UTC,We took 2 offensive players WR Coates and TE James
steelers,34nvh1,rhino43grr,3,Sat May 2 22:22:32 2015 UTC,Solid value.  Thought he'd be gone by the 5th round or so.
steelers,34nvh1,TheSaltbird,3,Sat May 2 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"To address the tackling concerns, he missed all but three games in 2012 with a shoulder injury and seems to have been favoring that side when ""tackling"" (so maybe it's something that will improve as he gets further out from the injury?)."

steelers,34nvh1,DriArcher,1 point,Sat May 2 22:19:06 2015 UTC,Best DB in college.
steelers,34nvh1,ColdNose,1 point,Sat May 2 22:31:17 2015 UTC,So why did he slide so far? Poor tackling?
steelers,34nvh1,Cthemacdaddy,1 point,Sat May 2 22:38:26 2015 UTC,That's what everyone is saying yeah.  Apparently he's an awful tackler.
steelers,34nvh1,Deckz,2,Sat May 2 22:41:35 2015 UTC,Teach the man how to tackle and this will end up being a MONSTER pick!
steelers,34nvh1,Blawdfire,2,Sat May 2 21:59:50 2015 UTC,"Well he's in Pittsburgh now, he'll learn how to tackle. He's a big guy, no reason he can't hit other than technique."
steelers,34nvh1,defenstrationaccount,2,Sat May 2 22:07:36 2015 UTC,"he's in Pittsburgh now, he'll learn how to tackle.   ...have you watched this team at all in the last few years? I would say tackling is easily one of our defense's weak points. I can't count how many times I've screamed ""JUST TACKLE HIM DAMN IT"" at the TV in just this past year."
steelers,34nvh1,Kofile,1 point,Sat May 2 23:38:20 2015 UTC,Even Lawrence Timmons got in on the missed tackles every once in a while. It was infuriating.
steelers,34nvh1,losferwords,2,Mon May 4 19:04:00 2015 UTC,This is probably my favorite pick in the entire draft. Pittsburgh really drafted so fucking BALLHAWKS this weekend.
steelers,34nvh1,AssassinPanda97,2,Sat May 2 22:17:30 2015 UTC,Stick him in the nickle or dime on one side or the other of the triangle in space. Let him go for the ball.    That - and JESSIE JAMES!!!!!
steelers,34nvh1,zacgraham25,2,Sat May 2 22:51:23 2015 UTC,Teach this kid to tackle and he'll be a huge threat.
steelers,34nvh1,Thor_of_brodinhiem,2,Sun May 3 02:36:39 2015 UTC,"Just based on what accolades they flashed on screen right after the pick, he seems like a steal."
steelers,34nvh1,law_guy,4,Sat May 2 21:57:52 2015 UTC,"Ya it sounds like his main issue is his tackling. 44 tackles and 20 missed or broken tackles, which was the worst ratio in the FBS. At the same time he tied the single season interception record in the FBS.   Edit. Wow, just saw this on the steelers website. Out of 34 targets last year, he deflected 17 and intercepted 14. His tackling problem also sounds more like it's because he's just trying to get big hits, I think teaching him to wrap up would be a menial task for the steelers vs teaching him his already gifted skill set."
steelers,34nvh1,TechnoViking94,3,Sat May 2 22:00:08 2015 UTC,14 interceptions in 9 starts?  Impressive.
steelers,34nvh1,chosenxone,2,Sat May 2 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I just watched some tape on this guy, It actually made me uncomfortable watching him attempt to tackle. I'm pretty confident I would be a more physical pressence than this guy and I'm a 5""7 English computer science student."
steelers,34nvh1,TechnoViking94,1 point,Sat May 2 22:58:51 2015 UTC,"ESPN live draft site was being so dumb. It had us as taking Mario Alford and I was just dumbfounded that we would take another Wide Receiver.  This makes so much more sense and while I was hoping they'd take the shot on Ifo, I can't be mad."
steelers,34nvh1,Opuski,1 point,Sat May 2 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"Love the pick, insanely productive, only problem I see is that he holds very little special team value since he apparantly can't tackle so I find it unlikely he'll make the roster this year but who knows, we might have a steal and future star in this guy."
steelers,34nvh1,jblumz,1 point,Sat May 2 22:03:11 2015 UTC,"If i'm not horribly mistaken, Deion Sanders was also considered one of the worst DBs in tackling. Lacking in both willingness and form."
steelers,34nb79,RenderedInGooseFat,14,Sat May 2 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"As a PSU grad and a fan of people with cool names, I agree wholeheartedly,"

steelers,34nb79,defenstrationaccount,2,Sun May 3 18:33:13 2015 UTC,I meant moreso as a big agile TE. Not personality wise obviously.
steelers,34nb79,MProsserMMA,26,Mon May 4 19:05:39 2015 UTC,Well I hope we don't play a team which has a player named Robert Ford

steelers,34nb79,killien,12,Sat May 2 18:56:07 2015 UTC,That's a pretty bold statement
steelers,34nb79,MrNoUsername1,5,Sat May 2 18:57:11 2015 UTC,I don't think so. Maxx was the best prospect in a weak class.I could definitely see him not panning out.

steelers,34nb79,MrNoUsername1,1 point,Sat May 2 19:20:48 2015 UTC,he is just injured. I think he'll be good.
steelers,34nb79,SteelerBoss,1 point,Sat May 2 19:22:06 2015 UTC,thats also true since he has been 2? years out of baseball now.
steelers,34nb79,SteelerBoss,2,Sat May 2 19:24:15 2015 UTC,No they don't because it comes with implied variables we haven't seen yet.
steelers,34nb79,BonfireinRageValley,2,Sat May 2 20:37:25 2015 UTC,"Prospect has to do with the potential one has. Whether or not they live up to that potential is unknown. See Jamarcus Russel, Kurt Warner, Trent Richardson, Arian Foster, Tony Romo, Aaron Curry. Some of the best prospects don't pan out. While some scrubs turn into hall of famers."
steelers,34nb79,JDriley,1 point,Sat May 2 22:09:02 2015 UTC,"James isn't as good because he's so young. He has the physical attributes/abilities and football IQ to be a much better player in the long run than Maxx, IMO.  Also, his blocking is supposedly excellent. I could see him supplanting Spaeth before the 2015-2016 season is over."

steelers,34nb79,BonfireinRageValley,6,Sat May 2 19:32:11 2015 UTC,That qb did not look good.
steelers,34nb79,Zilch_00,4,Sat May 2 19:34:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they were playing against the eventual champs. But yeah, it'll be interesting to see how well James plays with an all-star QB throwing to him."
steelers,34nb79,klubsanwich,4,Sat May 2 19:56:12 2015 UTC,Not to mention the line play for Penn State this year was nonexistent. Poor guy could never get a play off under the constant threat of sacks. (sacks were in the 40s)   Next season should be better. Could be a big bounce back year.
steelers,34nb79,Scrantonbornboy,3,Sat May 2 18:56:22 2015 UTC,Jesse looked like a better pass-blocker than most of the lineman at times
steelers,34nb79,Flesheatinmonky,1 point,Sat May 2 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they were playing against the eventual champs.   And took them to OT, after getting fucked by the zebras.. Sorry, I'm still sore about it."
steelers,34nb79,zgh5002,2,Sat May 2 19:54:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely looks a little raw, but he looks very comfortable as a downfield blocker, and also as a checkdown receiver. I'm very happy with this pick, especially at 5th.  I wanted him from the beginning just for the name, haha!"
steelers,34nb79,MichelangeBro,11,Sat May 2 20:36:34 2015 UTC,Who needs Maxx Williams when you got Jesse James?
steelers,34nb79,Porcupine_Nights,10,Sat May 2 22:41:38 2015 UTC,"Damn it damnit shit fuck shit. I wanted the Packers to get him in the 6th so bad. He is going to be one of the best red zone targets in a few years. Solid, solid pick."
steelers,34nb79,clyde_drexler,8,Sun May 3 06:17:48 2015 UTC,"I like the pick. James is a good project TE who can be groomed for a few years before stepping in and replacing Heath Miller down the road.  Hes got awesome size, improving blocking skills, and has flashed big catch potential. He needs a decent bit of work in the route running department and he could stand to be a bit more physical with smaller defenders though. Considering Blake Bell went in the 4th this is a good value pick, he was my 4th rated TE in an admittedly weak class."
steelers,34nb79,PomfAndCircvmstance,7,Sat May 2 20:41:06 2015 UTC,I know a lot of people on here wanted him in the later rounds. Is he any good?
steelers,34nb79,TheSaltbird,12,Sat May 2 18:56:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a Penn State Student and I've seen just about every game this past season and here's my response: Is he any good? Right now, no. But he's 6'7 and 245 lbs so there's the obvious reason for the pick, especially in round 5. That might sound pessimistic but this kid oozes potential. He's not a real speedster, so in that regard he's similar to Heath. His hands are solid and he's 6'7. The general consensus that I've heard amongst commentators is that he has all of the potential but he really could've used another year in school. He's not the strongest either but time in an NFL weight room will remedy that situation. By the way, did I mention he's 6'7?  tl;dr: He's 6'7 and has potential but isn't a #1 right now."
steelers,34nb79,Volleyball45,13,Sat May 2 19:09:44 2015 UTC,He has the PSU career TD record for TEs as well. Has the potential to be a monster in the red zone. You also have to remember that the offense was dreadful last year at PSU so he didn't have a chance to shine. Probably could have stayed another year and become a 2nd or 3rd rounder but talk about an ideal situation. Playing for your hometown team behind Heath.
steelers,34nb79,tonytroz,5,Sat May 2 18:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, O'Brien also recruited the top TE in the country (Adam Brenneman) and he hasn't flourished under Franklin either. Part of the problem is that their QB had a terrible sophomore slump and their OL was garbage."
steelers,34nb79,tonytroz,3,Sat May 2 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on Hackenberg. I think the line and run game were issues, but he also just isn't as good as the hype indicated. However, in fairness to Franklin, Breneman was out all year with a knee injury, so his lack of flourishment is very explainable."
steelers,34nb79,ImTheBawsss,3,Sat May 2 19:02:07 2015 UTC,"well he hasn't played under franklin yet, since he was injured all of last year"
steelers,34nb79,samspopguy,5,Sat May 2 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"Hackenberg didn't have a sophmore slump, he had a garbage line and running game and receivers who dropped a ton of key passes. His games against BC and OSU pretty much showed that hes still the same quarterback"
steelers,34nb79,Lifesabandthenyoudie,3,Sat May 2 19:11:16 2015 UTC,"He still forced a ton of passes. I certainly wouldn't blame it entirely on him, especially the first year in a new system, but I also wouldn't give him a free pass because of that either. They were going to pull him at one point. Even with a bad OL 15 picks is way too many."
steelers,34nb79,tonytroz,1 point,Sat May 2 19:16:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Hack had a tough situation, but there were a LOT of bad throws when he wasn't under any pressure.  The o-line problems were greatly over-stated by homer fans that refuse to believe Hack could have regressed."
steelers,34nb79,ryno21,2,Sat May 2 21:04:43 2015 UTC,O'Brien > Franklin.
steelers,34nb79,HopkinsFC,2,Sat May 2 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe on offense sure, but if I had to pick between the two I pick Franklin as a college coach. He has an amazing Defensive mind on and is an amazing recruiter. I'll wait and see before I decide on the offense since the O-Line was all freshmen and one slacker who didn't care about the team (looking at you Smith), but O'Brien is hard to beat there."
steelers,34nb79,Scrantonbornboy,4,Sat May 2 19:45:53 2015 UTC,Does he block well?
steelers,34nb79,ShaquilleO_feel,7,Sat May 2 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"The best response I can give you is: meh. He is in no way a brick wall but he's also not Dri Archer. At the end of the day, it all goes back to his size and potential: he's coachable and has a huge frame so he can certainly add weight and improve in that department."
steelers,34nb79,Volleyball45,9,Sun May 3 00:48:07 2015 UTC,You had me at 6'7.
steelers,34nb79,TheSaltbird,6,Sat May 2 20:20:20 2015 UTC,"Giants fan here, Just popping over to tell you guys what an awesome steal you got. I've followed this kid through early scouting and I was dying to have him. Sadly, our GM has forgotten that TE is a thing in football.  Anyway, thus kid is a total gym monster. He's broken some records and at pre-combine activities he benched 3x the reps of the DEs! He's a fucking rolling brick wall with great hands, a good vertical leap, and more blocking ability than he's given credit for.   He got kinda poo pooed by the scouts but this kid is nowhere near as raw as they portrayed him. With just a preseason's worth of coaching I bet you this guy is going to dominate. You guys should be really excited about this pick. I'm bitterly jealous that you guys got him, but I know he did work out for you and the Eagles, so if we didn't get him I have a small comfort knowing they didn't get him either. I probably would have cried.  Anyway, enjoy this kid. He's going do great things for you.  You lucky bastards."
steelers,34nb79,DXGypsy,11,Sat May 2 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"I think this solidifies an A+ draft for the Steelers. They got their pass rusher who could have been a top 10 pick, two DBs who might be small but fit the scheme, and took fliers on insurance for Wheaton and Heath (can't have too many pass catchers in today's NFL).   Can't be unhappy with this draft. They didn't have to trade up to reach for their guys and they hit their needs. Going to be an exciting year if those defensive picks can contribute."
steelers,34nb79,tonytroz,2,Sat May 2 19:12:21 2015 UTC,This is a solid draft.
steelers,34nb79,skorponok,2,Sat May 2 19:19:29 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite parts about the draft is throwng bodies at the DL - where they need depth like no other.  I could've waited another round or two for a wideout, but if the FO can draft one position well recently it's definitely WR."
steelers,34nb79,Kofile,5,Sat May 2 19:03:38 2015 UTC,And hes from Pittsburgh... what a dream that must be!!!

steelers,34oi8a,ncoolong,3,Sun May 3 01:50:02 2015 UTC,"This is highly optimistic, but I really hope this pick works out especially. I doubt that Wheaton will be brought back for a C2, and even then, Coates can be some sort of insurance if Pittsburgh isn't able to sign Brown to a C3 or Bryant to a C2 (Paying Brown and Bryant will probably be very difficult unless Ben is gone by then). Coul you guys imagine AB in the slot with Bryant and Coates on the outside? Jesus H Christ"
steelers,34oi8a,Kofile,5,Sun May 3 08:27:50 2015 UTC,I don't want to imagine Brown in any thing other than black and gold
steelers,34oi8a,MrSweatpantsJackson,2,Sun May 3 12:19:10 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I don't want to either, but what we don't want to imagine and what may very well happen are two different things."
steelers,34oi8a,Kofile,2,Sun May 3 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"I'll take Brown anywhere on the field, but considering what they'd have with Brown as the z and Bryant as the x, I'd just put Coates in the slot. He's a big guy, he gets after it in the run game, and he's a beast in the open field. They can set up a ton with he and Brown on the same side.   If the defense has four defensive backs or a heavier nickel package, Ben can call whatever he wants at the line; the safety on the strong side has to provide bracket help, so you've got two excellent short-space athletes (Brown and Coates) going against three defensive backs. Unless you want to put a LB on Bell (ask Baltimore and Cincinnati how well that works), you're basically gonna give single coverage on Bryant.   Ben could pick that apart all game. I love Coates in the slot, and I don't quite understand why so many are down on the pick."
steelers,34oi8a,Kofile,1 point,Sun May 3 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"Regarding the single coverage on Bryant - you're so damn right. Not every receiver can be doubled - especially in a 3 wide set.

steelers,34oi8a,Kofile,1 point,Sun May 3 23:01:36 2015 UTC,"Pittsburgh has a shit ton of weapons, it's ridiculous. I could easily see a dip in production from Brown. Not because of injury or lack of effort or any other reason, but because of the sheer volume of players that could possibly receive passes this year."
steelers,34nvl8,RenderedInGooseFat,36,Sat May 2 21:57:52 2015 UTC,I feel like we addressed our needs and feel confident coming out of this.
steelers,34nvl8,Games_and_Dames,8,Sat May 2 22:00:26 2015 UTC,"I feel pretty good about how everything turned out.  Bud Dupree at 22nd?! I can't state enough how much I like this pick.  After that, we addressed our secondary with 2 CBs and a FS, something I wanted very much to see. And we got a decent TE prospect.  Colbert and the FO addressed the major needs when the players fell to them.  I have to say I was very excited about the possibility of trading up for J. Collins or Rowe in the second, but am happy with the value they got.  Also, while I'd probably have liked to see a FS or CB in the 3rd, I don't think it wise to second guess the FO when it comes to drafting wide receivers.  It tends to work out well."
steelers,34nvl8,ajk5376,20,Sat May 2 23:32:22 2015 UTC,"Bud Dupree was the best pick available at that point in the draft. He can contribute day one due to his explosiveness and cover skills and he could develop into a complete monster. He's a project, but a really good project. Senquez Golson is a top 3 CB prospect in terms of technique, ball skills, and instincts. He's a willing tackler who will come up in run support and get up in the grill of bigger receivers. The one concern with him is his size but there are plenty of recent examples of smaller CBs succeeding in the NFL and the Steelers zone cover scheme is tailor made for a guy with Golson's skill set. His floor is ""good slot CB"" and he could very well start on the outside due to his skill set and attitude. I still don't agree with the Sammie Coates pick. He lacks agility, is a poor route runner, and has a serious drop problem. I have my doubts about how he fits in the Steelers offense and he was a huge luxury pick but he does have speed and size which can be worked with. He figures to be a 4th receiver year one. Doran Grant is another CB who fits naturally in a zone defense and is a willing tackler in run support. He could have gone as early as the Steelers pick in the 3rd so getting him in the 4th was a small steal. Like Golson he has some flaws (tight hipped, less than ideal deep speed) but he has the ability to compete for a starting job day one. Jesse James is a project TE who probably won't be a major contributor his first year. However his size, blocking ability, and occasionally impressive hands make him a good value pick who could develop into a starter down the road.   6a. Another project player, Leterrius Walton has nice physical attributes and potential as a run stopping DE/NT prospect. He figures to develop into a good rotational D-lineman who can fill the Chris Hoke role as a versatile swing lineman.  6b. Anthony Chikillo is not a great fit for a 3-4. He doesn't have ideal athleticism to play OLB or the size/skill-set to be a 5 tech which makes this something of a confusing pick to be. He's not explosive or overly powerful so despite his strong hands and decent technique he isn't as good a pass rusher as he should be. He could develop into a solid rotational player but I have my doubts.  7, Gerod Holliman can't tackle, has an iffy motor, and suspect athleticism. He also has tremendous hands and ball skills. As a 7th rounder he's a good risk/reward pick and we'll know early on whether he'll become a contributor or be cut.   Overall this was a good draft for the Steelers. They filled their two biggest holes (CB and OLB) with good players, added a potential future starter at TE, and picked up some solid depth options on the D-line and Safety position. This was the kind of draft the Steelers needed to help them take that next step moving forward."
steelers,34nvl8,PomfAndCircvmstance,8,Sat May 2 22:56:13 2015 UTC,im hoping coates might have some return/other ST value too
steelers,34nvl8,SicaBiasThrowaway,10,Sun May 3 01:09:49 2015 UTC,I'd rather see Dri grow into a more reliable contributor for this role
steelers,34nvl8,jusjerm,5,Sun May 3 01:45:46 2015 UTC,"same, but i like options too. wheaton might well hold onto one spot but a coates/archer contrast might be interesting"
steelers,34nvl8,SicaBiasThrowaway,5,Sun May 3 02:06:44 2015 UTC,I don't see Coates as much of a return prospect since he's all straight line speed with little quickness. He does have potential as a gunner on special teams due to his speed and strength though.
steelers,34nvl8,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sun May 3 01:33:04 2015 UTC,yeah but weve used sort of straight line speed RBs as return guys before. then again probably had better feet still
steelers,34nvl8,SicaBiasThrowaway,3,Sun May 3 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"Can you clarify your point on Chickillo's athleticism? I recall that being specifically remarked upon as a positive trait and see that he has a solid SPARQ score that puts him in the 65th percentile of NFL players, higher than guys like Fowler and Shane Ray? Not trying to refute the point, but curious if there was a more specific trait or something that shows up on film?"
steelers,34nvl8,ajk5376,3,Sat May 2 23:41:03 2015 UTC,"When I looked into him, briefly, on film I saw a lack of burst and agility that lead me to believe he can't drop back into coverage or move around much as an OLB. He also didn't seem particularly powerful in rushing the passer. Everything about the guy just screamed 43 project DE so I totally pushed him from my mind as a potential Steelers pick."
steelers,34nvl8,PomfAndCircvmstance,16,Sun May 3 00:00:26 2015 UTC,I for one think we got an awesome haul

steelers,34nvl8,MalnutritionUSA,9,Sun May 3 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"Because, theres the other important part... not missing 40% of your tackles. I mean I hope he gets it here. But thats scary as hell."
steelers,34nvl8,lurkedlongtime,9,Sat May 2 22:07:43 2015 UTC,"He was available because he was an awful athlete, and terrible tackler.  His pro day 40 time would have been the 4th worst at the combine, so his combine 40 time likely would have been the worst, or 2nd worst among DBs. His vertical jump was 4 inches lower than anyone at the combine among DBs.  His broad would have been the second worst among all DBs at the combine.  His 20 yard shuttle time would have been the worst among all DBs at the combine.  He was basically one of the least, if not the least, athletic secondary players in this draft. He is also a terrible tackler.  It is the 7th though, and whoever we took probably wasn't making the team."
steelers,34nvl8,Deckz,4,Sat May 2 22:10:54 2015 UTC,So we took a risk on a guy with incredible instincts and not much else. If he can develop as a player and learn to tackle he'd probably still be pretty good with his nose for the ball. Here's to training camp!
steelers,34nvl8,ajk5376,5,Sat May 2 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"Without getting too excited, athleticism is not nearly as important for a deep safety as instincts and football smarts, a point that was made several times over the past two days.  As a 7th rounder, I like it. If he can learn to tackle, there might be something there."
steelers,34nvl8,MalnutritionUSA,3,Sat May 2 22:39:12 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue I have with him, is he is a poor tackler. (Something that can be coached)  However, even though his measurables are low, Safety is a position that you can get away with being slow, because if you are smart you can put yourself in position. As long as his intangibles translate well into the NFL, after a season or two of NFL level training I don't see any reason why this guy wouldn't be great"
steelers,34nvl8,Sha1hulud,3,Sat May 2 22:46:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think he'll practice squad for a bit and train up. He could be great in two years if he's still with us."

steelers,34nvl8,tonytroz,4,Sat May 2 22:13:28 2015 UTC,That's a very good point that I entirely forgot about. I'm definitely a lot happier with that than I was before.
steelers,34nvl8,Steelering,5,Sat May 2 22:16:51 2015 UTC,"Sammy can play in the slot actually. He is quick and explosive. The drops suck, but I can guarantee that a large portion of those are due to the auburn offense. There were games where auburn through the ball less than 10 times! But also because of that, he become one heck of a run blocker.   Your going to love Coats."
steelers,34nvl8,Rorbotron,1 point,Sat May 2 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not sure why people are hating this pick. Brown is obviously #1 and Bryant has a ton of potential but it really trails off after that. If Wheaton struggles they don't have much behind him for the slot. You can't survive in this league with only two good receivers and hopefully this will light a fire under Wheaton (because DHB obviously won't). The Steelers have a great track record with developing receivers exactly like Coates."
steelers,34nvl8,Swazi,1 point,Sat May 2 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"people are hating it because they're irrationally attached to the idea that the team had to go all in on D picks, particularly the secondary  it also didn't help that the Sammie Coates pick came after picking Senquez Golson in the 2nd, who many are leery of due to his size.  If the Steelers had a Polamalu or Woodson type of pick I'm sure there would be a lot less upset over the Coates pick."
steelers,34nvl8,tonytroz,1 point,Sun May 3 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"You say ""another martavis"" like its a bad thing.  I will happily take another martavis Bryant in the 3rd."
steelers,34nvl8,Swazi,5,Sun May 3 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"Bud Dupree: The more I think about it, the more I like this pick.  He essentially replaced the hole left by Worlids, and is probably going to end up better than him too.  Unsure of why he dropped so far, but he was mocked as high as 6th overall, and the lowest I've seen was 13t to the Saints, so him dropping to 22 was pretty stealish. Senquez Golson: I don't know, man.  He's a good cover corner and a ball hawk, but he can't go up against the top WRs in the division.  AJ Green would eat him up just from the size advantage.  As said elsewhere by others, he could be a very good NB/slot corner for us.  Big hands, and hopefully they aren't made of stone at the next level. Sammie Coates: I REALLY like this pick.  He's the same height, weight, ran .01 second slower 40 time than Amari Cooper.  I think the only reasons he wasn't a first or second rounder is because he tends to drop the ball (he still led Auburn in receiving yards and TDs), and Auburn really didn't throw it all that much last year.  They ran it.  A lot.  Coates is this years' Bryant IMO. Doran Grant: Great pick up.  Good physical corner who played in the physical Big Ten.  I believe he led the team in interceptions last year.  Also has good speed.  Comes up big in big games (has 2 interceptions against Wisconsin in the B1G Championship Game).  If I had to pick, I would say Grant has a better chance at playing this year than Golson. Jesse James: Good pick, has the potential to replace Heath in a couple years.  Holds the record at Penn State for TD catches by a TE (pretty sure I heard that right on TV).  Needs to work on his blocking, but he is a very good receiver.  From footage I've seen, he seems to slip and fall a lot when he has to block guys.  Hopefully that can be corrected.  I'm sure Heath will be a great mentor.  He has the frame (6'7"" 254 lbs) to be a Gronk like TE (6'6"" 265 lbs). LT Walton: Coaches saying he can play both DT and DE, but I don't see him being a very good DT at 6'5"".  He will be a DE most of the time I would think. Anthony Chikillo:  Highly rated recruit out of HS and was used out of position at Miami.  Has the tools and motor to be a good edge rusher for the Steelers.  He'll be good for depth for the time being. Gerod Hollman: Led the NCAA in interceptions last season.  People are complaining he isn't a very good tackler.  Just saying, Ed Reed typically had between 40-60 tackles a year.   And for a heads up, here are the UDFAs the Steelers have gotten so far:  OG Miles Dieffenbach-Penn State  RB Ross Scheuman-Lafayette  WR Eli Rogers-Louisville  QB Tyler Murphy-Boston College  OC BJ Finney-Kansas State"
steelers,34nvl8,237FIF,1 point,Sun May 3 03:34:57 2015 UTC,"Holds the record at Penn State for TD catches by a TE (pretty sure I heard that right on TV)   That's correct, he was a monster as a freshman and a sophomore under O'Brien (and they had 2 or 3 other great TEs that he beat out for those touches), but their offense was so bad last year that he never got a chance to shine."
steelers,34nvl8,MattHoppe1,3,Sat May 2 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"Strong draft.  One of the strongest ones I can remember of the Colbert/Tomlin era (on paper).  Still not a fan of the Golson pick, though, but we'll see if he can prove me wrong."
steelers,34nvl8,Anticipator1234,6,Sun May 3 01:22:46 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about Golson as well, but I can't find a single knock on the guy that isn't about height. At worst, he is going to be a monster nickel corner."

steelers,34nvl8,tonytroz,1 point,Sat May 2 22:55:38 2015 UTC,Golson is the only pick I don't like.
steelers,34nvl8,MattHoppe1,3,Sat May 2 23:36:45 2015 UTC,"Loved the picks. Filled positions of need and got some weapons on offense. I'm pumped. Our WRs are going to stress defenses. Sick of hearing people over analyzing everything about the picks, players, why we don't trade, etc. Basically sick of every armchair GM who runs his mouth about how they pick and scout better than the actual teams."
steelers,34nvl8,HuSSarY,2,Sat May 2 22:53:09 2015 UTC,"Even if it doesn't happen this year, I'm super excited for Bryant + Jesse James in the red zone along with Brown and Bell. Good luck stopping that.  I don't think they made a bad pick, but there's going to be a ton of pressure on those DB picks and if Dupree ends up like Jarvis Jones their pass rush might be even worse than last year."
steelers,34nvl8,Opuski,3,Sat May 2 22:39:51 2015 UTC,We signed BJ Finny btw

steelers,34nvl8,Flesheatinmonky,2,Mon May 4 04:35:53 2015 UTC,"Kind of wish we grabbed some more depth for the O-Line, but otherwise amazing draft! I'd say we definitely won as far as best names, too."
steelers,34nvl8,ColdNose,4,Sat May 2 23:33:57 2015 UTC,Leterrius Walton used to be a lineman so maybe we secretly did get some depth. kidding but i think we will find some ok depth with udfa
steelers,34nvl8,ColdNose,2,Sat May 2 22:04:45 2015 UTC,We might could convince La'el Collins.
steelers,34nvl8,thejamaicaterror,2,Sat May 2 22:13:44 2015 UTC,Can we get a mega thread for all of the Undrafted Free Agents that get signed so we don't have ten million different posts about guys who get signed?
steelers,34nvl8,Opuski,2,Sat May 2 22:22:40 2015 UTC,"I took one that had a list of all 12, and stickied it.  I am going to leave the two that were there up, because I don't expect a whole hell of a lot to be posted going forward.  I will try to delete the rest, but I'm planning on watching the Mayweather fight, and needed to step away from the computer after the draft."
steelers,34nvl8,Swazi,2,Sat May 2 23:30:16 2015 UTC,All cool.  I'm just afraid there'll end up being 3 different posts for every UDFA that signs. *thumbs up emoji
steelers,34nvl8,Anticipator1234,2,Sun May 3 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"Dupree is a potentially nearly unstoppable pick. His athleticism and burst off the line is simply a spectacle, with his only pass rushing problem being technique. If he learns technique, he'll be a sack machine. He rarely applies the one arm is longer than two principle in pass rushing and hardly ever if at all uses rush moves other than run around as fast as possible. If Porter and/or Harrison can get his technique fixed he could be just as good or even better than them."
steelers,34nvl8,Swazi,2,Sun May 3 01:06:55 2015 UTC,"Assuming that Dupree gets to start from day 1, I won't necessarily be disappointed if he ends up with just 2 sacks or so. His size should help our run defense get better. If i'm not mistaken, last season only 5 NFL defenses had more yards per rush allowed. Five. That's unheard of in Steeler Nation. Dupree, especially for a rookie OLB, has the size and strength to contain the edge. Honestly, I'm not even expecting any more than a pair of sacks from Dupree in his first year."
steelers,34nvl8,libertylad,1 point,Mon May 4 17:22:33 2015 UTC,I cant believe Anthony Harris of Virginia went undrafted.  He just got picked up by Minnesota.

steelers,34nvl8,garglemymarbles,1 point,Sat May 2 22:54:22 2015 UTC,Harris went to the Vikings.  He got picked up immediately.
steelers,34nvl8,CeeBeast,1 point,Sat May 2 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"As always, I'm going to be cautiously optimistic about our draft.  They have done a good job of evaluating and developing talent overlooked by other teams, and also had some notable misses recently (Mike Adams and potentially Jarvis Jones come to mind).  I trust the organization, and can't wait to see how these players do.  Go Steelers!"

steelers,34nvl8,nrshaffer21,11,Sat May 2 22:04:27 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, It sounds like Ifo has an injury on Marcus Lattimore scale, not an easy fix. Ifo would not have fell this far, if his knee wasnt absolutely destroyed.  We got to get over our infatuation with Ifo on here lol"
steelers,34nvl8,IdunnoLXG,2,Sat May 2 22:17:07 2015 UTC,Ifo's was probably never on the Steelers board based off his medicals alone.
steelers,34nvl8,lurkedlongtime,9,Sat May 2 22:10:12 2015 UTC,Not true at all. Our pass rush was laughable last season.
steelers,34nvl8,President_Puddles,4,Sat May 2 22:40:37 2015 UTC,if you truly believe this you don't know how our defense works.
steelers,34nvl8,Swazi,0,Sat May 2 22:14:30 2015 UTC,"Dick Lebeau's constant, ""we have 'em right where we want them! Okay, now time to drop 8"" then get scorched was horrifically frustrating to watch."
steelers,34nvl8,MichelangeBro,1 point,Sat May 2 22:17:37 2015 UTC,And how is the corner that can't walk right now going to help us at anytime soon and especially if he can't play again.  Also we haven't had great corners to be contenders before.
steelers,34nvl8,mikeduper,5,Sat May 2 22:18:52 2015 UTC,Led the nation in INT's this past year in the FBS with 14. I'll take that any day.
steelers,34nvl8,ajk5376,2,Sun May 3 01:37:38 2015 UTC,"He also led the NCAA in interceptions last year.  Last year he had 44 tackles, 1 sack, 14 picks"
steelers,34nvl8,Deckz,1 point,Sat May 2 22:35:05 2015 UTC,"I don't care if he never makes a tackle in his career, 14 picks on a 7th rounder is fucking sexy."
steelers,34nvl8,mikeduper,0,Sat May 2 22:06:15 2015 UTC,"Each player we chose seems to have at least one major issue.  My biggest concern is with the CBs we chose. This is mostly due to their size and how they will stack up against guys like AJ Green.  I know there are good players in the mix with this draft as a whole but these are all guys who will take some time to develop.  Bud Dupree in particular is a guy who needs to develop his fundamentals as a pass rusher before he will really have much of an impact.  I don't think Golson was a ""bad"" pick given who was available but I just can't picture him outside of the slot.  Strangely enough, I am a fan of Sammie Coates as he would open up a lot of options in terms of scheming with our offense but there is absolutely room for concern in terms of his tendency to drop the ball.   Martavis Bryant is a body catcher and now we have Sammy Coates who also has trouble catching the ball.  It just seems like we're setting ourselves up for disaster in that regard.  Overall it wasn't ""bad"" but I am just concerned about the glaring issues with each player."
steelers,34nvl8,yinzerjagoff,7,Sat May 2 22:42:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I feel like that is the story of this draft class.  Outside of Cooper, and Leonard Williams, I feel like every pick had a question mark.  The QBs have been debated to death, Gurley had the knee issue, Beasley doesn't have ideal size, Scherff has short arms, Kevin White is mainly potential, Fowler is not that great of an athlete, and didn't have great production etc.  There were very few guys in this draft without some big question marks."
steelers,34pbo7,IceeTeeDeelight,5,Sun May 3 08:58:48 2015 UTC,"Holliman is really going to need to get his tackling together.  A safety that can't tackle can't play special teams, and that will make it hard to make the roster."
steelers,34pbo7,Sex_E_Searcher,3,Sun May 3 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"There's two main guys you're missing: Special Teams captain Robert Golden, and Special Teams ace Ross Ventrone. There's also a bunch of camp bodies : Jordan Dangerfield (who impressed me last preseason), Ian Wild and Arden Dalby.   Towards the end of last year we carried six safeties on the roster, after beginning the season with 5. This year, Shamarko and Mitchell are locks, with Allen being extremely probable too. I feel that Ventrone's special teams ability earns him a roster spot, but perhaps the team prefers to keep Golden. I imagine Gerod Holliman will be battling it out with Isaiah Lewis and Jordan Dangerfield for the 5th or 6th safety spot."
steelers,34pbo7,IDontNeedThisIndigo,1 point,Sun May 3 09:31:10 2015 UTC,"if its 5, id imagine its the obvious 3 and the 2 ST guys. though i still think golden... nevermind. a spot could go to holliman, but i really struggle to see it. if he shows improvement i could see PS for him, but unless he has big preseason games and improvement, showing a different mindset and theyre worried about losing him... to mentally throw out a random number, 15% came to mind for his chance to make the roster, and it felt generous. yet, i still really like the pick... so go figure"
steelers,34pbo7,SicaBiasThrowaway,3,Sun May 3 12:20:48 2015 UTC,"I just watched Holliman's game against Florida State and while there were one or two plays where I think he made a pretty good tackle, it's very clear that for the most part he was avoiding contact. He looks completely nervous to touch anyone.  That being said, his coverage was pretty solid, and he had two picks in the game (nearly three, against Jameis Winston no less) and each of them were situations where he made a great play on the ball, whether it was awareness or reading Winston's eyes.  I think he shows solid promise. I still want Shark Tank to prove himself this year, and I have faith that he will show up the detractors, but Holliman looks to have some solid potential. If we can get him to stop shying away from contact, he already would shoot way up in worth. Most of the rest of the skills look to be there already."
steelers,34pbo7,MichelangeBro,1 point,Sun May 3 16:30:44 2015 UTC,I think moving Mitchell to SS and him not having a groin injury this year could work out very well. SS is a better position for him being a relatively hard hitter with somewhat lousy coverage but hopefully being 100% healthy will help him in coverage as well.
steelers,34myr7,weizhong5,31,Sat May 2 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"WOOOOO GOT A BUCKEYE!!! Dick Lebeau would be happy with this move.   Doran played great all year, really stepped up. Gonna love having him at the next level."

steelers,34myr7,humpcatting,26,Sat May 2 19:12:37 2015 UTC,Lol remember last year when we wanted martavis and got dri in the 3rd Then we got martavis in the 4th?
steelers,34myr7,curlbaumann,12,Sat May 2 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"Distinctly, yeah :D I was pleased because I really wanted Dri and the fact that we got Martavis too meant people couldn't hold that against us"

steelers,34myr7,curlbaumann,22,Sat May 2 17:15:59 2015 UTC,Like last year I'm just going to pretend the team took Coates with their 4th rounder and got Grant with their 3rd.  Grant is a really good fit for a zone defense and it should hide his weaknesses. Grant's aggressive in run support and a willing tackler which Steelers fans are going to love and while he isn't a great athlete he's smart and instinctive which allows him to win match ups against better athletes.
steelers,34myr7,PomfAndCircvmstance,8,Sat May 2 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"The difference is Dri probably was never a 3rd round talent.  Regardless of what need was more important, Sammie Coates is ABSOLUTELY a third round talent, probably should have gone in the 2nd round."
steelers,34myr7,PhantomJB93,3,Sat May 2 18:36:28 2015 UTC,I really like that he has a skill set that can translate well to safety down the line as well.
steelers,34myr7,DRU_leggo,2,Sat May 2 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"He ran a 4.43 and had average jump tests with good strength. He's a very good athlete, he ust doesn't know how to use them as effectively as he should right now."
steelers,34myr7,Lifesabandthenyoudie,18,Sat May 2 22:11:09 2015 UTC,Great pick. Can play safety too. Very versatile player.
steelers,34myr7,AssassinPanda97,6,Sat May 2 17:07:28 2015 UTC,Draft Breakdown tape.  NFL.com profile.  CBS profile.
steelers,34myr7,RenderedInGooseFat,12,Sat May 2 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"As a Buckeye myself, I love the pick. Grant was a high 4-star CB coming out of school. Took him a while to gain his footing, but really came into his own this past season. If you want to see what he can do, watch the tape against Bama and Oregon. He truly contained Cooper."
steelers,34myr7,Lippert29,6,Sat May 2 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"...well, about as well as anyone can contain Cooper anyway.  He still had 9 catches and 2 TDs."
steelers,34myr7,Brutuss,5,Sat May 2 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"This is true, but I think both TD's went against Apple, rather than Grant."
steelers,34myr7,Lippert29,4,Sat May 2 17:55:05 2015 UTC,"I think the second one was Apple, but the first one he made Grant look silly.  He did that to most people though."
steelers,34myr7,Brutuss,4,Sat May 2 17:57:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Cooper is a beast, but he didn't kill us like most thought he would. Grant played well. I think I like him better at Safety. He's fast in a straight line. Can cover fairly well. Would be an excellent replacement for Clark."
steelers,34myr7,Lippert29,5,Sat May 2 18:01:32 2015 UTC,Anyone got any highlights?
steelers,34myr7,A4thLineDuster7,1 point,Sat May 2 17:14:06 2015 UTC,"Here and here are some videos of his character.  Here is his 2014 game against Cincinnati.  Here, he is made to look silly by Cooper, but it's not too bad.  I'm a HUGE OSU fan and he's a good character kid. I had him in the 3rd and his upside is that he's so strong character and versatile that he will work his ass off and make the team in one variation or another."
steelers,34myr7,xDalexx,3,Sat May 2 22:32:48 2015 UTC,"Good pick.  Glad we addressed CB early this year.  This guy will make the team.  Edit: Grant has good speed, ran a 4.44 40, strong, physical, played in a rough B1G.  NFL projected him as a 3rd rounder so good value on this pick."
steelers,34myr7,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 18:09:12 2015 UTC,Is there still hope we can get ifo?
steelers,34myr7,biscuitz23,16,Sat May 2 17:06:36 2015 UTC,I think two CB's is our max. They'll focus on TE/DT/OLine for the rest of the draft.
steelers,34myr7,Kodyak77,3,Sat May 2 17:08:58 2015 UTC,No safety? Still feel that's a decent need.
steelers,34myr7,Lippert29,3,Sat May 2 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hoping Derron Smith or Adrian Amos if our TE of choice isn't available in the 5th."
steelers,34myr7,NotJoeyWheeler,3,Sat May 2 17:41:48 2015 UTC,Would love to have Amos. I could see another corner if we view Grant as a S. The only reason I say that is a lot of rumors around Ohio State thought that S was his best position.
steelers,34myr7,Lippert29,1 point,Sat May 2 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, that's nice to hear. Looking at our roster it feels like we don't really have any true FS, as if I remember correctly, Mitchell, Allen, and Thomas are all more natural SS's. I'm really happy with the Doran Grant pick, that's two shots for a talented corner to pan out, and it frees us up to do more in the next couple rounds.  Also, Gerod Holliman could very well be the pick if they're still looking for a FS, since they had dinner with him at his pro day, and it seems like they like to stick to players they've met with."
steelers,34myr7,NotJoeyWheeler,1 point,Sat May 2 17:54:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would be nice to get Ifo. He was a first 3 round guy before he got injured."
steelers,34myr7,Lippert29,9,Sat May 2 17:56:51 2015 UTC,Maybe. I really think we go with a TE in the 5th round. Doubt he will be available in the 6th round.
steelers,34myr7,AssassinPanda97,1 point,Sat May 2 17:08:16 2015 UTC,Ahh okay. I wouldn't mind a TE but what does the TE class look like for next year? I remember Colbert saying the TE class wasn't so great.
steelers,34myr7,biscuitz23,5,Sat May 2 17:10:24 2015 UTC,I really want Jesse James or Nick O'Leary. Both are exceptional run blockers and can catch the ball well and great YAC. Great Heath Miller replacements.   Not too sure about next years class however.
steelers,34myr7,AssassinPanda97,1 point,Sat May 2 17:14:25 2015 UTC,Really hope they snag James here in the 5th since Amos got picked at the beginning of the round.
steelers,34myr7,tonytroz,3,Sat May 2 18:50:19 2015 UTC,We got him!
steelers,34myr7,AssassinPanda97,4,Sat May 2 18:53:59 2015 UTC,Awwww yeah. So excited about this pick.  They never take PSU kids and I bet O'Brien in Houston wanted him bad.   If he doesn't bust he could end up being a freak TE.
steelers,34myr7,tonytroz,3,Sat May 2 18:56:29 2015 UTC,Learning from Heath will be great for him. Exciting future
steelers,34myr7,AssassinPanda97,3,Sat May 2 18:59:21 2015 UTC,Yeah. He's also a local kid. He has to be beyond excited.
steelers,34myr7,tonytroz,3,Sat May 2 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"I doubt we go corner 3 times in one draft, so probably not.  Only way I can maybe see it is if they consider Golson a safety."
steelers,34myr7,RenderedInGooseFat,5,Sat May 2 17:08:28 2015 UTC,True. But I think it wouldn't hurt to stack up on it now to develop them... I believe Blake is on a 1 yr deal and I think will Allen also?
steelers,34myr7,biscuitz23,1 point,Sat May 2 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"What's the deal with his knees?  The teams have way more knowledge than we do, so it's eye brow raising to say the least."
steelers,34myr7,WhatWouldJohnWayneDo,1 point,Sat May 2 17:46:26 2015 UTC,I think he could go undrafted to be honest so we may have to outbid the other interested teams
steelers,34myr7,DRU_leggo,1 point,Sat May 2 18:11:09 2015 UTC,Why is the Oregon CB falling?  I'd take a flyer on him if he's still there in the 5th.
steelers,34myr7,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 18:22:47 2015 UTC,"It's because he suffered a major knee injury during practice before the Rose Bowl, he did not get kicked of the team."
steelers,34myr7,Flaccid_Platypus,1 point,Sat May 2 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up.  I keep hearing he has first round talent, so why not take a flyer on him in the 5th?  And if not him, they may take Jesse James from Penn State."
steelers,34myr7,Swazi,1 point,Sat May 2 18:39:39 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken the slide is also due to his average sized height which is around 5'9 and teams are wary of taking a corner who won't contribute until very late in the season or until next season. He's a great cover corner though who would fit in nicely in our scheme.
steelers,34myr7,Flaccid_Platypus,1 point,Sat May 2 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Along with him and James, I wouldn't mind seeing if they pick up Michael Bennett, DT from OSU here.  A need, and one of the BPA."

steelers,34myr7,CeeBeast,1 point,Sat May 2 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"We address our secondary Grant, Golson, Holliman and people still are upset. Sure I wanted Eric Rowe too but come on guys. These kids can play too."
steelers,34myr7,TunaNoCrust412,-9,Sat May 2 22:25:37 2015 UTC,So why did we draft golston again?
steelers,34myr7,shadowslayer978,11,Sat May 2 17:47:14 2015 UTC,Because the team needs multiple CBs? And Golson was the best CB/player available at that point.
steelers,34myr7,PomfAndCircvmstance,-25,Sat May 2 17:51:47 2015 UTC,This guy will not make the team.
steelers,34myr7,spoweida355,10,Sat May 2 17:10:10 2015 UTC,Why do you think that? Most people have been pretty high on this guy?
steelers,34myr7,237FIF,-11,Sat May 2 17:11:44 2015 UTC,Watched his highlight video. the only times the receiver didn't catch the ball was because of a bad pass. The highlights also show him surrendering a lot of first downs that shouldn't have been. His redeeming quality for me is that he can hit. Another thing I noticed is that he looks very susceptible to being beat in bump and run for an easy comeback route.
steelers,34myr7,spoweida355,13,Sat May 2 17:15:09 2015 UTC,That's just like.. Your opinion man
steelers,34myr7,jakeeispro,3,Sat May 2 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"Well I'll just go ahead and say it, we aren't gonna draft a guy in the 4th round & cut him the first year lol."
steelers,34myr7,Huskyd,1 point,Sat May 2 17:17:49 2015 UTC,"Everybody was high on Shaq Richardson (5th round) , he could only make the practice squad and was cut the same year.  I don't know anything about Grant though."
steelers,34myr7,chaz_batch,3,Sat May 2 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"Soooo you're going to make a judgment based on what - a 4 minute (maybe?) highlight video?  He's a solid tackler, can play well in space, has good fluidity and can change direction easily. Not the best hands, not the best high-pointer, and he can get beat vertically a little bit sure. He's a solid corner who probably should have gone in the 3rd but we got in the 4th."

steelers,34nl6t,CeeBeast,9,Sat May 2 20:30:33 2015 UTC,Depth Signing? We should have our DL on lock for years with heyward-Mcclendon/the giant-Tuitt
steelers,34nl6t,KanyeWest_GayFish,13,Sat May 2 20:31:33 2015 UTC,Guy is true 5 technique lineman in the 3-4. Good depth to add
steelers,34nl6t,zdonabedian,5,Sat May 2 20:24:24 2015 UTC,dumb question is 5 technique DE?
steelers,34nl6t,LifeIsGoodHotS,4,Sat May 2 20:25:19 2015 UTC,Yes. In a 3-4 defense a 5-tech is the DE.
steelers,34nl6t,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sat May 2 20:31:23 2015 UTC,This can explain all techniques much better than me.  https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2011/08/12/defensive-line-techniques-the-prototypes/
steelers,34nl6t,zdonabedian,3,Sat May 2 20:34:54 2015 UTC,He'll replace Thomas after/during training camp hopefully.
steelers,34nl6t,yeshua1986,3,Sat May 2 22:09:03 2015 UTC,"Every 6th rounder is a depth signing lol. You don't draft starters at this point. If a 6th/7th rounder makes the roster, its a good pick. Anything above that is gravy"
steelers,34nl6t,meowdy,1 point,Sat May 2 20:25:53 2015 UTC,You can draft them with the intention to start.
steelers,34nl6t,KanyeWest_GayFish,3,Sat May 2 21:12:49 2015 UTC,I think its the opposite. You draft for depth and they van work to starting
steelers,34nl6t,akmalhot,1 point,Sat May 2 21:18:58 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited to see McCullers throwing people into the QB this year. I know he's still a project player to some extent, but his ceiling is ridiculous."
steelers,34nl6t,defenstrationaccount,7,Sat May 2 22:05:53 2015 UTC,I dunno but the last time we took a guy from Central Michigan in the 6th round it went well for us. But here's is scouting report http://profootballspot.com/_/nfl-draft/scouting-reports/dt/2015-nfl-draft-scouting-report-dt-leterrius-walton-r6706
steelers,34nl6t,ImBowser,10,Mon May 4 18:58:22 2015 UTC,"I would've loved Ifo, but I didn't expect 3 CB's to be taken.  I said awhile ago I thought Walton was the Dark-Horse of the draft and I'm glad we snagged him."
steelers,34nl6t,AssassinPanda97,2,Sat May 2 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know, with this next pick coming up i'd be incredibly dissapointed if they didn't go Ifo, yeah we may have enough cbs in one draft, but hes by far the best available and will give the other guys a run.  (this is void if the teams themselves know the injury is MUCH worse than we currently do at this time)"
steelers,34nl6t,JontheGreatest,8,Sat May 2 20:24:18 2015 UTC,I'm convinced his injury is much worse. No way he would've fallen this far if it was the injury we are all thinking.
steelers,34nl6t,AssassinPanda97,2,Sat May 2 20:26:12 2015 UTC,Knee injuries are scary and I think you're right about it being worse than we thought. I wouldn't be surprised to see him go undrafted at this point.
steelers,34nl6t,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Sat May 2 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"Who knows, he may be a great UDFA for us."
steelers,34nl6t,AssassinPanda97,2,Sat May 2 20:30:49 2015 UTC,But we would need to be HIS pick. He's a west coast guy from CA and obviously went to school in Oregon.
steelers,34nl6t,plusblink41,1 point,Sat May 2 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"this, these teams have to have much better information on this for him to drop this far. Idk. I'd still feel like he's worth a late 6th rounder."
steelers,34nl6t,JontheGreatest,2,Sat May 2 21:28:36 2015 UTC,I'd sign him as a UDFA at best. He could provide depth for us mid-season or in the future.
steelers,34nl6t,AssassinPanda97,3,Sat May 2 20:31:05 2015 UTC,"I feel this is where you draft someone like him. Hell we can go worst case and say he never steps on the field, it's a late 6th round pick. Who cares, a lot of them don't play anyway, but best case he can go be a solid player in our secondary"
steelers,34nl6t,JontheGreatest,1 point,Sat May 2 20:33:22 2015 UTC,They do. Media isn't privy to doctor's report.

steelers,34nl6t,RenderedInGooseFat,2,Sat May 2 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"The name is familiar but I needed to look up a bit more about him. He got better every season in college (was a 3 sport athlete in high school, came in as an O-lineman) and has flashed good hand technique and burst. Good size (6'5, 319 lbs) and he still has some room to get a little bigger.  He seems to be a bit of a project but I think he could fill the old Chris Hoke backup role (can play either DE spot as well as NT). Good depth pick in the 6th round. Buh-bye Cam Thomas you useless waste of space."
steelers,34nl6t,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Sat May 2 20:28:17 2015 UTC,I wanted Terry Williams out of ECU to be our NT project to replace McClendon.

steelers,34nl6t,Anticipator1234,2,Sat May 2 20:32:52 2015 UTC,I was wrong but he still could be UDFA but they got Holliman.
steelers,34nl6t,HopkinsFC,1 point,Sat May 2 20:49:56 2015 UTC,Another good pick. Definitely need depth there
steelers,34nl6t,skorponok,1 point,Sat May 2 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"He's no Luke Walton, but I'm happy with the pick."

I wanted the Bucs to grab him. He is a natural in the 4-3 but played 3-4 in college and definitely misused there. I wish him luck with you guys"
steelers,34noq9,Tremic,2,Sat May 2 21:09:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. Definitely sounds like a Steelers pick, good luck to you guys as well."

steelers,34noq9,plusblink41,3,Sat May 2 21:30:33 2015 UTC,Ok maybe a Steelers 2007-2010 draft pick
steelers,34noq9,Steinerway,1 point,Sat May 2 21:34:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I was at Alonso
steelers,34noq9,Tremic,5,Sat May 2 23:28:02 2015 UTC,Who?
steelers,34noq9,TheSaltbird,8,Sat May 2 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"he was a 5* DE recruit for The U, he was grossly misused there."
steelers,34noq9,bamadeo,5,Sat May 2 20:54:18 2015 UTC,"Kind of a weird pick, I thought he was purely a 4-3 DE, though I guess they're gonna use him on nickel and dime situations?"
steelers,34noq9,bamadeo,7,Sat May 2 20:58:40 2015 UTC,"Since a lot of people think he was in a poor system in college, perhaps the front office thinks they can morph him into a better 3-4 DE?"
steelers,34noq9,MichelangeBro,5,Sat May 2 20:58:02 2015 UTC,I think I've been hearing that we want him as a raw project OLB.
steelers,34noq9,TechnoViking94,1 point,Sat May 2 21:00:38 2015 UTC,You think? from where?
steelers,34noq9,MichelangeBro,1 point,Sat May 2 21:01:35 2015 UTC,Just some things I was reading on /r/NFL draft threads. We'll have to see if there's anything said officially on the matter.
steelers,34noq9,bamadeo,4,Sat May 2 21:04:17 2015 UTC,I think Labriola or Bouchette tweeted they were going to use him as OLB.
steelers,34noq9,CeeBeast,3,Sat May 2 21:07:12 2015 UTC,"yep, then let him put his hand in the dirt in subpackages. I love this pick. Might not make the 53, but would love him as a guy developing on the PS."
steelers,34noq9,breeks,2,Sat May 2 21:01:37 2015 UTC,I've seen a few reports indicating that we are thinking about mixing in a few 4-3 sets this year.
steelers,34noq9,bamadeo,2,Sat May 2 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, nickel is probably the NFLs new base formation, so 4-3/3-4 is now just another formation  You can't base your whole draft in a formation teams play 35/40% of the snaps."
steelers,34noq9,Anticipator1234,4,Sat May 2 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"Mike Mayock on the NFL Network says he's versatile and has a good initial burst.... Special teamer and sub package guy... a ""Steelers"" pick."
steelers,34noq9,Steinerway,3,Sat May 2 21:37:46 2015 UTC,"6'3"", 267, he's an OLB in our system. Plus Joey Porter is the one answering questions on him. On the outside looking in behind Jarvis, Harrison, Moats and Dupree, but hopefully that drives him into competition with Howard Jones and whatever other camp bodies show up."
steelers,34noq9,SicaBiasThrowaway,3,Sat May 2 21:05:07 2015 UTC,"we have a lemon now too, and zumwalt is in that roster battle too. more likely one maybe 2 manages a spot on either the roster or the PS."
steelers,34noq9,TheyreSeriouslyGone,4,Sat May 2 21:13:18 2015 UTC,Anthony is one of my good friends.  Want you guys to know you got the hardest working guy in this draft and should be really excited about his future.  Go Steelers!
steelers,34noq9,FateSteelTaylor,10,Sun May 3 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, I watch a shitton of college football, and I have no idea who this guy is."
steelers,34noq9,RenderedInGooseFat,6,Sat May 2 23:42:31 2015 UTC,He was a 5 star recruit coming out of high school.  Never lived up to the billing.  May not have been in the right system though.

steelers,34noq9,15blairm,3,Sat May 2 23:22:20 2015 UTC,Joey Porter just described him as another pass rusher and more depth at outside linebacker.
steelers,34noq9,RenderedInGooseFat,3,Sat May 2 22:00:12 2015 UTC,Draft breakdown.  NFL.com profile.  CBS Profile.
steelers,34noq9,rhino43grr,3,Sat May 2 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"Project OLB, had good agility drills at the Combine and a great 10-yard split."
steelers,34noq9,knightro2323,3,Sat May 2 21:00:09 2015 UTC,"Chickillo was a favorite on the all-star-game circuit. Analyst Charles Davis called Chickillo an ""absolute terror"" in the East-West Shrine Game. Chickillo, a five-star recruit out of high school, had an underwhelming senior season, finishing with three sacks and 4.5 tackles for a loss in 13 games. But it's been revealed through reports that he played through a torn meniscus, which should heal naturally. If the Steelers are comfortable that the injury explains the lack of production, a healthier player could show he's more than toughness and effort."
steelers,34noq9,sw337,5,Sat May 2 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"Steal, he was seen as a 3-4th round prospect."
steelers,34noq9,MrGoosemahn,1 point,Sun May 3 01:12:17 2015 UTC,"He was used as s 5tech in Miami, but did well during edge rusher drills at the East-West Shrine Game. We'll likely use him at OLB, and though he's not a great pass-rusher, he could certainly develop into a Clark Haggans type of player. Not a great pass-rusher, but good vs. the run.   Or he could bulk up in a redshirt rookie year and then we start grooming him at DE."
steelers,34noq9,Swazi,1 point,Sat May 2 20:56:39 2015 UTC,"Hm.  Porter just said there's probably only going to be 4 or 5 OLB spots open this fall.  So with Harrison, Jarvis, Dupree, Moates, is Chickillo going to be number 5?"
steelers,34noq9,yeshua1986,1 point,Sat May 2 21:09:45 2015 UTC,He'll most likely be competing with Howard Jones for it.

steelers,34noq9,Swazi,1 point,Sat May 2 21:59:59 2015 UTC,Browns took Ifo.  Fuck if he comes back healthy...
steelers,34noq9,AssassinPanda97,0,Sun May 3 10:55:58 2015 UTC,Well... I didn't see this coming. But from what I read he can be molded into a great DE
steelers,34noq9,Sex_E_Searcher,0,Sat May 2 22:01:52 2015 UTC,No way he's not an OLB in our defense.
steelers,34noq9,skorponok,-1,Sat May 2 20:58:42 2015 UTC,He's a perfect end in our defense. Plow forward and let the linebacker swoop in around you. This is a good selection.
steelers,34noq9,Sex_E_Searcher,2,Sat May 2 21:28:20 2015 UTC,He's way too small.  He's not even big for a 4-3 end.
steelers,34noq9,skorponok,0,Sun May 3 00:01:14 2015 UTC,Aaron Smith Jr....that's a good pick
steelers,34noq9,PomfAndCircvmstance,-2,Sun May 3 01:06:43 2015 UTC,"This is the first Steelers pick where I don't see the player making the roster. He's a tweener with an okay skillset but not a lot of upside. Looks like a camp body, practice squad project to me."
steelers,34njod,klubsanwich,6,Sat May 2 20:08:14 2015 UTC,"Might take Dupree a few weeks to get up to speed, I think Shazier, Timmons, and Jones will all start week 1."
steelers,34njod,Deckz,2,Sat May 2 21:23:03 2015 UTC,Jones still has to beat Deebo for the starting spot. That's the camp battle I'm most interested to see.
steelers,34njod,tootse,6,Sat May 2 21:51:54 2015 UTC,Harrison will only play around 25 snaps a game. So Jones has to step up.
steelers,34njod,fauxedo,3,Sat May 2 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"Jones, Durpree, Shazier, Timmons, and Harrison...  one of these things is not like the others......"

steelers,34njod,rubenalamina,8,Sat May 2 22:40:37 2015 UTC,Dupree will be given every opportunity to start. If he can't progress fast the we will see Moats and Dupree will spell him or come up in subpackages.  I hope he can start right away.
steelers,34njod,huet99,1 point,Sat May 2 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"He really doesn't have much competition in front of him, but if the other guys listed are any indication, he'll have to work one or two seasons before he earns the starting job."
steelers,34njod,Korlic,2,Sat May 2 21:56:58 2015 UTC,"The guys on the Terrible Podcast say that there is little to no chance he starts for week one. You don't usually start someone that raw with no experience opening day, but maybe as the season progresses."
steelers,34njod,rubenalamina,1 point,Mon May 4 00:36:51 2015 UTC,I think they will be hesitant to give him every opportunity to start after the slow starts of Jones and Shazier after being put into the same position.
steelers,34njod,SicaBiasThrowaway,1 point,Sat May 2 22:34:52 2015 UTC,"Jones is still slow to show up his high billing but Shazier showed flashes in his rookie season despite the injuries. I think every athlete is different and the playing time of Dupree will be determined by his readiness and knowledge of the scheme.  At the very least, it makes for an intriguing LB corps that could be among the best in the league if they all play at a high level all season."

steelers,34n3sy,steelergurl,3,Sat May 2 18:38:39 2015 UTC,What was strange about Sweed is that he had no trouble getting open. It's just that he couldn't catch the ball. Seems like he had mental challenges more than anything else.
steelers,34n3sy,IamNotYourBuddy,1 point,Sat May 2 23:40:33 2015 UTC,For sure. The dude had everything going for him except for the catching part.

steelers,34qn42,IdunnoLXG,6,Sun May 3 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"I don't want him back. He wasn't that good at all imo. He lost his cool against the Ravens and just flat out disappeared for the rest of the game. Dupree will replace him and will do a much better job. Even when Harrison stepped in when we signed him back he made an impact on the game Worlids could never done. He was solid but not that good. Why people think he was instrumental I'll never know. I was more frustrated than impressed with him, honestly."

It's going to be an exciting year for us. We have a young team for the first time in a very long time.
steelers,34qn42,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sun May 3 20:05:14 2015 UTC,"He couldn't rush the passer worth a damn and sucked against the run. Dupree figures to take his place as the team's ""coverage OLB"" replacing the one thing that he actual did well. The team is better off rolling with a guy like Zumwalt or Chickillo at OLB because at least they have upside."

steelers,34or0m,kingpatzer,4,Sun May 3 03:31:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Dupree is one of the biggest potential guys in the draft.  He didnt produce at Kentucky like his measurables, and thats okay. I can trust our coaches to get it out of him.  Duprees measurables arent that different from Clowneys."
steelers,34or0m,lurkedlongtime,3,Sun May 3 03:33:12 2015 UTC,Dupree is the biggest project of them all.  All of the potential in the world but incredibly raw.  Senquez Golson is honestly the most complete guy out of the bunch.  He's just short.
steelers,34or0m,ColdNose,2,Sun May 3 05:20:01 2015 UTC,dupree was inconsistent but showed some coverage and other things. there are a few others i could make an argument for in our class. especially a certain non tackling safety
steelers,34or0m,SicaBiasThrowaway,1 point,Sun May 3 05:53:29 2015 UTC,Dupree's coverage potential is what really makes me excited.  Really underrated aspect of our defense is the outside linebackers coverage ability.

'we dont like corners r1, we dont like conversions either' so forth, i was looking at other positions because of more teams playing 3-4 all the while wondering if one of those would give... but dupree fell and essentially keeps those streaks alive."
steelers,34or0m,SicaBiasThrowaway,2,Sun May 3 07:34:01 2015 UTC,"Not only the draft but our team in general. Cortez Allen, Antwan Blake, Wheaton, Bryant, Tuitt, Jones, Shazier, Moats, and McClendon are all players that need to show there true skill this year."

steelers,34mkvv,ThatDriftingPixel,14,Sat May 2 16:52:55 2015 UTC,What is with the love of OSU. They are like Steelers AAA at this point.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,14,Sat May 2 17:06:12 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong going with the National Champs team.
steelers,34mkvv,ThatDriftingPixel,6,Sat May 2 17:08:49 2015 UTC,Lets just put Urban Meyer on our payroll.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,8,Sat May 2 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"I think they run a multiple front defense, with guys who size wise usually fit the 3-4, and they incorporate a lot of zone concepts.  Basically they run a similar defense to us, so their guys have a leg up on most other players defensively."
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,11,Sat May 2 17:12:32 2015 UTC,Joey Bosa. Hopefully he is next.
steelers,34mkvv,lance-,2,Sat May 2 17:16:02 2015 UTC,That might mean having a top 10 pick next year. Dude is a beast.
steelers,34mkvv,RedGraniteRocks,4,Sat May 2 21:27:33 2015 UTC,"As insufferable as Buckeye fans are, I do like the importance on character and dedication Urban imparts on his players. Grant played well against Amari Cooper too."
steelers,34mkvv,TunaNoCrust412,13,Sat May 2 17:21:28 2015 UTC,Hoping we take Grant here with our pick.
steelers,34mkvv,Volleyball45,10,Sat May 2 16:59:11 2015 UTC,Come on. If Jesse James is our pick in the fifth I'll call this draft a win. lol. That or ifo..  EDIT: I have a feeling Ifo is going to be the steal of the draft. He's not going to be a #1 CB because of his height but that's the only reason. He has round 1 and #1 CB talent but not the height. I think that could put a nice chip on his shoulder though.  tl;dr: I'd be pretty happy with either Jesse James or Ifo Ekpre-Olomu
steelers,34mkvv,ThatDriftingPixel,4,Sat May 2 18:24:08 2015 UTC,There you go my dude.
steelers,34mkvv,tonytroz,3,Sat May 2 18:57:49 2015 UTC,Booyah. Can't wait till they start making Jesse James jerseys.
steelers,34mkvv,wishesgrantd,11,Sat May 2 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"I'd like a RB taken in the fourth or fifth. Jay Ajayi anyone? Jesse James and Ifo Ekpre-Olomu are other guys I'd like to see.   Edit: I knew Ajayi was falling due to injury, but I just read here that the injury could impact career longevity. Bone on bone in his knee."
steelers,34mkvv,BarryBadrinath151,3,Sat May 2 16:10:46 2015 UTC,It would be nice if we could take langford too.

steelers,34mkvv,The_YoungWolf,4,Sat May 2 15:17:20 2015 UTC,Late-round (6-7) corner wouldn't surprise me either.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,5,Sat May 2 15:19:21 2015 UTC,Ifo. I want Ifo this round.
steelers,34mkvv,EpicallyBoss,9,Sat May 2 16:15:25 2015 UTC,"Even though this is the late part of the draft, don't count out these players. Look at Antonio Brown (round 6) and Brett Keisel (round 7) for example. I'm excited to see who the Steelers grab in these last rounds!"
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,7,Sat May 2 15:02:10 2015 UTC,Kelvin Beachum too!
steelers,34mkvv,MattEven,5,Sat May 2 15:47:34 2015 UTC,Rounds 3-7 are my favorite. Steelers always find some sleepers. Game on.

steelers,34mkvv,CeeBeast,4,Sat May 2 17:41:51 2015 UTC,I'll take one Josh Shaw please.
steelers,34mkvv,lurkedlongtime,5,Sat May 2 15:45:14 2015 UTC,"Not the biggest fan of what Josh Shaw did, but like his size and athleticism"
steelers,34mkvv,ThatDriftingPixel,2,Sat May 2 16:51:47 2015 UTC,Do you think that whole mess before his senior year will appear to deter his value?
steelers,34mkvv,lurkedlongtime,3,Sat May 2 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"I mean I kinda felt like it already has hurt his value.  But I mean, yeah. I guy sprains his ankles trying to run from the cops, and tells everyone ""I sprained my ankle saving my nephew from downing""   Doesnt look too good."
steelers,34mkvv,ThatDriftingPixel,2,Sat May 2 16:57:04 2015 UTC,Whats his projected round by scouts?
steelers,34mkvv,lurkedlongtime,3,Sat May 2 17:03:53 2015 UTC,Hard to tell due to his off the field issue. But Round 3 would be my guess.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,5,Sat May 2 17:08:11 2015 UTC,For anyone interested there is a pretty much full version of ole miss vs auburn on youtube in which you can watch our third round pick lightly abuse our second round pick. However Senquez did have a pick.
steelers,34mkvv,PomfAndCircvmstance,5,Sat May 2 16:14:41 2015 UTC,"Good pick in Grant, yet another CB who is a good fit in a zone defense."

steelers,34mkvv,sw337,5,Sat May 2 20:25:38 2015 UTC,Okay there might be something to Ifo if even Chip Kelly passed on him in the 6th.
steelers,34mkvv,PomfAndCircvmstance,6,Sat May 2 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"So far the Steelers have addressed: OLB, CB(x2), WR, TE, and now D-line depth. At this point i'm thinking the team looks Safety, O-line, OLB, or RB."
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 20:44:48 2015 UTC,"At this point, they should just aim for whoever the top player is regardless of position.  Whoever we take probably won't make the team."
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 20:47:17 2015 UTC,I think Mike Hull is pretty good but on our team he wouldnt make the practice squad. He'll be decent depth for someone.

steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 20:51:39 2015 UTC,I think Anthony Harris and Drummond are probably about the same quality. Either one would be fine.

steelers,34mkvv,PomfAndCircvmstance,4,Sat May 2 16:58:48 2015 UTC,Ifo because it is more need. The prevalence of the passing game dictates that we up our secondary game. A TE would be nice but we have like 6 guys that we can through the ball to and heath can still block.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"I would go Ifo.  I think he has 1st/2nd round ability and is falling due to injury, whereas James was projected as a 4th."

steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"Agree completely.  People aren't likely to be flipping through the channels, and settling on the 6th round of the draft.  Who do you hope the Steelers target this round?"
steelers,34mkvv,tahmoose,2,Sat May 2 19:56:09 2015 UTC,Ifo. Position of need and in the 6th Im not afraid of the knee injury. Look at Spence. We can clearly rehab a knee.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 20:03:42 2015 UTC,"If the team goes DB i'd like Derron Smith or Kurtis Drummond, if they go D-line depth Rakeem Nunez-Roches or Corey Crawford, and if they go OLB Zack Hodges. It's the 6th round though so i'm not going to freak out over who the pick is, most of these guys are future practice squaders/camp fodder anyways. Drummond is probably my favorite prospect left."

steelers,34mkvv,Flexidry_,7,Sat May 2 15:31:13 2015 UTC,"The problem a lot of people have with him is he's small with a really short vertical.  Still a baller though.  They'll double up at corner at least.  Look for Doran Grant- Ohio State, Darryl Roberts- Marshall, Bryce Callahan- Rice, and Dexter McDonald- Kansas as well as Max Valles, the outside linebacker out of Virginia.  All guys who were brought in for a pre-draft visit."
steelers,34mkvv,BarryBadrinath151,7,Sat May 2 15:53:33 2015 UTC,Im good with his size. Want someone who can cover in a zone which he is excellent at. I also want Ifo because he is good too and I dont care about his size either. I want options.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,7,Sat May 2 16:19:28 2015 UTC,That's two CB's selected in consecutive rounds. Can everyone stop bitching now?!  Love this pick.  Edit: 2nd and 4th are not consecutive. I know.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,5,Sat May 2 17:06:58 2015 UTC,2nd and 4th are not consecutive.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,6,Sat May 2 17:07:35 2015 UTC,we took a WR in round 3
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 17:07:56 2015 UTC,Lets do this!
steelers,34mkvv,Verksus67,3,Sat May 2 16:05:49 2015 UTC,I hope the Steelers pick up Ifo.
steelers,34mkvv,ThatDriftingPixel,3,Sat May 2 16:10:05 2015 UTC,Jets get Petty..nice.
steelers,34mkvv,Verksus67,3,Sat May 2 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Dammit, I liked langford."
steelers,34mkvv,DavoinShower-handle,3,Sat May 2 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"2 1st round running backs, and a 4th round fullback.  What the hell is going on here."
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 16:32:05 2015 UTC,The titan took a full back in the 4th. Bit early for that isnt it.
steelers,34mkvv,DRU_leggo,3,Sat May 2 16:33:18 2015 UTC,Of course the Patriots take the highly valued guard who slipped due to injury concerns.
steelers,34mkvv,BarryBadrinath151,3,Sat May 2 16:40:01 2015 UTC,Kouandjio and Jackson are great value picks. I expect that from the Pats but nicely played Redskins.
steelers,34mkvv,A4thLineDuster7,3,Sat May 2 16:45:33 2015 UTC,Do you guys think La'el Collins will go today? Will anyone risk it?
steelers,34mkvv,BarryBadrinath151,2,Sat May 2 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"They announced earlier that he can't re-enter the draft next year, so if he gives up, and says he will play, there is a chance in the 7th, but I wouldn't do it before then."
steelers,34mkvv,slicehix,3,Sat May 2 16:55:51 2015 UTC,I guess we take a punter from Hofstra. Not even the starter.
steelers,34mkvv,NotJoeyWheeler,3,Sat May 2 17:02:35 2015 UTC,God fucking dammit Bengals
steelers,34mkvv,slicehix,3,Sat May 2 17:04:06 2015 UTC,CLASSIC BENGALS - oh well Ifo and James
steelers,34mkvv,slicehix,3,Sat May 2 17:04:28 2015 UTC,Ravens are going to select all my hopes and dreams.
steelers,34mkvv,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 17:07:48 2015 UTC,I'd like to see us take o'leary
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 17:15:39 2015 UTC,Adrian Amos is gone. Pulling for Derron Smith and Jesse James for the next two picks.
steelers,34mkvv,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 17:58:12 2015 UTC,Anyone interested in doubling up on Buckeyes and getting Mike Bennet in the 5th? Not a prototypical DE in our system but would be a good rotational body and third down pass rusher. Really high motor when rushing the QB. I think injury concerns are causing him to fall.
steelers,34mkvv,NotJoeyWheeler,4,Sat May 2 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind him.  6'2"" 293 DE sounds good to me.  would provide depth at the very least, and could make Cam Thomas expendable this year at best."
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe Im trying to convince myself here but I think A CB here in the 5th wouldn't be a bad idea. I mean, If Cortez doesn't shape up this next season it would be nice to have somebody already being coached up to step in."
steelers,34mkvv,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Sat May 2 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"I'd like either Ifo, a tight end, or even Michael Bennett here."
steelers,34mkvv,NotJoeyWheeler,2,Sat May 2 18:48:04 2015 UTC,Ifo is the CB I had in mind but Jesse James would be a great pick IMO
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 18:49:37 2015 UTC,My guess is Gerod Holliman.
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"I'm with you there, unless they picked up Grant with the intent to play him at safety."
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 18:50:12 2015 UTC,I considered that possibility. I'm certainly not opposed to it.
steelers,34mkvv,Flexidry_,2,Sat May 2 18:55:29 2015 UTC,I don't want Holliman.  Doesn't seem athletic enough to me to play in the pros.
steelers,34mkvv,wishesgrantd,2,Sat May 2 18:52:39 2015 UTC,Yeah. I didn't necessarily want him. I'd rather they explore converting Grant to safety. But I was just looking at the list of visits and figured he might be next and that they'd wait another round to try to grab James. I'm happy that they went ahead and got James. They just don't seem interested in Ifo at all.
steelers,34mkvv,DRU_leggo,3,Sat May 2 18:54:53 2015 UTC,"Jesse James: projected 5th or 6th rounder, so we got him at the right spot.  Combine top performer among TEs in bench press, vertical jump, broad jump, and 60 yard shuttle.  Ran a 4.83 40, which doesn't seem that bad for a 261 pound TE."
steelers,34mkvv,GLAM_,2,Sat May 2 18:57:01 2015 UTC,He got his 40 time down into the 4.6's at his Pro Day.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 19:08:10 2015 UTC,Whoever gets Mike Bennett is going to get possibly the best value pick of the draft at this point.  He should've gone in the 3rd round honestly.
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"Early hopes for our 2 6th rounders?  I got Gerod Holliman, Derron Smith, Kurtis Drummond, Ifo (at this point I don't care about injury concerns, it's a 6th rounder), Michael Bennett, Max Valles, Tyrus Thomas or any other highly rated O-linemen  EDIT: Valles and Bennett gone early."
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 19:13:52 2015 UTC,"If we can get three of Derron Smith, Valles, Bennett, and Ifo, I'd be ecstatic."
steelers,34mkvv,elias2718,2,Sat May 2 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty shocked that Derron Smith, Kurtis Drummond, and Michael Bennett are still on the board.  Bennett seems like more a 4-3 UT than a 3-4 DE but in the 6th you almost wanna gamble on him because of how good his game tape is. I like both Drummond and Smith as Safety depth/special teams players and figured both would be gone by the 4th/5th round so there's nice value there. Valles would also be a solid pick as a project LBer/special teams stud.  This kinda feels like last year where Daniel McCullers fell to the 6th and the Steelers got a good value pick on a hyped prospect."
steelers,34mkvv,tahmoose,3,Sat May 2 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"They had Mort on ESPN talking about why Bennett is falling, and he said he got texts from two teams saying they felt he was too small.  He measured in at the combine at 6'2"" 293 pounds.  I don't know how that could be too small for any position on the defense outside of nose tackle."
steelers,34mkvv,elias2718,2,Sat May 2 19:20:09 2015 UTC,"Weird. Cam Heyward is 6'5"" 288 so it doesn't seem too big of a difference."
steelers,34mkvv,NFLVideoConverterBot,2,Sat May 2 19:22:43 2015 UTC,Its his height and weight in comparison to each other I believe.  You'd either want him taller at 293 or heavier at 6'2.
steelers,34mkvv,tahmoose,2,Sat May 2 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"He is 3 inches shorter, and 1 pound lighter, than Heyward was at the combine, with arms that are 5/8 of an inch shorter, and hands that are 1/8 of an inch larger.  Heyward was a first rounder with those measurables.  I just don't see him as being so small that he is untouchable."
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 19:31:43 2015 UTC,"That's just my best guess.  My thinking is that for a d- end you want taller, lighter (relatively speaking) guys while tackles are shorter and much heavier.  Of course, I'm a political science major, what do I know?"
steelers,34mkvv,DomAsian,3,Sat May 2 19:36:53 2015 UTC,There goes Bennett.  Potentially great value pick by the Jags.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 19:42:48 2015 UTC,"I went for a bike ride. I see we got Jesse James. Nice pick. Wow, Ifo is still on the board. Take him dammit."
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 19:54:09 2015 UTC,Leterrius Walton DT of Central Michigan
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 20:21:18 2015 UTC,He's a 3-4 DE run stuffer than can give guys breathers. Nice depth pick.
steelers,34mkvv,BarryBadrinath151,3,Sat May 2 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"I don't see a need for safety on this team but looking at who's available(Drummond, Harris, Pruitt), I think we grab one with our second 6th purely on BPA"
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"Ravens are getting Flacco some weapons this year. It's weird to see this, they usually draft defense heavy."
steelers,34mkvv,BarryBadrinath151,3,Sat May 2 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"Since Ifo apparently has the worst knee injury ever, lets go Drummond."
steelers,34mkvv,BarryBadrinath151,3,Sat May 2 20:48:03 2015 UTC,"Project pass rusher, not a DE before anyone freaks out"
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,3,Sat May 2 20:54:42 2015 UTC,Ifo is gonna end up in Philly. Chip gets another duck and Ifo's knee gets all better with the magic smoothies.
steelers,34mkvv,ThatDriftingPixel,3,Sat May 2 21:06:38 2015 UTC,I love John Mitchell so much. If you don't watch much of interviews and stuff the one thing I would recommend is his talk on Walton (but it's mostly some other really interesting stuff).
steelers,34mkvv,DavoinShower-handle,2,Sat May 2 21:21:14 2015 UTC,Got a link?

steelers,34mkvv,ThatDriftingPixel,2,Sat May 2 21:45:50 2015 UTC,Thank you very much.
steelers,34mkvv,NotJoeyWheeler,2,Sat May 2 21:38:44 2015 UTC,"I like the part were he describes Heyward as ""coming along""."
steelers,34mkvv,Duke_Swillbottom,3,Sat May 2 21:45:17 2015 UTC,"Anthony Harris for sure, unless there's a genuine reason as to why he's fallen so far. Ifos knee must be in awful condition if he's still there at this point."
steelers,34mkvv,ThatDriftingPixel,2,Sat May 2 21:43:35 2015 UTC,It is reportedly a ziplock bag full of hamsters.
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 21:46:38 2015 UTC,Ifo makes it past Philly. His knee must just be garbage at this point.
steelers,34mkvv,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Sat May 2 21:51:13 2015 UTC,Gerod Holliman.
steelers,34mkvv,jblumz,2,Sat May 2 21:55:53 2015 UTC,Browns doing some work in this draft. Must be nice to suck and have a million draft picks....
steelers,34mkvv,wishesgrantd,2,Sat May 2 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"Rodney Gunter is the first player selected from Delaware St. since 2001, the second since '93, and the 10th since '70."
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 16:56:35 2015 UTC,Deleware state must have been decent between 1970 ad 1993.
steelers,34mkvv,MrNoUsername1,2,Sat May 2 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"We are up with Ifo, and James on the board.  Everyone is either going to be pretty happy, or pretty pissed."
steelers,34mkvv,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Sat May 2 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"Grant, Im ok with this."
steelers,34mkvv,MrNoUsername1,2,Sat May 2 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"Wasn't expecting him, but I think most will be happy with that.  I like the pick."
steelers,34mkvv,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Sat May 2 17:06:09 2015 UTC,I would have liked Ifo there but I guess they think hes going to keep dropping.
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,2,Sat May 2 17:08:05 2015 UTC,Please be Ifo. Please be Ifo.
steelers,34mkvv,AssassinPanda97,3,Sat May 2 17:05:08 2015 UTC,Maybe he can be in the fifth.
steelers,34mkvv,DRU_leggo,2,Sat May 2 17:06:44 2015 UTC,Thoughts on Brett Hundley?
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,2,Sat May 2 17:29:27 2015 UTC,Safety anyone?
steelers,34mkvv,knightro2323,2,Sat May 2 17:53:51 2015 UTC,"After everyone here and even pre April 30th talk saying how fans here want Ifo, I decided to look up some highlights of him and oh my sweet Jesus this kid looks so awesome. He's an aggressive, smart, crazy athletic player that I would LOVE to have on the Steelers. I'm pulling that we take him (if hopefully he's still there by the 5th round), I don't even care if we take a third corner in the draft."
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,2,Sat May 2 18:13:02 2015 UTC,Why do you guys think Ifo is falling so much?
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,4,Sat May 2 18:56:44 2015 UTC,"His injury is honestly quite bad, so even beyond recovery, there's concerns as to whether he'll be able to play the same way again. I'm cool with Jesse James over him definitely, but if he's there again in the 6th, I'd really hope they would take him, especially since we have a comp pick there anyway."
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"For sure, its all projects at this point anyway.  Take Ifo if he's there.  See what's left at guard and maybe pick up a UFA rb or two to see what shakes out in camp."
steelers,34mkvv,knightro2323,2,Sat May 2 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"I remember when we got Bell in 2013 that there was that one RB - forgot his name - with a history of leg issues that the Niners snagged up in the 2nd or 3rd and he ended up retiring, never truly healing from an injury that plagued him all that rookie season."
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 19:17:32 2015 UTC,Marcus Lattimore.  Oh what could have been....
steelers,34mkvv,sw337,2,Sat May 2 19:29:07 2015 UTC,The injury is really bad and if he ends up losing his speed/quickness then there's no way he'll be able to match up against NFL pass catchers due to his size limitations. It's unfortunate but it seems most teams feel he's a serious risk of busting.
steelers,34mkvv,knightro2323,2,Sat May 2 19:25:23 2015 UTC,OMFG I know we drafted 2 CB's already but Ifo is still there! He's a steal!
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"I really want Ifo too, but the front offices have to know something that we don't. If every single team has passed up on him five times, something must be wrong. He could've had bad medicals, worse than expected."
steelers,34mkvv,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 19:03:28 2015 UTC,His knee injury is in pretty bad shape.  I thought he'd be a steal in the 4th but if everyone is skipping him in the 5th then its pretty telling how bad it really is.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"Just a question, what ever happened to Nick O'Leary? Seems like nobody has said a word about him."
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 19:30:32 2015 UTC,"He's slow, not very quick, and he has very short arms which pretty much restricts him to being an H-back in the NFL. Guys like that generally don't get drafted early, if at all."
steelers,34mkvv,Anticipator1234,2,Sat May 2 19:34:50 2015 UTC,Okay just curious. Everyone seemed to be pretty high on him about 3 months ago.
steelers,34mkvv,15blairm,2,Sat May 2 19:50:02 2015 UTC,"He's a high character, high motor guy from a major program. Fans tend to latch on to guys like that and hype them way more than they actually merit being hyped."
steelers,34mkvv,Anticipator1234,2,Sat May 2 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"And just like that, Valles and Bennett go back-to-back ):"
steelers,34mkvv,fire8up,2,Sat May 2 19:42:32 2015 UTC,"If IFO is still available by your first 6th round pick, snag him. In our comp pick, I say we snag Zack Wagenmann. He will be the next Brett Keisel"
steelers,34mkvv,Swazi,2,Sat May 2 19:56:10 2015 UTC,Lynden Trail in the 6th anyone?
steelers,34mkvv,DRU_leggo,2,Sat May 2 20:03:12 2015 UTC,Damn.  Derron Smith just got taken. ):
steelers,34mkvv,wishesgrantd,2,Sat May 2 20:16:05 2015 UTC,on the clock
steelers,34mkvv,Anticipator1234,2,Sat May 2 20:18:10 2015 UTC,Don't know much about Walton.  Text alert I got said DE so maybe they see a guy who can provide some depth.
steelers,34mkvv,BEGA500,2,Sat May 2 20:25:51 2015 UTC,"He will be a 3-4 DE, or possibly nose.  Most things I have read say DE.  Massive man who has only been playing d line for 4-5 years."
steelers,34mkvv,DomAsian,2,Sat May 2 20:31:43 2015 UTC,Total project but that fine because we have our D Line pretty much in place.
steelers,34mp12,mdaquan,22,Sat May 2 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"Everyone forgets that ike went through the same thing cortez did. His problem was mental, not anything skill related. I think our secondary will be fine."
steelers,34mp12,DriArcher,13,Sat May 2 15:49:57 2015 UTC,also brice mccain was terrible the season before he came here.
steelers,34mp12,SicaBiasThrowaway,3,Sat May 2 17:32:26 2015 UTC,Ahhhhhhhhhhh man. Brice McCain is in Miami now. I forgot about that.
steelers,34mp12,JonVig,2,Sat May 2 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"Damn, now I'm sad"
steelers,34mp12,FightingGravityAgain,-12,Sat May 2 22:13:18 2015 UTC,The difference is Ike played well before his slump. Cortez has never played well.
steelers,34mp12,maltrab,13,Sat May 2 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"Nah, dog. The reason Cortez received a pretty sizable contract because he was on his way to becoming a starting corner for the Pittsburgh Steelers."
steelers,34mp12,ShaquilleO_feel,1 point,Sat May 2 17:40:27 2015 UTC,Agree to disagree then. I saw nothing before the contract that told me that he could be a starting caliber corner in the NFL.
steelers,34mp12,maltrab,3,Sat May 2 17:57:15 2015 UTC,Really? He had a bunch of pretty athletic  interceptions toward the end of his rookie season.
steelers,34mp12,ctornync,4,Sat May 2 18:13:41 2015 UTC,Well the front office did. So....
steelers,34mp12,ShaquilleO_feel,1 point,Sat May 2 18:20:58 2015 UTC,I'm well aware
steelers,34mp12,maltrab,1 point,Sat May 2 18:30:55 2015 UTC,I think Cortez has shown flashes of starting corner potential before last year and last season as well for that matter. Definitely see what you're saying though. Ike was a much more established pro prior to his epic slump season.
steelers,34mp12,DRU_leggo,14,Sat May 2 18:06:57 2015 UTC,Someone talk me down off this ledge.   Draft isnt even over yet and we are still in Free Agency... come on man...
steelers,34mp12,Korlic,5,Sat May 2 15:48:19 2015 UTC,This is the sub in a nutshell...overreactions.
steelers,34mp12,MrSweatpantsJackson,4,Sat May 2 18:36:10 2015 UTC,Wow. Now we're overreacting?! Are your serious?!
steelers,34mp12,JonVig,2,Sat May 2 20:07:36 2015 UTC,Free agency started a long time ago. Anyone worth having is long gone.
steelers,34mp12,jimbo831,1 point,Sat May 2 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"We certianly arent going to sign a super star, but thats because that is not what the Steelers do. If they arent happy with what they got out of the draft they will sign a depth player that has lingered."
steelers,34mp12,Korlic,-2,Sat May 2 20:25:54 2015 UTC,We need a starting CB. Name one that is still a free agent.
steelers,34mp12,jimbo831,2,Sat May 2 20:30:45 2015 UTC,The Steelers clearly believe they have one in Allen.
steelers,34mp12,Korlic,-2,Sat May 2 20:48:28 2015 UTC,"I guess they must not have watched last season. He was the 5th best CB on a team with no good CBs. By the way, you need 2-3 starting CBs. The Steelers currently have 0. Please answer my question, what free agent would you sign?"
steelers,34mp12,jimbo831,1 point,Sat May 2 21:23:09 2015 UTC,"Yea, I guess the Steelers front office arent professionals compared to us sitting here on our couches and chairs who clearly know everything about football scouting..."
steelers,34mp12,Korlic,-7,Sat May 2 21:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, how well have those professionals done since 2009?"
steelers,34mp12,jimbo831,2,Sat May 2 21:37:56 2015 UTC,"Good enough to keep us at at least .500 every year and make the playoffs last year with an equally poor defense.  More specificly what have they done: They have coaxed and plugged holes into an aging defense to keep the team afloat as they rebuilt the offense into one of the best in the leauge. Its funny, only a couple seasons ago the cries that our offensive line were going to be our downfall, or that we will never win without a running game. Is it that hard to understand that:   No team is ever going to be absolutely perfect at every position It takes time to rebuild positions of weakness Just because a player is a FA doesnt mean they would even sign here if given an offer   I will happily take management that has kept an aging team afloat while rebuilding than one that simply tanks, because quite frankly, only 1 team wins it all every year. If its not your team would you rather look back and remember games you won, and see your team compete or would you rather remember every humiliating loss as you try and accumulate a better draft spot to solve the teams issues with a quick fix?"
steelers,34mp12,Korlic,-5,Sat May 2 21:39:30 2015 UTC,I'm glad that you're happy with being mediocre. I will keep hoping for a good team.
steelers,34mp12,jimbo831,1 point,Sat May 2 21:46:00 2015 UTC,A veteran CB would be nice as a FA.
steelers,34mp12,Ultenth,3,Sat May 2 17:10:08 2015 UTC,Like who?  It's a pretty barren wasteland right now.
steelers,34mp12,Steinerway,8,Sat May 2 21:46:43 2015 UTC,"As is always the case whenever anyone says ""talk me off this ledge because of (insert defensive position here)"": the defense isn't the only part of the team. There's also an offense too, and it's one of if not the best in the league. This will still be a winning team.  But as it pertains to cornerbacks specifically, ideally Dupree will help the pass rush and make QBs force bad throws, making the CB's jobs easier.  People are stuck in 2009 and 2010 with Gay. I'm not sure why since that was half a decade ago, but he's been good every year in Pittsburgh since then. We've seen players bounce back from worse than where Cortez Allen was last year. It was clicking for Antwon Blake late in the year. And Senquez is the opposite of Dupree. Dupree has all the measurables, not the most mind-blowing film. Golson is short, but the kid could play.  Obviously this is fairly optimistic of me (except for the part about the offense. That's simply realistic). But it all could happen, and I imagine that's what you're asking for in this thread."
steelers,34mp12,Steinerway,1 point,Sat May 2 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"My whole life I've always been so pumped about the D, not the offense. Trust me I know - there is a lot to be excited about on the offensive side of the ball. I think we all just want so badly to have that fearsome defensive back. A win is a win, but winning shootouts with 800+ yds if offense and giving up 37 points is just going to take some getting used to."
steelers,34mp12,WhatWouldJohnWayneDo,1 point,Sat May 2 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I guess I'm just about the winning. Don't care how it's done, just do it.

steelers,34mp12,Steinerway,1 point,Sat May 2 21:09:03 2015 UTC,"Dupree won't get noticeable playing time until next season.  I mean, I hope I'm wrong but I don't think I will be."
steelers,34mp12,maninorbit,2,Sat May 2 17:43:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's kind of a hyperbole that ""young players don't play because they're young."" Players don't play because they don't know the playbook yet and/or because they have studs ahead of them on the depth chart. Goes without saying that there aren't many studs ahead of Dupree, that's why he was a first round pick. If Jarvis was in a heavy rotation and starting by week 2 of his rookie year, Dupree will be as well.  For another thing, it's a new playbook and Butler has said quite a few times it's a more simple defense. I expect young guys to play earlier than they did under LeBeau."

steelers,34mp12,ColdNose,6,Sat May 2 23:35:05 2015 UTC,It's not all that bad. Trae Waynes is what 5'10 or 5'11 this kid isn't small he's just short just like Tonkin says about Blake. He's got an eye for the ball and and can make plays just what we need..

steelers,34mp12,DRU_leggo,2,Sat May 2 20:18:32 2015 UTC,All depends on Allen. If he gets his groove back we might be better off than we think. This is his make or break moment.. the team needs him so there's a possibility he answers the call.
steelers,34mp12,chaz_batch,2,Sat May 2 15:50:52 2015 UTC,I think they are putting a lot of faith in Cortez rebounding. And honestly I can see why. He was never really out of position last year. He just didn't finish plays and I think he really lost his confidence because of it. He is completely capable of being our nuber one corner if he can just fix his game from the neck up
steelers,34mp12,ColdNose,1 point,Sat May 2 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"This.. He was almost always in good position, it was frustrating watching him never get his hands up or tracking the ball until it was too late.  Hopefully they can drill that into him."
steelers,34mp12,gimpisgawd,2,Sat May 2 20:31:04 2015 UTC,Depends on Cortez Allen. He can be a solid #2 if he stops psyching himself out. They really do need a #1 though.
steelers,34mp12,dmremic,2,Sat May 2 15:40:50 2015 UTC,I think if you're in a position that with one injury Cortez Allen becomes a starter CB is a need.
steelers,34mp12,jimbo831,1 point,Sat May 2 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"Yes.  There is alarmist mentality amongst this sub when it comes to our DB situation.  Everywhere else on the team we were getting younger and faster...  Save for DBs for the past 3years.  I doubt anyone we drafted will even be a routine part of our nickel defense.  They will see PT in quarter / dime packages, and of course on special teams as well."
steelers,34mp12,dmremic,3,Sat May 2 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"There is alarmist mentality amongst this sub when it comes to our DB situation.   You say this as if it's unfounded. We had one of the worst passing defenses in the NFL last season and lost two of our ""best"" corners in Taylor and McCain."
steelers,34mp12,Lippert29,1 point,Sat May 2 19:47:38 2015 UTC,Concern is perfectly acceptable.   I'm just pointing out that several interactions I've had in here have been with folks that think the sky is falling every time our CBs give up a TD.
steelers,34mp12,HopkinsFC,1 point,Sat May 2 19:55:33 2015 UTC,"If you want talked off the ledge, our corners have been shit for a long while. Nothing new."
steelers,34mp12,dmremic,1 point,Sat May 2 17:33:25 2015 UTC,I definitely think the FO thinks more of Cortez than the general fanbase. You don't give up on a guy you saw as good enough to give a long term contract to after one bad season. There might also be things the general fanbase is privy to that the organization is.
steelers,34mp12,KylerTopFlight,1 point,Sat May 2 17:34:06 2015 UTC,Why is there so much hate for Cortez Allen?    He had a down year.  He was benched.  In limited PT he was underwhelming....   Is it because he immediately laid a turd on everyone's expectations after a contract?  I feel the same hate for Cortez can be directed at Good Burger Gilbert.

steelers,34kwnv,MichelangeBro,15,Sat May 2 13:10:49 2015 UTC,Was he excited?
steelers,34kwnv,tstscavo,34,Sat May 2 01:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah. He got the call a few picks before it was announced and broke into tears, hugged his parents, wife/gf, and hasnt let go of his baby since. Entire restaurant flipped out when they announced it, good solid 5 minutes of thunderous applause.  If I can, when he slows down im gonna try to get a picture with him thats better than the candid shot I took.   As an Eagles fan, im happy for you guys. Seems like a good guy and theyve been playing his college highlights on our projector and the dude seems like a huge playmaker."
steelers,34kwnv,mdaquan,8,Sat May 2 01:43:39 2015 UTC,Got the call a few picks before it was announced? If that's true the steelers were never taking Maxx? Could that be true?!
steelers,34kwnv,MichelangeBro,14,Sat May 2 02:45:29 2015 UTC,The ticker above the stage showed that our pick was actually locked in several picks early. The announcements were just falling behind because of all the damn commercials.
steelers,34kwnv,mrbuttsavage,9,Sat May 2 03:15:17 2015 UTC,If that's true the steelers were never taking Maxx? Could that be true?!   I believe it. Steelers definitely don't need a TE that can't block.
steelers,34kwnv,smacksaw,3,Sat May 2 03:17:29 2015 UTC,"No, I think we knew he was gone and had to go with next available.  While I'd like to believe we were never picking him, we probably were."

steelers,34kwnv,Rorbotron,6,Sat May 2 03:31:04 2015 UTC,"A 120"" broad jump and a 33.5"" vertical are actually not very good, particularly for someone carrying so little weight."
steelers,34kwnv,doodadoodoo,9,Sat May 2 04:40:46 2015 UTC,He gets up.  Alabama game he took the ball from a 6'6 receiver high pointing it in the end zone.  He was the reason they upset Alabama.
steelers,34kwnv,Rorbotron,3,Sat May 2 04:50:13 2015 UTC,"The thing about that play (Diehard Ole Miss fan, my compliments on the pick) is that the QB seemed to make the right call. FS Cody Prewitt had over the top responsibility on Amari Cooper and had to squeeze down, giving the illusion that the tall TE, OJ Howard would be open at the back of the endzone on the seam route, because it looked like the corner, Senquez, couldn't make the play... Until he made the play..  He's been a huge playmaker and once he gave up trying to be a dual sport athlete he only gotten better and better."
steelers,34kwnv,doodadoodoo,2,Sat May 2 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the post.  As far as the dual sports are concerned the mlb has something like what 70 rounds?  He was drafted out of highschool in the 7th, maybe 8th   he's gonna be a good one for us.  We need defensive turnovers and it seems like that's all he does."
steelers,34kwnv,Swazi,2,Sat May 2 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, allegedly he turned down a 1.1 million dollar signing bonus because he didn't want to give up football. He could easily be playing pro baseball right now if he had wanted to. He was a good contributor to Ole Miss's solid baseball team for a couple of years before giving up to focus on football. Once he started doing football year round he started getting better and better. He was amazing this past year and I don't think we've seen him peak yet.   Most players get 3-4 years full time playing only football before they hit the league, he's only had like 1.5, during which time he has improved vastly. He can hit, he can cover, but yeah, he makes his living creating turnovers, and he does it well. And don't go crazy about his height, he covered plenty of tall recievers and OM's defense led the nation in lowest ppg, in large part due to the secondary, of which he was the best player."

Both iterations of the Steel Curtain have always been built on draft selections. When we look and see other teams make huge monetary mistakes on big-name FAs, we can only be convinced that our way is the right way.  As for the CB thing, our FO simply doesn't value the position like other teams do. Our defenses have always relied on pass rush. The Steel Curtain I had a monstrous D-Line with Mean Joe, LC Greenwood, Ernie Holmes, and Dwight White. The Steel Curtain II had a monstrous LB corps with James Farrior, James Harrison, Lawrence Timmons, and Lamarr Woodley. The FO is rebuilding a new monster LB corps in Timmons, Dupree, Jarvis Jones, and Ryan Shazier.  Golson in the second was the first CB selection we've made before the third round in ten years. The last time we picked a DB in the first was Troy Polamalu himself in 2003. The Steeler defensive mindset is that elite pass rush can elevate an average or mediocre secondary."

steelers,34lyzm,Steinerway,6,Sat May 2 17:03:07 2015 UTC,"Great teams are smart with their salary cap dollars - they get great value out of their player contracts.   When you draft a player, you get the following advantages: a) cheap contact, b) your team gets to coach and influence the player in his most formative professional years, c) ""hungry"" players looking to earn their first huge payday - the 2nd contact after the rookie deal expires.  On the other hand, with a free agent, you have the following disadvantages: a) an expensive contact because you are bidding against other teams, which drives the price up, b) a flawed player, because why did his previous team decide to get rid of him?  In the salary cap era, every dollar that you save by getting good production from a player on a cheap rookie deal is a dollar that can be used to re-sign your superstars. Every dollar you waste by over-paying for a free agent is a dollar that you can't spend when your own good players need to re-sign."

Two of the three who were not: The greats James Farrior and Ryan Clark (third was Justin Hartwig)  2010 Super Bowl appearance: 18 of 22 starters drafted/signed as UDFAs by Pittsburgh. Two were tackles Jonathan Scott and Flozell Adams filling in for injured Pittsburgh-drafted starters Max Starks and Willie Colon. Other two were Farrior and Clark.  Contrast that to, say, the Raiders who haven't had a winning season since 2002: ten starters drafted by the team in 2014, five of whom were rookies. I'm not including Charles Woodson in those numbers since he wasn't drafted by the current regime and spent seven years in Green Bay before returning to Oakland. Not like, say, William Gay who only spent one year elsewhere before returning.  That's why the Steelers build through the draft rather than free agency. That's why they don't reach for needs like CB, but instead take the best player available. Because it works."

You're focusing on one metric to predict this guy's failure. How is someone going to throw it over his head if he keeps the receiver in front of him? Even if he does get beat, how about if he's smart enough to reach between a receiver's hands to cause an incompletion? He's been playing this height his entire life and managed to be successful.

steelers,34ktwo,hoponthe,10,Sat May 2 10:19:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because when Baltimore traded up they didn't figure it out. Maybe they were fielding trade offers and decided to stay put. Maybe there were two guys they rated really close to the same and took their time making their decision. Maybe Colbert and Tomlin deserve a tiny bit more respect than you're giving them."

steelers,34ktwo,Intropy_,22,Sat May 2 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"So here's what's up about playing corner  QBs throw the ball to the most open read. If you can stay on your man, even if he's 6-8 inches taller than you, most QBs aren't going to throw it. The reason is that it takes an exceptionally accurate QB to put that ball up high enough for the receiver to get it where you can't. There are only a couple of guys in the league with that level of aim.   So if he can stick to his man in coverage, which it seems like he can do from what video I've seen, then he'll prevent throws his way.  Secondly, tackling matters a lot. That prevents small plays from becoming big. He can tackle.   Thirdly, you can't teach good instinct. He seems to have a knack for snagging the ball out of the air. That's good."

steelers,34ktwo,Nicholas0817,32,Sat May 2 01:13:03 2015 UTC,"As much as I want to, I don't like this pick at all. I feel there was much better talent at other positions. Plus I'm not a fan of small corners. 5'8 corner is going to cover 6'4 AJ Green? 6'3 Breshad Perriman? I doubt it.  I feel as though we just spent a second round pick on a nickel CB.  Edit: for comparison, Dri Archer is listed at 5'8 and 173. Golson is 5'9 and 176.  Edit 2: just read on Rotoworld that he struggled playing outside CB, surrendering 5 touchdowns last season. He appears to be going to be limited to playing inside, so basically he's William Gay's eventual replacement."
steelers,34ktwo,pyates13,16,Sat May 2 01:16:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, so... not picking on you particularly, just that yours is the same comment for the umpteenth time, so I'm responding here:  The corner doesn't need to be tall to cover a tall receiver. He needs to have the speed and agility to stay with a receiver, recover ground if the receiver makes a move, and the body control to deny the receiver a good route, and to get his hands in between the receiver's body and the ball to deny a successful catch.   Tall is nice, and if a CB is tall, that may help make up for those other attributes. But if a CB doesn't have those other attributes it doesn't matter how tall he is, he won't be that good.   This kid is a legitimate talent at the position, and seems to grade out pretty well. Why don't we let him play a down or two before we throw the scouting department, coaching staff and entire front office under a bus. Not to mention, I would bet that our CB coach probably had a say too.  But then, what the heck could Carnell Lake possibly know about what it takes to be a good CB . . ."
steelers,34ktwo,AlbirdEinstein,4,Sat May 2 01:37:28 2015 UTC,"It's all good discussion, nothing personal. Different opinions doesn't mean picking on someone :)  To me the problem with short corners is that they struggle to succeed in the last point you mention: breaking up the pass. Shorter arms and shorter height come into play here. He's not going to win a lot of jump balls, and will have to play very, very close for contested balls. They're playing CB in expert mode, all the time, whereas larger CBs have a little cushion due to their longer length.  And at his size he's going to struggle with more physical receivers. The height in and of itself isn't the problem, but the shorter length, lower vertical, and general lack of size is the problem. I can see a guy like Green or Perriman or Steve Smith simply outmuscling him on any given play. Where will he get the strength to jam receivers? Can he be more physical than those guys to adjust the routes? Will he be injury prone? Small DBs frequently are (such as Bob Sanders and our own Shamarko).  Lastly, I don't have anything against the player, but I do have a problem with him being picked in the second. If he was picked in the fourth, very few people would have a problem with it. But a second round pick? That's awfully high for a guy who lacks physical traits, while there were other talented guys available. He's a very risky second rounder, IMO, and there were other guys at the same position who could have been considered.  I hope I'm wrong (I'll gladly eat crow) and that we just drafted the next Antoine Winfield. But time after time, these small cornerbacks struggle, particularly with the quality of WRs the league has now."

steelers,34ktwo,MrGoosemahn,10,Sat May 2 02:09:06 2015 UTC,"They're not going to put him against #1 receivers right off the bat. If he really is as good as all the announcers hyped him up to be, in a few years he'll be able to outskill those receivers, height doesn't always matter.  Edit: He held Amari Cooper (arguably the best receiver in the draft) to 9 catches for 91 yds, the Steelers did their homework on this one."
steelers,34ktwo,FreedObject,10,Sat May 2 13:24:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not one of the people hating this pick, but... holding a WR to NINE catches for almost 100 yards is considered a good performance?"
steelers,34ktwo,wendysNO1wcheese,6,Sat May 2 01:08:18 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing. Cooper ate him up.
steelers,34ktwo,keats360,12,Sat May 2 02:32:10 2015 UTC,"Not initially, but eventually. He's not going to get taller, and AJ Green and co. aren't going to go anywhere anytime soon. A second round pick should be a quality starter, at the very least. So even if he doesn't face them this year, he will starting next year, and when he does I think the size mismatch will give him a lot of problems. It's not just about height, it's about physicality and fighting for the ball. I don't see it happening with him.  This guy is the same size as Dri Archer. There is no way he'll hold up."
steelers,34ktwo,wendysNO1wcheese,3,Sat May 2 03:02:09 2015 UTC,"hey, he may get taller. Hes only 21, and I think males grow until about 24. but still hes not gonna get THAT MUCH taller."

steelers,34ktwo,Psychward723,4,Sat May 2 01:23:09 2015 UTC,"After letting it marinate, here is what I think  I think the reason we all dislike him as of now, is he is short. He won't be able to stop the deep jump ball. While this is fact I think we need to look at why the deep ball was a theme in the first place. It all comes down to the pass rush.   Last year we did not have a great pass rush, quarterbacks had plenty of time, and had the pocket to take a 5 step drop, take their time, and make an accurate deep throw. With Bud, and our blitz packages, having more consistent pressure will force bad throws both deep and short, something that Senquez really takes advantage of.   Here's a situation, we send a blitz, we get pressure, qb steps up in the pocket and finds a WR wide open on a short rout, just beating the CB outright. Sound familiar? With Senquez, if the qb is under pressure, if he doesn't make a perfect throw/decision, there is a high chance he will get his hands on the ball. Height isn't as important for short routs. If the QB has time, they can slip the throw in, but if the QB is under pressure, with LB's draped all around him he will not be able to put the ball in the perfect position where Golson can't get to it.   Of course the deep ball will still happen, but it wont be a perfect deep ball. With a QB under pressure, the deep ball will be slightly overthrown, slightly underthrow, you never know. He was drafted by the MLB as an outfielder, he looks like Ed Reed the way he hawks under balls. If the QB looks deep, and is under pressure, and gets a bad throw off, he looks to be the perfect guy to go hawk that ball.  I think his success relies on the output of the front 7. If Bud plays well, I think he plays well.   This is all just speculation, think what you want. If you disagree, please don't downvote me, instead leave a comment with your own oppinion"
steelers,34ktwo,RenderedInGooseFat,5,Sat May 2 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"I like your thoughts. I see these two picks as great compliments as well, especially since Golson is experienced with zone coverage. My main worry with him is when we're in the red zone"
steelers,34ktwo,OriginalOutlaw,7,Sat May 2 01:16:03 2015 UTC,He has the instincts and cover skills to potentially play outside in spite of his height. Even if he can't though he is an elite slot CB prospect with amazing hands and ball skills. I like the pick.

Alex Carter I can kind of understand but some people have had him falling to the end of the 3rd and he is neither exciting nor dynamic.   The Steelers run a lot of zone where their CBs are not asked to get up on top of receivers so Golson won't be asked to fight for jump balls often. Antwon Blake, Brice McCain, and William Gay were all solid last year in the Steelers defense and that was without a consistent pass rush or good Safety play. If Golson were two inches taller he'd have been the 3rd CB off the board, his technique and skills are that good."

steelers,34ktwo,deverhartdu,3,Sat May 2 02:05:49 2015 UTC,"Scouting Synopsis from the BTSC Big Board:  Senquez Golson, CB, Ole Miss (Interviewed & Visit) - 5'8-1/2"", 178 lbs. with short, 29-3/4"" arms. Weakness: size, both in height and overall mass. He'd be yet another mighty mite in the Steelers secondary. Strengths: pretty much everything else. Golson is athletic enough that the Red Sox spent a draft pick on him too. As for football-specific skills, Mike Mayock has consistently lauded his ""rare ball skills"" and high football IQ, and even gone so far as to say ""he tracks the ball as well as anyone I've ever seen"". Golson is everyone's favorite ""sleeper,"" to the point that I feel confident in saying that he'd be in the conversation for the Steelers pick at 1:22 if he was even two inches taller. But of course he is not. This scouting report from the NFL site is a good place to start. Golson's skill set really impressed former NFL strong safety Matt Bowen at the Senior Bowl, along with most other observers. This scouting profile comparing Golson and Steve Nelson comes from retired NFL scout Greg Gabriel. This is another joint scouting report (CB Kevin White and Golson), this time from our sister site for the Panthers."
steelers,34ktwo,MalnutritionUSA,3,Sat May 2 13:44:33 2015 UTC,"Optimist here, hi. ""What's the ideal size for a cornerback""; pie chart of pro bowl CBs 2001-2010.  http://touchthebanner.blogspot.fi/2010/11/whats-ideal-size-for-cornerback.html  I'd like to point out, this is slightly outdated, and I believe nickel CBs are of more importance in today's NFL. During the first decade of this millennium, the league wasn't as pass oriented as it's been the past few years. More teams are lining up with an extra wide receiver or two, creating more need for nickel CBs. Ten years ago, WRs the size of Welker, Hilton or Andrew Hawkins. The only short WR with success from that era, that I can remember, is Steve Smith.   Still, every tenth CB is a significant share of the pie, considering that there probably weren't many CBs of that size in the league to begin with. We'll see how Golson fares!"
steelers,34ktwo,hermafrijol,3,Sat May 2 02:21:48 2015 UTC,"Shorter guys can change direction and ""flip the hips"" much easier. It's simple physics, in a way. Richard Sherman is unusually good at that despite his 6'3 frame. Aside from that, you want the shorter guys for certain tasks."

If they were 3 inches taller, they'd have been a top pick in the draft.  Year in and year out the NFL proves something to us, and that is size can be overcame if it is the only red-flag. Golson is without question an excellent cover corner in every aspect other than size, let this kid step on the field he's about to prove a lot of people wrong."

Golson is a day one contributor as a slot corner if nothing else and he could very well win a starting job due to how polished he is."

Tuitt looked good, but he's hardly tested and hasn't fully proven himself. I would have liked Carl Davis or a depth DE.   O line did great last year, but Foster needs to be replaced and we don't really have any depth. We got pretty lucky with injuries last season.  Pass rusher is fine, but a depth pick wouldn't have been horrible.  Can never have enough corners, especially when ours are currently Gay, Allen, and Blake. We got Golson, which is a pick that I like, but he's short. A more traditional pick (like Ifo) would have been a nice security blanket in case Golson doesn't turn out, and good depth even if he doesn't. Like, we have just about nothing at CB right now.  Even if just as a luxury pick, WR would have been very low on that list, and there are still needs that I would've preferred a bit of a reach on.  But, like I said. Faith in Colbert."

Both could be drafted in the 5th round or later. You're not going to find an athlete like Coates later in the draft.  If it hasn't become completely obvious, I think the Steelers see Cortez as more solid than the fanbase and may not see CB as a high need. They could still find a development CB in the later rounds or a bounce back candidate like Ifo in the 4th/5th."

I still like him, but with Golson being our 2nd pick, I think it might be smart to pick up a taller (if a little less-refined) player in the 6th or so. 4th & 5th I'd like to see at least one of TE or OL, preferably both."

I feel like they wanted depth in case of anything happening with our main wrs and the maybe our cap situation for the next couple years. I still believe we can pick up Ifo in the 4th.

steelers,34l4u3,codyrl95,1 point,Sat May 2 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"In case you can't tell, the coaching staff has faith that Cortez's issue is purely mental and are comfortable with Gay, Blake, Allen, and Golson. They'll probably get another CB and maybe a S in the later rounds."
steelers,34l4u3,yeshua1986,1 point,Sat May 2 11:45:46 2015 UTC,We barely had a secondary last year and we made the playoffs! Plus there are still more picks to be made
steelers,34l4u3,meowdy,1 point,Sat May 2 12:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah this draft has been funny like that because we've gotten snaked, gotten a slip and had a reach, but not really gone after our obvious needs.  It all depends on the fan. The optimistic ones think ""look at the cool guys we got"" and the more realistic ones are confused because we're not addressing gaping needs.  I mean...I'm sure we'll all love Coates and it won't surprise me if he turns out to be a special player, but everyone will forget that we went without when discussing the pick in retrospect."
steelers,34l4u3,smacksaw,1 point,Sat May 2 04:44:30 2015 UTC,"Well look at it this way, it's good to get young receivers in there with a QB like Big Ben. They will develop better and Ben will thrive. Give him weapons, he will give back something incredible. He's not Jay Cutler."
steelers,34l4u3,stuckmeformypaper,1 point,Sat May 2 05:41:25 2015 UTC,"BPA.  once both Collins boys, Rowe, PJ Williams, and Eli all went off the board, Coates was really the best choice at that point."
steelers,34l4u3,Swazi,1 point,Sat May 2 06:03:32 2015 UTC,"Well, not entirely.  We have 3 WRs who belong on an NFL offense, our 4th WR is DHB, that's our depth.  That's it."
steelers,34l4u3,slivr33,1 point,Sat May 2 07:15:05 2015 UTC,"Not really. Who is our #4 receiver? Before the draft, it was Heyward-Bey. If an injury happens at WR, we do not want DHB seeing significant playing time. This was an area that needed addressed"
steelers,34l4u3,meowdy,1 point,Sat May 2 12:52:57 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, I just don't know that a 3rd rounder on a guy with dropping issues was the best course to help that.  But, like Ozzie said about Perriman, drops can be coached. Maybe we will have something special here."
steelers,34l4u3,MichelangeBro,37,Sat May 2 13:01:39 2015 UTC,"Auburn fan here (don't have an NFL team, just wanted to stop by and help with discussion):  Sammie is a play maker. Explosive athlete, good route runner, stretches the defense,strong for his size, and fights well for the ball. His hands are what kept him out of the first round, but he has made improvement over his 3 years of football. I was one that said he needed another year to develop, especially since we're moving towards a more pass heavy offense. He's never had a true pocket QB to get him the ball, so it's hard to tell if his hands were shaky because of the QB not putting it where it needed to be or because they need improvement.  Overall, I think Sammie will be a solid number two option if given a year or two to come into his own. Since you have Brown, he won't be expected to be the guy, and I think that will help him develop.   Here's a link: http://www.collegeandmagnolia.com/2015/4/22/8468785/auburn-tigers-2015-nfl-draft-prospect-sammie-coates and I can answer some questions if you have any."
steelers,34l4u3,TheWarEagle,29,Sat May 2 03:00:29 2015 UTC,"Also want to add: He was undoubtedly our team leader, I don't know if I've ever seen a guy more respected by the team than Sammie. What he said went. Guys didn't act a fool at the bar or get into trouble when he was around. Also, he was one of Auburn's biggest ambassadors and did a lot for the community. Watch this. You'll never have to worry about off the field trouble with him and he will come in with a great work ethic and as a potential team leader."
steelers,34l4u3,TheWarEagle,12,Sat May 2 03:06:46 2015 UTC,"You just sold me. I will admit, I was quite angry at the pick, Not because of him... Just because I wanted another position (namely anything on Defense)  But if this guy is a true leader, and well respected thats a guy I want in the locker room, he makes other people better. Also, He has the potential to be really fucking good. And Pittsburgh has been really good at WR development over the past few years"
steelers,34l4u3,lurkedlongtime,2,Sat May 2 04:44:32 2015 UTC,"Sammie is the man, you guys are so luck to have him. I've had the pleasure of meeting him a few times here in auburn.  Hopefully this gets you excited"
steelers,34l4u3,twerkallknight,3,Sat May 2 17:27:13 2015 UTC,Heh I just checked my phone because it went off with reddit message. I was reading this exact article while doing so haha
steelers,34l4u3,lurkedlongtime,1 point,Sat May 2 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"Wanted to say the same. After hearing that from 2 loyal fans, that sold me tothemoon"
steelers,34l4u3,keats360,3,Sat May 2 05:10:48 2015 UTC,Force yourself to guess:  The hands come from a lack of concentration or a more rudimentary offense that doesn't feature the WR.
steelers,34l4u3,smacksaw,2,Sat May 2 04:53:04 2015 UTC,"The good character aspect is getting mentioned with all 3 of our picks, must have been on everyone's minds in the front office."
steelers,34l4u3,fatguyinakilt,5,Sat May 2 14:30:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. Two questions:   In your opinion, was Coates the best WR still available? We have an established #1 WR and a #2 in Bryant/Wheaton. That leaves Coates to play slot, which doesn't seem to fit his skill set. Did he play any snaps at slot at Auburn, and how did his performance there compare to playing outside?"
steelers,34l4u3,Purple_Dragon,6,Sat May 2 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"The only other receiver in the best available that I've seen a lot of is Greene at FSU and I would say Sammie is better. There aren't many guys more explosive than him.  Our slot receiver for most of the year was Quan Bray, but Coates lined up there a little. I think he's better on the outside because that allows him to stretch the field which is the best quality he brings to the table. I do think he has the quickness and strength to line up in the slot on occasion, but I think lining him up there regularly takes away most of what he brings to a gameplan."
steelers,34l4u3,TheWarEagle,5,Sat May 2 03:15:50 2015 UTC,"I have to think that either Wheaton or Bryant won't be signed after their rookie deals are finished. Wheaton is more suited for the slot than Bryant. With Wheaton due for a new contract one year before Bryant, and if Bryant continues to outperform Wheaton, it's possible that Wheaton gets his and Bryant hits the market as a cap casualty.   You then have Brown and Coates on the outside with Wheaton in the slot, which sounds fantastic on paper. Also kinda curious if they'd put Brown in the slot on 3 receiver sets, just due to his size and great hands for underneath routes.   Glad to hear this guy is great off the field. Thanks again for the info."
steelers,34l4u3,Purple_Dragon,4,Sat May 2 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"Not a problem! Sammie was my 2nd favorite player during my 4 years here. I loved what he did on the field and how he represented my school. He's a great guy and a hard worker, and he'll be a good player. Personally, I was terrified he was going to get picked up early 2nd by a team that couldn't afford a year of patience. I think that if given time to grow he'll be a great 2/solid 1."
steelers,34l4u3,TheWarEagle,2,Sat May 2 03:29:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering all these questions! I'm really excited to have him in a steelers uniform now. If you don't mind me asking, who was your favorite player?"
steelers,34l4u3,Soupmaster44,2,Sat May 2 12:45:07 2015 UTC,"Philip Lutzenkirchen, RIP. As far as I'm concerned, he might be the greatest human to step foot on our campus. Big time player, even bigger heart."
steelers,34l4u3,TheWarEagle,3,Sat May 2 19:41:14 2015 UTC,"We have an established #1 WR and a #2 in Bryant/Wheaton.   Also this lesser know guy named Antonio Bryant.  Honestly, it's a good move. The Steelers have a track record of turning 3rd receivers into stars. Bryant is still raw and Wheaton hasn't shown anything. You absolutely need three good receivers to thrive in this league. They spent the first and second picks shoring up the two most important needs on defense.  The only thing missing from this draft is a TE and a capable backup safety. I think they'll get one of them in the next round (fingers crossed for Jesse James)."
steelers,34l4u3,tonytroz,1 point,Sat May 2 05:00:10 2015 UTC,Antonio Bryant huh? Might as well call him Frankenstein.   I agree that having three quality receivers (one of which can be a TE) is becoming close to a necessity. I disagree about Wheaton not having shown anything yet. His performance has been good for where he was drafted and I have confidence that he'll continue to improve.
steelers,34l4u3,Purple_Dragon,1 point,Sat May 2 05:06:55 2015 UTC,We needed other positions more than WR.

Kind of a weird pick given our receivers, but I guess they think he can be another guy to stretch the field. Makes me wonder what their long term vision of Wheaton is."
steelers,34l4u3,ns156,6,Sat May 2 03:08:14 2015 UTC,maybe more 4 receiver sets? i think wheaton will still be a big part of the offense.

steelers,34l4u3,bamadeo,1 point,Sat May 2 03:46:48 2015 UTC,I think they may let Wheaton walk when his rookie deal is done.

steelers,34l4u3,yeshua1986,8,Sat May 2 11:28:41 2015 UTC,"He has essentially the same physical/athletic traits as Amari Cooper.  The only reason he slipped this far is because Auburn didn't throw it as much and when they did he had the drops (he was still Auburn's leading WR btw)  Coach Mann feels his drop issue can be fixed.  If they are, we pretty much got Cooper in the third round."
steelers,34l4u3,Swazi,4,Sat May 2 06:01:27 2015 UTC,Five catches for 200 yards in one game.  That YAC.....

steelers,34l4u3,FoxeRsmash,6,Sat May 2 02:57:35 2015 UTC,"I wanted to hate the pick because we don't really need a WR, but I sorta like Coates and we've been really good at developing WRs, so I have some faith in the pick. Would still rather have Steven Nelson at that pick."
steelers,34l4u3,CeeBeast,6,Sat May 2 03:15:15 2015 UTC,"You have to think that with the value we got with Dupree, the FO has faith in this year's team without many changes. I would be inclined to believe them."
steelers,34l4u3,fauxedo,2,Sat May 2 03:45:28 2015 UTC,yeah i just half assume/joke that were taking a WR every 3rd round
steelers,34l4u3,SicaBiasThrowaway,2,Sat May 2 03:48:06 2015 UTC,I think we're channeling our inner Al Davis and Heyward-Bey is helping us grab those guys with great speed and hands that need a lot of work.
steelers,34l4u3,smacksaw,7,Sat May 2 04:42:07 2015 UTC,I'm actually happy that we picked him. On one of the bold prediction threads a couple days ago I thought the Steelers would take him in the second.

steelers,34l4u3,reppapalooza,2,Sat May 2 03:21:46 2015 UTC,This...makes me feel a little better. Not necessarily about the Steelers pick but because at least I know the Ravens took their deep threat with sketchy hands in the 1st.

steelers,34l4u3,tennmyc21,3,Sat May 2 02:56:02 2015 UTC,As a Bama fan.... This guy totally had an NFL body in college...torched us ..... Hopefully he'll improve upon his catching
steelers,34l4u3,Wde7890,3,Sat May 2 03:04:54 2015 UTC,"He's big, strong, fast, really aggressive, good at high pointing the ball and catching in traffic.  He reminds me a bit of Perriman in that if you watch his tape he'll make some amazing grabs, but then drop a pass on the numbers with no one within ten yards of him.  He played huge in Auburn's biggest games, so I like that aspect of him too.  He torched LSU, Ole Miss, and Bama.  Definitely had some concerning no-shows, but you can say that about anyone, especially a 3rd round prospect.     For what it's worth, he has the potential to be an absolute beast of a gunner, so I really see him helping out on special teams (kind of making DHB moot).  He is also a really aggressive player, and seems to really love blocking.  He needs to work on technique, but he's a very willing blocker, which will be important.  He needs to work on his routes, his concentration, and it will take him a bit to pick up the offense.    He was a luxury, but in the 3rd round it makes sense to start thinking more BPA.  I was hoping to come out with some OL help, but am happy with Coates."
steelers,34l4u3,ShaquilleO_feel,3,Sat May 2 03:21:26 2015 UTC,"You guys just got a freak of an athlete that needs a little development. He benches 400+, and has a crazy high vertical. He has the strength to beat press coverage off the line and the speed to beat guys outside. He won't beat double coverage because he's not a great route runner, but with Brown and Bryant there he won't have to. And he's probably going to have a few drops, but he will also make some ridiculous catches downfield. If you look at the scouting report for Julio Jones out of college it's pretty similar."
steelers,34l4u3,steelcurtain84,6,Sat May 2 04:02:10 2015 UTC,Idk man... I really don't. Seems like such a luxury pick when we could have helped our defense or offensive line immensely.

steelers,34l4u3,theonechurler,5,Sat May 2 03:00:45 2015 UTC,Bunch of draft experts in here. I think I'll leave the WR evaluations to the people who drafted Mike Wallace (3rd) Emmanuel Sanders (3rd) Antonio Brown (6th) Martavis Bryant (4th) I think they may know a little more than a weekend evaluator on reddit.

steelers,34l4u3,Flesheatinmonky,2,Sat May 2 02:59:56 2015 UTC,"Nice. Looks like a solid player that fell alot because it's a deep wr class. We might not want to resign Wheaton, and DHB isn't very good. Depth at a position isn't a bad thing. Especially in round 3."
steelers,34l4u3,biscuitz23,2,Sat May 2 03:11:14 2015 UTC,I know this is weird but he's a high class guy. We pick mid-round WR every year and they always end up at least decent. So the way I see it is by the end of the year he's WR4 just above DHB and maybe above Marty or Markus if they start screwing up. I trust the team with this pick. They know what their doing. They've shown that time and time again.
steelers,34l4u3,Ogaminator,2,Sat May 2 03:14:36 2015 UTC,Guys going crazy over this pick.... but if a injury do occur and we're left to put in DHB (which I like him) people will see why we drafted a WR that could potentially be a stud.

steelers,34l4u3,Tommy9fff,2,Sat May 2 03:18:05 2015 UTC,Can't really believe what I'm hearing between picking this guy and Senquez before him. Having 4 solid options at receiver isn't a bad thing the last time I checked and watch Senquez's highlights before you judge him by his size. Every person we have taken this year has speed and is a PLAYMAKER. I have faith in our front office and believe that this will become one of our best draft classes yet.
steelers,34l4u3,dangerm0use,2,Sat May 2 03:25:26 2015 UTC,"I actually like what the steelers have done in the first 3 rounds. Bud Dupree, apart from being the BPA he also filled a huge need.  Senquez Golson is a player who fits right with our heavy zone scheme, and even though he is small he is being judged because of his measurables, and really as a player, he fits what we need and what we do and faced some tough competition in the SEC. Has some great instincts for the position and great ballhawking skills.  And then comes Sammie Coates the speedy WR from Auburn. He got great physical tools and make big and explosive plays in Auburn. His knocks are his hands, and his route running, which luckily are the most coachable traits in a wide receiver IMO.  Even though the picks are not flashy, i think they make the team better and filled some huge needs, which gives Colbert and Tomlin more flexibilty for the upcoming rounds.  I hope we pick Jesse James and Ifo Ekpre Olomu. ;)"
steelers,34l4u3,jakeeispro,2,Sat May 2 03:36:02 2015 UTC,"I feared that we would reach for our immediate, obvious needs, and with the Golson pick it looks like we may/could have (though a 1st-team all-american and all-sec can't be that much of a reach).    I like that we drafted Coates.  I remember someone (Labriola?) on SNR saying they bumped into Haley and he was in shorts and no socks, making a joke that he wouldn't be busy today (friday).  I was scared shitless if they would simply ignore a huge talent just because he plays offense.    Folks- good players can be found in later rounds.  AB was a 6er, Kam Chancellor was too.  Sherman was a 4th rounder (I think), and solid starters (which is what we want from our CBs, not studs) can be found readily, if not easily, in the later rounds.  They are ALL gambles, so let them do their thing.  They have a system and it works.  I'll admit the system is harsh if you miss on a bunch of players in a row (like it has for CB currently and OL a few years ago), but it will self-correct."

I love this pick though, as the Steelers are selecting another talented player who dropped into their lap. Sammie Coates easily could've gone in the second round, but dropped because he, well, drops a lot of passes. That's something that can be coached up. Coates' athleticism, on the other hand, cannot.

steelers,34lcfw,fire8up,12,Sat May 2 04:20:22 2015 UTC,We don't need a free safety unless you don't believe in shark or Mitchell.  Golden signed his tender and we have will allen.  I can see a safety but I didn't expect one on day two.
steelers,34lcfw,Rorbotron,1 point,Sat May 2 04:44:28 2015 UTC,I belive in Mitchell playing further up the field closer to the box like be did in Carolina.  With Shark playing a similar role
steelers,34lcfw,fire8up,3,Sat May 2 05:57:13 2015 UTC,"Mitchell played the Deep safety more than in the box in Carolina, infact in Carolina, he was known for deep coverage and not run support.  That isnt to say Mitchell cant play SS, he has before and the is not ruled out playing there this season"

steelers,34lcfw,maltrab,1 point,Sat May 2 14:34:54 2015 UTC,I didn't even know PJ had a DUI. That's sad.
steelers,34lcfw,zjrk,3,Sat May 2 17:53:02 2015 UTC,I've bitched enough about Coates so i'll leave that alone from now until the draft is over.  Golson is gonna be a beast though. He's a day one contributor who should finally help the secondary generate some turnovers.
steelers,34lcfw,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Sat May 2 06:02:18 2015 UTC,"I was pretty shocked they picked Coates.  But if anyone can turn him into a quality receiver, its the Steelers."
steelers,34lcfw,ColdNose,3,Sat May 2 07:06:44 2015 UTC,"Hate to say it but Cleveland is nailing this draft.  Shelton, Irving, Nate Orchard, Duke Johnson, AND Xavier Cooper.  Damn."
steelers,34lcfw,ColdNose,1 point,Sat May 2 07:03:34 2015 UTC,"Cleveland ""killed"" the draft last year, too: Ray Farmer knocks first draft out of the park.   I like Shelton but why draft Duke Johnson when you already have 2 young RBs?"
steelers,34lcfw,therake210,1 point,Sat May 2 08:10:38 2015 UTC,Duke Johnson is going to give them a solid pass catcher out of the backfield along with a very good runner. Maybe a slight reach for them but he's still a very good player.
steelers,34lcfw,ColdNose,1 point,Sat May 2 08:16:52 2015 UTC,"I like him as a player no doubt, just don't see where he fits in with West and Crowell. I guess they just aren't going to throw the ball like the Rams."
steelers,34lcfw,therake210,3,Sat May 2 08:19:57 2015 UTC,Whether we agree or disagree with what we got so far. Im sure none of us can handle the stress that Tomlin and Colbert handle daily. Be thankful that we don't hold there positions and let them do what they are paid for! I love the Steelers till the day I die. Im all for what decision they ever make!
steelers,34lcfw,Cthemacdaddy,5,Sat May 2 08:22:35 2015 UTC,I love the Coates pick. We have 0 depth at WR and Coates seems to be a YPR and YAC monster. He had some concentration drops but I think some of his drops can be attributed to a very bad passing scheme and a bad QB at Auburn. I think he will be the returner coming week 1 and he might make his way onto the offensive side of the ball once he develops his routes.   I'm skeptical of Golson. The size is a concern but having a corner that can actually catch is pretty awesome. So many wasted turnovers from stone hands CBs. I don't think he can match up 1 on 1 with tall receivers but give him safety help over the top and he should be able to do it.
steelers,34lcfw,White_Bread21,1 point,Sat May 2 06:35:30 2015 UTC,His quarterback was not exactly bad!
steelers,34lcfw,MyMobileLogin,2,Sat May 2 13:14:40 2015 UTC,Overall I'm happy with it. Probably reached a bit for Golson but he should be a good fit in our defense. Coates...what can you say that already hasn't been said? I'm a big fan of BPA and getting talent on the team and using them any way you can so hopefully he'll develop and contribute but we need to hit need areas hard on day 3.
steelers,34lcfw,therake210,2,Sat May 2 08:12:40 2015 UTC,"I am so happy with the talent drafted so far. 3 studs...really. Dupree, Golson and Coates all have that potential ""game changer"" talent at their positions.  Turnovers and touchdowns....it's what wins games."
steelers,34lcfw,Day_n_Night,1 point,Sat May 2 12:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'm loving this draft so far. Think we're doing a lot better than expected. Dupree is just a stud. Golson is one hell of a CB, only downside is he's only 5'9"". Also, I believe Coates will just end up being amazing for us. Put him and Bryant on the outside and just tell them to run and leave Antonio underneath with leveon in the back field and Big Ben at the helm. OMG"
steelers,34lcfw,SteelCurtain3399,1 point,Sat May 2 11:26:07 2015 UTC,"There are so many different strategies to winning. You can fill needs, OR you can capitalize on strengths. With the Coates pick, they added to their strength at wide receiver."

steelers,34lej2,MrGoosemahn,5,Sat May 2 04:42:50 2015 UTC,"If I am reading this correctly Tuitt is considered a below average NFL athlete? Is this just biased away from linemen and towards smaller players?  He seems plenty athletic as a 5 tech, but I get his athleticism is not going to be equal to a guy like Shazier either."
steelers,34lej2,fatguyinakilt,2,Sat May 2 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's not particularly useful for linemen, but it's still accurate. The formula has some blind spots. But at the same time linemen are the least athletic guys, so it makes sense. Tuitt as a 5tech is in the same category as guys like Clowney, so it could be argued that he's below average as a DE, regardless of scheme.  JJ Watt, also a 34 DE, though not necessarily a 5tech, scored a monster 147.7."
steelers,34lej2,lurkedlongtime,2,Sat May 2 05:18:54 2015 UTC,"Where are the numbers being pulled for Tuitt, he never had any workouts pre draft, publicly.   Foot Surgery, no known 40 etc."
steelers,34lej2,Steelering,1 point,Sat May 2 07:32:29 2015 UTC,Good question. Maybe some older workout from his junior season or something. Or a team workout. The injury could also explain his low rating.
steelers,34lej2,lurkedlongtime,1 point,Sat May 2 14:39:21 2015 UTC,"yeah, linemen are different, they need something different to rate them something similarly catchy like BLDZR: Bulk, Length, Density, Zip, and Radius"
steelers,34lej2,Ndlaxfan,1 point,Sat May 2 06:29:45 2015 UTC,"I imagine Tuitt is hurt heavily, unless a lot of numbers are pulled out of nowhere.  Because he never had a combine or proday, technically speaking there is almost no public record of any of Tuitts workouts... besides Bench?"
steelers,34lej2,Intropy_,1 point,Sat May 2 07:31:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's hard to watch that 60 yard fumble recovery for a TD in his junior season and think he's a below average athlete"
steelers,34lej2,SleestakLightning,2,Sun May 3 13:53:03 2015 UTC,"Senquez Golson's SPARQ score of 110 is only 25th percentile among NFL CBs, so I don't think putting it in the middle of the average range is quite right."
steelers,34lej2,simmonsb,-4,Sat May 2 06:45:50 2015 UTC,Last year was a response to them taking one of the worst SPARQ athletes ever the year before when they drafted shitty Jarvis Jones.   Seems like the trend is continuing. I like it.
steelers,34lej2,SleestakLightning,5,Sat May 2 04:51:27 2015 UTC,"A man isn't a number. Let's judge JJ on his next season, he was solid at the beginning of the last one."
steelers,34lej2,Atlai,1 point,Sat May 2 05:25:09 2015 UTC,All we have to judge him on right now are his measurables and the few plays he's made.
steelers,34lej2,SleestakLightning,4,Sat May 2 12:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't believe he didn't put up 15 sacks last year. It's like he barely played because of an injury or something!"
steelers,34jmnf,pyates13,17,Fri May 1 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"I don't buy it. Not that i'd be opposed to picking Maxx Williams but I don't see the team feeling compelled to jump all the way up to #33 to select him.  There are a lot of good 3rd/4th round CBs in this draft though (Doran Grant, Steven Nelson, Senquez Golson, D'Joun Smith, Josh Shaw, Charles Gaines) so maybe the Steelers have someone they like who they expect to be able to grab later."
steelers,34jmnf,PomfAndCircvmstance,24,Fri May 1 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. I'm torn here. I really like Maxx Williams, but I also really dislike having a sieve for a secondary. I feel like we'd have to give up too much to make this happen."
steelers,34jmnf,slicehix,10,Fri May 1 18:46:48 2015 UTC,If we are relentlessly pressuring the qb like the defenses of old its not gonna matter who we have at corner as long as they are fundamentally sound.  If they do this I expect a corner in the third and that corner would be a guy like Rowe.  There are a lot of corners still on the board.  I also don't think our secondary was a sieve last season and I personally haven't lost hope with Cortez Allen.
steelers,34jmnf,Rorbotron,16,Fri May 1 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"I do agree that pressuring the QB will help our secondary woes. So, I'm thrilled we got Bud last night.  However, we were 27th against the pass last year and faced a much weaker caliber of QB's last year. This year we've got the likes of Luck, Brady, and Manning.   I hope you're right about Cortez, but I have my doubts. If we can get Williams in the 2nd and a quality CB in the 3rd, I can't be too upset about that."
steelers,34jmnf,slicehix,9,Fri May 1 19:00:57 2015 UTC,I think we are going to have more traditional safety coverage now that Troy retired.  I can see Shazier adopting the new polamalu esque role if such a role is going to be used.  Add in the improved pressure.  Gay had a nice season and Blake is going to keep getting better.  Allen is the wild card and its never been about his ability but instead his confidence.  The draft tonight will likely be an indicator with how the team feels about the secondary.  If a big trade happens and we draft anything other than corner I expect they feel good about cortez.  We've got 4 more hours :)
steelers,34jmnf,Rorbotron,2,Fri May 1 19:06:24 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Jarvis Jones used for the pass rush as well. His rookie year, he jumped the line much like younger Troy a few times. Gave me so much hope."
steelers,34jmnf,Synectics,2,Fri May 1 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people have been a little quick to give up on Jarvis.  He had a few flashes his rookie year, started off really solid last year, and then got injured.  I agree he hasn't lived up to expectations yet, but I see the bust label thrown around a little too much for a guy entering his 3rd year, who everyone agreed had to develop a lot as a pass rusher given that his primary move (bull rush) wouldn't work as much at his weight in the NFL."
steelers,34jmnf,tennmyc21,6,Fri May 1 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"When we were relentlessly getting to the QB we had guys like Ike Taylor, Troy, Clark, Bryant McFadden, Keenan Lewis, and going back further, Carnell Lake, Rod Woodson, etc.  A good pass rush isnt going to matter if the WR is open within three seconds of the ball being snapped."
steelers,34jmnf,Swazi,2,Fri May 1 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"Mike Mitchell caught a bad rap last season and he was playing dinged.  He's not going to have to cover Troy's ass while he gambles.  I could also see him moving to Strong safety and shark going to free.  You also aren't giving much credit to Gay or Blake for that matter.  Gay had a really solid season and Blake plays very physical.  Improved pass rush, more traditional safety coverage with troy gone.  We are going to have a ungodly amount of speed at linebacker.  I still believe a corner is drafted tonight and Maxx Williams could be a smoke screen.  we could be moving up to draft jallen Collins or hell even Rowe."
steelers,34jmnf,Rorbotron,1 point,Fri May 1 19:16:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't mention Mitchell, but I agree with you on that, he was by himself playing the outfield most of the time.  Gay did well when needed last year, but he is better suited for the nickel.  Blake started one game last year, and his 5'9"" height is worrisome.  And that could be true that Williams is a smoke screen, but they really don't need to trade up to the top of the 2nd to get Rowe.  He can be had in the mid part of the round.  If they're going to DB and trade to the top it'd be for a Collins, be it the LSU CB or the Alabama S."
steelers,34jmnf,Swazi,3,Fri May 1 19:35:01 2015 UTC,"What I like about Blake is his nastiness. He's short, yes, but he makes up for it with his physicality. He's gonna beat up on his assignment and give them no confidence against him. He's super fast too. I just think he plays like a steeler corner should play. I hope he continues to get a chance."
steelers,34jmnf,DriArcher,2,Fri May 1 20:21:05 2015 UTC,Pass rush okay but as we saw what Brady did against the Ravens great pass rush in the playoffs if the ball leaves their hands and our best DB is Gay then we're in trouble.
steelers,34jmnf,IdunnoLXG,1 point,Fri May 1 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"We are going to draft a corner, if they trade up it could very well be for a corner as there are a lot of them still out there that's for sure.  I wanted peters, bad.  I'm happy with Dupree and I believe Cortez is our best corner.  He just needs his confidence back.  Gay also played pretty damn well last season.  He catches a lot of shot from the fan base tho."
steelers,34jmnf,Rorbotron,1 point,Fri May 1 22:44:59 2015 UTC,I don't think so. We give credit where credit's due. We heaped praise on him and honestly outside of Timmons and Harrison - he was the only one on the defense who gave a damn when it mattered most.
steelers,34jmnf,IdunnoLXG,1 point,Fri May 1 22:56:17 2015 UTC,He definitely got a TON of hate before he left the first time for sure.
steelers,34jmnf,FoxeRsmash,1 point,Fri May 1 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"He absolutely still catches hell.  People in this very sub talking about the steelers being in trouble if we come out of this draft and he's a starting corner.  My eye test says he earned a the starting spot and I completely agree he played his butt off last season.  You did forget to mention heyward, Harrison, keisel, even moats who I think is really flying under the radar.  We may end up PJ Williams at this point."
steelers,34jmnf,Rorbotron,1 point,Sat May 2 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"Very good reasoning. Considering the Browns and Bengals will easily be dominated with this strategy, along with several other teams on our schedule, I'm all for it."
steelers,34jmnf,Synectics,6,Fri May 1 21:57:52 2015 UTC,"Since the Titans have Dick Lebeau, does anyone think they might take  one of our players in addition to draft picks? Like maybe our 2nd,5th, and Sean Spence?"
steelers,34jmnf,vadeebo,3,Fri May 1 20:29:37 2015 UTC,"That actually makes a lot of sense, we certainly have a bit of an excess when it comes to middle linebackers. I wouldn't love seeing one of them leave but we can't start all 4."
steelers,34jmnf,TechnoViking94,3,Fri May 1 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"Fuck it! Let's draft Heath's replacement and hope that Cortez turns it around like Ike T did. A 100% Cortez, William Gay, and Blake Rake won't be too bad if our front 7 starts kicking ass."

I don't believe they would have to give up their third to move up and we could grab a corner in the 3rd.

steelers,34jmnf,Wvu17,3,Fri May 1 18:46:40 2015 UTC,Who said a 6th round pick?  I definitely didn't but its not gonna cost our third.
steelers,34jmnf,Rorbotron,7,Fri May 1 18:47:24 2015 UTC,Just going off trade value chart which isn't a set in stone value chart but is pretty reliable to trade up to pick 33-37 it would take a second and 3rd for equal value. Pick 33 would cost us 55 87 and still be about 100 point short of equal value    Edit 56 pick
steelers,34jmnf,Wvu17,2,Fri May 1 18:49:45 2015 UTC,Yea that's a lot.  I guess it depends on how much they like Williams.  He's going to be a very stout tight end.  Our offense will also be set for the rest of Bens career.  Who knows BUT it did just make the rest of the day a little better.  I like this sort of buzz on draft day. It would be a bold move.

steelers,34jmnf,PomfAndCircvmstance,12,Fri May 1 19:05:56 2015 UTC,Antonio Brown doing Antonio Brown things with Martavis Bryant blowing the top off the defense and with Miller and Williams working the middle of the field and with Bell coming out of the backfield would be pretty much impossible to stop.
steelers,34jmnf,KanyeWest_GayFish,10,Fri May 1 19:11:25 2015 UTC,And Wheaton getting it when none of them are open. I like it!

steelers,34jmnf,KanyeWest_GayFish,2,Fri May 1 19:38:31 2015 UTC,Of course! I just don't think its fair to Heath to assume he can't play most downs. Especially considering how important he is to our run game.

steelers,34jmnf,Ozz87,2,Fri May 1 18:53:12 2015 UTC,I wouldn't like this at all. We need corner help way too badly to trade up for a TE. Draft that kid from Ohio State later in the draft.

steelers,34jmnf,AlbirdEinstein,1 point,Fri May 1 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"Lol no, it would be a 2016 1st, 2015 4th minimum of it were a future pick. No way they take a future 2nd for what is essentially a 1st round pick"
steelers,34jmnf,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Fri May 1 22:02:13 2015 UTC,Cool. Then don't do it.
steelers,34jmnf,Rorbotron,2,Fri May 1 22:12:04 2015 UTC,The Jets could also be interested in trading down as they only have 5 picks but several needs.  They have the 5th pick in the second.
steelers,34jmnf,yinzer21,2,Fri May 1 19:19:07 2015 UTC,"Ugh I don't like this. They need to address the secondary in the second round.  I don't care how good your pass rush is if your cornerbacks are Gay, Blake, and Allen."
steelers,34jmnf,foot56,2,Fri May 1 19:55:01 2015 UTC,They are targeting Collins anyone want to bet :)
steelers,34jmnf,tolas,1 point,Fri May 1 20:26:20 2015 UTC,Which Collins?
steelers,34jmnf,anotheroutlaw,1 point,Fri May 1 21:43:47 2015 UTC,"This is my thought as well.  Williams is just a decoy...Steelers can't believe Collins is there.  Plus, we traded down for Troy oh so many years ago."
steelers,34jmnf,EPluribusUnumIdiota,2,Fri May 1 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"Maxx Williams is my only ""okay, go get him"" left on the board, dude looks to be solid for a decade at TE, but we don't need him...just yet.  I'd still make the move though if it can be done without giving up too much.  TE is so important in our system and he fits our mold.  Still, we need some freakin decent secondary, Jesus, I'm tired of closing my eyes every time the opponent goes to pass!"
steelers,34jmnf,rhino43grr,2,Fri May 1 20:48:45 2015 UTC,"NFL Live @NFLLive The @TennesseeTitans get: 2nd (40), 4th (108) and 7th (245) The @Giants get 2nd (33)"
steelers,34jmnf,purpl3_dinosaur,3,Fri May 1 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"Draft Randall Gregory. Guy was considered a top 10 talent before he tested positive for marihuana, add another young versatile linebacker to our defense. I know we don't need another OLB after getting Bud, but I wouldn't be mad if they grabbed Gregory at this point in the draft."
steelers,34jmnf,SleestakLightning,3,Fri May 1 19:30:05 2015 UTC,He has other off-field issues that teams are scared of.
steelers,34jmnf,jwt155,1 point,Fri May 1 19:38:22 2015 UTC,A team can be scared and not willing to take a player first round (sending messages that you don't care about their past issues) but decide to take the player later on.
steelers,34jmnf,SleestakLightning,1 point,Fri May 1 19:43:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that team likely isn't going to trade up to draft the guy. Especially when he plays the same exact position that they just drafted the day before."
steelers,34jmnf,jwt155,1 point,Fri May 1 20:02:22 2015 UTC,"The Steelers, sure. I'm just trying to say teams aren't willing to make a first round statement pick with a player of his history, but after the first round of passing all bets are off."
steelers,34jmnf,SleestakLightning,1 point,Fri May 1 20:10:48 2015 UTC,I think it would be a stretch to take him in Round 2 as well but we'll see. Someone might.
steelers,34jmnf,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Fri May 1 20:47:36 2015 UTC,"Even if not for the serious character concerns taking Gregory when they've already got four OLBs on the roster (Dupree, Moats, Jarvis, Harrison) would be a luxury pick which wouldn't make sense for a team that has several other needs (CB, Safety depth, TE, D-line depth) that need to be addressed."

steelers,34jmnf,B_Witt,1 point,Fri May 1 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"Didn't someone say the first offensive player drafted would be a WR? Strong is the only guy left I'd pick. Probably wouldn't move up that high for a TE. CB is a possibility,  especially if we gotta give up a 3rd to move up (wouldn't be able to get a CB in the third if we use it to trade up)"
steelers,34jmnf,codyrl95,1 point,Fri May 1 21:33:39 2015 UTC,Not sure I believe it. Steelers aren't the type to try their luck on stuff like this.
steelers,34jmnf,TunaNoCrust412,1 point,Fri May 1 21:46:46 2015 UTC,I just read from Bob labriola and he's actually apart of the steelers and writes for them. He says the team is trying to get into the top 10 picks to get a player they desire. I also heard at the combine that Williams is full of himself so I'm not sure if I want him. But anyways I think if they trade up its for Jalen Collins or Eric Rowe.. The price is what though?
steelers,34jmnf,rhino43grr,1 point,Fri May 1 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"Moving up 23 spots?  Too rich for my blood, and I don't even know what they'd be giving up to do it."
steelers,34jmnf,MiddleSidePunk,1 point,Fri May 1 23:01:58 2015 UTC,Giants just traded for it.
steelers,34jmnf,social_psycho,1 point,Fri May 1 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"We need to draft at least 2 CBs in this draft. I'm more than fine with the 1st rd  BPA, but I hate this move if they do it."

Which was extremely little, due to his injury and then moving to PS. I'd like to at least see him more this preseason and maybe even in the regular season."
steelers,34lwcz,JonVig,10,Sat May 2 10:10:50 2015 UTC,Steelers cut him loose last season. Chiefs just did the same as well. http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/04/21/chiefs-waive-2014-steelers-fifth-round-pick-shaquille-richardson/
steelers,34lwcz,Kodyak77,1 point,Sat May 2 10:49:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, no way. I thought he was still with us. That sucks, I was hoping he could help us turn the secondary around."
steelers,34lwcz,JonVig,1 point,Sat May 2 15:57:11 2015 UTC,"Haha yea funny story. I saw him waiting at my gate at the airport last week (Pittsburgh to California - he's from Carson, CA). I was gonna go up to him and wish him luck taking Ike's spot, but thankfully I did a quick google search first."
steelers,34lwcz,Kodyak77,1 point,Sat May 2 16:57:52 2015 UTC,I hope he is. That's exactly how i fell about him aswell! I'd really like to see what he's capable of doing.

steelers,34kack,doctor_ben,5,Sat May 2 00:57:32 2015 UTC,Eh. They don't really have any TEs after Pitta who seems to be constantly hurt.
steelers,34kack,jrile,14,Sat May 2 01:15:26 2015 UTC,If the Steelers trade up it had better be to take Eric Rowe.
steelers,34kack,Ogaminator,7,Fri May 1 22:18:49 2015 UTC,or Jalen Collins.

steelers,34kack,Anticipator1234,7,Sat May 2 02:53:45 2015 UTC,I'm hearing some rumors of U.S. trading up for Maxx Williams or a CB. I'd be very happy if either of those happened. Excited to see who we get because chances are they'll be a starter.

steelers,34kack,Intropy_,2,Fri May 1 23:42:05 2015 UTC,I hear ya. But Harrison will play his last season this year. We'd have a possible new steel curtain for the next few years with him and Dupree mentored by the Silverback. He keeps free falling but he's too much of a beast to fall to the third.

steelers,34kack,EricCantonaTheGOAT,4,Sat May 2 02:33:11 2015 UTC,Any idea what's up with Clemmings?
steelers,34kack,wishesgrantd,4,Sat May 2 02:35:32 2015 UTC,Doran Grant still on the board?

steelers,34kack,Verksus67,4,Sat May 2 02:43:00 2015 UTC,GIVE US ALL THE RECIEVERS
steelers,34kack,IdunnoLXG,6,Sat May 2 02:52:25 2015 UTC,Was there no one better at that spot? Not saying it was a bad pick but we don't have a need at WR. I know I know BPA but really?
steelers,34kack,Swazi,4,Sat May 2 02:57:17 2015 UTC,Besides the fact that we dont need him he seems  like at great value.
steelers,34kack,Swazi,8,Sat May 2 03:00:57 2015 UTC,If we get another midget corner in this draft I'm going to scream.
steelers,34kack,TheSaltbird,7,Sat May 2 00:59:09 2015 UTC,Maxx Williams can't block for shit. You think that's what Bell needs when Heath leaves?? Think guys THINK. Even when we got Spaeth to be a goal line target it was done in good faith that he'll block down in the red zone when need be.
steelers,34kack,Swazi,6,Sat May 2 01:02:03 2015 UTC,I like how the first highlight they show of him is missing tackles on TJ Yeldon.

steelers,34kack,MalnutritionUSA,3,Sat May 2 00:54:02 2015 UTC,I am thinking ti will be Baltimore. With Pittas injury history.

steelers,34kack,MalnutritionUSA,3,Fri May 1 23:04:03 2015 UTC,Trade Alert!  Giants moved up. I''m glad because I did not want the Steelers to spend what they would have had to to get to #33.
steelers,34kack,Swazi,3,Fri May 1 23:09:43 2015 UTC,Giants trade into the top pick of the round. I can see them taking Maxx Williams.
steelers,34kack,Intropy_,3,Fri May 1 23:09:48 2015 UTC,I have a feeling there is going to be a run on DBs in this round and we might have to move up a few spots if we want a particular guy.
steelers,34kack,Intropy_,3,Fri May 1 23:12:19 2015 UTC,Raiders are gonna steal Gregory after passing on Williams
steelers,34kack,Flexidry_,3,Fri May 1 23:19:50 2015 UTC,Good pick by Chicago.
steelers,34kack,Diarygirl,2,Fri May 1 23:44:45 2015 UTC,"Agree. He's one of a small handful of guys I would take over ""best remaining CB.""  And no I'm not down on, McLendon of McCullers. I just like Goldman and think it's good value."
steelers,34kack,Day_n_Night,3,Fri May 1 23:46:23 2015 UTC,Damn. Jalen Collins just taken.

steelers,34kack,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 00:28:57 2015 UTC,"I really hope that the Steelers take Gregory...  I know he has bad problems, but with Harrison and Porter, I think that he could be a real big steal."
steelers,34kack,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 00:29:54 2015 UTC,"That would basically say we are abandoning Jarvis, who I still believe will be a great player in the near future"

steelers,34kack,Intropy_,3,Sat May 2 00:33:13 2015 UTC,Bouchette is starting to hype up Maxx Williams's Pittsburgh pedigree a bit.  Making me think he will be our pick if he is still there.
steelers,34kack,Bohunk,3,Sat May 2 00:32:39 2015 UTC,"Ew.  A guard?  I feel KC could've gotten that a lot later.  EDIT: ESPNs draft lsit has him as a guard, apparently he is a center though."
steelers,34kack,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 00:36:45 2015 UTC,I think that's a big reach.
steelers,34kack,BarryBadrinath151,3,Sat May 2 00:37:38 2015 UTC,"Booo, another CB gone."
steelers,34kack,jeff89jdf,3,Sat May 2 00:40:51 2015 UTC,"I was never very high on Ronald Darby. But it wasn't until just now that I realized why. I don't like his name.  It's not how he plays, or where he plays, or something he said. It's something he has no control over. His name. I don't even know why. Rondald, fine first name. Darby, fine last name. Ronald Darby, stupid name.   I'll see myself out now."
steelers,34kack,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 00:44:52 2015 UTC,"Browns are making too many good moves.  I like every pick they made, and the trade."

steelers,34kack,gimpisgawd,4,Sat May 2 00:47:18 2015 UTC,Older brother is a Browns fan.  Can confirm.
steelers,34kack,Verksus67,3,Sat May 2 00:49:04 2015 UTC,"Dammit, That was a good pick!"
steelers,34kack,lMobzTa,3,Sat May 2 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"So the NFL network broadcast is better than ESPN this year, but I keep laughing at the field reporters bad logic. First, MJD Flip-Flopping on Byron Jones yesterday after saying Steelers should take him. Second ,the Bearded dude saying Jameis will be a runner in fantasy football. Did the guys watch FSU at all? HAHAHA"

steelers,34kack,BobbyD84,3,Sat May 2 01:05:16 2015 UTC,I like this pick.
steelers,34kack,mojavespirit,3,Sat May 2 01:05:35 2015 UTC,"Well, our first round pick was maybe one of the best in that round so I guess a miss is ok right?  :("
steelers,34kack,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 01:06:03 2015 UTC,I like that they said he is a interceprion machine... we need that!!
steelers,34kack,TheLastStarFighter,7,Sat May 2 01:06:38 2015 UTC,Did you see the fucking highlights? Every INT was just a terrible pass by the QB. AWFUL.
steelers,34kack,creepypaster,6,Sat May 2 01:07:46 2015 UTC,So he will be great against Andy dalton...
steelers,34kack,mojavespirit,3,Sat May 2 01:08:46 2015 UTC,Exactly.
steelers,34kack,Diarygirl,3,Sat May 2 01:09:25 2015 UTC,Great. We drafted Juan Pierre.
steelers,34kack,Verksus67,3,Sat May 2 01:06:43 2015 UTC,Wouldn't mind Ifo if he's there in round 3.
steelers,34kack,akmalhot,3,Sat May 2 01:09:24 2015 UTC,"He's a ballhawk, sure, but his size worries the shit out of me.  Good luck tackling AJ Green."
steelers,34kack,sw337,4,Sat May 2 01:10:19 2015 UTC,If he can play in heels we are set!
steelers,34kack,wishesgrantd,3,Sat May 2 01:17:59 2015 UTC,"Damn, 5'8"" is pretty short - will he be more of a slot guy? Captain Munnerlyn is 5'7"" and he's pretty solid when in the slot"
steelers,34kack,DjBigRuss,6,Sat May 2 01:12:52 2015 UTC,Worst case he'd be a slot.  He's not unbelievably small though
steelers,34kack,wishesgrantd,3,Sat May 2 01:14:44 2015 UTC,"And he played baseball too, which tells me that he's multi-talented."
steelers,34kack,Intropy_,3,Sat May 2 01:19:52 2015 UTC,I would have been happier with drafting a left tackle or dropping back in the 2nd for a few more picks.

steelers,34kack,Diarygirl,3,Sat May 2 02:52:32 2015 UTC,Not bad.
steelers,34kack,MichelangeBro,3,Sat May 2 02:53:36 2015 UTC,He is like a less impressive Martavis Bryant. With Ifo on the board nonetheless.
steelers,34kack,MalnutritionUSA,3,Sat May 2 02:57:31 2015 UTC,"Really? I dunno about that. He's shorter, but just as fast, stronger, more physical, uses his hands more than I've seen Martavis.  I think he looks great for a 3rd round pick."
steelers,34kack,DeuxBoy,3,Sat May 2 03:17:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  On Coates' NFL.com Combine profile, they say he is comparable to......Martavis Bryant.  Ran a 4.43 40 (Amari Cooper ran a 4.42 40), and was a top performer among WRs in the bench press, vertical jump, broad jump, and 20 yard shuttle.  Edit:  He tied for first in the bench press.  Tied for fourth in the vertical jump.  Third in the broad jump.  Second in the 20 yard shuttle only behind Amari Cooper.  The guy has the physical/athletic tools to be a first/second round pick."
steelers,34kack,simmonsb,3,Sat May 2 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"yea just had a high drop rate, but I like the point that Auburn never really threw consistently so it would be hard to have a good rhythm in that offense."
steelers,34kack,Verksus67,5,Sat May 2 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"5'8""?!?!?!?!?!?  He can cover Dri Archer, I guess.  Fuck  edit Archer would blow his doors off... never mind"
steelers,34kack,BEGA500,6,Sat May 2 01:06:03 2015 UTC,what in the fuck is that shit.  You simply can't be 5'9 to play corner in NFL...
steelers,34kack,LarkInmyGoKart,5,Sat May 2 01:08:04 2015 UTC,Everybody was crying for us to draft a CB and now they're furious.  I have to believe that the FO knows what they're doing.
steelers,34kack,PhantomJB93,3,Sat May 2 01:21:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that I'm not going to question Colbert before I see a bit of Golson in the NFL, but people are upset because of the 5'8, not because of the position."
steelers,34kack,DoctorShlomo,4,Sat May 2 01:27:34 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one not excited about Maxx? His measurables didn't impress me, he just looks to be a solid strong receiver, something we already have in Miller who still has a lot left in him.  I'm all for a TE, but as our #2 pick? Nobody here can say TE is even on the same level of need as a CB/S is"

steelers,34kack,Swazi,3,Sat May 2 01:05:06 2015 UTC,Im guessing our pick is weird and ridiculous. Something that makes no sense and that none of us have mentioned.
steelers,34lfvw,simmonsb,3,Sat May 2 05:00:18 2015 UTC,Randy gregory slid because of personal issues. Peters is likely a top 10 pick without his personal issues. Shane ray almost slid to the second and La'el Collins hasnt even been drafted yet. Its all about a teams perception on whether the reward is greater than the risk. Every team knows it. They took several questionable characters in 2012 and it burned them.
steelers,34lfvw,ColdNose,1 point,Sat May 2 05:14:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but if La'el hits the fifth round and no one took, I say we bite on the gamble. We'd have pretty much a perfect offense. Hard to look away from that."
steelers,34lfvw,zjrk,5,Sat May 2 05:35:19 2015 UTC,"La'El's agent said yesterday that if he wasn't drafted Friday night, that he would sit out next season, and re-enter the draft next year.  I have to imagine he isn't even an option at this point."
steelers,34lfvw,RenderedInGooseFat,2,Sat May 2 13:01:30 2015 UTC,I thought you couldn't do that for whatever reason? Or he was going to be barred or whatever?
steelers,34lfvw,zjrk,2,Sat May 2 17:52:30 2015 UTC,"NFL announced this morning that they wouldn't let him sit out, and re-enter the draft.  You are supposed to be able to refuse to sign, and have your rights go back into the draft the next year though, like Bo Jackson did."
steelers,34lfvw,RenderedInGooseFat,2,Sat May 2 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"Huh, good look. TIL."

Each team had it's own booth, which seemed like the teams locker room, but some teams had players do signings and cheerleaders taking pictures.

It seems like every year, great prospects slip in the draft and fall into Pittsburgh's lap. I thought it was going to be Shane Ray or Randy Gregory, but it turned out to be another pass-rusher. Alvin Dupree was getting top-10 buzz prior to the draft. I thought that was a bit too high for him, but I figured the No. 13 spot was the right area for him. I thought the Saints would pick him when they were on the clock, but apparently not. Dupree has tremendous upside and should provide a big boost in terms of getting to the quarterback.

steelers,34h3x2,Juventus19,6,Fri May 1 02:38:16 2015 UTC,Also there is no reason Harrison should not be hired as a strength coach or something after this year.
steelers,34h3x2,Vincent__Vega,-6,Fri May 1 14:52:57 2015 UTC,Just because a guy is freakishly strong doesn't qualify him as being a good strength coach. Harrison does what he's told in the gym. He probably couldn't tell you the first thing about programming

steelers,34h3x2,STLR043,2,Fri May 1 18:55:21 2015 UTC,I've been powerlifting competitively for years and can talk for hours about my own workout. That doesn't even begin to qualify me to program workouts for other professional athletes
steelers,34h3x2,dirtmcgirt412,3,Fri May 1 18:57:14 2015 UTC,"A) You don't know that anything you've said is true. B) He said ""or something"" and was obviously implying he should be a part of the coaching staff in some way. IE: Joey Porter situation?"
steelers,34h3x2,BillyMurderface,0,Fri May 1 16:56:20 2015 UTC,Joey Porter can coach linebackers because he's actually been a professional linebacker. James Harrison has never been a professional strength and conditioning coach. The amount of education you need to fill that role is more than years of gym time accumulated
steelers,34h3x2,dirtmcgirt412,2,Fri May 1 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"I understand that. I don't think that guy is suggesting that he is the dictionary of strength training.

steelers,34h3x2,BillyMurderface,1 point,Fri May 1 03:35:56 2015 UTC,Jones does really make me nervous. It seems like he could be really boom/bust at this point given his pick.
steelers,34h3x2,Rorbotron,2,Fri May 1 16:59:02 2015 UTC,"Why does this get posted all the time?  If its not here, its on my primary steeler board.  Its not the whole fan base but there is certainly a small contingent that only seems capable of casting a negative light on Jones.  Let's look at the facts.   Rookies almost never have an impact in dick lebeau defensive scheme.  Jarvis Jones was tasked to start because worilds hadn't shown a thing.  Jarvis gets benched, worilds starts and has a nice season.   The last defensive rookie before him to start was kendrell bell. (I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure) Sophomore season Jones breaks his wrist and misses a majority of the season.   Its a pretty damn simple breakdown but by my own two eyes it seems Jones hasn't had the opportunity to show if he's going to be great/good/servicible or terrible.  Yet people continue to label him as a bust.  Why not let the guy come in this season and maybe prove his draft position.  How many picks have the steelers missed on in lets say the last 20 years in the first round?  All I have is Ziggy Hood.  I remember a time when polamalu was bustamalu, when timmons carried the bust label and most recently Cameron heyward before he exploded on the scene conicidently in year three.  Jarvis catches a lot of irrational shit and maybe its because we as Pittsburgh fans are spoiled rotten.  Instant gratification.  Let's give Jarvis Jones a break.  Anyone doing anything different is being irrational."
steelers,34h3x2,huet99,1 point,Fri May 1 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"Defensive players dont have good production in Lebeau's scheme. They do, however, show signs of promise (Tuitt is a good example). Jarvis Jones didn't look like the player he was supposed to be coming out of college, and looked okay at the start of last season, but still not great."
steelers,34h3x2,Rorbotron,1 point,Fri May 1 19:44:06 2015 UTC,I guess maybe you didn't read he was a rookie and then lost his sophmore season to a wrist injury?

steelers,34h3x2,Sex_E_Searcher,5,Fri May 1 03:34:26 2015 UTC,Most young pass-rushers come in with few moves.  It's developing them that determines if they'll sink or swim.
steelers,34h3x2,gettingyelledat,10,Fri May 1 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that he needs to start using his hands. He can't just rely on his speed to get sacks. However, when he gets more techniques down, he has the potential to be a premier pass rusher"
steelers,34h3x2,huet99,6,Fri May 1 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. I guess I just really wanted Shane Ray, because I think he is going to be a fantastic player, even though Steelers fans don't agree."
steelers,34h3x2,IdunnoLXG,2,Fri May 1 02:49:13 2015 UTC,I agree with you because I've heard he's a bit stiff. Luckily I have faith in our coaches.
steelers,34h3x2,MichelangeBro,2,Fri May 1 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"Not concerned with it. He's an edge rusher. He's so fast and explosive that he gets into the backfield. He's also a much surer tackler than Ray is which is what we needed more than anything. If we can't have a good secondary fine, we need a guy who can get us tackles and penetration and Dupree does exactly that."
steelers,34h3x2,Sav23,1 point,Fri May 1 03:22:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not enough people are mentioning this. Watching his tape, he is a fantastic tackler. Wide arms, wraps them up, takes them down. I am happy with him for that alone."

steelers,34h3x2,Drakengard,1 point,Fri May 1 03:31:42 2015 UTC,"His technique is weak, but once it gets polished he's going to be insanely difficult to beat. Also, the way Kentucky used him he is very comfortable filling is as a line backer because of his crazy closing speed."
steelers,34h3x2,Saintzillla,10,Fri May 1 03:35:54 2015 UTC,"So damn excited.  I just can't believe he's 6' 4"" 269 lbs.  Dude is a athletic freak of nature and I can't wait to see him develop."

steelers,34h3x2,Ajax_Malone,2,Fri May 1 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty excited about the pick.  He was my 3rd EDGE guy who in every mock I did was gone by NO at 13, so there's good value there on my board--especially given that the only 3 DBs I valued at that range were gone by 18.  His athleticism is top notch, he has a ton of experience in the SEC against top quality opposition.  He is a great character guy, puts in the work in the weight and film room, and is a leader.  He's not a home run by any stretch though.  He's got lots of holes in his technique, and the short length of his arms and occasionally playing too tall/stiff have all been documented.  Dude is just plain raw and even in the SEC he all too often relied on athleticism which showed a ton of holes in his technique on tape.  However, when converting a DE to a 3-4 OLB, the biggest problem is teaching them how to drop into a zone and to understand coverage and space.  Most of these edge rushers are used to rushing from a 3 point stance and not having to do zone drops or coverage.  Of all the edge rushers, Dupree has spent the most time in coverage and with his 4.54 speed he becomes a multifaceted tool that doesn't need to come off the field in nickel packages.  He also is above average in instinct and pursuit in the open field.  He takes good lines, and lays wood when he gets there.  He's going to need to be coached up pretty heavily in order to be successful in the NFL in both run and pass rush technique.  As /u/PomfAndCircvmstance points out he's a bit of a project, but he's got undeniable upside."
steelers,34h3x2,oompahlumpa,2,Fri May 1 17:19:06 2015 UTC,Can't believe how great of a fit and pick this is. You bastards just drafted a 6'4'' 270 OLB that was fast enough to play coverage against slot WRs in college. Very envious of this pick. Perfect fit.
steelers,34h3x2,meowdy,1 point,Fri May 1 13:42:45 2015 UTC,"I cant believe that the 22nd pick we stole this OLB! The only other OLB that went before us was Vic Beasley to the falcons. I think once Dupree gets to training camp and we get him learning to wrap his arms around his targets he could be a very valuable asset to our defense! Round 1 down, now lets try to steal a CB or SS =)"

steelers,34iymw,Swazi,1 point,Fri May 1 22:02:50 2015 UTC,I really hope Washington pulls off the trade then...
steelers,34iymw,seanburnsred,5,Fri May 1 22:17:31 2015 UTC,I've got a gut feeling TE is going to be the pick (most likely Clive Walford) in the 2nd and a bunch of Steelers fans will cry doom and gloom over it. Fortunately I think there'll be some pretty solid 3rd round corners so I'm not terribly worried.
steelers,34iymw,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Fri May 1 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be completely opposed to a TE in the second.  I would prefer a corner, but I can see the value in adding a TE early also.  I don't think anything on offense is close to being as big a need as corner is though."
steelers,34iymw,Rorbotron,6,Fri May 1 17:18:03 2015 UTC,When does everyone expect la'el Collins to get drafted?  You have to assume every team in the league has someone investigating it.  Preliminary reports said the police don't have him listed as a suspect.  I've gotta think if he were a suspect or a possible suspect he'd have been yanked already but they are letting it ride until after the draft.  Its gonna be interesting.
steelers,34iymw,Rorbotron,6,Fri May 1 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"I think he is more involved than the police are letting on.  It seems like if he wasn't a suspect, and the cops had zero interest in him in that regard, teams would be able to find out, and he would go fairly high.  If the cops do have some interest, I don't think he would go until the 7th, or undrafted."
steelers,34iymw,Rorbotron,2,Fri May 1 17:14:28 2015 UTC,If he's more than a suspect why not have him in for questioning now?  As if stands if he's found to not be involved and he goes undrafted the police have really messed with his life.  He was consensus first round before this and labeled by many as one of the safest picks  in the draft.  I hope for the sake of the kid and the sake of the NFL teams someone gets it figured out soon.
steelers,34iymw,sw337,2,Fri May 1 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"Could be doing more investigating, and evidence gathering, before they bring him in.  I saw some speculation that he may have been the father of the woman's child, and that is what all of this is about, but a paternity test would have taken minutes, and cleared his name of wrongdoing.  I feel like his draft position will tell us a lot.  If he goes in the second, then maybe it is nothing, and teams just valued him less than the media.  If he goes in the 7th, or undrafted, then either the cops are being incredibly tight lipped, teams aren't doing their due diligence, or the cops believe he may be involved in some way.  Everything is speculation right now though."
steelers,34iymw,B_Witt,2,Fri May 1 17:21:46 2015 UTC,Yea I agree.  Its pretty crazy.  Here is to hoping for his sake and the now born possible son he wasn't involved.
steelers,34iymw,justintree77,2,Fri May 1 17:23:21 2015 UTC,Hernandez wasn't a suspect early.
steelers,34iymw,Rorbotron,2,Fri May 1 18:46:26 2015 UTC,Aaron Hernandez was only a person of interest to start too
steelers,34iymw,slicehix,2,Fri May 1 17:52:58 2015 UTC,I have no idea. But I'd love him in the 4rth or 5th. Finding an impact player their is unlikely. Even if Collins is guilty we font lose much and we might steal a good tackle on a really small contract.
steelers,34iymw,FightingCoopers,2,Fri May 1 18:55:39 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  I think its worth the risk if the team does their due diligence.  He's a tremendous talent.
steelers,34iymw,White_Bread21,5,Fri May 1 18:57:12 2015 UTC,"Like probably everyone else who will comment, I want a corner in round 2.  I am hoping someone like Darby from FSU falls to us.  Round 3, I want a TE, if the value is there, or another DB."
steelers,34iymw,ColdNose,5,Fri May 1 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be mad at Darby or Williams in the 2nd (though I think Williams is a little too grabby and will probably be flagged like a mofo in the NFL), and Ifo in the 3rd."
steelers,34iymw,PomfAndCircvmstance,4,Fri May 1 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"I'm liking Eric Rowe and expect him to fall. He's tall, quick, and big enough to compete with the larger receivers in the league. We don't necessarily need a shut down corner because of the nature of our zone blitz defense, so I feel that he'll be more than serviceable at corner back.   Now on a more serious note, what are some good names for our defense? I like Flex Luthor for Shazier, Dredd/Sheriff for Lawrence Timmons, Dawg Bones Jones for Jarvis, and I have hard time thinking of something for Dupree (DP?). As an unit, I have no clue but it should be different from Blitzburgh and Steel Curtain."
steelers,34iymw,FightingCoopers,4,Fri May 1 18:15:25 2015 UTC,I'd be happy with an Alex Carter and Steven Nelson combo today.

steelers,34iymw,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Fri May 1 15:52:02 2015 UTC,Can I just say that while the Browns disappointed yesterday by actually making decent picks it was nice to see the Bengals and Ravens pick up the slack by reaching on an injured OT with strength issues and a receiver who runs terrible routes and can't catch? I was sure that the Bengals were taking Dupree at #21 and I was very confident that Byron Jones was going to the Ravens at #26.  edit: Bonus Bud Dupree rookie card from The Draw Play.
steelers,34iymw,KanyeWest_GayFish,1 point,Fri May 1 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"Only thing I'm concerned about is Joe Flacco chucking it deep to Perriman and getting a PI, similar to how they used Torrey Smith."
steelers,34iymw,Cthemacdaddy,1 point,Fri May 1 18:25:40 2015 UTC,"I think the Ravens made a great pick for the type of game they play. I think the Browns picks were lackluster - a guard and nose tackle may turn the corner from 7-9 to 8-8, but not much more."
steelers,34iymw,kingpatzer,1 point,Fri May 1 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"Literally the only thing Perriman can do is run go routes. His route running, lateral agility, and hands are all mediocre. Given who they could have landed (Byron Jones,  Phillip Dorsett, Jalean Strong, Ronald Darby) I'm thrilled they took the DHB of a new generation.  Nobody the Browns could have taken with those picks would turn the team around over night but both guys they got figure to be long term starters on the lines. Everybody gets excited about flashy receivers but you win games in the trenches. Seems the Browns finally figured that out."
steelers,34iymw,meowdy,3,Fri May 1 21:11:56 2015 UTC,Now time to stock up on defensive backs and a tight end.
steelers,34iymw,The_YoungWolf,3,Fri May 1 18:55:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need to shoot for a TE right away. We really need to focus on Defense (DB or even a OLB).

steelers,34iymw,Day_n_Night,2,Fri May 1 20:50:39 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see us trade up in this round for Gregory, Collins or Darby.  I know it is not likely to happen, but honestly, Dupree + one of those guys would go a long way to fixing the D issues."
steelers,34iymw,kitchenmaniac111,2,Fri May 1 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like we will go some combination of CB and CB/TE/WR at 2 and 3. Any dark horse picks?  I think if TJ Clemmings falls and there is a run on corners, he wouldn't be a bad 2nd round pick. Mike Adams may be gone after this year and we are very thin on the line. Can't see us taking another linebacker today, wouldn't rule out safety, would rule out qb and rb today. Would be surprised at a dlineman, but we are thin there too so I wouldn't rule it out if thats the way the board played out."

steelers,34jkh1,RenderedInGooseFat,5,Fri May 1 18:29:58 2015 UTC,Thanks this point in the draft the visit list for the steelers seems to be a good indicator of the possible picks.
steelers,34i9r0,steelbydesign,8,Fri May 1 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it'd be a good idea to take a red-zone receiver that early without seeing how Bryant develops his hands. It'd be a wasted pick if it turns out we have it already. That being said, I'd love Maxx in the 2nd."
steelers,34i9r0,yeshua1986,1 point,Fri May 1 13:23:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed completely. Martavis develops a bit more and we will have a premier red zone threat.

steelers,34i9r0,Juventus19,3,Fri May 1 14:51:54 2015 UTC,"If Collins, Darby, or Rowe are available and that isn't the pick I will be really disappointed.  If they take a WR in the first 4 rounds I will be floored/furious. At this point no WR we draft is going to bet any playing time beyond ST for at least a couple of years."
steelers,34i9r0,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Fri May 1 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"At this point no WR we draft is going to bet any playing time beyond ST for at least a couple of years.   Not true. Wheaton hasn't proven anything and Heyward-Bey couldn't even beat out Lance Moore for playing time last year. Brown and to some extent Bryant are the only solid players at WR, there's certainly a need for a slot receiver if Wheaton busts.  That being said, I'd still rate it CB > TE > S > WR, but a 4th round WR could certainly beat out a backup safety pick."
steelers,34i9r0,tonytroz,2,Fri May 1 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"Fair I suppose, although I don't know that I see a WR that is talented enough to step in and be able to provide more than Wheaton right now, if only from the standpoint of not knowing the offense."
steelers,34i9r0,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Fri May 1 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't either, but you can't argue with the Steelers track record with middle round receivers ever since Mike Wallace."

steelers,34i9r0,shadowslayer978,2,Fri May 1 17:25:50 2015 UTC,Maxx most likely wont be there when the Steelers pick anyways.  But he is the perfect heir to Heath's throne though.
steelers,34i9r0,Swazi,1 point,Fri May 1 18:13:49 2015 UTC,probably not but it doesnt mean i wouldnt like to see him on the team
steelers,34i9r0,DirtyJerseyjumpshot,1 point,Fri May 1 17:37:53 2015 UTC,maxx williams    I'd like to see them snag a 2nd round CB and try to get Jesse James in the third. Maxx Williams is by far the best TE in the dreaft but it would definitely cost them their 3rd round pick. I'd be really uncomfortable with them not getting a corner in the first three rounds.
steelers,34i3aq,dangerm0use,11,Fri May 1 10:07:22 2015 UTC,It would be dumb to pass on the top guy left on your board because you drafted the same position in the first round 2 years ago.  Especially since he plays a different position than Jarvis and Shazier.
steelers,34i3aq,SleestakLightning,5,Fri May 1 15:36:20 2015 UTC,"I Dont think people really grasp our defense, the value of picks etc...  Yes we desperately need a cb, but that doesn't mean you go pick a guy not worthy of pick 22 value, esp when you can get guys that project to be startingbim the same time PD from the second round..  Yes there is the argument that if players aren't covered backers dont have time to get to the qb.. It be interesting to see how many passes < 2-3 sec vs how manybofnthe qb standing upright forever.. No matter how good ur dB's are they aren't going to consistently cover for 7+ seconds"
steelers,34i3aq,akmalhot,2,Fri May 1 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"You have to make a QB go to his second or third reads to get lots of sacks.  Certainly the pass rush helps the coverage and vice versa but just looking at the Steelers team right now, we need CB's to give the OLB's some time.    With that said, I'm thrilled about the Dupree pick, and we had to take him there. I think he has a higher ceiling and higher floor than  Jarvis, and I think he will be a star in this defense next year."
steelers,34i3aq,tolas,2,Fri May 1 17:33:24 2015 UTC,I agree totally which is why we need some db out of RDS 2-4..  We've now spent 3 first picks in a row on LB and all 4 were firsts.. They need to turn it into one of the best lb corps in the league  We've also spent 4 first rd picks on LBs..
steelers,34i3aq,akmalhot,1 point,Fri May 1 18:47:55 2015 UTC,Exactly. NFL offenses can scheme guys open. But if you get to the QB guys can be open as much as they want and you're still going to be okay.
steelers,34i3aq,SleestakLightning,8,Fri May 1 17:33:40 2015 UTC,"No joke... seems like a perfect fit. Besides, the quickest way to upgrade all of your defensive backs is to upgrade your pass rush."
steelers,34i3aq,batypus,6,Fri May 1 16:23:01 2015 UTC,"I love the Dupree pick, but no team will get sacks if the QB's first read is wide open.  I'm excited about the direct of this defense though.  I think we're going to be a lot better this year than people think.  I think Shazier is going to turn into a star this year."
steelers,34i3aq,tolas,2,Fri May 1 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"no team will get sacks if the QB's first read is wide open.   Agreed, but if the DBs are playing on the line with bump-and-run coverage, the WRs shouldn't be open for the first few seconds at least. We haven't been able to play that sort of coverage lately since the QB hasn't been pressured."
steelers,34i3aq,batypus,2,Fri May 1 17:45:30 2015 UTC,"I Dont think people really grasp our defense, the value of picks etc...

steelers,34i3aq,SleestakLightning,1 point,Fri May 1 18:30:07 2015 UTC,Perfectly stated.   Dupree was the absolute right pick given who was in the board.
steelers,34i3aq,fatguyinakilt,3,Sat May 2 14:56:17 2015 UTC,So I just came here to say that picking Bud Dupree was a stellar move by your organization. I've been a UK fan all my life and had a chance to be a strength and conditioning intern for UK when Stoops first arrived. No one worked harder than Dupree in the gym and he always put up big numbers. The guy is a freak of an athlete and a quality person too. He's going to give your team all he has and I wish nothing but the best for him....and this is all coming from a Bengals fan.
steelers,34i3aq,Flotter,-1,Fri May 1 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"I just don't know why we didn't get a great CB with Byron Jones when he was practically handed to us on a silver platter.   I like Dupree, the guy can definitely play and will hopefully do many good things for us. But we had the chance to take a tough, fast and physical CB and we passed him up."
steelers,34i3aq,cman412,6,Fri May 1 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"I just don't know why we didn't get a great CB with Byron Jones    Because he's not a great CB.   He was an Pretty decent CB who captured lightning in a bottle at the combine, causing everyone to overvalue him.    Find anyone who thought B Jones was an elite CB prior to his combine workout."
steelers,34i3aq,Working_Lurking,1 point,Fri May 1 19:02:09 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter who have have at corner if the qb has all day to throw
steelers,34i3aq,sweatytacos,-1,Fri May 1 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of ways to get players you want in the draft. Jarvis and Shazier will hopefully step it up a notch this year and look like Steeler linebackers.   I mean hell, trade a 6th and 7th round pick to get low 2nd round pick and pick up Dupree"
steelers,34i3aq,cman412,2,Fri May 1 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"Dupree wasn't getting far past us, Denver might have still traded up for him, and the Cardinals almost traded ahead of us to pick him, so they definitely would have taken him. Dupree is a much better value at 22, Byron Jones was expected to go in that 23-28 range, but Dupree was a 5 to 13 type of guy. We got really lucky."
steelers,34i3aq,NotJoeyWheeler,2,Fri May 1 18:55:52 2015 UTC,People thought dupree might get taken at 8 by Atlanta...
steelers,34i3aq,deverhartdu,1 point,Sat May 2 11:10:33 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I really like Byron Jones and I would have been ok with him if Dupree was already off the board.  However, there's not a draftnik or ex-GM around who didn't ahe Dupree graded higher.  LOLB and CB were the top needs. The difference between Dupree and a second round prospect (OO, Kikaha) is greater than the difference between Byron Jones and a Rowe, Carter, etc.   Also, I believe Jones had 7 starts as a CB."

steelers,34gfwr,sme42,6,Fri May 1 02:21:19 2015 UTC,One Dupree Please
steelers,34gfwr,DRU_leggo,4,Fri May 1 02:21:45 2015 UTC,I think we are going Dupree.  I like Gregory a little more though.

steelers,34gfwr,TheLastStarFighter,3,Fri May 1 02:31:34 2015 UTC,"I wanted Gregory, but I'll take Dupree. I'm just so glad they didn't take Landon Collins."

steelers,34gfwr,dmremic,4,Fri May 1 02:32:48 2015 UTC,I just wish we could have Dupuis too ;(
steelers,34gfwr,KingKablamo,3,Fri May 1 02:35:32 2015 UTC,Yeah..  Me too.
steelers,34l80f,Anticipator1234,10,Sat May 2 03:27:23 2015 UTC,"Dupree: A+ Can't believe he fell to us!  Golson: B Has a lot of up side, total ball hawk! Is a little short but I think his skills can make up for it. Really like this pick as well.  Coates: B- The value is there, he's a really good wide recover but he doesn't really fit our immediate needs. Still, I think he can develop into a really good player."
steelers,34l80f,A4thLineDuster7,3,Sat May 2 03:31:56 2015 UTC,"Can't agree with Golson... in the 4th round, maybe? You can't catch a ball you can't reach... he's under 5'9"" with a 33.5"" vertical."
steelers,34l80f,A4thLineDuster7,12,Sat May 2 03:35:20 2015 UTC,You're entitled to your opinion and I respect that. I gave him that grade cause I see a lot of upside to him. I think he could be a Brent Grimes type player. That's just my opinion though.
steelers,34l80f,Thor_of_brodinhiem,3,Sat May 2 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"If he had 4.3 speed and a 40"" vertical, I would be inclined to agree with you. We can only watch and wait... I am just not optimistic."
steelers,34l80f,Thor_of_brodinhiem,5,Sat May 2 03:47:21 2015 UTC,Him and Brent Grimes have the same 40 time and same vertical and are roughly an inch apart.
steelers,34l80f,bazzone,5,Sat May 2 04:56:49 2015 UTC,"If he turns it to a Grimes like player, great. However, Grimes was a UDFA!, not a second rounder."
steelers,34l80f,slicehix,1 point,Sat May 2 05:00:14 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to compare him to grimes, I just thought you were trying to say he had a 40"" vert and ran a 4.3 40."
steelers,34l80f,HopkinsFC,2,Sat May 2 05:26:55 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. What I meant was that if Golson had 4.3 speed and a 40"" vertical... I'd be fine with taking him in the 2nd round, despite his size disadvantage. As he is, I don't see him higher than a 4th rounder. Like I have said, I hope I am wrong."
steelers,34l80f,social_psycho,0,Sat May 2 06:17:39 2015 UTC,i forget what the term is but it seems like you are a bit too sold on combine stats... if the only things that matter were speed and vertical then heyward-bey would be one of the best receivers of all time.
steelers,34l80f,HopkinsFC,2,Sat May 2 06:07:52 2015 UTC,"The ability to catch is important for a receiver, as is the ability to tackle for a linebacker."
steelers,34l80f,Verksus67,4,Sat May 2 06:15:39 2015 UTC,"People need to stop stressing about his combine vert. Brent Grimes is 5'9"" and had a 33.5 vert at his pro day and is capable of doing shit like this: http://i.imgur.com/feNsPet.png"
steelers,34l80f,DriArcher,-5,Sat May 2 03:44:23 2015 UTC,"Stopping a poorly thrown ball to Megatron? If that's a jump ball (i.e. well thrown), Grimes is on his ass and Johnson is in the endzone."
steelers,34l80f,Verksus67,3,Sat May 2 03:45:56 2015 UTC,"Good thing we have a front 7 of 1st and 2nd round picks then that will cause even the best QB's into quick and off balance throws on the run.  Not to mention Dalton, Flaaco and Brown's QB of the weak aren't exactly known for their pinpoint accuracy."
steelers,34l80f,DriArcher,0,Sat May 2 03:53:40 2015 UTC,And that will get us into the playoffs where we will consistently lose to teams who have a QB that can dink and dunk. If the ball is leaving the QB's hands within a second or so our pass rush is neutralized. And they WILL get those 5-7 yard routes throwing to their reciecers that are half a foot taller than our DBs.
steelers,34l80f,Verksus67,1 point,Sat May 2 07:09:22 2015 UTC,Dink and dunk isn't run with 6'4 or 6'5 WR's. If they dink and dunk Shazier and Dupree are two of the fastest LB's in the NFL.
steelers,34l80f,DriArcher,1 point,Sat May 2 14:20:12 2015 UTC,You might as well stop. Apparently thinking someone's height might hinder a player some is a disgusting thought in this thread. Just let it pay out and hope we're wrong.
steelers,34l80f,Verksus67,3,Sat May 2 03:55:03 2015 UTC,So? He's the same size as antwon Blake. Bent grimes is short too and he's incredible. Height means shit.
steelers,34l80f,DriArcher,-3,Sat May 2 03:39:41 2015 UTC,"Height doesn't mean shit? Your right, that's why ""ideal position height"" doesn't really mean anything in the NFL. I mean, there's obviously a lot more short cbs being picked first in the draft/pro bowls every year. No, height is very important. Sorry to burst your bubble.   Do I think he can develop? Sure. But you can't honestly believe without fooling yourself that height Isent important in the NFL. If you do? I have some choice property to sell you in nigeria."
steelers,34l80f,Verksus67,-1,Sat May 2 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think height is as important as you're saying.   Like I said, brent grimes."
steelers,34l80f,Verksus67,4,Sat May 2 03:46:17 2015 UTC,"A Brent grimes doesn't come around too often. That's one situation that's rare. There's a lot more Richard Sherman, Revis, K Lewis, type tall cbs that do a lot more. Height helps significantly. Why do you think we have always wanted a tall WR like Bryant?   Bottom line? He was best still left at that positiom. They hoped for Rowe but the settled for him. If he was this amazing and height really wasn't a factor? Other would have snatched him before us too. That's facts."
steelers,34l80f,Wvu17,1 point,Sat May 2 03:49:29 2015 UTC,What does a WR have to do with it? You don't want a 6' 4 corner..
steelers,34l80f,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Sat May 2 03:51:29 2015 UTC,People want tall WR to kill these short CBs.... like that's the reason lol. Make them as big a non factor as possible.
steelers,34l80f,SicaBiasThrowaway,0,Sat May 2 03:52:27 2015 UTC,Sigh. I'm not gonna argue with someone who already has their mind made up.
steelers,34l80f,moorese7en,2,Sat May 2 04:02:05 2015 UTC,Just my opinion from my world view. Played WR in high school and some college and I'm 6'2... I loved short corners for every negative reason I said. It's just my opinion and I really hope I'm wrong.
steelers,34l80f,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sat May 2 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"I think we could have traded back into the early 3rd and picked him up still and gotten more picks. That being said? It is what it is, hope he proves my fears wrong.   P.s. I'm sad you're being downvoted because you have your own differing opinion."
steelers,34l80f,moorese7en,2,Sat May 2 03:44:54 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on that... should have traded down. They could have still drafted him, but got more value."
steelers,34l80f,moorese7en,3,Sat May 2 03:48:46 2015 UTC,Golson is baller a straight fearless ball hawk he creates turnovers and makes plays something this team has lacked. Is he small sure but ask chargers if they would throw verett back or watch Brent grimes. Start this kid in the slot right now bottom line if he was 5'10 he's a first round pick so I think this pick is a steal.
steelers,34l80f,zjrk,3,Sat May 2 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"Dupree: A- I've said i'm not a major Dupree fan but this was a great value pick and he was pretty much the best option left on the board at this point. He can play LOLB day one due to his cover skills and he could grow into a monster.  Golson: B+ The guy has the best ball skills and hands in the draft, his technique is NFL caliber, and his instincts are terrific. Yes he's only 5'9 but there have been several capable outside CBs at that height over the years and Golson being an amazing fit for a zone defense (which will help hide his lack of size a bit) is a plus. Even if he is strictly a slot CB though (and he is an amazing prospect in that respect) look at the way the NFL has evolved. The Steelers now use their nickle D more often than they use their base defense and speedy slot receivers are all over the NFL. Guys like Golson and Jason Verrett are going to shoot up drafts over the next few years. The notion that he'd have been there in the 3rd/4th is laughable given the run on CBs that followed the Golson pick.  Coates: D I don't like the pick or the player, nor do I really understand it. If I thought he had slot receiver potential or potential as a possession guy/chain mover i'd be more understanding of taking a receiver. As is I really don't get taking a deep threat this soon.  Overall: B+ Dupree and Golson are really good picks, good enough that i'm willing to overlook the Coates pick somewhat, that fill the two biggest needs the team had going into the draft. If they add a good TE and another solid DB tomorrow then i'll probably bump this up to an A-."
steelers,34l80f,dmremic,1 point,Sat May 2 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"i was expecting a slot/return type wr a little later nut i dont hate coates. while id have loved to trade down a bit and get golson, i dont think hed have lasted as long as others claim. while i had others (diggy, etc) i probably preferred as pure players, after rowe went to philly, golson was about as preferred as anyone to me. i did a little clap when the pick came in. to me, yeah ive seen later grades, but overall hes a player i thought was worth having. then again ive never really given up on cortez so im weird."
steelers,34h67n,TunaNoCrust412,14,Fri May 1 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite at this point would be Ronald Darby. Still a lot of talent available at the CB position. Darby, PJ Williams (likely not on our radar), Eric Rowe, Quentin Rollins, Jalen Collins, and Alex Carter all have second round grades.   In hindsight, going EDGE first and CB second might be the better route because the fall of from pass rusher is so steep.   Here's an interesting scenario. Let's say there is a run on CBs early and Gregory continues to fall. Do we take him or look elsewhere like oline? Just something that crossed my mind."
steelers,34h67n,DRU_leggo,3,Fri May 1 03:32:41 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking why we took Dupree. Very solid CB class so we can address that with multiple picks in this draft. I don't think we take gregory if he's there. I'd rather they get someone like trey flowers or markus golden in the 3rd or 4th.
steelers,34h67n,ShaquilleO_feel,2,Fri May 1 03:36:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think we take Gregory either assuming he's there. With most our defensive leadership now gone, I don't think we can take a guy like Gregory yet. Especially with Jones and Dupree drafted in the first. Plus I think Moats is a great backup/decent starter.  Dude is still relatively young too (27)."
steelers,34h67n,plusblink41,2,Fri May 1 04:21:41 2015 UTC,"We have some pretty good defensive leaders I think. Cam Heyward, Timmons/Harrison."
steelers,34h67n,jrile,1 point,Fri May 1 12:16:52 2015 UTC,"Harrison isn't in the long term plans like Heyward and Timmons are. So I wouldn't have minded taking a flyer on him in the second if we took a CB in the first, but that's it. And since we took Dupree in the 1st instead, we don't need another OLB in the second."
steelers,34h67n,plusblink41,1 point,Fri May 1 15:13:46 2015 UTC,It's hard to say how much of a long term plan Timmons is either.  He could become a cap casualty in the future especially if for any reason we believe that we have someone else who can setup into his role with little drop off.
steelers,34h67n,Drakengard,1 point,Fri May 1 15:37:04 2015 UTC,I know he has the domestic violence charge but I think snagging Frank Clark in the 5th would be a steal. Maybe go CB next round and again in the 4th because I have a strong feeling we will double up at that position
steelers,34h67n,DRU_leggo,1 point,Fri May 1 03:45:03 2015 UTC,It got downgraded to disorderly conduct last I heard
steelers,34h67n,a_drunken_monkey,2,Fri May 1 05:58:51 2015 UTC,I forgot about Darby and PJ to be honest.. Do you really think that there will be a binge on CBs in the 2nd.. lots of WRs guys like Eli Harold and Nate Orchard are probably gonna go here. Hopefully we can hope on one of these corners.
steelers,34h67n,DRU_leggo,1 point,Fri May 1 03:48:41 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. Corners are always a hot commodity in the league so they could dry up fast. But there is still a lot of talent at other positions that could cause a few of them to fall to us.  Still on the board:  Pass rushers: Gregory, Harold, Orchard, Hunter, Preston Smith  DT: Bennett, Philips, Carl Davis  WR: Devin Smith, Lockett, Strong, DGB  OL: Collins, Clemmings, Fisher, Don Smith, Marpet  LB: Kendricks, Perryman, McKinny  And obviously Max Williams, Landon Collins and someone will probably reach for either Hundley or Petty so I think odds are good that one of those corners is sitting there at 56."
steelers,34h67n,tolas,1 point,Fri May 1 04:02:10 2015 UTC,"Gregory, Owa, Eli Harold, Preston Smith, Nate Orchard, Kikaha, Mauldin.  There's still a TON of talent at the edge position, but there's no way we go with another edge guy.  They will go DB or Offense next."
steelers,34h67n,PhantomJB93,1 point,Fri May 1 05:27:15 2015 UTC,"You take Gregory no question.  Jarvis is still no sure thing and even if he busts out, you can run a lot of 4-3 sets with Gregory and Bud on the line and Jarvis at LB."
steelers,34h67n,jibvampxxx,10,Fri May 1 18:34:52 2015 UTC,Colbert said earlier this week that he believes this is the best and deepest year for corner back in 15 years.   I completely expect a cb in the 2nd and/or 3rd round.
steelers,34h67n,Steelering,6,Fri May 1 03:46:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input.. It's deeper than I thought. Didn't expect Kevin Johnson to go early though ..
steelers,34h67n,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Fri May 1 03:49:44 2015 UTC,"did he also say that about CB?  I know he said it about OLB: http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000488457/article/kevin-colbert-draft-offers-best-olbs-in-10-or-15-years  but I didn't catch where he said it about CB  I know other experts have said this draft class is deep in OLB (particularly pass rushing) and also CB, but I haven't heard that CB is as deep.  At any rate it makes sense we went with OLB with the first considering many scouts have graded Dupree a top 10 pick.  I wouldn't be surprised if we took another OLB in the 2nd or 3rd depending on how things shake out.  We won't need exceptional CB play if the defensive front is unstoppable but a CB does seem likely in day 2 (and possibly day 3 as well)"
steelers,34h67n,wjg86,4,Fri May 1 05:49:56 2015 UTC,I don't think Darby will make it to the Steelers in the 2nd but a guy like Eric Rowe or Alex Carter could definitely be there and i'd be plenty happy with either of them. Getting a slot corner like Senquez Golson in the 3rd would also be lovely.
steelers,34h67n,rob61091,5,Fri May 1 03:57:22 2015 UTC,I hope Eric Rowe is there and it really gets me excited when someone other than myself says that a good player will be there lol. I want a freaking corner... And the reason I'm scared is we waited till the 4th and 5th rounds to address corner and WR last year...
steelers,34h67n,garglemymarbles,5,Fri May 1 04:06:22 2015 UTC,Eric is one of my buddies from high school. I might cry if he went to my favorite team. The guy is an absolute animal

steelers,34h67n,ColdNose,2,Fri May 1 16:34:00 2015 UTC,Ronald Darby in the 2nd round? I like it.
steelers,34h67n,NotJoeyWheeler,2,Fri May 1 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"One of the two Collins, anything to help the secondary. I know that Landon is a questionable character but I feel that we can tweak him.

steelers,34h67n,SleestakLightning,3,Fri May 1 03:42:43 2015 UTC,Eric Rowe in Round 2 AND Golson in the 3rd.
steelers,34h67n,ChimpsAreScary,3,Fri May 1 03:56:26 2015 UTC,I don't think Rowe lasts that long but I'd love that too.  Golson is one of my favorite guys in the draft though.

steelers,34h67n,jblumz,2,Fri May 1 04:55:32 2015 UTC,I really want to get Ifo Ekpre-Olomu. He's probably not a 2nd rounder at this point because of the ACL tear. Once healthy he'll be awesome though.

steelers,34h67n,huet99,2,Fri May 1 06:08:58 2015 UTC,"Ifo Ekpe. Without a doubt in the second round. A top 10 talent, and top CB in this draft, but hurt his knee pretty bad. We need CB help badly. And even if he takes a year off to heal, he can learn the system and come in strong in year 2 across from another new CB.  But,  there is a very good possibility he can wait until round 3 or 4"
steelers,34h67n,huhwhatweird,2,Fri May 1 06:33:31 2015 UTC,I don't know about next but sometime around probably 5th or 6th I want us to get Darryl Roberts from Marshall. His athleticism is incredible and he does everything asked of him. He also only allowed 0.88 Yards Per Coverage Snap. His biggest problem is actually just that he waits for the ball to come down so he can try to wrestle out of the receiver's hands rather than making a play earlier.
steelers,34h67n,Juventus19,1 point,Fri May 1 13:05:38 2015 UTC,"If we want another pass rusher in the (3rd?) round, I want Kikaha from Washington soooo bad. The only reason he is dropping is because he i slow, but he is so pure and technical. He would be my favorite pick."
steelers,34h67n,Ginger_ninger,3,Fri May 1 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"It's not that he's slow, it's because he's torn his ACL in his left leg 2 times, let alone another handful of injuries."
steelers,34h67n,Juventus19,1 point,Fri May 1 03:03:02 2015 UTC,If we can get Collins in the second that would be incredible. Maybe trade up into the low 2nd if they like him enough? He has the raw tools for sure.

steelers,34h67n,fearstrikesout,1 point,Fri May 1 05:50:54 2015 UTC,If we're talking late CBs you should look at Darryl Roberts. Hard not to want us to take him 5th or 6th.
steelers,34h67n,Orangepeelss,1 point,Fri May 1 13:07:07 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of expecting CB in 2nd and another pass rusher in the 3rd (with a focus on pass rushing, given that Dupree can be a very versatile OLB), although my OSU bias is kind of hoping we pick up Devin Smith, I know we don't need WR but I think his skill set fits extremely well without current group.  Although I am hoping he keeps falling so we could snag him in a later round, as I think he's being overlooked as a one-trick pony.  But Wallace worked for us and I think Smith could too, and we don't really need anything more from him than that one trick because he is so very good at it and we're not hurting for WR so we can afford it."

steelers,34h67n,huet99,1 point,Fri May 1 03:15:25 2015 UTC,Perriman isn't that great. He has size and speed but his hands are suspect. He could be great but he has high bust potential.
steelers,34h67n,Steelering,2,Fri May 1 13:20:44 2015 UTC,"Well Flacco doesn't need him to actually catch the ball, just be near it and then do a convincing acting job."

steelers,34h67n,ColdNose,2,Fri May 1 03:02:44 2015 UTC,"considering how the rules have been changing, we shouldn't waste any draft picks on such a player, but rather just recruit some struggling MMA guys so that its less of a penalty when they get suspended for hitting a WR, and if one of them is a good kick boxer, maybe we can have him properly train AB during his suspension periods. /s"

steelers,34hngh,Swazi,5,Fri May 1 05:59:22 2015 UTC,"Dude there were no CB that had the value of the 22nd pick. That becomes obvious when you see only one more CB was taken after and that was at pick 27. And fromnwhat I've read he is no closer to making an impact on any team than the 2nd round talent available.   I think we did great, bud is heavier then his available counter parts, he is faster then them in 40 and 10 yd spli (3 cone was the only slower time), bigger, stronger, he has a much better grasp and more experoemce of dropping in coverage.. His big flaw is not using his hands or technique beyond speed and power to get. Teaching swiping w one arm, jerk and grab etc shouldn't be that hard...   Now if we Dont go after a few DBs soon then I'd be concerned"
steelers,34hngh,akmalhot,1 point,Fri May 1 15:05:33 2015 UTC,"As I said, I have come to terms on Dupree, and am happy with it.  But, they need to take a couple DBs today, because their history of taking them in the later rounds is pretty horrible.  Id love if Collins from lSU fell.  But the realistic options will be the Utah CB or PJ Williams from FSU."
steelers,34hngh,PomfAndCircvmstance,5,Fri May 1 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"I think part of the Steelers CB issues has been the waiting till way late in the draft to address the position. Generally the later you get in the draft the less talented the players you get will be and the less likely they are to stick around. Of the guys they took 4th round or earlier one was horrible, one was very good, and the other has at times been both good and horrible.  I'm hopeful that if they target the position tomorrow with their 2nd/3rd rounder and again Saturday with their 4th rounder they'll, if nothing else, luck into a solid CB or two because the ones pegged to go in those rounds are pretty good relative to other recent drafts."

I am actually impressed Dupree fell that far, given most mocks had him typically top 10.  I think Mayock had him going to the Falcons at number 8.  Pete Prisco of CBSSports had him going to the Jets at number 6.  Now that's I've calmed down from my initial knee jerk reaction, I appreciate this as a super value pick.  But damn, they NEED to address the secondary tomorrow with at least two picks."

steelers,34hqck,hermafrijol,7,Fri May 1 06:38:07 2015 UTC,"Between the height and knee issues I wouldn't even think about him till the 4th round. He's feisty and I like his ball skills (and his athleticism prior to the injury) but i'm extremely wary of smaller CBs playing on the outside. When I watched him I also noticed that he tends to let receivers get behind him in an effort to bait the QB to throw at him. He managed to make it work in college partially because college QBs are not terribly accurate but in the NFL, with faster receivers who can high-point the ball and better QBs doing that too often could lead to giving up big plays.  He reminds me of a smaller DeAngelo Hall but that knee injury scares me and I have reserves about him being anything more than a slot corner in the NFL. If healthy he could be a very good slot CB but if i'm going for a smaller CB i'd probably look at Senquez Golson first."

steelers,34ed5a,IdunnoLXG,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:22:47 2015 UTC,I said CB baby not Bud Dupree!
steelers,34ed5a,BigDaddyRed,9,Fri May 1 14:38:04 2015 UTC,"I am hoping for OLB, or CB in round 1.  I am hoping we end up with Waynes, or Peters, but suspect it will be Kevin Johnson at CB.  At OLB I like Beasley, and Dupree, but suspect we would end up with Harold, or Gregory.  I don't like Gregory (size and character concers), and Landon Collins (concerns about coverage ability, and I believe in Shamarko/Mitchell) from guys we have been mocked, or have made it past us in some mocks.  For food, I am planning on spicy cheddar sausage dip.  I have about 3-5 pounds of homemade sausage that I need to use within the next few days.  If anyone has a good dip recipe involving sausage, I am all ears.  Right now I am planning on a block of cream cheese, some cheddar cheese, some jalapenos or other spicy pepper, sausage, and maybe a little hot sauce in the slow cooker for a few hours."
steelers,34ed5a,meowdy,3,Thu Apr 30 13:44:04 2015 UTC,"The more I hear about Kevin Johnson, the better the pick sounds. Dupree is my favorite pass rusher candidate - what about you?"
steelers,34ed5a,rhino43grr,4,Thu Apr 30 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"I like Beasley more than Dupree, but there is no way we get him.  Out of guys we have a shot at, I agree that I like Dupree the most, and I hope he is the pick.  I am back and forth on Johnson.  He has pretty good athleticism, but has issues in coverage.  I don't know enough to know if they are just easily fixable technique issues or not though.  The team seems fairly interested, so I am hoping his issues are fixable.  If we got him, I wouldn't hate the pick, but I would much rather have Peters.  I am hoping we steer clear of safety.  I don't really like any of the first round guys, although I have seen none of Damarious Randall who seems to be a late riser.  Are you hoping for a pass rusher or corner more?"
steelers,34ed5a,rhino43grr,3,Thu Apr 30 19:54:14 2015 UTC,The only criticisms I've heard about Kevin Johnson have been in regards to his tackling and ability to get off WR blocks. I think Bud Dupree is long gone by the time the Steelers pick.
steelers,34ed5a,meowdy,5,Thu Apr 30 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"I have read criticism about how much Johnson plays off speedy guys, basically giving them a free release, and an easy catch underneath, and he commits a decent amount of penalties.  I also don't really expect Dupree to make it to us, but I think there is a small chance it happens."
steelers,34ed5a,rapey_tree_salesman,4,Thu Apr 30 20:04:27 2015 UTC,"So, he plays exactly the way Steelers CBs have been coached to play for the past decade or so."
steelers,34ed5a,bradley_44,2,Thu Apr 30 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"Playing off isn't a huge issue in a zone scheme, but playing off speedy guys, and being flagged 9 times for 132 yards in two seasons at the college level is something to worry about.  If he is going to be an NFL level player, he should be able to handle college level speed without using his hands to slow the receiver.  It could just be poor technique though."
steelers,34ed5a,ColdNose,3,Thu Apr 30 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"If there were two prospects who could both contribute day 1, I'd want the pass rusher.  One thing that worries me about this season is that Jarvis and Harrison are both right olbs. I don't know how either of them would do on the left side and I don't want Moats starting 16 games there. So I'd like if we could draft a day 1 started for the left side, who could rotate with Moats while Harrison and Jones split time and stay fresh.   That being said, I'd want a day 1 starter at corner more than a developmental pass rusher. And I'm not even going to pretend to know how much development an individual player needs - that's up the coaching staff. But a good pass rush does more for the secondary than a good secondary does for the pass rush in our scheme."
steelers,34ed5a,dmremic,3,Thu Apr 30 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"I would probably agree with that.  I don't think the mocks with us taking a safety make a ton of sense, unless the team feels Jarvis is ready to take another step, Harrison/Moats will last two years, or there is a late round guy they are eyeing at OLB.  Corner needs to be addressed tonight or tomorrow, and OLB is almost as pressing.  I feel decent about our safeties, and wouldn't have a problem with waiting until day 3.  They aren't great, but I don't see as big a need there as I do at corner, or pass rusher."

I know two things we shy away from in the 1st are CBs and character issues but they seem to have genuine interest in this guy.  It sounds like they've done their research and shown him more love than any other prospect, so if he's available I think it's him."

steelers,34ed5a,SleestakLightning,5,Thu Apr 30 14:11:33 2015 UTC,"That angers me because I feel as though he was just being investigated because the child is his or could be, not because he was a suspect. Interesting development, and sad that it's gonna cost the kid millions."
steelers,34ed5a,rhino43grr,2,Thu Apr 30 14:23:52 2015 UTC,"You're right. He is wanted for questioning, just to get more details, not as a suspect. It must be an awful feeling losing so much after losing people he cared about. I really feel bad for the kid"
steelers,34ed5a,SleestakLightning,3,Thu Apr 30 14:48:10 2015 UTC,"Well, the number one cause of death in pregnant women is murder.  If that baby's his, or even if he thought it was his, of course he'd be the prime suspect.  His attorney said he's got an excellent alibi and people that will vouch for him that he was nowhere near the scene, but that doesn't mean much.  He could have had someone do it for him.  Also, his attorney came across really crass when he said the timing was poor for Collins.  The timing wasn't great for Brittany, either.  And a lot of times police say they just want to question somebody and that they're not a suspect.  Interestingly, though, he left Chicago to go to Baton Rouge and the police said they weren't ready to interview him yet.  I don't know what that means, but I'm pretty sure no one's going to want to take a chance with that hanging over his head.  I sorta feel bad for him if he does get exonerated too late."
steelers,34ed5a,rhino43grr,4,Thu Apr 30 16:58:01 2015 UTC,"There's no happy ending in this for anyone because not only did he lose a loved one, but now if the baby is his he would have had a multimillion dollar contract right out of the gate to use to support that child.  Now he faces potentially going undrafted (I, for one, don't believe that will be the case) and only receiving a fraction of a million for the first 4 years of his contracts.  Although it's important to point out that even undrafted players make a healthy amount of money, so I digress about that point.    Just seems like this leaking out and media outlets twisting the story to insinuate that Collins is a suspect, as opposed to someone who provides critical information to the case is rubbing me the wrong way.  IANAL, but I'm wondering if there's any legal recourse that La'el could pursue to recoup some of that money potentially lost.   Still hoping Pittsburgh does their homework on this and gives him a chance. He would be nasty in our zone blocking scheme and overall is just a really talented freak of nature. Munchak could turn him into an Pro-Bowl caliber guard."

steelers,34ed5a,Diarygirl,5,Thu Apr 30 18:01:20 2015 UTC,"Peters or Johnson? I don't really follow college, so could you guys tell me who would you rather have if we drafted a CB? Half of the much drafts I've seen having us taking one while the other is still on the board. Who is better?  Also, Mike Mayock, who knows his football, had us taking Byron Jones. Who is he?"
steelers,34ed5a,rhino43grr,3,Thu Apr 30 22:11:30 2015 UTC,"Marcus Peters is easily the best CB prospect in the draft. He's got pretty much no weaknesses on the field as he can play everything from press man to deep zone and with his speed, strength, and ball skills he's a constant threat to QBs and receivers. The one concern with him is that he's a bit of a hot head who clashed with coaches at Washington. I don't think his dismissal from the team was entirely fair though and I think in a strong locker room he won't be a problem.  Kevin Johnson is arguably the second most skilled CB in the draft after Peters. He has great awareness, technique, and ball skills and he's a natural athlete with good size, speed, and explosiveness. The one concern with him is that he's a little on the light side (about 190 lbs) and needs work as a tackler. Still he has shown a willingness to tackle which is 50% of becoming a good tackler so I expect he'll turn out alright no matter where he lands.  Byron Jones is one of the most intriguing prospects in the draft with his mix of athleticism, instincts, and leadership qualities. He's a guy who will come in and assume a leadership role early on. He also has very good speed and closing burst when making a play on the ball and the guy can leap out of the stadium. He doesn't have amazing quickness when changing directions though and some people have concerns about the level of competition he faced. In a defense like the Steelers though his issues would, for the most part, be hidden and he could even play FS if needed.  Of the three Peters is a cut above the rest with Johnson being a bit better than Jones. All three are likely going in within the first 26 picks though and you can't really go wrong with any of the three."
steelers,34ed5a,shutupandboogie,4,Thu Apr 30 22:22:25 2015 UTC,"Wow. Thank you very much for that thorough response. As you said, it sins like you can't go wrong with any of them.  So if Peters is the best, is Waynes just a shade below since everybody has him going as the top corner?"
steelers,34ed5a,steelflapjack,3,Thu Apr 30 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"is Waynes just a shade below since everybody has him going as the top corner?   Eh, i'm not a big Trae Waynes fan. He's really fast and explosive and he does have good instincts but he's also very grabby which is partly caused by his tight hips. He doesn't handle quickness well at all and when he needs to quickly adjust or change directions he kind of stumbles over himself. He managed to compensate for that in college by grabbing receivers down field (which will get called a lot more in the NFL) and by using his explosiveness to catch up (which will be harder to do with how accurate NFL QBs are) but i'd be really concerned about how he's going to adjust to the NFL game because of those issues. Guys like Antonio Brown and AJ Green would/will destroy him if he doesn't learn to handle quick cuts better.  A lot of people have Waynes as a top corner because of his speed and the fact that he was really good in college against pretty good competition. I feel like he hasn't been as heavily scrutinized by the draft media like some of the ""late"" risers (Johnson, Jones, Darby) have been because of the pre-draft hype though. I won't be shocked if he's the first CB off the board (if Justin Gilbert can go top 10 anything can happen) but I also wouldn't be surprised if he slides a bit farther than people expect."
steelers,34ed5a,JohnnyAcqua,3,Thu Apr 30 22:42:09 2015 UTC,"So if our front office prefers to take a corner tonight and Peters, the actual number one corner as you said, is gone, would you take Waynes over Johnson and Jones?"
steelers,34ed5a,Juventus19,2,Thu Apr 30 22:48:28 2015 UTC,"Personally, no I wouldn't. I'd take Johnson or Jones over him and possibly Ronald Darby from FSU as well as i'm really high on him. I could see him being the pick if he is there though and I wouldn't hate the pick. He checks a lot of boxes the Steelers like in their players and in their CBs (6+ foot, fast, willing tackler, multi-year starter) and if he learns to be less grabby and better anticipate when quicker receivers are going to cut then he could develop into an elite CB.  I actually really like this CB class for the first two/three rounds.

steelers,34eow4,SleestakLightning,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"The rumors are that he suffers from depression and some form of OCD. Teams are being very careful not to reveal anything publicly because they don't want it to look like they're not drafting him because of a mental health diagnosis but there are teams that are definitely shying away from him because of it.  If I'm the Steelers, even if I've vetted him, I hesitate to pull the trigger in Round 1 because he has shown that he cannot stop smoking weed and he's of no use to the team if he's suspended."

steelers,34eow4,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"I like him and I would be happy to have him at 22. With that being said, I like the top tier CBs (Peters, Waynes, Johnson) more, and I also like some of the OLB options in the second round (Orchard, Preston Smith, Eli Harold potentially).  If I had my way they go CB then Edge 1 and 2 respectively, but I wouldn't hate the Gregory pick if the first crop of CBs is off the board."
steelers,34eow4,PSFanInNC,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"I'd be absolutely shocked if he's the pick at 22. As others have said, you have the drug issue and I think, while no one is saying it explicitly for obvious reason, there's a strong probability of some serious mental health issues as well.   I would also that, despite the fact that he was talked about as being a top 5 talent very early in the process, he's no longer a value at 22 in the current market. I think there's a very good chance he might even be available for the Steelers in the second round and im not even sure I'd want him there.   I continue to love the idea of us taking Peters."

I don't care about the pot, because as long as he can work it around the league's mandatory drug testing it at least shows he's committed to the team first. There are some guys, like Josh Gordon, who can't put down the reefer even when millions of dollars are at stake. As far as questions about mental toughness, well he should probably spend a week or so with Deebo. That'll change really quick."
steelers,34eow4,SleestakLightning,0,Thu Apr 30 21:41:35 2015 UTC,Pass.  He loves weed too much and has some other issues that NFL teams are being mum about.

Didn't get to see much of our first round pick, Ryan Shazier, he was hurt most of the season along with Jarvis Jones. Our most disappointing player was easily Cortez Allen. He was playing miserably and eventually got benched.   Overall, our defense was nothing to write home about. But our offense was one of the best, if not the best, in the NFL.   I'm very hopeful for a deep playoff run next season, but for us to do that I think we have to have a pretty good defensive draft starting today. We have probably the toughest schedule in the NFL so it won't be easy."

Actually finally investing in our secondary that, to me, is all that's needed to make this a good draft to me."
steelers,34bc9d,IdunnoLXG,3,Wed Apr 29 23:17:34 2015 UTC,Middle Linebacker is stacked. Only 3 Outside Linebackers on the roster.  One of them has 3 sacks in his career and one is 37 years old.
steelers,34bc9d,TheSaltbird,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:03:48 2015 UTC,"Even if, we literally have no secondary. Comparatively speaking yes, our LB corps. is far more stacked."
steelers,34bc9d,IdunnoLXG,4,Wed Apr 29 22:29:38 2015 UTC,I disagree.  In my opinion the linebackers are just as depleted as the secondary.  Gay is solid and Blake is promising.  Will Allen is consistent and Mitchell should be much better.
steelers,34bc9d,TheSaltbird,-2,Wed Apr 29 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"Oh dude come on. If Gay is your best secondary man then there's something wrong. Don't get me wrong the guy shows heart and outside of Timmons and Harrison was the only one on the defense that showed up against the Ravens in the playoffs but back in '05 he was liability. Why? Because he wasn't that good. Just look back at when an old beat up Garrard just scooted past him. Even Garrard said had Gay not hesitated and went at him he would of went down and we may very well wouldn't have lost that game against the Jags.  Our secondary's a joke. The more we say, ""these guys who played poorly all season but had glimpses of promise"" may turn out to be better the more we can get frustrated at our DB woes."
steelers,34bc9d,ColdNose,3,Wed Apr 29 23:01:04 2015 UTC,"I mean, no offense, but to discredit Big Play Willie Gay you brought up something that happened almost a decade ago. Wasn't he a rookie?

steelers,34bc9d,IdunnoLXG,4,Wed Apr 29 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"At this point, in my opinion, Deebo is not as good an OLB as Gay is a CB. Deebo is 37 years old while Gay just had the best season of his career. With that being said, I'm extremely happy Deebo resigned.  EDIT: And yes, our secondary is top priority. I just think Gay is a more than capable starter."
steelers,34bc9d,ColdNose,2,Wed Apr 29 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"Really? Gay was bad in 2005? Obviously he's still awful then /s. Our secondary is bad.  I never said it wasn't.  I said our outside linebacking corps is equally bad.  Blake didn't play all season, but when he did he balled out.  Our outside linebacking is not 'stacked' even when compared to the secondary.  That is the point I was addressing and if you look at my past comments, you'll see that I'm a HUGE proponent of a corner in the first.  **Edit: Forgot Willie Gay was drafted in 2007....  Either way, Gay has improved a lot since he was drafted."
steelers,34bc9d,a_drunken_monkey,2,Thu Apr 30 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"First of all Gay wasn't drafted until 2007, secondly Tyrone Carter missed the tackle on Garrard, and lastly you're saying that since a guy wasn't good in his first couple years in the league that he's now terrible forever?

steelers,349q53,White_Bread21,3,Wed Apr 29 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"Not 'nightmare' but not ideal either. I think Johnson is a very solid pick here. The last of the top tier of CB talent, who also fits our system. Lots of connections between Tomlin and Johnson (including through his coach at Wake). Not the best value ever, but not a reach and fits a need.  If Johnson were to go earlier and none of these CBs, EDGE, etc. were available, THEN it's a nightmare scenario."
steelers,349q53,NapoleonBlownapart87,2,Wed Apr 29 15:35:44 2015 UTC,"It all depends if you like Kevin Johnson. I personally hate him as a prospect. He's a weak tackler, he missed a tackle every 5.1 attempts according to PFF. He has some red flags including being academically ineligible for a season at Wake. He also has refused to bench at the combine and a month later at his pro day. This says to me that he isn't working on his strength and his weight room habits are not where they need to be, especially since he has to put on weight to play. Also if he pits on weight   that could affect his speed. He already has questionable speed. And my final gripe is he gets really uncomfortable when the ball is in the air and gets very grabby. I think he's a weak prospect who should not be considered a first rounder."
steelers,349q53,White_Bread21,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:24:25 2015 UTC,All I've heard is that he actually plays the ball well in the air...
steelers,349q53,Opuski,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:13:57 2015 UTC,He plays the ball but holds the receiver. He gets grabby because he isn't that fast. It doesn't matter if he picks it off if hes called for interference.
steelers,349q53,White_Bread21,2,Wed Apr 29 21:20:51 2015 UTC,Why is that?
steelers,349q53,cyhh,3,Wed Apr 29 15:04:23 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing because most of the players being discussed as possible selections were all gone before we picked.  If I have to make an argument for Kevin Johnson its that he plays the ball very well in the air.  If he's picking it off or knocking it down his ability to tackle or lack thereof isn't a huge knock.  Either way I'd much prefer Peters who I think is the best corner in the draft.  I think someone is going to fall, I'm just not sure who."

steelers,349q53,tonytroz,2,Wed Apr 29 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"My dream is Peters, but Ray would be a great consolation."
steelers,349q53,White_Bread21,2,Wed Apr 29 16:45:54 2015 UTC,"With Shane Ray's most recent arrest, I think he will fall past the first round. He has talent, but he is a pure pass rusher and can't play the run well which will hurt in our system. I like Shane Ray, but he kinda scares me too."
steelers,349q53,Juventus19,2,Wed Apr 29 16:51:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think he falls out of the first. This guy was a potential top 5 pick, and 100% top 10. That's just too good of a value for a late first round pick to pass up. The Falcons have already come out saying he's still on their board with the #8 pick even with the arrest.  Not sure if the Steelers would pull the trigger, but another team like Baltimore will. No way he escapes the first."
steelers,349q53,tonytroz,0,Wed Apr 29 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"He wasn't 100% top ten, multiple people have had him mid-late first."
steelers,349q53,CeeBeast,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:32:21 2015 UTC,"You don't really need to explain the Kevin Johnson pick. Even in a stronger draft he'd still likely be a 1st round pick due his combination of size, athleticism, technique, and skills and he's got the ability to come in and be a day one starter either outside or in the slot. If the Steelers don't take him odds are the Cardinals, Ravens, Cowboys, or Packers will."
steelers,349q53,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"Kevin Johnson is super weak against the run, which in our system is a really important quality in CBs, so I doubt he's the pick."

steelers,349q53,jvjc1233,-4,Wed Apr 29 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"If this happens, look for someone like Perriman to be the pick. The steelers are fiercely best player available even though there are needs elsewhere. Colbert and Tomlin both believe that you can never have enough great players and they hate the idea of missing out on a star. I don't know how the Steelers evaluated Perriman but based on big boards I've seen, some are suggesting Perriman could be ranked up there with Cooper and White.  Like your mock this isn't what I want to happen, but rather what could happen."
steelers,349q53,Volleyball45,3,Wed Apr 29 13:36:33 2015 UTC,"I would be floored if they took Perriman. The BPA strategy of the Steelers is actually a bit of a misnomer - they don't just take the highest guy rated on their board, but they evaluate all ""needs"" equally. For example if there were a top flight TE available here, along with a solid CB like Johnson, they would take the TE if they had him higher on their board despite it being a lesser need. With that being said WR is not a need at all so I wouldn't see it. To illustrate this to the extreme, if Marcus Mariota fell here, he wouldn't be the pick."

steelers,34avi9,ColdNose,3,Wed Apr 29 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"He's very good in coverage and has really smooth hips.  Probably the most day 1 ready corner although does not necessarily have the highest ceiling.  Concerns regarding his strength are valid, but coverage wise he's really pretty good.  Sucks at tackling but he's willing, which is what you want (poor tackling can be fixed).  Check him out here"
steelers,34avi9,dmremic,2,Wed Apr 29 18:48:33 2015 UTC,"Can I just say that the phrase ""loose hips, can turn and run"" could be the most hilarious imagery used to describe a potential draftee....  Like are we seriously going to draft a guy who can't pivot and run?   I presume this qualitative statement is somewhat quantified with shuttle times or agility drills at the combine.    But the bigger question is, had there ever been a collegiate CB who couldn't pivot his hips and adjust from back peddling to running with a WR?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when I read some of these things...."

steelers,34avi9,White_Bread21,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:55:05 2015 UTC,"Meh is how I feel, too. I think he's in that 2nd big clump of CBs and maybe the 4th or 5th best overall after Waynes, Peters, Jones, and maybe Collins. But he's not that much better than guys like Darby, Rollins, Williams, Carter, Rowe, or White. That's a lot of options.  One of them will probably still be left late in the third.

Decastro wasn't because his fall was legendary but ever since spindenhall they have done a lot of due diligence on their first rounders. The reason they showed previous interest could be because he was projected in the second and only in the last month or so have people been putting him in the first.
steelers,34avi9,ShaquilleO_feel,2,Wed Apr 29 21:23:32 2015 UTC,Maybe you're right.  But everything I've seen has shown Johnson as a 1st rounder and Mike Tomlin and Art Rooney were at the Wake Forest Pro- day.  Tomlin also has a connection with Wake Forest's head coach from his Tampa day's.  Wouldn't surprise me if they had dinner with him and made up their minds about him then.
steelers,34avi9,ColdNose,3,Wed Apr 29 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. Get a pass rusher in the first round, double dip at corner later in the draft."

Side note, I don't claim to be an expert or even good at evaluating guys. I just enjoy watching it and trying to form my own opinion.  I think the most likely pick is Byron Jones, due to his versatility playing safety and corner. Also his willingness in run support, we love run support corners.   I get the feeling we won't take an edge guy until day 2, mostly because Colbert has been emphasizing the great depth in this class since like March. Not ruling it out due to BPA but it's just a hunch. I absolutely did not see Shazier coming last year though so with that in mind I'm probably completely wrong and we'll draft a punter in Rd 1"

His character concerns are way overblown and him getting kicked off the team has more to do with a new coach wanting to send a message than anything else. Put him on a Meyer,  Saban, or Harbaugh coached team and we don't hear about these issues at all.  I don't see him being there though. Instead I think Kevin Johnson or Byron Jones will end up being the pick which I'd be fine with. They fit the range and both can be day one impact guys."

It will not be Shane Ray in my opinion.

steelers,34938z,237FIF,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:12:15 2015 UTC,"I think your oversimplifying the comparison between Ray and Peters. The weed charge hurts of course, but I would be more concerned about the toe, coupled with his lack of athleticism; I don't think he translates well to the OLB or the 5-tech in this system.   As for Peters, he is a top 10 talent on tape and in the gym, but as you say he got kicked off of his team. Between the two I'd take Peters."
steelers,34938z,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"I think Ray looked super athletic on tape and his number were bad because of the toe.

But I think olb is just a more important position when all else is equal."
steelers,34938z,237FIF,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"His athleticism on tape, IMO, is largely predicated on that great first step - which is definitely an asset - but NFL tackles recover much better than college ones.

steelers,34938z,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:51:03 2015 UTC,Totally agree. All he has is a great first step/speed and being so one dimensional simply won't cut it against NFL caliber tackles. It's a huge gamble as to whether he can develop any other pass rush moves and with other enticing prospects likely on the board I don't want him to be the pick.  I honestly believe Shane Ray is Aaron Maybin 2.0

steelers,34938z,B_Witt,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:20:11 2015 UTC,Derron Smith out of Fresno State is a guy im pretty high on who can be had around the 3rd round. Great cover safety.
steelers,34938z,ColdNose,-1,Wed Apr 29 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"Personally,  I'm kind of getting tired of hearing a hundred opinions on what we should do with our 22nd pick. So I'll just quietly wheigh in by talking about some late round strategies. I believe most teams, including the Steelers, have sort of a mindset that the 1st round pick is ideally used to get an impact player, who can contribute right away. The later rounds are without a doubt viewed as projects, who would rather fill a positional need than offer that instant factor.   So, that's one thing. Then, what else are you looking for in a late round player? Someone, who we are able to coach with quality staff and/or veteran players of the same position. While we don't have much veterans in our O-line, we have a lot of talent and leadership there in Pouncey and Decastro. Then there's Munchak. Our Tackle position could use an upgrade or a plan B, at least. And Foster probably isn't getting any younger.   Above are my conclusions for why we should draft two offensive linemen in the late rounds. Linemen, who are projected as late round picks, have had their success in college much due to their size, with which they've been able to win their battles. When you have the size to play in the NFL (see: McCullers), all you need is some quality coaching. And i think we'd be foolish to pay Munchak if we didn't provide him with a lot of material. I say we go for a Tackle and a Guard in rounds 5 - 7."
steelers,34938z,Opuski,3,Wed Apr 29 12:23:31 2015 UTC,I don't think our tackle position needs an upgrade.  Beachum grade out as a top ten tackle and we just extended Gilbert.
steelers,34938z,Samwise777,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"According to washingtonpost.com, Beachum allowed 8 sacks last year, although Roethlisberger was sacked on only 5.1% of his dropbacks last year, which marks his career best by far. Beachum had a total of 6 penalties. It was hard to find many NFL tackles who have similar or worse numbers from last season. While Beachum has exceeded everybody's expectations as a 7th rounder, I think we're not quite where we want to be at LT. Mike Adams has had his opportunities, and Gilbert has been OK and developing, imo.   One of my points in the earlier comment was that O-linemen need ideal size to be good or excellent in the pros. Whereas runningbacks can succeed either with a Chris Johnson/Jamaal Charles body type, or a Mike Tolbert/Jerome Bettis/LeGarrette Blount body type. Same goes for wide receivers. You can be a Wes Welker type or you can be a Calvin Johnson type. But you gotta have size as a lineman. Which is exactly what late rounders can offer in chunks. I'm not saying that size makes you great player, but I do think that a good percentage of late round steals come from the linemen department. Now we have Munchak, who was a 9-time pro bowl player and is a Hall of Famer himself. I think he can give his insight and help us nab a gem under the radar late in this draft."
steelers,34938z,Opuski,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/02/12/sig-stats-pbe-offensive-tackles/  According to Pro Football Focus Beachum finished 3rd in total sacks, hurries, and hits on his QB as a percentage of his drop back snaps.  This isn't player grades or anything subjective.  He gave up some more sacks because we had a lot of drop backs, but as a percentage of his drop back snaps he finished 3rd best in the league."
steelers,34938z,Samwise777,-4,Wed Apr 29 20:08:22 2015 UTC,"Scratch Beasley, Gregory and Ray off the pass rusher list, all overrated. Marcus Peters is a total hot head who doesn't listen. Kevin Johnson is the guy we need, let's hope he falls to us."
steelers,34938z,yinzerjagoff,0,Wed Apr 29 12:49:07 2015 UTC,"Well Beasley, Gregory and Ray aren't really overrated. Talent-wise we'd be lucky for any of them to drop to us. Gregory and Ray's off the field issues are concerning, and I don't think Ray has enough versatility outside of his pass rush for him to be our guy anyway, but Gregory would be too good of a fit and too good of a player for us to pass on him if he drops. Marcus Peters has his concerning issues, but he's said all the right things regarding them, and his former program has vouched for him as well, so if the Steelers check out on that, I'd love for him to be the pick. Kevin Johnson keeps getting mocked to us, but I don't see it. He lacks any strength, and is horrible against the run because of it, which in our system is really important for CB's. He's also had his own off-field issues, with a year of academic ineligibility in college. That's less concerning than the other guys, but he's far from a safe prospect for us."
steelers,34938z,NotJoeyWheeler,0,Wed Apr 29 17:30:22 2015 UTC,"Beasley, Gregory and Ray = Jarvis Jones 2.0 IMO. We really don't need another OLB who is barely above 240 lbs. These guys don't have the strength to hold up on the edge in the NFL. Keep in mind Gregory and Beasley both played around 230 in college, sorry but there is no way a 230 OLB would have success in the 3-4 we run. They'd be a wasted pick for us. Even Eli Harold, same thing we him, couldn't beat a tackle unless he literally ran all the way around him. This OLB class is all hype, to me they're a bunch of lightweights. James Harrison is the exception to play a 240 LB, his strength is ridiculous. Going to back to Cowher, the most successful OLBs we've had all weighed at least 250 lbs. Johnson is a perfect cover 3 corner. Peters is more a press corner, which we rarely do."
steelers,34938z,yinzerjagoff,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:51:36 2015 UTC,"Beasley did play very light in college.  However, he weighed in at 246 pounds and still blew away the combine."
steelers,34938z,ColdNose,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:20:16 2015 UTC,"I agree that the weight of Gregory is concern, especially if the report that he weighed south of 230 at team visit is true.  However, I don't see the the comparisons to Jarvis Jones. The levels of athleticism  can't be compared: 4.9 and sub 4.5 40s.  Beasley is long gone at 22 and I am not keen on Gregory for weight issues (don't forget he's also 6'5""), but I like Ray. First, the 250 lb minimum for success is bunk.  Porter weighed 241 when we drafted him.  Yeah, Haggans and Gildon ~250.  Second, at his pro day Ray weighed in at 249.  More than Harrison and Porter.  Three, not convinced that you can label a player a bust after 2 seasons, one of which being marred by a major injury. But if he is a bust, Ray surely has the size to be successful on the weak side.  Don't forget that so much of Jones struggles involve technique and his ability to use leverage.  Coaches were pretty much good with his weight."
steelers,34938z,tolas,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with all of this.  Fowler is the only sure fire OLB in rd1.

Like the article said:    It's about discipline and sacrificing certain things in order to achieve lifelong dreams. It's about being selfless, being dependable and being professional.   It doesn't matter that it's legal in some states.  It's in the contract they all sign:  don't smoke weed.  I'm not giving Le'Veon a pass either.  I was infuriated at him when he got arrested.  Now in retrospect, if Le'veon had tested positive right before the combine, or a couple days before the draft in the case of Shane Ray, I think I'd have said let's not draft him.

Really makes us look like civilized hard working individuals  instead of backwoods hicks.  Pretty sure the guy in the pic one time stopped me at the Wood Station T to ask me if he should take the trolley all the way to the North Shore to go to the casino smelling of nothing but cigarettes.
steelers,345ki2,badbloodcatch,9,Tue Apr 28 14:04:08 2015 UTC,"I'd rather go for the best CB available in the first round. I'd think the fact that we have a good, steadily developing D-line is something that will help our current pass rushers make an impact this year. In addition to Jarvis Jones, the Steelers have some intriguing projects at OLB, which include CFL sack star Shawn Lemon (who got offers from multiple NFL teams, but chose the Steelers because of a bigger signing bonus), Howard Jones (who showed some flashes last Pre-Season) and Jordan Zumwalt (who is still probably struggling to get noticed, yet has been able to hang around and provide some competition.)  Sure, our OLB situation is not the best around, but competition, along with some help from Cam and Stephon, should give us a better front seven. I can't stress enough the fact that, whoever we may draft at #22 to be an immediate impact kinda guy, he's going to help both the pass rush AND secondary. Those things go hand in hand. Ergo, we should take the best player available who also fits our system the best. My concern is, there isn't too much competition among the DBs. Honestly, can you name a single CB from our current roster who isn't named Allen, Gay or Blake? Secondary is where I would start come draft day.   Now, outside of the 1st round, there are several CBs who could transition to Safety, which is why I firmly believe the Steelers are going for two CBs in the first 4, maybe even the first 3 rounds.   P.S. Speculations aside, Jarvis is going to have a breakout season. Shazier will get 5 sacks at ILB, too."
steelers,345ki2,Opuski,3,Tue Apr 28 15:03:47 2015 UTC,"I must add, the 1st round could get reaaaally wild and unpredictable with all these emerging stoners."
steelers,345ki2,Opuski,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"I'd rather go for the best CB available in the first round.   This is how I feel, but almost every analyst says they're crazy for not taking an edge rusher because the system relies so much on it and Jones has been a bust.    Now, outside of the 1st round, there are several CBs who could transition to Safety, which is why I firmly believe the Steelers are going for two CBs in the first 4, maybe even the first 3 rounds.   I would be happy with CB and LB being the top two picks (either order really), but I'd really like to see them snag Jesse James in the third (I don't think he'll last till their pick in the 4th). Heath isn't going to last forever and a freak TE in the mold of Jimmy Graham or Gronk could push this offense over the top. A third round CB/S isn't going to turn this defense around overnight."
steelers,345ki2,tonytroz,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are any 3rd round picks who can make an impact and turn a group around overnight. Once again, I want to point out that we lack not only talent, but competition as well at CB and Safety. I wouldn't mind getting James in round three. Would be great, in fact. And granted, the CB position is one of the deepest in this draft, which may help us get good value in the 4th round."
steelers,345ki2,Opuski,6,Tue Apr 28 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"Ray screams Jarvis 2.0 to me. Unimpressive measurables, no pass rush moves, huge stats. If you're gonna take a risk on somebody I'd go Gregory, seriously watch some clips of him if you haven't. Dude is electrifying.  Also, I agree that CB is probably a bigger need than OLB right now anway. Take Peters if he's there, otherwise wait til day 2."
steelers,345ki2,kdubs412,3,Tue Apr 28 16:57:01 2015 UTC,"I too would love Gregory over Ray. From a pure skills standpoint, I feel Gregory's play would transfer to the NFL level better."
steelers,345ki2,plusblink41,2,Tue Apr 28 20:10:39 2015 UTC,Gregory is so slow off the line and I feel like he relies on his talent more than technique. I'm curious what has you liking him so much (legitimate question looking for other opinion).
steelers,345ki2,deverhartdu,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"His length is a huge asset against tackles, and once he gets into the backfield his speed is good enough to chase down scrambling QBs. He's great in space and can get to the QB on the outside or inside using a number of different methods. I think he'll need to bulk up to be an every down guy, but he should do fine as a situational pass rusher who can drop into coverage as a rookie.  The one big advantage I've seen with Ray is his first step, which as you say is much quicker and more explosive than Gregory's. Outside of that, though, I don't see much to like with Ray. No bend, stiff in coverage and not an exceptional athlete for the position. He looks like a third round guy to me."
steelers,345ki2,kdubs412,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:29:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I think Ray is overrated too but I'm just not as high on Gregory (or Dupree either).
steelers,345ki2,deverhartdu,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:45:16 2015 UTC,How is he Jarvis 2.0. Jarvis is Slow. Ray is fast and is way better at converting speed to power than Jones ever was. People keep comparing the two but they aren't similar at all.
steelers,345ki2,White_Bread21,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:48:40 2015 UTC,"What's weird is I agree but also disagree. I don't see the similarities from an athletic perspective, but I also don't think he's a good fit either. I worry about his lack of moves (which is similar to Jones), and his inability to hold the point of attack in the run (similar again). He's got a tremendous motor to be sure (similar again), but I don't like him for the Steelers."
steelers,345ki2,NapoleonBlownapart87,3,Wed Apr 29 15:47:26 2015 UTC,I have Peters over Ray in my opinion! Im slightly worried that Ray is either gonna get suspended in the NFL (sometime in the future if he has a problem) and I'm not sure if his injury will limit him

steelers,345ki2,NapoleonBlownapart87,2,Tue Apr 28 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"If Peters is gone then definitely. Ray is my favorite pass rusher in the draft. He's fast and has a good first step, he can get to the QB on that alone and adding some moves would make him unstoppable. Bill Polian called him the next Robert Mathis and I agree. But Marcus Peters is the best way corner prospect I've seen in a while."

steelers,345ki2,heavymedicine,5,Tue Apr 28 14:07:59 2015 UTC,What's not to like? I think he's the best pass rusher in the draft.
steelers,345ki2,tolas,5,Tue Apr 28 14:10:25 2015 UTC,"He's great! Has a motor!! But he struggles to disengage from blockers (awful spin moves), not the most athletic edge, can be stiff, and he can't cover! He still has a lot of work"
steelers,345ki2,TombaFan123,2,Tue Apr 28 14:14:40 2015 UTC,Well coverage is the least important attribute in a pass rusher. All those other things can be coached. I think his athleticism is good enough and I think he's just overall the most complete and NFL-ready pass rusher.

The problem isn't people breaking windows and flipping cars. The problem is the little guy has been squeezed out by big business and the political elite.

steelers,343xzs,MattEven,4,Tue Apr 28 13:39:29 2015 UTC,"People riot and destroy property in the name of their sports team winning and nobody bats an eye but if they do it in the name of social injustice everybody loses their minds.   People absolutely hate sports riots, and think they are dumb as shit.  The shit in Vancouver after they lost the cup got worldwide attention.  Sports riots tend to last a night though, and are a lot less violent than this was.   The problem is the little guy has been squeezed out by big business and the political elite.   So how is looting stores, burning down senior centers, attacking members of the media, attacking firefighters, cutting the hoses of firefighters to stop them from putting out fires, and attacking random people in their cars going to fix that?  All that will do is cause everyone with the means to leave the city to leave, just like the 60s/70s in Baltimore.  The 80s, and 90s were a very bad time for the city due to that.  All this is going to do is destroy the community.    Something needs to be done about police brutality, but random acts of violence, and arson is not the solution.  It just makes the situation worse.  The CVS the looters destroyed probably isn't opening back up, so there goes a few jobs in that community.  The senior center they burned down, will probably just be moved elsewhere, or not rebuilt, so there goes a few more.  The overtime for cops, and firefighters, along with damage to firefighting equipment and cop cars is going to come from somewhere, and likely means cuts to other social services.  A bunch of people can't work today due to fears of this happening again, which could be a drop in income.  People are going to be hesitant to go into the city for a while, which means another drop in income for businesses in the city.  All this rioting is doing is destroying the city, and causing a bunch of money to leave Baltimore.  I live in Baltimore County.  The message has shifted quickly here from stopping police brutality to stopping the destruction of the city.  These riots are having the opposite effect of what everyone originally wanted.   The problem isn't people breaking windows and flipping cars.   If this was all that happened, it wouldn't be getting nearly the coverage that it is.  People are afraid to go into the city right now.  My wife works there, and thank god her job is closing at noon due to the continued threat of violence in the area.  This isn't a protest anymore.  The stuff yesterday was called a purge (after the movie) by the people who started.  The people doing this shit just want to destroy things.  They have 0 interest in making things better, and a lot were high school kids.  This was the flyer that organized all of the violence yesterday.  Does that come off as if it were made by a group that is interested in bettering the community around them?  All this rioting is doing is destroying the city, and giving the actual peaceful protests that have been on going for days a bad name.  It sounds like the plan is to attack Security Mall today, so they have shut that down, and police are already in the area."

steelers,341ljw,TheAmazingKenneth,8,Mon Apr 27 17:10:53 2015 UTC,And they still said on ESPN That he did that for a new contract
steelers,341ljw,SleestakLightning,10,Mon Apr 27 17:40:52 2015 UTC,He may want a new contract. He should want a new contract. He's vastly outplayed his current contract and he is worth much much more.  There's nothing wrong with him wanting a new contract. I wouldn't begrudge him if he sat out of voluntary workouts in order to get said contract.  As long as he shows up on Sundays and plays like he's capable I don't mind if he never practices.

Should he give the Rooneys a refund for vastly under-performing his contract in 2012?   I get that he's a bargain at the price he's at now for the way he played the last 2 season. But he and his agent decided to sign a 6 year deal. If he doesn't have to take less because of years he under plays his salary, then he shouldn't expect more on years when he over performs his salary. And if his agent didn't put in enough incentive clauses to make up the difference between the base rate and his actual play, then he needs a new agent far more than he needs a new contract."
steelers,341ljw,SleestakLightning,6,Mon Apr 27 19:31:56 2015 UTC,I never said I thought he should be given a new contract. Just that he SHOULD want a new contract. Everyone should want to be paid more.   I never begrudge someone from chasing money.

Not similar to Polamalu Landon Collins has tight hips making it difficult for him to adjust quickly, terrible cover skills when he's anywhere more than ten yards down field, and average at best hands and ball skills. Seriously the guy is good as an in the box Safety who can tackle and play the run. He's not a FS though either physically or from a skill set standpoint and he sure as hell is not another Troy Polamalu. Why do people want to try and make him out to be something he isn't?"
steelers,347aua,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Tue Apr 28 22:09:26 2015 UTC,Nope and as soon I as read similar to Troy double no there will prob never be another Troy and Landon Collins is for sure not that guy.

With Gregory falling and based on what the FO has said, I bet we will move up to get him if OLB is what we want.   If cornerback is what we want, both Marcus Peters and Jalen Collins are on the board who would both be a better pick than another big hitting safety with coverage issues.  Honestly the Landon Collins shit all over our subreddit is spam and should be deleted. If Marcus Peters or Randy Gregory are anywhere near us I expect us to take them."
steelers,347aua,KanyeWest_GayFish,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:07:09 2015 UTC,Gregory is not going to be a Steeler.  Shane Ray is not going to be a Steeler.  Landon Collins MIGHT be a Steeler. But he's not what they need so I hope not.
steelers,347aua,SleestakLightning,2,Wed Apr 29 00:20:06 2015 UTC,Why isn't Gregory going to be a Steeler?  Character concerns? We still picked Mike Adams and his character has been great.  Draft order? Solid chance he falls after the drug issues.  Scheme fit? He's probably the best fit for us out of all the edge rushers.
steelers,347aua,KanyeWest_GayFish,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:30:30 2015 UTC,"Character concerns? We still picked Mike Adams and his character has been great.   I think it's a moot point because some silly team will take a chance on Gregory long before the Steelers do but Mike Adams and Randy Gregory are completely different situations. Adams sought out the Steelers and just the Steelers to explain himself and set up sanctions with them if they drafted him. That's an unprecedented thing for an early round pick do. Also Adams, to my knowledge, didn't have any issues with drug problems prior to the failed Combine test.  Gregory on the other hand was on the verge of being kicked off the team at Nebraska for failing drug tests, proceeded to fail a drug test at the Combine, and then came out with a story about how he stopped smoking weed over a month before the Combine and somehow still tested positive. While the guy can turn things around all the early signs point to the guy being a habitual user (he claims he no longer is but he clearly was at Nebraska) and that's way more concerning than Adams just failing the Combine test. Gregory has also done nothing on par with specifically seeking out the Steelers to explain his actions.  If anything Mike Adams is the exception that proves the rule as far as the Steelers avoiding guys with substance abuse concerns. Adams was also, and this is really important to note, a 2nd round pick. The risk of blowing a 1st round pick is enormous in comparison to the risk of wasting a 2nd rounder. If the Steelers take Randy Gregory it would be way out of character for this front office. They've been willing to take guys with ""character concerns"" on occasion but drugs/alcohol are generally pretty high on their list of things they avoid."
steelers,347aua,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"Gregory also came in for a pre-draft visit. Who knows what they talked about? You have to admit there's a real chance he falls, and if the steelers liked him when he interviewed, I'd be extatic to have him."
steelers,347aua,KanyeWest_GayFish,0,Wed Apr 29 02:59:31 2015 UTC,"I won't say there's a zero percent chance the team drafts him as they've drafted prospects I hated and didn't want before (fuck Ziggy Hood). Based on everything i've seen and read about Gregory, both on and off the field, I just believe it'd be a really bad move. Especially in a draft with this much edge rushing talent available the first three rounds. If I thought Gregory were a better prospect i'd be more inclined to take a risk on him but all I see is a slightly different shade of Barkevious Mingo who himself is just a slightly different shade of Dion Jordan."
steelers,347aua,PomfAndCircvmstance,0,Wed Apr 29 03:10:13 2015 UTC,Gregory is much worse character-wise than Adams. Gregory is literally addicted to pot and with Bell missing 3 games this season due to pot I can't see the Steelers taking a guy who literally can't stop smoking.  Plus I don't think he's strong enough to play the run.

steelers,343cr1,MrGoosemahn,11,Mon Apr 27 23:53:59 2015 UTC,This is really a bad situation for the Steelers as far as drafting a pass rushing OLB in the first goes. He will now slide even farther down the boards-maybe even off of some boards-and that will push players that we might've had a shot at at 22 (read: Bud Dupree) into teams earlier that might've been interested in Ray instead but still need a pass rushing OLB.  I know that all of that is mostly just a run-on sentence but I hope it was at least clear enough to understand.
steelers,343cr1,Volleyball45,10,Tue Apr 28 00:25:52 2015 UTC,I don't believe we need a first round olb in the first place.  I'd much prefer a corner and then grabbing a guy like orchard in the second.

steelers,343cr1,Volleyball45,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:43:37 2015 UTC,"Especially after this too, someone will still take chances on guys like Ray with talent and questions off the field in the 2nd round before us, leaving us in the same position we'd be in regardless."

I would love to have Shane Ray at 22. He has a relentless drive and knows how to get to the quarterback against quality tackles. He can win one on ones on speed and hand technique alone. He could succeed on our line playing next to Tuitt and Heyward. I've seen you ask where he would play and really it doesn't matter because when a talent like that falls you make space for him.

I've explained how despite his good first step Ray's complete lack of bend (seriously the guy cannot get low at all) and lack power (hand technique doesn't do you any good if you get physically mauled) is not going to get him sacks against NFL offensive tackles, that's not slander that's an obvious observation. If you can't bend to get inside and can't physically power past a blocker you are not going to beat NFL caliber players for sacks. If you can point me to an NFL superstar pass rusher who has awful bend and lacks power please do so."

Im guessing the Steelers front office sees all of that and will know better than to use a first round pick on a guy like that when others are available with similar skill sets.

steelers,342dsl,chaz_batch,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:09:03 2015 UTC,"He has good length and some nice athleticism but when he can't just blow past the guy blocking him he looks completely lost. He wastes time hand fighting with OTs and TEs and doesn't even think to cut up field unless there's a gaping hole for him to run through. He also has poor awareness and instincts as to where the QB/runner is and there were a number of plays where he could have sacked the QB that he flat out missed because he was so caught up fighting with the guy in front of him. He's also always the last player out his stance which puts him on the defensive when teams choose to run at him and unless he manages to knock the blocker in front of him off balance (which is going to be a lot harder in the NFL) he gets washed away because he lacks the strength and technique to get around the guy blocking him. Has there ever been a pass rusher with his build that was successful in the NFL? Jason Taylor was kinda on the light side but Gregory flat out looks like a Safety (and not Laron Landry).  He got a lot of hype for his physical attributes and for flashes of great plays which has caused some people to overlook the sea of wasted plays in between those impressive plays where he gets single blocked and does nothing. Even if you do think he isn't just another Barkevious Mingo though (how is that working out for the Browns by the way?) the guy was one failed drug test away from getting kicked off the team at Nebraska and couldn't stop smoking weed a month before the biggest day of his life to that point. In a draft with a lot of good 2nd/3rd round pass rushers who I don't need to worry about becoming another Josh Gordon why would I take a guy who, based on all of the signs we've seen, is heading down the same road?"
steelers,342dsl,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:55:32 2015 UTC,Because there are people in charge of those things - during his visit they judged his character. People who are payed hundreds of thousands of dollars to figure these things out will know if he's got the attitude that he needs to not have those problems.  There are plenty of turnaround stories and plenty of fuckup stories.  I trust that a very conservative team when it comes to character issues is making the right decision if they decide to take Gregory because that means they think he's worth it and believe he'll take the right path.
steelers,342dsl,slivr33,0,Tue Apr 28 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"I think that they are gonna go DB though. I watched Gregory play in College at Nebraska and he would do good in the Steeler's defense, but I don't see them getting anything but a DB."

steelers,34025a,TheUpupaEpops,16,Mon Apr 27 05:47:03 2015 UTC,"I think Gay, C. Allen, and Blake will get the first crack at the starting lineup with Shamarko and Mitchell starting at safety.  The rookie(s), crossing my fingers for Marcus Peters, will get a shot to earn a starting spot in training camp."
steelers,34025a,ColdNose,5,Mon Apr 27 05:55:46 2015 UTC,"I think Allen and Shamarko will need to battle it out in camp for the starting spot. I'm all for giving the kid his shot but not at the risk of fielding a team that's not playing its best players. I've no doubt Shamarko can earn the spot, if not in camp, then through reps in game throughout the season. If by the end of the season he's the starter, great. But I don't think it should just be handed to him."
steelers,34025a,autopilot_music,5,Mon Apr 27 06:28:38 2015 UTC,"Whoops.  To be honest I completely forgot about Will Allen.  Yeah, I absolutely agree with you."
steelers,34025a,ColdNose,9,Mon Apr 27 06:50:00 2015 UTC,"Losing Taylor and Polamalu really doesn't hurt the secondary at all. True they're name guys but Taylor was statistically the worst CB in the NFL in 2013 and Polamalu was pretty terrible last year being a liability in coverage and missing tackles way too often. The only real loss in the secondary was Brice McCain who, while getting overpaid by the Dolphins, was still one of the better secondary players last season.  I think the Steelers will take a CB in the first two rounds and then grab another one in the 3rd/4th round to play along with Gay, Allen, and Blake. While i'd like to say Cortez Allen will figure things out and start i'm not going to hold my breath. I am excited to see what Blake can do as he flashed some nice potential as a starter last year. I still think his best spot is in the slot but he showed he can ball as an outside CB as well. I'm also really excited to see Shamarko Thomas get a chance to start and i'm hoping the coaching staff is willing to move Mike Mitchell to SS and allow Thomas to light guys up and ballhawk from the FS position.  Based on who I have the Steelers taking in the draft i'm thinking we get something like:  CB#1: William Gay - Rookie  CB#2: Rookie - Cortez Allen  Slot CB: Antwon Blake  FS: Shamarko Thomas/Rookie  SS: Mike Mitchell/Will Allen  I do think the team goes CB in the 1st (Marcus Peters, Kevin Johnson, Ronald Darby, Byron Jones) and that CB ends up starting and depending on who their second CB is (Senquez Golson in the 4th is my hope) I could see a rookie playing in the slot as well, possibly even starting. Personally i'm excited about the defense and the secondary this year. They were pretty bad last season but fortunately I don't see them getting worse as, depending on the draft, I see them gaining more than they lost in terms of talent."
steelers,34025a,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Mon Apr 27 06:29:04 2015 UTC,"CB#1: William Gay - Rookie  CB#2: Rookie - Cortez Allen  Slot CB: Antwon Blake   I think ideally we'd have a rookie and Allen on the outside and Gay playing slot, but that's assuming Cortez gets his head right and we draft some phenomenal rookie. Gay did pretty well last year on the outside, but I prefer him in the slot."
steelers,34025a,IDontNeedThisIndigo,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:26:50 2015 UTC,Blake and Gay is not bad tbh. No LoB but they'll hold the fort well enough. That 3rd spot is gonna be important.
steelers,34025a,TombaFan123,3,Mon Apr 27 13:56:43 2015 UTC,"What matters is that we fix our pass rush.  Our corners are okay IF we can get pressure on the QB regularly like we used to.  I hope Allen can rebound.  What's reassuring is that he was in the right places last year.  He just could not figure out how to stop the ball from going through him.  It's a mental hurdle, one that I think he can progress through."
steelers,34025a,Drakengard,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:02:51 2015 UTC,Personally i'm excited about the defense   How do you feel about the departure of Jason Worilds?
steelers,34025a,tstscavo,3,Mon Apr 27 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not concerned about him at all to be honest. Yeah he was solid in coverage but he was an awful pass rusher and struggled against the run. He had a pathetically low number of QB pressures and of his 7.5 sacks only 1 of them came as the a result of beating an OT. Arthur Moats is better against the run and posted more than half of Worilds sack total with 1/3rd as many snaps while James Harrison posted comparable numbers to him with a little over half as many snaps. I'm confident that either guy could be at least as good as Worilds with the same number of snaps, maybe even be better."
steelers,34025a,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:45:51 2015 UTC,Ronald Darby/Byron Jones are NOT first round talent. If we draft either of them at RD1P22 I will break shit.
steelers,34025a,SleestakLightning,2,Mon Apr 27 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"Disagree on Jones. He's big, he's physical, he can cover. He's the find of player that gets drafted by New England at 32 and becomes a star."
steelers,34025a,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"In a stronger draft maybe they wouldn't go 1st round, although I believe Johnson would, but in a year like this where there's maybe 10-15 true 1st rounders and a whole lot of 1st/2nd round tweeners all three guys could go in the first 32 picks. All three have good cover skills, very good athleticism, and good tape.  If not one of them though who do you take? Eli Harold is the pass rusher equivalent of them, O-line isn't really a need and there is unlikely to be a lineman worth taking anyways, Maxx Williams is barely above Clive Walford as far as TE prospects go, and Marcus Peters and Trae Waynes are likely gone in the top 20. Maybe Shane Ray drops (due to being a 1 trick tweener who doesn't really fit on a lot defenses) or Randy Gregory smokes himself into the mid 20's but I'd rather have a good CB prospect than either of those two potential busts."
steelers,34025a,Exclusive412,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"Between Trae Waynes, Marcus Peters, and Kevin Johnson, one of the three will be on the board at 22."
steelers,34025a,Opuski,2,Mon Apr 27 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say we're in bad shape, I mean we're kinda where we were in the season. Sure Ike and Troy helped out as depth but they didn't really Have 5 Ints or FF or things of that nature. Ike was beat several times. I believe Brice McCain was our biggest loss. Don't sleep on Shamarko being the X factor. We don't know what we have with him yet. Also Mike Mitchell was supposedly playing with something torn in his leg, so maybe we haven't seen his best football."
steelers,34025a,Exclusive412,2,Mon Apr 27 12:40:05 2015 UTC,"I was almost inclined to say this is what an optimist sounds like, but then I remembered that this is just what the pessimists don't say.  I have to agree with you. It's hard to pinpoint the fault in our defense, since it was far from stellar in the pass rush department as well. Had we had more sacks, our CBs would've had more picks and so forth."
steelers,34025a,deverhartdu,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:40:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean the defense was bad maybe shazier would have helped all around in terms of rushing on the side or grabbing picks. But we played like a 14-2 offense if the defense would have produced some turnovers who know where we would be. Yes if we had more pass rush that would take the look off our secondary I hope we make the right move in the draft though and grab Marcus peters
steelers,34025a,Exclusive412,2,Mon Apr 27 20:36:19 2015 UTC,I think I also read somewhere with Mitchell that he was basically forced into playing one safety position because of Troy but definitely prefers the other. I could be wrong though. If that's the case then I'm more than happy to see what he can do assuming he gets his timing a bit better so he doesn't keep showing up late on plays and he also gets fewer flags.
steelers,34025a,deverhartdu,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean the whole season Mike didn't touch a ball I believe. No deflections, no fumble recoveries, no picks. He had a pretty bad year for a guy who just got a nice contract but I'm willing to give second chances if this even applies as one."
steelers,34025a,Exclusive412,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:37:21 2015 UTC,Right same here. That's kind of what I was insinuating because if he's more a ss but had to play fs or vice versa I forget which that can be a bigger change for some guys than ppl think.
steelers,34025a,simmonsb,2,Mon Apr 27 21:16:58 2015 UTC,Yeah and not to mention it was harder for him to play because Troy does so much and moves around all those years Ryan Clark controlled the back when Troy was up or in the box or blitzing or whatever and Mike wasn't used to it I guess.

steelers,33xuum,IdunnoLXG,6,Sun Apr 26 21:30:17 2015 UTC,That game was one of the most impressive offensive dominances I've ever seen. Ben had all day to throw and he was picking the Colts apart. We were a couple fumbles and a drop away from putting at least 60 points on the board.
steelers,33xuum,dubs2112,2,Sun Apr 26 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"the opening drive was textbook perfection; the offense was so efficient in the first quarter they ended up scoring only 1 TD because of how methodical they were moving the ball they ate up a ton of clock doing so.  The 2nd TD came on the first play of the 2nd quarter and then of course the flood gates remained open after that.  This game was just one of those games where the offense looked legitimately unstoppable by anything the Colts could do, and it took some careless ball handling and fumbles by Blount/Heyward-Bey to keep this game somewhat competitive.  Even with those terrible turnovers and Luck and the Colts somehow putting up enough points to keep it close, I was never worried at that point because the rest of the offense was just too damn good that day."

If you want more than just highlights Alex Korza from Steelers' Depot did a good breakdown on him. The College football part of PFF is high on Peters and Jones.  Byron Jones would be my next choice for CB. Again, Steelers depot did a good breakdown.   Then there is ""Bud"" Dupree. Dupree is someone I want if he fell that far, many people have him as a top 15 pick. Dupree's video breakdown  by /u/Barian_Fostate or a gif breakdown from Steelers' depot. Football outsiders ""Sackseer"" gave Dupree the 2nd highest value in this draft class."
steelers,33xinq,sw337,2,Sun Apr 26 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not crazy about Jones as a round 1 pick. Round 2, okay, but I want something a little more polished in round 1. I like what I've seen from Peters much more. I know people are concerned about character issues with Peters, but if the interviews went well and all that is behind him, I'm all for him.  Dupree intrigues me. I'm going to be a little hypocritical here, because Dupree falls into that unpolished category like Jones, but I personally see a lot more potential from Dupree than I do from Jones. Jones reminds me of a Stanley Jean Baptiste, while Dupree reminds me of a Ziggy Ansah."
steelers,33xinq,slicehix,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:46:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on Peters. He is my favorite player in this draft and a realistic option at 22. Still, it is hard to argue taking him over one of the top four EDGE rushers (those being Beasley, Gregory, Fowler or Dupree) if one of them is by some miracle falls.   I wouldn't mind Jones at 22 though. I think he is valued somewhere in the 20's so I don't see it as a reach.

Skins fans generally don't mind the Steelers from what I've found, but living this close to Shittown (a.k.a. Baltimore) and the band wagoners from the Super Bowl they were handed recently are a bit obnoxious.

The one time I went with my Dad it was full of older guys in their Jerseys all rowdy and ready for that game. Paul Brown Stadium frequently fills up with a bunch of Steelers fans and I like to assume that a lot of them are local. Sometimes Bengals fans that I know will try to give me crap about it, but they usually end up looking silly since they have nothing to back up the loser team that is the Bengals. For the most part people are pretty cool about it.

I was born in Pittsburgh, my family is in Pittsburgh and even though I have not lived in the same hemisphere as Heinz Field since the parking lot was Three Rivers Stadium, my fanatical commitment to Mr. Rooney's football club (and the other sporting consortiums of Pittsburgh) reminds me of where I am from and my eternal connection to the 412.  Saw a guy here in Papua New Guinea wearing a Mendenhall jersey the same day as I posted the last picture of me with the Terrible Towel. True story. The local gentleman had no idea who Rashard is. He said he just wanted a Steelers jersey. Around the world people have come to associate the black and gold with tenacity, commitment and loyalty.  And bubble screens."

My Dad grew up hating the Cowboys because everyone in his class liked them because it was the 70s and of course school age kids are going to jump on the bandwagon. They gave him tons of hate for not liking the cowboys so he became their bitter enemy and started to cheer for the Steelers once the rivalry sprang forth back then. I grew up a Steelers fan because of this and my Dad, my 2 brothers (despite liking different teams when they were younger) and myself would consider ourselves die hard fans. This includes Jerseys at least every game day, a Steelers flag always flying on game day, watching most every game together, each of us have Steelers themed rooms in our houses (I am also a huge Penguins fan so mine has a bit of both), and more Steelers gear than I can even recall. I get a ton of trash talk at school and about town because everyone has their own team, but nothing too malicious (they're just peanut butter and jealous 'cause we got 6).

A lot of Torontonians say that the are big football fans but have little football knowledge.  I'm often asked why I like the Steelers and there are many reasons but I usually give the quickest and easiest one; they've won 6 championships, more than any other franchise.

Or they might say; ya but that was way back in the day  To which I reply; in the past ten years they have been to 3 Super Bowls and won 2 of them  They they'll start to shit talk Ben and I have to jam his stats (particularly the last couple years) down their throats to shut them up"

If you aren't a Vikings fan here, you're probably a Packers fan, so that was a bad year.   I just bought a 99 Jersey, da Beard was da best. I have a terrible towel on me on Sundays.

When I wear Steelers stuff, other Steelers fans will chat me up. Pats fans are generally morons, Giants fans are quality. Anyway, at this point I don't really feel like there's anything to prove. Our record speaks for itself.   As a side note, I try to make it a point to wear our gear the day after a loss. Solidarity. I've never had anyone go ""ha ha you guys got thumped"" or any shit like that. It's easy to wear your gear on gameday or after a win. If it's important to rep the team, wear it after a loss.

Wish I had a Bettis jersey (was what I asked for but the folks couldn't find a damn Bettis jersey in town in 1998).   I get some head turning here and there. Once in a while I'll run in to a Ravens fan. But being that this is Nebraska, all interactions have been cordial. Even with Ravens and Browns fan. Although, there's a HELL of a lot more ribbing when it comes to any fellow AFC North fan.   I make it a habit to highfive anyone displaying Steeler love. I know a couple of folks in both towns do as well. I've had my Steelers wallet since I graduated High School. I've had my Black Ward jersey since my stint working for ESPN's website.   I just wish I had my old coat. Was one of those fluffy bubble coats that lasted me 5 - 6 years. Damn fine coat it was...  I still have my three Steelers keychains as well. I've got a nice Steelers flag proudly planted on my wall, with the cherry on the sundae being a Troy Polamalu stick-on on my wall.   Been a Steelers fan since I was 10 years old, when I met a guy that would later be something of a big brother. Dude is a die hard Steelers fan, and it rubbed off on me.   Imagine the horror on my mothers face. A mother whom has been a long time die hard Cowboys fan...:)  (Between my mother, and my sister (Who is a Packers fan), I root for both of their teams. We have a thing with the three of us, whoever is in or left the playoffs we root for. Such is family ties. My mother even bites the bullet and roots for the Steelers.

Defenses literally knew what side he was throwing to the minute he snapped the ball. Yancy was a good receiver for us but not as good as this article alludes to.

It might be hard for some people to pronounce and spell, but it's easier to guess than Gordon-pronounced-Jordan or Ryan-spelled-Raiyenne.    Keisel is at the normal level of weird. It reminds me of Liesl, which totally fits in among the names I'm seeing now for girls for two reasons: - The ""cute little old lady from Europe"" names are IN for girls: Hazel, Ella, Elsa, Anna-with-a-soft-A (yep, as seen in Frozen), Mabel, Greta, Marta... It's like everyone with a daughter is taking inspiration from the cast of The Sound Of Music. - Popular names are often built around one-syllable differences. For boys, we're finally seeing a slowdown of Aidens, Jadens, Peytons, Haydons, Bradons, Cadens, Masons, and the occasional Zaydens. About a decade ago, every little girl was Maddy-Mattie-Abby-Addy.    In conclusion: if there can be Liesls, there can be Keisels.

Not saying all kids are evil in nature but they do fucked up things to people who are insecure (fun fact: it's nearly all of them until college) without thinking of repercussions.  Granted, try seeing if your wife would like to make that her middle name and subsequent family nickname (like Beverly Keisel Johnson--or whatever your last name is).

steelers,33tre4,huet99,12,Sat Apr 25 15:34:19 2015 UTC,"The reason people are opposed to going Safety in the 1st is because this is not a very good Safety class and the one Safety with a 1st round grade is extremely limited (pure in the box SS). If there were a really good FS prospect people wouldn't be nearly as opposed to taking one in the 1st.  As for the debate between CB and OLB people have different opinions regarding the players who will be available and based on that people are going go want different positions. Personally I don't see an ""impact OLB"" worth taking at #22 so I'd rather see the team go CB where I do see good value.

Ray has been living on pre-Combine hype for months now and given his limitations  (very stiff, poor bend, one trick pony) I don't see how he fits into the defense considering Jarvis Jones is still here and neither guy can play LOLB.

steelers,33tre4,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:20:20 2015 UTC,Shane Ray can't play LOLB because he is too tight hipped to drop into coverage (the way Jason Worilds did) and he's not big/strong enough to hold up against the run the way Lamarr Woodley could. Pretty much the only thing he can do is use his good first step to get after the QB which limits him to being strictly a ROLB in the Steelers defense. The problem is Jarvis Jones is also not fluid enough to drop back into coverage and he isn't strong enough to hold up against the run consistently which limits him to being strictly a ROLB. For the most part you can't have both of them on the field at the same time because you'll be left with two OLBs who can't cover or play the run.  I do really like Kikaha in the 2nd though.

A corner like Marcus Peters could make an impact immediately.  Shane Ray is a speed guy but his combine numbers don't really translate to him being a freak athlete. There is an advanced metric for rating edge rushers based on their athletic tests and when you look at the historic numbers, guys on one side of the test end up being good/great NFL players much more often than those who don't. And the ones who don't tend to bust more often.  Shane Ray does not make the list.   But these guys do:  Vic Beasley, Clemson      Randy Gregory, Nebraska  Alvin Dupree, Kentucky    Owa Odighizuwa, UCLA  Preston Smith, Miss St    Danielle Hunter, LSU  Frank Clark, Michigan     Shaquille Riddick, WVU  Marcus Rush, Michigan State       Davis Tull, UT-Chattanooga  I'm not saying those guys will be better than Shane Ray.

steelers,33tw33,huet99,6,Sat Apr 25 16:15:48 2015 UTC,"You go ahead. I'll go the opposite way and hope some team takes him and lets someone better fall. Realistically the most likely players  someone would take in place of Ray are Beasley, Dupree, Gregory, and Fowler. I would take any of those over Ray, hurt toe or not."
steelers,33tw33,Intropy_,2,Sat Apr 25 19:36:47 2015 UTC,Fowler is the only one ahead of him IMO. But I respect your opinion.
steelers,33tw33,Exclusive412,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:08:47 2015 UTC,"I agree %100 Ray is thin, and very overrated in my opinion if we take him it's going to be a mistake. Seems slow to me he should still go top 10 but he's OR"
steelers,33tw33,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:44:08 2015 UTC,I want nothing to do with Dupree or Gregory on this team. Fowler is going Top 5 though. Beasley is probably Top 10. If Beasley fell to 22 the Steelers should have their pick in two seconds after going OTC.  Ray seems like a bust to me.
steelers,33tw33,White_Bread21,3,Sun Apr 26 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"I love Shane Ray at 22. His fall has been legendary. He was a sack machine last season and he has a mean streak. People say ""he has no bend"" and that he is too weak to hold the Point of attack, but this guy has a great motor and a relentless drive to get to the qb. If he bulks up he could be a 10 sack guy."
steelers,33tw33,SleestakLightning,4,Sat Apr 25 17:13:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I find it crazy that Steelers fans aren't excited about the possibility of getting him. He blows right past tackles consistently.
steelers,33tw33,SleestakLightning,0,Sat Apr 25 17:36:27 2015 UTC,In college.  He's not going to be able to do that in the NFL.
steelers,33tw33,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Apr 26 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"You could literally say that about any college player, at any position, with no evidence to back it up other than he's in college. Really dumb argument."
steelers,33tw33,Rorbotron,2,Mon Apr 27 00:11:07 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. You look at how the guy wins battles and gets his sacks. He's all speed. He has no second move. He takes short, choppy steps and if he's beaten right away he doesn't adjust. He's relentless in pursuit but if the tackle gets even half of his body on Ray, he's done.  He doesn't bend around blocks. He's great when he gets off the snap and uses speed to blow past people but in the NFL he'll be going up against elite athletes every week.  The adage is that you can't teach speed and that's true. But almost everyone in the NFL now is a freak athlete. Very few players make the NFL without being freakish in one way or another. You need something more than just pure speed to get by in the NFL."
steelers,33tw33,KingKablamo,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:32:29 2015 UTC,"I understand your argument and completely agree with you about the type of player that has a hard time transitioning to the NFL. I just don't think it's Ray, I think he is very technical and good with his hands, along with his speed."
steelers,33tw33,KingKablamo,0,Mon Apr 27 19:08:08 2015 UTC,His measurables suggest that he's all speed and he's less explosive of an athlete than people give him credit for. I think he's more likely to be a bust than Vic Beasley or Dante Fowler by a lot.
steelers,33tw33,Opuski,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:56:26 2015 UTC,I like a Ray but I also love me some mike mayock and mayock has him ranked 5th for edge rushers.  I still want Peters in the first.  I think we can grab a good edge rusher in the second.  I also believe moats when given the snaps will surprise people this season.
steelers,33pr7k,sl8r2890,11,Fri Apr 24 14:33:49 2015 UTC,I wish more kids from college would wrap their tackles soundly rather than just throwing shoulders. To me that's more impressive and translates better in the secondary. What do I know though I'm just a fan.
steelers,33pr7k,TrooWizard,3,Fri Apr 24 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"Seriously! One example that comes to mind is DJ Swearinger. He was so fun to watch in college (South Carolina) because he could just lay people out, but he still tries that in the NFL (Texans) and it never works. It's difficult to watch, I'm surprised he actually starts."
steelers,33pr7k,moyerr,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:36:49 2015 UTC,Amos played CB early on in his career at PSU. Wasn't a shutdown corner so they moved him to safety for his general coverage skills. He's not going to be a big tackle machine and his technique shows that.

steelers,33pr7k,JollyRogers40,3,Fri Apr 24 15:11:36 2015 UTC,"Amos has a great physical skill set.  I'm not certain that we need to draft a safety though.  Shamarko Thomas is an unknown to us fans. It seems like they still have confidence in Mike Mitchell.  If the front office doesn't like either of them as a starter, then I'd love to see us draft him.  I don't think we'll draft him unless we believe he can move to CB"
steelers,33pr7k,OhwhatupCarlandJonny,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:36:12 2015 UTC,We definitely need FS depth. Outside of Mitchell(who is better suited for SS) we have a bunch of special teams guys who just aren't good enough to actually play on defense. A cover FS is my dream in this draft.
steelers,33pr7k,White_Bread21,2,Fri Apr 24 20:10:50 2015 UTC,He reminds me of Shamarko Thomas as a prospect in a lot of ways (that's a good thing) and I really like that he's versatile enough to drop back into coverage down field as well as cover the slot. I don't think he has the instincts or awareness Shamarko does but I wouldn't mind him as a backup Safety in the 4th/5th.
steelers,33pr7k,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Fri Apr 24 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"Big yes from me. I know the video tries to paint him as a big hitter guy who plays the run, but I think that merely highlights his versatility. I see him better suited to play FS. He's a good center fielder, and he's even better in coverage. He had by far the lowest allowed passer rating of any safety last season. I really hope he's there in the 4th, and I might consider moving up from the 4th or down from the 3rd depending on how the draft shakes out."
steelers,33pr7k,Intropy_,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:58:07 2015 UTC,What's his expected draft position?  I wouldn't mind him a little later
steelers,33pr7k,B_Witt,2,Fri Apr 24 15:55:41 2015 UTC,"3rd-4th round. Projected as a backup safety that can play SS or FS. Good coverage skills but not ballhawk or big hitter. I can't imagine the Steelers taking a safety that high with the major needs at LB, TE, and CB."
steelers,33pr7k,tonytroz,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:54:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say TE is a major need. All the guys brought in for pre-draft visits were 5th round guys or later. Any talent in this draft is pretty equivalent to the guys on the PS already. Safety is a way bigger need than TE
steelers,33pr7k,White_Bread21,3,Fri Apr 24 20:13:55 2015 UTC,Safety is a way bigger need than TE   Very true. 43 being gone means teams are gonna trial by fire the next man up on that side. Right now the wolves are looking at a wound on their prey. We need a solid replacement.
steelers,33pr7k,willyumv3,2,Fri Apr 24 20:26:09 2015 UTC,43 being gone means teams are gonna trial by fire the next man up on that side.   That's how it's been for two of the last three years. You're crazy if you think Polamalu was anything but a shell of his former self in 2014 (when he missed a quarter of the season) and 2012 (where he missed over half).  The Steelers have Mitchell and Thomas already. There is zero reason to draft a backup safety in round 3 or 4 when you could potentially get a freak TE like Jesse James to groom for when Heath inevitability declines now that he's 32.
steelers,33pr7k,tonytroz,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:59:06 2015 UTC,All the guys brought in for pre-draft visits were 5th round guys or later.    Jesse James is a 4th round projected guy that makes way more sense for the Steelers according to every major source out there over a 4th round backup safety.

steelers,33owyl,dmremic,3,Fri Apr 24 08:27:43 2015 UTC,I don't think you guys are doing the stats right.. Or the base comparison is not right. I think its more.impt that 7 of 9 picks came from oredraft visits than 7 of 34 visitors.. They could have had 80 visitors..
steelers,33owyl,akmalhot,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:34:51 2015 UTC,Just me.  Bear in mind that this idea popped in my head at 3am in the middle of a 5hour drive.
steelers,33owyl,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:38:38 2015 UTC,"Per (http://www.steelersdepot.com/2014/04/steelers-2014-pre-draft-visit-tracker/) the Steelers hosted 34 potential draft picks in 2014, prior to the NFL draft.  The Steelers had 9 picks in the NFL draft last year.  7 of 34 Steeler pre-draft visits were drafted.  Or, 14.7% of pre-draft visits ended up on the Steeler roster.  Adjusted for players cut/released, only 7 of 9 players drafted will be on the Steelers roster starting in 2015, or 77.8%.  Further adjusted for players the Steelers did not host for pre-draft visits, only 5 of 9 2014 pre-draft visits will be on the roster at the start of 2015.  Or, 55.6%.  Now I slept through all the statistics classes I took a decade or so ago. But I think this can be calculated as follows;  (14.7%) * (55.6%) = 8.2%  What is 8.2%?  8.2% should be the likelihood that a pre-draft visit is drafted by the Steelers, and will be on the roster after 1-season.    And yes, I know my sample size is too small."
steelers,33owyl,rhino43grr,4,Fri Apr 24 08:40:12 2015 UTC,"You are kind of really misrepresenting the stats.  You say only 14% of our pre draft visits were picked, but 7 of our 9 picks were pre draft visit guys which is about 78%.  That completely changes how that stat should be viewed.  Using your stat at the end, we have the other 255+ college players who didn't take pre drafy visits with us, and 2 are still on the roster.  That means there is at best a .7% chance a non pre draft visit makes it on the roster a year later.  You are talking about a full magnitude of difference between pre draft guys and non pre draft guys.  Pre draft guys are 10x more like to be picked and on the roster.  That is huge."
steelers,33owyl,rhino43grr,2,Fri Apr 24 15:20:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's completely faulty logic. If they had 9 picks, they couldn't pick any more than 9 of the 34 pre-draft visitors (unless they just traded down and amassed 34 picks). He's basically saying that because the chance of any randomly-selected player from the group of 34 who came for a pre-draft visit being drafted by the Steelers was low, the pre-draft visits are meaningless as a predictor.  Meanwhile, as you said, they used ~78% of their available draft picks on players who had visited, so there's clearly a much higher likelihood they take someone who's visited at any given pick than someone who didn't visit."
steelers,33owyl,rhino43grr,0,Sun Apr 26 03:15:26 2015 UTC,"There are undrafted free agents.  The Steelers could potentially sign up to 100% of all pre-draft visits, however this is contingent upon several pre-draft visits not be drafted (not likely but possible nonetheless).  The logic is sound, the person questioning the logic is having a knee-jerk reaction to the logic."
steelers,33owyl,rhino43grr,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:35:26 2015 UTC,"There are 31 other teams in the NFL. Most of the prospects who come in for visits are expected to be drafted. Proving that any randomly-selected player who visited only has a 14% chance of ending up a Steeler isn't predictive of anything. There are a finite number of draft picks, and your brilliant analysis completely ignores the likelihood of other teams drafting players who have visited the Steelers. If we subtract the 34 visitors from the top 300 college players entering the NFL, a top 300 player not brought in for a visit only has a 0.75% chance of being drafted by the Steelers. That's pretty compelling evidence that pre-draft visits do, in fact, matter."
steelers,33owyl,rhino43grr,0,Wed Apr 29 14:24:35 2015 UTC,"You hilariously missed a critical point I made.  Pre-draft visits are only primarily indicative of Steeler targets in late rounds.  But, please continue your pontificating... It is actually amazing."

steelers,33owyl,CeeBeast,0,Sun Apr 26 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"So I found this to be quite interesting, and dug deeper.  In 2013 the Steelers drafted 5 of 30 pre-draft visits.  Or 16.7%.  The Steelers did host their 1st RD pick for a visit.  Only 3 of 5 predraft visits will be on the 2015 roster.  Only 10% of predraft visits from 2013 draft class are on the current Steeler roster.  In 2012 the Steelers drafted 4 of 30 pre draft visits, or 13.3%.  Only 50% of predraft visits are on the current Steelers roster.  The Steelers DID NOT host their 1st RD pick.  6.7% of predraft visits are on the current Steeler roster.  In 2011 the Steelers drafted 3 of 30 predraft visits, or 10%.  2 of 3 predraft visits are on current Steeler roster.  The Steelers DID NOT host their 1st RD pick.  6.7% of predraft visits are on the current Steeler roster.  In 2010 the Steelers drafted 2 of 30 predraft visits, or 6.7%.  Both picks are on current roster.  The Steelers did host their 1st Rd pick.    So.. ........  Over a 5-year period, a predraft visit has an 8.96% chance of making the roster, staying on the roster, and possibly having his contract renewed.  Over a 5-year period, 60% of Steeler 1st RD picks were pre-draft visits.  In conclusion; LT for 2015 1st RD pick."
steelers,33owyl,ColdNose,3,Fri Apr 24 09:21:12 2015 UTC,I read everything and I still don't get why the Steelers will draft a LT with their first?
steelers,33owyl,ColdNose,-2,Fri Apr 24 11:00:43 2015 UTC,"Haha.  I wanted to show that pre-draft visits aren't a ""good"" indicator of who the Steelers will draft in RDs 1 or 2.  I would think that with my analysis, I have shown this.  I would totally agree that pre-draft visits are a great indicator of late round targets.  But when it comes to rounds 1&2 (for sure), and potentially extended to (3&4), Pittsburgh targets the best player at a position of need.  In a separate post I have established that LT truly is a need.    A point that was brought up against the drafting of LT was, ""hey... We haven't had any for a predraft visit, so it ain't happenin' brah.""  Well numbers don't lie."
steelers,33owyl,ColdNose,2,Fri Apr 24 11:15:41 2015 UTC,Wait? You said that 7 of our 9 draft picks last year visited first.
steelers,33owyl,ColdNose,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:38:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that means 27 visitors weren't picked by the Steelers and 27 is more than 7 so the Steelers didn't draft most of the guys who visited. He's completely ignoring the fact that the Steelers started out with 9 picks (and thus couldn't possibly draft more than 26.5% of the visitors unless they traded down to get more picks) in some twisted attempt to prove pre-draft visitors are somehow not an indication of players the Steelers plan to draft (even though they used 77.8% of their picks on guys who visited last year)."
steelers,33owyl,rhino43grr,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:26:36 2015 UTC,I get the numbers but I think a better indication would be if they had that position in for a pre-draft visit. You can't always bank on the players being available at the spot you had them. However having 9ish CBs visit and 0 OTs visit would suggest to me that they aren't going with a tackle with their first pick UNLESS a La'el Collins falls to them and their top picks at CB/OLB are gone.

steelers,33i37f,SicaBiasThrowaway,2,Wed Apr 22 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"The only two offensive players from Kentucky that got combine invites were RB Braylen Heard, and G Darian Miller.  Neither are very impressive, and both are likely to be late round picks, or undrafted.  I am guessing he just went along, and they were all looking at Dupree, but maybe he likes one of the two listed above.    My guess between the two would be Heard.  57th ranked player in the country coming out of high school, went to Nebraska, then transferred to Kentucky since he was behind Ameer Abdullah, and Rex Burkhead, and is an undersized RB, with good hands from what I can find.  Haley seems to have a liking for undersized RBs, that can be, or that he hopes can be, receiving threats (McCluster in KC, and Archer here).  Heard's athleticism is a clear step or two below those two though."

The Browns have serious issues in their front office. Either it's a work program for the mentally retarded or they all enjoy the Johnny Manziel go go powder, either way the Browns have NO EXCUSE for not being one of the best teams in the league.

steelers,33f4hl,Empeaux,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:19:51 2015 UTC,I was really hoping someone would ask because I'm clueless too.
steelers,33f4hl,Diarygirl,0,Wed Apr 22 15:11:33 2015 UTC,"More context: Anthony Smith was the little shit behind this nonsense. Yeah we were up big, but heading into that 2006 Week 15 game at 6-7, we were on the outside looking in for the playoffs and there was no time for showboating like that. Clearly, Dick LeBeau agreed. So then fast forward a year, the Patriots were 12-0 and destroying every team that came their way...except for a close call against the Baltimore Ravens in the most recent game, which gave them motivation heading into the Pittsburgh game. So then Anthony Smith, starting next to Tyrone Carter while both Ryan Clark and Troy Polamalu were injured, thought it would be a good idea to give them more motivation and ""guarantee a victory."" Let alone the Pats winning big, they specifically targeted Smith and made him one of the goats of the game.  And then there's this, where DeAngelo Williams is saying ""I've had a great career, and the Patriots could have had me but instead they took a bust in Laurence Maroney. It's what drives me to have the great career I've had!"" I guess it's ""fringe Anthony Smith"" in the sense that it dares to say something negative about the Patriots...but the difference is that unlike Smith, Williams has a point."
steelers,33f4hl,Steinerway,-1,Wed Apr 22 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"Difference is that Williams can back it up. Smith was just some backup that everyone already hated, making a guarantee when it was already pretty evident that the Pats would go undefeated. What are they going to say about Williams' statement to use as motivation? ""He said WHAT??? How DARE he...ok yeah he has a point."""
steelers,33f4hl,Steinerway,2,Wed Apr 22 19:40:15 2015 UTC,Anthony Smith was a starter lol
steelers,33f4hl,huhwhatweird,-1,Wed Apr 22 19:47:34 2015 UTC,Due to both Ryan Clark and Polamalu being out...

steelers,33f4hl,huhwhatweird,-2,Wed Apr 22 22:18:04 2015 UTC,So DeAngelo Williams is equal to Anthony Smith. Wow. Today I learned.
steelers,33f4hl,Steinerway,2,Wed Apr 22 22:51:34 2015 UTC,"Never stated that, so you didn't learn that from me."
steelers,33f4hl,huhwhatweird,-2,Wed Apr 22 23:01:26 2015 UTC,"Well you did just try to draw a parallel between some cocky little shit of a safety forced into starting a game due to injuries to both starters making a foolish guarantee of beating a powerhouse in the third quarter of what had already been the greatest single season of all time, and a well-respected, genuinely great guy, former Pro Bowler and All Pro who was actively seeked out when he was a free agent, stating what motivates him...so I'm really not sure what I learned from you at all or what your point is."
steelers,33f4hl,Steinerway,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:20:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of what you said is inaccurate.  Anthony Smith started 10 games that season. Ryan Clark went down in week 7 then Anthony Smith started the rest of the season. So that's 10 games not ""a game"". Troy missing time due to injury had nothing to do with Anthony Smith, Tyrone Carter was his backup. Lastly, my biggest thing is that DeAngelo Williams shouldn't need anymore motivation to go out and give it his all, any given week."
steelers,33f4hl,huhwhatweird,-1,Wed Apr 22 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"There's a limit to how much motivation one should have?  Tomlin's famous quote concerning Smith was ""I'll tolerate you until I can replace you."" The point is that Smith was merely what they had and what they could go with at the time. As opposed to, again, Williams who they actively seeked out and offered a contract with the intention of starting him for at least a game or two. There is absolutely no reason to think of Smith when seeing Williams' post."

steelers,33f01e,steelbydesign,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:13:45 2015 UTC,"St Louis is definitely a good defensive team. but their offense is still unproven. With Nick Foles, they are a unknown team. I'm guessing they take a corner back or OL in the draft. That will be a factor if whoever they take can start from Week 1 because the rest of their secondary is weak. Janoris Jenkins has yet to excel from his rookie season, and everyone else is mediocre at best. I feel there best bet is to draft a corner back, but that's just me"
steelers,33f01e,tstscavo,2,Wed Apr 22 13:50:51 2015 UTC,"Rams fan checking in (my dad is a Steelers fan so I lurk around here every so often) and I think that the best case scenario is grabbing Brandon Scherff in the draft.  Janoris Jenkins is definitely inconsistent, but E.J. Gaines has shown quite a bit of improvement and Trumaine Johnson can (mostly) hold his own when he needs to.  Our safeties also improved loads throughout last season and hopefully will come back stronger.  Our secondary is definitely our weakest link on defense, but as long as they don't give up multiple huge passes (looking at you Jenkins!) the defense usually fairs well.  I would rather take Scherff over a CB like Waynes simply because we have three spots on O-Line that are currently in very rough shape.  If we grab Scherff and re-sign Barksdale we will have a better line than we have in a while, albeit still not an incredible one."

steelers,33f01e,TheChuck03,4,Wed Apr 22 14:54:47 2015 UTC,I don't mean to sound offensive but you obviously have no idea how NFL schedules are decided. Everything is predetermined. The NFL doesn't get to decide who plays who. They do however decide when each game takes place. If you want to know exactly how the schedule is decided just ask.

Eh, a little late, but right before Seattle, which will help our players adjust. - New England, SF, and STL all possibly without Bell? With NE and STL on the road? We can survive 1-2 and still make some waves. - Wow, no back-to-back road games until Week 16 & 17... this isn't going to be too bad... - And we get Oakland (one of the games we will absolutely lose) in between Cincinnati and Cleveland? I can live with that. - Denver has to come to Heinz Field on December 20th?? I am very okay with that. - 12-4 confirmed."

San Francisco is a dumpster fire with a highly questionable new coach and a QB who hasn't improved at all since the read-option fad ended three years ago. This isn't 2012 anymore. I'm not really too worried about the Rams, either. Their defense is good, but their offense is shit. They're not automatic wins, but I think we have a better chance to win those two than lose, even without Bell."

steelers,33f02p,President_Puddles,5,Wed Apr 22 00:05:25 2015 UTC,This is gonna be fun.    Edit: saying bell sits 3 only have to go against the 49ers and rams after the patriots. This gives us Bell with fresh legs against the ravens week 4 and we also get the bye week during the 11th week with the seahawks the 12th week. That gives us good time to recover and prepare for the away game on the west coast.

steelers,33f02p,badgarok725,2,Wed Apr 22 01:57:08 2015 UTC,"This looks incredibly challenging. A very late bye gives us a critically timed rest before the murderers row we're running down the last 6 games but that's a long time to weather injuries. I can easily see 10 - 6 this season, say losses to the Patriots, Rams, Seahawks, Ravens, Bengals (I don't see a sweep), Cardinals. Still a very viable path to the playoffs but this will be much tougher than last year."
steelers,33f02p,hobbeswasright_,2,Wed Apr 22 02:08:52 2015 UTC,"If the Steelers come through this terrible schedule with a record of 10-6 or better, I really feel like they would be a hard, battle-tested team that is ready to win some playoff games."

steelers,33f02p,ShaquilleO_feel,5,Wed Apr 22 03:10:05 2015 UTC,"So let's break down this schedule, try some super-early predictions, and comment on what might be in store for us. Right out the gate, I'll say this is a bloody fucking hard schedule, and if Bell's appeal doesn't decrease his suspension I really don't think we have a good chance of taking the division. Playoffs are still a possibility though.  PIT @ NE  I don't think I'm alone or even in the minority when I say our chance of winning this game approaches 0%. We will be out Bell for one, but the death nail is that it's the damn Patriots at home - they've had our number for over a decade. Just write this one off now and stock up your liquor cabinets for the season opener. 0-1  SF @ PIT  Our home opener, against a team that has been gutted by the offseason. I'm extremely confident in predicting a win for this one even without Bell - the loss of Willis, Borland, and possibly even Bowman will make their run stop much weaker than normal. Plus, I'm already seeing the 49ers having a top 5 draft pick in 2016. 1-1  PIT @ STL  A tough match-up that shouldn't be underestimated. That Rams D-Line is nasty, as we all know - I think this outcome will depend on how our O-Line performs, especially with Bell possibly being absent yet again. The Rams secondary is relatively weak though, and I think AB can have a mean game here. I'm optimistic for this one. 2-1  BAL @ PIT  We burned the Ravens in our house last year, so I think it's reasonable to predict we'll do it again this year, especially early in the season when injuries are less of a problem. Additionally, it's possible that Bell could be back in time for this game - time will tell. The outcome of this game could rest on that appeal. So at this point, after this game no matter how the appeal goes Bell will be back. Luckily, I think the only game that's completely unwinnable without Bell during this first 4-game stretch is the opener against the Pats, and even with Bell I don't think that one's winnable. Amazingly, we might have gotten off easy here, schedule-wise. 3-1  PIT @ SD  This will be a MNF game after a TNF game, thus giving us a long week to rest. Additionally, Bell will definitely be back for this game, and especially if this is his first game back he will have a chip on his shoulder and something to prove. The Chargers are tough opponents, but this is definitely winnable. 4-1  ARI @ PIT  Here's where things start getting really hard. Remember just how good the Cardinals were before Palmer was injured - they are no pushover by any means. However, this is a home game, and with Bell back, we aren't pushovers either. I'm going to be optimistic here, especially this early. 5-1  PIT @ KC  Another opponent that isn't a pushover. Since this is an away game against a decent team, this is kind of a toss-up that can't be reasonably predicted until the season proper. The Chiefs' acquisition of Maclin will be a serious danger for our secondary that they didn't have last year, and they fought a close game last year. Nevertheless, this early I'll be optimistic yet again. 6-1  CIN @ PIT  This is a home game, combined with the fact that I strongly believe the Bengals will take a significant step back this year. They couldn't beat us at all last year, so I'm pretty damn confident in calling this one a likely win. 7-1  OAK @ PIT  We are cursed against the Raiders. I still don't think they're that great yet, but they still shouldn't be underestimated. Nevertheless, I'm superstitious when it comes to these kinds of match-ups, as I'm sure we all are. The streak ends. 7-2  CLE @ PIT  Cleveland's run of false hope last year was kind of a fluke. When Hoyer noticeably dropped off in his quality last year, the Browns took a major dive. I think there's even more questions at QB and WR this year than last year, and the Browns take a step back yet again, as they always do. 8-2  Bye  Latest possible bye, repeating our luck from last year. This will be extremely crucial, because the remaining 6 games are no goddamn joke. Don't want to fall back into a rut.  PIT @ SEA  As much as I want to be optimistic here considering we're just coming off a bye, I also hold no illusions in this modern league that few teams march into CenturyLink and come out victorious. I underestimated the Seahawks last year and don't plan on doing so again. 8-3  IND @ PIT  I actually overestimated the Colts last year, predicting them to beat us in our own house when that game came around. I'm not making that mistake again, so I predict we burn that mediocre defense and rebound after the loss to the Seahawks. 9-3  PIT @ CIN  Again, the Bengals couldn't beat us at all last year and I am extremely confident in predicting they won't break 8-8 in 2015. We beat them in their house. 10-3  DEN @ PIT  This one is really tough to call. On one hand, the Broncos have been dominant behind Manning for three years now. On the other hand, I think they will decline this year - I was very confident we could beat them in the playoffs last year, and was more afraid of the Ravens (and I was vindicated). Despite their YA last year, the Denver defense is IMO overrated - the PA stat is much more telling as to the quality of a defense. This can go either way, but with the division title potentially on the line, I think we can come through. We've stepped up against teams believed better than us a lot in recent years. 11-3  PIT @ BAL  This is the tough one. This is the one that terrifies me, more than any other game on this schedule. Coming into this game with our postseason prospects on the line is my worst nightmare. So hopefully it doesn't come to that. With the suspension of Bell, the hated Ratbirds are actually my ""favorite"" to win the AFCN, as heretical as that might be. They are a scary, well-rounded team and we've almost always split our series. They crushed us in their house last year, and that was early in the season. With potential injuries stacking up by this point in the season...I'm not optimistic about this one. Just pray it doesn't come down to this game. 11-4  PIT @ CLE  Impossible to call this one. We split with the Browns last year, but I think they'll regress this year. Nevertheless, this late in the season...only time will tell. I'll go the optimistic route. 12-4  That puts our record at a well-rounded 12-4, which would definitely be in the race for the division title and even a postseason bye week. This is an extremely optimistic prediction - it was my hope before the news of Bell's long suspension came out, but this schedule doesn't look too terrifying while we're without him. Nevertheless, I think a reasonable range for our record can be anywhere between 10-6 and 13-3. I am in full hype mode and can definitely see us as a major playoff contender in 2015."
steelers,33f02p,The_YoungWolf,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:20:40 2015 UTC,"I'd switch the outcomes of Oakland, KC, IND, and one of the CIN games. We lose to Oakland because it's always at Oakland, and we play at home this year. We only play two west coast games this year, both coming with extra rest. KC I can see a loss, the stadium is just as loud as CenturyLink and their defense is great. Their upgraded offense will also pose problems as they played us extremely close last year. IND will be a different team this year, they were very young last year and I think Luck will learn from our first game played. And I don't think CIN will regress as much as you think, a split is very likely in any divisional matchup anyways. Optimistically predicting 13-3, at worst I think we go 9-7."

steelers,33e17a,autopilot_music,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:55:34 2015 UTC,"The generating pass rush part is what scares me. Relying on pssibly our greatest weakness to win a game. I have faith Williams will be an adequate stopgap for T.O.P, I don't like Brady's developed chemistry with LaFell, who could possibly torch our secondary a la Aaron Dobson in 2013."
steelers,33e17a,TotallyAGG,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"Not saying it will be easy. But Brady does not do well when he's getting hit. You can say the same for a lot of qbs across the league.   It will be an interesting way to start the season, wish he had Bell but what can you do. At least we get to watch the steelers in primetime week 1!   Edit: We also get the Thursday night game out of the way early."

steelers,33e17a,babyfarmer,-1,Wed Apr 22 00:43:31 2015 UTC,Objectively? The SB champs have an almost perfect record at home since the NFL started the Thursday night kickoffs. And the Steelers are without their best player. It's not a stretch at all to predict the Pats winning this game.

steelers,33e0lj,chaz_batch,2,Tue Apr 21 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great point. Little to no tape for BB and Brady to study, Pats generally start the season slow. I'd say early is better against the Pats, even without Bell. I still don't give us much of a chance though."

steelers,33e0lj,Diarygirl,3,Tue Apr 21 21:02:20 2015 UTC,I want to be positive but we're playing the Pats at home in the first regular season game since they won the SB.
steelers,33e0lj,Zeolyssus,0,Wed Apr 22 00:46:07 2015 UTC,"I think if we run more man coverage and consistently pressure Brady it can work, our offense is as good if not better than theirs."
steelers,33e0lj,steelbydesign,2,Wed Apr 22 15:24:01 2015 UTC,They averaged over 29 PPG last season... We averaged just over 27.   Doesn't seem like a ton but take Le'Veon Bell out of the equation and I definitely don't see us being a better offense.
steelers,33e0lj,Zeolyssus,0,Wed Apr 22 15:43:14 2015 UTC,"They also had a great defense that opened up their offense  even more, I don't think we are leaks and bounds ahead of them offensively but I do think we are pretty even."
steelers,33e0lj,stuckmeformypaper,2,Wed Apr 22 15:56:34 2015 UTC,I think all the extra adversity will bring out the best in Ben. But if Keith Butler runs a bunch of zone we will get torn apart.
steelers,33e0lj,Airith0,2,Tue Apr 21 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"No revis goes a long way to open up the backfield. Hopefully the loss of wilfork can help the line keep Ben safe. If we can get some help on defense I think Ben can bring home a tough, well earned, early season win over the pats."

steelers,33f7zz,1234acenc,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:38:06 2015 UTC,"So this same thing happened to me. Today May 3, 2015 at Hanes mall, an african american gentleman came up to me and asked if I had an money. He's like my mercedez is running and i locked myself out of the car. My daughter has a spare but shes in concord mills. Can you spare like 19 bucks for me to get a taxi to her house. We get to talking. he's like my names delton hall, I played as cornerback for the steelers, look me up. so i did just that and only found younger photos. The guy in question is about 6 foot. receding hairline. missing one or two teeth on his left side. I'm young and not into sports and think nothing of it. he's well dressed too and we talk. He then asks if I could possibly do 40 for gas. I'm like sure no problem cause I was raised to be helpful and have never had a bad experience with people. So i go and get 40 from my bank which is right down the road from the mall. I wait a few cause if he really did need some cash then he'd stay. I come back after half hour or so and he's waiting where i left him. So we talk and he's like yeah im having a house warming party on Wednesday, heres my number. My phones almost dead and i need it to call the taxi back. He leaves with and ill call when i come back and ill give you a hundred dollars, can you meet me in the food court or right here. im like yeah sure no problem. I wait around and when i have to leave im like son of a gun ive been scammed. I now feel like an idiot and have now became more determined to just deny people of their request from now on. Thanks for posting this SmokrsKoff, we need to raise awareness of this scam that is going on cause stealing from kind people is not right. It just makes us to not be kind people and causes everyone to struggle. Wherever you are sir I hope your kind christian ways go straight to hell."

Hopefully this is the year we finally blow up the coaching staff and salvage the last couple years of Roethlisbergers career. Watching them try to establish the run with a 3rd string RB against the Ravens poor secondary was the final straw for me. Tomlin does not know how to game plan."

I also feel you've got Huerman going a round early. With the mid round TEs (Huerman, Kroft, James, Koyack) all being roughly equivalent to each other I'd be content to take whoever is available in the 4th."
steelers,33dr5p,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Tue Apr 21 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"Fair points. I'm a big Heuerman fan so I probably have him more highly rated than most. I agree with you on the Diggs being more of the same. Sans Martavis Bryant, the team just seems to love speedy middle round receivers who stand around 6'0 tall (Wallace, Brown, Sanders, Wheaton) so that is why I went that route."

I could see a scenario where he and Moats trade off pass rush, and running downs but I don't see him ever being a full-time starter. He's kind of a puss to be completely honest. Too finesse for my liking. I'd rather take a chance on a high upside guy like Danielle Hunter at that pick.  Really like the Doran Grant pick. He reminds me a little bit of a bigger Antwon Blake."
steelers,33dr5p,defenstrationaccount,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:20:57 2015 UTC,"I like it. If we have to stick with the two-DE rotation, we should draft someone for that position this year. Cam Thomas doesn't deserve an NFL roster spot.  I'm comfortable with Tuitt-McCullers-Heyward anchoring the line, but it's always good to have options."

steelers,33cwbq,heavymedicine,15,Tue Apr 21 14:36:31 2015 UTC,I think the most obvious choice now is a WR. With Brown wanting more money we have no choice but to cut him.  /s
steelers,33cwbq,-deteled-,15,Tue Apr 21 14:44:04 2015 UTC,Are you a fucking idiot or something? Everyone knows Punter has been our weakest position for years now. That will be the obvious first rounder.
steelers,33cwbq,dj0,6,Tue Apr 21 16:25:12 2015 UTC,Completely forgot about the punter issue. Might need to trade up for a quality guy
steelers,33cwbq,-deteled-,3,Tue Apr 21 16:34:52 2015 UTC,"I think a positive from all this is that we've found a quality backup in Brad Wing, he should be around to mentor and carry the towel of whoever it is we draft (I'm not sure who that'll be, this draft is rich with top punter talent). He also fills our Australian quota."
steelers,33cwbq,IDontNeedThisIndigo,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"I see your /s tag... but I don't think WR is completely out of the question.  The team has had Perriman, Parker, and Strong in for visits. Tomlin showed a lot of interest in Parker at the Lou pro day.  I don't think it's completely because they think Brown will be gone, but it can't hurt either."
steelers,33cwbq,steelbydesign,5,Tue Apr 21 14:51:14 2015 UTC,I think we will probably draft a WR at some point. We love drafting starting WRs late

steelers,33cwbq,steelbydesign,2,Tue Apr 21 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"La'el Collins - He might be the best overall player available at pick 22 and is a high character guy that Colbert seeks in the first round. Ramon Foster is due a contract next season, and Collins is a perfect LG replacement candidate.  I'm going outside round 1 and hope we land Hau'oli Kikaha"
steelers,33cwbq,hellomynameis,2,Tue Apr 21 14:45:50 2015 UTC,Really like Kikaha but his injuries concern me a bit.
steelers,33cwbq,tolas,5,Tue Apr 21 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"This is a tough question. I think WR, OT, TE, and S are all realistic options in that order. If Davante Parker is there I think he's the pick, but I don't think he will be. I've heard they like TJ Clemmings and would kick Beachum inside to RG. Danielle Hunter - OLB I would love to get an edge rusher in the 1st because CB is so deep in rounds 2/3. I don't think one we like falls though. Hunter is extremely raw, and I see him as a 2nd or 3rd... But my god does he have an incredible frame and motor. You can't teach size, speed, length, and get-after-it but you can teach him how to use his hands. Get another 10 pounds on this kid and you may have an unblock-able machine. I know you said 1 name, but I love Preston Smith too. He'd be a force right away."
steelers,33cwbq,hellomynameis,2,Tue Apr 21 14:58:38 2015 UTC,I like Preston Smith's tape a lot but I have no idea where he'd play in our defense.

steelers,33cwbq,hellomynameis,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:04:45 2015 UTC,Possibly but I think there are legitimate concerns over whether or not he could do anything in coverage.
steelers,33cwbq,Orangepeelss,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:51:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say list him as the strong side OLB - but play him all over the place.  The Ravens successfully took a college DT (from the same school, same scheme, same position), Pernell McPhee and made him a LB.   Smith is VERY similar. And if the Steelers want to play this bybrid scheme like they say they do he's a great weapon to have as a DE, or even an interior rusher which he did a lot in school."
steelers,33cwbq,NotJoeyWheeler,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah he is like McPhee, but generally we ask our OLBs to cover more than the Ravens do. Who knows if that'll be the case under Butler."

steelers,33cwbq,dmremic,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"I think we trade out of the first round. There's gonna be someone at the top of the second round who doesn't get Mariota or Winston and wants to get Hundley before Arizona could potentially take him at 24. I could see maybe the Jets or Bears wanting to leap over the Cardinals, and us getting something like a 2015 2nd rounder and a 2015 3rd rounder/2016 2nd rounder in return, and I would be 100% down with that. I don't know if there will be any ""special"" players left at 22, and we can get more value this way by getting the best of the next tier of players.     Also, and this is just wild, completely crazy speculation, but I think we draft either Quinten Rollins or Nick Marshall. For some reason, we like taking fliers on ""raw"" corner prospects (remember Cortez and even Ike?), and Colbert has a history of taking converted QBs. I think Marshall could be a good fit as a PR/KR, nickel/dime corner, and occasional gadget play quarterback. He could also prove really useful as a scout team QB, as we're going to be playing Seattle AND San Fran next year, two teams who are have mobile QBs and run a fair amount of zone read, something that's been a problem as of late for our defense."

Then lasted only 2 games with the Dolphins, who released him after he got in a fight in a night club. Then he mouthed off his way off the 49ers. Finally, he was released by a team in the CFL for sexual assault.   He's (shockingly) currently serving 31 years for multiple felony assault charges.  Point goes to the Steelers."

And while the reporters have a point in what they say (yes, Antonio Brown should deserve around the same money as the leagues other top WRs), NOBODY in the NFL should be making even near one hundred million dollars in the course of their careers. Heck, I'm not sure if any line of work in the world is worth that kind of money. It's absurd. And as much as people like me love sports as an entertainment, it just doesn't seem right.   On the bright side, many super rich athletes like to spend a lot of money in a blur, so it sort of ""evens out"" the situation...   And about that reporter thing... I wish they'd find another way of saying how Brown ""should make more money"". The way we speak about things and the words we use have a crucial effect on the way we think about things.

People like football, so the NFL makes it more expensive to consume, so athletes get paid more, so prices increase, etc. etc.  Maybe instead of having an hour of commercials in every game, athletes should just not get paid a metric asslode."
steelers,338t7c,Opuski,4,Mon Apr 20 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, the athletes are making a tiny fraction of the overall revenue the league pulls in. The NFL is a huge operation of administrators, managers, coaches, trainers, players, etc. All of them contribute to an entertainment experience that we all enjoy. Moreover, we get it pretty cheap too. In theory, you don't have to spend a dime to watch football (assuming you already have a TV and an antenna). Cutting out commercials would mean either having a worse product, or paying for it in other ways."
steelers,338t7c,Opuski,0,Mon Apr 20 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"Sad, but true. On the other hand, it's not just about how much the fans are spending to support the NFL. The league's income is tax free, because it's defined as a non-profit organization. Which smells corrupt, to say the least."
steelers,338t7c,dj0,0,Mon Apr 20 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"""The NFL League Office isnât the only professional sports league to have non-profit status. The National Hockey League (NHL), the Professional Golf Association (PGA), the Ladiesâ Professional Golf Association (LPGA), and the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) are other leagues that have this exemption. In fact, Major League Baseball was tax-exempt until 2007. According to MLB spokesman Matt Bourne, the league gave up their status because âThere was no business or other benefit for us to have the exemption, so we made the decision to relinquish it.â  Despite the NFL League Office being within their legal bounds, Tom Coburn, Republican Senator from Oklahoma, as of the publication date of this article is trying to find a way to change their status. On September 13, 2013, Coburn introduced a bill to the Senate floor called the PRO Sports Act (S. 1524) which lists the sports leagues that have central offices that are protected under Section 501(c). It goes on to explain,  **Major professional sports leagues qualify by stating their purpose is to help their respective sports at large, though they devote most of their activities to promoting their specific brand.** ""   http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/01/nfl-tax-exempt/"

I think that it's implied that saying he deserves more money is in the context of the NFL and comparing AB to guys at this position. It's a write up about Brown's value compared to other WR's.  Not a discussion on what pro athletes should be paid.
steelers,338t7c,stuckmeformypaper,-1,Mon Apr 20 19:57:29 2015 UTC,"I understand that. Still, it has an effect on the way we think about things, and your site must have quite a lot of visitors, too. Even when such stuff is implied, I'd be much happier if we talked about things the way they are. In reality, AB does not deserve any more money. And I understand that you are not a reporter, but even if you'd be talking to a single stranger about how someone in the line of pro sports deserves more money - may it be in a discussion about sports - I'd expect anyone to try and find a more correct expression.   Now, I probably sound like an arrogant prick, who thinks only I'm perfect in this imperfect world. This isn't the case, though (i hope).

If he fucks around now and demands money, that's putting the team at a disadvantage in signing other people we need (Cam Heyward, etc).  Just be patient.  If we pay him more now, it's coming out of someone's salary or potential salary.  I know he's not guaranteed to be healthy next year, but the Steelers have a plan and a formula.  If you start messing with it now, it put the team in a bad situation and leaves the fans pissed off."

Until I came here today, all I've read is the scathing remarks all over Facebook and news sources about what a dishonorable thing this is to do.   Sorry, but he is at least an 8 year $60-$75 million guy at this point in his career. Yes he signed a contract and he has proven that he is worth much more than he makes (in terms of NFL salaries). If you were a low-level lawyer at a large firm and you brought in a client whose case settled in the hundreds of millions, you better believe you'd be getting a bump.

steelers,338mtj,red5_SittingBy,10,Mon Apr 20 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"Because we didn't have an average RB as a backup. RB's aren't a premium position. We've seen time and time again that teams with average to above average RB's can have a solid run game as long as they have a good offensive line. Considering what elite running backs ask for, I would rather pay for offensive lineman and save money by having good but not great RB's. Yes that means we have to find one of those since we don't have one."

It just seems like we've never had a feature back after Bettis left. We've been burning through them up until Le'Veon.  If I had to pick between Le'Veon and Bell Brown though, I'd take Bell. The front office seems to have receivers figured out when it comes to the draft. We can't really say the same about running backs."

As was Staley for his first year here. You can have a good running game without a feature running back. And I assume you'd take Bell over Brown and not Bell over Le'Veon.
steelers,338mtj,maltrab,2,Mon Apr 20 16:30:08 2015 UTC,"Key words being ""while he was here"", ""year or two"", ""first year"". Parker couldn't pass block at all, if Mendenhall wasn't spinning in the back field, his was fumbling. Duce wasn't bad though.  If we play our cards right, Le'Veon could be here for 6 or 7 years and still have juice left. We just need to find one of those average backs to back him up."
steelers,338mtj,red5_SittingBy,2,Mon Apr 20 16:33:31 2015 UTC,"Parker was still a good RB, as was Mendenhall. Every RB has flaws. How many guys can actually do 100% of the things you want RB's to do? Very few. That's why teams have multiple RB's to fill different roles. Yes Parker wasn't great at catching or blocking, but we used him to his strengths and he played well, and had Mewelde Moore to handle the other things."
steelers,338mtj,maltrab,2,Mon Apr 20 16:37:49 2015 UTC,If you guys think that AB means more to us then Bell based on performance and how Steeler football is played that I completely and wholly give up on all of you.
steelers,338mtj,IdunnoLXG,5,Mon Apr 20 16:36:59 2015 UTC,"We ran the 6th most total plays in football last year.  We had the 6th most passing attempts, and the 15th most rushing attempts.  We had the 2nd most passing yards, and the 16th most rushing yards.  The Texans, Seahawks, Cowboys, and Jets were the only teams to run more than they threw, and the Texans, and Jets did it due to how horrible their QBs were.  The average QB rating in the NFL last year was 87.1.  Before Roethlisberger, O'Donell in '95, and Bradshaw in '75 were the only individual seasons by a QB in Steelers history with at least 200 attempts, and at least an 87.1 rating.  There is no such thing as that style of football anymore, since the NFL made passing so easy.  Teams realize that an average QB is getting them 7.2 y/a now.  Basically a good RB will get .8 more yards in two plays, averaged out over the length of a season, that an average QB will get in one."
steelers,338mtj,RenderedInGooseFat,5,Mon Apr 20 17:24:27 2015 UTC,"You do realize that the NFL has become a passing league yes? And that single RB's, even the great ones, are becoming less and less valuable right? Top WR's are more valuable than top RB's. That's why, if I have to chose (which we probably will with our cap situation), I am taking Antonio Brown."
steelers,338mtj,maltrab,3,Mon Apr 20 16:40:36 2015 UTC,Bell is just as much of a receiving back as he is a running back. This class of WRs are really deep & see us drafting one in the later rounds.
steelers,338mtj,Huskyd,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"that single RB's, even the great ones, are becoming less and less valuable   Then their contracts should reflect as much; I don't disagree that passing has absolutely taken over the league, but then that means RB contracts should level off or even drop (percentage-wise in relation to the cap), yes?"
steelers,338mtj,the_method,2,Mon Apr 20 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"In theory yes. And it has dropped off. But as we saw with Murray and McCoy, the top guys still get paid a lot."

The only guys who I can legitimately say I'd pay more to are the top three.   Right now we have some cap room to maneuver with, plus if he gets a new deal it will likely be an extension, meaning we can back-load some of the money to when the cap room increases a bit more. As unfortunate as this is, it's justified from Antonio Brown's behalf.  We just have to wait and see if the team will play ball. There's no question now as to why we're bringing in top WR prospects for visits. We might need a replacement for him sooner rather than later, and if that's the case, we might trade him for a premium pick come April. Crazy if that happens."

steelers,338mtj,ColdNose,5,Mon Apr 20 15:38:08 2015 UTC,It's not the same circumstances at all.  Ward didn't have a long-term deal at that time.  He was on the last year of his contract and was trying to get an extension to stay with the team long term.  The team was definitely not taking care of Hines like they should have.  AB already has that.  He's already being paid well.  He will have the opportunity to get another contract soon enough.  Holding out now at this point in his contract and career is not cool.
steelers,338mtj,DF_1982,0,Mon Apr 20 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"Ward was still under contract was he not? And of course money had nothing to do with it. He was simply holding out because the team refused to offer him any deal at all.   It's the nature of the NFL. The market is constantly changing and right now Brown has a high market value. In a league where contracts aren't guaranteed, every player is one play away from a career ending injury and teams can and will cut anyone at the drop of a hat, I have a hard time not siding with players wanting to be paid what they deserve. Especially one who is as ridiculously underpaid as Antonio Brown."
steelers,338mtj,DRU_leggo,0,Mon Apr 20 16:04:32 2015 UTC,They are all being paid well. You just said there is no room for holdouts on the steelers and then made an excuse for your favorite player.
steelers,338mtj,Ur_bio_dad,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:32:48 2015 UTC,Why don't you read up on it a bit.  Look at the number of years left and the amount they were each due that year and see if it's the same situation.  Ward did all that he could do not to hold out.  AB is planning it from the very first day of the season.  AB is the third highest paid guy on the team and is going to make damn near 10MM this year and has 3 years left at that price.  Hines was making less than 2MM and was on his last year.

I don't like players holding out either but come on man."
steelers,338mtj,Ur_bio_dad,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:45:28 2015 UTC,"I retract my previous statement then.  I completely forgot about Hines doing that when I wrote it.  It was 10 damn years ago.  What the fuck man... The difference is that AB is contemplating taking off the entire preseason process.  That hurts the team.  Hines did everything else up until the last two weeks and reluctantly held out because the front office was dicking him around.  It still wasn't justified when Hines did it.  But, in looking back, I don't find it to be entirely offensive due to drastically different circumstances."

steelers,338mtj,dj0,2,Mon Apr 20 15:47:24 2015 UTC,"AB's current contract is really great for a former 6th round pick. The problem, of course, is that AB doesn't play like a 6th round pick.  He's under contract for three more seasons, and the Steelers almost never do extensions until the last remaining season. AB also has no choice but to show up to work when mandatory practices get under way. It sucks for him, because he has very little negotiating leverage, despite being one of the best football players in the league right now. But if he can maintain his insane production, he'll get his money eventually."

steelers,338mtj,DriArcher,7,Mon Apr 20 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"Can't blame him. He's way under paid based on the last two seasons of production. Might be an unpopular move but AB could be a cap casualty. With Heyward and DeCastro likely getting deals this offseason and Bell (who lets be honest is a more crucial piece to our offense) on the not too distant horizon it's going to be hard to find the cash to pay Brown like the top 3 WR he is. And it's been pretty obvious in recent years we are willing to let WRs walk. This does explain the highly rated wideouts visiting. Now whether it's legitimate interest or a negotiating ploy, we'll have to wait a few weeks to see."
steelers,338mtj,DRU_leggo,6,Mon Apr 20 15:15:50 2015 UTC,"You can't blame him...  But you also can't feel sorry for him. When he signed his last contract he was getting more than he was worth. He was just coming off his first pro bowl season and got the contract offered to Mike Wallace (who was worth 60 mil on the open market). It sound crazy now, but at the time Mike Wallace was the better receiver and Brown got his contract.  He took the long term deal for financial security and was being paid on potential more than production. Has he out-played that contract? Absolutely. But both sides were gambling and the Steelers ""won.""  Cortez Allen was sort of a similar situation with the opposite result. Is Cortez giving any money back?"

The teams up against the cap as it is and that's with a lot of key players on rookie deals. I don't want to see AB go but emotions aside, giving him a big deal is really going to make signing the younger guys that I mentioned difficult. Would losing Heyward and DeCastro along with not being able to sign some of the mid-level FAs that we often bring in be worth it to give Brown his much deserved pay day?"

In all likelihood, that's just ordinary due diligence for BPA candidates in the event the corners and OLBs they like are not there in the first.   But I can't help but wonder if perhaps the Steelers front office may have gotten a whiff that AB may be angling for a new deal and a potential holdout and perhaps they may be looking for an insurance policy should the situation worsen.  Yes...I know thats a stretch....but I continue to be a bit surprised at the level of interest they've shown in WRs as the offseason has progressed."

I'm even on the side of contracts being fully guaranteed dollars if the team cuts a player.

It's the same thing with any job.  If you worked at a business, and you were getting paid 40k a year.  But you were one of the best employees, I'm sure you'd eventually ask for a raise because you feel like you've earned it and deserve it.  Especially if the guy that works across from you who does the exact same job you do gets pod 60k a year.

Football players, however, don't live in the real world. The Steelers made a gamble that AB was going to be worth his 5-year contract when they signed him. AB knew the terms of that contract. I understand the idea of paying players who outplay their contracts. If the NFL is going to operate on a long-term contract basis, they should have a way to account for players outplaying their contracts. Maybe incentive-based bonuses that apply to all players? I'm not sure what the solution is, but these players are in a contract and they must abide by its rules."

The Steelers took a gamble, and it has paid off with Brown playing better than the contract. It could have gone the other way in which case brown would have made a nice payday and then under-performed. He chose security of pay over potentially bigger money. It was a rational choice at the time."
steelers,33bg2g,237FIF,8,Tue Apr 21 03:52:41 2015 UTC,"Cam Heyward, Kelvin Beachum, and Markus Wheaton are all free agents after next season while DeCastro and Bell become free agents following the 2016-2017 season. Looking at the average salary for players at their position who are of a comparable talent level we can kind of predict how much each guy can be expected to make per year.   Cam Heyward - $7,000,000-$9,000,000 Kelvin Beachum - $4,000,000-$6,500,000 Markus Wheaton - $2,500,00-$5,000,000 David DeCastro - $6,500,000-$8,500,000 Le'Veon Bell - $6,000,000-$8,000,000   Again this is just a rough estimate on my part and should be no means be taken as gospel.  Now the rumor is the salary cap will jump to $150,000,000 in 2016 and the Steelers are currently expected to be around $25,000,000 under the cap that year. Assuming Antonio Brown gets a couple million more per year added on to bump him into the top 5 highest paid receivers let's assume the Steelers will have around $20,000,000 in cap space to spend that offseason before cuts/retirements/reworking contracts . Just looking at the numbers breakdown that $20,000,000 would be enough to bring back Heyward and Beachum and even Wheaton if they wanted to while still having some money leftover. However if they did that it'd be really difficult to bring back DeCastro and Bell next offseason unless the cap jumps again.  It's a rough projection but just looking at the numbers i've got a tough time seeing all five of the players you mentioned being on the roster following the 2016-2017 season. Now given things could very well change depending on exactly what happens with the cap and with certain players (Cortez, Miller, Timmons). If the Steelers do end up needing to let young guys walk i'd expect Wheaton to be the first guy out with Bell or Beachum being next on the chopping block if somebody needs to go."
steelers,33bg2g,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Tue Apr 21 04:30:52 2015 UTC,"We don't have to worry about Bell and Wheaton just yet, they're both under contract for 2016. They become free agents in 2017.  Adding to what you said, we are currently on the books for $120 million for 2016, with the cap expected to be $150 million, as you mentioned. That is around $30 million in cap room, AND DeCastro is already figured into the equation, as we picked up his option already. He counts $8 million against the cap, but again, it's already there.  That means we have $30 million for the following guys:   NT Steve McLendon DE Cameron Heyward DL Cam Thomas LG Ramon Foster QB Bruce Gradkowski CB Antwon Blake FB Will Johnson CB William Gay S Will Allen LS Greg Warren RT Mike Adams WR Darrius Heyward-Bey DE Clifton Geathers ILB Sean Spence DT Matt Conrath TE Michael Egnew LB Terence Garvin S Ross Ventrone LT Kelvin Beachum P Brad Wing G Christopher Hubbard S Robert Golden RB Josh Harris   and a couple other guys, but no one of note. Mostly training camp bodies.  So, taking away $5 million for any potential Antonio Brown pay raise, we still have $25 million for these guys. Heyward will absolutely get extended, and I expect him to take close to $8 million. Then comes Beachum, who I think will be around $6 million. That's $14 million taken up, leaving $11 million.  I think the team keeps Gradkowski, and he will be around $2 million. That leaves $9 million.  I think we keep Foster for around $3 million, as well as P Brad Wing, LS Greg Warren, and FB Will Johnson for $1 million each as well. That leaves $3 million for the following guys:   NT Steve McLendon CB Antwon Blake CB William Gay S Will Allen RT Mike Adams WR Darrius Heyward-Bey DE Clifton Geathers ILB Sean Spence DT Matt Conrath TE Michael Egnew LB Terence Garvin S Ross Ventrone G Christopher Hubbard S Robert Golden RB Josh Harris   This is a very important season for McLendon, as he has to prove his health. His shoulders have become very worrisome. Spence is a question mark. I'd like him to stay, but we're already stacked at the position.  I think we'll likely see a restructure for Ben or someone, to open up some room.   As for 2017, the cap room will likely be around $155 - $158 million, and we're currently on the books for $73 million. Add around $40 million for whatever we do in 2016 (extensions, re-signings, restructurings, etc.) and we're at $113 million. That means we still have close to $40 million in cap room to re-sign RB Le'Ven Bell, OG David DeCastro, LB Lawrence Timmons, TE Heath Miller, TE Matt Spaeth, OLB Jarvis Jones, WR Markus Wheaton, S Shamarko Thomas, and LB Vince Williams. Rough estimates, I think Bell takes up $8 million, DeCastro takes $6 million, Timmons $7 million, Miller $3 million, Spaeth $1.5 million, Jarvis $3 million, Wheaton $3 million, Shamarko $3 million, and Williams $3 million. That adds up to $37.5 million.  All in all, I think we're in pretty good shape. The dead money from Woodley clears up by 2016, and the huge Timmons contract (due to restructurings) is done after 2016."

steelers,33bg2g,loveweed420,2,Wed Apr 22 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"I guess that explains why we tried to avoid spending this offseason even when we had some money to play with. So that cap will roll over.   If I was to rank them in order of importance I would say Hayward is first. Bell is second, although I hate paying a running back that much. Beachum is awesome but at some point it may just make more since to draft a first or second round left tackle.   He are good at drafting receivers. I think I would just let Wheaton walk. Decastro is the hard one. He's worth every penny but the question is do you want to rap that much money up on an interior linemen?   Just looking at your numbers you tossed around, I bet we could find a way to keep Hayward, decastro, and bell. We will most likely restructure and I'm some ways risk the future in order to give Ben good team down his home stretch."

steelers,33bg2g,gimpisgawd,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:12:09 2015 UTC,The cap should go up again. With more retirements and if the organization could talk a few players into restructuring their contracts it's possible.
steelers,33bg2g,Blawdfire,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:00:05 2015 UTC,"It's rough, but you also have to consider that we're running with ~$15M in dead cap space this year. Next year (as of right now) we have none, and the cap is expected to rise another $10M; that's an extra $25M next year right off the bat. It depends on the contracts we give Bell and Decastro imo. Wheaton won't demand anything close to the others and Beachum hasn't had enough consistent solid play (1.5+ years) to demand a lot of money either. I certainly think the massive cap rises will help a ton, but I would expect a cap casualty or two at some point."

steelers,33801w,ColdNose,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"I simply don't buy the RB pick. If they pick and RB it means they have absolutely no faith in Josh Harris, because there is no way that Harris stays on the team if he has to fight a draft pick now that they've signed Williams. And if they have faith in Harris, then they have 3 RB's on the team and they aren't going to use a pick for something that is not a need.   I expect we're going to go heavy D, with at most two picks being on the offensive side of the ball, one of those will be TE, the other will likely be an Oline guy for depth in case of preseason injuries."
steelers,33801w,kingpatzer,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:19:52 2015 UTC,Maybe they don't trust Harris?  I wouldn't hate a running back to groom to become Bell's backup

I maybe wrong, but that's my guess. If they do like him as a backup, then I can't see how they spend a draft pick on an RB in a draft deep with defensive talent when our D is so much in need of long-term fixes. To that end, I really can't see more than 2 picks on the O side of the ball, and one of those is a TE. Is RB really the next best place to spend the other? I just don't think so."
steelers,33801w,kingpatzer,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"His cap number has nothing to do with anything.  Cutting him will have 0 impact on the cap.  If they feel like they can get a better guy who is guaranteed a 4 year contract I'd be ok with it.  I expect a defensive heavy draft and honestly don't think they will pick a running back.  Just making an argument for the pick.  That being said, don't be shocked if they grab a wide out.  They've brought in a lot for pre draft visits."

It's the RB I can't see happening, not the O picks. Though I hope to see 6 or 7 picks on D just to up our chances of finding starter caliber talent, I could see them going 5 D and 3 O."

I like Josh Harris as a developmental guy, but why the interest shown in rookie RB's? Smokescreens? Maybe, but I don't see how that benefits the team. It's also a really deep RB class, so a guy (like Jones) could be picked very late but is probably typically a mid-round talent. That's really why I wouldn't mind picking one.  Bell needs a long-term backup."
steelers,33801w,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:30:43 2015 UTC,"Bell needs a long-term backup.   I actually think he needs a role player to spell him in certain down-distance situations rather than a pure-backup. Long-term backup to me is a unnecessary luxury in this era. But adequate situation guys are always  around. Sure, they aren't starter quality, but if you have a starter-quality backup RB sitting on the bench, you're doing so at the cost of spending those dollars elsewhere. I just don't see it. At least not this year."

steelers,334zkc,Opuski,21,Sun Apr 19 16:34:01 2015 UTC,"0 because why the hell would the Steelers take a project DE in the first when they have two better young DEs on the roster? He'd be a total waste of a pick because he's never going to see the field. I also don't see this 1st round talent. Armstead has average athleticism, mediocre technique, and aside from his size there's nothing about him that doesn't scream 4th round pick. He's a worse talent than Tuitt last season pretty much across the board."
steelers,334zkc,PomfAndCircvmstance,6,Sun Apr 19 16:56:56 2015 UTC,"He's a DT right? I actually feel really comfortable with our D-line for now, Heyward's a stud, Tuitt was a second round pick last year, and Mclendon is actually pretty solid, but he's not Casey Hampton, which everyone seems to be wishing. I think Mclendon's development is key, as well as Butler finding a better way to use him. Dan McCullers is someone I'd like to see develop and possibly become our NT in the future, he's got the size, just need to be coached up the technique, which he has time for. I wouldn't be against it so much, but I'd prefer a pass rusher if we pick CB in the second round. Hopefully Gregory falls, or Dupree is still there."
steelers,334zkc,NotJoeyWheeler,4,Sun Apr 19 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with McClendon, but at this point in his career I think we can rule out him developing.  He's 29, I don't think we're going to see a lot of improvement out of his game."

steelers,334zkc,NotJoeyWheeler,2,Sun Apr 19 21:49:13 2015 UTC,"Some Internet sites have Armstead listed as a DT but most teams, particularly teams that run a 3-4 defense like the Steelers, view him as a DE. He is not a NT. The most effective run-stuffing NTs are over 300 pounds and occupy multiple blockers. Armstead is under 300 pounds and does not seem to have the skill set or body type to take on double teams."

If he can develop a swat or spin move -- our defense could dominate on the d-line again.
steelers,334zkc,defenstrationaccount,6,Mon Apr 20 13:47:37 2015 UTC,Cam Heyward and Tuitt are going to be a force for years to come.  Armstead would be a waste of a pick.

steelers,334zkc,ColdNose,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"The reason I thought Armstead would make some Steeler fans happy, is that we're one injury away from having an extremely susceptible D-line, and horrible run defense along with it. Keisel is no longer with us, and any OLB force we might have this season won't help much if our opponents start running inside against us. No reason to attack passing if you can get easy yards rushing. With Worilds gone as well, we might easily slip further down from our 26th(!) ranked yards/rush defense. Our run defense has traditionally been so good, that it's easy to forget how much indirect help it gives to the pass defense. All in all, everything starts with the play in the trenches. And although I've loved everything that Tuitt (not to mention Heyward) has shown, there's a lot of doubt in our run defense.  Armstead is actually considered one of the most athletic prospects in this draft, and is also extremely versatile, which would make sense for a hybrid defense. I think he's got more value than OLB Randy Gregory, for example. I also believe there's plenty of good CBs to pick from after the 1st round."
steelers,334zkc,ColdNose,5,Sun Apr 19 21:21:51 2015 UTC,You dont spend a 1st round pick for depth.
steelers,334zkc,Rorbotron,0,Mon Apr 20 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"That's a very simplifying statement. What if the front office believes theres no good value at other positions, and there's no good trade to be found? I'm nearly 100% sure the Steelers won't pick Armstead, but the Steelers aren't known for always picking for need, either. What do you do if you don't pick based on positional need? You draft for value, which is essentially picking for depth."

I forget the beat writer that tweeted it but it was along the lines of ""Steeler fans are really going to like 2015 McCullers."". I think our dline eventually goes tuitt, McCullers, heyward.  I also don't believe armstead will be BPA at 22, definitely not BPA based on their board.  My take is unless someone crazy falls its going to be corner or olb at 22.  I hope its peters or ray."

Like not moving a top ten LT inside to replace a serviceable G just so we can draft a 1st round LT when we have several far more important needs?  It's a wash anyway. Steelers will draft the BPA. The only logic you need in this situation is who is picked for the first 21 picks.

Yes Black Rocky is a top 10 LT per PFF.  If you look at rank alone, it is hilariously deceiving...  Look at the drop off in points from the player above Beechum to Beechum.  It's a shit-show from Beechum on down.    So if you eliminate player rankings, what else can you evaluate players on??? Stats!    Beechum gave up, IIRC, 10-sacks.  10. Ten.  T.E.N.

steelers,335jf5,SleestakLightning,2,Mon Apr 20 03:10:32 2015 UTC,"PFF is so terrible because it grades players on its own system with no regard to whether or not that player may be properly executing his coach's system. The Steelers defensive linemen are prime examples. In LeBeau's scheme, their jobs are to occupy blockers and eat up space. Rarely do they get the sacks or run stuffs that PFF covets so much. As such, Brett Keisel seemed to top off at slightly above average when we all know how good he was, Cam Heyward only scored very highly this past season because his 7.5 sacks is insanely high for a DE in LeBeau's scheme, and while Ziggy Hood was never good, I have trouble believing he was among the worst in the league like PFF often said.  And as it pertains to Beachum, he gets rated highly because there was rarely pressure coming from his side. But there was rarely pressure coming from his side because he would get plenty of help from Heath, Spaeth, Bell, various forms of assistance. As opposed to Pouncey and DeCastro, who had guys one on one and thus allowed more pressure and scored lower according to a crappy site like PFF even though their job was much harder."
steelers,335jf5,defenstrationaccount,0,Mon Apr 20 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"I think PFF does a much better job evaluating how well a player performed his assignments than it does evaluating what they can do and what assignments they could perform.  Basically players on a given unit should have similar grades if the coaching is good enough to cover up weaknesses, but that doesn't make the weak players any better."

steelers,335jf5,ColdNose,0,Mon Apr 20 06:31:17 2015 UTC,It's also crazy because of who will be available (and who won't) at 1.22. The only OT worth picking at that spot -Brandon Scherff - is projected to go in the top 10. Everyone else is 2nd round talent and below.

Of course, I wouldn't hate it if they skipped OLB to avoid reaching for someone.  That being said, if Marcus Peters or another top guy is there and they pick a tackle...I'm going to break something.  **Edit: One more thing. If you want to know who the Steelers are targeting you need to check out the pre-draft visits.  Unless one of the top guys (like David DeCastro) inexplicably falls, they're generally going to stick to the guys they've interviewed.  So far, they've interviewed one late round guard.  Most of the other guys are edge rushers, corners, and tight ends.  Of the tight ends theres Maxx Williams, who I don't like and hasn't been brought in for a visit.  So my final prediction is corner, either Marcus Peters or Kevin Johnson."

steelers,335jf5,ColdNose,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:00:43 2015 UTC,I disagree.  Kevin Johnson is pretty clearly the #3 Corner in the draft.  Just needs to work on tackling.  Still hoping for Peters though.
steelers,335jf5,arbiter074,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:08:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so clear. I prefer Collins, and I think you could make a case for Jones, Darby, or Williams if you can ignore his DUI.  But that's really beside the point. What I'm saying is that even if Johnson is clearly the #3, he's not all that much better than, for example Alex Carter who you could likely get in the third. The clump I see is Collins, Johnson, Jones, Darby, Williams, Ikpre-Olomu, Rollins, Carter, Smith, Rowe (if you see him as a CB - I like him as a safety), Golson, and White. However you want to order them they all have individual pluses and minuses, and I don't think the best of them is head-and-shoulders better than the worst of them, and I think you'll see players in this group at the end of the 3rd, and possibly even at the end of the fourth.  My point is that I wouldn't spend a 1st if I thought I could probably get someone almost as good in the 3rd, even if I had a clear #3. There's probably another position I need to draft where the difference between 22 and 87 is likely to be a bigger difference in talent."
steelers,335jf5,Rorbotron,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:27:14 2015 UTC,Seems like very few people in this sub remember what happened when Timmons had to start at OLB.
steelers,335jf5,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:21:41 2015 UTC,"Granted, our inside linebacker depth is much better than it was.  But Timmons on the outside was just... bad."
steelers,335jf5,Rorbotron,0,Sun Apr 19 23:31:20 2015 UTC,I read the first sentence of your post in Archer's voice.
steelers,335jf5,IDontNeedThisIndigo,5,Mon Apr 20 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"You lost me at olb. I'm with you in that I still believe in Jarvis and Moats is good reliable depth. Harrison, honestly I think he'll do even better than he did last year, so I'm with you so far. Switching Timmons to olb if depth demands it though doesn't seem smart to me. All we'd be doing is pushing a need one year further down and weakening our ilb (I love Shazier/Williams/Spence but Timmons is all pro level). Our defense is predicated on getting to the qb via our outside backers, and nowadays you need a good 3 that can consistently disrupt the pass and at least two more for depth.  That's just my two cents though and I agree with most else you said."
steelers,335jf5,ctornync,-1,Sun Apr 19 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you sir.  The point about Timmons to OLB was only to point out that if an emergency did in fact happen that required Timmons to move to OLB, that he would be a capable ""plug"".  I would never want to see him transition to OLB, as I truly feel that now that Patrick Willis has retired, Timmons will be in consideration as the best ILB in the league."
steelers,335jf5,hoponthe,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"If anyone moves out to outside linebacker in the event of an emergency it would be Shazier.  We would just need stout play from our defensive ends to keep him clean.  As far as the draft is concerned I want Marcus Peters...he's the best corner in this draft, at least the best steeler corner.  I would hate for the pick to be Kevin Johnson who seems to be mocked to us a lot.  He's not a sound tackler and steeler corners need to be able to tackle.  Shane ray would also be awesome but I'm not sire he falls just as peters may not fall.  What I do know is the steelers will draft BPA based on their board and if we've learned anything the steelers don't always draft on need."
steelers,335jf5,IDontNeedThisIndigo,5,Sun Apr 19 23:41:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that we could go LT in round one, although the tackles in this draft are fairly underwhelming, so I probably wouldn't be incredibly happy with it.  The rookie contract has literally 0 impact though.  If we took a kicker, or a QB in round one the total value of the contract they got would be the same.  Rookie contracts are pretty much set in stone now, so there isn't really any negotiation to be done, and position has no impact on the contract.  No matter who we take in the first, they are going to cost a little over $1.5M against the cap this year, unless we trade up or down.  Then they will cost whatever that slot value is.  Here is our salary cap table with projected rookie slot values below our players under contract."
steelers,335jf5,IDontNeedThisIndigo,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:36:16 2015 UTC,La'el Collins isn't underwhelming but I dont believe we get a shot at him and I believe the steelers are very comfortable with beachum.  If we drafted a tackle I believe he would be pushing gilbert.  Either way unless someone crazy falls I will be very surprised if we go offensive line in round one or two.

Honestly, every interaction with you feels like one of those debate classes in high school where one group has to argue for an obviously flawed viewpoint.   Your arguments against our current tackles is that they look stupid, or that they do stupid shit off the field. Bravo. How could you possibly look at this team and think that it needs a tackle in round 1. We have one of the best offenses in the league, and an O-line which is already really good being coached by a hall of famer. Defense defense defense. Pick up a RB in the 7th, and perhaps a TE, but apart from that, defense."

Sacks are down, both the run and pass are working, and you just said Beachum (who, IIRC, we recently gave a nice contract) is a top-10 LT.   If you don't think the marginal improvement of a first-round OLB or CB over our current disasters totally dwarfs a mild upgrade from Beachum or the guards, I don't know what team you've been watching."

You discredited our RTs because they look derpy and apparently give up penalties (Gilbert only had 4 accepted penalties last year, but yeah keep pushing that narrative). I don't see how you can possibly rationalise taking an OT first over any position on defense other than ILB. We have so many needs which are far more pressing. This isn't even a strong OT class."

As your uncle I ask that you take a few breaths and chill the fuck out.  Ready?  Ready now?  How about now?  Gilbert and Adams are busts.  They are below average in both run and pass protection.  Time to move on.  How can we move on?  Move Beechum to RT, as he has proved he can play in the NFL, and draft a LT.  OMG, logic."

I'm sorry if it seems like I was insulting you or something, I'm just asking for a justification. I thought this was a discussion. Everyone's entitled to an opinion, I just want to know what is informing yours. You said that Gilbert was penalty prone, when he only gave up one every 4 games. That's why I brought that up. To repeat, I don't get how you think that drafting an OT to an offense which is proven to be elite, and will only get better with all the same pieces in place and a young O-line, is more important than drafting to a massively depleted defense. Yes Adams is a bust, but Gilbert is a perfectly fine  RT (outside of the first two weeks he only gave up two sacks) and Adams, while a bust, is good depth. Who in this draft is going to come in and play better than Beachum would at LT? I don't think it would be wise to disrupt the chemsitry our line has.   If you wanna discuss that then please do so. If you wanna insult and patronise me in retaliation to what you've wrongly perceived to be me doing the same, I would ask that you don't."

A little Old Testament of me, I know...  Regardless.  I feel I went to painstaking lengths to lay out my reasoning.  For picking a LT.  I want Ben upright, and healthy.  Beechum gave up 10 sacks, several pressurized, several hurries.  I point out these statistics as they support my argument.  Is it illogical to do so?  I doubt it.  I also make a reasonable (in my eyes) leap of faith...  You can obtain a net improvement to the O-Line by moving Beechum to RT, and draft a 1st RD caliber LT.  What's the risk in drafting a 1st RD LT?  He's slow? He's average? He doesn't live up to his potential for being a 1st rounder?  Even if all these were to occur said unnamed draft pick would be better than Adams and Gilbert, and be better depth at both OT positions.  LT is a logical pick.  LT is a risk free pick.  LT keeps Ben healthy.  LT keeps Ben alive in our division, which is stacked with elite pass rushers.  America."
steelers,335jf5,CeeBeast,3,Mon Apr 20 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"I agree on the LT need and reason for it. But you can't win a superbowl on pure offense (just ask any Peyton era Colts fan, they won one when they finally got a defense). Honest to goodness I'd draft two cbs in the first round by trading everything else up. Truly horrendous cb play last year, and if we can't score 56 points a game, we're screwed."
steelers,335jf5,ColdNose,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:58:41 2015 UTC,"Our secondary was exposed so much because of our lackluster pass rush, which is a more vital part of the scheme, so I'd rate a pass rusher as just as important as a CB. Hoping we grab at least one of each in the first three rounds."

steelers,335jf5,Rorbotron,2,Sun Apr 19 20:56:02 2015 UTC,I think they are going to leave the O-line alone for now because they are possibly the best unit we've had in the Ben era and improving dramatically.  That being said if there is a dominant tackle available at our pick I am all for picking the BPA rather than reaching for someone in a position of need.
steelers,335jf5,ShaquilleO_feel,0,Sun Apr 19 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"Relatively speaking, I agree with you.  However, relativity aside, the O-Line can still improve.    I think we have seen what Gilbert/Adams are fully capable of, under the guidance of our savior Munchak.  And they are underwhelming.  I think that Beechum has fully waned a starting spot on our O-Line, and though good, he had a LOT of room for improvement if he is to continue playing LT.  Given the above I feel our team is best suited for converting Black Rocky to an RT, and getting a stud LT in the 1st Rd."
steelers,335jf5,Rorbotron,1 point,Mon Apr 20 10:04:13 2015 UTC,"You are right, the oline can improve.  However, it appears the front office decided Gilbert is our starting right tackle for the foreseeable future for better, or likely, worse. His contract extension guarantees him a ton of money making him too expensive to sit or cut unless he is medically unable to play. I don't think he is worth what he is getting paid and would venture a guess that you agree, but that doesn't change the fact that he is locked in for the next few years.  Beachum is better than Gilbert and is improving, but he is in a more vulnerable situation due to his ""fit"" as a LT and the fact that he doesn't have a long term deal in place. I would prefer they keep the unit together as experience working together is key to an O-line unit's success.  Adams has to be gone after this season, he just isn't good enough to be on the roster unless it is vet minimum. He is the type of player I pray the Ravens sign in free agency.  Personally I think we will draft a tackle in the mid to late rounds, resign Beachum, and Adams either gets cut ($254k cap hit) or is allowed to walk after the season.   Then again, I'm just taking a guess here."
steelers,335jf5,sw337,2,Mon Apr 20 17:40:49 2015 UTC,I'd go CB or OLB. Depends on best player available.
steelers,335jf5,sw337,2,Sun Apr 19 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"LT: Definitely something we could do. I love Beachum, and wouldn't mind him sticking at LT, but drafting a franchise LT and kicking Beachum inside would be nice too.   TE: Something we'll look at I'm sure. We've visited with a few TEs already. Mid-round pick here wouldn't surprise me.  NT: We don't use our NT often anymore, but a late round rotational guy wouldn't be bad.  OLB: Definitely a need, and a pretty big one. Moats is good, but he's best as a rotational guy. I still have faith in Jarvis. Harrison is old as shit, and although he's still pretty damn good, he has a year maaaaaaybe two left.  CB: Huge need, wouldn't be surprised to see 2 of our first 3 picks at CB.  SS: Not really a need, Mitchell is moving to SS this year w/ Shamarko taking over at free. Could see a depth move here, but Will Allen is decent."

LT & LG are after that.  But, because there is depth at CB in this draft, that doesn't exist at Rush End- the team is going to look at OLB in the 1st, and multiple CBs in the later rounds.    Now- if the top 4 or 5 RE options are off the board- you have to consider BPA in order of need.  If the options aren't good- look to trade down.

steelers,331i5v,ninjames101,7,Sat Apr 18 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"Shazier isn't an edge rusher. Well, he can rush off the edge occasionally, and he did it last year, but he's not nearly good enough to play on the edge for us."
steelers,331i5v,CeeBeast,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:24:36 2015 UTC,Big enough*. I'd say he's good enough and fast enough but he's just not an edge rusher. Not built like one. He's like an extra big safety.
steelers,331i5v,deverhartdu,0,Sun Apr 19 15:07:17 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree. He doesnt have the size, but he also doesnt have the moves. His athleticism allows him ti bend the edge, but he has no real pass rush moves."

steelers,331i5v,ninjames101,3,Sat Apr 18 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"Vic Beasley and Bud Dupree are very good, but there's like a .1% chance they fall to us. More realistic options at 22 are Eli Harold and Randy Gregory (if he really falls from the drug test). Hau'Oli Kikaha and Lorenzo Mauldin are guys who could/should be there at our 2nd round pick."
steelers,331i5v,CeeBeast,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"Dupree could definitely fall, he's a high ceiling player but lacks almost any technique, just excells because of size and speed. I've seen him mocked to us a bunch. Beasley though definitely won't fall to us, as much as I'd love it."

steelers,331i5v,Intropy_,3,Sun Apr 19 05:22:53 2015 UTC,He's a middle linebacker. I wouldn't wanna go OLB in the first round but I'd take one after that.
steelers,331i5v,TyroneBiggums93,2,Sat Apr 18 17:33:40 2015 UTC,Harrison is my favorite Steeler ever but he isn't what he used to be. I want us to pick up a young linebacker with a similar work ethic that he can mentor. Harrison's success largely came because he worked his ass off to get there. If he can pass on that mentality to a couple young linebackers they will fit the Steeler system and quickly become fan favorites in Pittsburgh. We'd rather have a blue collar style hard worker than anything else.
steelers,331i5v,maninorbit,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:31:03 2015 UTC,I made the Harrison comment as an off the cuff type of joke but the insight you provide on the subject is very astute. The value of an NFL player is measured by talent but his worth is measured on work ethic. Give me a guy who has a walk on nose to the grindstone mentality and I'll give you a legit player. I would take them over a Tebow or Ryan leaf or manziel any day.

steelers,333ino,Quexana,-1,Sun Apr 19 04:26:32 2015 UTC,"http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/buffalo-bills/fred-jackson/  His contract actually is one of the more attractive things.  DeA is a different player than Fred. There aren't many ""5 tool"" RBs in the NFL. DeA is more of a speed/outside situational play. Fred can play every down (if he can last) or do pass pro on 3rd down. He's much better at pass pro than Bell is.  Any RB you draft will likely not have the situational awareness and technique that Fred has at age 20-22."
steelers,333ino,Quexana,5,Sun Apr 19 05:17:18 2015 UTC,"It's a good contract for his talent level, but 2.7 is too much for the Steelers to pay for a 3rd RB."
steelers,333ino,biscuitz23,2,Sun Apr 19 06:22:02 2015 UTC,Fred is good and any team could use him. But why sign a third RB? I mean Bell is the featured back with DeAngelo backing him up. Along with Harris and Archer as the next in line. Pretty crowded at that point.

steelers,32xbf8,zigmachine,-4,Mon Apr 20 21:10:02 2015 UTC,If this is true it speaks more to the consistently average talent that we have at corner than Ike's abilities. He seems to have gotten more fan support towards the end but let's not forget this is a player who was benched at one point and couldn't catch a cold. Barely averaging one INT per SEASON does not a good corner make.
steelers,32xbf8,Ozz87,13,Fri Apr 17 14:31:06 2015 UTC,Ike knew he couldn't catch so he figured out how to take a teams #1 WR out of the game completely.
steelers,32xbf8,MattEven,3,Fri Apr 17 14:56:30 2015 UTC,"10-1 in playoff games, and generally never having the QB throw to you does make a great corner.  Ike couldn't catch, but it's pretty rare for a corner to have a supreme amount of interceptions (when you think about it, if you're a slim fast athletic guy who catches well you usually end up playing receiver in HS and college ball).    The rare exceptions are guys like Woodson, Champ Bailey, and now Richard Sherman.  Not intercepting balls will probably hold Ike from getting HoF honors, and it's what held him from drawing comparisons to those elite talents.  But I still feel the guy deserves recognition for being an absolute lock down corner for the vast majority of his career here."
steelers,32xbf8,Ozz87,-4,Fri Apr 17 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"Can you name one big play Ike made in any of those playoff games? Quickly! The big pick that iced a game, a game saving tackle or a big hit that caused a fumble? No you can't because he was a slightly better than average corner who on this team looked better than he was.   To say he was our lockdown corner just shows how completely pathetic the string of #2 corners the team has had since he was drafted.   https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2011/11/04/stories-of-the-season-ike-taylor-â-revis-rival-or-statistical-deception/  There's a nice article from arguably his best season showing he's a bit of a statistical anomaly and not a top shutdown guy.   I hate to seem like I'm hating on Taylor but the idea he is even in the same conversation as Blount and Woodson is ludicrous."
steelers,32xbf8,Pengu1nFart,11,Fri Apr 17 15:06:00 2015 UTC,He had an int in SBXL that set up the Hines Ward TD I believe. That's a pretty big play in a pretty big playoff game. I don't think he belongs in the HOF or anything but he was a very good CB for a majority of his career.
steelers,32xbf8,Ozz87,-6,Fri Apr 17 15:39:51 2015 UTC,Fair enough. As a counter point I will submit getting torched by Tebow in that playoff debacle.
steelers,32xbf8,ColdNose,9,Fri Apr 17 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"You realize Ryan Mundy was supposed to play back on that play and didnt right? Ike was playing Thomas with the assumption that he had safety help, which is a lot different than when youre by yourself."
steelers,32xbf8,Ozz87,-3,Fri Apr 17 15:52:07 2015 UTC,It's not just the final play in that game though. Tebow best Taylor specifically for over 200 yards including the last TD. Against a scrub who isn't even in the league anymore in a playoff game is a huge mark against him.
steelers,32xbf8,ColdNose,4,Fri Apr 17 16:01:35 2015 UTC,"Ill give you that. However, Thomas is no scrub and the defensive game planning that game was, in my opinion, pretty questionable."
steelers,32xbf8,Ozz87,-1,Fri Apr 17 16:05:41 2015 UTC,Game planning does speak to an issue when grading out a corner similar to grading a wide out. So much of the game has to happen before their roles can even be executed. That's why something like INTs are important when talking about corners. In their limited exposure to the ball what were they able to do with it. In Ike's case the answer was usually not much.
steelers,32xbf8,Ozz87,8,Fri Apr 17 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"Sure can!    2004 Santana Moss 4 catches - 31 yards  2004 Troy Brown 1 catch - 11 yards  2005 Chad Johnson 4 catches - 59 yards  2005 Marvin Harrison 3 catches - 52 yards  2005 Ashlie Lelie 4 catches - 61 yards (had an INT)  2005 Bobby Engram 6 catches  - 70 yards  2007 Ernest Wilford 2 catches - 39 yards (1 pick)  2008 Vincent Jackson 2 catches - 49 yards  2008 Derrick Mason 3 catches - 41 yards  2008 Larry Fitzgerald 7 catches - 127 yards   2010 Anquan Boldin 1 catch - -2 yards  2010 Santonio Holmes 2 catches - 61 yards  2010 Greg Jennings 4 catches - 64 yards  2011 Burned by Demaryius Thomas  - 4 catches - 204 yards  While the Larry the Great and Mr Thomas got the better of him, Ike had one hell of a playoff resume.  (A couple of these I forget who he was on like in 05 I forgot if he was on Ashlie Lelie or Rod Smith, but neither had great games so I went for the higher number)"
steelers,32xbf8,Steinerway,-6,Fri Apr 17 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"I see your point but you may have missed mine. When asking you to recall a play I wasn't saying Google his playoff stats. I was making the point that he doesn't make the memorable plays that you would expect from top tier talent. If the headline to this read along the lines of ""Taylor has solid career with Pitt, will be missed"" I could've gotten on board. As soon as he's even in the same breath as Woodson and Blount however the conversation quickly goes off the rails.   Also who on that list in retrospect are you really thaaaaat impressed he was able to shut down? Outside of Harrison and maybe Ochocinco it's not exactly murderers row."
steelers,32xbf8,DriArcher,2,Fri Apr 17 16:09:42 2015 UTC,"For me his memorable plays was having a top offense come in, and Taylor shutting down the top wide out of the team.  While they didnt all go on to great things, at the time they were the top receiver on a playoff caliber team.  He's clearly under Woodson and Blount, but who would you put over him?  I mean Chad Scott was ok but I think Taylor was a wee bit better.  Also there is sorta this myth about great DBs making big plays all the time.  The league was lead last season in INTs by Glover Quin of Detroit.  No knock on Mr Quin but he's 29 and I don't hear all kinds of hall of fame buzz around him.  If you look at the list of top each seasons, the options are either absolute nobody on a bad team, or Hall of Famer http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/def_int_year_by_year.htm  And that's how big plays for DBs go, if you're that good you're probably not getting many passes your way.  And if you do and pick them you're probably a Hall of Famer."

I have faith in the defense because of Tuitt and Arthur Moats who definitely flashed when given the opportunity last year.  The reason I'm okay with Brandon Scherff is because Ramon foster is going to be 30 this year and he's been the primary reason we can't transition to a ZBS which Le'veon excelled in in college. Also his versatility is off the charts, projected to be able to play at least 4 out of the 5 spots on the line (I think there's some questions about left tackle, I'd have to double check) and could really put the line from good into top 3 in the league.  I do agree on the tight end spot, if I had my way we'd get Clive Walford in the third and groom him to replace Heath. But in a situation where we don't go defense or O line Maxx is my next best pick. He adds an extra receiving threat, capable blocker (needs a little refining but he's not Jimmy Graham) and sets us up nicely for when Heath hangs it up in the next 1-2 years"

While I think it would be a mistake to even think about touching a WR before the 5th given our pressing defensive needs (assuming nothing crazy like a top 3 or 4 guy falls to us in the 2nd) this trend of high quality WRs visiting can't be ignored. Given the limited number of visits, I feel this has to be interpreted as more than a smokescreen. My first thought is we are gearing up to replace one of the top 3 guys sooner rather than later. My guess would be Wheaton although he isn't a FA until 2017 so drafting an early WR now seems premature. Factor in our success finding mid/late round wide outs I really don't get it. Maybe the plan to deal with the Bell suspension is throw the rock 60 times a game (unlikely)?   I suppose that the FO could be throwing up a very elaborate smokescreen to entice teams needing help at WR behind us to jump the 22nd pick in hopes one of the top flight CB or OLB prospects (Gregory? Peters?) tumbles a bit. Honestly, I'm still not really sure what to make of it."
steelers,32yq6z,DRU_leggo,2,Fri Apr 17 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"Very disappointed. To consider that we have (had, too) a lot of starter-quality WRs drafted after the 2nd round. Brown 6th, Wheaton 3rd, Bryant 4th, Sanders 3rd, Wallace 3rd... Even Ward was a 3rd rounder, back in -98... Randle El was overall 62nd, Nate Washington undrafted... To add all this with the fact that we've got big holes in D, and I'm ok with DHB being our 4th WR, though we could add more comptetition there. But not in the 1st round, there's just no way."

steelers,32yq6z,Wvu17,0,Mon Apr 20 15:10:21 2015 UTC,My buddies and I were talking about this and the only conclusion we could come to and I know here comes downvotes Antonio brown may want a new contract 5 year 41 million is a steal for him. He fired his agent last year and the steelers brought in a lot of guys last year who they ended up drafting this year it seems like a lot of late round tightends a few pass rushers but lots of early 1st-2nd round receivers.  It u draft a guy like coats or perriman match them with Bryant and Ab u force ab in the slot which he may not be comfortable with and that's a lot of 3 reciever sets to run to justify the pick not to mention Wheaton has been a serviceable option for us. Am I saying we r drafting a wide out in the first two rounds no but why bring in all these guys for a visit if u don't plan to address the position.   Tldr : AB is underpaid wants a new deal steelers look for a new young wide out to take his place instead of rework his deal (total and complete off-season speculation)

Rivers has never (and correct me if I'm wrong) had a stellar defense. Rivers is in the same boat as Romo, in that he constantly is put in situations that the team leans heavily on him to win games and is judged by that almost exclusively. I agree that with weapons such as LT and Gates, you should be able to make more happen in  the playoffs. But wins are not dictated by the QB alone (see SB48). You also have to factor the franchise for which they've respectively played for. There's a reason E. Manning didn't want to play in SD. There's a reason Norv Turner fizzled out as a HC and went back to OC. There's a reason Arians is a HC now. These types of personel have a direct influence on players and their production, and I have no doubt Rivers would be a different QB if drafted to the Steelers. Would he have been able to play behind our patchwork O line? Maybe not. But Ben at QB is NOT the reason we won those championships, it was the defense."

steelers,32uwoc,oknowiknow,0,Fri Apr 17 17:52:44 2015 UTC,What always irked me is Flacco is a decent QB.  They just have wasted his potential these last few years by doing this.

steelers,32uwoc,Diarygirl,-3,Fri Apr 17 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"If Flacco were injured they'd put in their backup, Schaub. Schaub was atrocious last year, but in every other year since Flacco's been in the league Schaub has been the better QB. Schaub is the same age as Roethlisberger, so I think it's more likely to be an outlier than a clear indication he can no longer play.  If Flacco were to get injured they have a superior player backing him up. But no, even with a modest improvement at QB, I don't see the Ravens getting 3 wins."

Schaub wins on yards per attempt every year except 2012 when it's a tie (and 2013, and 2010 he only wins by 0.1). So, yes,   Schaub was atrocious last year, but in every other year since Flacco's been in the league Schaub has been the better QB.

They really lost their best WR that Flacco had some real chemistry with and a WR-KR man who put them into big games at the right moment, this offseason. I would say I hate him, and I do think he is overrated but he is a damn good guy at certain times and is no Dalton or Dilfer.  He has a good clutch ability - but I believe their team is good in other parts without him that they could do better then the BROWNS and a 3-13 record screams a Browns like record.  Maybe 6-10ish."

He is one of the more boom or bust prospects in the draft; however, if he pans out like many think he will the Steelers could have an All-Pro on their hands.  He is a freak athletically and is a superb run stopper.     I'm sorry but what in the entire fuck with this pick?  First of all calling Armstead an athletic freak is ridiculous, as is claiming that he's a ""superb run stopper."" The only thing freakish about him is his size and he's pretty much an average player across the board based on everything i've seen of him. He's purely a project player at this point and if he were 6'4 he'd be a mid round pick at best.  All that aside though why the hell would the Steelers spend a 1st rounder on DE?

steelers,32ltjy,JollyRogers40,3,Wed Apr 15 00:22:03 2015 UTC,Not necessarily a major contributor (4th on the depth chart behind Farrior/Foote/Timmons). I'm guessing they just needed another body to keep the picture symmetrical.
steelers,32ltjy,Sybertron,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:29:20 2015 UTC,He'd had a couple of splash plays in spot starts and nonbase packages and was one of the league's top special teamers. A kind of 12th man for the D that season as I remember.

Haven't seen him play myself though. I'm just glad we don't have to deal with Wilfork.

I got a chance to be one of the first media guys to really pay attention to AB when he was a rookie and got 3 or 4 weeks of pretty much one-on-one interviews with him after the game.   The next year when I returned he remembered me and stayed after most of the team had left to answer a few questions after the first home game. Since then he always took time to talk to me when a lot of players would (cough) Ryan Clark (cough) would treat the media as if we were scum just for asking questions.
steelers,32n2f1,SleestakLightning,3,Wed Apr 15 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that's really great to hear and doesn't surprise me. I think part of it stems from the fact that he was a really low draft pick with no guarantees, so there's this part of him that never takes a moment in the NFL for granted.

What gave Troy the ability to drop/blitz/superman-over-the-center was Ike being on an island with the teams best WR and no help over the top.  He had the hardest job in our defense.  To do that, you have to be freaky fast. To put it in perspective, Richard Sherman is also put on an island, but with the team's #2 receiver.  That's literally the difference between covering Calvin Johnson and covering Golden Tate.  When we played Cinci, he absolutely ERASED A.J. Green from the face of the planet.  Ike's job every week was to shut down Pro Bowlers, and for most of his career, he did.  He'll never get the respect he deserves from Steeler nation, nonetheless the media, but I will always remember him in the same way I remember Woodson/Blount"

steelers,32k525,BardsApprentice,-6,Wed Apr 15 00:40:30 2015 UTC,Polamalu didn't really freelance so much as he lined up where ever he wanted before the snap. Ultimately his responsibility was still whatever he was told to do in the play Lebeau called.

steelers,32k525,huet99,-2,Tue Apr 14 22:59:11 2015 UTC,No it isn't. Freelancing would be doing whatever he wants on a given play. He doesn't. He had free reign to line up where ever but he still had to do what Lebeau told him to.
steelers,32k525,SleestakLightning,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"I don't really think there is such thing as your definition of freelancing. If Troy did that, no one would have any idea of what the fuck they were doing."

steelers,32k525,SleestakLightning,37,Wed Apr 15 18:44:33 2015 UTC,"I may be more sad about this than I am about Troy's. Ike was not remotely close to the Hall of Famer that Troy is, not even remotely close to one of the best in his position like Troy was. But he was damn good, and what makes me sad is that he rarely, if ever, got recognition for it. At least Troy did. That stretch from 2011-2012 was some of the best CB play we'd seen by a Steeler in a long time, and that's not by default.  And this marks the departure of the final starter from that 2008 defense (William Gay the dime back, Timmons behind Farrior and Foote).  Edit: Can't believe I forgot Deebo if you want to count him after leaving and coming back. Just feels different from a ""continued legacy,"" if you will, but he most certainly is still around."

steelers,32k525,yinzerjagoff,13,Tue Apr 14 13:32:48 2015 UTC,"Ike was amazing at something CBs rarely get credit for: tackling. He used his size and speed to take away the deep ball, and rarely missed a tackle on the short routes. He even blizted the QB and sealed the edge on run plays. He had his weaknesses as a CB, but he was a great all-around football player."
steelers,32k525,klubsanwich,5,Tue Apr 14 14:02:59 2015 UTC,"I loved how good he was at the little nuances of coverage. Giving the QB the smallest of windows to fit the ball into, something the QB rarely succeeded at. On the television broadcast it looks like the QB just threw a little too far or led the receiver just a little too much out of bounds, but rewatching it and watching the film, that was the one spot where the QB could throw the ball without it being contested."
steelers,32k525,Steinerway,6,Tue Apr 14 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"Personally I think he would have been a hands down hall of famer.  But I always make the argument, if he could catch he would have played wide receiver."

steelers,32k525,PittZee,16,Tue Apr 14 15:21:11 2015 UTC,"Glad to see he's retiring rather than having some sub-par, unnatural looking year with some other team.  On another note, this is looking to be one of the more defense-heavy steelers draft classes i can think of. We have so many holes to fill, and with the exception of TE, they're almost all on defense."
steelers,32k525,teh_hasay,4,Tue Apr 14 15:15:40 2015 UTC,I just hope they realize you can draft defense and start them immediately. For some reason we have this mental block where we need to wait for the draftees to study the defense for like 5 years before even having the ability to start. By that time we cast them off as busts while guys like CJ Mosley start their rookie year then get put into a Pro Bowl.  We saw it happen with Harrison when he sat behind Porter and we said it with Timmons as well. Now we're saying the same thing about Jones/Shazier instead having in favor semi-average guys like Moats in place of them when Shazier showed great potential at times yet Lebeau refused to play him.  Brown/Bryant/Bell started immediately on offense and look at the impact they made. That's because they're top prospects and above average players. The more we refuse to give these guys a shot and instead just go with run of the mill players in place of them the more we can continue to suffer on the defensive side no matter how good our draft is.
steelers,32k525,IdunnoLXG,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"Now we're saying the same thing about Jones/Shazier instead having in favor semi-average guys like Moats in place of them when Shazier showed great potential at times yet Lebeau refused to play him.   Saying Jones deserved more playing time is a joke. He's yet to show he's anywhere near starter potential. Shazier got decent playing time the first three games, then got hurt and wasn't the same for the rest of the year. You're comparing apples to oranges because Mosley was healthy all year and played well enough that you couldn't take him out of the lineup. Shazier and Jones didn't. A few flashes of ""great potential"" doesn't mean anything when you're in a playoff race.   Brown/Bryant/Bell started immediately on offense and look at the impact they made.   Martavis Bryant was running a handful of routes as the 4th or 5th guy and was successful doing that. He was not a full time starter. It's absurd to compare that to an every down linebacker.   The more we refuse to give these guys a shot and instead just go with run of the mill players in place of them the more we can continue to suffer on the defensive side no matter how good our draft is.   I'm tired of hearing this fallacy. Coaches lose their jobs when they don't win, so they play the best players available. The draft classes have been weak and the injuries have piled up. It's not like the coaches have some vendetta against playing young players. The Steelers won the division this year, you don't do that by making bad call after bad call."
steelers,32k525,tonytroz,5,Tue Apr 14 17:07:35 2015 UTC,"Steelers won their division by having the second best offense in the NFL, it sure as hell wasn't because of the defense and that god awful secondary."
steelers,32k525,IdunnoLXG,-4,Tue Apr 14 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"We really need a offensive tackle still, and there are a plethora of attractive candidates in the first round.  I wouldn't be surprised if they address that in the first round and defense with the rest."
steelers,32k525,Sybertron,8,Tue Apr 14 18:29:12 2015 UTC,Someone will get fired if they go tackle in the first. That's ridiculous.
steelers,32k525,DriArcher,6,Tue Apr 14 14:00:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Beachum is solid, and by Gilbert's/Adams' powers combined, I'm sure we'll at minimum have something that can pass as a RT. It would have been nice if Wesley Johnson didn't get poached from us last year, and i definitely wouldn't mind burning another mid rounder on a prospect, but i will break things if we go tackle in the first. Our DB/OLB situation is far too dire."
steelers,32k525,teh_hasay,0,Tue Apr 14 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"Slpain how OLB is dire?  We have a 1st RD pick in Jones, we have a former defensive MVP in Harrison, and we have Moats....  An don't forget that Timmons could sub at OLB too if it got really dire."
steelers,32k525,dmremic,6,Tue Apr 14 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"Harrison isn't getting any younger, Jarvis has potential but hasn't proven anything yet, and Moats was a pleasant surprise last season (in bursts), but i still don't feel comfortable about him in the long term. Timmons is mediocre at best on the outside, and that's without taking into account the loss of his presence at ILB. Behind that we have nothing. Our defense has historically been predicated on having a strong pass rush, and I doubt our recently promoted LBs coach will significantly alter that philosophy.  Our OLB corps consists of three players who aren't sure things, and nothing else. That's pretty dire IMO."
steelers,32k525,teh_hasay,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:12:50 2015 UTC,"I would characterize it as; the situation is uncomfortable.  We have a lot of relatively new, and relatively unproven talent.

BPA sometimes means we don't get a player in our biggest area of need.  Granted, that player would have to be top-5 draft pick talent -- and there aren't any OT's that fit that description in this years draft, but it's not totally outside the realm of reason."

steelers,32ogge,MattHoppe1,2,Wed Apr 15 14:59:18 2015 UTC,"Dunno why but people are severely underrating some of the CB prospects in this draft (namely Byron Jones, Kevin Johnson, and Ronald Darby). All three are great athletes with good size and good tape in which they've shown good cover skills. All three are also good fits for the Steelers defense."
steelers,32ogge,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"Pass, they aren't first round talent sans Johnson"
steelers,32ogge,MattHoppe1,2,Wed Apr 15 18:57:03 2015 UTC,But why are they not first round talents? As I said the game tape says yes these guys are good prospects and they're all great athletes. The only thing they're missing is the pre-draft hype.  This is not a particularly deep draft when it comes to the first round. Outside of maybe 15-20 guys there aren't a lot of obvious 1st rounders so we're going to see guys like Byron Jones and Maxx Williams and Owa and Eli Harold potentially going I'm the twenties even though in a stronger draft they all likely go in the thirties.
steelers,32ogge,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"Byron Jones- is a natural safety converted to corner, is big and plays smart football with good hips, and seems to be a good locker room leader. I dont want him in the first because he doesnt have a great burst off the ball, and suffered a bad shoulder injury.  Ronald Darby- Fucking fast, has great awareness and plays well against the run. He's grabby though, and got beat inside by ACC receivers.  I have no problem with Maxx, but Eli's tape isn't inspiring and lacks value at 22. Owa is more of a run stuffing 43 D End rather than a 34 OLB.  Drafting is all about value, and the Steelers dont reach for needs.  Corners worth taking- Trae Wayans, Kevin Johnson, Jalen Collins, Marcus Peters I like rounds 2 and 3 for OLB, especially Nate Orcherd and Lorenzo Mauldon. If a good linemen is available at 22, we should take one. (Collins or Sherff)"
steelers,32ogge,MattHoppe1,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:34:53 2015 UTC,"I was mostly throwing those names as examples of guys who will go earlier than they normally would more than as options to the Steelers. I agree with you on most of them though (sans Darby, Jones, and Collins ).  Given the drop off following the first 20 or so picks I think a lot of people will be complaining about how their team ""reached"" on a player. The difference between the 22nd pick and the 40th pick are a lot smaller than they have been in other drafts."

In round 1 you chose Kevin Johnson, who has a decent chance of being available at 2:24, over Randy Gregory and Trae Waynes.  In round 2 you picked Gabe Wright, a reach at a position where only depth is needed, over a few reasonable CB options, like Rollins, Collins, or Darby, and over a couple of reasonable picks (since you passed on Gregory) in Flowers, whom I like, and Orchard, whom I don't but seems popular."
steelers,32lsvp,SleestakLightning,2,Wed Apr 15 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"In round 1 you chose Kevin Johnson, who has a decent chance of being available at 2:24   I dunno why people have this idea that Kevin Johnson is going to fall out of the top 40 picks. Not signaling you out but the guy has moved into the #3 CB spot on most draft boards and most drafts now have him firmly entrenched in the 1st round.  edit: Marcus Peters still should have been the pick in this mock."
steelers,32lsvp,SleestakLightning,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:38:11 2015 UTC,I hate the Johnson pick. Gabe Wright is meh. Grant is meh. James is a good pick. Love Emanuel. Garcia's versatility is nice. Goodley is a good pick. Whitehead is meh.  In terms of how likely it is to happen: I'd say it gets a 3 out of 10.   In terms of how good it is: 5 out of 10.
steelers,32lsvp,SleestakLightning,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"Gabe Wright has a great first step, with more experience he will be a great pass rusher. Grant is a better fit for safety, but he can replace Brice McCain well. Jesse James replaces Heath when he retires. Emanuel is a steal for being a 5th round pick. Max Garcia adds depth to our O-Line. While I have faith in Shamarko, Whitehead will provide depth for our FS, and is a great special teams player.   Why do you hate Kevin Johnson though?"

steelers,32ka5j,SleestakLightning,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"I usually agree with your opinions so I'd like to ask what you thought about Zumwalt last year, I had to miss the 2 games he saw action in so I didn't get to form an opinion,  also did he get to see snaps on the outside or did they only have him playing inside? If so what did his pass rush repertoire look like? Swims, spins, bull rush? Or did he just try and beat guys around the edge?"
steelers,32ka5j,a_drunken_monkey,2,Tue Apr 14 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"Zumwalt is an OLB. He looked really good in the preseason. He was quick off the ball, he was relentless. His injury came at a great time for the team to put him on IR and stash him away for the season.   From what I remember he has a couple moves but he's more of a finesse guy than a power guy. He'll win with an inside rip and I seem to remember him using a spin move most often. I thought he played the run well but he was a little weak and will definitely benefit from an NFL strength program."
steelers,32ka5j,SleestakLightning,2,Wed Apr 15 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I expected him to play more of a swing linebacker role since he played both in college, they may not have wanted to overwhelm him as rookie though as well.   It sounds to me that he may be good depth on the strong side if he's packed on some extra muscle. I'm not crazy about any of the edge guys who have a chance to fall to 22 so I'm hoping one of the fringe guys can turn some heads this year whether it be Zumwalt, Lemon or Jones"
steelers,32ka5j,a_drunken_monkey,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:39:43 2015 UTC,They have so much depth at ILB that they really don't need Zumwalt to play inside.   I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised with Zumwalt and Lemon.
steelers,32ka5j,SleestakLightning,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:47:01 2015 UTC,"Fully agree as we sit here today, I had made that assumption around the beginning of training camp last year without knowing how Spence would look and I never heard anymore about him so I continued with that line of thinking.  I hope I will be, I don't think we're in quite as dire a situation at the position compared to some other people's thoughts but we do need help from somewhere and I feel it's more likely that help is already on the roster compared to a kid fresh out of college.   I did get to see a little bit of Lemon, though it was just highlights which I don't like basing my opinion on but I have to admit I liked some of the things he did."
steelers,32ka5j,a_drunken_monkey,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:09:07 2015 UTC,I think the Steelers feel their #1 need is CB.   I think they're pretty happy with their OLBs and would be fine getting a pass rusher in the mid-rounds. They clearly value mid-late round TEs too.   ILB is easily their deepest position.
steelers,32ka5j,SleestakLightning,3,Wed Apr 15 02:30:46 2015 UTC,McCullers will be listed as #2 behind McClendon.  Shamarko will be starting safety.  Other than that I see it being pretty accurate.
steelers,32ka5j,tolas,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:46:36 2015 UTC,I expect Shamarko Thomas will start at FS with Mike Mitchell flipping over to SS.  Based on how awful Cortez Allen was last season I assume Antwon Blake will take one of the starting CB roles with William Gay filling in the other and Cortez Allen fighting with a rookie to avoid being buried on the depth chart. Depending on how early and who the Steelers take a CB though we may see a rookie starting outside opposite Gay/Blake with whichever one doesn't start moving into the slot.  Cam Thomas will hopefully go away and never play another down for the Steelers again while Moats is probably the early favorite to start at LOLB even if the Steelers take a rookie early.
steelers,32ka5j,PomfAndCircvmstance,0,Tue Apr 14 16:04:49 2015 UTC,Mitchell will be the FS. Shamarko is SS.
steelers,32ka5j,SleestakLightning,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:58:28 2015 UTC,"Possibly but that would be a terrible decision by the coaching staff. Mitchell is a good hitter who has great straight line speed and underneath cover skills but he's tight hipped and lacking in a deep cover skills making him more of a fit at SS.  Shamarko can probably play either position but given Mitchell's limitations and the fact that he has the fluid hips and, at least in college, deep cover skills he projects as a much better FS than Mitchell does.  People will point to Mitchell being nicked up as an excuse for his poor play last season  but he has never been particularly good in covering down field. I'm really not looking forward to another year of him getting lost and being 5 yards behind open receivers 30 yards down field."
steelers,32ka5j,PomfAndCircvmstance,-4,Tue Apr 14 17:18:22 2015 UTC,I'm gonna guess the coaching staff knows more about football than you do.
steelers,32ka5j,SleestakLightning,2,Tue Apr 14 17:46:32 2015 UTC,"They aren't infallible and have made poor decisions before  (we all knew Cam Thomas was awful 3 weeks into the season but he continued to get plenty of playing time regardless).  Are you saying that no matter who the team drafts you'll have complete 100% confidence that it's the best possible move? There's nothing wrong with disagreeing with the front office, they do make mistakes and playing Mitchell at FS when he has been mediocre at the position would be one of them."

How many QB's had to plan accordingly to what they thought Troy might do. How often he would disrupt their game plan by doing what he did, and ultimately make someone else look better.   As much as I loved everyone on our defense while Polamalu was with us, you have to account for all of their successes as reflective of his presence."
steelers,32l8z8,christhen,8,Tue Apr 14 18:12:05 2015 UTC,"I would be so disappointed if we drafted him.   We have Mike Mitchell already. He's a SS playing out of position at FS. If we draft Collins and started him next to Shamarko (who as proved nothing, I see no reason he should start over Will Allen, but that's a different conversation) it would be no different then what we have now, a SS playing out of position at FS. And we'd be saddled with Mitchells contract while he sits, or forcing Collins to sit through basically is entire rookie contract. What you suggested at safety doesn't add up.   The other option is Mitchell at FS and Collins at SS. I guess that's a little better. But I don't like that either.   If we're gonna draft a safety it should be a FS, then we bump Mitchell over to SS. Shamarko can stay on special teams."
steelers,32l8z8,IDontNeedThisIndigo,3,Tue Apr 14 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"I see no reason he should start over Will Allen   I'm assuming that the coaches know from training and stuff how ready Shaarko would be to start, but even aside from that: do you really want us to supress young talent in favour of a safety who will be 33 when camp starts?"
steelers,32l8z8,IDontNeedThisIndigo,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"I would put the better player on the field. Last season when Troy wasn't on the field it was Will Allen that took over. Shamarko was still on special teams. That says to me that the coaching staff thinks Allen is better, it's /r/steelers that's handing Shamarko the starting job.  Hell, Robert Golden saw the field on defense more than Shamarko, or at least made more an impression on me with his time.  My solution, and you've probably seen it here before, is to draft a FS like Q. Rollins and move M. Mitchell the SS where he belongs."

steelers,32glmi,a_drunken_monkey,-3,Tue Apr 14 00:57:23 2015 UTC,I've never understood wording like this. So he'll be a better player if he's drafted in the 2nd round? That doesn't make much sense to me.
steelers,32glmi,Steinerway,11,Mon Apr 13 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"If you wish to argue semantics (of course you do) then let me explain it for you.  I don't think Eli Harold is anything special but he has shown flashes of ability that make him worthy of being drafted. I think a lot of NFL teams agree with me. Picking him in the first rounds means you pass up on much better players (because you can only select one player per pick).   But if you're picking in Round 2 and he's still on the board, his talent level is more in line with the players who will also be on the board at that spot so selecting him there doesn't force you to miss out on players who are better prospects.   Of course this doesn't account for players who end up being better than their projections (since you're likely to argue that next) but you have to go by what you see and Eli Harold would be a horrible 1st round pick. By the time they select in Round 2 his value is much greater."
steelers,32glmi,SleestakLightning,-12,Mon Apr 13 17:57:35 2015 UTC,Mind reading is apparently not a strength of yours.  Either he's a good player or he's a bad player. Doesn't really matter all that much where he's taken.
steelers,32glmi,Steinerway,10,Mon Apr 13 18:23:08 2015 UTC,"That's a very simplistic way of looking at it.  Value matters in the draft. There's no point in drafting a guy in the 1st round if you can draft him in the 2nd round. It has little to do with how good he is overall as much as it does how good the players you'd miss out on by taking him in the 1st round would be.  Case in point...  Antonio Brown was a 6th round draft pick. Hindsight being 20/20 he's a Top 5 pick in that year's draft. But if the Steelers take him in Round 1, they miss out on the chance to draft Maurkice Pouncey. Knowing what they knew at the time, it would have been a terrible decision to take AB in the 1st round.   If Eli Harold is projected by most everyone to be available in Round 2 and the Steelers take him in Round 1 they miss out on other players who appear to be more likely to be star NFL players than Eli Harold does.  Your whole point requires knowledge we don't have yet --- how good the player turns out to be. Right now all we can do is project."
steelers,32glmi,SleestakLightning,-9,Mon Apr 13 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"Almost as simplistic as ""Win the Super Bowl or the entire season is a failure,"" right? I'm sorry, I don't mean to bring up past conversations, but you of all people referring to anything as simplistic is somewhat ironic.  Goes without saying there's a bit of a difference between a 6th round pick and a guy who some people do have 1st round grades on."
steelers,32glmi,Steinerway,6,Mon Apr 13 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"There's a reason I have you tagged as ""Gigantic Douchebag"" using RES. Because the only reason you're arguing with me is because you're butthurt about previous conversations. You're going back on ignore because you're either stupid or trolling and I don't have time for either one.  The Super Bowl thing is true though. It's how good sports franchises should view their seasons. There are no moral victories. You either accomplish your goal or you fail. If your goal as a coach and a team isn't to win a championship then you should just quit."
steelers,32glmi,SleestakLightning,-5,Mon Apr 13 19:07:43 2015 UTC,"You either select a good player or you don't. It's how good sports franchises should view their drafts. It doesn't matter what round he was taken in, he'll either help or he won't.  I'm arguing because it's pretty asinine to say ""This player sucks if he's taken in the 1st round but he'll be solid if he's taken in the second."" Which round he's taken in doesn't determine that."
steelers,32glmi,Steinerway,5,Mon Apr 13 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"Sure it does matter. It matters on the day of draft because you don't know if he's going to be good or not.   Do you think if teams knew Tom Brady was going to be Tom Brady that he would've fallen to the 6th round? Same with AB.  Your argument is dumb because it's predicated on having prior knowledge of how good a player is going to end up. Because no one knows that for sure, you have to factor in when you think a player is likely to come off the board in order to get the best value out of your picks."

steelers,32glmi,TombaFan123,-4,Mon Apr 13 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"Sure it is. How does what round the player is taken in determine how good he ends up? He's still the same player. Same measurables, same work ethic, same chemistry with his teammates, same everything. Why should the round matter at all? And why should people pretend the round matters at all? If you think the player will be good and he's the best on your board, take him. Travis Frederick is probably my favorite example of this."
steelers,32glmi,Steinerway,7,Mon Apr 13 17:59:07 2015 UTC,"Better talent gets taken earlier. If he's a 2nd round talent, you take a 1st round talent over him because he should still be there in the 2nd"
steelers,32glmi,TombaFan123,-3,Mon Apr 13 18:04:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, but going from ""He sucks!"" to ""He'd be a good 2nd round pick?"" So which is it? Does he suck? Or will he be a solid player? And why does that depend upon which round he's drafted in?"
steelers,32glmi,Steinerway,2,Mon Apr 13 18:23:52 2015 UTC,The difference between 1st and 2nd round talent is huge
steelers,32glmi,TombaFan123,-1,Mon Apr 13 22:01:23 2015 UTC,"Again, this isn't really refuting anything I said. How will it be good to take a player in the 2nd round but bad in the 1st round? Either way, the team has the player. And it's especially irrelevant to a player like Harold, who some already do consider a 1st round talent."
steelers,32glmi,Steinerway,6,Mon Apr 13 22:09:18 2015 UTC,"It's a gamble, the expected payoff is different. Kyle Long is a good example of this. Projected 2nd round, drafted 14th overall. All depends on how good your scouts are."
steelers,32glmi,Z24w,2,Mon Apr 13 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"Everything is about perceived value compared to cost. If you owned a taxi company and you could buy two cars that gave you the same MPG and same reliability over time, you'd assume that if one car cost 20k and the other cost 40k, that the 20k would be a better car. There's no reason to spend more when the same production is going to be available at a lesser cost."
steelers,32glmi,fauxedo,-1,Tue Apr 14 06:19:49 2015 UTC,"Everyone is using such vague, broad examples to explain the simple concept. I get the concept, everyone does. The specific discussion is about Eli Harold and other first or second round picks. So it's not so much 20k versus 40k for the same car, it's 20k versus 20k for car that some think are great, others don't.  Edit: Clarified Eli Harold and other first or second round picks. People were pretending I was saying 1st and 6th round picks were equal, and I thought it was so obvious when I was first making my point that it wasn't at all what I or anyone would ever imply that I didn't need to specify it. But if someone is considered a late 1st/2nd round pick? What's the harm in taking that guy in the late 1st round? He'll still become the same player at pick 22 that he'll be at pick 56, and if no one is really available at 22 who's much better than him, it'll make even less of a difference."
steelers,32glmi,Steinerway,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:42:07 2015 UTC,"Because the people you're arguing with believe he's worth a 30-46 pick. Meaning 29 players are projected better than him. Picking him before 30 would be bad value, meaning he sucks in terms of value. Picking him after 46 would mean he's good value, meaning he's awesome.   So, Eli Harold at 22 sucks, Eli Harold at 56 is awesome.   You should post your future questions on eli5 so you can get a response you'll understand faster next time."
steelers,32glmi,Lfehova,4,Tue Apr 14 18:06:23 2015 UTC,And I do like him but I feel that he could be a reach for the first round.  I would be fine if he was drafted first round but I feel he is more of a second round prospect due to the fact that he does not blow away other prospects with measurables and his tape.
steelers,32glmi,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:21:11 2015 UTC,"I was just basing it on what I have seen in mocks.  I haven't seen him play, but his measureables seem to be in line with Gregory, and Fowler who are first round prospects without Gregory's off field issues.  It seems like most mocks have him going starting at about our pick and usually always going in the late first so I was just surprised to see him not listed for either round.  I was wondering if there was something about his game that you noticed and didn't like or just left him off."

Williams had a DUI so he may be DND for the Steelers, Ekpre-Olomu is a good choice, Harold doesn't impress me but not bad value in Rd 2, Owa would be good a pick there."

steelers,32glmi,kingkoons,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:16:22 2015 UTC,I think we could even get lucky and see him fall to the 4th round. It could be a steal at that point. He has a little to work on but I see a lot of potential if he pulls through that injury like you said.

steelers,32glmi,huet99,7,Mon Apr 13 19:15:04 2015 UTC,They're not going to take Landon Collins with Shamarko Thomas already on the team and I'm not sure that's not the right move. There are other positions they need to fill worse than safety right now.
steelers,32glmi,SleestakLightning,0,Mon Apr 13 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"Having a playmaking defensive back is a need right now. The Cards drafted Deone Buchannon (same type of player as Collins) and played him with up to four other safeties on the field. While Shamarko/ Collins wouldn't always play together in the base set, they would definitely have packaged plays to employ all three onto the field. Shamarko is also unexperienced and we haven't really seen him play, and Mike Mithcell was horrible last season, so I would say safety is a need."
steelers,32glmi,Steinerway,5,Mon Apr 13 21:00:37 2015 UTC,Shamarko is inexperienced and we've yet to see him really play so to make up for that we should draft a rookie who is by nature inexperienced and who we've never seen play in the NFL? Makes sense.  Mitchell was playing hurt most of the season last year and the coaching staff is confident he'll be better now that he's healthy.  Corner is a much bigger need than safety right now. Especially a safety like Collins. He's aggressive and physical but he has average hands is susceptible to being beaten deep. Sound familiar?
steelers,32glmi,huet99,2,Mon Apr 13 21:05:36 2015 UTC,Heyyyy we agree on something!
steelers,32glmi,SleestakLightning,-2,Tue Apr 14 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"Comparing Landon Collins and Shamarko is ridiculous. Shamarko was drafted in the fifth round.     Corner is as big of a need as both OLB and safety. If they take any three of those positions, it is fine with me. You're kind of splitting hairs.    You know who else was a playmaking safety who was much better known for playing in the box than in coverage? Troy fucking Polamalu."
steelers,32glmi,huet99,2,Mon Apr 13 21:16:32 2015 UTC,We've seen more of Shamarko in the NFL than we have of Landon Collins.  AB was drafted in the 6th round. Is Mike Wallace better because he was drafted in the 3rd?  Comparing Landon Collins to Troy is a fucking joke. Troy is a HOF player. Landon Collins is a dude who looked decent in college.
steelers,32glmi,SleestakLightning,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:19:42 2015 UTC,"That's like saying we've seen more Landry Jones than we have of Jameis Winston. Yeah, you're technically right, but it's a really dumb thing to say since Shamarko has played like 5 plays."
steelers,32glmi,huet99,2,Mon Apr 13 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"Shamarko played over 200 snaps in his rookie season.  EDIT: They traded a 3rd round pick to get him. He's going to get every chance to win that job. Drafting Landon Collins is highly unlikely because if he's the #1 pick then he's probably going to start over Shamarko, which they don't seem to want.  Don't forget they see Shamarko every week in practice. They know what they have there and I don't think they want to give up on a guy they traded a 3rd round pick for so soon.  Also, they haven't brought Landon Collins in for an official visit yet. If they don't, then that lends even further credence to the fact that he won't be the pick."
steelers,32glmi,IDontNeedThisIndigo,0,Mon Apr 13 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"I was never claiming that I think that they would take him, just that I think he would be a good addition to help return the defense to the turnover forcing, playmaking dominant D it once was."
steelers,32glmi,ColdNose,5,Tue Apr 14 00:32:43 2015 UTC,"We have Mike Mitchell, a dude who excells in big hits and was sometimes a liability in coverage (injured so maybe give him a pass) and Shamarko, who is a big hitting SS and a relative unknown in coverate. That's our two starters at the moment. If we're getting another safety, we're getting one who can cover."
steelers,32glmi,huet99,4,Mon Apr 13 23:29:03 2015 UTC,If you would love Landon Collins then youre in luck because the Steelers already have someone exactly like him. His name is Mike Mitchell.

steelers,32hezt,rhino43grr,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:50:45 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking it's more likely to they trade up and down.   The guys that should be available have some holes in their game or have some character concerns.   Look at the players they have had visits with, and a lot of them have been mocked to go higher than 22.   Best case they can hope to grab Peters, Johnson, and maybe Dupre.    I'm still hoping Diggy is on their radar because he should be available and is very talented, with little draw backs to his game.  But if they trade up they could possibly grab Waynes, Ray, or Shelton would be a huge gain for the defense.   Where they are now, their best bet would be Peters IF he checks out in interviews.  Dupree could be fantastic 3 years down the road but won't do much until then, and Johnson is merely a ""good"" player but I don't see him being a fantastic CB.  Which isn't bad, but you want more from a 1st rounder."

steelers,32gzqf,jdcole07,3,Mon Apr 13 18:53:35 2015 UTC,Grading it in terms of needs and value for the Steelers it's terrible. Eli Harold should not even be considered in the first round. Byron Jones isn't going to be there in the 2nd but I do like that pick a lot. The 3rd and 4th round picks are okay. The rest sucks.  Grading it in terms of how accurate it's likely to be I'd say it's bad. Wes Saxton is on their radar but no one else you mentioned has been brought in for a visit yet which usually means a lot for the Steelers.   Drafting using FanSpeak tends to give really crazy results. Especially using the CBS Big Board. I just did a draft real quick and ended up with this unrealistic mess...  Round One: Vic Beasley - OLB  Round Two: Byron Jones - CB  Round Three: Ali Marpet - OG  Round Four: Jesse James - TE  Round Five: Karlos Williams - RB  Round Six: Zach Wagenmann - DE  Round Six: Ryan Delaire - OLB  Round Seven: Bobby McCain - CB

The fast guy who can run fast and jump high? I don't think we should bite on him too fast. Kevin Johnson and Marcus Peters are the guys to bite on. And David Johnson I like the kid ALOT and I know he can split out at WR too, hell just what we need another bell.. It Would be nice, but he should be going 5th-7th round not the 3rd."

Also, as you suggested, this time I focused on players we have brought in for visits.   I couldn't pass on Maxx in the 2nd. Besides that, I find it pretty realistic and wouldn't be upset if this is how it shakes out.  Round One: Kevin Johnson - CB - WF  Round Two: Maxx Williams - TE - Minn  Round Three: Danielle Hunter - OLB - LSU  Round Four: Senquez Golson - CB - Miss  Round Five: Matt Jones - RB - Fla  Round Six: Max Garcia - C/G - Fla  Round Six: Devin Gardner - WR - Mich  Round Seven: Kyle Emanuel - OLB - NDSU"

I can't see them taking PJ Williams after his DUI but who knows.  I like Jesse James and Steven Nelson. I also like Zach Wagenman.  So far none of the guys in your mock have been brought in for a visit so I'd say there's relatively little chance of these guys being picked but we'll see.  Not a bad draft but not a home run either. Unfortunately I think they need a home run but will end up with something more like this.

steelers,32bpr6,ex-apple,3,Mon Apr 13 18:06:35 2015 UTC,"Our OL was garbage. Heath, great as he was, will never get HOF recognition since he lived in the Antonio Gates/Gronk era. If he had played the way he does just 10 years earlier, I bet you he'd have a shot.   So that leaves Ward as another contender. I think he'll get in, but after many years. One day there'll be a weak WR class and I think he might squeak in there. Probably 8+ years of waiting though.   RB wise, FWP was in his decline, and was really just a flash in the pan (although what a flash he was). Still, the kid got us to a SB. But he would never get HOF consideration.   All that leaves you is Ben. He'll be in there for sure."

steelers,32bpr6,ShaquilleO_feel,-4,Wed Apr 15 20:11:06 2015 UTC,"If Gates goes in over Miller that would be robbery. But really the best TE during Heath's tenure before Gronkowski arrived is Witten.

Not because they think he did, but they're trying to say it was a mistake to hire Haley. And they don't think it was a mistake to hire Haley because of how effective his offenses are, they dislike Haley because of tabloid headlines concerning his and Ben's relationship.  So basically stupid reasons all around. I wouldn't go so far as to say that I'd root for the Pats, they're still tied for last with the Ravens in my book. But it's annoying as hell when people confuse ""He's a good head coach now"" with ""He was a good offensive coordinator.""

steelers,3290di,toadstyle,2,Sat Apr 11 22:24:27 2015 UTC,"Former Steelers cornerback Brice McCain:  âTroy would tell you what is about to happen before the play. He would tell you during the play what is going to happen. I would think if I donât make this play I am going to let him down because he will tell what is going to happen and they will run exactly what he said they were going to run.â   That's really one of the more frustrating things about being an older fan. You've eventually watched enough where you know what's going to happen, the only mystery is execution - if the players can individually do their jobs.   It kind of...whatevers me...when there are professionals who don't know their jobs. It's forgivable with guys who don't have much experience, but only to a point. Troy didn't have much experience, got in the film room and learned everything there was to know right away.   It's not like football is that difficult if fans can know this stuff as well. Troy proves that it's about seriousness and preparedness. McCain talks about the part of ""making the play"", which is the only real mystery. Can guys handle their assignment?"

Mr. Rooney described the great football player as ""solid like a Guinness, strong like a Jameson whiskey with a splash of Bailey's for finesse.""  The locals of County Down, impressed with this account of this football player decided to create a drink that would capitulate the superlatives Mr. Rooney spoke of this man. So they combined the elements into a drink but realized they needed to drink it as fast as Franco ran. As fast as a car.  Thusly, The Irish Car Bomb came into existence with few knowing (besides the Irish) that it was made as a homage to Franco Harris and created by Mr. Dan Rooney."

Aside from there being absolutely no reason to take a receiver that high  given who is already on the roster he is one of the softer 1st round receiver prospects to come through the past few years and there were way too many plays last season where instead of attacking the ball in the air he opted to run under it allowing passes that should have been catches to be knocked down. If the Steelers were to go insane and take a receiver that early i'd rather have a possession guy who makes tough catches like Jaelen Strong.

steelers,329v4t,ColdNose,3,Sat Apr 11 22:15:34 2015 UTC,Not really a fan of Gregory to be honest but thats just a matter of opinion.  I like Golson in the 3rd. Not the 2nd. I like a guy like Alex Carter much better.   I dont like a runningback before the 4th but I could get on board with it depending on who the previous picks were. Not with this draft though.   No way Jones is there in the 4th. Some team is going to fall in love with his measurables. My bet is he's gone by the early 2nd.   Cant really speak for the rest of the picks. Nice write up though.
steelers,329v4t,thelittlewizardboy,2,Sun Apr 12 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"I like the thought process with regards to need/value, but I don't see any way that Gregory is there when the Steelers are on the clock. There are so many teams ahead of us that need pass rushers (Falcons, Giants, Saints, Jets, and 49ers, just to name a few). Plus, it's a premium position, perhaps second only to CB. I'd love for it to happen, but I doubt it does. Also, Byron Jones, by all accounts, is a low-first/early second round prospect. I don't see any way that he's available in the 4th. In fact, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if he was the first round pick.   Otherwise, I like it. Value and need are aligning nicely, and the late round picks address depth needs in typical Steelers fashion (seriously, they cannot get enough of TEs and OL in day 3). Good stuff!"

We'll draft the best available pass rusher in the first, be it OLB or DE. Our pass rush was laughably bad last year, consistently forcing our secondary to cover past 5 seconds without generating any pressure, a fault which, in the modern NFL era, is unrealistic. Hell, we pulled 2 guys out of retirement to fill the roster. Our secondary is bad, yes, but was at least servicable toward the end of the season. Waiting until our compensatory pick in the 6th (basically a 7th rounder) to address their lack of depth will not happen though. Expect a RB in the mid to late rounds as well, the talent pool this year is too large to pass on. I expect an OLB or DE in the first, the other in the second or if a high CB falls, if not then CB in the 3rd (if no good CB avalable then HB), HB or TE in the 4th, then BPA 5,6,6,7, with priority in OLB, DE, S, G in that order."

steelers,328n8m,MattHoppe1,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:07:18 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I00tb_OcxtU If Zach Zenner is really ranked to go that late, he might be a steal. Really impressed with this highlight video, though such domination in the lesser series can be awfully misleading. His NFL draft profile says that he's not a creative runner. I do see potential, based on the video. The text also mentions that he has tight hips, which i think is true. A very clean running style, imo. Might fill some of the void left by Blount, who also runs with tight hips and less cuts. And it's hard to say how long DeAngelo Williams can be of good quality as the second RB. Of course some backs do many succesful seasons even beyond their 30th birthday. I hope Williams does!"
steelers,328n8m,Opuski,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:45:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see Williams in the first. I'd be shocked if he's the top player on their board, and he's not well-regarded as a blocker. I think they're looking for a player in the Heath Miller mold, and Maxx is not that guy. I'm a little uncertain about S in the second round. I think they need to give Mitchell another year and finally get an idea of what Thomas can bring to the position. Plus, they've got good depth in Will Allen. It wouldn't shock me, as maybe he'll be the BPA on the board, but I don't see it. The rest looks good. I'm desperately hoping that the first 2 picks are OLB and CB in whatever order, but the Steelers just don't like to take CBs high. It wouldn't be at all surprising if it was the same story this year. Hopefully Butler has better plans for the secondary. Nicely done for the most part."
steelers,328n8m,thelittlewizardboy,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:47:11 2015 UTC,Based on the way this draft fell I would go:  1) Marcus Peters  2) Ronald Darby or Mauldin  3) Kikaha or Derron Smith  4) Jesse James
steelers,328n8m,ColdNose,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on further review, passing on Maxx made a lot more sense for Pitt because of how many TEs were available in the later rounds."

steelers,322mi7,TheSonic311,55,Fri Apr 10 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"My favorite memory of Troy is easily one after the game against the Bengals where he injured himself with that pick six.  A gaggle of reporters, myself included, wait at his locker for a chance to talk to him. Burt Lauten, Steelers media relations, tells us he's not sure Troy is going to talk. Everyone had left the locker room except the young boys gathering the players' gear and getting it ready to be laundered.  Some media members start to give up. Troy comes hobbling out of the trainer's room. His leg is heavily wrapped. He can barely stand. He gets to his locker and stands there with a smile on his face for 5-10 minutes answering questions with the same smile and grateful demeanor that he always has.   Troy is one of a kind. A truly selfless man. Troy is the person I wish I could be. This world would be in great shape if everyone tried to be more like him.  Future NFL Hall of Famer -- Current Human Hall of Famer."

That game Polamalu got a pick then got viciously tackled by a Chiefs player.  It was quite the tackle as the Chiefs player just held up the locks of his hair disgustedly after tackling Polamalu with his hair. Polamalu later said, ""when he tackled me?

steelers,322mi7,maltrab,-2,Fri Apr 10 07:30:08 2015 UTC,Bears should already be using them with all the great players they had until the 90's
steelers,322mi7,btravis72,2,Fri Apr 10 13:45:38 2015 UTC,"What about Bettis, Shell, Swann, Stallworth, and Bleier?  The problem the Steelers have is that they have had so many great players that retiring so many numbers would create jersey problems at certain positions.  From Wikipedia:   The Pittsburgh Steelers also do not officially retire uniform numbers (the exception being Ernie Stautner, who played before the dynasty years of the 1970s). However, Terry Bradshaw's number 12, Franco Harris' number 32, Jerome Bettis' number 36, Mike Webster's number 52, Jack Lambert's number 58, Dermontti Dawson's number 63, and Joe Greene's number 75 have not been issued since those respective players retired, while Gary Anderson's number 1, Donnie Shell's number 31, Mel Blount's number 47, and Jack Ham's number 59 have had minimal usage since. Number 35 was worn by two Hall of Famers (Bill Dudley and John Henry Johnson) and was most recently worn by former fullback Dan Kreider in 2007. The Steelers will officially retire Greene's number 75 during the 2014 season.[17]  John Stallworth's number 82 has been reissued several times as has Lynn Swann's number 88; this is mainly because of the limited number of numbers available for wide receivers and tight ends (until 2004, those positions could only wear numbers in the 80s). However, the NFL has since relaxed the rule and started allowing receivers to wear jersey numbers 10â19 in addition to 80s numbers.   It's a good problem to have, to be sure, but you can see how this can get out of hand."
steelers,322mi7,maltrab,-4,Fri Apr 10 11:28:39 2015 UTC,The Bears haven't seemed to mind. They have had more great players than the Steelers and they still retire numbers.

This last year he was simply not able to play at the level we've come to expect, nor at the level we needed. I see his retirement as very similar to Hines Ward's, after a similar disappointing final campaign.   But let's focus on the decade and then some of incredible jaw-dropping highlights and superhuman feats of animalistic nature that dominated the gridiron for the 00s.

A buddy of mine posted this on facebook and tagged me in it (I'm not from Pittsburgh, so I'm one of the few Steelers fans he knows). It was more for the sake of busting my balls than anything else, I do it to his Patriots just as frequently. I commented on it:   At first I figured this was going to wind up having been written by some 17 year old kid who hadn't yet seen the greats that he grew up with enter the twilight of their careers. Then it turned out to just be some number cruncher. Can't decide which is worse.   Literally every player has less great, injury-riddled seasons at the end of his career. Why hold it against Polamalu when you can do the same thing with, again, every Hall of Famer or Hall of Famer-to-be that has ever played any sport ever?"
steelers,326jw2,dustin_brown,6,Sat Apr 11 00:27:26 2015 UTC,"I personally do not thing we have anything to really lose sleep over.  I think that DeAnjelo Williams will fill the void for those 3 games and is hungry to prove himself as a vetran RB.  As for Troy, I am glad to see him retire and not go on to another team.  It pained me to see him give it 100% every season and end up injured as of late.  TP is undoubtably one of the best FS's in the NFL and will be missed.  But his parting will free a nice chunk of salary cap and will hopefully help in building a newer younger defense."
steelers,326jw2,oompahlumpa,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:43:24 2015 UTC,"Williams will do okay, but nowhere near the production that Bell gives the Steelers. It sounds like the cap space will be between $10-$14 million, but it depends on when Polamalu files his retirement paperwork."

steelers,326jw2,fauxedo,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:34:40 2015 UTC,We have to assume increased production from last years rookies too. If we can give a few more touches to Bryant (who had that awesome run during the playoff game) and also Josh Harris I think our offense is still better than most in the league.  Let's just hope the schedule plays in our favor.
steelers,326jw2,oompahlumpa,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:54:26 2015 UTC,I am with you!  I think bryant is already as good if not better than Wheaton and will be on par of brown someday in the near future
steelers,326jw2,MichelangeBro,3,Sun Apr 12 03:59:35 2015 UTC,"Too big of a hole? Let's not forget that two years ago we started 0-4 and missed the playoffs by a field goal.  Will we miss Bell's presence on the field? Absolutely. He's our most productive player on offence if you ask me, and we're going to sorely miss him and his role as a runner/blocker/receiver. But in the games for which he's absent, we've got ourselves a solid veteran backup. We'll have a fighting chance.  Even if we end up going 0-3, that's still not something we can't come back from."
steelers,326jw2,thelittlewizardboy,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:00:34 2015 UTC,"Williams is a solid veteran, but he also has an injury history (knee, ankle, foot). For a running back, that means that he could be done on any given play. Yes, the Steelers have other offensive threats, but you also don't have the ""Steel Curtain"" anymore. LeBeau is gone, Polamalu retired, and now Clark has announced that he will retire. James Harrison seems to contemplate retirement on a daily basis, and Kiesel is gone. The days of a solid Steelers defense, one that kept them in a lot of games, is fading fast, and the AFC is getting stronger and stronger. So yes, the hole might be too big with Bell out the first three weeks of 2015."
steelers,326jw2,thelittlewizardboy,2,Tue Apr 14 18:00:07 2015 UTC,"Polamalu? Absolutely. It's painful to say, but Will Allen was clearly playing better than Troy late in the year. He was a liability in coverage. Be it Thomas, Allen, or a rookie, I think they'll be okay back there. Bell hurts a lot, but I think that with some offensive adjustments, coupled with a timeshare arrangement, will stem the bleeding a little. Throw it out to Brown, Bryant, and Wheaton as much as possible to give the RB a little breathing room. I think it can be managed, but there's no denying that whoever takes over will be a substantial downgrade."

So I look at who were the best players who were most substantial to those defenses. No one compares to Joe Greene, let's just get that out of the way. Jack Ham is the greatest 4-3 OLB of all time, so there's that. Troy is probably the greatest SS of all time. Even when you look at just the safety in general, he's grouped in with Ed Reed and Ronnie Lott in my opinion. If I were to add an offensive guy, I'd say Mike Webster since he's probably the greatest center of all time.   So yeah, to me he's definitely up there."

The only two with a higher total career AV who also played SS most of their careers are Ken Houston and Donnie Shell, and Polamalu shows a higher peak and a higher career AV per season than either of them. First, that's pretty darn good company to be in. Second, lets  admit that AV is a good but rough proxy.  So now you're talking about a guy who is by statistics and by consensus arguably the greatest of all time. The other guys in that argument are Ken Houston, Donnie Shell, and let's put John Lynch in there as well. Who are you taking? Usually when you're looking at the very best players all time at their position, it's a hard call to make. But honestly, this one isn't. No hesitation, give me Polamalu every time."

steelers,320p82,OutlawJoseyWales,8,Thu Apr 9 17:46:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. I was hoping to have him extended before they had to pick the option up but I haven't heard anything regarding him and an extension.
steelers,320p82,Steinerway,8,Thu Apr 9 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"I think you've got to absolutely always pick up the option, never hope for a long-term extension before it. The way it's calculated is the average salaries of the 3rd-25th highest paid players at the position. DeCastro would almost certainly get a top 10, maybe even top 5 contract given market value. We're saving a LOT by exercising the 5th year option rather than giving him a contract now, plus getting another year from him. As are the 31 other teams exercising the option with their first round picks rather than giving out long-term contracts now."
steelers,320p82,Steinerway,3,Thu Apr 9 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"This is mostly true, however Decastro is a right guard and the option is calculated for offensive linemen, regardless of position. So he's getting paid like a LT while playing RG. His option is $8.07 mil while the highest paid right guard is Marshal Yanda at $6.4 mil and only four right guards making $6 mil or more."
steelers,320p82,steel438692,3,Thu Apr 9 20:21:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely right, I stand corrected. Still, I'm ok with the extra year with no further obligations should the worst happen. At the time of his long-term contract, LaMarr Woodley was as safe of a bet as you could make and we saw how that turned out."

steelers,320p82,zjrk,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:33:52 2015 UTC,It's unlikely that this part of the contract will ever matter.  I expect he'll be signed to an extension that will override that year.  Picking up the option simply gives the team a backup in the event that a deal isn't signed before his fifth year in the league.
steelers,320p82,Azrael412,6,Fri Apr 10 01:37:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I expected this, but yeah I'm glad they did it. We have a solid O-line group and it should continue to get better and better. We should have a dominant offense til Ben retires."

steelers,31zvyu,mrdeepay,9,Thu Apr 9 19:47:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a little torn on that.  There's a lot of weirdness about punishments in the NFL, but for me this isn't a ""weed"" thing or a substance thing. It's a DUI thing.  I'm fully on board with stiff punishments for behavior like this, especially when it's a Pittsburgh player. Can't be abiding that behavior. Discipline and consequences.  Impaired driving isn't a victimless offense, it's an offense which victims avoided."
steelers,31zvyu,zaclacgit,5,Thu Apr 9 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"Impaired driving isn't a victim-less offense, it's an offense which victims avoided.   Sorry, no. It is a victim-less crime. The punishments of the courts (to the extent the judges have discretion) take into account how impaired someone was, past history, and so forth. There is no consideration of victims because there are not any.   If there were a victim, the charge would be DUI + some greater offense or offenses, such as vehicular assault or vehicular homicide.   While it makes for great rhetoric to talk about such counter factuals, by excluding the point that such alternative histories come with a decidedly alternative set of charges and potential penalties confuses the issue. It feels good emotionally, but it is not reasoned discourse."
steelers,31zvyu,kingpatzer,3,Thu Apr 9 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"That makes good and proper sense, and is a valuable distinction where appropriate.  Thanks for providing it.  But we're in the realm of an agreement between the NFL and it's players. You're probably going to find a lot of decisions made on ""feels good"" rather than ""reasoned discourse."" The rhetoric surrounding player behavior, and the effect on the perception of the NFL, can't be ignored.  When the feels become the reals, its a whole different ballgame."
steelers,31zvyu,zaclacgit,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"I don't dispute the fact that this comes down to a contractual negotiation between Bell, the player's union, and the NFL. What I disagree with is any contention that any punishment Bell receives has anything to do with a criminal offense. It does not. I has to do with the NFL wanting to maintain its market share, and not wanting its image tarnished by the actions of NFL players."
steelers,31zvyu,kingpatzer,2,Fri Apr 10 01:30:55 2015 UTC,"While they are serious crimes that warrent punishment... rice initially got 2 games for hitting a woman (you know, before goddell and the ravens had to back track) and he took a plea deal just like bell... so tired of kangaroo court goddell..."
steelers,31zvyu,jayklizzle,2,Thu Apr 9 18:54:37 2015 UTC,Rice and Bell violated completely different policies.  The Personal Conduct Policy allows for arbitrary punishments to be handed out on a case by case basis (what Rice got was pretty much considered the norm)- the Substance Abuse Policy does not.
steelers,31zvyu,mrdeepay,3,Thu Apr 9 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"What I'm confused about is that generally the league doesn't act to suspend someone until the courts are done. Presently, Bell is still in the court program and may or may not actually have a DUI charge based on his completion of the 15-month program he's been enrolled in.   What's going on here that's different from other cases where the league held off until after the courts were done?"
steelers,31zvyu,kingpatzer,12,Thu Apr 9 19:12:15 2015 UTC,Damn well let's hope DeAngelo can have a decent run of games.

I have a friend that's a Falcons fan, and we were texting throughout, and he kept reminding me that Julio was not in the game.  That win would've been a lot sweeter had Julio been in the game."

Peyton Manning lost his deep ball, and the patriots/ravens have both lost allot this off-season, last time we played the Colts we beat the piss out of them. So I'm sticking to my guns on this one, the Steelers will be fine."
steelers,31zvyu,huhwhatweird,2,Thu Apr 9 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"All of this is ridiculous. Manning has never had a deep ball. He's just a surgical master on the field, and he still is. The Patriots took a pretty big hit to their secondary, but I don't think that's going to keep them out of the playoffs as long as Brady is under center. The Ravens biggest loss, IMO, is Kubiak, but I'm not so sure they're going to be awful.  My biggest lol was at the Colts comment. The last time we played the Colts, their running back was a past-his-prime Ahmad Bradshaw, and with no Reggie Wayne. Now they have Frank Gore and Andre Johnson, not to mention the upgrades they made on defense.  I'm all for homerism, but this kool-aid tastes a little strong to me."
steelers,31zvyu,Bad_At_Sports,5,Thu Apr 9 19:02:40 2015 UTC,I said that same thing about the Colts and got down voted to hell. No idea why people think Frank Gore and Andre Johnson make them deadly

I don't know what it is about those guys, and maybe it's because of their shelf life in fantasy, but they just always seem to produce when given the chance.  Andre's got a real QB now. The best guy he's ever had is Matt Schaub. And every year we say to ourselves, ""This is the year Frank Gore slows down,"" and it's never the year. I think he's got one more, Super Bowl push with his old buddy Andre in him, and then he's out. Like the Bus."
steelers,31zvyu,Bad_At_Sports,3,Fri Apr 10 02:35:58 2015 UTC,I don't think he was saying no playoffs for them just the Afc is a little weaker and we should at least make playoff
steelers,31zvyu,jfuss04,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah Peyton never had deep ball, and Frank Gore is allot more in his prime then ahmad Bradshaw. You know what you're talking about, buddy."
steelers,31zvyu,huhwhatweird,0,Thu Apr 9 21:21:39 2015 UTC,"This doesn't have 2014's stats but it's pretty clear that Peyton's ability to throw deep has never been good at the deep ball since he was drafted. It's possible he was worse last year, but c'mon. Don't try to say he had it in the first place.  And a past-his-prime Gore is way better than a past-his-prime Bradshaw, buddy."
steelers,31zvyu,Bad_At_Sports,0,Thu Apr 9 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"Yep. There wasn't a significant drop off in Peyton Mannings deep ball last year, and Frank Gore wasn't a product of his offensive line."

It could have been a huge problem, it's very unsafe and it's not about him it's about those that he could have harmed... Now I have no idea what roads he was on or how far he was going or anything like that, but regardless, he should have known better... What if he had hurt or killed a little kid, or that kids mother, or one of our spouse's?   I'm sick of people on here hoping for a slap on the wrist and whatnot. He made a huge mistake.

In no way am I saying it doesn't impair driving at all, but from personal stories the consensus seems to be that legally driving while completely sober, no substances at all, but overtired after minimal sleep, is even more dangerous than driving after smoking.  Again, not saying he wasn't impaired or did nothing wrong. I'm just saying that we should stop talking like what he did was unforgably stupid and dangerous and he's lucky he didn't pull a Donte Stallworth."

steelers,31zvyu,DKnight32x,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"First, the NFL is not  a duly certified officer of the courts. It is not their role to punish on behalf of society. That is the job of the courts. Bell ""deserves"" nothing from the NFL for his offense. He deserves his day in court, which he has had, and which is likely going to result in the charges being dropped. This means that if the courts drop the charges, the NFL will have punished him for being charged, not for being guilty -- since the charges being dropped is not the equivalent of being found guilty.   Second, had your speculative alternative history come to pass he would have been charged with vehicular assault or other similar charges on top of the DUI charge. Confounding DUI with more serious charges confuses the discussion just as seriously as confusing the NFL with the court system. I am not saying that I endorse DUI offenses. I am saying that DUI is NOT a serious offense in and of itself, as is evidence from the fact that it is not punished as a serious offense.   Third, even with respect to DUI giving a bad image to the NFL, and the NFL punishing on that basis (which I agree they are fully empowered to do), punishing DUI more severely than domestic violence indicates that the NFL feels RISKING POTENTIALLY HURTING people is more serious than ACTUALLY HURTING people. This position is ludicrous on its face."

Not to mention that the Weed Dui only needs .4 Nanograms/ml of the Delta-9 THC cannabinoid metabolite and testimony of a Police DRE expert to say he was driving impaired to establish DUI.  you can have that concentration of metabolite in your system even days after smoking."

steelers,31zvyu,akmalhot,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:13:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, however I'm addressing what you said.  The logic you're using is that because Bell 'did not know' driving stoned was a crime (which he absolutely did), he should not be punished because he did not intend to commit a crime.  Therefore, using that same logic, were he to kill someone, he shouldn't be punished because he did not 'intend' to commit the crime."

steelers,320sx9,DriArcher,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:20:30 2015 UTC,"Well, us hosting him seems to indicate that we would strongly consider it, pending how the meeting goes of course.

steelers,320sx9,slicehix,2,Thu Apr 9 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Edge rusher seems to be deeper than CB, so I'd say CB 1st and edge rusher in 2 of the next 3 picks. When a guy like Lorenzo Mauldin is available in the 3rd, I think we can get 2 quality pass rushers in this draft with a potential shutdown corner."
steelers,320sx9,HopkinsFC,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:39:07 2015 UTC,"True. On the other hand, I would also like to take Ifo if he's still there in the third. Wouldn't be mad with 2 CB's and 1 edge rusher if it plays out that way."
steelers,320sx9,slicehix,2,Fri Apr 10 00:50:42 2015 UTC,I think all of the good edge rushers will be gone by 22 and the rest won't be worth using a first rounder on. So who knows
steelers,320sx9,DriArcher,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think there's 5 edge rushers worth a first round pick. So, it will be interesting to see if any are there and if so, comparing them to who might be available at CB. I just wish the draft would get here soon."
steelers,321heq,ShaquilleO_feel,2,Thu Apr 9 20:38:04 2015 UTC,There's a whole lot of WTF?! in that mock but the Steelers pick does make sense. Kevin Johnson seems to be sliding into being the #3 CB in the draft the closer we get to it and he's a really good fit for the Steelers defense.  That said I don't see the Steelers passing up Marcus Peters if he's there. His character concerns have been overstated and he has the best cover skills of any CB in the draft.
steelers,321heq,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:44:05 2015 UTC,Agree 100%. If Peters (and maybe Waynes) are off the board then this is a pick I'm happy with. But if we pick either of those 2 over Peters then I would have to disagree with their decision making.
steelers,321heq,Volleyball45,2,Fri Apr 10 00:54:07 2015 UTC,I will shit myself in anger if they take Kevin Johnson with Marcus Peters still on the board.

steelers,321ewt,JollyRogers40,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:39:14 2015 UTC,The contract situation is a good point. Spence is on his last year so I could see a team thinking they can just wait a year for him to hit FA without losing a player in the process.
steelers,321ewt,dj0,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:43:56 2015 UTC,I think you're vastly overestimating how often teams trade players in the NFL. No one would try to trade for any of our LBs. It just doesn't make sense.

steelers,321ewt,otnormal,2,Thu Apr 9 22:26:00 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no.  Long answer: Timmons is the one that makes the most sense to trade but I don't think the ~$4MM gained in cap space doesn't cover the loss in production. Shazier, Spence, and Williams are all young and cheap. Timmons is nearing 30 and there is a lot of tread on his tires at this point. At some point they're going to be looking to the future and for that reason I could see them trading or cutting him next offseason if Williams keeps progressing and becomes a good option at the buck. Shazier is clearly the mack of the future. Spence is a good depth option who shouldn't break the bank. Garvin is a very good special teamer and as a 4th/5th option inside I don't see where we'd gain anything by getting rid of him."

steelers,321ewt,otnormal,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:47:44 2015 UTC,Perhaps but it's more than likely that he doesn't have 5 years left playing at the level of the contract he'll command going forward.

steelers,321ewt,Opuski,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:53:41 2015 UTC,"I like this question. It's not very often that there is a chance to make a reasonable trade. ""Log jam"" is also a nice way to put it; we simply shouldn't pay and keep players on the roster who get limited playing time because there's a well stacked position. Then again, it's also true that Spence and Williams are still a bit unproven, and we might end up losing a lot more than we think. However, Ben won't be here for too long, and we might see some rather surprising decisions from the front office, as this current window to win the SB is closing every passing year. A trade could bring us instant value at another position."
steelers,321ewt,SleestakLightning,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:43:36 2015 UTC,"This might be a bit of a homer thing to say, but I'd like to think that the Steelers have somewhat of a good reputation in terms of developing players as they tend to build through drafts. Other teams would probably trust that they're getting what they are seeing in these players (Holmes is another story, he did some stupid stuff to drop his value). And I truly think that the relationship the Cards' Front Office have with ours is a sign that the Steelers can be a good trade partner."

steelers,31v0dh,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:12:01 2015 UTC,"Somewhat questionable is a bit of an understatement and not because of his size. Woodley was a really good athlete at one point with nice burst and power coming around the outside which enabled him to play the position.  I don't see those attributes when I watch Smith. He doesn't have much burst either off the snap or in closing  (ya gotta have at least one of those), he doesn't look like a very good athlete, and he doesn't' bring pressure from the outside wother any real consistency. He has good size and a good motor which sometimes is all you need in college but in the pros there are boxes you generally need to check to succeed and as far as being an OLB goes I just don't see him hitting enough of those boxes.  The Steelers already have one unathletic OLB on the roster in Jarvis Jones, I'd hate to end up with another."
steelers,31v0dh,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:42:40 2015 UTC,"He may not look like an athlete but I'm a big fan of Pernell McPhee, and Preston is almost the same exact size with better measurables at the combine.  Smith's 3 cone drill was the best at the combine by all defensive lineman... And that's a drill that really matters for pass rushers.  I agree about his burst, but I think he has other skills that will make up for it."

Most of the edge rushers in the NFL have decent burst either on the front or back end of the play and the guys who don't typically get relegated into being package specific guys. For all his other good attributes I don't see Preston Smith escaping that role and I think he'll do well in it."

His weakness is considered his body type being more lean than bulky leading to more speed and quickness than strength and power. Another concern is his comfort dropping into coverage.  Golson is a mid-round (projected 4th) CB - very talented and has a lot of strengths, only downside is his size and because of it his tackling radius as well.  He is better in press coverage than zone.  Uzomah is a 7th round TE or FA pickup - Smart, well rounded TE who's very good at everything but not great at any one thing. Considered underutilized in Auburn's passing game, it's believed that he has potential to be a good receiving TE."

steelers,31vzqg,fauxedo,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:32:27 2015 UTC,Then trade out. Our secondary was performing reasonably well when the pass rush was there. The times we got burned on big passes were when we pushed our LBs back and only rushed with three. The scheme works when the personnel are in place and I don't trust a first round corner to perform in a way that is game changing.

steelers,31vzqg,ShaquilleO_feel,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:43:32 2015 UTC,A couple things...  1.) A trade requires a partner.  2.) They got burned on deep passes because of bad safety play but you can't look at the makeup of this roster and think CB isn't a big need.  3.) Marcus Peters is the best CB in the draft and if he's there at 22 he'd be the perfect pick.   4.) You have to trust your rookies to make plays in the modern NFL. The Steelers have let rookies rot on the bench for years because they had the talent in front of them. They don't have that luxury any more.

steelers,31vzqg,yeshua1986,0,Thu Apr 9 02:30:37 2015 UTC,"Not having Peters isn't ""fucking stupid"", it's building a defense how they've built them for the past 20 years. Get a killer pass rush laden with talent, and let the secondary of lower picks play off of them. Projected 1st/2nd round CB's isn't how to do that when pass rush is a dire need. I'd rather they find a trade partner, which come draft time is rarely hard, and pick up an extra pick."
steelers,31vzqg,SleestakLightning,0,Thu Apr 9 13:11:25 2015 UTC,"It is stupid. He's the #1 CB in the draft and you don't even have him on your board? Dumb.  If you think taking an OLB in the 1st round just to take an OLB is a good idea then you're an idiot.   You have to worry about value. Reaching for an OLB because ""pass rush is the greatest need"" is how you end up with inferior talent at multiple positions.  But I'm also going to let you in on a little secret. Are you ready?  The Steelers are comfortable with their depth at OLB. Not only that but we've seen proof that under modern NFL rules with modern offenses that you can't expect the pass rush to win you games alone. You need CBs who can cover and make plays.   The Steelers neglect changing with the times way too much for their own good. But I think they're starting to recognize that now too thankfully."

I never said take an OLB just to take an OLB, I said the most important part of the Steelers defense is the pass rush, and that's the first thing we need to fix. Anybody who has paid attention to how the team has built under Colbert, Cowher, and Tomlin should recognize that the secondary is always a product of the pass rush. We've had fans crying for better cornerbacks since Woodson left, and in that time our defenses have pretty successful. Reason being, pass rush.  I'm going to let you in on a little secret, ok? The OLB's on this team are Arthur Moats, Jarvis Jones, and James Harrison. I don't think a single person, fan or employee, is comfortable with that depth. Unless you think Howard Jones is about to blow up, we need a pass rusher as much as we need a cornerback. If Colbert doesn't think Peters is worth the 22nd pick either, and is therefore a reach, he's not going to take Peters. The actual most important thing in modern defenses is linebackers who can get to the QB and play coverage well.  They will reach on a pass rusher before they reach on a CB 10/10 times."

I'm not sure that makes him ""fucking stupid"".    Every GM makes mistakes. Colbert's missed on more picks in recent years than he's hit on. Every team does. But you can actually watch Marcus Peters play and see that he's the perfect CB for the Steelers. He's big, he's physical, he's a willing tackler, he plays the run well. He's the prototypical Steelers starting CB except he can also cover.

We've had fans crying for better cornerbacks since Woodson left, and in that time our defenses have pretty successful. Reason being, pass rush.   Yeah the pass rush is important when opposing QBs are able to stand there and throw the ball to a wide open receiver 3 seconds after the snap on every play. It's so easy to combat the pass rush in the modern NFL. The most successful defenses aren't doing it with outside pass rush alone anymore. But why should the Steelers change to match up with the Seattles of the world. Their strategy has won them zero playoff games in 6 years.   I'm going to let you in on a little secret, ok?

If Colbert doesn't think Peters is worth the 22nd pick either, and is therefore a reach, he's not going to take Peters.    Colbert's goal every year before the draft is to get the team into a position where they don't have to draft for need and can go BPA, especially in the early rounds. I think it's safe to assume that he did that by signing Harrison. They love Moats. They signed Shawn Lemon from Canada. They brought Deebo back. Obviously they feel Jarvis Jones can play or they wouldn't have drafted him.   I think they're comfortable with what they have a CB too. But the Steelers don't reach for players in the First Round. They stick to their board and go BPA. They do set up their board to take need into account but if a CB is #1 on their board when they pick, they're going CB. To leave the best CB in the whole draft completely off your board because of perceived ""character issues"" is dumb.   The actual most important thing in modern defenses is linebackers who can get to the QB and play coverage well.   That's an interesting theory. Did you know that Seattle has had the #1 defense in the NFL in the past two seasons and they finished 8th and 22nd overall in team sacks over that time frame?  Top 5 in 2013  Carolina, Buffalo, St. Louis, New Orleans, New England  Top 5 in 2014  Buffalo, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Giants, Kansas City  If you round that out to the Top 10 you'll see a whole lot of mediocre teams and defenses who racked up a ton of sacks but couldn't stop teams from scoring."
steelers,31vzqg,tstscavo,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:33:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right on Peters being the prototypical talent, but if Colbert sees something off, at this point I'll trust him. Sure, every GM makes mistakes (Ziggy Hood- a DE, no less), but I think he warrants at least the benefit of the doubt. He's made some questionable moves, and they've mostly out. If I'm wrong to trust him here, I'll be the first to admit it.  Shawn Lemon is as unknown as Howard Jones, and honestly, so is Jarvis. I personally think he can play, but I'm not comfortable depending on it. Cortez Allen has had more NFL success than Jarvis, and I feel similarly about Allen in terms of shaky confidence that he'll be back to where he was. That leaves us with 36 year old Deebo and Arthur Moats. I'm very fond of both, but they're both situational right now. Unless Lemon and Jones are diamonds in the rough, I'm way more worried about that then I am Gay, Allen, and Blake.   You keep comparing us to Seattle, it's important to note that as great as their secondary is, one of the key cogs to the defense is how well their LB's can cover. I didn't say pure pass rushing was the most important, as pure sack numbers would suggest, I said LB's that could do both. I stand by that. I'd take a pass rusher with coverage skills over a CB every time, no matter where Seattle lined up in sack numbers. If I'm not mistaken, the only pure pass rusher they have is Bruce Irvin."

It is HIGHLY unlikely that there is good value at OLB at #22. A decent chance that Marcus Peters is still there though. Eli Harold is a terrible pick at #22. He's an even worse athlete than Jarvis Jones who was historically one of the worst combine athletes ever.

The Steelers don't use their OLBs in that way. They may drop into the flat to cover an RB but they're not used as pure coverage guys that much.   But it's funny that you want a guy who can cover and rush the passer and still advocate picking an OLB at 22 when there will be no one of that ilk available by the time the Steelers pick."

Regional importance, with the Steelers first having success as the town was entering a bleak time of mill closings is another good one. It created an extremely unique relationship between the team and the fans.  Ernie Holmes was one of the Steel Curtain DL, and he suffered from a mental illness. During one offseason, he had an episode of extreme paranoia where he thought he was being followed by tractor trailers, so he pulled over on a highway and started shooting at the tires. When the police sent a helicopter after him, he starting shooting at the helicopter. Eventually he was arrested, and team founder/owner Art Rooney personally paid for his legal fees and any mental help he would receive while guaranteeing he'd stay with the team. This was back in 1972, when mental health wasn't something that many people cared much about. Art Rooney was one of the best people to have ever been involved in football, and his legacy passed on to his son Dan, the current owner (although his son, Art II, handles day-to-day business) and a US ambassador to Ireland.  Another fun story, Art won $3,000 (I think it was 3) at a horse track in 1933 and used that money money to create the Steelers. Despite nearly folding during the war years, having to separately merge with the Eagles and Cardinals (Steagles and Card-Pitt), that $3K investment is now worth multiple billions."

steelers,31nxnh,Opuski,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:48:05 2015 UTC,"After watching this GIF in awe for about five times in a row, I took a closer look at the play. The Bengals are rushing with six, while the Steelers have their tight ends picking up the OLBs. Spaeth's man is not even given a blitz assignment, but comes rushing a little late after seeing the TE is committed to blocking. Losing by a touchdown in the 4th Q, The Bengals have to be enticed with a ""safe"" blitz on a 1st & 10 from the 6 yd line. Ben sees a great chance at a heart-breaking bomb, with both WRs streaking vs single-high man coverage. If you look closely, you'll also see Ben look away from Bryant right after the play-fake, just to make sure he gets the FS away from Bryant. A simple play, but a perfectly timed call.   On another side note, it makes perfect sense to assign the TEs to pick the blitz (even in a potentially dangerous field position), given that they don't have to block the bigger 3-4 OLBs, who are typically more talented as pass rushers, as the Bengals don't play 3-4 defense. Low risk, high reward."

steelers,31jrv9,steelflapjack,11,Sun Apr 5 19:42:21 2015 UTC,"Shamarko Thomas and Mike Mitchell at least have talent and work ethic.  Gay is a solid veteran, and Allen has talent but was defeated mentally last year. I'm not sure Jones or moats are all that talented, and as to the former positions mentioned, there's not much talent behind them. I think the defensive line has the most talent and is closely tied with inside linebacker. McCullers is a freak of nature, McClendon is a solid talent who's incredibly smart and almost always in position, heyward is a baller, and stephon tuitt might be the most gifted of all of them. Inside linebacker it seems timmons is the man, all around leader and gifted athlete, you have shazier who is the most gifted athlete with all pro potential. Vince Williams is a thumper, more suited for the buck position because he's a downhill player, and an incredibly smart vocal leader. Spence is kind of a poor man's Ryan shazier, he's just not as quick as he once was, but came back solidly from his injury. Yes, our entire defensive backfield is a question mark, yes our outside linebackers are in the same shape. But we do have solid starters and pros on the field who could help lead young draft picks. I don't think the defense will be good, but its not really anymore dire than last year. I'd say its probably better, atleast we have new answers rather than relying on the same old ones.

steelers,31o2mn,Daddym89,19,Mon Apr 6 20:32:23 2015 UTC,"Collins is great, in today's nfl you need guys who can both shoot through gaps to stop the run as well as cover backs and tight ends on short to intermediate routes.  And with Polamalu possibly retiring the Steelers are left with only Mike Mitchell, Shamarko Thomas, Lawrence Timmons, Ryan Shazier, Sean Spence, and Terrence Garvin to fill that role.  Oh, wait, that's right, that's actually by far the deepest skill set on the defense, and the Steelers have a higher need for literally anything else on that side of the ball."

steelers,31n6ri,social_psycho,3,Mon Apr 6 17:08:13 2015 UTC,The average is misleading. He was averaging something like 45 sacks a year with that imbecile Arians calling the shots. The fact that we are at 38 illustrates that Haley's offense is protecting him because it would take a few down years pull the average downward.

steelers,31gsz1,akatora,8,Sat Apr 4 23:28:55 2015 UTC,"Another point of reference for Shazier's potential is the playoff game against the Ravens. Really, really like what he showed against the run on some plays in that game."
steelers,31gsz1,BTCru,13,Sat Apr 4 23:52:23 2015 UTC,I also liked his head up play on that game. The Ravens running back fumbled. Instead of diving for the ball he dragged the running back away from the ball (which I didn't even know was legal) and let another team-mate recover the ball.
steelers,31gsz1,ProfessorChaos5049,6,Sun Apr 5 00:21:43 2015 UTC,"I loved that play because it showed both good awareness and a willingness to play team ball rather than seeking glory for himself.. which is something you always want to see in a rookie, especially on defense."

steelers,31gsz1,lance-,9,Mon Apr 6 02:25:59 2015 UTC,"1) Bryant, 2) Shazier, 3) Tuitt, 4) Archer, 5) McCullers is the order I'd put them in."
steelers,31gsz1,BTCru,2,Sat Apr 4 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"I want to agree on 1 principle. If LeBeau stayed I would put Bryant 3rd, but I'm not exactly sure what changes Butler is going to make. Bryant's biggest set back was being injured at the beginning of the season whereas Tuitt and Shazier (yes I know his injury set him back too) was getting to really know the system. If Shazier stays healthy, I can see him potentially making more of a leap. And if the changes aren't to great, potentially even Tuitt making more of a leap. But since Haley is still the OC, I'm going to have to concur."
steelers,31gsz1,plusblink41,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:35:53 2015 UTC,I don't remember Bryant being hurt. I thought they just sat him the first couple of weeks because he wasn't NFL ready.  When did he get hurt?

steelers,31gsz1,plusblink41,7,Tue Apr 7 16:55:58 2015 UTC,bryant was already a god in some games so hopefully he can continue
steelers,31gsz1,kitchenmaniac111,6,Sun Apr 5 01:13:36 2015 UTC,"Bob Labriola says:   ""I think you and all Steelers fans are going to be impressed when they get their first look at the 2015 version of Daniel McCullers. Letâs just say he hasnât been spending a lot of time so far this offseason sprawled on a couch eating cookies.""   (I'm excited)"
steelers,31gsz1,ctornync,4,Sun Apr 5 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"I hope it's Flex, but realistically I see Tuitt or Martavis having the biggest improvement from last year. Tuitt because he flashed towards the end of last year, and as a rookie on our defense that excites me. Martavis because hopefully he'll come in knowing substantially more of the playbook so can contribute more than just running deep, and hopefully we can integrate him better in the redzone."
steelers,31gsz1,IDontNeedThisIndigo,3,Sun Apr 5 01:20:17 2015 UTC,I'm really high on Tuitt. I really like his work ethic and his passion. I hope he gets more playing time.
steelers,31gsz1,tstscavo,3,Sun Apr 5 04:44:34 2015 UTC,"On Bryant:    and his hands are still iffy, evident from the jump balls he wasn't able to secure   When it came to jump balls I never got the feeling his hands were iffy. He just never fought for the ball to go up and get it. There are a few examples I can think of where he never jumped for the jump ball. Not even to play defense and try to stop an interception. A little effort would have been nice on those plays. Even if he didn't come down with it, at least pretend to try.   That said, I still expect him to slide into the No 2 role and do a nice job.   On Tuitt:   This guy is everything you want from a 2 gap DE. I expect him to show the most growth on defense. Assuming Shazier makes the jump, he will overshadow Tuitt, but I expect Tuitt to show more growth. More than anyone else actually. I expect a lot from him.   Shazier:   I feel like I hardly got to know him in his first season. I remember thinking a couple of times ""nice open field tackle"" and ""he needs to shed blocks better"" but aside from that I don't remember too much about him. I guess he really didn't play enough for me to get a full impression of him. He had high expectations to live up to last year, and they still stand. I think regardless of how great he is people will be dick-riding pretty hard and make him out to be better than he is. I expect a small step forwards from him, but not as much as other guys.   McCullers:  A project of a player from the start, big and strong and needing to improve technique and lower his center of gravity. He'll probably only see the field a few times this season. I think the going into his third season is where we'll see some growth.  Dri Archer:   I think he can be talented. But I just don't see him working out. After seeing Haley with McCluster in KC and Rainey before and now Archer I get the feeling that Haley really likes the idea of this kind of WR/RB/Athlete type player, but never really knows how to use them. Archer will improve as a football player, but Haley's use of him will not improve, and we won't see much of a difference. He also needs to run harder, because it seems he goes down on first contact too often. Again, I just don't see it working out for him."
steelers,31gsz1,DriArcher,3,Sun Apr 5 21:33:28 2015 UTC,I think the team will need them to all make strides. But I think Shazier is going to be the most visible next season.
steelers,31gsz1,fearstrikesout,4,Sat Apr 4 23:52:40 2015 UTC,I'm going to say Tuitt. Bryant raised the bar pretty high for himself this past year.
steelers,31gsz1,Kofile,3,Sat Apr 4 23:57:09 2015 UTC,anything at all from archer would be a huge leap.
steelers,31gsz1,MattEven,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:12:39 2015 UTC,"Bryant. He should be the WR2 coming out of camp, Wheaton has the size and quicks to excel more in the slot. Bryant's size/speed combo should rarely ever be off of the field. He's a true gamebreaker and has a skill set that nobody else in the WR corps can duplicate."

steelers,31gsz1,tstscavo,-6,Mon Apr 6 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's between Tuitt and McCullers.  My worry is Bryant is going to regress a little bit with the expectations and pressure on him, and I personally have written off Shazier as a bust (I know it's way too early to do that, and he's shown flashes of being a good player, but it's just a gut feeling)."
steelers,31gsz1,IMregisterred,2,Sun Apr 5 04:10:00 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give you a upvote, but it's way too early to call Shazier a bust."
steelers,31gsz1,Steinerway,2,Sun Apr 5 07:56:37 2015 UTC,"Did you watch Shazier when he wasn't hurt? He's comparable to CJ mosely, who was outstanding."
steelers,31gsz1,Steinerway,7,Sun Apr 5 09:30:07 2015 UTC,"Seems like not many people watched Shazier when he wasn't hurt. I've said it quite a few times, but the current Mosely vs Shazier comparisons remind me of the perceptions of Lacy vs Bell and Zeitler vs DeCastro after each respective rookie year. You'd think that after two consecutive years of the same thing, people would take a step back and think ""Hmm, maybe I shouldn't jump to conclusions after a player's first season."" Hell, you'd think they'd have learned that from watching football at all for a few years, not just specifically those examples from the past two seasons.  Edit: I grammar nazi'd myself. I won't do it again for this edit."

steelers,31f3zr,CHE36,2,Sat Apr 4 22:48:06 2015 UTC,Probably rotating in on the outsides. Mostly with Jarvis

steelers,31f3zr,huhwhatweird,5,Sat Apr 4 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"I'll give you that we'd probably need a pass rusher at DE but they have 3 true 4-3 DTs in Heyward, Tuitt (both could play the 3 tech and were considered swing 3/5 guys coming out of college and both could probably handle the 7), and McCullers (he's a classic 1 tech) and another in McLendon who would probably succeed in 4 man fronts as a 1 tech given his pass rushing skill."

Sorry to be a meany, but I just don't see that happening. 3-4 is our BASE D and it will stay that way. However, 90% of the NFL is playing a version of Nickle D where there is no NT/DT on the field at all. The Steelers are one of those teams. Sub package football is the future of Dfence.  It is implored more than 65% of the plays called on D. That's why CB & Safety's  equity values have risen tremendously the past few seasons."
steelers,31f3zr,heavymedicine,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:29:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on how big/small you want to go but in general I think the following fit:  DTs: Heyward, McLendon, McCullers, Tuitt   DEs: Tuitt, Heyward, draft pick pass rusher, Harrison, J. Jones, maybe Lemon.   WLB: Timmons (he was compared to Derrick Brooks coming out of FSU), Shazier, Moats, H. Jones   MLB: Shazier, Spence   SLB: Moats, V. Williams, J.

steelers,31dn36,Steinerway,4,Sat Apr 4 17:53:28 2015 UTC,"Last year, this same user ran a bet. If the steelers selected a tackle in the first round, 20 people would give him reddit gold. If the steelers drafted a cb in the first, he would give those 20 users gold. Since we drafted a linebacker, nobody had to pay up"
steelers,31dn36,meowdy,4,Sat Apr 4 18:14:53 2015 UTC,It came to be VERY annoying honestly.
steelers,31dn36,ColdNose,2,Sat Apr 4 19:35:37 2015 UTC,It made the draft BERY interesting Honestly.
steelers,31dn36,Steinerway,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"As I said I'm new here, but I wouldn't be surprised with the ""VERY annoying"" evaluation. I'm all for differing opinions and I believe in BPA rather than reaching for a position of need...but how in the world can you justify offensive line being a need at all? Let alone not going OL in the first last year, we didn't go OL until the fifth round...and let that guy just get picked up for nothing off our practice squad."
steelers,31dn36,Steinerway,2,Mon Apr 6 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"So let's recap the 2014 Draft; Lb, DE, RB, WR, CB, OT, etc.  Your point about us taking a OL in the fifth round is now put into perspective, right?  As it appears we also selected a CB in the fifth round...  ANYWAY.  My reasoning for wanting an OT 1st round last year is plain and simple.  Look at the OLine performance in 2013.  It was so good that our OLine coach was fired.  It was so good that everyone was ready to throw Todd Haley out.  It was that fucking good.  But everyone points to the final 4 games and how much the ""OLine and together.""  That's a crock of shit.  Well we hire Munchak.  And this entire sub thought that Mumchak would turn a wet paper towel into a Pro Bowl OLineman.  Seriously, the amount of dick sucking for Munchak going on here was amazing.  Needless to say, I feel a coach can only do so much, and I wasn't an immediate cock gobbler for Munchak.  Well this whole sub was ready to anoint Munchak as Jesus Christ 2.0, and was convinced to the point that they'd wager their life we'd go CB in round 1...  So I used my logic and came up with the friendly draft wager."
steelers,31dn36,Steinerway,3,Tue Apr 7 02:01:23 2015 UTC,"Well no my point about taking OL that late isn't really put into any new perspective, but anyway...  To be brutally honest, sounds like you're basing your prediction on other people's knee-jerk reactions, and your own broad end-of-season evaluation without looking at specifics. I don't see much logic.  An example of the knee-jerk reactions of others: Wanting Haley out. I agree it was widespread...and it was also fucking stupid. 2012 started great until Ben broke his collarbone. Haley's fault? No, yet people blamed him for the way the offense performed with a third string QB and then Ben with a broken collarbone...without really considering the fact that it was a third string QB and Ben with a broken collarbone. But the relevant point: Nothing really about the OL. 2013 finished great once the OL gelled around Fernando Velasco, which brings me to my response to you thinking that it's ""a crock of shit"" that people thought it was a big deal that the OL came together...  How long do you think it takes for a team to gel around a player signed off the street midseason? Especially when that player is the offensive center, taking over for the leader of the OL who makes all the calls and adjustments and knows the playbook better than everyone but the QB? I don't know about you, but I'd estimate about 7 games. Plus that little detail about Mike Adams being benched...but if you want to lump the first four games in with the final 7 for the sake of going against the grain, that's your prerogative. But it's not outlandish to say that how they played after spending eight games gelling with a street free agent center, four games with a new left tackle, can be weighed more heavily when making predictions for the future than during those games while they were coming together/starting the LT who was eventually benched.  And Munchak being ""Jesus Christ 2.0."" Of course he was Jesus Christ. He had been the best OL coach of the past two decades during his tenure in Tennessee. That's not praising him because he's the new OL coach in Pittsburgh, that's praising him because he was the best fucking OL coach of the past two decades. If he had gone to Green Bay, he would have been the Jesus Christ of their offensive line. If he had gone to Baltimore, he would have been Jesus Christ for their offensive line. If he had gone to coach the East Central Community College Warriors in Decatur, Mississippi, he would have been the Jesus Christ of their offensive line. So yeah, I'm sure the amount of dick sucking for Munchak was amazing. Because he deserves his dick to be sucked that amount.  But the real kicker: After the performance last year, all these ""OL came together"" and ""Munchak is Jesus Christ!"" people were proven right. So, again. Do you legitimately think the team needs an offensive lineman? Or are you just playing devil's advocate to go against the grain for the sake of playing devil's advocate and going against the grain?"
steelers,31dn36,Tomakis,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:30:53 2015 UTC,"Very well thought out.  I am impressed.  Did we ""need"" a C when we took Pouncey?  Did we need a G when we took DeCastro?  Not really, they more fit the mold of BPA.  We did so, in my opinion, to address Ben's longevity and to, right or wrong, restore some legitimacy to our OLine.  Fact of the matter is that since the Steelers lost Faneca, Hartings, and Marvel Smith; their offensive lines were a joke.  Ben won a Super Bowl behind the worst offensive line in NFL history.  Ben also ran for his life and his jersey at the end of nearly every game looked like was rolling around in the mud.    So we take DeCastro and Pouncey.  And holy shit out internal line play is lights out.  Save for the occasional play where I still see Pouncey blown off the ball by a BJ Raji type NT.  Regardless...  Running plays involving a pulling guard are money in the bank, and for the most part so is pass protection, WITH THE CAVEAT that this is all along the interior line.  Exterior line... Not so much.  Our OT play to this day is serviceable at best.   You had cum dripping from your chin regarding Munchak, which is understandable given the miracle he performed last year... But disregarded entirely a logical assertion of mine.  Let me caps it for your so you can see; A COACH CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH WITH THE TALENT HE HAS.  Look at our OLine play against teams with stud DLines/pass rushers over the past 2-years.  How do we fare?  Where is the pressure comming from, 90% of the time?  To me, I see edge rushers lick their lips everytime they see the Steelers on their schedule board because we have an undersized UDFA at LT and a revolving door of draft busts at RT.  The only time our OT play is decent is when Heath stays behind to help.  But then you are sacrificing one of our best players on that given play.  I would say that I pride myself in marching to the beat of my own drum.  But I don't do so for the sake of being an ass.  I only do so if I feel I have presented a logical reason for it.    Lastly, you have the benefit of hindsight being 20/20.  I don't think you can honestly ignore the performance of the OLine this last year under the tutilidge of your lord and savior Munchak.  And make no mistake they played impressively.  I feel this is clouding your judgement just a bit, on what is your perceived ridiculousness, on my behalf."
steelers,31dn36,ColdNose,1 point,Tue Apr 7 10:04:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I often like to say âIâm not as dumb as I look,â but that joke doesnât work so well on an anonymous message board.  Thatâs a bit of a contradiction. The offensive lines were jokes, but Pouncey and DeCastro werenât âneeds?â Wouldnât you âneedâ to address the âjokes?â And Iâm not sure why youâd think that replacing the uninspiring Justin Hartwig and rotation of poo there was at RG (Legursky? A young Ramon Foster who was merely on his way to becoming the player he is today? Trai Fucking Essex???) was merely BPA rather than need. Those players needed to be replaced.  And that reminds me of another reason to have been excited this time last year for the offensive line in 2014. In addition to the fact that the final seven games really were more telling than the first nine for reasons other than fitting the âGood means more than bad!â agenda, and the fact that the Munchak dick sucking was well deserved: this would be the first time Pouncey and DeCastro were together. In 2012, DeCastro missed all but the final three games. 2013, Pouncey missed all but the first 8 snaps. This was the first time they were play extensively together, and it paid off. Believe it or not, I used to agree that Pouncey was grossly overrated and struggled against Ngata and Wilfork-type NTs (except for the one game against the Patriots in 2011 against Wilfork himself, ironically). But he lived up to his reputation last year. It was the best season of his career, and these segues are falling in place perfectly for me, but a lot of that was probably due to Munchak.  So now I get to talk about your next point about Munchak and how coaches can only do so much with the talent theyâre given! No, the cum dripping from my chin regarding Munchak is not understandable given the miracle he performed last year. It was understandable given his track record the previous 20 years, and it goes without saying heâs had varying level of talents to work with in the 15 years he was in Tennessee. It also goes without saying that Pouncey and DeCastro are phenomenal talents that would make a good coach drool as much as fans of the team that good coach is joining will drool. You mention Kelvin Beachum, an undersized 7th round (not UDFA) LT. Heâs a technician. Munchak is a technician. Itâs a match made in heaven! You wouldnât expect a 5â10â receiver with 4.5 speed to become arguably the best, and inarguably the most productive, player at his position in the entire league but thatâs exactly what Antonio Brown has done. Not to say that Beachum will reach Brown levels of awesome, just saying that sometimes measurables arenât the be all end all. And while itâs true that Marcus Gilbert (I almost typed Justinâ¦shudder) started slow and had an awful first two games, he got himself out of his own head and played the rest of his season like he earned his contract. Yeah the OT play wasnât as dominating as the interior line, but it was still pretty damn good. Heath isnât one of our best players anymore, he hasnât been his same since his torn ACL in December of 2012. Heâs been gradually rehabbing and getting better, and obviously was much better in 2014 than 2013, but Iâm skeptical that at 32 years old heâll completely return to form. And with Brown, Bryant, Wheaton and Bell, who cares? And if it helped produce the #2 offense, again, who cares? If it works, it works. And a big reason why it worked is because of the offensive line that was a great combination of talent and good coaching. Just as people were saying it would be last year.  As for how they play against stud pass rush teamsâ¦thatâs kind of what makes them stud pass rush teams. The fact that they can still play well against good offensive lines. I wonât expect this offensive line to play against Deacon Jones the same way it played against the Bengals. And the best part is that for as good as the OL was last year, theyâre still growing. The ages on opening day will be, from left to right, Beachum to Gilbert: 26, 29, 26, 25, 27. Theyâre still growing. The best two are the 25 year old and one of the 26 year olds, and again, last season was the first time they ever played extensively together.  And I agree that I hate hindsight and changing opinions because of thatâ¦but weâre talking about what should be done for the future. What players will be drafted. What else is there to look at besides hindsight with this discussion? The young, growing offensive line, with the best position coach of the past two decades no matter what team he coaches on, played very well. Yes that takes hindsight to seeâ¦but why would you look at anything else? Unless youâre referring to âHindsight is 20/20, youâre talking about how good they became during the 2014 regular season!â when the entire discussion is about predictions made during the 2014 offseason. Which, again, we can all agree turned out to be correct."
steelers,31dn36,heavymedicine,2,Tue Apr 7 19:42:41 2015 UTC,I believe we'll go o-line before DB.
steelers,31boqt,heavymedicine,12,Fri Apr 3 16:31:46 2015 UTC,Even before this I wanted the Steelers to stay far away from PJ Williams. The guy is one of the most grabby CBs i've ever seen and while that may fly in college in the NFL that's a good way to become a PI machine. He was also pretty bad in zone coverage which is kind of a big deal considering how much zone the Steelers ask their CBs to play in. He also has zero interest in coming up in run support. He's got some nice physical attributes but i'd stay well away from him even if he slides.  The Steelers are also pretty serious about not drafting guys with drug/alcohol issues (Mike Adams being the only notable exception).
steelers,31boqt,PomfAndCircvmstance,7,Fri Apr 3 17:18:17 2015 UTC,I think they really learned after the 2012 draft with Ta'amu and Rainey.
steelers,31boqt,ColdNose,5,Fri Apr 3 17:26:11 2015 UTC,"for the limited amount of looks Rainey got, he showed consistent flashes of talent."
steelers,31boqt,otnormal,4,Fri Apr 3 18:10:04 2015 UTC,I disagree. I think he played like horse shit
steelers,31boqt,ColdNose,2,Sun Apr 5 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"..... that's gone public. How come we didn't hear nearly as much about teams having/drafting/signing players w/ drug&alcohol problems before the age of the ""smart phone""? Today's game is much more scrutinized and leaks happen to get out more often than not, but these organizations want to WIN. If true talent is there, the roll of the dice will take place.   .... and some teams like the /r/bengals give ZERO fucks about public perception regarding a players off the field issues"
steelers,31boqt,ColdNose,9,Fri Apr 3 17:49:19 2015 UTC,Hes a borderline first rounder. I doubt he slides far. Late 2nd early 3rd at the latest.
steelers,31boqt,Volleyball45,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:38:11 2015 UTC,"Late 2nd would be sexy if we got Bud Dupree, or another tier 1/2 OLB pass rusher....   Or.. think about if we grabbed Landon Collins in the 1st, Hau'Oli Kikaha in the 2nd and PJ in the 3rd. He might even be worth moving up early in the 3rd round if he is still available.."
steelers,31boqt,PomfAndCircvmstance,6,Fri Apr 3 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"No thanks on Landon Collins.  I'd be happy with Eli Harold, Marcus Peters, Jalen Collins, Kevin Johnson, or Ronald Darby (my personal favorite) in the first.  Second round obviously depends on what happens in round one.  But guys like Kikaha, Nate Orchard, Ordighizuwa, or Byron Jones (if he lasts, kinda doubtful) would be good."
steelers,31boqt,ColdNose,3,Fri Apr 3 16:50:51 2015 UTC,This. I really love Darby too. I'd be hesitant to grab him in the first but if we somehow knew he wouldn't be there in the second and there weren't any other top tier/need-filling players on the board I could live with the pick in the first.
steelers,31boqt,JonVig,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:13:51 2015 UTC,"Darby in the first? That seems like a really big stretch to me.  I believe he is a round 2 pick at the highest. His measurables are nice, but he doesn't have much ""on tape"".  Steelers scouting department try to play safe with the 1st round picks. You will hear Colbert say "" This kid is special"" Not sure that is the words for Ronald .The same goes for Jalen Collins. Only a 10 game starter. They are both young and have lots of room to grow, I wouldnt be upset if we picked either one.  Marcus Peters is probably the most talented CB in the draft, but he also has off field issues.    However, who are we? What do we know? I know its fun to speculate, but even the big dogs make mistakes.  Jarvis will need to step up big this season otherwise the term bust will gain credibility when mentioning his name. Also, we took a big risk last year in the 3rd round on Dri Archer.  We could have taken any of the following CB's Jaylen Watkins , Ross Cockwell, Aaron Colvin, Keith McGill. I would trade Dri for any of them straight up today."
steelers,31boqt,huhwhatweird,4,Fri Apr 3 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"Darby in the first? That seems like a really big stretch to me.   Ronald Darby has been criminally underrated by many draftniks despite the fact that a lot of teams have expressed interest in him and there's rumblings of him going way earlier than many people expect.  It's easy to see why. The guy is a terrific athlete, has displayed really nice ball and cover skills, and was so good in college that teams would often refuse to throw at him. I don't know why he isn't getting the hype of guys like Jalen Collins or Kevin Johnson but both physically and from a game tape standpoint there's no reason he shouldn't be competing with those guys to be the 3rd CB off the board."
steelers,31boqt,JohnnyAcqua,3,Fri Apr 3 17:22:57 2015 UTC,I agree about Darby's measurable's.  Mike Mayock was cumming in his pants during the combine. You know a player is good when Mayock gets so excited talking about people he starts gleeking spit all over the set & cameras.
steelers,31boqt,Simsams,3,Fri Apr 3 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"I like Darby mostly because he only gave up like 1 touchdown in his career at FSU but you're probably right that he'd be a reach at 22.  Like you said, this is all just fun speculation that ultimately means nothing."
steelers,31boqt,stuckmeformypaper,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:14:11 2015 UTC,"I doubt he drops at all because of this. I'd love to see him fall to us, but it seems very unlikely."
steelers,31boqt,TombaFan123,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:13:47 2015 UTC,"No way in the 1st. They're not going to do that when in all likelihood they could snag him in the 2nd. Then, it all depends who's still there/who's been drafted for him to go to the Steelers in the 2nd. And the Steelers have taken on guys who've fucked up right before the draft really early (Santonio Holmes, Mike Adams)... But Theres no way we could pass on him in the 3rd."
steelers,31boqt,MattEven,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"PJ Williams is only in consideration for us if he is in the second round, and that's only if we pick a OLB/EDGE in the first. The reason is because he is not an NFL starting CB, he can play nickel packages, but he is mainly a Safety. He is a great tackler and knows how to play the ball in the air, but he is okay at best at playing on the outside. I believe he will probably not drop at all because of this situation. He will most likely be drafted late second round/early third, dont see him being a reasonable selection for us. The only case scenario is that if we take a true CB in the first (Trae Waynes, Marcus Peters, Kevin Johnson, Jalen Collins, Ronald Darby)."
steelers,31boqt,taryuken,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:44:49 2015 UTC,"If he falls to the 3rd Rd, Take him."
steelers,31c8zi,ScarySwampert,3,Fri Apr 3 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"The guy looks like an H-back to me. Solid blocker, good hands out of the back field, not fast or quick enough to get separation against NFL players and those short arms are going to make it real difficult for him to make contested catches agains NFL Safeties/LBers.  If he were a little bit more athletic and had longer arms I'd like him as a TE but there are certain attributes that you generally need to play TE in the NFL and I just don't see enough of those attributes in O'Leary."
steelers,31c8zi,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:46:04 2015 UTC,"Spaaaaaaaeeeeth? How long is he gonna be good for? And, Heath aside, why haven't we been able to find another Eric Green?"
steelers,31c8zi,flakAttack510,3,Sat Apr 4 03:13:31 2015 UTC,I really like him as a 3rd or 4th round pick.  He's a hell of a blocker and is great at slipping through the coverage for an easy catch.  He's got great hands but isn't going to pick up much after the catch.  Sounds very familiar.
steelers,31c8zi,huhwhatweird,2,Fri Apr 3 19:35:35 2015 UTC,I would rather just wait until Heath is actually gone to get his replacement. The killer B's are going to get it done on offense I would rather see the Steelers draft some defensive depth in the first 4 rounds.
steelers,31c8zi,SteelHurtin56,2,Fri Apr 3 20:22:56 2015 UTC,"If we wait until he's gone, how will he mentor the new TE? I don't think it's wise to wait until Heath is retired to look for his replacement."
steelers,31c8zi,huhwhatweird,0,Sun Apr 5 15:17:59 2015 UTC,"Mentoring younger players isn't something that's required of older players its just something that sometimes happens. We NEED a pass rush, we NEED better coverage. We don't need tip draft a young TE so heath can tutor him."
steelers,31c8zi,SteelHurtin56,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:27:54 2015 UTC,Do you think it's impossible to draft a TE and an OLB in the same year? You're logic doesn't make any sense.

steelers,31c8zi,SteelHurtin56,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:33:13 2015 UTC,You didn't say anything. There's no reason to not draft a TE in one of the first four rounds.
steelers,31c8zi,steelbydesign,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:46:49 2015 UTC,"Heath's going into a contract year, and very well may walk after 2015.  Tight end is a position that's not easy to take over as a rookie. Even guys drafted pretty high like Tyler Eifert & Eric Ebron had very little rookie impact.  Now is the right time to find a backup."

steelers,31c8zi,Kofile,0,Sat Apr 4 00:31:51 2015 UTC,"James is more of a round 3-5 guy. To me he has more upside than O'Leary, but O'Leary is probably more ""pro-ready"" right now."
steelers,31c8zi,steelbydesign,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:02:08 2015 UTC,"YAWN  O'Leary is a smaller, less athletic, worse blocking Heath Miller. Guy's like O'Leary are not hard to find.  I'd rather take a chance on Jesse James out of Penn St. O'Leary is way more pro ready, but James actually has some upside to eventually scare people in the passing game. O'Leary's ceiling is probably like Zach Miller."
steelers,31c8zi,losferwords,-1,Tue Apr 7 18:15:04 2015 UTC,Nope. No TE until 6 or 7. We need CB and Safeties - all first 4 picks at least!
steelers,31c8zi,Kofile,-1,Fri Apr 3 23:23:33 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have the TE from Miami if he's there in the 2nd. At the FSU pro day, O'Leary was injured with a lingering hammy injury that's been nagging him since the college playoff.  And even at the combine, O'Leary ran a 4.91. That simply isn't fast enough to be an effective weapon down the field consistently.   O'Leary may be a great blocker, sure, but I personally would rather have someone with better athetlicism and a better athelte overall in Walford."

steelers,317rk1,heavymedicine,3,Thu Apr 2 18:13:25 2015 UTC,Exactly the reason that I bought a Pouncey jersey last year. He just signed a new 6 year deal and is going to be with the Steelers for 9 straight years at that point? I think it will hold up over time.

I have a Troy Polamalu, Ben Roethlisberger, Jerome Bettis, Jack Lambert, Hines Ward, James Harrison, Mel Blount. I know those jerseys I can wear for life. The one time I didn't follow my standard is Lamarr Woodley and I wore it all of twice before he got released. I got an Antonio Brown in hopes of he will be around for a while but only because I got a smoking deal on the jersey."

steelers,318bp6,Steinerway,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"Well if you hate Peyton Manning that game must have been wonderful to watch! haha   As for the blowouts stuff, I think another factor is determining how much of it is one team playing really well or one team playing really poorly. While I don't want to take anything away from the Seahawks performance, that was a terribly played game by the Broncos from literally the first snap. Any other game I'd be like, hey cool they really beat the crap out of them, but the Super Bowl is supposed to be the two best teams playing. So if one team plays like crap, regardless of what the other team did, I feel it makes it a bad Super Bowl."

steelers,318bp6,MattEven,2,Fri Apr 3 13:11:06 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong it was a good Superbowl, but IMHO it didnt start to pick up till after the first half. The fake FG for the TD was grand but the ending really was the reason why I think it was in contention.  The Last Drive where a great great great catch was made and we all assumed that the Pats would fall to the Seahawks until the goal line INT.   HOWEVER I do not put it past Superbowl 13, not even in the slightest."

Harold seems like a decent choice as an OLB prospect for us. I would love to see who is there in the 2nd round because I am not convinced there is a big difference between Harold and someone like Nate Orchard who might be around in the 2nd with all the good edge rushers in this draft."
steelers,317ofw,fatguyinakilt,2,Thu Apr 2 18:15:22 2015 UTC,I agree. I think Orchard would be a great pick. (May be a little Bias) but I would like to take a Corner in the first and someone like Orchard in the second.
steelers,317ofw,A4thLineDuster7,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:48:43 2015 UTC,I like Harold and while Marcus Peters remains my favorite player in the draft not named Vic Beasley I wouldn't be opposed to going with Harold over him.

steelers,317ofw,Drakhaoul,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:10:09 2015 UTC,"Because while Harold is somewhat raw he has actually shown quite a few NFL caliber pass rushing skills and has flashed real potential to take on NFL lineman.  Dupree on the other hand is an athletic freak but that's all he has going for him right now. In most games teams didn't even bother to bring a TE over to help block him, instead opting to let OTs who will never play in the NFL take him on 1 on 1 and despite his huge advantage athletically he failed to dominate in most games. He also doesn't seem to have very good instincts and a lot of times he lost track of the play and seemed to guess where the ball was going which makes me very concerned if i'm asking him to play in space as an OLB.  Harold is a one year project who needs some refining and a little time in an NFL strength and conditioning program. Dupree has an NFL body but he needs to be built from the ground up as a pass rusher and, massive bust potential notwithstanding, I don't see him being a real contributor for several years in the NFL if he ends up in a 3-4."

steelers,316sdr,yenney92,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:01:59 2015 UTC,"I don't have a particular player, but the WR and RB positions are supposed to be two of the deepest positions in this years draft class.   In a late-round/UDFA RB I'd want a guy who's skillset can somewhat mirror Bell's. Even at this players best, if its 70-80% of what Bell's max production is it would still be worth the draft pick. You never have enough RB's - even if your starter is one of the top-3 RB's in the league.  In a WR - a guy with pure size. Even if he runs a little slower and isn't as polished in route-running, if he can jump and get body position for tough catches I would definitely pull the trigger."
steelers,316sdr,Kofile,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"P - Kyle Loomis - Could go undrafted because he's a punter. Would be useful for the Steelers because we've had a rotation of sub-par punters for years now.  FB - Tyler Varga - Could go undrafted because he's a fullback. Would be useful for the Steelers because they only have Will Johnson who has been so-so and will be unrestricted soon, and it wouldn't hurt to have some competition in camp. You could do a lot worse than a high character, extremely disciplined, ivy leaguer."

steelers,316sdr,dj0,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"I like him too. He plays hard, always shows good effort, seems like a stand up guy. But he's limited in terms of touching the ball, and overall he's a ""just a guy"" type player. I think Varga could be bring more to the table, and in particular is a guy I could see getting a few carries a game either from the FB position or even as a short yardage RB. If he's undrafted I think bringing him to camp can only help. Depending on who's available and who's been taken I'd also consider him in the 6th or 7th rounds."
steelers,316sdr,Intropy_,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:14:04 2015 UTC,Will Johnson is a beast in run blocking but as you said he isn't great when it comes to getting carries and catches our of the backfield.   On one hand I think it would be great to have a dynamic football player at fullback but on the other hand I think that we only need a run blocker because Le'Veon is the best RB in the league.   I suppose this guy Varga could be a steal at the right price.
steelers,314slm,JollyRogers40,9,Thu Apr 2 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"Walford has plus skills as a pass catcher when it comes to attacking the ball in the air and fighting for contested catches and he's a pretty dang solid blocker as well.  I don't know if he makes it to the Steelers in the 3rd, and I'm not sure if I'd go TE in the 2nd, but Walford is a rock solid option to replace Heath Miller moving forward."
steelers,314slm,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:58:54 2015 UTC,"Pass rushers in the second are basically Markus Golden (who I dislike) and Eli Harold IF he falls to us.

steelers,314slm,ColdNose,2,Thu Apr 2 06:59:41 2015 UTC,"Not a Penn State fan but i've tracked down some of James' games. He's basically a project in every sense of the word and unlike Spaeth he doesn't have good run blocking to fall back.  He has the size and potential to be a good blocker and pass catcher but right now he's basically a big guy who isn't much of a blocker (he doesn't really attack defenders when run blocking the way you want a guy with his size to) and who, despite making the occasional spectacular catch, struggles to get separation and catch contested passes. His route running isn't very smooth either and despite his size smaller defenders knocked him off his routes a lot when he went up against man coverages.  I don't have a problem with him as a 4th round or later project to groom but I wouldn't expect a whole lot of anything from James for at least his first couple years in the NFL."
steelers,314slm,majin_beck,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:19:24 2015 UTC,Not quite like Spaeth. James is pass catcher with questionable at best blocking skills while Spaeth is an excellent blocking tight end.

Just because the rules have changed does not take away the fact that the Steelers won those bowls....hits against players that would result in yard penalties now didn't exist back then. So you can say every team that won a Super Bowl back in the day are not legitimate cuz there's been so many rule changes nobody who played back when would be able to play the way they did..... Also because the refereeing was questionable on calls, CUZ WE ALL KNOW THATS STILL NOT AN ISSUE, even with technology, in my opinion, doesn't justify calling winning a Super Bowl winning team ""not legitimate"".

steelers,30v3q9,elias2718,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:20:06 2015 UTC,"The issue is longevity. He was among the best in the league at his peak, the problem is he didn't start until he was 29. You need peak, and longevity to get into the hall unless you're just clearly better than everyone else or where so memorable that the Hall would just feel incomplete without them (think Gale Sayers, Terrell Davis, Kurt Warner). As good as Harrison was, he doesn't fall into that category. He was among the best, never clearly the best."
steelers,30v3q9,maltrab,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:09:52 2015 UTC,Agree with all sentiments.  I'll also contest that Taylor would be at least in consideration if he had above average interception numbers.

steelers,30tso7,twdavis18,10,Mon Mar 30 17:30:36 2015 UTC,"I always have to scroll back to see the Randle-El to Ward touchdown.  I'm no great fan of Cowher, but what I do miss dearly about him is almost every single game there would be at least one gadget play, and damn did it seem they paid off an unusually high percentage of the time.  His first professional game as a coach was the fake punt from their own end of the field, I think against Houston.  I think it Warren ? back from Miami who had several good years with the Steelers.  It seems like they are rarely called by Tomlin, and when they are they don't produce."
steelers,30tso7,chaz_batch,3,Tue Mar 31 00:09:25 2015 UTC,Why no fan of Cowher? The guy inherited a losing team and was very successful early and often with no QB for most of his career.
steelers,30tso7,ReallyFool,5,Tue Mar 31 01:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know sometimes it was frustrating to watch when he went too conservative, but he was a great coach. What was the stat he had? Something like only 1 or 2 losses ever when having a lead of 10 or more at any point in a game? That's a sign of consistently amazing defenses, which is something I miss having.  EDIT: Quick google seach indicates it's actually ""108â1â1 in games in which they built a lead of at least 11 points."""
steelers,30tso7,mrsammercer,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:28:14 2015 UTC,"I said ""great fan"".  There are lots of people who think he was a messiah or something.  He was a good coach, nothing more.  His best asset was hiring really good coordinators and letting them do their thing.  His best decision by far was to let Dan Rooney override him and draft Ben.  By comparison I do consider Tomlin maybe a little above average.  Let's see how things go this year, his best decisions may have been to push out Arians/Lebeau and hire Haley/Butler(TBD)."
steelers,30tso7,chaz_batch,2,Tue Mar 31 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"Tomlin is not better than Cowher. Not even close. Tomlin has the benefit of a Franchise QB and has in my opinion underachieved with him. What Cowher accomplished, with the garbage QBs he had, was pretty amazing."
steelers,30tso7,ReallyFool,0,Tue Mar 31 23:18:19 2015 UTC,No where in my comment did I even come close to suggesting Tomlin was better than Cowher.  I said Cower was a good coach.  I said Tomlin was a little above-average coach. You've actually confirmed my previous comment about people thinking Cowher was a messiah or something.

But I feel ever since Big Snack left our run stop defense mentality took a back seat to EDGE rushers and ILBs with Coach T (not successfully yet) focusing on flash corners and safeties shutting down the pass and allowing teams to rush on us.   You got to remember that professional coaches live and die by Pittsburgh's public opinion and Coach T might be hesitant to say this is the direction he wants to take the team. Todd Haley once said in article that when he first arrived in Pittsburgh yinzers were already recognizing him on the street and yelling, ""Yinz need a halfback and get the running game goin again!""  It must suck for coaches to effectively execute their game plan and keep the local faithful happy."

steelers,30v7ku,akmalhot,3,Tue Mar 31 11:05:18 2015 UTC,I would be shocked if the steelers draft a QB this year b/c the team already has 3 QBs under contract for this season. But it wouldn't surprise me if they drafted one next year; next year it will be more about finding a backup/developmental than looking for a franchise QB. That is probably draft 2017 at the earliest.
steelers,30v7ku,steelergurl,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:27:38 2015 UTC,We have 5 years of Ben left baring something bad happening. We would have somebody benching it for a long time. Waste of a pick. Bruce is a serviceable backup. Late round picks for a third stringer. Find a real replacement in 3 or 4 years to give him a few years to learn from the big guy

steelers,30v7ku,Steinerway,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:46:52 2015 UTC,"No, it's not time to draft Ben's replacement for another two to three years at the earliest. I find it ironic that you don't like rookies starting since we're talking about Roethlisberger himself, and we all know how his career started. He showed rookies can win. Flacco and Ryan showed that Ben wasn't a one time thing. Luck, RG3 and Wilson have made it the norm. I want the QB starting by his second year at the latest, if not then the day 1 starter after Ben retires that preceding offseason."
steelers,30v7ku,steelbydesign,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why everyone wants to draft a guy now. Draft a guy this year (in a weak QB class btw) to sit the bench for 4 years?  I say draft Ben's replacement 1 year ahead of time. Obviously you don't know exactly when he's going to go, but I'd error on the side of draft the guy later (like maybe literally when Ben retires).  Can anyone really give solid examples of a guy draft early to develop over several years that was a success? Aaron Rodgers sat but only because Favre hung on way longer than expected... And Tom Brady was a miracle, NE never drafted him with intention that he'd be their franchise QB."
steelers,30v7ku,_koopatroopa_,0,Wed Apr 1 12:00:12 2015 UTC,"I think its time. I am in the minority with my opinion that I don't think that Ben has that much time. I think the 2016-2017 season will be his last full and strong season with injuries. I know he got lucky last year being relatively injury free, but he is living on a prayer IMO."
steelers,30v7ku,snookyface90210,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"I think his transition these last couple years to a legitimate pocket passer will extend his career a decent bit. That along with being kept upright with Haley at the helm and a stronger offensive line. I'd agree with you if he was still playing backyard ball and/or Bruce ""quarterback killa"" Arians was still running the offense."
steelers,30v7ku,Steinerway,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:49:23 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is that it wasn't ""luck,"" it was Haley being the opposite of Arians (in other words: competent) and the OL being among the best in the league. That's not luck, that's understanding how to protect your QB and having the ability to do it. And with Haley signed for at least two more seasons (the norm for assistants, should receive another extension when the time comes), two of the top four best offensive linemen (three of those four aged 25 or younger, the fourth aged 27) signed through 2019 and those remaining two expecting their own long-term extensions very soon...then Ben should remain injury free for a long time. It wasn't luck or a prayer, it was skill and intelligence."
steelers,30v7ku,Backstop,0,Wed Apr 1 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"I am with you. Based on average QBs, yeah, he should have 5 years left, but with his playing style he takes more of a pounding than your average QB. Also I am a big fan of letting a new QB sit and learn for a season or two before putting him straight in the game. I know it works for some guys, but it's better to have a smooth transition (or a prepared backup in case of Ben getting his leg rolled up or something)."
steelers,30v7ku,Steinerway,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:48:08 2015 UTC,"Ben lead the Steelers to a 14-2 season his rookie year. Im not doubting experience is a plus, but think about how dramatically different Ben's career could have been had Tommy Maddux played all of the 2004 season. He was also the youngest QB to ever win a superbowl at the time (although I think Russell Wilson may have passed him last year). Because of the injury, Ben was able to get into the game as a rookie and get full steed NFL experience. I think it only benefitted him."
steelers,30v7ku,twdavis18,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"Russell Wilson was older, Ben is still the youngest. And let alone that, as you alluded to Roethlisberger himself was one of the ones who began the ""Young QB revolution"" that has become the norm. From Ben to Flacco and Ryan in 2008 to Newton and Dalton in 2011 to Luck, RG3 and Wilson in 2012 to Derek Carr and not the day 1 starter, but Blake Bortles eventually took over by Week 4 of this past season. Rookie QBs starting their rookie year is now the thing to do. I skipped a few years, too. Bradford, Geno Smith, quarterbacks start as rookies now.  And especially on this offense, where only two starters are over 30 and Ben is one of them. Brown, Bell, Bryant, Pouncey, DeCastro, Gilbert, Beachum will all be here for a LONG time and help a rookie QB ease into the NFL."

Believe it or not, people were sharpening their pitchforks and calling Cam a bust after his second year because he wasn't recording 12 sacks a game! That idea seems ludicrous now..  Defensive players usually take time to develop.. Unless all the pieces around them are already perfect in their role. Which is incredibly far from the case now."
steelers,30sqtz,Verksus67,8,Mon Mar 30 12:48:31 2015 UTC,"The exact same thing happened with Timmons, he took a bit of time to get into the rotation and start making an impact, and now he's the best defensive player that we have. I'm with you, I've still got plenty of faith in Jarvis."

steelers,30v00p,B_Witt,4,Mon Mar 30 23:23:48 2015 UTC,That's just selective memory. If you actually compare our results against above 500 teams to below you'll notice we beat the bad teams more often than not.
steelers,30v00p,dj0,7,Tue Mar 31 01:59:34 2015 UTC,"While I agree it's not that bad, we still lose to teams like Tampa and New York more often than we should. It's fun to joke about ""Next season: 15-1 with the loss to Oakland!"" but when being honest, it's not that bad at all. This was the first season that a Tomlin-coached team ever lost to a team that finished with less than 4 wins. Bad but not the absolute bottom-feeders.  Which brings me to the other part of the selective memory: It's not just something that happens ""under Tomlin."" It was a problem with Cowher as well. In all 15 years he coached in Pittsburgh, he lost to at least one team with a losing record in all but one season. He gave the 1998 3-13 Bengals two of those wins. Tomlin in 8 years already has three such seasons in which he did not lose to a single team with a losing record. I don't mean to say Cowher sucks, but there are way too many people who say ""Tomlin always loses to bad teams! He sucks! Fire him! Cowher never did that!"" when the truth is the polar opposite."
steelers,30v00p,Steinerway,6,Tue Mar 31 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"Pick a random NFL team, google their schedule, compare losses to wins.  KC Chiefs last year for example: (first team I googled):  Wins: Seahaks, Patriots  Losses: Raiders, Titans  Every team loses 'easy' games and wins tough games. That s isn't a Steelers exclusive problem."

steelers,30tysy,SteelerBoss,9,Mon Mar 30 18:17:00 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly a little nervous about Shamarko.  In a season where Troy looked as pedestrian as he ever has, Shamarko saw 3 defensive snaps all season.  He made some nice plays on special teams, but has been banged up and missed stretches of games 3 times now in his two year career.  The staff wants him to be Troy's replacement, but I'm just not completely sold on the guy.  Downvote away!"
steelers,30tysy,702Cichlid,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:55:57 2015 UTC,"I just would like to point out the reason why we didn't see him on the field when Troy was banged up, it was simply because at first Shamarko was banged up as well & Allen played so well that it had to be his spot."
steelers,30tysy,Huskyd,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:56:55 2015 UTC,"Just to present another way to look at things, we picked up Will Allen off waivers in 2013 from the Cowboys (after we let him go because we drafted Shamarko) because Shamarko was banged up and underperforming, if the staff though Shamarko was the answer why do you need to bring in a Will Allen?  Now nothing against Will Allen at all; I agree he had a pretty nice season for us.  I also know LeBeau had a hard on for veterans and Ohio State guys.  But if you're legitimately wanting to Shamarko to be your safety in the future you have to find him more than 3 snaps over 11 games on defense--especially when he's getting a hat for playing special teams.  I hope I'm wrong about Shamarko, he reminds so much of Bob Sanders from Indianapolis it's eerie.  Same size, same freakish athleticism and bad attitude when supporting the run.  However, I worry a lot about his durability much like it was an issue for Bob Sanders.  On the plus side he's now had the same number of season of 10+ games played as Sanders.  On the negative side his injuries have always come at terrible times for both him and the club."
steelers,30tysy,702Cichlid,10,Thu Apr 2 03:27:17 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people want us to draft a safety in the early rounds when Thomas is going I to his third year. I think it's been pretty apparent that he was troys heir apparent.

What's worse, IS I'VE EVEN SAID IT! (Bob Labriola describes Thomas as such).   The reason I'm gonna go nuts... How can someone be the ""heir apparent"" to anyone if they have not got significant playing time in that role? Troy was great but has declined. Even so, Thomas has not stepped into that role to the point where he would even supplant an old troy.  The reason that it's NOT ""apparent"" that he is the ""heir apparent"" is because Thomas has ""apparently"" not shown anything to indicate that he should be EVEN SHARING time with Troy as he currently plays.   I personally have high hopes for him, but the question still needs to be asked, ""What's wrong with him?"""
steelers,30tysy,SeriouslySlick,2,Tue Mar 31 08:08:42 2015 UTC,What's wrong with him? Polamalu still playing is what's wrong with him.
steelers,30tysy,DriArcher,2,Tue Mar 31 08:12:02 2015 UTC,"We both know that's not how football works.   So are you saying that Harrison should be taking every snap? Of course not. His age and declining production, as is with Troy, indicates that a younger player should spare him snaps and work his way into the role.  The difference: this is happening with Harrison, and almost every other position where this occurs (Another example: Tuitt) but NOT with Thomas.   As I've said before, I have high hopes and have seen flashes from Thomas, but there has to be concern there. Is he too stupid to lead the defense? So bad at calling that he consistently gets exposed? Is he even more prone to injury than we know now?"
steelers,30tysy,SeriouslySlick,4,Tue Mar 31 08:18:44 2015 UTC,No I just think the steelers are too loyal to Troy to bench him for what's basically a rookie.
steelers,30tysy,DriArcher,1 point,Tue Mar 31 08:27:28 2015 UTC,"You act like there are only two options: Bench Troy, or have him take 100% of the snaps.   They could use Thomas to spell Troy and work him into the role. In reality, most of the time, Thomas wasn't even number 2 on the depth chart. That's obviously cause for concern."
steelers,30tysy,SeriouslySlick,1 point,Tue Mar 31 08:38:07 2015 UTC,We're talking about Tomlin and company here. Cam Thomas could've and should've been benched week 1 for Tuitt but he wasn't. No way would they insult Troy like that. (Even though they should've.)
steelers,30tysy,DriArcher,2,Tue Mar 31 14:37:47 2015 UTC,"I was really excited for him coming out of college. I've since cooled on him, but only because I am assuming his playing time has been so low because of something the coaches saw. That is hardly fool proof though, and I still think he's going to do well when given the opportunity, but I don't have quite as high of expectations for him as I did at first."
steelers,30tysy,twobee2,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"I think he'll do well. He seemed great at tackling and decent in coverage in what little action he has been in.   There were a couple plays I remember him getting out jumped by a taller player in his rookie year, so his height is the only weakness I can see right now."
steelers,30tysy,BioSin,0,Mon Mar 30 18:48:46 2015 UTC,He got completely destroyed by Gronk.  It wasn't even fair.

steelers,30tysy,Robert_L0blaw,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"He's a question mark. Lot of hype, but very little substance. That's not to say he isn't good, but he just hasn't seen the field much. That, in and of itself, is worrisome, as there were situations where he could have played more, but it was up to the coaches.  The truth is we don't know what we have in him. This is his year to show what he's capable of. Personally, I have high expectations. The team invested a 3rd and 4th round pick in him. It would suck to have him become just a rotational guy."
steelers,30tysy,MrGoosemahn,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"He has a lot of athletic ability, that's for damn sure. I wish he had a couple more inches in size, but I think he's well built all together.  Thomas suffers the same way many others do on the defense: there's a whole lot of hype and potential, but little-to-nothing in actual production."
steelers,30tysy,Kofile,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:09:32 2015 UTC,Thomas has battled a couple of hamstring strains which has kept him off the field.  Jarvis Jones is the first inexperienced player to hit the field in a large capacity since kendrell bell.  (I could be mistaken but I'm pretty certain). Veterans under lebeau almost always get the nod because of their understanding of the game and the system.  Shark will get his shot this season and I think a lot of the heir apparent talk comes from the fact that we traded  a third for Cleveland's fourth to draft the guy.  Clearly the steelers believe in the kid and he is a high character player.  Beyond that he's a thumper similar to Bob Sanders.  Bottom line he's going to get a shot and I will be very surprised if the steelers draft a safety.
steelers,30tysy,Rorbotron,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:12:43 2015 UTC,"All of our opinions on the matter are pretty irrelevant.

But it's good to see that our FO is still capable of making insanely good decisions, like signing brown to what can now be considered a dirt cheap deal for one of the top 3 non-QB's in football.  That decision alone made up for the entire 2008 draft IMO."

steelers,30lc9u,Verksus67,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:16:35 2015 UTC,We won't draft a corner in the first. It will not happen.
steelers,30lc9u,The_YoungWolf,2,Sat Mar 28 14:19:55 2015 UTC,Probably a Linebacker right? Seeing as though that's what our defense is based upon.
steelers,30lc9u,Flexidry_,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:26:24 2015 UTC,Most likely
steelers,30lc9u,The_YoungWolf,2,Sat Mar 28 14:30:18 2015 UTC,Why don't people understand this?? We play zone and blitz...and I'm assuming Keith Butler will continue that trend. The Steelers aren't going to pay first round money for a corner who will need at least a year to learn our system.
steelers,30lc9u,BardsApprentice,5,Sat Mar 28 15:08:04 2015 UTC,"The whole ""it takes a year to learn the Steelers defense"" is a load of crap. The Steelers defense isn't any more incomprehensible than any other defensive scheme, LeBeau just hated playing rookies. Brice McCain and Antwon Blake both came in and played well fairly quickly and they're less talented than the top 5 or 6 CBs in the draft.  The Steelers were also going to draft Justin Gilbert had the Browns not taken him and Peters, Johnson, and Collins are all more NFL ready than Gilbert was."
steelers,30lc9u,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"Many former Lebeau rookies and players who were new to his schemes have admitted to needing at least a season to acclimate. Some include Troy Polamalu, Timmons, Clark Haggans & Joey Porter, Kendrell Bell, Ricardo Colclough, Ziggy Hood, and more. And insofar as Justin Gilbert, there was no evidence we would have taken him...all speculation and wishful thinking. The verdict is still out on he and Shazier, but I like the Shazier pick much more in hindsight."
steelers,30lc9u,BardsApprentice,3,Sat Mar 28 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"needing to acclimate =/= being incapable of playing  Dick LeBeau has always hated playing rookies to the point that he'll defer to crappy veterans for as long as possible if it means keeping a rookie on the bench (see Cam Thomas and Stephon Tuitt this past season). No they might not be elite players day one but there's absolutely no reason they can't come in and contribute early on when rookies step in and play for every other team in the NFL. There's a learning curve for every rookie and every rookie is going to need to acclimate but they can do that while playing and if the Steelers defense is so much more complex that it's incomprehensible (which I seriously doubt considering journeyman like Brice McCain and Antwon Blake picked it up just fine) then it needs to be reworked (given how bad it was it stands to reason that it should be reworked anyways).  The whole ""oh rookies aren't capable of playing in my defense"" line is an excuse to justify LeBeau's refusal to play them because of his weird fetish for always starting veterans. If 31 other teams (many with better defenses than the Steelers) can bring in rookies and have them play from the get go there's absolutely no reason the Steelers can't do the same."
steelers,30lc9u,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Sat Mar 28 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"I've preached it for a while before Coach Dad was finally let go.. But in the modern NFL players need to come in ready to DO something and secondary cannot be sacrificed. In the modern era, a scheme that takes 1-2 years to actually be able to do somewhat properly? Is an overly complex shit scheme and wastes two good years of our rookie contracts. Some people need time to learn, but some learn better through application!  ESPECIALLY in garbage time.   That being said, the fact that Dick is now st Tennessee where he's basically forced to use all ""rookies"" (as in best player available and not some vet he's biased towards) his scheme might have a chance to be dominate again."
steelers,30lc9u,Verksus67,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:02:21 2015 UTC,"There is no information stating that we would have picked Gilbert. If anything, we wanted Kyle Fuller, who was taken one pick before us."
steelers,30lc9u,KanyeWest_GayFish,3,Sat Mar 28 17:15:43 2015 UTC,There were a lot of reports coming out about the Steelers liking Gilbert (and Fuller) before the draft.  Either way though the fact that two of the Steelers seemingly favorite prospects in last year's draft were corners indicates that the team isn't going to pass on a corner they like simply because he's a corner.

steelers,30lc9u,B_Witt,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:30:54 2015 UTC,"Johnson, meanwhile, might be better playing off coverage and the Steelers like to use their cornerback in press coverage.   So, yeah, that's just flat-out wrong."

steelers,30icfl,cyhh,4,Fri Mar 27 17:11:56 2015 UTC,Well said.
steelers,30icfl,KanyeWest_GayFish,2,Fri Mar 27 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"He'll be in the first stage of the NFL drug treatment program since he tested positive at the Combine.  Given that his next infraction is the year long suspension, I actually expect him to fall out of the first round."
steelers,30icfl,yeshua1986,3,Fri Mar 27 23:59:09 2015 UTC,Such a huge risk/reward.  I don't think the Steelers brass will pull the trigger.
steelers,30icfl,cyhh,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:14:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, although I hope they would if he free-falls to them in the 2nd. I really think that teams will back off and Justin Houston him."
steelers,30icfl,yeshua1986,3,Sat Mar 28 00:19:28 2015 UTC,"The year long suspension doesn't kick in until he fails a test while in stage 3 under the old rules.  I believe with the new rules the first failed test in stage 3 is a 10 game suspension.  If he enters in stage 1, he would need to fail at least 2, and possibly 3, more tests before getting a year long suspension.  1 failed test while in stage 1 is a 4-6 game suspension under the old rules.  Not sure if they changed that for the new ones.  That is still a bit of a risk though."
steelers,30icfl,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:43:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'll still be surprised if he falls out of the top 10, stunned if he goes past 15, and absolutely shocked if he falls out of the top 20."

If I remember correctly, he had had other issues, such as the five game suspension for the tattoo parlor thing, and selling NCAA-related stuff."
steelers,30icfl,MrGoosemahn,4,Fri Mar 27 17:12:22 2015 UTC,"If the guy seems like he understands his mistakes (Mike Adams, Honey Badger) then i'm not worried about the weed thing because as long as the guy isn't a major risk of getting suspended for it I don't have a problem with past mistakes.  Gregory had multiple failed tests in college though and the failed Combine test is just the coup de gras for me when it comes to whether his potential is worth the risk (both on and off the field)."
steelers,30icfl,PomfAndCircvmstance,3,Fri Mar 27 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"To me the pot isn't that big an issue if, like you mention, the guy owns up to his mistakes and actively looks to change.  With Gregory the question is his functional strength and overall lack of football skills. He's a monster athlete, but that won't get you far in the NFL. I think he's a two to three year project at OLB and we don't have the luxury of having a quality starter to groom him behind."
steelers,30icfl,MrGoosemahn,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:36:55 2015 UTC,The guy is a monster.  He's not falling out of the first round.  If he does I will be stunned and if he falls to 22 I hope we draft him.  He's a blue chip talent through and through.
steelers,30icfl,Rorbotron,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:05:03 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping this is just a due diligence type of thing because if the team is seriously entertaining the idea of taking him at #22 i'm going to cry.

steelers,30icfl,steelbydesign,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:02:26 2015 UTC,He's top 6 talent wise in this draft.  He's not really a pass up kind of player if he interviews with us well.  I will be shocked if he falls out of the top 15 with the failed test because he is that good.
steelers,30icfl,Rorbotron,-4,Sun Mar 29 17:07:27 2015 UTC,Gregory has bust written all over him even without the weed issues.
steelers,30ieji,steelbydesign,4,Fri Mar 27 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"I really like Harold as a 34 OLB prospect for a lot of reasons.  For starters the guy is a terrific athlete and with the exception of Vic Beasley I don't think there's a more fluid LBer in the draft when it comes to sinking his hips and getting low around the edge. He also has terrific burst both off the snap and when closing to make a sack or tackle a runner. His fluidity and lateral quickness also hint at really good coverage potential down the line.  He's also probably one of the most well rounded pass rushers in the draft despite being a little raw. He uses his hands well to keep blockers from getting a hold of him, squeezes through holes in the line, and has flashed big time potential both coming off the edge and cutting it inside. His hand technique isn't great and he need to refine his pass rushing moves but considering his age (he'll be a 21 year old rookie) and the fact that he's still a bit raw he's way ahead of the curve for most guys in Harold's position.  I will say that he doesn't have great strength when it comes to straight up engaging blockers (Dupree and Fowler are probably the only edge guys in the draft who do) and he's not a guy who is going to hold the edge against the run his first season (again Dupree and Fowler are probably the only guys who will be able to) but he's young and has the frame to put on muscle and become stronger and better against the run.  The guy is a little raw and he'll need some time to develop before he's ready to be an every down player but he has terrific athleticism and he has shown more skill as a pass rusher than all but maybe two or three players in the draft. He's a good candidate to have a ""disappointing"" rookie season and then, after a year of strength and conditioning and developing his skills, explode onto the scene in his second season.  Eli Harold has the talent and potential to be the next Joey Porter and i'd take him over edge rusher in this draft not named Beasley or Fowler."
steelers,30ieji,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'd probably take him over Beasley too. Vic gets washed out too often (just look at the FSU game) and while he's a terrific athlete I don't see the functional strength and awareness to hold the edge from him. I watched Harold's full game Louisville tape on youtube and he totally blew up their LT a few times. It's an impressive bull rush. He has some technique issues (he gets out of step at times and ends up engaging with his inside foot) but those can be fixed. Louisville's TE did handle him a couple of times though which is at least a little bit concerning. He also needs to work on his tackling technique as he does miss some tackles he probably should make. With that said, I would not be upset if the Steelers took him at 1.22, especially if Waynes and Collins are off the board.  FWIW I went back and looked at some Jarvis Jones college game tape and other than Fowler none of these guys look as impressive as Jarvis did on tape. Even so, Harold looks to have the raw tools to be a successful ROLB and if he can develop another reliable pass rushing move I think he can be a good NFL player, especially with that bull rush of his."
steelers,30ieji,k__e__n,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"I really like Eli Harold.  I think Fowler is an elite talent, and Owa just seems like he could dominate, and Beasley really could be a beast.  But after that I think it's a toss up.  And someone like Eli Harold could easily become a better pro than Bud Dupree, Gregory, and even Ray.   I don't know quite why, but after watching tape he seems like a slightly bigger, slighly more dominant, OLB version of Ryan Shazier.  Who, by the way, I think is going to be a pro-bowler and possibly elite.  I would be happy taking a chance on Eli at 1.22. I think he could even push Jarvis by the end of next year.  I think this team is in bigger need of CB than OLB this year, so I'm not sure what they're going to do. But I will be excited to watch Eli Harold over the next few years, Steeler or not."
steelers,30ieji,tolas,-7,Sat Mar 28 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"He sucks ass and would be an AWFUL first round pick.  Too slow, not very diverse in his pass rush moves. No thanks."
steelers,30ieji,SleestakLightning,4,Fri Mar 27 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Harold, but too slow? I feel like he's all athlete without much substance."
steelers,30ieji,SleestakLightning,-1,Fri Mar 27 18:03:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry, brain fart.  By ""slow"" I meant he lacks explosion. He's a faster Jarvis Jones. He has a quick first step but he can't shed blocks and doesn't have the explosiveness or upper body strength to avoid blocks or disengage once a lineman locks on.  He's not very good against the run and he tends to get too far upfield too quick.   He's not even the best linebacker prospect on his team as Max Valles is far and away the better football player.   Eli Harold would be a decent pick in the mid-rounds. But it is completely laughable to even suggest picking him in Round One (I'm looking at you, dude who ran the Steelers mock draft on the NFL subreddit.)"
steelers,30ieji,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Fri Mar 27 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"He has a quick first step but he can't shed blocks and doesn't have the explosiveness or upper body strength to avoid blocks or disengage once a lineman locks on.   Aside from Fowler, Beasley, and occasionally Dupree (when he isn't getting single blocked by TEs) there isn't an edge rusher in the draft who was able to consistently disengage from O-lineman last season. It's a skill that takes time to develop and aside from guys with freakish athleticism/strength like Dupree or polished talents like Fowler/Beasley very few guys are amazing at shedding blocks. Harold has flashed potential to get low and get around guys once they get their hands on him and with a little work those pressures and hurries can easily turn into sacks.  I don't know where you get that he lacks explosiveness though. Look at his sacks against Louisville this year or his game against Maryland last season. You can see him flash a second gear when pursuing the QB. Harold has made similar plays running guys down from behind in other games as well. The explosiveness is clearly there and when he gets stronger and better at working his way past blockers it'll become more apparent.   He's not very good against the run and he tends to get too far upfield too quick.   Playing the run is not something most young edge rushers are going to be capable of. Most of these guys just aren't strong or experienced enough to hold up when a guy outweighing them by 50+ lbs is coming at them. Vic Beasley is easily the most talented edge rusher in this draft and he gets washed away a lot when teams run at him. Von Miller wasn't good against the run either coming into the NFL. If a guy is good against the run already great but if he's not you shouldn't be surprised.   He's not even the best linebacker prospect on his team as Max Valles is far and away the better football player. Eli Harold would be a decent pick in the mid-rounds.   Valles is strictly an athlete at this point and the majority of his sacks were Jason Worilds sacks where he beat a TE or a RB or came in unblocked. He's stronger than Harold right now but his instincts, lateral quickness, and hands are all significantly worse than Harold's. Saying that Harold is a mid rounder is simply insanity.  It seems the majority of your issues with Harold as a prospect are issues that most other young edge rushers are going to have. Most edge rushers are bad against the run early and struggle to disengage from blockers, that's far from an issue unique to Harold. Eli Harold is raw and won't be an elite every down player day one. However his athleticism and the skills he has flashed in college will allow him to contribute as a rotational guy early on. Most of the edge rushers in this draft not named Beasley or Fowler will need to be used similarly because most of those guys have similar issues with needing to get stronger and develop more. Harold is a bit of a project but that doesn't mean he ""sucks ass"". He has a lot of good traits and skills that with NFL caliber coaching and development could make him a great player. You aren't going to land a pass rusher who is great at disengaging from blocks, strong against the run, and possessing a vast and polished repertoire of pass rushing moves outside of the top 5."
steelers,30ieji,SleestakLightning,-4,Fri Mar 27 18:47:25 2015 UTC,Everything you said there are things I already know. You seem to like reading your own words.  Eli Harold is a terrible pick at #22. Period.
steelers,30ieji,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:56:06 2015 UTC,"Everything you said there are things I already know. You seem to like reading your own words.   You claim Harold ""sucks ass"" and struggles to disengage from blockers while being bad against the run. I respond to your comment by explaining why your issues with Harold are both common issues that most other edge players have as well as explaining how Harold has flashed skills and potential that will allow him to overcome those issues. Rather than explaining why you feel he won't improve in those areas or why he is worse than those other guys with similar issues you respond by being passive aggressive and stating that, ""Eli Harold is a terrible pick at #22. Period.""  Good discussion, i'll make a note not to waste your time in the future."
steelers,30ieji,SleestakLightning,0,Fri Mar 27 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"But seriously...  Harold doesn't know how to use his hands, he can't limit his surface area or sink his hips. He's basically a faster Jarvis Jones. If they couldn't develop Jarvis, what makes you think they can develop Harold?  This team cannot afford to miss with it's 1st round pick this year. They absolutely need an impact player. Harold is not that. Harold likely won't ever be that. He's a bad athlete at a position where bad athletes bust more often than not.  When they get to 22 Harold will still be there. It would be a huge mistake to pass on the superior players at other positions just to take an inferior athlete because of the position he plays."

steelers,30ieji,SleestakLightning,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:36:07 2015 UTC,Jarvis' problems aren't mental. They aren't learning the game. It's physical. He's not big/strong/fast enough to consistently beat NFL left tackles.

steelers,30ieji,Sex_E_Searcher,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:04:10 2015 UTC,Is this a serious comment?  Look at any team that drafts well and they never reach for a player based on need.  Going 100% best player available isn't smart (because a RB would probably be the truly best player this year)... What if there's a run on CB's early? Are you gonna spend a first rounder on Quentin Rollins?
steelers,30ieji,akmalhot,0,Fri Mar 27 18:35:51 2015 UTC,"I'd rather take a position that we could actually profit from. Yeah, running backs are probably the deepest position in this years draft. Does that mean when the time comes in the first round and the best player on the board is running back that we draft him even though we have a top 5 RB and some depth at the position? No. He would find himself with no playing time and essentially a useless pick. Bell is still young. Now if we had an aging player that was likely going to retire soon then drafting that position makes sense, for example Aaron Rodgers. Hypothetically, if year after year the deepest and best position in the draft is LB. Then do we keep drafting LB's in the first round because they are the best players available? No, we would have a stacked LB core but every other position would probably be trash.    We need cornerbacks. Ike is most likely gone and was probably hurting the secondary more than helping it, Brice McCain is gone, and we haven't resigned Antwon Blake yet. With no additions to the position in free agency our CB's look like 1. William Gay, 2. Cortez Allen, 3. B.W. Webb. That's it. If we sign back Blake. Great. But we would have no depth. Do you expect 4 cornerbacks, who would probably be out there all game in this pass happy league, to be able to last. None of these guys have been able to prove that they are an above average CB and our pass defense would probably become worse as a result."

Also I think we were really trying to bolster our D-line in 2011 - so would you even say safety was a huge need (like was the need at S>DE, but we took Heyward because he was best available?)

This was just after the 2010 season when a 2nd year Ziggy played well and gave some false hope, and Keisel was a young 32 years old. Not exactly ancient by DL measures, especially since it was just his 5th year as a starter.  So, again, the point stands. CB was a signifcantly bigger need than DE, yet we go BPA and look how it turned out for us. Look how it regularly works out for the Ravens, too. And the Patriots. And the Seahawks. But look at how reaching for need works out for the Jets, Bills, Lions (last season aside), Redskins, etc. Notice a pattern here?"

Rainey had a few issues at Florida, and we took him.  Weslye Saunders got kicked off his college team for multiple issues, and we still picked him up as an undrafted free agent.  Santonio Holmes admitted that he sold drugs as a kid, and was arrested twice in the offseason leading up to his rookie year, and we took him in the first.  He was also arrested for marijuana possession in 2008.  We traded him after the 2009 season, when he was entering the final year of his deal, we weren't going to re-sign him, and he was suspended for 4 games.  The FO hasn't shown any indication that they have an issue with Bell's arrest.    If a guy has the talent, I don't think the team really cares, as long as they feel like he can stay out of trouble going forward.  It may make the guy slide down our board a bit, but I haven't seen anything that shows the front office as shying away from guys who have off field issues.

Holmes never failed a combine drug test.  Saunders was investigated by the NCAA for alleged contact with an agent and then kicked off the team for undisclosed reasons, none of which seem to have been drug related.  Chris Rainey was arrested for stalking and threatening an ex-girlfriend.

Is his combine failure suddenly not drug related, or is telling the team you have turned yourself around an extenuating circumstance?  I don't think the team is dumb enough to draft a player because he asks them to.  We drafted Adams because the FO thought he would be a good player.  They ignored the failed weed test, or thought the risk was worth it at that point.  If the FO thinks Gregory is worth the risk at 22, they will definitely pull the trigger on him if he is the top player.  If Gregory was number 1 on the board entering the draft, and was available at 22, the team would undoubtedly draft him.  None of us know how they had him rated before all this though.  Maybe they are afraid of his size, and rated him lower than most.  Maybe they are in love with his athleticism, and have him near the top.

That is the reason we draft, or sign anyone.    Also what is to stop Gregory from doing the same thing as Adams?  I'm not sure if I like Gregory because of other issues, mainly his size, but the team isn't going to pass on a guy, if they really like him, because he failed a test for weed.  If Gregory is the top prospect on our board when we pick, Gregory will be a Steeler.  I don't think he will be around when we pick anyway, but I don't see how you can sit here, and say we won't take a guy who failed a combine drug test, when we did it 3 years ago.  There is a very recent example of what you are saying will never happen.  Your only excuse is that he told the team he had changed.  Guess what every player with character concerns tells every team they interview with?  According to them, they have all changed.  Telling a team what they want to hear, and saying you would love to play for them is not an extenuating circumstance like you claim.  It is what every single prospect with character issues does.  It is exactly what Randy Gregory will tell every team he visits with this year."
steelers,30g11y,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:50:56 2015 UTC,Right. And they still won't draft him.

steelers,30g11y,SleestakLightning,3,Fri Mar 27 15:01:01 2015 UTC,They're actually bringing him in for a visit.
steelers,30g11y,MrGoosemahn,-1,Fri Mar 27 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, doing their due diligence. As they should. But they're not going to be stupid enough to draft him."
steelers,30g11y,SleestakLightning,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"You're the most ignorant individual. He is a talent, and while he may have some issues...dont we all? Its not that big of deal, its the draft, and no one has a clue what the Steelers draft board looks like currently. Regardless of issues the Steelers consistently draft best player available, and if Gregory or even Marcus Peters are available then I would not be surprised at all to see us draft either of them."
steelers,30g11y,JohnnyAcqua,0,Fri Mar 27 18:08:01 2015 UTC,"But Gregory won't even be BPA when they pick at 22.   I have no problem with ""off-field issues"" I've advocated for drafting Marcus Peters. But Gregory combines mind boggling stupidity, marijuana addiction, and overhype into one great big package that has the word ""BUST"" written real big on it."
steelers,30g11y,SleestakLightning,-1,Fri Mar 27 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"First off, 100% marijuana is not addictive. He made a mistake and smoked some weed to probably relax himself from the stress of preparing yourself for the most important job interview of his life. Second, you have never met or talked to him so how can you say he has ""mind boggling stupidity"". Lastly, if you have ever watched any tape of his you would understand why he is a top-5 prospect. He is quick off the line, a hard hitter, and has uncanny potential to be a player with similar talents to Justin Houston. If you are going to talk so much about a person you should have some evidence to back it up."
steelers,30g11y,JohnnyAcqua,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"1.) Anyone smoking as much weed as he admittedly was, is addicted to it. Maybe it's not addictive, chemically. But something is making him smoke so much.  2.) You're going for the biggest job interview of your life and you fail a drug test. That's stupidity.  3.) He has ridiculously high bust potential. He's more Manny Lawson than Justin Houston when you look at his combine numbers. He may end up being good, but his numbers indicate he has a much higher bust potential than guys who will be drafted after him."
steelers,30g11y,SleestakLightning,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:31:00 2015 UTC,"You know nothing about the draft process or marijuana. The drug is not addictive and plenty of people that are doing well and are intelligent have used the drug. He made a mistake, like most kids do and you are letting one mess up ruin his life. You truly are a shitty person if you are judging a person for something so miniscule. The combine numbers mean nothing unless you are the Oakland Raiders, nobody on the Steelers cares how you do in the combine. They actually applauded and jumped for joy when Jarvis Jones did poorly at the combine so they could select him (who also at one point was a top-5 caliber prospect). Go read and actually learn something before you open your mouth about subjects that you are know nothing about."

steelers,30dsl4,iCryKarma,40,Thu Mar 26 21:57:00 2015 UTC,"Team player, and a good special teams guy.  Whats not to like?"
steelers,30dsl4,DMBFAN22,9,Thu Mar 26 15:54:19 2015 UTC,He's not a good pass catcher but he's one of the best special teamers in NFL and he's a good blocker when he is on the field. The Steelers don't use their 4th/5th receivers for much anyways so they might as well get somebody who will make an impact elsewhere.
steelers,30dsl4,PomfAndCircvmstance,4,Thu Mar 26 16:05:38 2015 UTC,He is a great run blocking WR who provides good veteran depth.
steelers,30dsl4,heavymedicine,6,Thu Mar 26 16:17:12 2015 UTC,They didn't sign him to catch. Great special teams player. Which is an area thats historically comes to bite the Steelers in the ass at the worst times. This is an insurance policy.

steelers,30dsl4,Sex_E_Searcher,7,Thu Mar 26 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"I love this move. This guy wants to be here, he has alot of football left in him and plus lets not forget he was a first round draft pick for a reason, he has incredible speed when he's fit. I think this is going to work out great for us.  Why are all steelers fans so unexcited by him?"
steelers,30dsl4,Tbenzo,19,Thu Mar 26 16:01:15 2015 UTC,Why are all steelers fans so unexcited by him?   Because he's strictly a special teams guy who can't really catch. That's not a problem because the Steelers don't need him to catch but most people don't get hyped about special teamers who aren't elite return men.
steelers,30dsl4,PomfAndCircvmstance,8,Thu Mar 26 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"There does need to be a 4th WR though. I like DHB as the 5th/ST, but I would be more comfortable with another guy as the 4th.  And don't give me the ""Dri Archer is a WR bullshit."" If we're going to go that route, Archer is one injury away - at either RB or WR - to getting significant snaps.  That's something I don't want at all."
steelers,30dsl4,Kofile,4,Thu Mar 26 16:28:17 2015 UTC,Archer will probably play a hybrid WR/RB role next season and the team will probably spend a late round pick on a receiver since they always do. It isn't terribly difficult to find 4th/5th receivers in the NFL.
steelers,30dsl4,PomfAndCircvmstance,7,Thu Mar 26 16:42:28 2015 UTC,"I hated the Archer pick and I still do - especially at where he was drafted at.  I hope he gets extensive work in the Pre-Season, because that's the Most work he should get all season (not counting injuries).   I would rather have an actual receiver - not a gimmick - at the 4th WR. Having archer as the 3rd/4th RB i'm fine with - granted that there's another RB on the roster besides Williams and Bell.  Anyone can cite Archer's limited opportunities last season in his defense - and have a good one at that. But in those opportunities, he didn't show anything special.  I don't want a guy who possibly can't either run or catch well, I would rather have a less athletic guy who's actually natural to that position.   If you want Archer as your 4th WR - that's your right and it's fine - but that means he's one injury away from getting significant playing time and the passing game taking a hit."

steelers,30dsl4,DriArcher,0,Thu Mar 26 23:40:45 2015 UTC,He had a touchdown against Baltimore but it was called back too.
steelers,30dsl4,DriArcher,2,Thu Mar 26 23:40:08 2015 UTC,"I know he's had problems with drops in the past, but he hasn't had any of those problems with US during his limited opportunities lining up at WR.  He's actually made some good catches in clutch situations.  I don't mind having him line up as a WR4 at all.  The coaches apparently feel the same way as he pretty much split snaps with Lance Moore as WR4 last year.  ...and they let Lance walk and brought back DHB.  The other good thing about it is that if/when we draft another WR for depth, DHB won't stand in there way of development by complaining about snap counts, etc.  If we draft a new guy and he wins out the WR4 spot, DHB will be cool with it.  That said, don't think for a second that DHB won't be competing HARD for that WR4 spot."
steelers,30dsl4,DF_1982,2,Thu Mar 26 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"the only reason he was a first round pick was because he was picked by a then-senile Al Davis, who's previous brilliant first round pick was JaMarcus Russell, obviously thinking that he could just a WR who could outrun everyone to compliment his QB who could bomb it down the field.  Unfortunately for the Raiders, one trick pony's don't work at a professional level.  If Al Davis had still been alive, we might not have Dri Archer on the team as he surely would have gone to the Raiders in the 1st or 2nd, although I'm sure a lot of fans would have been happy for that to have happened.  That being said I don't have any ill-will for Heyward-Bey, he finally seems to have acknowledged the writing on the wall and is now doing his utmost to be a team player rather than living with some sort of entitled ""special teams!? but I'm a first round draft pick!"" attitude, and as such has finally landed on a team that he fits with."
steelers,30dsl4,Steelering,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:12:52 2015 UTC,Well he was on the team last year. Not exactly new to the team.

steelers,30dsl4,Tbenzo,3,Thu Mar 26 16:07:15 2015 UTC,I like it. Provides depth at special teams and at the worst gives the team 4 WRs heading into the draft

Perhaps they, too, could become Steelers fans (like us) and enjoy the life to be had while supporting the NFL's Greatest Franchise.  They would undoubtedly benefit from abandoning those other second-class teams (or, in the case of Cleveland, fifth-class) in exchange for throwing their fandom behind the best team in the division.  Perhaps we could invite them over for tea?  I'm certain that many of them would convert to our way of life after they've had a taste of what it means to BE a Steelers fan.

steelers,30bf26,GalacticFed,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:05:54 2015 UTC,I like to think the bengals are the least hated team because of their bad past (1990-2008).

steelers,30bf26,serbat,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"what makes the Steelers different from other top teams is that the Steelers never spend big on players. They don't go seeking an all star team, instead they build teams through proper coaching and training. They know how to draft and what players fill roles from free agency. It never ceases to amaze me how many teams go after Steeler players in free agency and expect the same performance. Put Leveon Bell on any other team and he'd be benched. Antonio Brown would be a 2nd or 3rd receiver anywhere else. The position is crafted to the player and as Mike Wallace can tell you, you aren't going to be the big play receiver unless you have a big arm, proper pass protection and blocking that allows you to show off your speed in the big 65 yard TD catch that only happens in the Steeler system for him."
steelers,30bf26,DRU_leggo,4,Thu Mar 26 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"Bell would probably be the #1 back for every team in the league right now. Let's not go around talking like the Steelers made Bell because he may very well be the most talented back we've seen since Franco.  Also, let's not compare AB to mister one trick pony himself. AB is a much more complete receiver in the mold of Marvin Harrison."

steelers,30dllg,MattHoppe1,2,Thu Mar 26 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"Everyone wants corner in the first but it's a shallow pass rusher draft post round 1. The 3 plausibles are Bud, Eli Harold, and Owam Odi. The steelers are high on Eli and I like him too. The only corner I want at our pick is Jalen Collins. Maxx Williams is the dark horse. If we take Landon I'm throwing stuff.

steelers,30dllg,Quexana,5,Thu Mar 26 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"I won't be drafting Landon Collins.  Hell, I'd rather the Steelers draft Shaq Thompson and try to convert him to Safety than draft Landon Collins.  Round 1 I'll be looking at Bud Dupree, Eli Harold, Marcus Peters, Kevin Johnson, Jalen Collins & Owam Odi.  Dark horses imo would be La'El Collins or if any of the better pass rushers fall.  Round 2, I'll be looking at Kikaha, Golden, Orchard, Rollins, and Mauldin with a dark horse being Walford.  Round 3, Jesse James is okay, but I also really like Prewitt, Ekpre-Olamu, Carter, and Gwatchum here.  I might also be looking at O' Line prospects in this round.

Beasley and Fowler Jr have been helping their stock a lot, my guess is a lot of teams will now have them above Gregory. If Ray or even Dupree gets picked ahead of him too, that means 4 or even 5 OLBs have to go before the Steelers pick. That's a lot.."

steelers,30d550,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Thu Mar 26 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"No he isn't worth the risk even if he's available. Even before the failed idiot test, because that's what the Combine drug test is, the guy had a ton of concerns. He seriously lacks in play strength (worse than Jarvis did/does), he has terrible technique (watch him against MSU, he spends so much time uselessly hand fighting with the LT and that game is far from a rare occurrence), and he is the last guy out of his stance every single play. Now throw in him entering the league with a strike against him already and I see no reason the Steelers should waste a pick on this future bust.  He is all hype and I really hope someone else gets suckered in by his speed and length."
steelers,30d550,PSFanInNC,5,Thu Mar 26 15:12:51 2015 UTC,So he's a worse version of Jones in your eyes.. So you're saying he's a lock for the Steelers to draft .. :-|
steelers,30d550,simmonsb,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:39:52 2015 UTC,He's more Dion Jordan than Jarvis Jones in my opinion but yeah I could see the Steelers taking him if he's there.

We don't need a thumper to meet full backs in the hole, we need guys that can set the edge against tight ends on stretch plays or run them down from the ILB slots. Timmons, Spence, and Shazier all fit the ILB role, but Worilds was poor at setting the edge.  I think Vince could help there."

steelers,309ecd,SleestakLightning,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:27:43 2015 UTC,Jalen Collins> Johnson Jesse James> Koyak Markus Golden> any second round olb
steelers,309ecd,MattHoppe1,2,Wed Mar 25 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"Again, this is what I think the team will do. They seem to LOVE Johnson. I don't. I think they want a guy who can come in and start right away and they definitely prefer productive college players. Jalen Collins doesn't have the experience they look for. Plus, I think he's a reach at #22.  I don't see James lasting past the 3rd round, which is why he's not the TE pick. I think he goes early Round 3. James is the better choice as an offensive weapon (Maxx Williams is the best choice though) but Koyack is the better run blocker which is more important for the Steelers.  Markus Golden isn't a 2nd round pick. He would be a huge reach there. Kikaha has position flexibility and Tomlin indicated that the team is no longer going to be exclusively a 34 defense. Kikaha can play both fronts.   I also disagree that Golden is all that good of a fit as a 34 pass rusher. He has no pass rushing moves. He's good against the run but he can't shed blocks well enough to be a starting OLB in the NFL. He's basically a one-trick pony and that trick is only average for the NFL."
steelers,309ecd,Orangepeelss,3,Wed Mar 25 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"Collins also just had ankle surgery, no? But Colbert did say that they wouldn't draft a player just because he was more ready to contribute immediately, that they would still pick the best prospect."
steelers,309ecd,Orangepeelss,2,Wed Mar 25 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't see that quote but I'll take your word for it.  Out of Johnson and Collins, I'd rather have Collins but they love Kevin Johnson and I think unless someone unexpected drops to them they're taking KJ in the 1st."
steelers,309ecd,Orangepeelss,3,Wed Mar 25 18:08:17 2015 UTC,Quote  And I actually like KJ. I wouldn't mind seeing him drafted.
steelers,309ecd,Orangepeelss,2,Wed Mar 25 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that.  My problems with him are that he is a poor tackler, he gets turned around a lot and he can be late to locate the ball. Plus he's not very good against the run and he's prone to stupid penalties which is probably a bad thing for this team.   Unless they plan to use their CBs differently than in years past, Johnson definitely looks like a terrible fit."
steelers,309ecd,Orangepeelss,3,Wed Mar 25 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"As for the rest of your draft, I lived in the same neighborhood as Malcolm Brown he went to my local high school and I go to Texas State now and had class with Mager.

steelers,306096,MattEven,14,Tue Mar 24 19:35:32 2015 UTC,I could easily see this as well. Bell may very well lead the league in rushing with Murray out in Dallas and all the junk in the air with AP. Ben should lead the league in passing again as his weapons are all intact and a year older in a good way.   Has a team ever led in passing and rushing in the NFL? Might be the first.

We don't know what kind of coordinator Butler will be, he might simplify the defense and allow our young guys to perform at a high level. Guys like shamarko and shazier could come into their own. Most likely it won't be very good,  it honestly, I like our chances at improving with how our defensive line was playing at the end of last year. All of our linebackers are training with Harrison, and I believe we'll have a solid draft. I might just be blowing smoke, but I think our defense has a good shot at being average this year."

steelers,306096,AC0USTICB00GAL00,8,Wed Mar 25 12:06:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think Bell will lead the league, as I strongly believe there will be an effort to keep Bell fresh with Williams and the other backs.  He'll still get 80-85% of the carries - which he should - but he also needs to be kept fresh and not ran into the ground.   Passing attack should be once again very high up in yardage, but I want to see the red-zone efficiency increased and for more TD's to be put up.  The offense was 19th in RZ TD efficiency at 51.72%.  The offense should at worst be top 5/7, even with RZ woes."
steelers,306096,Kofile,6,Wed Mar 25 00:09:22 2015 UTC,"He won't lead the league if he's suspended the first 4 games of the season.   It could be a blessing, though. Keeps a little tread off his tires plus we have D-Will now."

steelers,305hzt,twobee2,6,Tue Mar 24 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"The only reason I wouldn't say it would tarnish his legacy/loyalty is because of LeBeau. I have nothing but love for LeBeau still and from everything I have seen, Harrison couldn't possibly think higher of another human than he does LeBeau. So it wouldn't have bothered me if he followed him there because he wouldn't be choosing Tennessee over Pittsburgh, he would be choosing LeBeau over Pittsburgh, which I could live with.   But I agree that would have hurt to see him go there, whew."
steelers,305hzt,KOERNDOG,3,Tue Mar 24 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"See, I think it would have bothered me though. Don't get me wrong, I love Lebeau, and I could only even imagine the sort of respect and admiration his players have of him.   But considering all the the circumstances, him going to Cincinnati, coming back to retire a Steeler, us giving him another chance to suit up, being that the offers were identical. I feel like him picking Lebeau over the Steelers, is him picking Lebeau over the city of Pittsburgh, over all the people who have loved watching him play over his career.   Come on, let's be honest Tennessee isn't going to be making a run for a super bowl anytime soon. (at least I think) We need him back this year. This team has a chance to contend for a Super Bowl. I don't know, at this point in his career, for him to go to the Tennessee Titans just would have stung a bit. I know its a business and everything, but when it comes to an organization like the Pittsburgh Steelers, I think it's more like a family.  God, I feel like a little girl."

I understand why he left the first time, but I simply could not have tolerated him leaving again, especially not after saying he wouldn't leave Pittsburgh because of his children.    I know he feels about LeBeau, I get it, but Harrison had to know they're not going to be Super Bowl contenders this year.  I went on a rant the other day to my son and I said ""This is bullshit.  If he doesn't re-sign and goes somewhere else, I'm not gonna be cheering for him when he comes back to retire."""

steelers,305hzt,Shadft,6,Tue Mar 24 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's different in this case to be fair. I can't blame anybody for doing what's best for himself, but considering the fact that Harrison had retired and his career would've been over if it hadn't been for Pittsburgh bringing him back, I personally would've been really upset to see him go to the Ravens, for example, when we still need him so badly. If he was in his prime, sure, get that money... But he's in the twilight of a career that never would've panned out in the first place if it wasn't for the Steelers organization giving him a shot. If he followed Lebeau, I would understand I guess, but his return out of retirement is such an amazing story, and I wouldn't wanna see it turn out any other way than him finishing up with the steelers."

steelers,302gag,PomfAndCircvmstance,12,Mon Mar 23 22:53:05 2015 UTC,"Given that Mitchell is much better when he's closer to the line (he doesn't track the ball in the air very well and he seems a little stiff when he needs to adjust or change directions) I should hope he isn't opposed to moving Mitchell to SS because SS is the guy's natural position. I've got a couple issues with this article though.  First off the only thing about Shamarko Thomas that suggests he'd be a better fit at SS than FS is because he's physical and shorter than you like in a DB. The guy is fast and explosive enough to cover a lot of ground as well as quick and capable of rapidly changing directions and, at least in college, the guy showed great awareness when it came to tracking the ball in the air. Those are great attributes for a deep FS to have and i'd argue he's a better fit at FS than Mitchell is because he's better in those areas than Mitchell is.   Second Landon Collins playing FS in college a little means nothing because Collins was not very good when asked to drop back into coverage down field and gave up a lot of catches when asked to do so. If a guy can't cover down field very well in college how can anybody expect him to do so in the NFL against much, much better receivers?"
steelers,302gag,biscuitz23,3,Mon Mar 23 23:13:29 2015 UTC,Thats one thing I didn't get from the article. Why draft collins if it seems that he's best suited to be a SS. I've seen a lot of knocks on him for being weak in coverage so I don't see how a lot of people have us drafting him.   I feel like they should test the waters on switching mitchell and sharmako and see how it turns out. Haven't seen enough of Thomas in coverage to know exactly how he is back there. Pretty excited to see it develop tho.
steelers,302gag,tolas,2,Mon Mar 23 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"His rookie year they were saying he's good enough to play slot corner, so i'm assuming they think he's good.  Only 2 career interceptions in college though."

steelers,302gag,Moses-SandyKoufax,6,Mon Mar 23 23:04:51 2015 UTC,I wish we could have pulled a good Centerfielder type FS to play next to Mitchell and play Shark at sort of a rover type DB. Sort of like Mathieu with the Cards.
steelers,302gag,tolas,3,Tue Mar 24 01:24:21 2015 UTC,I was kinda hoping for Rahim Moore.  Him + Mitchell and/or Shamarko could have been deadly.
steelers,302gag,Moses-SandyKoufax,2,Tue Mar 24 19:45:48 2015 UTC,"This was my biggest hope for the offseason too, buddy."
steelers,302gag,lukahnli,3,Tue Mar 24 21:05:47 2015 UTC,Shamarko can play FS.    Mike Mitchell is more of a natural fit for SS.
steelers,302gag,Rolmeister,6,Tue Mar 24 16:21:02 2015 UTC,I think Shamarko played slot corner some during camp and a few games his rookie season if I'm not mistaken. Given that Mitchell is fucking hopeless in the role maybe it's an upgrade having Mitchell at SS and Shamarko at FS.  Still don't know why they'd draft Landon Collins though. Dude is pretty bad in coverage. We don't need an all SS backfield.
steelers,302gag,Kofile,3,Mon Mar 23 23:32:36 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether Mitchell switches to SS or not, I hope that Thomas isn't just handed handed the other Safety job (assuming that Polamalu leaves and that Collins or another high-round Safety is drafted).  I personally like what I've seen from Shark in limited time, but I'm not convinced he's the long term answer at the other Safety position.   Really, the only person person that I have any faith in in the secondary is Bill Gay.   Pretty much every other position - backup or starting - is somewhat in murky waters (I don't really count Mitchell because of his contract situation and because he played in this defense during a year where the whole unit sucked)."
steelers,302gag,otnormal,4,Tue Mar 24 00:11:38 2015 UTC,I have faith in Blake
steelers,302gag,Kofile,3,Tue Mar 24 02:31:39 2015 UTC,"Totally forgot about Blake. But to be honest, his and McCain's performance last year were both exageratted by just how bad Allen played before he was benched.  They're both realistically - at best - 3rd and 4th corners."
steelers,302gag,tolas,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:58:46 2015 UTC,"Disagree completely.  At best Cortez Allen is a #1 corner in this league, and the front office thinks so too with the contract he got.  Don't forget Ike Taylor had a down year and was benched.  Will Gay had multiple bad years before turning it on.  Allen has all the tools to be a #1 corner in this league.  Let's see what he can do with it."
steelers,302gag,Kofile,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"Allen has the physical ability to he a high 2, low 1 - but he hasn't consistently played like it since he was drafted. I think he's going to come around, but it's no sure thing. It isn't like he was a solid player or known commodity before he went into the shitter.  Also, with Ike, his career is basically over. If you're the FO, you can't expect Taylor to be a consistent producer on the defense. Hell, can Ike even make it another full season healthy AND playing solid?  Gay was bad when he was forced into #1/2 rules, but he's never necessarily been a ""bad"" slot corner. If Deshea Townsend was a 7, Gay to me is a 6.5 or so. What Gay does seem to have - much like with Townsend - was the ability to make the key interception that closed games.  Yes, Gay will get torched from time to time, but all corners do.  He's not Revis, or Sherman, or even one of the best Slot corners in the league, but he's fine at what he does.   I really thing Allen will then it on.. I really do.  Hopefully in the end the disaster that was last season helps right Cortez's ship."

Human  B.) undersized, yet still fights like hell for the ball and to defend passes in general.  C.) Blake and McCain were nothing more than glorified 3rd/4th corners given starting jobs. They both would've been NICE to have - especially since the team has hardly any depth in the secondary - but they're replaceable.  I separate what players do on and off the field when discussing their on-the-field worth, but y'all can do what you want.  If it was a DWI/DUI I would be advocating for his ass to be gone. To me, that's a crime that's treated way too kindly in the NFL.  But it was a PI... I'm pretty sure that some of you here have either gotten a PI before or been pretty fucking blasted and could've probably gotten ticketed for one.  Let's stop acting like the Steelers are full of choir boys for once. They're hardly any different than the Bengals, Cowboys, or Raiders OFF OF THE FIELD.

If there was some sort of ""Rover"" on the defense, I think Thomas could be that.   But, as you said, the D needs another true cover safety.

steelers,3033kq,PDwasHere,14,Tue Mar 24 03:26:44 2015 UTC,"Any of you guys who see this and go 'meh' should really catch up on recent history.  Kelvin Beachum, our above average left tackle, was a seventh round pick (a compensatory pick as well if I remember correctly).  Brett Keisel was a a seventh round pick and Antonio Brown was a sixth.  You should always be excited for any form of compensatory pick even if it is just a seventh."
steelers,3033kq,ColdNose,6,Tue Mar 24 06:26:44 2015 UTC,Picks are great but a seventh rounder is still a long shot to get a great player.
steelers,3033kq,dj0,2,Tue Mar 24 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"I hear you but a pick is a pick.  Obviously the higher the better, but the draft is such a crapshoot I'm always ecstatic when I hear we get these kind of picks."
steelers,3033kq,ColdNose,0,Tue Mar 24 17:44:29 2015 UTC,who is? and why just recent? nfl history.
steelers,3033kq,SicaBiasThrowaway,4,Tue Mar 24 08:37:02 2015 UTC,Just another area where the Steelers can do so much better.  Baltimore games the system all the time and specifically targets players who were cut to gain extra comp picks. New England does the same.

Players who are cut don't count against compensatory picks, it's all about players who become free agents after their contracts run out."
steelers,3033kq,MrGoosemahn,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:31:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a weird formula, but it is sometimes helpful. For example, since DeAngelo Williams was cut by Carolina, he won't count against us for 2016 compensatory picks. Though we probably won't get any, since Worilds retired, and McCain signed a pretty small deal."
steelers,3033kq,MrGoosemahn,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:34:01 2015 UTC,I think it also takes into consideration on whether they were starting or not.  I think we end up with a 7th for McCain.
steelers,302xep,PhlyingHigh,11,Tue Mar 24 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Best case? 13-3. We have a POWERFUL offense, most of which is returning this year. Miller will be another year older, but still performed well last year. Bell will be suspended 2-4 games to start the season...which will suck...but hopefully we come out of that at .500 or better.  Defense is the iffy part...if our secondary gels then we could easily be the team to fear in the AFC...new DC...but he's been in the system forever, so there shouldn't be a huge change. Polamalu is 99.9% gone...but he wasn't particularly solid last year either...our run defense isn't that bad to be honest. Our secondary is more tertiary than anything...Cortez Allen basically died on the field, and even Polamalu looked old.  Worst case? 10-6.  Either way I see us in the playoffs for 2015."
steelers,302xep,jdpatric,13,Tue Mar 24 01:42:00 2015 UTC,Worst case 10-6?  You're more optimistic than I am. We have a really hard schedule this year. I'm not saying the Steelers won't do great but I could see a worse record than 10-6 as a possibility. The good thing is that the rest of the AFCN all have hard schedules too.
steelers,302xep,Homeless_Prophet,12,Tue Mar 24 02:46:16 2015 UTC,"Defense will suck. There's a lot of ""Ifs."" If Jarvis Jones develops. If the ILBs besides Timmons develop. If Shamarko Thomas is ready to play on defense. If Cortez Allen can bounce back. If Arthur Moats can handle a heavier workload.  That said, the offense is more than good enough to carry the team, sucky defense and all, to a winning season. Munchak is another year more familiar with the OL that really came together. Martavis Bryant and Markus Wheaton are another year more familiar with the team and playbook. DeAngelo Williams won't try to sabotage the team and throw a tantrum if he feels like he's not getting enough carries. Either Heath will be another year removed from his torn ACL, still rehabbing and getting back to pre-tear form, or we've drafted a guy, either way TE will be just the cherry on top of an otherwise already dominant offense.  I don't really care about the schedule and how it's so difficult. If anything, the difficulty of the schedule should help the team given the pattern of playing up or down to opponents."
steelers,302xep,Steinerway,10,Tue Mar 24 01:44:49 2015 UTC,I feel that the Steeler's have a chance to make their mark this season with their offense IF they beat Patriots and Seahawks. That would be nice.
steelers,302xep,SteelerBoss,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:27:16 2015 UTC,I feel like they made their mark last year...I'm not sure I understand your point...
steelers,302xep,Steinerway,5,Tue Mar 24 04:32:22 2015 UTC,After Bell was out in the playoffs the Steeler's offense was stale. If they go into NE and beat the Pats without Bell with Ben as the hero I feel that it would be a big statement game. As well as the away game vs. the Seahawks I feel that if the Steeler's beat them in their house it would silence anyone's doubters of Ben's ability and the big money contract he was signed.
steelers,302xep,SteelerBoss,0,Tue Mar 24 18:47:44 2015 UTC,"Again...the majority of doubters of the offense's abilities were silenced last year, and I haven't seen many doubters of the contract. It's pretty much agreed upon that that's a fairly modest deal for a two time Super Bowl winning franchise QB who is in the back end of his prime, but his prime nonetheless.  Let alone without Bell, it was with practice-squadder Josh Harris and street free agent, already cut by two other teams that season alone, three-days-on-the-roster Ben Tate. Not exactly DeAngelo Williams back there.  And even all that aside, as I alluded to above, two games won't ""prove"" what they did in the 16 games from last season any more than...you know...those 16 games from last season. ""Statement games"" are nothing more than headlines for the media."

steelers,302xep,SteelerBoss,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:42:48 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I just hate the idea of ""statement games."" This amazing performance meant more than...that other one that was just as amazing? Why? Because this one came against a team whose balls the media is choking on? Nah, there are better ways of evaluating whether or not a team is legit. I guess I'd understand it if the potential was there but it never came together until this one ""statement"" game. But how much more of a mark does the previous year's #2 offense with all starters returning and 8 of whom are aged 27 or younger need to make?"
steelers,302xep,Steinerway,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:56:25 2015 UTC,I guess you could say the statement would be de-throning the Packers NFC best offense vs. the Steelers AFC best offense during a rematch of the last super bowl during SB50. Wishful thinking huh?
steelers,302xep,SteelerBoss,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:32:32 2015 UTC,"Anything is possible in March. I do always hope for that matchup though, the Packers are by far my second favorite team. Made the Super Bowl loss hurt just a teeny bit less."
steelers,302xep,Steinerway,5,Wed Mar 25 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"The Steelers offense is ridiculously talented. They have a top 5 QB, a top 5 RB, and a top 5 WR as well as a good O-line that only figures to get better and a talented young skills position group anchored by Heath Miller. They have an offense capable of carrying a bad defense into the playoffs (which happened last year).  Defensively the team was ranked 18th in scoring defense, 18th in total yardage, and 27th against the pass. Despite what some people think I don't believe the defense has gotten any worse since the only player they've really lost on that side of the ball worth a damn was Brice McCain. Polamalu was awful, Worilds was terrible against the run and mediocre when it came to rushing the QB, and Ike Taylor never played and wasn't very good anyways so while the team has lost some name value it really hasn't lost anything in the way of talent.  With a solid draft and young guys either stepping up (Shamarko, Tuitt, Moats) staying healthy and stepping up (Jarvis, Shazier) or continuing to play well (Gay, Heyward, McLendon, Timmons) I see no reason the defense shouldn't improve at least marginally. I also feel that moving from LeBeau to Butler is an upgrade as the past few seasons the Steelers have been killed by a lack of adjustments/tweaks that I believe a younger mind will be more inclined to make.  A lot has been made of the Steelers having a hard schedule but given how bad the Steelers have played against the dregs of the NFL I actually believe the harder schedule is a positive for the team. Overall I feel that this year's squad will be better across the board than last year's 11-5 team and I think 11-5 is a decent number to predict for the team right now. I expect they'll be in the hunt for or leading the division all of next year and a Super Bowl run isn't out of the question as they're talented enough to go toe to toe with any team in the NFL."

The rest are all winnable.  So in a good scenario, let's call it 13-3 (let's keep Arizona game on our board on the optimistic side).  On the pessimistic side, let's give each division team a W, because we seem to do that. That makes it 10-6. Throw in one more loss to a random opponent (not SD or KC or IND, more like OAK or SF).

steelers,3009hg,zjrk,8,Mon Mar 23 16:35:46 2015 UTC,That's Marcus Peters
steelers,3009hg,garglemymarbles,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha."
steelers,3009hg,zjrk,0,Mon Mar 23 16:49:32 2015 UTC,No thanks.
steelers,3009hg,SleestakLightning,10,Mon Mar 23 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"I want Marcus Peters in the 1st. He's a realistic option to be there at #22, as far as cover skills go he's on par with (maybe even a little better) than Trae Waynes, he has the size and strength to match up with bigger receivers, and his awareness and instincts are as good as any CB i've seen since Patrick Peterson. He's got a temper and can play too emotional at times but that attitude is part of why he's so good and with guys like Joey Porter and Mike Tomlin around to talk to him and calm him down I don't see the Steelers having any issues with Peters in their locker room. The guy is a plug and play day one starter and there aren't a lot of corners like that in this draft.  I want Hau'oli Kikaha in the 2nd almost as much as I want Peters in the  1st. In my opinion he's the 4th best edge player in this draft (behind only Beasley, Fowler Jr, and Harold). The guy uses his hands extremely well, he bends and gets low without losing his speed or quickness, he has a variety of moves which he uses to great effect when coming after the QB, and he has the physical attributes to develop into a very complete player while still making an impact early due to his plus pass rushing skills. If he checks out medically then he has the talent to be a special player in the NFL."
steelers,3009hg,PomfAndCircvmstance,4,Mon Mar 23 17:20:42 2015 UTC,I saw one scout say Peters is the best CB prospect he's seen since Champ Bailey.  Many of Peters' teammates spoke well of him.
steelers,3009hg,steelbydesign,3,Mon Mar 23 21:05:03 2015 UTC,I so agree with Hau'oli Kikaha. He reminds me of one of those white walker savages (game of thrones).
steelers,3009hg,heavymedicine,2,Mon Mar 23 22:23:44 2015 UTC,"I'd be okay with Peters if LeBeau was still on the staff.   Peters reminds me of a young James Harrison who was almost uncoachable, but LeBeau got through to him."
steelers,3009hg,A_Smitty56,3,Mon Mar 23 19:14:52 2015 UTC,"Peters reminds me of a young James Harrison who was almost uncoachable, but LeBeau got through to him.   Honestly I feel Peters gets a bad rap about being difficult to coach due to what was kind of a weird situation at Washington last year. Everything i've read on the situation leads me to believe that Sarkisian (new HC at Washington) was looking to make an example of Peters which would explain the strict punishment.  As steelbydesign said his teammates speak well of him and from interviews I get the impression that Peters realizes he made some mistakes and wants to be a better player and a better teammate moving forward."

steelers,3009hg,A_Smitty56,5,Mon Mar 23 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"Before the DeAngelo Williams signing, I would've said David Johnson out of Northern Iowa. Perfect backup for Bell while being an excellent value pick. But now, Trae Waynes out of Michigan St. I'm sure he won't be on the board, but I think Colbert has found a solid player pipeline in Mich. St. as those guys tend to be tough players that can play good football."
steelers,3009hg,steelerman36,2,Mon Mar 23 13:54:52 2015 UTC,"David Johnson would be perfect. 6'1"" 224, powerful runner that is good after contact, falls forward, burst through the hole, and a former receiver (great hands).   The guy is a Bell clone, and I'd take him even with D.Will"

steelers,3009hg,sweatytacos,7,Mon Mar 23 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"If there aren't any worthwhile OLB or CB picks in R1 when the Steelers draft, Maxx Williams."
steelers,3009hg,Kofile,5,Mon Mar 23 17:07:40 2015 UTC,You and me are the only ones saying this.
steelers,3009hg,SleestakLightning,3,Mon Mar 23 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"I enjoy being in the minority anyway.  The offense is in need of a TE that can attack deep down the middle of the field that Miller can't do anymore/could never do anymore.  If you're going to run a 2TE set anyway, I would rather have 2 TEs that are BOTH bonafide threats to catch a pass - not to mention the WRs and RB on the field.   And while I like Jesse James - I'm an unabashed PSU fan - and his size, Williams could help the offense immediately and more consistently than James could IMO.  I only want Williams in R1 if everyone/anyone else that Pittsburgh would want isn't available.  I don't want a reach for a NT, OT - or a reach in general.   This team is in dire need of immediate playmakers. And while for the most part these are on defense, a young TE would/could benefit the offense greatly in the red zone which is somewhere where Pittsburgh needs to greatly improve on.  Yeah, the offense was ""great"" being 2nd overall, but another big RZ target - along with an additional year of additional maturity - could help an offense that scored LESS THAN 20 POINTS IN 9/17 GAMES."
steelers,3009hg,Kofile,5,Mon Mar 23 20:28:31 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with all of that. That kind of thinking, which I think is superior to the ""draft OLB/CB no matter what"" mentality, gets crapped on a lot here though."
steelers,3009hg,SleestakLightning,3,Mon Mar 23 20:40:48 2015 UTC,"I don't want to reach for a guy who's a late 2nd-early 3rd round guy based on his position and need. If there's a quality player there in R1, grab him.   TE IS A NEED. Not as big as CB, OLB, or Safety - but it's still a need."
steelers,3009hg,Kofile,3,Mon Mar 23 22:27:33 2015 UTC,Exactly. People assume that the first round should be reserved for the biggest need and that is a hilariously bad idea.
steelers,3009hg,SleestakLightning,2,Tue Mar 24 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it should, but not all of the time."
steelers,3009hg,Kofile,3,Tue Mar 24 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"could help an offense that scored LESS THAN 20 POINTS IN 9/17 GAMES.   I counted 5, Ravens x2, Jets, Browns, Jags. There were also 7 games where they scored 30 or more. Colts, Ravens, Bengals, Browns, Saints, Texans, and Panthers."
steelers,3009hg,sw337,2,Tue Mar 24 15:47:05 2015 UTC,I originally mis-counted: the offense scored 20 or more in 9/17 games. 8/17 they scored less than that  20+  CIN x 2 CLE 1 Car  Tb Hou Indy Bal #2 NO
steelers,3009hg,Kofile,-1,Tue Mar 24 16:01:10 2015 UTC,Eh if we're in that scenario is rather they just take a O-lineman or NT.  I'm really not impressed with Williams in the first round
steelers,3009hg,A_Smitty56,3,Mon Mar 23 19:16:20 2015 UTC,"Vic Beasley is the dream pass rusher for me, but he most likely wont be there. If not than definitely Harold."
steelers,3009hg,ganekelioque,3,Mon Mar 23 14:56:05 2015 UTC,When you said Beasly I immediately thought of Dallas' Cole Beasley.
steelers,3009hg,Kofile,3,Mon Mar 23 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"Vic Beasley, Bud Dupree, Marcus Peters, Maxx Williams, La'El Collins, Owa Odighizuwa."
steelers,3009hg,SleestakLightning,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"That's good for rounds 1 - 6, but who would you take in the 7th?"
steelers,3009hg,Intropy_,3,Tue Mar 24 07:58:17 2015 UTC,If they pulled that draft off they could just sit back and draft me and you in the 7th and it would be still be considered great.
steelers,3009hg,SleestakLightning,3,Tue Mar 24 13:13:57 2015 UTC,"Marcus Peters, Trae Waynes, or someone like Bud Dupree or maybe even Eli Harold in the first. In the second, depending on where we go in the first, I'd like to see either Ronald Darby or Owa or Kikaha.   Some other players I'd love to see come to da 'Burgh are: Jesse James (TE Penn State), Donovan Smith (T or G Penn State). As you can see I've got my penn state homer goggles on here. But I really think that James can develop into something special. And Donovan Smith is going to be the best value of the draft. This guy would really help bring this O-line up."
steelers,3009hg,Volleyball45,2,Tue Mar 24 14:21:51 2015 UTC,I just want a good defensive back but a good linebacker will do too
steelers,3009hg,hstisalive,4,Mon Mar 23 18:05:41 2015 UTC,"I want Marcus Peters or Trae Waynes in the first, if we can't get either of those, I'm taking Owa as my dark horse in the draft. None of the other names have impressed me all that much. My opinion probably isn't worth a whole lot here, I don't pay too much attention to college ball and missed the combine."
steelers,3009hg,Goldeneagle17,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:46:24 2015 UTC,Youtube will help us with that. Hopefully they have some highlights on there. :)
steelers,3009hg,hstisalive,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:52:46 2015 UTC,Trae Waynes is too small and not physical enough against the run to be a good fit for the Steelers.   I like Owa and Peters though.
steelers,3009hg,SleestakLightning,2,Mon Mar 23 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"Dante Fowler is my favorite prospect in the draft.  As far as an ""under-the-radar"" guy that should be there at 1.22, I really like Eli Harold more than most."
steelers,3009hg,tolas,2,Mon Mar 23 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"i think next year we should get C. Hackenburg. he is perfect to replace Ben, and i am a psu fan and live close to State College so i know a lot about him. he acts a lot like Ben (off and on the field)  EDIT 2: Spelling again and spacing"
steelers,3009hg,kingkoons,2,Wed Mar 25 02:18:28 2015 UTC,"Ben Koyack, he is basically Heath Jr."

steelers,2zwxf4,IdunnoLXG,5,Sun Mar 22 16:25:11 2015 UTC,Exactly!
steelers,2zwxf4,Diarygirl,19,Sun Mar 22 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"He came in off of no training camp, no running and still produced. Let's see what the Silverback can do when he's prepared for the season."
steelers,2zwxf4,slivr33,9,Sun Mar 22 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly and people forget he didn't bevome a starter until late in his career, add to that the fact that he is a freak of nature when it comes to the gym."
steelers,2zwxf4,TheLastStarFighter,24,Sun Mar 22 19:13:43 2015 UTC,"I'm happy he's back like a lot here, but the situation at OLB should've never gotten to the point where signing a 36 year old would ""save"" this OLBs/defense.   The front office should know how to develop talent at the position instead of relying to players whose careers are basically over."
steelers,2zwxf4,Kofile,28,Sun Mar 22 16:48:06 2015 UTC,I mean that's easy to say. But Jarvis snapped  his wrist in two forcing a fumble in week 3.
steelers,2zwxf4,DriArcher,3,Sun Mar 22 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"If Jarvis Jones didn't get hurt and lose what seemed to be a promising start very early in the season I don't know that we would be worrying about the outside backers.  Moats is a very versatile outside backer and he's going to be able to rotate in and out of either side.  Harrison showed last year that after he got into game shape he still has it in a major way.  His back and legs aren't bothering him and he's still hulk strong.  Losing Shazier like we did also cast some more doom and gloom and rightfully so.    A lot of us are forgetting about lemon.  Yes he's a cfl product but we could have something with him.  Jones, harrison, moats, lemon and I'm sure a top 4 rounds rookie.  We are stacked at middle linebacker, absolutely stacked and I wouldn't be shocked to see Shazier bounce outside some on situational downs.  Harrison despite his age doesn't have as many miles as a lot of players and his work ethic and strength are with very little company.  How many people will be shocked if he gets double digit sacks?  Maybe I'm a homer but I almost expect it.  He's going to really rub off on our young guys too.  They are already training with him.  Its a terrific signing and I'm far less worried about the outside backers.  I expect a corner and a olb in the first three rounds.  Everything is going to be just fine and the reality is our offense is going to be so damn ridiculous it may not even matter.  Once our defense catches up.  Man oh man."
steelers,2zwxf4,Rorbotron,4,Sun Mar 22 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"You're right, but what I said still has merit.   Giving an example of shitty luck - which is what it was - DOESNT remove the fact that there's been a recent failure of developing OLBs  That's why the down vote button needs to be removed from this sub. Any unpopular opinion - however true it is - gets down voted."
steelers,2zwxf4,Kofile,4,Sun Mar 22 17:33:33 2015 UTC,"Jason Worilds thing was unpredictable, but I agree somewhat."
steelers,2zwxf4,Mc3lnosher,3,Sun Mar 22 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"His retirement was unfortunate and kinda out of nowhere, that's without a doubt.   What do you not agree with specifically?"
steelers,2zwxf4,Kofile,7,Sun Mar 22 18:47:35 2015 UTC,"Just saying the Jason Worilds incident was a decent draft pick and then we got thrown a wildcard. So yeah we haven't developed enough talent at OLB but we've also had some curve balls. Front office needs to do better, but it some of it was out of their control. I think we all agree Le'veon Bell is amazing, but imagine if he just up and does a Ray Rice or an Adrian Peterson or something.  Then we go from pretty good RB situation to pretty bleak."
steelers,2zwxf4,Mc3lnosher,2,Sun Mar 22 18:53:31 2015 UTC,"The development on the offensive side of the ball has been much better - especially as of late - than the defense.   With the defense, the picks for the most part have been made with the right slotting/intentions/not too many ""boner WTF dick Blood"" picks (my offensive equivalent is drafting Landry Jones and then more recently Dri Archer when the team had much bigger holes than a gadget RB who is largely ineffective).  Where the development has fallen short is the lack of early oppurtunities for higher D picks to get significant playing time early in their careers. Most will cite LeBeau's ""complicated system that is unfriendly to rookies"", well guess what? Players will make mistakes anyway - especially rookies. Fuck, even VETERANS make mistakes.   When you're trying to develop talent at key positions - especially thsoe who you're thinking could be key starters - it's hinders your ability to make adequate personnel decisions is that much harder when younger players don't have enough film/playing time to judge if they can be effective pieces of your teams future.  We see this problem with Shamarko Thomas and whether or not he can replace Troy long-term and whether or not a contract may need to be given to him later down the road.  Your Bell example is actually a excellent one. The example I compare that to isn't as drastic/severe as the Rice/Peterson one, but I still think it's similar.  Mendenhall and Sweed were both drafted with being key contributors down the road. Mendenhall had all of the skills of being a feature back - and actually had a solid career despite his early retirement and leaving of the Steelers.   Sweed, on the other hand, was looking to be - at the time of his drafting - to be the next star WR for Pittsburgh and Ben's ""new Plax"" in the red zone.   Sadly, his career never panned out despite his insane physical ability.   What both of those picks had in common is that their drafting and roles right off the bat had clear reason and easy-to-see roles on the team. They both were even seen as ""steals"" by many at the time. But, even despite this, neither panned out to their full potential. And, in Sweed's example, didn't even ever really materialize into anything.  There's a fine line between not developing players correctly/fucking the goose on draft picks / or players not panning (Example A) and drafting a player that started to develop and him never materializing (Example B), and a stupid fucking pick that made no sense regarding the current roster at the time and the round/pick he was drafted (Example C).  Example A: Bruce Davis, Alonzo Jackson  Example B: Limas Sweed, Rashard Mendenhall  Example C: Landry Jones, and to a lesser degree Dri Archer"
steelers,2zwxf4,Kofile,3,Sun Mar 22 19:11:48 2015 UTC,"I don't see how anyone can say that we have drafted well at OLB these last few seasons. Its the front offices job to not draft ""wild cards"" by the name of Jason Worilds. Wildcards that get drafted have the names of Randy Moss, and Dez Bryant. That being said Worilds is probably the best draft choice at olb since Woodley, so even if you score Worilds as a good pick. That is a grand total of....2."

steelers,2zwxf4,Kofile,3,Mon Mar 23 00:48:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that there was no depth after Moats and Jones. Zumwalt and HoJo looked promising last preseason but Moats, Jones, HoJo, and Zumwalt isn't really a good group. One injury and we would have been in for a world of trouble.  That's not to say that the problems at OLB are solved. I imagine they'll take at least one in the first 3 rounds which will help immensely."
steelers,2zwxf4,k__e__n,18,Mon Mar 23 02:17:10 2015 UTC,"I was scared we'd lose him. He's a great veteran presence. Even if he doesn't play as well as last year, I'm glad he's back. We were thin at OLB."
steelers,2zwxf4,wishesgrantd,7,Sun Mar 22 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, without injury he can still be a really valuable asset.

steelers,301982,justintree77,2,Mon Mar 23 17:48:41 2015 UTC,No we would keep Ike if we are signing a 34 year old corner. He is also coming off 2 consecutive season ending injuries.
steelers,301982,rianad,2,Mon Mar 23 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"He has plenty of experience playing the run in a scheme that uses a lot of zone, but he was more a Lovie Smith Cover-2 type corner.    Actually, he and Ike were teammates at UL Lafayette and were drafted only 90 picks apart in 2003, so there is a neat bit of symmetry in replacing Ike with Peanut.  But, like everyone says, he's 34 and coming off of multiple injuries.  Not worth the price."

steelers,2zzq8n,smacksaw,23,Mon Mar 23 08:08:41 2015 UTC,"No. Just no.   I don't mean to sound rude or anything, but the idea of putting Polamalu at OLB is nothing short of ridiculous. At ILB, it's not so ridiculous, but he wouldn't be very productive.  The skillset he has is for a safety, maybe a safety/lb hybrid on certain downs. Certainly not for a full-time ILB or OLB. I understand the fact that LBs are getting smaller these days, but none are Troy Polamalu's size.   Polamalu does not have the strength to take on blockers, nor does he have the repertoire of pass-rushing moves that we need. OLBs for us are pass-rushers first, run-stuffers second, coverage guys third. There's a reason we look for pass-rushing DEs and then see if we can teach them how to cover, and not the other way around. Polamalu would get absolutely destroyed as an OLB. He would never be able to set the edge, and would get completely consumed by offensive linemen. For the same reasons, he would be a complete liability in run defense. Offenses would just run to whichever side Polamalu is on. Basically, we'd be playing with 10 guys on defense on those downs. A fullback alone could take care of him on running plays. If we played a 4-3, it would still be a bad idea, but it could be a little more justifiable. But certainly not in a 3-4. Look at the strength and power that Harrison, Woodley, Worilds, Porter, all those guys had. Now look at Polamalu. He is at least 30 lbs. lighter and probable 2 or three inches shorter. Size doesn't matter to a certain degree, but it does matter in this case. You can't put a guy with the size of a CB at 3-4 OLB. He doesn't have the strength or muscle to excel there.  As for Polamalu at ILB, it would be a waste of a roster spot, TBH. At this point in his career, Polamalu is not special anymore. And with the amount of young ILBs we have, I would much rather see what Shazier, Spence, and Williams can do, than what Polamalu might do. Yes, we used him there, but it was because we had no other talent alongside Timmons. We were playing a 6th round rookie, who did admirably well for what was being asked from him, but wasn't good. Williams has since improved, and deserves to keep playing. And that's not taking into consideration the fact that Polamalu would still have to adjust his playing style to be more scheme-disciplined and not roam around as he frequently does.  And we can't shift Timmons or Shazier outside either. The positions are entirely different, and the skills required are completely different as well. I can understand moving DEs and NTs, or even shifting OLBs to ILBs, but not ILBs to OLBs. OLBs have to be talented pass-rushers, period. Speed doesn't matter much. Again, look at Harrison, Woodley, or Porter. They weren't blazing athletes, yet they were always effective. It's a great plus to have speed, but it isn't a requirement."
steelers,2zzq8n,MrGoosemahn,2,Mon Mar 23 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"but the idea of putting Polamalu at OLB is nothing short of ridiculous.    Was it two years ago?  Let me take you back to 2013: Andrew Whitworth of the Bengals. Pro Bowl LT. Troy finished the game at ROLB and abused him mercilessly. He shouldn't even have worked at ROLB. That's where you need size. LOLB is where you have some coverage responsibilities.    At ILB, it's not so ridiculous, but he wouldn't be very productive.   I am more torn there. He and Timmons adjusting the defense would be very strong. Troy can share his instincts and observations. Playing back at S he can't. The fact is, there are pluses for both. Our biggest problem on D has been the lack of a captain since Farrior was forced out. Timmons doesn't see what Farrior saw.   Polamalu does not have the strength to take on blockers, nor does he have the repertoire of pass-rushing moves that we need.    Again, when Polamalu played ILB and RDE 2 years ago, he proved that false. In fact his moves on the edge were so quick and agile that it was a total mismatch.   OLBs for us are pass-rushers first, run-stuffers second, coverage guys third.    And now you know why LeBeau was fired. In the modern NFL, OLBs (especially the LOLB) needs to be able to cover. That's why DeAndre Levy is so valuable to the Lions: he can cover. The game has changed. Even going back almost 10 years in the links I showed you the need for a quicker and smaller LB is there. Teams play in the nickel or dime all the time now. Having DB/LB like Troy means you can change the scheme without subbing personnel.   There's a reason we look for pass-rushing DEs and then see if we can teach them how to cover, and not the other way around.    LeBeau is gone. There's a reason he was let go.   Polamalu would get absolutely destroyed as an OLB. He would never be able to set the edge, and would get completely consumed by offensive linemen...A fullback alone could take care of him on running plays.    Except that has never happened when he's rushed from the outside. He goes around the slower lineman and if they put in an extra blocker he can physically beat them. Teams don't use a FB anymore and if we forced a team to do so, they're also playing with 10 guys.   He is at least 30 lbs. lighter and probable 2 or three inches shorter. Size doesn't matter to a certain degree, but it does matter in this case. You can't put a guy with the size of a CB at 3-4 OLB.   Which is why I pointed out there were LBs at 220 and LBs at 5'11"". He would need to gain 13 pounds to get to 220. I would much rather have a shorter, stouter RB than a guy who is tall and lanky. It's why most prototypical RBs are 220lbs and under 6' and not 220' of 6'+. You lose the ability to get under and the center of gravity. Teams want taller LBs to get hands on balls. Troy can do that. He does it, even at his height. It's not unrealistic for him to gain 13lbs (or more) and his height has worked. The players you've mentioned don't match up with the pass-catching TEs and quick slot WRs of today.   As far as shifting them outside, the LOLB especially now isn't a pass-rushing position. Guys like DeAndre Levy are the prototype of the new LB - a guy who can stop the run and cover the pass. Teams are throwing more often and throwing quickly, often before you can even get there on the side a right-handed QB sees. Shazier has the speed and range to do that. Timmons has the experience and instinct."
steelers,2zzq8n,MrGoosemahn,11,Mon Mar 23 17:35:22 2015 UTC,"Was it two years ago? Let me take you back to 2013: Andrew Whitworth of the Bengals. Pro Bowl LT. Troy finished the game at ROLB and abused him mercilessly. He shouldn't even have worked at ROLB. That's where you need size. LOLB is where you have some coverage responsibilities.   I can't remember that particular game you're mentioning, but I don't remember Troy lining up as the ROLB consistently for any game. Maybe during some plays, but never consistently. I do remember him blitzing from the edge, beside the OLB, but never as the OLB himself. In the last five years, he's had 5 sacks, one of which was against Cincinnati, and it was this play: http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000115465/Polamalu-jumps-snap-sacks-Dalton  I don't ever recall Troy abusing Andrew Whitworth mercilessly either, but I'll look into it.   I am more torn there. He and Timmons adjusting the defense would be very strong. Troy can share his instincts and observations. Playing back at S he can't. The fact is, there are pluses for both. Our biggest problem on D has been the lack of a captain since Farrior was forced out. Timmons doesn't see what Farrior saw.   I don't think adjustments and insticts have anything to do with a particular positions. There are D-line adjustments, LB adjustments, and DB adjustments. Instincts are instincts, period. Players either have them or they don't, but it's a particular trait of an individual player, not a collective thing for the unit as a whole.  Regarding the lack of captain and what Farrior saw, that is a non-issue. As of right now, Timmons is every bit the talented ILB that Farrior was. The thing is that back then, Foote took on blockers and Farrior was free to flow to the ballcarrier. In the last years, LeBeau interchanged that role a lot. Right now, both Timmons and whoever is beside him have to both take on blockers or make the tackle. The role isn't as clear as it used to be. Polamalu would have to be a ""flower"" if you will, he will never succeed at taking on blockers to free up Timmons. Consequently, that leaves Timmons as the guy who takes on blockers. It limits the functionality of the two at ILB.    Again, when Polamalu played ILB and RDE 2 years ago, he proved that false. In fact his moves on the edge were so quick and agile that it was a total mismatch.   Polamalu has absolutely never played DE for us. Not once. I think you might be confusing him lining up close to the line of scrimmage as him playing another position. There is absolutely no way for Polamalu to play DE in our system. As for him being a good pass-rusher, that is just false. Again, 12 career regular-season sacks in 12 years. That's basically one sack per season. I don't know how many times he's been blitzed, but I'm guessing he hasn't been elite in that category. No safety is. It's not their job to be good pass-rushers.   And now you know why LeBeau was fired. In the modern NFL, OLBs (especially the LOLB) needs to be able to cover. That's why DeAndre Levy is so valuable to the Lions: he can cover. The game has changed. Even going back almost 10 years in the links I showed you the need for a quicker and smaller LB is there. Teams play in the nickel or dime all the time now. Having DB/LB like Troy means you can change the scheme without subbing personnel.   LeBeau was fired for multiple reasons, but not having OLBs who can cover was not one of them. Our OLBs are pass-rushers, not cover guys. You can't compare our OLBs to DeAndre Levy. He plays in an entirely different system. Detroit generates pressure from their defensive ends and their defensive tackles. That's the 4-3 line. In a 3-4 system, the pass-rush comes almost exclusively from the OLBs. The DEs and NTs consume blockers, and take care of their caps, they don't rush the passer a lot. For comparison, take a look at arguably the best interior pass-rusher in the league, Ndamukong Suh, and one of the best 3-4 NT in the past decade, Casey Hampton. Suh had 8.5 sacks last year. Hampton had 9 sacks in his entire career. Both are/were elite at their job. Both among the best at their positions. But their roles were completely different. OLBs in a 4-3 don't have to be pass-rushers, they have different responsibilities. If we play our OLBs like 4-3 OLBs, but still have a 3-4 DLine, we will undoubtedly and unquestionably have the worst defense in the league. You can't argue that coverage is more important than pass-rushing for OLBs in our system. It's like saying that you should go for a QB that can run well instead of passing well.   LeBeau is gone. There's a reason he was let go.   That aspect of the defense won't change. If you think we will stop looking at DEs to convert them to OLBs, you're mistaken. Look at the guys we are looking at in the draft. Eli Harold, Shane Ray, Vic Beasley, all are defensive ends in college. We want them as OLBs. We will never go for an elite coverage guy and use him at OLB. That is just now how our defensive scheme works. Others might work like that, but not ours. Look at Dion Jordan, or Manny Lawson. Great coverage prospects/players, terrible pass-rushers.   If anything, I think Butler will use the OLBs to blitz even more than LeBeau did. He was our LB coach, he'll use the OLBs as they're meant to be used. And that is as pass-rushers.    Except that has never happened when he's rushed from the outside. He goes around the slower lineman and if they put in an extra blocker he can physically beat them. Teams don't use a FB anymore and if we forced a team to do so, they're also playing with 10 guys.   When Polamalu rushes from the outside, he is doing so besides and OLB. Polamalu has never rushed as the OLB himself. Find a good play by Polamalu where he is rushing, and you'll see that an OLB is rushing right besides him. The OLB will ususally take the bulk of the blocking, not Polamalu. That's why Polamalu makes the play, and that's also why he won't succeed at OLB. He can't take and consume blockers.   Case in point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipFrOQfXyjI  Look at the angle of the play at 0:18. Harrison, as the ROLB, is taking not one, but two offensive linemen (LT and LG), and that leaves Polamalu untouched. If Polamalu were to play OLB, he would have been where Harrison is. The LG alone would probably have been able to take on Polamalu, who is not nearly as strong or powerful as Harrison is.   Which is why I pointed out there were LBs at 220 and LBs at 5'11"". He would need to gain 13 pounds to get to 220. I would much rather have a shorter, stouter RB than a guy who is tall and lanky. It's why most prototypical RBs are 220lbs and under 6' and not 220' of 6'+. You lose the ability to get under and the center of gravity. Teams want taller LBs to get hands on balls. Troy can do that. He does it, even at his height. It's not unrealistic for him to gain 13lbs (or more) and his height has worked. The players you've mentioned don't match up with the pass-catching TEs and quick slot WRs of today.   OLBs don't match up with slot receivers in our defense. TEs, sometimes. But there is no point in asking Polamalu to bulk up, he just can't succeed at the position. He has the size to play RB, WR, CB, but he doesn't have the skill set for any of those positions. The same applies to OLB. Size is one thing, skills are another, he has neither.   As for the size of RBs, true, most are small. But size is a definite advantage. Out of the top 10 rushers last year, 5 were over 220 lbs., 8 over 215 lbs. All of them except Justin Forsett were bigger than Polamalu.   As far as shifting them outside, the LOLB especially now isn't a pass-rushing position. Guys like DeAndre Levy are the prototype of the new LB - a guy who can stop the run and cover the pass. Teams are throwing more often and throwing quickly, often before you can even get there on the side a right-handed QB sees. Shazier has the speed and range to do that. Timmons has the experience and instinct.   Maybe in another scheme they aren't pass-rushing positions, but LOLB certainly is in ours. Again, DeAndre Levy plays in another system, it's pointless to compare him as an OLB to our OLBs. If he played OLB for us, he'd be terrible. We don't require OLBs who can cover and stuff the run, we need OLBs who can rush the passer. Timmons is just as good at his role as Levy is. We've started to go for speed at the positions, Shazier being a clear example, but there are still requirements and skillsets needed for each. I agree that LBs who can cover are more valuable right now, but not at OLB for our system. It's a waste to ask our OLBs to cover, it just weakens the pass rush. We need the opposite, we need the OLBs to pass-rush relentlessly. Let the ILBs and DBs do the covering."

steelers,2zzq8n,yeshua1986,3,Mon Mar 23 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   He is simply done at DB. He can't do it because he lacks the range and quickness. To cover at LB you don't need that. You need about as much as he has left.  1st level are the DL, 2nd level are the LBs, 3rd level are the DBs. 1st level is 5 yards deep, 2nd is 10 and 3rd is 20 up to the whole field. A LB has to handle the 1st and 2nd level, which is about 15 yards vertically and 1/3 to 1/4 of the field horizontally.  That's about how much range he has left. He needs the size - that's all."

steelers,2zzq8n,MattEven,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:42:36 2015 UTC,"Don't really agree with the something is better than dead money. We'd still have Woodley on the team if that sentiment were true. There's still a roster spot being taken. Sure, we could find a role if we looked hard enough, but you're still asking an older player to take on an entirely new role. One that still is going to take playing time away from a younger player.  Much as I love Troy, I don't want to see him try and eek out a year at linebacker. Especially as we have 3 very young MLBs with a lot of upside to them, and one MLB who is among the best in the game. Especially since Troy is going to take an absolute beating if he's asked to consistently take on lead blockers."
steelers,2zzq8n,MattEven,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"That's a great point. There is still potential value in him elsewhere if we have the vision to see it through. As I just said, he is going to cost us a fortune whether we keep him or cut him. If there's any football left in his body and he can do LB with his limited range, I'm willing to try it so we can avoid having to use precious resources on a new LB. Worilds really boned us."
steelers,2zzq8n,MattEven,3,Mon Mar 23 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"It's an idea at least worth discussion.  In the past, Troy has been very effective as a pass rusher.  His instinct is incredible around the line of scrimmage.  Also in the past, Whenever Troy moved up to blitz, it left our secondary exposed as there was no safety back to cover.  The past two seasons, this has been quite painful to watch.    In the past his pass rushing came in blitzes adding the element of surprise a bit; trying to determine where he was going.  I don't know how well he would do lining up at OLB every down.  Would they just pancake him and run all over our left side?  Would his agility and instinct be enough to overcome his lack of size at the position?    I think it could be done.  Not as a primary base defense alignment, but as a sub-package.  Because, as you said; Troy is matchup nightmare around the line of scrimmage.  As long as there is a safety over the top to do ""safety"" things while Troy is being Troy, it might actually work."

steelers,300574,Vincent__Vega,2,Mon Mar 23 14:22:46 2015 UTC,"Steelers can still cut him now with a ~ 6 million in savings by designating the cut post June 1. Nothing is stopping us at the moment.

steelers,300574,heavymedicine,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"Keeping him on the roster isn't really the problem, though I think most will agree he shouldn't be the starter any more.  It's the relative lack of production vs. the cap space of his contract.  If he stays as a backup, he has to take a pay-cut.  You can't have your backups being paid more than your starters.  So, the big question is, would Troy be OK with being a backup?  Would he be OK with taking an Ike Taylor style pay-cut to do so?"

steelers,30069t,lysergicd0886,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:33:23 2015 UTC,I like Owa as a LDE in a 43 or even a LOLB in a Courtney Upshaw type role but the guy is just not a good pass rusher. The article mentions this fact but I feel it's being glossed over how limited Owa is when it comes to getting after the QB. His tight hips and total lack of lateral quickness as well as his comparatively low top speed make it seem doubtful that he'll ever develop into anything more than a 3-5 sack a year guy which is fine if the Steelers are no longer planning on their strong side OLB getting after the QB (both Tuitt and Heyward are good pass rushers from the DE position) but that'd be a fairly big departure from what they've traditionally done.  Yeah a guy like Eli Harold might need to get stronger before he can hold up against the run but as a pass rusher he's ready to come in and make an impact from the get go and if used in a rotation with Harrison and/or Moats he could contribute right away and develop into a great player for the Steelers. I'd rather have Marcus Peters at #22 but i'd be less opposed to Harold than I would anyone else as of right now.
steelers,30069t,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:05:54 2015 UTC,All very fair points. I would say that if Jones comes back healthy and plays the way he was starting before his injury last year we don't need the LOLB to be a great rusher. It would certainly be an interesting dynamic.   I'd also like to point out that I think 22 would be a bit too high. Depending how the draft plays out we could trade down (maybe the Saints try to move up a bit with the second first rounder they have to pick a guy they like) and pick up someone like Harold or Kevin Johnson out of Wake.
steelers,30069t,ltownsoccer11,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"Peters is who I really want too, but I'm not sure if he's on the Steelers board at all.

steelers,2zwjkz,Button_3,10,Sun Mar 22 14:17:12 2015 UTC,"A big part of it was poor play, but another big part (granted not as big, but big nonetheless) is that he was just unlucky. Will Gay was biting on routes just as hard as Allen was, Gay was just lucky that they weren't double-moves as frequently as they were for Allen. With both CBs doing it that frequently, that's on the coaching more than the player.  And that said, we've seen benched players come back from worse. Ike Taylor himself is a solid example, benched in 2006 and came back to play extremely well between then and 2013, especially the 2011 and 2012 seasons."
steelers,2zwjkz,Steinerway,7,Sun Mar 22 14:29:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Gay was super lucky last year. He's a solid corner and doesn't get burned much.
steelers,2zwjkz,huet99,3,Sun Mar 22 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that he really did have a good year last year, but I think if anything that proves OP's point.  There were numerous years in the past when Gay was nothing but a liability for us in the secondary.  Every time he came on the field you knew there was a good chance he'd get targeted and blow the coverage.  Then all of a sudden he steps up his game for us and becomes a pretty solid starter.  I see no reason that Cortez can't do the same."
steelers,2zwjkz,PropositionJoe_,3,Sun Mar 22 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"Well I really wouldn't say it was ""all of a sudden."" He's good in a small, limited role in 2007-2008 so I wouldn't really count that given how rarely he played behind Ike, Townsend and McFadden. He's the starter in 2009, absolutely atrocious. Nickel in 2010, pretty bad there too. Then Ray Horton, the DB coach at the time, leaves to be defensive coordinator in Pittsburgh West (Arizona) and Carnell Lake comes in. THAT was the turnaround with Gay. He's very good in 2011, as is Ike Taylor (I believe his opponent's completion percentage was second best behind only Darrelle Revis that year) and it was the first time Keenan Lewis didn't spend the preseason, and thus regular season, in Tomlin's doghouse.  Then in 2012, Gay makes a terrible career move and signs a two year deal to rejoin Ray Horton in Arizona. He's awful there, gets cut after a year. Comes back to the real Pittsburgh and rejoins Carnell Lake in 2013...and we know the rest.  So to review  2009-2010, 2012 with Ray Horton: Terrible. Liability. One of the worst DBs in the league.  2011, 2013-present with Carnell Lake: Very good, extremely valuable, ""rising star.""  I'm sensing a pattern here. I know in earlier posts in this thread and others I blame the coaching for Cortez's problems last year so I hope this doesn't sound like too much of a contradiction, but in 2011 and 2012 Lake made the cornerbacks absolutely dominant. No coincidence we had the top pass defense, and top overall defense, both those years with little to no pass rush. Then 2013, Ryan Clark completely shat the bed and made inexcusable rookie mistakes at age 34. And then last year, for whatever reason the CBs began biting on simple double-moves.  But I digress. For Cortez, hope that Lake finds the magic he had in 2011-2012. I'll never forget Cortez as a rookie shutting down Gronk in the year he shattered all those TE records. No reason why Allen can't become that player again."
steelers,2zwjkz,Steinerway,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:47:52 2015 UTC,Agreed with everything you said. Cortez was also one of the few high points of the Jaguars game last season as well.

steelers,2zwjkz,BobbyD84,2,Mon Mar 23 06:50:03 2015 UTC,Plus he turned into a bit of a pick 6 hawk last year. His move up the depth chart did him some good.
steelers,2zwjkz,Steinerway,0,Sun Mar 22 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"That wasn't a slight on Gay, it was in defense of Cortez. Gay's been great whenever he plays with Carnell Lake.  That said, Gay got pretty damn lucky. Go re-watch the Colts game. Gay and Cortez play their opposing receiver the same exact way. As soon as the receiver twitches, they jump the route. Gay was lucky that Hakeem Nicks really was running a simple curl route, so the ball was right there for Gay to pick off and take to the house. Later in that same quarter, Cortez goes to jump the route the same exact way Gay did on the previous drive. Problem was TY Hilton was running an in and up, and Cortez got burned. If Hilton was running a simple dig, them Cortez very well could have picked it off. A good example of when it worked against Gay is the end of the half against Tennessee, the big 80 yard touchdown to Nate Washington.  Gay was very good last year, don't get me wrong. I just wasn't impressed by that particular pick six. More about luck (no pun intended) than anticipation."
steelers,2zwjkz,PSFanInNC,2,Sun Mar 22 23:37:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I'm trying to say, and what I think Allen can do in the upcoming season/next couple years"
steelers,2zwjkz,tlow0510,3,Sun Mar 22 14:33:14 2015 UTC,"Given his recent contract extension, I think keeping him on the roster and hoping he somehow pans out is probably the least damaging option at this point. Perhaps he won't look as bad if they can finally start getting better coverage support from the safeties.   That said, I am hugely concerned that they will be going into next season likely having to rely on him for anything. They haven't picked up a CB in free agency....and that's fine....but they're obviously dangerously thin at the position and I think it's a HUGE leap of faith to think they're going to find a corner in this draft class that's ready to step in immediately and contribute."
steelers,2zwjkz,tlow0510,3,Sun Mar 22 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"I think if we get a pass rusher (fingers crossed for Bud Dupree) in the first round and get a good CB in the second round we will be just fine. If Jarvis Jones (who I think is going to have a Pro Bowl season this year) and Bud Dupree, as well as Moats were on the edges, with Timmons/Williams/Shazier/Spence/Shawn Lemon (that NOONE is talking about) perform in rotating packages, QBs hopefully wont have any time to throw, helping out our secondary TREMENDOUSLY. Im going to go ahead and write off James Harrison, simply because I believe hes going to go to the Titans for his profound love for Coach Dad. I have faith in Shamarko, hes been patiently observing under Troy for three years now and he was a MONSTER in college. Mike Mitchell has to perform up to par this year. He cant say that he played through a groin injury as season as an excuse this year.  Edit: James Harrison signs a 2 year deal. Wrong per usual on my end."
steelers,2zwjkz,Moses-SandyKoufax,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:43:29 2015 UTC,Way better linebackers available than bud Dupree. That guy has bust written all over him. What was he even good at in college ?  Underwhelming numbers against underwhelming opponents.  Has size but unproven skill set.  I feel like trading up for linebackers from florida or Clemson could be worth it.  Or just take the bad attitude corner from Washington. Guy must be good for people to put up with his crap.
steelers,2zwjkz,BobbyD84,1 point,Mon Mar 23 06:52:50 2015 UTC,"You seem really really uneducated. First of all, Dante Fowler or ""that lb from florida"" as you'd put him is projected to go top 3. Vic Beasley and Shane Ray, the other two OLB prospects for us, dont really fit with our system and they're going to go top 10 most likely, making it impossible for us to get unless, yes you said it, we trade up. But when is the last time the Steelers have traded up? We arent a brash decision organization. Bud Dupree had a great pro day and combine. Its already been widely discussed that the Steelers have the most interest in him out of all the OLB prospects. and as for your ""attitude corner from washington"", if you did any research you would know that Kevin Johnson out of Wake Forest is a no-brainer as far as CB goes."
steelers,2zwjkz,Tall_lankybaldguy,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:59:43 2015 UTC,"I know the answer to your question!  Last time the Steelers traded up was to get Santonio Holmes and that ended up being exactly what was needed to win another super bowl.  When a team needs one or two specific pieces, I wouldn't call it a brash decision to trade up a few spots to get someone who has a little bit better resume other than a 'good pro day'.  Wake Forest cb has decent size, 6', but corners tend to be high risk for early rounds, i.e., a lot of busts and elite corners can be smartly drafted in later rounds."
steelers,2zwjkz,Jerseystation,3,Mon Mar 23 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's a confidence issue. He needs to fix his head. He's still super athletic and talented, all mental."
steelers,2zwjkz,OldWoodenFap,2,Sun Mar 22 16:43:50 2015 UTC,No reason to quit on him without giving him another shot to prove he can play. They have a lot of money invested in him. Let's hope he earns it this year.
steelers,2zwjkz,TyroneBiggums93,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"I think the potential is there.  Ike Taylor was benched for a time as well and he said it helped him develop as a player. I hope Allen responds similarly. He does have good size and speed so if he can improve the finer details, I think he will start again."
steelers,2zwjkz,86n96,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:00:31 2015 UTC,I agree with that he still have potnetial ..just no people get it out
steelers,2zyz9x,hstisalive,6,Mon Mar 23 02:38:20 2015 UTC,I've heard that he's a liability in coverage
steelers,2zyz9x,PDwasHere,12,Mon Mar 23 02:39:13 2015 UTC,Which means he'd fit right in
steelers,2zyz9x,volvanator,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:32:04 2015 UTC,I just read that too. I have to do more research but the Steelers really need a DB. Landon stood out to me because of his physicality but that coverage thing scares me alot.
steelers,2zyz9x,ColdNose,8,Mon Mar 23 02:41:58 2015 UTC,We already have a landon collins on the team. His name is mike mitchell. Steelers do need a DB but there's no 1st round free safety. Much more talent at the corner position.
steelers,2zyz9x,ColdNose,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:56:33 2015 UTC,I'm so disappointed with Mike Mitchell. I hope he gets better this year.
steelers,2zyz9x,deverhartdu,1 point,Mon Mar 23 05:20:27 2015 UTC,He should be.  Last season was his first year in the system and apparently he played almost all season with a groin injury.
steelers,2zyz9x,Goldeneagle17,3,Mon Mar 23 05:37:07 2015 UTC,And not at his natural position
steelers,2zyz9x,garglemymarbles,4,Mon Mar 23 10:31:51 2015 UTC,"I would not want him as our first pick, we need a safety who has range and doesn't get burnt over the middle by elite wide receivers all year."
steelers,2zyz9x,SleestakLightning,3,Mon Mar 23 05:40:50 2015 UTC,I heard this guy can't cover for shit.
steelers,2zvcjs,a_drunken_monkey,11,Sun Mar 22 03:06:30 2015 UTC,i dont know relatively but im pretty positive about him. i know there are those who say hes more a throwback a bit out of time in the modern league with his skillset. but id rather the league change back so... yeah...
steelers,2zvcjs,SicaBiasThrowaway,7,Sun Mar 22 04:04:52 2015 UTC,He's definitely more of a thumper which is part of the reason I like him but he also seemed to be a bit better in coverage this year. I feel like he's great depth who can start (or share snaps with Spence) if there's a catastrophic injury to Timmons
steelers,2zvcjs,yenney92,2,Sun Mar 22 04:34:53 2015 UTC,Spence should never get snaps over Williams... Williams is the second best middle linebacker on the team as of now. Spence is a decent player who needs to be the fourth middle linebacker on the depth chart
steelers,2zvcjs,King0fTheImpossible,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"How do you like Shazier coming into the season, think he has a shot to compete for Williams spot?"
steelers,2zvcjs,yenney92,2,Sun Mar 22 16:45:08 2015 UTC,I feel it is already his spot. He needs to stay healthy to keep it though
steelers,2zvcjs,Azrael412,2,Sun Mar 22 18:03:27 2015 UTC,After his injury last year he lost playing time to both Williams and Spence.
steelers,2zvcjs,yenney92,2,Sun Mar 22 23:06:40 2015 UTC,I know that... The coaches are just Hugh on his speed
steelers,2zvcjs,yenney92,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:27:05 2015 UTC,"Fully agree with you, unfortunately they didn't feel the same way this past year. Let's hope for Williams to fully pass him on the depth chart this year"
steelers,2zvcjs,slivr33,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:09:19 2015 UTC,I agree with this entirely... Unless Shazier developes a ridiculous amount Williams should start
steelers,2zvcjs,SicaBiasThrowaway,-3,Sun Mar 22 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"He was kept in in pass plays, either the coaches overestimated him or you underestimate him. I'm going to side with the coaches for now, as they have the inside info."
steelers,2zvcjs,slivr33,5,Sun Mar 22 06:29:30 2015 UTC,huh? i was trying to say i like him. what did i end up saying?
steelers,2zvcjs,SicaBiasThrowaway,-1,Sun Mar 22 06:36:55 2015 UTC,"You did but you also were implying that he might not be meant for the modern game (because it's becoming a pass-heavy, fast paced game etc.).  However, he's shown more dynamic ability than a lot think."
steelers,2zvcjs,SicaBiasThrowaway,2,Sun Mar 22 06:41:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair the coaches put him in when we went nickle because he's such a great run stopper. They thought he would strengthen the run defense in a scheme that's purpose is to defend the pass, his coverage was much better (from the little film I watched this year) this year compared to last though"
steelers,2zvcjs,MattHoppe1,3,Sun Mar 22 06:59:46 2015 UTC,thank you for making sense. im not at this point haha... frustrating day
steelers,2zvcjs,NapoleonBlownapart87,3,Sun Mar 22 07:06:10 2015 UTC,"No prob, it is pretty late"
steelers,2zvcjs,Kofile,2,Sun Mar 22 08:10:15 2015 UTC,"thats the traditional knock on him, yes. personally early on i rejected the notion there was anything wrong with him. i was a bit slow accepting that ilbs werent necessarily best thumpers any more. i dont really think thats all he is, not by a long shot. but i do accept that he isnt do it all. and is best used in certain roles and certain ways. but thats pretty much the same as every player when you build a defense. at least i sort of accept it. defense is all subpackages and mismatches and there really isnt a starting 11 the same way perhaps it once was. im tired and not making sense. football has changed but football is still football and in general football players tend to be a bit better at playing this football than a lot of their draft projections seem to indicate. because football. hes not going to be used to cover gronk most likely but he has a particular set of skills honestly i wish was more common on the steelers and in the league in general. hes seems to be a really good worker and isnt inept in coverage. just a lot of times he isnt, and is probably not best utilized in that regards given some of the other tools in our toolbox... im running out of cliches... honestly i like all 4 of our main ilbs and wish we could play them all more. im fond of spences story and williams the player and a bit the guy too. im all for him being used to add some buld to our nickel and other sub packages to help fortify the run in more passing formations. I honestly would love if he could start in base and more formations as well. then again if shazier develops thats 4 players i want starting at ilbs and even in our 1 downlineman ameoba thingies thats a bit hard to pull off"
steelers,2zvcjs,NapoleonBlownapart87,4,Sun Mar 22 07:05:06 2015 UTC,Hardest hitter on the team
steelers,2zvcjs,Kofile,5,Sun Mar 22 07:29:26 2015 UTC,I love his attitude
steelers,2zvcjs,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"His tweets really show this...  ""Competition is a fierce polygraph. Showing you truly what you are willing to do or go through to be the better man.""  They read like Joyce or Thoreau."
steelers,2zvcjs,Diarygirl,3,Sun Mar 22 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"He's solid but I don't think he's anything to write home about. His potential ceiling is way lower than Shazier so, I hate to say it, but I hope Williams never sees the field other than ST"
steelers,2zvcjs,mattdell89,2,Sun Mar 22 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"You know that Williams got significant playing time last year at ILB, right? Even in a ""platoon role"", he still was a significant contributer.  And yes, you're correct that on paper Shazier should be clearly better than Williams.  Thing there is is that Williams actualy played all 16 games last season, compared to Shazier's 9. And even though we want Shazier to be Pittsburgh's next mainstay at ILB (like Farrior), Williams has more than earned the playing time he's gotten so far - even though some of that was due to Shazier's injury."
steelers,2zvcjs,tlow0510,3,Sun Mar 22 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"Everything you said has absolutely no bearing on what I said. I don't think any of it is wrong, it's just immaterial."
steelers,2zvcjs,Tall_lankybaldguy,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"How is it immaterial? We agree on certain aspects of what you said, but you're over-playing Shazier's average at best play in a injury-plagued rookie campaign.   Could Williams be upgraded? Yeah.   Is he a bad option that is a glaring liability on the defense? Not at all.  After Williams' rookie season I could see how I would have the ""burn it with fire mentality"" mentality and I would somewhat agree with you.   I'm not saying you do, but a lot of people on this sub are paying more attention to Shazier's draft position and potential instead of  what he's actually shown on the field and his injury problems."
steelers,2zvcjs,yenney92,3,Sun Mar 22 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's immaterial because I think we are talking about two different things. While your talking about Williams I am (ostensibly) talking about Shazier. As I said I think he's solid; he's a fairly pedestrian player as far as I'm concerned. I think Shazier has the athleticism to be really special so I said that I would hope that we don't see much of Williams because it would likely mean Shazier is fulfilling his potential.   This is kind of my fault because I diverted to talking about Shazier in the first place. The only reason I said it was immaterial is because, while I agree with 90% of what you've said in your two comments, they don't necessarily mean what I'm saying is incorrect either."
steelers,2zvcjs,Saintzillla,6,Sun Mar 22 18:58:13 2015 UTC,Watch out. u/Diarygirl isn't high on pot jokes.
steelers,2zvcjs,Kofile,2,Sun Mar 22 03:39:22 2015 UTC,Ha!  Only when you're talking about Mr. Bell.
steelers,2zvcjs,tlow0510,2,Sun Mar 22 22:30:05 2015 UTC,Um yes he should have been starting all season. Sean Spence just doesn't have the size to cut it. He misses too many tackles
steelers,2zvcjs,Kofile,1 point,Sun Mar 22 09:22:34 2015 UTC,"Spence is pretty darn lousy and Williams should have had more playing time.  To add to what you mentioned above already, Spence missed tackles and was almost always out of position."
steelers,2zvcjs,Kofile,2,Sun Mar 22 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"I do like Williams and I was impressed he impacted thr team on lots of plays as a rookie and 2nd year guy. He is underrated, in my opinion. Or, as Tomlin would say, ""his arrow is pointing up"".   We are stacked at ILB. Williams, Timmons, Shazier, Spence, and Zumwalt. I wonder if the Steelers considered offering one of these guys up for trade to an ILB-needy team (49ers come to mind). I dont want to lose any of them but we cannot play them all and we need depth elsewhere or draft picks. If we dont trade one of them, I think we won't re-sign one when his contract ends, at which point we will be lucky to get a compensatory draft selection."

steelers,2ztxjw,CeeBeast,8,Sat Mar 21 20:29:58 2015 UTC,"Yea, he left Dick LeBeau, played in a different scheme, and did poorly. Leaving for Tennessee wouldn't be the same as leaving for Cinci."
steelers,2ztxjw,Kmaster224,2,Sat Mar 21 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"That's true.  He left the defense he knew how to play.  And I can't see our defense scheme changing too much next year, or even the few after.  But Tennessee, that is completely different."

steelers,2ztxjw,CeeBeast,3,Sun Mar 22 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"He is an assistant head coach, and he helps with defense. Ray Horton is the DC, but he's played or coached under LeBeau for ~20 years, and you could see elements of LeBeau's defense in Horton's defenses over the years.

steelers,2ztxjw,Bigmattn,4,Sun Mar 22 03:44:59 2015 UTC,You can't deny that the defense picked up after we got him. I'd say he has one more year in his tank for the Steelers. Beyond that I can't say.
steelers,2ztxjw,DeadHeadAhead,2,Sun Mar 22 03:49:17 2015 UTC,Last year we gave James another shot (revitalizing his stalled career) and he stated that he would only play in Pittsburgh to be near his kids. Now he talks about going to Tenn because of Lebeau. This flip-flopping is a joke. I would a lot of respect for the man if he were to go because of this.
steelers,2ztxjw,Rorbotron,3,Sun Mar 22 14:22:45 2015 UTC,I feel like he has to know going to the titans messes with his legacy a little.  I think if the steelers offer him a contract and the titans do as well he's staying in Pittsburgh. Edit: although he did already give the bungles a go.  Either way we need him in Pittsburgh.
steelers,2ztxjw,NotJoeyWheeler,14,Sat Mar 21 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it really messes with his legacy at all, he's been on the Bengals for a year, spent time with the Ravens, and we cut him a few times iirc.

What does he actually offer that isn't covered by other players at other positions?  For the short passing game/ YAC / Screens = bell, the top-3 WRs have that covered.  He's ineffective as a pass blocker - and a downright liability. Bell has proven - and even Williams has experience - being a effective pass protector.  He's too small to play RB, and didn't make any splash plays in the RS - and was downright embarrassing in the Raven playoff game.   I wouldn't have been pissed with the pick If it was made later on in the draft.. They're just lucky they got Marty in the 4th. VERY fucking lucky.   As for the rest of the article?   Thomas hasn't gotten enough playing time to see his true value.   ILB is luckily one of the deepest positions on the team.. ILBs were at least serviceable with Shazier out.  Allen has all of the talent in the world - I think he'll come around. He has to.   Bryant should be starting next year. Then again, the offense needs to move away from a lot of 2 TE sets and move towards 3WR/1TE1RB being the base offense.   Even as it stands RIGHT NOW, the offense has too much talent on offense to not have 10,11, and 84 on the field as much as possible.   And with the possible drafting of a RB, TE, and WR later in the draft, the issue will be even more prevalent.   Big/Jumbo sets need to be used,but not to the extent that they have been. Especially with the development of 10 and 26 - not to mention the entire offense as a whole"

These players all have huge potential, and for the most part, haven't gotten a chance to truly make an impact.

steelers,2zv4zh,-deteled-,11,Sun Mar 22 01:49:12 2015 UTC,Unless multiple ILBs on the roster not named Lawrence Timmons suddenly become Pro Bowlers over night then there's about a zero percent chance that the team even considers cutting Timmons. Depth does not justify cutting an elite player who at this point is arguably the most important player on the defense. This is a team that lately has been notorious for not cutting veterans and if they're willing to hang on to guys who aren't producing then you can sure as hell bet they won't dump a guy who is regardless of what he's making.  Besides the Steelers will be free of Woodley's contract next season and far enough under the cap that they won't need to worry about cutting good players anyways.
steelers,2zv4zh,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:58:45 2015 UTC,Kind of my thought process too. If Spence and shazier both look like starters then trade them and get something out of it.   I mean with this logic why not just cut Brown next year being that we have a couple young talented wide receivers on the team
steelers,2zv4zh,k__e__n,2,Sun Mar 22 02:16:28 2015 UTC,The keys are Shazier and Williams (or another young Buck). Spence and Shazier both play the Mack.
steelers,2zv4zh,autopilot_music,11,Sun Mar 22 15:49:00 2015 UTC,"I think an extention will be made. With the rising cap and finally getting out from our mid-decade extensions, I see no reason to cut him."

steelers,2zv4zh,Bonowski,1 point,Sun Mar 22 08:31:37 2015 UTC,"Typical offseason article, in my opinion.  They're just trying to generate news out of nothing."
steelers,2zv4zh,k__e__n,5,Mon Mar 23 01:23:30 2015 UTC,"It may not be so insane. There is history suggesting that the Steelers may do it as well. The Steelers cut a then 29 year old Joey Porter after the 2006 season because they had a relative unknown named James Harrison ready to step in and take over the ROLB spot.  Here's the current personnel breakdown at ILB:    Buck Mack    L. Timmons R. Shazier   V. Williams S. Spence    T. Garvin    Timmons was the Mack up until last season with Farrior, Williams, or Foote playing the Buck. He moved to the Buck to get Shazier, whose speed would be totally wasted at the Buck, on the field. This relegated Williams - who looked quite good when he was on the field last year - to the bench. Spence played often when Shazier was hurt. Personally, I think Timmons' talents are wasted at the Buck and I think he's paid too much to not be the dynamic ILB flying all over the place. Also, at 29 I imagine that Timmons is going to be looking for a 4-5 year deal. That takes you into Troy/Ike/Farrior/Hines territory with the age/decline factor and as the team and its fans have found out, it's a bitch to see those old stars decline into a sad shell of their former selves. And let's be real here, Timmons isn't going to play for peanuts.  So given the personnel, I think the question(s) that Kevin Colbert has to answer are:    Is Shazier the dynamic ILB that is all over the field making plays like Timmons does/did? Can Vince Williams be a solid Buck in the mold of Larry Foote and take on blockers allowing Shazier to fill? Is giving Timmons an extension or keeping him for 2016 going to limit my ability to sign Tuitt, Heyward, Shazier, etc... if/when I want to (we don't want more Keenan Lewis scenarios).   If the answer to each of those questions is yes, I think it'd be unwise to extend Timmons. If the answer to #3 is yes, regardless of the answers to #1 and #2 I think you avoid extension and consider the cut after 2015. If the answer to all 4 questions is no, then sure, extend him. Just be prepared for the inevitable decline."
steelers,2zv4zh,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Mar 22 15:48:28 2015 UTC,"Not gonna happen. They have very good depth at ILB but outside of Timmons none of their guys are proven starters.  He can play OLB in an emergency (and do it at a high level), he's still young, and he was Tomlin's first pick. He'll be extended."
steelers,2zv4zh,MattEven,2,Sun Mar 22 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"There's a lot I don't like about this article. But one sentence really sticks out at me:    irst, Timmons' cap hit soars in 2016 to $11.8 million dollars ...   http://overthecap.com/player/lawrence-timmons/1618/  According to OTC, which I assume is correct, his cap his soared to $11.8 mil in 2014. In 2015 it goes up to $12.5 mil. Next year, 2016 it goes DOWN to $11.8 mil.   Now I'm no mathematician, but it seems like if we were going to cut him it would have been done already, before the season he is paid the most. Also, I'm no cap expert, but I think Timmons is worth the  $11.8-12.5 mil he's due.   This isn't taking into account the depth behind him or anything like that, but from a numbers standpoint this article doesn't make any sense."
steelers,2zv4zh,PSFanInNC,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:54:47 2015 UTC,If he is still playing at a high level next year Colbert and Co. will restructure his contract so it isn't that big of a hit. This article is fucking stupid.
steelers,2zv4zh,Intropy_,1 point,Sun Mar 22 13:34:08 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's possible but, absent a major injury to him and/or one of these other ILBs suddenly stepping up in major, major way, I think it's highly unlikely.   The cap hit is big, but not outlandishly so for a player of his caliber, and Timmons is really just hitting his prime IMO.   Certainly, they may look to find a way to re-work it, but I'd be shocked if they cut a guy thats really the backbone of their defense."
steelers,2zv4zh,k__e__n,0,Sun Mar 22 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of that big cap hit is untouchable since it's already been spent. When considering a cut only the money not already paid to the player matters. His cap hit could be 40 million, but if 38 million of that is from restructured cutting him still only saves you 2 million."
steelers,2zvhur,huet99,3,Sun Mar 22 04:04:13 2015 UTC,"He was a loss last season when he should've been signed from the getgo. Instead he was signed mid-season and still outperformed guys/produced in spurts.  Just thinking of what could've been if he had had his legs because he was in shape and ready for the season from the beginning.   Signing a guy who can produce for a vet minimum is exactly what you want as an organization against the cap.  I'll reserve my decision until after the draft though, because if we add another OLB that would certainly change things.  Moats and Harrison are very different players, Moats is more dynamic, where Harrison is more effective with his strengths."
steelers,2zvhur,slivr33,2,Sun Mar 22 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"I mean he's definitely not what he used to be and definitely shouldn't be counted on as a full-time starter.  But we almost NEED him on the roster purely from a depth perspective.  Our current pencilled in ""starters"" were both backups most of last year and our ""backups"" are practice squad players with zero experience.  That's a terrible depth situation at one of our most important positions, and even if we draft 7 olbs this year we need someone else at the position with some experience we can count on."

I'll be shocked if both don't go top 40. Difference is Owa isn't a great pass rushing prospect and projects much better at LDE in 43 while Harold is a straight up OLB who fits best in a 34.  I see Owa being a really good run stopper as a DE but his lack of quickness in space and lack of pass rushing skills make him a poor fit for the Steelers."

steelers,2zq0mb,badbloodcatch,10,Fri Mar 20 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"Nice break down and I agree with most of what you said.  I will say that Amari Cooper made a lot of good players look bad last season and that was easily Collins worst game. I believe that while Collins is likely too raw to start immediately he isn't an insanely raw CB prospect in comparison with some other guys. To me a lot of his issues (seeming stiff, inconsistent tracking the ball) would be mitigated in a zone defense and a lot of his strengths (speed, insticts, burst) would be emphasized.  Collins is probably a year away from being a real contributor on defense but aside from a small handful of players there really aren't a lot of corners who are ready to make an impact day one. He's not my favorite prospect but I wouldn't be strongly opposed to taking him at #22 because while there are options I like more his upside and the fact that he's a good fit for the Steelers defense make me hopeful that he'd justify being a 1st round pick."

I would be curious at what you would think he would compare to him, as I see them as the two similar raw prospects right now. But, I think Quintin Rollins could be had in the second (smaller school, and shorter), with a similar value. If you could have Collins in the first, or Rollins in the second, which one would you go for?"
steelers,2zq0mb,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Sat Mar 21 12:13:03 2015 UTC,I like some of his physical attributes but he's way more raw than Collins. While Collins is a bit rough around the edges Rollins is rough all over and in my opinion he's one of the biggest project players in the draft. I don't like spending high picks on project players unless there's no other decent option available. Collins also flat out looks faster in game based on what I've seen and his burst and size make him very appealing from a physical standpoint.  I'd much rather have Collins and there's a couple corners I'd take over Rollins in the 2nd.
steelers,2zq0mb,cmfletcher,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"I prefer Rollins but at the safety spot! Also Ifo Expre-Olomu might be around in the third even.

Both Rollins and Collins rely on their athletic ability, its who the steelers see as the guy that can translate to the NFL better and can learn the right technique. If Collins is there in the 2nd, I would take him over Rollins!"

steelers,2zpxxv,iCryKarma,11,Fri Mar 20 17:32:22 2015 UTC,Honest opinion time:  I still feel that Holmes was thrown under the bus to make an example for the team.  Remember that this all happened during the same offseason that Ben himself got into trouble with rape allegations.  The Rooney's were not in a good mood and they tossed the only troublemaker who was actually expendable from the roster.  Did Holmes screw up?  Definitely.  Apparently on multiple occasions but I just don't buy it that I should somehow view him any more negatively than some of the stuff that Harrison (alleged domestic violence) and Ben (alleged rape) seem to be given passes on even if nothing legally came of them - which has generally been the same for Holmes.
steelers,2zpxxv,Drakengard,2,Sat Mar 21 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really don't know why most people are holding double standards. No one says, ""Man, Big Ben is such a poor example.

steelers,2zod11,PomfAndCircvmstance,6,Fri Mar 20 06:58:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like the biggest issue with the team's red zone offense last season wasn't lack of a big target but an infatuation with throwing the ball down near the goal line while having a top 5 RB on the roster.  Last season the Cowboys were 2nd in red zone TD percentage while the Steelers were 19th. The Steelers threw the ball twice as often as they ran it with Bell while Dallas actually ran it more often than they threw it. The result was that Demarco Murray scored 12 red zone TDs, as opposed to the 6 Bell scored, while Romo threw 19 TDs, as opposed to the 20 Roethlisberger did. If the Steelers don't fall in love with throwing the ball down near the end zone and actually take advantage of having an elite RB and a solid run blocking O-line i'd expect their scoring efficiency to go up even if Roethlisberger's TD numbers very slightly decline."
steelers,2zod11,autopilot_music,2,Fri Mar 20 17:51:24 2015 UTC,"I feel that the problem with our run game is it requires a balance to succeed. What I mean by this is there has to be a threat of a short, quick pass to keep the defense from crowding the box. Bell is a great space runner, he finds holes that appear too small and explodes through them. That's great when we're on, say, the 40. But not so great from the <5. It seems like it should be easy to gain those 5 yards, but Bell is not a power back. Bell thrives in plays like the sweep or the counter trap, something that gives a bit of space he can exploit but not so great when trying to pound it in. So Haley tries to manufacture an honest defense by throwing quick bubble screens or HB screens or short in routes, but those don't work well on the goalline either due to the extra DB's that don't have to protect against our YAC routes or deep throws. So now we have 2 parts of our offense, that sort of rely on each other to succeed, that don't really work at all because of the lack of space in the RZ. Development on the line ought to improve things a bit, as should bringing in a guy like Williams, who IIRC is more of a straight line runner (which may be the same misconception many made with Blount, I dunno  since I never really watch Carolina games)."
steelers,2zod11,steelbydesign,3,Sat Mar 21 07:11:28 2015 UTC,"Haley's been harping on RZ offense a lot this off-season...  For all that hate this guy gets he's done a lot right in my opinion. He's come in an installed a stellar run game and more importantly protected the franchise (Ben).   Now the biggest weakness in the offense is punching it in, in the redzone, which he wants to focus on. I could see another big target being added in this draft (Jesse James maybe)?"
steelers,2zod11,Steinerway,2,Fri Mar 20 13:02:19 2015 UTC,"So...are we past the point of evaluating Haley by tabloid headlines and whether or Ben likes him and instead evaluating him on the offense's production before Ben broke his collarbone in 2012, the production once the OL gelled around the street free agent center who was signed after the 2013 season started, and last year?  Heath hasn't been the same since his torn ACL. Last year he was a bit better than 2013 since he had had more time to rehab, but it's obviously time to start looking for his replacement. Bryant needs to keep working too, last year he was obviously used to college where let alone towering over opposing DBs, those DBs didn't have the anticipation to challenge RZ fade routes. Goes without saying that in the NFL, all of them will be challenged. Bryant needs to practice jumping, boxing out the DB, actually fighting for every pass thrown his way. Especially in the endzone."

I am. I like Coach Haley and am quite happy The Rooney Family, et al., extended his contract. If he doesn't take a HC position, I hope he stays in Pittsburgh for a long time.  Long enough to get his bubble screens working."
steelers,2zod11,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Mar 22 00:05:01 2015 UTC,"The offense needs to become more efficient punching it in. Mountains of rushing and passing yards are fine, but if you're not punching the ball into the endzone it's for nought.   9/17 games the offense scored less that 20 points - there is definitely room for improvement."
steelers,2zod11,huet99,2,Sat Mar 21 18:03:20 2015 UTC,"Could that ""article"" have been any less insightful?  If my top 5 OLB and Marcus Peters aren't on the board when the Steelers draft then I want them to take either La'el Collins or Maxx Williams.   Maxx will help with the red zone issues."
steelers,2zod11,SleestakLightning,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:50:53 2015 UTC,The last of our problems is the offense. We need to draft a pass rusher or a playmaking DB.

Where the Steelers pick, you don't want to take a pass rusher or a CB just to take one. That will result in them taking someone like Eli Harold who sucks.  NEVER reach. Always go BPA, even if it means picking a position you don't ""need."" And I would argue Collins and Williams both fill needs anyway."
steelers,2zod11,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:48:06 2015 UTC,"That's what trading down is for. If no player available suits your needs that you couldn't get later, trade down and get extra picks. No need to waste a high pick on a position which isn't absolutely necessary."
steelers,2zod11,huet99,0,Sun Mar 22 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"1.) Assuming someone is willing to trade down.  2.) O-line and TE are absolutely necessary.  3.) If you take the BPA, the theory is the pick will never be wasted.  The Steelers can get good pass rushers and CBs that fit their system in rounds 2-5. Round One should be BPA."
steelers,2zod11,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Mar 22 23:02:47 2015 UTC,What is wrong with our O line? And our offense can make it by with Heath Miller for another year.. not urgent. Need I remind you we have a couple of talented offensive players?
steelers,2zod11,huet99,-1,Mon Mar 23 01:58:19 2015 UTC,"The O-line got it's ass kicked in the playoff game against Baltimore. La'el Collins could come in and upgrade RT or LG immediately.   Sure the offense can get by with Heath but Maxx Williams gives them a dynamic they've never had before.  Reaching and drafting a player just because he plays a certain position more often than not leads to a player busting. They did it with Jarvis Jones and he's shown little even when healthy.  I'm not advocating drafting a lineman or a TE if there's a good OLB on the board. But if the choice comes down to Collins, Williams, a 2nd tier OLB, or trading down...the best option is taking Collins or Williams who can help immediately."
steelers,2zod11,SleestakLightning,3,Mon Mar 23 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"We have a very good line. It got it's ass kicked because Ben and Bell were hurt, and the Ravens pass rush was ridiculous."
steelers,2zod11,hstisalive,0,Mon Mar 23 02:25:27 2015 UTC,They were losing one-on-one match-ups physically. Bell being there was going to suddenly mean they weren't getting beat one-on-one.

The size/speed stretches defenses... similar to what Wallace did (but in a slightly different way given the big size difference obviously between the two)?  Not a bash against Wheaton, but I like Bryant in red zone, too."
steelers,2zkz76,hacklab,11,Thu Mar 19 13:28:16 2015 UTC,"Bryant is a much more natural X receiver than Wheaton exactly because of that speed and size. That's what the ideal X receiver is supposed to have. If he can get better and catching away from his body (he's decent at it, but not quite there), he's capable of being a Pro Bowl-level receiver.   Wheaton, at 5'11 182lbs and with his quickness, is a more natural fit for the slot. Given how much teams move around receivers for matchup advantages these days, though, it's kind of irrelevant."
steelers,2zkz76,NapoleonBlownapart87,32,Thu Mar 19 13:59:53 2015 UTC,Wheaton and Bryant really don't compete with each other for the same types of routes/receptions.  They are complimentary players.  So saying Bryant or Wheaton are #2 or #3 is really just semantics.
steelers,2zkz76,ctornync,11,Thu Mar 19 13:57:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I completely agree with that - there are certainly opportunities for specialization, but I wouldn't necessarily say there's no overlap.  I do agree that it's largely semantics because gameplanning from week-to-week could very well determine who gets used more. Have weak safeties that you want to test deep, Bryant is your guy. Need someone who can get out of routes quickly on hot routes against a strong pass rush, Wheaton is the guy. But with that being said they both can run the 10 yard outs, hitch routes, etc."
steelers,2zkz76,unseth,2,Thu Mar 19 15:05:49 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I thought maybe Haley was just saying that to motivate Bryant and Wheaton.

steelers,2zkz76,Holliman48,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:18:23 2015 UTC,Hard to behind last year's best reciever.
steelers,2zkz76,Diarygirl,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:47:50 2015 UTC,"Bryant should be the 2, as Wheaton is more build for the slot.  Then again, teams now basically start 3WR (and thus 3 CBs) anywyas.  I'm still on board with the notion - especially now - that the base offense should be 3WR, 1TE, 1 RB.   2TE should be used situationally. There's too much talent at WR for those 3 to not be on the field all of the time (except when subbing, goaline, etc.).  As Bryant got more snaps last year, he got significantly better.  His size, speed, and jumping ability should rarely - if at all possible- off the field"
steelers,2zkz76,Holliman48,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:22:41 2015 UTC,If Bryant emerges as a number 2 receiver we're basically set on offense and we can pour high picks into the defense and push for some deep playoff runs in 2-3 years. Also we should groom Wheaton for the slot not wideout
steelers,2zkz76,dj0,0,Sat Mar 21 05:15:49 2015 UTC,"As a native Oregonian, and a die hard OSU fan; my opinion will be a bit byist.   I like Martavis as a deep threat, but not so much for the yards we need. I've seen Wheaton be a deep threat and a short threat throughout his entire career, and I think that's why he is still the number 2. He is definitely a little raw and needs to work on his routes a bit, but I think he makes better catches that Bryant. Once he gets on point with Ben, he'll be more than just a streak receiver. Which is how I feel Bryant is now."

I expect a lot of ""OMG NO CORNERS"" posts but this is a very solid CB class and Antwon Blake played very well last season and is similar in terms of talent to Moore. The Steelers are up against the cap for one more year so I'm not sure why people act shocked when they fail to sign free agents."

I know it's not the Steeler way, and I'm happy about it, but still there's a part of me that would like to hear my team talked about on ESPN."
steelers,2zlun9,Diarygirl,3,Thu Mar 19 21:08:07 2015 UTC,Chip Kelley is just bringing in his type of players. It's only his second season. I love the Steelers speed. Its fun watching all the drama of free agency happen while the whole time the Steelers are being the Steelers. Just floating under the radar.  Edit: Chip's 3rd season. My bad.
steelers,2zlun9,MattEven,-1,Thu Mar 19 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true. I can name quite a few free agents they've brought in over the years.  They don't overpay for free agents. But that's not an issue this year. The defense sucks and lacks depth at OLB, D-line, and in the secondary (only ILB has any real depth). They need(ed) to make some depth signings to allow them to go BPA and not reach in the draft.  While the Patriots went out and gave a very reasonable deal to Jabaal Sheard the Steelers sat there with their thumbs up their ass.  They're likely going to go into the season with a defense that is on paper worse than the one they had last year. That's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable that Cam Thomas is still on the team. That they didn't sign an OLB or a CB yet is even worse. I'm not advocating signing someone just to sign someone. But they have to be players. All the best teams are."
steelers,2zlun9,SleestakLightning,5,Thu Mar 19 19:51:43 2015 UTC,Because we know more than the guys who do this for a living. They also happen to run one of the most successful franchises ever. They will court free agents but they don't chase them. If player can get more money and the Steelers let them walk it means they weren't worth to us. Look back at all the free agents the Steelers let walk and how their careers panned out. Cam Thomas doesn't affect our cap room. That's why they aren't quick to move on him yet. It wouldn't surprise me if they cut him in camp.
steelers,2zlun9,MattEven,0,Thu Mar 19 20:01:00 2015 UTC,"While I would normally agree, this off season NEEDED some moves. We're losing Troy, Brett, most likely Deebo, Worilds, and McCain.   5 of the 11 players on defense. Cam Thomas is not going to be good, ever. Mitchell still has potential imo. Jarvis might as well be a second year player, Shazier might as well still be a rookie, same for Tuitt.   So are we getting all of these pieces from the draft? Because if we have 2 more rookies start next season, that makes for a terribly inexperienced defense against the toughest teams of the league. Including Tom Brady and Peyton manning.   Colbert, Tomlin, and co. have either seriously underestimated the amount of work the defense needs, or they're just slowly rebuking through the draft for the next few years while we waste the best offense the steelers have ever had. They need to do something."
steelers,2zlun9,DriArcher,8,Thu Mar 19 20:07:55 2015 UTC,The offseason started a week ago and the draft hasn't even happened yet. Relax.
steelers,2zlun9,MattEven,-2,Thu Mar 19 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"I understand that. But the steelers had cap space and even had some players visit but signed no one. I understand if they want too much money, but sometimes you gotta pay up a little bit if you want to win."
steelers,2zlun9,DriArcher,3,Thu Mar 19 20:15:58 2015 UTC,They did that by locking up Big Ben for the rest of his career. I don't understand how everybody is so appalled they're not out there chasing all these free agents and throwing out big contracts. That's not the Steeler way. It never has been is never will be. Don't expect them to change anytime soon.
steelers,2zlun9,MattEven,-1,Thu Mar 19 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"Bro, they signed like 6 free agents last season."

Darrius Heyward-Bey: April 2nd.  Today is March 19th. Let alone that all those signings were made after this date a year ago, I can't really see anyone who is or even was available who is quite worthwhile like those guys were to take a chance on. Yeah, McCain and Robinson each got $2 million. The only guy on the above list of free agents signed last season who got more than vet's minimum was Blount, and not only did we see how that worked out, we matched that effort by signing Williams this year.  So yeah, as /u/MattEvan said, the offseason started three weeks ago and the draft hasn't happened yet.  Edit: I was mistaken, Lance Moore signed for more than vet's min as well. My bad."
steelers,2zlun9,Steinerway,0,Thu Mar 19 21:07:32 2015 UTC,I don't recall seeing anyone say they should throw big money at people. The problem is there are players out there who could have helped the team who signed really reasonable contracts.  Jabaal Sheard comes to mind. He's a solid 34 OLB. Signed a reasonable deal with New England. Wasn't even brought in by the Steelers.
steelers,2zlun9,SleestakLightning,2,Thu Mar 19 22:00:08 2015 UTC,Somebody said something to the fact that if the Steelers losing out on possible players because they're not offering big enough deals and other teams are.
steelers,2zlun9,MattEven,2,Thu Mar 19 22:26:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that the Steelers should never overindulge in the offseason. Its not their MO and its not how championship teams are built. But the fact of the matter is, this team doesn't have the critical pieces that they did in years past. While some drafted talent is developing, there's quite a few that haven't. I would like to see the team a little more proactive in free agency so that we can strengthen the roster."
steelers,2zlun9,BTCru,-4,Thu Mar 19 20:20:19 2015 UTC,I hate that idea. If that's the case then why discuss football?   Why are you posting here? You don't know enough about football to be able to discuss it.  Get out of here with that bullshit.
steelers,2zlun9,SleestakLightning,3,Thu Mar 19 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between discussing football with fans, and trying to pretend you know what the Steelers are doing and what they should have done better than the Steelers themselves do. It's not that outlandish to say ""Trust the process"" that has produced the most successful franchise of the modern era, and more specifically one of the most successful franchises of this century."
steelers,2zlun9,Steinerway,-2,Thu Mar 19 21:01:47 2015 UTC,"The same process that hasn't produced a playoff win since 2009.  I know how the Steelers operate. Anyone who pays attention does. It's not rocket science.   I never said I know better than they do, that would be stupid. But to see obvious holes all over the defense that could have been filled by giving reasonable contracts to players who fit their system and to see them do nothing is frustrating."
steelers,2zlun9,SleestakLightning,2,Thu Mar 19 21:56:11 2015 UTC,"I think your math is a little off on that recent playoff win.  If you know how the Steelers operate, then you know it works. It's also not rocket science that these operations, and any operation ever, don't lead to constant success, but a consistent rise and fall. What sets the Steelers apart is that their ""fall"" is zero playoff wins in the past four seasons (not quite a decade, nor even half a decade, unless you're somehow changing the definition of what a decade is), including two playoff appearances. As opposed to other teams, some of whom haven't even made the playoffs in over ten years."
steelers,2zlun9,Steinerway,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:10:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right. I forgot about the Super Bowl run in 2009. I was thinking 8 years since a win.   The moment a team settles for ""good enough"" is the moment they are no longer good enough. It's obvious to everyone that they have major holes to fill on defense. Holes that they cannot and will not be able to fill in the draft alone.  In past years Colbert's MO was to sign players to fill holes to allow them to go BPA in the draft and not be forced into reaching for a need.   So far this off-season it looks like they're going to be forced to do that. It's frustrating. I'm not saying they needed to go out and get Revis. But they have 3 OLB on the roster right now. None of them are proven to be capable of starting.  They have 3 or 4 CBs on the roster. Only one is any good. Though I do think Cortez Allen is going to rebound.  They have no depth on the defensive line. In fact, outside of ILB there isn't a single position on defense that you can say is not only good with starters but has depth as well.  So it looks like it'll be rookies and other teams' castoffs on defense this season. I'm sorry if that doesn't exactly have me brimming with confidence."
steelers,2zlun9,SleestakLightning,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"By my count, 8 years is still not a decade. And even if it were an embarrassingly poor accomplishment to have gone 8 years without a championship, there are only 6 teams that can say otherwise. True we are in the middle of the pack as far as seasons since the most recent win goes, but again, we stand apart because of the past success. Not all the teams' most recent playoff win was an AFCCG sending them to yet another Super Bowl. It's not ""living in the past,"" it's knowing that it works and all comes together. The same process that leads to the dark ages of the 80's had started with the glory days of the 70's. In response to three years without a playoff appearance, including two losing seasons, the team gave Bill Cowher...a contract extension. And we see how that worked out.  With what our offense is set up to be, I could care less about the defense. Yeah it would be great to have a balance...but I'd rather be where we are now than overpay for someone who might provide that balance. And for players like Robinson and Moore even saying ""might"" is pretty generous. Almost as generous as $2 million to Brice McCain. I'd rather easily extend Heyward, Beachum, and be in a position to easily extend DeCastro next year than overpay for a CB or OLB who is only marginally better than what little we have now. I see Robinson and Moore as merely more of what we have now rather than a huge upgrade. Certainly not a $2 million upgrade."

steelers,2zlun9,DriArcher,0,Fri Mar 20 05:40:07 2015 UTC,Maybe? I remember when we used to cringe at the idea of gay playing the outside. Now we're all ok with it because everyone else is THAT bad.
steelers,2zlun9,ShaquilleO_feel,3,Thu Mar 19 19:31:06 2015 UTC,"He's definitely improved since his first stint with the team. He's a solid #2 corner. I'd prefer management look to the draft for a true #1 corner we can develop.  Tbh, addressing cornerback in the draft was always the best option.

steelers,2zlun9,DriArcher,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:25:58 2015 UTC,Robinson and Moore are hardly big names. We signed about 6 free agents last season.
steelers,2zlun9,fauxedo,3,Thu Mar 19 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"Our corners were performing relatively well during the end of the season, and we don't need a shutdown secondary if our front seven is performing like it's supposed to.

steelers,2zlun9,DriArcher,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:46:00 2015 UTC,"We only need one safety and that's in case one of them gets hurt.

The defense is definitely worse right now than it was last season so far."

steelers,2zlun9,DriArcher,0,Thu Mar 19 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"They had Patrick Robinson visit too. They just don't want to spend money on someone when they can pay less for a rookie. But it's the fact that the front office has ignored the cornerback situation ever since Lewis left that irritates me. We're going to draft a pass rusher in the first most likely.   I'm sorry but the corners we have now aren't good. They're average at best and that's not going to be good enough against the teams we play this year. We still have a mediocre pass rush, leaving the secondary exposed."

steelers,2zlcuj,DriArcher,-2,Thu Mar 19 17:33:13 2015 UTC,What about the other OLBs though? We have TWO on the roster. Jones and Moats aren't exactly the scariest set of pass rushers out there.

steelers,2zjvak,Steinerway,4,Thu Mar 19 04:44:55 2015 UTC,"SteelersDepot is really polarizing. Some people hate it, but I and many others love it. The guy is a private blogger so he doesn't have exclusive insider information so it's not quite for breaking news, but I think it is insightful and keeps a very level head. There are a lot of stupidly negative Steelers fans, more than I've seen of other teams, who try whining about how all the drafts have sucked since 2008, how our lack of activity in free agency is killing the team, how little they (these ""fans"") understand the cap and what restructuring actually is, how ""inconsistent"" the team has been (when, again, if you want to see inconsistent, open your eyes and look around the league), and in general stupid things that can only be said when they lack perspective of the rest of the league. It's not ""avoiding being a homer"" or anything, these people throw out reason and common sense for the sake of being pessimistic. Dave Bryan of SteelersDepot, as a private blogger with no official team affiliation, can be somewhat unprofessional when calling those people out, but the thing is he's not wrong. He's just an asshole. But he's not wrong, and I personally value that more than how he talks to internet users of a certain...intelligence. And even then it's not blindly making fun of them and instigating stuff, he just has snide remarks to silly questions.  So I'd say check out SteelersDepot for yourself and make your own opinion. It's polarizing, you might like the insight and analysis it has. But only articles written by Dave Bryan (opinion and cap analysis), Alex Kozora (film study) and sometimes Matthew Marczi (film study). A lot of people also think the site is garbage because the other writers outside of those three tend to be garbage."
steelers,2zjvak,SleestakLightning,-1,Thu Mar 19 13:05:18 2015 UTC,Depot is garbage because the guy steals news from other sources and doesn't credit them and then people credit him for breaking the news. It's ridiculous.
steelers,2zjvak,Steinerway,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:35:21 2015 UTC,"NOW I remember why your username looked familiar in that discussion we had in the Sterling Moore thread. If you think last season was a failure, no wonder you hate SteelersDepot. Because he relentlessly makes fun of people like you.  You keep saying you don't go to the site, yet you know he doesn't site sources? How does that work? That's what leads you to say things that are inherrently false. Bite the bullet and go to the site one more time. The most recent, first on the page ""breaking news"" report Bryan makes is about Sterling Moore signing with the Bucs. The text saying ""...has now agreed to terms"" is a link to the sportstalkflorida that reports the news, and the end of the sentence says ""...according to Jenna Lane of Sports Talk Florida."" The very next sentence begins with ""Laine reports that..."" If that's not giving credit, I don't know what is.  It didn't take any digging at all to find that example that directly contradicts your claim. It's literally the first post by Bryan that's up there. Hell, let's look at the second one. Tomlin, Colbert and others are at the Missouri Pro Day. He shows the tweet by the person who took and tweeted the picture. He says that there's a report that they met with Shane Ray...""thanks to a report by Terez A. Paylor of the Kansas City Star.""  So that's not only two in a row, but it's the top two. And I don't feel like going through it now, but I'm willing to bet that all of them are like this. So what's that about him not giving credit?"
steelers,2zjvak,SleestakLightning,0,Fri Mar 20 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he never does. But there have been times when he absolutely reported Steelers news that he ripped from someone's twitter and made no mention of who reported it first. Maybe he's changed his ways now that he's lucked his way into appearances on Steelers Nation Radio.  Last season was a failure. The goal of every season is to win the Super Bowl, right? That's by the team's own admission. They didn't win so it's a failure.  I don't think Dave Bryan is very knowledgeable about football either, but that's another story.  My biggest problem is that he does zero work and reaps all the benefits for it. It must be nice to make money off the time and effort others put into their job."

steelers,2zl61h,akmalhot,3,Thu Mar 19 17:19:01 2015 UTC,"If the BPA is a tackle or a guard they should jump at the chance to take him assuming there isn't a top pass rusher on the board still.  The O-Line got it's ass kicked in the playoff loss to Baltimore. RT and LG especially can be upgraded. If a lineman falls, take him.  That's how the Steelers do things. They go BPA according to their board, at least in the first round.  That said, the guy has Brandon Scherff at #10 on his list. Not #1."
steelers,2zl61h,SleestakLightning,6,Thu Mar 19 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"I agree.  You'll note that the 7-10 players are all ""if all else fails and we're looking for value rather than filing need"" players though the CB is more of a character risk one.  If you can't get a first round talent in OLB or CB, don't go that direction.  Don't reach.  It'd be fine with a TE as heir apparent for Miller.  I'd be fine with a stud OL player to protect Ben.  It's not ideal.  We need to address OLB and CB in rounds 2, 3 and 4 obviously, but neither of those are particular issues.  Ike was a 4th rounder.  Woodley was a 2nd rounder.  This team will not reach in the first round."
steelers,2zl61h,Drakengard,3,Thu Mar 19 17:58:54 2015 UTC,I'd go as far as to say I'd prefer Maxx Williams in the 1st over anyone but one of the top 2-3 OLBs.   Williams has potential to be a Top 5 TE in the league. None of the OLBs with the exception of the guys who will be gone within the first 15 picks have that potential.  There are very Steelers-like CBs that are going to be available in mid-to-late rounds too. They don't need a top pedigree CB if they can get some pass rushers.
steelers,2zl61h,SleestakLightning,2,Thu Mar 19 18:01:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think our offense performs in a way at this moment that spending a first on a TE is a smart decision. I know that we drafted Heath in the first, and that he has been a reliable playmaker for a decade. However, with our other weapons right now drafting a TE when we need defensive help and upgrades on our line would be a huge error."
steelers,2zl61h,ltownsoccer11,3,Thu Mar 19 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"It's better than reaching for a pick.  Maxx Williams is more Rob Gronkowski than Heath Miller. That's not to say he's as good as Gronk, no one is. But he brings athletic ability to the TE position that will open up the field for the rest of the offense.  As good as the offense was last season, if you put an athletic pass catching TE in there it opens things up even more for Le'Veon Bell in the passing game. It forces defenses to choose to cover the TE instead of sitting back, letting Heath catch and then tackling him.  I'm not saying that TE should be the #1 option. Obviously if an elite OLB is there that has to be the pick. But failing that, Maxx Williams is a very good option to bring the offense into the 21st century."
steelers,2zl61h,SleestakLightning,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"Reaching for a TE in the first is almost always a reach anyway. I've watched quite a bit of him. And his hands aren't really elite. And he isn't as athletic as Gronk. He's exceptional in no particular way. And it isn't a need. I'm all for BPA, but there will be better players available at our pick than Maxx"
steelers,2zl61h,ltownsoccer11,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:02:25 2015 UTC,"Except it's not a reach.   Maxx Williams is a projected 1st round pick. He'll likely go mid-to-late 1st round. That's not a reach.  He's an exceptional pass catcher, he has great hands and he's a willing blocker who gets better all the time. To say he's not exceptional tells me all I need to know about you."
steelers,2zl61h,SleestakLightning,2,Thu Mar 19 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"The media is projecting him as a late first rounder. I don't think a lot of teams see him as that. I think the only team drafting at the end of the 1st who might even consider him would be the Saints, depending on what they take with their earlier pick. If he went 22nd overall that would be picking him early IMO.   Thanks for the personal attack btw."
steelers,2zl61h,ltownsoccer11,3,Thu Mar 19 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Picking him early based on what other teams might do, not based on his talent. He's a 1st round talent.   I think after the first 3 or 4 OLB come off the board, Williams is right in that next tier with La'el Collins, Trae Waynes, etc.   There are going to be good OLB available in the 2nd round and later. There are going to be Steelers-style CBs available into the 3rd day. They need to go BPA in the first round.   I'd probably put Maxx Williams somewhere from 18-25 on my board. I can't see anyone else being available when the Steelers pick who would be ahead of him. But if someone falls then they absolutely need to take the player that drops. I'm not advocating Williams above everyone else."

What we needed to do to be successful like them. Rooney instead told them to screw off and did it his way to the point that he created ""Steelers football."" This is why we're so hated. We're not like other traditional teams in America. Even when Rooney was offered the title of being ""America's Team"" he told them no because it was ""Pittsburgh's Team"". And since then, and to this day, we've been hated for doing it our own way.  The Raiders are actually the same, although were more boisterous about it.

steelers,2zixsz,koolaieds,13,Wed Mar 18 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"YES. YES. YES. We definately could use him at least for depth behind Timmons, Shazier, Williams, Spence, and Garvin. /s"

steelers,2zixsz,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:06:02 2015 UTC,It actually would work if they wanted to move Timmons to OLB (they really don't have anyone better outside) and they could have Spikes as his replacement inside.  But nah.
steelers,2zixsz,SleestakLightning,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:50:15 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I'd like him in Pittsburgh. He's a situational ILB nowadays, since he isn't great in coverage, but he is ferocious against the run. An absolute hammer. If Shazier struggles, Spikes would be the early down ILB and would then rotate with someone else on passing downs.  Best case scenario you have two studs in Timmons and Shazier. Worst case scenario Spikes is great depth.  He's a better but older version of Vince Williams right now. Probably bigger, stronger, and slower as well."

steelers,2ze2o2,bryansnameistaken,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:24:54 2015 UTC,The comments were almost certainly not about Wallace. The question was asked generically about a hypothetical person quitting on the team. If he had anyone in mind it was probably Blount.

When he went to the dolphins he even said that Ben was like a brother to him.  How is that alienating himself from the team to you?
steelers,2ze2o2,SleestakLightning,0,Wed Mar 18 01:50:40 2015 UTC,When I was in the locker room after the games AB and Manny would always talk and joke with other players. Wallace didn't see to have many friends on the team.  I know for a fact that his teammates were not happy with how he refused to put in time to work out. AB was constantly working to get better. Wallace was lazy and demanding.  There were times when players would talk about Wallace or a reporter would mention him and they'd roll their eyes or smirk.   There was always tension around Wallace while he was here. Pouncey's quote just reveals to the public what journalists have known all along.
steelers,2ze2o2,rsh412,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:05:20 2015 UTC,"When I was in the locker room after the games AB and Manny would always talk and joke with other players. Wallace didn't see to have many friends on the team.   How does not being loud and outgoing make you a bad teammate? Some people are just naturally quiet and introverted, even among friends. That doesn't make them bad people or weirdos or something. Shit, even if he wasn't best friends with everyone on the team, that doesn't make him a bad teammate in and of itself. Football is a job to these guys. Are you friends with everyone at your job? If not, does that make you a bad employee or coworker? Being gregarious is not the same as being a good person and vice versa."
steelers,2ze2o2,SleestakLightning,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"Sure but when 95% of the locker room is joking around and having fun after the game and you're sitting there sulking and no one is talking to you despite the fact that your team won, that says more than any words can.  It happened seemingly every week. No matter what happened on the field, if the team won or lost, Wallace was sitting in his stall pouting. It wasn't that he was uncomfortable talking to the media or anything because he was always a great person to talk to. But outside of his fellow WRs he'd never really interact with anyone.   Maybe it was due to where his locker was, I don't know.   Having been in that locker room for a while you get a feel for players and you can see which players are close and which players are disliked. There were other players who were quiet, Troy especially. But Wallace gave off a different vibe. Heath was always really stoic and you could tell if the team won or lost just by looking at him. The offensive linemen tended to be quiet and a bit guarded.   Wallace was different. He was outgoing and willing to talk, but it seemed like his teammates ignored him a bit."
steelers,2ze2o2,rsh412,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:28:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly have no idea about Wallace since I'm just a fan. Troy's an interesting counterpoint, since he's obviously a pretty quiet guy even just from his public persona. I just know that in the past people have told me that they initially thought I was a dick because I didn't talk to them when in reality I'm very friendly, but just very quiet and bad at/don't like small talk, so I hate seeing that stereotype of ""quiet = not friendly"". He may very well be a bad teammate or a douche. I just didn't want ""he was quiet"" to be a strike against him all on its own."
steelers,2ze2o2,SleestakLightning,2,Wed Mar 18 16:04:03 2015 UTC,And that was my fault for not explaining better.
steelers,2ze2o2,ericfg,-3,Wed Mar 18 17:45:14 2015 UTC,Other than being a fairly good Center when he's not on IR I'm surprised he's still a Stiller.  The Rooneys usually give short shrift to those who spout Pouncey's sort of continued douchebaggery.  The NFL has changed a lot since The Chief passed.
steelers,2ze2o2,WhatWhatInTheTwat,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of his attitude either but he's more than a ""fairly good center"". He's top 5 easy. Regardless, I'm a little surprised as well."
steelers,2ze2o2,Kofile,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:07:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely top-5. Would like for him to be more healthy overall, but I can't bitch too much about the consistent production he's given.  You don't ship a top-5 player from one of the most important positions on your team.  I'd like to see a more steady progresion (I'm not OL guru by any means, buy MP seems to not have progressed very much since his rookie year. Luckily, he was already really fucking good his rookie year) from MP, but he's a essential piece of the Steelers roster that isn't easily replaced.  Would you want the Doug Legursky or Sean Mahan abortion to come back to (dis)grace the franchise?  I know I seem like I'm attacking you, but lets be honest here with ourselves."
steelers,2ze2o2,WhatWhatInTheTwat,2,Wed Mar 18 02:56:55 2015 UTC,Oh I totally agree with you. If it was up to me he'd definitely stick around for a very long time. Just saying his attitude is not one the Rooneys usually put up. But I'm glad they are in this case.

Third, do you guys like being able to say that we've won six superbowls? Because I sure as hell do. You know who we can thank for that?

Holmes could be the #4 guy / special teams guy.   Thing is Holmes would be the 6th option on the team behind Brown, Bell, Miller, Bryant, and Wheaton so him having better hands doesn't mean much because he'll seldom be thrown to (Lance Moore who ended up the #4 receiver only had 14 catches all last season). What's more useful, Holmes getting 15-20 catches all year (which will just go to somebody else if he isn't here) or DHB's significantly better special teams and blocking skills? Holmes is also a prick and potential locker room distraction while DHB has no such concerns."
steelers,2zcs2t,DriArcher,2,Tue Mar 17 15:46:14 2015 UTC,exactly my thoughts... DHB is a great special teams player
steelers,2zcs2t,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Tue Mar 17 16:30:53 2015 UTC,"Significantly better special teams skills and blocking skills is a stretch. DHB was hardly ever in on offense, even to block. While I think he was good on ST, he's easily replaceable. But yeah. Santonio could pretty much be what Lance Moore was supposed to be for probably less money."
steelers,2zcs2t,DF_1982,4,Tue Mar 17 15:48:46 2015 UTC,"Lance Moore lined up for 23.7% of the team's offensive snaps while Heyward-Bey lined up for 11.1% so neither guy was a big part of the offense however at least DHB found a way to contribute (the guy was a very good special team's blocker and gunner and that's no exaggeration). I have no faith in Holmes to do either of those things on the level that Heyward-Bey has done for the past several seasons.  Why do you need somebody like Holmes to do what Lance Moore did though?  Last season only 46 passes went to players who weren't among the top 5 guys I named. Rounding up to 50 that's 50 passes to split between the #4 receiver, #5 receiver, #2 TE, DeAngelo Williams, and Dri Archer. This is without considering that that Martavis Bryant and Markus Wheaton are likely to see their work load increase next season as they gain in experience which should cut into that 50 passes number.  I fail to see how Holmes' 15 catches are going to be more valuable to the Steelers than DHB's special teams contributions. Especially considering that Holmes has been a locker room problem in the past while DHB has embraced his role on special teams."

As far as DHB's gunner/blocking abilities go, I'd rather keep DHB over the ~15 catches.  However, have you considered Holmes ability as a punt returner on ST?"
steelers,2zcs2t,Kofile,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:16:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, I actually mention that in another post. Holmes has never been a great return man. He had one career return over 50 yards that came back in 2006. Since then he's averaged less than 5 yards per return and in his 30's he isn't going to suddenly turn into a great return man."
steelers,2zcs2t,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:27:46 2015 UTC,"Knowing Holmes, those 15-20 catches could easily be ones that lock up games and win them. IE Cotch's first year here where he seemingly always made the critical catch on third.  To be fair, Cotch has better hands than Holmes - at best ""as good"" - but I would LOVE to see 7 and 10 hook back up."
steelers,2zcs2t,SteelerBoss,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:59:45 2015 UTC,Cotchery has significantly better hands than Holmes and he was/is far more willing to make though catches in traffic than Holmes. Holmes has been soft for years now.
steelers,2zcs2t,Kofile,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:24:37 2015 UTC,I think Markus Wheaton played that role this year. He might not of had a lot of touchdowns but he had lots of 3rd down passes.
steelers,2zcs2t,SleestakLightning,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:26:48 2015 UTC,"He did play that role, and played it well. But I would rather have Holmes be the WR4 and relegate DHB to the 5WR/Special teams role (if the team even carries 5WRs).  The main deterrent against Holmes at the WR4 is that he probably can't/won't play STs, which requires either someone else to play that role or for someone else to be the WR4."
steelers,2zcs2t,PomfAndCircvmstance,-1,Tue Mar 17 18:04:35 2015 UTC,Holmes as a punt returner >>>>> DHB as anything.
steelers,2zcs2t,SleestakLightning,3,Tue Mar 17 16:05:28 2015 UTC,Holmes has has one punt return TD in his career  (in 2006) and did nothing as a return man last year. I fail to see how a 30 something Holmes is going to suddenly turn into a great return man. Also Dri Archer? Are we calling him a special teams bust already?
steelers,2zcs2t,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:19:18 2015 UTC,"Holmes doesn't have to be great to be an upgrade over what we have. If it gets AB off the field in those situations great.  And yes, Dri Archer is a bust. He fucking sucks. He's useless. If he cannot contribute on specials then he should be cut."
steelers,2zcs2t,SleestakLightning,2,Tue Mar 17 16:23:25 2015 UTC,I agree that getting Brown off the field is a concern but there are plenty of guys who can do what Holmes does on special teams as well as plenty better than Holmes who can return punts instead.
steelers,2zcs2t,PomfAndCircvmstance,0,Tue Mar 17 16:31:13 2015 UTC,Who are these guys? Are they available? Do they want to play here?  And how many of them have been a Super Bowl MVP?
steelers,2zcs2t,SleestakLightning,2,Tue Mar 17 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"http://walterfootball.com/freeagents2015WR.php  Here's a list of free agent receivers. Brandon Tate, Jeremy Ross, Denarius Moore,  and Jarrett Boykin all immediately jump out as options who are younger than Holmes and better as return men with the potential to grow into good receivers. You're over rating Holmes on a big way as the list or receivers as good or better than him is a long one.  We aren't in 2009 any more so bringing up Holmes' (really Roethlisbergers) SB MVP is irrelevant. This isn't the same Holmes, it's 2015 and he's just a guy."
steelers,2zcs2t,DriArcher,-2,Tue Mar 17 17:05:09 2015 UTC,"None of those guys have half the talent Holmes did. Even if he's half the player he used to be, he's still better than all of them.  I'm not saying they should go out an give him big money. I'm saying that if he wants to be here, and is willing to sign for cheap then he'd be the perfect #4 receiver.  Those guys you mentioned are younger, that's all they have on Holmes. Bring Santonio in, if he sucks you cut him during preseason. He had a chemistry with Ben unlike anyone we've seen. That doesn't just go away. It would be stupid to not at least take a flyer on him if the price is right.  The Steelers have already let guys like Jabaal Sheard who could immediately upgrade the team go sign elsewhere for affordable contracts. Greg Hardy is probably next. Holmes is not likely to get signed any time soon. Bring him in for cheap, see what he has left, and if it's nothing...move on."
steelers,2zcs2t,SleestakLightning,0,Tue Mar 17 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"How is archer a bust? The dude had like 14 carries or something like that.   And before you insult me and call me a homer or faggot or whatever you're going to call me, just know that I don't give a fuck what happens with archer.   But he is in no way a bust."
steelers,2zcs2t,DriArcher,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"Seeing as he's too small to do anything but return kicks and punts (and he sucks at it) he's without question a bust.  He can't pass protect. So that limits what he can do when he's on the field.  So when he's out there, they either have to force him the ball, or they take someone who can actually do something off the field for Archer to be a decoy.  He's so small that he goes down too easily and he isn't fast enough to run away from defenders in the NFL.  His problems aren't things you can work on or get better at. His problem is that he's too small and he doesn't have the physical attributes to compensate for that."
steelers,2zcs2t,SleestakLightning,-2,Tue Mar 17 17:15:41 2015 UTC,"Tomlin said it himself ""i would be an idiot if I wanted archer to block ngata"" or something like that. no fucking shit he can't pass block. HES NOT A PASS BLOCKING RUNNING BACK.   He's hardly a running back anyway. His first NFL play was a 50 yard screen pass that he almost took to the house. It's not his fault that Todd Haley has no idea how to utilize him.   And the ""too small"" argument is bullshit. D'anthony Thomas is the same size and had no problems last year. Sproles is a tiny guy too and he's an absolute beast.   If archer is a bust, then so is Jarvis, Shazier, Shamarko, Tuitt, McCullers by your logic."
steelers,2zcs2t,SleestakLightning,0,Tue Mar 17 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"D'Anthony Thomas is better at making people miss than Archer. Archer fucking sucks.  I realize you love the guy but don't be ridiculous. Sproles is a monster compared to Archer. Sproles is built for a little guy. Archer is skinny as hell.  Jarvis has shown improvement playing the run, Shaz made plays but was hurt, Shamarko has made plays on teams, Tuitt looked good and so did McCullers.  All of those guys showed more promise than Dri f'n Archer did. Archer is garbage. There is zero reason he should even see the field on offense. None. There is nothing he can do that someone else on the team can't do better."
steelers,2zcs2t,Drakengard,2,Tue Mar 17 17:31:53 2015 UTC,Holmes can't play STs the way DHB can but he'd be an instant upgrade as a punt returner.

I'd love to see 10 have a graceful bow like Plax did in his final game against Cleveland.   Wouldn't he wear 14? 10 is taken by Marty, and roster/position rules dictate that WRs can't wear single digits"
steelers,2zcs2t,Tbenzo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:14:23 2015 UTC,Holmes wants to come back because he knows its a class organization with a chance to win.  I sincerely doubt he's getting much interest elsewhere.  I'm all aboard if he wants to play for league minimum and occupy the 4th spot.  I just don't think he will be humble enough to take a backseat to Wheaton and Bryant.
steelers,2zcs2t,huet99,-1,Thu Mar 19 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"I can't believe there are still fans out there that would want to bring back santonio... Even for the veterans minimum. Why would we want a selfish player back in our locker room. He's not a team guy, he misses us because he misses the winning mentality and Steeler way. Why don't we bring back Darius Hayward-Bey who will happily take 795,000 per year and isn't at the lasting moments of his career, and let us not forget Darius has way bigger upside than Holmes because he has been in the league only 6 years and he has blazing speed when he's in top physical condition and I think at this point in his career Darius isn't taking any chances on not working hard because he knows he's close to being out of the league for good."
steelers,2zcs2t,Tbenzo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:57:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's pointless. Go win a superbowl for us first, and then we'll resign you.     Oh, right."

steelers,2zcs2t,Tbenzo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:18:36 2015 UTC,"Different for a couple reasons: Holmes' role would be much smaller and he would be cheaper, as well as it being a short term deal to let him finish his career for the team he directly won the Super bowl for."
steelers,2zcs2t,huet99,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:39:42 2015 UTC,"I agree it's different I'm just making a point that we shouldn't sign someone based on their past. We should sign someone on their future, ergo we should sign Darrius Hayward-Bey instead of Holmes because at least we have a longer possible future with him."
steelers,2zcs2t,Tbenzo,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:22:31 2015 UTC,"No, I see where you're going. I just don't think it would be a bad move to have him for a year as our #4 to return to the city which he brought a super bowl to."

The Steelers scheme was amazing because you never knew what Coach Dad was going to throw at you. The Seahawks were predictable. This is what we are lining up in.....deal with it. I find it impressive to get that much pressure with a typical 4 man rush and running that much cover 3."

steelers,2zbkki,BEGA500,2,Wed Mar 18 01:14:39 2015 UTC,Ah thanks for the clarification
steelers,2zbkki,Steinerway,0,Wed Mar 18 01:43:01 2015 UTC,I guess if you just look at numbers you are right. I tend to look at a bit more when trying to determine best all time.
steelers,2zbkki,BEGA500,2,Wed Mar 18 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, we already established you like particular schemes. So if one team is less efficient in a Tampa 2 while another team is better in a 34 zone blitz, you'll take the less efficient team because you ""like them better?"" Good luck with that."
steelers,2zbkki,Steinerway,2,Wed Mar 18 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"Scheme makes a difference because of how maintainable it is. I loved our old defense but when the legends who ran it left, retired and aged it fell apart. Its because our system is complicated and requires very specific physical skill sets to employ. After 2013 seattle lost thurmond, browner, and red bryant. In 2014 they barley missed a beat. There defense is simpler and much easier to repeat.  If you want to grade the defenses on numbers alone then this topic isnt a debate, it is just a stat sheet with a team at the top. I think it is important, especially in todays NFL, to be able to repeat you success even when you lose parts. A defensive scheme that is easy to stock, to me, is better than one that is hard.  The 08 steelers and 13 seahawks had very comparable numbers but seattle did it with, what is in my view, a better system so I give them the nod."
steelers,2zbkki,BEGA500,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"Well, again, that's a complete contradiction. We're comparing single years. Why would maintaining that production in future years have any bearing on comparisons between the sole years of the discussion, 2008 and 2013? And even playing your game and pretending subsequent years are in any way relevant in comparing single years, the Steelers defense truly fell apart in 2013. Even without a pass rush in 2011 and 2012, Carnell Lake had the DBs playing out of their minds. Anyway, 2013. Six seasons after the year in question. Let's wait until we're six seasons removed from the Seahawks' good year before we say they're that much more maintainable, shall we?"
steelers,2zbkki,Steinerway,2,Tue Mar 17 14:39:01 2015 UTC,If you want it by simple numbers then the 2000 ravens are the best with 165 points given up. That simple.
steelers,2zbkki,BEGA500,1 point,Tue Mar 17 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"Don't give up and create a strawman when you have no other response. I'm sure you can find something. Or you could just reflect on your argument, be a big man and realize it makes no sense, and we both move on with our lives. At least I'm being condescending because you're giving me plenty of opportunities. You're trying to be because not only do I not agree with your point, I'm explaining why your point doesn't hold much weight...and you have no response to that."
steelers,2zbkki,Steinerway,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:07:54 2015 UTC,"My argument is their system is better and they had a comparable year. In 08 we allowed 13.9 per game. In 13 they allowed 14.4. If you are discounting system quality that leaves you with effectiveness of the system. You pointed out earlier that only effectiveness of the system matters. The most effective defensive system measured over a 16 game season ever is the 2000 baltimore ravens. Its not a straw man, its just the team that allowed the least PPG ever in 16 game season.  Also is you have issues with arguement types you check your ad hominem crap at the door."

Problem is that 1. Neither I nor anyone else said that, and 2. Both points you tried bringing up are still invalid and irrelevant. ""The 2013 Seahawks were better than the 2008 Steelers because despite the fact that they were worse and less efficient across the board, I like their scheme better!"" ""The 2013 Seahawks were better than the 2008 Steelers because in years other than 2008 and 2013, the Seahawks have maintained this performance for two years while the Steelers regressed after six!"" No matter how hard you try bringing up about the 2000 Ravens and the one statistic you want to pretend I'm using, your initial arguments make absolutely no sense and are pretty silly."

steelers,2zbkki,Steinerway,6,Tue Mar 17 18:42:38 2015 UTC,There was a good post a few months ago that I've lost to the abyss that is reddit that had the top defences in each year ranked by yards allowed. However this link provides a good take on a few of the more notable defences. If anyone has that post saved or even know the direct link that would be awesome.  http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/bestNFLdefense.html
steelers,2zbkki,mrpopperspenguin,3,Tue Mar 17 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"That post reminded me how Reddit likes to find one statistic and hold it above all others as if it's the be all end all when the reality is that it's merely another stat. PFF scores for OL and DL, the stat in the post you're mentioning apparently, passer rating...it's like honest player evaluation and film goes out the window.  If memory serves correct, the thread you're referring to simply took each teams' adjusted yards per attempt, saw how far away it was from the league average, and put it in order from greatest gap to smallest. So the 2008 Steelers, who played in a year when Baltimore had a pretty incredible defense as well and even Tennessee was great, won't be that high on the chart which IMO makes it quite flawed.  Polamalu, Mr. Silent and Modest himself, recently said something like ""Taking into consideration the new rules that make everything easier for offenses, yeah I'd say that 2008 defense was the best of all time."" Now it's impossible to truly come up with a definitive answer, but the 08 Steelers defense is much more in the conversation than people seem to want to talk about. Certainly better than the '13 Seahawks, and they've been talked about much more than the 08 Steelers, and not just because they were more recent. Again, I don't give a shit about that one singular stat that Reddit thinks trumps all else."

Over the last NINE games of the season they allowed 28 total points and had FIVE shutouts. One game they gave up 16 points. They allowed 6, 3, and 3 in the other games.  They started off the season poorly but finished strong so if you look at numbers, they're not gonna be ranked high.  But I challenge anyone to find an equal performance in the Super Bowl era."

He already has elite vision and probably some of the nice cuts while still being powerful enough to break tackles. LeVeon Bell is a premier back and a true Pittsburgh Steeler."

steelers,2z8dbj,provolone12,-10,Tue Mar 17 03:35:50 2015 UTC,"One pick does not a great combo make. We've been very hit-and-miss since he came on board in 2007.   2007 - We miss out on Revis and Willis, unable to trade up. We take Timmons one pick after Revis and 3 picks after Willis. I like Timmons, but you are an irredeemable homer if you think his value is/was anywhere near Revis' or Willis' value as both are HOF locks. Then we picked Woodley which was questionable even then. I would not say that worked out. In fact I would say he's one of the biggest ongoing cap setbacks we've ever had. We were slotted to pick Ryan Kalil there and didn't. Sean Freking Mahan was our C. That was stupid to pass on Kalil! We at least got Gay late. 2008 - We took Mendenheadcase. Before CJ2K by 1 pick. We all left Matt Forte on the board. Then we picked another headcase, Limas Sweed in the 2nd. Ray Rice was there. Had we not picked Mendenhall or CJ0.5K, we'd have had a shot at two better backs. We invited Doug Legursky to camp. That was out best move. 2009 - We drafted Ziggy Hood #1. There were so many other choices that it's not even worth naming them all. Suffice it to say, that was the draft where LeSean McCoy wanted to come home and we didn't take him, trade down, nothing. We drafted Kraig Urbik who was actually pretty good, except we let him go. We traded up for Mike Wallace, which was good. We got Keenan Lewis who was great while it lasted. Like Legursky, we got Ramon Foster to come to camp for us undrafted. 2010 - We get Pouncey. Which is great, except we should have addressed C before then. Demaryius Thomas was on the board. We got Worilds, which was good then. Emmanuel Sanders in the 3rd was a steal, but we couldn't retain him. Navorro Bowman was on the board and of course the 49ers traded up to nab him as he was a major slip. We missed Geno Atkins to take Thaddeus Gibson, even when it was clear Atkins was a great value and Hood was garbage for us. In a stroke of genius we traded up to get Antonio Brown in the 6th, which is our Tom Brady moment. 2011 - This is getting recent. We got Cam Heyward. Maybe he works out. We took Marcus Gilbert and left Justin Houston on the board and he filled a serious need. Of course the Chiefs traded up to get him.  2012 - We took DeCastro. We will see. We took Mike Adams. Again, we will see. We took Alameda Ta'amu and that was bad. And we traded to make that error.  2013 - We take Jarvis Jones 1st. So far, it's not looking good. The 49ers couldn't believe we passed on Eric Reid and took him by trading up. Then we get to your pick. Bell. Yes, that was a good pick. But even with Lacy there, we couldn't go wrong. So far Shamarko may not have been a good pick.  2014 - We'll see with Shazier, but Mosley's already Pro Bowl'd and fits our needs better. The two players picked after Shazier are both looking HOF-bound in he and Zack Martin. Martavis Bryant looks like another WR steal.    If you ask me, all I see are errors and mistakes. I don't trust them. In fact I think we need better scouting. Some of those passes are unforgivable. We're great at evaluating WRs not named Limas Sweed.   Let's not pat ourselves on the back here too hard."
steelers,2z8dbj,smacksaw,16,Mon Mar 16 15:45:59 2015 UTC,"Then we picked Woodley which was questionable even then.   This is some serious recency bias.  Woodley looked like a steal and was instrumental in a superbowl win and another run.  He didn't live up to his second contract, but he did plenty before that to justify picking him.   We took Marcus Gilbert and left Justin Houston on the board and he filled a serious need.   Gilbert was an even more serious need at the time.  Everyone was clamoring for us to draft a tackle."
steelers,2z8dbj,Sex_E_Searcher,8,Mon Mar 16 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"Woodley was a GREAT pick and he was a great player until injuries took hold.  Tackle was a need, OLB was NOT. At all. At least not early in the draft.  Besides, the Steelers never draft for need anyway."

steelers,2z8dbj,B_Witt,12,Mon Mar 16 16:08:17 2015 UTC,"Willis retired and Timmons is still playing and is only 28 years old. Timmons is one of the best ILBs in the NFL. Revis would've been wasted in Lebeau's defense.  2008 was a product of the Best Player Available strategy. They go BPA, they always do. Especially in early rounds. They took two consensus top talents. Mendenhall worked out well for a few years, Sweed didn't. I guarantee you there are other NFL teams that would have loved their 1st round pick to be as productive as Mendenhall was. And others who also had their Top 2 picks flame out in the same year. It happens.  2009 -- Ziggy sucked and it ended up being a bad pick but that can happen when you're picking last. They had no reason to take McCoy with Mendenhall there and you have no way of knowing if anyone even wanted to trade up with them so you can't bash them for not trading out of the spot.  2010 -- LOL you admit the pick was great but then bitch because it didn't happen sooner. You're clearly looking for negatives. Hood had played one season and as per usual in Lebeau's defense didn't get the chance to prove much of anything his rookie year so no Ziggy hadn't been ""garbage"" at that point, the jury was still out on him.   2011 -- Heyward's already working out. Not sure what you're talking about there. OLB wasn't a serious need in 2011 because they had Woodley, Harrison, and Worilds to back them up.   2012 -- Decastro's already proven he was worth the pick. Again, not sure what you're talking about. Ta'amu could have been productive but they cut him.  2013 -- Can't argue about Jarvis or Shamarko but the Bell pick was great. The kind of pick, like taking AB in the 6th round, that can make a draft even if all the other picks suck.  2014 -- It's waaaay too early to say that a player is HOF-bound after one season. That's laughable and makes me wish I never wasted my time to argue this with you because it's fucking laughable."

steelers,2z8dbj,Steinerway,4,Mon Mar 16 21:58:46 2015 UTC,"Because a lot of those were outright lies.  For the factually incorrect ones:   You don't ""miss out"" on players who are drafted before you pick, as he claims we ""missed out"" on Willis and Revis and settled for Timmons. Woodley is about as far away from ""questionable"" as you can be. He was one of the best players at his position for four years, that's a damn good pick even if he does begin to shut down after getting paid. I mean, I guess you can hold the opinion that ""Woodley sucks!"" in the sense that there are some who say ""Brady sucks!"" and ""Peyton sucks!"" Not that Woodley was ever close to their level, just that there's someone who is or was undeniably good and if you say otherwise, that's hardly an opinion. That's just hating. Didn't trade up for Mike Wallace, we traded up for Keenan Lewis. And if he wants to be such a revisionist and talk about all the good players who were drafted soon after our picks in any given years (which can be applied for literally every pick by every team and is the weakest argument anyone can ever make ever), the great Bill Belichick took Brandon Tate the pick before we took Wallace. And I won't hold it against OP since this is a point that a lot of people miss, but I find it funny that he says ""We stupidly cut Urbik but lucky we found Foster!"" We cut Urbik because Foster developed so quickly. ""Maybe Cam works out."" It's a few years too late to wonder something like that, he's answered the question with a resounding yes ever since taking over as starter. See above with the Woodley analogy. ""This clearly good star player sucks!!!"" Really? Does he suck? Explain how he sucks. Because he appears pretty dominant to...you know...everyone else. That's not an opinion, that's just hating. ""We will see"" with DeCastro. Like Heyward, we've already seen. And everyone has already seen that he's lived up to his pre-draft pedigree. There's a bit of a pattern with the last two points: Neither position can easily be gauged with statistics. 34 DE and OG. Just a guess, could be wrong, OP seems like an avid fantasy football player, which is a great way to make yourself really bad at player evaluations if you're not a huge fan of real football. Which, again, appears to be the case with OP. Didn't trade up to take Jarvis. Not sure where in the world OP got that idea. Only trade we made in that draft was to give up our 2014 3rd rounder, while correctly expecting to have the top compensatory pick thanks to Mike Wallace, in exchange for the 4th rounder that was used on Shamarko.   Ok so I did sprinkle some opinion in there, but Woodley, Heyward and DeCastro being good (past and/or present tense) are closer to ""fact"" than ""opinion."" And besides that, uninformed and irrational opinions don't need to be respected. Saying that an idea is an ""opinion"" is not a shield against criticism and ridicule. If I were of the opinion that the Earth is flat and panda bears are forming an evil plot to destroy America as we know it and replace it with their own sovereign nation, is this opinion to be respected? Or would you think I'm a goddamn moron? Let alone the ridiculous ""opinions"" that are in no way founded on facts and reality in that post, a lot of the undeniable facts were wrong too, and OP is rightfully being downvoted to oblivion."

He had 13 passes defended last season which is by far a career high and it looks like he can play inside in the nickel and outside as well.  I'd like the signing but it certainly won't mean CB isn't a need going forward.
steelers,2z92vc,fatguyinakilt,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:25:47 2015 UTC,Agreed would still hope to see a CB drafted early.
steelers,2z92vc,SleestakLightning,2,Mon Mar 16 18:26:51 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that doesn't want anything to do with Greg Hardy?  I don't know if he's mentally ill or maybe brain-damaged, but either way, I don't think he'd be anything but trouble."
steelers,2z92vc,fatguyinakilt,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:32:47 2015 UTC,If the Steelers are willing to keep awful humans like James Harrison and Ernie Holmes around then Hardy shouldn't be a problem.
steelers,2z92vc,SleestakLightning,2,Tue Mar 17 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"James has gone over the line, albeit and arbitrary one, on the field with his physical style of play, but why do you call him an awful human? To me there is a vast difference between hitting someone late or head-to-head in football and committing crimes off of the field. I am not aware of him being involved in anything like that, but maybe I am wrong.  I know you have stated that you have been in the locker room on a regular basis so I assume you have a basis for making the statement. I am just curious what that is."

steelers,2z92vc,Diarygirl,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:26:39 2015 UTC,I agree. But that's not something the Steelers or any NFL team can do anything about so I can't say he should be punished or unemployed because of it.

I mean, the woman's story sounds ridiculous.  Throwing her down on a couch on top of 25 to 30 guns seems ludicrous, but he did get arrested and he was ordered to turn in his guns.  It makes me wonder why he has so many.    If someone wants to tell me I'm wrong or enlighten me, that's fine."

steelers,2z69hs,knightro2323,2,Sun Mar 15 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"I really like the first three picks and i'm glad that you ended up with Harold over Dupree as I feel he fits what the Steelers need way better than Dupree does.  Not a fan of the 4th round though as I don't feel the Steelers should double dip at CB unless said CB is clearly the best player available (also I don't like Kevin White because he's undersize, has stiff hips, and the Steelers don't need another slot CB) and Nick O'Leary's extremely short arms and lack of athleticism pretty much damn him to being a career H-back in the NFL because he's going to have very tough time getting separation from NFL players or making contested grabs down field."

Kevin White is also a very solid corner. He completely shut down WVU's Kevin White, who is most likely a top ten pick, and his game is really improving. I'd love to see him join the black and gold."

steelers,2z69hs,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Tue Mar 17 12:24:36 2015 UTC,I disagree. A project is a guy who needs a ton of work to be NFL ready i.e. Bud Dupree or Randy Gregory who both need significant work before they can make any kind of impact in the pros.  Harold needs to learn to play better in space but as far as pass rushing skills go he's more than ready to contribute early on as a pass rushing specialist due to his skills and translatable NFL physical attributes (namely his burst and hand fighting skills).
steelers,2z69hs,CeeBeast,2,Mon Mar 16 05:22:18 2015 UTC,"I see flashes of his hand fighting skills, and he flashes multiple pass rushing moves, but he hasn't been able to put them all together from the tape I've watched. From what I've seen, he's athletically gifted but he hasn't been able to use his hands and strength enough for me to consider him technically sound. Maybe I need to watch more of him, but to me he's a project."
steelers,2z69hs,SicaBiasThrowaway,2,Mon Mar 16 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"It seems we have different definitions of what constitutes a project player. You won't find many guys who consistently exhibit great hand fighting and pass rushing moves in college and guys who do (Vic Beasley, Dante Fowler Jr.) tend to get drafted very early. The fact that he has shown these skills to develop though puts him above the real project pass rushers of this draft (Dupree, Gregory, and maybe Shane Ray) and keeps him out of project territory. He needs to get stronger (not as badly as Jarvis Jones did) and he needs to develop his cover skills but you find many incoming rookie OLB who don't need to work on that."
steelers,2z69hs,SicaBiasThrowaway,2,Mon Mar 16 05:31:24 2015 UTC,"I guess we do. He's not the biggest project, so maybe I exaggerated, but someone who only flashes good technique and often got by on athleticism to me is a project."

steelers,2z69hs,jfuss04,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:31:28 2015 UTC,I really don't like this.  I like the Kikaha pick but the other picks don't excite me. I'd much rather see Maxx Williams in the first than Eli Harold.
steelers,2z69hs,SleestakLightning,4,Mon Mar 16 00:41:18 2015 UTC,"What would've you done then? look at the board and tell me the players you'd like for us.  Maxx was also an option, but we'd like him more in a trade down situation."
steelers,2z69hs,SleestakLightning,2,Mon Mar 16 00:53:00 2015 UTC,I would've gone with Maxx Williams. I could also live with La'el Collins or Eddie Goldman.  The Steelers lost to Baltimore because they got manhandled at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. Upgrading either line would be a good idea.  3rd round -- Devin Funchess (since you didn't get Williams) or Duke Johnson. I guess Carter's not a bad pick considering the circumstances.
steelers,2z69hs,HistrionicDrummer,3,Mon Mar 16 01:41:44 2015 UTC,"Our OL had a great year under Munchak and we have bigger needs to take care of in the first, the same goes to Goldman and the fact that we have two guys at the position.  Funchess is a WR, we dont need another one of those early, not a TE and DeAngelo Williams basically extinguished the need for a backup RB unless some incredible talent comes up in the later rounds."
steelers,2z69hs,HistrionicDrummer,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:52:10 2015 UTC,"Funchess is huge. He can absolutely play tight end.  They lost in the playoffs because the O-Line got their ass handed to them. So did the D-Line. Staying with the status quo at each position and reaching for a CB because ""team needs"" is not how the Steelers operate, nor should they."

Also, Tuitt is also more of the refined player overall IMO, not to mention more versatile."
steelers,2z3m2h,Kofile,9,Sun Mar 15 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"McCullers is the exact opposite of what this article says. He's a run stuffer who holds the point of attack and clogs the middle, not a pocket busting pass rusher. Want to know how to ruin your run defense? Tell the 360 pound guy in the middle to keep running after the QB."
steelers,2z3m2h,hempauthority,10,Sun Mar 15 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"I understand your point but I think you're missing what the article is actually saying about him.  With McCuller's size and playing out of the DT of NT position, he  could potentially move the point of attack inward, shrinking the pocket and putting the pressure on the QB and making room for a trailing LB to get around blocks - think about how Farrior used to do a stunted pass-rush after Hampton ate up a double team and you'd be on the right track."

While I still think McLendon ends up starting all year if healthy McCullers will definitely cut into his snaps and provide valuable depth.  As far as depth I'm intrigued by the Stanford D-lineman David Parry and Henry Anderson as both guys should be available in the middle rounds and have the potential to be solid, long term backups.

steelers,2z24fb,dj0,9,Sat Mar 14 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll start.  1)  I miss physical football.  I understand they're worried about concussions, but still, the rules are not universally enforced.  Ben and a smaller QB could get the same hit but the guy hitting Ben doesn't get a penalty, apparently because they think he's a big guy and can take it.  I strongly believe that some QBs flop just to get a penalty.  3)  I miss Hines too.  Damn, that smile was glorious.  AB's got a glorious smile too.  6)  Absolutely.  I'm glad we've got Ben for 5 more years.  It would be horrible if he didn't retire with us.  It's a damn shame his legacy will always be tarnished by the assault allegations.  I believe he's guilty of being young and stupid but that's all.  I know you didn't bring this up but it's the elephant in the room.  I sometimes wonder what he would have to do to repair his reputation.  I have a scenario in my head where he rushes into a burning building and rescues some puppies, and people still being assholes about him.  7)  Phil Simms annoys me but not to the degree of some others.  He beats the hell out of Joe Buck, anyway.  I think he's definitely got some brain damage.  Sure, Jon Gruden doesn't make sense sometimes either, but I've pictured him drinking during the games.  Also, I'm one of those people that Flacco is grossly overrated.  I truly don't understand why people call him elite."
steelers,2z24fb,Diarygirl,3,Sat Mar 14 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"For your point about 3, I agree that AB has a GOAT smile. The thing with Ward though, is how much it got under the skin of opponents. It doesn't matter if he got laid out by a defender or if he had a monster block against a defender, he would always pop right up, glowing.  Today's Simms is frustrating because he seems like he doesn't know what he's saying when he starts talking. He starts a point, babbles for a while, and then just trails off or stops talking all together. He almost never makes sense. Buck is a smug asshole, but he's at least funny or sarcastic occasionally. Gruden is awesome. He's one of the most ""into it"" commentators in the NFL, and even when he says something ridiculous, it (usually) has a certain degree of sense to it. You just have to squint a bit."

steelers,2z24fb,SleestakLightning,5,Mon Mar 16 10:48:12 2015 UTC,"Perfect analogy! Hahaha. We just love to hate each other. I've always thought of it more like you guys are the Joker to our Batman ;)   But really, you guys have a great team and my two favorite games of the year are Steelers at M&T Bank and Steelers at ketchup stadium."
steelers,2z24fb,Steinerway,3,Mon Mar 16 13:41:18 2015 UTC,I miss that defense.  That is all.
steelers,2z24fb,Steinerway,3,Sun Mar 15 08:48:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree on Arians.   A lot of the problems with that offense stem back to the o-line. Plus, look at Ben's weapons. He had Hines and Santonio and Heath and nothing. When Mewelde Moore is your #1 RB, you're fucked.  2008 might be my favorite season of football ever though because that defense was just so, so good and Ben willed the offense to score just enough. That entire season was, to me, proof of Ben's Hall Of Fame status (even in spite of his numbers).  Just an awful o-line, no real weapons, and time after time after time Ben found a way to turn it on at the absolute perfect moment and carry the team to a win."
steelers,2z24fb,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Mar 15 03:28:51 2015 UTC,"Arians could have done a lot to help overcome the bad offensive line, but he didn't. He could have utilized Heath as even more of a receiving weapon, but he didn't. Arians wanted a vertical passing attack to outside receivers and he was going to run that offense no matter what his personnel was. Haley's first year didn't see players all that overwhelmingly different than what Arians had, yet 2012 still started out much better and more efficient than anything Arians ever produced until Ben broke his collarbone on just the 18th sack of the season in the 9th game. Again, a better pace than anything Arians had Ben on.  Sure the OL and skill players weren't stellar, but Arians' incompetence made them even worse than they were."
steelers,2z24fb,SleestakLightning,0,Sun Mar 15 21:16:42 2015 UTC,He couldn't utilize Heath because he needed the extra blocker.
steelers,2z24fb,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Mar 15 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"He needed the extra blocker because he called 5 to 7 step drop passes. Call smarter plays to get the ball out quickly, don't put your offensive line in a position to hold blocks for as long, you can utilize your TE to the best of his abilities.  Edit: In this sub, one of the things that's guaranteed to get you at least one or two downvotes is the truth about Bruce Arians' inexcusable incompetence as a playcaller. I honestly don't know why Steelers fans who watched from 2007 through 2011 have really any positive things to say about him as a play caller. He made below average players appear as if they were among the worst in the league, and elite players brought down to merely ""good."" There is nothing anyone can be honest about to pretend Arians did any good for the team beyond being a friend to Ben and the players.  If it was just the players, then drafting better players would have been enough. But it wasn't. The team fired Arians, and rightfully so. Two years and three or four Roethlisberger injuries too late, but at least it was done."
steelers,2z24fb,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:33:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100% on this. Arians might have brought us success, but there's a reason that Ben got injured so often. Arians puts his QBs at risk, and has never made any effort to adjust that."
steelers,2z24fb,provolone12,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:18:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah the guy had no response so he just downvoted me hence my edit, but he had no response because there is no response. Arians was terrible. I was fed up with him in 2009, and sobbed tears of joy when he was finally fired three years later. He made the players seem worse than they really were. He was going to run his scheme no matter what his players' strengths and weaknesses were, and if it exposed his players' weaknesses then so be it. As opposed to Haley, who tailors and adjusts his scheme depending on his players' strengths to utilize what they're good at. No amount of success Arians has elsewhere will change that."
steelers,2z24fb,xDalexx,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"In 2008? It's completely false to say that Ben had no weapons. Hines Ward is an amazing receiver, Miller is Miller and we all love him for a that, Holmes and Washington were both good, Fast Willie was amazing, and Moore was a solid backup. Also had Spaeth, who (again) isn't amazing, but solid.  And having the number one defense always helps. You say that Ben win in spite of his oline, but I would say the defense won in spite of the offense. Ben had clutch moments, but he was not the elite QB that he is now.  Arians may have had an effective scheme, but it is not safe or particularly smart."
steelers,2z24fb,meowdy,1 point,Sun Mar 15 12:15:42 2015 UTC,"Mewelde Moore was the most effective running back that season. Spaeth is not a real offense weapon.   They had two guys with more than 3 receiving TDs. Outside of those two guys, the rest of their skill players either sucked or were marginalized because of the poor offensive line play (Miller).   Ben was absolutely the elite QB he is now. That's a pretty dumb statement to make. If you base things solely on numbers, sure. But if you actually watched the games there were numerous games where as good as the defense was the offense was absolutely putrid until Ben found a way to make one or two crucial plays to score enough points to win.  Arians' scheme ""failed"" because the o-line sucked."
steelers,2z24fb,christhesexyone,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:46:24 2015 UTC,"I see the points you're making, but doesn't that also sort of work towards what I'm trying to say? If the O-line is so bad that they can't protect Ben, doesn't that make Arians constantly calling dropback, long-ball plays even worse?  And I wasn't trying to insinuate that Ben was bad back then, but you can't seriously say that he hasn't improved in the last seven years. He is far better now than he was then. I would 100% not call 2008 Ben an ""elite"" QB, in the true sense of the word."
steelers,2z24fb,A__Black__Guy,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:57:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, Arians never adjusted. But they won a Super Bowl.  You would be 100% wrong to say Ben wasn't an ""elite"" quarterback in 2008. Has he improved? Who knows. His performance and stats are much better now mostly due to the offense they run now and an improved offensive line."
steelers,2z24fb,IdunnoLXG,0,Sun Mar 15 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"That's where I would say that the defense won in spite of Arians' offense. They definitely bailed out a stalling offense plenty of times that season. And I'm not saying that to take anything away from the offense, either. Of course, we never would have won the Super Bowl without Ben and Holmes being clutch as all hell on the last drive. Even then though, Warner had enough time to make a game-winning drive of his own, but Woodley ended the drive with his sack.  Honestly, after going back and watching the two games (so far) from this DVD, it's just really pretty clear to me how much Ben as improved. Was he a bad QB in 2008? Of course not. But he looked closer to an Alex Smith than a 2015 Ben. It might be because of a bad O-line, it might be because of worse weapons, it might be because of a scheme that put him at risk, it could be all of these things. I'm just saying, watching 2008 compared to 2015, he looks like a totally different player.  By the way, can I just say thanks for having a civil discussion? It seems too often on this sub that discussions like this just get downvoted and ignored."
steelers,2z28dm,huet99,14,Sat Mar 14 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"This time last year we were super worried about offense. We had our rookie RB and two of our three WRs were free agents, which then went to other teams. All we knew we had was Ben, Brown and Heath. Even going into this off-season, none of our big offensive players are FAs and we're just worried about patching up our defense, knowing that our offense can get us through some bad times if need be. We don't need to much to feel confident going into this season."
steelers,2z28dm,fauxedo,18,Sat Mar 14 22:10:26 2015 UTC,Not to mention the O Line. This is the first time in years that we've had an O Line that I'm confident will be dominant.
steelers,2z28dm,dj0,2,Sat Mar 14 22:21:16 2015 UTC,"I think they'll be above average. Dominant is an outside possibility but in order for that to happen Gilbert, Foster, and DeCastro need to become more consistent. All 3 have brain farts out there at times."
steelers,2z28dm,k__e__n,2,Sun Mar 15 21:08:56 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about DeCastro. The other two are more mistake prone but are still good linemen.
steelers,2z28dm,dj0,2,Sun Mar 15 23:12:09 2015 UTC,Decastro is their second best lineman... most people thought he was a pro bowl snub.

steelers,2z28dm,Steinerway,3,Tue Mar 17 11:51:25 2015 UTC,"I can't think of any reason to have been super worried about the offense last year.  Healthy OL coached by the newly hired Mike Munchak, arguably best OL coach of the past two decades, featuring Maurkice Pouncey and David DeCastro extensively together for the first time ever (DeCastro missed all but three games of 2012, Pouncey missed all but 8 snaps in 2013), which would build upon the OL that gave up just 7 sacks in the final 7 games and obviously would help Le'Veon Bell actually put the potential he showed during the regular season to good use. Healthy TEs whose strengths, among other things, is blocking. Miller missed the first three games and was still recovering from the ACL and Spaeth missed all but 3 games in 2013. A tall and fast receiver that Ben had been begging for for nearly a decade. I don't know anyone who didn't think Martavis Bryant was a steal, I was hoping for him in the 2nd round if we didn't take Kelvin Benjamin first. Lance Moore, who when healthy had always been a great and reliable target in New Orleans. The only ""gamble"" was that Markus Wheaton would handle the heavier workload, and it just turned out that he was even better than Moore.  It simply made sense that the offense would be even better than the one that exploded for over 28 points per game in the final 9 games of 2013. It was wishful thinking that extenuating circumstances that led to 8-8 were legitimate signs of a downfall rather than genuine predictions and analysis, and this team proved it last season. Just a case of those wishful thinkers saying it so often that ""It must be true,"" so even Steelers fans believed it themselves. But no, there was absolutely no reason to be concerned for the offense heading into last year, and now we know why."
steelers,2z28dm,fauxedo,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:23:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but a lot do that was information we didn't have this time last year. I was much more excited after the draft and all of our FA signings, but starting FA we were still very much in the dark."
steelers,2z28dm,Steinerway,1 point,Mon Mar 16 00:53:16 2015 UTC,"The only things that were ""new"" were Moore and Bryant.

steelers,2z28dm,fishbulb00,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"I really don't think the concerns of Steelers' fans have changed in the last several years so, speak for yourself, I guess.  Especially with the addition of Munchak and all those high draft picks on the offensive line, this time last off-season most of the people I knew were cautiously optimistic about our offense but terrified about what would become of our defense, which had missed on so many recent draft picks and was being held together but a bunch of rapidly aging veterans.  On a personal note, I was surprised that last season the Steelers tried to squeak another season out of both Taylor and Polamalu and I'm pretty glad that they've finally decided to move on."

Heck, humility isn't necessarily even an honest position if you're actually trying to be humble (as that means you're lying to others and yourself), and yet you're treating it as if its some sort of divinely desirable trait.  Let's try this; take two opponents, Player A and Player B.  Player B can throw a football a maximum of 80 yards, Player A can throw a football a football a maximum of 40 yards.  Which player is better at throwing a football farther?  The obvious, easy, and honest answer is Player B, there is no lack of humility in knowing that fact, and being able to throw the ball farther doesn't make Player B less humble...humility would only come into play if Player B belittles Player A for not being able to throw as far when there are other desirable traits such as accuracy and decision making that might make Player A a better overall passer."

Will have to wait till after the draft to get a better judgement of the defense at least. My only other real worry is the fact that we have a crazy hard schedule this coming year and will most likely be a trial by fire situation.
steelers,2z28dm,PomfAndCircvmstance,7,Sat Mar 14 22:41:28 2015 UTC,"It feels weird to be confident in others.  I know we're pretty good. Honestly, we are.

We just happen to be one of many.  I'm confident we can beat the teams I am confident can beat us.  The place I lack confidence is injuries. If we can stay healthier than our rivals, we're fine."

Now Peyton is a year older, the Patriots have lost some talent, and I  still feel the Steelers are more talented as a whole than the Colts or Ravens.  The offense should only improve with familiarity and i'm confident the defense will be better this year than it was last year. Assuming the coaching staff doesn't fuck things up and the Steelers have another solid draft there's no reason the Steelers shouldn't once again be right in the thick of the AFC playoff race."

steelers,2z28dm,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Mar 15 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"I'm more referring to their play last year, as they were pretty successful with no corners, crappy safeties, and little to no pass rush which should at least get slightly better this year. My main concern about their offense this year was their #2 back, but now they have solved that by signing Williams. I am also really excited about the D line of Tuitt, Mclendon, and Heyward."
steelers,2z28dm,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Mar 15 03:29:22 2015 UTC,"Their numbers were misleading though. The defense really looked great in a couple of games but was pretty bad for the rest.  They were near last in the league in yards allowed per drive and in the bottom 10 in points per drive which are two indicators that they couldn't stop anyone.  The defense would have looked even worse if the offense wasn't #1 in average TOP per drive. They kept the defense off the field. When the defense was out there, they were pretty awful."
steelers,2z28dm,Kofile,2,Sun Mar 15 03:35:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That's my whole point. They were successful as a team with a crappy defense. The offseason/ draft will give them a chance to improve that defense and get healthy. If they were good with a bad defense, imagine what they might be with an average one."
steelers,2z28dm,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Mar 15 03:39:48 2015 UTC,That's a good point. But so far they've done nothing to address the defense and to make it better.   And there's no guarantee they'll be able to address all the defensive needs in the draft.
steelers,2z28dm,Kofile,2,Sun Mar 15 03:41:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that they will. But even if they get a half-way decent edge rusher, corner, or safety, their defense will probably improve."
steelers,2z28dm,SleestakLightning,2,Sun Mar 15 04:05:01 2015 UTC,Well yeah but that's easier said than done. Especially on a team notorious for never playing rookies.
steelers,2z28dm,Kofile,1 point,Sun Mar 15 04:16:12 2015 UTC,"I'm confident in the players, not in the scheme.  9/17 games last season the Steelers offense scored less than 20 points.   I want to see more consistency in the game plan/play calling and using the weapons Pittsburgh has amassed to their fullest potential every week.   The team has the tendency to ""ease"" into games and play ultra conservative far too often for my liking. CLE 2 and the Jets game (even though there are others) immediately come to kind.   37.5% of 7's TDS came from the 2 games of 6TDS (12/32), which means that throughout the remaining 14 games Pittsburgh averaged 1.5 Passing TDS's / game (counting AB's line passing TD. If this isn't counted, it's 1.42).  I'm not bitching about the yardage the team put out, what I'm wanting about is a more efficient offense that doesn't leave as many points on the field and doesn't leave a ton of ""empty"" yards on the field.

If we get a good DB in the draft we might go a step higher than last year.  However, the schedule will put us to the test."

Our lack of depth at every offensive position is frightening, I expect our draft to look like OLB, OL, NT, CB, CB, S, OLB/NT/RB, with BPA being a precursor in every round."

So much rides on the health of the defense as a whole, and especially the OLB's and CB's. If Jervis can be healthy.. I wouldn't be pissed at all with 4-8 sacks as a rotational player. With Shaz, I just want him to be healthy."

Shazy had a few missed coverages in the NO game that I remember, but I can't remember any other times he stood out as the weak link, and for a rookie that's pretty good. I agree that our defense depends on our starters being healthy, we don't really have the second or third guy to plug in and play well like some teams do (freakin SF lost all their starters and they're still in a good position with their depth). We'll see how the draft shakes out, I've got a feeling the days of sitting rookies for a couple years are over and if we can land a couple decent producers through the draft, I think we'll be better than last year."

steelers,2z0oe9,yeshua1986,1 point,Sat Mar 14 23:23:55 2015 UTC,He's eating up almost all of the $25m we cleared:  http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cap/
steelers,2z0oe9,smacksaw,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"Uh, whats your source. Your link says we have $25 mil in cap like you said.  Doesnt have Bens year 1 salary tho, where did you find that (serious question)  Edit: We are gonna save another million this year with Bens new deal,"
steelers,2z0oe9,lurkedlongtime,2,Sun Mar 15 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"If they dont constantly restructure him, his cap hit next year only goes up 1 mil from what it is this year from the restructurings."
steelers,2z0oe9,Swazi,2,Sat Mar 14 16:57:55 2015 UTC,I heard it's only a million more than we paid him last year in terms of cap space.  Good deal all around really.
steelers,2z0oe9,svenhoek86,10,Sat Mar 14 22:12:10 2015 UTC,Great success!
steelers,2z0oe9,madeforinglip,9,Sat Mar 14 14:01:02 2015 UTC,"With most of our offensive line locked in for the next several years, this is good news. Keep Ben upright and look at the results. Plenty of time to get him more rings."
steelers,2z0oe9,ProfessorChaos5049,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:03:34 2015 UTC,"Having Bell back there helps just as much as the line, as we saw by his absence in the Ravens loss. The threat of him catching dump offs out of the backfield prevents defenses from being able to blitz as much or send as many rushers as they otherwise would, since they have to keep an eye on him. Without him, the Ravens just teed off on Ben all night."

steelers,2z0oe9,foot56,1 point,Sun Mar 15 13:42:12 2015 UTC,True. I believe he has 1 year left with a 5th year option.
steelers,2z0oe9,ProfessorChaos5049,9,Sun Mar 15 16:16:45 2015 UTC,I'm glad we got our #1 priority done early. Hopefully we can sign a CB and/or a OLB now!
steelers,2z0oe9,AssassinPanda97,7,Sat Mar 14 15:27:28 2015 UTC,Patrick Robinson is visiting. Hopefully they can get him.
steelers,2z0oe9,Kofile,3,Sat Mar 14 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"He's a good replacement for Brice McCain, but he's not a #1 CB. I hope we can trade for Keenan Lewis, but I doubt it will happen."
steelers,2z0oe9,AssassinPanda97,5,Sat Mar 14 17:52:24 2015 UTC,At this point I'd rather have depth than have a #1 guy. The secondary is basically in dire straits.

Its been a remarkable run, and I'm as grateful as a fan can be to say he was the qb of MY Steelers. My dad had the Steel Curtain era. I had Ben, Troy, the Bus, Hines, and the Silverback.

steelers,2z0oe9,smacksaw,2,Sat Mar 14 17:30:32 2015 UTC,confirmed? 9 lombardies by the time bens deal is done?
steelers,2z0oe9,A__Black__Guy,2,Sat Mar 14 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"Update: Albert Breer says Roethlisberger will get $65 million over the first three years of the deal (2015-17), which is a record.   So...65/3=21.66  Cap is 141.8, we have 25.7m free (did you know we went from 31st to 5th in cap space? Because we did) and then Ben is going to use 21.66 of it, so that leaves us 4m after this.  I guess we could afford it?  I need time to digest this. I was really hoping this wasn't going to be that much guaranteed money. 15% of the cap on one guy and this time it looks like there's no moving money around. We truly have to pay this annually."
steelers,2z0oe9,Button_3,2,Sun Mar 15 00:09:12 2015 UTC,"We needed to do this, and I really wish it was last year or the one before, but the salary cap is growing because of the CBA.  It will continue to grow, and QB salaries are skyrocketing.  This deal will look like a bargain in 4 years.  Look at the Flacco and Kapernick contracts."
steelers,2z0oe9,MattEven,3,Sun Mar 15 13:51:13 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how much cap this will clear this year?
steelers,2z0oe9,Pxorp,1 point,Sat Mar 14 15:40:26 2015 UTC,Does $99 million buy a Stairway to 7? Not sure but it's a hell of a start. Ben has earned every penny.

Wish I could find that moment.  All in all, a great addition.  I just hope he can stay healthy."

steelers,2yxxkv,TheRemaker,23,Fri Mar 13 19:33:03 2015 UTC,I always see these QB rankings on /r/NFL with Ben ranked 7-10 ish of top 10...but there's no other QB I'd want at the helm...good for him.
steelers,2yxxkv,jdpatric,16,Fri Mar 13 20:06:04 2015 UTC,"I realize I am a bit of a homer, but I think there is some negative bias in those results. Ben is not quite in the Manning, Brady, Rodgers conversation, but he isn't behind by much either."
steelers,2yxxkv,fatguyinakilt,7,Fri Mar 13 21:59:55 2015 UTC,I think Brees is the bridge. Brees is approaching the Manning conversation and Roethlisberger ought to be in Brees' neighbourhood at the same age. Close behind. Depends on if he hits a new gear as QBs often do at this age or not.
steelers,2yxxkv,smacksaw,4,Fri Mar 13 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Those three are on another level, speaking honestly, however I wouldn't trade them for Ben at all. In my mind Ben is a top 5 QB with Manning Brady Brees and Rodgers. The only difference is how you rank them. I count the steelers both lucky and good at draft scouting to land Ben when they did.  Herra to 3 more SB's (my homer might be showing there)"

You'll notice that with the stat whores: Manning and Brees - the only times they've won a SB is when they've had adequate running games and not too shabby of a defense. in other words, in complete contradiction of how you would expect them to win given their team composition/philosophy"
steelers,2yxxkv,TyroneBiggums93,4,Sat Mar 14 06:47:49 2015 UTC,Lol @ Romo being ahead of him in the latest ranking. Even Luck being ahead of him is arguable.
steelers,2yxxkv,Kofile,5,Sat Mar 14 00:28:18 2015 UTC,What exactly has luck done that Ben didn't do in his first two years? It's fucking insulting
steelers,2yxxkv,TyroneBiggums93,3,Sat Mar 14 06:48:20 2015 UTC,I guess the amount of passing yards..but that's more a function of the new NFL. And he turns the ball over like it's his job. It's too early to put him above a two time champ coming off a huge season.
steelers,2yxxkv,Kofile,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"Comparing someone that will end up throwing for over 50,000 yards to somebody who hasn't even played 5 seasons is fucking hilarious.

steelers,2yxxkv,steelflapjack,5,Sat Mar 14 16:34:45 2015 UTC,I'm just hoping Ben realizes it's nice to have a well paid line and receivers and remembers he's made $80 million-ish already.
steelers,2yxxkv,Scrubsisalright,5,Fri Mar 13 20:14:30 2015 UTC,$105. He could def take a team-friendly deal  http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers/ben-roethlisberger/cash-earnings/

steelers,2yxxkv,iliekdrugs,3,Fri Mar 13 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"And he's earned what he's already made, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a big contract (that he's well worth)"
steelers,2yxxkv,Indie59,2,Fri Mar 13 23:11:36 2015 UTC,"He's also one of the few elite players to receive most of his contract, regardless of guarantees, so there is definitely plenty of goodwill there."
steelers,2yxxkv,greennick,1 point,Sat Mar 14 04:24:55 2015 UTC,"Better than 5 years for $100m, got him for just $99m! Would have preferred it for less, but still alright."
steelers,2yxxkv,smacksaw,6,Sat Mar 14 14:33:39 2015 UTC,"I don't care if it is. You have to pay a QB of this calibre what that contract is worth. It sends the wrong message if we're cheaping out on our best player. If we can't pay the one guy who deserves it the most, what's the chance anyone else gets what they deserve.  This is a bullet we have to bite."
steelers,2yxxkv,steelerfaninperu,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. But it really depends on Ben's priorities.   If Ben is truly interested in winning some more trophies, then he'd understand that a few million less per year could buy him a better right tackle, or a fresh TE, or at least a DB that won't blow a TD after Ben gets done scoring one.   Nobody questions Ben's value, but he's the central cog in a large machine. The rest of the machine must function."
steelers,2yxxkv,Capricola,3,Sat Mar 14 12:43:24 2015 UTC,Sometimes he is right but Mark Madden said he is hearing 130mil for 6 years......I doubt the Steelers would ever pay that for one player.
steelers,2yxxkv,akmalhot,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:27:58 2015 UTC,21.6/yr ave? Seems really high I thought there were expecting 19-20
steelers,2yxxkv,Kofile,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:45:22 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter, Roethlisberger is WORTH the money. And especially since QB's of lower caliber such as Romo, Dalton, Kaep, and probably Wilson (just to name a few) have gotten such big contracts, his price should be high.   He's worth every penny he's paid. He shouldn't have to take a discount."

steelers,2yxxkv,WhatWhatInTheTwat,11,Fri Mar 13 21:55:50 2015 UTC,"Having a top-tier QB cripples your team salary-wise. It's like buying a Ferrari and saying ""I hope maintenance costs aren't too much, it's a valid concern.""  You want the fastest, flashiest, most exclusive car you can get, you gotta pay a lot for the little extra. What you hope is that by paying a huge percentage of the budget at the position, you get results everywhere.  At least that's how I see it. Most of these are fair deals, even Flacco. Look at the AFC East. I don't care what the Bills, Jets and Dolphins do. Without a QB like Brady, it's not as good. Brady makes the difference. So does Flacco. That guy wins divisions and goes deep into the playoffs. The Eyebrow is worth it."
steelers,2yxxkv,SH4RK_SANDWICH,4,Fri Mar 13 23:42:48 2015 UTC,"The one thing in your argument that you're missing - and that everyone else seems to be missing - is that Brady CAN easily take a team-friendly deal because of his wife being a $50 million model.   It's not the official agreement between Brady and the Pats, but it's basically ""don't fuck me off with an insulting offer and I won't fuck you off by not taking it and going into free agency.""  Besides that: I agree with your post 100%. It's the nature of the market for elite QBs. If you want to keep them, PAY them what they're worth. Ben is worth every penny of his contract."

steelers,2yzmxr,dj0,2,Sat Mar 14 13:49:47 2015 UTC,"I think he is a ""young"" 31 though. It was always running back by committee in Carolina so he might have enough in the tank for what we need from him."

All I see are his stats which show former #1 pick, one great year and few other good ones, some time missed - presumably from injury, and can catch the ball outta the backfield.  So all in all a quality backup for Bell?"
steelers,2yy4xf,ericfg,4,Sat Mar 14 02:51:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The guy has a ton of talent, although he's a bit more on the seasoned side as far as RBs go. He did have some injury issues (as you referenced), but when he was on the field, he routinely had YPC over 4.5 and 5.0 during his career. He's a terrific all around back.  BUT, his skill on the field is surpassed by the person he is. The consummate teammate going back to his time at Memphis, he was a leader in Carolina and in the community. He's very active in fundraising especially for Breast Cancer - he even died his dreads pink for breast cancer awareness last year.  Tremendous pick up - especially for the role the Steelers will ask him to play."

steelers,2z01rt,Diarygirl,2,Sat Mar 14 07:45:16 2015 UTC,"I like this trend.  If you invest it right, you don't ever have to worry about money ever again.  What's the point of being rich when you can't move without pain, and you can't remember people's names?   There's been a big push to pay college football players, and I don't know how I feel about that, but I wish more athletes worried about actually getting an education.  I know I'm old-fashioned, but I think if you get a scholarship they have an obligation to actually educate you."
steelers,2yz764,i_Jam17,12,Sat Mar 14 01:49:38 2015 UTC,"Overall he's mediocre. But let's compare him with McCain since that's who we just lost. Robinson is a marginally better player, he's a year younger, and he's a couple inches taller. If the price is similar I'd call this a win. Not a big win or anything, just a small improvement and perhaps a bit more flexibility since 5'11"" is a better height for an outside guy than 5'9"" is."
steelers,2yz764,Intropy_,21,Sat Mar 14 04:25:48 2015 UTC,WRONG SAINTS CB
steelers,2yz764,Winf13ld,4,Sat Mar 14 02:15:13 2015 UTC,I know I want Keenan back as well but the fact of the matter is the dude wants to stay in New Orleans. It's his home and the saints are working on his contract to keep him around.
steelers,2yz764,heavymedicine,5,Sat Mar 14 02:37:20 2015 UTC,"I think him or Keenan would be nice additions. Landing Either one we need to be grateful for.  Basically Patrick is much cheaper. He can play outside but he excels in the slot. The fact we are bringing him in , is a good sign we will be giving him an offer. He has interest from a few other teams."
steelers,2yz764,Poshmidget,5,Sat Mar 14 02:17:43 2015 UTC,Right now he's a decent number 2 corner and he has really nice potential. I see low risk high reward in him.
steelers,2yz764,DKnight32x,5,Sat Mar 14 04:47:31 2015 UTC,So basically a trademark steelers signing.
steelers,2yz764,Flexidry_,3,Sat Mar 14 06:05:43 2015 UTC,Keenan is staying in NO.
steelers,2yz764,SleestakLightning,5,Sat Mar 14 02:20:58 2015 UTC,"Meh. Those who felt the problem with the defense was at the CB position won't be too thrilled with this move, Robinson's just better than average.  That said if this team had some real pass rushers the DBs wouldn't really matter."
steelers,2yz764,bryansnameistaken,6,Sat Mar 14 04:33:52 2015 UTC,"I think that"" just better than average,"" would be a welcome addition to our secondary"
steelers,2yz764,SleestakLightning,0,Sat Mar 14 13:12:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on his strengths and weaknesses.  I don't think he's an outside corner. If I'm right, and he's basically just a nickel corner then there's no need because we have Big Play Bill Gay for that.  If I'm wrong (not usual, but it does happen) and he's an outside guy then sign him up because we desperately need a Top 2 zone corner.   Then again, I wouldn't be surprised to see Cortez Allen bounce back and become the player they thought he could."
steelers,2yz764,TitoTheMidget,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:25:48 2015 UTC,"That said if this team had some real pass rushers the DBs wouldn't really matter.   I thoroughly disagree with this. The zone-blitz ""just pressure the passer and the secondary will all work out"" approach worked before the league shifted to short, accurate passes and throwing the ball 45+ times a game. Given enough attempts at open receivers, NFL QBs will make big plays. The pass rush isn't going to get to the QB every time."
steelers,2yz764,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sun Mar 15 02:46:04 2015 UTC,And yet year after year the teams that win are ones who generate a pass rush and pressure the QB.
steelers,2yz764,TitoTheMidget,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:07:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as part of a total package. They don't do it at the expense of good coverage."
steelers,2yz764,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:27:55 2015 UTC,And nowhere did I say any different.  I just said a good pass rush negates the need to have great coverage in the secondary.  The Steelers play zone so they're never really going to blanket the receivers all that much. They put an emphasis on stopping the run and tackling the catch. That's how they teach their corners to play.  In that scheme you need a pass rush to be successful.
steelers,2yz764,TitoTheMidget,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:31:15 2015 UTC,"The Steelers play zone so they're never really going to blanket the receivers all that much. They put an emphasis on stopping the run and tackling the catch. That's how they teach their corners to play.   This is a far cry from the DBs ""not really mattering,"" though. They're still an important part of the scheme, they just do different things than DBs in other schemes do."
steelers,2yz764,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:34:53 2015 UTC,"You're misinterpreting what I said. I said they ""don't really matter"" because if you pressure the QB, most of the time he's dumping it off or you're hitting him and sacking him.   The Steelers won Super Bowls with corners not much better than what they had last year. You can look at the drop off in defense and conclude three major changes: Hampton/Farrior/Smith retiring, Troy's play declining, and the loss of Woodley."
steelers,2yz764,TitoTheMidget,2,Sun Mar 15 03:39:15 2015 UTC,"Alright, I see what you're saying. I think we're on the same page now."
steelers,2yz764,JinKazamaAndJuice,4,Sun Mar 15 03:40:08 2015 UTC,I think 9 interceptions in what amounts to 2 regular seasons beats the hell out of what we were doing last year. I welcome him to the team if we decide to sign him.

steelers,2yz764,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sun Mar 15 02:06:38 2015 UTC,He's a good slot corner but he's mediocre as an outside guy. I'd like him a lot more if the Steelers didn't already have William Gay who is a  good slot CB but not so great as an outside guy.
steelers,2yzcm8,bigllamas,12,Sat Mar 14 02:42:44 2015 UTC,Just a fifth round pick? Was he taking up too much cap space?
steelers,2yzcm8,WildBananna,16,Sat Mar 14 04:00:18 2015 UTC,Yes.
steelers,2yzcm8,fauxedo,15,Sat Mar 14 04:08:59 2015 UTC,"He was taking up over $12,000,000 in cap space. Also he's kind of a dick and doesn't gel well with Ryan Tannehill due to Tannehill having a mediocre deep ball and Wallace being pretty meh at everything but being a deep threat."
steelers,2yzcm8,PomfAndCircvmstance,6,Sat Mar 14 04:24:46 2015 UTC,"This! A thousand times this! With Bens cannon of an arm, this is what made him a threat.  On a side note, I was unbeatable in madden with Ben and Wallace. Hailmary for days."

steelers,2yzcm8,TryingToHaveGoodMood,1 point,Sun Mar 15 02:27:26 2015 UTC,It's relevant because of the recent post of AB saying #bringmikeback or whatever and everyone thinking it could happen (lol)
steelers,2yzcm8,autopilot_music,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:44:44 2015 UTC,"So link the tweet or comment in that thread? A little unneccessary to bring up every ex-Steeler in this sub when they really don't have anything to do with the team or the direction they are going. I'd understand if there was serious consideration by the team to bring this guy back, but no, it's a buddy's tweet and speculation by the sub. Likewise with the Woodley threads, what relevance is there to a guy with nothing but a history with the team years ago? /rant"
steelers,2yzcm8,TryingToHaveGoodMood,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:26:02 2015 UTC,Theres relevance because several people thought there was a possibility.  I'm glad you realize that it wasn't going to happen but don't try to deny the relevance. This isn't a very active sub anyway. Probably about ten of the posts on its front page right now are just announcements of ben's contract. You're upset for no reason.
steelers,2yzcm8,autopilot_music,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:30:28 2015 UTC,"Ben's contract situation is relevant to the roster and the cap. There was no one from the Steelers putting forth interest in Wallace other than AB. A link about Wallace's signing with the Vikings is relevant in /r/nfl, not this sub. Offseason and inactivity is no excuse for downgrading the quality of posts. Would it be relevant if Pouncey's brother got traded to the Jets or Shaq Richardson got dropped from another team's practice squad? No, because it has no bearing on the current team or it's direction. The only thing relevant about this situation was AB's tweet, and that had it's own thread. This news has no relevance to the current team."
steelers,2yzcm8,TryingToHaveGoodMood,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:53:06 2015 UTC,"i know why Ben's contract is relevant. What I'm saying is, there have been multiple lists of the exact same info."
steelers,2yzcm8,autopilot_music,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:06:31 2015 UTC,So because there are multiple posts about a relevant topic it's ok to post irrelevant information? I'm not following your logic here mate.

steelers,2ywm4v,Blownbunny,12,Fri Mar 13 19:13:54 2015 UTC,"As a Louisville Cardinals fan, and with Tomlin just having taken a couple of our guys out to dinner, I'd love to see Lorenzo Mauldin get looked at for the draft.  Fantastic outside pass rusher in college in one of the top defenses in the NCAA. He bounced between DE and OLB, but his size will match up perfectly with the current LB corps. If we snatched him up and gave him a year of studying under Harrison, he'd be a nightmare.  And he's a stand up dude with a great story. Serious team leader, overcame a ton of obstacles. He'd be a perfect candidate to be a Steeler."
steelers,2ywm4v,Dead_Starks,25,Fri Mar 13 15:03:02 2015 UTC,Nice try Lorenzo
steelers,2ywm4v,ImPhelpsingIt,5,Fri Mar 13 15:18:04 2015 UTC,Louisville SteelerNation represent! Mauldin would be an awesome fit. Since I can't watch him on the Cards anymore I would love to see him in the black and gold.
steelers,2ywm4v,Dead_Starks,3,Fri Mar 13 18:23:23 2015 UTC,Mauldin is my best case scenario in the 2nd round. Go Cards.
steelers,2ywm4v,Splinter15,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:50:27 2015 UTC,I saw a few mock projections that had us taking him in the third round. The more I thought about it today I really hope we take him. He transitioned from DE to OLB (partly BC of the defensive scheme) and from a 4-3 to a 3-4 all while having an outstanding year. Still a long shot and we have plenty of other holes to fill right now.

steelers,2ywm4v,tylernol7,3,Fri Mar 13 15:03:00 2015 UTC,"His style isn't really coachable, either. Harrison doesn't do what he does by reading the other team, studying film, knowing what moves to use...I'm sure he does all that, but the thing that makes him good is overwhelming physical strength. It's ""I'm gonna bull rush you, just try to stop me, I'll bet you can't."" That's a tool, not a coachable skill."

St Louis has a dominant front line don't get me wrong, but as weird it is to say now we have a pretty dominant offensive line of our own.  The defense was already a sieve last year, and given that there's pretty much no place to go but up (seriously. If we weren't bottom 3, I believe we were bottom 5 in yards per play in all three categories), and the #2 offense is staying the same, so yeah I think we're in for another big year pending injuries."

steelers,2yykrd,SleestakLightning,5,Fri Mar 13 22:54:48 2015 UTC,Our secondary and OLB situation is frightening. I honestly don't believe that both can be fixed in a draft class. I really wish they could have made some attempt at a veteran in the FA.

steelers,2yykrd,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:08:49 2015 UTC,Why won't Cam Thomas play? Who is taking his spot?   Tuitt. Thomas will be a rotational player at best and still may get cut.

steelers,2yykrd,SleestakLightning,2,Sat Mar 14 04:29:58 2015 UTC,I think Shamarko hasn't really played because of LeBeau's loyalty to vets (injuries didn't help). The Steeler's wouldn't trade a pick to get someone and not play them...

Sham can be the ""heir apparent"" all he wants but he hasn't played a single down of non-special teams football in the regular season yet. Who knows if he's any good?"
steelers,2yykrd,SleestakLightning,3,Sat Mar 14 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"Worilds, McCain, Kiesel, Taylor, Polamalu, and potentially and Harrison are some pretty big changes on defense.  If Shazier, Jones, and Thomas stay healthy this year, there's no way we stay in the bottom 5 on defense."
steelers,2yykrd,DF_1982,-1,Sat Mar 14 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"Sure they can. I'm not sure what team you're watching but they have 3 OLBs (Jarvis, Moats, and Jordan Zumwalt.) Jarvis has been a bust so far, Moats is not a starter, Zumwalt has never played in a regular season game.  On the D-Line they lost their 2nd best player (Keisel), Tuitt is still developing, McLendon is alright, Cam Thomas is hot garbage.  In the secondary we've never seen what Shamarko can do. Mitchell was ass last season and may not improve this season. At corner they have Big Play Bill Gay and a whole lot of nothing behind him.  ILB is the only position on defense that's a strength."
steelers,2yykrd,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"You said ""Without changes"".  I'm just reminding you that there have already been very significant changes with many more to come.  I'm not sure what team you're watching, but If you're going to add Zumwalt to the OLB list, you should also add Howard Jones, Shawn Lemon, and Roosevelt Nix.    There's also this thing called the draft... It's when the Steelers get to pick any players they want based on who's available and what their needs are.  They just might address some of your concerns there.    They will make changes.  They will get better.  Think positive."
steelers,2yykrd,DF_1982,1 point,Sat Mar 14 15:29:38 2015 UTC,"You don't have to patronize me.   Significant changes but we have nothing to show the changes are for the better. I think Zumwalt is going to be a good OLB but until we see him in a real game, a realist would assume that he's not going to be much better than what we had last season.  When's the last time a Steelers defensive rookie made a huge impact on the team? Kendrell Bell?   I base my opinions on what we know. I need facts. There is nothing that we know for sure that says the Steelers defense is going to better."
steelers,2yykrd,SleestakLightning,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:11:32 2015 UTC,Moats has started 21 games over the past two seasons and was arguably the 2nd best OLB on the team last year. Mitchell actually looked good out there when Allen was playing a more traditional SS role whereas he looked like shit when Troy was running around the field aimlessly.

steelers,2yykrd,Diarygirl,1 point,Sat Mar 14 00:27:04 2015 UTC,"Defense needs to be improved drastically. If that happens, it only increases the chance of that happening.  Offense needs to be more consistent. 9/17 games the offense scored less than 20 points. The offensive line and skill position players have another year together and have gelled. There's no reason they shouldn't score even MORE points.   I still see at least one loss to Baltimore. They always do so much with comparatively lesser offensive talent, and always play Pittsburgh extremely tough.  Cleveland? Complete clusterfuck. They're so bad this year I don't see how they could beat Pittsburgh sans Ben being hurt or the same offensive game plan being implemented that was during CLE vs PIT #2 last year.   Cincy.. I don't know. Dalton is their weakest key offensively. I could see Pittsburgh beating them twice, but by at most 7 points.   Overall, I see a 4-2 divisional record, and I don't think anyone here would be pissed at that."
steelers,2yykrd,Kofile,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"Our starting Defense as of today:  DE: Tuitt, Heyward (B+)  NT: McClendon (B-)  ILB: Timmons, Shazier (B)  OLB: Moats, Jones (F)  CB: Gay, Allen (C)  S: Thomas, Mithcell (C+)  Now a lot about this could change with the draft (likely going to be either a CB or an EDGE sitting at our pick) as well as free agency - Roethlisberger's extension will free up even more cap space - but I have to ask.... what are we sweeping?"
steelers,2yykrd,NapoleonBlownapart87,2,Sat Mar 14 02:03:24 2015 UTC,McClendon a B- huh?  Where can I purchase some of those rose colored glasses that you're wearing?
steelers,2yykrd,fishbulb00,1 point,Sat Mar 14 05:32:05 2015 UTC,"A healthy McClendon is a slightly above average 0-technique. He played through a shoulder injury for the last 6-8 games of the season and wasn't nearly as effective as he was in the first 8-10. Is he the ideal NT for this D? No, but given the introduction of additional sub packages I think he'll be just fine this year.   Also it's kind of funny that you accuse me of having rose-colored glasses as I am actively shitting on our defense...."
steelers,2yykrd,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:33:03 2015 UTC,"Disagree on the OLB grade. Moats is more than adequate as a starter (I think he's better than Worilds, especially when it comes to run defense) and we got two games of healthy Jarvis last year (and he looked much improved). Jones had some technique issues but the talent is undoubtedly there. I imagine Butler and Porter will be working with him extensively this offseason. I imagine that one of HoJo, Zumwalt, and Lemon will be a depth option and if they bring Harrison back they may actually end up being a decent unit."
steelers,2yxy21,steelflapjack,7,Fri Mar 13 19:36:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's one of the tougher positions to draft nowadays. Far more teams run a 3-4 defense now than a couple of years ago, and pass-rushers are always at a premium.  But that doesn't erase the fact that we've been close to pathetic at acquiring OLBs. Other than Woodley in 2007, none of the other guys have shown much. Bruce Davis in 2008 was a complete bust. Jason Worilds in 2010 was good but never great. Plus he only lasted a couple of years in the league. Thaddeus Gibson in 2010 never panned out. Chris Carter in 2011 never panned out. Jarvis Jones in 2013 is still a big question mark. Zumwalt in 2014 hasn't done anything either."
steelers,2yxy21,MrGoosemahn,3,Fri Mar 13 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"Also to be fair, the only prospects on that list that were expected to have huge impacts were Woodley and Jarvis. Even Worilds, the next highest drafted player, was just depth taken while Harrison and Woodley were still in their primes."
steelers,2yxy21,Steinerway,2,Fri Mar 13 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think Worilds and Woodley were drafted to have the same kind of impact. It was a pick for the future. We knew Harrison was getting older, so Worilds was originally going to be his replacement.  Davis was a third round pick, which is still pretty early. You expect to find starters with those picks. The later ones I agree, their impact wasn't meant to be much, but they should have at least developed into quality depth, or a situation pass-rusher."
steelers,2yxy21,MrGoosemahn,3,Fri Mar 13 22:36:16 2015 UTC,"I think the third round tends to be where it becomes less of a disappointment if the player didn't work out. Yeah it would have been great if Davis did, but it's not a killer. For all the (well-deserved) flak that Emmanuel Sanders got, he provided for us just about the return you'd expect from a 3rd rounder. He then decided to start catching the ball and stop fumbling without contact once he went to Denver, but that's besides the point.  In 2010 Harrison was getting older in terms of his birthday, but as an NFL player? It was after only his third year as a starter, he was a 32 year old with the body and wear and tear of an NFL 29 or 30 year old (since the years on special teams do contribute a bit too). Still had plenty left then, and probably part of why he was still good this past year at 36 years old. Woodley was a BPA/need pick since we weren't 100% sure how Harrison would be as a starter taking over for the then-released Porter, and the always solid but never quite studly and worth re-signing Clark Haggans was in the final year of his contract. Worilds, on the other hand, was a depth pick (and dare I say luxury pick, still a bit bitter we didn't take Sean Lee) as Harrison was entering his fourth year as a starter and Woodley had made it to his first Pro Bowl."
steelers,2yya1z,SteelerBoss,3,Fri Mar 13 21:07:04 2015 UTC,I wish they would have said how much money the contract is worth
steelers,2yya1z,meowdy,2,Fri Mar 13 21:11:32 2015 UTC,"yea me too but my guess is since he said a fair deal, I think it might be anywhere from 14-20mil/year"
