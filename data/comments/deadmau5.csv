In terms of his older tracks, you can expect him to play a choice few of his classics, or recently remixed classics.

After all the piano-based tracks that he's made in the past few years, I was sure he would bring it with him to his new place.  I hope he gets another 8ft Steinway in his new studio, it was a really beautiful piano.    Edit: Thinking about it, I wonder if the one in the tour is his piano or not.  If I recall, he had his piano modified to accept and play MIDI data.  Not sure why a new occupant of that apartment would need/want something like that, unless they were also a producer."

deadmau5,3d8kw3,Gullible_Goose,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:21:31 2015 UTC,The biggest hint for me is the size of the eyes. Fan mau5head eyes are typically too large or in a position similar o the old white and red and/or blue an black mau5heads. Everything since the LEDhead (ledhead 4 lyfe) has had different proportions.

deadmau5,3d7tc9,zoel_jimmerman,-7,Tue Jul 14 06:20:28 2015 UTC,"tl;dr https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF9Yn5mgrjY  Yeah it's similar, but not stolen. How many times are we going to hear about producers having a shit fit over someone else using the same chord progression? You can't copyright progressions. If that was possible, 90% of the entire music catalog out there would be taken down. Besides, mau5's version is way better."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,cj5,8,Tue Jul 14 05:20:52 2015 UTC,"This cord progression is literally the same fucking thing just slowed down, he didn't even bother to change the tone or style.  This is pretty damn blatant, I don't know how you'd feel if someone stole your original content and made money with it disguising it as their own. If you'd work in a creative field you could understand."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,_schimmi_,-3,Tue Jul 14 09:45:29 2015 UTC,"Well if it is so blatant, then I suppose Chris Isaak should be calling Joel a thief for stealing the same melody from his song Wicked Game. It's the same fuckin' song.  If Zimmer sampled the song then Joel has every right to complain. You just have to understand that mimmicking chord progressions or melodies is not stealing. If it is stealing, then Joel should lawyer up and get his song back, and quit his sad attempts at easy money-grubbing."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,cj5,3,Tue Jul 14 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"This is different though, the Zimmer track is not just ""similar"", it's literally an exact copy of the chord progression. It's like he opened the ""I remember"" project folder, copy-pasted the MIDI, and put it into his own track."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,junkfoodlover02,-2,Tue Jul 14 14:24:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe. But the question is, did Zimmer in legal realms ""steal"" it? In order to call someone a thief, you're going to have to prove they stole your creation note for note. Electronic music lends itself to stuff like this, and Joel should just understand that. Just because something sounds the same, doesn't mean it is. Yours is a great theory, but you still need to prove it."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,cj5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:31:29 2015 UTC,"Wicked Game sounds nothing like any of those. I'm not a music expert in terms of instrumentation and or notes, but every deaf man with a bucket over his head could hear the similarity of Zimmers music to ""I remember"".  EDIT: Oh shit, I just saw that you post in this smug circle-jerk hell called /r/audiophile; back up everybody we have a self-proclaimed ""expert"" here.  This is hillarious tbh xD"

deadmau5,3d7tc9,cj5,2,Tue Jul 14 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"If someone took the Mona Lisa but painted her facing the other way and with a frown, would that be stealing from da Vinci? I agree that no one owns a chord but disagree that no one owns a chord progression. I'd be mad if this was done with something I came up with."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,Heyo_Maggots_,8,Tue Jul 14 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"No, they credit the artists they sample from, they get permission, and pay their licenses. French House is sample based music. There's a whole process for it. It's completely different to outright stealing chord progressions, and I don't know why people still use this as a counterarguement."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,Jeffplz,2,Tue Jul 14 10:38:54 2015 UTC,"true, actually"
deadmau5,3d7tc9,JamesSweeneyy,2,Tue Jul 14 13:02:37 2015 UTC,Sampling with credits wouldn't be theft. If they've ever ripped a hook from someone else longer than the allowed length (3 seconds I think?) then yeah that's theft too.
deadmau5,3d7tc9,Heyo_Maggots_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:32:36 2015 UTC,"yeahh, someone else already brought it up & i agree, there's not even a limit on length, i completely forgot about the whole legal thing lmao"
deadmau5,3d7tc9,JamesSweeneyy,-3,Tue Jul 14 15:22:05 2015 UTC,Stealing the physical painting is not the same as laying out the same chords in series. Thousands of songs out there all have the same exact progressions it doesn't make one any more an original than the other.  Joel and a lot of other current electronic artists need to let this bullshit go. Their songs are not complex enough musically to justify that someone copied it. If he doesn't like it compose music that's harder to copy like real musicians do or stfu and be happy with making music.
deadmau5,3d7tc9,cj5,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding? If I played the first eight bars of 'Highway to hell' but slowed down and with a different drum beat, is that similar or stolen? This is as close to I Remember as Under Pressure is to Ice Ice Baby."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,rowdiness,-3,Tue Jul 14 07:10:11 2015 UTC,"No  Did you recreate the music yourself, or did you sample it? In the former case it's perfectly legit."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,cj5,2,Tue Jul 14 10:35:30 2015 UTC,Errr...no it's not. Remember is registered & copyright as is my example Highway to Hell   Copyright gives you   (1) The exclusive right to reproduce your work;  (2) The exclusive right to distribute your work;   (3) The exclusive right to perform your work;   (4) The exclusive right to display your work;   (5) the exclusive right to make derivatives of your work;  (6) The exclusive right to digitally transmit your work  and the bar test for similarity of works is not as high as you'd think.
deadmau5,3d7tc9,rowdiness,0,Tue Jul 14 13:55:21 2015 UTC,"define ""work""  ummmmmm how about every other fuckin genre of music out there? i'm sorry but there are so many musicians composing shit way more complex than 16 to 32 bars of finely mixed synth loops."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,cj5,3,Tue Jul 14 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"Work (noun): Physical or mental effort or activity directed toward the production or accomplishment of something.  Work (noun): A job; employment:  looking for work.   Work (noun): A trade, profession, or other means of livelihood.    I am a bot. If there are any issues, please contact my [master]. Want to learn how to use me? [Read this post]."
deadmau5,3d7tc9,Define_It,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:32:08 2015 UTC,"A work is something that you have created. For instance, a film, a book, a piece of art, a song, or even a sample (don't forget Joel released a series of samples which could be used as part of FruityLoops - some of which were also present in a released album, Project 56).   You can register that work as your own original content and it is given protections so that people don't copy it and reproduce it, aka 'copyright'.    i'm sorry but there are so many musicians composing shit way more complex than 16 to 32 bars of finely mixed synth loops.   Geez. Your personal opinion =/= the law, OK? If the work is registered - and there is not a test for complexity during registration - then copyright applies, and the above rules kick in.   Any part of the work that is reproduced can be considered breach of copyright, including sampling. Which is why the majority of artists who sample other people's tracks seek exclusive permission of those tracks owners, or use tracks that are not registered or copyright. The fact that illegal sampling is so widespread doesn't change the fact that it's illegal.   Classic example - Men At Work were successfully sued for breach of copyright when they included a 1-bar, 10-note riff in the song Land Down Under, because the riff was a direct lift of the folk song Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree. They were initially ordered to pay 40-60% of their royalties to the copywrite owners, but ended up settling at around 5%, which was still in the millions.   So yeah when the bassline, chords and progression are identical in between the two tracks, and Deadmau5's track was released years ago, and the new track is being released commercially...I think he's got a right to be pissed and to threaten legal action.   edit: formatting"

deadmau5,3cjvtz,coolsideofyourpillow,2,Wed Jul 8 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"Haha, i've known about this release for a while (and I wrote that Wikipedia section that you quoted.) The problem is, everything on Hitless is only 128kbps, exactly like the digital download for Get Scraped. Joel did release .WAVs for Get Scraped on live.deadmau5.com, but he omitted FlashTV for some reason. So basically, the only way to get the true lossless file is on the CD."
deadmau5,3cfbup,dlaxman31,4,Tue Jul 7 13:52:31 2015 UTC,Found this set on youtube of some good old hits from the Mau5.  Enjoy!

deadmau5,3ccbqo,stealthstrike,2,Tue Jul 7 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"Lol just making sure, I'd be hyped to see a 4 hour mau5 set"
deadmau5,3ccbqo,AlexatRF21,3,Tue Jul 7 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"It is a long set, really. He's stated he has his songs set into 6 and/or 3 minute stems. If you go half and half. That's 20 six minute songs and 40 three minute songs. Hear Joel playing 60, possible, different songs had to have been incredible."

deadmau5,3ccbqo,Sho_nuff_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:09:03 2015 UTC,I wish he'd play 3-4 hour sets normally. 2 isn't enough. He has so much good music he could easily play 3-4 hour sets with all his music.
deadmau5,3ccbqo,birdscool,2,Sun Jul 12 08:17:16 2015 UTC,yeah but it would be killer on joel to do lets say 3 4 hour sets a week while on tour and do all the other stuff he has to do. it would be epic though
deadmau5,3ccbqo,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:37:31 2015 UTC,"Really wish he'd play the techno/mau5 sets at the festivals. Regardless of what he says, people do enjoy it. Not only that but I'm sorta tired of the plugging-the-remix-album sets. They're great but I'd be surprised if Joel was actually into the tracks.  I can dream! But mixing it up with techno for half an hour and his tracks for half an hour would be fun."

Though for the last 40 min or so he had another DJ standing next to him doing a lot of the spinning.  It was 100 degrees that night so he had the helmet off most of the time. Also I forgot to mention that the star-spangled helmet shown in this picture was not his, but that of a fan. He was nice enough to put it on for a little while."

deadmau5,3cd0nt,JakeGiovanni,5,Tue Jul 7 06:18:16 2015 UTC,"It's because Joel lost or forgot to get the stems for Seeya, so he had to play the album version (like a DJ) and didn't have as much flexibility with it. He's fucking around because he's taking the piss out of DJ's"

deadmau5,3c23mf,instantderp,2,Sat Jul 4 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"Simply put: a standard 'analog synth' is built of lots of modules. A module of oscillators to make the wave form, a module of filters to shape the wave form, a module of gates to trigger/cut off the wave form, etc etc.  By the time you make it through all the modules, you have a finished sound.  A modular synth breaks these apart, dedicating entire machines to a single (or small set of) modules.

deadmau5,3c1pvh,Parker3d,6,Sat Jul 4 00:48:22 2015 UTC,Which is why I made this thread.   I was looking at his Live at T in the Park thread and I noticed that that it was so full of energy. Same with the Meowingtons Toronto set those were fucking great.  But now we have to sit through the entirety of Are You There and Phantoms when he could mix so many other songs like he did in past tours.
deadmau5,3c1pvh,Proggz,9,Sat Jul 4 00:52:25 2015 UTC,"RAT will always be my favourite album, but While was quite a journey to experience and really shows the 'mau5 sound'. That being said, his chord progressions in the 2008 era mau5 were incredible (Tiny Dancer Remix, Alone With You)"

deadmau5,3c1pvh,JaydedWays,4,Thu Jul 9 14:14:54 2015 UTC,Unpopular opinions down vote away:  bftbg vocals suck ass and are really cheesy. That song needs to be an instrumental.   71c is one of if not his greatest song of all time.   While was a great record but Joel made some strange decisions such as   cutting the improved phantoms in favor of the troll version. I think it had more potential to be a cohesive hybrid between piano works and progressive house but it ended up very bloated and his older songs did not need to make their way onto the album and he could have done with making it one cd. That said I enjoy throwing on the continuous mixes.   Overall I really like the melodic exploration and experimentation in his songs of late and he always goes back to his roots eventually.

I mean, if I was at a party and had to choose a song to play, I'd think twice about playing something from While, just because I think it's a more introspective album.   I did like his earlier stuff, but I feel like he sort of went as far as he could go with that. RAT will always be my favorite album of all time though."

deadmau5,3boipo,BlackholeZ32,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"While 2 is less than 1, do something else. It's how while statements work, but the writer didn't understand the meaning of the title."
deadmau5,3boipo,victionicious,2,Thu Jul 2 07:09:32 2015 UTC,"Really enjoyed reading this!  Favorite part is that last bit where he talks about building a show around the music. I 100% agree with it, but that's really just what people are use to now, because things like Electric Forest and Digital Dreams don't want to put all sorts of money into the things that Mau5 does because they expect people to come for the artists, not for some big show with moving Mau5head's on robotic arms.   But if i had the option of going to Veld or a Deamau5 show, i'd pick the Deadmau5 show over anything."
deadmau5,3boipo,iTzSALUST,7,Wed Jul 1 00:52:17 2015 UTC,Now if only he would stop playing festivals and start doing his own tour
deadmau5,3boipo,iTzSALUST,3,Wed Jul 1 01:02:22 2015 UTC,I think he's planning one.   But i honestly don't mind if he plays at festivals either.
deadmau5,3boipo,r3cess,3,Wed Jul 1 01:09:03 2015 UTC,"I do because he tends to just play nearly identical sets festival after festival, which I would assume he would not do if it was his own tour."
deadmau5,3boipo,iTzSALUST,2,Wed Jul 1 02:11:22 2015 UTC,Tour sets are pretty much identical from city to city. Kind of the point of a tour.   You're touring your show around kinda thing.   I assume the festival bookings is just to rake in cash flow for the tour / to invest himself.
deadmau5,3boipo,iTzSALUST,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:32:02 2015 UTC,"True, but again, i'd personally would kill to see mau5 even if he played the same thing each time i saw him preform."

deadmau5,3bo5de,mau5cymau5,6,Tue Jun 30 19:57:04 2015 UTC,"Lots of songs use lots of different chord progressions. There is a finite number of progressions, and they even did a nice variation on it here, it's not even the same: they hold the 3rd chord without adding the minor key into it, like Joel/Kaskade does with I Remember. They even add other variations throughout the rest of the song, including switching to a different progression."
deadmau5,3bo5de,Stryker295,7,Tue Jun 30 22:45:41 2015 UTC,you can't copyright chord progressions.
deadmau5,3bo5de,runningthefamily,2,Tue Jun 30 23:03:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing the song though. Its sehr gut!

deadmau5,3bo5de,reminiscence,3,Wed Jul 1 05:40:28 2015 UTC,"All the comments here seem to imply that OP was trying to criticize/accuse the song for using a similar chord progression. If you read carefully, his tone is actually pretty neutral. Let's not jump to conclusions here."
deadmau5,3bo5de,aerokopf,3,Wed Jul 1 01:38:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but deadmau5 has had problems with other artists stealing bits directly from his song before.

For this one song - which is the one song he can't touch else it ruins it - he decides that instead of standing for 8 minutes doing sweet nothing, he has a bit of a laugh.  Yet because of this one song, some people decide he's awful and a joke? Really? You would rather he ruins the song? I don't get what people want...  For me the intermission is awkward, but hilarious.

Also I don't get how what any of this ""fun"" has to do with this song or him honestly. Maybe its an inside thing of this song being an attempt at a commercial pop hit....... The song is great but it just does not fit into the flow of the set at all.  Maybe there is a reason he has to play it and that reason is why he brings out the couch and stuff when it plays."

I had loved listening to all different types of music back then like Rock, Rap, Alt and Pop. SO I got satellite radio when I found a deal in college. Little did I know this was the start of a huge change that will affect my life in more ways than I would of ever guessed. So I listened to my normal selection of music listed above. Til one day scanning through the stations I found Area 51, Holy shit a station with all electronic I thought no way... So I left it there and fell in love with listening to hours and hours of live mixes and fell in love again with electronic. So later that year I decide to buy a ticket to go to my first rave having no clue what I am in for I go. It happens to be Deadmau5 and Skrillex when they came through town on this tour. I fell in love with both DJs, the scene and the event itself (Yes I was stone cold sober). Since this day I have never paid for any other live show and won't. Because no other genre will you have everyone in the place on the same energy level 1-2 hours. It was the best night of my life.   http://photo.rukes.com/uptown/uptown.html  Pic I took at the concert that you can match with the rukes"

deadmau5,3b8pfk,digitallyApocalyptic,2,Sun Jun 28 01:09:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, listened to it the whole way through now and I've got some actual feedback. Overall, the mix is very cohesive, very quality, very well put together. The bit at the beginning, from the start to around Raise your Weapon, but mostly the bit with Complications, I found very messy. For me, there was just too much going on vocally, and the mix had a tendency to have not too much difference between a quiet bit and a loud bit, which leads to ear fatigue if it's one continuous sound level. The transitions were mostly good, but the transition to Suite 03 was a bit messy. A difficult transition to pull off because of how short and abrupt Suite 03 is, but perhaps a fade in might've helped a little? I'm not sure. One way or another, great job. Just some things to think about going forward."

deadmau5,3b4hmg,deadmaudj,8,Thu Jun 25 22:08:15 2015 UTC,The pause is to make it feel more like a  genuine Boards of Canada song where several songs do have minutes of silence or are only silence.

deadmau5,3b4hmg,randylaheyjr,3,Fri Jun 26 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"It's a exporting error because on Get Scraped, Bored of Canada has the silence at the end, followed by a bit of the beginning of the song. However, on Project 56, there is no silence, the song ends at the end. Even on the Live site, it ends when the melody is finished."

Machines were beeping and it reminded me of Rlyeh's Lament. The Cthulhu songs make me think of this gigantic entity radiating chaos and destruction.

Aural Psynapse (2nd Edit), Closer, HR 8938 Cephei, So There I Was, All I Had, A Moment To Myself, and the intro to Fn Pig all give me different images of parts of outer space Can't really describe ""Strobe"" - rainy moods and such a mystical ecstasy...  Alone With You, The 16th Hour, Suckfest9001, 71c, and Finished Symphony remix gives me imagery of driving or cruising on city roads Gula makes imagine being surrounded by the ocean on the surface, maybe on a cruiseliner, while Coelacanth (10 minute version) makes me imagine being surrounded by the ocean beneath the surface, where dangerous fish lurk... I Remember makes me feel like I'm in an illegal underground club or warehouse Brazil (2nd Edit), Faxing Berlin, and Jaded all make me think I’m soaring on a plane Petting Zoo instantly brings up ""Goat Simulator"" in my mind, while Heavy Petting Zoo makes me think of some sort of combination of an opera, outer space, and cows - lots of cows. Cthulhu Sleeps and Cthulhu Dreams make me imagine the monster Cthulhu himself – arising to cause utter chaos Desynchronised and Maths make me imagine the inside of a computer One Trick Pony makes me visualize an intense laserbeam fight Complications & Secondary Complications (obviously) make me imagine an emergency room in a hospital Arcadia (obviously) makes me imagine a classic retro arcade from the 80's Infra Turbo Pigcart Racer (obviously) makes me imagine a cute little piggy in an intense retro racecar race. Zzz makes me visualize floating on a cloud The 2 Minecraft songs he made makes me see the video game main menu Errors In My Head makes me visualize scenes from ""The Social Network"" (probably because of the Trent Reznor vibes) Suites 02 & 03 make me visualize an entire orchestra going all out Omnifck and Rlyehs Lament make me visualize being really stoned (sorry) Animal Rights gives me the image of a farm (don't ask me why) Catbread makes me imagine being trapped in a room of millions of cats flipping their shit. Where Is Here and I Said (Michael Woods Remix) make me picture a train Bye Friend and Professional Griefers makes me think of Hell Hiatus Fantasy makes me think of classic video games and epic fictional worlds Silent Picture makes me imagine an epic and hopeful ending of a dramatic movie right before the credits Superbia makes me picture the happiness of newborn babies Mercedes makes me imagine a subway station (and yes, I know he samples one in the song) Monday makes me picture a lonely man playing guitar alone on the street on a dreary wet day Sleepless makes me visualize an empty bar late at night Creep makes me imagine numerous monsters/ghouls on Halloween Acedia makes me picture a war between robots that can speak Take Care Of The Proper Paperwork and Terrors In My Head make me think of industrial settings (factory, etc.) Bleed and the break from Phantoms Can't Hang make me think of every sad moment that's occurred in my life but I also picture both a metaphorical and literal light at the end of the tunnel (hope) Right This Second makes me visualize a lone hero; he must leave his friends/family/town behind in order to go on an adventure to make the ultimate sacrifice (destroy something evil or achieve something great).  He begins his quest; Round 1 – he fights for his life and starts to succeed – but BAM! It’s not over; another obstacle lies in his path;  With every last bit of remaining power and effort, the hero fights once more and succeeds; However, he realizes that his quest is never ending, and so he travels on… The original version of Brazil makes me visualize happiness in all its forms.  Additionally I visualize a musical group composed of Joel, an all-strings orchestra, an electric guitarist, and a world-class drummer playing their hearts out at the finale of the greatest concert of all time. and lastly We Fail makes me picture Joel doing his famous awkward dance to the song..."

I have seen many of both, and feel like when the event is about him, he does a lot more with it. Like you say, the controlled environment."
deadmau5,3b0k0k,weepingwillow87,2,Thu Jun 25 02:08:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  And the people that pay just to see Deadmau5 ONLY are the fanatics who in turn make the atmosphere of the show that much better.

Granted Lollapalooza 2013 was absolutely amazing with the rain and all, but I think Joel's strong point is when he plays arena/intimate sets.  I loved watching him play at Rogers Centre just as much as I loved watching a cellphone video of him at some miami nightclub. At festivals, though, there seems to be a little bit of a disconnect to me."
deadmau5,3b0k0k,angusyoungii,2,Thu Jun 25 01:58:45 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more.  When he played in san francisco's civic auditorium Halloween 2011 -that show was mind blowing.

By the time the headliners were on around 9:30, the sound was amazing but before then there was always something off. Seven Lions played a great set but because of the sound it wasn't special.

The description of the YouTube video says   This very rare unreleased deadmau5 track was found in early December of 2008 and, was planned to be released in his album ""At Play, Vol. 2"" but, was eventually instead left to rot in the depths of the internet..   EDIT: Hmmm  Here's where the link in his comment goes.  ""Space Invaders"" by HACH.  Is he lying about this track being on Joel's old Soundcloud for a short period of time?  I surely don't remember that...  EDIT 2:  Called it.  Course dismissed, bring out the dancing lobsters."

deadmau5,3a86wr,whoelseisgonky,4,Thu Jun 18 12:19:21 2015 UTC,"no, this is NOT entropy"
deadmau5,3a86wr,tetri5,-6,Thu Jun 18 14:02:19 2015 UTC,"It is indeed. Some people have been underwhelmed, but I love it. I think it's a bold departure from the massive LED Screen crutch most artists are using today. Liked the transformation throughout the show, and think it also kept the focus on the music. Dunno bout everyone else, but I didn't look at Gov Ball stuff all week to keep it a secret and was pleasantly surprised."
deadmau5,3a86wr,5hawnking5,3,Thu Jun 18 14:06:49 2015 UTC,"no, this stage was only for guv ball and roo.  His entropy tour will be different, pretty sure its a 360 arena setup"
deadmau5,3a86wr,5hawnking5,-3,Thu Jun 18 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you look at it. For me, this was the big stage he was building. I hate all the people ripping on this stage and hyping entropy when, oh yeah, there is fucking no information out at all! I got downvoted, on the deadmau5 subreddit, talking about how I liked his stage....and it's cause of fanboys like yourself."
deadmau5,3a86wr,5hawnking5,5,Thu Jun 18 15:29:58 2015 UTC,"reddit is fickle, and majority of your downvotes wont have any representation of why youre being downvoted (bunch of spineless lurkers).  You can fuck right off with your assumptions about me though, while you read this article that supports everything i said  EDIT: also want to add that I loved his setup at roo, I was in the pit for the show, and it was great."
deadmau5,3a86wr,5hawnking5,2,Thu Jun 18 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"Fuck yes, thought this was about to digress into classic internet argument. Little did I know you were an intellectual 9-time bonnaroovian! Alright, I will concede that the hype for the entropy stage is real as fuck. The 360 degree aspect is sure to change the game. I was only salty because I found a bunch of people here hating on the mau5trap, and brushing it to the side in anticipation of Entropy. This stage was hyped for a long time, and Joel obviously cared a bunch about Gov Ball and Roo. There is just such minimal info on Entropy or that stage, that I hate to see deadmau5 fans not considering this a significant iteration of his live show. When Avaritia fired up on the What Stage, I believe it marked a massive benchmark for mau5. Only 5 years prior I saw him in a tent, and this year they gave him the best time slot ever given at roo. Granted, I am not super informed about the Entropy tour, but when /u/wattm asked ""So... is this the incredible, amazing, balls-dropping stage that he was building?"", I genuinely thought he was referring to the mau5trap."

deadmau5,3a7ce9,DYLDOLEE,7,Thu Jun 18 00:32:53 2015 UTC,It's legal to ignore any cease and desist letter. That doesn't mean the potential lawsuits that follow won't be costly and time consuming.
deadmau5,3a7ce9,Neztopesk,3,Thu Jun 18 02:28:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge first amendment supporter, but you're wrong here. The issue isn't free speech, it's trademark law. Specifically, as outlined in the letter, if there is a significant chance of confusion as to Deadmau5's sponsorship (or lack thereof) of this event, then it's a trademark violation.   They have every right to put on the show, so long as they don't call it something that would infringe on that trademark, and so long as they don't profit from it while using his trademarks. You're confusing trademark law with copyright law, which covers ""Fair Use"", which this is permissible under (naming issues and trademark dilution aside).  Same reason why most parodies play the 'near-but-not-exactly' name game; You can make the parody, but don't try and confuse people into believing it's the real thing. That's exactly what trademark law exists to protect.  Edit: Deadmau5 also has hella-good lawyers. Check LaPolt's record -- she's one of the highest profile lawyers in the entertainment industry.

Bored, because of the said story to it. He was up at 4AM and made this song because he was bored.  Hardly Noticeable, so simple but so unique.   Maybe Sometimes, I love the change from the synthesized drums to the live drums   No Clue, instantly stuck with me, I love every instrument, I hate how short it is.  No Reason, that beat. Chill.  Oblistique, it's so bittersweet if you ask me. It's as if you're waking up after a rough break up with your girlfriend and all the memories come flooding back all at once, because you've got the sweet pretty melody in the background  but the harsh crazy rapid drums over that.  Plants, the drumming, ghost notes galore.  Wish You Were There, see Hardly Noticeable.  And finally, 15 minutes. It's so simple. One track coming in after another, and it all comes together so well. The basic song.  But if I were to say which is my favorite out of all of those, it would be 15 minutes."

Some of them are going to have a sound and others are going to have a rhythm. Most importantly, I think you're going to hear where lot of the influences that other artists have made an impression. This album reminds me a lot of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works or NIN's Ghosts."

The main thing that makes me prefer 04 is the fact that it's so much more developed. Everything's there, it doesn't cut off randomly, etc. Granted, there's bits in the other three that are great, and I'd love to see a finished mix that sort of combines everything there, but I don't know if Joel's ever going to return to these tracks."

deadmau5,39qxmu,slass-y,2,Sun Jun 14 01:12:45 2015 UTC,Ehhhh I read it somewhere. It might have been saying a Michael woods song is competing for the throne strobe sits on i can't remember though

deadmau5,39qxmu,Valliay,5,Sun Jun 14 03:27:57 2015 UTC,can confirm not by source but from memory. i saw a stream and he said asdfghjlk was one of his favourites. it deserves more attention. go and listen to it ppl.
deadmau5,39qxmu,screenhead,3,Sun Jun 14 06:57:11 2015 UTC,"It's one of my fav's as well and he always played it live but he hasn't put it on any of his albums. I wonder if he has any plans for it.

deadmau5,39lm84,PlaylisterBot,7,Fri Jun 12 16:25:12 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of a ""perfect example of the Deadmau5 sound"" is an odd concept. I find his work so varied that I think it would be impossible to use one song as a general description of his work. Maybe I'm mis-interpreting the question?  Great stuff thought!"
deadmau5,39lm84,dotMJEG,3,Fri Jun 12 18:02:06 2015 UTC,He did at one point very much have a sound as many people are saying here the RAT era was a strong identifier of his music which is still noticeable in many of his tracks today.
deadmau5,39lm84,Flukie,2,Fri Jun 12 20:41:26 2015 UTC,"Perhaps at one point in time, yes, but looking at his career thus far, I would safely say that there isn't one song that sticks out as a sum of all his work.  Raise your Weapon vs Strobe vs The Veldt vs HR 8938 vs Faxing Berlin vs Bored of Canada all came out within a few years, but have hugely different sounds and emotions, which is more my point."
deadmau5,39lm84,dotMJEG,3,Fri Jun 12 20:53:26 2015 UTC,"I think there's his sort of 'house/trance sound', his heavier stuff, his mellefresh-era stuff, and my favorite, his piano stuff. It's so hard to find piano tracks similar to his style, it's a very unique sound (from what I've been able to find, at least!)"
deadmau5,39lm84,Stryker295,3,Sat Jun 13 08:38:17 2015 UTC,Also his remix of not alone
deadmau5,39lm84,TheExcitedLamb,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:40:05 2015 UTC,goddamn  Thanks!
deadmau5,39lm84,dotMJEG,3,Fri Jun 12 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"This sucks to say but his remixes are actually better than his originals.  Like Tiny Dancer is an example of the perfected deadmau5 sound which be cause of the uplifting nature of the song is superior than Strobe, but that's just me.   Sometimes i feel like he trusts others more than himself when it comes to the sound.   EDIT: Okay looking back i need to word better the whole ""better than his originals.  What I mean i guess is that he refines his sound better on Tiny Dancer than on October or Closer or Raise Your Weapon if you get me."
deadmau5,39lm84,moon_master345,5,Fri Jun 12 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"I have to agree, with the exception of R.A.T, which was around the era these remixes were made too. Easily my favourite era of deadmau5. Makes me sad that he doesn't produce this way anymore."
deadmau5,39lm84,skyebitch,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:45:51 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. His progressive era made him who he is today. He dabbles back and forth. But mostly collaborative.

deadmau5,39lm84,randomalbumtitle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:52:48 2015 UTC,Cafe del mar remix is the goto example of progressive house for me. The rougher production adds some character as well and i think i actually prefer it. Same level of production as on jaded i think.

From what I've seen of what people are calling the 'mousetrap', I think it looks fucking awesome. Alot better than all the other acts that set up a picnic table in front of and behind of a couple LED screens that has 4-5 different visuals flashing the artist's name until it's engraved into the audience's corneas."

Some random video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkpLmXjBjvQ The thing with qube was that the animations gave songs personalities. The animations were fitting and not just random shapes and lights.

deadmau5,38wag0,Satuim,2,Sun Jun 7 10:54:05 2015 UTC,"So I got curious, so I decided to l see what I could dig up.  Listening to the sample I heard something along the lines of 'tick tock ya don't stop'.  Quick search found the song 'I wanna sex you up - Colour me bad': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO6BtpIzIiM  However, soon realised that that was a sample, so I looked up it, and it sampled the song 'La Di Da Di - Doug E. Fresh': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icBflcYZhpo  Now, listening to Doug E., I heard like a shit ton of samples from it that I could tell. So looked up the song on whosampled.com - looks like its a widely used song to sample: 692 cases to be exact.  Not one of which has A Bit Sketchy - BSOD, even though it sampled it...   Well, there you go, hope it helps!"

deadmau5,38itkj,digitallyApocalyptic,2,Thu Jun 4 14:32:56 2015 UTC,"This was actually here about two weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadmau5/comments/36k7i8/strobe_shemce_remix/  Bit hard to find this through the search bar though, especially because it doesn't show up if you just put in the link to the remix.  Like others said in the other thread that I linked, I think it's an alright remix, but definitely still prefer the original. Personally, for me, the fact that he moves the beginning bit of Strobe to the middle kind of throws me off. Having listened to the original mix, it kind of disrupts the flow of the track, at least for me.  I do think it could be cool to see a version of the full-length Strobe that had been remixed in this manner, though."

deadmau5,38itkj,akbruh,2,Thu Jun 4 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know exactly what you are referring to, but ""top 10"" is entirely subjective. Deadmau5 and Avicii are two examples of incredibly famous EDM artists who have never used ghost producers. Go look up ""Mat Zo ghost producer list,"" it's actually very accurate"
deadmau5,38itkj,ChocPretz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:59:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I've been following his tweets about the matter. I just personally couldn't care less if Schulz uses ghost producers or not. I've never seen him as a big producer at all and be built his name from his skill with a live crowd not skill in a studio. Although it does piss me off when we have producers like armin and especially tiesto just pumping out garbage tracks that they clearly didn't make. Ever since swedish house mafia broke up I feel like it was a major turning point in quantity over quality.
deadmau5,38itkj,akbruh,2,Fri Jun 5 13:35:30 2015 UTC,"Good points, I have never seen Schulz live so I cannot speak from experience. I would also add that the festival craze has hurt EDM a lot, from the extreme amount of drugs and drunk bros raging to the big room button-pushers with so little talent."
deadmau5,38itkj,ChocPretz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:37:52 2015 UTC,"Agree. Big room house IMO is directly to blame for this. Easy to make and everyone jumped on board. That's why I've basically given up on anything mainstream and just listen to more underground stuff now like future house...but that genre is slowly getting crowded.  I would highly recommend seeing Schulz live. I've seen him twice now and he tends to stay away from the crap tunes and is actually good at what he does lol. And I mean not live at a festival, but live in a club or something."
deadmau5,38itkj,akbruh,2,Fri Jun 5 13:47:59 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you also like future house, but you're right that it is getting crowded. My roommate saw Tchami live and described it as simply mindblowing"

This is a section of a sphere, if you extend the lines—most likely a half-sphere that will be in front of him or a quarter-sphere, much like the 'mouth' on his mau5heads. It's quite obvious this is covered in an array of LEDs so it almost makes me wonder if he's abandoning the cube and moving to a sphere? Or if they'll complement each other somehow?  On a side note, I LOVED in the Nokia Lumia ""Light up the night"" event where they literally picked up his stage, flew it over the crowd, and landed it on another stage, with him playing on it the whole time.

deadmau5,38bkkz,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:55:29 2015 UTC,It seems Entropy is not related to this new stage. Personally I reckon that Entropy will be a orchestral tour or remake of his music.
deadmau5,38bkkz,JerBearX,3,Wed Jun 3 04:00:44 2015 UTC,"I recall this project Aphex Twin did, where he ""MIDI controlled""  an entire orchestra. He gave each of them headphones, and instructed them to copy the tone to the best of their abilities. He then sent out a big  series of different tones.  It ended up sounding like a clusterfuck, but  a very cool idea!"

deadmau5,382jd1,Jmcur,9,Mon Jun 1 11:44:31 2015 UTC,"First heard the radio version of I Remember, then had to listen to the entire album (RAT). Still is my favorite deadmau5 album to date."
deadmau5,382jd1,DentistNamedCrentist,3,Mon Jun 1 12:30:54 2015 UTC,"Oh shit i completely forgot I Remember was released before Ghosts. I agree with you RAT is by far his best IMO. Sometimes things get whatever, Brazil 2nd edit, I remember, Faxing Berlin, Arguru, Not Exactly.... all probably in my top 10 favourites :)"
deadmau5,382jd1,DentistNamedCrentist,3,Mon Jun 1 12:46:20 2015 UTC,"Same here. I've definitely enjoyed much of his music since RAT, but the fact that I can listen to RAT Straight through without ever thinking of hitting skip is what makes it so special for me. It's one huge journey, going from the depths of  Sometimes Things Get Whatever and Complications, to the uplifting, ethereal qualities at the end of the album in Not Exactly, Arguru, and So There I Was. Such a surreal sonic journey."
deadmau5,382jd1,Shastamasta,2,Tue Jun 2 01:26:18 2015 UTC,"Around 2009 or so a friend sent me a link to listen to ""I Remember"".  It was like love at first sight!  (Or listen in this case).  ""I Remember"" was also the song that got me into electronic music.  Powerful stuff.  It's still my favorite song."
deadmau5,382jd1,DentistNamedCrentist,2,Tue Jun 2 00:54:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed, very powerful. It also was what pushed me over the brink with electronic. I had listened to trance for years and years prior, but only as a casual inbetween genre to the other stuff I liked. But I Remember, and eventually the whole RAT album, just made me pursue all of Joel's music. Not to mention I was also going through a pretty rough patch in life when I heard it, so it came at the perfect time with its lyrics."

Deadmau5 tour the UK again pleeeeeease.  Edit: It was uploaded Nov 2008, so I must of watched it very soon after since it inspired me to go to my first ever concert which was Deadmau5 For lack of a better name tour in Bournemouth, UK."

deadmau5,382jd1,CelticTalk,2,Tue Jun 2 15:10:22 2015 UTC,Well I knew the song was Ghosts something something and it had some organ funeral music in it.
deadmau5,382jd1,drunktelevision,2,Tue Jun 2 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that. Your comment just made me chuckle."
deadmau5,382jd1,jm434,2,Tue Jun 2 20:14:01 2015 UTC,"Thats awesome dude. Im finally seeing him in august at reading fest, ill probably be watching alone though as most of my friends are into rock music. I hope he tours the UK again also would love to go to one of his shows."
deadmau5,382jd1,Slave2disco,2,Mon Jun 1 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"I've been going to festivals in the netherlands alone since 2012 (I listen to hardstyle/hardcore), it's not as bad as you'd think. Just enjoy the atmosphere, don't drink/drugs too much (no friends to have your back) and chances that you'll start a conversation and hang with people there is quite high since everyone tend to be quite welcoming so you shouldn't even get lonely."
deadmau5,382jd1,paradigm_shift119,3,Mon Jun 1 13:50:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've only ever been to rock gigs before, although I did watch Knife Party a few years back at Reading with a friend however, he probably wont come to see the mau5. I'm more than happy to go alone though and as you said, hopefully strike up a conversation and meet some new people at the show :)"
deadmau5,382jd1,ThatFag,2,Mon Jun 1 14:00:43 2015 UTC,"I can't remember what i heard first but i liked it , not enough to check his other stuff out but i still downloaded it. Few months after that i heard my friend talking about a remix that was on the DJ Hero game and started to listen to some of his other stuff .. then i started to enjoy his work.. i looked up to see if he was on tour and to my shock he had just played a very local gig to me ( about 30 minutes away from my house in Cardiff )  I tried to save some money for reading festival this year but unfortunately realised the festival sold out :(  One day!"

I liked this one track my Knife Party called Internet Friends. And I was discussing music with my friend.   I was like, ""I don't like this whole dubstep thingy... With the Skrillex and dead mau five."" -_- I didn't even know the difference between progressive house and dubstep. Truthfully, I hadn't even listened to Joel's music then. I just told my friend I didn't like dubstep. My friend was and is a big electronic music fan and he sent me a link to Bleed by deadmau5.   It was chill as fuck. And after that, there was no turning back. Bleed is a beautiful track and my first track my deadmau5. Long Love live the mau5!"
deadmau5,382jd1,serges9,6,Mon Jun 1 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"Strobe. Happened to browse YouTube a few years ago looking for new music to listen to, and then Strobe popped up. My music selection has now benefitted from that day, in more ways than one."
deadmau5,382jd1,JerBearX,3,Mon Jun 1 12:46:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah he has played a pretty big part in the type of music I listen to now. I used to only listen to a select few artists but now i listen to so much more across several genres, mostly thanks to the mau5!"
deadmau5,382jd1,randylaheyjr,3,Mon Jun 1 12:59:10 2015 UTC,"Sometimes Things Get, Whatever was when i finally clicked as I thought the song was unlike anything i've ever heard of in my life.  Then i listened to Live at T in the Park and Some Chords sold me."

deadmau5,382jd1,jhanna14,2,Mon Jun 1 13:36:59 2015 UTC,"My first exposure to deadmau5 was Ghosts N Stuff on the radio when it was still new. The first time I truly took interest, though, was seeing him perform on the MuchMusic stage in 2011. The entire set was livestreamed on MuchMusic.  I was a late bloomer to join the horde, but fast forward to  today, I'm a superfan!"

deadmau5,382jd1,dirt-doggy-dog,2,Mon Jun 1 12:54:50 2015 UTC,"I think it was ""Right this Second"". I probably saw it while browsing YouTube and then ended up listening to pretty much anything else of his I could find."
deadmau5,382jd1,Erna2013,2,Mon Jun 1 13:24:22 2015 UTC,I'd say somehow over 5 years ago I heard Brazil 2nd edit and I was sold.

deadmau5,382jd1,jaredjeya,2,Mon Jun 1 18:06:25 2015 UTC,"First song I ever heard was HR 8939 Cephei, sent to me by my good friend /u/auronaxe. After hearing that song, I saw him at The Rogers Centre in Toronto, ON, on his Meowingtons Hax Tour 2k11. And from that point on, I was hooked. Even became more loving of his music once I got into production. His works to this day inspire me with their complexity and how intricate his sound design is."
deadmau5,382jd1,TheMidnightRunner93,2,Mon Jun 1 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"HR 8939 Cephei is a fantastic song. So mysterious but just pure awesome it feels so empty but so complex at the same time. Great sound design as you mentioned. Damn, you were at that show? That's my favourite live show of his on youtube. I loved the setlist he played, lucky git :P"
deadmau5,382jd1,Shaskool2142,2,Mon Jun 1 23:22:07 2015 UTC,I was really into Daft Punk and Madeon back in 2011 and I saw deadmau5's name everywhere so I checked him out. The first song I heard was Ghost N Stuff
deadmau5,382jd1,Ghstlghts,2,Mon Jun 1 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"My story is a little bit like yours, I was into Daft Punk(I still am) and looking for some ""Harder, better, faster, stronger"" videos in YouTube I saw this video of deadmau5 playing it in a live show back in 2010 or so. Then I started looking for him and the first song I listened was ""I Remember""."

I instantly loved it.  The first CD i listened to was 'For lack of a better name'. He's been my favorite artist since.  I originally found his music from a Russian site called gomusicnow.com that sold tracks for like ten cents. Probably not legal but it was great."
deadmau5,382jd1,ArchmageNydia,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:57:46 2015 UTC,Hahaha me too! 'Dead mow 5'? Yes in electronic music he is by far my favourite to.
deadmau5,382jd1,Actionhippie417,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:03:46 2015 UTC,A friend was listening to some of his music as we drove around a few years ago and I asked what it was. My shit for memory decided it wasn't important to remember. Same thing happened the next day and I still couldn't remember who he mentioned. A little while after that I kept hearing Ghosts n Stuff on the satellite radio. Immediately went and got a few of his albums and have been hooked since.
deadmau5,382jd1,ogtogaconvict,2,Mon Jun 1 13:31:55 2015 UTC,I've tried getting my friends into it but none of them like his music which is a pity as im seeing him in august but ill be going alone :(

Awhile back I saw a girl wearing a shirt with a mau5head on it and I was kinda like ""the fuck is that??"" so proceeded to search it. Heard Moar Ghosts and was BLOWN away, first electronic song I ever got into. That flowed straight into every other mau5 song which I loved, and opened up my taste to liking all kinds of music. Forever thankful for that day I googled it   4 years later I still love almost all of his tracks, idolize the dude, and have had the same favorite track for like 2 years now"

From there I thought, ""man, that music's cool! I'd like to hear more!"" I think the song was Cthulhu Sleeps from the video and then 4x4=12 was the first album I bought and listened to."

deadmau5,382jd1,iTzSALUST,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a blur for me, several things happened at once, really. I think the first thing I actually heard was a YTPMV remix of Some Chords called Some Knuts. I liked the song, but thought nothing of it. After that, I got into Hybrid, then a bit of Skrillex. I kept seeing a video of a remixed Hybrid song by deadmau5. I was never very adventurous with my music tastes, so I decided not to click on it. A bit later, I came across ""The Oshawa Connection"" in a game called Midnight Club: LA. I liked the song and went into the menu and it was that ""dead maw five"" (as I thought it was pronounced) again! After this I was listening to Some Knuts again and I realized it was deadmau5, so I basically said ""Fuck it, I'm listening to more of this."" So I did; I think the first one I got into was moar ghosts n stuff, then I got more into most of the albums that were out when 4x4=12 was released. I think I was most into it right after that album was released, as I don't remember being excited at a new album then."

deadmau5,382jd1,pikachusaegyo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:45:23 2015 UTC,I had never been to an electronic show before. A girl I was in to invited me and her cousin (female friend of mine) down to visit NYC for his string of Roseland shows in 2011. Back then I knew very little about electronic music and next to nothing about deadmau5. The girl ended up ditching us and what could have been a horrible night turned out to be amazing because of the music and awe-striking production.   Man the cube was really amazing to see for the first time.
deadmau5,382jd1,MorbidlyObtuse,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:13:27 2015 UTC,I think it was actually Moar Ghosts N Stuff for me. I had heard of deadmau5 somewhere and I just searched for him on YouTube and clicked the first song with a cool looking thumbnail which happened to be MGNS. I was instantly hooked.
deadmau5,382jd1,ahalprin122,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:14:11 2015 UTC,Faxing Berlin on area Sirius xm back in 2008. Good lord I still remember the exact intersection I was stopped at thanks to that song.

deadmau5,382jd1,JamesSweeneyy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"There was an askreddit thread a couple or three years ago asking what the most emotional instrumental song people knew was. From that thread I discovered Strobe. This was after a couple years of being into Skrillex and the like, but having only heard Ghosts n' Stuff which I didn't care for at the time. After hearing Strobe (and let's be honest playing it on repeat for like a week straight being blown away each time), I looked into some of his other work, giving it another chance. The rest is history"

For me, I saw the grilled cheese tower episode, and i was thinking ""who is this Micky Mouse looking motherf**ker?"" Then, there was a shot of him without the mau5head on, but i didn't know that was him, i thought it was just some random guy, idk who. So for the longest time, Deadmau5 to me was just, the mau5head. I didn't know about Joel's existence.  That was probably the best time i had listening to him, because i didn't have a face to put to a name, only a logo."

deadmau5,382jd1,bigkittymeow,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:26:04 2015 UTC,"Pure. Chance. I was playing a game with Pandora playing in the background. I happened to have it on a Daft Punk station and was listening to an awesome track when I decided to check what it was. It was deadmau5 More Ghost's 'n' Stuff. What's really weird, though, is that I had skipped it over multiple times before that and hadn't noticed that it was that song. Had I noticed, I'd have probably skipped it and never listened to deadmau5 ever again."

deadmau5,382jd1,d11ego,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:56:07 2015 UTC,His Essential Mix in 2008. Everyone would be bumping Ghost n Stuff on the drive to the rave but he never clicked with me until i heard his Essential Mix. It was over from there. every drug fueled night had that mix playing in the background.

I went and looked the video just out of curiosity and the helm captivated me big time, I thought it was so cool and I wanted to know more about the artist so I decided to download one of his CD's Ghosts N Stuff pull me in but Strobe made me a fan."

deadmau5,382jd1,zoel_jimmerman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:19:17 2015 UTC,"I've already heard of Ghosts N' Stuff but it didn't really click on me immediately. I watch a lot of dj1991's videos in his channel and the Sexy Russel video got my attention. I fell in love with one of the tracks used in the video which was DjFile's Hot Barbecue. Upon reading the comments, I learned that the song was a complete ripoff of Deadmau5's Hey Baby.  I went to the Deadmau5 rabbit hole that day, my first favorite tracks were Hey Baby and GnS. Despite what everyone says about Hey Baby, I still like the song."
deadmau5,381ofj,aerospacenut,10,Mon Jun 1 05:19:25 2015 UTC,So it seems from what we have seen so far the the new stage design will consist of Joel being inside a giant LED mau5head. Awesome!

To treat this sub-reddit like another TMZ is what he doesnt want. He hates mainstream media and weird fans. So when i hear that artists slip into a secret gig, i'm happy for them and not search for the show. The artists want new people in the front row so they can get a great experience and maybe get new fans. I bet Joel screams internally (sometimes) when he sees a meme screaming fan in the front row for the millionth time. that was my small rant of why i don't look for ""secret"" shows."
deadmau5,37h0xn,rag3fac3,7,Wed May 27 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"Situations where ""secret"" shows come up are typically due to contractual reasons with promoters.

deadmau5,37dlmb,Dennibro,6,Tue May 26 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"Before you all assume this is fake, here is a little background about this track:  Joel's first tracks as Halcyon441 and Karma K were made with FL Studio. On an interview with Image-Line, they gave out the project file for a track called ""Remaining"", and talked about other projects such as:   His debut album, ""Get Scraped"" Working with the band ""Orgy"" The music library ""Killersounds"" And his track, ""The Hive""   This makes a lot of sense that it would be his track, as another track, ""That's Not True"" is actually included with FL Studio's demo projects. Additionally, Joel has also put up the project file for an old track titled  ""Reakt (V0.5_Beta)"" on his SectionZ page"". (An interesting thing to notice is even though he addresses his note as Halcyon441, the email address refers to Karma K.)  I was browsing the internet to find where I could possibly find a ""Get Scraped"" CD, when I stumbled apon this file, even though I have read the interview before.  If you would like to download the .FLP project file for FL Studio, you can by clicking here.  Sorry for the long post, but I found this extremely interesting that I have not found this before, and I really like how Joel has made a few of his very old track stems available."

deadmau5,374ata,victionicious,1 point,Mon May 25 01:21:38 2015 UTC,Do you mean to say that this song was somehow not made in Joel's studio?
deadmau5,36z8gd,Max24s,2,Sat May 23 11:15:24 2015 UTC,"He sure makes some fuckin weird faces when he's producing. Love the knee to chest thing he was doing for a while, too. Awesome track, though. I was fucking blasting Beneath 02 yesterday, can't wait for more."
deadmau5,36z8gd,_Draven_,1 point,Sat May 23 16:31:15 2015 UTC,Haha I'm happy someone noticed that too. He does the whole double knee in the chest thing. Kinda shows that hes never really grown up. :P

deadmau5,36y6u2,barnbarn122,3,Sat May 23 02:45:57 2015 UTC,That was the sickest drop ever. 10/10 would drop again.
deadmau5,36yp1x,justcallmetom13,5,Sat May 23 06:09:31 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid you probably won't find a real version of that. He likely laid a very simple backing track behind it on another deck, nothing he'd release on its own. But maybe look up the Original Mix if you want something more club / dj friendly"
deadmau5,36yp1x,Heyo_Maggots_,1 point,Sat May 23 08:10:16 2015 UTC,I've looked around for it but haven't had any luck. Perhaps there's a mix out there that has this version.  Thanks for the help!
deadmau5,36yp1x,fredomau5,6,Sat May 23 08:16:26 2015 UTC,"Alone With You, is probably hands down THE most underrated track by Joel. If he was to play this live more often it would get the recognition that it deserves."
deadmau5,36yp1x,troylaw,7,Sat May 23 07:29:51 2015 UTC,One of my favs. Underrated isn't the right word. Its just not circlejerked over.
deadmau5,36yp1x,Diableries,3,Sat May 23 08:33:55 2015 UTC,Yeah! I think it's in just the right place. Discrete and not very well known but a pleasure when found :)!
deadmau5,36yp1x,Jankelope,3,Sat May 23 14:34:28 2015 UTC,From that video it sounds like he might be using samples from Adam Shaw's remix mixed in with the original track.
deadmau5,36yi6k,Vectrexoscope,2,Sat May 23 04:46:17 2015 UTC,Really good sounding! This would have been great to revise to if I still had exams.   Where did you get the Live intro to Some Chords from? Didn't think it existed beyond live recordings

deadmau5,36p15f,Good4Josh2,4,Thu May 21 00:10:33 2015 UTC,aassddff is still my favourite version. If only it was longer.
deadmau5,36p15f,secondlamp,3,Thu May 21 05:53:44 2015 UTC,Grabbitz edit is untouchable. Deadmau5 should just give him the credit and release his version.
deadmau5,36p15f,cadenzo,2,Thu May 21 16:56:54 2015 UTC,Much appreciated

deadmau5,36npfl,Flukie,14,Wed May 20 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting comparison actually, although it's probably just a coincidence/subconscious influence.  Zedd's a cool guy, he wouldn't intentionally rip off Joel's work since they're friends and all."
deadmau5,36npfl,victionicious,7,Wed May 20 18:54:16 2015 UTC,he wouldn't intentionally rip off Joel's work   I was thinking it'd be more of a 'homage' than a 'rip-off.'
deadmau5,36npfl,SuperBreakfast,3,Wed May 20 19:35:41 2015 UTC,The blips in bumblebee are a form of a pre made synth loop that Mau5 also used. Both of them just rearranged and tweaked it.
deadmau5,36npfl,LegendaryGrunt,3,Thu May 21 02:36:14 2015 UTC,"Nah, but good ear! They're in the same scale which makes them sound similar!"
deadmau5,36npfl,JerBearX,2,Thu May 21 12:55:20 2015 UTC,Yep. Pretty cool eh?
deadmau5,36npfl,moon_master345,1 point,Wed May 20 18:53:13 2015 UTC,Yeah just interesting how much it stuck out to me.
deadmau5,36npfl,GeekyCreeper,2,Wed May 20 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but probably not intentional."
deadmau5,36npfl,Good4Josh2,1 point,Wed May 20 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"Similar synth and rhythm/pattern, different melody.  Nothing too significant."
deadmau5,36npfl,Jankelope,1 point,Wed May 20 19:41:20 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing.
deadmau5,36npfl,djhost,1 point,Thu May 21 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"Some preset , and ARP sequence little modified, and the scale of the song is the same (?) sorry my english is bad"

deadmau5,36npfl,ThatFag,-1,Fri May 22 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"As others have said, I doubt it was intentional. I doubt he's even listened to Slip as it's not a very popular track. Anyway, Zedd seems like a nice guy, not that I know him personally. He wouldn't rip Joel's music off since Joel and Zedd are friends and Zedd, like I said, seems like a good fella.   Good catch, by the way!"
deadmau5,36k7i8,mau5cymau5,14,Wed May 20 00:09:59 2015 UTC,"Ehhh there are just some songs that I consider un remixable, and I think strobe is one of them. I have never heard a strobe remix better than the original and probably never will cause anytime i hear hints of the masterpiece in other songs I just find myself wanting to listen to the original instead"
deadmau5,36k7i8,reedstiffer,8,Wed May 20 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"I have never heard a strobe remix better than the original   This is not the purpose of a remix. The one here is perfectly suited in a mix with deep and future house. It's not supposed to be better than the original, but rather translate the beauty of the song in a different environment, which it does rather good."

deadmau5,36k7i8,victionicious,1 point,Wed May 20 08:21:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's bad, technically speaking- it sounds very well done, but I feel like this lacks a lot of the depth of the original. It almost sounds a bit like a Robin Shulz-esque take on it"

deadmau5,36c5m1,zoel_jimmerman,12,Mon May 18 05:02:21 2015 UTC,I love how open he is showing rough work. THIS IS WHY I LOVE DEADMAU5.  Edit: it looks like he's going beast mode uploading a bunch of stuff
deadmau5,36c5m1,kobe24Life,12,Mon May 18 05:23:19 2015 UTC,I dont love that he is ignoring live.deadmau5.com
deadmau5,36c5m1,Dennibro,2,Mon May 18 05:28:02 2015 UTC,Totally agree with you. I hope we get some high quality downloads soon.
deadmau5,36c5m1,dootzero,5,Mon May 18 06:25:03 2015 UTC,"the only reason I am still subbed to live is because I pirated a lot of his shit and owe him the money anyway. dont get me wrong, I love joels' work but I'm majorly disappointed with his upload rate musically at least.   before aaddsfffsfsf there was a dry spell of music uploads for over three months. the fact he's putting stuff on soundcloud at all shows how much (or little) live.deadmau5.com is at the forefront of his mind."
deadmau5,36c5m1,SubtotalBroom,2,Mon May 18 20:50:56 2015 UTC,"I dont even mind that he doesnt put up new tracks because then it will shut everyone up who always complains about no new tracks on >insert next album title here<.  But when he goes back to uploading tracks on soundcloud, something he said he was abandoning in the attempt to sell everyone of live.deadmau5, that bothers me."
deadmau5,36c5m1,JaydedWays,1 point,Mon May 18 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"What right does Joel have to put a collaborative effort on his own exclusive website? It's not just his song. Samething with The Grabbitz song. you really think Kaskade or skylar grey would just say ""Sure put w/e u want of our unreleased song on your own exclusive page."" I will not disagree with the dry spell but these aren't deadmau5 exclusive tracks..."

deadmau5,36c5m1,Sputnik003,1 point,Mon May 18 22:48:12 2015 UTC,I'm sure he'll still be uploading exclusive stuff to live.deadmau5... and he said not long ago that he isn't completely abandoning soundcloud either....
deadmau5,36c5m1,aerospacenut,1 point,Mon May 18 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"He's playing both sides. He wants these tracks to get out through social media, but since the site is locked he can't do it that way.   I am also of the belief he has a good chunk of music done.

deadmau5,36cdvo,Dennibro,5,Mon May 18 06:46:28 2015 UTC,"Oh man...forgot about this.  This was a huge deal when it happened.    Story time:  On February 21st, 2011, Joel was doing his usual thing at XS Club in Vegas at the Wynn Las Vegas and Encore Hotel Resort.  In attendance was Don Johnson, CEO of Heritage Development and a huge highroller in Vegas.  Anyways, Don offerered Joel $200,000 to play “Livin’ On A Prayer”, and Joel actually agreed to the deal.  He brought up Don, made a “Don Motherfucking Johnson” banner (as seen in the video) and proceeded to play Livin On A Prayer with Don on stage.  However, after the set, Don failed to follow through and failed to pay up, causing a lawsuit to occur the following day.  I’m not sure, but I think I once heard that a week or so later, the agency ended up paying him the 200k because they didn’t want to lose their client.  Photo album from that night  EDIT:  (further deets on the lawsuit that I found online) ""The deal was brokered through William Morris Endeavor, the talent agency that represents Deadmau5.  So, Deadmau5's agent and the club owner decided to split the payment in order to keep Deadmau5 happy.  William Morris paid $150,000 and the club owner paid $50,000. Apparently, the story does not end there.  The club owner, Jessie Waits, sued Deadmau5's agent regarding the payment of a loan.  So, Deadmau5's agent and WME countersued.  A judge threw out part of the claim and the parties are coming to undisclosed settlement"""

deadmau5,35rl0m,thequietpenguin,4,Tue May 12 22:45:00 2015 UTC,Entropy is confirmed not to be a tour (while there is a tour coming). I personally think an orchestra playing Joel's tracks. Although it may be the name of the new live set up thinking about it now.
deadmau5,35rl0m,aerospacenut,5,Tue May 12 23:15:22 2015 UTC,Either way hes been rather inactive as of late from a music aspect.
deadmau5,35rl0m,aerospacenut,3,Tue May 12 23:21:07 2015 UTC,He said it's because of his new house. He doesn't  have a studio as of now and has had next to no internet. He said both are getting properly built and sorted out for him and we I'll get sooner updates.   But Joel is touring atm I think ( or just about to start) so I don't imagine that will be for a while.
deadmau5,35rl0m,randylaheyjr,1 point,Tue May 12 23:30:08 2015 UTC,He has proper internet now right? He was streaming on twitch not too long ago.
deadmau5,35rl0m,decoyrhyme,1 point,Thu May 14 17:13:40 2015 UTC,I think entropy is just the name given to the new 'performance' that'll be done on said tour. So like entropy would be the replacement for the cube that he's been using for the past few years.
deadmau5,35rl0m,jdwilsh,1 point,Wed May 13 19:48:27 2015 UTC,He's already confirmed the cube will be returning this year in his twitch streams. He said it's easier to cart around to festivals etc.

deadmau5,35nwpe,Shaskool2142,5,Tue May 12 01:17:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess it's some wave-shaped saws with a couple voices of unison into a filter with a gate ADSR amplitude curve into a short big reverb with a decent amount of modulation into the culture vulture and then bussed to the main reverb. The first reverb helps add some dissonance when it's placed pre distortion and the second one is for an actual reverb effect. I'm willing to bet he used the culture vulture all over that track.  Though for this sound you'll never get it without the right amount of detuning among the unison voices. The times you hear the warbling that you perceive as tremolo (""wavey"" amplitude modulation) sounds like it's coming from unison phasing rather than any actual amplitude modulation source. Also how the chords are voiced play a large part in getting the pulsing dissonance to play nicely with the distortion.  The ""tremolo"" sound increases in speed for higher notes and decreases for lower notes. This makes me think it's due to key-tracked oscillator beating -- a noteable feature of modern Moogs, of which Joel has a bunch. Since he's got enough (at least 3 voyagers and a voyager xl along with some phatty's I think?) to form full chords, I wouldn't be surprised if this song uses polychained Voyagers.  edit: ok disregard the thing about the moogs. moog's big thing is that you can keep the oscillator beat frequency the same for any key pressed. What's happening here is normal oscillator beating. Though for all we know it could still be polychained Moogs, even though that'd be kind of a pain to set up as opposed to using an already polyphonic synth."
deadmau5,35nwpe,HungryTacoMonster,2,Tue May 12 06:24:50 2015 UTC,modulation into the culture vulture   I couldn't help but think you started talking nonsense after I read this...
deadmau5,35nwpe,dootzero,3,Tue May 12 22:07:34 2015 UTC,It's a distortion unit by Thermionic. You can see it in the bottom part of the screen of this video.  http://equipboard.com/pros/deadmau5/thermionic-culture-the-culture-vulture

deadmau5,35nwpe,MajictheImaginative,1 point,Wed May 13 15:39:55 2015 UTC,I could take a stab at remaking it if you want and tell you what I used (would be mostly plugins unless i decided to use a hardware synth). Never tried because my mind basically went to what HungryTacoMonster said. I did however when I was bored one day try to recreate the drum and bass tones from the track and got it pretty damn close. If you're interested I could post a short video to instagram or something so you could hear it.
deadmau5,35n2pv,FrostyPenguin_,2,Mon May 11 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"Saw him at last years Gumball when he arrived in NYC. There are no schedules as to when they arrive...they get there when they get there, it all varies as to how fast they drive, what route they take, if they get pulled over/arrested (hehe, spain). Luckily last year he was livestreaming it and had originally said he was going straight to the hotel, but changed his mind the last minute. so as soon as he got close to NY, i hopped in my car and i was there in 10 minutes. He was the last one to arrive. He stuck around for at least 30 minutes chatting and signing autographs. Its probably the easiest event to go see/meet Joel...and you get to see some cool cars.  Have fun!  EDIT; here's my post from gumball last year."

deadmau5,357438,Stryker295,1 point,Fri May 8 14:39:02 2015 UTC,A torrent site is where I got the compilation. Also the Vocal Mix of To Forever doesn't exist on US itunes somehow.   You can try KAT and run Spek on it if anything.

deadmau5,34znmw,randylaheyjr,1 point,Wed May 6 18:05:33 2015 UTC,"I'll agree that that probably wasn't the best way to reply. I'm not one for not admitting to being a douchebag.  If some of you like the suggestion I've made in this thread, I'll create an official discussion thread about it."
deadmau5,34znmw,zoel_jimmerman,1 point,Wed May 6 18:15:40 2015 UTC,That sounds like a good idea. Having a link to that wiki in the sidebar would effectively answer this threads request as well.
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,2,Wed May 6 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"Then what the fuck is the benefit of having a sidebar with ""related subreddits""? Seriously look at the ""related"" subs, ""futurebeats"" ""electrohouse"" ""dnb"" lol"
deadmau5,34znmw,zoel_jimmerman,1 point,Wed May 6 03:31:11 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what your point is in mentioning related subreddits. That's a completely different thing. I've suggested making a live show wiki for people to edit so share your ideas on that.
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,1 point,Wed May 6 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"The point is a sidebar with upcoming shows is far more benefical than having a sidebar with completely unrelated ""related subreddits""."
deadmau5,34znmw,zoel_jimmerman,1 point,Wed May 6 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but certain things in the sidebar are there for a reason. I've suggested an alternative, so go share your thoughts on that."
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,1 point,Wed May 6 21:43:44 2015 UTC,Dont disagre with the wiki thing.  What is your reason for having unrelated subreddits on the sidebar though?
deadmau5,34znmw,zoel_jimmerman,1 point,Wed May 6 22:22:23 2015 UTC,They're related subreddits. I have them there as cross-promotional links like many subs do nowadays. It's a simple courtesy.
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,1 point,Thu May 7 06:52:20 2015 UTC,"""Future beats"" ""dnb"" & ""electro house"" are hardly related. If you want to cross-promote a sub that is ACTUALLY RELATED, put r/mau5head on there."
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,1 point,Thu May 7 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"Again, it's about cross-promotion. A sub comes to us about promoting and we add them as a courtesy in hopes of getting them more readers."
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,1 point,Thu May 7 19:04:29 2015 UTC,So it's obvious that the powers that can do it don't want a sidebar list of shows. Fine make the wiki then. It's better than the nothing that we'll get otherwise.
deadmau5,34znmw,seitgeist,1 point,Wed May 6 22:19:24 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure you've read the rest of my comments. The wiki is better than the sidebar for this. Don't throw a fit because I decided against your exact suggestion.
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,1 point,Thu May 7 06:55:19 2015 UTC,I'm not throwing a fit. You'll know when that happens. ;)  I've seen the list in sidebars before and think it works fine. It was a suggestion to the mods to get this done and all I've heard from others is that the mods we do have don't get shit done and you seemed to reinforce that with your reasoning not to have the sidebar list.  If you think a wiki will work better then let's do that.
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,1 point,Thu May 7 17:11:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't explain my reasoning well at first. My apologies. I know a lot of subs that use sidebar show lists, but I personally think the wiki is better for us, so that's what we'll do."
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,1 point,Thu May 7 19:06:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your suggestion and for clarifying your reasoning. If I came across as harsh, I also apologize. I meant no disrespect or negative attitude."
deadmau5,34znmw,Dennibro,2,Thu May 7 19:13:24 2015 UTC,Come on it's not hard to track where he is. Just go on songkick.   The sidebar is already long enough.
deadmau5,34znmw,BluePterodactyl,2,Wed May 6 16:12:33 2015 UTC,Songkick is not always accurate.  Sidebar is already long enough? Then put the tour list at the bottom and make the people who want to see it do the chore of scrolling down.
deadmau5,34znmw,Good4Josh2,2,Wed May 6 18:18:09 2015 UTC,At this point it's not about making people scroll down. I'm focusing on ease of updating the list in which case putting it on the wiki is the best option.
deadmau5,34znmw,chizdippler,2,Wed May 6 18:21:26 2015 UTC,So then give someone WHO WANTS TO DO THIS the power to do so. You're basically saying that you don't think it's a good idea because you don't want to be bothered with updating it.
