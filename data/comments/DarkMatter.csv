DarkMatter,3e3jd4,TheLantean,3,Tue Jul 21 18:02:55 2015 UTC,"Some Dark Matter related bits from the article:   Space original series KILLJOYS and new series DARK MATTER contribute to overall audience growth, averaging nearly 400,000 and 500,000 viewers respectively      Airing immediately after KILLJOYS, sci-fi thriller DARK MATTER is claiming an average audience of 489,000 viewers, with Episodes 3 and 4 tipping over half a million viewers. Currently, DARK MATTER ranks as the #2 program on Space for A25-54, behind global genre heavy-weight, DOCTOR WHO. In their respective Friday at 9 p.m. ET (KILLJOYS) and 10 p.m. ET (DARK MATTER) timeslots, Space ranks as the #1 entertainment specialty network for total viewers, and in the 25-54, 18-49, and 18-34 demos.   If I'm reading that right, episodes one and two didn't go past 500k, while later episodes did, which means DM is growing in ratings! Great news!"

DarkMatter,3dzt9p,burgo666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:04:39 2015 UTC,"are you sure about that? no offense meant, but the description sounds like exactly the type of scifi i meant. its a lot of made up races/names,    honestly i don't know how to describe what im looking for beside saying ""realistic"" (which is a horrible description since we don't actually know anything about the cosmos and whats out there). i'm not against the intense futurism, i just need it slowly spoon fed to me.   .... i really hope that makes sense. for example though as cliche as it is of a comparison, the harry potter series. we learn about the other world with the character thus not over whelming us with backstory.  i can name other books instead (dresden, the name of the wind however all fantasy books) but that's definitely the most accessible for people and what im looking for in a sci fi medium ( enders game did it well, the dark tower... not so much {while i still enjoyed it, it's not what i'm looking for}_"
DarkMatter,3dzt9p,TheLantean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"""Old Man's War"" by John Scalzi is just what you need. Earth - where the main character comes from - is pretty much the boonies in this universe, so we learn everything though his eyes once he sets off on his journey. It all comes gradually at the right time and place, so don't worry about information overload.   Plus the author's writing style is very expressive, even witty at times, so there's no exposition/description hell."

DarkMatter,3dy7pb,smarzaquail,3,Mon Jul 20 14:38:41 2015 UTC,"The budget might be the same but the camerawork on shows like Humans, Matt Smith's Dr Who, Black Mirror are shot like the crew had lots of time. Maybe time is the difference."
DarkMatter,3dy7pb,jai_kasavin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:15:30 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about the budget primarily, since the amount of time they can take correlates with the funding they have.  When you look at which shows worked and for how long, you realize the creativity often comes out in the most unlikely and difficult circumstances.  I think of Star Trek TOS and the first Stars Wars film in contrast with their more self-indulgent sequels.  To bring this back to Dark Matter, this latest episode 6 was poorly written and executed, in my judgment, but I watched it anyway because I like the show.  The rough edges are part of it, and I like the feel."
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,FacehuntersAnonymous,7,Sun Jul 19 23:34:11 2015 UTC,"I could see why swords and knives would be popular in space as they can't cause hull breaches of space vessels and space stations, and the resulting catastrophic de-pressurisation. We did see on the mining planet that they used projectile weapons like guns, and energy weapons as well.   What I do like is the CGI of them going into FTL."
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,burgo666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:41:27 2015 UTC,Happy cake day! Your reasoning is perfect. Thank you.
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,after_glow,4,Mon Jul 20 22:48:03 2015 UTC,Not a given that they speak English. I know there weren't subtitles but it could be your typical 'here is a translation for the English speaking viewers at home.'  We also know that there are several megacorporations that are implied to have as much if not more power than the Galactic Authority.  I'm trying to remember some of Five's earlier memories to see if we can better guess who they applied to.
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,polyology,3,Mon Jul 20 01:08:45 2015 UTC,Five was also a theif
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,ShaneH7646,4,Sun Jul 19 23:42:31 2015 UTC,"For some reason, an empire very akin to Feudal Japan exists within this universe, if it's sovereign or subjected to the GA isn't revealed yet   In episode 4 during the news report, The GA refers to the Principality of Zairon (Four's homeland) and Republic of Pyr as independent territories, which suggests they are not under their control. Also according to the same report, the Principality and the Republic are on a war footing."
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,Tricky4279,3,Mon Jul 20 10:03:00 2015 UTC,"""Three: It's been revealed at the least that before the mindwipe he did have the mind of a criminal, being perfectly willing to space five with no remorse.""   I don't think this is necessarily truthful, especially since we know Five is very much alive and well. This could have been a means of understanding intentions in the quickest manner possible. You never really know the character of a person until their life is threatened and they are otherwise powerless to stop you.  Hell, the way the scene ended, we have no idea what Three and Five's original relationship was like. Nor do we know exactly when the memory is in relationship to Episode 1, although Five's friend was dead in the same place we left him in the memory, with life support in the ship having been shut off, so it's a good bet (although not a safe one) that this memory between Three and Five occurred near to the event that ended up wiping their memories, and probably even the same day if Five wasn't able to get medical attention for him, yet still survived long enough to get stasis podded."
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,DoctorDiscourse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, would be fun if Three turns out to be an ok guy, and One the worst of them all."
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,empty_place,2,Mon Jul 20 13:07:34 2015 UTC,I got a feeling that Two is the biggest scum of the bunch. Someone has to be able to keep the crew in check and get jobs done since they got a reputation. Four and Six aren't the leader type. Three doesn't inspire loyalty. One is just a shotgun rider. She must have something that make them follow her pre-wipe.
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,Zall-Klos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:58 2015 UTC,What mkes you think she was the leader before the wipe?
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,Zall-Klos,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:54 2015 UTC,She's the current leader. They don't have memories but still have traits for their original selves. Their handler only talk to Two even with the crew around.
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,Zall-Klos,2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:16 2015 UTC,"That's actually a fair point with McKay's response. It kind of makes it obvious that Two was the leader before. Which also implies they took a rather big risk talking to him, he could've easily deduced something was wrong if they didn't follow some proper protocol or some password."
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,clee-saan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:52 2015 UTC,I wonder how Four and Six decides to join and stay with the Raza. The leader must give them something very valuable. They weren't saints but didn't kill people for money and lols. And let's not forget how Two talked her way out of the jam in episode 2. Playing 2 sides against eachother.
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,clee-saan,2,Mon Jul 20 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"for whatever reason they like swords and throwing knives more than laser guns   Seemed to me that the guy Four killed with a throwing knife was about to pull a gun from inside his tunic, but Four was faster in throwing the knife."
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,8ra,2,Mon Jul 20 12:11:43 2015 UTC,If he and his soldiers had guns all along raised instead of swords they would'e just shot him from a distance though.
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,empty_place,2,Mon Jul 20 12:13:12 2015 UTC,They wanted to take him alive before he slit the two goon's throats though.
DarkMatter,3dvvhn,TheLantean,2,Mon Jul 20 12:24:07 2015 UTC,All the more reason to not use swords but fancy laser guns with a stun setting.
DarkMatter,3dsxr2,elstompy,2,Sun Jul 19 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"Badger was a gang leader though wasnt he? As well as having some legitimate authority position. Badger only used Mals crew when he needed deniablity or some other unique trait they had. He got them to do things his crew couldnt and paid them well in return because of the animosity between him and Mal. The fact that he did pay well was the only reason Mal took jobs from him. Calchek seems more like a middle man, like those twin dudes from the start of serenity, he arranges for the ship to do jobs for the gangs, Clacheks position would be between Mal and badger."
DarkMatter,3dsxr2,fatum_unus,2,Sun Jul 19 13:48:17 2015 UTC,Oh see I didn't think Calchek was only a middle man and I felt Badger sometimes was (although as a leader of his own crew) - so basically both a bit of both. Fair enough though. I was just already sensing a bit of Firefly from the show even though it's obviously not exact (on many levels) and felt Calchek might be their Badger.
DarkMatter,3dsxr2,fatum_unus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:03:15 2015 UTC,"The way i see it Badger was smarter than Calchek is, as well as more capable and fierce. Badger wouldnt have sent Mal onto a plague ship because he knew Mal would destroy it and then come back at him, as well as having to go to the corporations not only without anything but with the ship having been destroyed so a double loss. Badger also wouldnt have stood for anyone threatening him so abruptly, probably because he was more capable. Badger did sort of act as a middle man but he never worked for anyone but himself, if he did something for someone else it was so he could blackmail, threaten or extort them. Calchek seems to have worked directly for the bio corporation who owned the ship."
DarkMatter,3dsxr2,FacehuntersAnonymous,2,Sun Jul 19 14:34:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like your evaluation on it is way more exact than I was intending - I really was speaking only in vagueries. Like young girl who has abilities others don't - check, third party dude who gets them to do jobs who acts tougher than he probably actually is- check, tough guy who likes weapons and wants the payday - check. I'm in no way saying anyone is exact and there are many shows that have similar patterns - there are just a large number of them that are standing out for me and Calchek/Badger is one. It's totally cool you don't agree."

DarkMatter,3d1u3a,paris86,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:24:08 2015 UTC,"angsty    This word, I see it so often and it seems to mean absolutely nothing. All I know is that ""angst"" means fear in my native language. On the internet it just seems to mean ""You have an opinion I disagree with, let's throw out all the buzzwords."""
DarkMatter,3d1u3a,dat_unixbeard,4,Tue Jul 14 20:09:29 2015 UTC,I take it to mean internally emotionally tortured between reality and what you believe reality should be. I may be using it wrong but that's what I mean.
DarkMatter,3d1u3a,paris86,3,Wed Jul 15 00:50:36 2015 UTC,"That's how I see it as well, more or less... sort of an internal agony that you can't hide from others (and in the more derogatory usage, an internal agony that you exaggerate publicly to others). It describes One pretty damn well."
DarkMatter,3d1u3a,RobCubed,0,Wed Jul 15 04:12:32 2015 UTC,"If that is what it meant, then any form of political activism or whatever displeasure would be called angsty, which is clearly not how the term is used.

DarkMatter,3d1u3a,dat_unixbeard,2,Wed Jul 15 05:11:25 2015 UTC,"Angst is unfocussed.   ""Life sucks!"" is angst.  ""Systemic racism in the judicial system sucks, so I'll protest"" is not."

DarkMatter,3d1u3a,dat_unixbeard,6,Tue Jul 21 17:16:56 2015 UTC,"It was so out of the blue that I thought the first scene where Three is shirtless in her room had to be one of those silly TV misunderstandings (it looks like they are sleeping together but really she was checking an injury on his back or something). But nope, they apparently are hooking up. Maybe this will turn into some plot point eventually?"
DarkMatter,3d1u3a,Idleweiss,4,Sun Jul 12 21:25:44 2015 UTC,"I think we're a bit to used to women in TV/movies only having sex for an emotional attachment, while it's totally normal for the men to be in it for pleasure's sake. Two was (probably) interested in it for pleasure's sake, and Three is the best bet for that on this ship without too many strings.   One would be a clusterfuck of feelings. Four is (right now) apparently a cold-ass sociopath and would probably refuse sex in lieu of training/practice/discipline. In my opinion Six is gearing up to be the fatherly/caring type.   Three is really the only man on the ship available for this sort of encounter.  Unless there's some ulterior motive, which I don't really think there needs to be. Two just wants to get laid."
DarkMatter,3d1u3a,RobCubed,2,Wed Jul 15 04:14:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was fun seeing two protagonists just having fun sex. If it had been just a random girl from the space station people wouldn't  be wondering what's going on, I like that they presented it so casually."
DarkMatter,3d1u3a,empty_place,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"2 and 3 might be married or in a long term relationship.  Why?  Because they're the original crew of the ship along with 4 and 6.    4 may be a long term member.  6 seems like one of the newer members.  2 and 3 could have been a pirate couple.    Jace Corso was the freelancer, outsider.  He might be attracted to two but Two and Three knew each other for a long time before they lost their memories."
DarkMatter,3cy01w,drkensaccount,6,Sat Jul 11 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"Why would the cops need to go undercover? What would they possibly gain from it? Everyone on board is an extremely dangerous and most wanted person. If the cops could get to them i dont think they would try and infiltrate them, i just think they would try and bust them.

DarkMatter,3cv9wt,dat_unixbeard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:39:02 2015 UTC,Stargate definitely did it better. That was just the many worlds interpretation of quantum indeterminacy.

DarkMatter,3cv9wt,dat_unixbeard,3,Tue Jul 14 10:33:03 2015 UTC,"I think they mean biologically immortal, as in, never aging and dying from old age.  I'm sure you can still be sliced to pieces. There are limits to any healing factor and they can easily be established in any fiction:   Piccolo can only regenerate limbs and other non vital organs, if his vital organs are damaged the rest of his body just dies off before it can be regenerated, which kind of makes sense. Titans die when you cut out their neck Wolverine dies if you damage its bone marrow, luckily for him that's encased in adamantium."
DarkMatter,3cv9wt,recourse7,5,Tue Jul 14 11:12:33 2015 UTC,I think its more likely that the writers used the idea of a virus and wound healing to show that she is special.  A quick healing wound eh.. rapid wound healing is a scifi staple.   So adding in the viral infection shows that she is very different.

DarkMatter,3cv9wt,LTman86,8,Sat Jul 11 06:10:55 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Doom (silly movie) where the virus turns most people into monsters, but for a genetic few it turns them into super soldiers, or in this case immortal or what not.  Although, I'm starting to think the theory (can't remember which thread I saw it in) where they are all super advanced clones that don't die after 72 hours and the original bodies are hidden behind the vault door is starting to have some credibility to it. Except that would mean the original bodies have been locked up for more than 5 days (since they awoke and who knows how much longer). Maybe, as an advanced clone, they are able to adapt to any situation. Although, if that were true, I wonder how they got their hands on the tech and why would only they have it? I mean, it would make sense if the Raza (is that how they spell their ship name?) is so feared, they go in with no fear of ""dying"" since they could send another clone to do the job and retrieve their dead clone, so on and so forth.  Still, I'm wondering if the scan detected trace amounts of the virus on her skin or clothes (not in the wound or her blood), then the scan afterwards at the end didn't detect the virus anymore because it died after being exposed to air for so long."
DarkMatter,3cv9wt,PartyTimeMentats,6,Sat Jul 11 08:06:15 2015 UTC,"What this guy said. The virus did what it was supposed to do. Just not on everyone.  However, I think her healing might be a something she's had for a longer time."
DarkMatter,3cv9wt,DredPRoberts,4,Sat Jul 11 21:12:27 2015 UTC,"I think her immunity is from something from her forgotten past.   It  makes more sense than she was randomly lucky.   For example, she is from an uber rich family that already has immortality from the virus."

She basically said no already and is now involved with someone else get over it. 1's only real value thus far is as a voice of good. A Creepy voice of good is of little use.  2 and 3 being horny for each other might be realistic but, it's not actually appealing for me as the audience. Horny isn't an attribute that's interesting when you don't have many potential pairings as since your horny you'll cycle through them quickly.  I think I'll give it another week or two but at this point the only characters I like are 4, 6, and the Android."
DarkMatter,3cv9wt,dat_unixbeard,9,Sat Jul 11 16:47:45 2015 UTC,"I never got the idea that characters should be likeable as people, that's just not good for storytelling to make everyone likeable as people.  Yeah, one is an obnoxious goody-goody guy who's naïve as fuck, three is an asshole. Makes for good storytelling, if three wasn't arguing the bleaker side of things and one wasn't there to oppose him, those morning table debates they have all the time would be a lot less interesting.  Hell, it's completely unrealistic that they even have morning dinner together as a group all the time, who even cooks that stuff? But it does make for interesting storytellig."
DarkMatter,3cv9wt,worldbuildingvsconte,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"I think this is probably an area we'd agree to disagree. If I can't say I like more than 1/2 of the regulars the odds of my making it through a full season are low. Currently, 1, 2, 3 appear to dominate screen time and have low appeal.  A character doesn't have to be a good person to be likeable. They just need to have more things that are cool or interesting about them then they have downsides. I like the character that trained Dutch in Killjoys even though he is an absolute monster because at the present the level of effectiveness and mystery he generates exceeds his crimes. He'd be terrifying IRL but because it's a tv show some leeway exists. But, their are also limits.  Visuals, audio, and likeability are a shield that prevents my mind from picking a work to shreds.   Unless the product has got good writing it's likely not going to stand up to that. I've read lots of Sci-Fi unless you've got a excellent new concept I've seen read it before and chances are I've seen a better version of it.  Consider the Android fight scene  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0WGxAsBxlw  One gradually becomes curious why we aren't seeing more of them in combat if they fight like that.  2's regen isn't that interesting because we've seen regeneration in many other sci-fi items and no real details exist regarding it thus far.  4 on the other hand became more interesting when we found out about the ring as we actually have some idea of where he came from."
DarkMatter,3cv9wt,CurtisManning,6,Sat Jul 11 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"I understand your points about One and Three, but I like Two. Obviously, the love triangle is lame, but Two and Three's fling can be explained by the fact that Two knows One will get emotionally attached to her if they start playing together, and she's not ready for that because she doesn't who he is (and who she is).  Anyway, regardless of the love triangle, Two strikes me as a very strong character. She's the driving force of the band, and that's quite impressive considering all the macho power we have onboard.  Two and Six are currently my favorite, with Four and the Android next, and Five, Three and One are the ones I like the least."

They know they're all killers and can't be trusted.  But let's fuck because I can't go a minute without it.  Are they teenagers in puberty?

The sexual tension between Jack and Sam was pretty obvious, it started off as being implied and eventually it was pretty much canon that they had feelings for each other they couldn't act upon because of Jack being Sam's direct superior.   The known killers, who believe there's a traitor needing to fuck? Yea that's about as out of character as we can get. Then one of them falling in love with a known killer?

The life support was already about to fail throughout the rest of the ship, or was under control of the android. Either way, all of the zombies could be killed off.

I read a book as a teenager for instance wherein starships spent many months accelerating and decelerating to like 95% of the speed of light. That's more something you'd encounter in hard sci-fi."

Hard sci-fi typically comes with a very thorough scientific explanation of everything and doesn't try to do anything that is impossible, which makes the name an oxymoron. It's not science-fiction at all, a better term for it would in fact be science-fact.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetes this is commonly cited as an example I guess."

The universes aren't all that different, so it could be done with minor retcons (allowing the Galactic Authority and the Reclamation Agents to fit together), assuming both shows get renewed."
DarkMatter,3c8scw,TheLantean,3,Mon Jul 6 02:53:37 2015 UTC,I wonder how good of a marketing strategy it would be to have multiple shows share a universe. People would feel compelled to watch the other show.

Even after the ""original"" Corso excluded the clone theory I would still consider it possible as governmental secret organizations always are ahead in terms of technology compared to what is publicly known. Or maybe a secret/unknown faction was responsible for cloning them. Point is, it cannot be excluded from the options just yet."

The corp that deals with this could also just keep it secret, it would make financial sense."

DarkMatter,3c25l8,DoctorDiscourse,9,Sat Jul 4 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"There sure were talking about Clones a bunch here. Six's entire ordeal at the doctor's office seemed to be really focused on it with a substantial amount of screentime devoted to it.  So a couple of theories:  -Maybe One had himself cloned before he left, and otherJace is that clone.   -Maybe One is the clone of Jace, but that wouldn't make sense. (No, seriously.. think about it. If we go along the idea that One is a clone, then otherJace has no memory of being scanned, so it's not feasible.  -One may have been an imposter set up to wipe the Raza's memories but screwed it up. Perhaps he did actually have reconstructive surgery to look like Jace.   Considering how much effort this episode was spent on talking about the whole cloning procedure and what benefits it has, (Seriously, an inordinate amount of time was spent filming and making an otherwise fake promo for something that's not plot relevant.) we're looking at a Chekov's Gun of some sort. I think we're going to find out later that Jace cloned himself before leaving to be in two places at once. This clone was specially made to last indefinitely (in the event Jace was killed on this mission or betrayed by the Raza), so otherJace is basically pre-wipe One's insurance policy of sorts."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,Ioan_Ranger,4,Sat Jul 4 07:53:58 2015 UTC,"On Six's wanted posted in the Doc's office, it said subject 18- something, and he was right in suggesting that that there wouldnt have been alerts out on every criminal. I imagine that this Transportation company with the clones actually managed to make clones that last longer than so many days.  During the commercial it was stated that the memories from the clone bodies were taken away and uploaded to the original. So the pods on the Raza were likely outfitted prototypes that could take the memories, and maybe Five tampered with the pods so the memories wouldnt be lost alltogether?  But if one of them is a clone its likely theyre all clones, and the company probably figured out a way to scan unobtrusively or get cloning material from DNA or some such, cause thats the only way they'd get the cloning material of Prince Ryu realistically.  Plus' the Original Jace Corvo was prevented from going on the mission by an Anonymous tip, and while that couldve been clone Jace its also possible it was a company.  Why have one team of mercenaries flying about the galaxy doing missions when you can have the same team flying about the galaxy multiple times with clones."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,DoctorDiscourse,4,Sat Jul 4 08:41:30 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem with the idea that the crew are clones: OtherJace stated outright he doesn't remember being scanned. The show was very quick to get both One and Three believing without question that One must be an imposter, but it doesn't make sense for otherJace to be realJace in a clone situation.  They also have been told that the memory wipe was 'haphazard' or 'slapdash'. And there's no reason the rest of the ship's electronic memory would be wiped if this wasn't intentional.  No, I think the crew of the ship are the real deal, One got cloned as a personal insurance policy (with otherJace being that clone), but at some point (and Five knows this for sure) someone on the crew deliberately wiped everyone's memories and erased all trace on the ship.  Since otherJace seemed to be a genuinely bad guy, and the show looking to focus on Four as also a legitimately bad guy next episode, the candidates for who took their memories is narrowed:  Two: Still remotely plausible, but considering she seems to very much be the captain of the ship, it's unlikely. Maybe she wanted to turn over a new leaf and brought in everyone do a full reset. We know her and the Android may be keeping secrets.   Three: Sure his post-wipe demeanor seems kind of douchey, but his personality could easily match that of an Undercover cop of some sort.   Five: This would make some sense except the memory wipe was 'hurried' and 'rushed'. I don't think with Five's tech savvy that she'd screw up a job like that.   Six: Leading candidate for the memory wiper. Seems to have a conscience, maternal instincts. Would set off alarms as a possible undercover agent. Would make a lot of sense that the memory wipe was rushed and hurried because he might not have known what he was doing.   The dead kid: Maybe Five had a bad girl streak and she joined up with the Raza, and the dead kid might be her brother. (Not sure why any of the crew didn't dna test him.) Her brother may have set up the protocol to try and try and create angels out of bad guys but Five found him and killed him after he had already sabotaged the stasis pods."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,TheCavis,3,Sat Jul 4 09:18:00 2015 UTC,"OtherJace stated outright he doesn't remember being scanned.   And memories are such permanent, immutable things in this universe."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,dat_unixbeard,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"Why would EyelinerJace care so much then, because then he knew that One is a clone?"
DarkMatter,3c25l8,DoctorDiscourse,4,Sat Jul 4 08:11:39 2015 UTC,"if he's the clone pre-memory wipe (this show is getting super convoluted if that's a legit sentence) then of course he'd believe himself to be real. Would kind of fuck with the whole 'clone experience' thing they were selling otherwise. Think about it, if you knew you were a clone that was expected to die at some point in the near future, then most of your thoughts will be about your impending death and not of the fun time you're supposed to be having while realYou is supposed to get a 'good' set of memories.   There's no way that otherJace is realJace in this scenario if anyone is a clone of anyone else, and honestly.. they spent an awful lot of time talking about clones this episode for it not to be relevant. Even if they're a red herring, there was a serious amount of production time devoted to it.. far more than there really should be."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,Mini-Marine,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:37:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the clones know they're clones.  They've got all the person's memories and personality, basically you know you're in a disposable body, and all the experiences you're having will go back to your real head when you're done while the body is disposed of."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,DoctorDiscourse,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:01:00 2015 UTC,"Think about the thought process a clone would go through if they knew they were a clone and their entire existence was a short snippet of time.  -I'm a clone.  -I'm going to die in 3-5 days.  -The real version of me sees me a disposable product.  -Depression, sadness, negative emotion of choice.   Stages of Grief would take over as well, with the clone ignoring any directives in order to bargain to extend their own lives.   There's no way that a Clone who knows they are a clone and this rosy picture of taking a clone-vacation would work. It doesn't make any sense. So the easiest method for solving this is to ensure the Clone doesn't know they're a clone, so they have the 'experience' the customer paid for."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,Mini-Marine,3,Sun Jul 5 05:20:04 2015 UTC,"The clone doesn't have it's own personality or concerns, it just has the personality of the traveller, who knows they are in s disposable body, so they can do whatever the hell they want without fear of repercussions because their actual body of safe and sound back home.  They know that the last night of their trip, they'll go to sleep in their clone body and wake up in their actual body.  They don't give half a rat's ass what happens to the disposable body after their consciousness is out of it."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,DoctorDiscourse,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:28:42 2015 UTC,"Calling them travellers implies that the conscious mind is transferred from point A to point B, which is not the case. You may want to rewatch the sequence again. Effectively the person's memories are copied and sent digitally, and stored onto a cloned body, which is then recycled at the end of it's lifespan.   It makes sense that otherJace would not know he's a clone because the company's business model doesn't really function unless the clones are in the dark about their origin."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,Mini-Marine,4,Sun Jul 5 12:37:43 2015 UTC,"I understand that the consciousness itself does not travel, but a copy of the original consciousness, that has the knowledge of how the process works.  The person knows they are riding around in a rented body, and all of their experiences will be uploaded back to their own mind soon as their done, while the disposable body that they're borrowing is disposed of.  The clone not being aware that it's a clone doesn't make any sense.  It would mean false memories would have to be implanted about how it got to where it is and how it plans to get back.

If we accept that everyone's behaving like their core personality pre-wipe, then One likely never had EyelinerJace's memories and personality. CloneJace would be more aggressive and deadly than the moralistic puppy that One's playing.   If One is some sort of long-lasting clone, it's far more likely that he's either a cop (see: the attempted arrest that caused him to rabbit before boarding the Raza) or maybe the elusive Rothgar who was heading out to save the miners.

DarkMatter,3c25l8,cyrusol,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"She's really not much different from Data (TNG) in her behavior. Or its. Its behavior.  Humans sometimes behave illogical. Humans are accustomed to other humans behaving illogical. Androids aren't. Therefore the reaction of android's may seem illogical to humans while they are actually very logical.  Example: ""But I can smell them [their pheromones]."" - Why would a human not like to know additional information about himself, that he by himself could not directly anticipate?  You have to see it from an android's POV."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,dat_unixbeard,0,Sun Jul 5 16:32:43 2015 UTC,It's just super unrealistic that a robot can produce and understand human language with all its nuances but not human social behaviour.  Getting a machine to produce completely human-like English is actually about as hard as getting it to understand social behaviour. The way you do it is to ape how humans do it and make a self-learning neural algorithm.

Griffin in the Doctors office had the information, that they could construct a body and send the memories to the created one, with All Physical Capabilities.  Hence why they all had instincts with weapons and combat, but an error occurred and all the memories were planted into the little girl."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,Mars445,2,Thu Jul 9 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"Welcome to /r/DarkMatter!   But doesn't this episode confirm they are all clones?   Not exactly, in this series normal clones only last two to three days.   According to the commercial they are ""able to maintain biological integrity for a period of up to 72 hours"" and BarJace doesn't think they're clones either: ""besides, dupes have an average shelf life of two to three days and I've been chasing you down for months; no, you're not a clone."" He then goes on to mention a long lost twin as a far-fetched theory and points to reconstructive surgery as the most likely possibility. Of course, we could speculate that they could be more advanced clones custom made to last longer and BarJace is simply unaware that option exists.   So at this time the episode doesn't really confirm it, it just adds another possibility to the pot."
DarkMatter,3c25l8,cyrusol,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:06:01 2015 UTC,"Well think about it. If the ads were like, we make a clone of you, and it's there forever. Just think to yourself of all the ways that could go terribly wrong. Additionally, those are commercial clones, I would be willing to bet, like The Sixth Day they can make clones last much longer, but they limit it for reasons. Also using clones that only live for a few days is a perfect strategy for Mega Corps who want to clear out unruly people, like the mining colony.  The crew woke up and was about a day from the Mining Colony they were supposed to kill, after 3 days they breakdown into their components and the corporation never has to worry about loose ends. Along with them just cloning whomever they feel like to fill the crew, it explains why even the The Raza is a very well known group, the crew is unidentifiable. Because the company can just clone a new batch of randoms, since the memories only returned if the body got to a facility to be sent back.  So it seems like something went wrong with the cloning and they get to live much longer. Also the little girl, she was in the exact same type of container as the Cloning one, though it could be a standard design.  Actually now that I think about it, if she was in the cloning box, that means a clone of hers was out and about for 3 days, and she got all of their memories because they were all sent back to her."

DarkMatter,3c25l8,dat_unixbeard,4,Sat Jul 4 18:16:56 2015 UTC,"Probably the weakest episode thusfar in my opinion, the only thing really happening was the ring being revealed to be something important and the whole thing with One and EyelinerJace.

DarkMatter,3c25l8,Guglio08,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:12:46 2015 UTC,Agreed. Kind of developed some of the characters - six in the doctors waiting room was kind of cool. He was very polite and patient for a guy wanted for murder and what not. So a nice take on the idea that we learn to be bad - take away those memories and we are nice underneath. The interaction between one and three was fun - I can see some fun dialogue emerging between these two. But the rest felt like filler and didn't really take the story forward.
DarkMatter,3c25l8,Dan_Keane,4,Mon Jul 6 08:40:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of weird, the episode was fun but it didn't advance enough stuff so it's not that memorable.  One thing the show does well enough though is that after every episode all the fans come with theories about what's going to happen and what is going on. If you're a show with some big mystery, if you get everyone to talk about it and discuss each other's hypotheses about that then you're doing something right I guess."

DarkMatter,3brjiy,BastardOfDriftmark,4,Tue Jul 7 19:41:18 2015 UTC,When first viewing the promotional material for both Dark Matter and Killjoys I was super pumped for Killjoys but dreading the idea of watching Dark Matter... It looked so much like an attempt to recreate SGU.  But I did my duty and watched out of respect for the writers and so far it has been a really pleasant surprise! Meanwhile Killjoys feels like a disorganized fantasy adventure that fails to strike any emotional chord what-so-ever.  I hope ratings continue to rise because I for one am excited to see where they take things. Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie are pretty legendary when it comes to building a logical universe with solid continuity :)
DarkMatter,3bqfwo,awe300,7,Wed Jul 1 09:00:39 2015 UTC,"I've watched the shit out of SG-1 and Atlantis a couple years back, and was a huge fan of both. IMO, there's not much similarity between those shows and Dark Matter. If anything, it's a bit more like SGU in terms of setting - due to the fact that most events have taken place on a ship.  On the other hand, the show seems quite enjoyable for now (although IMO if it doesn't pick up the pace it can get quite frustrating soon). I'd say that in the complete abscence of good sci-fi series that we've all been living in for quite some time, shows like Dark Matter, and maybe Killjoys - should definately be given a chance.  But honestly, the standard nowadays is so low, that i'll watch anything i don't immediately find outrageously idiotic, so you probably shouldn't listen to my advice :)"
DarkMatter,3bqfwo,chaotic_moose,2,Wed Jul 1 10:32:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say Dark Matter is some-what in between SGU and SG-1 in terms of ""seriousness, darkness, story arc, drama"" level etc. It's not quite as far going in that as Universe was.  Also, most importantly, dark matter has ""unrealistic comic relief"", just funny situations which would never occur in real live that SG1 and SGA were full of  but SGU completely dropped. Just Eli made an occasional wisecrack, but those were just things people could've realistically said in real life.  In dark matter, even though each episode advances the plot they are still more or less self contained and thus far seem to all deal with a problem of that week and solve it. Whereas in Universe the first 5 episodes were pretty much one continual thing and he next one started where the former one picked off and you in general could not afford to miss a single episode to still make sense of it."
DarkMatter,3bqfwo,dat_unixbeard,-1,Thu Jul 2 10:19:48 2015 UTC,"One can only hope that Dark Matter will have a decent overall plot - or mythology, if anyone still uses the term. And that the show will have some proper character arcs. The latter actually seems quite likely already.  SGU rant"
DarkMatter,3bqfwo,chaotic_moose,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:52:05 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how you can call SGU's characters ""one dimensional"" while saying you like SG1 and SGA. Both had way more one dimensional characters, 99% of SG1 and SGA's characters with the exception of Todd, McKay and Ba'al can pretty much be summed up as ""magnificent infallible perfect good human being"" and ""evil scumbag alien with no morality and a god complex""."
DarkMatter,3bqfwo,dat_unixbeard,0,Thu Jul 2 10:59:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I must have not make myself clear. I don't see a problem with one-dimentional characters in general - hell, I enjoy them. It's just that characters being good or not depends heavily on their context.  Just like you said earlier, the SG series were very different in their tone, seriousness and atmosphere. That kinda made me watch them with different expectations and quality standards - and in the end be quite disappointed with SGU.  Wouldn't you agree that, for example, Firefly's crew just wouldn't work in Star Trek TNG, and the pilots from BSG would look very weird in SG1?  On an unrelated note, SGU characters might have been just poorly written, idk. That might be a personal thing, but I definitely remember hating most of them with fiery passion :D"

DarkMatter,3bqfwo,rodneyleavins,3,Thu Jul 2 03:25:30 2015 UTC,This show reminds me more of Firefly and Andromeda than stargate
DarkMatter,3bqfwo,AppYeR,3,Sun Jul 5 02:06:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Startgate Atlantis, but I have seen Stargate. This is different, Stargate is militaristic, vanguard of humanity stuff, basically the characters in Stargate are supposed to represent the best of humanity as a whole, and us as a species pushing further and overcoming our limitations and flaws (usually represented by the bad military guys in Stargate). And it's basically a very optimistic series where doing the right thing produces positive results. Other SF series have the same ""vanguard of humanity"" spirit, like Star Trek or Babylon 5.  Dark Matter is different, without getting into details/spoilers it's basically a group of outcasts trying to find a place for themselves, so I doubt they will end up forming any kind of vanguard of humanity, this will probably go more in the direction of the group growing closer as they get to know each other, each one of them fighting their own demons, and stuff like that. More in the direction of something like Firefly than the series mentioned above. So the conflicts will involve personal issues and not so much humanity as a whole issues.  Now, this is no Firefly, the characters in Dark Matter are way more stereotypical as of episode 3, I think it has a lot of potential if they start breaking the stereotypes, which they already did slightly. But if they fall in the trap of following strictly the stereotypes this may turn boring very fast.  Also, I fucking hate useless magical girls, I hope she doesn't start having panic attacks when she ""feels the darkness"" or some bullshit like that. She has been polite until now and she seems to be handy with technology in addition to being magical, which gives me hope that she won't become completely useless. Heck even in Firefly which was great as a series, their magical girl made me angry every time she was on screen."

Obviously the selling point of this show is going to be the story arc and the overarching plot so it's great to see they aren't just making it up as they go along.  If anyone has ever seen Earth: Final Conflict, the discrepancy in quality of the start and the end was pretty big, it was pretty clear at the start they knew exactly what direction they wanted to go into.

Although they fired the show creator early and the quality started slipping, it wasn't really bad (why yes, I didn't mind Hercules in space) until the final season. Andromeda Season 5 spoilers  But just because there is a plan doesn't mean a show is safe from the season 5 curse - as evidenced by Babylon 5.

At the last minute it received an unexpected season 5 pickup. Despite all the world building and a few dangling threads to provide continuity, instead of continuing to grow the B5 universe to make a worthy fifth season (and perhaps more after that) he simply spun out after his plan was no longer viable.   An interesting fact - Stargate SG1 was put in a similar situation (potential cancellation and then revival) several times, first the move from Showtime to Scifi, then a few touch and go seasons at Scifi, then a ""Stargate Command"" spinoff which never happened, then right when Atlantis launched (the plan was to end SG1 there, not have two shows airing concurrently) yet it never nose-dived.

I feel this is probably what happened with EFC as well, the show was in constant danger of cancellation, so at the end of season 4 they sort of sought to wrap it up. Way too soon. The show was also plagued with many actors leaving the show which obviously required plans to change. Though, EFC handled actor departure probably the best I've ever seen. It wasn't a case of ""Gone, now never mention them ever again."", they talked about those people. The way they were written out typically felt very much like it advanced the plot rather than done for real world easons.

In fact the final seasons with the Ori were my favorite.   They were actually ""this close"" of rebranding the final two seasons under a different name I heard.

DarkMatter,3bgw9w,traderarpit4,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:27:42 2015 UTC,And for some reason it's called 'F.T.L faster than light.' Its name is literally faster than light faster than light.
DarkMatter,3bgw9w,Wyatt1313,0,Fri Jul 10 01:35:41 2015 UTC,Tis like saying DC comics. And I knew that.
DarkMatter,3bgw9w,traderarpit4,3,Fri Jul 10 04:08:49 2015 UTC,"I think Battlestar Galactica (BSG) really popularised the term, as they were constantly ""spooling up the FTL"". Then Stargate Universe (SGU) started using it, and now it's everywhere.  Sounds better than ""warp drive"" or ""hyperspace"" in my opinion."
DarkMatter,3bgw9w,Viper_H,2,Tue Jun 30 09:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i like it better, too.  Sounds more modern and doesn't try to explain the tech."

DarkMatter,3bdaar,ShaneH7646,13,Sun Jun 28 03:19:55 2015 UTC,They all would have initially assumed that she was harmless. So when there was no data their assumptions were re-affirmed so there wasn't much cause to question it.
DarkMatter,3bdaar,AppYeR,4,Sun Jun 28 04:44:27 2015 UTC,"Probably because they were all reeling from the revelation that they used to be criminals.   I think they gave the 'Five is missing from the data' a small amount of attention though. They gave it some more attention in the most recent episode, but I think they're saving the Five reveals for later because her character is the most divorced from the rest of the crew."
DarkMatter,3bdaar,DoctorDiscourse,0,Sun Jun 28 13:40:16 2015 UTC,"but I think they're saving the Five reveals for later because her character is the most divorced from the rest of the crew.   Lucky Jodelle Ferland. It's pretty obvious that Five is going to be the breakout character simply because she's the most different from anyone else. She's the kid, on top of that, she has an unnatural hair colour, on top of that, she's the one who has everyone's memories and she's the only non criminal. Characters like that tend to end up everyone's favourite.  My guess is that six is going to be the most forgettable and he's already not getting a lot of memorable scenes. He doesn't have something that defines him and it almost feels like he's the ""token black guy"", producers realizing at the last moment ""Oh my god, we don't have a black character yet."" and just quickly making one without actually giving them attributes. It's happened waaay too often. Aiden Ford, Travis Mayweather. Obviously not all black characters fill this trope but it does happen surprisingly often that there's black guy on the show who has no defining charactaristics to him and was probably added as an afterthought."
DarkMatter,3bdaar,dat_unixbeard,3,Sun Jun 28 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"Six has displayed 4 very specific traits that do define him. If anything, Four and probably One are decidedly less fleshed out than Six.   -Six is practically maternal, sort of a den-mother-esque quality to him.   -Six knows how the fly the shuttle, which indicates some level of flight training.  -Six also demonstrated medical training in episode 2. He doesn't seem to know the science minutae (per Five's little factoid seeming to go over his head), so I'd peg him as likely an army field medic of some sort. More practical knowledge than book knowledge.   -Six seems to be immediately considered by Two to be her second in command whenever she can't be around to do things.   Compare to One:  -Hero Complex.   -Jack-of-all-trades.   Compare to Four:  -Uses melee weaponry.  -Stoic."
DarkMatter,3bdaar,DoctorDiscourse,3,Sun Jun 28 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Six is my favorite character so far, with Two. He's cool, he's badass, and he knows how to deal with stuff. He's the less caricaturical of the dudes, because One is the Hero, Three is the Anti-Hero and Four is the Asian swordsman..."
DarkMatter,3bdaar,CurtisManning,4,Sun Jun 28 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"my wife commented that while six has some substance to him - four feels like the ""token asian martial artist"" of the show."

DarkMatter,3bdaar,symes,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:13:53 2015 UTC,Or the more likely explanation (which I believe was alluded to at some point in episode 2 and mentioned directly in episode 3) that Five is . My current headcanon:

DarkMatter,3b9fvh,CausaMortis,18,Sat Jun 27 05:48:57 2015 UTC,It clearly was eyeliner. The more eyeliner the more evil obviously.
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,GooglePlex9000,5,Sat Jun 27 09:08:32 2015 UTC,lol. I stand corrected
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,GooglePlex9000,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:25:52 2015 UTC,"It's a nice twist, and explains how One is so much more goody two shoes than the rest of them. He's actually not Jace, but an imposter. Probably the one who hacked their memories. I like where this is going.  Plenty of cheese, with a lot of cliche characters and lines, but overall it's shaping up to be interesting."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,UTC_Hellgate,18,Thu Jul 2 00:58:13 2015 UTC,Great episode!  But... I wish they did more with the dead kid. I assume he broke the system? He had a card in that box. (EDIT: Now that I had some time to think... It may be the card for the android? maybe he took the original one out and put a hostile one in?) Also the gun. I assume he shot himself to cover it up?  Loved the twist at the end. Hoping it leads to a lot more
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,sirin3,10,Sat Jun 27 05:46:59 2015 UTC,"I liked the first two episodes, but this one definitely felt more...cohesive? The characters felt a bit more like people vs walking cliches.   Knowing only what we know, I'd have to wonder if the memory wipe isn't a red herring. The kid snuck aboard, wiped the memories for revenge(These are bad people remember) and somehow managed to kill himself.   It would be somewhat refreshing IMO if it wasn't some big, mega conspiracy."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,Viper_H,6,Sat Jun 27 07:05:33 2015 UTC,"If we count the android, the kid was number 8.  That makes the android seven of eight.  That means there still has to be some other undiscovered person on the ship.  I wonder who, and where they are hiding"

DarkMatter,3b9fvh,groinkick,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems to me that was the case. Or it's the memories of One that led her there, and it's his gun."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,dat_unixbeard,25,Thu Jul 2 00:59:39 2015 UTC,I'm assuming they're clones. It reminds me of an episode of Stargate SG-1.  The Jace in the bar is the actual Jace.
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,Dinger2013,14,Sat Jun 27 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that BarJace is actual Jace. However, I'm pretty sure that our One/Jace isn't a clone but an imposter.  Jace's personality doesn't fit with being a hardcore pirate. He doesn't seem to have the martial skills of the others on the team. A clone probably would be a copy of Jace or a husk, but someone with Future Plastic Surgery to look and sound like Jace would be like this: different and somewhat skilled but not up to par.  Non-Comic Reader Speculation: Watching episode one closely shows that our Jace is probably the saboteur, being alarmed that the Android can repair her memory. He also may be in cahoots with the Android considering it stopped it's attack on the crew in Episode 1 when it got a good look at his face. They just assumed they turned it off in time.  Now in Episode Three we have a scene where the android and Jace come up with a plan to do a round of lie detection. What we probably didn't see was him giving the Android orders to give a false positive for his testimony.  Love the show and curious to see if these theories pan out."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,dat_unixbeard,7,Sat Jun 27 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"My theory is that it's two who wiped the memories and that she still has all of them. My evidence:   Two knew about the existence of the Mikkei combine and where to find them. Two told five to keep quiet about the memory thing to the rest of the crew. We see this scene in ep. 3 where Two asks the android to do something and keep quiet about it, but what it is is never revealed. This is probably the part where she gives the android some order to in the case of stuff being tested not reveal that she is lying."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,avrus,2,Sat Jun 27 17:57:37 2015 UTC,It is revealed what Two asks the android to do. She had the android look into all terminal activity prior to thier last deep sleep.  She wanted to make sure Fives story checked out before she told the rest of the crew.
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,powerse5,4,Sun Jun 28 05:13:13 2015 UTC,"Where is it revealed that that was the thing she asked the android to ""keep quiet about"". She just said she had the android do that, it might not be the thing they taled about earlier.  One assumes she asked the android to check the terminal activity the moment she heard that stuff from Five."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,timgorden11,2,Sun Jun 28 13:11:51 2015 UTC,"I like that theory. I hadn't even considered it, so I should probably go back and rewatch."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,lochyw,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I'm thinking as well! So a recap of what I think: One is an imposter, and the one that wiped their memories. The gun that Five found is his, and she's on his trail through his memories. Before the wipe, I'm thinking that Five and One where together in this. That's why there's no record of her of the kid on the ship. The only one that was supposed to be known to the crew is One. Five and the kid where hidden.  I still don't know where they are going with that, but I can't wait to see it :)"
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,GooglePlex9000,5,Thu Jul 2 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"When the Android was working on the ship, it looked like they reused the sets from Stargate Atlantis, with those hallways they had."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,dat_unixbeard,12,Sun Jun 28 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"Well I liked this episode much more than the first 2 (or more specifically the miners plot and really bad action scenes from the first 2) One is still by far the crew member I like the least, he's just so predictably goody goody, hopefully this evil twin makes him more interesting."

DarkMatter,3b9fvh,Akial,5,Mon Jun 29 03:37:22 2015 UTC,"Three made a pretty big mistake of showing them his guns indeed could not fire though. If you're in that spot you just keep aiming and say ""You wanna take your chances?""  Also, what's with the bullets in sci-fi, shouldn't they have some kind of super laser beam death ray phaser guns or something?"
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,dat_unixbeard,4,Mon Jun 29 06:06:06 2015 UTC,"I reckon with the FTL travel and the rest of the space stuff there is a suspension of disbelief with how it all looks, but in something as personal as a gunfight then it would look very unrealistic and tacky to have lasers firing everywhere - but that is just my opinion."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,sirin3,2,Mon Jun 29 16:18:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, why?  I especially love it when those energy blasts are actually slower moving than bullets. Like in Star Wars, blaster shots seem super slow.  I wonder if a Jedi could still reflect a machine gun firing rounds with a light sabre."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,dat_unixbeard,2,Mon Jun 29 16:22:29 2015 UTC,"They have guns in the SW universe, they just call them slug throwers."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,sirin3,2,Tue Jun 30 06:14:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting:   For example, during the days of the Galactic Republic, mercenaries fearing an intervention by Jedi Knights used rapid-fire slugthrowers that were impossible to completely deflect with a lightsaber, unlike blaster bolts.   I remember having a discussion with someone where I argued that Jedi would not be able to deflect a good old kinetic projectile with their lightsabres and that blasters may seem fancy, they are in fact terrible weapons because the projectile is super slow.  Got argued back that apparently a Jedi could still block machine gun shots which I found incredulous, but apparently canonically they can't, so I win."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,dat_unixbeard,13,Tue Jun 30 12:22:07 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one disappointed with the acting and some of the useless dialog leading into scenes (like number 1 asking number 2 ""what about the sabotage"", as if they didn't all already know that it was just a faulty part)?  #1 doing CPR on #6 was cringe-worthy."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,jb211,10,Sat Jun 27 22:04:37 2015 UTC,"#1 doing CPR on #6 was cringe-worthy.   To be fair doing CPR correctly on a healthy person can be potentially life threatening - it can induce arrhythmia and usually results in a few broken ribs/sternum plus significant bruising.   But yeah, maybe they could have used a dummy and CGI'd Six's head in, or created a fake head like in episode 2. However... budget.   To me the dialogue seemed to flow a little better compared to episodes one and two, made them seem more like real people."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,Viper_H,9,Sun Jun 28 00:11:25 2015 UTC,"Well, this show is certainly looking to at least go some-where. At the first half of the episode I felt the pace was too slow with not a lot really happening but the last half picked up a lot and that final reveal was of course pretty damning. Of course, one assumes the second Jace Corso knows the name Jace Corso's pretty wanted so why just give his name out like that?  Couple of observations.   Some of the dialogue is absolutely hilarious. The android has a super funny way of stating the obvious. The rest of the characters use the singular-they, the android says ""he or she"", the grammar nazi inside me says the android wins. My mind does a double take every time I see that thinking they are referring to multiple people. I thought no one liking Five at the start was going to be some plot point, apparently not. In true sci-fi magic, locks can be overridden simply by shorting two wires, what's the use of security codes if anyone with knowledge of the lock has a master key apparently. In many ways, four seams a lot darker than three. Four is just more considerate about it and doesn't flaunt it as much. Subtle sexual tension remains as subtle as ever."

DarkMatter,3b9fvh,SecretBlogon,2,Sat Jun 27 19:42:21 2015 UTC,ut just click a panel lose and connecting two wires as long as you know which two.   That is still  much more work then the card trick
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,dat_unixbeard,3,Sat Jun 27 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"Well, that's a bad lock, just like the lock on that ship was bad."
DarkMatter,3b9fvh,WolfintheShadows,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:34:10 2015 UTC,"No. Not at all actually. Most mechanical locks can be easily overriden with what is called a Bump key. It's a really easy technique that does require a little bit of specialised hardware (a hammer and a key that has it's teeths set to 0) and just a little bump on the key. As long as it's a tumbler type of mechanical lock (which most homes have) and you have the correct number of bumps (which is really easy, since there's not a lot of permutation in the number of bumps) well you're in in less than 10 seconds. Without any damage. Nowadays, more complex locks have been invented, but are not in wide usage, and digital locks and alarm systems exists..but still.

DarkMatter,3b9fvh,HippieWizard,6,Sun Jun 28 00:14:45 2015 UTC,"Aside from being conveniently person-sized, you really do need vents - and lots of them - to mix the atmosphere throughout the ship, otherwise you get pockets of dead air. Equipment and maintenance costs would make it impractical for every room to have its own separate life support, there's probably a central air reprocessing unit for the whole ship somewhere.   This is especially important when artificial gravity is not on since you can't even rely on convection.

DarkMatter,3b2f1p,NDIrishB13,3,Thu Jun 25 12:38:32 2015 UTC,I kinda wish this episode would be them arriving at the space station. They should be world-building early on (Who's at the space station?  Where to next?) rather than having some sort of enclosed mystery/drama/thriller right after the pilot. This sort of episode should be in the middle of a season.
DarkMatter,3b13xm,TheLantean,8,Thu Jun 25 03:05:21 2015 UTC,I'm very glad this show is apparently written well in advance instead of making it up as they go along. Fills with confidence it won't be some BS.  It's pretty clear at least to me they already have a clear direction and have had a lot of time to think about the answers of whole stole the memories and what-for instead of doing stuff like deciding 5 minutes in advance that Bashir is genetically enhanced.

DarkMatter,3avck5,TheLantean,6,Tue Jun 23 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"It's pretty normal for new shows to drop a bit after the premiere, the part of the audience that wasn't interested stops watching, after about 3 episodes the numbers should stabilize and incur just minimal loses until the finale, when people return to see how the season ends.   The question is just how much leeway exactly there is for Dark Matter.   Considering how low the other shows are, and the ratings drop across the board for all channels, it has a real fighting chance. Syfy is also in the middle of its image change - the supposed return to real science fiction - so it might be disinclined purely for PR reasons to cancel a spaceship show after one season. Another piece of the puzzle is international viewership, it will be interesting to see how it's doing across the world.   Edit: at least in Canada it seems to be a success, judging from this press release.    Also on Friday night, new Canadian sci-fi drama DARK MATTER continues to be a hit with Space viewers in its 10 p.m. ET timeslot drawing an audience of 262,000 viewers for its second episode, making Space the #1 entertainment specialty network in the timeslot for total viewers and among adults 25-54. During the back-to-back airing of KILLJOYS and DARK MATTER, Space was the #1 entertainment specialty network overall in the 9p.m.-11p.m. ET timeslot."
DarkMatter,3avck5,Grauzevn8,6,Tue Jun 23 21:58:24 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with these cancellation watch antics is how they are still focused on the old school watch. I don't think this one is even giving credence to the 7 day out system. Most folks I know binge watch episodes with Hulu, Netflix, dvr, etc systems especially for shows over the weekend. I wonder when the rubrics will start looking at the true number of viewership."
DarkMatter,3avck5,dat_unixbeard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:43:04 2015 UTC,"it will be interesting to see how it's doing across the world.   Purely anecdotal and probably useless of course, but it's pretty funny how you can ask random Dutch people on IRC if they watch Dark Matter and 50% does so.  Of course, I hang out in all the wrong channels where the sort of decrepit person who watches sci-fi hangs out."

The comics are a peculiar case, Dark Matter was always intended to be a TV series and when that didn't pan out Mallozzi released a graphic novel version in 2012, partly to create an audience, and partly to create a more appealing pitch for TV executives.   It took until last year when another show (Lost Girl) was winding down, and the owner of that production company (Jay Firestone - Prodigy Pictures) saw Mallozzi's work and got him the money to produce the series."

DarkMatter,3an001,dat_unixbeard,2,Sun Jun 21 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"The source material is not a graphics novel, that's a misconception according to the author, they always wanted to make this show but they just adapted the pilot script to the graphic novel before the show was greenlit to have something to do.  I'm sure the creators have looots of ideas beyond that.  And no one knows where it's going, because we're finally not dealing with ""mystery of the week show"" but ""mystery of the show show here clearly. Which can horribly backfire if it gets cancelled, then we will never know the mystery unless the creators either tell us or make a graphic novel about it.  So either they already know, they know who erased the memories and they know the entire shtick they are going to reveal, or they don't and they're just gonna make it up as they go along, who knows.

DarkMatter,3alicn,TheInkerman,2,Sun Jun 21 13:04:42 2015 UTC,"I actually think they've got a good middle ground with the android. Rommie was basically just another character, and I don't know much about Data, but he seemed to be almost comic relief.   I like that the Android literally seems to be a computer interface with only pre-programmed 'human-like' interactions, and not some 'robot-but-with-feelings'. Stone cold is how I like my androids. I'm waiting for all hell to break loose and her not to give a shit while everything is exploding."
DarkMatter,3alicn,TheLantean,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:32:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about Data, but he seemed to be almost comic relief.   Data does get his serious episodes in due time.

DarkMatter,3alicn,DrStalker,4,Mon Jun 22 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't that the characters are standard archetypes, it's that right now the characters are 100% generic predictable copies of those archetypes with no depth or interest due to the amnesia backstory.    Now that the base framework for the show is established this might get fixed up starting next episode, but it's going to depend on how good the writing is."

DarkMatter,3alicn,jai_kasavin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:21:27 2015 UTC,Can I ask for a recommendation. I'd like to know what's your favourite show that has the least number of tropes/cliches?
DarkMatter,3alicn,KingSmizzy,2,Mon Jun 22 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Well, there are two:   DS9, yes it has many tropes but it started a lot of them so it gets a pass I guess. I think DS9 was the first ""bald black leader guy"" in an era where a black man in charge in a non blaxploitation setting alone was very unusual. I can't find an example that dates back earlier. DS9 also has the typical ""multi-dimensional villains"" but I believe it also started that idea more or less together with Babylon 5 which ran at the same time. Earth: Final Conflict. This one is legitimately low on the tropes I guess though you're obviously still going to have them as far as characters go at least. I haven't yet seen another show that had a ""black guy, master hacker that looks like, and is, a rich modern art collector"", I have yet to see the master hacker/tech wiz and art collector trope unified, especially in a black person. But who knows, maybe I missed something and it's somewhere.   All the other shows I enjoy are full of tropes of course, and like I said, DS9 is also full of them, but for many at least it was the first."
DarkMatter,3alicn,mvs5191,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:24:36 2015 UTC,Thanks. I stopped watching DS9 before the Dominion wars stuff started and never corrected it. I will revisit it.
DarkMatter,3alicn,Guglio08,4,Mon Jun 22 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"Well, that was when Sisko wasn't bald yet.  They say TNG got good when Riker grew a beard, and DS9 got good when Sisko shaved his head.  I mean this does not look nearly as awesome as this, you can sort of see why the bald black leader guy is a thing. There's just something about that bald shining head dark brown head and that goatee that radiates authority."
DarkMatter,3alicn,KingSmizzy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"My issue with the character stereotypes is that theyre just a reflection of how people imagine society is or wants them to be.  Big friendly black guy who gives good advice and is dependable... sounds like every black character since they started trying to stop racism.   Strong female lead who likes to be in control, but dont get on her bad side, she also kicks ass! Sounds like every feminists dream, or at least, a writer trying to not displease a feminist audience.  Thick-headed obviously american gun-enthusiast... do i need to say anything else?  Young and clever know-it-all who likes to express herself with weird outfits and colorful hair. Sounds like every aging adults view on the new generation.  Asian guy who knows kung-fu and plays with swords a lot... his room was a dojo. Do writers realise that asian people have other hobbies?"
DarkMatter,3agvpq,dat_unixbeard,32,Sat Jun 20 01:45:02 2015 UTC,"Three has massively grown on me over the course of one episode.  He used to just be a total asshole, but now he's a funny total asshole and there's something in him that makes it seem that he's not a total asshole, he just acts like one but it seems he has some care in him, he just doesn't show it and uses his humour to draw attention away from it. I kind of like him.  That scene where he was seriously asking Six who'd he think had the baddest rep was so funny.  Edit: Also, it seems to be that they don't make Universe' mistake this time of basically leaving all humour out. You can still have a dark, mature show with gritty characters while keeping comic relief in. Hell, you can even use dark humour like Three has, some of his jokes are pretty macabre."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,Eponymous1990,16,Sat Jun 20 08:36:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he went from a total asshole to a more Tony Stark kind of sarcastic asshole where he actually cares about what happens but hides it."

DarkMatter,3agvpq,dat_unixbeard,3,Sat Jun 20 20:38:11 2015 UTC,"She kissed him out of no-where, he was too polite to refuse. Haven't you heard? When a girl kisses a guy out of no-where she is not a perv apparently? Just like when your female de-facto commander suddenly strokes your male cheek amongst all the obvious sexual tension. Seriously, swap genders in either case and what used to be the female is now a pervy, creepy man."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,ruffykunn,2,Tue Jun 23 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, she did kiss him. Whether he appreciated that or not is a matter of interpretation.  Yeah, fuck those sexist double standards! I personally think that we are all adults responsible for standing up for ourselves.  Making a move on somebody is not pervy/creepy, whether it's a man or woman doing it. It's pretty straightforward to shut someone down if you don't want them to to hit on you.  If we outlaw physical contact initiation and haptic communication, how the fuck are people supposed to come on to each other? You can say yes and no non-verbally and the current zeitgeist insistence on having to do all communication through words only is preposterous."

DarkMatter,3agvpq,fatum_unus,8,Mon Jun 22 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"I really hope they are actually siblings. I would find that dynamic far more interesting, with her then going on to have relationship/s with others on the ship."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,dat_unixbeard,6,Sat Jun 20 13:04:18 2015 UTC,"Don't share a last name though.  Also, Star Wars did it before. First suggest sexual tension, then reveal blood relationship."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,fatum_unus,2,Sat Jun 20 14:12:55 2015 UTC,"True, but off the top of my head i cant think of another example. Plus they really didnt go into it all that much, it was sort of revealed and then it was like of shes with Han now. No siblings catching up sharing history, no Luke disapproving of Han even though hes a bottom feeding smuggler and shes a princess. No shared pain of their mother being dead, their father being a mass murdering child killing tyrant, a planet being destroyed because of her, and no ethical problem him killing all those millions/billions aboard the death star."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,dat_unixbeard,6,Sun Jun 21 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"Well, of course not, Star Wars loves its extremely flat and unbelievable characters.  That moment where Anakin finally fell to the dark side. He slices off  Windu's arm in passion, okay, I can sort of believe that. But then he's like ""What have I done..."" in a moment of disbelief about it, that I can get too. And the the next second he's like ""I'll serve you, my lord, I have completely fallen to the dark side, give me a cool name starting with Darth and I'll kill some kids in your name."", that was just ridiculous."

DarkMatter,3agvpq,DoctorDiscourse,22,Sat Jun 20 11:48:37 2015 UTC,"It seems like they're really pushing the idea of the ship as something still to be discovered. There's a lot of different threads going on, and I think this premise has some legs.   They've seeded the overarching idea of finding out about their past selves. They've seeded two different 'boxes'. (A big one that Three is attacking, and a small one that Four just found opened thanks to Five.) They're still seeding ideas about the characters' hidden strengths and weaknesses. (Tonight we discovered Four is pretty good at interrogation and Six is the one with medical training.) They've also seeded mysteries surrounding Five, what she knows, and how it loops back to the overarching plot of the show, all while neatly wrapping up the Pilot's 'story of the week'. A good pilot is able to set up a lot of different things while neatly resolving its 'regular' plots in a timely manner.   Considering this is made by some of the same people that made Stargate, that's not entirely surprising. Solid show imo, and will be a pretty good replacement for Continuum once that show gets canceled. Show seems a bit like if Stargate and Firefly had a baby."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,complex_reduction,12,Sat Jun 20 05:54:38 2015 UTC,"Continuum has already been cancelled. The final season is airing soon, but it's only a 6 episode mini-season to wrap everything up. Slight sarcasm with ""wrap everything up"", the creator of Continuum has stated that he planned a storyline that would run for 7 seasons and he only got 3 (plus this final micro-season). So, 3.5 seasons.   It seems like they're really pushing the idea of the ship as something still to be discovered   I really like this angle. I liked it in Stargate Atlantis too, the notion that the place they lived was large and undiscovered, who knows what (/who?) is hiding in there. We established in this episode that there are air vents that lead to the bedrooms, who knows what perverted monster is watching everybody while they're sleeping (alright it's probably just Three).   Considering this is made by some of the same people that made Stargate   I am really enjoying the Stargate-ish angle of the crew traveling to different worlds, meeting all sorts of people, assuming this is something they're going to be doing regularly and it wasn't a once off for the pilot. I've always been fascinated by the idea of meeting alien cultures, and since the crew has no memories they're discovering everything for the first time too."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,Yage2006,8,Sat Jun 20 08:47:07 2015 UTC,"I miss shows like that as well, That sense of adventure and escapism, Instead what we get are SciFi shows that take place on earth or even worse light dramas with one or 2 SciFi elements but are mostly just drama's, No sense of adventure or escapism.   Adventure is expensive though which is why you don't get many adventure shows on TV, Just a small handful."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,complex_reduction,7,Sat Jun 20 20:23:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. As much as I love shows like Continuum or Defiance, they're mostly set in one spot and the show mostly revolves around character drama.   Shows like Stargate (SG1, Atlantis) and hopefully Dark Matter revolve around traveling to new places and meeting new people, there is character drama but the show mostly revolves around exploration and discovery, most of the drama develops from the situations they're in not interpersonal drama between characters. Incidentally this also makes the interpersonal drama so much more meaningful because writers don't have to come up with a ""love triangle of the week"" for every episode."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,disneywizard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:26:32 2015 UTC,"This show reminds me a bit of Star Trek: Voyager.  All the series before it were ""explore the galaxy, report to Star Base, and don't break the Prime Directive"". There were some personal drama, but it was forgotten by the next episode or didn't carry really any major changes. But Voyager instead had a prime theme: ""Return back home"" and on the way you explored the native planets and phenomenon because that's what we do as a species - we explore.  It how much of the world's maps were drawn when sailing was the primary mode of transporation between contenents - curious ship captains stopping on their journey to explore.  And because of this exploration and this prime theme, there was more character growth and development in that Star Trek series than I have ever seen on any other ST space exploration series (not counting ST:DSN as that was based on a space station, so all they could really do was character development lol). We had brief love triangles, actual multiple episode discussions on religion, the afterlife, deities, betrayal, the massive grey area that actually comes on meeting new races and how our actions actually have consequences greater than just one episode.  Like, the crew angered a race in the very first episode by stopping them from obtaining a powerful device that had brought the Voyager into that part of the galaxy and they were hunted down by that race until the series finale.  And that's what I'm hoping for this show too - that while we have drama, we also still have that exploration and adventure of meeting  new species and planets and discovery and everything that's kinda lacking in many sci-fi shows nowadays."

DarkMatter,3agvpq,Yage2006,7,Sat Jun 20 13:56:21 2015 UTC,"Don't think it's hurting for budget, but time, they need to decide what to cut if they want to put it in 45 minutes.  I'm pretty sure the first and second episode were produced as a whole and then cut in two. I can't imagine the channel first let them produce the first part of the pilot and then greenlit and said ""Okay, now produce the second part with less of a budget."", that's just hardly how this stuff works. I'm fairly certain for instance that all the scenes which happen at one place, like all the bridge scenes or all the scenes in that plant regardless of chronology or in which episode they happened were just shot in succession to save time and money."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,HippieWizard,5,Sat Jun 20 16:44:34 2015 UTC,"Actually a show has a certain amount of money per season in order to give the writers some flexibility - this way they get to spend more on action-filled episodes then balance it out with an inexpensive character piece or bottle episodes which get to reuse sets and are carried by smaller number of actors.   The ""big"" episodes are the pilot (to attract the biggest audience), the ones bordering a mid season break (to provide a hook and then payoff compensating for the hiatus) and the finale (to get people to come back next season). Virtually all productions that are not mini series follow this pattern, including Mallozzi's older work - Stargate SG1/Atlantis/Universe.   And it's not a question of too many things happening to fit in a 42 minute episode either: Comic book spoilers  Now, consider this from a budget perspective what was cut:     Comic book spoilers Comic book spoilers Comic book spoilers Comic book spoilers   And what the above was replaced with:    Comic book spoilers Comic book spoilers Comic book spoilers Comic book spoilers   If this is how the show has to cut corners for the two-parter pilot, when it's supposed to be at its best, it's pretty obvious that it doesn't have a lot to work with.   Of course, there's nothing inherently wrong with lower budgets, the worst thing about this was how they went about some of these replacements, most of them resulted in loss of very important character development (Comic book spoilers and world building, only some were done right (like Comic book spoilers). When you can't do great CGI or build many sets you have to make the scripts carry the show, Star Trek: TOS-style, but sadly that's not what's happening here."

I sort of knew that in the back of my mind I guess but was assuming they'd spend the same deal of the second part of the pilot because I was sort of treating it like a ""two parter"", forgetting of course that the first one is going to have to draw in more viewers than the second one because it didn't start with a ""feature length"" pilot that was later broken up in two parts like they commonly do.  Still though, the scene on board the Raza with the Ferrous Corp commander, that was a totally new set wasn't it? I didn't see that set in other places, but I guess they're going to re-use that set later on as well."

DarkMatter,3agvpq,Yage2006,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:33:48 2015 UTC,"Sort of, Dark Matter was intended to be a TV series but when it was first pitched to the TV networks back in 2011 it didn't get picked up. Stargate Universe and Caprica had just been canceled and Syfy was abandoning real scifi, focusing on reality shows, scifi-lite, wrestling, and cheap Asylum movies.  So in 2012 Joseph Mallozzi (the show creator) released a graphic novel version of the scripts for the first two episodes, partly to create an audience, and partly to create a more appealing pitch for TV executives.  It took until last year when another show (Lost Girl) was winding down, and the owner of that production company (Jay Firestone/Prodigy Pictures) saw Mallozzi's work and got him the money to produce the series. This coincided with Syfy's return to scifi after their ratings were dropping across the board, and they agreed to buy the series."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,tom07140,4,Sat Jul 11 12:56:21 2015 UTC,"I liked this more than the pilot because of all the character interactions and exciting action.  Most notably, I now actually like Three. Too bad they saved all of his funny lines up for part two of the pilot, I kinda feel sorry for hating so much on him :D.  I am a fan of all three Stargate shows and now relieved to see this show written by SG alumni take off. I am crossing my fingers that this series gets to grow the beard and continue beyond season one.  The way they set it up, I am really curious what the crew will decide to be their next actions after resupplying at the space station. Keep helping underdog colonists? Trade goods between dangerous planets? Keep needling the corporations? Or will one of the two mysterious boxes or one of Five's psychic flashes start off a myth arc?  Lastly, I don't get the cynicism towards this show. We have watched very little of season one. Any prediction of it failing just from two episodes are pretty premature."

DarkMatter,3agvpq,Lazarus-,5,Sat Jun 20 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"Gonna have to wait a while for this type of stuff. There is simply no way to monetize the internet as well as T.V. currently. People bitch and bitch and bitch about ads on Hulu, and would be unwilling to pay a subscription fee for every station.   I'm hoping for a kind of Itunes for T.V. where you can buy shows by the episode or a whole season at once. Maybe preview the Pilot episode for 99 cents and then buy the season at like $2 and episode or something. People will still complain, TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!...but we'll never get shows for free so....."
DarkMatter,3agvpq,Werewomble,2,Sat Jun 20 07:20:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah the networks would have to devise a strategy to fully integrate all of their advertising into the show instead of using commercials. Commercials are a really archaic nuisance that need to just hurry up and die already.   I'd like one subscription service that has every show from every network available for unlimited streaming. Like a Spotify but exclusively for television. It'd have a somewhat hefty monthly fee, maybe like $50+ a month. I'd watch unlimited shows without any commercials or ads, and then the subscription service would pay the networks based on the number of views their shows are getting, just like how Spotify pays the record labels a tiny bit each time a song is played. And the shows could also integrate product placement in their shows for further ad revenue, as long as it's not obvious and obnoxious lol."

DarkMatter,3a4pi1,Warbird87,5,Wed Jun 17 06:04:07 2015 UTC,I remember reading somewhere David Hewlett does have a part in the show.
DarkMatter,3a4pi1,masteroffm,6,Wed Jun 17 05:29:40 2015 UTC,Yes.
DarkMatter,3a4pi1,Malhallah,2,Wed Jun 17 07:43:18 2015 UTC,"I hope they don't actually, seeing a face you recognize just breaks you out of the willing suspension of disbelief and forces you to consciously realize again you're watching fiction played by actors."
DarkMatter,3a4pi1,dat_unixbeard,4,Thu Jun 18 19:43:13 2015 UTC,6/Griffin has been a sci-fi staple since the 90s. Sci-fi is one of those genres that reuses actors over and over.  Although I certainly understand your sentiment I actually think it makes things more fun. I say bring on the good Dr. McKay.  He's great!
DarkMatter,3a18ym,TheLantean,5,Tue Jun 16 13:03:40 2015 UTC,Hope it improves. This is the first sci-fi series I've looked at in a while and gone Dam...
DarkMatter,3a18ym,TheInkerman,2,Tue Jun 16 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"I just hope Syfy improves their servers, nothing but choppy video while HBO was outstanding."
DarkMatter,3a18ym,BAMFSoB,2,Wed Jun 17 03:20:29 2015 UTC,"Hope this is not gonna be yet another sci-fi series that lasts 12-24 episodes building up to something interesting and then boom ending into nothing. It looks very cool thusfar. That android is hilariously oblivious, and I say this hating Lt. Cmdr. Data with my guts."
DarkMatter,3a18ym,dat_unixbeard,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:42:00 2015 UTC,Stargate Universe RIP
DarkMatter,3a18ym,hartowag,4,Sat Jun 20 23:14:27 2015 UTC,I only watched because Aaron Ashmore told me to. But I don't regret it. It'll be interesting to see how Killjoys does and how they'll affect each other's numbers.
DarkMatter,3a18ym,rivensky,3,Tue Jun 16 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"The numbers aren't really that great, but they're not bad either for Syfy, and DM will also benefit from international distribution deals - the show airs the following Sunday on Syfy Poland, Monday on Syfy UK (20:00), Syfy Portugal (22:10) and Syfy Germany (21:00), and the night after on SyFy France (21:30), Syfy Netherlands (21:00) and Syfy Spain (22:20) and a week later on Wednesday in Brazil (21:00) and Latin America (20:00).   So if it's successful outside the US it will help a lot.   We'll also get the DVR numbers (live+3) soon that will bring at least a 50% bump, but advertisers (which are the majority of the revenue stream) don't really care about those.   If it at least stays at this level I'm confident it will get a second season. The ratings for the following two episodes are crucial considering what Mallozzi said on his blog:    ascreedintime writes: “When will you know if there will be a season two?”  Answer: If we start hot out of the gate, I’m hoping we’ll know by episode 3.  If not, I’d guess September at the latest.   Edit: /u/johnnyjay has just published his take on the ratings: http://www.cancelledscifi.com/2015/06/16/sci-fi-cancellation-watch-dark-matter-and-defiance-start-low-is-it-panic-time-for-syfy-aes-the-returned-gets-cancelled/"
DarkMatter,3a18ym,johnnyjay,3,Tue Jun 16 13:56:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link to my article.  I was a bit hard on Dark Matter's ratings in the piece, but additional reading suggests that its international syndication may mean it will not rely as heavily on its Syfy ratings in the U.S. (much like Continuum and Lost Girl).  But the low numbers there do seem to indicate that the sci fi audience is not buying into the product Syfy is currently putting out even though it is moving back to more science fiction oriented scripted programming."
DarkMatter,3a18ym,Werewomble,2,Tue Jun 16 20:56:05 2015 UTC,They have some trust to rebuild. It will take time.

DarkMatter,39nrq9,Werewomble,36,Sun Jun 14 02:57:26 2015 UTC,Solid premiere. I like the end reveal that they're hardened criminals. Still no background on Five. I'll definitely be back next week.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,VT-Sensational,11,Sat Jun 13 03:06:54 2015 UTC,My guess is Five was behind the door. She is one of the secrets - she is picking up someone else's dreams. When we find out who has a little brother we've probably found the owner of that dream.

DarkMatter,39nrq9,flambyisyou,8,Sat Jun 13 11:13:26 2015 UTC,"Seemed to be pulling from a number of different inspirations.   Firefly: Small crew of freelancers/mercenaries, chased by the authorities, doing good or morally ambiguous jobs to get by. Five seems to be kind of crazy like River Tam and Three reminds me of Jane. It's a shame the quirky sense of humour is missing.  Andromeda: Also had a small crew of out-of-place people on a large ship. The Android seems to be very close to Rommie, especially with the dry sense of humour. I wouldn't be surprised if the ship turns out to have it's own AI personality.   Stargate Universe: It shouldn't be a surprise that the ship interior felt a lot like destiny, but not million of years old. The shuttle design reminded me of Universe/Atlantis.  Alien(s): The general universe feels a lot like Alien(s) with independent mining settlements, ""multi-corporations"", sleep-pods. The ship itself also felt a lot like something out of Alien(s).   Battle Star Galactica: FTL Jumps take time to calculate and make for a good escape. No beam weapons, battles falling back to nuclear missiles and maneuvering.  It's not really present in the first episode, but given the writers, I wouldn't be surprised to see Stargate style humour appear. Actually you wouldn't notice it even if it was there. The Stargate style of humour isn't really obvious until you get to know the characters."

Well we got SGU.  Characters each serve as a plethora of knowledge only in certain subjects.  While still being useful.  Yea, still going with stargate.  Emotionless character like Teal'c, maybe even a Rush type character that's keeping secrets from the crew.  I really hope that robot gets better cause she annoyed me.  Ridiculous weapons, sure the aliens in Stargate had those.  But I swear to all that's good and holy if they start doing the let's shoot them multiple times and they'll disappear like with Zat'nik'tel I am going to slap someone.

Robert Carlysle was amazing chewing the furniture but the rest of the cast had trouble carrying it. I'll have to go back and watch Season 2, apparently it got better.

A bit predictable and the atmosphere is not there yet (would have liked to see more detailed effects done with them as they woke up from stasis, seemed cheap) some aspects of the ship and the rooms in general are to clean for my taste, after all its been a while since last they've been awake. Then with them meeting the people on the planet that was pretty cut and dry not much meat there visually. An to be blunt the characters are a little to cliche though, I'm hoping that they grow out of their archetypes. Never the less I like 3, 2 and 6.   4 is to much of a stereotype so i hope the show runners see that.   Overall there's promise here and like all new shows with promise they need time to grow. I'll give it 5 episodes and the pilot gets a B- from me, plus one for production valves over all with the vfx - loved the wrap.  PS The actress for 5 needs a to work on her skills a little more,  when she was describing the dream of her's it was a little campy and seemed like a odd place to start talking about that knowledge.

DarkMatter,39nrq9,Spazit,3,Sat Jun 13 11:15:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe shes half reptile? That would be a great twist. Make her humanish but just a bit off. I never liked the fact that River was so godly, like she could do practically everything which to me made her boring."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,TheCavis,3,Sat Jun 13 11:39:25 2015 UTC,Agreed.  At least 2 and the android got the martial arts genes here.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,cohencide,8,Sat Jun 13 13:04:07 2015 UTC,I have to say that it was a solid pilot. It reminded me of the old Syfy and kind of reminded me a bit of Firefly. I can't wait to see where this shows goes in the future and i will be watching it.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,GruxKing,2,Sat Jun 13 11:20:57 2015 UTC,"Very much hoping it'll be free wheeling like Firefly. BSG gang on the run in space would do well, too."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,ruffykunn,8,Sat Jun 13 11:47:41 2015 UTC,"Six totally still has his memory.   If they follow standard cliches then they will discover they are all good people and just got a bad report card from EvilCorpstm, hopefully I am wrong."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Werewomble,7,Sat Jun 13 12:51:01 2015 UTC,"Really? I figured it was Three.   In an emergency where life support was failing, you'd wake up the commander and either the medic or engineer. I'm guessing one's the medic (five's the engineer) and two's the commander. Anyone else waking up at that point would either be useless or counter productive (assuming the pods have their own life support system or slow down vitals, pulling useless people out to breathe the diminishing atmosphere doesn't make sense).  Three... well, we never actually see him wake up. He just appears, guns drawn, asking ""Who are you?"" to One and Two (possibly testing them to see if they remember who they are). He finds the magic door of mystery by himself, tries entering a code that's rejected, fails at blasting it open and then keeps it a secret for no discernible reason."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,ruffykunn,3,Sun Jun 14 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"I basically agree with you. I don't know if 1 is the commander. I think the idea was he had to wake up 2 so he woke up 1 so that when he walked in it was like, ""I guess we're all waking up now?"" Just woke up 1 to mask what was really going on. As a red herring."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,stlnycla,16,Mon Jun 15 20:23:05 2015 UTC,Machismo dude could not put me off any more.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Yage2006,6,Sat Jun 13 02:54:34 2015 UTC,God I hope they flesh him out into more than a walking annoying stereotype.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,ruffykunn,4,Sat Jun 13 18:49:22 2015 UTC,Or airlock him next time he's a douche. That would be better.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Werewomble,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:23:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we can only dream ...  Someone should write a fanfic where they airlock him in the pilot :P. Or at least punch/sedate him :D"
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Red_Tannins,2,Mon Jun 15 05:20:48 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I wish we could just FF to the point where the walking annoying stereotype becomes a well developed character -- if it happens, that is.Waiting for it to happen can be trying."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,GruxKing,2,Mon Jun 15 08:31:13 2015 UTC,Or just use him as the first crew death.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Werewomble,2,Sat Jun 20 04:34:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, there's a trope for that! >:D That way they throw a bone to his fans (all two of them) while getting rid of the scrappy (who might actually gain more fans by his heroic sacrifice, though)."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,fatum_unus,5,Sat Jun 20 04:53:21 2015 UTC,It works well paired with self-conscious wounded puppy to balance it out a la Malcolm Reynolds. Why they think we watch sci fi for large hairy men beating their chests I will never know - speaking as a large hairy man.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Werewomble,3,Sat Jun 13 11:19:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't expect of a group of deadly mercenaries to be all about flowers and kisses.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,ruffykunn,14,Mon Jun 15 07:29:31 2015 UTC,So much lame machismo from the male cast.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,TropicalTortilla,7,Sat Jun 13 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Makes sense they are aggressive people from the reveal at the end but it will wear thin quickly. Large hairy men over acting killed Helix, Dark Matter doesn't need that."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,UltraFlyingTurtle,7,Sat Jun 13 11:16:56 2015 UTC,"I loved all the acting in Helix, i think it was the convoluted, time jumping plot that killed it. I want more Machismo, i want them to all go and slaughter that entire planet. How much more interesting would it be if they did that, instead of trying to help them and reforming because they cant really remember being a pack of deadly mercenaries."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,MalachiDraven,3,Sat Jun 13 11:35:09 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with the works of Uwe Boll? You Sir, have found a gold mine of your very own!"
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Werewomble,0,Sat Jun 13 11:40:55 2015 UTC,Would be great to have some kick-ass male main characters with less of those clichés.  EDIT: Apparently wanting male characters in a futuristic setting to break out of antiquated gender roles gets you downvoted here *facepalm*.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,CRISPR,6,Sat Jun 13 18:46:47 2015 UTC,I was really surprised how much I liked this show.   I was pretty bored and just thought it'd kill some time but I really like it.  This first episode hit all the right buttons for me. It's got echoes of Farscape and Stargate (one of the writers/creators I think?) and has just the right amount of camp. It's very reminiscent of the golden age of sci fi from the 90s.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,phaser_on_overload,2,Sun Jun 14 10:17:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was one of the better SyFy pilots I've seen lately. Despite the low production values and overused sci-fi tropes, it was  more entertaining than I had expected (but probably that is due to the low bar I've had for new SyFy shows lately). I had read the comics beforehand, and it was pretty close to it."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,dat_unixbeard,12,Tue Jun 16 01:03:54 2015 UTC,"I just finished watching this episode. I really really enjoyed it. First off, that chick with the green/blue hair is gorgeous. Also the show feels like it could be a great new version of Firefly."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Lazarus-,11,Sat Jun 13 05:27:11 2015 UTC,"Please be Firefly. Please don't be Helix.    She jumped out as the most likeable character. I hope the others get some development, too, before it becomes Douchebag Island."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,TropicalTortilla,3,Sat Jun 13 11:21:01 2015 UTC,"First season of Helix was not that bad. I have a radically different opinion of Firefly, but it could be an allergic reaction to an insane level of fanboyism around this show."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,TropicalTortilla,5,Sat Jun 13 14:44:31 2015 UTC,Since this is the pervy part of the thread I'm just gonna go ahead and say One has an amazing ass.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,kerelberel,3,Mon Jun 15 17:37:37 2015 UTC,pervy   Ah yes:   Man calls woman pretty -> perv Man calls man pretty -> secure in his sexuality Woman calls woman pretty -> jealous and trying to hide it Woman calls man pretty -> whatever
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Goosepuse,2,Thu Jun 18 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"I think Melissa O'Neil (#2) is a bit better looking, but #5 is pretty hot as well.  I also got that Firefly vibe from the show and can't wait to watch it again next week and hopefully we get a little more information on #1 and #6"
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Bizcotti,2,Sat Jun 13 11:26:54 2015 UTC,Would ravage #2. Would marry #5.

DarkMatter,39nrq9,ruffykunn,5,Sat Jun 13 20:20:44 2015 UTC,COOL ASS NAMES!
DarkMatter,39nrq9,jb211,3,Tue Jun 16 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"Funny how they managed to make their last names so much more memorable then their firsts. Except for Ryu of course :) Corso, Lin, Boone, Jones and Ryu."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,UltraFlyingTurtle,3,Tue Jun 16 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"One thing to remember is that it was adapted from a comic book. Episode one covered half of the series. They kept it extremely similar to the comic book series, which if you read comics you know the writing is not very detailed and dialogue is pretty short and basic.  The next episode should cover the rest of the series. So, by episode 3 we will be getting a script written for TV. So, however long you try out shows for.. make sure to start that countdown at episode 3."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,jb211,3,Sat Jun 13 22:02:01 2015 UTC,"Good point. I read the ""Dark Matter"" mini-series and always wondered if there were more issues. I guess episode 3 is where it'll continue from the comics.  I was surprised at how much material they covered in the first episode, but glad they did, and not draw things out."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Yage2006,2,Tue Jun 16 01:05:10 2015 UTC,"The showrunners actually wrote the comic because they couldn't directly get it greenlit as a series. It seems that with the 4 issues puiblished, they did eventually get Syfy to make it a TV show."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,dat_unixbeard,5,Wed Jun 17 13:24:47 2015 UTC,"I was bothered by the reveal at the end. If these people are all bad, hired to do bad things, why would some of them lobby to help the miners?  Does the loss of your memory also affect your moral compass?"
DarkMatter,39nrq9,slycopperr,7,Mon Jun 15 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"Good point. I'm guessing because we still don't know why they committed those crimes, they may not have been bad people -- at least not all of them. Maybe one was an anarchist, a eco-terrorist fighting for good causes, another committed crimes to help feed his family,  maybe some were on a losing side of a war, a political prisoner, etc. Dunno."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,dat_unixbeard,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:01:21 2015 UTC,"True, but the fact that they are on that ship full of weapons supposedly headed to the planet to exterminate the miners is what I am basing my judgement on them being bad people. It was just a gut feeling at the end of the episode that didn't resonate with me. I am sure the writers will flesh out the backstories and we will know for sure who these people really are."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,GruxKing,2,Thu Jun 18 22:44:13 2015 UTC,It could be they are simply wanted for those crimes but not bad people like the crew of the firefly for example.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Interstate_Clover,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:23:23 2015 UTC,"How do you know they are bad? All we know is that the ship's database says they are wanted for these things. I mean, obviously there's going to be some reveal that puts this into context. That, or they're going to live with the idea that wiping someone's memories in whatever way makes you a different person and they're going to live with the knowledge of ""I used to be horrible serial killer, but I don't remember, I caused so much bad shit, was that really I that did it?"""
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Werewomble,2,Thu Jun 18 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"I'm totally late for the ""party"", but my first thought when I watched the episode (which was just now) was that, if they belong to the ""resistance forces"" (it seemed like it was what that Wrothgar fellow, along with the mining colony were) it would be totally obvious the big corporations that ""rule the universe"" or whatever have them on wanted lists, whereas if they worked for said corporations, they'd be ""enforcing"" the laws and not be wanted.  Maybe that's just me misunderstanding a couple of stuff?"
DarkMatter,39nrq9,GruxKing,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"It could all be, that's the fun about mystery shows, it's a mystery show, obviously something big is going to be revealed at some point so that's what we're waiting for."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,GruxKing,8,Fri Jun 19 15:54:51 2015 UTC,This vibe seems like it would fit in well with the Alien/Prometheus universe
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Hemingway81,3,Sat Jun 13 02:02:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, got the same feeling. The outside of the ship kinda reminded me of aliens marine gear.  Inside hallway with the lights flashing and female computerized voice made me feel like they hired people from the alien films.  I am sure that is on purpose.  Waking up out of cryo and heading straight for the control panel (with faded memory) gave me Pandorum flashbacks. No gripes here, I like all of those bits.  I'm game for a low budget well done space series....count me in."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,GruxKing,4,Sun Jun 14 03:20:59 2015 UTC,Spoilers!  So Ridley Scott is behind the big doors?

DarkMatter,39nrq9,CRISPR,5,Sat Jun 13 03:34:05 2015 UTC,"There's nothing like a redemption arc to get some character development going.   Maybe they'll pull a Rodney. Remember how annoying he was at first, especially on SG1?"
DarkMatter,39nrq9,chilehead,3,Sat Jun 13 10:46:40 2015 UTC,Rodney may have been annoying but he wasnt boring. I hope it less of a redemption arc and more of a self discovery arc. I mean if you had no memory and found one of the things you really loved you would build yourself around it and be 1 dimensional in a literal way. Maybe he finds a kitchen and learns that not only does he like large guns but cooking as well?

DarkMatter,39nrq9,Bizcotti,3,Sat Jun 13 05:39:02 2015 UTC,I hope one and two are brother and sister. Or Half siblings with ones mother being the evil royal bitch. It would make for an interesting dynamic. I also hope fives actually a human-reptile hybrid.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,jrm2007,5,Sat Jun 13 12:03:23 2015 UTC,"Good theory, it would also explain why One has no apparent skills but is part of a supposedly terrifying crew, his sister saved him and brought him with her.   But I think Five is the sister, the ""not my dream"" is a red herring; whatever method was used to separate abilities and technical knowledge from biographic memories didn't erase the dream because Five has some sort of disassociative disorder, making her think the dream (actually a memory) is not hers, and thus get lumped with cultural (stories)/language/tech skills."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Spazit,3,Sat Jun 13 14:55:43 2015 UTC,
DarkMatter,39nrq9,oncenightvaler,2,Sat Jun 13 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"Make sense, when the show specifically drew attention to the fact that they were sending out a distress signal, implying that was the cause for the attack, it could have been a smoke screen. Either aimed at the crew, or the audience.  Several characters seem prime suspects as plants and they'd want to cover their tracks.  Though it is reasonable that any ship would fire on them immediately once they found out it was the the friggin' Raza, the stuff of nightmares. Especially in the middle of nowhere.   ` PS: You don't have to put info from the current episode in spoiler tags since the thread is already tagged with [Spoilers]  for S01E01 in the title, nor speculation. Just canon future plot points."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Eavynne,3,Sat Jun 13 23:56:15 2015 UTC,"I thought it was fun. I was expecting it to be a bit more serious, but it doesn't seem to give off that feeling - and I'm glad it doesn't.  As for cliches, whether there are or not doesn't matter much to me. I just hope it gets decent ratings so SyFy will continue to produce original Sci-Fi, otherwise if their shows keep failing (like Helix did second season), it certainly won't be good."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,jedilion,4,Sun Jun 14 00:41:43 2015 UTC,"Prediction:  The kidnapping charges 1 & 3 have are for kidnapping 5.   (5 was a willing member of the crew, though.  It feels like the ol save a girl from a life she didnt want and get branded an outlaw trope.)"
DarkMatter,39nrq9,bangkok1011,3,Sun Jun 14 03:36:57 2015 UTC,"Looking pretty good. Though wasn't a fan of the cliche criminal piracy thing. Called it a few minutes in and just sat there waiting to be proven right.  This looks like a mix of firefly, and universe."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,TotesMessenger,3,Sat Jun 13 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"Its not the greatest Sci Fi show ever BUT I really enjoyed it. I found the acting, story and characters all worth seeing more of. Its low budget but they hooked me."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Logiteck77,8,Tue Jun 16 02:23:11 2015 UTC,It turns out the cliche's are actually made out of Dark Matter...  TL;DR: Lots of cliche's in this show. For example: Everything.
DarkMatter,39nrq9,Dave-C,3,Sat Jun 13 10:12:42 2015 UTC,Hopefully it turns some of them on their head!
DarkMatter,39nrq9,psylenced,2,Sat Jun 13 12:49:26 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this episode, I look forward to more.   I definitely got a Firefly vibe from this show and I  am glad I am not alone."
DarkMatter,39nrq9,farbot,2,Sun Jun 14 02:56:37 2015 UTC,"People are saying this is the spiritual successor to Firefly. I am in accord with that statement as well. Furthermore, I was an avid Stargate Universe fan  and I'd to think that this group of people were the ones who had woken up from sleep on the Destiny (I've noticed that the Raza looks very similar to the Destiny AND the Firefly)"

DarkMatter,39nrq9,DeeBased,2,Sun Jul 19 07:15:12 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's certainly no ""The Wire"".   However this is a situation where we take what we can get, even it's a somewhat low-budget popcorn series. This is the first spaceship show we've had in years - after BSG and the Stargate series were canceled the genre just died. Hopefully it gets better. Episodes three and six have shown that it is possible, so I remain optimistic about the second half of the series. Even in its low points it wasn't terrible.  If you're serious about the ratings question: self-selection bias - tl;dr: those who rate Dark Matter on imdb do so because they watch the show. If they watch it means they enjoy it, so they give it a high rating. Most people who thought it was terrible dropped it after the first episode (or even after just seeing the trailer), then never gave it another thought, let alone bothered to rate it, so their opinion is not accurately reflected.   A similar bias - survivorship bias - explains why later episodes of long running series tend to be rated higher even though there wasn't any substantial improvement in quality (or it even declined)."

DarkMatter,39oofc,Malhallah,3,Sun Jun 14 00:02:23 2015 UTC,Awesome. The redemption / revenge of the victims angle is fresh. Gives good impetus having them on the run like BSG but a lot smaller and personal.

As their memory is fully restored, they figure that the ship was sent on course to a ""second earth"". The ""first earth"" was dying and the world needed a new place to live. The 6 weren't suppose to wake up then. They would go to the second earth and transform it to be habitable to humans. But when they finally reach the second earth, it's just like the first, except more evolved. Almost like a utopia. The six are in a tough situation in where do they help their own earth by taking over the second, or do they work out a peaceful agreement. But they don't know that the android already sent a ""signal"". The first earth is coming. The two earths eventually meet and a war is begun. The 2nd earth surrenders after a major loss and flies into the dark matter.   END OF SEASON 1  SEASON 2  The second earth now travels into what seems to be pure black.  They eventually meet aliens called the ""Jywek"" . Unknown to them, the Jywek are extremely powerful and evil. They form an alliance and go back to the second earth. they soon have the earth surrounded. From the begining the Jywek planned to turn against them. They put the other humans back onto the earth. All the humans are now forced into slavery, building ships so the Jywek can  take over more planets  END OF SEASON 2  SEASON 3  The humans are still in slavery. But a new discovery is made. Dark Matter when charged with electricity opens a wormhole. On night they plan to open it an escape. So they do, on the day with a full moon, they open the wormhole. Almost all the humans escape. The wormhole takes them to an alternate universe ..."

DarkMatter,3935sc,4Nails,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"You will most likely be able to watch it on Syfy's website the day after (if you live in the us). Otherwise, it may take longer to reach other platforms. Have to have a subscription :(   I'll have to contact Syfy soon and ask then."
DarkMatter,3935sc,GooglePlex9000,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:42:24 2015 UTC,Thanks. Would be great to see syfy actually presenting good hard science fiction instead of all the crap.

DarkMatter,37hm7w,TheLantean,3,Wed May 27 18:21:34 2015 UTC,I just keep on getting more and more exited for the premiere
DarkMatter,37hm7w,GooglePlex9000,2,Thu May 28 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"This was awesome, I'm even more excited for the show now. It looked ripped right from the comics.  Video credit: Dark Matter Daily"
DarkMatter,37hm7w,Zerei,1 point,Wed May 27 18:32:47 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the mirror! It wouldn't open here in Brazil the original link!
DarkMatter,37d3wv,TheLantean,3,Tue May 26 19:20:19 2015 UTC,Just for a single moment when I saw Patrick Stewart as the thumbnail I thought he was going to star in it. That will teach me to read a title next time.
DarkMatter,36e6n2,NDIrishB13,3,Mon May 18 18:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, that title was, indeed, a massive spoiler."

DarkMatter,35x2fm,antftw1,1 point,Thu May 14 05:55:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I realize that, but I can't help but think that this series will contain elements of what would have been SGU's third season. It's too much of a coincidence that a major plot element of the SGU finale is the entire premise of this new series."
DarkMatter,35x2fm,acidfro420,2,Thu May 14 07:20:03 2015 UTC,"Being that SGU ended in 2011 and dark matter came out in 2012, I wouldn't be surprised if SGU was an inspiration. They easily could have toyed with the idea of them having amnesia when they woke up in season 3."
DarkMatter,35x2fm,TheLantean,2,Thu May 14 07:36:50 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not the only one, it's pretty clear the writer still wanted to play with those tropes, but got cut off by the abrupt cancellation.   So he made his own series with influences from his favorite shows - Cowboy Bebop, Farscape, Firefly. While it's not an SGU continuation, I see the similarity as an Easter egg or a nod to Stargate fans. It's certainly a big part of why I decided to watch this series.   And since it's the same writer it's inevitable that some of plot threads he had in mind with SGU will be used here, even if by accident."
DarkMatter,35u0bl,TheLantean,2,Wed May 13 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"It looks a bit cheap, like it was made ten years ago or something. I'm not complaining though, that's what we were all asking SyFy to do. If the script is good, that's all I need."
DarkMatter,35u0bl,Mr_Mandrill,5,Wed May 13 16:16:49 2015 UTC,Might not have finished post-production - but really hoping this is a good one.
DarkMatter,35u0bl,symes,2,Thu May 14 07:13:11 2015 UTC,The new design for the Raza looks pretty awesome.

We don't know yet, so far only very basic info about his character is out. But it's pretty late into the production, and it appears he only just started filming this week, so he probably won't be in too many episodes."

DarkMatter,2przxr,SquirtleLieksMudkips,1 point,Sat Dec 20 08:38:58 2014 UTC,"This was an interesting list, I can't say I expected most of them, especially after the comparison with the Stargate cast.  This will be my first time seeing Marc Bendavid, Melissa O’Neil, and Alex Mallari Jr on TV.   I only know Anthony Lemke briefly from a few of his guest roles on other shows, but he'll fit in with his character just fine.   And of course, Roger Cross is awesome, hands down.   I've seen Jodelle Ferland as Young Adria in SG1 and as Harmony in Atlantis, she did a great job of being both creepy and an entitled princess, so no worries there.   Most surprising to me was Zoie Palmer as The Android after seeing her in Lost Girl, in the comics"

DarkMatter,2nds8z,mysticode,1 point,Sun Dec 14 10:30:31 2014 UTC,"They could be spaces for smaller monitors. It's probably easier if they have access from ""outside"" the set to handle the wiring and to place pyrotechnic charges.   In the comics that's right where additional control consoles should be: https://puu.sh/du7z2/edcc31aae2.png and https://puu.sh/du7Eb/6b95e81fcf.png"
