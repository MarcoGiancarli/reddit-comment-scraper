rockets,3e3ls6,stillwaitingatx,7,Tue Jul 21 20:28:17 2015 UTC,Seems pretty lame that this was mentioned by exactly ZERO people on any ESPN programming today. I feel like it might be a different case if Harden and Curry's awards were switched. If that was the case I'm sure they would be talking and agreeing about how the players know better and this award should be taken more seriously than the media's.... ....but that's none of my business I guess...
rockets,3e3ls6,dudenotcool,3,Tue Jul 21 21:44:41 2015 UTC,It is what it is. This obviously doesn't have near the weight the media driven award has. The only way I see this generate more weight is if there are a ton of players who voted with notable players voting whose results are released. I'm sure there will some Warrior discussion on this lol

rockets,3e0feu,avatarish,2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:48 2015 UTC,Could you BE more dominant than Westbrook?
rockets,3e0feu,avatarish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:04:30 2015 UTC,"Should have clarified my title better. Not just ball dominant, but a skilled passing and ball handling 1. Also, hardens role in OKC was markedly different than his role in Houston."
rockets,3e0feu,DaBear405,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:09 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'm just saying that harden is not going to have a problem playing off the ball bc he's been Inc that position before with two superstars in front of him.
rockets,3e0feu,avatarish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:10 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, yeah I totally agree. Plus he specifically said in his exit interview that he wanted another ball handler to take some of that load off of him."
rockets,3e0feu,DaBear405,0,Tue Jul 21 14:32:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's called Harden. At least Westbrook defers to Durant when he needs to."
rockets,3e0feu,avatarish,3,Tue Jul 21 05:08:53 2015 UTC,What? I mean harden played with Westbrook before he starting honing the passing skills. Harden made it work and played efficiently.
rockets,3e0feu,DaBear405,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:53 2015 UTC,"Harden is a super ball dominate guard. People act like its a bad thing, like Westbrook he is able to run an offense, score, and get teammates going."
rockets,3e0feu,50bmg,3,Tue Jul 21 05:12:47 2015 UTC,"Usually when people say ball-dominant, they mean the player can't play off the ball. The player needs to have the ball to be effective. Harden is not such a player. Also, you are remembering a very recent Westbrook. Westbrook (when harden was playing on the thunder) would stagnate the offense so much. Harden, a better facilitator off the bench was the best answer to change the flavor of the line up."
rockets,3e0feu,nenozer,0,Tue Jul 21 05:35:19 2015 UTC,No I am not. Westbrook came into the league raw and his passing has improved every year but while in OKC he was a lot better passer than Harden and he continues to be.    The player needs to have the ball to be effective. Harden is not such a player.   You're just wrong. Obviously any superstar can get points playing off the ball but guys like Harden and Westbrook need the ball to be most effective. Its like buying a racecar and only driving it the speed limit.
rockets,3e0feu,502323,2,Tue Jul 21 05:45:54 2015 UTC,"what you're saying makes sense on paper however it will have to be proven out on the court. We did have an example of a ball dominant pg in lin when he was here, but for whatever reason they didn't mesh as well as they could have. 2 years later, harden is a much better player, lawson is a step or two above lin, especially in confidence, and the rest of the team and coaching has evolved further so we shall see... whatever happens, i'm excited to see the competition in the west this year."
rockets,3e0feu,502323,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:09:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah should have explained that better. Not just someone who dominates the ball, but a skilled ball handler and passer who can elevate hardens game instead of just locking him out of plays."
rockets,3e0feu,Rynehx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:24:19 2015 UTC,I think the issue is Lawson's defense. His DRPM (defensive real plus minus) was ranked #65 among PGs. http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/2/sort/DRPM/position/1  I still think Beverley is the ideal complement to Harden. His 3 pt shooting was still better than Lawson last year.
rockets,3dzrys,jerryHoove,22,Mon Jul 20 21:17:55 2015 UTC,Agree. Our 3rd string could start on the 76ers.
rockets,3dzrys,gunnybears,12,Mon Jul 20 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"Lawson’s pressure on both ends will wear out defenses, especially if he is only required to go full throttle for a few minutes at a time off the bench before checking out again, allowing Harden to return and surgically pick apart his winded defender.   This made my dingus happy."

rockets,3e0rim,bmsuperfly,5,Tue Jul 21 05:40:19 2015 UTC,I don't think your point is wrong. I think your reasoning is bad and that Lawson being on or off the team never changed the Durant factor.   Also 5 guys out of the entire NBA and it's better to use Green as an example over West. West just went ring chasing not pay cut to improve a roster he was already on.

The Rockets backcourt is virtually a better wizards backcourt with Lawson being the facilitating Point Guard who can score like Wall. And Beal is the team's leading scorer and one of the best shooters in the league. They are a poorer version of the Rockets backcourt. 3. Everyone sleeps on the Heat's backcourt, Dragic and Wade complement each other with wade not being able to shoot but still score and Dragic can shoot and score while still facilitate. They have got two players who will average 20 points and 5 assists so I don't see why people put the Wizards and Raptors ahead of them. 4. Raptors have two players who can average 20 points in their backcourt which not many teams can say other than Warriors and Heat."

rockets,3dz63m,HakeemNOlajuwon,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:29 2015 UTC,I have to agree. Talking to Raps fans have not given me a strong confidence in him. I'm surprised there's no better options out there.
rockets,3dz63m,bmsuperfly,4,Mon Jul 20 19:02:36 2015 UTC,"There's only like 5-6 quality bigs left on the market. Hayes probably tops the list in vet presence among those guys. His passing ability alone will be pretty valuable. He pushes fastbreaks fairly well for a big off the rebound which is one of the biggest things we'll miss from Smith.   His defense isn't what it was back in '10, but he still shut down guys every now and then. Just saying also TOR can't figure out how to use their starting C in their system effectively yet alone backups.  Just showing the other side of the coin."
rockets,3dz63m,HakeemNOlajuwon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"If all he brings is a vet presence, then why not just bring him back as a coach or something. He can't really run these days, and his rim protection numbers are horrid. His size is starting to be a hindrance for him at this point in his career.  Who knows maybe another Josh Smith situation happens and we could use that roster spot. It's not like Chuck has a bunch of suitors, don't see the rush to sign him in July."
rockets,3dz63m,bmsuperfly,3,Mon Jul 20 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe he doesn't want to be a coach? Let's be real right now. What available C in our price range or even PF has a good rim protection number?   The guys on the market are Hansbrough(out of our price range), Boozer, Ryan Hollins, Darrell Arthur, and Greg Smith. Seraphin is definitely out of our price range with the vet min.   I feel like he's being bashed for reasons that no one else available does, so it doesn't matter what name is used they're going to get that. He still rebounds at a fair rate and his passing is underrated heavily right now.   Also the not being able to run is ludicrous at this point. If he was really that bad and couldn't then he wouldn't pass the physical so why care? Hayes has always been a half court player who can pass the outlet, but could never run the court.   Also if a Josh Smith happens again then Morey would just cut Hayes at that point if it was that good of a deal. The contract will probably be non guaranteed and Morey would just give him a ring if we win it all.    The rush is once he's under contract he instantly goes to the gym and helps Capela work on his defense and body positioning with rotations as well as boxing out consistently. He's exactly the mentor Capela needs.   It's also possible they just bring him in for training camp to teach guys like Capela, Harrell, and maybe even Williams all he knows."
rockets,3dz63m,HakeemNOlajuwon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"The guys you listed aren't a bad group. Especially Arthur who is probably out of our price range.    I feel like he's being bashed for reasons that no one else available does, so it doesn't matter what name is used they're going to get that. He still rebounds at a fair rate and his passing is underrated heavily right now.    Well for example, Boozer rebounds the similar rate, has similarly bad rim protection, but can stretch the floor, hit free throws, and finishes around the rim pretty well last year. There's also SL guys who could impress in camp etc. Really Chucks' only basketball asset is his playmaking, he's not really better in anything else compared to the other guys available.   I'll wait till the contract details are out, but if it's non-guaranteed then it's obviously not a big deal and likely a body for training camp. I get that he's an asset for helping Capela Harrell etc. but it's not like Chuck is the only guy who knows how to box out properly and play post defense."
rockets,3dz63m,bmsuperfly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"I like Arthur, Hansbrough, and Seraphin, but all are out of vet min range most likely.   It's really Boozer, Hayes, then SL guys, and filler like Hollins and Josh Hamilton. Not a great bunch. Feign reported Wood is in training camp, but Williams is unlikely right now (surprising to me honestly). Seems like Morey wants a vet for the last spot. Not many in that regard.   Could also just be as simple as no one left wants to come here. Boozer may hate the city. Everyone younger may want a bigger role to earn a payday."
rockets,3dz63m,HakeemNOlajuwon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:32 2015 UTC,Makes sense about Williams. There's no way he cracks this roster. I heard he had multiple teams interested in him so he has his pickings about where to play.  The Harrell situation is also interesting. We're really forcing him to taking the minimum if we get Hayes when Mickey got a 4 year deal.
rockets,3dz63m,bmsuperfly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"Unless we drop Wood for training camp yeah. If we cut Wood we can give him the deal, but we'd be hard capped and can't take any salary back at all."
rockets,3dz63m,stillwaitingatx,0,Mon Jul 20 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"Why are you forgetting Javale? Literally the perfect fit for the team, same style of center as Dwight and Clint. Also just straight up more talented than the other names listed."
rockets,3dz63m,bmsuperfly,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:44 2015 UTC,"Because I'm an idiot. He wasn't on the FA list I was using. Probably because he wasn't scheduled to be a FA this year.   It's also only 1 person. The chances of any team landing 1 specific guy is pretty bad. We weren't interested in him last year when he was a FA and we had a need so doubt we are now. Maybe if he's friends with Ty, but not sure he would have that swing yet."
rockets,3dz63m,stillwaitingatx,0,Mon Jul 20 20:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if it's even possible. I really think that he would be the best option, his length with this team would be awesome. Would he do it though, and would Morey/could Morey do it? I think Ty could help bring him, plus being a contender, just not sure what he's looking for."
rockets,3dz63m,bmsuperfly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:00 2015 UTC,"Too many variables with 1 guy. Maybe he doesn't like the role, $, teammates, city, coach. Maybe the team doesn't like what he brings to the table or work ethic. Maybe Ty and him never got along that great?   So many variables for 1 guy and any of them mean the difference between yes or no. If I had to guess he wouldn't be here and Hayes will be announced by the end of the day or tomorrow along with Terry, but we'll see."

rockets,3dz63m,yuv9,4,Mon Jul 20 22:07:33 2015 UTC,I think one thing we do lack is a defensively oriented big off the bench. Hayes is that guy that you use in the playoffs to cool off a red hot Aldridge or Griffin when Howard is in foul trouble or needed as a rim protector.   Although I do hesitate to give up a roster spot when I'd really like to keep something open for a young developmental kind of guys.
rockets,3dz63m,Ceero_Bro,0,Mon Jul 20 19:55:47 2015 UTC,Aldridge will whore turnaround jumpers over him all day
rockets,3dz63m,yuv9,3,Mon Jul 20 20:31:25 2015 UTC,You seem to be a Chuck hater. Why? You say he's just not good at basketball? Why don't you flesh out your opinion instead of just writing blurbs.
rockets,3dz63m,Ceero_Bro,0,Mon Jul 20 21:10:29 2015 UTC,"He cant shoot, he cant dribble well. Hes not a threat driving and finishing in the paint which is where he is limited to (see first 3 words). When he was younger he was athletic enough to play some solid D thats about it. What does he bring to the table that we dont have from anyone on our summer league team or the roster right this second?  and this https://youtu.be/0wQq9YWZ568  Is that enought for you? I dont care what you say I just dont think he can be an asset that should drawl a salary for playing basketball. Period. I love the Rockets thats it. I want whats best for our team.   You cool withh that?  edit: i 100% think Hakeem would be a better signing. Honestly. Hes tall enough to put his hands up and change a shot or two and if he just fucking stands on the baseline (like Jones does sometimes) hel get the ball and swish little 12-15 footers all day. Id rather roll the dice on that, than have Chuck Hayes on the floor. Thats how i honestly feel. I really hope this is good enough for you and has clarified things. Thanks for your time."
rockets,3dz63m,yuv9,3,Mon Jul 20 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"So you dislike him because he   Can't dribble well Not an offensive driving threat Not a goof offensive finisher Shoots ugly free throws   The only problem is, he isn't going to be asked to do any of those things. He's going to be asked to slow people down in the post and play defence, things that actually fit his skillset. He's a positional defender. He's not going to block shots or protect the rim, but he's going to make offensive players have to work much harder to get into their spots. Defense is often about preventing people from getting past you, pushing people out of their comfort zones and generally just making life difficult.   What he brings to the table is experience. He brings post defense. Those are things that you're not going to get in summer league guys.   If you think Hakeem right now is a better basketball player than Chuck Hayes, you're really living in the past. If he could still play, don't you think he would still be on a roster?  I don't know if Williams would be better long term for this team than Hayes, but to say that Hayes brings nothing to the table because he's not an offensive threat is ridiculous."
rockets,3dz63m,Ceero_Bro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:42:31 2015 UTC,I say take Williams or force Christian Wood to lift weights and shove protein down his throat and give him the spot. Please tell me which 4 in the west hes going to slow down. Enlighten me. AD? Dirk? Duncan? Aldridge? Blake Griffin? I am saying hes neither an offensive or defensive threat at all in the position that this team will be in.

We've seen KD and Westbrick combine for 60 shots a game and it doesnt work. Golden State I think will be good but it will be tougher in the playoffs.

Harden would be an ideal 6th man though on an all-time team. I wouldn't start him over prime Drexler who would have won multiple championships with Hakeem if he had been traded earlier in his career OR the Rockets didn't trade for Chuck.  Assuming each player is in their prime, your team would be right up there with the all time Celtics, Lakers, and Bulls teams. Hakeem was the prototype stretch 4 who could shoot from outside, create his own offense, and play big man defense (best shot blocker ever). It's just due to also having Ralph Sampson and then playing against Kareem, Shaq, Admiral, Ewing, and the other great bigs of the 80s and 90s that kept him at the 5."
rockets,3dzr2l,KKG_Apok,2,Mon Jul 20 22:37:22 2015 UTC,Hakeem at the 5 and Malone at the 4 would probably be fine either way

rockets,3dywzc,dcooley17,16,Mon Jul 20 17:40:10 2015 UTC,His defense will be sorely missed. That's the biggest hole. His offense won't be.
rockets,3dywzc,HakeemNOlajuwon,5,Mon Jul 20 17:43:39 2015 UTC,"His defense was terrible in his time as a Rocket. I'm trying not to be overly hating, but he had several key moments where his defense flashed.   But he was consistently terrible on rotations and post defense throughout his tenure here. He would have ""lights on"" moment where he amps it up at certain times but it was not as consistent as what was expected."
rockets,3dywzc,The_New_New,6,Mon Jul 20 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"Statistically his defense was pretty elite, both in post ups and PnR. His rim protection numbers were on par with Dwight. He is certainly a better defender than TJones and DMo, which makes that a loss."
rockets,3dywzc,HakeemNOlajuwon,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"was Josh's defense elite, or were the Rockets' coaches able to put him in position play elite defense? I say it is the latter."

rockets,3dywzc,Beverlythepirate,9,Mon Jul 20 17:59:18 2015 UTC,"Dmo and Tjones can't pass like Josh could, see the Mavericks series. (quick note- Donuts can definitely dish the rock for a 7footer, don't get me wrong, it's just not one of his strong suites). Dmo and Tjones don't have the confidence to dribble down, pull up, hit a 3 like Smoove could, see the comeback in the Clippers series- Josh played a pivotal role.    It should also be noted that Josh was pretty inconsistent, and was pretty abysmal during the Warriors series.  What we're going to lose from Josh boils down to two things- His defense, which is undeniably good, and his playmaking (pull up 3's to spur a comeback, can handle the ball and pass out of the fast break, beautifully placed lobs to Dwight off the 4/5 roll), which is inconsistent.   Lucky for us, we brought in another playmaker in the form of Lawson, who also happens to be a better passer, dribble, attacker, and shooter than Josh, who plays a role where we needed depth the most.  For us to not feel the hurt of Josh's departure, Dmo or Terrence (preferably both) will have to step up their defense. If we can improve our defense and rebounding at the 4, and the squad remains overall healthy, we're set up for a long, long run this season."
rockets,3dywzc,Dframe44,5,Mon Jul 20 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Josh is a skilled playmaker. I would say he's a willing playmaker and isn't afraid of making mistakes, which is good and bad. His A/T ratio was close to 1 and he had the second highest TO/100 and TOV% on the team. Really when the ball leaves his hands it's a coin flip whether it will be good or bad."
rockets,3dywzc,HakeemNOlajuwon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I shouldve worded it differently. Josh was a guy that could step up and make plays on a team that needed another guy to step up and make plays. The playoffs were a perfect window into what he was - a guy who one night comes out and picks apart defenses with his passing, is the catalyst for a comeback run with his 3pt shooting, and solidifies the interior with great defense... and then the other night comes out and misses easy shots, turns the ball over with bad decision making, and dribbles into traffic without the appropriate handles."

rockets,3dywzc,CorriganJames,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"If we're able to stay healthy, i think losing Josh won't really be that bad. Dmo is so important to our team and TJ will be a plus backup PF.   I really don't think Smith would have gotten enough shots or would have enough of a role within our rotation to be as effective as he was last year. Especially now, with Lawson."
rockets,3dywzc,Schlopez,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think losing JS was as big of a blow as LA gaining him, if that makes sense. Offensively, he was a net negative on the floor, despite his performance in a few key games during the playoffs. Defensively, he will be missed, but the drop off is not that severe with TJ or DMO. As of right now, we are a better team than when the season ended."
rockets,3dywzc,freeze00up,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:35 2015 UTC,Last year our lack of health was key in allowing Josh to shine. Dmo/Dwight out gave Josh the minutes and no Beverly allowed him to handle the ball more. Now if we can stay relatively healthy +Lawson there is far less reason to play him and hopefully wont be missed too much.

KJ is more than likely going to see more minutes and produce quickly. Everybody knows K-Pap just had great spirit & Dorsey was probably the worst player in the roster. Johnson was okay but he could turn into a regular rotation players. We didn't give up stars or anything. We still have a pretty solid roster & we could probably get more role players if anything.
rockets,3dw730,IDontBeatGames,19,Mon Jul 20 01:49:54 2015 UTC,so in other words we lost a first round pick
rockets,3dw730,Aznjeff,16,Mon Jul 20 01:31:08 2015 UTC,"Protected, so it's no big deal, especially since we got a second rounder in return. This trade is a freaking steal."
rockets,3dw730,geezergamer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:41:56 2015 UTC,And they'll be mid tank when we get their second. Not bad at all

rockets,3dw730,IDontBeatGames,7,Mon Jul 20 01:38:15 2015 UTC,The only thing that could make this trade even more glorious: we outbid the Lakers lolololol !

rockets,3dw730,IDontBeatGames,27,Mon Jul 20 18:48:21 2015 UTC,Why are people bringing up his contract..? He's a point guard we need and we're trying to win now
rockets,3dw730,pieman2005,6,Mon Jul 20 01:25:13 2015 UTC,Seriously haha. I have no idea where the bad contract talk comes from lol
rockets,3dw730,pieman2005,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:47:38 2015 UTC,Any fans who talk about his contract need to go back to 5th grade math class.
rockets,3dw730,RobAmedeo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:00:01 2015 UTC,"Under old salary cap maybe they could have a point, but with the money we saw being thrown around this summer to mediocre players, no chance."
rockets,3dw730,recursion8,20,Mon Jul 20 08:54:40 2015 UTC,"Unbelievable. This was my favorite player in the league up until the last two seasons. Daryl Morey, you really are one of our greatest assets.  Thanks, Mr. Morey and Mr. Alexander. I'm a proud fan of this team!"
rockets,3dw730,SeaRavenTX,6,Mon Jul 20 17:21:15 2015 UTC,Starting line-up: Lawson - Harden - Ariza - D-Mo - Howard - Morey.  He's the biggest of the bigs.
rockets,3dw730,RobAmedeo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:30:03 2015 UTC,They'll probably start Bev
rockets,3dw730,KickedInTheDonuts,3,Mon Jul 20 08:55:46 2015 UTC,"Either way, the point was Morey as the main guy. ;)"
rockets,3dw730,RobAmedeo,2,Mon Jul 20 09:40:25 2015 UTC,Highly doubtful. We needed a primary ball handler at the point guard position. Now Harden doesn't have to play out of position down the stretch
rockets,3dw730,Jmrwacko,2,Mon Jul 20 10:18:17 2015 UTC,"in clutch situations sure you go with lawson, but your second unit would be way better with beverley starting. just rotate the 3 of them and terry. they can all play together"

rockets,3dw730,KickedInTheDonuts,18,Mon Jul 20 17:25:44 2015 UTC,Shots all around !!!  i'm talking open 3's
rockets,3dw730,Bentekkers22,3,Mon Jul 20 20:36:44 2015 UTC,Fun fact: He holds the record for most consecutive 3s made in a game with 10 against the Timberwolves a few years ago.
rockets,3dw730,Ngata_chance,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:22:47 2015 UTC,too bad he's not stellar from 3
rockets,3dw730,Dframe44,18,Mon Jul 20 06:19:21 2015 UTC,james harden = 37% career  ty lawson = 36.9% career  sounds good to me
rockets,3dw730,mushyz,4,Mon Jul 20 01:51:01 2015 UTC,This stat actually surprised me quite a bit.
rockets,3dw730,xIrish,4,Mon Jul 20 03:09:49 2015 UTC,TY has gotten worse every year of his career from 3PT.   Could be a red flag. I think that's natural though because he's played with fewer and fewer good playmakers as his career has gone on. Should go back up playing next to Harden and drawing the 2nd best defender.
rockets,3dw730,raundor,2,Mon Jul 20 05:55:32 2015 UTC,His teammates have also gotten shittier too. He went from playing with melo to playing with guys who should be in the dleague. I think we'll see that % tick up when he's not relied on to be the man
rockets,3dw730,mushyz,2,Mon Jul 20 08:02:58 2015 UTC,He'll have around 40% 3p with Houston because he'll constantly get open corner looks. It'll be like Brewer 2.0.
rockets,3dw730,Jmrwacko,8,Mon Jul 20 12:43:52 2015 UTC,We just got JSmoove and Beverley to up their 3pt game. We can make miracles happen. Just not from the free point line
rockets,3dw730,JesseJaymz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:14 2015 UTC,Beverlys 3pt has declined considerably since he came into the league...

rockets,3dw730,6mexicans,7,Mon Jul 20 15:28:51 2015 UTC,"But he can get pretty damn hot. I think the guy above was referring to more open threes since we have a distributing PG now, though."
rockets,3dw730,DireDireDuck,14,Mon Jul 20 03:35:12 2015 UTC,"Finally, some point guard depth. Bev finally has some help. And Daryl fucking Morey, what a great trade for him."

EDIT:  ""Rockets will give up almost no one in playoff rotation -- Papanikolaou, Prigioni, Dorsey, Johnson -- along with 1st (protected) for Lawson.""  Holy hell...not even TJones.  The 1st is the only thing of real value there, besides maybe Johnson.  EDIT #2:  AND we got a 2nd rounder back?   We just robbed the Nuggets blind."
rockets,3dw730,_secretvampire_,11,Mon Jul 20 01:19:04 2015 UTC,we gave up pablo kostas and dorsey and a first rounder

rockets,3dw730,bmsuperfly,9,Mon Jul 20 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"Did we rob Denver?  Maybe we did because T. Jones wasnt a part of the deal, will miss K-papa.  Lawson is a liability, I hope he can figure his ish out so he can come in ready to contribute.  BUT OH YES, MORBO IS VERY PLEASED."
rockets,3dw730,bigr3000,3,Mon Jul 20 01:26:05 2015 UTC,Did we rob Denver?   Well they got as much as they could for him so not really. His stock was so low they considered just waiving him which probably would have been better because you could have signed him for cheap without giving up anything.

Mostly so we can tell Ty he's the starter, but still stagger some of his and Hardens minutes. But unless match ups dictated otherwise I'd want both Ty and Harden in the court at the beginning of the 1st and 3rd to try and prevent slow starts. Get some 20 point 4th quarter leads and let the bench take the court."

James is still the primary option, and our biggest problem last year was a fluid offense when he rested. Makes a lot of sense to bring Ty off the bench to feast on 2nd units. You can swap Ty/bev in the 4th depending on match ups, but I think bev is the better starting option."
rockets,3dxigk,pieman2005,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:41:07 2015 UTC,The way i see it Lawson will be on the court at all times when Harden rests. But that doesn't mean you can't start Lawson. Lawson will probably be the first player to sub out.

Yes, he can create his own shot.  He'll be our secondary offense creator after Harden.

rockets,3dz8rj,msjd1983,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"To the best of my knowledge, he's never done anything wrong during the regular season. He shows up and plays. Also, being in a winning environment can help, too. Unfortunately I think he'll get a suspension."

rockets,3dyi8o,regularshowrulez42,12,Mon Jul 20 15:57:11 2015 UTC,this narrative that harden has to have the ball at all times is baseless and just simply untrue.  getting sick of reading it
rockets,3dyi8o,mushyz,7,Mon Jul 20 16:06:36 2015 UTC,"People are acting like it's so crazy that we got a secondary ball handler, when that's exactly the point and something Harden openly asked for."
rockets,3dyi8o,crusherexploder,7,Mon Jul 20 16:20:40 2015 UTC,"Breeze by the season, but he's going to have to nail the rotations in the playoffs."
rockets,3dyi8o,bmsuperfly,3,Mon Jul 20 15:59:57 2015 UTC,Who do you think starts? Lawson or Bev
rockets,3dyi8o,bmsuperfly,6,Mon Jul 20 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"Fit wise Bev makes more sense, but egos probably make Lawson start still. Won't matter as long as McHale does proper rotation."
rockets,3dyi8o,Cheerr,4,Mon Jul 20 16:04:24 2015 UTC,"However, if lawson does end up coming off the bench, lawson/capela PnR will be great to watch."
rockets,3dyi8o,PapaLRodz,4,Mon Jul 20 17:19:07 2015 UTC,"To me, Lawson is the much better player and the starter. Bev is coming off both injury and a shaky season before injury last year while Lawson was almost an all-star. They'll both get tons of minutes though."
rockets,3dyi8o,megafartcloud,6,Mon Jul 20 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but the expectations were set last year. Anything less than a Finals appearance is a failure. If Lawson were signed to a multi-term deal, I would be okay with just making the WCF and losing (competitvely). Since he is most likely a rent-a-player, the Rockets need to get to the Finals now. There is no tomorrow."
rockets,3dyi8o,miniboss1487,3,Mon Jul 20 17:43:16 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Also people are forgetting that Dwight is getting older and he has a player option next year. There's no guarantee he stays.
rockets,3dyi8o,DrPeckers,0,Mon Jul 20 18:27:18 2015 UTC,"I really do not understand this article's premise and logic.  Yes, we know that both Lawson and Harden are ball dominant.  But if the pairing does not work out, how is that McHale's fault?  Why is McHale's job on the line after he just got a major extension?  What makes the Lawson situation so different from McHale's past troublesome players that McHale cannot handle Lawson?  All of these questions are asked in the article and assumed to be the negative answer with no reasoning.   I can understand disliking McHale as a coach, but this article is an unfair critique on him and the Lawson situation.  It is not worth the read.  Also, extreme lolz at the deepest team in the league being the okc thunder."

rockets,3dwmqc,MrSlimshady21,8,Mon Jul 20 03:39:09 2015 UTC,So its possible to offer KD a max next year if Dwight opts out and takes a longer term / less $$ deal?
rockets,3dwmqc,Clutch_,5,Mon Jul 20 03:59:25 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but it's going to require some roster shakeup with key guys. If Dwight opts out and takes a lower end deal it would help us keep some depth, but I'm not holding my breath."
rockets,3dwmqc,bmsuperfly,3,Mon Jul 20 04:15:53 2015 UTC,the cap jump is going to make things interesting next offseason
rockets,3dwmqc,monkeyvselephant,2,Mon Jul 20 04:34:19 2015 UTC,The jump doesn't really open any space for us as is unless it has another secondary jump like this year had. Majority of space is going to be through Dwight opting out and moving guys.
rockets,3dwmqc,bmsuperfly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:46:25 2015 UTC,"~7-8M free and ~12M in cap holds between Brewer, Dmo, and Jones.   Also, would expect it to make another secondary jump before the huge balloon in 2017-18 season.  Granted... i can only imagine what a max contract to durant will look like."
rockets,3dwmqc,monkeyvselephant,2,Mon Jul 20 05:12:16 2015 UTC,"Brewer cap hold?   Yeah 7-8m + a hopeful Dwight pay cut still is going to cost us 2 if not 3 guys just to offer a max to Durant.   He'd have to give us the go ahead before we did it, but maybe. So far away not even going to think about it."
rockets,3dwmqc,bmsuperfly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:18:41 2015 UTC,"Brewer cap hold?   ugh, sportrac isn't updated for the offseason.  it was the player option he waived when he was traded to Rockets.  nvm"
rockets,3dwmqc,monkeyvselephant,2,Mon Jul 20 05:29:21 2015 UTC,KD + Ariza + Brewer + Capela + any other player not named Raymond Felton would give us the skinniest on-court five of all time.

rockets,3dwdct,Aznguyener,2,Mon Jul 20 14:26:58 2015 UTC,"He has the same qualities as CP3 except Ty's probably a bit less consistent.  I think Ty's gonna become our main facilitator because, as good as Harden is, he's just too big/slow (compared to Ty and CP3) to make those ""threading the needle"" passes inside. Harden will also focus more on scoring without having to worry about being the facilitator all the time (which he was last year).   Ty just needs to get his shit together and we're golden baby!"

rockets,3dwdct,rollinff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:53 2015 UTC,Ty's definitely starting. He'll take a load off of Harden who'll focus more on scoring and won't have to be the facilitator all the time like he was last year.
rockets,3dwdct,VicFromHouston,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:29 2015 UTC,"He's not a super great fit with our offense & Harden.  Keeps the ball in his hands a LOT, as in among the most of anyone in the league.  That said, it was a fairly low-risk bet on the most talented player available for a position of need.  So, I'm happy about the move.  Beverley is a better ""fit"" in terms of skillset (defense, doesn't need the ball in his hands), but Lawson is hands-down the better player.  Hopefully a second playmaker on the perimeter will bear that out."
