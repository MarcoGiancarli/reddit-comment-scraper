Woodcarving,3e3ead,Crapspray,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:12 2015 UTC,Those are quiet a few chisels
Woodcarving,3e3add,ofthebaltic,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:24 2015 UTC,"I've used pine, maple, cherry, white oak, and red oak. Also some mystery woods I found in the forest. The pine (white pine I think) is pretty easy to carve, but it sometimes has alternating rings of soft and much harder wood, which can be a real pain to work with. I like it for carving, though, and we've got several older pines on the property that we wind up taking down once or twice a year. I really like maple for spoons and the like, but the grain can kind of pull away if your tools are dull and the wood is greenish. Cherry is great, but is tougher to carve than the others. It  is pretty hard, and the grain doesn't seem to rip much. I'm saving a larger piece for a chess set once I get better. White oak works, but I'm not a big fan of it. I don't like red oak much, but it does have nice colour. It's too porous to use for anything holding water without sealing. I don't personally treat the wood I use, most of it is rescued from the firewood pile. It does tend to be pretty seasonned, which helps avoid cracking. You'll want to avoid using the pith (the spongey stuff in the middle), especially on green wood as that's a very probably cracking location. Hope this helps!"
Woodcarving,3e2g0p,buzzkillichuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:57 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing a few months ago. I went to my nearest Michaels (any craft store will probably carry the same stuff) and bought a couple blocks of 'practice' bass wood and a crummy carving knife.  It wasn't the WORST thing I've ever used. It was really tough to keep an edge for more that 5 minutes. I'm also a horrible carver so there's that. I bought a strop to keep it in shape throughout the process.  I 200-something sandpaper to get the REALLY rough patches out and called it a day. Applied some boiled linseed oil and I was finished.  I whittled a Christian Cross. Simple, handmade, from the heart. I haven't tried them, but beginners seem to do well with spoons.   Additionally, if you get enough wood you could do a decent size heart and burn/carve initials or some other message into it. Painting it is also always an option."

It was my third piece, but I've been pretty ambitious so far. I did a ball in a cage, but I rounded the two ends and carved her initials on both ends. Well, I guess I carved out the initials so that they're raised out. The initials are as big as the rounded surfaces so it blends into the piece.   Another thing you could do which I considered earlier was carving a block into the initials on different sides, so you would see different letters by holding it different ways. Two letters shouldn't be that hard, three if you're ambitious, going through all 6 sides. I was thinking about incorporating this into a larger piece, though I don't know what that would be."

Woodcarving,3e0v9r,rowawaymythrowaway,3,Tue Jul 21 02:27:25 2015 UTC,"Approximately 39 months.   I have no idea, it would depend on if you were carving every day or not. Also, if you could bang out awesome pieces with a bowie knife with ease there would not be a large market for knives specific to carving. The fact of the matter is carving knives exist for a reason and while you can get decent rough carvings with any knife you're limiting yourself without a dedicated carving set.  That being said though I began carving with a cheap victorinox with wood i found in my back yard. This hobby is to relax and be creative, you don't have to be making high quality pieces. But honestly there was a world of difference when i got my first carving knives."
Woodcarving,3e0v9r,Rawkynn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:27:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. :) Are there any carving good knives you would personally reccomend that aren't expensive?
Woodcarving,3e0v9r,Kazick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:44 2015 UTC,"For starting out, I just had a pocket knife and some sand paper. The more I get in to it the more tools I get.  Don't get too gung-ho and buy a bunch of tools before you find if you have the aptitude, time, or enjoy it. The more you get into a hobby the more expensive it gets. Start small and simple and go from there. The less your tools are able to perform a specific need add them to your inventory.   One of the first tools you'll need to enjoy it is a sharp knife. It's no fun working with a dull knife that slows you down and doesn't give the desired effect."

Woodcarving,3dey98,sudogs56,3,Wed Jul 15 19:12:32 2015 UTC,"I've posted several times here about my affair with the Dremel.  I've been using the same one for about two decades, I forget which design it is -- I know it has variable speed control.  For my biggest carving to date that involved extreme Dremel use, I used a 'flex-tip' with standard 60grit drums most of the time.  I found that is could almost melt the (bass)wood with the right technique at about a speed of '2' (out of a max '5') on the switch.  Still, it's not too handy for finishing, so the final surface came about from carving blades & hand-sanding."

Woodcarving,3cy5cl,koobar,3,Sat Jul 11 20:58:15 2015 UTC,"Most finishes will darken wood, especially oil-based ones. If you want your piece to stay the same color, you want to use something like this, or anything labelled as a clear finish.  Keep it slightly moist while carving so it doesn't crack up, but dry it before you add finish. I don't know what type of piece you're carving, but while I was working on a staff of ironwood, I kept one end wrapped in a slightly damp cloth when I wasn't working on it so the wood would seep in a little water and not get too brittle or hard.   And make sure each layer of finish is completely dry before applying a new layer, or it will come out unevenly. This process can take days."
Woodcarving,3cy5cl,shellythelast,3,Sun Jul 12 06:41:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, there is good advice.  Do you sand before or after drying?"

Woodcarving,3cmuti,BonersMalloy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:24:54 2015 UTC,"Cool!  What was your starting material and what knife/knives/tools did you use?  I enjoyed seeing the improvements in each pic, I was especially impressed by how accurately the tiny Strat and SG are shaped. You've got a great eye.  It is clear you traced the basic shape with a marker, obviously, (not that that's cheating or anything) so what I'm impressed with is the accuracy of the angles and contours, very very good detailing. You even got the curve on the back side of the necks and the overall beveling on the bodies spot on, down to the slope on the bottom part of the Strat's body.   I wonder, were you planning on making them even more finely detailed? I can't help but envision them as fully spiffed up replicas, since they're already so close to perfect. My imagination is kinda running wild with all the possibilities.  Maybe give them a nice glossy coat or two of paint, and/or you could even go as far as to make the hardware, like pickups, bridge, tuners, nut and such from matchsticks that have beeb cut down to size and detailed with an x-acto or something, and then maybe use some fine tip paint pens/markers to add any other details to the matchstick pieces, and maybe even add some nice black or white trim to the corners of the body. You could probably also do your detailing in wood burning, stick to the natural look.  Ooh! Speaking of paint/trim though, the SG would look great in black with white trim and gold hardware. You could use toothpicks for the frets if you wanted to keep it all wood, or maybe even trim off tiny segments of paper clip or safety pin, to give them a more realistic look. You could use the heads of pins or small tacks to make the volume/tone knobs and such.   .....sorry, I seem to have mentally kidnapped your project. They're perfectly good pieces of work as-is, I'm not suggesting they're incomplete or imperfect, I just got carried away pondering all of the various possibilities. Just saying, I don't know if you already work with wood for a living or if you're just a hobbyist, but I'm confident that even as a hobbyist, you could probably actually make a few bucks on Etsy pretty easily, making similar tiny replicas of famous guitars, like Frankenstein, Lucille, Bullseye, Red Special, etc. or even doing commissions making replicas of customers' personal instruments.

Woodcarving,3c1ly3,The_Esoteric_Mason,2,Fri Jul 3 22:42:10 2015 UTC,If you want to stain it you could start with a light coat of clear sanding sealer.  That should help the stain stay even and avoid blotching. I've found clear/protective coats from a spray can work best on carvings. It's hard to get smooth coats with a brush. Just make sure to apply many light coats.

Woodcarving,3c0rrx,TheJD,2,Fri Jul 3 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"I'm almost done with making my first spoon with plans on making a bunch more until I get the fundamentals down.  Since it's all (I'm assuming) still fresh in your mind, what would you say is the biggest difference in your technique from your first spoon to your 12th?  What did you learn and improve on the most from when you started to where you are now?  Any tips to help someone travel the same path?"
Woodcarving,3c0rrx,TheJD,2,Wed Jul 8 21:56:50 2015 UTC,"I think the most important thing is having the right tools. A good wood carving knife is essential- I really like this one. A hook knife is very useful, this one is great. But even better than that is a good gouge, you can really get some power behind it.  A hatchet is perfect for rough shaping in the beginning, and I like to use a froe to split logs down to spoon size but it's not necessary.  Other than that, I'd say ""be willing to fuck up"". Sometimes I get a little risky with cuts I'm going to make, but it usually ends up OK. And you really need to learn what not to do to learn what to do.  Drawing an outline on the wood with a pencil helps a lot.   Really, just pick out some soft, straight-grained wood, make a piece that you can carve your spoon out of, and draw your spoon on it. Start carving away everything that's not spoon.  Be mindful of the grain and the direction you're cutting- always ask yourself if my knife slides into the grain and splits the wood, is it going to fuck up my piece?  You'll get good quick if you just keep at it and have fun with it. Also, a spoon mule is nice to have if you've the inclination to build one. It's not tough. Here is a video of Dave Canterbury using one. He actually got that idea from me!"
Woodcarving,3c0rrx,PriceZombie,2,Thu Jul 9 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"lol, I actually have the same 2 Mora knives.  I also ended up picking up a bent sweep gouge from Woodcraft as well and found it easier to carve out the spoon with.   Thanks for the video of spoon mule, I haven't seen anything like that before!  I watched Dave's videos when he was putting together his lathe and shaving horse but never saw the spoon mule.  I used to watch a lot of his Bushcrafting videos and only recently saw more of his wood carving stuff."

Woodcarving,3bqlrp,stsummitt,21,Wed Jul 1 10:27:16 2015 UTC,"That looks like you're typical 'wood carving' set, such as the one from Crown: http://www.crownhandtools.ltd.uk/page39.html  You're size expectations are a little at odds with mine:  Over a foot is 'large', I would say!  Indeed, I've only one black that's over a foot (a 14inch lacewood platter blank), and it's gigantic!  (All this is depending on tools and intent, of course - to a chainsaw carver, a  foot is quite possibly in the 'dangerously small' category).  Those sets of tools are a nice introduction - I'm afraid that the bad news is that as you progress you'll start to feel the 'gaps' in the set more; depending on what you do, that can mean either one or two specific new tools.  I've ended up with, er, about 30 or so so far, and only a 'few' gaps leftâ€¦. but then, I do tend to jump about over a range of things.  Those flat chisels look like they're double beveled (i.e. have a bevel on both sides, as opposed to carpenter chisels, which have a bevel on both sides).  That's a good sign - carving chisels generally should be, and if they came like that it's a sign of quality.  However good they are, they will need a sharpen, and a strop before use to get the best results.  The flat chisels are much easier to sharpen, hence I recommend getting the feel of sharpening them first, before working on the gouges etc.  And get a strop - a bit of leather on a flat board, with a little polishing compound on it.  (The difference between compounds is very small, compared to stropping or not; get what ever is easiest - green polishing compound, Tormek paste, the flex cut stuff, razor compound etc.)  Right, enough meandering, time to address your actual question: what size pieces are they best for.  For a flat chisel, in principle it doesn't matter - you can extend a straight line cut by moving the chisel.  In practive, you don't want to do that too much, or too often.  Also, if you move the chisel along the cut line, you want a bit of overlap.  So a rough (very rough!) rule of thumb is that the ideal width is equal to the chisel, but you can got up to somewhere around two to three times that (before you get too irked), although there is some loss in precision.  For the v-gouge, the width of cut depends on how deep you push it.  There's a limit to depth, depending on the sharpness, bevel angle, and the material properties of the workpiece; but aside from that you don't want to go over around 75% depth normally (the rest of the tool is there to let you check on the angle etc.  (Even then, I'd normally make a relief cut to take out about 2/3 of the material, before a deep finish cut.)  That gives you an idea of the feature size it'l cut - although, given that one side of the cut with a v-chisel is always rough, it's common to use it to just cut the sides of things.  Clearly, there is no real limit to the length of the cut with the v-chisel; practical concerns about arm length apply, however!  The gouge, with it's part-circular cross section is less flexible - it cuts an arc, with fixed curvature, and fixed width.  If you're hollowing down from a surface, you can use it only part depth, (in which case, I'd not normally go deeper than 75%, as with the v-gouge).  In a stab cut, you can cut a circle, of fixed radius, by rotating, with overlap, the gouge (a mallet is handy for this sort of operation).  From memory, you'll find that the circle diameter is probably around 3 to 4 times the width of the chisel.  (It's 'more gouges' that's the rallying cry of carvers; different widths and curvatures are very handy).  The chisels with the curved blades are intended for use where the straight bladed would get in the way (on curved surfaces, or undercutting things) - initially these will be 'less used' tools, I'm afraid.  When you need them, they are indispensable, but that's not often.  Other than that, the feature size is determined in the same way.  Right, so where's that got us?  Hopefully you can now look at the tools, and get an idea of the size of thing that they will cut.  How do we translate that into the size of a finished piece?  Well, to a certain extent, they're not tightly related - one could cover a 6 foot dining table with fine carvings with these tools.  In practice, however, it's worth distinguishing between two distinct 'modes' of usage: Sculptural and Surface.  By Sculptural, I mean changing the basic shape of an object: such as turning a squared block into a bowl, a figurine, or a chess piece.  By Surface, I mean putting detail onto a piece, that doesn't change the basic shape of an object.  Carving a leaf motif, putting the dragons claw on a table length, and so on.  Of course, this is an artificial distinction; the two blur into each other, but I think it's a useful dichotomy, in that it makes you look at the tools in different ways.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1X6mmzNyIA is a video of Mary May, showing a few things about carving, and how to carve a flower.  I'd recommend having a look at that, and I think something like that is a good exercise - it's not the most intricate of shapes, defiantly 'looks like' something, and can be easily adapted to the size of the tools you have.  Note that she's expecting two gouges - a tighter curve (higher number sweep) and a shallower (smaller number sweep), if you condense that to one, it'll be a bit different flower.  So, if you notice the way that Mary did the hemisphere in the centre of the flower, using the gouge - that's the 'natural' size that the gouge cuts.  If you were making a Staunton pattern chess set, then the top of the pawns will be a hemisphere, so that's a connection between the gouge size and piece size (in a Sculptural mode).   From memory, I suspect that this will be a little smaller than conventional, but not problematically so.  There is another way to make Sculptural forms - one can roughly hack at the wood with chisels (the skew chisel is particularly handy for this), and then get it to the right sort of shape, and smooth it off with other techniques (sandpaper, usually).  This is not uncommon, although not traditional - mostly because sanding will soften details.  There is nothing stopping one roughing in a shape, sanding it to the final shape, then picking up the tools again to carve details - although it is more work, and sometimes sandpaper particles can get left in the wood, which is not great for tools.  Right, hopefully through that meandering, you've got the gist that there's not a tight relationship; it's all about the feature size you are carving, rather than the whole piece, which means it's only a limit for sculptural mode work, and in those cases one can substitute other techniques (generally a bit slower than having the right tool, but often a lot cheaper!).  As an exercise, I'd strongly recommend getting some lime wood (basswood), and try both the flower I linked, and carving a pawn.  That'll let you feel how the tools cut, and give you a bit of a feel on how to answer that sort of question yourself.  Note that you'll need some sort of clamp for the wood - needn't be too much, I've used a Â£10 'workbench', or just clamped a bit of wood to the coffee table with a Â£3 clamp before, and that works (for smaller items, in softer woods anyway.  Working in oak or beech takes a little more than that!).  If you had a specific project in mind, if you let us know someone might be able to give more specific advice; although I'd still recommend doing both those above, as it's all good experience."

Did you mean that one of them has a bevel on only one side? If so, which is it? :)"
Woodcarving,3bqlrp,StoicSalamander,2,Wed Jul 1 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"No, I meant that an entirely different class of chisels (hence, not in the picture) have a single bevel.  http://www.rutlands.co.uk/sp+woodworking-whats-hot-special-offers-woodworking-special-offers-set-of-6-wood-chisels-with-sharpening-stone-dakota+dkwk21 is a good example.  They have a single bevel, because that's more useful for morticing and flush cutting - two things very rarely done in carving [0], but common to joinery.  There as number of positive reasons carving chisels are double beveled, other than not needing the single - generally speaking they are ground at shallower angles, in order to get the correct hand positions, for example.  Separeately, although not what I was meaning at the time, I'd wager that the V-chisel and the gouge are single bevel chisels - they usually are in most sets.  The V-tool, because it's hard enough to sharpen as a single bevel, and there'd be very little advantage to having it double bevel (as well as even more tricky to sharpen).  The gouge - mostly for cheapness reasons - there's very few times you need an out-cannel gouge (single bevel on the outside of the curve), but they are much easier to sharpen and work very well for most purposes.  Double bevel gouges were historically more common - these days it's probably more common to have a pair (in-cannel and out-cannel), representing the way the tools have become cheaper.  (Although, given the cost still, it's not fair to call good carving tools 'cheap', by any means!).  There's still an argument for double bevel gouges, in terms of hand relief for flat work, although I've not converted any of mine like that as yet.  (I do know of one carver that has 4 gouges of the same size - in-cannel, out-cannel, double bevel and out-cannel bull nosed.  That is, however, excessive, and more about how he's got too many tools!)  [0]  I've a set of in-cannel gouges for making round (or roundish) mortices - one of these days I'll make a heart shaped box with them, which would be a good example of where they are needed.  For square morticing, I pick up my set of carpenters bevel edge chisels."

Woodcarving,3ansum,SpamEggsBaconAndSpam,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"general question... general answers.  you can work on it now, but as green wood (full of moisture) it will probably develop cracks/checks depending on how much of the full diameter of the log that you use.  Let it dry. Larger diameter will take longer. Moisture will escape from cut ends (across the grain) faster than from under bark. To make it dry more evenly you should coat the ends with a sealer: Latex paint works OK. I've seen folks use wax as well. If you have a dry shady place outside that would work best. It will probably still check (crack) but if you know where the cracks are you can work around it. hth."

Also don't be afraid to trawl ebay with that search term too.  Note that most of the tropical exotic woods are rather hard, and thus unless you're power carving, might take longer than you anticipate.  (I've recently acquired some african blackwood - Janka hardness of 3600 - nearly three times harder than oak!  It's â€¦ not quick!)  (Seperatly: Mahogany is an odd choice for jewellery work - it's a little on the soft side to stand up to the regular handling that jewellery gets - might work for a pendant perhaps, but I'm not sure how it would handle a bangle or similar.  Tigerwood is not a term I recognised, so did some goggling.

Woodcarving,38racn,Digitalizing,3,Sat Jun 6 03:32:00 2015 UTC,"That's an awesome find.  But I think you misunderstand how slip stones work.  Like sandpaper on wood, you start with a course grade and move up.  For instance, it appears your Mora has some nicks in it.  IMO, you need to get the edge of your blade perfectly uniform.  most likely you'll need to use sandpaper or a 600grit stone. Then get the bevel the way you want it.  Then move up the grits to get it razor sharp.   The courser grits are to make fixing your edge easier.  If you tried to remove nicks with an 8000 grit stone, you'd be at it all day.  So start with a course stone and work up.  Make sense?  Once it's razor sharp, strop it on leather for every ~10 mins of carving.  With luck, you'll only need to use the 8000 grit stone to tune it up every few hours or so."
Woodcarving,38racn,Parrot32,2,Sat Jun 6 03:58:16 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that the nicks are just a combination of a trick of the light and the particle board of my desk beneath it. I just got the knife today and after a close examination the bevel looks even. It could have also been fragments of paper from when I tested it to make sure it was razor sharp. The point could use a touch of work though as the point curls to the side a minuscule, but noticeable amount. I found a 1000 grit stone as well, would that be low enough to start with?"
Woodcarving,38racn,MachinatioVitae,2,Sat Jun 6 05:57:34 2015 UTC,"Since it's a new blade, yes, you can start with 1000 and work up from there. 1000 is pretty fine grit, I usually start with a 600 or 800 and go up from there."
Woodcarving,38racn,MachinatioVitae,2,Sat Jun 6 06:01:05 2015 UTC,"I think there was a 600 grit in his basement as well but I left it behind thinking I didn't need it, I might have to try and find that one too."

Woodcarving,38racn,CutBranch,2,Sat Jun 6 06:18:47 2015 UTC,"Well, if there are no nicks but a slight curl, I'd normally leave that be.  Each time you sharpen, you remove a bit of metal. So eventually, the curl should correct itself.   I think the goal is to be able to spot how much work needs to be done and choose your stone accordingly.  This will take a lot of practice.  I've been sharpening for almost 40 years and it's still a challenge.  With fine knives, I start with a finer grit than I estimate.  So if it looks like a 1000 job to me, I'll do 2000 and if that's not working go to 1000 then Work up.  Again, you're removing metal, so you don't want to be too aggressive with your grits.    In other words don't always start with 600 and work up.  Start with as fine a grit as you can - as long as it does the job.  PS 90% of my sharpening time is spent on a leather strop with some honing compound."

Woodcarving,38d5su,PastorJ7000,2,Wed Jun 3 13:39:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting this. I believe there was some talk not too long ago about whether or not a candle could be carved, so yes I think it is appropriate to post here.  What kind of tools did you use? I found clay sculpting ribbon tools to be slow but useful tools for candle carving."

Do you have your work posted somewhere?  My problem (with candle and wood) are the little white flakes that get stuck in the creases of edges.  What do you do about this?"
Woodcarving,38bpgc,PastorJ7000,2,Wed Jun 3 04:35:40 2015 UTC,"This piece came about because the lady who commissioned it happened to pass by the spirit tree I did a couple of projects ago that had an eagle on top of it . She told me that she stopped her car in the road and cried that day because the eagle was her daughter's spirit animal. Her daughter was the unfortunate victim of domestic violence. She left behind two kids that grew up to be stellar human beings, and this carving is supposed to be a tribute/memorial to her. The job entailed carving a majestic eagle clutching a flowing chain connected to an anchor with hearts on the points. I also had to incorporate an infinity symbol, a moon with two stars, and the initialism STV which stands for Silence The Violence, an organization dedicated to ending domestic violence. All of these elements hold a special meaning for this family and it was a true honor being chosen for such a meaningful project. Hopefully I did it justice. Peace and Love, people!"
Woodcarving,384zmu,Tildah,8,Mon Jun 1 22:07:55 2015 UTC,It's cute! My advice to you is to put it away for a day or two and not look at it. When you take it back out again it will either look (a) complete or (b) have some more obvious thing you should do to change it. I find that if I try and finish a project without a pause at this stage I tend to 'overcorrect' things that didn't actually really need fixing in the first place. Your mileage may vary. :)
Woodcarving,383fxv,ellthebag,2,Mon Jun 1 16:05:18 2015 UTC,"You can use pretty much anything to stain wood, particularly if it's a light colored wood.  The type of wood, type of dye, and method of application will all affect how well it will come out.  What you finish over it with will affect how long it will last.   Simple/cheap methods that come to mind are liquid food coloring or even sharpies, depending on how well you want it to look.  There are plenty of commercial options specifically made for dying wood, a quick search found this kit on Amazon which is cheap and has all of the colors you need:  http://smile.amazon.com/Wood-Dye-Aniline-Color-Powder/dp/B00BAKWTMQ  I have no experience with these dyes, just an example.  Whatever you decide on, I would definitely recommend some test pieces to see how well it's going to turn out before you work on your finish piece, particularly if it's going to come down to mixing colors (like blue and yellow to make green.)  Good luck, and make sure you post your results.  I know I for one would love to see it."
Woodcarving,383fxv,FortedWS,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"I have actually had some pretty good luck with rit dye in the past. I was in a similar boat, I wanted to do a red stain on my guitar and wasn't finding much, but I gave rit dye a shot. It's about $2 on amazon, and my local Walmart happened to sell them for about $1.50 each.   I used it to stain the guitar I was building and it came out looking great both before and after finishing. I just did a one part dye and three parts water mix and stained as normal, and then eventually put a couple coats of poly like normal."

Woodcarving,380650,Thisiswhyidontgoout,3,Sun May 31 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"That's a really difficult question to answer without knowing what sort of carving you want to do.  A set of tools and workspace to make spoons and bowls is pretty different from the tools/workspace you'd use for carousel animals, which is different from what you'd use for relief carving, which is different from ... etc.  If you've never carved before, I'd worry less about setting up a workspace and tooling up, than about trying some carving to see if I liked it.  For that, all you really need is a knife, a way to sharpen it, and a piece of wood to carve - basswood is good to start off with.  Add a chair to sit in, a kevlar glove and a thumb protector, and you're in business.    After that, what you need will really be dictated by what sort of carving you gravitate to."

Woodcarving,380650,marcovicx,3,Wed Jun 24 03:30:41 2015 UTC,"I've been carving about 34 years and I started with just a simple Case pocket knife.    If I had to start all over, I'm thinking that Case wasn't a bad way to go. It's the standard Case with 3 blades. The long one is what I used the most.  Carry it with you and watch some YouTube videos on how to sharpen it.    Get yourself a piece of scrap leather (craft shops sell this) and glue to a piece of scrap wood.  That will be your strop.  Get a small pocket Arkansas wet stone. Spend free time (in front of TV or whatever) practicing sharpening.  Having a razor sharp blade is 75% of the project.  Think of a painter who only had a paintbrush the size of a hand.  He can paint a wagon or a house, but he's not going to paint the Mona Lisa.  You too need a very sharp blade unless you are doing life size totem poles.    Basswood is a great way to start.  Many craft stores sell Basswood grab bags.    And what carving to start with?  Personally, I started with a simple duck.  Little did I know I'd still be carving Ducks. I don't recommend starting with animals that have toes. Or human faces.  Start with something that has smooth contours.  That will teach you so much on blade control and getting angles right.    But I believe the most important advice I could give you is as Abraham Maslow used to say: ""make a pile of chips.""  Meaning carve something, anything, and keep at it.  When you're done, you've learned a lot. Your next carving will be that much better."

Woodcarving,37lndg,PhDinBaloney,1 point,Sun May 31 02:01:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other poster on the Tormek.  But if you can't afford, think of using sand paper in this manner:   Start very course 80 grit if there is a lot of metal to be removed.  Don't stop with that grit until your angle and bevel are 98% where you want it.  Go up in grits until you are ready to polish.   Polish with leather until no scratches remain and you can shave paper."
Woodcarving,37gbmk,meteorfury,5,Wed May 27 12:36:39 2015 UTC,"For a lot of things you can get by on a drill and a coping saw as long as you have a bench to clamp the wood with.  Another start option is to see what dimension wood blanks you can find, and then carve a figure that requires little stock removal.  I like to do ball-in-a-ball carvings when I'm sitting on the patio or watching tv with my wife, and I just buy a pile of basswood that's already cut into cubes so I don't have to ever do any sawing for them at all."

You aren't going to get a big square block like that, but you may not need something so big if you're just starting out.

Woodcarving,37a6yy,Eggsquid,2,Tue May 26 08:47:11 2015 UTC,"Last summer while I was unemployed I started whittling quick letter openers out of the soft pine branches that were in my yard, whenever I would take my dog out. After making a few I had perfected my technique. Now whenever I get invited to a wedding, I make them a letter opener as a wedding gift.   I'll go to the wood store and get a nice looking hardwood blank, then take it home and shape it in the woodshop with a lathe and or belt sander, then do the fine detail with my pocket knife or a wood chisel. When I'm satisfied, I'll hang it and hit it with 2 or 3 coats of Rustoleum high gloss clear enamel. (the enamel is a superior finish to using a spray paint, it's tougher) I never oil them though. The enamel brings out the colors the same way the oil would, and I imagine oiling it before hand would just screw up the clear coat.   I give it to them before the wedding too. I deliver it with the line, ""You're going to have a lot of cards to open, so you might as well open my gift right now."" Everyone who has received one so far has loved them."

Woodcarving,378m55,Flairzor,3,Mon May 25 19:40:22 2015 UTC,"I always recommend an egg and then a spoon, or skip the egg and do a spoon.   A spoon is great because it teaches you convex and concave carving with a knife, and basic gouge work.   Follow that up with a bear or whale or a duck or something kind of basic, but 3D. There are a lot of tutorials for this kind of carving.   I would also recommend doing a wood spirit or chip relief carving to practice detail work.   All of these projects are simple but teach fundamentals of strokes, patience, and different techniques.   A chess set, which I actually haven't done myself yet, requires extreme patience, an understanding of 3D carving, detail work, and how to maneuver your tools. Remember that even if you plan to have different themes for each color, that's still two of every piece except the king and queen that need to mirror each other, and 8 pawns that you should be trying to carve identically.   Conversely, you can brute force your method. Just start with a pawn and carve pawn after pawn until you have a design you like and can consistently duplicate. Then maybe take the rook since its a relatively simple shape as well and start carving rook after rook. Keep doing this for each piece, because honestly, even if you do some other fundamental projects first you will be doing this anyway when it gets to be time to make your set.  A lot of art is about repetition and having the combined patience and insanity to do something terrible 100 times and still keep doing it.  I hope this doesn't scare you off, a real simple chess set of basic shapes is totally doable for a beginner, but if you expect to carve things like the results when you GIS ""carved chess sets"" off the bat, you will be disappointed. You can carve those things. You just have to be willing to put up with the discouraging first couple of lopsided spoons."
Woodcarving,378m55,daedalusesq,2,Tue May 26 05:04:50 2015 UTC,"Great information I really appreciate it! I think that I will first practice with basic things as you said: egg, spoon, animals.

Woodcarving,378m55,daedalusesq,2,Tue May 26 05:21:50 2015 UTC,Good luck! And don't be afraid to try a chess piece right after a few starter projects. We learn the most when we stretch ourselves and push our limits. When you try to apply the basics to a larger project it shows you pretty quickly which fundamentals you need to go back and work on.

The one on that bench has leather padding on the jaws, mostly to hold sticks or other things at a good height to carve while sitting on the horse.  The block on the bottom is also threaded (you can kind of see that on the far side), so that you can rotate the clamp 360 degrees, and tighten it at whatever angle you like...

I could lean over it and turn it or swivel it a bit to the right or left, which allowed me to use a knife or a gouge for detail work.  I've had back surgery recently and bending/hunching over my work isn't something I can do for long right now.

Woodcarving,36n69i,dino_silone,6,Wed May 20 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"Did you try the more traditional style of carving knife, and then discover the Mora?   Mora is the traditional type of carving knife.  At least, for some carving traditions - particularly Scandinavian.  I think that's the core of it, really; as you allude to at the end the different traditions tend to specialise in sightly different areas, hence different tools.  (Scandinavian carving is functional forms first, then embellished; rather than more figurative or abstract forms, such as the Continental European tradition [0]).  That's not to say it is inherently the best knife for you - it certainly sounds like you'd naturally tend to the smaller knives.  That's probably connected to the size (or detail level) that you tend to work at, I suspect.  Just want to add:    Morakniv 106 with the laminated blade, â€¦  universally recommended as the best all-around knife for carving here.   When I've recommend it, it's been as a first (or primary) knife; because I think that if you only have one, it's the best one to have, and that a second knife (typically smaller) would complement rather than replace.   I don't know if I get the point of having the edge on the curved, rather than the straight side of the blade.   I'm a little surprised at that, as there's a few specific cuts you can't really do without a curved blade.  I'm guessing you've never needed to do them (or worked out an alternative strategy to get the same effect).  Flattening the middle of a section is very difficult to do without the curve, for example (where you use the curve much as one would use the curved in a grounding gouge; keeping the bevel nearly touching in the centre of the belly, and thus keeping the point and edge near the handle off the work piece.)  For a push cut, where the hand holding the knife is advance towards the work piece during the cut, the mechanics of the belly are well demonstrated to produce higher cutting power than a straight blade.  It allows for the cutting edge to be places at an angle to workpiece when the cutting hand remains a constant distance away during the cut.  A straight knife can, of course do that - but the curve gives more options, which can result in a more comfortable hand position (hence: able to do more cutting in a single session).  And for a final example (although I'm sure there are more), the curve near the end is can be felt when cutting using a chest lever motion, and allows one to taper off the force before the knife would slide out the cut.  This allows more power to be deployed at the start, whilst reducing the risk of ending up with a flailing point at the end of the cut (unsafe, and clearly undesirable).  All of these are much more appropriate to starting from a log, and roughing out, than the finishing cuts [1].  The also matter more when doing 'tougher' cuts (either more stock removed, or in a harder wood.  Scandinavian tradition uses a lot of birch and maple; rather than lime (basswood), so perhaps that's a source of the origin of the shape preference).  I think your final point is pretty much the core of it; although I'd say different knives for different purposes, rather than for different carvers.  I've seen me switch around from all sorts of tools, depending on what I'm doing.  I'd certainly prefer a different knife over the 106 for kolrosing, for example.  That said, if I was only allowed one tool - er, I'd probably pick one of my smaller axes.  But it was only one knife, I'd defiantly pick the 106.  Probably tells you more about me than the knife, by this point I suspect!  [0] Which is chisel/gouge based, rather than knives; but I don't think that impacts for that point."
Woodcarving,36n69i,syntax,3,Wed May 20 20:27:19 2015 UTC,"I carve primarily with knives, though I do have a bunch of gouges and chisels as well.  I have a 106, but in the Mora line I prefer the 120 and 122 for carving myself.  That said, my favorite knives to carve with are the cheap folding, locking, Cold Steel Tuff Lite and Mini Tuff Lite (a mini is pictured here with the first rough ball-in-a-ball I ever carved):  http://i.imgur.com/2l04SZ1.jpg"
Woodcarving,36n69i,KhanMan15,3,Wed May 20 21:25:58 2015 UTC,"Wow - went out to do some errands, and got back to find a bunch of really great, thoughtful responses.  The carving school where I took lessons was very much in the Continental European tradition;  the first project used the knife, and from that point on it was all about bench carving with chisels, gouges and mallets.  I eventually discovered that I much preferred relief carving to carving in the round, simply because I didn't see well in 3-dimensions.  (I don't consider myself a talented artist or carver - I just do it for fun, and to ornament things.)    The exception has been that I do like to carve wood-spirit and other walking sticks/staffs, which, when you think about it, is a lot more like relief carving than it is like really carving in the round...  Sometimes I do that at the bench, and just use my bench tools.  But sometimes I like to just carve outdoors, in which case I've always used a combination of a small knife and palm chisels/gouges.  The idea of being able to do everything with just a knife is attractive, but I guess I never developed the skill to allow me to do that...  Anyway, I've really enjoyed reading others' perspectives.  Thanks!  I do need to get out of the habit of choking up on the Mora's blade and using it as if it were a small knife, though - if I keep that up, there WILL be blood... :)"

As a sealant you can use poly, oil, epoxy, there are plenty of options. Just look around online and see what those finishes look like and see for yourself."
Woodcarving,36ehm2,ohlooksomethingshiny,1 point,Tue May 19 16:27:57 2015 UTC,Is cedar particularly difficult or should i just practice on something before I screw up the good piece?
Woodcarving,36ehm2,syntax,3,Tue May 19 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"Cedar is a softwood; so it's not excessively difficult to cut.   It's hardness is right around that of Lime wood, so that's not a problem.  More of an issue is the way most softwoods have quite a distinct texture, between the late wood and the early wood (i.e. the lighter and darker parts of each growth ring).  It can often be the case that the force needed to cut the harder parts is too much for the softer parts.  You're best defence against this is really sharp tool - I've even seen some people regrind tools with a finer bevel angle (chisel at 20 degrees!) in order to get good cuts on some softwoods.   I don't know how extreme Atlas Cedar is in this respect.  I would recommend doing two carvings before starting on the cedar - first one in lime (basswood); and then another in pine.  I normally recommend to stay away from pine for beginners, but in this case I think it would be a good exercise - on the understanding that it appears that the cedar is slightly more uniform than most pines.  The cedar is likely to be somewhere in between those two; although all individual bits of wood will vary.  Watch out for knots, which will be much more difficult to carve.  Also, there may be some resin channels - I think atlas cedar only has them as a result of injuries, rather than in general.  However, it can gum up the tools, so maybe plan on keeping some white spirit (mineral spirits) and a cloth handy to clean things if you hit a resin pocket.  Cedar has a distinctive scent - if you coat it in a finish like epoxy or varnish, then it will mask that.  Also, most film caring finishes will general hide some of the finer detail in a carving - for a smooth object, that's not an issue, but it you were carving a face, or something equally detailed, that might be a problem.  A coat of paste wax is a very conventional finish for a carving - it protects an ornamental object well enough, doesn't affect the colour, and is easy to apply.  (Not so good for heavily handled object, however; so that might be an important trade off).  If you were thinking of making a utility object (cup, bowl, spoon, that sort of thing), then I'd generally suggest an oil finish - good waterproofing, food safe, and easy to repair.  However the cedar is likely to be a tad soft for that, and, for the same reason as the scent, is one of the easier woods to become allergic to, so it wouldn't be my first choice for a using object.  (Might do some very nice decorative spoons through - the curves in a weeping tree could lend themselves to curved handles very well, allowing a very thin looking object to be strong, as it would follow the grain of the wood.)"
Woodcarving,36ehm2,syntax,1 point,Wed May 20 09:11:03 2015 UTC,"Very informative, thank you. I will do some practice on various types of wood, I believe I have some pine.  There are tons of knots in the wood from all of the branches that were on it. Most are very small because these branches were trimmed young as the tree was being trained to grow. I think just below these small knots the wood should be uniform.  It will not be a utiliy object. It will just be for display purposes. If I have it indoors, I suppose I could refrain from doing a finish in order to allow the cedar to show off it's scent. I wonder if the wood would be in greater danger of rotting in this case?"

I wonder if the wood would be in greater danger of rotting in this case?   Note that the scent will fade over time.  I think people talk about sanding it once a year to keep the scent going.   I'm unsure if that's a good plan - but leaving it unfinished until the scent fades, then finishing the item might be a plan.  Cedar is used for roof shingle because it is highly resistant to rotting.  Also, indoors is too dry for an item to rot anyway  - there's a lot of not particularly rot resilient pine holding up my house, and it's doing fine after years.  I don't think you'll have to worry about the cedar rotting!"
Woodcarving,36ehm2,nsbound,1 point,Wed May 20 21:35:18 2015 UTC,Awesome. I'll probably do that. Leave it unfinished and figure out whether I want to put a finish on it down the road. Thanks

Carving is not about speed at all, and higher speed gives higher kickback!   You have to use as much force handling your tools as your tools are acting on the workpiece. A more powerful tool just brings more force that you have to control. A sharper edge will reduce the forces you need to control."

But I don't really believe it's the RPM of the unit that gives you kickback.  I believe it's the bit itself, and how sharp it is.  You can in theory get more use out of dull bits if you speed it up, but that's just masking the real issue."

But if you are just starting out, go ahead and grab some basswood planks if you can.   Otherwise sharp tools make all the difference. With sharp tools you should be able to push through pine as well as other wood. Also getting a little mallet will help you control your chisels, just remember to start out with tiny tap tapparoos."
Woodcarving,36b5r2,KhanMan15,2,Mon May 18 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"You've got the wrong wood.  Pine - just about any softwood, in fact, is difficult to carve.  Get some lime (basswood); and you'll find it carves much better.  To carve softwoods, you need really sharp tools - almost certainly you;'d have to regrind them with finer bevel angles too; as well as stropping them to high polish.  This is not a good way to begin; it requires a lot of skills up front before you can produce anything.  Lime wood is a lot easier to get started with - you'll still need to learn how to sharpen the tools, but the wood is that bit more forgiving.  It's also worth noting that when you cut with a v-chisel, one side will be a neat cut, and the other a rough finish - the trick is to cut in the correct direction, so that the wood you want to keep is the neat side."

If you can find sycamore that's green (not dried), it'll be a bit softer, and can be comparable to the lime.  You'll need to get some tools too.  I'd recommend getting a Frosts Mora 106 knife for a straight knife, and a crook (or spoon) knife for doing the bowl."

Woodcarving,35si7i,nwtools,4,Wed May 13 03:55:43 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if I could get away with it if I used one of those palm gougesâ€¦   Not really, you're just as well with a full size gouge.  That's counter intuitive, I accept; so let me explain.  The key part is: how do you stop the gouge from cutting too deep (if, say, it skids - you don't want to cut your other hand).  The way to do it - rather, how I do it, and it matches Willie Sundkvist's book; it to hold the gouge in the primary hand, with the thumb in the channel of the gouge.  The thumb should be near the tip - maybe a centimetre or so from the end.  Extend the first finger, and rest that on the piece to be cut.  The other fingers grip the blade.  This arrangement means that the total depth of cut is controlled (maximum is determined by the thumb position), and if the tool 'jumps', then the finger on the work piece prevents it flying into the off hand.  A palm gouge would let you apply more power - but it's control that matters more, not power.  (If power is important, then get a vice, or other work holding gear first.  That'll be the biggest improvement you could make).  Once you modify the grip for control, the advantages of the palm gouge aren't so evident.  I'd go with a crook knife - if you get one that's got a compound curve, it can cut difference sizes of spoon bowls; in a single tool.  Slightly more tricky to use, but not much more, and it gives you more options for your money.  Generally speaking they are better in softer woods - Lime (basswood), chestnut, soft maples, and cherry are decent woods.  They will also be foot to cut green.  Wood is softer when green (not dried), and that'd let you cut harder woods too, if you can source it.  I got some beech a while back, was very nice to cut some spoons out of with knives.  Now the rest of it is dry, it takes full on gouge and mallet to do much to it!"

If the spoons are really small, I can see where it may be easier to use a palm gouge or veiner just because they are available in very small sizes.  In the end, it is probably a matter of personal preference and practice."

Woodcarving,34romo,onthefailboat,2,Sun May 3 23:54:21 2015 UTC,"I've been working on an engagement ring.  I have the general shape carved out, nothing fancy, but I'm pretty proud of it so far.  It took me about three tries to get to this point.  I suppose the next step is sanding it to look nice and then adding a good finish to it.  I've made it this far and I really don't want to screw it up.  The wood is Bolivian rosewood, so it's not very tough.  Any thoughts on how to proceed?  Edit: Slightly different angle.  http://imgur.com/CLOSyrS"
Woodcarving,34romo,TheEndGrain,1 point,Sun May 3 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm getting some sturdier wood this summer, so this ring is kind of a temporary engagement ring and my first experiment into making rings.  I've been looking into sandwiching different kinds of wood together to make multicolored bands and I'd like to give that a shot over the summer."
Woodcarving,34romo,newmaninchrist,1 point,Mon May 4 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"Take some time to seriously rethink that wood choice. It's a reasonably hard wood (harder than most oaks and maples) but rosewoods, including Pau Ferro (or Bolivian Rosewood), are known to sometimes cause skin/eye irritation during working or usage. The right finish might preclude this, but it might not.   It may not have had an effect on you yet, but it may once you start producing dust during sanding (wear a mask if you continue to press on). Regardless, with continued wear, it may start to irritate your SO's skin. These types of woods are known ""sensitizers"", which in essence means that any adverse reactions to the wood are usually worsened with repeated exposure.   Just food for thought, and I don't mean to discourage the project. There are many similarly beautiful woods out there that you can use, and I'd recommend checking out [this very useful site](www.wood-database.com) when you're shopping around.   In response to the other person in this thread suggesting inlays, you'd likely find a jeweler's saw useful, but with the size and curvature of the project, it may be a lofty goal for a first-timer. A wood burning tool might offer a similar level of ornateness at a fraction of the effort/skill."
Woodcarving,34romo,newmaninchrist,1 point,Mon May 4 04:49:50 2015 UTC,"Oh wow.  I had no idea.  Thanks for that.  I'll have to look at what kind of wood I want to use for the finished project.

I'll have to take a careful look at what I should use."

Woodcarving,33iqp7,DenzelB,5,Wed Apr 22 21:12:20 2015 UTC,"It looks like you've started with a square block, and left the original sides present in the finished article.  There's nothing wrong with that; but the different cutting tools leave different surface finishes.  It is generally a good plan expect to have the only surface left be from the carving tools (knife probably, for this one?).  As well as equalising the surface finish, this also encourages a bit more blending between the different sides of the piece - which is a useful side effect for organic forms (like this elephant).  That looks like some sort of softwood?  If you get some lime (Basswood), you'll find that it's a lot nicer to carve.  Nothing says that softwoods can't be carved, but there is no doubt that lime is one of the best woods, and it really help skills to switch around different woods.  It's defiantly an elephant - hence the recognizability puts it way beyond my first attempts!"
Woodcarving,33iqp7,syntax,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:32:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!

Woodcarving,33iqp7,syntax,2,Thu Apr 23 13:04:18 2015 UTC,"I was not sure about removing more wood at the back, because I thought it would make the body too small in comparison to the head.   It wouldn't have to be much - perhaps a few hundred microns (a few thousands of an inch) â€¦ which is far finer than you can cut by hand!  Although, I wasn't meaning to recut this one - I agree the proportions are good here; more that it's something to plan for for future work.   I thought it was basswood actually, but I don't know a whole lot about wood, to be honest.   It could well be - what made me thing it was a softwood was the way the rings are fairly evident, and there is signs of wood compression, rather than cutting.  In retrospect, the grain pattern is quite possible for lime - I've seen a few bits with slightly more striking grain, although it's usually not quite so obvious.  (Might be a function of the lighting for the photo, of course).  If the wood is doing a bit of tear out; for lime that normally indicates that the tools cutting edge might need a little sharpening.  Looking again, I think the bits of tearout I'm seeing are on the original sides of the block, so perhaps it's just a special case of the principle above (cut all of the carving, to equalise the finish).  May have been a bit of a red herring there; sorry if I've complicated things unnecessarily there."

Fundementally, however, glue is stronger when it is thinner, not thicker.  You ideally want it a gentle friction fit, before you glue it.  Epoxy is a decent option.  You might want to consider a 'high temperature' epoxy.  Although epoxy can take boiling water temperatures fine, there is a chance that the handle will get hotter than that (e.g. if left over a ring that's on).  Probably not; I'd go with what I had to hand, and only get a high temperature one if it released with the heat."

I actually ordered basswood online to try it out once, I got pretty frustrated at the wood being too easy to dent and cut, so realise you will have to adjust your technique on different woods.   My tip is to keep your tools very sharp. Wear a finger guard. Always cut away from your body. Recognise grain direction and cut in that direction, or you will bleed a lot. Lastly have fun and experiment. Some cuts will have to be really creative and as this harder wood, your cuts will be smaller and take longer."

Woodcarving,32z7bp,ANTELOGI,3,Fri Apr 17 23:19:37 2015 UTC,"For big pieces like that, you need to find a lumber mill and hope they have something to sell, or find someone who's cutting down a tree and bring a piece to the lumber mill for them to cut.  If you use a chainsaw, it's going to come out looking like a chainsaw carving; they have a certain look to them. If you want a smoother look, you might look into chisels. But if you're talking about just removing the bulk of material before you get to fine work, then a chainsaw might be ok if you know what you're doing."
Woodcarving,32z7bp,similar__motion,2,Sat Apr 18 02:28:05 2015 UTC,A log could be a full scale bust pretty easily. Rough it out with a saw of sorts. Rotary tool to get some finer detail.
Woodcarving,32z7bp,rwaynick,2,Sat Apr 18 12:24:15 2015 UTC,"The big problem you have with 'going large' is that there is a limit to the level of detail you can put in any particular wood (e.g. Lime will take the finest detail; spruce is pretty poor at holding detail).  And most woods avaialbe in large chunks are not the same that hold detail.  Equally, for the finest detail, you need to take out the pith in the centre of the log (else it will split) - which at leasts half the size of the wood away.  With what's called 'chainsaw carving', logs are usually used unsplit.  This means that they will develop checks - however these are usually considered normal, and part of the character of the sculpture.  Very often the thickest that wood is planked to is 100mm (4 inches).  To get dried wood that is thicker than that, your looking at laminating a blank (i.e. glueing blocks together).  This is not too difficult, but there's a few things to get a solid joint - you need flat and smooth surfaces, and clamp them together.  This is a common technique with woodworking - most table tops are laminated, for example.  There's a few details about how to go about that (grain orientation etc) that you'd need to read up on; but it's not an unreasonable thing.  The downside to that is the difference between the blocks will be obvious.  If you were planning on painting (or, e.g. guilding), then that's not an issue, otherwise you need to consider that.  Sometimes it's more effective to laminate from many small blocks, to emphasise that aspect for effect - I'm sure your time at art school will suggest more options there than I can enumerateâ€¦  There's no hard and fast rules about roughing out.  Most chainsaws are built for green (wet) wood, not dried.  Doesn't mean they can't cut dried wood, just that you need to be alert to that.  You can also use a large gouge, axe, hand saw, band saw or many other tools.  Depends a lot on wood, available tools and work needed.  I've seen me rough out something, removing half the wood, using a 12mm gouge.  It was quick, because most of the work was a cut, then twist to cause the wood to split out along the grain.  Not all carvings will be so amenable.  Here's a useful example (not me, I wish I was one tenth this good!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oU5QOmd_RA    Christer laminates up a blank (with one part preshaped - probably on a bandsaw), then carves a roughly life sized face."
Woodcarving,32z7bp,syntax,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:11:05 2015 UTC,"Damn, you sound like you know what you're doing! Thank you for taking the time to write me these lengthy answers; it's all very helpful information for me.  I think I may end up doing the laminating method.  I got a huge chunk of redwood that's 6""x6""x8' and after that's all used up, I think I'll invest in some planks.  I think it would be interesting to carve something and have the piece be multiple grains and colors.  And that video is wonderful.  Woodcarving is just so soothing to do and watch somehow.  He's so very good.  My art school actually doesnt have a wood working/wood carving class, hence me being really glad to find this community.  One last question if I may - is the best way to sand small nooks and crannies a rotary tool of some sort?  Thank you again!"
Woodcarving,32z7bp,syntax,2,Sat Apr 18 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"Redwood isn't generally considered the best wood for carving - the late wood rings tend to be much harder than the earlywood, and thus you get a large variation in the hardness.  This makes it difficult to get a smooth cut without exceptionally sharp tools.  It's also on the softer side, so comprised rather than cuts, and is easy to ding.  Lime wood (basswood in North America) is generally considered the best carving wood.  It's what Chister was carving in that video.  It's got just about the best balance of hardness, ability to take fine detail, and cut cross grain.  If you can get some, give it a try - you'll be amazed how much a 'better' carver you are in it!   I think it would be interesting to carve something and have the piece be multiple grains and colors.   Be alert to wood movement.  Different woods will move different amounts in response to humidity - and if they are 'too different', then they will likely crack along the join.   One last question if I may - is the best way to sand small nooks and crannies a rotary tool of some sort?   Well â€¦ I don't sand, so perhaps not the best person to answer that.  I'm pretty sure that Christer didn't sand that face in the video either; although it's not clear (the no-sanding approach is clearer in some of his other videos).  With sharp tools, of the right shape, there is, in principle, no need to sand. In practice â€¦ it's more complicated.  Some woods (Pine is the common one where I live - redwood may well be) you can't get a good surface finish without sanding; other times you'd need so many tools (to get the right curves) that it would be prohibitive.  You can use a scraper to smooth wood.  A carpenter would call it a 'card scraper' (sometimes, inaccurately, a cabinet scraper); but once you observe that you can make them from an old saw (or a cheap pound shop one), and that they can be curved; then one can start making them to the needed curve on demand.  You can also have a precise angle on the - including square, so that can be handy.  I was using one earlier today to square up the inside of a carved box (about a 1 inch by 1/4 inch internal size, at 1/2 inch deep), where the squareness was a great asset - a rotary tool wouldn't have helped too much there, it was basically all corners.  There will be times when a rotary tool will be of great use - but I'm not really a power tool carver, so have less insight into that.  If you've used one before (working with plastics, or metal), then that will stand you in good stead; although note that wood is considered practically polished at 400 grit, so that adjusts the grit progression a bit.  Certainly, it's an approach I've heard about other use, that works for them; so if it seems like a good method to you, it's defiantly worth experimenting with.  The risk with sanding is that it can round over line you want sharp, and sharpen line you want soft - once you can allow for that, the usual rule of aesthetics applies - if it looks right, then it is right!"
Woodcarving,32wphx,swrgh,1 point,Fri Apr 17 10:07:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry my ignorance, but why is everyone carving spoons?"
Woodcarving,32wphx,onciblu,3,Fri Apr 17 14:03:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know about anyone else, but I do know that a spoon is an easy task to understand / learn / produce something; and a very hard task to master.  In this way, it is an excellent exercise.  It takes technical skills: Concave bowl, convex back; matching the wall thickness between them; symmetry (or, perhaps, deliberate a-symmetry); consistent thickness on the stem; cutting along and across the wood grain; and so on.  It also, for such a deceptively simple object, stretches the design side: there's lots of variables the can be tweaked.  Width of the bowl; depth of the bowl; angle between the handle and the bowl; thickness of the wall of the bowl; thickness and shape of the handle; mechanical strength of the join between the bowl and handle; and I'm sure others.  Lots of different trade off points there; without even considering explicitly decorative flourishes.  There's also some practical concerns: not many tools need; can use wood not suitable for many other purposes (e.g. branch wood; also wood the grew bent or with a join is actually better for some types of spoons than perfectly straight wood).  Also, making an object with a practical use is a thing that appeals to many.  I've carved a fair number, and there's only one that I think is actually a 'decent' spoon (and that was a simple cooking spoon).  All the rest have various design level flaws - which either means I'm rubbish at it, or that it's a rather deep design space.  I'm pinning my hopes on the latter."

Woodcarving,32nusf,Nellisir,3,Wed Apr 15 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to tentatively second that.  To get a better idea, we need to get a good look at the wood.  Planing a bit of the end grain, then wetting it would give a better idea.  I don't think it's beech - I can see the rings, but no sign of the medullary rays (brown in beech).  Lilac is semi-ring porus; beech isn't, so that will also help tell them apart.  If it is lilac, than I hope you're a gouge and mallet carver.  Lilac is reported to be hard - like, Olivewood, boxwood hard.  That's about twice the hardness of beech and oak!

That, plus the color, plus the location found (dump pile in park), really says lilac. (and old....)"
Woodcarving,32nusf,Nellisir,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:35:54 2015 UTC,Okay I have carved a small spoon so far (I just posted a pic on this sub). The wood isn't difficult to cut really. I was given a piece of elm recently and by comparison that is much harder to cut. So I'm thinking not lilac?
Woodcarving,32nusf,syntax,2,Wed Apr 15 23:31:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, well - possibly.  But remember that we're talking about the hardness when fully dry; and if that was freely cut (looks it), it'll still be green, and thus much easier to cut.  For example, green beech can be carved with a blunt penknife. Dry beech is very difficulty to cut with a knife at all (you have to take cuts about the thickness of a plane shaving, to it jams up).   (Dry beech is about twice as hard as dry elm.  Lilac is twice as hard as beech).  Elm isn't the hardest of woods - it's in a mid range group with sycamore, cherry and the chestnuts (and is the softer side of that group).  There's really not a lot of woods softer than elm - Lime and Sweet chestnut are the commonest of them.  If you can, getting a good look at the end grain will help a lot - all the candidates here look very different from the end.  You noted elsewhere that it has a nice smell - beech doesn't (it also has no taste, hence it's use for food prep).  Lilac has a characteristic sweet, floral smell.  Checking is a form of cracking, where the cracks run radially.  As wood dries it shrinks - and it shrinks differently in the three key directions: along the grain; radial (perpendicular to the growth rings - from the centre of the tree to the edge); and tangential to the growth rings.  That order is in generally increase degree of shrinkage.    Checking occurs a lot in lilac because lilac shrinks a lot tangential to the growth rings (10% or so, whereas most woods are nearer 6%); and it doesn't change as much radially.  So if not split, the forces build up, and cause the checking as the wood is pulled part."
Woodcarving,32nusf,RufusSaltus,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:34:47 2015 UTC,Fascinating. Thanks so much for all the information. You've all been really helpful. I appreciate it.
Woodcarving,32nusf,sabre21asdf,1 point,Thu Apr 16 08:41:50 2015 UTC,I cut down some lilacs in my back yard two summers ago and that was my immediate guess.  The bark is also right for lilac.
Woodcarving,32nusf,infopackrat,2,Fri Apr 24 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"American trees, but maybe it's in here. http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/specialcollections/forestry/hough/common.html"
Woodcarving,32nusf,Nellisir,2,Wed Apr 15 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"At first glance, it looks like possibly a type of cedar to me... Is there pitch or a distinct odor?  The red heart wood is very pronounced and can be one of the cedar family flags.  Take a slice to the botany dept of a close by college they could probably help."
Woodcarving,32nusf,Nellisir,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:33:55 2015 UTC,"There isn't any notable resin. It does smell quite nice though, quite sweet / fragrant."
Woodcarving,32nusf,Jethro_Spurn,2,Thu Apr 16 00:29:51 2015 UTC,"OK, I'm still going with lilac. I took some photos of one of my lilac pieces.  http://imgur.com/a/Z90Lh  Very white sapwood, purplish-pink heartwood. The spoon you carved was white (sapwood) and the branch is probably cut recently, both of which may make it softer."
Woodcarving,32nusf,Jethro_Spurn,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:54:34 2015 UTC,"That's a lovely piece of wood you have there. Perhaps it is lilac. Its nice to carve so I'm happy regardless just thought identifying would be fun.   Thanks very much for taking the time to have a look and post your pics.  Also if you receive a half written reply or comment from me, sorry, I'm on Mobile and it just disappeared off my screen. I am rubbish at reddit.   Thanks again  Edit: Do you mind explaining what you mean by ""checking"" is this a problem that may occur?  I'm a beginner and I'm afraid not at all well versed in terminology.  Cheers"
Woodcarving,32mhfo,pwaclo,2,Tue Apr 14 23:45:18 2015 UTC,"Woohoo!!  Nice video of one of reddit's own, Paulie Dubs!  Good to see you getting some recognition, bro!"

Enjoy it for now but don't let it go to your head--there will be many more front pages in your future."
Woodcarving,32k8y3,Nzefeldt,3,Tue Apr 14 13:47:33 2015 UTC,Is that spoon in space?
Woodcarving,32k8y3,modernbenoni,6,Tue Apr 14 17:06:44 2015 UTC,That spoon is on my black granite countertop.  But I suppose all spoons are in space in a way.

Woodcarving,32k8y3,--redbeard--,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:14:21 2015 UTC,Does the basswood make a strong enough spoon? I've always made mine from hardwoods assuming bass would be too soft.
Woodcarving,32k8y3,martinezjpg,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that basswood is a low density hardwood. Not sure if it will hold up over time. I wouldn't be devastated if it didn't. Anyone else know? It seems plenty strong in the narrow sections of the spoon, but ...?"
Woodcarving,32k8y3,martinezjpg,-1,Wed Apr 15 00:38:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, it's a little soft.  But spoons are made to be used, and made to wear out.  The great thing about them is you can always make another.  And it'll always be fun.    Try some different woods moving forward, and enjoy the more unique grain qualities that entails, but if you liked basswood, then make more in basswood too.  It's soft, but it doesn't matter.   Beautiful spoon.  Bravo!"

Woodcarving,32httx,ninj3rz,2,Mon Apr 13 22:32:33 2015 UTC,"Nice collection.  The tools in the last pic appear to actually be machinist scrapers.  I have a couple, they're good for smoothing, scraping, and very light planing cuts.  Also for defuzzing.  Those in the pic may or may not have been modified. They take and hold an edge well."
Woodcarving,32httx,infopackrat,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:46:15 2015 UTC,"Those are some serious carving tools.  I spotted some two cherries chip-carving knives (a very nice brand, should be excellent tools).  The last picture looks like a pair of burnishers or birdcage awls, though they could serve some other purpose."
Woodcarving,32httx,bobasaurus,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:51:26 2015 UTC,There's actually 5 of the cherries.
Woodcarving,32httx,bobasaurus,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:56:07 2015 UTC,"""Two Cherries"" is the brand name.  I believe they are sometimes called Hirsch as well.  Nice German tools."
