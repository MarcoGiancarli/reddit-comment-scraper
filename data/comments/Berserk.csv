Berserk,3e2huj,Shanard,5,Tue Jul 21 15:17:27 2015 UTC,"Yep. The central framing of that statue, sitting on a throne with a missing head, sure is suspicious given the origin of this city.   (if Falconia is built on the bones of Gaiseric's old capital).   This is all but confirmed at this point, with more than two different allusions to this being the case. Falconia appears to have been based on the remains of Gaiseric's old empire, along with the addition of all the Falcon shit."

Berserk,3e2huj,walterbennet,5,Tue Jul 21 13:38:47 2015 UTC,whoa did griffith order rakshasa to take out rickert?    Doubt it. We know Rakshas has been protective of Griffith in the past.    I also sort of figured that the bakiraka might try to ally themselves with griffith and not against him   Why? Silat was clear on where the Bakiraka stood back in Vol 33. He had his opportunity and turned it down.
Berserk,3e2huj,walterbennet,2,Tue Jul 21 13:50:00 2015 UTC,yeah that was before a city appeared out of thin air and griffith defeated a literal god of destruction. i'd be willing to switch sides at that point if my enemy was that OG. plus i'd say that it looked like rakshasa had been trying to instill doubt in them about serving the kushan so they would switch sides hence why he revealed to them that the emperor was a demon king.

So i have a few questions.... 1)was rakshasa once an assassin for the kushan empire in the past? 2)has it been stated that rakshasa is an apostle? I agree his abilities seem unnatural but then again so do the abilities of silat's two henchmen  I'm only on my second read through of the series, so I'm still a little new to the story but it is dope as tits.

Berserk,3e2huj,walterbennet,3,Tue Jul 21 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that Locus sees this as undermining Griffith's authority, and isn't too happy about having to reign in the consequence of the slap."

Berserk,3e2huj,MonkeyDDuffy,5,Tue Jul 21 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure they speak the same language, with some minor differences (similar to American English and British English)."

Watch the anime/movies (I personally enjoyed the movies more). Read another manga; one similar to Berserk that I love is Vagabond, however it is also still publishing (albeit with more consistency). Uhh... Go outside?"

I can't say I remember what the last chapter would've been a year ago, but the publications come monthly now and I think that it's much more consistent in story/development than Berserk is. Long story short, yes, I'd recommend picking it back up, but I myself read it real quickly, not in chunks as you say."

I'm not saying I'm Guts, I'm not saying I've faced exactly the same ordeals, but the pacing of the story, the things the mangaka wishes to focus on and the ideas he transmits to his characters: that, that is me.   At some point I actually got frightened because of how Miura describes a certain issue, which I also face in my life daily, truly, that issue is living. hehe.   I did notice that when I make observations on my life, many times my mind sets up characters and places from Berserk, sort of like playing a Chess game. And all this brings out a huge respect for Miura to me, so he can take 3 lifetimes to finish the story if he pleases.  I try not to despair while waiting for more ( I think it's only my third year knowing about it, so I am sure 20+ years readers have an iron will)."

It's a great skill to have in life, and you get to say you learned it waiting for one of the best stories ever told!  That does not change the fact that you still have to wait for a chapter. At some point, like after about 6 months I ""forget"" about it. Although you never truly forget the feeling of a new Berserk. It is better than getting a present on your birthday. It is about as good as being surprised with something you never thought you'd get in your life, but it's a bit better, cause it's a new Berserk chapter. Than the pain of waiting hits again.  However, after you go through a two year wait, nothing feels as long or painful as realizing you just might have to wait another two years. But you are also fine with it, cause you know it's going to be a FUCKING EPIC chapter.  Waiting will never be the same, cause you've waited for a new Berserk chapter. I mean it waiting will become a pass time of yours. Just know that it's for a good cause, a new Berserk chapter."

Berserk,3dyo49,Clawedd,3,Mon Jul 20 18:51:53 2015 UTC,I've thought about it for a bit and I think the panel on the left is a nice looking one. you can remove the characters you don't like but you basically have a nice collection of berserk without riding the edgy train too hard. even guts alone from this would not look too bad. sorry for the bad quality. took a screenshot with my phone but forgot to stop my light dimming app before but at least I directly included from which chapter and page it is :p what area do you want the tattoo to be?

Berserk,3dyo49,damnocles,2,Tue Jul 21 05:51:39 2015 UTC,Skull knight symbol on sheild is a really cool one. Other than that one I would consider Rakshas or maybe just his mask.

Get a tattoo of that jagged wolf that represents Guts' rage.    Those are some ideas I've thought about getting.

If the former, just find a good piece of Berserk art (for example, the cover art for the manga). If the latter, I have no recommendation as that is a personal matter. It could be a mix of the two. Or you could talk to your tattoo artist and they will help you come up with something.  Do you know where you want it? Something large or small? Do you want it easily seen or not? Or are you open to where depending on what you pick and how large it should be to get the best detail/quality of work?  Ask yourself how dedicated you are to Berserk.  I have some stuff I'm passionate about, doesn't mean I'll get tattoos of it. Not to say I don't have tattoos, I do.

Berserk,3dz131,Itachifan95,3,Mon Jul 20 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"It was one of the early reasons for doing Berserk Redux. The movies had a great loot and did a lot right, but the omission of the Bonfire of Dreams, the early characterization of the Hawks, Casca's backstory in the cave, the Queen and Foss plot, and Guts time away from the Hawks really diluted the story into a big action romp.  Luckily, where one source dropped the ball, the other usually picked it up and it made the fan edit fairly strait forward. Plus the actors voices were consistent.  It's not a 1:1 of the manga as some parts from the manga aren't covered in either source and others from the books are redundant information that could be cut (such as Julius whining that his plot failed to the assassin).  But I feel like it's the most complete animated version out there."

The director, Miyazaki Hidetaki is probably nr. 1 Berserk fan in the world (to the degree that he has outright admitted that the ""sword arts"" (alternate slash positions)  in the upcoming game for greatswords are meant to make you ""move like Guts"") and the influences are visible throughout the entire game.  The games are the epitome of dark fantasy atmosphere in videogames. The atmosphere is the best part, along with the way the lore is relayed; there is no exposition, no idiots spouting half the story to you. everything is in the world, in item descriptions, visual cues. Confusing at first, but amazing once you realize how detailed it actually is.  But as many people here said, Dark Souls is often called ""a game for Klingons"" because it has difficulty shaped like a skyscrapers and is also the epitome of a ""git gud"" game, meaning that once you take time to master the game mechanics (especially parry), and analyze your opponements as opposed to rushing and hoping for the best, it becomes relatively easy.  But for you its probably just a non-stop masochism simulator, so i recommend against it.  Plus, i read below that you only own a mac book, and DS1 is notorious for being a shit port, to the point where there is an area that makes even my game pc struggle"
Berserk,3dwflw,colers,7,Tue Jul 21 13:47:22 2015 UTC,"My interaction with berserk began in 2009. I watched the first episode of the anime and thought ""Boy, that was stupid."" (REMINDER: if you introduce anyone to berserk through the anime, skip the first episode)   Later in 2011 some forum post prompted me to go back and watch the rest. I did, and was totally heartbroken by the final episode and thought ""Holy shit, I never want to experience that again"".  Then in 2012 I played Dark Souls, and through the forums I saw people saying how close it was to berserk. That prompted me to read the manga to see what the fuss was all about. And holy shit the Eclipse was almost as much suffering the second time around, but the depth of the manga is what brought me to this subreddit.  So you could say the souls games definitely brought me to this subreddit, and maybe to berserk."

Watched the anime, the movies, and then read the manga. Now it's probably one of my favorite series of media I've ever consumed.  It's kind of funny, I used to be a total Japanophobe, I thought pretty much anything to come outta Japan would be weird and fucked up. But I checked out a couple animes, realized that I was wrong and started consuming as much as I could.  And whaddya know, Berserk is mad weird and fucked up, but still rad as hell."

I enjoyed Berserker a lot but didn't find anything particulary unique or diferent from what I've already seen in western dark fantasy literature. Souls series definitely have some references to Berserk, but like Berserk itself it is greatly influenced by western (dark) fantasy and things which reference to something unique to Berserk and not general dark fantasy tropes are very few."

Berserk,3dxqvm,Lovoskea,11,Mon Jul 20 12:08:22 2015 UTC,"I never really looked at the God Hand in terms of fighting ability (they're probably incredibly powerful fighters), but more as the manifestation of an idea.  Ubik was the person who convinced Griffith to sacrifice everyone, through the use of manipulation and coercion. He is basically the face of lying, deception, and trickery of any kind. Any kind of falsehood in the world could be tied back to him in some way.  Conrad is the manifestation of the unnatural and morbid/disease. Things that are relatively beyond the control of people, such as plague, aging, death and suffering are his domain.  The other God Hand also seem to have their own manifestation of ideas (Void - ideology, beliefs/ Slan - lust, envy, jealousy/Femto - ambition, revenge, ruthlessness). And all of this is to communicate what the Idea of Evil symbolizes (all of the above).  So yeah, they could probably fuck someone up in a fight."
Berserk,3dxqvm,digbick117,5,Mon Jul 20 13:51:53 2015 UTC,"Conrad can spread disease, and Ubik is a master deceiver, and I think all members of the god hand can manipulate time and space."
Berserk,3dxqvm,MrOutrageousJon,3,Mon Jul 20 12:31:08 2015 UTC,I don't see the God Hand picking up a sword like Guts or Zodd and fighting that way.  You have a lot left with the manga to get through and you will see some of them in action in other ways as the story continues.  I think of the God Hand as not needing weapons or the skill to use them because their supernatural powers are way more effective then something like a sword.  Think of them like Yoda.  He doesn't need a light saber or physical strength because he can destroy his enemies with just the force.(forget the prequels)
Berserk,3dxqvm,psalt,2,Mon Jul 20 14:10:23 2015 UTC,Miura stated that Ubik equals the strength of The Undertaker and Conrad equals the strength of Baxter Stockman.

Most christians take the bible as their main source of faith (and inspiration), but of course this is just a huge mess considering all the time that passed, translations and reinterpretations made over ages.   I would also point out, without looking into it too deeply, that Buddhism has ""Five Main Poisons"" (Kleshas) : Ignorance, Attachment, Aversion, Pride and Envy.  While Guts is talking to Slan in the Qliphoth she also says something like ""The other members of the GodHand are basking with their favorite sin"" (would have to seriously doble-check this, as I believe she never meant ""sin"")."

And following the good old dark souls rule ""kill the dogs first"" guts would probably kill Sig in one blow and continue fighting arty normally. Sig would be a problem for arty because he would have to keep him safe and instead of going full out he would be watching nonstop out to save his favourite puppy)  Edit: now that I think about it round 1 would propably still be a win for guts.

If you really want to keep with the theme of Berserk, whichever player has the behelit should be protected from player death.  You as GM could modify damage rolls against him when he is near death so that he never quite dies.  And if he ever loses it or it is stolen, it eventually finds its way back to him."
Berserk,3duj2c,almenslv,3,Sun Jul 19 17:44:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe one of the ways it can activate is have the Behelit activate after the player is really close to death, to the point of psychical handicap after getting destroyed"
Berserk,3duj2c,Pleasantchimera,2,Sun Jul 19 22:40:39 2015 UTC,"i like that, you could also have the players choose a dream like a personal quest.

Berserk,3duj2c,almenslv,0,Sun Jul 19 22:56:04 2015 UTC,"I would not do that. If the 'chosen' player dies, have it pass on to someone else, either because they looted it, or it found itself there.  Alternatively, the pc does die, player makes a new dude, and some force rezzes that character, then tortures him/her for 5 years or so, either known or unknown to the party.  In any case never 'fudge' to keep someone alive. If you want to keep someone alive design your encounters to do that. Even then, you will be amazed at how often people basically commit suicide."

Berserk,3duj2c,damnocles,4,Sun Jul 19 17:54:03 2015 UTC,"One thing I always say when something like this comes up is: talk to your players. They should all know what they're getting into, the person being targeted especially. You might lose the surprise factor of whats coming (though not if they recognized what the behelit is) but you don't want to subject someone to a change like that, or a party to the Eclipse, without them being willing to play it out. After that it becomes letting them roleplay as they see fit, and trying to curb metagaming if they know whats coming."
Berserk,3duj2c,GuardianSK96,3,Mon Jul 20 00:08:54 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Though, if you're gonna TPK everyone except the behelit user it should come at the end of the campaign.  Have the next campaign be about taking down the new apostle."

Berserk,3duj2c,wool_pace,2,Sun Jul 19 20:27:36 2015 UTC,Well I'm thinking that I could spare a couple PCs from the Eclipse and they could swear vengeance upon the Godhand for what he did.   They could even have the brand and everything just to make things suckier.
Berserk,3duj2c,crookedparadigm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"I've always wanted to write a campaign that uses a lot of the themes in the Berserk world (behelits, apostles, struggles against fate), but without the specific plot. Enemies like the God Hand would be difficult to work into DnD except as possible Deities though."
Berserk,3dvt4g,RMP321,6,Sun Jul 19 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"Well the translations that come out now are pretty good I think, but as for the legality part I think you'll have to wait until a full volume is completed, released and translated for US release(or wherever you may be buying from). Someone can correct me if I am wrong."

Berserk,3dvt4g,VolatileCurry,3,Sun Jul 19 23:26:57 2015 UTC,"You're not going to get a legit, professional translation of new episodes. You would have to wait until a volume comes out, which happens first in Japan, then in America some months later. At this rate, it'll be a year or more before that happens.   Evil-Genius does a good job on their translations. I read the new stuff by them ASAP and then buy the volume when Dark Horse releases it."

Favourite anime of all time has to be Steins;Gate.  C: Control: The Money and Soul of Possibility and Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple both had absolutely fan-fucking-tastic character development, but rather lackluster story.  Code Geass and Death Note were fantastic. Trying to predict what was going to happen was like playing chess with the shows themselves.  Spice and Wolf had both great characters/development AND a good story (though it has a rather inconclusive ending. Need to read the light novels or manga.)  Deadman Wonderland was just good.  And the Incursio thing you were talking about is ""Akame ga Kill"". Another great series, though the amount of references and how similar the references are to the originals was bordering plagiarism"

JoJo's bump up from Berserk has to do with its manga having more consistent releases of chapters. As well as its adaptation being EXTRAORDINARILY faithful to its source material, even more so than Berserk's anime.

Also, here is a little more about the actual Kabbalah influence on Berserk (Kabbalah philosophy/cosmology/religion/other term being where Qliphoth comes from.)  Interesting stuff without even reading into how it influenced Berserk. Go read! Shoutout to /u/conclusioncycle for writing it."
Berserk,3dtv96,Almighty_Elephant,4,Sun Jul 19 13:46:31 2015 UTC,I'd  say (kliff-off)
Berserk,3dtv96,gattusu,4,Sun Jul 19 12:40:43 2015 UTC,I was thinking this but with a th sound at the end. Or a T sound. So Kliffoth or Kliffot
Berserk,3dtv96,mikachuu,3,Sun Jul 19 12:44:11 2015 UTC,"Qliphoth shows up in Tales of the Abyss, and it's pronounced ""kliff-oth"" in there. That's how I've said it."
Berserk,3dtv96,SerioC,3,Sun Jul 19 23:28:09 2015 UTC,"Well it's an actual word meaning ""Shell"" from Kabbalah mysticism and pronounced something like [QUIL-FOTH]. But hey, pronounce it how you like."

Berserk,3dseft,MechaGoldFish,9,Sun Jul 19 00:23:38 2015 UTC,I believe Schierke once said there were different realms that souls passed on to based on their individual karma or something like that.

Berserk,3dseft,Izzy1UP,5,Sun Jul 19 04:41:20 2015 UTC,"Going off what Schierke and Flora say is all we got, nobody else really explains it.   Anyone involved with the Godhand is doomed to the Abyss, whether by suffering and hate, or the curse of the Brand.  Those who die naturally are separated from their material body and left in their astral form. From what Schierke explains about the Qliphoth, we find out that people astral bodies migrate to the realm that ""matches"" them best.   Flora explains it all a little earlier"
Berserk,3dseft,IAmMadeOfNope,2,Sun Jul 19 06:44:02 2015 UTC,"Well currently our guess is as good as yours... This could be said about a lot of things in Berserk series. I believe that once a human dies (non-branded) they just sleep the ""endless sleep"" like an atheists would believe. Or they become part of some peaceful spirit world where they roam mindlessly forever. I understood that branded humans souls/spirits (and apostles) are now possessed by the Abyss where they flow for eternity in endless torment amongst the other branded souls.  Or maybe this Abyss is the ""endless sleep"" ? We don't know man. But this was just my own opinion.."
Berserk,3dseft,PepeTheBranded,5,Sun Jul 19 05:13:23 2015 UTC,"Nope, Flora explained it.   Branded and people marked by the Godhand go to the Abyss and suffer forever.  Regular peeps just go to the a myriad of other places that we haven't seen yet.   Volume 24 page 97-100 ;)"
Berserk,3dseft,IAmMadeOfNope,6,Sun Jul 19 06:46:13 2015 UTC,"So having said that, recent chapter developments bring into light another question then. What happens to the spirits or souls that griffith has been "" sending off"" and manipulating in his lil david blaine street shows"

All we know of is the Vortex of Souls, which basically seems to Berserk's interpretation of Hell.
