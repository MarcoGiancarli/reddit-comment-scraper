rantgrumps,3e4lnn,SpazzyBaby,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:25:48 2015 UTC,"Combat was a complete shit on the old Bioshock games. Instead of being slow, and calculated, it was instead a normal, generic shoot 'em up.  Vigors were pretty much pointless, shooting was, undoubtedly, the best way to go. And even when you did unlock new vigors, you wouldn't take the time to use them, as you were already upgraded with another vigor and it'd be pointless to try a new one.  New weapons were also useless because of the upgrade system.  Story was mind numbingly drawn out for no reason imo, and just... ugh, just about the worst thing about this game.  The big 'twist' in the game was kinda mind blowing the first time through, and I don't have a real issue with that... but as soon as the whole 'dimension changing' thing is explored, the story becomes kind of pointless.  They could easily just leave the dimension that they're in multiple times. Elizabeth could easily get herself out of so many issues.  You destroy a siphon at the end of the game, which unleashes her power and makes her a god... but you destroy a siphon at the beginning of the game... which is seemingly the same thing? But she's not made a god then.  Just a whole lot of plotholes and shit.  And then there was a section where the Vox Populi, a civil rights activist group were turned into bad guys for the sole reason of having different skinned enemies to fight. No other reason. You pointlessly change dimensions and fight them just because. I don't remember any real reason for this, story wise.  And for some bonus points, the game sets itself up as some edgy world, with real, living issues (like the racism), and you expect it to explore this and other things more throughout the game... and aside from a couple audio logs (which are appreciated), it just doesn't.  Also pointless illusion of choice throughout the game.  Fuck. I really hate that game. I've played it through maybe 2 times, and then watched someone else's playthrough to see if I could understand what was good about it... no luck.  I haven't played the game in maybe a year or two, so maybe my outlook will have changed if I played again. I'm also sure that I had more arguments against it. Can't really remember them, however.  tl;dr combat isn't great. story isn't great. sours the experience.  edit: Not to say that there isn't anything good about the game.  I love Elizabeth.  The tear system is used awesomely in combat.  The different enemy types (while it could vary more) are pretty cool.  Graphics are great, sound design is tight, controls are responsive.  Skyhook is awesome.  Setting is amazing."
rantgrumps,3e4lnn,TheValkuma,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:55:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, I wasn't expecting that much of a response. I can agree with you on vigors mostly, though. There were some that I barely every used (specifically the one with the crows) because they were rarely the best option in combat. Shock Jockey was always my go-to.  I have to disagree with you on some of that, though. Specifically on the Vox Populi and the illusion of choice. I think the point of them becoming antagonists was to show the consequences of a violent revolution, and how leaders can become corrupted. Daisy Fitzroy is fighting for the ""right"" side, but she's doing it in a wholly immoral way. As I recall, the reason they come after you is that Booker had died in that universe, so Daisy was convinced that you were an imposter. It also fits into the whole idea that there are so many different realities that are vastly different. In this one, the Vox Populi were antagonists because it stands to reason that there has to be some realities where that happens.  As for the illusion of choice, I think it's very much the opposite of pointless. Yes, it doesn't actually change the gameplay in any way, but that's because it was a thematic choice. The twins are always going on about constants and variables, basically saying that while Booker may be able to change some things, there are others that are unavoidable and must always happen. For example, when given the choice between heads or tails, you can choose whatever you want. That doesn't change the fact, however, that it will always end up heads. This builds up to Elizabeth changing the one thing that's always been constant: Booker can choose to get baptised or choose to walk away, but he always survived it. By changing that, Elizabeth changes everything. I actually really liked the illusion of choice it gives you, because it ties in with the story quite well.  Not sure what to say about them leaving their reality at any point, though. Elizabeth could barely control her power for most of the game, and they were trying to escape Columbia and go to their own lives in their own reality, I think.   I'm not sure what you're talking about with the siphon at the beginning of the game, though. You'd have to jog my memory."

The clipping shouldn't be there, true, and it's fixed in later releases of the game. There are a lot of excuses to be made, like SEGA's economical downfall, hasty ports due to fast changes in gaming industry, developers not having a good grasp of developing for Dreamcast let alone porting to GameCube FROM Dreamcast...   Sonic Adventure is not a great game, it's an excusable game. Part of the reason why what Arin's doing is not cool is because of that. It is no different than kicking and laughing at a 3-legged puppy. It's a low blow."
rantgrumps,3e4lnn,choosingusernames,4,Wed Jul 22 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's more on the animation during cut scenes that makes the game look bad, but that's beside the point. I think if he played the game without attempting to find bugs, it would be fine to laugh at those things that happen over the course of a normal playthrough. For instance, the walk cycle while he holds the wind key looks ridiculous at the speeds he's going, so that's fine to joke about. But repeatedly slowing down during speed sections to die or doing something a player obviously isn't supposed to do to glitch it? That's not ok."

rantgrumps,3e2jns,SuperSushiFighter,5,Tue Jul 21 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. On other notes the Adventure Series I noticed has gotten a large amount of negativity in general since Sonic Boom has come out.  I feel as Sonic Boom was a breaking point for many Sonic fans where they started being overly frustrated and just missed the times of 2D Sonic when it was perfect and the fandom wasn't bad.  Sonic Adventure doesn't age well, same could be said for Crash Bandicoot or Rayman 2, but of course their age flaws don't ruin the game. I remember back before Sonic Boom and people believed the games were back on track, people were more positive with the series, even some of the cruddier titles."

rantgrumps,3e2jns,SuperSushiFighter,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:58 2015 UTC,Yeah. I wish they played those in the Jon Era because of Jon's love for that genre.  Of course maybe Ross and Barry playing it on Grumpcade would be fun to watch.

rantgrumps,3e2jns,burkey0307,2,Tue Jul 21 22:28:16 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the last point. A game shouldn't force a player to play a certain way and then bug out if they dare to explore and try to do everything in each stage.   What's even the point of putting collectibles and enemies everywhere if you're just supposed to ignore it for the sake of speedrunning? Seems like bad game design.   I could be wrong, but I feel like the 2D sonics actually were about exploring and not just going fast. If you tried going fast in 2D sonics you'd usually hit spikes and get hurt, and miss all the secrets."
rantgrumps,3e2jns,necroneechan,2,Tue Jul 21 23:13:35 2015 UTC,"Keep on mind that this is the first legit 3D Sonic game to come in the market. The first two Sonic stages are very straightforward and to show the speed of the game, and you'll see as he progresses (If does) the stages gets complex enough to interact with enemies or the stage itself (As you'll see in the incoming one) to reach different routes.  Except for Knuckles there's zero collectibles in the stages, and except the 100 Ring challenge there's no point on getting every single ring aside of avoiding damage unless you wanna go to the Chao garden. The real collectibles (Emblems and Upgrades) are in the overworld, and there's no hazard on them to worry about."

It's personal, childish, stupid, and right down Arin's goddamn alley.  Has nothing to do with game being good or bad, since he's gonna shit on every single Sonic game there is. He shat on Sonic 1 for having slow platforming puzzles in later levels, he shat on Sonic 3 for god knows how long in the series while everyone else was having fun, he shat on Generations for being linear and now he's shitting on this game by trying to clip through every fence he's seeing. No Sonic game will satisfy his dipshit demeanor unless it's made by Shigeru Miyamoto and all the members of the band Tool. Fuck it."

He eventually gained ground  by tirelessly acting like an idiot, which wore thin really quickly.  All that aside, Ross has really grown into his role as a Let's Player. He knows how to keep an episode rolling and is almost effortlessly entertaining most of the time (even if he crosses the line into obnoxious territory on a more frequent basis than other Grumps.) The most appealing thing about him, though, is his enthusiasm. He's not jaded by the business like Arin, and unlike Dan, video games are clearly a central part of his life and he's passionate about them. He's also just a really solid dude in real life who has awesome work ethic.  I never expected Ross to wind up being the best Grump to ever Grump, but he pulled it off."

It just makes him seem more relatable and down-to-earth. Even during Jon Grumps he showed up to talk to people and he seemed like such a cool and friendly guy that even though I was sad Jon left, I was happy he became a part of the show. I think that is a big part of why he is so likable."
rantgrumps,3e1wy6,Emperor-Nero,2,Tue Jul 21 13:46:13 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is that he's the most open about how much he hates being on the show. That's an exaggeration, but in a lot of the recent Steamcade episodes you really feel how bitter and cycnical he is about being stuck playing video games instead of animating. That might sound like a bad thing, but honestly, I think a lot of his frustrations come from the same place as the fans. He truly wants to make more of his own content, and even with all his stories of being a dick at cons, he's still willing to talk to people, opposed to, say, Arin, who hasn't made a new anything, and every interaction he makes ranges between low effort and annoyance."

Edit: I even asked him his real opinions on it and it was not good he was upset that outside US viewers could not see it and that you had to pay for it when it is normally free content for the masses. He talked to me as a person not a fan,but a fellow human being and that made me gain so much respect for him as a person."

I also believe that it's more than reasonable to blame a Grump (+ Kevin & Suzy) for something they're doing ""wrong"". This place is quite possibly the best place to check at times, though I highly doubt they would ever do so, of course, hahah. Everyone (community + hosts) has done or is doing something ""wrong"".  The issue for the community lies in correcting it. Going about fixing a ""suck up to daddy/mommy"" mentality is about as easy as making repairs to a car with half the necessary parts and no manual, while you don't know how to repair it without one.

I never really loved NSP's work and whenever I bring it up people seem to think I'm insane. Most of their lyrics aren't that clever. If I'm being completely honest, a lot of them are uninspired and juvenile, and not in the good way either. I'll cross post a comment I made in a previous thread a while ago:  ""Good vocals, average lyrics, mediocre production, bad song writing and terrible mixing. Admittedly the production and mixing could be fixed with a bigger budget but the other points can't be changed with more money.    Dan is a good vocalist. He isn't incredible or outstanding or anything, but he is probably in the top 30% of singers out there (give or take 10%).  I get that the whole sex thing is their schtick but it does get grating after about the thirtieth lyric about penises. Not exactly creative songwriting. FYI I Wanna F Your A is probably their best song lyrically. The mediocre production quality just comes down to money. I appreciate NB for using analogue synths in his music but at the end of the day, there's only so many sounds one synth can produce (and holy fuck are they expensive). Regardless, this brings down the band a couple of notches because a lot of their songs sound the same. This point could fall under lyrics and songwriting too but I feel the instruments they use are more at fault here. Ninja Sex Party's songwriting is bad, straight up. Melodically speaking, it's extremely generic. The melodies are uninspired, the chords are overused as all hell and the harmonies that Dan does in almost every single song make it sound like I'm listening to the same track over and over again. Their best song in terms of songwriting is, in my opinion, is 'FYI I Wanna F Your A' again. I know for a fact the mixing is atrocious on Starbomb's albums, but it'd be unfair for me to comment on NSP's mixing as a whole because I haven't listened to all of their tracks. This point also doesn't carry as much weight as the others because it could easily be fixed with a bigger budget.    That being said I do like a few of NSP's songs, but I really do dislike most of them.""

I don't know, is it a problem on Dan? Can he just not sing differently?

Mainly because they had Arin and Barry in there, and it already felt like NSP was just a branch of Game Grumps by the videos, and now the songs themselves give off that vibe."
rantgrumps,3e1qqj,monotar,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:04 2015 UTC,I liked it because I like NSP. It's a very juvenile band but I would be lying if I said it doesn't make me laugh. The lack of new songs didn't really bother me. The only problem I have with NSP is that it seems like Arin is invading into it too much.

I think it's funny how a lot of people seem to be of one mind with Avi. ""6969 was your best work yet. On the OTHER hand, ehhhh Samurai Abstinence Patrol sounds too much like Starbomb.""  Apparently Dan's response to that is just ""Oh, one of my band's songs sounds like another band I'm in? Wow."" Which is fair, I guess. It was bound to happen eventually."
rantgrumps,3e1qqj,BlueThunderBomb,2,Wed Jul 22 02:58:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty happy with it.  Better production in this album than any of the other ones, in my opinion, decent mastering, pretty good hooks.  Strawberries and Cream is probably still better because the greatest songs there are fucking amazing and better than the greatest songs here, but most of the songs off this album are really great.  Party of Three and Roadtrip are notable, great mentions, along with Peppermint Creams, SAP, Why I Cry, and 6969 (which I have to talk about later).   Party of Three production wise was very jazzy and the vocals were pretty smooth. I also thought it was a pretty funny topic.  Roadtrip sound-wise is great; I love the whole summer vibe theme that the song has, and it's very fun to listen to. The puns are great, and the hook is awesome.  Peppermint Creams was hilarious by the first time that I had heard it. And it was theme-wise very different than a lot of the others. I appreciated it a lot.  Why I Cry was also one of the ones that were theme wise very different than anything else that they had done (theme-wise meaning the genre of music, specifically). The hook was great, too, and his voice is... just beautiful. Pretty funny, as well.  SAP... many people here don't like it, and maybe it's just the nigga in me that loves to hear a nice beat and dope flow and bars. And although the beat wasn't the freshest and the bars weren't the greatest, it was pretty awesome for me. I really liked this beat more than anything on Starbomb (although Mortal Kombat High and Metal Gear Solid were pretty good ones). and hearing Danny rap. The hook was great, too, in my opinion. Only thing, mastering was pretty off here.  The joke songs here weren't bad. Dubstep was a letdown. Buttsex Goldilocks was hilarious. Cookies! was even more hilarious and I wish it was an actual song, it was pretty great.  6969 is... possibly the best NSP song made. If not, most definitely the most ambitious. It's one of the only songs that get me actually bumping. Apparently it's broken into 7 parts; the first part starts off pretty great, but then gets kinda weird for me to listen to. Gets good at the end though.  Part 2 is a nice, calm, unfiltered demonstration of Danny's smooth voice. It's pretty great, and doesn't wear its welcome.  Part 3 was great to hear Steel Panther unleash some goodness on the track. And the back and forth was pretty cool. I really liked the story telling here, especially. The bizarreness of the topic really got to me here, haha.  Part 4 is just... so amazing. It makes me dance, move, everything. It sounds beautiful, smooth, and when the beat comes in... jesus christ. His vocals are so beautiful here. I love this part of the song so much. Part 5 is flows perfectly from Part 4, and is pretty much the same thing. Flawless, imho.  Part 6 is a callback to part 3 with the back and forth. More storytelling. He kills Brian--- yeet, Brian fucking murders them all. That actually got me, haha.  Part 7 was a really good feel good part of the song for me, and a great conclusion to the adventure, and this pointless breakdown.  I feel like this is probably the best NSP song ever, and really puts the album up there, in my opinion.  All in all, great album.  tl;dr I actually really liked the album, and 6969 was a masterpiece imo."

Sonic Boom, does not give you any challenge or anything interesting, even if you go out of your way to explore.  Sonic DX, as shitty the port as it might be, IS in fact playable, just not flawless. Nostalgia factor is apparent, sure, but if you think that game's shit factor is comparable to Sonic 06 or Boom, you're either misinformed-unexperienced or purposefully grinding gears.

Would you mind explaining this to me?   ...but if you think that game's shit factor is comparable to Sonic 06 or Boom, you're either misinformed-unexperienced    I'd beg to differ.

Couple that up with Sonic DX being the FIRST of its craft and doing the BEST it can to hold up, you might realize it's very unfair.   I don't think that's unfair in the slightest. If they're playing the game now they should criticise the game as they see it now. Just because it's the ""first of its craft"" doesn't mean I can't criticise it like any other game. It's still a bad game, whether it was made 10 years ago or 10 days ago.    Arin DOES have a personal agenda against Sonic franchise as a whole and I don't think that is constructive in any way.   I don't know about ""personal agenda"" but I do agree he is unnecessarily critical about the Sonic francise as a whole, mostly for the fact that he never gives any reason as to why. I'm personally not a fan of the Sonic series at all myself, but I do appreciate when they do something right, unlike Arin ever seems to."
rantgrumps,3e1pa1,pureorangeness,0,Tue Jul 21 13:37:14 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand this, the other games are playable as well? Would you mind explaining this to me?   I can't believe you're seriously asking this. Sonic 06 is unplayable because of weird processing lag, janky integration of everything in terms of game design and/or technicality, and the fact that it is certainly made by people who have no idea what conveyance in video games is. Tails is throwing confusing RING 3D MODELS around as an attack, Amy is turning INVISIBLE, one character is solely based on PHYSICS puzzles that weren't integrated well in the first place, there is no landmarks or any craft in the hub worlds: some are vastly big for no reason, and the others are blocky and confusing. Shameless texture reuse for a PS3 game. Nearly ALL the side controls are often not responsive, especially the Light Dash; which was 9 times out of 10 responsive in SA:DX. Also, there is no Mach Speed segment in SA:DX.  SA:DX offers good variety of characters. And before you harp on it, I do also believe people are bitching about Big the Cat too much. It's unnecessary, sure, but the fishing gameplay has a sweet spot where if you just lead your hook well, you can get the stages right in one throw each. SA:DX also provides great stages for Tails and Knuckles. Also, Gamma story's MARVELOUSLY done in every single way. It's a surprise that does not overstay its welcome, unlike Tails-Eggman in SA2.  Sonic Boom is just prone to lock you in a 3-way lane or a circle arena where you mash buttons. SA:DX stays mostly true to the main idea of Sonic game: speed, flow and momentum. Very rarely it breaks it, and it's due to the early development of it, thus it's excusable. Sonic 06 or Sonic Boom are inexcusable pieces of shit."

It has been my sincere effort to approach this thread with positivity and encouragement, and I apologize for the tone I am about to strike, but I don't know any other way to phrase it.  Who gives a shit if he knows what DLC means? Honestly, until their Mario 2 playthrough, I didn't have a clue what OP meant.   Also, what does it prove that he doesn't know shit about Sonic Adventures? He was probably already in college when that game came out and he would've needed a Dreamcast to even play it. I don't know how old you are but I'm turning 26 this year and I can't tell you anything about most games that came out in 2007/2008 when I was 18. Especially not when I didn't have the console. To this day, I don't know a single X-Box exclusive except for Halo.   I really don't get this ""Dan is not a gamer"" problem so many people have. What's the big deal? In the end, he is a funny dude who tries to put on a good show, really gives his best when he plays games, especially when he doesn't know them (Shadow of Colossus for example) and knows his shit when it comes to games he is fond of or interested in. That's not a hardcore gamer but I wouldn't say he is not a gamer either. He just doesn't keep up with the newest games, which I also don't do. I just stick to the games I'm interested in, which is probably why I'm currently at a couple of thousand hours on my 3DS.   To be real for a second, just imagine you sitting next to Arin while he plays this game and you never played it. Judging from the two episodes so far, the game looks broken as fuck. Really broken.

Jon and Arin dragging a game might be entertaining but when it's all they do it can get so... repetitive. Dan is more open minded and is usually willing to give the game a chance before dragging it.

It feels like it was done by someone just starting out who watched a couple online tutorials a few weeks ago to me.  It's art, sure, and I respect the artist, I always respect the artist, but it looks really bad to feature that on the sub's header when you have literally dozens of incredible artists regularly posting to the sub who could make something better.  My two cents? If you want to redo it, redo it, man. It's not a hit against the original artist if you make it original and do a better job."

They tried to make it dark with jokes about the brother dying and whatnot, and then the game went and did that. Plus it was an hour long one off, something that's increasingly rare these days. The jokes were pretty funny too, like the seed of destruction or the ""I'm not even being racist."" parts in particular. All in all it was a pretty funny series with a surprisingly deep plot.

Really putting a lot of effort into a charity stream there guys...  Person B: Yeah, it was pretty bad. No wonder they didn't want to archive it  Me: But didn't they say that they don't want people to record it at the beginning? So they never planned on showing a little bit of effort to begin with. Real classy.  Person C: Yeah! They were mediocre at that thing they didn't in any way have to do or provide for us publicly. They owe us SO much more than three episodes of free content every day for the last three years.  I then responded that it's for a fucking charity and that they should show a little bit of effort since they want our money, and that that person seems to think that they do GG out of the kindness of their heart, which just isn't true since it's a very lucrative job.

Other times I can get upvoted for shit they'd normally downvote me into oblivion for by disguising it in a snarky reference I know most of them won't understand.  I still don't understand how their circlejerk works but I'm convinced there's a system behind it. I think the issue is how you phrased it; instead of being honest about how mediocre the episode was and therefore not understanding, you should have tried something like ""Oh man, I remember how great that was but I can't remember the best parts! Someone remind me, quick!"".  Edit: On a semi-related note.

Brigading is when someone links your comment somewhere (like SRD) and folks come and vote your comment down or up, screwing with the natural progression of where the karma could have been. If multiple people start combing your history after reading a comment and downvote you based on participation in a subreddit, that's not technically brigading, but it's definitely a shitty thing to do. It's almost like getting brigaded by the hivemind, in a way."
rantgrumps,3dy37l,Troggie42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this with the occasional person criticizing me for posting here, and even that one troll posting a quote of me from here to try and get people to downvote me.  Surprisingly, being level-headed and calling them out on doing this usually ends with them being the one downvoted and me being in the low positives.  I think most of the rantgrumps hate is from a vocal minority, and past that many of them dislike us, but accept what we do and don't automatically dismiss us for posting here.  It certainly does get annoying when I feel like I'm being forced to delete comments where I said very nice things just to avoid being labeled poorly and further downvoted, though."
rantgrumps,3dy37l,LVL100Pumbloom,4,Mon Jul 20 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"I honestly never had that problem. If people don't like what I say and downvote it on the main sub, tough luck. Why should I give a shit about that? Does reddit have some kind of point system that rewards you for upvotes or anything? I still have no idea how reddit works."
rantgrumps,3dy37l,Avelrah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"It's more of a social reddit hivemind. Heavily downvoted content frequently gets downvoted without being read, heavily upvoted stuff gets upvoted without getting read. The issue comes from the downvote threshold that automatically hides comments that reach a certain amount of downvotes, which means no matter how valid or logical your comment, it's being censored in a way since many people skip over those or open them just to further downvote them.  Accounts with lower karma are sometimes shrugged off by a minority of people or instantly assumed to be either new or trolls and therefore recieve shit just for posting. Accounts with many comments with negative karma visible on the first page of their profile are commonly considered to be trolls, regardless of the actual content of their post, and get disregarded and downvoted no matter what they say.  At a certain point the entire system can be one where karma is the sole indicator of how valid or ""true"" a person words are.  Shit can be complicated, that's the other reason I left reddit back in the day. It's not as complicated in subs like these and has also seemingly gotten a bit better in other subs, surprisingly. The biggest issue is people downvoting you in groups out of dislike, or manipulating votes with multiple accounts, like /u/dclubaficionado does, to try and sway opinions or get your comments hidden.  But no, inherently karma means absolutely nothing."
rantgrumps,3dy37l,LVL100Pumbloom,5,Mon Jul 20 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know if true or not but someone on the main sub once told me, when this topic came up, that you can disable the downvote function. I think that would be the best idea for any sub, since too many people use the downvote button as ""I don't agree with your opinion, DOWNVOTE"". Especially when it's visible that you have 1-2 downvotes, people start to downvote too, like you said. Hell, I've been downvoted here for saying I prefer Dan over Jon and I've been downvoted on the main sub for saying that I prefer the one offs with Jon over Dan's.   I personally think that many websites do it better. You can upvote and downvote, but you can't go into the negatives. If it would stop at 1, maybe the hivemind would stop to a certain degree. Like it is now, downvote is just an option to disagree without actually explaining why they disagree and for others to follow without reason. I don't get the point. I never use downvote unless the person is insulting."
rantgrumps,3dy37l,Tom_Dynamite,3,Mon Jul 20 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"I generally reserve my downvotes for insulting assholes, trolls, people who are blatantly or objectively wrong, and of course, content that is entirely pointless or an exact repost with the exception of ""I completely agree with what you said and couldn't say it better myself"" (because I'm guilty of this on occasion and don't want to be hypocritical.), unless someone else has posted that exact same thing to the same post already.  I don't even always upvote things I agree with, either, on the other hand, I have similar but opposite criteria for that. This should be fairly obvious from comment chains I've had with people where we're completely agreeing and/or having a nice, constructive conversation, but neither of us upvote eachother.  I upvote posts I disagree with out of respect for how well put together they are, and I downvote posts I agree with based on them being circlejerk fuckery that adds nothing to conversation.  Can I add out of context, Tom, that while you and I disagree on Grumps quite a bit, we share some really common ideas and I can honestly say I respect you."
rantgrumps,3dy37l,LVL100Pumbloom,3,Mon Jul 20 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"I can only say that this respect is mutual. Our views on Game Grumps could barely be any more different. Like night and day. I sometimes could not share your opinion any less. Still, you explain it in a way, where I can understand why you see it that way, while being respectful towards different opinions. That's very interesting and half the fun of places like this for me. I don't want to see my opinion over and over again, I want to see and understand different opinions. Having respectful and interesting discussions is pretty much why I'm active here and not really on the main sub. So, I'm looking forward to many more arguments.  Ironic that I write this on a comment, where I actually fully agree with you. The comments I downvoted pretty much came down to insulting, trolling or just entirely pointless."
rantgrumps,3dy37l,Tom_Dynamite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:35 2015 UTC,"That's the magic of this place (most of the time).

There is some exceptions, like shadows throw me off, but I was able to 100% Mario Galaxy as Mario and unlock Luigi. I didn't have the patience to relearn how to play as Luigi, though... Just saying, that likely isn't the only issue. I suspect his lack of wanting to learn plays a role."
rantgrumps,3dz4xl,IwamineShuu,3,Mon Jul 20 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"As stupid as it sounds, I feel like it is just too complicated for him to control. With sidescrollers, you move in two directions and have a few action buttons. There are not many games that utilize all buttons. With many 3D games, you have much more functions and I think he has trouble learning them or remembering what all buttons do. It doesn't help that he has ADHD and refuses to listen to instructions.   I think Bloodborne is a perfect example. He was so passionate about the game and yet he didn't know basic battle mechanics, as many here pointed out. Like I said in a comment above, he didn't even knew all the basic controls for Mario Sunshine or Wind Waker. Especially Wind Waker has the buttons laid out for you on the screen and the game teaches you the rest by playing."
rantgrumps,3dz4xl,Tom_Dynamite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"I mean I'll say it again, I have ADHD and I think the issue is genuine lack of caring. You seem to be missing the other major problem of ADHD, which is hyper focusing and loving something /so much/ that you become utterly obsessed and do it over and over for hours on end and struggle to be able to actually stop. Of course, the issue could also be he's not interested in the game and thus is having trouble focusing on it. THOUGH if he's medicated, I've never tried meds... I hear they make you focus on the /tiniest/ little thing for hours until they run out and I already do that.   I will say I think learning control is pretty difficult on new consoles, it feels so much less intuitive than 2D predecessors. THOUGH I will admit, one thing people with ADHD do is, once we become convinced there's one way to do things, we will do it ad nauseam. Which would explain a lot of his behavior in games where he appears to be doing something very roundabout to the viewer. But yeah, honestly, I can see what you're saying."
rantgrumps,3dz4xl,IwamineShuu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"He claimed a couple of times, that he is on and off on his ADD medication (similar to Ross). At least he said so during Wind Waker. He said that he can become obsessed with drawing for example, when he takes it.   THOUGH I will admit, one thing people with ADHD do is, once we become convinced there's one way to do things, we will do it ad nauseam.   That sounds like Arin. He was really into Bloodborne and a lot of people said, that he didn't know proper battle mechanics and always did the same couple of things. Lack of caring is probably something that adds to this."

rantgrumps,3dz4xl,TheValkuma,8,Mon Jul 20 19:54:27 2015 UTC,"You are silly, that would mean that Arin would know how all the controls work. Watch Mario Sunshine or Wind Waker, where he is not aware of many basic controls and only learns them in the last third of the playthrough, after thousands of people told him how to do it."
rantgrumps,3dz4xl,Tom_Dynamite,5,Mon Jul 20 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"""God, why isn't there a button to just drop things?!""  Knowing what buttons do has never been Arin's strong suit. Or reading on screen prompts."
rantgrumps,3dz4xl,Panory,3,Tue Jul 21 00:21:09 2015 UTC,It still makes me salty to this day that Arin didn't see the DROP button.
rantgrumps,3dz4xl,BERTRAMUS,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:35 2015 UTC,How could he? He'd have to stop running around and read for half a second. I swear he never stopped moving except for jokes or when he had too in that playthrough.

rantgrumps,3dz4xl,bolt892,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"Galaxy is definitely an interesting adjustment for 3D space and mechanics. I'd argue that, combined with the amount of energy Arin puts into keeping noise coming out of his mouth while he's near the microphone, he has very little attention left for basic gameplay."
rantgrumps,3dz4xl,geddypasto,0,Tue Jul 21 19:51:53 2015 UTC,"He was having a weird amount of trouble getting the bee onto the money, even though Galaxy is really, really good about keeping Mario's shadow on the spot he's currently over/will land on, rather than anywhere that would make sense with the lighting."
rantgrumps,3dz4xl,Hyooz,0,Mon Jul 20 23:29:28 2015 UTC,"I mean, maybe he was taking lighting into account. If the light source is here, and his shadow is here, then Mario should land there. I highly doubt that Arin put that much thought into it, but I mean, it could be the reason."
rantgrumps,3dz4xl,Panory,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:13 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but this is something 3D Mario has always done. It's subtle, and the game never really explicitly tells you this is true, but I'm surprised he hasn't noticed it by now, having played through at least 3 other 3D Mario games.  Or, since it's Arin, I guess I'm not that surprised, but still."

Other than that, Arin and Dan haven't really told him to do much. I think Mark and Jirard have actually told Kevin to ""put that in"" more than Dan or Arin."
rantgrumps,3e14cx,kenored,2,Tue Jul 21 04:02:42 2015 UTC,"Thats true, and its understandable, since jirard and mark arent main grumps and like having that put that in joke that dan and arin have just not used much anymore"

rantgrumps,3e14cx,freddyjasonmyer,3,Tue Jul 21 04:55:22 2015 UTC,I don't know about Zurgie. I feel like he shouldn't get credit for it because he just ran a picture of Burgie through an iPhone app to make the effect.  But then again he came up with the idea to do that so I dunno.
rantgrumps,3e14cx,FeierInMeinHose,2,Tue Jul 21 05:23:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's either stepping up his game due to criticism, has gotten comfortable enough in the setting to come out of his shell, or a mixture of the both recently. His edits have definitely shown an increase in quality recently, and I'd say that we should praise him for that.  I actually don't know where OP is getting this idea that they don't hang out with Kevin, though, because the entire reason Kevin got the job is because he was friends with Arin prior to joining the Grumps. He also says he doesn't deserve to be called a grump because he's just the editor, but we called Barry a grump when he was purely the show's editor."

Game Grumps is his biggest requirement. NSP though takes priority, he's been part of that longer than GG.  To the best of my knowledge he's going to balance the two, he loves being on GG"
rantgrumps,3dyu0x,DaLateDentArthurDent,3,Mon Jul 20 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"I get that he enjoys Game Grumps but at the end of the day he also loves Ninja Sex Party (Maybe even more) and lately balancing them has been hard especially with the quickly growing popularity of Ninja Sex Party, so while he loves both i think it will come down to which one makes him more money and right now it looks like it might be NSP."

rantgrumps,3dyu0x,thisisdot,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"plus he can balance Grumps and NSP, depending on how they have scheduled recording sessions. He hasn't done GrumpCade and Steam Train in a while because as he has mentioned, they were working on finishing the Album, and the process seemed more difficult with Brian in another country, since he's in LA now, the process could probably move faster, meaning we can get more music videos and whatever."
rantgrumps,3dyu0x,thisisdot,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"but it always feels like hes in a state of either finishing a NSP album or a starbomb album so hes always busy, so why not just drop game grumps and put his full focus on those 2 bands?   Also maybe hes not as happy being a lets player as he once was"
rantgrumps,3dyu0x,Lime4Nine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"you don't know if he's happy or not, plus now that the album is finished, the next album won't be for a while because they probably are taking a break for a bit, and Starbomb 3 is probably in the planning stages at least, plus his ability to focus on working on those things depend on his schedule and his own ability to focus."
rantgrumps,3dyu0x,thisisdot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"Dan said that he and Arin go into a song writing zone and only do that from August-December. We still won't get Dan on anything until December, and since he spends more time on NSP, we won't see him for a while. They release albums yearly (I think) so Dan won't be on Grumpcade/Steam Train unless by some freak accident Dan's schedule opens up."
rantgrumps,3dyu0x,NyanVegito,2,Tue Jul 21 00:49:13 2015 UTC,"they release Starbomb albums yearly, NSP has only had 3 albums in the past ~6 years."

That's just cause of the grumps schedule, of course, but hey... it used to be Dan in the role Arin's in now, appearing usually on all 3 time slots. Now that he's scaled it back, and is a little burnt out, there's talk of him leaving, but I don't honestly think it's going to happen any time soon."
rantgrumps,3dyu0x,geddypasto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:02 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll get close to finishing SADX and then Dan will leave like Jon left near the end of Sonic '06... it's the Sonic curse.
rantgrumps,3dyu0x,matcha-green,2,Tue Jul 21 23:56:12 2015 UTC,"I love Dan, but him leaving Game Grumps is something he needs to do for himself. He's such a nice and  talented guy, but so much of his time is wasted on this kind of mediocre show that he clearly isn't as interested in anymore."
rantgrumps,3dyu0x,PleasePleasePepper,3,Wed Jul 22 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"I still doubt that he leaves anytime soon. With Brian moving to LA, it's much easier for them to schedule recording, writing and filming sessions. Game Grumps is an easy income, where he hangs out with friends and makes money playing video games. They said a usual recording session takes 8 hours and they normally record 15 episodes in that time, so one week worth of content. It's easy to do that in a day. If they are touring, he just has to invest two work weeks and they would have content for 10 weeks. That's not to bad in order to have a very good income. It also helps him promote NSP. Every video they did, he announced at the end of a GG episode.   I think he will leave when NSP is a secure income. It took him so long to make a living out of creating content, I doubt he will risk it because their current album is a success. When he leaves, then only when NSP has more successful albums and he has a lot of money in the bank."
rantgrumps,3dyu0x,Tom_Dynamite,0,Mon Jul 20 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"I can say almost certainly that NSP and Starbomb are making him far more than Game Grumps alone. Based on CDBaby's payouts, spotify alone made them $172000, and there's also itunes and physical copies that pay out significantly more (an article on the newest starbomb album said it sold 6000 physical copies the first week, meaning they made $53940 from that). Even with the 3 way split, it's a fairly solid amount of money, especially since the full sales aren't available unless we got their CDBaby info.   Also, just look at the fact that Brian moved to LA to do NSP/Starbomb full time. I doubt he'd be able to do that if it wasn't making some good money."
rantgrumps,3e06wp,mintymew,7,Mon Jul 20 23:09:43 2015 UTC,It's all about the story Arin will hate it call it shit and the thirteen year old fans will agree and go around the internet saying it's terrible and they've never played it and they will get fucking wrecked by people who have played.

rantgrumps,3e06wp,Avelrah,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:50 2015 UTC,Pretty much. That is what he does right? Having to justify is ADD with the story of games and being shit at them. He tried every way in the world even fucking breaking the game to prove to his very impressionable young fanbase that it is garbage and they buy it hook line and sinker. I have honestly seen people on other SM64 vids hate on the game and I see them again on GGs channel. I ask them have they played it? They say no. I ask them there age. They are about 12 or 13. So they never played it when it came out and they are relying on Arin to tell them if it's good or not.
rantgrumps,3e06wp,Emperor-Nero,4,Mon Jul 20 23:46:00 2015 UTC,"Who watches game grumps and still trusts anything Arin says? I mean, I can't remember the last time he said any trivia that was actually true. Like when he said that putting your ballsack into warm water makes you more fertile, and a (probably young fan, judging by his writing style) commented ""I didn't know about that water thing, but it sounds like a sweet-ass way to become fertile as fuck"". I just answered ""Actually, different temperatures are pretty much the worst thing for your sperm. NEVER trust anything Arin says without looking it up.""  It honestly baffles me that people can still listen to ANYTHING that comes out of this uneducated man-child's mouth and think that it's true.  Whoa, I kinda wrote myself into a rage here. I swear, the only person who makes me so irrationally mad is Arin. Why is he such an aggravating asshole? I pretty much transform into Pat the leprechaun when I think about Arin..."

rantgrumps,3e06wp,Emperor-Nero,3,Tue Jul 21 00:12:24 2015 UTC,"But Arin loves that story, because he doesn't have to pay attention to it. Sure, he doesn't understand anything because of that, but that doesn't bother him. I agree, I'd give it a 7,5 or maybe an 8 at best."

Season 2: More Kenny hate (at least he attempts to be competent this time), more fucking up, more complaining.  Edit: Also, a boat-load (terrible pun ahoy!) of dialogue...wouldn't go over well for them  I have no faith in them playing a highly-story-driven game.

It's an entirely story driven, character based drama, and nobody on the channel, except Suzy, is capable of not talking over a cutscene. I don't think any story driven game is right for Grumps. Plus it's really long and slow, and I just think it'd be sad to see them not getting it, when it's a really dry, emotional story. It could be alright if it were on Steam Train with Ross, Dan and Suzy, with Suzy being there to actually pay attention while Ross and Dan talk. I don't watch KKG, but it seems like something Suzy should play by herself over there; it seems like she should be playing Telltale and Telltale-equse games from what I've seen."

rantgrumps,3dx48k,georgie_exia,3,Mon Jul 20 12:17:29 2015 UTC,"I thought it felt kind of like only Liam actually likes this game, but at least we have someone who defends this game, not like game grumps where Arin just shits out his views and Danny can't hold his own against him even if he knew any better. And let's face it, Jon was very quick to give up too. Who can blame him? I certainly wouldn't want to bother with Arin. Granted, I would never even want to be friends with him either, but oh well."
rantgrumps,3dx48k,Avelrah,3,Mon Jul 20 13:51:36 2015 UTC,"Pat said something along the lines of ""I wish I could love anything like Liam loves the vita"", which really explains Liam's character. He looks for the good in a product, even though it has flaws. And from that perspective, I can see why he likes Sonic Adventures."
rantgrumps,3dx48k,elemlo,2,Mon Jul 20 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, most of the second episode is just running around in circles a lot and Danny is really not getting the best introduction to this game. In fact this should've been a Dan playthrough or at least a switch-off - I know the dude has depth perception problems but I can't imagine him having much bigger problems than Arin who's apparently played this a couple of times before yet still does pretty damn awfully, to compare by my 20 minute mark I was done with Windy Valley. and I am NOT skilled at games either."
rantgrumps,3dx48k,monotar,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've been watching the switcher Playlist almost exclusively now. The low quality opinions and lack of comedy in grumps is why there has been no daily grumps in a while

I mean, there's a lot of projection on your post, ""I don't like Stars Wars because I hate Lucas, so Arin must hate Sonic because he hates Sonic team"" but then you gave other reasons for not liking Star Wars (thin plot, looks like ass), just like Arin does with Sonic.

All I said within that paragraph is a paraphrase of ""I do get his mindset, as I used to think exactly like him and perhaps still do, but I acknowledge it being a really biased way of thinking"".  LSS, if that paragraph sounds wrong to you, here you go, it proves Arin is wrong.  There is some projecting there and maybe I am immensely wrong. But I don't think anyone but Arin himself can horribly disprove me on this, either."
rantgrumps,3dxgvv,Emperor-Nero,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:25 2015 UTC,You maybe onto something and it would not surprise me. Arin it petty and he has to justify his distaste and say something is awful not due to a vendetta or maybe it focuses on something he isn't a fan of like story(we all know he hates story). So it would not surprise me he seems like someone who must justifying something instead of actually accepting other reasons why.

rantgrumps,3dxgvv,Avelrah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:31:24 2015 UTC,Sonic is profitable. Space Channel 5 probably isn't. Sonic being made over Space Channel 5 makes Arin mad. Sonic games being generally lacklustre gives him a stick to beat them with for daring to deny one of his favourite games.  No real leaps there. Arin is a pretty petty guy.

We went over this many times, but again: He decides that he likes (or dislikes a game) like everyone else, but then feels like he has to justify it by using his twisted gamedesign bullshit.

No one's forced to listen to it. Evidenced by Mario 64, he's not gonna cater to nostalgia & pretend to like the game. Sure, he exaggerates sometimes when he drags a game but, again, as has been said, he's just talking & expressing himself like normal people do. They don't even close off the comments section so you're free to disagree and express yourself but literally no one is being forced to change how they feel about any game just because Arin Hanson said so."

Or, just keep the same costumes and play D&D? Because 5th Edition (which is what I would assume they would play, as it's the newest and probably simplest to get into) is hardly that expensive, if you even choose to spend the money on hard copies.  Anyway, regarding D&D, I wouldn't be against them playing it, per se, but I'm not exactly in favor of them doing so either. I know some of them are good at creating characters, and making wacky scenarios, but it wouldn't translate well. They'd probably just fuck up and get themselves killed. Unless, of course, they get a good story-writer as a DM, who would create a custom adventure/campaign to facilitate the idiocy unique characters, but then I bet the fans will go ""who's this idiot? Let <Grump name here> DM!"".  Then that brings us to rules. I honestly don't think they have the patience to process the rules of even 5th Edition. I still forget some less-common rules that I learned when I jumped from 4e to 5e. Even then, they'd probably shit all over the rules anyway.  And I just want to touch on length as well. D&D's not really all that exciting in short doses, if you ask me, and I highly doubt they're going to start some multi-month+ campaign."
rantgrumps,3e0ntb,MostRealestFoxhound,2,Tue Jul 21 02:16:41 2015 UTC,Dan could be DM he plays D&D.

A lot of things change in the rules, and he'd be left at about the same level as the players, maybe with a slight edge of understanding at best. Having a DM who is inexperienced with the edition and/or system you're just learning can be a mood-killer for the DM, the players, and subsequently, the viewers."
rantgrumps,3e0ntb,MostRealestFoxhound,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"I think he played it in college and a bit after.I don't know about his most recent game,but he is one person I know that clearly has a knowledge of it. So he'd be the only one with hope of knowing what the hell to do."
rantgrumps,3e0ntb,Emperor-Nero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I supposed we have no way of knowing how recently he played, of course. 5th Edition is actually much easier to get into than any others I know of (4e, 3.5, 3e), so it would probably be easy for him.  But, uh...like I said, it's pretty hard to go from even one numerical edition of a system up or down to another sometimes, D&D being one of the most erratic ones. Dan or Barry would probably make for a good DM if/once they could learn the ruleset, but I also really want those two to be players (because they probably wouldn't fuck around as much), so I'm torn."
rantgrumps,3e0ntb,MostRealestFoxhound,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:34 2015 UTC,I mean it could be funny if it was Dan and Ross going at it like Ross does something really stupid Dan tells him what he must roll and Ross always fucking rolls it. And slowly Dan goes mind due to rosses insane luck.

As an avid D&D player who has little taste for overly-comedic elements in a campaign, that doesn't sit well with me.

I'm fairly certain that all of the games they've featured are around $20-$50 max.*, and I'm also fairly certain that they wouldn't have needed a shit-ton of equipment to film it. Similar to how Ross blew $700 (of an undisclosed budget) on that Spectral Tiger mount (a bold and foolish move, of course, but did that project really need more cameras, etc.?).  Instead, they simply must play dress-up. Now, I'm not against that, I think the set and some of the costumes are a nice touch, and originally added some comedy value (now, no one even mentions that crap), but it really isn't even slightly necessary.  (*before applicable taxes/shipping rates)"
rantgrumps,3e0ntb,MostRealestFoxhound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:01 2015 UTC,"Well, nothing is ever necessary. They could film using their phones instead of HD cameras.

rantgrumps,3e0ntb,SpazzyBaby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"Well, nothing is ever necessary.   That's...not really an argument. I could take that and apply it to a sizable chunk of disagreements.  But, I would wager to say the cameras and other technical equipment (Edit: also the technical staff) are necessary at this point, lest the show be received negativity, and summarily dropped. To my knowledge, Barry and Suzy either don't own the show, or both don't own or run it (with at least the former being evident via the recent Sling fiasco; else, they're both engaging in ""back-alley business""). They're just the hosts, and are expected to produce some level of quality from it.  The costumes, while a quirk, take away from the budget, which was wholly unnecessary to attract a viewing population in the first place. ""Nothing is ever necessary."" It could have easily been a GG-affiliated production, and most likely still would have drawn the crowd it did. The only thing I'll give the corporation responsible for it the credit of, is that I assume they're the ones allowing the show to achieve its guest stars."

Adventure is a buggy mess but the core game does work well for what it is (I don't care for it myself). Arin knows however he doesn't like it but decided to play it and ""educate"" the audience on why it is bad. It's funny to see people riff on poorly put together games like ride to hell, but no one starts a 50+ episode skyrim playthrough to moan about the glitches. It's just not enjoyable to watch, if he wants to dislike it he should make a review rather than clog up people's sub box.   (I'm very tired as of writing this so please correct me if this makes no sense)"
rantgrumps,3dvma6,georgie_exia,2,Sun Jul 19 22:48:09 2015 UTC,"Very true, I don't see why he'd play the game if he dislikes it. I've seen people say the same thing about Sonic 3 & Knuckles, but as they said many times, it is Jirard's favorite game.  One thing that I liked about that playthrough, and Jirard as a person, is that he didn't blindly defend the glitches and shortcomings in the game. He accepted them, but could still say he liked the game.  There's some idea that your favorite game has to be flawless to everyone's eyes -- while it's natural to want your peers to like something that you like, it's also natural to be able to accept that this thing has flaws, if someone doesn't like it because of those flaws, then you should just accept it and move on.  Ragging on Arin as a person and his tastes and dissecting every little thing he does so you can sleep at night thinking that Arin doesn't like your favorite game is pretty bad.  Back to the point on why they played the game, I'd say it's because bad 3D Sonic games have pretty much become a $$$ cow. Or maybe because it was heavily requested? They didn't say anything about people sending them the games, though.   It's really all speculation at this point."
rantgrumps,3dvma6,Gazareth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:59:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair all that glitching around in Ep 1 was funny.

A real ""what is my life?"" moment."
rantgrumps,3dvma6,IwamineShuu,11,Mon Jul 20 13:59:08 2015 UTC,"The only thing that pisses me off is that Arin is too dumb to keep holding forward. Like, no shit, the game is glitching in areas where you're supposed to keep moving? Shocker. Also, as the first 3D sonic game excepting the hubworld in one of the Saturn games, it's not /that/ bad. It's bad, but it's not Sonic '06 levels of bad. It's from a different era. Sorry, but I don't find it funny when Arin continually shits on something, it's really tiring. His negativity is infuriating."

Obviously they can't fix everything from the core, but they did fix a good chunk of the issues from Sonic Adventure 2.   Also, I think holding forward is the issue IIRC. Like, he's holding forward, but moving slightly left or right will throw you off of the map when you should collide with the railings. So you're supposed to hold exactly forward even though the path winds in both directions.  I honestly haven't played that game in years, but I remember having the exact same issue."

To be fair, it's not his fault since it's likely his first time in a decade or more playing, but I suspect he's purposefully trying to get the game to glitch out.

He tries to go backwards on ramps, he never holds forward, and he makes an effort to go as slow as possible in the segments that actually let you go quickly. It's like taking a piece of paper, writing ""Sonic Adventure is bad"" on the bottom, and writing the rest later.  Except Arin is right. I understand that Sonic Adventure is nostalgic to a lot of people, and there's nothing wrong with liking it, but it's honestly shit. It aged like milk left out in the sun for 17 years, and it's so glitchy that letting the game take control for a second is a heart-pounding experience.   But the problem isn't that Arin thinks it's bad. If I told you that the same force that keeps the moon orbiting the earth is the same force that causes things to fall to the ground when you drop them, I'd be right, but if I said I figured it out because I dropped a block of cheese and the moon is made of cheese, so they must be connected, you'd call me an idiot. Same thing with Arin. He doesn't think it's bad because of the glitches and stuff, he thought it was bad before even playing it because Sonic is automatically bad and 3D is automatically bad unless he arbitrarily decides otherwise. The glitches and shitty camera just confirm his bias, and he'd just ignore any redeeming qualities because he'd already decided it was bad."

I remember playing this back in the day and don't recall finding the game to be nearly as bad as it looks now.  I am no way saying Sonic Adventures is a good game, it's just old.  Games from that Era just rarely, if ever, translate well to our current times.  You can pick out almost any game from that generation that you never played before and have a hard time enjoying it.  Playing the old Tomb Raider now days would be a nightmare.  Older games that we remember playing are mostly only fun because of the nostalgic value they hold.  There are of course the rare exceptions to this, but they are few and far between.  RPG's of course is one of the exceptions, but these games are mostly just clicking options.  This is why I wouldn't expect Arin to enjoy any of these types of older 3d games.  With both his lack of nostalgia and extremely low skill level in 3D games, it would be unfair to expect anything less.    Anyway, who gives a fuck what he thinks about a game?  I mean seriously, does anyone actually value his opinions on video games?  He fucking sucks at all games.  It's like getting mad at a baby for not liking Tetris.  They both don't understand how to play."
rantgrumps,3dvma6,samsim1990,2,Mon Jul 20 10:29:33 2015 UTC,"While you do make good points, I'd like to interject by saying that while, yes, Sonic Adventure is a bad game OVERALL, it does have some really good parts to it! For example:  The Chao Garden I challenge you, I DARE you to find one person who didn't fucking love this part of the game. The chao garden was without a doubt amazing, because it was strangely addicting to help these little creatures grow, fight, race, breed and see them live to old age, evolve, die and be reborn. I never really got that far into it, partly because I was rather much more younger playing this game (And played it on the computer, not the Gamecube or Dreamcast) so for me it was harder to find the value in looking after the chao given the annoyance of having to play through entire levels when I never used to be that good at Sonic Games (Admittedly, I'm not much better nowadays, but I accept that!) But whenever I talk about the Chao garden to anyone who's played SA1 or SA2, they always agree it was the best part, and to quote ProJared here, the reason why so many people have a positive opinion of these games is because the Chao garden forced them to play only the best, most fun levels of the game. This conditioned a positive feeling towards the game, because of the focus on only playing Emerald Beach, only playing the Casino level, only playing Speed Highway, because these were the closest to the Chao Garden and the most fun! Especially while playing with Sonic, who's game play is pretty much the best of the lot. This brings me to my next point  The Sonic Stages While it's unfair to base the entire game off just one sixth of the characters available, Sonic's game play is by far and away the best of the lot. It's fast paced, action filled, and every level has some sort of big moment to it which gives it a sense of scale and grandness. Unlike in SA2 where there are some frustratingly designed levels, SA1 sort of lacks any frustration with it's level design, and it's more your own ability of the game that holds you back, not the game itself being designed to trick anyone trying to rush through, as I felt was more the design in later speed levels in SA2. Are they perfect? God no, they're glitches as hell in some cases, I know i've had my fair share of glitches and annoying moments. But are they fun? You betcha! Does it justify the entire game being considered the second coming of Christ? No. But it doesnt have to in my opinion. This game was admitidly Sonic Team's first jump into 3D, there's always bad shit that goes down in that leap, remember Super Mario 64? That game is hardly perfect either, though a point can be made that it's more easily worked around than SA1.   The Rest of the Characters Aren't WHOLLY Bad  As much as I'd like to jump on the hate bandwagon here, the rest of the characters gameplay isn't that bad. Except Big and Amy, they suck really. Knuckle's stages are rather entertaining, in my opinion. The levels aren't on a ""Mad Space"" scale where it's stupidly impossible to find the emeralds, and you know what its a sight better than in SA2, where you cant find any Emerald if you're close to it, only one at a time. The levels are short once you know what you're doing, and I cant remember much frustration with his levels, except perhaps the Egg Carrier. Tails is harmless really, his levels are very similar to Sonic's and are the least breaking from formula, however they aren't very imaginative. Tails' bonus levels, sandboarding and the Tornado stages, are actually quite fun, and despite his similarity to sonic, his stages arent terrible either. Now, people tend to shit a bit on Gamma's gameplay, but I found it very entertaining and empowering to be one of Eggman's robots destroying Eggman's robots. Coming off the Sonic X TV show, and the story in game, Gamma's levels are probably the emotional centre piece of the whole plot, and I wont lie when I say i did shed a tear at his ending. But I can see it's not for everyone. Amy and Big? Shit. However I do somehow enjoy Big's gameplay in a ""So bad it's good"" kind of way. I guess i just like fishing, but that's a personal quiff. Amy's levels are unforgivable really. They're boring, except for when Zero chases you, then there is some tension, but it's very limited. At least Big and Amy's levels are blissfully short.  The Music One thing no one ever denies, despite the sort of corny cheese of them, the soundtrack for Sonic games is quite amazing. It always fits the tone of the scene and I dare you not to recognise every bit of this and SA2's music. The character themes are also delightfully corny, which I love on a purely nostalgia, kid effused level. Arguably, the worst songs, Big's and Knuckles' theme's are the most memorable my opinion based solely on how off the wall they are, and how could we live without the ""Unknown from ME"" remixes and parodies? While, to quote Arin, ""Bumrock"", it's enjoyably corny in a Sonic kind of way.   The Bosses are memorable Yes they're easy. Yes some are a joke. Yes some are pretty shit, but you've gotta admit these boss fights were pretty cool looking in some cases. I'm looking mainly at the Chaos Fights and late game Eggman Fights. Of course the Super Sonic stage, while despite having WAY too much story, not enough gameplay, makes up for it with an honestly cool final boss that gives out a  truly threatening image. While Perfect Chaos looks a bit naft today, his re-envisioning in Generations shows he could have looked so much more threatening if technology allowed. I say, despite their objective awfulness, they're still fun to play.  It's flawed, oh god is this game flawed. It's glitched, the graphics are terrible in some cases, lighting effects are crap, the lip syncing is no existent, the voice acting is cringe-worthy at best and downright atrocious at worse, the plot line is silly and comical and a lot of the game boils down to either ""it's fun"", or ""why the hell is this in the game?"" with little in between, and a lot of the game is down to personal opinion. But, I wouldnt say the game is outright terrible. It's bad, but it has redeeming qualities to make it still entertaining, and I think it's a testament to how good some parts are that people still defend it. No one is defending Sonic Boom or 06, while 06 has the ever impressive ""So bad it's good"" argument. Where this game shines, In my opinion, it still really shines. The Sonic levels are still fun as hell, and the Chao garden needs to be brought back into another sonic game! I think if this game was remade and remastered, new voice acting, new CG, new cutscenes, new code, new console, new game essentially, SA1 would be almost as good as Generations, which in my opinion is the paramount of modern sonic games, and so it should be. No, SA1 is not the ""Best geam Eva!1!"" neither is it the best sonic game ever, it's not even that good of a sonic game. But for what it is, it's still entertaining. It doesnt hold a candle to the games before or after, but it was a forerunner in a new generation of Sonic. A lot of sonic features had to be refined and remastered before the Boost Trilogy (Unleashed, Colours, Generations) but I think, given what we could have had instead, the Adventure series was not as bad as it could have been.  Overall, I agree, Sonic Adventure is a bad game. But it has moments of true greatness in it. Does Arin have a point? A lot of the time, yes. But I feel he overlooks a lot of the good side to sonic, which is an unfortunate bias in Sonic Arguments. Either people are stuck hating, or loving, and cant see the other's side. If anyone wants to criticise my opinions, please do!! I'll welcome other views."

Three of my favorite 3D platformer of that era (that came out before Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast) are Crash Bandicoot 2 & 3 as well as Spyro the Dragon. While the graphics don't look that great anymore, the games themselves hold up way more than Sonic Adventure ever could. Those are 17+ years old. They aren't really glitchy, the camera works better, the controls are more fluid and there aren't parts that are widely considered to be broken and not fun. Banjo-Kazooie and Mario 64 also came out before SA. The same goes for those and considering that Sega had the most advanced console at the time, that is pretty sad.  It's okay to like Sonic Adventures but they are far from great games. OP has linked to it and I agree that ProJared really makes a good point. The parts that are fun, are really fun. The problem is, that the bad parts are really bad. It's the kind of game that people like because they grew up with it. Same as I love MediEval but although it really has aged quite poorly."

Not the worst at the time. But it hasnt aged well, as you said.  Now I havent watched GG's play it yet so feel free to correct me if Im wrong, but my issue seems to be that because Arin does not like Sonic in the slightest he will do all he can to try to hammer into everyones heads that there is NOTHING redeemable about any Sonic game.  For example, I dont know his take on it, but even ProJared basically says that to this day the City Escape level is badass, and it is. It's a really awesome and memorable stage. To this day I dont know a diehard Sonic fan that cant recite Escape from the City.  But Arin will probably just go ""Ugh, this stage is stupid. I dont understand why it's so popular."""

rantgrumps,3dtpqd,Emperor-Nero,14,Sun Jul 19 10:49:22 2015 UTC,"100% agreed. He has always been like that, even in the Jon era. I for one don't care for pure shooters. If they are open world shooters with RPG elements like Far Cry, or Fallout 3&NV, or Borderlands, I love them. But I can't stand pure level-based shooters like CoD or even Half Life. That being said, I don't think that Half Life is a bad game at all (CoD is up for debate). It's just not for me. How fucking conceited does one have to be to think that his own preference is objectively good and everyone should enjoy it, and the other way around?"
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,Avelrah,6,Sun Jul 19 11:54:44 2015 UTC,"I will say that his review on Castlevania 2 gave its fair share of credit to CV2 for certain design choices. Other than that, the one time I've ever heard him say, ""This isn't necessarily bad"" is in the Zelda Sequalities, where he's referring to ALttP's map. The way I see it, there is no difference between ""I don't like this"" and ""Bad"" in his mind. I guess maybe he feels like he has to justify why he doesn't enjoy a certain mechanic, or game even, and it's easier to say that the thing is bad than admit that you just don't like it.  For example, I don't like Mario 64. I didn't grow up with it, because my parents never got me an N64 as a kid. I bought my first console in February 2002- a jet black nintendo Gamecube with Metroid Prime included. Anyway; now when I play SM64 I get bothered by a lot of the problems present in the game. Controls are shoddy, the graphics are mediocre, the gameplay isn't similar to the Super Mario Bros I grew up with on NES, and the camera is frustrating. But you know what? Just because I don't enjoy the game, does that make it bad? Hell no. Super Mario 64 was revo-fucking-lutionary, and for good reason. There are so many good design choices in that game, that- for some- the hardware limitations and growing pains that came with the first foray into 3d console gaming in such a manner, are largely unimportant. So just because I don't enjoy the game (hell, I might even say I think it sucks) doesn't mean nobody else should.  And that's what Arin's missing; he's so in his head justifying his opinions by making the easy connection of, ""Oh, I don't like it because it's bad."" That's not what critique is. That's Arin, realizing that other people may not think the same way he does, and instead of agreeing to disagree, he decides that everyone else is wrong."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,geddypasto,4,Sun Jul 19 16:16:16 2015 UTC,"I think you touched upon Arin's biggest issue here. He presents his opinion as facts, and it makes it incredibly frustrating to listen to."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,Nilocor,5,Sun Jul 19 20:18:29 2015 UTC,"In Bloodbourne the plot is very very very secondary to the gameplay, since it's an action RPG. Kingdom Hearts is a JRPG, where plot is the only thing keeping it from being an Excel spreadsheet.  I'm not a fan of Arin or Bloodbourne but that is a poor example."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,PoloJuice,3,Sun Jul 19 11:14:48 2015 UTC,"Plus you're comparing a game to a multi-decade franchise, and comparing a story told via optional lore that pieces together with a story in which every player gets the same information.  As far as I've seen Arin hasn't really been reading item descriptions, but they provide good backstory on most things in the world, while still being ambivalent.   Kingdom Hearts on the other hand throws in a lot of weird plot things and secret endings that sometimes only are explainable after the fact (for example by introducing new rules)"
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,elemlo,-2,Sun Jul 19 11:43:03 2015 UTC,"My point is there is clearly a story present in Bloodbourne it is clearly there and obvious to anyone with two brain cells and I compare it,because he calls KH story confusing yet Bloodbournes story which is not very secondary it is actually important to understanding anything that is going on. Dans confusion to why the hell things are happening are valid,because no reason is given,but a story is trying to be told and it is told badly. Also Bloodborne is a JRPG. It was made in Japan therefore a JRPG."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,frayjoker,5,Sun Jul 19 11:17:05 2015 UTC,"The difference is that Bloodborne's plot is gleaned from your personal experience of the game, which is purely driven by exploration and combat. There's no point where you have to go somewhere because the plot told you to. How it's told is specifically unobtrusive. You get it from snatches of conversations with optional NPCs. From short notes you encounter in the environment. From observing the design of environments, monsters, items you collect. Cutscenes are kept short and free of exposition. The story is obtuse sure, but it doesn't get in the way of gameplay. Which is a specific grievance that Arin has consistently voiced.  Also, while mechanically similar, the pace of Bloodborne is completely different to Dark Souls. Positioning and Timing are rewarded Dark Souls, punishment is absorbed through defensive play. Reaction and Aggression are the key skills that are rewarded in Bloodborne, and punishment is absorbed through offensive play. There's less ""waiting for an opening"", a preference is consistent with what he has previously declared (particularly in his Zelda Sequelitus video).  It's also true that some games do good design ideas badly, and bad design ideas well. Many people who are critics of QTEs for instance, would recognise that their implementation in Shenmue or Heavy Rain is iconic and mechanically justified. Rarely is any one opinion a truth consistent when all relevant factors are taken into consideration. While you could argue there is intellectual honesty in acknowledging the merit of works someone doesn't prefer, it's also not necessary in that discussion."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,frayjoker,-1,Sun Jul 19 11:51:22 2015 UTC,"The reason I mention is the things he still criticized the Souls games for Bloodborne is still very guilty of. Also we all know Bloodborne is much easier than the Souls games. Also from what I know of Bloodborne it rewards you for being offensive,but that is not the best way to play being defensive with certain offensive keys are the best way to play as we see in the video footage of the other guy playing the game he is defensive with spouts of offense when an opening is given. While you can attack at any time that is not wise and that is clear when Arin dies. The blood starved beast I believe is an example where it did a massive attack and he waited for it to be done he hid until it was over. Is that fun is that what you people want! Oh wait I just pointed out Arins hypocrisy sorry. It was waiting for it to be over. How is that different from OoT it isn't."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,frayjoker,2,Sun Jul 19 12:03:15 2015 UTC,"Have you got examples of which specific criticisms Arin makes that carry across between the two games? Also I'm not sure ""we all"" know that Bloodborne is easier than Dark Souls or why that's pertinent to this discussion. Then you sort of just trail off into a whole bunch of drivel I can't particularly make sense of. I'm talking about the difference between a shield mechanic and a regeneration mechanic, dodging out of danger rather than dodging into a better position. Bloodborne has more movement, more immediacy, supported by more aggressive mechanics. That has nothing to do with an individuals playstyle, it has entirely to do with gameplay style."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,frayjoker,-1,Sun Jul 19 12:16:07 2015 UTC,"Bloodborne clearly does not reward aggressive behavior it rewards patients which I am not saying is bad it isn't it is just how the gameplay is. It gives a dynamic of control to the enemy in a sense saying you're in their world not your own and they know how to play and you don't know. Also Bloodborne is considered easier overall by most I have talked to. Also yeah I went and quoted what Arin said about Oot when in reality has very similar combat you can attack and get hits in at any time,but that is not advised. Like in Bloodborne it is better to wait for an opening rather than being more aggressive there is a mix. However my point of the thread isn't how is it different just how he can't say a game is just not good for him or he doesn't like it that it's a bad game not that he just does not like it. He looks for an excuse to justify his dislike instead of just saying there is not real reason he isn't a fan. As I mentioned I dislike the uncharted series why I don't know I just don't. There is nothing particularly wrong with it I just don't enjoy it it isn't broken things work well the game flows fine."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,henrykazuka,3,Sun Jul 19 12:27:53 2015 UTC,"Nice, generally speaking. If you're going to go back and edit in an argument, you should put it under some kind of marker to indicate that my comment isn't necessarily addressing the entirety of yours.  That aside. I've played Dark Souls, I've played Bloodborne, and I'm telling you that Bloodborne rewards aggression inherently through it's regeneration mechanic. It allows you to commit to an attack in a way that Dark Souls doesn't. In Dark Souls you had a shield, you kept it up, you managed your stamina, and tried to find the right moment to attack. Alternatively you didn't have a shield, in which case it was a matter of figuring out when you could get in, make an attack, and get out.  In Bloodborne you create those opportunities. The example you presented, the Blood Starved Beast, when it does the poison aura attack. With a high poison resistance and spare antidotes, it's free hits you can choose to take. It swipes at you, you dodge in, you attack, it hits you. In Dark Souls you'd dodge out, heal / put your shield up. In Bloodborne, you try to keep on attacking, because that is how you get your health back and conserve healing items.  They're two different paces of games. You don't even sound like you've played Bloodborne, so why are you arguing with someone who has?"

rantgrumps,3dtpqd,henrykazuka,3,Sun Jul 19 12:52:19 2015 UTC,A game that regenerates your health when you attack doesn't reward aggressive behavior (Bloodborne) but a game where you should be holding your shield up all the time does (Dark Souls)?

rantgrumps,3dtpqd,henrykazuka,3,Sun Jul 19 13:00:40 2015 UTC,"It is there and badly told but it doesn't stop your enjoyment of the game since the gameplay is what you're there for. Turn based JRPGs are almost entirely sold on story so the story being poorly told is that much worse for the game.  It's like if the controls for Gone Home were bad, no one cares because it's not sold on gameplay. If the controls for Skyrim were bad, it's a huge problem since it inhibits your enjoyment of the game."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,geddypasto,-1,Sun Jul 19 11:29:22 2015 UTC,"So Kingdom Hearts isn't a JRPG it lacks turn based combat in every installment so it's not a JRPG. Also my point is with KH you don't have to understand the entire story most of the games are independent in a way from each other with some common threads connecting them and the threads are usually explained via flashbacks. Hell when I was ten and I played them the first time I did not give a damn about the story and it did not effect how fun the gameplay is. I compare them,because both have very deep lore they expect you to catch up on throughout playing it."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,henrykazuka,2,Sun Jul 19 11:39:04 2015 UTC,"it was made I'm Japan therefore a JRPG.   No. Genres are used to differentiate gameplay styles, not nationality. We don't say Japanese/Western Racing Game because it doesn't bring any new information about the game. Gran Turismo and Forza are simulation racing games, who cares where they were made?  JRPG and WRPG are called like that because back on the NES and SNES eras most of the RPG with heavy emphasis on pre made characters where their story was the main point were made on Japan and for consoles (JRPG can also be called console-style RPG), while most RPG made on the west had more of a tabletop, make your own character kind of gameplay and they were mostly on PC (WRPGs are also called PC-style RPG).   Notice how on JRPGs you play as Sora, or Cloud, or Squall. Even though the Hero from Dragon Quest doesn't have a name, he already has an origin story. On games like Skyrim or Bloodborne, who your character was doesn't really matter, it's all about who he will become."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,geddypasto,0,Sun Jul 19 11:42:27 2015 UTC,Actually no that was not the difference the main difference was the turn based combat and leveling systems. Prebuild characters existed in WRPGs. The reason I compare is the reason he crucifies games and there are games he loves that fall into the same trap hell Mega Man X does that too with the complicated story that makes no sense as well as installments go on.
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,WERE_GOIN_IN_HARD,2,Sun Jul 19 11:47:42 2015 UTC,"That is not the main difference. Xenoblades Chronicles, Crisis Core or Final Fantasy 13 doesn't have turn based combat but is still considered a JRPG. The leveling system has nothing to do with it either, since western RPGS have a level system too. The difference is a heavier focus on story and dialogue. It's more about the story than the game, while western RPGs are the other way around. Skyrim or Bloodborne have a rich story that you can fully ignore and still enjoy the game. You can't do that with Final Fantasy for example. The battle system is not really real time but it doesn't have to be turnbased either. Especially in recent years, there aren't that many turn based JRPGs but rather games with a more active and action oriented battle system."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,georgie_exia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:06:40 2015 UTC,"This is it exactly, JRPGs focus on characters and dialogue, Western RPGs focus on gameplay and player goals."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,ShadowNightt,0,Sun Jul 19 14:18:27 2015 UTC,"Prebuild character existed but they weren't the norm. The genre defining games were Ultima and Wizardry on the west and Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest on the east. These last two were actually based on the turn based system of Wizardry, but later on they added their own spin by giving more importance to the narrative and characters. JRPG is like a tale that you play, while WRPG is like a digital D&D playthrough.  I'm pretty sure that if you like Megaman X it's not because of the story. Just because you like something on one game, it doesn't mean you have to like it on every game. Arin loves Metroid, but he hates Symphony of the Night. Why? The gameplay is similar to the point where the genre is now called metroidvania, he should love both, right? His reasoning is that what he likes about Castlevania (linear gameplay, well positioned enemies, skill based difficulty) got ruined when they changed it to become a Metroid copy. Now Castlevania (igavania) has exploration, enemies going back and forth just waiting to be killed and there are a million ways to bypass a tough enemy (items, spells, leveling up, summons).   A lot of people hate Zelda 2 because it's ""not like Zelda 1"", Arin tends to think like that. Is that so bad?"
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,LinkED9999,0,Sun Jul 19 12:45:42 2015 UTC,"I understand Arin's disdain for the term Metroidvania, though- the nonlinear, explorative Castlevania games do have a significant RPG element that's not present in Metroid games. That, in my eyes, leads to a very significant difference in how the game is played.  For example, if we look at things the games have in common, there are branching, nonlinear paths; there are different areas; save rooms, maps... items.  But are the items particularly similar? I think not. Missiles, bombs, etc. play very differently to Alucard's arsenal. Missiles deal increased damage, super missiles deal even more, but they have functional properties. The beam upgrades have functional properties. Weapons for Alucard are so ubiquitous; a lot of them don't have a function outside of combat, and vice versa.  Then there's the leveling up. When a Metroid game gives you a challenge, your first thought may be, ""Maybe I need a different item."" Maybe you think you need a new plan of attack. Never once do you say, ""Oh, I need to go back and kill a bunch of enemies so my stats will get better.""  I'm not saying one is better than the other; I'm a metroid fan who hasn't played too many new castlevania games so I don't have the right to proclaim one as the best. That said, they are a lot more different than people tend to give them credit for.  To get back on topic, though; Arin definitely doesn't have the ability to appreciate a game for what it is, rather than the impact other games in the series had. Is that a problem? I think so. Metroid Prime 2 introduced ammo, and I didn't care much for it. The light and dark world of that game weren't as interesting to me as Tallon IV, which wasn't as interesting as Zebes. But the game itself was still very enjoyable to me because it did a lot of things right. Zelda 2 had more exploration than Link to the Past, and it's no secret that Arin highly values that in his Zelda games. But because the gameplay is different, he immediately discredits the game."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,georgie_exia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:52:40 2015 UTC,"FYI I don't think anyone ever grinded to beat a boss on symphony of the night, the first half of the game is pretty easy and when it gets harder on the second half you also get OP weapons and spells.   As for the items, you don't find only weapons on the game, you also get the ability to turn into different shapes, the high jump boots, summons, etc. Those do have functional properties that let you explore a bit more.   I haven't played Zelda 2, but after watching Danny's playthrough it didn't seem to have more exploration than LttP.   Back on topic, I agree Arin can't enjoy a game for what it is, without the what it isn't and the what it could have been."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,LinkED9999,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:15:45 2015 UTC,"My point was more that combat and exploration aren't linked in Castlevania in the same way they are in Metroid. Weapons coincide with new areas in Metroid.  In Zelda 2, you aren't given a map or waypoints for objectives; you have to figure out where you're going for yourself. To me, that justifies the game as having more exploration in the sense that you need to find those landmarks for yourself.  Now, I'll admit that I don't know a whole lot about SotN, so it is super helpful to know that that's the case about bosses. Thank you!"

In LttP, you always know where to go because of a map existing, key points marked on your map, and the fortune teller telling you the general area you should go. There's no exploration to be had when the game tells you where to go. In Zelda 2, the game expects you to explore and find the palaces and items on your own."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,elemlo,4,Sun Jul 19 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"Bloodborne's story makes no sense (at least from what I've read up on it) Apparently it's all happening in reality but then it isn't and it is never mentioned.  Regardless I agree, Arin is a very bias person. Anything he doesn't like is worthless in his eyes."

rantgrumps,3dtpqd,elemlo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"The story does make sense. Some parts are left intentionally vague, but the overall events and story are all in the game, and the game gives you enough information to work out the rest based on explicit in game lore. It's just all optional and you have to really work to piece it together."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,henrykazuka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you know more than mean so please help me decipher it. From what I've read up, Yharnam exists but is also a dream (hence the waking up ending). How does this work?"
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,HireALLTheThings,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:02 2015 UTC,"I never took it to mean that Yharnam itself was a dream, but that you were waking up from the Hunter's Dream specifically. For most of the game, you're tied to the Hunter's Dream where Gerhman and the Doll help you power up and move forward in the Hunt, but if you choose Gehrman's mercy kill ending, he severs your connection to the dream and let's you wake up, no longer being tied to the dream and the Hunt. I feel like this is supported by the fact that there are other hunters in the game (Djura and Eileen) who are aware of the Hunter's Dream, and seem to have once been tied to it the same way you are in the game.   There are a lot of interpretations and theories about a lot of aspects of the game, especially towards the end, but you'll find that most of the good ones rely pretty heavily on explicit text from the game. There's plenty of information if you just dig around for it, and I'd recommend reading some online lore discussions to get more info. Someone even wrote a 90 page essay breaking down the lore, though even that guy has some pretty out there theories that don't seem very well supported by the game.   EDIT: Btw, have you played the game yourself? Or are you just going off of the Grumps playthrough? I don't watch GG anymore, so I have no idea how much of the game they actually discovered, but chances are they did and understood very little so I doubt most of their audience really got much of the plot."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,LVL100Pumbloom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Both grumps and super best friends. I'm really interested in the game but lack a ps4. The grumps didn't dwell too much on the plot, a lot of the episodes were very podcast-y."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,Wizc0,3,Tue Jul 21 21:25:05 2015 UTC,"Bloodborne is very different from Dark Souls from a design perspective. And most of the differences really seem to be in Arin's favor based on how he has been playing games on the show.  Bloudborne has more cancellable animations, invincibility frames, no shields and a focus on parrying, and faster boss animations than Dark Souls. All these things make the game faster, whereas Dark Souls was more focused on waiting out an attack to plan out your spacing and counter, Bloodborne is more of a reactionary, action-focused game.  It also more clearly tells you where to go via world design.  And lastly it has less parameters. Dark Souls has more weapons, armor, and combinations of weapons. It also has shields (with different parry-windows, block percentages per type of damage, or even character buffs), rings (which can influence damage, health, iframes on roll under a certain equip load, buff counter attacks on thrusting weapons, increase walking speed in bodies of water) and most important of all: an equip load system.  When playing a game of Dark Souls, I always plan my equip load, since that influences your walking speed, stamina regen and iframes on roll. This results in having to plan your endurance stat, when you're getting Havel's/RoFaP, and when you're able to use what weapons and what equipment.   I could go on about significant design differences that make Bloodborne a more streamlined experience if you're curious about certain elements (lore, plot, transformation weapons vs. switching weapons w/ equip load, estus vs vials, bullets vs shield parrying, insight vs humanity, etc.)"
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,SpacePilots,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:57:38 2015 UTC,So pretty much in comparison Bloodbourne is much easier than the Souls series correct?
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,ChefExcellence,3,Sun Jul 19 12:03:49 2015 UTC,"It's not a binary, and much easier is hyperbolic (like you saying it's exactly the same in the post). I'd say in most regards Bloodborne is the more streamlined one, the one that makes Souls more accessible. It's still about learning enemy movesets and level design that keeps you on your toes, but it's going more towards character action games (e.g. Devil May Cry, Bayonetta), where Dark Souls is the slow, more planned version.  I have a way harder time playing Bloodborne than Dark Souls, because I'm better at planning a character for a boss than at fast reaction gameplay (also because I've been playing Dark Souls for 4 years). Dark Souls can be easy if you have patience, and if you're willing to learn its systems.  Which is my main point. Arin prefers Bloodborne because the design focus fits him better than the slower Dark Souls. Even though Dark Souls wind up animations are way more forgiving."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,DukeDamn,0,Sun Jul 19 12:41:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah,but people seem to be missing my main point is how he has to have reasons for his dislike instead of just saying there is not real reason he just dislikes it."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,SpacePilots,3,Sun Jul 19 12:42:59 2015 UTC,"Because your arguments are very poor. Of course Arin can dislike Dark Souls and Kingdom Hearts while liking Bloodborne.  I find Kingdom Hearts' plot an in-concise, inconsistent cesspool of a plot that wants to twist itself with every installment. But I find the way Souls games create world with so much detail an interesting rules great, especially because everything is morally grey.  Arin looks at games from a design perspective, which is super clear in Jon era. Jon values atmosphere and a personal connection, whereas Arin thinks there's a reason games cause these feelings. Because of that he wants to reverse-engineer arguments for why he doesn't like games, which is completely reasonable. Saying he dislikes games for no real reason, isn't really something you can blame Arin for based on these arguments."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,DukeDamn,0,Sun Jul 19 12:55:36 2015 UTC,"Okay maybe you need something explained. The point is he will find arbitrary things to dislike. Guess what I don't like Oot either for the exact reasons Arin does not like it I actually agree with him,but to say it is outright bad is also dishonest. It is not bad I am just a fan of how it handles.This isn't an argument it's a rant that is not an argument. My point is you can't say something overall is bad when it clearly isn't. Like I also mentioned I am not a fan of the Uncharted series it works well the combat is fine I just don't like it there is no real reason behind my dislike."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,ShadowNightt,3,Sun Jul 19 13:01:48 2015 UTC,"""Okay maybe you need something explained"". Arbitrary is a subjective term in your context, because Arin's enjoyment is hindered by OoT's camera system and waiting, among other things. The problem there is that sequelitis is presented as a more objective thing, whereas his dislike of OoT is mostly personal.  Saying a game is bad is more of a relative term as of now. Where not in the 80 anymore, so most games that come out function. Compare it to music, I find that Nickelback and KoRn make bad music. Not because it's harmonically dissonant, arhythmical for no reason, but because it's bland and not bold in most regards. For the same reason, one can think a lot of games to be bad.  There's a bunch of games that function well that I percieve to be bad games (like La Mulana and Final Fantasy 8), and that's okay."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,DukeDamn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:17:07 2015 UTC,"One thing I don't know about you,but I have played many games that don't function well in recent years thing,being clunky,have terrible music(Also terrible music can sometimes be subjective,but also there is objective in a sense of not fitting the place or being ear grating) the point is there is a difference between something bad and it doesn't work,the controls don't function well or are clunky,the story is utter garbage with holes in it(which many games still do),ugly textures. I actually agree with Arin a lot when it comes to games we usually have similar taste,but my point is him calling something bad when it meets the idea of what a good game is. It is okay to not like aspects,but I believe there is difference between something bad and something that is not your taste."

rantgrumps,3dtpqd,henrykazuka,-2,Sun Jul 19 13:21:14 2015 UTC,I wrote the first part in anger I have calmed down a lot now. The thing is does Arin know what makes a game good. There are games that follow his criteria that he hates and games that don't that he loves. So I don't think he should make games at all until he knows how to make something objectively decent in game
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,newfite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:50:52 2015 UTC,"Kind of a side-note that I noticed, but in your opening sentence, ""open his mouth and remove all doubt that he knows anything about it"" actually means Arin knows a thing or two about game design. The phrasing you were probably looking for is probably ""open his mouth and remove all doubt that he knows nothing about it.""  Sorry. That was bugging me a little more than it should have."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,elemlo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"I'll just put this out here, I was never able to play any Kingdom Hearts, not because I didn't have access to them but because I can't stand them for a few reasons, besides Chain of Memories (Which I did not understand anything that was going on at all in and sort of played it for a few hours until I got bored of the repetition) when my cousin lent it to me, but the story is one of the most convoluted stories in gaming history. While many things eventually get explained that were obviously planned from the start, many more things get made up later on that make absolutely no sense to retroactively explain things that happened earlier.  I've heard around 15 explanations of the current story since the last game was released and have watched a 90 minute -- 90 MINUTE -- analysis meant to explain the entire plot, backstory, et cetera of the games and I assure you that if the story doesn't confuse the fuck out of you and make almost no sense then you are making shit up in your head to rationalize it."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,DukeDamn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:13:17 2015 UTC,"Kingdom Hearts 1 is very easy to understand by playing it. All gets explained and the core of the story is about three friends who get separated and how two of them deal with the situation.  Chain of Memories is a bit like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in concept. If you haven't finished KH1, you'll get lost in the story of CoM. It also sets up the scene for KH2.  Kingdom Hearts 2 centers around what happens when you get turned into a Heartless and what would happen if someone managed to return to human afterwards, with a lot of Disney thrown into the mix.  Thematically it's all very Japanese, but it's fun and the Disney nostalgia factor really kept me playing. I was also a young teen when KH came out. Replaying it now (in the KH 1.5 bundle and the KH 2.5 bundle), it's easier and cheesier than I remembered, but that happens to all games I remember from those days."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,elemlo,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:03:37 2015 UTC,You wanna know the overall man plot of Kingdom hearts I can literally do it in a sentence. Kingdom Hearts Xehanort saga is about a man trying to bring back the x-blade(said keyblade) and restart the keyblade war and bring back kingdom hearts by fighting 13 darkness and 7 warriors of light. That is literally the main plot.

rantgrumps,3dtpqd,newfite,3,Sun Jul 19 13:11:41 2015 UTC,"Dude, are you serious?  Saying that something is objectively bad is COMPLETELY different to disliking/hating it.  Hating/disliking something is a subjective (see: not objective) concept. Saying that something is objectively bad has nothing to do with your subjective opinion of it.   Ex: 'The Room' is a terrible, horrible, awful movie. That's objective, and I do think that. 'The Room' is also hilarious and my personal favourite movie of all time. That's subjective, and I also think that.  See? I acknowledge that it's bad, yet I love it. It's not hard to understand. I hate The Lion King, yet I don't tell people that it's a bad movie (objective), since I know it's a good movie objectively, I just say that I dislike it (subjective)."
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,newfite,2,Sun Jul 19 13:14:18 2015 UTC,What if he says    I hate the story   and actually gives objective reasoning for that?
rantgrumps,3dtpqd,newfite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:11:48 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand what you're trying to get at. A subjective opinion can have literally any reason for it whatsoever, there's no reason for disliking the story that could only apply to an objective line of thinking without applying to a subjective one somehow.  Arin catches so much flak simply because he claims his clearly subjective opinions to be objectively correct. He believes (as he explained in an episode of M64) that because Miyamoto has such a passionate opinion about games, he should adopt a similar policy, except his interpretation of Miyamoto's approach is completely misguided.  The thing is that Miyamoto isn't a conceited loud-mouth who is constantly on air, and he is only so clearly opinionated and objective when speaking about his own works (like when he panned Donkey Kong Country).  Arin, however, expresses his opinions as if they are 100% factual in  almost every situation and acts unbelievably passive-aggressive and snarky towards those that disagree. He then expects people to interpret his objective expressions of opinion as him staying true to his strong artistic and moral values. He expects people to understand an implied meaning that defeats the purpose of using objective and subjective language in the first place, and he acts condescending when they (logically) don't.  Miyamoto has a strong set of artistic values and morals which he is so passionate about that he wants people to see why he holds them when he is asked about them, and when reflecting on his own work.   Arin, however, has to stop a conversation as Jon is explaining that OoT is a 10/10 game to him simply to scoff incredibly mockingly and let everyone know that he disagrees (""the fact that you even rate Ocarina of Time as 10/10 is mind blowing""), because (who could have guessued?) Mega Man X is 10/10 to him, while OoT is not.  No fucking shit, Arin, we know you don't like the game. Everyone has heard that opinion and given him so much shit for it because of how condescending he is when people don't agree with his subjective-yet-apparently-objective opinions."

I'm pretty sure Arin is aware he owes the people that watch the show a lot. It's simply the stuff no one likes that he's done has never gotten enough backlash to make him more careful. Also, everyone is complaining about the convertible thing, but they aren't all as expensive as they used to be and I thought Arin didn't want to say it was a convertible, for this exact reason.

I've seen a couple of the ""thanks everyone"" messages, and maybe I'm just too cynical, but they always feel more like he thinks he needs to say it instead of actual gratitude.  There's a difference in saying ""thanks for inviting me, but I didn't really like Ant Man it just wasn't that great"" and saying something like ""It wasn't the most amazing movie, but seriously it was pretty awesome just getting invited, thank you.""  A little connotation and intonation go a long way.  Even if he's aware he owes the watchers of the show, he's never really made that clear.  Like, look at any of Markiplier's x number of subscriber videos.  Part of the reason his fans love him so much is he goes to great lengths to make sure the fans know he cares about and appreciates them.  Even without going that far, like, Dan and Ross had that intro bit on their 2-year anniversary saying thanks for all the opportunities, it means a lot.  They weren't gushing and crying but they felt genuinely thankful for what the show has done for them.  I don't think it's asking for the moon to want to see Arin take 15 seconds out of his life to record a video, put away the funny voices, and just be thankful for where he is."

Ross and Danny have made countless videos saying how grateful they are or how awesome being on GG's is for them.  Jon has made videos thanking his fans and keeping people updated on his stuff.  But the only time I've ever seen Arin is when he's doing GrumpOut, TableFlip, a bit before episodes, or a commercial for merch.

A moment that has always stuck out for me (and I cannot remember the episode so apologies) was when Dan was talking about vacations and said something along the lines of not everyone can go on vacations. Arin just seemed so offended at the thought of not going on vacations and was just like ugh I love vacations, how can people not take them.

But when I want to enjoy some Danny I always have to deal with that piece of shit Arin. Can't he just retire with all the sweet grump money or something? It's not like he's bringing any comedy to the table..."
rantgrumps,3dt4vu,uss1701jb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:45 2015 UTC,"Arin, at the very least, used to be very humble. I don't follow him as actively as I used to, but during the Jon era, he and Jon were both very gracious with their fans in terms of gratitude for their support. Likewise, pre-Game Grumps, Arin was pretty humble considering how successful he was as an animator at such a young age.  I'm not sure if Game Grumps has scrubbed that aspect of his personality, or if he's still that way when he's off-mic or off-camera (or if maybe he just appears significantly less humble when he's standing next to Dan, who would make Jesus Christ himself pick him up and say ""Whoa...hey man. Give yourself some credit""), but at the very least, he has shown in the past that he is very capable of displaying humility."

He had a Wii Fit during the Dark Times, Unless he shoveled out the 50 (Yeah, they were actually 50 on eBay) he got extreeeemely lucky. Maybe a fan sent it, but remember, if someone did send it, he didn't thank them.  Really over-analyzing this."

By the time anyone who doesn't watch the releases obsessively even knows they are out, they're sold out.  The Amiibo market is 100% scalpers after 48 hours of release.  I have to buy her that shit on ebay for three times the initial sale price."

I blame myself for going into this thinking the Game Grumps would be playing fun party games (they're currently Drawful, a drawing-based guessing game, thankfully), but there has been quite a few lengthy moments of nothingness.  (Edit: Second multiplayer game started at 2:43 AM EST; Duck Game, which I honestly enjoyed watching on Steam Rolled)  Watching the majority of those on-camera looking at their phones was just sad. I don't think everyone needs to be checking their social media account(s) together."
rantgrumps,3dsngm,Bowblax,16,Sun Jul 19 05:20:26 2015 UTC,"I usually just lurk this sub (and love it, might I add), but this stream has finally brought me out of that state.  My first question is why are the members of a Youtube channel made popular by playing video games (+ Suzy) while making hilarious (subjective) commentary...not playing video games? (They have since played four games total)  The Wheel crap is just laughable. I don't understand why they would loophole it to back down from a challenge, and for a measly $100. That's all I'm going to say on that matter.  Three other things that irk me: Dan not being on the stream, Arin deciding that two double shots at $80k is a good idea, and Holly's pidgeon. Now, Dan not being on the stream, while acceptable, is confusing. Why have a Game Grumps stream if one half can't even be there? It just doesn't make sense to me.  On to Arin's amazing idea...well, it is was an amazing idea. (I'm going to cut the rest of this part, but suffice to say  Arin's ""I'll do shots at 80k!!!1!"" just didn't sit well with me.)  Lastly, the pidgeon. Not much to say, (cutting, summary: I don't like a bird on a leash, birds should be flying)  (Edited as the stream dragged on, was perturbed by many things)  Edits:    One day to spend $25 on a shirt ($5 extra compared to other 1shirt shirts), and ONE DAY for the community-developed artbook (to my knowledge), at $50... Maybe it's my frugalness, but I'm flabbergasted. Also, not a business major, but a week-long sale would be a much smarter, more-effective choice, no?     ""Who has the better subscribers"" -both Vernon(sp.) and Barry originally say Hot Pepper Gaming's-   Yep.    During the Baby Food Challenge, Mark gets Turkey and Rice. He guesses ""mexican food"". Suzy's pre-reveal response to that? ""You're close.""...I'm sorry...? She, of course, didn't even have to do it, because...because.    So this ""Jack"" character (their intern?) read some book at around $31k...Woo? Not setting [actual] stretch goals, probably a bad idea. Then Mark left. A shame, but I'd rather him get sleep.    They started playing Duck Game at 2:43 AM [EST]. Was nice, then Suzy reminded us for the six-billionth time that there's a giveaway. Ross started talking during her spiel to teach Kevin how to play, making for some great audio. Suzy later brings up near-irrelevant/irrelevant stuff (""Hahah, ducks are so funny"", ""my stomach's still-- [hurting from the hot sauce]""). I'm still glad they're finally playing a multiplayer game.    Around 3:30 AM:   ""I would like to play some more games."" -Ross   He seemed to be genuinely enthused at this point.   ""Hear me out, hear me out: this channel is called Game Grumps..."" -also Ross   Bloody genius. Then they started up Nidhogg at 3:41 AM.    They did a Table Flip tee giveaway. All five were XL...I have no words.    Some guy who donated left a hilariously-descriptive (and clearly sarcastic) challenge at Ross over the ""come at me"" stuff. Suzy's reply? ""That sounds real"" (paraphrasing). I'm confused if she understands what jokes are.    Impressions started (at bloody $50 a pop). Most were awful. Suzy's either terrible at even attempting impressions, or didn't try. Ross jokingly says he'll do an impression of Suzy being extremely racist. You can feel her get offended through the audio. Arin decided that clipping the audio three times was a good idea. Then Ross shoved the mic in his mouth (essentially). Just when he started being cool...  Oh God, everyone had to do an Avi impression. Suzy...Jesus Christ...I hope that that ends up on Youtube. I actually cringed. I rarely cringe.  Someone asked for a JonTron impression from Sonic '06. No one could do it.  There was also a marriage purposal via Arin doing a stupid voice. Alright then...    Still a gross mess of mostly over-showering praise and awkward (read: creepy) comments, while in Sub-only Mode.    In closing:  I just want to say that I have so much more respect for Mark after this. This is the bloody Grumps' stream, and yet he seemed to be the most engaging and entertaining. I absolutely loved him.  Danny didn't show up, but I didn't expect it of him, and honestly, I'm kind of happy he didn't. Save himself the embarrassment.  Just in case it's being misinterpreted (it seems that it may have been), I'm not against them doing a charity stream. I think it's a glorious idea. But the overall execution and content felt very poor.  Also, at this point, I feel the need to apologize for making this post so lengthy. It's going to be 5:00 AM 6:00 AM 6:26 AM when they/I finish, I've been having sleep issues as of late, and I'm in a criticizing kind of mood. /rant  If I'm overstepping a rule, feel free to let me know."

People are paying massive, MASSIVE amounts of money, and they can just chicken out for 1/5th of what they're asking their fans to pay up. Ridiculous. Mark constantly trying to help them and them making excuses why they won't do what he tells them, when he was introduced as being there to help. He had to argue them into tweeting about the goddamn livestream instead of being lazy and asking fans do spread the word for them, he ended up having to do it himself before they'd give in and also tweet about it.

rantgrumps,3dsngm,tundrazero,7,Sun Jul 19 04:41:56 2015 UTC,"True that. I pin insects as a hobby, mostly beetles, but a decent looking A1 grade (the highest grade) butterfly is anywhere from $1.50 -$5. Obviously there are rare, hybrid, and/or large butterflies that can cost $50 - $150, unpinned, but the kinds Suzy sells are cheaper end ones. She probably spends about $3 on her ones, though morphos (the shiny blue ones she always seems to have in stock) are a little bit more expensive, maybe $10 each.   The frames depend on where she's getting them. Individual shadow box/riker frames are about $10 each, ~but~ you can buy wholesale on sites like Aliexpress for like $2 each per frame if you order between 100 and 1000 frames. She's over-charging a hideous amount, you can buy framed butterflies like hers in my country for $30, which is about $20 USD. No framed morpho is worth over $100, for those prices I'd expect a hybrid or something really brightly coloured and rare (something like this)). It's daylight robbery."
rantgrumps,3dsngm,AllisonRages,2,Sun Jul 19 07:57:58 2015 UTC,Second this. I do insect taxidermy and I've been watching Suzy make a killing off these bugs -- Bugs that could be sold for 30 dollars being sold for 100. It's pretty disgusting and as far as her pinned insects go they're pretty basic. Some of her old stuff even had the beetles without legs / their legs curled under them.
rantgrumps,3dsngm,Panory,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:28 2015 UTC,"Really?! I never saw those beetles! Jfc, legs are like the easiest part. Maybe she tried but broke one or two of them, and just decided to rip the rest off. Also, do you find it weird that she doesn't actually state what kind of butterflies she's selling? I've never seen anybody do that before, like at the moment she's selling a male Papillio Memnon and just has it listed as ""Black Papillio butterfly."" It's really weird, and the only reason I can think of her doing that is so potential buyers can't search up and find their own specimens/find cheaper alternatives. And she doesn't list the quality grade of each insect either.  Like, I know every business marks up their prices, and she isn't lying about where she buys things anymore, but it doesn't seem ethical to me for her to sell her stuff at such high prices when she's specifically selling to her fans, who genuinely trust her and love her, and choose to buy from her rather than anybody else. It doesn't seem right, imo."

rantgrumps,3dsngm,MostRealestFoxhound,3,Sun Jul 19 04:12:38 2015 UTC,"You're right they'll never make 150k. I don't know how they would have. I didn't hear about the stream until this morning from a post made yesterday. Dan isn't there, so I'm sure people tuned out for that, and it really hasn't been that entertaining so far. Considering this is for charity, though, it'll suck if they don't make the goal. Honestly, this sucking I can't be mad at. I just don't care about live stuff. If Jon showed up I'd care, but they'd have announced that (I hope) in order to get more people to come.   Sleepy Rant: I don't know why, but everyone's getting pissed with how they're trying to get more donations and that just doesn't make sense to me. Like the whole ""I can't believe Arin will drink!"" thing. So what? He doesn't drink now because he isn't interested, not to be some kind of role model or some shit. They set a ludicrous goal and all I know is, even if they reach it, most people here are gonna be really upset. And honestly? That sucks."
rantgrumps,3dsngm,choosingusernames,3,Sun Jul 19 03:54:14 2015 UTC,"People are mostly upset because it's just a huge train wreck. It's awesome that they do a charity stream, it's just not well executed. They could've promoted and planned it way better. That there is no Dan doesn't help either."

But what I think also sucks is, even if they manage to raise 150k to help fucking veterans, I know people are gonna complain about how they did it. I'm really tired and partly letting out some of my frustrations with the sub, but basically, I don't expect the majority of people here to be happy with the way the result was reached, even if they do something great. Heck, 80,000 dollars would be impressive and people are already upset over Arin drinking. I don't know, ignore me."

But it just feels weird to me, doing something for the sake of charity. Not a fan of it, never have been. It's similar to people donating simply because there's a GG stream about it, so they can get noticed and ""appreciated"" for their over-the-top donations."
rantgrumps,3dsngm,MostRealestFoxhound,3,Sun Jul 19 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"I hate to say this, but the largest donations to charities usually come from people looking to get something out of it. Be it recognition, tax breaks, or just because it makes the donator feel better, it's an unfortunate thing. But I'm not gonna say thousands of dollars for a charity is bad, just because people had the wrong intentions for donating, especially if its as benign as ""senpai, notice me"""

In my high school years of ""reform"" (all the cutesy little phases, as well as diagnosed mental disorders, whatever else), I learned a lot about how the world really works, and this is sadly one of those ways.

rantgrumps,3dsngm,samsim1990,3,Sun Jul 19 04:13:29 2015 UTC,"Probably not. I just think it's interesting that the response to a charity stream is this much negativity. I mean, the stream sucks and everyone seems to agree on that, but most other posts everyone agrees on don't get this many responses. People seem genuinely pissed about this and I honestly can't bring myself to be upset at someone over charity. It doesn't help I'm tired, otherwise I probably would have just avoided the thread altogether."
rantgrumps,3dsngm,samsim1990,2,Sun Jul 19 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"I think the criticism of other things may be bleeding through, at least for some posts (probably myself to a degree, as well). For all my negativity, the cause is still great, and I would support it if I wasn't such a stingy douchebag. I think it's just that people have come to expect a much higher level of professionalism, and something to actually laugh at (it's pretty dry overall, in my opinion)."
rantgrumps,3dsngm,choosingusernames,2,Sun Jul 19 04:24:36 2015 UTC,"Eh, I wouldn't call it stingy. To be fair, it's best to do some research before donating anyway. I get that it's being poorly run, but most of the posts are saying the same thing and OP already said what was in most of the posts. I guess... This is a weird place to say it in, but after I spent some time on Vent Grumps, I never felt like people actually hated the show or anyone on it. Well, maybe a couple, but so what, right? Now I feel like a lot of people who frequent here and actually comment stopped watching the show a long time ago and hate it and several Grumps in particular. Maybe they deserve it, maybe the Grumps brought this on themselves, but as someone who still likes the show, this doesn't feel like a place for current fans anymore. And I think that's leaked into people's view of the stream and how they see every action the show or the people involved make."
rantgrumps,3dsngm,samsim1990,3,Sun Jul 19 04:33:15 2015 UTC,"Having at last made it into the 2014 episodes of Dan Grumps with minimal episode skipping I can finally honestly disagree.  I don't hate any of them except Arin and Suzy. I acknowledge their few good points. I dislike Kevin from the newest stuff I've watched besides my rewatch stretch.  I don't hate the show, it's just not Game Grumps to me. Steam Train is great unless Arin is on.  I like much of the non-main show content. I love Table Flip, I enjoy many of the Grumpcades, and Steam Train with the right people is still good. I can even watch Barry and Suzy content without turning it off.  I even love Danny at times, even if many times I consider him boring and not a good fit for Grumps.  I'm a fan of enough of the content, and enough of the Grumps. Disliking things doesn't make me not a fan or some kind of ""lesser fan"".  This stream is just bad, full of huge issues, and offensive to many people and professional streamers in many, many ways.  -- Jesus my internet died for like 15-20 minutes when I tried to post this originally...

I'd hate to lose one of the best fair conversationalists in the sub due to the circlejerk that occurs sometimes.

It could be only me who feels this way, but as I've said elsewhere, this place feels more and more like the opposite clone of the main sub and not in the way we want it to be. Almost like, this is a sub for the ""anti-fans"". Did Arin suck at videogames today, even if it was less than usual? Let's pretend we've never seen the show before and don't expect! I'll admit it's cathartic to some degree and of course we want it to improve, but half those threads seem to have people proudly declaring that they stopped watching some time ago. People have admitted to coming here, just for drama! Why? I know people hate this question, but if they can't stand the hosts and hate the show, why would they be here? It's clearly not changed in their favor for sometime and if a series comes along that they might like, they actually probably won't learn about it here, because that isn't what the sub is for. And here's the thing, I'm only saying this here, because I'm hoping I'll be largely ignored. Because I don't think there will be anyone who is going to give a response that doesn't depress me or make me wonder if I'll be labeled a main sub troll for thinking this place is going down hill."

I strongly believe that ross is the only one able to keep the show going.  My main deal with the show is Arin/Suzy (you could say they are one person).

rantgrumps,3dsngm,MostRealestFoxhound,3,Sun Jul 19 11:42:31 2015 UTC,"I think they went about the wheel of torture the worst way. As it is the onus of gathering $500 for a spin is on a single person, so fewer will bother. Which of course is what they were going for, because they don't ACTUALLY want to do the wheel.  They should have just done a spin every certain amount of total money raised to be honest, 1-2k would be fine and then more people would be willing to donate to raise it. Plus it would sting less when they chicken out of a challenge. Even though one they didn't do for valid medical reasons and another because it could be dangerous. Then why were they there at all..?

rantgrumps,3dsngm,shblimble,4,Tue Jul 21 00:03:59 2015 UTC,"Why don't they actually use the Twitch channel to, you know, play games or something? Most charity streams are oriented around what the streamer does normally (i.e. 24hr variety gaming, art commissions, playing requested music, etc) for a longer period of time than normal -- obviously with donation rewards, goals, etc. It's sad to see streamers striving for something, doing 400+ hour streams or completing insane challenges for $2000, while the Grumps just sit there and let the money roll in. ""I'll drink alcohol at 80k guys!!@!!"" I guess they're not just sitting there, but..  But they're just... I don't even know. It's like that one party that no one wants to be at. Just.. very painful idle chatting. It's not even podcasty so that I can tab out and do something else while listening.  They have 12k people watching them answer questions and complete challenges (or not) whilst money is being thrown around like a goddamn tennisball.  The nail in the coffin is the sub only chat.   Honestly, that's disgusting.  I watch streamers who get anywhere from 5k to 15k and rarely use sub only chat. Really, the only twitch streamers who have an excuse to always use it are those with numbers like Lirik (normally getting 20k+ with an enormous twitch fanbase with interesting gameplay, emotes, perks, etc). I could understand if the chat were spamming Jontron shit and GameGrumps memes, which would be expected, but I believe this is their third stream and I saw nothing of the sort before they were partnered. It's not as if Twitch doesn't have Moobot and moderation tools that can cleanly govern the chat for you."

The way he's talking, he sounds like he's kinda curious to try it and he's looking for an excuse to do it; after all, his single reason for not drinking has always been that he never cared to, but at this point he's had the straight edge image for so long he pretty much forbid himself from just grabbing a drink to just try it. 80k is a ridiculous amount of money that they'll never get, but it started as 100k (!!!) for drinking and he lowered it, clearly he doesn't mind. His mother chiming in to tell him he shouldn't was kinda embarrassing to be honest, it was his idea and he's a married adult man."

rantgrumps,3dv0tu,freddyjasonmyer,3,Mon Jul 20 04:08:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't say Arin can't shit on things, I'm saying it's silly the main sub has the attitude of ""You aren't allowed to criticize Game Grumps, a show that often criticizes other people's content"".  Personally I'm fine with Arin shitting on stuff, I just think we have the right to shit on Game Grump's flaws too."
rantgrumps,3dv0tu,Frankomancer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:43:24 2015 UTC,Ah. My mistake then. I agree with your sentiment.
rantgrumps,3dv0tu,strongredhold,2,Mon Jul 20 04:46:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with you whole heartedly! If you want to see a fantastic playthrough of Sonic Adventure, one that realizes it is flawed, but acknowledges both the great aspects of it and the huge amount of love it gets from its fans that they share, watch the Sw1tcher playthrough of it. It is funny without being childish, done without constant fuck ups, and done because they LIKE the game, not because they think it should be made fun of."
rantgrumps,3dv0tu,strongredhold,8,Mon Jul 20 06:42:50 2015 UTC,"There's good in all games, but Sonic Adventure DX is objectively a very glitchy experience. They're not viewing it through nostalgia, they're playing it today.  Don't take this personally, man. Internet."
rantgrumps,3dv0tu,strongredhold,3,Sun Jul 19 19:46:56 2015 UTC,"Clipping is a glitch. Saying you ""can expect it"" doesn't excuse it. You fly around, miss objects, go through things, those are glitches. They're not saying people aren't allowed to like the game, which most people seem to understand. They mean they don't see how people can defend the fact that yes, there are a ton of glitches."
rantgrumps,3dv0tu,herpblarb6319,3,Mon Jul 20 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"Nope. Just because you're lucky enough to not hit glitches doesn't mean they aren't in the game, that's what you gotta understand. I played this game a few months ago, and honestly, man. It's a glitchy game. Maybe not for you, but I hit a lot of glitches."

rantgrumps,3dv0tu,King_of_All_the_Land,5,Mon Jul 20 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"You are such a fucking baby.  You literally have no argument, Arin said the game is bad and from what I've seen from the episode (I played it a long time ago and don't remember much), it's pretty fucking bad. All you're saying is ""I liked it as a kid"", well who gives a shit? You might like it, but Arin doesn't, and your sole reason for not liking this episode and coming here to cry about it is because they made jokes about your precious misunderstood game.  Also, talk about circlejerks, ""Arin sucks at it game and blames it on the game"". That has not happened once in this episode, he died once to Chaos and didn't blame the game, then he died more to the glitches, which ARE the game's fault, so what the fuck are you on about. Not to mention the tired ""JON WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THIS"" circlejerk that this sub likes to beat."
rantgrumps,3dv0tu,Lime4Nine,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"Whatever man, I'm not trying saying it's a masterpiece, just that it doesn't really deserve that much hate as it gets because it was Sonic Team's first attempt at a full-fledged 3D Sonic game. It definatley has it's flaws. If anything, Sonic Adventure 2 is the better game by comparison. Not trying to start a flame war here."
rantgrumps,3dv0tu,freddyjasonmyer,0,Sun Jul 19 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"I get it, but I think people are forgetting that the Grumps are trying to run a comedy show, and so of course they'll put up a show and make it up to be worse than it is. The worst thing they can do is play an average game (which it is) and play it up as average."
rantgrumps,3dv0tu,Lime4Nine,4,Sun Jul 19 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"I mean without even playing it, on the title screen he just dismisses it as being bad, i mean yeah it looks like crap, but at least try to be clever for once and not just beat the dead horse that is ""sonic games suck LOLOLOLOL"""

Weird, I remember Suzy saying ""First and foremost game grumps was a show about friends hanging out and playing video games - when was being funny a prerequisite?""  See: http://flapflaps.tumblr.com/post/109644241092/want-to-know-how-sexism-around-video-games-effects  Obviously it's not a comedy show if one of the cast members says it isn't, right?"
rantgrumps,3dvuzt,AdrianMcDouchebag,3,Sun Jul 19 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's mostly that back in the day it was a pretty cool and decent game considering it was back in he dream cast days. Definitely hasn't aged well at all.   I haven't actually watched the episode yet though so I don't really have any real opinion, I just know the games at least a hell of a lot more playable than 06 when you compare when they came out."
rantgrumps,3dvuzt,Figgots,5,Sun Jul 19 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"They weren't treating thee game very fairly. Of course it has bad models and acting, it's a dreamcast launch title."
rantgrumps,3dvjzh,Acheros,7,Sun Jul 19 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"Man, am I the only one who actually loved her Huniepop? Didn't care for anything else on her channel but Arin's mild skepticism and Suzy's slowly transitioning to liking the game, was very enjoyable to watch, especially when she came in with flashcards towards the end. It just worked for me, and kind of mirrored my experience with the game. It's a more slower and relaxed play through though, and I understand that it's not for everyone, having played the game beforehand definitely helped me appreciate that series. And yeah sure she probably did it to get the hits, Game Grumps does this all the time it's not a problem with Suzy specifically, where this is different from say, FNAF is that Suzy genuinely grows to understand and like the game as opposed to using it as view fodder."

rantgrumps,3dvjzh,--Imhighrightnow--,5,Mon Jul 20 05:56:57 2015 UTC,"I found it to generally be boring after watching around a weeks worth of episodes. Had to give it fair chance. Though I did have some fun watching the two episodes with Ross and Suzy playing animal crossing.  The intro is awful. It's too long, doesn't fit to the format of the show, and doesn't reflect who Suzy is at all."
rantgrumps,3dvjzh,Rikard_Lund,2,Sun Jul 19 23:17:03 2015 UTC,"I've honestly never looked into KKG before, simply because I never really felt interested enough to check it out, but I went and took a look  after the comments about the intro. You weren't kidding. That's an awful LP intro, and it feels more like an Egoraptor creation than anything she'd make (because, y'know, that's definitely his animation, and his voice, even though we know Suzy 'meeperfish' Berhow is perfectly capable of making her own animation.)"
rantgrumps,3dvjzh,HireALLTheThings,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:02:06 2015 UTC,"A week's worth? Does that mean every video uploaded in a given week or like, 10,080 minutes?"
rantgrumps,3dvjzh,Sabertooth1000000000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:52:25 2015 UTC,I worded that a bit wrong. I watched each episode that was uploaded during one week.

rantgrumps,3dvjzh,TheFuzzyPickler,3,Mon Jul 20 06:14:15 2015 UTC,"Before I started disliking Suzy (I started disliking her due to her Etsy and found comments on the main sub she made that were flat out rude), I gave KKG a try. I watched maybe like 6-7 of the MH videos and I'm just like, ""man... this field just isn't for her."" And okay, I know it doesn't seem like you need a lot of credentials for Game Grumps but you actually do like be entertaining, have knowledge of the game, and play things that interest people. Suzy just isn't an entertainer and I know I couldn't do any better on Youtube but it just like, ""honey... ya gotta find a new calling for you. No more Etsy or Youtube. Be you, not what your husband is or getting into Etsy scandals."""
rantgrumps,3dvjzh,AllisonRages,0,Mon Jul 20 06:23:03 2015 UTC,"No more Etsy or Youtube. Be you, not what your husband is or getting into Etsy scandals.""   To be fair, I believe she did have two channels - mortem3r and meeperfish, one giving like...fashion/make up tutorials/advice and another was an animation channel - which were decently popular.  I think the problem is she lives in a god damn echo chamber, she does not hear criticism anymore and she has a legion of tumblr feminists and white knights telling her how awesome she is and how everything she does is super awesome and successful and she can TOTALLY do a lets play serious if she wants!  but even with the grumps help she's only ever breaking 150K views on the FIRST VIDEO OF EACH SERIES. She's getting promoted on a channel with almost 2.5 million subs and she doesn't even have 100K...that's got to be a massive hit to the ego.  I'd almost feel sorry for her if she didn't decide to call anyone who doesn't like her a misogynist."
rantgrumps,3dvjzh,AllisonRages,0,Mon Jul 20 06:31:14 2015 UTC,"About mortem3r- that was the channel I watched her on aside from Game Grumps. As of early January/February of this year, she never did fashion/make up videos anymore. Only hauls and Lootcrate openings AND WE GOT TO MAKE SURE ""W/MY HUSBAND EGORAPTOR"" was mentioned because it will get more views.   But that's the thing, she quits on a bunch of stuff that she becomes successful with and I don't get why. She quit art (referring to meeperfish), she quit modelling, she quit college etc. Like, I feel she needs to take time and find out what she herself wants to do. Watch, she will quit Etsy and maybe KKG after a while, which I'm not saying YEAH QUIT WE DON'T WANT YOU ANYWAY, it's just a pattern I've noticed."
rantgrumps,3dvjzh,AllisonRages,0,Mon Jul 20 06:40:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly really can't say if you're right or not since I never really watched those channels, I just vaguely know of their existence and heard that they were pretty popular so I'll take your word for it.  but I noticed something similar with Suzy myself....I could totally be wrong since I don't know her at all, but it always feels like she's trying too hard to be something or someone she's not, nothing about her seems all that genuine ya know? her entire personality that I've seen feels more like a persona or a character than just..her. and frankly maybe that has something to do with it, she's never doing anything for the right reason so she ends up just quitting.  but who knows, I'm just some asshole on the internet."
rantgrumps,3dvjzh,AllisonRages,0,Mon Jul 20 06:44:56 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I feel, sure here I at a 2:45am typing this about some girl I never met but it's like with what we've been presented to, that's going to be my impression of this girl. I don't wish anything bad would happen to her, I'm really don't, but I just want her to stop scamming people, don't get on Youtube and make videos if that's not you're calling, and enjoy life. That's really my goal for anybody really... lol."
rantgrumps,3dvjzh,AllisonRages,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's just a vibe I've gotten from her since she first started showing up. The first thing I thought was ""...Wow, she's trying waaaay too hard to be ""super desu kawaii .""  and I kind of feel the same way about her ""gamergurl"" persona too, like...I don't begrudge people for not being into video games, or only being casually into them. But she does genuinely seem to know little to nothing about game design or philosophy, or even specific games that she claims to be really good at or are her favorite.  Remember the fucking Lion King fiasco? Arin and Suzy both hyped her up as being super fucking awesome at the game...and then she used cheats to win."

She then starts just doing co op runs with other grumps and it really showed how little she knew about the game, despite it being one of her ""favorite games"". She used maybe 10% of what you can do with an insect glance. It's like not knowing you can kick the ball in soccer or something."

They're good for the grumps thogh, they're a lot easier to record and to shit out, but they also don't understand that long series wither out in terms of views, so it's actually less profit for them.

The series is finally over and whatever comes tomorrow can only be better, imo. I hated this series. I did marathon a couple of episodes a while ago but stopped after episode 20 or something. It's the kind of series that I hate. The gameplay is not exciting to watch and you can't podcast it because they are reacting too much to what is going on. I did watch the finale because in all honestly, it's a lazy saturday and I have nothing better to do. I also was curious if I made a mistake by skipping this series. The first 20 episode and the finale did not convince me to rewatch this series anytime soon.  So, let's just hope that the uploader of the original footage gets some views out of it and that the Grumps will never touch a game like this again."
rantgrumps,3dr5y1,choosingusernames,3,Sat Jul 18 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"Actually they didn't say they got the True Ending in Rainbow Curse. They said the ending was depressing.

rantgrumps,3drc7r,Zergrump,6,Sat Jul 18 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have to agree with this. They don't really do stuff like this anymore, except for a Finale or when they forget the timer. They don't do many One Offs to anymore, either. Somehow it feels like if they did stuff like Goat Simulator or Endless Ocean 2 now, they would split it into multiple episodes. They would probably not do something like they did with Wind Waker either. Arin was so bad at that one temple, that they decided to spend an hour on one episode until he beats it, which was a great episode imo. Now they would just make 6 episodes out of it."

rantgrumps,3drc7r,Gazareth,2,Sun Jul 19 02:34:37 2015 UTC,"You're someone who's very good at engaging in an intellectual discussion to get the conversation to go where it needs to go, and I love reading your comments for the eye-opening moment when it dawns on me that I may be wrong.  To your most recent post, however, I'd look at this comment by Avelrah. It's not that quantity is better than quality though; part of the emotional throughline of an episode is that sense of Damn, Arin's been at this for most of the episode. Is he going to make it? And knowing that now, it doesn't even matter if that tension is resolved is pretty frustrating.  Furthermore, in that Monopoly episode, we ended up with this gem. The video is an animation, but even in the context of the show, I laughed waaaay too hard. Quality can be as simple as something like that- listen to how relaxed and natural Arin is, and how mellow Jon's response is- ""What a horrible affliction!""  I think the quantity was increased just for the sake of keeping the channel itself interesting- it would have been much less interesting tuning into Monopoly 3 times that week. There's very little variety in the Grump daily lineup now.  All that said, though, the Game Grumps have really optimized their own workload for profit- with the exception of finales and a couple outliers, episodes are generally between 10 to 15 minutes, and having two long series at the same time means a recording session only has to be two games if they want to record for both game grumps series. They still do one-offs occasionally, but some of the series that should have only gone on for one episode have gone on for 3+. I feel like a good example of that is Suzy/Barry's food game; that could have been ultimately more entertaining were it a one-off that left room for other varied content throughout the week."
rantgrumps,3drc7r,geddypasto,3,Sun Jul 19 07:29:31 2015 UTC,"You're someone who's very good at engaging in an intellectual discussion to get the conversation to go where it needs to go, and I love reading your comments for the eye-opening moment when it dawns on me that I may be wrong.   Wow... thank you. That's very touching.  My turn to be wrong though, huh? ;)   To your most recent post, however, I'd look at this comment by Avelrah[1] . It's not that quantity is better than quality though; part of the emotional throughline of an episode is that sense of Damn, Arin's been at this for most of the episode. Is he going to make it? And knowing that now, it doesn't even matter if that tension is resolved is pretty frustrating.   I see where you're coming from, but that might not be a consistent rule. Arin may have just been in a bad mood or something. I mean, we once got an episode where Dan was in such a bad mood that they just ended it at 6 minutes. I bet no one saw that coming, and I think it's very unlikely to happen again after the backlash.   I think the quantity was increased just for the sake of keeping the channel itself interesting- it would have been much less interesting tuning into Monopoly 3 times that week. There's very little variety in the Grump daily lineup now.   This is a good point. And maybe they aren't focusing meta-quality as much as they need to.    The thing is, with the questions in my last comment, I was alluding to the line of thinking that: if they treat this as just a day job, they aren't really looking for ways to innovate, or spice things up, they are just looking to pump the minimum content out and leave.   Now, they might find that offensive; we know that they are all very passionate people, who have a ton of creativity inside them, but I can't help it -- that's still the first thing that comes to mind. The second thing would be that they are just too busy. I am pretty certain that Dan values NSP more than 'Grumps, and they've had the new album coming out, and doing the 6969 video, meaning he's probably been busy all over the place.  I don't have any other theories, off the top of my head right now, but I think the point is: those two scenarios suck; it seems like the show is just being ignored/neglected, at least to some extent.   I feel like a good example of that is Suzy/Barry's food game; that could have been ultimately more entertaining were it a one-off that left room for other varied content throughout the week.   How many other episodes would have been more entertaining as conglomerations? I don't think ""Ultimately more entertaining"" is really a good indicator. I'm sure much of the fans would prefer at least an average of 45 minutes or so of content a night. How do they tell... what metric should they use to discern when episodes should be grouped?"
rantgrumps,3drc7r,Gazareth,2,Sun Jul 19 10:25:03 2015 UTC,"Dan's involvement in so many musical projects does potentially make it difficult to hunker down and record a lot of content for the grumps, and there is the possibility that he's burnt out by the time he gets there. Arin values the show too, clearly, but I think his approach has changed too much to the point of treating it like a typical LP channel.  Either way, though, there is definitely the sense that the show is not a priority to the people on it.  In regards to the question at the end, I'm not certain a metric is entirely necessary, but a decent one exists. I'm certain there was at least one straight week of Bloodborne and Rainbow Curse exclusively. Now, if that's how you approach LPs, then that's how you approach LPs and your subscribers are familiar with that upload pattern. On my channel (still fairly new but growing at a decent clip considering my mellow style of commentary) there's a huge difference in the ""popularity"" (or my perception of it) of one of my series based on 3 views vs 7 views. I also use a 4-day split with my content; each day is something different, but every day 1 is series 1, every day 2 is series 2, etc... My point with this is that we can use that metric to distinguish within shows what content is more interesting to viewers. Bloodborne garnered on average 250-300K views per episode. Rainbow Curse started out closer to 700K, but petered out to about the same level by the end. Longer series tend to peter out to about the 250K mark. That said, Link to the Past consistently got over 300K views, often over 400K. The one-offs they've been doing? Different story. Bishi Bashi Special? 811,572 views as of this comment. X-Men Mutant Apocalypse? 470,993. Mario is missing is doing well with 726,271.   Another good indicator, to which we don't have access as non-grumps, is the ""Minutes Watched"" metric, which can be combined with views to determine the average view duration. Yes, lots of people will watch a series in the background without paying attention. No, it will not fuck up that metric. Here's why: That 250-300K base level those grump vids were getting on those long series, that can be described as 3 groups.    The core fanbase who loves anything the grumps put out and watch it from start to finish regardless of how much they actually like it. These guys are the favorite subscribers of every YT channel because of their consistent positive impact. Those who clicked, then stopped watching. These guys are important because they can help you determine roughly where you lost their attention based on the lowered average view duration. Those who like the series and watch it most of the way through. We can verify the existence of this group because of Link to the Past's higher view count. The engagement metrics of this group will be higher than group 2, but these guys might be the ones who close the video when the end card comes up so 100% view duration is not assumed.   This metric can tell you a lot about successful videos and audience retention, but if there's a series going on that was entertaining, of course more people are going to watch every episode. If an episode crosses a line or gets too boring, there'll be view durations that are significantly lower than 100%. A one-off that has 800,000 views may have a lower engagement rate than one with 400,000 views, but the metrics are all there.  Sorry for the huge post about youtube metrics; my point is mostly that the means to measure their effect on their audience (and additionally their quality) is there, certainly... but if they, say, decided that their core fanbase gives them enough attention for them to make the money they want to make, then the only thing that matters is the quantity of their content."
rantgrumps,3drc7r,geddypasto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"So you are certain they are using every tool available? Because if the hypothesis — that GameGrumps is a secondary interest to them — is true, why would they be bothering with all that stuff?  And then, even if they do know what turned off users in a previous episode, that's not the same as being able to tell if the episode you're filming right now will do the same thing.   In OP's link, Jon essentially decides- during filming- that it won't cut it. That's kinda difficult to gauge. To have that kind of meta-awareness — especially when they've been doing the show for so long, and all the series' kinda meld together... I think that would be really dificult."

It really sucks. I may not like the Sonic franchise, but at least I've actually experienced it first hand. It's a shame knowing Arin will probably ruin the entire Sonic series for Dan, without Dan ever having played a single game. I just hope they never play another 3d Zelda"
rantgrumps,3duvfj,choosingusernames,9,Sun Jul 19 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"I would hardly say Dan is 'following blindly'. If this first 10 minutes was your first impression, you would think its shit too."

""Yeah this game has its bugs, glitches, and cheesy moments but its a pretty fun classic."" Then Dan would be more likely to have an open mind.  But since Arin constantly jabs at the game and plays horribly, it makes the game look bad."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,SuperSushiFighter,5,Sun Jul 19 18:53:47 2015 UTC,"I hate this too. While Sonic Adventure is and always has been my favorite game, I can admit that it's very flawed. But this is abysmal. He, to me, is trying to play the game like a Mario game, and that isn't how this game fucking works. I will concede that the man has a knack for breaking the game and finding all the glitches and issues with it, but that doesn't mean the game as a whole is bad just because he found a thing they unfortunately missed that almost no one else has ever seen. I just think this is ridiculous."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,MusicalDefiance,2,Sun Jul 19 18:56:49 2015 UTC,I am 100% certain Arin was on team Nintendo during the console wars because he still has that butthurt Nintendo fan boy this isn't Mario attitude.

I grew up with Nintendo and Sonic at the same time and while I leaned more in favor of the blue blur, I enjoy my Mario games too. But the point is the game styles don't mix. You can't play a Sonic game the way you would play Mario and expect it to work well. And that's what he does. Goes as slow as possible because he doesn't like going fast, and of course that fucks up the game because that's not how the game is supposed to work. Is it bad that he encountered that glitch? Yes, and it should have been fixed. But maybe if he stopped fucking around he wouldn't have discovered a glitch almost no one else has ever seen."

rantgrumps,3duvfj,SuperSushiFighter,6,Mon Jul 20 05:33:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. Just like Mario 64 and OOT are the clunky but classic first 3D games of their series.  This is easy hate bait for Arin though because 3D+Sonic=PureCrap.  I don't disagree that there are flaws but come on.

rantgrumps,3duvfj,Emperor-Nero,2,Sun Jul 19 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"Skyrim honestly has more glitches, and Sonic was released a decade earlier. It's sad that Arin can praise good glitchy games and then hate on another good not as glitchy game."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,georgie_exia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"Like I pointed out Arin has no clue what makes games fun or good and when he doesn't like something he tries every way in the world to justify his dislike by saying how it's bad. An example is the stream last night he said he hated Kingdom Hearts due to the complex story not making sense.  Yet he loves Bloodborne while many say story is not important to the game it clearly is and the lore in both run super deep. It is clear in Bloodborne from what I saw it is clearly trying to tell a very deep interesting Lovecraftian esque story and it does so poorly. Even by that series predecessors standards. Nothing means anything in that game you don't know why things are happening they just are. Which Arin clearly has some knowledge of the story which means he looked shit up and yet that is not a hassle,but playing the games is?"
rantgrumps,3duvfj,geddypasto,2,Sun Jul 19 18:56:10 2015 UTC,But then Arin doesn't care about story in games. So he's criticizing an element he doesn't give two shits about. He's sunk so low.
rantgrumps,3duvfj,VampTofu,7,Sun Jul 19 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"I, uh... I'm gonna have to disagree. Today was the first time I laughed out loud at a grump video in months... The last time was SM64, when Arin jumped off the end of the last level in an attempt to get a red coin. I remember the game being fairly buggy, but not as much as it seems to be for the grumps.  I also should mention that I don't really value Arin's opinions on the show, considering that they're often visceral, spur-of-the-moment comments that don't really accurately depict the content. Danny's so go-with-the-flow that I never really know what he's thinking about a game unless he sticks up for it or makes the first comment. I don't love that, but hey I laughed really hard today."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,geddypasto,6,Sun Jul 19 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, the episode was pretty funny, and the game definitely is buggy, even if stuff like what happened in the first episode shouldn't happen as much. I think there's just a lot of Sonic fans with nostalgia goggles defending this game--to which I'd just say let it go."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,VampTofu,3,Sun Jul 19 20:22:43 2015 UTC,"Well, they've got their reasons for disliking the episode, and I've got my reasons for enjoying it. OP isn't totally off-base, but neither is Arin.  Besides, this is a sub about complaining. I like to try and find the logic in every argument, and what it seems like to me is, on one hand you have Arin's argument that the game was released in an unacceptable state where it's absolutely fucking broken, then OP's argument that A, normal playthroughs don't fuck up as bad as Arin's, and B, the game isn't as bad as Arin makes it out to be.  Where I lay on that spectrum is that I enjoyed the game in my childhood, and it's definitely not as bad as Arin says, but it's nothing special. The series has potential to be interesting, because there's a lot of good material to work with. But hey, to each their own."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,geddypasto,2,Sun Jul 19 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely, I can see that. It's kind of the same case for Mario 64; it aged badly, but it was a fun game back then. And I honestly don't see the harm in joking about it. And if there's some really messed up glitches in the game, then they definitely should be able to joke about it. I get that a lot of people are going to be pissed at this series, and usually I'm not on the Grumps' side, but this is one I feel people should kind of let go."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,bolt892,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, god yeah. Mario 64 did not age well at all. And since I didn't have the opportunity to grow up with it, I never liked it all that much."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,VampTofu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:56:43 2015 UTC,"Mario 64 has not aged badly, it has aged like wine, I hate when people say it has aged terribly when the game is one of the few that lets you move however you want, it's such a free game, it has so many ways to go about, I don't think there's mario game that's as free as 64, another game even. It's just awesome to control mario in 64."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,geddypasto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:27:52 2015 UTC,"Really? I feel the complete opposite. In later games, Mario's control improved a lot (although occasionally he'd be too slightly slippery) the camera angles in the game would also be pretty annoying and stiff. I loved playing the game as a child but comparing it to these days, it's not as great and free. The feeling of freedom I think comes from how the levels look, seeing that you can walk up huge mountains with relative ease. Looking back at playing the game now, one of the best examples of how badly its aged was Lethal Lava Land. God that log level is frustrating as hell! The camera is impossible to move when you're on the moving platform where flames spit out, and the position the camera angle is at is perfectly wrong, it's impossible to tell where to avoid the flames. Which means you can get hit, which causes Mario to run, and then you'll fall into the lava, and tons of damage will be done. That does not feel awesome to control."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,Emperor-Nero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:54:30 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you enjoyed, but I personally didn't. Sure the game is glitchy, but an 11 minute episode (which will be followed by many others) of Arin saying ""Game's a piece of shit look at it, the first of a long line of shit"" and then Dan, with no better judgement saying ""Yeah, this game is worse than Sonic Boom"". I don't find it enjoyable, and if their going to complete it, its going to be more than 30 episodes."
rantgrumps,3duvfj,NintendoCapri5un,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:07 2015 UTC,"Oh god yeah, it'll be way more than 30 episodes. And having grown up with SA2B and SADX as games that I played in my early teenage years, sometimes extensively (5+ hours at a time) I will say I have never had glitches be anywhere near as bad as Arin did in episode 1. I have a hunch that he may have known about the glitch he encountered prior to recording, but I don't know for sure. The game itself was definitely fun in the context it came out. So was SM64. I don't play either of those games now, though.  I'm not gonna try to change your mind, though. You've got your reasons and I'm always content to disagree with people who have solid reasoning. That being said, were I not a gamer, like Dan, whose first impressions on SADX were what he saw in episode 1, I would likely have said the same thing; and that's not a bad thing necessarily. Sonic Boom came out over a decade after Sonic Adventure, of course they've improved the aesthetics and some of the mechanics. There's no way he has any idea what this game meant to a gamer in that era, and I can't fault him for that."

In the words of Nicolas Cage after finding out that the reason the other guy in the jail jumped him was because he had had a sex sandwich with that guy's wife and sister the night he was sent there, ""Wow.""

rantgrumps,3dr31v,whiteonyx981,8,Sat Jul 18 17:27:43 2015 UTC,He did not beat it twice. And the true ending fight is actually someone else they are watching that they ripped from youtube. Which is fucking terrible that around 1/3 of the episode is actually someone else playing.  Edit : Fixed
rantgrumps,3dr31v,DaLinkster,3,Sat Jul 18 17:26:43 2015 UTC,He beat his own game and he beat the Grump file. Arin beat the game twice.
rantgrumps,3dr31v,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Sat Jul 18 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"Which is a miracle in itself considering it's the type of game he'd normally hate, and he didn't even know how to play properly.  Also because his life is so sad he doesn't have time to play video games because his job playing video games, which would have made beating a Souls game outside of Grumps impossible for him if it were true."
rantgrumps,3dr31v,henrykazuka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"Why would it be the kind of game he would hate? I didn't play it or watched the series but I'm assuming it's a lot like Dark Souls. The game isn't full of text or tutorials, combat is paced by your actions, picking items is fast, they don't tell you where you have to go you just have to explore, the bosses aren't streamlined (you don't need the item of the dungeon to beat them). Those were his complaints on the Zelda sequelitis."
rantgrumps,3dr31v,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Sat Jul 18 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"""Where do I go, what do I do?""  ""Camera angle bullshit!""  ""Waiting.""  ""Grinding.""  ""Bullshit deaths!""  ""You're not told how to do anything contextually.""  ""The tutorial is text."" (He complained about this in Demon Souls)  The list goes on, the game meets countless criterion for Arin's school of bad game design, and he's made conflicting statements of love and hate for the Souls games in the past.  His enjoyment of freeroaming is a situation and unexplained mess, because more often he complains that there's no guidance in games or that he likes being given goals to accomplish so he knows where to go and what he's supposed to be doing.  I'm talking about all of his game critiques, not 'only' Zelda, though I believe at least one of those are in there."
rantgrumps,3dr31v,henrykazuka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:22:26 2015 UTC,"If you are waiting and grinding on Dark Souls (again, I haven't played Bloodborne) you are doing something wrong. Tutorial only lasts 10 minutes, after that you have to figure everything on your own. Camera angle, I agree but it's much better than the earlier 3d games/ broken games he usually plays on the show. Context and not knowing where to go have varying degrees, Dark Souls gives you plenty of options unlike Sonic Boom where there's only one path available.   Souls games are like the original Zelda (explore, get awesome items, story doesn't really matter, progress at your own pace) and the original Castlevania (enemy placement is bullshit, they always have the advantage) but in 3D. And he loves those two games."

I don't know if it's easier in BB or not, but I recall in earlier videos he clearly knew how to parry and that it allowed him to do a visceral attack. He demonstrated it to Dan (I believe Dan said ""Whooooooah!""). Honestly he probably just gets flustered in boss fights, or maybe he legitmately forgot about a mechanic he used to know how to do. Wouldn't be the first time."
rantgrumps,3dr31v,Kolby_Jack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:53 2015 UTC,"The difficulty lies within trying to parry in the first place, which Arin nails consistently. Afterwards it's just a matter of walking up to the incaptiated enemy, who is just lying there on the ground for a solid 3 seconds, waiting for you to stab him. I don't see how Aring can constantly fail to just walk one step to the front and then press a single button. He's done it at the start, but completely lost the hang of it. I feel like the visceral attacks in the beginning were just lucky, they only occured because Arin happened to be close enough to the enemy so that his button mashing randomly triggered the visceral attack. It seems he just doesn't understand that it's a matter of being close enough. I mean it doesn't only happen in boss fights, not even remotely."
rantgrumps,3dr31v,Panory,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, maybe after he tried and failed to do it previously because he wasn't close enough, he lost confidence in his ability to pull it off and just doesn't go for it anymore.   Well, no one has ever accused Arin of being good at video games. Can you imagine if he HADN'T played this game at home first? The series would be like 40x longer."

It's why I only got through about two to three episodes of Dan and Arin's Kirby playthrough, not Epic yarn, the other one. With Prince Fluff, I cant remember it's name.  As for Jon Era, I dont know, Im sure there was a series I didnt like but I cant think of one off the top of my head.

I haven't watched King's Quest of Kirby, so I can't comment there, I didn't even bother.  I disagree with Goof Troop and Sonic, I like Sonic because it shows how Jon Grumps changed with the passing of months, Jon and Arin changed a lot in that Series, specially with each other, but also has moments that are just gold. I like Goof Troop simply because it's early grumps and super nostalgic for me, as dumb as that sounds, it's also very funny, it's just two guys fucking around and generally being happy about what they're doing, it's the essence of Game Grumps for me."

Also, Bloodborne. Bloodborne is a game that should be saved for actually decent Youtubers, like Super Best Friends. At least half an hour of recording, they make progress, and skip lame shit like farming and drawn out boss fights.

The original run was strenuous but forgivable, but I consider when they tried to resurrect it to be one of the biggest mistakes them ever made.  I really hated Zombies Ate My Neighbors, the game itself just feels like it drags on forever, so even playing it myself becomes a chore after a while.  Everyone talks about Chulip like it's amazing and such a shame that they only did 3 episodes but honestly they couldn't add any comedy to it.  Chulip is a really messed up game, they weren't making jokes they were just commenting on how weird it was.  Chulip was the star of those episodes, not Jon or Arin.  Trauma Center I liked for the most part but by the end it got to be a bit much, thankfully the sheer awesomeness of the last few episodes made up for it in my mind (fuck Savato, seriously).  All the Pokemon games they've played just, didn't feel right to me.  I know there are a lot of good and memorable jokes in them, I like compilation videos or animations from them, but there's just nothing to actually comment on in Pokemon, and I always thought Grump humour was at it's best when they're riffing off the game instead of talking while a game happens to be in the background.  I like Danny and Ross Sierra games but I could never ever get into their Space Quest videos, but that's just a personal bias as Space Quest just isn't really my jam.  Sonic 06 I loved as it was happening, but looking back on it, trying to watch more than a few episodes at a time, just, wow...  The last 80 episodes didn't need to happen."

rantgrumps,3dp85i,LVL100Pumbloom,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"I don't care for any of the Leisure Suit Larry, Space Quest or King's Quest series. They're basically just walkthroughs with small jokes few and far between. Pretty boring altogether. Also, Bloodborne is just the worst series ever. It should have been a two-off. And Punch-Out Wii is lame. A lot of Dan stuff is hard to watch, really."
rantgrumps,3dp85i,idontevenlikeleddit,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:20:45 2015 UTC,"Dan era: I'm honest about this, I have trouble enjoying almost all of them so it'd be easier to list ones I do enjoy once I finish watching them all. For specifics of one's I've seen that I can remember... Wind Waker, Fire Red, Out of this World, SMB2, Epic Yarn, Punch Out, Mega Man 2. Does Bloodbourne count? Many people love it but I can't stand how bad Arin is at Souls games and doesn't understand them at all while claiming he's good and likes them.  Jon era: Donkey Kong Country 2, Super Star Wars, Aladdin. I can watch them, even laugh at parts of two of them, but I don't enjoy them as much as the rest. If it weren't for some of the gems in them I'd just skip them entirely, except Star Wars, I never want to watch that one again.  Edit: Oh, Super Mario Sunshine. Can't stand that series."
rantgrumps,3dps97,LilPhattie,7,Sat Jul 18 07:02:48 2015 UTC,"You gotta give it to em, for some reason the Grumps do really well with first episodes of (potentially) long runs.  I don't know what it is, but they tend to be exciting, funny, etc.    THEN you get to about the fifth or sixth episode... still looking for that magic to come back... and before you know it, it's episode 76..."
rantgrumps,3dps97,zakktravis,3,Sat Jul 18 12:36:32 2015 UTC,Agreed. The only time some of the magic comes back is when an unexpected glitch sets them off. Thats why Sonic 06 worked and Bloodborn didn't.
rantgrumps,3dps97,samsim1990,2,Sat Jul 18 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"Because the show works best when they're riffing on the game, and have actual stimulation and excitement relating to the game.  Every series that gets insanely tedious/boring (SUPER MARIO 64), is because the game becomes routine and lacks the initial material that they're given.  ""Episode four of Trauma Center?"", ""Sweet, I bet they'll have another unique character to build and some more gameplay concepts to joke about. I can't wait to hear another Dan story or something too, ya know?""  ""Episode 200 of Trauma Center?"", ""Sweet, I bet they'll talk about Gramps and his raisins for the ten-billionth time and then Arin will complain about how boring the game is and how he wishes it was over already. I really hope Dan has a story to distract me from this trainwreck.""  Sonic '06 is a perfect example of a rare exception that works as a long series, IMO. As /u/samsim1990 said, the random elements of that game gave them consistent material, which was actually provided by the game, to work with. An unexpected glitch or a shift in gameplay work, while boss #20 doesn't necessarily work just because it has wings unlike the 19 before it.    If they actually play through all of Galaxy, i'm 99.99% sure that it will either become extremely bland when compared to these first few episodes, or it will be another train-wreck on the level on Naughty Bear Ep 1 and the dark times of Super Mario 64 when even the main sub was agreeing with us about how terrible the quality was.   The charm is lost, to say the least."

rantgrumps,3dps97,TheFuzzyPickler,4,Sun Jul 19 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"There's a rule of thumb with Arin.  If it's 2D, it's good. If it's 3D it's bad.  Why? Because 3D games can't be designed to support the same style as Mega Man X.  You basically have to ask yourself: Is Mario Galaxy Mega Man X? No. So it's shit."

Then again, Barry is more under Arin's thumb than Ross since if he doesn't have a job at Game Grumps he doesn't really have anything to fall back on. I don't think it's a dick move as much as I think he's trying to keep Arin sweet."
rantgrumps,3dmjn8,PoloJuice,5,Fri Jul 17 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"Some might say that the real fall out happened between Barry and Jon. Arin possibly took the fall for Barry. Or we just assumed Arin is to blame. But without the truth, we'll never know."
rantgrumps,3dmjn8,samsim1990,2,Fri Jul 17 15:59:53 2015 UTC,"That always kind of bothered me, that everyone always assumed that Arin is the one to blame in the whole story. Jon decided to move away and focus more on JonTron and yet people always act like Arin did something that pushed him away. Why? The only questionable thing Arin did, was saying that Jon doesn't want to be mentioned and Jon said he doesn't mind. Other than that, I never undestood why Arin was the one to blame. For all we know, the fall out between Arin & Jon was because Jon decided to leave on such short notice and Arin was pissed, because they already planned for the future (Steam Train). That's of course just a theory but it's just as likely as the ""Arin fired Jon"" theories out there or the ""Jon hit Suzy"" bullshit."
rantgrumps,3dmjn8,Tom_Dynamite,2,Fri Jul 17 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping to see them both in PBG's next Hardcore, but for the most part I don't think it means anything bad.  There's just been nothing that fits both of them to lend to collaboration lately. That or either of them have been too busy.  Also since moving I don't think they're quite as good friends anymore, because people drift apart when they move. They're probably still friends, though."
rantgrumps,3dmjn8,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Sat Jul 18 00:37:14 2015 UTC,"Good points.  I was hoping that when Kevin came aboard, Barry would have more time for side projects with guys like Jon, but nothing came up yet.  I am definitely rooting for them to do something together like the old days.    Side note, whenever theres a Jontron question asked at a GG panel, Barry is always quiet and let's Ross and Danny answer the questions.  I hope this isnt something intentional and that I am looking way to much into thus."
rantgrumps,3dmjn8,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Sat Jul 18 06:06:23 2015 UTC,"Well Barry is pretty quiet in general, and we don't know much still, but I like to hope it's not dislike and that they're still amiable.  For the opposite he might be quiet about it because he feels strongly in some way supporting Jon and just knows not to comment on Jon stuff for his own sake.  Apparently they talk about Jon in Finding Teddy but I haven't watched it since I'm finishing the game myself right now."

When I said collaborate I meant it in terms of producing, which is the definition of the word.  What I am saying is awkward is that Barry was Jon's longtime friend and he basically turned his back on him to work on Game Grumps.  The fact that hes working on Game Grumps is the awkward part."
rantgrumps,3dmjn8,Tom_Dynamite,0,Fri Jul 17 16:49:19 2015 UTC,"What should he have done, drop everything and move to New York to continue working on Jontron, or stay in LA but quit Grumps and have no job? They're old friends, yes, but we're talking a move, almost literally, as far away from home as possible just to work on his show, when there's already a stable job in Game Grumps."
rantgrumps,3dmjn8,TheValkuma,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:21 2015 UTC,You are assuming way too much.  I never said that Barry should do any of this.  You are also assuming that I want Barry to continue working with Jon.  What I am saying is how it is awkward how the situation ended up.   Lol the downvote is not used for when you disagree or don't understand what I am saying.  But feel free to do so if it makes you feel your argument seems any better
rantgrumps,3dmjn8,AllisonRages,0,Fri Jul 17 19:57:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with your statement is, that you automatically assume they aren't friends anymore. Everybody believed Arin & Jon hate each other until Arin (or Jon, not sure) stated that they are on good terms and go for lunch, whenever Jon is in town. Barry & Jon might just do exactly that but don't make a big deal out of it.   Also, why do you assume it's Barry who turned his back, if they are actually no friends anymore? Might as well could've been Jon who told him to fuck off. We don't know if they are still friends and if they are not, we don't know who did end the friendship. Could also be mutual, that they just grew distant from each other.  Your comments probably got downvoted, because it is just a theory and it's one sided. If you really want to look more into this, you need to be more objective. There are thousands of possible reasons why we don't know anything about their status as friends. That they aren't because Barry turned his back on a long time friend, is just one of them."

It's like a second tumblr over there.  Nowadays, everything has become about ""feelings"". Don't hurt his feelings or her feelings, people are trying to remove the physical aspect of everything nowadays. That's why biological gender ""doesn't even exist"" now, it's all just the media and culture that forces us into false gender roles! And hey, jokes are just as dangerous and bad as punches! Basically people's skin has become so soft that it's not there anymore, we're not physical anymore, we have been reduced to these lonely, vulnerable mental clusters that can break by someone farting in its general direction. Farts offend me. I'm not even some ""Y'all just pussies! MERICA"" type of guy, I'm just sick of being surrounded by these single child sheltered faggots."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,FeierInMeinHose,4,Sat Jul 18 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"Well they are taking improv classes. Maybe, aside from the more PC attitude a lot of internet folks have, they're just trying to make more observational humor and such instead of relying on cheap, edgy ""jokes."" Sure, Arin screaming the N-word at the top of his lungs was hilarious, but it was kind of a one-time thing. While I'll support offensive humor, it has its limits, and I definitely don't believe you need to be offensive to be funny.  Also, when they do the occassional apology for a joke, it's usually part of the joke. At least I've never heard them actually stop the comedy just to be clear they had no intention of offending anyone. It's always been jovial and light-hearted, and sometimes ridiculous."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,thegooblop,0,Fri Jul 17 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"What do you mean observational humour? It's an audio show. Unless you mean like when someone in the game has their mouth open and they do that ""AAAAAGGHHHH"" joke. You know the one, when they make it seem like he's screaming. You wanna talk about overused jokes, well just take a look at that one.   Edgy would imply they are being offensive for the soul purpose of offending, and no... that's not humour. And they've never really done that. I'm just saying the offensive jokes they used to make felt more real. Where as the jokes they make now sound like they know their restrictions, which goes onto your next point about offensive humour having limits. and, sorry, but that's frankly a load of bullshit. There can never be limits on something like humour, that's how you kill humour. Of course you don't need to be offensive to be funny but you can be, and it does work, and there's nothing wrong with that.   Personally nothing 'offends' me. I find that word kind of weird actually. I understand it, you got upset by something someone said. but I always think it's the responsibility of the 'ofendee' to just move away and ignore what the 'offender' said. As long as the offender was not just trying to be mean for the sake of it (aka Edgy). And a joke is never made to upset anyone, it's made to make people laugh, and if it upsets someone the they can just not listen to anymore jokes by that person. That's how I think it should work at least.  But these days people are going around saying they are offended, and that's not their problem, it's everyone else's. and everyone else must change themselves in order to not offend anyone. That's what I think happened to gamegrumps.   As for your last point, I totally disagree. They have definitely stopped what they have been saying before in order to just make it clear to all the delicate little snowflakes out there that they aren't really racist because they did a Chinese accent. They just don't seem like themselves anymore to me, or maybe they changed and they are being themselves I dunno. But you can't argue against the fact that the humour of the show has undoubtedly changed since it started."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,FeierInMeinHose,3,Fri Jul 17 20:37:51 2015 UTC,"Jeez man, so many words. I was just putting in my 2 cents, no need to throw a book at me.  Yes, by observational humor I mean they see something funny or with the potential to be made fun of, and they joke about that. Maybe it's not always the most hilarious thing in the world, but it's got more longevity than coming up with jokes that have nothing to do with the game.  When I said offensive humor has its limits, I mean it can only go so far, be used so much, before everyone stops finding it funny. Not for being offensive, but for being predictable. A few seconds of a goofy asian accent is funny, a full episode of it is lame.   The humor has changed, they've gotten older, they've seen the effects of their show, they connect with more people, not to mention Dan is a much more mellow guy than either Arin or Jon. That's just life. Nothing stays the same for long, least of all comedy."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,thegooblop,2,Fri Jul 17 23:29:08 2015 UTC,"ya sorry about that I have a tenancy to go on  bit. I'll try to refrain myself this time.   Yes, by observational humor I mean they see something funny or with the potential to be made fun of, and they joke about that. Maybe it's not always the most hilarious thing in the world, but it's got more longevity than coming up with jokes that have nothing to do with the game.

A few seconds of a goofy asian accent is funny, a full episode of it is lame.    sure jokes can run dry but it's not like game grumps often make these kind of dark jokes. If anything they make way too many tame poop and butt jokes and not enough ""offensive"" jokes. That's why I liked the infamous trigger warning episode. They made a genuinely funny joke for the first time in ages and it felt like a real convocation.    The humor has changed, they've gotten older, they've seen the effects of their show, they connect with more people, not to mention Dan is a much more mellow guy than either Arin or Jon. That's just life. Nothing stays the same for long, least of all comedy.   What effects of their show? How does their show affect anything? Also just because they have more larger fanbase doesn't mean you have to change your style of humour.   I guess I feel like it all just seems too tame now, hardly any of it makes me laugh anymore. and that's not because I only like ""offensive"" jokes, I just don't think they are very funny now in general and part of that comes from their self censorship and the overall tame, almost family friendly nature of the show.   oh and don't get me wrong, family friendly stuff can be great, I watch kids cartoons like Gravity Falls and it's pretty funny without any dark humour. but gamegrumps just seems like something that should not be tame, because it didn't ever start off like that.   Edit: I tried to refrain, honestly I did, but I just can't help going on about stuff haha!"

That was all there in the Jon era but not as much. Over time it makes sense to me that they'd be much more concious of all the different people watching because they constantly meet more and more fans.   Also I wouldn't go so far as to call the show by the guy whose Playstation Profile name is Egofaptor and the guy who is in a band called Ninja Sex Party ""Family Friendly."" They say fuck like 400 times an episode. Maybe they've gotten tamer, but I wouldn't let my niece watch them with me. Well, I might, but that's because I'm a bad influence."

So I think your right, the sensitive community now doesn't do any justice but just prohibits language. Of course being obscene doesn't make the show any funnier, but being nice 100% of the time without any hard feelings makes the show feel less genuine and restricted."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,thegooblop,2,Fri Jul 17 21:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yes I just want to make it clear I don't think humour has to be offensive to be funny. It's just like you said, it feels less genuine and more restricted as to what is ""allowed"""
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,reiIy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:07:09 2015 UTC,"They've done it twice, iirc, once was very reasonable and once was stupid coddling bullshit. When they went on the extremely detailed rape description while playing the princess game, it was perfectly fine because rape can cause PTSD, and a show that's usually fart jokes and observational humor suddenly going down a very dark path means that some sufferers of PTSD who may be watching would be triggered, in the clinical sense, by the graphic language. The suicide shit in Trauma Center was unneeded, it wasn't dark humor and it was very surface level bullshitting that went on."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,reiIy,0,Fri Jul 17 20:57:16 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I was unaware that they did it twice! I didn't watch Trauma Center, but yeah that sounds like utter shit.  However I do have to disagree in that even the first time it was kind of stupid. Because if you are that easily triggered that whenever you hear a rape joke you go into a PTSD fit, then you shouldn't be on the internet at all, in fact you should seek help about trying to get over that. but browsing the internet is NOT something people that unstable should be doing, and if they stumble across something that does send them into a PTSD fit, it's kind of their own fault for doing something that could cause it in the first place. It shouldn't be the responsibility of the content creators to make sure no one gets upset, offended and yes, triggered by their content. The joke was not even that bad. If people get triggered by something as minor as that then I don't know how they survive in the real world. The world of tumblr might be all kind and cuddly to them, but in the real world you can't just censor/warn people about every joke ever. That just makes jokes less funny. Imagine if someone was about to tell you a joke, but then they said ""Oh wait, this joke involves this and that and it might offend someone, are you sure you want me to tell it?"" It would just ruin the moment.   I dunno, I just can't stand people who get offended over jokes, nor can I stand people who get 'triggered' over joke. It's really unfortunate if that does happen but it's their own damn problem and we shouldn't have to pander to them."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,pitsupatsu,5,Fri Jul 17 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"whenever you hear a rape joke   See, that's my problem with your opinion. It was not a standard rape joke, it was extremely dark comedy with very vivid details. I'd also say that the internet is not some weird dark corner of the world where graphic depictions of rape are commonplace, especially not on Youtube and specifically never before on Grumps.  Also, you're saying that it's their own fault for stumbling into something triggering, which I agree with, but you're also forgetting that the Grumps can be empathetic to those people, and try to stop them from having their PTSD triggered in the first place.   Basically, it seems like you're not taking the stance that the Grumps shouldn't have to put trigger warnings, but that they shouldn't put trigger warnings regardless of their own opinions on the matter."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,FeierInMeinHose,4,Fri Jul 17 22:54:13 2015 UTC,"You're making a slippery slope fallacy, here, though. We've only seen trigger warnings twice, and they've always been at least kind of related to actual PTSD, as opposed to self-diagnosed tumblrSD."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,BA_McGrizzle,-3,Fri Jul 17 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"It isn't a fallacy, I've provided proof. The fact that Trigger Grumps exists is proof that they've wiggled their way into the Grump fans.  The exist right now, and as other comments in this thread show the SJW types get top comments on a lot of the Grump's videos. Even if the Grumps ignore them completely now, they've fed them once so they'll never leave unless the Grumps do something drastic like make constant rape jokes and spew hate-speech."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,CultureBuff,3,Fri Jul 17 23:48:28 2015 UTC,The fact that anyone can make almost any blog on tumblr means that the Grumps specifically are going down the SJW route? Really?
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,thegooblop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:53:38 2015 UTC,"That isn't what I said.  The fact that there are ""TriggerGrump"" blogs on Tumblr AND top rated comments on Grump videos from the SJW/Tumblrina crowd is absolutely because they were invited in when the Grumps became ""Trigger friendly"". This shit didn't happen when Jon was around because he believed in telling good jokes, not unoffensive jokes.   The Tumblrina crowd wouldn't be here if the Grumps didn't give them the first step of what they want. The Grumps already have some hints of going further, like how Suzy posts on her Tumblr about how ""This is how sexism effects me"" when someone criticizes her, even when they don't mention her gender or sex."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,choosingusernames,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:28:34 2015 UTC,"Nah, SJWs have liked Grumps long before the trigger warning stuff, dude. Arin is pretty left leaning when it comes to issue like gender and shit, and Suzy is even more so. I'd say after Dan joined the show was when we started getting more of the tumblrites joining the fandom."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,thegooblop,0,Sat Jul 18 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but we're in a different position now. If at first the Grumps refused and said ""We're making the show WE want, if you don't like that it's fine but we won't change"" then they wouldn't have any real ""power"", for lack of a better word.  The fact that the Grumps said ""Yeah, put a trigger warning, just give them what they want"" means they know they can complain about the Grumps over and over again, and there's a chance they'll get results. That didn't happen when Jon was here. Jon said he doesn't care about offending people, I believe he used an analogy about how blind people can get offended but he'll still make blind jokes."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,Acheros,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:17:30 2015 UTC,"Wait does Suzy actually do that? I think I hard that once before but it always seemed like a joke to me. That's crazy... and that must be it. Suzy is very clearly a Tumblr feminist/SJW and that must be what's making the show so PC these days.   Also I pretty much agree with what you've said here. I think Jon definitely has the mindset of ""I'm gonna tell a joke and if you don't like it fuck off"" where as gamegrumps have the mentality of trying to tell the least offensive jokes so is not to scare off their audience.   Overall I think Jon's way of doing it is much better for comedy as a whole as, like someone else said on here, humour should know no bounds."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,CultureBuff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:38:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the things you thought were jokes are actually true. She likes to make those ""please pity me"" tumblr posts sometimes, and there was a big stir when she made one about how sexism affects her in the Game Grumps.  You might have heard the quote ""When was being funny a prerequisite?"", which is a direct quote from Suzy in response to people saying they don't think she's as funny as the rest of the grumps.   ""We make a show for fun, to have fun. Why make it about something else?""  Is another quote people didn't like, since the show was about making money from day one. If I remember correctly Arin and Jon had all the paperwork and legal work done before they even started the show, so it was never just ""to have fun"". That's before you mention Suzy joined well after the show changed from what looked like a few friends having fun into what is clearly a business now.  She also made a big SJW speech in Plants Vs Zombies, something about how GamerGate is all a bunch of terrible people who only pretend to care about legitimate journalism."
rantgrumps,3dnu6h,SmallRhino,2,Sat Jul 18 10:36:21 2015 UTC,"okay, like.. you might think that stuff like that is useless for you, but for people who have eating disorders and come to the internet to distract themselves from how a basic part of life is hell for them, or for people with obsessive cleanliness who come online for the same thing, warnings are just a nice thing to have.  i know a lot of people try not to cater to everyone, but for the ones who do, it makes others' lives a hell of a lot easier and it doesn't hurt you in any way. it's not like it's plastered in their videos anywhere, anyways. it's just a tumblr that likes looking out for others. chill out."

rantgrumps,3dnu6h,SmallRhino,-4,Sat Jul 18 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter how bad you consider the joke to be, it's still a god damn joke and anyone who gets into a PTSD fit over something like that clearly is not a normal person and is very unstable. Honestly I don't think there are many people, if any at all who got ""Triggered"" by that joke.  The internet may not be ""some weird dark corner of the world where graphic depictions of rape are commonplace"" (eh it depends where you go) but it's still a place of freedom of speech. and if simple words can hurt someone that bad I suggest not even going outside, or on the internet or anything at all because clearly they are in no state to be doing so. The worst that words can do is hurt people's feelings, and that's all the trigger warning was for, so it didn't offend the delicate little flowers at tumblr.   Maybe it was their own choice to put the trigger warning there but I honestly doubt it.  gamegrumps have made all sorts of similar jokes before without the need for a trigger warning. Remember that time Arin talked about how he wanted to fuck a girl and then throw her into the grand canyon? My stance is that trigger warnings are bullshit and no one should use them even if they want to, because they are a stupid idea based on such a marginal minority group who, like I've said, are so unstable they might as well just do nothing."

I had a girlfriend with BDD once, she had a psychologist, a psychiatrist, a nutritionist, and had to go to a mental health facility five times in her life due to super unhealthy behavior. She also had me, who was the one one to get her to stop using vegetarianism as an excuse to eat less and start enjoying food again with the support of her nutritionist.  When you have cibophobia no one supports it, it's not something you are gentle about with people, the only way to cure it is to force it out of the system and make you crave food again. You don't normalize the fear, you expose them to it in controlled and normal ways to help their brains develop positive coping mechanisms and develop rational positive memories and patterns associated with it.  If any of these people actually are triggered by food, then trigger warning are supporting their disorders, justifying unhealthy behavior and basically killing them, damaging any hope of them recovering."

I also find it interesting that your re-edits probably had a higher ""editor joke per episode"" than Barry's episodes. Just think how little time an episode takes when there are no editor jokes.  How long would you estimate syncing A/V would take?   (Also, watch out for ads. Don't want another ""EGORAPTOR IS OFFICIALLY THAT GUY"" situation.)"
rantgrumps,3dk128,sirjaimes,8,Fri Jul 17 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"Something important to note is that OP took two hours to make two episodes with jokes in them. Not every Barry episode had jokes, and not every episode needs them."
rantgrumps,3dk128,uss1701jb,4,Fri Jul 17 00:54:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is denying that he has a decent workload, but my point is he should've known that and been qualified before he got the job."
rantgrumps,3dk128,Nikolaki8,2,Fri Jul 17 06:27:34 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure /u/sirjaimes point is that one hour of editing work per episode is about three hours of work a day. Most people don't really consider that much.
rantgrumps,3dk128,NovaDeez,4,Fri Jul 17 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"If you create 6-7 in a day consistently, you could basically not work for two weeks a month by stacking up edits days in advanced.

rantgrumps,3dk128,LVL100Pumbloom,3,Fri Jul 17 04:06:49 2015 UTC,"I disabled ads, and the videos are not monetized. Helps?"
rantgrumps,3dk128,TheePsycicSparrow,6,Fri Jul 17 05:15:42 2015 UTC,"The video she claimed wasn't monetized either. It was an excuse to claim it.  Edit: On top of that I've had two claims myself for music that wasn't even in the videos I made, the videos weren't monetized, had no ads, and I had to remove them because my disputes were ignored. So it doesn't actually matter. The only way to be actually safe from bullshit claims is to have the backing of an MCN, since they have legal weight via a equally significant law team to claimants and the backing of large corporate names."

Also Suzy likely won't even see the video, and she's the only one to ever file a copyright claim from the Grumps to my knowledge.  I was just scooting some information about what Suzy did and how claims still don't need to be justified, only that the claimant has to supply proof of copyright ownership in order to make claims in the first place."
rantgrumps,3dk128,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Fri Jul 17 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, I really enjoyed those! It's like I forgot that it was a re-edit; you really captured the essence of Barry's comedic style while also putting in your own style. Nice work!"
rantgrumps,3dk128,Avelrah,2,Thu Jul 16 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"Your analysis syncs up pretty closely with what I guessed, and we're not even factoring in all the time saving factors they would have. Those would even likely be able to account for the time used popping in the intro and outro presets, slapping the game footage over a static image preset, and account for audio syncing twice since these are all things that take less than 30 seconds each. You could probably squeeze another small animated text edit in that time. The end edit time would be between 30 and 45 minutes for an average episode with multiple jokes. An episode with no jokes or maybe simple popup dialogs would take maybe 15-25, I give it a wide berth to account for minor issues.  It's not surprising to me, I had originally come up with my numbers by reducing the time I estimated it would have or had taken me in the past by half. I figured that was fair since I've got decent experience but nowhere near as much as either of them at this point.  I tried to explain before (weeks ago) how watching the footage and paying attention to find cues and funny places to add an edit was the single most time consuming part for the type of editing they do and that's basically what you show here. Rewind edits can take around ten minutes, and that's exactly why they're uncommon; they're the most time consuming kind of ""common"" edit. Flashbacks would also be time consuming to an extent that's fully reliant on how good their note taking and documentation as editors is, though.  If Kevin works 8 hours a day, he should be producing around 10-15 completely (by completely I mean at the least no big mistakes) edited episodes per day as a professional, accounting for breaks. The rendering would happen over the next few days and only need checked on a couple times which could be done by anyone at the office. So my question is how many days does he work a week considering the performance of the job he's doing?  Likely the same as the rest of them, one maybe two."
rantgrumps,3dk128,TheGreatfulBread34,3,Thu Jul 16 23:57:56 2015 UTC,"""If Kevin works 8 hours a day, he should be producing around 10-15 completely"" your math is wrong there-- I think realistically he would produce maybe 5-6 Max a day with edits (3+), and maybe an extra 2-3 IF NO EDITS. 10-15 videos a day would be like a work horse editor"
rantgrumps,3dk128,TheGreatfulBread34,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:23:43 2015 UTC,"Even if we assume he only edits 6 videos a day in 8 hours and assume 40 minutes of editing per episode average, where are the other four hours of the work day going? Even giving him an hour per episode leaves two entire hours of work time not doing anything, which is triple the break time many office workers get.  Keep in mind the amount of edits you added is a rarity even by Barry's standards. Most episodes were simply put together right, sometimes a few static blocks of text in the corner from Barry ""talking"".  He doesn't have to sit and watch it render or upload so that time isn't part of the work process.  I should add I used 8 hours just because that's the standard work day for most people, it's doubtful he works a solid eight hour block, because yeah that'd be tough, but it'd be hard to take things seriously if he was only working a couple hours a day total and acting like it was a shit ton of work.  Edit: Likely he splits his work into a couple hour blocks multiple times a day is what I'm saying. He could probably fit two to three episodes of editing in per block minimum if he's serious about the job and not a slacker.  Edit 2: I just realized what you're saying. I'm not implying his actual work schedule is work work work as fast as he can, I'm saying it's the fastest he could produce it if his work was constant, sorry about the misunderstanding."
rantgrumps,3dk128,TheGreatfulBread34,3,Fri Jul 17 03:29:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see. It's possible, and another factor is that you can watch the footage at X2 speed and easily understand if any edits are needs (I didn't do that here because I felt that's not what Kevin/Barry might do, but it's another time-saving editor trick).  Ultimately, I think most subscribers would love quality work with consistency and fewer uploads, instead of shoddy work at breakneck speed. Maybe?"
rantgrumps,3dk128,geddypasto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:19:56 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely. I think everyone would be perfectly fine if they cut back down to two a day uploads, and their videos would likely get more individual views this way. All they'd have to do is make sure there's weren't any technical issues as well as the occasional reminder that Kevin is there through a funny quip in static text every so often and an little edit with effort behind it in a single episode at least once every seven to ten days.  I think the problem is that they do take a lot of time off, they are pretty honest about it sometimes, so they have to play catchup constantly when they are actually working, to the point that they likely have to make a week to month backlog to account for break times every few months.  Fundamentally it's a problem of disorganization in the entire business that causes problems for more than just the editing. The editing problems are likely a 30-70 split between being Arin and Kevin's fault for multiple reasons.  Edit: Thanks for the rational discussion, by the way. Much respect to you and much respect to the work you did."

There are some who are quite slow and don't realize many opportunities, others don't know much about pop culture or internet humor, and of course those make lots of small mistakes and don't learn to be more careful.  On top of mastering these skills (speed, opportunity, knowledge, standards) and editor ultimately PICKS UP THE SLACK of the production process- if something is not going well or just doesn't work, it's an editor's job to make it ready to ship.

Do you really feel like you're being deprived of content just because she's in it? 3 videos a day, 2 of which are guaranteed Suzy-free except on Valentine's day. I don't find Suzy that funny either (Barry I'm 50/50 on), but she's not a plague that's taking over the entire channel. She's in like 5% of all content."

By my rough count, there were about 85-90 GG/GC/ST videos released in that time. So videos with Suzy actually make up only THREE percent of the videos released in the last month. And she doesn't appear in ANY the month before that.  Your hatred of Suzy on the main channel is irrational. She's BARELY there.

I don't recall watching an episode in which she did not make the episode worst or even neutral.  I don't watch game grumps to hear Suzy scream or complain about losing.

Having Arin cohost for 3 seasons with interchanging cohosts like that would feel like a real big ""Fuck you"" to the fanbase. That being said, that's the scenario that I see happening.

rantgrumps,3dknl4,rpgworm,2,Sat Jul 18 02:14:05 2015 UTC,"I'd have to second what Geddypasto said, including with regard to your well thought-out posts. I'd kind of like to see Dan leave, if it's to pursue music, or something else he can derive more pleasure from than GG. I do think that if he left, Arin would replace him with another one of his friends, because Arin doesn't strike me as the type of person who is capable of coming up with a new formula/breaking the mold, at least not with GG.   If I had to guess, I think he'd offer it to Mark, or another existing LPer who has a decent following. Losing Danny would be a severe blow, and the moment it was announced, people would be unsubbing like crazy. Danny is 80% of the reason people stick around, and he's most people's favorite Grump. That being said, I think Arin would go after somebody with an existing following so they'll come over to GG and replace the fans they lost. I don't think Mark would be interested, but he's a nice guy who'd want to help his friends, so if they did go into variety-hour mode for awhile, it would probably be a lot of Grumpcade ft. Markiplier.  Whoever would replace Dan would have to be somebody Arin is friends with, obviously, and if they're another Youtuber, somebody who is willing to basically throw away their own channel, which most people probably wouldn't be willing to do. I think looking at Table Flip guests they've had in the past, somebody like Stamper or Spazkid (except not Cory because he's busy with art I guess), could be brought in. Somebody who is funny, and has a presence, and who Arin has chemistry with. (EDIT for this part: I forgot to add that Cory and Stamper couldn't be replacements because they have SleepyCabin, which Arin could probably actually join if GG went bust, so he certainly could live off of animation that way, I guess.)  I also don't think the show would end if Dan quit. I don't think Ross would stick around without Danny, I think he'd be next to go - in fact, I could picture him leaving before Dan does, 'cause idk, I just sense that he isn't into it anymore, except for during Grumpcade when he's playing with guests. Regardless of whether it's income or not, I can imagine Ross splitting anyway. He doesn't strike me as the type of person willing to put money before happiness, and he already seems fed up. One can only take working with people who call you an idiot everyday for so many years, I suppose.   Barry, Arin, Suzy and Kevin - until he gets made redundant or whatever - would stay, because it's income. The channel would never just end, I can't imagine Suzy letting that happen, because like you say, she needs the money for her store, and so she can have her hobbie LP channel, and basically do nothing. No offense, Suz', but for real. Arin would hold on right till the bitter end, because money and his pride. Barry seems content, and Kevin needs a job.   All that said, I actually can't picture Dan quitting. He's too nice, he would't want to do that to Arin or the fans. It would have to be one of those things where you're unhappy for a long ass time, but you stick with it so you don't cause anybody any trouble. Which sucks, because Dan doesn't deserve that. If/when he does leave, it will have been a long time coming.  At the end of the day, whether Dan leaves soon, later, or never, GG cannot and will not go on forever. I think when it ends, it will be because viewership has dwindled to an all time low, Polaris will drop them, and it just won't be financially viable anymore. Videos will stop coming out as frequently, till eventually they stop altogether, and that'll be how Grumps ends. ""Not with a bang, but a whimper."" I hope Dan (and Barry and Ross) get off that sinking ship before the channel goes bust, I wouldn't like to see them dragged down with it. :\  Strayed a bit from your original question there, but in summary, if Dan did leave, it would be the beginning of the end, or at least would speed up the death of the channel. He'd be replaced and they'd lose subs left right and center. I hope he doesn't leave, I honestly think Brian is joining GG, which would be awesome, but in saying that, everything has to end eventually, so when/if he does leave, I hope he makes it out safely and in time."
rantgrumps,3dknl4,Neiljackandjimmy,2,Fri Jul 17 11:00:39 2015 UTC,"You guys are too flattering :)  Yeah, i agree. Especially with Dan only quitting when it's been a long time coming. Your also right that Game Grumps probably won't end on a high note. I can't remember one popular Youtube channel who did. They just slowly fade away until nobody really cares anymore and that's probably what will happen to the Grumps. They can only hope that at this point, they have something else to rely on.   As for replacement. Markiplier could really work. Same as for one of the SleepyCabin guys. Overall, it has to be someone well known and that they share a good chemistry with."
rantgrumps,3dknl4,Avelrah,2,Fri Jul 17 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dan is going to leave anytime soon, unless his band explodes and he won't be needing the game grumps gig anymore (and I don't see that happening).   What might happen is that with his band partner around, they might go around in tours and such, after all, they have contacts with bands like Steel Panther, so I would be surprised if they score some opening gigs for the L.A bands  But leave game grumps? nah, all Dan has to do is to take a day of the week to record and then get back to his business, and Arin sure as fuck won't replace him, not after the Jon Headache.  Heck, that is probably why you don't see Dan anywhere else besides grumps, he is off doing his own business and if Ninja Brian is moving to L.A with a wife and kid, most probably is because they have secured a deal.  If I had to make a guess, is that, If NSP starts to getting bigger gigs to play and such, gradually Dan would be replaced with Ross, and Arin would start with ""Hey guys, Dan is out playing at (location) so me and Ross are going to grump here"" and that would be it."

He seems to have a lot less on his plate at the moment, compared to Dan who is trying to keep up the show and two bands. I think if Dan quit now, the channel would just fail. Fans would just get annoyed and leave."

rantgrumps,3dknl4,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Fri Jul 17 10:31:24 2015 UTC,"He'd probably try and get Markiplier to do one of the two free spots with him regularly, and maybe lose the third one altogether."

And if they actually did that, Game Grumps would probably become more successful than ever. But to be honest, I kinda liked Mark on Grumpcade with Arin. He gave Arin so much shit all the time, it kind of reminded me of Jon. I think he could be a good replacement."

To put it in perspective, as much as people don't like how often the Grumps vacation, apparently Jirard hadn't given himself more than a day or two off for several years until after the Sonic 06 review after which he took a ""vacation"" (he actually still worked during that time, just significantly less).

rantgrumps,3djshz,NyanVegito,10,Thu Jul 16 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly wish they had just had Dan as the interim NSG while Arin looked for a new co-host, instead of bringing him on permanently. The two have pretty much no chemistry (Arin has to force himself to be loud a lot of the time, since otherwise we'd just have two straight men), and Dan obviously can't handle the time commitment. If Arin had brought in a new guy with Jon's louder style within a month or so (and he has enough animator/polaris friends that it wouldn't be that hard to do), here's what we'd have.   Arguably funnier Game Grumps, with Arin playing the role he was used to and a new member that actually knows stuff about games and can play the funny man. Consistent Dan/Ross Steam Train, which continues to be my favorite current Grump pairing. Barry is still editing, as he no longer has to appear on the show (at least not nearly as much). Dan has more time to do music, as his grump schedule is halved. He'd also have time to actually appear in stuff like the live action videos and Guild Grumps. Suzy's appearances would be severely limited, probably to Steam Rolled and Valentines Day.   The only downside would be another person to pay, but considering the original plan was to have Jon on Grumps and Dan/Ross Steam Train, it probably wouldn't be too hard to deal with."

Seriously, that would be more annoying than anything else. Suddenly the entire fan base has to adapt to another new host, probably with accusations of Arin being a dick for firing Danny, however he leaves. Once Danny's gone from the show, so am I. I'd prefer that they just quit than rather than replace him"

rantgrumps,3djshz,Avelrah,8,Sat Jul 18 23:18:34 2015 UTC,Because Dan is pretty much the only thing that makes the show worth watching for a lot of people. Arin knows that. He knows that he's a distant third between Danny and Jon. So he would never kick him off if Danny doesn't want to. And let's be honest: Who would quit a job where he can work a few hours a week and make much more money than the average office worker without a good reason.
rantgrumps,3djshz,ryswag123,3,Thu Jul 16 22:07:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I just dont find danny that entertaining or funny. I really hope ross takes over gg fully or jon tron."
rantgrumps,3djshz,TheGreatfulBread34,2,Fri Jul 17 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"I do agree that he is running out of material, especially when his comments have nothing to do with gameplay.  At first I never really had a problem with him being terrible at games, especially 3d games, but after the mario 3d world series was released it sort of changed my opinion.  Him trolling Arin during the series was funny at first, but when that became is main contribution to that series it started to get pretty annoying.  It must have been at least 15 episodes in a row where all he did was troll Arin the entire episode.  His gameplay comments is basically repeating the same jokes over and over.  I don't know how many times he asked Arin to backtrack in a game just to make a joke about how something in the game looks like its making an ""insert joke here"" face.  Dan is definitely one of my favorite Grumps, but his input on the actual games they play is very lackluster."

I could see why people were upset when Jon left and then saw him as the replacement because Jon brought game opinions when doing it with Arin. Dan cannot provide those opinions because he just isn't as focused on it. I love Danny though, I think right now he's the glue to Game Grumps. I do find his stories interesting and think he is funny.

When Arin is doing terrible I wish that Danny would rip the controller from Arin's hands, play the level, and tell Arin how he feels about the game instead of just agreeing with whatever Arin says.

rantgrumps,3dfisu,Tom_Dynamite,2,Thu Jul 16 20:18:34 2015 UTC,"I'm mixed. I really love their Mario playthroughs. The 2D Mario series were all a blast to watch. Especially Mario 3 and Mario World had some of my favorite moments. Mario 1 & 2 were pretty funny short series. Mario Sunshine was the series, that made Dan my favorite Grump. 3D World was hilarious because Dan was just so fun. Him fucking with Arin and finally being the dick for once while also having a good time, was really awesome. Mario 64 was fine but way too long. Arin should've stopped after he had all the stars he needed for Bowser. He also should've stopped shitting on the game so much.   With that said, I'm just not sure what to expect. Arin doesn't like the game and probably just because it proves, that Mario games are still innovative. At least I can't think of a reason why he could hate this masterpiece of a game. He also managed to die on the tutorial and something tells me, that this will be a recurring theme. As pathetic as it sounds, he is just horrible at 3D Marios, which every 5 year old can pick up and play. I fear that we get a lot of ""This game sucks"" just because Arin sucks.   The episode itself was pretty funny, although the length bothered me. When half the episode is just them loading up the game, watching cutscenes and story, they can't just end it so soon. They should've finished the tutorial level. I did laugh at Dan's reactions to the dramatic opening and their Toad impressions. Those always get me. I hope Dan really does something as the second player. I hope Arin tells him, that he can also shoot and not just collect the starbits. Overall, I would've liked if Dan played the game. The main difference between the two is, that Dan always gets more invested. He really tries and doesn't blame the game for his mistakes.   TL;DR I'm excited and liked the episode, but fear that Arin will go full Hanson. It's a term I created for: Blaming game for own mistakes, while calling the game shitty for playing shitty yourself. Never go full Hanson."

rantgrumps,3dfisu,whiteonyx981,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:15:18 2015 UTC,"I remember him saying that he isn't too fond of it. 3D Land & World were the only new Mario games I remember, where he said he really likes it.   The difference with Bloodborne is, that he played it shortly before Game Grumps and also next to their playthrough. With Galaxy, I think it has been a while ago since he played it. As much as I liked their Sunshine series, I just noticed that Arin is really not good at 3D Marios. Time will tell. Like I said, Mario playthroughs are normally pretty funny."
rantgrumps,3dfisu,Malleyot,2,Wed Jul 15 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think Arin will have nearly as much trouble with Galaxy as he did 64.  Galaxy is miles easier than 64 was (at least in my opinion) and it doesn't have a lot of the weird camera bullshit that 64 did.  It's practically top-down perspective in some parts, which based on his views about Zelda, is probably a good thing!"
rantgrumps,3dfisu,StewartBonnett63,2,Wed Jul 15 23:00:07 2015 UTC,Man I really wish they'd lay off the Nintendo games a bit. Eventually they're going to run out of Mario games. Then what?

He routinely talks about how lucky he is to have the job he has so it's not like he even is complaining about it all the time.

If I had a job like that, I would go on vacation more frequently too. The same as I would buy myself some nice things. A classic volkswagen van, nice appartment with some nice furniture, etc. It's not like they pull a Brad Pitt and own multiple mansions that they never use or own private islands. They do work for every cent they make and while it is not a tough job like construction worker or having a stressful office job, it's probably still somewhat hard work. It's not like they don't do anything beside Game Grumps. Creative content is not easy to make. I learnt that from being a musician and I'm trying to write a book right now."

Nobody would care what he does with his money if he wouldn't try to convince people that the money he makes is not worth the amount of work, which is total bullshit. Sure, he sometimes says that he's lucky that he got this job, but the amount of effort he shows when it comes to making a quality episode shows how little he actually cares about the job."
rantgrumps,3dbxyv,Avelrah,3,Wed Jul 15 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"I think that when he talks about having a ""hard"" job he's either saying it as a joke or referring to the fact that he has to take care of all the business stuff that goes on behind the scenes. I agree that he doesn't always bring his A game to the show which kinda sucks, but if he didn't do all the hard stuff behind the scenes, the grumps probably wouldn't have a stable income from the channel."

One sub is blindly defending everything and the other is blindly shitting on everything. I got downvoted here for saying positive things about current grumps, the same as I got downvoted for a little bit of criticism in the main sub. I sometimes wonder if there are other communities with the same problem or if they manage to have a balanced community, where positive and negative feedback can exist without being split into two different subs."
rantgrumps,3dbxyv,Tom_Dynamite,2,Wed Jul 15 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. Even for Youtubers. Now, there are a few different factors in those places. Usually, one of the hosts doesn't leave without warning or explanation. If anyone feels there has been a downgrade in content, they can say so, though how the majority of the sub feels won't guarantee a positive reaction, as long as they don't personally attack the Youtuber, things are fine. And anyone who hasn't watched the show in a year because they don't like it anymore, stops any association with it"
rantgrumps,3dbxyv,choosingusernames,3,Wed Jul 15 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"Probably. The problem with our fanbase is that the grumps used to interact with us a bit, and after pulling so much shit and getting called out for it they stopped. Now everyone one the main sub silences any sort of negativity, hoping that they might come back, so everyone who had something negative to say came here (or Vent before it got shut down). But I feel like that negativity just got worse because of the censorship, and this sub also attracts people who don't even like the show anymore and pretty much hate everything about it."
rantgrumps,3dbxyv,Avelrah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:05:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly though, I think it is lame that Suzy & Arin don't visit because they got negative feedback. That was always a part of the internet and they shouldn't ignore something just because there is the chance of being criticized. There are Youtuber who are active for many more years and get way more shit than they do, for less valid reasons. Especially Suzy got a lot of deserved shit thrown at her. If it wasn't for Ross & Dan and the current Q & A videos, there wouldn't be much interaction with the fans anymore.   The mainsub ignores the fact, that Dan does visit on occassion and that Ross is very frequently visiting. Just because some Grumps don't visit anymore, doesn't mean they should ignore criticism when others still do. Those obviously won't mind some bad words, so why the need for all the censorship?  As with this sub, I also don't understand the people who don't watch the show anymore and still shit on it constantly. It would be like if I stopped watching a tv show after season 2, and during season 4 I make a thread ""The show sucks so hard"" What's the point? Just invest the time in something you enjoy watching?"
rantgrumps,3dbxyv,Tom_Dynamite,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"The bite sized episodes really help you quickly get a feel for how much you still don't like Game Grumps.  Just speaking for myself here. I watch non-main show content more than regular Grumps because regular Grumps is a chore to watch for me. I'm a fan of everyone but Arin, Suzy and Kevin. You really can't blame people for disliking and thus not watching the main show anymore with how much it's changed year to year."
rantgrumps,3dbxyv,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Wed Jul 15 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you at least watch some content and can build an opinion on it. That I can respect. If you'd say, that you haven't watched anything since Jon left and then go on how much current Grumps sucked, just based on a couple of episodes you watched in 2013, than your opinion would be worthless to me. I know it's a very internet thing to do, but hating on something that you don't watch at all is just pointless and I can't take that seriously. It's like some of those people just base their opinions on what they've read here, without even investing the time to watch the product they criticize.  If you still have some connection to the show or you quit in recent history, then you have every right to voice your opinion about the current product, since you have an idea what the current product is. If you don't have that, then your opinion is as worthless as someone saying ""I hate Star Wars"" without even knowing one of the movies. Just keep your opinion to the things you can actually have an opinion about."

rantgrumps,3dbxyv,SuperAnarchyMan,8,Wed Jul 15 06:10:40 2015 UTC,"I don't get why you think being bored is the extent of their worries. They have a huge number of fans, which means that their work every day is criticised by thousands of people. Pretending that isn't something that can cause stress is stupid. The sheer pressure of trying to keep thousands entertained daily would get to most people.  Even more than that, neither you nor I will know what it's like to have whole communities that are specifically formed to criticise what you do or say at work. The grumps know these communities exist. It's reasonable to think that they look at them at least sometimes, at least out of curiosity. You're telling me that it wouldn't start to bother you when there are 4 or 5 posts or comments a day on a subreddit about you calling you an asshole? People here even say, pretty often, that they hope Game Grumps fails and the show ends. You honestly don't think that would cause at least some stress or emotional reaction?   People always seem to complain that the show is now derivative, or forced, and that it ""doesn't feel like two guys talking playing video games"", but whenever they speak their mind about something you disagree with you hate it. It's a lose-lose situation for them."
rantgrumps,3dbxyv,SpazzyBaby,-1,Wed Jul 15 08:53:10 2015 UTC,Sorry I have to sarcastically put this joke.  [Dale Gribble voice] Grumps should fail and the show should end.  They mock the fans quite a bit themselves. Not arguing just pointing it out.

rantgrumps,3dbxyv,SpazzyBaby,3,Wed Jul 15 14:06:57 2015 UTC,"It does sort of ruffle my feathers when they talk about this stress they go through sometimes. As much as this pains me to say, it seems like Kevin has the most work out of all of them because he has to review the hours of footage for editing and then edit. They probably record a total of 12 hours of content for 3 series so that means Arin, Suzy, Barry, and Ross don't have much going on. Danny constantly takes trips for NSP so he's always gone.

Now, I'm assuming as part of their contract with Maker Studios they have to pump out a certain number of episodes per day/week/month. This means they've got to play through and record gameplay for a certain number of hours per week, and they don't have nearly as much free time to animate like when they first started youtube channels. These are two animators who first started out posting personal works and began earning a lot more money as Letsplayers on Youtube.  Compound that with certain vocal minorities bitching about them playing games badly, or complaining about the lack of animations coming out, and I'd probably be going into therapy or killing on the side."

rantgrumps,3df12v,ALorableTbh,4,Wed Jul 15 19:31:35 2015 UTC,"I gave KKG exactly one chance and did what one does on a lets play channel and chose one video to see if Suzy stood on her own merits. This is the video: http://youtu.be/R52eBi38GfA (I remember it well)  I chose it because it was in the middle of a series so I figured she would have had her groove, no guests to rely on So Suzy would have to stand on her own merits. Here are my observations (I briefly re watched for a refresher)   Repetition isn't insightful commentary Why would she dedicate a whole episode to such a boring side quest What a weird angle for a face cam and for her to hold the game Why even have a facecam  ... Not much happening maybe skip ahead she really is doing this for ten minutes what a big forehead   Then I exited out."
rantgrumps,3df12v,Grumplogic,3,Thu Jul 16 03:52:06 2015 UTC,"I couldn't even watch for more than 2 minutes and 6 seconds.  I can't have fun if she's not having fun.  Here's a short list of things I noticed personality-wise that don't fit well into the kind of LP she was doing here:   Her speech isn't natural. The pacing, tone, and inflection of her speech are a constant. The only natural reactions she gave in the time I watched was the look of frustration when she scared off bugs, but it seemed less  directed towards the game and more directed towards it interrupting her attempting to make commentary. She legitimately sounds like she's trying to talk to children, like very small children, with the tone she's using. The flatness of the one joke (I think it was a joke?) with the fruit beetle was so incredibly awkward.   I wanted to make a list of good things about the episode when I opened it, simply for the sake of discussion because I've never watched KKG before, but I honestly wasn't able to take anything good from what I was able to watch.  Except that Animal Crossing New Leaf is awesome and fits the image I have of her in my head in terms of games. But then that doesn't live up to reality so I don't know."

rantgrumps,3df12v,PaperPunch,4,Wed Jul 15 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"It sounds like Arin's forced jovial voice featured prominently in playthroughs of 2014 era. Like his marketer voice but you can still hear the contempt slightly underneath. Just so bad.   Also why is everyone (Barry, Arin, Dan, ROSS) a blobby cute cat but Suzy gets to be a ""sexy (to furries)"" cat?"
rantgrumps,3df12v,Grumplogic,2,Thu Jul 16 03:55:23 2015 UTC,"Your name inspired this:  What, she has to be an ugly little cute blobby cat like everyone else and can't be cute? Sexist. /s  That was a joke, in reality I would imagine it's a contrast to further show that she's the host and they're her guests. It may also be because she's a girl, part of me thinks this is pretty normal to do in that case, but I'd have to see what she does with a female guest.  Edit: Ah now that I've seen it I stick to what I said, but minus the guest thing, I thought maybe she had little guest bloops."

rantgrumps,3df12v,LVL100Pumbloom,2,Wed Jul 15 21:20:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I used to play this game as a really small child with notecards in class, we'd write the thing and a short list of words you couldn't say besides the thing. Everyone got a point if the person could guess, if they couldn't guess they lost a point but no one else did.  There were a few other variations of it, like teams, one on one, something like this where you'd have to guess as many as possible.  I'm not sure what Ellen DeGeneres had to do with it when they were talking in the beginning though, this game's been around since my parents were children and likely before they were born.  I never liked or played much Chrono Trigger but I'm surprised neither of them said ""Lavos"" or even ""Time Travel"".  This wasn't bad, it could have done with some soft cute music playing in the background... Dunno why that just sounds like what I'd do if I were her, because I think it'd fit really well and add the the quality.  My only real complaint besides little nitpicky things to increase the quality and atmosphere of the show (right now it looks, feels, and sounds like ""I'm bored at the office while my husband makes his show, why not make a show of my own in the other room?"" which isn't a bad thing to do, keep busy Suzy, but it doesn't look/sound/feel good aesthetically) is that this is game is the equivalent of solitaire to kill time for a group, and that's why you've seen people do it in lines at Disney.  Edit: I should add that I didn't watch the whole thing, just a round of each of them, because it wasn't very engaging to me. Doesn't mean it's bad, just that I'd rather go back to watching ZeRoyalViking's GeoGuessr playlist."

I didn't come to Game Grumps for heated debate on game design, but I also don't want to hear Arin complain for hours on end with no rebuttal, so it would be cool if someone on the show debated him"
rantgrumps,3dasnm,choosingusernames,4,Tue Jul 14 22:53:47 2015 UTC,"This is very well said. Arin's complaining isn't a substitute for entertainment; when he did it beforehand and Jon was on the show, they'd have a really interesting discussion on the ""why"" of those opinions. Sure, there's still entertainment in the series they release, but when Arin isn't complaining is where I find that entertainment. I guess he is the ""Grump"" of the group though."

If he said something along the lines for Sonic being ""I don't like the running fast thing because it messes with my eyes"" or ""I don't like the way the game is designed"" and not ""You just go and things happen"", he might be taken more seriously.  You can't challenge anyone's ideas on the main subreddit or with any of the Grumps yet they are ""open to discussion as long as it isn't mindless ranting and hate!!!""."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,henrykazuka,2,Tue Jul 14 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"I think he said that Sonic first stage is great, but then there's a lot of waiting involved or impossible to predict spikes which kind of ruin the ""gotta go fast"" gameplay."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,thehandsomelyraven,2,Wed Jul 15 12:13:08 2015 UTC,"to be fair, he has voiced far more nuanced opinions on why he hates sonic. boiling it down to, you just go and things happen is technically correct, but not all he said."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,Tom_Dynamite,7,Wed Jul 15 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"Isn't it well known that Arin has no clue about design? I even saw the main sub joking about this. That's why he stated once, when Dan said something about game design, that he has no clue even though he was always so confident about it."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,Avelrah,3,Tue Jul 14 22:30:22 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing: Why does he always have to be so confident about it? I mean, he knows that people think he's full of shit, he seems to know that he doesn't know anything too. So why does he act like he's a fucking authority all the time? It's one thing to notice your flaws. But when you know them and still act like an asshole without changing anything, that's when people start to dislike you."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,Tom_Dynamite,4,Wed Jul 15 16:25:10 2015 UTC,"I think he got too confident after his Castlevania & Mega Man sequelitis, which were honestly really good. People treated him like a game design genius afterwards and during Game Grumps, he thought he had all figured out, not knowing that what is good or bad for him, might not be actually good or bad for anyone. Combine that with being stubborn about strong opinions and you have Arin Hanson."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,Zandock,4,Wed Jul 15 16:36:10 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is, when Dan asked him what Bloodborne was all about he said, ""You just go!"""
rantgrumps,3dasnm,Avelrah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:46:20 2015 UTC,"No, but he also said that he likes how you have to memorize stuff to actually be good at Bloodborne.

rantgrumps,3dasnm,soundlurker,6,Wed Jul 15 16:20:22 2015 UTC,"I actually think Arin has matured on that regard. He was a bit of a know-it-all before the Zelda sequelitis was released but he's far humbler than he used to be due to the reaction that even included devs.   During his Egoraptor streams and even with Jon, he was super arrogant regarding game design. Heck even in the ALTTP series with Jon, I felt he was imposing his opinion on the guy.   This is how I saw his relationship with Jon when it comes to game design:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xcglnVRDgw  The thing is while he falls into that trap from time to time, I feel Dan doesn't mind because unlike us, he isn't super passionate about game design. You can see he actually gets into some discussions when it comes to music, rarely games."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,Avelrah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:12:50 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I forgot about that. I'm glad that his friends like Zach at least realize that Arin is like that."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,Hyperlingual,3,Wed Jul 15 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"I honestly think he's right about Sonic. There are so many parts where you might as well be on rails, and other situations where you can just be killed off by something you couldn't possibly see coming because of the small screen and high speed. Remember Jon's videos on Bubsy? It's like that but even faster, the only bonus being without insta-death. That's not much better if you ask me. It's still fun, but it still made so many valid flaws that Arin accurately mentions, so I don't think sonic is a good example of him being blatantly wrong or obnoxious.  As you mentioned though, the best example would be Zelda (in combination with his rants about conveyance in the Mega-man sequelitis) and Guild Grumps, I think.  [Edit: typo]"
rantgrumps,3dasnm,Emperor-Nero,11,Tue Jul 14 23:43:18 2015 UTC,"One thing that annoys me though is when he discusses conveyance in Megaman he then bitches when games do the exact same things as Megaman to teach you,but he is to dumb to get it and bitches about the game design. So really I think his love for Megaman X has nothing to do with how well it teaches you,but his nostalgia of the game,because he crucifies games for teaching in that way when he doesn't get it. So I agree there it annoys me to no end."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,SGCEO,6,Wed Jul 15 01:10:03 2015 UTC,"Mario 64  When you jump on enemies coins come out. Boos are invisible when you look at them but you can see coins inside them, showing they can be killed. Boos don't disappear if you sneak up or don't look, so punching from behind or back flipping with a ground pound are options. You HAVE to kill a Boo to get into Boos Mansion. Star is called ""Go on a Ghost Hunt"". Game starts with the Mansion in front with the doors directly in line with Mario while text says to ""come in. You have to kill multiple Boos to get Big Boo to appear.  Arin runs around outside the Mansion for ages and can't figure out how to kill Big Boo = bad game design."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,LVL100Pumbloom,5,Wed Jul 15 10:07:09 2015 UTC,"Context clues are bad game design, you should tell me exactly what to do without text by shoving it in my face so blatantly that I can't possibly miss it. If there is a single line of text in your game it's automatically horrible unless I grew up playing it. Also I should be able to do everything with two buttons no matter what the controller looks like."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,Avelrah,2,Wed Jul 15 10:12:10 2015 UTC,"2 buttons? I dunno, that's a bit much for Arin. He probably won't push the second one until he's halfway through the game and then complain that he missed an important feature."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,thehandsomelyraven,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"ehhhhhhhhhh. i think he's wrong about mario 64 as a whole, but saying that the boos are have coins inside them shows you that you can kill them is a little presumptuous and i think you're making a jump for the game. Actually until RIGHT NOW I thought they showed the coins inside to trick you into coming close so they can hurt you. Everything else I agree with though"
rantgrumps,3dasnm,SGCEO,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"It serves either purpose, the coin is a running theme through all the bad guys I always viewed it as a hint and the ""bait"" aspect was the reason the boos displayed it to begin with."
rantgrumps,3dasnm,MellowM1nds,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"One of his arguments in Guild Grumps was, ""okay, so I'm apparently doing nothing wrong. I just have to mash buttons and grind so that I can get bigger numbers, and then I'll kill him. It's dumb,"" is kinda true.  Although most RPGs are designed behind that philosophy, it kinda sucks to know that the only reason that you can't kill a boss is because you haven't grinded enough."

I thought everyone harshly criticized that video and in Guild Grumps his broken arguments are justified, Ross never explained that you aren't supposed to button mash and when Jesse Cox came into the show he told him he was doing a good job.  But yeah, the show could really use someone who goes against him. Danny only defends the 10 NES games he played on his childhood."

I wouldn't say Game grumps is the best place to have a ""game design"" discussion, and to be fair to Arin, I watched the Sonic 3 thing and he only commented on the game when it was asked of him, I don't remember he going into any ""this game sucks because"" rant.  Not to mention, Arin does not bode with opposition well, and that is not me saying or anyone else, the guy said it himself that he gets worked up, and when you are doing something to be funny and spend about 8 hours with the persons playing games and being jovial, you don't wanna go into conflict.  I remember in the early days with Jon, when the two disagreed harshly in something just for the next few episodes to have this weird vibe between the two.  Not to mention their co-hosts are not interested in engaging, Danny couldn't give less of a fuck and he doesn't really bother with games and such, Barry barely has a presence, Ross seems to know better and just avoids the headache, and guests like Jirard just act ""happy to be here"".  Granted, Arin seems to be more humble with pushing his opinion than before, something that borderlined bullying with Jon and a LOT of people were calling him out on that, but if that is truly a change of heart or just resignation from his recent backlashes, that is up to him.  But now seems like Arin just wanna be this goofy character that makes faces and chins and ""please don't pay much attention to what I say"""
