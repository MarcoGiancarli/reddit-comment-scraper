DrugNerds,3e31dr,under_cover_lover,4,Tue Jul 21 16:00:17 2015 UTC,"full text here: http://ge.tt/2hrpToK2/v/0  Also found this study:  ""Enkephalinase inhibitors: potential agents for the management of pain.""  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18855623  I'm recovering from opiates right now (8 days clean after using for 3 years up to 180mg oxycodone per day, and now withdrawal free) and I've been doing a lot of research on the EAS (endogenous analgesia system) to see ways I could help fix the abuse my system has been through thus far.   Took my first dose of 1500mg DL-phenylalanine today, on top of 10mg dexmethylphenidate, 200mg magnesium chelate, 3mg Lorazepam (prescribed for anxiety, taken daily), and residual effects of clonidine that are still wearing off from my detox 2-3 days ago. I feel pretty amazing but can't really tell what drug is causing what effects. However I will note that the dexmethylphenidate completely reversed the extreme fatigue I had from clonidine. That shit is no joke.   Really hoping there soon comes some better options for opiate addicts made from future drugs targeting the endogenous opioid peptide system, which I believe has a lot to do with addiction / depression / anhedonia in general (even non-opioid addictions)  EDIT: residual cold/hot flashes from opioid withdrawal syndrome (8 days clean) have gotten significantly better since dosing 1.5grams of the DL-phenylalanine about 2 hours ago. First dose I ever took, and I read that it's supposed to build up for a while before having a real noticeable effect. Placebo maybe? I should be feeling better on my own anyway given that my shit is healing now that I'm sober. But I feel content, warm and the throbbing pain in my left testicle has gone away. Added another 1mg ativan, feeling happy and energetic, no shitty come down (probably thanks to lorazepam!)  EDIT 2: now up to 2250mg of the phenylalanine, which i will not surpass. I just feel very calm and mellow. My hot / cold spells from opiate withdrawal are almost all gone since I've taken it this morning. Coming down from the dexmethylphenidate and getting sleepy fast. I will began to take it every day for about 2 weeks and see what's up then.  Here's a bunch of full texts about enkephalinase:   http://gen.lib.rus.ec/scimag/index.php?s=enkephalinase&journalid=&v=&i=&p=&redirect=1  The focalin has me researching all kinds of shit.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/523172  What knowledge/experiences do you guys have with this stuff? Specifically the racemic DL-phenylalanine but also the dextrorotary isomer alone D-phenylalanine? I'm really just interested in the opioid system effects."

DrugNerds,3e31dr,BarrelRoll1996,4,Tue Jul 21 18:45:40 2015 UTC,"I don't claim to be real well-read on this sort of stuff but here goes:  Seems that D-phenylalanine's purported ability to inhibit enzyme carboxypeptidase A (which degrades natural endogenous opioid peptides) has the potential to potentiate analgesia produced by traditional opiates via increased levels of these endogenous opioid system peptides binding at mu-opioid and u-opioid receptors that comes as a result from inhibiting these enzymes.   This basically shows that the theory of being able to boost endorphin levels with D-phen is likely correct.   This raises the question of how potent an enkephalinase enzyme inhibitor could be in therapeutic use for opioid recovery, depression, anxiety, and mental disorders linked to endogenous opioid system dysfunctions / deficiencies.   Remember the study is 15 years old."

FDA trials very often contradict previous trials.  I can't find the original source I heard this from (I thought it was a TED talk, but I can't find it on their site), but the gist of it was that even our best, most controlled studies seem to be subject to a fair amount of bias and sampling problems. That's why even though the media tends to hype every study, scientists don't really consider a single study all that meaningful. It is only when a large preponderance of studies using varying methodologies converge on a single conclusion that scientists start to take it seriously.

The study was conducted by a team of six researchers including Barbara Weiland of the Psychology and Neuroscience department at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and Brendan Depue of the University of Louisville in Kentucky.  The MRI brain-scan reports of 29 adults and 50 adolescents who use marijuana daily were compared with MRI scans of the same numbers of adult and teen non-users of marijuana.  ""Groups were matched on a critical confounding variable, alcohol use, to a far greater degree than in previously published studies,"" the abstract states. ""We acquired high-resolution MRI scans, and investigated group differences in gray matter using voxel-based morphometry, surface-based morphometry, and shape analysis in structures suggested to be associated with marijuana use, as follows: the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum.

DrugNerds,3dyt1g,roionsteroids,5,Mon Jul 20 17:12:54 2015 UTC,we provide evidence for a modest increase in human striatal dopamine transmission after administration of THC compared to other drugs of abuse. This finding suggests limited involvement of the endocannabinoid system in regulating human striatal dopamine release and thereby challenges the hypothesis that an increase in striatal dopamine levels after cannabis use is the primary biological mechanism underlying the associated higher risk of schizophrenia.   The title seems to suggest a more potent effect than does the conclusion of the abstract
DrugNerds,3dyt1g,proseidan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:44 2015 UTC,Title just says theres an increase in dopamine pathway activity.
DrugNerds,3dyt1g,Frank769,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it doesn't seem sensational to me either. It's more like ""hey, there was some research on this before, but not a ton and not strong enough. We did another study and it supports existing evidence."""
DrugNerds,3dyt1g,SlimSlamtheFlimFlam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:09:27 2015 UTC,"Much needed study. Cannabis is not as well known as we think it is. It takes years to obtain a government grant, and your study has to be of interest to the government. Then getting people to sit in and MRI and collect results take as long as a year and a half to two years.  Studies like this will make it easier for activists to have facts to back up their claims and rally people to their cause."
DrugNerds,3dyt1g,Frank769,2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty crazy how restrictive studies are on Schedule I substances. And kind of annoying in the case of THC, with Marinol--a purified enantiomer--being Schedule III. Though from what I understand one thing that fueled increased restrictions on Schedule I studies was the flagrant abuse of the relatively lax system e.g. by Alexander Shulgin (correct me if I'm wrong), which is sad, but understandable from their perspective."
DrugNerds,3dyt1g,SlimSlamtheFlimFlam,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"Alexander Shulgin's experiments are worth billions per book he published, his findings are absolute game changers in terms of novel chemistry. The government just took the bad that came out of his research and portrayed him as a drug kingpin in a very subtle way, tried to blame the popularity of the drugs he analyzed on him.  Regulations about the research being done in the drug world is hurting all of us. Limiting the amount of information available to the public is not a logical thing to do for it's protection and I wholeheartedly disagree that it's understandable to limit research in a life-saving optic.   The only logical explanation behind these regulations is the prospect of monetary gain. Only the richest corporations can now conduct those researches, develop life saving drugs and market them however they want because of a shitty patent that basically insures market monopoly (atleast for a short while).  When a miracle cure for cancer will be discovered, you will learn how much pharmaceutical companies believe your life is worth."

But I've got a feeling you were thinking more of the title.

DrugNerds,3dm1rx,faithcavendish8,2,Fri Jul 17 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"The combination of alcohol and an energy drink causes a subsequent increase in alcohol seeking behavior.   I find this highlight interesting. Since caffeine is a known dopamine releasing chemical and is addictive, it makes sense that frequently pairing it with alcohol could lead to additional alcohol seeing behaviour. I'd be curious to see if this effect still exists or is as strong for people that also consume caffeine without alcohol frequently."
DrugNerds,3dm1rx,metalsupremacist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:55:12 2015 UTC,"I'd be inclined to think that the regular caffeine enthusiasts would have an opposite reaction. The reason behind this is that they do not binge, but they stimulate their dopamine receptors in, often, a very scheduled way.   Addiction is very complex and what pushes you to redose is more then just the drug concentration in your blood and your withdrawal symptoms, long-term drug users do not react the same to the drugs they take then novices, the whole mechanism of action in term of dopamine release seems to evolve.  I think the addition of alcohol to their routine would take away from their zone of comfort and the behavioral changes arising from it would deter them from binging because it's an ""un-natural mix"", meaning that they would not be expecting to get drunk because of the ""caffeine-state-of-mind"" ruling over the drunk one."
DrugNerds,3dm1rx,Frank769,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:49 2015 UTC,Im more interested in the long term affects on motivation. It seems kinda obvious that alcohol alone would lead to motivation changes.

DrugNerds,3dltx7,bangingit,6,Fri Jul 17 08:57:06 2015 UTC,"This paper is pretty inconclusive.    In general, it's hard to measure oxytocin in blood.  If red blood cells break, you get false high measures. And we can't assume peripheral oxytocin measures are tightly correlated with central levels. So when they say ""While the underlying neurobiological mechanism is still unknown, it is suggested that peripheral oxytocin does not seem to be the main actor in this; potential candidates are the serotonin 2A and the vasopressin 1A receptors,"" they should also include central oxytocin as a potential candidate.  From rodents, we think that MDMA induced sociability is mediated by 5-HT1A-receptors causing oxytocin release.  Given the lack of safe selective 1A antagonists, it makes sense to try to block these effects with pindolol (which is a 5-HT1a antagonist and a beta blocker). But this isn't the first paper that has tried this and neither one gives a strong reason to think they sufficiently blocked the receptor in the brain.  I'd probably only believe it if they got plausible changes in self-report measures.  The MDMA dose is on the low end.  The original oxytocin finding in the trust game is also fairly weak.  Paul Zak (who's become a caricature of a scientist) only got significance with a one-tailed test and a large number of participants.  And about half the published replication attempts have failed.  If the oxytocin trust effect is real, it is unlikely to be detectable in a study of this size.    My only conclusions from this paper are that we need better measures of MDMA's unusual effects and we shouldn't use pindolol to probe central 5-HT1A receptors."
DrugNerds,3dltx7,MBaggott,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"pretty much, i guess  yes, pindolol was not the ideal chemical, i wonder why they didn't use alprenolol. perhaps there's a detail i'm unaware of. still, if MDMA was more effective at agonizing 5-HT1A than pindolol, you'd already see a reduction in effects when they were coadministered.  i don't know about the oxytocin. even though they didn't measure central levels, which are probably relevant for behaviour, you would still expect a raise in central levels after intranasal administration, since it crosses the BBB. if MDMA-induced social behaviour is related to oxytocin, why wouldn't oxytocin be able to replicate at least some of its effects? genuine question  someone should feed MDMA and a decent 5-HT1A antagonist to rats already. they could test the APB's and other entactogenic chemicals like MBDB and MDAI for affinity at the 5-HT1A receptor too."
DrugNerds,3dltx7,MBaggott,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:53:52 2015 UTC,"One reason intranasal oxytocin wouldn't replicate MDMA effects is that MDMA may produce higher and more sustained oxytocin levels than we get with IN oxytocin. We can't measure those centrally, but peripherally we can: Matt Kirkpatrick reported 40 IU oxytocin given intranasally raised plasma oxytocin to 48.0 pg/ml while 1.5 mg/kg MDMA raised plasma oxytocin to twice that (83.7 pg/ml) and lasted much longer.  Ian McGregor's group has blocked 5-HT1A receptors after MDMA in rats (one of the studies here) and seen changes in social behavior, including an increase in ""adjacent lying"".  Overall, the rat studies are providing better information on mechanisms of MDMA's social effects than human studies.  But there's a lot of nuance to human social behaviors that we aren't getting from the rodent studies."
DrugNerds,3dhjb1,methylfentanyl,2,Thu Jul 16 09:15:57 2015 UTC,Can someone explain this study in layman terms? ELI5
DrugNerds,3dhjb1,adamtancredi,7,Thu Jul 16 20:27:28 2015 UTC,"Gamma oscillations are part of what is colloquially known as a 'brain wave', it's the rate at which neurons fire off electric signals. Gamma is pretty fast, where neurons fire ~44 times every second.  These oscillations are correlated with many specialized brain functions in localized grey-matter areas dealing with such things as working memory, motor movements, and sensory stimuli.   Ketamine blocks a stimulatory (glutamate) receptor called NMDA (another neurotransmitter called GABA does roughly the same, and is normally implicated in making neurons fire at the gamma frequency) usually there are feedback-loops involved where the neurons need to fire synchronously to keep from inhibiting one another. Ketamine can help keep them from firing at the wrong times to maintain these fast frequencies linked to various complex brain functions."
DrugNerds,3dhjb1,Snickersthecat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:56:44 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I am wrong. Those neuronal pathways are like busy intersections and there are traffic jams caused by various hormones, issues in your life. Ketamine directs the traffic, successfully preventing any loss of communication in your brain."
DrugNerds,3dhjb1,Frank769,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:29 2015 UTC,"If we see 'traffic jams' in oscillations, it usually results in hypersynchrony, meaning seizures. Occasionally sensory information theoretically thought to be integrated (see: perceptual binding theory) can be misrouted in the case of hallucinogenics or schizophrenia. Too few oscillations and it likely means you're dead.  The theory of the cause of MDD used to be that there is too little serotonin, but now the opposite has been found to be true.   So that's a wide ranging question. Yes, there are plenty of third-party effects going on. Depending on what they are, it can cause any number of problems. A less-satisfactory answer is we just dont know enough at this point to be able to pinpoint what is going on in terms of communication in the brain changing as the result of neuromodulatory drugs."

DrugNerds,3dhjb1,Naer-Zed,3,Thu Jul 16 17:43:52 2015 UTC,If ketamine works i may be able to quit the others. Liberal dr i see in morning but what kinda dosage for depresion off label use is worth a try
DrugNerds,3dhjb1,beatlejuicex,3,Thu Jul 16 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"Well, depends on your mental problem, but I agree with you for the most part. I have a few bipolar friends and they most certainly require their medication to be functional people in the long term."
DrugNerds,3dhjb1,HadACigar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"They require it to be functional, but that's not solving the problem completely*. It comes down to whether they're comfortable having to rely on prescriptions for the foreseeable future. That can depend  on how bad the condition is, how they handle it and a load of other subjective factors that make mental health one of the most complicated areas in healthcare imo  *solving the problem, as I see it, is reaching the point where the drugs are not needed"

DrugNerds,3degr2,Lightning14,5,Wed Jul 15 21:36:07 2015 UTC,Source  But it doesn't say how they colored them. Anyone know?
DrugNerds,3degr2,serotones,9,Wed Jul 15 17:40:17 2015 UTC,My guess is they're produced by polarised photomicrography. See http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artjan05/bjcaffeine.html
DrugNerds,3degr2,aryanoface,5,Wed Jul 15 22:59:18 2015 UTC,I'm gonna have to say they were colored on a computer. These look like electron microscopy pictures which are taken in grey-scale.
DrugNerds,3degr2,12ealdeal,3,Wed Jul 15 17:49:31 2015 UTC,was the colour just varied and random or is it related to any particular properties of substance or light?   Cause I have seen these types of things/colours in crystallography for thin sections of geological rocks.
DrugNerds,3degr2,aryanoface,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:00 2015 UTC,Not a clue. The original website doesn't give much information. It provides two links to some microscopy software and to some primers but that doesn't help elucidate how they took the pictures. Maybe someone more familiar with different types of microscopy will come along
DrugNerds,3degr2,dajigo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:24:05 2015 UTC,"Those are polarization colors, the bands mark the contour of equal length and are an interference effects."

DrugNerds,3daiyi,kikikza,5,Wed Jul 15 10:43:49 2015 UTC,i wish these all came with dumbed down explanations :'(
DrugNerds,3daiyi,Juju458,21,Tue Jul 14 23:20:07 2015 UTC,"The hippocampus is where memory and learning formation occurs. CA1 is the part of it that is most often studied because we are able to induce long term potentiation (LTP) which is the underlying mechanism of learning and memory formation. Simply put, methyphenidate (ritalin) increases the level of LTP. This paper showed that it did so via beta-adrenergic and D1/D5 (dopamine) receptors. This is useful knowledge because it shows that ritalin can be used to enhance learning and memory potentially and that the dopamine receptors can increase LTP. The latter is important because most drugs of abuse increase dopamine levels."

DrugNerds,3daiyi,chuggingpills,0,Wed Jul 15 12:25:15 2015 UTC,"idk why I cant accept that a stimulant such as ritilan can amplify LTP, idk why I have such  a negative view on stims"

DrugNerds,3daiyi,7yphoid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"lol dude...I have a very open mind.  I just have had extensive experience with stims and I personally found the to be harmful in the long term, I can voice my opinion if I want."
DrugNerds,3daiyi,_MoreNowAgain_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:26:02 2015 UTC,I just have had extensive experience with stims and I personally found the to be harmful in the long term   Lower dopamine receptor density from stimulants is certainly harmful in the long term. It's kind of a different subject however.
DrugNerds,3daiyi,DreamsOfFeathers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:44:06 2015 UTC,Mind linking me to the studies?

DrugNerds,3daiyi,DreamsOfFeathers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:04:43 2015 UTC,"http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/315/1/91.full http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10024013 http://www.jneurosci.org/content/18/20/8417.short http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060405233546.htm  Some of the damage reverses with time. The rest of the dopamine receptor damage can be reversed with dopamine-receptor agonists after discontinuing amphetamines.   That said, there are more systems that are affected by amphetamines. This is just the dopamine receptors.  However there is absolutely no indication that the 'damage,' which is really just 'long-term changes' is/are permanent. The problem is that reverting the changes through dopamine-receptor agonists could be really difficult for someone with a dopamine deficiency. Why? Because dopamine-receptor agonists will make the deficiency even worse while they are being taken."
DrugNerds,3daiyi,DreamsOfFeathers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:39:21 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I guess that this implies that people with ADHD will have a harder time reversing damage, which is ironic because they are the ones taking chronic doses.  Any word on whether or not methylphenidate causes dopamine receptor damage? That's what I'm currently taking for my ADHD."

DrugNerds,3daiuk,amigo_zen,4,Tue Jul 14 19:45:21 2015 UTC,I downloaded the PDF through my school login and all it is right now is the accepted manuscript of a preface (it's not even three pages long and is double spaced).... We'll probably have to wait a while to be able to read the whole article.
DrugNerds,3daiuk,bangingit,3,Tue Jul 14 23:39:57 2015 UTC,do you guys think we'll see a pharmacological explanation of depression?
