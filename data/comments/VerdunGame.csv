VerdunGame,3dw5hd,xbox360UltimaDraigen,2,Mon Jul 20 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard of any ""blood and gore"" system (which could be improved a bit), but there may of been a few (1-3) maps that were being added in. I can't say what, as I don't know.   I did get your message, and will add you when I get back to my computer!"
VerdunGame,3dw5hd,Mcdystolo,3,Mon Jul 20 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"its on the roadmap :) horrors of war, I shall link you to save you time   https://steamcommunity.com/app/242860/discussions/0/611704730329826536/  new map is the fort of Verdun (finally) and hopefully soon we shall have Belgian, USMC, US army and German squads added; fielding weapons such as trenchgun, BAR, flamethrower (germans),C96, body armour (BEL/GER) and a night time map (name unknown) in addition to this, eventually we should be getting a co-op mode in addition to a new MP mode in which we act out historical scenarios :)"
VerdunGame,3dw5hd,TheJoker182,2,Mon Jul 20 18:59:24 2015 UTC,"All of that sounds amazing! While I was surprised that Verdun was not the first map I saw in ""Verdun"", I'm excited to actually see it added in, along with a night map and historical scenarios. The new squads that are coming are also very exciting for me, along with the weapons they will bring! To top it off, from what I understand, most (if not all) of the upcoming stuff will be free for the game owners. The devs of this game are really earning my respect!"
VerdunGame,3dw5hd,Mcdystolo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:46 2015 UTC,"lots of challenges with the engine meant the tunnels etc were problematic, all fixed now though ;) and yes, all 100% free"
VerdunGame,3dw5hd,TheJoker182,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"Tunnels? That's sounds cool, but the problem does make sense. I heard they started as a three-person team, if that's true then it's amazing how how much they've grown. I can really see how committed they are to fulfilling this game, and based on how good the DLC will be, I'd be willing to pay for another game like this that takes place somewhere else."
VerdunGame,3dw5hd,Mcdystolo,3,Mon Jul 20 19:54:38 2015 UTC,"thats the best bit, if all goes to plan they plan on adding other fronts to the existing verdun framework ;) they were 2 brothers and a friend, now they have I think between 9-12 people, including a brand new animator, so good stuff awaits :)   (im in a clan close with the devs, hence the detail I know haha)"
VerdunGame,3dw5hd,TheJoker182,3,Mon Jul 20 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"Man, this still seems like a big game for 9-12 people to make. Nevertheless, I'm not complaining! I can't wait to see what they develop in the future."

VerdunGame,3dsytg,99639,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:56:36 2015 UTC,"I've always played on ultra (I have an R9 280), and I have a friend who plays on minimum despite being able to play on ultra because he likes to see through trenches and stuff and take advantage of some of the graphical errors of low settings.  Nice! What GPU did you get?"
VerdunGame,3dsytg,arrheniusopeth,3,Sun Jul 19 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"980!!!  I was going to get an R9 390 and support Team Red but the 980 was $370 on prime day so I couldn't resist...  Yeah I did realize the settings may be harming me a little.  I was playing a round on the heavily forested map and the grass was everywhere... low settings definitely have an advantage there.  Unfortunate, I like when games ensure that competitiveness is equal across all graphics settings.  It seems like most maps though have no vegetation to speak of, just a hellscape of mud and craters so I don't think it will affect me too adversely."

VerdunGame,3da387,Tummatime454,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:00:05 2015 UTC,Verdun has some of the most gratifying kill shots.
VerdunGame,3d2tl6,TheRollingTide,6,Mon Jul 13 02:00:10 2015 UTC,"When I asked for a team balance, the opposing team told me to cry more.    Most players aren't like this, in my experience, but I'm guessing the sudden rise in popularity has brought in more internet assholes. Overall, I think the biggest hurdle is trying to convince people to switch teams when they're winning. There's no perfect solution, but I do believe the burden is on the developers to work on this. One idea would be to allow an entire squad to switch as one unit, so people can stay with their buddies.   In my experience, if you keep on politely requesting balance, eventually some of the best players will switch, but it takes a few minutes at the earliest, or they might wait to switch after the match is over. If someone gives you shit, a simple ""fuck off"" is warranted. From a pragmatic standpoint, steamrolling the team yields you the annoyance of having to find a new game after everyone quits, and even assholes have to take this into consideration."
VerdunGame,3d2tl6,p68,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:35:44 2015 UTC,It would be good if the game could perform a check and autoswap anyone who joins who are in a low level squad (indicating that they're not playing with friends) or have no other Steam friends present in the game. There's no reason that solo players should be able to stack.
VerdunGame,3d2tl6,retapes,2,Tue Jul 14 03:51:38 2015 UTC,"Now people are more ranked up, it seems to be quite unbalanced. People just ignore the message asking them to switch roles. It's because either they are a part of a squad and don't wanna split up from their squads.   But anyway the lesser team gets unbalanced points for it. Just today I was playing with a squad with three people on level 100 and one on 62 and the squad level was 100. We got smashed big time."
VerdunGame,3d2tl6,Kasspider,2,Mon Jul 13 02:09:04 2015 UTC,at least I wasn't the only one experiencing this.  It really sucks just starting and this being the state multiplayer is in though.
VerdunGame,3d2tl6,Kasspider,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:13:41 2015 UTC,I would say play the death match first and get familiar with the rifles cuz in front lines it's really hard. Because one you don't know what the hell you're doing and second it's unbalanced so you're getting shot and bombed at from every direction.
VerdunGame,3d2tl6,Pollo_Jack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:10:10 2015 UTC,Also seems you don't get the squad points if you switch. I don't switch for that reason. Work and all the other games I just don't have time to level a squad for each and every person out there.
VerdunGame,3d2tl6,DrDeath666,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:04:19 2015 UTC,I prefer being on the unbalanced team.  More people to kill ðŸ˜¤

This is especially true for games with very low player bases, as matchmaking tends to be crucially impacted by playerbase.  I think deathmatch rifle does not justify its existence and should be removed for the greater good."
VerdunGame,3d0b29,Toudou,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:26:37 2015 UTC,Yes having the player base on one more is a good thing... In the short term however of this game is going to get more popular then another mode is needed to keep people interested. People enjoy it why get rid of it?
VerdunGame,3d0b29,Toudou,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:39:52 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Yes, more popular.. but we are lightyears away from the place where we can justify a new gamemode because."

VerdunGame,3cvzry,Toudou,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:26:46 2015 UTC,"I have a 970 and play with vsync, the problem is not your rig. Anybody telling you they play Verdun with 120 fps on all maps in a 40/40 game is simply lying. This game stutters, but one can live with it.  It is the server/game net code which is not optimal and induces those spikes which you perceive as lags.  Think along the lines of DayZ or Arma 3 on a bad server, you will have terrible FPS there, simply because the server has to handle quite a lot."

VerdunGame,3c8cov,arrheniusopeth,2,Mon Jul 6 18:41:42 2015 UTC,Oh shit I never knew that.  But access to a different sniper rifle would still be cool.
VerdunGame,3c8cov,Riverducky,2,Mon Jul 6 18:43:39 2015 UTC,There are a lot of weapons they could disperse throughout different sqds. I'd like to see a more versatile Sapper sqd. Maybe they could have mines that they can place in front of a friendly or enemy trench. Or some sort of Bangalore torpedo.
VerdunGame,3c8cov,Riverducky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"That would be sorta cool bit I don't think that they had very many handheld methods of clearing trenches besides wire cutters,  which should be added. Maybe with the introduction of the German Pioneer Squad with the Flammenwerfer we will get some more methods of trench clearing.  One weapon I would love to see is the Mauser 13mm anti tank rifle but there really is not any uses for that weapon unless we get like armored shield deployable."
VerdunGame,3c8cov,Riverducky,2,Thu Jul 9 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"I believe in one of the updates there will be Body armor available. Well, they did have a lot of ways to clear trenches. Knives, clubs ect. But, the sappers job was basically to dig below the enemy trench and blow it up. Now, while they can't really do that in this game, they can still make some of the explosives available as defensive items."
VerdunGame,3c8cov,Riverducky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:39:34 2015 UTC,Having something like tripwires or landmines would be great. But for rifles there needs to be diversity that's for sure.
VerdunGame,3c8cov,Riverducky,2,Thu Jul 9 19:55:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While there was a diversity of rifles, most production was limited minus a select few."
VerdunGame,3byuek,KidnapSix,14,Fri Jul 3 07:13:14 2015 UTC,Check out their roadmap! Two American squads are planned to be introduced! They'll include weapons like the BAR and the trenchgun. I can't wait to see how they play out!

VerdunGame,3byuek,doughboywwi,3,Fri Jul 3 22:00:50 2015 UTC,"Correct, one army squad (basic rifle squad) with Enfield rifles, BAR, M1911. And one marine squad to counter the German pioneer squad. Not really too sure what the marines/German pioneer squad will contain, but it's certain that the marines will have the trenchgun and Springfield rifles. The German pioneer squad is set to have a flamethrower class. If your interested in all of this and other expansions/additions, I would check out Verdun forums on Steam!

Long way to go, but it is still pretty enjoyable."
VerdunGame,3bbswn,OxfordTheCat,8,Sat Jun 27 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"Latency is mostly <50ms for me, many players with similar numbers.  Acutally, the hit detection is quite good. I have no idea how oxfordthecat could say something different. Sure, it is not CS, but it is miles and miles better than insurgency or even the infamous BF-series.  Edit: handguns are very strong, too. This poster reminds me of Jon Snow, tbh."
VerdunGame,3bbswn,Toudou,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:29:04 2015 UTC,"The hit detection is abhorrent, mostly because of the latency issues.  Deaths from in cover a half second after the shot?  Rifle or handgun with aim down sight up and an enemy character obscuring the entire FOV, but a miss still registers?  High ping players choppily teleporting and clipping their  way across the map?  It's not anywhere close to being as good as Insurgency in the hit detection department (or as an FPS in general, for that matter).  And handgun accuracy is nerfed to the point of eye rolling frustration / laughing.  You must be playing with some particularly expensive rose coloured glasses on if you think Verdun is even in the same league as BF or Insurgency.  Verdun has a long way to go."

I do not know you but I am playing with my eyes open. And you are right, BF and Insurgency are in a different league, because their netcode is terrible, is hit detection is handled on client and suffer heavily from rubberbanding and dying 5m behind cover. Verdun on the other hand not, you die where you stand (+ur download), which is actually a great feature.  There are players with 300ms and they do jump around the battlefield, a perk of server side handling, but oh well, get rid of those and it is all fine.  TL;DR: netcode in verdun is actually quite good, dont listen to anyone saying BF4 netcode is great"

Just a quick followup question, in your opinion, what games are outstandingly good in this department and which one is very bad?   I'm in a range between 40's and 60's, on the US server.  Lowest I've seen is mid thirties.  And it's not like I'm in some second world dump with a questionable network - Southern ON, 60 mbps cable.  As far as what games are good?   I can't understand your complaint about Insurgency for the life of me, because I've never experienced any of this rubberbanding that you claim it ""suffers heavily"" from.  I also can't comment on BF4 as I haven't played it, but even BF BC2's less than perfect HD is better than Verdun's.  RO2 and Rising Storm both outperform Verdun and it's not even close:  Far improved hit detection at close quarters.  You can go on and on about how the architecture might be better in theory, but it certainly isn't fleshing out to a better experience in practice:  A simple search of ""hit detection"" on the Verdun Steam forums will provide you with ample examples and complaints.  Seems my experience is not the only one.   It is not, half-trench shots are very accurate and they shine at close-mid, where they belong.   Again, my experience is completely difference.  You can aim dead on a target in aim down the sights and have what almost seems to be some sort of  'enforced miss' or 'random chance miss' because you were moving slightly.  That the sights were fixed on the target seems to be of little importance to the game engine, else it's a hit detection / latency issue.  I'm also not sure why players can take multiple hits from something like a Webley.  Surely it's a decision in the name of balance, but it detracts from the realism side."
VerdunGame,3bbswn,OxfordTheCat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:06:31 2015 UTC,They need to limit out people with 150+ ping. The lag wizards do create hit detection issues also they appear after they shoot which is bs. On servers without lag wizards the game is perfectly playable and quite enjoyable.

VerdunGame,3b5p1b,InsertEvilLaugh,9,Fri Jun 26 04:31:16 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear you love the game. Thought I'd reply to your critiques in the same style that you used - I'm not intending to correct or argue, I'm just offering different opinions.   The Lewis has its own disadvantages - it has terrible iron sights, and is terribly inaccurate. In my opinion, the worst MG. The MG08 is more often considered over-powered, as it has perfect accuracy, perfect iron sights and almost a hundred bullets per magazine. Nearly always the highest KDRs per map. The German Stormtroopers have their own light SMG that works much better than the hip-fire Lewis anyway, the MP18i. Hip-firing the Lewis is generally considered a noob tactic anyway - spray and pray. The game asks you to switch instead of forcing you because you might actually know the people you are playing with, and the devs encourage you to play with the same people constantly by giving you bonuses for every match you've played with them.  In my experience, sides don't really stay uneven for long, as people constantly join and leave, and the side that had too many at the start often has too few by the end. If you want to use the sniper rifle without the scope, simply switch back to the 2nd weapon setting for the sniper class. The classes are designed to have you constantly choosing the right tool for the job - for instance, using the pistol and grenade load-out for attacking, and the rifle and bayonet loadout for defence. The sniper's main purpose is to eliminate MGs, so during the defensive stage there is little use for the scope anyway, as all the MGs will have rushed in to your trench. Also, something few people understand is that a sniper need not always snipe - technically, the role is that of rifleman, and a more useful tactic for squads is to have the rifleman accompany and protect the NCO during attack, as the NCOs job is to spawn troops inside the enemy trench, and therefore needs to keep out of sight.   I know what you mean by aggravation - Picardie and Aisne are the worst for me, as I lose my temper with constantly getting sniped. Last Picardie match I played, I gave up on sticking my head above the parapets on defence, because I had no hope of not getting shot, no matter how well hidden I was."
VerdunGame,3b5p1b,AnAngryPacifist,3,Fri Jun 26 05:40:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all of your points made solid sense, though I still stand by my argument with autobalance. Same concept is given to all multiplayer games.  As far as the sniper, agree, makes a whole lot of sense, though still wouldn't mind being able to look down the standard bore. I know some of them had to be modified in a way that made the standard iron sights unusable to some extent, but would still like to be able to stare down the top of the bore, get a basic idea of where I'm aiming it."

This ""Coop-Xp"" can only grow and you share it with that person, but only that person. If you play with another guy you never played with before, both of you have 0 ""Coop-Xp"" towards each other.  Now, the system looks at how much coop-xp there is in a squad and gives you a squad level for that!  If you start playing regularly with the same people, you will see the Squad-level to be quite high after a while if you keep playing with those folks.  Thing that matters is the people you play with in the squad, not the squad. Heck, you can even rename a squad.  Sorry, if this is a tad confusing."

VerdunGame,3arjej,XXLpeanuts,5,Mon Jun 22 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"I see your point, as I like it the way it is. Movement is a little ""clunky"" and thus does not allow for fast left/right evasive movement like in other games. Even prone and crouching takes some time, which is honestly great!  If they implement leaning the same way, that it actually takes some time, I would be fine with it! But I would hate nothing more like people doing the q/e dance like in cod2 making it really hard to hit them!  On a side note, I would love to see prone animation to be a focused on, though.

VerdunGame,3ar0z1,royrogerer,2,Mon Jun 22 21:54:49 2015 UTC,"To be honest, in my opinion, AI on Titan fall was atrocious. It was one of the worst idea I have seen in a multi-player game. They just ended up being a red herring for enemy players. Maybe if I got used to them, I'd have a slightly different opinion, but in a fast paced game, I never have the mind to check who the real players are. I'd be shooting around like crazy, until some player would shoot at me while I'm distracted.   Verdun is not a fast paced game, but they wouldn't be able to make it clear enough who the bots are, since all uniforms are diverse enough, and adding another skin for bots wouldn't be very visible, making it even worse than Titan fall.   I understand what you mean more atmospheric, but I'd rather have servers with bigger player count instead of with bots."

Every game I play, I recon for the team, and give advice on which direction to take and positions for MGs and the like. Some just ignore you, which pisses me off to no end, but most who enjoy the game and want to get better will be happy to listen.  I've even had three people add me on Steam for advice, which shows how willing they are to learn."

I guess it depends on the atmosphere. Feeling like you're getting gunned down or it's a lot more even and every life counts.  Picardie is great. If you can make out shadows at a distance, it becomes insanely easy to snipe with a mg. I think the major problem is that snipers don't look out for mgs at the start all that often."

VerdunGame,3a7q99,FierceTom,6,Fri Jun 19 22:15:12 2015 UTC,"Learn how the game works, here's a quick rundown:   Play the objective, leave your worry about KDR at the door, winning is the goal. Learn your position, there's a short description on each one, and it's easy to google how to use each. Grenadiers use grenades to clear trench, Snipers generally pick off the MG's, MG's pick a good field of fire and suppress so your squad can move up. (there are other squad types with their own unique positions as well, these are just a few examples) Squad Caporal use your NCO powers by pressing Q, left click puts a command aura which buffs squad members who are in that vicinity, and right click uses your squad type specific power which is either Mortars, Recon Plane, or Gas.  Communicate as much as possible. Have a good time, in the end it's a fun game made for you to enjoy. Just don't go in with the misconception that it's functionally similar to CS, CoD, or other shooters."

It has a long way to go before becoming as full of a game as any of the orchestra series, and it will seem lacking a but, but it is a dedicated and growing community with devs who care and have recently unveiled a new roadmap for more fronts, classes, squads,  and game modes. So while their May be more complete games to buy atm, this is a very good game and enjoyable especially coming from RO. Watch some gameplay of it to get a feel for the game, and if you do decide to get it then good luck!"

Now after reading the guide and playing a few matches, I occasionally bite back a little before getting killed. Good times!

VerdunGame,39r3q7,dreapunk,5,Sat Jun 13 22:56:14 2015 UTC,"Career points in Frontline mode unlock additional weapons for different classes - for example, an officer generally starts with a pistol and binoculars, then upgrades to a pistol and grenades, and then upgrades to a rifle. You will need to do this for all classes on all squads, but the points carry over, so you don't need to play the classes to be able to unlock their weapons.  Rifle Deathmatch, as far as I know, has its own points, but don't quote me on this, as I've only played it once or twice.  You can join any squad you like - however, they might ask you to leave for a friend to take your place, which would increase their points and make communication easier. So don't stress about which squad you play in.  Squad progress is linked to the number of games you've played with people in your squad - you are encouraged to bring friends in to the game, or make friends with other players, and then form semi-permanent squads with them, making communication easier.  Not approaching squad progression with any sort of plan (i.e. playing with randoms) means you get bugger all points for it, but don't stress, 'cause that's what most people do anyway.  If you want any more info, I suggest you look here: http://verdun.wikia.com/wiki/Tips_and_Strategy  You could also just ask again here on Reddit, or try the official Verdun forum on Steam."

VerdunGame,39r3q7,w4z,6,Sun Jun 14 02:14:14 2015 UTC,This is wrong.  Career points unlock weapon loadouts/New weapons for regular multiplayer.
VerdunGame,39r3q7,isntitabeauty,2,Sun Jun 14 09:39:17 2015 UTC,"Career points are for only unlocking weapon attachments.    Are those attachments used in both game modes or just the rifle deathmatch thing?  As far as I can tell, you have to go enter a rifle deathmatch game to get the unlock menu."
VerdunGame,39r3q7,TheTragicClown,2,Sun Jun 14 02:20:05 2015 UTC,Separate unlocks. Each squad has unlocks that carry over in matches and then the deathmatch matches are separate unlocks.
VerdunGame,39r3q7,isntitabeauty,2,Sun Jun 14 02:40:44 2015 UTC,So if I don't care about the rifle deathmatches then the career points don't matter to me.  Good to know. Thanks! :D

VerdunGame,37pmxs,Oddsball,6,Fri May 29 12:16:21 2015 UTC,"The Devs have a roadmap on their Facebook page. They are planning on adding at least one new map, a new gamemode, new squad types, and more gore, at least. I would link you to it but I'm on mobile right now sorry."
VerdunGame,37pmxs,themitchster300,7,Fri May 29 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"This is the most common question asked on the Steam forums, and they always say ""not just yet"" - the reasons they give are:   the game is based on Verdun, and lots more Western Front maps are possible. Going to add the Americans and Belgians, as they apparently played a larger part on the Western Front than Commonwealth troops.   But this is just their plan for this year - who knows what'll happen after they've got what they've planned so far out of the way."
VerdunGame,37pmxs,AnAngryPacifist,3,Fri May 29 17:01:57 2015 UTC,"The US and Belgians are been added. I doubt we'll see the ANZACs for a while since they wouldn't bring a lot of new equipment into the game despite their importance in Gallipoli, the Middle East and The Western Front. The US and Belgium, while they didn't play a very large part (because the Belgian army was destroyed early on and ended up been relegated to a quiet sector for the remainder of the war and the US joined in towards the end of the show) will provide a lot of opportunity for new equipment and some new maps. A lot of people argue that the game is based solely on Verdun which is stupid because we already have the Commonwealth (who didn't fight in Verdun) added in along with maps like Flanders which are miles away from Verdun."
VerdunGame,37pmxs,lestweforget1914,5,Sat May 30 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"People have said it's because they wouldn't bring new equipment, but there are plenty of weapons that they could give them, such as periscope rifles, booby traps and Hotchkiss guns. They could give NCOs ""morale boosts"" instead of mortars, since ANZACS were notoriously tough and spirited. They also say that there wouldn't be much diversity in skins, but the Aussies would have different styled jackets and slouch hats, the Kiwis would have lemon-squeezer hats, Light-horse would have emu plumes and you could easily add some form of Indian troop, either a Sikh or Muslim with turban and beard.  I think it's more than anything a case of ""you Aussies/Kiwis are just blowing your own role way out of proportion, so we'll make a whole load of ignorant excuses to justify why you shouldn't be in it.""  Of course, that's not the official opinions of the devs, just the people of the Steam forums."
VerdunGame,37pmxs,AnAngryPacifist,4,Sat May 30 08:02:27 2015 UTC,"I think it would be the natural way for the devs to go though - you have the European server and European squads, you have the US server and Canadian and US squads, then you have the Aussie server with nothing - you can't just ignore a large part of your customer base like that, there'd have to be some balancing.  The number of squads named AIF, Anzac or Diggers on AUS server is proof enough that to not add an Anzac/Commonwealth squad would be a major blow to Aussie/Kiwi players."
VerdunGame,37pmxs,AnAngryPacifist,2,Sat May 30 08:12:57 2015 UTC,"Belgians actually played a huge part in the war, just not for very long. Had the Belgians rolled over for the Germans, the schilefen plan would have probably worked as the Germans would have out flanked the French.   The Belgians caused WWI to not turn into franco prussian war part II."

VerdunGame,34o9vd,joebo3001,1 point,Sun May 3 00:18:41 2015 UTC,Does this game feel like the original Medal of Honor game? I freaken loved that game... the maps were awesome too. It breaks my heart that no FPS has been up to par with the quality maps and game play like that. Seriously that one one ruined town map with the graveyard... ok I'm getting sentimental now.
VerdunGame,34o9vd,Amadeus_Ray,2,Fri May 8 01:16:29 2015 UTC,"It feels similar, but the main awesome thing about this game is 80%+ of games end in ties. It's not a shooter in the sense of moh because it's over the top you go, mostly to your death like in ww1. It's well worth the $20 and way better than the crap AAA titles are putting out now."

VerdunGame,34l5d9,Keithic,9,Sat May 2 02:59:05 2015 UTC,I would love to see some urban maps.  It wasn't all trench warfare.  Passchendale was a hugely brutal urban fight.

VerdunGame,34l5d9,XXLpeanuts,3,Mon May 4 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"I really hope their plan is to do this, its not ww1 with 15 players a side, its just not.   Even if they didnt expand the maps it would be fine, feel far more like ww1"
VerdunGame,34l5d9,XXLpeanuts,3,Sun May 3 18:42:32 2015 UTC,"If you look on their Steam forums you can see a sticky post about this.  They say they are planning on trying 40 player servers, which would add one more squad to each team."
VerdunGame,34l5d9,im4potato,1 point,Mon May 4 01:49:52 2015 UTC,"Sweet didnt know this, 40 would be a nice middle step to see how it goes, i feel an extra squad would go a long way."
VerdunGame,34l5d9,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Mon May 4 19:27:43 2015 UTC,"Can't imagine they would do this. The frame rate and lag in game would get pretty bad.  Also, it's hard enough to make it across to the other trench without getting snipped. 64 players would be an impossible wall of bullets to get through.  There's a reason large scale WW1 FPS's aren't really a thing. Taking territory would be just as difficult and fruitless as it was in reality."
VerdunGame,34l5d9,Pure_Politics,2,Mon May 4 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, the only way to try to balance out 64 players is wider maps to allow more attack points. Otherwise you'd get a draw on every single map."
VerdunGame,34l5d9,scarecrowman175,1 point,Tue May 5 14:47:25 2015 UTC,Alternatively- a way to remove barbed wire would be nice. We'd make our own new attack vectors.   64 Player maps would finally encourage people to play the squads that use Gas.
VerdunGame,34l5d9,ericvulgaris,1 point,Thu May 7 13:36:10 2015 UTC,"Added bonus is that if you could organise it you could get a large amount of players to actually storm a specific point, which would be awesome."

VerdunGame,34j3xt,Theplahunter,2,Fri May 1 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, with no dedicated servers its really difficult to install mods or new maps. Unless you mean skins which just seem boring unless everybody can see the skin you have. So a camo skin or a pearl white one for flair"
VerdunGame,34indc,XXLpeanuts,9,Fri May 1 14:00:24 2015 UTC,"I don't like speaking, but I do type out recon, and I do read and react to a team-mate's recon.  I think the game needs a tutorial, where the importance of teamwork and squad tactics can be drilled into noobs, so they don't go into the game with a CoD/CS mind-set.  Post-release, played so many games where half the game was noob, and they neither recon-ed nor responded to recon."
VerdunGame,34indc,AnAngryPacifist,4,Fri May 1 16:35:27 2015 UTC,Usually takes one team to be using comms and tactics and the other not to for noobs to learn this. With the player base of RO2 dropping now i was hoping Verdun could give me my fix of brutal warfare but with people playing it like its COD/CS its just not going to stick for me.
VerdunGame,34indc,Praetor80,2,Fri May 1 16:40:58 2015 UTC,RO2 is full of 64 man servers every time I play.
VerdunGame,34indc,Praetor80,2,Sun May 3 17:56:03 2015 UTC,Indeed but only one european based campaign server :/. And only one American one too. I dont enjoy other modes anywhere near as much.
VerdunGame,34indc,Praetor80,2,Sun May 3 18:07:05 2015 UTC,There's a lot of American servers.  I get usually 6 or 7 full 64 man servers when I look.
VerdunGame,34indc,Praetor80,2,Sun May 3 19:13:49 2015 UTC,I only ever see one that has acceptable ping (under 200) so i guess the others are west coast. (i am uk).

Keep your videos a bit shorter with more lively commentary would be my opinion.   If you ever want someone to play with and join in on the banter, i'm happy to join."
VerdunGame,34hnua,Taboggan,1 point,Fri May 1 17:24:42 2015 UTC,Add me in the game! Same name as the channel. Myherospbnj.   Always looking for more to play with and want to start a squad to play together.   Thanks for the feedback it's key to improving my work! I'll try and fix these aspects.
VerdunGame,34h0xl,flipanda,3,Fri May 1 02:05:29 2015 UTC,"So I got a couple tips for you  1) Never shoot while just plainly in the open during a charge, you're a prime fucking target.  2) Your enthusiastic teammates are your bullet shields, use 'em.   3) Look ahead: See that tree line there that you can't see though? They can't either. It's good cover for a charge.  4) Head up, bolt the rifle, unless you have another clean shot get your fucking head -down-  5) You are artillery's bitch, but get him to wear a condom by hiding in the trench holes with roofs.   6) Check your corners CONSTANTLY, even if you see a HINT of blue/Grey/beige, point your rifle in the general direction of it and go around the corner.  7) If you miss your first shot point blank, hope to hell he fucking misses as well then hope the fucker is stupid enough to not swing because two quick Vs without a Bayonet or one quick stab can save you. Melee is very powerful, if you can disorient an opponent in CQC you have a clear, CLEAR advantage. And sometimes, using your bayonet can hide you from an enemy by not shooting, or by keeping trigger discipline and swinging quick you can take out two enemies in front of you point blank without either side firing a shot.  8) MGS: Memorize common MG spots, look for divots, sandbags, closed in areas and memorize how to get grenades in there effectively (if a class with grenades.) An opening to call Artillery then get a shot when he runs (if officer) or massive blind spots like Tanks, Bi-Planes, trees, corpses, rocks, anything that can hide you from that damn killing machine to take it out. And if it's firing at your mate seven meters away, fucking pop up and take that bastard out.  8) You will quickly love the Kar98Z/SMLE/Berthier/Lebel. They are the four best rifles, the G98 has bad ironsights, has a straight pull bolt. The Berthier and Kar have superior sights, ammo, handling, and just... Christ it feels so damn riiiight.  9) You throw grenades like fucking baseballs, don't be afraid to chuck em short.  10) Ammo. ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS check your ammo and pay attention if you pull the bolt, and when you reload take some cover wherever.  Other than that I am very impressed by your eye and accuracy, you should pick up a scoped rifle and try your hand at long range sniping. You will LOVE finding that sweet spot and taking out MGs and just being a general help to the team but not directly charging."
VerdunGame,34h0xl,Theplahunter,1 point,Fri May 1 03:01:55 2015 UTC,hey thanks for the tips there. im loving this game so far. all the other fps games i play like battlefield dont make me feel that heartpumping action like this game does for me again.  i have yet to really dive into the game and still havent spent any career points but im reading up on it. thanks again for the tips!
VerdunGame,34h0xl,Theplahunter,1 point,Fri May 1 03:16:03 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the game, mate. Remember, its ww1 so you will die a lot even if you follow all the tips.

Pretty annoying that dudes with scopes can continually pick me off, but pretty cool that I get to trail them during respawn to see what's happening.  Also, since I just keep hitting ""Play Now"" I assume I'm playing with scrubs like me. Are those motherfuckers in my squad really accidentally murdering me as frequently as it seems? What's the best way to learn to play this apparently amazing game, assuming I have no friends?"

VerdunGame,34h0xl,Theplahunter,2,Fri May 1 18:10:25 2015 UTC,"Not really - shooting is fairly straight forward, it's the tactics of the game that are complicated.

Been pushing my friends really hard to get it, and I know a couple are going to in the next couple of days.   In terms of bringing people in, perhaps we all work out a night, within the next couple/few days, where as many of us agree to get online and play some, and make it a regular thing, hopefully getting it happening enough, to the point we can then have tournies.  More thoughts? Anyone keen to throw some times out? I'm available midday-midnight, any day."
VerdunGame,34cfqb,discodood,3,Thu Apr 30 10:41:50 2015 UTC,"The game needs a bigger discount than 10%. Niche titles like Red Orchestra or Insurgency have the biggest community increases during sales. 25% for the two weeks after release seems reasonable to me considering the game has been available for over a year. Besides that they should send copies to popular YouTubers and streamers, look at Cities: Skylines for example. After only a couple of weeks it sold one million copies. I don't remember a single ad for that game but it was everywhere on YouTube and Twitch, it was the first game in over a year that I bought on launch even though I never heard of it two weeks before launch. I highly doubt that Verdun would sell as well if they had done exactly the same since more people were asking for a City Builder than a WW1 game but we would still see an incredible community and sales boost."
VerdunGame,34cfqb,the_magic_muffin,0,Thu Apr 30 11:19:08 2015 UTC,"As a community, its not our place to discuss pricing (unless its exorbitant/ripoff) or discounting, as a means to bring in more people.  We are meant to organise together, between ourselves, so we can all have a good time, try and showcase it in various outlets, and hopefully bring in more of a crowd. We don't need 1000000 people flooding the servers, around 60 would be awesome, and I really don't think that's too hard to do if we all do a little bit (15 people bring 3 friends each)  BTW, G2A sell the game for less than 50% of what steam sells it for."

VerdunGame,34cfqb,the_magic_muffin,2,Thu Apr 30 12:44:59 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this - I played half an hour ago, at midnight, in a game with three full squads each side. The server is much more populous than ever before, and even veterans who a week ago would not have been playing as late due to a lack of players, are, thanks to the noobs.  Even just before release, we were getting games of around 32 people between 5-9pm WST.  I do agree though that the game needs to be advertised by the community more, as it would be great to be able to choose the map you play - if you're tired of Flanders, jump out of that much into another map. Atm there are two games, but usually one is full and the other is about 4-6 people, mostly new players."

Bear in mind you'll have to unlock these individually for each faction, so if you unlock the machinegun for the Germans, you'll have to unlock it again for the French and again for the Brits."

VerdunGame,34aytu,CodeineCowboy,1 point,Fri May 1 23:07:00 2015 UTC,I guess it was worse because I was impatient about getting the machine gun and couldn't get into the MG role too often.

VerdunGame,34aytu,DrDeath666,1 point,Fri May 1 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"Deathmatch is completely separate - unlocks for that mode stay in that mode.

VerdunGame,345boe,gazwel,4,Wed Apr 29 08:21:08 2015 UTC,"But with this kind of game you dont normally get whining children on mic, i mean look at RO2, you get Squad leaders and team leaders planning attacks and using tactics, as well as people calling out enemy flanking maneuvers and the like.   Not every game is either COD or CS. I think it adds massively to the gameplay if you can actually use tactics."

VerdunGame,345l0o,natneo81,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:40:01 2015 UTC,Just heard about this game. Is this game any good? It sounds great and I'm wondering if it's full of bugs or in some way flawed like Red Orchestra 2's release was.
VerdunGame,342y9s,Probably_The_Bear,2,Mon Apr 27 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's just that the developers are releasing frequent patches, and something about the way the game is written or the updates are done forces you to download a ton of data each time. Damned irritating."
VerdunGame,342y9s,T-Shirt_Ninja,-7,Mon Apr 27 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"So everyone has to get a 2 GB download everyday for the past week? Because if so, thats utter fucking horseshit on the developers part."
VerdunGame,342y9s,angrydroid,6,Mon Apr 27 23:45:59 2015 UTC,"Cool your jets, hotshot. They are nearing a final release after years of working on it and you did buy an ""early access"" game while it was still under development."
VerdunGame,342y9s,angrydroid,-8,Tue Apr 28 05:01:45 2015 UTC,"Since when does any early access game need a 2 GB download everyday for a week. There is no possible way you can convince me this is purposeful on the developers part, because if it is that's bullshit. DayZ is early access and it doesn't do it. If it's a bug I'm ok with it, if this is how they are making the game then I'm gunna stop playing because it isn't on par with the development of other 20$ early access games."
VerdunGame,342y9s,angrydroid,7,Tue Apr 28 05:43:48 2015 UTC,"Hey, do whatever you like. Apparently your reading skills are sub-par. This game is literally being born before your eyes and all you can do is whine like a child. I saw one 1.8 GB and one 1.2 GB update over the past three days. Followed by a 9 MB update late last night. I've been playing this game for over a year and have managed to endure many more updates and have loved every minute of it. So, in other words you are exaggerating, you big drama queen.  So here, consider this. If you had bothered to read the change logs you would probably realize that they were optimizing the maps, textures and sounds for the final release. Hell, they even added a new map! And that map is awesome balls! The last time I checked, game data files such as these are usually the single biggest space hog in any game. Not that any of this will mean anything to you, but if you're really so horribly butthurt by these enormous updates, you can always send feedback to the developers here.  But, personally speaking, considering your comment history, I'd actually prefer you to just fuck off. We literally don't need people like you in this community."
VerdunGame,342y9s,angrydroid,-4,Tue Apr 28 11:54:35 2015 UTC,"Lol ok man, that's fucked then. I was civil the entire time. Your the only one throwing names around. I came in with a legit complaint and you guys can't take the criticism. But your right IM the drama queen.  Edit: I did read the change logs btw, it doesn't say anything about a exactly 2 GB everyday. But like you said my reading comprehension is shit so that could be wrong. Maybe you should read it and see if I'm right."

VerdunGame,32pe15,DavidGrizzly,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:25:09 2015 UTC,"Have a read of this - http://verdun.wikia.com/wiki/Tips_and_Strategy  I'd say the most important aspects of the game are:  (1) hiding - crouch and prone whenever possible, keep your head down, a single glimpse can get you shot or lead to a nade or mortar strike.  (2) recon - tell your team where shit is. Where to defend, where to attack, MG positions, sniper positions. Knowing where things are means you can shoot them without them shooting you, and win objectives.  (3) know your class - learn how to effectively use your class. MGs are very effective snipers, meaning riflemen can help hold the trench instead of sniping. NCOs need to know where to mortar, where to hide to spawn and where to place the command aura. Grenadiers and NCOs need to decide on having a rifle or a pistol, and how many grenades they will need for their attack/defence. MGs need to know when to deploy, and when to help take the trench.  (4) learn the maps - where people will cross, and take cover, is usually fairly obvious after a few times on a map, especially if you think about where you normally go. Barbed wire makes certain paths inevitable, as does crater availability. Mortar, nade or MG those particular spots."

VerdunGame,32m3ar,iAscian,2,Tue Apr 14 21:52:32 2015 UTC,I think adding VOIP would go a looooooooong way. And better stances/animations more similar to RO2
VerdunGame,32m3ar,Praetor80,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:10:38 2015 UTC,"Its a game, making it super realistic will ruin it conpletely Bigger maps means better pc's and that would be a shame since its playable now at least Eastern front was a moving front   But srsly fix deserting and wire?"
VerdunGame,32m3ar,PornTacticStan,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:01:34 2015 UTC,"1)  Its a game, making it super realistic will ruin it conpletely   Most(or Half) of this game's merit is in its authenticity, I'm only merely exclaiming that part of the game's main important mechanical hook(WWI and squad) should always be most focused/polished. I don't think it will ruin everything, but will make the people who appreciate Verdun for its WWI theme recognise it for its uniqueness(since there are so few good Great War games).   2) Bigger maps means better pc's and that would be a shame since its playable now at least   Would agree that most players being able to play is necessary for a wide audience, but this game has only reached a niche audience to begin with. So its only options are to be more like TDM (Modern military or arena) or more like Battlefield4/Planetside2(which aren't that bad and I'm not asking for nearly that bad). Even nowadays people can play Battlefield/Planetside on a very mediocre rig(like PS4 spec and lower) and still get decent looking game with decent frames(and I'm not asking for a scale like that). I think its plausible given the game is pretty well optimised now with the Unity5 Engine, and could only get better with Unity's modularity(sometimes) as opposed to UE4.   3)  Eastern front was a moving front   Then we'd have a more dynamic and fun game. Given that the game ""Verdun"" has other battles on the Western front, it just seemed half-assed to add a couple more on the Western front as opposed to all of WWI(they were just examples as what wasn't included)."

Right now its similar to call of duty or any normal fps but for a World War One game it should be useful and brutal.

VerdunGame,2ycnqe,destructor_rph,8,Sun Mar 8 17:21:38 2015 UTC,"Strangely, a lot of people get this game under that impression, including me. However I found out it is quite different. First of all, this game is made with unity engine, not unreal engine, so the movement and overall gameplay is very different, eventually making the playing experience completely different. I now see it as a completely separate game. (just because I came to the game with that pretense, my first couple of hours was very confusing, as I played it like RO2)  There are a lot of similar mechanics and system, like how you can spawn on your group leader, and suppression. They work in very similar fashion, but still is vastly different, as the group leader can call mortar shots directly, not through TL, and suppression is also different, as lots of bolt action or pistols are used.   But the biggest difference lies in the map system. It is not sector capture system but pushing enemies out of the trench/line system, which involves a lot of running across open field, which could be similar to RO2, except the enemies are spread out in a line, not sectors.   I hope this helped. It is kind of hard to explain the difference, because these two games just feel different, and requires different strategy. So to answer to your question, you can expect similar realism, but not the same experience."

VerdunGame,2ycnqe,Wookimonster,3,Sun Mar 8 22:54:32 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see similarities between the two. I really like Verdun but it's not as good as red Orchestra (yet).  I feel that game play wise red Orchestra is really well done, especially in the gun handling. Guns in red Orchestra 2 are easy enough to use, yet still detailed and immersive. Compare to ArmA where gun play is very detailed, but not as easy to handle. Also, RO 2 has a very smooth setting up mechanic for bipod weapons that I've not met the like of yet.  The game play isn't as smooth as RO2 and probably not as immersive either, but the game is still in beta. I have to say that in comparison to RO2, the gui and menus are way better and easier to use. Same goes for the squad system, wanting to play with 3 or 4 friends  was a pain in the ass in red Orchestra. Of course, Verdun only has 4 man squads."
VerdunGame,2ycnqe,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"Personally thats exactly what i see it as, all you have to do is disable crosshair and tactical view and there you have it, ww1 RO2. I like it just as much only issue is noone play this and there isnt enough people in a server (32 being max player count currently) so it isnt as good."
VerdunGame,2ycnqe,hccole,-1,Mon Mar 30 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"I know I'm sending myself to downvote Hell for saying this, but-  Not every semi-realistic shooter set before 1946 is comparable to Red Orchestra. Everytime I hear the question: ""Is it like RO?"" I think that Verdun is just as comparable to that game as Counter Strike is comparable to Wolenstein."
VerdunGame,2ycnqe,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"Thats because there are only like a handful (literally) of shooters that even attempt to be immersive/realistic now days, and RO2, Insurgency and Verdun (to a lesser extent) are included in those."

VerdunGame,2y0nm5,Vorobye,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"There's nothing better than having a handful of grenades and a pistol or trench club. Not only does it feel awesome and gung ho, it's also accurate to experienced trench raiders giving up their rifles in exchange for handguns, knives, clubs and lots of grenades.   I hope that they will add weapon collision to this game so that people cannot easily turn corners with long rifles making pistols and shorter melee weapons have an even greater place and greater effectiveness."

He didn't shoot me either. After a few seconds I crouched and stood up, bowing in respect. He did the same and then left the trench."

VerdunGame,2u0r37,unproductive_now,2,Wed Jan 28 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. You seem to show a pretty good description of the game. And I definitely agree with destructive environment, since it will weaken enemy lines for easier attacks. I have had moments where I stayed alive for too long behind one specific camp spot. However, what I would like to hear addressed is the close quarter combat. Running across the field is exciting at times, but often people don't organize, and the entire team gets penalized for that (as you said). However, upon successful cross over, the best part starts. Which is the fear of enemies around the corner. Running into enemy line through gas attacks is what brings back to the game every time. The melee mechanic is very weird sometimes, but it definitely is satisfying and nerve wrecking as you attempt to clear out enemy trenches. Anyway, it was nice to read. :)"
VerdunGame,2u0r37,royrogerer,1 point,Thu Jan 29 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree on the tanks. The maps aren't really set up for them and they'd take away some of the feeling of vulnerability which is so important in this game. Besides I don't think tanks were used at Verdun, or at least not on a big scale."
VerdunGame,2tmvi8,AmazingMazer,11,Sun Jan 25 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"it is max 32 as of now but I feel like having 64 players would give that more human wave wave feel when teams assault the opposing trenches. Imo, 100 would be best but now many games can pull that off and some of the maps are kind of small as is and 32 vs 32 would be very clustered."
VerdunGame,2tmvi8,stuka444,5,Sun Jan 25 19:36:16 2015 UTC,"Currently locked at 32, I agree that 64 would be awesome but we'd need bigger maps as a whole.  The larger teams would allow everyone to charge as a massive team wave at one part of the line (which would be awesome) but you'rd need larger trench systems to properly spread out the defenders.  On some of the smaller maps attacking in a 16 v 16 is already practically impossible, because the defenders can have the enitrety of no mans land covered. Which whilst realistic, could be improved."
VerdunGame,2tmvi8,Mcpom,3,Mon Jan 26 05:56:21 2015 UTC,"Perhaps in the future they could do small trench games limited to 32, medium, limited to 64, and lastly 100. Obviously they would need to make some more maps for the bigger sizes but I think flanders could work well as a medium map and I can't think of the name of the other one but there is a german triplane crashed in the middle at the beginning, maybe that could work with 64 as well or perhaps expanded a little?   All I know is there more bullets and the more chaos the more ww1 esq"

VerdunGame,2tmvi8,LIPresume,2,Mon Jan 26 18:32:42 2015 UTC,I think 64 player servers would work the best with the maps we have right now.

VerdunGame,2tk0df,JadedEconomist,4,Sat Jan 24 22:26:02 2015 UTC,"While it is important to equally distribute your forces during defensive actions, make sure everyone covering their point has a battle buddy. Make sure you communicate with a partner and keep everybody updated on enemy movement or direction of fires. If you get schwacked without a battle buddy covering you, than the enemy will have a much easier time overrunning your point, and thus gaining a much easier foothold inside of your perimeter."
VerdunGame,2tk0df,hccole,2,Sun Jan 25 05:39:38 2015 UTC,"If there is a breach in the line or you make one, please announce it in team chat.

VerdunGame,2tk0df,Mcpom,2,Sun Jan 25 16:25:25 2015 UTC,"I got a good one.  If you are playing Alpenjager or the allied equivalent, you can all spawn on each other! Just make sure the message ""x squad members can spawn on you"" is up, if it isn't, there are enemies close, or you're too close to the edge of the map.  3 friends and I have held out an attack for so long because of this squad, that and the recon plane make it a great squad if you have competent people or voice comms for winning a game."

VerdunGame,2tk0df,roadslaya,1 point,Sun Jan 25 04:54:50 2015 UTC,Spread out during defense. Look at the minimap; be aware of where others are and go to an area you feel could use more support. Half the time a trench gets captured it's because the defending team completely neglected one side of their trench and let the enemy overrun it.   This so much. Can't tell you how annoyed I get when teammates camp in one particular area..

VerdunGame,2suv52,Grimauldus14,2,Sun Jan 18 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Know your environment. You want to sprint from crater to crater and don't take unnecessary risks.  Mortar. Try to identify the enemies who are watching your approach. Mortar the area and wait until it starts hitting to advance. Binoculars are your best friend here, especially on larger maps.  Let your squad members advance first. If they die, they just spawn back on you.  Pay attention to the spawn notification on the bottom. If you have dead squad members and the message doesn't appear on the bottom-middle of your screen that ""x# of squad members can spawn on you"", you need to find a new spot."

VerdunGame,2rfq11,rsayers,3,Tue Jan 6 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"I'm at 158 hours and am level 77.  It seems that when I first started playing in June last year that there were a lot of folks that were level 100,  now you hardly see them.  Anyone know why?"

If you can coordinate with these friends and play well, you could be level 100 within 50 hours of game play.  Following NCO orders and staying near your NCO (who should always be attacking unless being a mobile spawn point during the attack phase) will give you bonus points for kills, assists, trench defends, and trench caps.  I failed to do all of that during the first 40-50 hours of gameplay, so it took me about 100 hours to obtain level 100."

VerdunGame,2qqcp1,JadedEconomist,5,Mon Dec 29 23:33:22 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty confident they won't add either of those. Artillery is already represented by the squad commander abilities. Tanks appeared quite late in WWI (spring of 1917), and would fundamentally change the gameplay. Beyond that, I get the feeling that adding tanks would require a hell of a lot of new code that the developers may not want to implement for something that, if it were to not become overwhelmingly overpowered, would be available in very limited numbers."
VerdunGame,2qqcp1,T-Shirt_Ninja,1 point,Tue Dec 30 05:15:24 2014 UTC,Yeah and the dev team is tiny also...
VerdunGame,2qqcp1,williegumdrops,3,Tue Dec 30 16:58:10 2014 UTC,This addressed in the discussions and guides on steam.  Short answer: no.
VerdunGame,2qqcp1,Pure_Politics,4,Tue Dec 30 14:05:01 2014 UTC,Maybe artillery could work? But tanks on the other hand definitely not. The practical reasons for not having tanks is that with the rendition of tanks comes the rendition of classes having to deal with said tanks. You'll end up with anti-tank classes or engineers which sole purpose would be to take down or repair a tank and that's it.
VerdunGame,2qnuno,Midnight_Sheep,3,Mon Dec 29 00:22:30 2014 UTC,Most of the time when I have more than 40 seconds to go back I just sit tight and do as much damage or charge in to kill unsuspecting enemies
VerdunGame,2qnuno,the_flying_almond_,3,Mon Dec 29 02:11:04 2014 UTC,yeah I've gotten to the point where I'll just post up in a spot with cover to my side and just shoot enemies charging ahead. They rarely will expect someone to be laying on the side of a artillery crater with an MG shooting from the flank. Can easy get a few kills every time.  I've cleared multiple squads at a time before they can realize where I am with an MG.   Once time runs out you just post up for defense.

VerdunGame,2qj3eh,T-Shirt_Ninja,1 point,Sat Dec 27 17:43:23 2014 UTC,"Just need to ask a couple of obvious questions. Are you all on the same server? Have you tried searching each others' Verdun names? Or your Verdun player ID? You can see both on the main menu by clicking on the ""Account"" tab. Steam names, steam ids, and steam account numbers won't work in Verdun because it has its own separate friend system."

VerdunGame,2qidrz,WildBeast26,3,Sat Dec 27 05:43:40 2014 UTC,"I agree that something should be changed with the squad leveling system, as it currently is pretty difficult to get a high level squad, and those few who do have one are at a pretty significant advantage.  However, I can't really agree with your first point, because not only would increasing the map length require a hell of a lot of work (because that would really just mean making the map bigger, a significant task for a team of 3 people), but it would also make the maps much more similar. Is Flanders of the length you envision, or something even longer? Because that map takes a long time to traverse, and I honestly wouldn't want to increase it beyond that. And having some variation is nice, though one map (is it Vosges? The one that only has two trenches to fight over?) really is too small.  I'm also really not sure why you would want even faster cap speed. It's quite fast already, and increasing it would make defense extremely difficult, especially on Picardie and Flanders, where the defenders have to run quite far to get to the trench they're defending. But if you have a compelling reason, I'm willing to listen."

I do believe there are plans for a suppressing fire effect, although I haven't been paying too close attention to the planned features recently. The gas attacks are a relatively recent addition though, so there are definitely still new game mechanics being added.

Bullet drop. I know bullets take time to get where they have to, but do they have arched trajectories or not?   Do you sometimes get this weird bug that player models climb to the sky and seem like god is over the battlefield?   How do squad buffs work?   Thank you in advance"
VerdunGame,2pz8oa,Wumponator,3,Sun Dec 21 20:26:14 2014 UTC,"The misaligned sights do affect accuracy, so you'll want to hold shift to line them up better. Bullet drop is only apparent at a very far range, and only slightly. Leading your targets, if they are moving at all perpendicular to you, is far more important. Squad upgrading works by collecting xp with players. Xp you earn with the players in your squad never goes away, so playing with the same people a lot will make your squad level higher with them. Sorry if the squad level explanation didn't make much sense, it's kinda hard to describe."
VerdunGame,2pz8oa,T-Shirt_Ninja,1 point,Sun Dec 21 21:13:21 2014 UTC,"/u/Wumponator did a good job answering most of your questions, so I won't repeat the same answers. I haven't encountered the bug you mention, but it might be a recent thing, since I haven't played all that much the last week or two.  Here's my explanation from a previous post on how squad rank works:   Squad rank. This is the rank your squad has attained, and it's probably the most confusing of all, and probably needs a rework (despite that I kinda like it because it means my friend and I, when we still played a lot, were usually the only ones with sector artillery). It is determined by adding together all of the mutual xp that you and your squadmates have earned. Mutual xp is, I believe, calculated thus: player 1 in the squad earns 800 xp in a match, player 2 earns 500, and player 3 earns 1000. The mutual xp for player 1 and player 2 is 1300, for p2 and p3 is 1500, and for p1 and p3 is 1800. Therefore, the squad, if the three players have never played together before, has a total of 1300+1500+1800=4600xp. The squad rank is determined from this amount of xp (I have no idea how much xp you need for each rank, although it's quite a bit)"

VerdunGame,2p1x92,Shadowstaker,3,Fri Dec 12 05:32:27 2014 UTC,"This is covered in the official guide in the steam community hub, but I will give you a brief summary.  When it comes to class weapons, your personal level in each class effects your access to the higher ranked weapons.  Your squad level will be different with different people in your squad. The key to getting a higher squad level, and thus access to better squad perks, is to play with the same 1-3 people. When with those people, your squad level will remain constant and increase over time.  Your personal level overall is more for getting the XP achievements and bragging rights than anything else."

VerdunGame,2orxeq,rsayers,2,Tue Dec 9 18:04:34 2014 UTC,"Flanders and Picardie are just larger maps, so those games have a longer time limit,  around 40 minutes I think.  Plus they each allow both teams to lose a lot of real estate before losing.  So those games tend to go longer, which is why they seem to always be up.  Vosges, Argonne have much shorter games.  On Voges for example, each side can lose their trench, and if they fail to recapture, game over.   Artois, the newer map seems to be somewhere in the middle as time limits go.  But with that mix in rotation, you'll always end up seeing Flanders and Picardie more often simply because they are longer games."

VerdunGame,2oi82u,T-Shirt_Ninja,1 point,Sun Dec 7 00:25:33 2014 UTC,"You unlock new weapons loadouts by ranking up each specific class, which you do simply by gaining experience (which you mostly get for killing people). The confusing part is, you rank up in three different ways:  1) Personal rank. This is an overall rank that your character has. It doesn't really do anything, but it does show other players that you've been playing the game for a while when you have a high rank, but you reach personal rank 100 a lot faster than you rank up your classes.  2) Class rank. This is the rank for each class in the game. It is specific to every class in every squad on each team, so ranking up one class will in no way affect your rank on any other class. This is the only way you unlock new weapon loadouts, which you can then select from the squad screen. Note that loadouts are self-contained. That is, each loadout is separate, not additive to the other loadouts.  3) Squad rank. This is the rank your squad has attained, and it's probably the most confusing of all, and probably needs a rework (despite that I kinda like it because it means my friend and I, when we still played a lot, were usually the only ones with sector artillery).

Therefore, the squad, if the three players have never played together before, has a total of 1300+1500+1800=4600xp. The squad rank is determined from this amount of xp (I have no idea how much xp you need for each rank, although it's quite a bit). Also, this is the mechanic I'm least certain of, so if anyone knows that I'm completely and utterly wrong, please let me know!  And finally: yeah, the weapons really are unbalanced, and they really haven't even hit a good level of asymmetrical balance for the two teams yet. However, I haven't found the difference so awful that it makes the game unfun to play yet, but that's my personal opinion. I'm pretty confident that things will continue to improve though; the devs are a small team but they are very dedicated to the game."

It is in beta after all. This game is consuming my life slowly but surely. I do like this ranking system though, so i actually have weapon ranks to work for!  If you want to play sometime add me on steam, i need some people to play with!  http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratchetmolly/"

Finding a game is no problem right now. What I do miss is advanced rifle mechanics and ballistics/ranging. Overall, its a good game for a low price and it's worth it IMO."
VerdunGame,2ocqip,Ack_Ack88,4,Fri Dec 5 10:53:25 2014 UTC,"IT does have ballistics and ranging, perhaps not quite as good as RO2s but still better than the majority of online shooters."
VerdunGame,2ocqip,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Fri Dec 5 16:31:26 2014 UTC,"It does yes, but rifles have no way of ranging iron sights... which means if you have to aim high using iron sights, the sight itself will obstruct your line of sight towards the target.

I've run into very few game-breaking bugs, and I've been playing it for nearly a year now. The gameplay really is pretty unique (yeah, I know, RO2 is apparently similar, but still), the gas attacks have been a neat recent addition, and the community is generally pretty pleasant, and at the moment still small enough that I often recognize at least one name in every game I play."

VerdunGame,2ns0re,bday420,2,Sun Nov 30 15:15:44 2014 UTC,It's tough to teach noobs when there is no voice chat. Just text. But to be really honest if you played enough RO2 you'll be fine. Learning how to move in cover quickly bounding crater to crater and choosing targets is hardest and most frustrating thin to learn in RO2 an now Verdun.   The gameplay is kinda weird though. Took me a while to figure out how reinforcements and different squad types worked  IMHO weapon unlocks are way to fast. I had everything by level 10
VerdunGame,2ns0re,XXLpeanuts,0,Sun Nov 30 00:22:10 2014 UTC,I havnt unlocked a weapon yet and im at like level 20 or 30.
VerdunGame,2ns0re,bday420,1 point,Sun Nov 30 18:16:41 2014 UTC,That's impossible. You get like 6-10 rifle kills and it unlocks the tier II of that class. Can get tier II in one match easily and not even be very good.
VerdunGame,2ns0re,only_does_reposts,1 point,Mon Dec 1 00:39:20 2014 UTC,Well I have uberwald thing III and somehing like 30 kills and no unlocks that I know of
VerdunGame,2ns0re,bday420,1 point,Tue Dec 2 02:01:00 2014 UTC,Sometimes the unlocks will give you the same rifle just more grenades or different secondary. You can def have most everything unlocks by level 15 in reality. Squad unlocks take a fucking  long time since you have to play with the same people.
VerdunGame,2ns0re,Sooawesome36,2,Tue Dec 2 05:24:13 2014 UTC,"So Im assuming you bought it, and I just wanted to ask. Do you think that Verdun is still like Red Orchestra?"

But yeah, it gets everybody hooked with being like RO2, when the truth is, no game will ever be like RO2. There will never be an enjoyable, realistic WWI game. Even mods for RO2 died out. I just wish I was a game developer, then I could make my own god damn WWI game like RO2. The Somme looked promising, but got scrapped."

VerdunGame,2ns0re,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Sat Nov 29 20:47:34 2014 UTC,"The only bad thing about the game, well the two bad things coming from RO2 are 1) there is no voice chat, which results in literally no teamwork what so ever, coming from RO2 this is a serious gripe of mine that makes me not play the game often. 2) They recently made the retarded decision to disable friendly fire, not even make it a server side setting but disable it all together, and thus the game doesnt feel as realistic as it could, but the gameplay makes up for that."
VerdunGame,2ns0re,mingamongo,1 point,Sun Nov 30 18:15:48 2014 UTC,"I'm usually on the fence about friendly fire, but Verdun can be so chaotic that I think it would be almost unplayable if there were friendly fire."

Gunfights are frantic, trench assaults are perilous and never one-sided, and matches are often drawn out, bloody, and frustrating affairs that achieve what? Absolutely nothing."
VerdunGame,2ihkpf,hccole,8,Tue Oct 7 03:27:24 2014 UTC,"It's not quite as realistic in many aspects as RO2/RS, but I saw Verdun from the beginning as almost a copy of those games, but set in WW1 with different game modes.

VerdunGame,2htup0,Smelliestnun,1 point,Tue Sep 30 12:45:59 2014 UTC,"A little late to the party I know, but some people in fact probably many playing a world war 1 game would appreciate some historical accuracy and a certain degree of realism. They are trying to appeal to the bulk of their users which clearly isn't you, I personally appreciate the realism and  think that they are constantly imporving the game. Gas is actually quite useful i actually saw a match yesterday where the germans had a wonderful use of bromide gas and it cleared most of the trench because many of the entente forces forgot about their masks, us germans put our masks on and took the trench. Also the use of pistols, if you knew anything about world war one you would know that the fighting wasn't people firing at eachother from long range but much of it was close up and personal combat, the use of pistols and clubs adds to the game. If you think that realism and historical accuracy ruin a game then maybe you should go back to knifing 8 year olds in Cod."
VerdunGame,2htup0,stuka444,1 point,Mon Oct 27 16:56:00 2014 UTC,"The gas isn't useless if you have squad high enough, getting there is difficult and some tutorial explanation on squads would be fantastic. The squad doesn't all have pistol, one has a rifle when you start in it. While starting gas might not be effective in killing it can be used as a sort of smoke screen/deterrent/irritant if used properly.   I am not sure how it's hard for you to identify teammates but that will come with time. You're likely used to the just blue/grey but all they added is a tan/khaki not that close to grey. You'll get used to it and if it was fun when you first bought it then you didn't really waste 9 dollars did you?"

VerdunGame,2h7jbo,walrusvonzeppelin,2,Tue Sep 23 15:07:40 2014 UTC,The new Canadian weapons seem like they might need some nerfing. I feel like I was getting railed by the Enfields (SMLE) while behind cover and I'm not even going to get into the hip firing Lewis gun. And the new German Stormtroopers only having pistols and trench shovels is a bit of a handicap. But the gas is great. Can use it as a smoke screen as well which is something I've been dying for for ages. But I do love this game.
VerdunGame,2h7jbo,angrydroid,2,Tue Sep 23 23:21:30 2014 UTC,"Considering the Luger is amazing, I don't see the gas squad as being handicapped. Getting 100+ meter kills with it are a regular thing.  The lewis is useless running and gunning. No one with more than 5 hours of gameplay gets killed by that sillyness.  I will agree that the Enfield is a beast. 10 rounds, quick fire cycle, powerful, and accurate. Then again, it has to make up for the lewis, Webley (which isn't awful, but not nearly as good as the luger), and the trench club."
VerdunGame,2h50gs,ZeTian,5,Mon Sep 22 16:31:24 2014 UTC,"Everything but the tank and air warfare, air warfare would mean the maps would have to be 3-4 times the size they are now, and tanks would have to be realistic like everything else in game, so that means being a tank would SUCK BALLS."
VerdunGame,2h50gs,XXLpeanuts,2,Mon Sep 22 19:35:54 2014 UTC,"Not only that, but they would have to add some sort of damage system to the tanks in order for infantry to combat them realistically. For example, breakable treads, etc."
VerdunGame,2h50gs,btwinch,3,Wed Oct 1 18:56:31 2014 UTC,"Much longer sprinting time, I want to be able to charge into a trench and shoot/stab the enemy, not run 5m take cover and breath and then jog slowly into the trench to only then get shot   I agree, going to assault an enemy trench, run all the way from my trench only to get shot as i slowly walk there loses the appeal after the 10th time.    Community made servers.   Only once the player base gets bigger, don't want to split an already tiny amount.   The edition of ANZACS, (and perhaps a Gallipoli based map) I asked this on the server a while ago and they were diplomatic in their answers but didn't say no. looking hopeful! Maybe MAYBE tank and air warfare. I would love it but I know it will most likely not make it and is/never was in the devs interests to add it in the future.   They won't add tanks or air warfare, they want the game to be about the infantry."

VerdunGame,2ff78u,XXLpeanuts,2,Thu Sep 4 13:30:26 2014 UTC,"no, that was just a joke, as far as i know the game was just broken."
VerdunGame,2ff78u,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Thu Sep 4 16:03:44 2014 UTC,would be funny though if they did add a bug like easter egg.
VerdunGame,2ff78u,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Thu Sep 4 16:11:15 2014 UTC,I think it would be fantastic if there was something you could do to make the game break out in Christmas music and let it snow.
VerdunGame,2ff78u,skullknap,1 point,Thu Sep 4 17:07:18 2014 UTC,There should be a no-mans land football level where you just play football with christmas music.
VerdunGame,2ff78u,cheekia,1 point,Thu Sep 4 17:33:49 2014 UTC,"I think they did something like that last christmas, with snowballs as weapons which did no damage"

VerdunGame,2enxxg,GriefSeeds,3,Tue Aug 26 21:17:45 2014 UTC,"Holy shit balls, could this now be considered a game worthy of love (like my love for RO2)."
VerdunGame,2enxxg,XXLpeanuts,2,Tue Aug 26 22:02:07 2014 UTC,"Bullet drop and leading is by far the biggest thing. No longer do we have bolt action laser rifles, hurray!"
VerdunGame,2elhmc,angrydroid,1 point,Tue Aug 26 03:54:39 2014 UTC,Awesome.
VerdunGame,2dxmix,heplyderply,5,Mon Aug 18 23:52:30 2014 UTC,I think with those specs you'll probably find the game unplayable :(
VerdunGame,2dxmix,madareklaw,2,Tue Aug 19 01:31:50 2014 UTC,Aw man. guess I'll save my money and build a pc
VerdunGame,2dxmix,madareklaw,1 point,Tue Aug 19 01:32:28 2014 UTC,If you want a WW1 fps that will run on those specs you could try WW1 source

VerdunGame,2dlfw7,ericszoo,3,Fri Aug 15 01:24:20 2014 UTC,I'd love to see the A.E.F.
VerdunGame,2dlfw7,gSpartan150,3,Fri Aug 15 12:46:13 2014 UTC,The introduction of the Austrians would be nice but would absolutely love to see the Italians.
VerdunGame,2dlfw7,Groundpenguin,2,Fri Aug 15 19:13:51 2014 UTC,"I would love to see some battles in the Alps, one of the most forgotten portions of the war."
VerdunGame,2dlfw7,ByzantineSteve,2,Fri Aug 15 20:39:54 2014 UTC,"Honestly dont ever get to play as British vs Germans even though in both world wars there was a great many battles including both. Its just that games are made by Americans so we have to deal with it being only the US in so much shit, im happy enough playing as France but Britain would be a dream come true."

VerdunGame,2cz9q9,CoachSpo,5,Fri Aug 8 15:21:04 2014 UTC,"You know, I hadn't even noticed that. I hope the devs keep an eye on this subreddit then, that could use some fixing."

VerdunGame,2cjc5n,Wookimonster,2,Sun Aug 3 22:40:08 2014 UTC,"I thought there is already exactly this in game, when ever i have bayoneted someone i have followed through with an animation as if my rifle gets pulled down with the body. Its pretty cool."
VerdunGame,2cjc5n,XXLpeanuts,2,Mon Aug 4 15:17:24 2014 UTC,He means an interactive quick (maybe)  time hand to hand combat. Like the attacker being able to fight it off and turn it around if he's fast enough.
VerdunGame,2cjc5n,Sooawesome36,2,Mon Aug 4 16:18:05 2014 UTC,I would prefer something akin to mount and blade napoleonic wars with a bayonet you can fight and block and do different stabs.
VerdunGame,2cjc5n,XXLpeanuts,3,Mon Aug 4 18:13:55 2014 UTC,"Since I played that quite a bit, I can see the appeal. The issue I would have with that is that it would take too long. /u/Sooawesome36 is right. A short quicktime event would be pretty cool. It isn't necessary, a simple takedown animation would do the trick."
VerdunGame,2cjc5n,Sooawesome36,2,Tue Aug 5 08:41:45 2014 UTC,"If you get behind someone, its gonna be an instakill. But I would like to see what you're saying, but it'd be hard to implement. Think of all the disputes over lag that would cause. I think. Maybe.  And yes, that would be kewl."
VerdunGame,2cgn3s,Gazstoke,1 point,Sat Aug 2 23:53:00 2014 UTC,Looking forward to gas being introduced in the game!
VerdunGame,2cgn3s,amac88,1 point,Thu Aug 14 02:53:55 2014 UTC,Could you post a rundown of some his questions/answers about the future of the game if it's not too much trouble?
VerdunGame,2cgn3s,f_regrain,6,Sun Aug 3 01:35:28 2014 UTC,"Sure, (i was playing so didn't catch everything)  He talked about future map updates, i swear i saw something about winter / snow maps.   British / Canadian Models being added  The use of Gas within the game will be added with gas masks that will be equipped (which will take time to equip and restrict view I think)   Obvious things like the hit box and general stability issues.    They were the main bits really, if i thing of any more or if i watch my vod I'll let you know."
VerdunGame,2cgn3s,f_regrain,2,Sun Aug 3 02:00:52 2014 UTC,"This is great, thanks for the response! I'd love to see some winter maps. That would be interesting."
VerdunGame,2cgihx,fagsatmidnight,3,Sat Aug 2 22:56:50 2014 UTC,"Oh yes please, I am so sick of shooting someone in the arm and they are still have me perfectly lined up. Or shooting MG at someone and they can still pick me off perfectly. If arty had a supression effect as well, that would be favorite. Thinking of it, this game could steal a lot from RO2. Like the ability to slowly move with a deployed MG."
VerdunGame,2cgihx,Wookimonster,1 point,Sun Aug 3 22:32:17 2014 UTC,The game basically needs to take most things from RO2 :D.
VerdunGame,2cfmzt,Sooawesome36,5,Sat Aug 2 16:52:47 2014 UTC,"I agree, would also mean that more experienced players would be using it."
VerdunGame,2cfmzt,Groundpenguin,2,Sat Aug 2 21:54:21 2014 UTC,"Probably should be done that way, although I like being one of the only people (along with a friend of course) that has sector arty. The worry I do have with tying it to NCO level is that it doesn't take very long to hit level 100 with a class, and so very quickly, you'd have nothing but creeping barrages everywhere."
VerdunGame,2cfmzt,T-Shirt_Ninja,1 point,Sat Aug 2 21:59:05 2014 UTC,"Increase level cap. Make creeping barrages 150 and scetor artillery level 100.   Actually, we might have to make it 300 and 150. Its really easy to level up, especially with NCO."
VerdunGame,2cfmzt,AmIMikeScore,2,Sat Aug 2 22:51:20 2014 UTC,"That would be good, to be quite honest, I still haven't understood how the Squad leveling system works exactly. If I make a squad and I fight it in it'll level up. And if I leave someone else can take it over and then I can rejoin at some later time?"
VerdunGame,2cfmzt,Wookimonster,2,Sun Aug 3 22:31:01 2014 UTC,"You know what, I think its borked. None of it seems right. I thought it was that each person contributed, and when they left, their progress was lost, but saved to them if they joined back in. But Im always in my squad, and its level 1 still."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,AmIMikeScore,5,Sat Aug 2 05:37:38 2014 UTC,"Huge nay. These are fairly high caliber rifles. The ranges we are shooting at make no sense to add bullet drop. Even at the most extreme range experienced in game, the drop would be an inch. My concern is that it will bog the engine down. There is already a lot of issues with lag and desync happening. How will bullet drop be handled? Will it be calculated client side and synced with server? Will it happen immediately or after distance? Are the bullets going to be modeled individually? I would much rather have the devs focus on the mastadonic lag issues then add features that don't really add a lot. And if they are insistent on adding features, add the other factions and some new maps."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,for_sweden,3,Mon Aug 11 15:29:19 2014 UTC,"Hell yay. Any game without is lacking, and it will just add to the skill needed to get a shot, something we should all want."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,XXLpeanuts,2,Wed Aug 6 04:43:45 2014 UTC,"I vote yes to bullet drop just to add a little immersion with shooting, currently the laser accurate rifles are a little strange."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,Groundpenguin,3,Sat Aug 2 17:12:01 2014 UTC,"The rifles used during WW1 had an average maximum range of about 1000m, and most of the fighting in game occurs well within that distance. 100m is considered a ""long range"" kill, and the bullet wouldn't begin to drop at that point. Even if they added a proper bullet drop, it's likely that it would have little to no actual effect in game."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,1MonthFreeTrial,1 point,Fri Aug 15 02:28:39 2014 UTC,"You would still have to lead your target, bullets don't travel at the speed of light."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,Groundpenguin,2,Fri Aug 15 06:14:27 2014 UTC,"Right, but that has nothing to do with bullet drop, that's just bullet travel time."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,1MonthFreeTrial,1 point,Fri Aug 15 06:52:04 2014 UTC,"I have to say, when it comes to historical games that are going for historical accuracy they should take physics into account as well. But I'm a big fan of realism in games, though it is pretty nice to be able to aim directly at someone across the field and hit them without compensating.  The thing is, though, the game has a LOT of close range fighting, so it might not even be worth it. Still would be cool, though."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,Apf4,3,Sat Aug 2 07:41:27 2014 UTC,"With the rifles of the period with the maximum effective range of around 1000m, most of the fighting occurs well within that distance. With an achievement for a kill at 100m, which is considered a long range kill, the bullet wouldn't begin to drop at that point.  I'm not even sure how far the draw distance is in the first place. Chances are, even with an accurate bullet drop, there wouldn't be much of a difference. If anything, I think factoring bullet travel time would have a bigger impact. Does this game have travel time? I can't really tell..."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,Mein_Captian,1 point,Sun Aug 3 17:25:30 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty much indifferent. If they add it, fine, I'll get used to it. If they don't, it won't bother me. I play the game for the trench warfare and the gunplay offered by WW1-era rifles, and bullet drop wouldn't change all that much for me."
VerdunGame,2cejpu,T-Shirt_Ninja,0,Sat Aug 2 14:53:40 2014 UTC,"Wouldn't this also widen the gap between skilled players and newbies?  I'd rather see the community and player-base get larger, even if it means that we sacrifice realism and more necessary skill in the game."
VerdunGame,2c8z8u,Druid96,3,Thu Jul 31 16:05:58 2014 UTC,"Have you restarted your computer or made sure that the game .exe actually stopped running when you quit out of it? Other than that, this isn't a problem I've seen before, so I have no specific advice to give you."
VerdunGame,2c8z8u,T-Shirt_Ninja,2,Thu Jul 31 19:02:08 2014 UTC,"yes restarted the game alot of time actually, forced the game to close from the task manager by killing the process, that makes me pretty sure it's closed alright, i checked the firewall again and it's off, i disabled the a/v and yes updated the videocard. so i wish someone have my issue and care to help :) thanks!"
