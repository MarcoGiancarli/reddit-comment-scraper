Here is a paper:  http://www.nature.com/pr/journal/v73/n3/full/pr2012189a.html  Why is Europe likely at peak height? Several reasons. One, your percentage of the population that is young (under 30) is at its lowest level in history. Up until the 1960s, average height in Netherlands was 5'9 for a man. Those men will likely be alive until the 2040s, 2050s.  Also, immigration continues to increase because native-born European men and women have so few children. Considering the overwhelming majority of net migration is from non-European countries, the average height will continue to be brought down.  What happened to the U.S. is happening to northern Europe. U.S. male average peaked in the 1980s and has been stagnant since. Expect the same for Europe.  Also I'm 5'10 and spent nearly a year in a transfer program at University of Oslo.

I know it's been said a million times but it really is your loss if you think that way.   In the USA if a girl only likes men over 6 feet tall she is limiting her dating pool to like 15% of men. If a guy only likes white women he is limiting his dating pool to around 75% of women. There are amazing and attractive people of all shapes/sizes/color.   I suspect the whole requirement thing is about the person with the requirement more then anything. If a secure person meets someone who clicks with them they will date them no matter what society tells them.
short,3e1f9d,kimural0ck,2,Tue Jul 21 12:45:35 2015 UTC,"There is a ""6 feet"" requirement but what most girls actually want is a simple noticeable tall guy, so that would actually lower his height to 5'9-5'10, which is more than 50% of the male population. Especially since most men are around 5'10-5'11 nowadays. They really aren't going to pull a measuring tape and see if you actually are 6 feet, as long as you are noticeable tall that's all they care about. So no, they are not simply focusing on a 15% of the male population. Tall men are still the majority, REALLY TALL men are not."

I think the happier someone is in their own skin the less they need a partner who meets some conventional check list to validate them self.   The whole ""black girls are ugly"" and ""short guys are ugly"" thing to me is just bullying.

short,3e1f9d,kimural0ck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:40 2015 UTC,"How much of this height preference is based on the girls issues? Some girls are not happy with their size and want to feel feminine so they want a guy bigger then them.   Honestly, I think almost all of the broad distaste for short men is about this.   Body size is highly gendered in our culture. Largeness is associated with masculinity and smallness is associated with femininity. Because of this, women who are large (read: in weight or height, or both) tend to feel less feminine because society reads them as less feminine. These women feel extra pressure to be with a tall man because that will ameliorate some of their feelings of being unfeminine due to the size of their own bodies.   Conversely, Men who are small (in weight and height, but for a reason unknown to me height is more important than weight for men) tend to feel less masculine because society reads them as less masculine. Often, men of any size don't want to be with a larger woman because it will challenge their masculinity, since being big is supposed to be a man's role, culturally.   All of this makes big women and small men less attractive to most people who live in our culture. For whatever reason, weight is judged more harshly than height for women (though tall women don't exactly have it easy, either) and height is judged more harshly for men (though fat men don't exactly have it easy, as well). But it all goes back to the way we, as a culture, assign gender to body size."
short,3e1f9d,BeachHouse4lyf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:00 2015 UTC,"The simple reason why height is more valued than weight on men is because at least you can't ""cheat"" with height. So even if you gain tons of muscle mass and gained like 100 lbs of weight, a guy a foot taller than you ""can predictibly gain"" more mass and weight than you for the simple fact you are short. That's pretty much why..."
short,3e1f9d,ozigiri,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I follow you. Are you saying people see a tall man as having the potential to weigh more than a short man, regardless of whether he actually does, so that potential makes height mean more to women than weight?  What are you basing that hypothesis on? Also, if that's the case, why is weight more important than height for women? Why don't men see weight as a potential to fluctuate based on height, which is static, but which seems to not be as important in determining a woman's attractiveness as it is for men?"
short,3e1f9d,BeachHouse4lyf,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:20 2015 UTC,The argument I have heard is this...  Height is the most important physical attribute in men because you can't change it.   Weight on the other hand can change...a small guy can get a great body but they are misrepresenting their bad genetics by doing that.   It's just a silly argument really since a good body represents hard work while being tall represents luck. It would be like preferring the guy who's parents gave them a million dollars over the guy who created his own business and made millions.
short,3e1f9d,kimural0ck,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"For sure 100% agree!  Insecurities can really cloud a person's mind; the way I see it, requirements and preferences (in terms of dating) is an outward manifestation of internal insecurities.   The most sad thing is society (as a whole) is largely to blame when it comes to issues of insecurity. The beauty standards present all across the world are just as fickle as one another but it dictates what's desirable and what's not.  Whether it's directed inwards or outwards, a lot of people fall victim to the mentality that society collectively sets.  It's never a good thing, but the silver lining is it makes the task of avoiding superficial people that much easier."

One main way I see them as being similar is as follows: a large part of why black women are seen as broadly less desirable is because of cultural notions of black femininity as being less feminine than white/Asian/Hispanic femininity. Similarly, a large part of why short men are seen as broadly less desirable is because of cultural notions of short masculinity as being less masculine than tall masculinity.   Blackness, culturally, is associated with hyper-masculinity. This leads to the fetishization of black male sexuality, in some instances, but it also contributes to this image of black women as less docile, less demure, less submissive, and less classically feminine, which is what I think makes black women less attractive to men, broadly.   Shortness, culturally, is associated with femininity. This leads to the fetishization of short women, in some instances, but it also contributes to this image of short men as less strong, less capable, less dominant, and less classically masculine, which is what I think makes short men less attractive to women, broadly.  There really are a lot of parallels between racial and height requirements, and unfortunately for black women and short men, we're suffering from being on the wrong side of (racialized) gender norms."

Also different races are a lot of times raised in a different type of culture, a person from the hood would rarely get a long well with somebody from a nice suburb or have few things in common.

Because they don't fall in the Western ""White"" Beauty standards (Light skin, tall, skinny facial aesthetics, etc.), all which are characteristics most White people share. Now by this even some White people fail to fall into such requirements so the standards aren't solely racist, those are simply ""characteristics"" that this majorly-White society has found necessary in order to claim someone as ""beautiful""."

It's natural to feel more attracted to some set of physical characteristics. I feel more attracted to Asian women, especially Japanese and Korean. Some people don't. But despite being more attracted to Asian women, I had 2 blonde (long term) girlfriends and 1 brunette. And I don't exclude any girl from the realm of my possibilities, considering I've had dates and sexual encounters with tall, short, fat, skinny, white, black... It's sad that some people have such strict requirements as ""no short men"" or ""no black women"". I'm aware we cannot force people into changing their minds, but I just wish those requirements were not spread all over as some kind of absolute truth. We, as humans, are influenced by our peers. Our preferences and requirements suffer heavy influence by what society around us think. If newer generations didn't see such hateful words against some people, they would probably grow up having less strict preferences/requirements. Unfortunately, this is just my wishful thinking."

For example, from someone's weight you can make reasonable assumptions about the person's activity levels, eating habits and a few personality traits. Similarly, from race you can make reasonable assumptions about cultural differences, family values and perhaps interests. Therefore, you can actually use both to make a rough guess about compatibility if you're too lazy or don't have the time to get to know the person.  However, height tells you absolutely nothing about a person. It's most comparable to other traits that don't really correlate with anything else, like shoe size or something."

A guy should always be taller, if a girl isn't slender like a model, she's not worth it, these and those races should be avoided and so on.  This causes some kind of a pressure for me. I don't care about weight (nothing extreme though!), height and race.  My friends do and I just know that they would ridicule me when I would date a chubby or curvy, taller girl of a certain race. It just sucks and I feel bad thinking about it. :(  I've been distancing myself from them because of this and hanging out with other friends more often. I find them to be more mature and less superficial.   I do notice a few differences in mentalities between them. My other friends care less about status. They don't care about big houses, expensive cars and things such as that. They just want to get nice experiences out of life. This while the superficial friends only care about their status.

I'm from southwestern Europe, and while a tall height is of course seen in very positive lights (as in, it is better to be tall than short) and women also like tall men, I have never, ever, seen height requirements or even preferences explicitly stated in dating profiles, or people questioning or mocking other people's heights.

short,3dzzab,kbox,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:45 2015 UTC,"The majority of these standards are coming from Western culture, however. Historically, height wasn't seen as much of a big deal in countries like Japan, for example. In fact, the average height for men in Japan is still 5'7'' (5'2'' for women). Attitudes seem to be changing because of the West.  But it's an interesting conflict of interest. Japan has a huge ""cute"" pop-culture. Chasing tall men produces taller than average women and taller women aren't typically seen as ""cute"".   Honestly, I find all of this interesting. Taller guys that aren't so facially attractive don't have that difficult of a time getting women. But how about Zac Efron (5'8''?) I'm sure he gets plenty of women, but they are probably smaller in size as a consequence of his height. If he paired up with a 5'7''-5'8'' girl and produced a boy, not only is that boy statistically likely to be 5'10''-6'0'' range, but I'm sure would be very good looking. Shit like that confuses me. Sure he's shorter than average, but the kids are almost guaranteed to look beautiful."

Since short-positivity would be more of an issue focused on men, I see it garnering a lot of ridicule. Masculinity is defined in such a way that men aren't allowed to express vulnerability or hurt without being ridiculed for doing so.

It's the same thing. You just ignore it and laugh at it or make fun of her as she makes fun of you/says ""I don't date short guys."" Your odds improve dramatically when you present an aura of indifference. Girls love that and it turns them on. Confidence by itself won't do that.

It's still a numbers game for males.  You don't know whether a person is decent or worthwhile until you interact with them.  And if they automatically reject you based on height, you'll never find anything out about them.     Why would he want to date someone who has an inherent prejudice against short people?   Almost all people are socialized to be prejudiced against short people.  For instance, one study showed that 96% of women self-reported that they wouldn't consider dating a shorter man.  Should OP not want to date 96% of women who are the same height or taller than him?     Now if you're talking about meaningless sex....   I'm not talking about meaningless sex.  I'm talking about relationships.  You can't form a relationship with someone if they reject you as soon as they read a number on a page.

To me, there's a poetic beauty to being near the same size as your significant other, and since I'm short, I have a huge population of near-same-height women to choose from. Kissing, having sex with, cuddling, holding hands with, dancing with, and walking with a partner who is close to the same height just feels so beautifully natural. I absolutely love it.  Not that there aren't great things about being with taller and shorter women, of course.   Also: you get treated poorly for being short as a male-bodied person. That can have deleterious psychological effects, but it can also make you a more empathetic person. I know I am far less judgmental about people's physical appearances because I know what it's like to be made to feel defective because of something I can't control.

Your story also isn't like mine, I had a growth spurt that put me back on the curve for a period of time so the doctors or my mom didn't think anything weird of my height. It wasn't until I was around 14 when I started to fall off the curve. My mom actually still wanted me to get the HGH injections for the possibility of a few inches even if my growth plates were almost closed, I didn't want the injections, didn't think it was worth it. Your genetic potential could've been less or it could've been more as your height isn't solely based on your parents height. My grandfather on my Mom's side was the same height I am now. Thinking about what could've been is not how to look at life if you want to live a happy one."
short,3dz8vz,maxwell_smart_jr,2,Tue Jul 21 10:48:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, I can speak from experience, as I was in stage three clinical trials for Genentech's growth hormone from about 1988-1993.  At that point, it was recognized as a mostly safe treatment, but they were trying it out on thousands of children to more or less flesh out the dose-response relationship and to find any evidence for rare side effects.  I was diagnosed with isolated GH deficiency, and monitored very carefully with extensive bloodwork and physicals at the hospital 4x per year.  I started treatment at 8.5yrs, at 42lbs and 3'10"", and by the time I was your daughter's age, I was 67lbs, and 4'6"".  Before treatment, I was growing less than 2"" per year, and all during about five years of treatment averaged just under 4"" per year.  Early on, my parents gave the shots, but by the time I was your daughter's age, I was doing it myself with a spring-loaded contraption.  Insulin needles are very fine too- it is not an exaggeration to say that many days, I could barely feel the needle going in.  I think that being short is definitely harder on boys in many respects, and also, I don't think that my parents handled some things very well.  They read the books that encouraged them to ""allow your child to develop talents that don't depend on height, like art, and non-team sports.""  But unfortunately, that somewhat translated to ""you will be bad at team sports because you are short.""  So, as far as your daughter goes, I think she is heading into things with a much stronger sense of self and perspective than I had at her age.  The effect of GH was pretty much immediate.  Practically overnight, my appetite increased enormously.  I had no side effects of any sort, and growing taller helped so much in many ways.  I was pretty passive and easy-going, and bullied a bit, and being short it felt like there was no recourse and I had to take it, but being taller just let me feel like I had the choice to let things roll off my back.  Also, I very definitely found out that height really does affect the way people perceive you, holding everything else constant.  Furthermore, how height is regarded changes as you grow older.  In middle school, when girls towered over me, I had no problem asking them to dance, because they were also towering over other boys too, and that was just, to me at least, one of those common middle school experiences.  But later on when most everyone grows out of that experience except for you, expectations change a bit.  My regret might be that I was having some problems being shorter than everyone else, and in some ways I feel I was lead to believe that height would be an instant fix, and I did not get a lot of help with some problems with self-esteem.  Anyway, going on to the height side of things, with GH deficiency, your daughter most likely has a much younger bone-age than her actual (chronological) age.  Growth stops when the skeleton reaches a certain level of maturity, and starting from a young bone age means basically that she has a larger window for growth than typically developing children would have.  Also, it seems that there are not too many problems with side-effects, as you may expect given that GH is first of all, a bio-identical molecule to what is ordinarily produced in the human body, and also, is replaced to normal-levels rather than supra-normal levels.  So, really, in many ways, treatment restores your body's chemical environment to what it would have been without the deficiency.  So bottom line, I would think that you could expect treatment to rapidly increase your daughter's height, but it won't solve all height-related problems.  Also, please feel free to comment or PM if you have any other questions."

short,3dxadk,ezinc,25,Mon Jul 20 08:21:16 2015 UTC,"There's so much emphasis on dating because relationships are a big part of life.   Being alone for a long time and facing rejection after rejection can really chip away at a person's self esteem and make the relationship issue start to seem bigger than any other issue.   It can make other accomplishments in life feel a bit hollow and even make things a person used to enjoy seem less enjoyable after a while.     It really can weigh on a person's mind and it's hard to shake that, especially when you are outside of the preference/requirement range of a large majority of the opposite sex.   As long as the preference for taller is as lopsided as it is we're going to be seeing quite a few threads about the dating issue.  And they will likely get heated at times too since when discussing frustrating things like dating people's emotions run high.  That said, you're right there are more pressing issues (which do get discussed on this sub a lot) that affect both sexes negatively that don't revolve around dating.    The dating issue is just a side effect of the bigger issue that is heightism.       How is the dating issue a side effect?  Well, when short stature is treated like a huge negative in our society and that mentality is pushed by our media (and pushed a LOT when it comes to relationships) then preference in the dating world is going to reflect that.    What's pushed as ""good"" is going to be thought of as desirable in the dating world.  What's pushed as ""bad"" is going to be thought of as undesirable in the dating world.   The views of our society are molded by the media... it's sad but true.  So basically for there to be any progress on the dating side effect we can't just focus on that side effect.   The short=bad mentality that's a big problem in our society and pushed by our media needs to be dealt with.   Once that stops being pushed then we'll see that dating issue start to slowly become less of an issue.  In my opinion that will also help many of the other issues caused by heightism like how short people are often less respected in the work place, not taken as seriously, make less, less likely to get promoted, etc.     The media really has fucked over short people and from what I've seen it's gotten worse in the past 20 years.  Hm...sorry to ramble...  As for disliking my height?  I don't dislike my height.   Haven't disliked it since I was in middle school really.    It's part of who I am and has definitely helped make me who I am today.    I've said it before, if someone paid me to have LL surgery to be 6'0"" I wouldn't do it.  I'm fine the way I am.      I think you'll find there are a lot of people here who don't dislike their height and don't wish they were taller yet still talk about dating struggles and heightism.  A person can talk about those frustrating issues without hating their height & wishing they were taller.     I'll admit though... sometimes I wish some of the dismissive people that stop by here (not directing this at you OP) would wake up one day as a very short guy and maybe they'd start to see that the issues people talk about over here are not made up."

short,3dxadk,Fredalus,20,Mon Jul 20 09:10:51 2015 UTC,"I think there's emphasis on dating for a few reasons:   Dating is one of the only places where someone can outright say: ""No, you're too short"" without much backlash if any. I can't think of many other places that would fly - except perhaps a basketball court. I'm sure this negatively affects short men. I take it many short men have reconciled themselves with the idea that they won't make the NBA at 5'1"". They understand that basketball is made easier with height. This is a fact of the game.  But a taller person does not automatically make a better man. The heightism in dating does not flow logically like it does in basketball. And when a 5'1"" girl rejects a 5'6"" man for being too short, I can only imagine how that man must feel. He's significantly taller than her, she can wear her heels and everything, but it's still not good enough. Dating reflects self-worth. This varies person-to-person, so I'll speak for myself. Women look for a lot of qualities. To date successfully you need to be funny, smart, charismatic, athletic, not completely broke, etc. You don't need to check every single box, but a fair amount of them. Have you noticed women aren't widely expected to be funny, for example?  Anyway, my ability to attract women proves to me that I am funny enough, smart enough, interesting enough, attractive enough, etc. It matters a lot to me. Dating matters a lot to me.  Height is often a preliminary requirement. Think of holistic college admissions - your grades and test scores determine whether you're qualified to attend a school; your essay, interviews, and extracurricular activities determine whether you're interesting enough to be admitted.  In the same way, your personality traits determine whether you're interesting enough to attract women - but if you're not tall enough, you were never qualified anyway. All the work you put into yourself is disregarded. This is the true tragedy. Dating is the problem with the most evidence. You can pull pictures off social media of women saying ""6 feet+ only."" I've yet to see a tweet from an employer saying ""Men over 6 feet get an extra $5,000 yearly."" People tend to talk about things they see - dating is seen the most.  And other problems are often ignored or glossed over because it's easy to do so. I sometimes see posts here along the lines of: A short actor was cast in a feature film! My reaction is always: ""So what? They're going to make him stand on a box or use some camera tricks to rectify his height.""  You see people summarily dismiss short men as bitter and hung up on their height. They use this to explain their reduced success in dating, but it's not a complete sell. They downplay it.  Ultimately, I can see that for a guy who's 5'9.5"" and talks about his height all the time. And I hate hearing 5'11"" men complain about not being 6'0"". But at 5'5""? 5'3""? 5'0""?

short,3dxadk,Gonz84,9,Mon Jul 20 10:09:07 2015 UTC,"Lets be frank, the average age of most Redditors is early 20s..Most guys in that age bracket want to date and have sex most of the time. Its actually pretty normal when you think of it like that."

short,3dxadk,BeachHouse4lyf,3,Mon Jul 20 23:51:14 2015 UTC,"Or is society's perception of masculinity in correlation to height (in job hunting or everyday treatment) a more pressing issue than dating?   Society's perception of masculinity being tied to tallness is precisely why women generally don't find shortness in men attractive, so they aren't really distinct issues. The one causes the other.   And I don't dislike my height; I love it."
short,3dxadk,Gonz84,2,Mon Jul 20 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"I know you are really about feminism but as I see it our current generation of men are getting dangerously feminine to the point of being giant wussies. This may be the classic case of ""when I was your age we walked 10 miles to school and liked it"" but you cant deny the wussification of the American male.  While I dont endorse having males be emotionless and not be able to voice their doubts and concerns I am very against raising a generation of whiny little boys who are fragile and weak. We may be on the wrong side of the masculine perception spectrum with our size but that still doesn't warrant turning all men into (and I honestly hate using RP terminology but it fits well here ) little beta males.  I apologize if this is a false accusation on your way of thinking but I think losing all of our masculinity in favor of everybody turning into this androgynous future is going a bit far..again you could have zero intentions of this, I just wanted to get this out there."
short,3dxadk,5inBelowAverage,4,Tue Jul 21 11:29:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think most men base their ENTIRE own self worth on what women think of their attractiveness. But it's a hugely important part of a man's life and the way he sees himself and compares himself to his peers beginning in puberty and lasting throughout his life. You can be content with most aspects of your life and specific situations like career, hobbies, etc and still be unsuccessful and severely unhappy with your sex/love life. Most of it is not exactly a rational choice, otherwise I bet you'd see a lot more celibate monks around. Being intimately lonely, involuntarily celibate or sexually frustrated is bound to reduce anyone's life quality, whether male or female.  I don't think I'd be feeling too bad about my height if I had a dream partner, but it would also be great to ""feel like"" most other men (got a taste of that while traveling in Asia) and not that I stand out or look like a kid physically when around the usual average six footers where I live. I'm sure it would be easier to get ""automatic respect"" in the workplace from both men and women and get new male friends in certain crowds. It would also be nice to not have to look up at 30% of women. So yeah, I'd love to be at least a few inches taller, not just because of dating."

Short guys (except for that one teleporting short guy who can get every girl) are told by the majority of women: no, I won't date you because of your height. It's totally okay. It's one of the things that societies seems to accept and encourage.   Height is also related to jobs, but the majority of the time I doubt an interviewer will say ""No, because your short"". Apparently in some countries the job requirements do have a minimum height but I don't see that. I have seen some posts about it.   Everyday treatment is posted about quite a bit."

What if this great protector decides to turn against you one day, do you feel protected now? Also tall guys are usually lazy pussies because they are used to getting everything handed to them? Basically women would rather get assaulted by a tall man than give a short (er than average) man a chance. It's time we stop calling it a ""preference"" and name it for what it is, a god damn requirement. Guys have no such hard set requirement about anything women can come up with, so why do women get to have this ridiculous requirement? Your height or taller should be the only acceptable ""preference"", none of this ""taller by five inches when I'm wearing heels"" bullshit.

short,3duto6,streetlightin,12,Sun Jul 19 23:03:58 2015 UTC,"or there are currently countries where short men have very little rights at all.   The United States doesn't have any Federal legislation to protect the rights of short people.  And only Michigan has a law which extends equal protection to short people in terms of employment and civil contracts.    Heightism can be framed as an institutional form of oppression, similar to racism, sexism, etc.  But we need examples for the critics who claim that heightism is a private prejudice instead of a systemic one.  So, by ""institutional"" or ""systemic"" I am talking about examples of discrimination or disparate treatment carried out by organized groups (governments, companies, government entities, clubs, Universities, media outlets, etc.)   Here are a few I came up with earlier, but I'm sure we can come up with a fuller list.     [Government] Only 1 out of 50 states guarantees equal rights to short people in terms of employment and government contracts (Michigan). [University System] Up until the 1960s Ivy League Schools had policies excluding short men from admission (Gladwell talks about this at Harvard and Yale when they started an in person interview process to weed out short men - you even had to list your height on the old applications). [corporate/industry] Most U.S. sperm banks will not accept donations from men who are shorter than 5'8"" because they know the sperm will not be marketable - regardless of the donor's other qualifications.   [Government] As of 2000, the United States Government (through the FDA) has designated healthy male children who are projected to have an adult height shorter than 5'3"" to be diseased and a candidate for treatment, even if they are producing healthy and normal growth hormone. The reason for this is that the government determine that the child's adult quality of life will be so low that it should be a disease unto itself. [Government - public schools] Short boys are bullied in public schools with very little legal recourse to protect them. At least three short boys (documented) have killed themselves this year because they were bullied because of heightism. [corporate/industry] The wage gap in the job market based on height is comparable (or greater) than the gender wage gap (depending on how it's calculated).

Hypocrite?   The submission took the title of the article from the website it was on.  That wasn't Geoff's title, it was the title Alison Taylor from ""The Independent"" chose.   If you hang around here for more than a couple days you'll see that Geoff has said numerous times that preference and/or requirement in the dating world is not heightism.       everytime a post talking about short women's problems are downvoted or dismissed as not real problems.   That's just not true at all.   I'd like you to find me one of those threads started by a woman talking about how heightism affects them that was downvoted heavily.       Yes we have some users (and trolls here) who will dismiss the problems short women face, but that's not the entire sub nor is it even the majority here.  Oh and yes I agree heightism does affect women.   It affects them in many of the same ways it affects short men when it comes to lack of respect, opinions being taken seriously, the workplace, being promoted, etc etc.     And yes it's quite annoying to see a small handful of vocal people and trolls dismiss that and many times flat out ignore it exists, especially considering I've seen it in person  with my mother (she's about 4'11"").   I for one would love to see more threads started by women about how it affects them.   /u/mike5f4 started one a couple years ago and the comments were upvoted.  Here is that thread.     I'm betting most of the other regulars here would be very thankful to have more threads started by women about experiences with heightism they've dealt with in life.   It might help some of the people who think it doesn't affect women start to realize that it certainly does.   It might also encourage more discussion on the topic since people would see they aren't going to be downvoted for posting threads like that.   Only way I can see a thread like that being downvoted here is if it's laced with insults towards /r/short.   Everytime a taller person's legitimate gripes such as fitting into bathrooms and airliner seats is mocked as not real problems.   Even people on /r/tall seem to get a bit tired of the shower head/airline seat posts.    Besides, short people don't exactly fit well in stuff either.  I certainly wouldn't compare the fact that stuff isn't made for someone my height or the height of someone very tall with societal discrimination like heightism.      No, only submissions allowed here are specific instances of women's preferences and opinions being used as justification for broad brushed attacks against women or feminists in general, which if such tactics were levied against short men, would surely have drawn even more fury.   You're ignoring the numerous other posts that have nothing to do with what you're talking about.  The mods aren't only ""allowing"" stuff talking about dating preference here.     Here is a good place to start.  It's the top posts here on /r/short.    As for the broad brushed attacks against women or feminists?  I agree with you I don't like that either...  however you're making the same broad brushed attacks against the members here based on the vocal minority and some trolls.    Like Geoff said if you make a mental note or even write down the names of the people who are doing things like dismissing women's problems, making shitty comments about all women, etc etc you'll start to notice that while they are very vocal (and many are on new accounts, possible trolls) they certainly don't represent the majority.  For example:   how can you expect women to take to short men when all they are seeing is how self loathing, angry, bitter, and misogynistic they are on this subreddit?   If you don't like generalizations made about groups of people then don't go do the same thing  you're accusing others of doing.    Look at it this way.  What do people use as examples when they are generalizing feminism (or any group they want to discredit)?  They use a handful of the loudest, most obnoxious, most extreme hateful people they can find right?    What do people use when they generalize /r/short?    Same type of thing.     It's confirmation bias...if a person  already has dismissed the group as being hateful & bitter then they'll see what confirms their bias and everything else that doesn't gets ignored.

You all wouldn't last a day as a woman with small breasts in a world where large breasts   Ignoring the fact that women can pad or augment their breasts pretty easily, your argument fails because men sexualize all breasts, not just the small ones. Yes, most men love big breasts but they still love small breasts too(there are probably more men who prefer small breasts than there are women who prefer short men). They also love nice asses, legs, feet, waistlines and pretty faces, some times more than they love breasts. What they don't do, at least not on a cultural/global level,  is treat women with small breasts as second class citizens, or women that should just ""know their place"" and not talk to them, because they have small breasts. There's not a lot of men out there who would be offended, resentful or angry that he has small breasts in his hands, but there are certainly be a lot of women who would be offended, resentful or angry that a short guy tried to get in their pants.    /flatchested subreddit filled with daily posts constantly   Why would you? Even the most flat-chested of women still get treated better by men than than short men get treated by women. Even the most flat-chested woman, regardless of any kind of social skills or professional success, would still find herself with far more success and suitors than your average man would, let alone your average short man. You wouldn't see that type of attitude there because women are just so blatantly privileged when it comes to sex and dating(though, I'm sure you'd find plenty of posts in large-breast subs complaining about how men are pigs and gross for liking their large breasts though)."

I don't think we really have a choice in this.  Finding a woman who actually prefers shorter men to taller men would be like finding a needle in a haystack.  I've had several great relationships, but I've never been able to trick myself into thinking that they wouldn't like it better if I were taller.  However, that doesn't negatively effect the relationship at all because that's true of pretty much all people when it comes to some variable.  You're always going to wish that your SO was a little more _____ or a little less ____.  But that's because no one is ""perfect"".  And yet....it still works.     Dating a woman and finding out she doesn't find me attractive as a whole would really hurt me.   Even women who are more attracted to taller men can still find short men attractive.  Don't demand that she finds everything about you attractive.  You're not going to find everything about her attractive."

short,3duu8d,Gonz84,3,Sun Jul 19 20:45:53 2015 UTC,Problem is that your putting height in the same league as maybe balding or a big nose..a small gap in teeth etc. I think we both know its considered a lot more of a unattractive trait than those things.
short,3duu8d,GiiiZz,6,Sun Jul 19 23:15:05 2015 UTC,"Nope.  I'm not putting height in with those things.  Height is a much bigger deal breaker than any of those things in dating.

It is obvious that looks matter. Be it height or weight or facial features. If you wouldn't date a super ugly girl (sorry if that sounds offensive) because of the way she looks making her unattractive to you, can you really blame a woman for feeling the same about your height ? That she is able to overlook it is (to me at least) what matters.

Flat, fat, and old women can find men who would prefer them over the opposite. Others could claim those traits are objectively inferior/uglier, but somehow I feel like people would be offended. Somehow it's not fair when short men feel the same way. Other traits are a matter of preference, but our height is objectively a flaw?

I also doubt they use phrases like ""tall dark and handsome"" or ""Napoleon Complex."" Thus they care much less about height, if at all. They are not socially conditioned the way modern humans are."
short,3duu8d,Tim226,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:29 2015 UTC,"Blaming this on media is kind of a weird stretch though.   Consider this, among a tribe (I did read the article about the Hadza) or in most society pre industrial revolution, mates were chosen by necessity, be it in societies where arranged marriages occur or tribes (marry the most ""important"" man, the best hunter and whatever other factors come into the equation).  Now in our post-industrial era, physical traits became much more important in mating partners choice. I disagree with your point that they chose tall heroes and short villains MAKING tall attractive and short the opposite. (I realize Im simplifying your point, but we could take that example to medias in general)  They most likely chose tall AND handsome heroes and short AND ugly villains because those factors were percieved as attractive/unattractive.  That's the problem with the studies you're linking. They try to adress height as an isolated factor but don't talk about how handsome/ugly the married people are.  While not denying its validity, I think one could argue that the conclusions drawn don't take this into consideration.  tl;dr because my message is probably awfully written : height not mattering in pre-industrial revolution societies might be due to overall ""looks"" not mattering that much in marriage choices as opposed to today.  I am not trying to say your cause is wrong. Just that life is unfair. Being ugly is a problem, being short as a guy is one too. Not sure we could blame that on western society."
short,3duu8d,irbananaking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"The problem with ""ugly"" is that it's such a subjective perspective.There have been many times where I considered someone attractive while my friends did not and vice-versa.Many people find ""ugly"" as something different.Height is a specific number for which there is a clear judgment.  I personally think society is the factor that perpetuates the idea that shorter = inferior.There is nothing bad with being short,just the preconcieved notions about it, and the aspects that people associate it with.  To completely answer to your comment.I wouldn't be able to date someone who doesn't find me attractive and sees my height as a flaw.I want them to accept the way I look and NOT just ""overlook"" it.Overlooking it means that they are still aware of my height as a flaw and it will create insecurity in the relationship."

Again my belief that a lot of what is termed feminism today is not really about equality (which I fully support) but about having your cake and eating it too (""oh yea I want equality at work but I want a 6ft man so I can feel small when I get home"").  Also liked that anecdote about the 5ft4 guy (""once they find out my height they don't want to know"").  So its not just all ""in my head"".   I also liked how the author was so shocked that her ""liberal"" girlfriends had some strong height preferences. Many of the girls I've met are ""liberal"" in their general politics but are quite narrow minded in real life. The higher up the educational ladder I go, the more ""liberal"" women I meet but they all want a 6ft2 neurosurgeon with a chiseled jaw (maybe I'm also at the age, 23, where a lot of folks are holding out for Mr./Mrs. Perfect)"

However, black people are considered minorities, and fighting racism against black people is considerably more ""popular"" than fighting heightism. Most women probably wouldn't give a shit what happens to short men, and wouldn't bother fighting against it, because they would see those men as being completely undesirable and expendable(this article is, if anything a rare exception that will most likely fall on deaf ears). Heightism also tends to affect Caucasian and Asian men predominantly, who aren't considered minorities, so they wouldn't exactly get the same kind of attention for defending those men as opposed to black men."

According to all metrics I was obese even though I was barely eating and walking everywhere at the time. Even medical professionals are going to give you the equivalent of a shoulder shrug.   So here's what you do:   Look for fat to gauge if your weight is healthy. I ballooned up past 200 at 21 and now I'm unambiguously fat at 250, but I can see the fat. That said as a naturally bigger guy some fat is probably inevitable unless you starve yourself-- remember back when I was 18 and 180 I was as close to starving myself as I could get. 200 is a much more comfortable natural weight for me.  Work out. Do cardiovascular exercise for your heart and do some lifting. You should have a natural reserve of muscle just waiting to develop. Take advantage of that. Just avoid high impact cardio. We are not built for distance running unless we want our knees to be shot by the time we're 40. Biking, rowing, swimming, and hiking are my go-to cardio.  Look at metrics beyond fat to gauge your actual health. What's your blood pressure? Cholesterol? B12 levels? Etc etc etc. If those are indeed adequate then keep on rocking. I'm in ok shape, could be better, but most of that is tied to the aforementioned fat.  Learn to ignore the fuck out of the media. Leading men, hearthrobs, and most porn stars are skinny as hell. You likely do not look like them. That is ok. Women will still find you sexy if you can own what you are and not get too jealous over what you are not. Watch videos of confident bigger guys (fat or stocky) to get a sense of how you might look.    Good luck."

Men often react the same way to women they find unattractive who express interest in them, especially when those women are fat. Short men and fat women get treated pretty similarly in this respect, so it's not like women don't have to deal with this, too.   You often hear women complain about how guys have it so much easier, because they are so painfully unaware or ignorant of the way women deal with men in general.

Hey, I'm [some bro] nice to meet ya    hey, nice to meet ya    wow I feel so tall standing next  to you, how tall are you flexes     Four foot eight I think. So how do you know [mutual friend], you go to school with her or something?     Yeah I me- wait what? No way. I'm at least a foot taller than you and -    Relax dude, I don't care about your height. You were saying you met her...where?    If they make a fuss about it I just play dumb and play up the fact that it's a silly thing to make a big deal about.   These things almost always happen in front of an audience, so it's all about hamming it up.

Onstage though, these guys may as well be 20 feet tall.  I think the biggest perk to being short at metal shows, especially in Sweden/Europe, is that I feel like everyone is enormous.

Girls have made fun of my height but I turn it into a positive by making fun of the situation at hand or by framing it into a positive.  Girl: ""Lol you're short!""  Me: ""That's right baby. And you love it ;)""  This is directly contradictory as to what they're expecting and more often than not creates attraction. I've seen it happen to me and other short men I know that do this. How many people here have seen girls turn guys down and a few days ""sometimes even moments"" later they're all over that same guy? The people that downvoted me aren't aware of this social dynamic. Make a woman feel how you want them to feel by emanating the energy you want them to feel.  Example: When girls listen to rap in the club that talks about how they're gonna be used like pieces of meat, they still dance to it and shout out the lyrics. Why? It's because of the energy of the song. The vibe that it creates makes them want to dance. Be like the rap song. Create that positive vibe that girls love."

They did redesign the search and filters though and took away a lot of the other useful filters and options.  For example, one way to filter out many of the fake and spam profiles was to do a search for people who answered at least X number of questions (even if it was only 10).    That would filter out the spam and fake profiles usually.   That option is gone.  Keyword search is gone (which was very handy to have).   The option to search by people who joined recently is gone (also fairly handy so you see new people not people you've already contacted and been ignored by).      A few other options and filters are gone as well.     But anyway, the Body Type filter (for paid users) and Height filter (for all users) are still there.   The new design is absolute garbage though and every time they make a change to the site they take away more options and functionality from users.   Users are not very pleased."

short,3dl9bc,twelvis,2,Fri Jul 17 05:56:38 2015 UTC,"They replaced it with a search for ""Interests"".  I ran some tests last night though the new ""interest"" search is not very good compared to the old keyword search.   It seems to miss a LOT of people who mention interests but don't mention them in the right section or who knows what causes it to miss them...  It's not very good though in my opinion.  I don't think it's an ""A-List"" feature though, so you could reactivate your account for free and give it a try to see if it seems awful to you too.  I sent an email to OKCupid about the missing keyword search and letting them know it was a very useful tool to have.  They responded a few minutes ago.  Their response was:   We are making some changes to keyword searching -- but I will certainly pass along to the developers that you miss it!   So it sounds like the keyword search might be back.   I hope they put it back anyway.   Same goes with some of the other filters and functionality they took away during this redesign.    They also changed how the searches are done in terms of how the URL looks after you set the filters.    So no more bookmarking your searches on your local machine or modifying  parts of the filter in the URL to have it be more customized to what you are looking for.    They seemed to remove quite a lot to make it look prettier this time through.   Here is what was removed from the filters that I've noticed so far:   Keyword search Number of Questions Answered Filter (Used to be an A-List perk that was useful in filtering out spam accounts and fake accounts) Join Date (So you could see new users only instead of the same matches who already ignored you) Diet Type Astrological Sign Job Income Pets (Whether the person has, likes, or dislikes cats or dogs)   That's all I've noticed so far missing from the filters, but there may be more that got removed or changed.   I used the Keyword search, the number of questions answered filter & join date quite often.  I used the pets one occasionally too."

A person can still choose ""Used up"" as their body type in their profile.     However, since it doesn't appear in the ""body type"" filter, they will be filtered out of the search results if someone uses the body type filter at all, even if the other person would have normally included ""Used up"" in their filter.

That is, short men are paid about $800 to $1000 less, per year, PER INCH than taller men who do the same job when they're working in a company.  But, when short men start their own business, they do as well as tall men who start their own business (on average).  The study said that this is because of employer discrimination against shorter workers.    Therefore, it stands to reason that employers have less liberty to discrimination against workers based on their height when the job is high skilled.  If the job is low skilled, then the position can be filled more easily and so employers are free to simply pick the tallest equally skilled male for the job."

I am happy and feel very fortunate for my success, but it wasn't until I became successful that I began to notice that people treated me differently for my height.  I very frequently attend business conferences where I meet people who are familiar with my work, but not me. Very often, multiple times a day, people tell me I'm much shorter than they thought I'd be, often before even introducing themselves or saying hello. It is the first thing that comes out of peoples' mouths. My height is not a problem for me, it's not something that bothers me or I'd ever thought about before this, but there is a very clear undertone of disappointment and disrespect in the observation; my body does not live up to the image of success that I've accumulated for myself.  This idea, that success is reserved for certain bodies, manifests itself in other ways too. I started the business with two tall guys, one of whom is exceptionally tall, and I achieved my initial success before I met him. He's a very good friend of mine and I respect him greatly - I wouldn't have formed a business with him if I didn't - but very often when we meet people for the first time, they immediately assume he is me. It makes both of us uncomfortable that people associate and attribute my success before we were partners with him. If we're at an event where we haven't been introduced, people assume that he is the boss and I'm, I don't know, an intern or something. It's insane and we've both noticed it.  So yeah, I wasn't aware of height bias until it manifested itself in my career. It's really the reason I'm here.

I think you have a healthy attitude, and I wouldn't call it ""low standards"". You just sound like a guy who greatly values personality and has the ability to find beauty where most sheeple cannot, and I respect you for that.  People like to call the height standards a preference.. but I don't think that's an accurate description. A preference is something you prefer, if all things are equal. For example, I have a preference for vanilla ice cream... but I'll happily eat chocolate anytime. I have a preference for blondes, but I will date a brunette or redhead without even thinking twice about it. When a woman says she will NOT date a man below 5'10, she is setting a requirement, not a preference. She won't even consider a man below that standard, unlike how I would consider chocolate ice cream and brunettes. Completely different things. Now I agree, there is nothing wrong with having preferences. But I think having REQUIREMENTS is a little ridiculous, especially for an arbitrary thing like bone length. I believe people who have unyielding height requirements foolishly miss out on some potentially amazing connections and relationships. To not even consider someone below a certain height is shooting yourself in the foot when searching for a compatible partner. Doesn't affect me, because I don't have a height requirement, but I almost feel bad for the people who do limit themselves in that way, and cause themselves to miss out on something that could have been special."

I feel as if most everyone is shallow in one way or another; we all have things that turn us on and turn us off. Now, it is naive to assume that these preferences aren't at least partly forged by culture. More American men would want to date black women if black femininity weren't seen as less feminine than white femininity, for example.   So, cultural prejudice influences what we find attractive, but not being attracted to certain kinds of people isn't prejudice in and of itself because no one is entitled to someone else's love, affection, or lust.   Now, I think you can judge people when they present their dating preferences in mean-spirited ways, absolutely! It hurts my feelings a little bit too when I read an online dating profile of a woman who says something like ""you must be x tall to ride this ride"" and of course it's always taller than me, or when I see an article headline like this from an outlet that should absolutely know better than to make a group of people feel bad about themselves for something they have no control over [note the article itself isn't that bad, but the title is].  People should face derision for being jerks, but at the end of the day, I'm not going to let a jerk make me feel too bad about myself.    People like to say that being a short guy is fine because you don't even have to deal with superficial girls. But I see it that I am missing out on chances with potentially great women who have just been a little bit mislead.   Well, sadly there are a lot of great women who are going to have height requirements, and they're not necessarily misled. They might know exactly what they want when they refuse to date short men...and that doesn't make them bad people, either!   On the bright side, there are also a lot of great women who are happy to date short men, and many of those women at one point in time probably said they'd never date a guy under a certain height. I've dated my fair share of women of all heights, and I will continue to do so until something finally works out long-term, and being short won't stop you from doing that, too."

It was evolutionary advantageous to ""become a man"" before your rivals. Short men get a large spike in testosterone before other boys.  This hormone in large amounts tells the body (1) grow the penis so that it can penetrate, (2) increase muscle density, and (3) seal the growth plates to divert future food energy from height to objectives (1) and (2)."

short,3dd63o,GeoffreyArnold,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:23:14 2015 UTC,"I've thought about the last bit there a lot as someone who enjoys working out and has a lot of shorter friends.  Short men don't put on muscle at a more rapid rate, but they do become proportionally larger at a much faster rate. Muscle growth rates are roughly the same for all men (with testosterone differences causing minor variances). However, at my height to be large I'd need to be 250lbs + . Take The Mountain from Game of Thrones as an example. He's an inch taller than I am and about 400lbs. The average person a foot shorter than me can look as big as I would at 250 when he's 180. A 10lbs weight gain on both people is therefore far more noticeable on the shorter man as proportionally it's much more substantial. This also isn't taking into account protein and caloric requirements to reach those weights, which again is much more substantial as you get heavier.  Tbh I feel like a lot of the ""manlet"" hate probably came from taller guys getting annoyed they gain more slowly when it comes to appearance. I think it's similar to your growth theory you posted earlier where shorter guys can peak more quickly than their taller counterparts. I'd argue the ceiling is higher for taller men, just check out some strongman competitions, as they can put on more total muscle.  With that being said, I think most short guys within a year of focused lifting can look really damn good. So, why aren't you guys out at the gym?? It makes you look fantastic and builds confidence.

I came to my conclusions through feminism   I too developed my understanding about heightism from feminism.  But, though it's still true that heightism is best explained as a function of gender norms, I've soured on explaining heightism in terms of feminism because most of what I read from feminist is really ""anti-male"" and not aimed at TRULY destroying the Patriarchy.  They tend to only want to destroy the aspects of Patriarchy that negatively affect women, but keep the aspects which benefit women.  I know it's not that simple and not all feminist think like that...but still, I've read enough to sour on the whole concept.    However, simple philosophical ideas can pretty much counter any evo-psychology or bio-truths arguments anyone can come up with.  Simply point out that one cannot convert an ""is"" into an ""ought"" (this concept comes from Kant).  That is, when we are talking about social stigma like heightism or racism or sexism, we are talking about morality (right and wrong).  There is no biological fact that can inform us about what is right or wrong.  That is, racism would be wrong even if science one day proved that certain races were smarter than others.  Rape would still be wrong if one day science proved that rape was an evolved trait among males.  Sexism would still be wrong even if science proved that women did not lead men in our evolutionary past."

That doesn't mean they are any more responsible for maintaining gender norms than men. Men also expect women to adhere to gender norms in dating. For example, how many men like to date a larger women (think height and weight)? And gender norms exist well beyond dating. Shortness being coded feminine negatively effects short men in ways that exist beyond the realm of dating. It makes people see short men as less capable leaders, for example. If women just suddenly became attracted to short men despite shortness being seen as less masculine the perception of short men as less capable than tall men wouldn't change. Gender norms are not solely driven by women's dating preferences. They aren't driven by dating preferences at all; it's the gender norms that drive the dating preferences.

It reminded me of a story Napoleon Hill mentioned about talking to a Chinese student. When he asked the Chinese lad what most stood out as different about Americans to his own countrymen, he smiled, & said, ""well...your eyes"".  Height seems to be more of a universal thing though (in western society at least). I think most of the reason for that is because its not seen as a desirable trait by women - hence why dating is such a big deal on this board.  In modern society, women are increasingly allowed to openly state what constitutes ""a real man"". They've even got plenty of men to play along like nodding dogs. Society preaches about how you've  gotta make women happY & if tall, dark, & handsome is what they want, then anyone who doesnt meet that criteria will become increasingly marginalized. Funnily enough, becoming more marginalized is actually the only thing that might raise awareness because right now heightism isnt bad enough to warrant serious attention IMO.

What we need is more education for the public on this issue.  Heightism is worse than a lot of other forms of stigma which already gets ""serious attention"".  Here you even said ""Height seems to be more of a universal thing though"".  You can't say that heightism is more ""universal"" but at the same time suggest that heightism isn't ready for public criticism.    Plus, heightism can be framed as an institutional form of oppression, similar to racism, sexism, etc.  But we need examples for the critics who claim that heightism is a private prejudice instead of a systemic one.  So, by ""institutional"" or ""systemic"" I am talking about examples of discrimination or disparate treatment carried out by organized groups (governments, companies, government entities, clubs, Universities, media outlets, etc.)   Here are a few I came up with earlier, but I'm sure we can come up with a fuller list.     [Government] Only 1 out of 50 states guarantees equal rights to short people in terms of employment and government contracts (Michigan). [University System] Up until the 1960s Ivy League Schools had policies excluding short men from admission (Gladwell talks about this at Harvard and Yale when they started an in person interview process to weed out short men - you even had to list your height on the old applications). [corporate/industry] Most U.S. sperm banks will not accept donations from men who are shorter than 5'8"" because they know the sperm will not be marketable - regardless of the donor's other qualifications.   [Government] As of 2000, the United States Government (through the FDA) has designated healthy male children who are projected to have an adult height shorter than 5'3"" to be diseased and a candidate for treatment, even if they are producing healthy and normal growth hormone. The reason for this is that the government determine that the child's adult quality of life will be so low that it should be a disease unto itself.

They'd both look pretty much the same to me.  Plus, at that height, they're usually just objects in my peripheral vision.  It would take too much effort to interact with them, unless there was something important I needed to say or hear.    I tend to judge shortness by my own height.  I notice a guy is short when he is as short as me or shorter.  I don't really think of guys who are taller than me as short...unless I hear someone call them short in a pejorative way.  That sucks...when someone makes a height slur against another guy who is actually taller than you.    It also varies with gender.  I don't think of a girl who is only a little shorter than me as ""short"" even though a lot of other people would.  But, I'll consider a girl who is 5'8"" as ""very tall"".

Also, I spent most of my adolescence in the football-loving Southwestern US, where guys simply didn't play certain sports such as soccer and volleyball (most schools in my area only had women's teams) or were ridiculed endlessly for doing so (namely being labelled a fag). Of course this is stupid (and sexist), but when you're a kid, you take that stuff seriously.  I don't know what changed in my mid 20s, but I started to try new sports or sports I'd been interested in. The overwhelming majority of people I've come across in rec are not only accommodating to noobs, they've actively helped me be better."

Kevin Durant is listed as 6'9"" but in reality is 6'11"", pushing 7'. He doesn't want to be ""seen"" as a near 7-ft guy, though. You can see in this pic he is considerably taller than the certified 6'8"" LeBron James. Bill Walton also had himself listed at 6-11 to not appear as a 7'-er, but you can see he is as tall as Kareem Abdul Jabbar in pictures.  Generally though, the trend is height inflation across the board. 5'10"" Chris Paul and JJ Barea are listed at 6'. 5'8"" Isaiah Thomas is listed at 5'9"" or 5'10"".

The roster lists him at 6'9"" though.    Durant is one of the few that lists his actual height.  That's pretty neat!  James was 6'7.25"" without shoes and 6'8 with shoes.  Roster lists him as 6'8"".    So he only slightly bumped his height up I guess.  Then you have Dwight Howard who was 6'9"" without shoes (same as Durant), 6'10"" in shoes, but is listed at 6'11"" :P  It's definitely more common for a player to be taller on the roster than they actually are though.   Especially at the ""big"" positions (4 and 5) where height is even more valued.    There probably are some though others like Durant that list their actual height though.  This article talks about players who are listed much taller than they actually are.  Even mentions how Durant is telling the truth unlike most others.  From the article:  Kevin Love - 6'7.75"",  Listed at 6'10""  Spencer Hawes - 6'10.4"",  Listed at 7'1""  Thaddeus Young - 6'5.75"",  Listed at 6'8""  It seems silly since it's not only so common that damn near everyone is doing it, but also silly considering that any front office thinking about trading for a player is going to have access to their pre-draft height measurement and isn't going to believe the roster height.

So he belongs in /r/average[1] not /r/short[2]    Anyone who follows basketball knows the roster height is almost always wrong and gives a player an extra inch or two.    Same goes for college basketball.     He said in the video he's 5'7"".    Also, before the NBA draft they are measured without shoes and with shoes.    He measured 5'7"" and some change if I remember right without shoes.      As for being a borderline all-star, actually he should have been on the ballot for the 2008-2009 season.     He deserved to be on there more than quite a few players who were on the ballot (some who hadn't even played a game yet that season).    There were a few articles that mentioned or talked about that (bleacher report had one I know).  He certainly wasn't just a ""borderline NBA player"" either like you said earlier.    Chicago fans, Denver fans and NY Knick fans would disagree with you there.  He was very valuable as a 6th man off the bench for some instant offense and had the potential at times to take over games.  As for defense?  Seriously?   Do you think anyone cares about defense in the NBA all star games?  The last two all star games ended up with scores of  163 to 158  and 163 to 155.  Some of the biggest stars in the NBA right now do not play defense.   James Harden for example (though he improved a lot this season) used to frequently gets lost or just watch on defense.    Personally I wish defense was more valued in the NBA but...offense is what gets the big paychecks and what fans want."

An no one cares about defense during the all star game.... but players who don't/can't play any defense during the regular season are not all stars.  They are liabilities when it comes to.. ya know... actually winning games.  But let's take a statistical look at things.  Robinsons lifetime PER rating is 10.6.  A rating of 11 is well below average and is considered ""scrounging for minutes"" and Nate is below that.  PER also skews heavily towards offense so his rating would even be lower if not for that bias.  So that makes him a borderline NBA player at best."

NBA All Star voting is a fucking joke.   Yes, it is a joke, that's what I'm saying...  Robinson deserved to be on the ballot a hell of a lot more than some of the players who were on that ballot.   Like you say, sometimes people are top vote getters or on the ballot when they haven't even played!   I honestly hate the NBA All Star game, voting for it and all that.

You might not think they are all stars but ya know... they still end up as all stars even without being able to play defense.   Like James Harden, who while he improved his defense a lot this year still was pretty bad at it.  Not nearly as bad as he had been the previous several years though.  I'm not arguing that Robinson was a great defender too.  He was a very good 6th man though for some instant offense off the bench though.   The year he averaged 17 points a game he was a borderline all star.      Robinsons lifetime PER rating is 10.6.   Nope.  That's not his lifetime PER rating at all.  That was last years PER rating.  You're reading ESPN's site wrong :)    Robinson didn't have a good year last year, I'll give you that.  He was on a Nuggets team that was falling apart under a coach that had lost his players.  His shooting was awful, everything was awful for the Nuggets last year.  Here are Robinson's PER ratings over the years:   2005-2006:  12.67 2006-2007:  15.28 2007-2008:  15.70 2008-2009:  18.95  (Ahead of Billups, Rondo, Kidd, Westbrook, etc etc.  Just behind Nash.) 2009-2010:  16.41  (Ahead of Curry, just one behind Tony Parker) 2010-2011:  10.07  (Rough year... switched teams BOS & OKC) 2011-2012:  18.05  (Ahead of John Wall, Rajon Rondo, just behind Brandon Jennings & Kyle Lowry) 2012-2013:  17.43  (Ahead of Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, just behind Kyle Lowry) 2013-2014:  15.64 2014-2015:  10.60  (Rough year on a Nuggets team that was falling apart)    If you're going to quote stats, at least try to be reading ESPN's site correctly man.    Like I said, 10.60 was last year's PER rating, not his lifetime PER rating.   Last year yes he was a borderline NBA player.  His career though?   Not borderline at all.   He was a very valuable 6th man.     EDIT:  Looked up his lifetime PER.  It was 15.6, which is very respectable.    Lots of good players around that rating."
short,3d6iwc,Bubuloo,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:11:22 2015 UTC,I obviously thought 10.6 was his career stat.  So at 15.6 he's slightly above average when the measurement is heavily skewed towards offense.

But I want to suggest that perhaps part of the reason you don't quite understand why a lot of short people don't like being short is because you're a woman. Because of gender norms, women experience shortness in a much more positive way than men do. Your femininity isn't challenged by being short, rather, it is affirmed. The opposite is the case for men with respect to their masculinity. So, just try to keep that in mind!  Despite all that, I still don't think it's bad to be a short guy.

short,3d760o,Punk_Trek,2,Tue Jul 14 01:54:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip and correction. I'll remember that. And I guess I vent at times myself. I just always thought it was a joke for me (Just because I don't mind being short) But I do get it.

And just all the dominance/authority/alpha male BS that comes with being a guy.  I think the sexual appeal thing is far less important for women."
short,3d760o,Punk_Trek,4,Tue Jul 14 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"I don't find it horrible per se? I do find certain things frustrating and that adds up. It's like a death of a thousand cuts.   I get tired of not being taken seriously, because people equate short with 'young'. And young women aren't taken seriously at all. I work as a producer and it's exhausting having to take the time to prove my credentials over and over and over. In fact, I'm delighted that my hair is turning grey (no wrinkles yet, I'm looking forward to them though). It means that as I age, my word carries more weight and I'm more effectual at my job.  I get frustrated at only being able to reach 50% of my kitchen cupboards - not often but sometimes a tall person is around and they literally go over my head and that shits me. I was once asked to put decorations up at a shitty retail job. There was no way I could reach the ceiling safely on the shitty step ladder we had. So I was fired for slacking off.   I used to get picked up off my feet. I've been picked up off seats and physically moved in public spaces. I've had drunk assholes at bars pick me up to 'pretend' to carry me outside. That used to terrify me - it hasn't happened in many years, thank god I got old.   I get frustrated at pats on the head and an increase in diminutive language to pertain to me. I get tempted towards violence for the condescension.   I am not capable of 'just being happy'. These things impact my life and the way in which I decide to live it. I'm very good at my job, and I value my personal space. Being short has meant I've had to work just that much harder at keeping both of those things. I'm not going to pretend it's not shitty.   That said, I do enjoy advantages being a short female and when the guys here say it's worse for guys. The best thing we can do is listen, believe them when they describe how being short has impacted their lives and how it's made them feel."
short,3d760o,Punk_Trek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:26:42 2015 UTC,"I understand the whole being short and being young thing. It helps when I get my hair cut short because for some reason people seem to think I look a LITTLE older. I go form 15 to 17 which kind of drives me crazy. People constantly touch my head. I can't reach anything. And, even when I'm mad, I am forever labeled as cute. So, I get that, but I enjoy being short too. There are a few things to over come, but tall people have their own problems to over come. I understand the men have it so much harder, but I love hearing how they cope and that many of them like the body their in. They shouldn't have any shame or be upset. If they're a great guy, in my book, that's all that SHOULD matter."

Not being taken seriously in professional settings,  looking young, being picked up. It's interesting hearing an older woman with your perspective. Today a tall man can whisk away a young woman quite easily. It's actually quite attractive. I've been branded a misogynist for saying things like that, but it's true. I've seen tall men be simultaneously fat, stupid and failing college, drug addicted, poor, ugly and generally a total dickhead and still have women flocking to them. Back to the point though, for you, people getting in your space sucks and feels pretty invasive. I said I've been picked up but... for short women it's extremely common.  Thanks for your contribution here. I've noticed there has been a gradual increase of exposure of /r/short and heightism awareness. Along with a predictable increase in trolling, a welcomed increase in empathetic and understanding women and tall men."

The idea that women's bodies exist for the male gaze, feeds into the issues around catcalling and what not. Those kids of issues are amplified and compounded by being a small size.   But I digress, it's a tangental issue.   I keep trying to remember that you guys get heaps of trolls. And that you've had to fight to even get these issues acknowledged. And that it's going to take a little bit before you see me as one of you in the short community and as an ally in the quest to enlighten women.

Nobody points it out, but you swear you're hauling around a big load of shit that people smell and it causes people to think of you different. Every now and then though, a good friend admits to you that girls would probably like you better if you didn't smell like shit. That's when you finally reach around to find a handful of poo.

The first half of the article just screams of this mentality: ""No you guys! I swear I'm not racist."" However, most people who aren't racist don't feel the need to write 6 paragraphs explaining why they're not racist/prejudice/self-hater/ashamed of their culture(or aspects of it).  At the end of the day, in whatever spin she tries to put on it, it's quite evident that she believes being Asian (or inheriting Asian features) is somewhat a curse or a burden that she doesn't wish on her children.  Well I just want to say that, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING ASIAN/LOOKING ASIAN/BEING SHORT.  This article hits me in a particularly raw place seeing as I'm the product of what she is talking about. My mother and father are both Filipino however, my biological grandfather is Sicilian. Obviously I look more Asian than Sicilian/Southern European, which is I why I normally favour just saying I'm Asian instead of anything else.   Sure, growing up with ambiguous features that are hard to categorise is difficult, especially as an adolescent through to young adulthood (which I currently am in right now), and having to navigate the messy waters of social interaction and dating whilst being a short ambiguously Asian male is definitely trying at times - depending on what you are trying to achieve in terms of life aspirations - however, it is in no way a curse or a disadvantage. Those terms are things people say to themselves as excuses, or worse, to others in order to make them/themselves feel inferior in comparison. If others feel that it is a curse, burden or disadvantage then, obviously those are people you wouldn't even want to associate with. Simple.  It has taken me a very long time to understand that fact, and I'm still working on strengthening those affirmations almost on a daily basis, because as a human, I'm prone to lapses of weakness, where if I don't watch out I can easily get stuck in the mindset of inferiority.   We are all different, it what makes life interesting; there will always be people who will continue to categorise/segregate/belittle/insult others who are not the same as them (to whatever degree), but to perpetuate these people and their beliefs is just WRONG - and this is exactly what the author of the article does."

In Central America, if you are light skinner (regardless of actual ancestry), you are considered white. Height is seen as a European trait and yes, seen as ""white"", will get you jobs, Visas to leave the country, money, respect, etc. To act like it's not seen as a white factor is ridiculous.

They are seen as a higher caste because the lower classes would work in the sun and be more tanned. Though genetic tests have shown that there are significant differences between the Indian castes.  It doesn't sound like white supremacy to me, but preference of white skin. They are two very different things. A Asian (say a Japanese person) with pale white skin is less white than North Africans and many middle east inhabitants who are genetically caucasian."
short,3d81vo,Wheynweed,0,Wed Jul 15 03:06:05 2015 UTC,"I would say yes that it is white supremacy considering that the indigenous populations in Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador were literally wiped out via genocide for being overall inferior to Europeans and mixed race Latinos. People in those countries actually discourage mixing with darker people for fear that they carry ""indian genes"" of height, dark straight hair, and dark skin. Guatemala is the only country in Central America right now that has a sizable Indigenous population because the government failed to wipe them out during a genocide campaign during the civil war (1960-1996)."

However the vast majority of the victims were Maya, dictator Rios Montt particularly ordered his soldiers to burn down every single indigenous village they came across. But to act like European and mixed race Latinos didn't relish in the genocide would be ignorant. Indigenous women in particular were victims because they were seen as the bearers of communist, degenerate Indians. Many Indians were forced to hide their ancestry and escape the country to avoid being murdered. The genocide campaign was designed to murder communists and Indians which for a lot of people in Guatemala and Central America (even today) they are seen as one and the same.  edited to snip personal info"

My main point is in the scheme of things, heightism is not a racial issue worldwide. Height is linked to racial issues in Guatemala cleary, but it certainly isn't in most countries.   In Guatelama it seems to be more about traits that would point you out as white right? Light hair, skin and eyes?   I think applying heightism to race in the west is silly. It is much more about gender norms which is why shorter men have a much harder time in the WEST with Heightism."

I do agree that in the west outside of minority enclaves but I haven't really fleshed out my views on whether I consider it more to do with gender norms either.  And yes, traits seen as white, regardless if you are ACTUALLY white, is what matters. For example, I know lots of dudes born to the darkest, shortest people I know, but because of some fluke genetics, they were born with lighter skin and about 5'8'' (which is very tall for us lol!) and are praised as white men."

short,3d81vo,Wheynweed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:51:48 2015 UTC,"That's more to do with the traits whites posses more than them being white.  White males are usually taller and have wider shoulders than Asian men. Both considered ""masculine"" traits. It's not that they want their children to be ""white"" they want them to be tall LIKE white people generally seem to be. 95th percentile shoulder width in Hong Kong is 50th percentile in the USA.  The attractive part is subjective. But if we're honest here Europeans have a very distinct appearence. Hair that's straight or curly, black, blonde or red and such. The eye colour is a novelty as well.   You also have the mindset that the higher classes in Asia didn't work out in the sun so they were less tanned than the lower classes.

Also, the person who's more pissed off has an advantage, he'll be more aggressive and willing to go the extra mile to win. Fighting experience, the more experienced fighter will likely remain more disciplined and think out his defense/attack. The element of surprise also helps, but only when the fight starts.   But another large factor, especially if the two men are untrained, is just plain luck. Sometimes all it takes is that one lucky hit - the jaw, chin, nose, the temple, the throat.

short,3czzet,Pigeon_Stomping,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:03:24 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Reach can play a big factor in a knife fight for instance.   Not really. Not unless you're trying to make a hundred little cuts over a long period, which normally a knife attack isn't about, it's about a somewhat hidden weapon which comes from a really low/direct angle and is used to incapacitate a victim before he/she has even seen the weapon.  Very few people are going to extend their arm while stabbing (and no one does the 'shower killer stab' from above), it's usually a very quick motion with a springy in/out action, sometimes even with a grab with the free hand.  Knife training is always a very, very eye-opening experience, it's not about two idiots waving their rambo knives at each other in a reversed hold, making swooshy moves at one another, it's about someone coming up to you for a light, and planting a kitchen knife right under your ribs."
short,3czzet,GrandBuba,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:51:03 2015 UTC,"Oh I know. You don't show and try to ward off your attacker with a weapon. If it's to the point of weapons being drawn speed, and element of surprise during critical seconds of escalation are going to win out. And it's kill. Me, I am prone to weapons use because I am not going to take any risks of being critically injured trying to sustain or thwart an attacker. The first rule of knife fighting, if it's between two knives, or someone is using a knife is accept you're going to cut. And most untrained people will baulk at the idea, or sight. The second is if you can't kill em bleed em. As long as an opponent can keep from being pinned down by their advisary, enough cuts and you'll weaken the aggressor. So I'll take tiny cuts over not being pinned down. Again, it's about wearing the other person down. Though in most fights, I grant you, it's two maybe three moves before the better fighter wins out when it's a deadly escalation. So pulling a knife is more a finishing move. I'm just thinking of scenarios where that element of close range surprise isn't in play and it becomes more defensive to keep a larger advisary off you. In that case I'll do what I can to gain time, and space. Even though I might have the advantage of reach, I damn sure as shit know if I step in range of someone with superior strength than me I'm not likely to walk out of that if they manage to get their hands on me."

I am not a big woman, I am tall and athletic, strong and self assured as I am I know I can't take most dudes in a fair fight. There is a level of intimidation about dudes just being bigger than me I've never fully been able to shake, and it's always there. I think other women have a similar view. I've read a lot of my shorter sisters on here constantly griping about how men feel entitled to just picking them up, and tossing them around, like it were nothing. I can't imagine that constant assault on my personal space. It's part of the reason why I've developed a bitchy, caustic, aggressive personality is fending off just that sheer invasion of personal space.   Part of the appeal of dating my current boyfriend is that I don't feel threatened by him, just on sheer size, being about three inches shorter than me. He can't pick me up and throw me around. I mean he could, but my having 10-20 lbs on him, makes it difficult without my cooperation. He doesn't hang on me. It's awkward. He's lived in a world his whole life where throwing the subconscious physical signals of intimidation does not work for him. The drop in voice, the adjustment of stance, the dropped chin loom, etc. It doesn't work for him, and would've gotten him in more physical altercations than he'd have liked. As a result he's gotten very good at speaking, persuasion to get what he wants, or to avoid unnecessary fighting. So yah, I don't feel threatened, ever, by him physically just being there, or angry, or whatever. I also feel very safe with him, because and we've been out, and drunk guys getting rowdy and want to hit on me, or make trouble he's been very quick to de-escalate the situation. Not saying it happens a lot, but over 3 years... there is always going to be a couple of assholes. I don't think that would've happened as much, and there would've probably been a fight a couple of times had he just been bigger. I have a hell of lot more respect for that than a dumbass who goes all primate at the first drop of aggression. I feel safe because he is intelligent, articulate, and very good at redirecting idiots attentions away from us.   And I am not saying he is a whimp either. Dude has something like 15 years of martial arts training, sports studs on his jacket, and even for being of slighter build presents a very imposing figure outwardly. But he just doesn't rely on physical factors of sheer size, weight, and muscle which to me makes me feel safe with him. The threat of violence just isn't there.   So yah, it's a combination of things. But he has never had a problem making the women in his life feel safe, secure, and protected. Whether it is his girlfriends (met a few of his exs), coworkers, or friends a lot of women I have observed have felt safe, rely on him to walk them to their bus stop, or seek his help when dealing with someone else. He's a good man. You don't need physical size to make someone feel safe, in fact it can be a disadvantage because traditional men take it for grant it, get into stupid situations, and don't think how what little actions they take impact others. I think it's the lack of sheer conscious consideration that make bigger men purely uncomfortable to be around."

Think of it this way...  Your feet are designed to cushion the blow of walking or running through it's natural arch.   Fuck that up by putting your foot in an natural position and what takes the beating?   Your toes (due to weight being shifted forward), your ankles...knees...lower back.    Basically look up the dangers of wearing high heels too much and you can apply that same thing to wearing lifts too much.   I realize lifts might not be AS high as some high heels, but the same dangers are there, just to a slightly lesser extent.  Here's one article from the Spine Health Institute (Florida Hospital Medical Group) that focuses more on how it affects your back.   It talks a little about the effects on other areas too though (and how it relates to back problems).  There are several other articles out there that talk about how it affects your toes, feet, ankles and knees.    Do some google searches about the dangers of elevated heel shoes or even poor fitting shoes.  As one doctor put it in this article:   Your feet are, quite literally, your base of support. If your feet aren’t happy, nothing above them will be.  Take a closer look at your shoe selection and take small steps now to prevent big foot problems later."
short,3d2gy3,JohnGM,2,Mon Jul 13 01:54:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your research. I'll contact a real bone doctor with this in mind and ask him for his opinion too. As of yet I work out 2 hours a day with regular shoes. But whenever I have to go to my internship I wear my lifts 100 percent/ whenever I hang out with friends( 5 hrs a day maybe). A lot of it is sitting down( when I work I sit down, when I'm with my friends I walk a bit and sit down at a restaurant/ movie, whatever.) Also see my edit(I customized the lifts for maximum comfort and chose the material myself), so unlike women who have hard soles for high heels, mine feel like standing on a semi-hard pillow or like I said, foam. Do you think it would minimize back pain? I weightlift alot so I usually notice muscular imbalances but last time I checked(last week) my doctor said everything is normal regarding my posture and spinal curvature."

That's why women don't wear heels 24/7.  They will damage your feet.  ESPECIALLY don't go jogging, biking, or walking on dirt or gravel roads in them.    I'm against shoe lifts generally....but if you're going to wear them, then at least be safe.  Just wear them to work.  The more you wear them, the higher your chances of permanently damaging to your feet."

Your problems are not due to height, you need mental help, even at 5'4"" I met quite a bit or have seen quite a bit of people my height or around my height and even shorter. Why are there so many damn threads of 5'8""-5'9"" people claiming to be short or have short related problems? Its really getting on my damn nerve. Exception being extremely tall countries ofcourse.

If you take a look at the fortune 500 companies, I believe a great majority are 6''+. I want to be a CEO someday and I like I said in the post, have an equal opportunity. The world really isn't fair, and me being a minority doesn't help in the business world. I'm doing everything I can(working out, studying alot, making connections, ""feigning height"") to get the best results I can.

Makes your own success story, working in an office with a ton of other people is not how people became successful, you need to start your own company and have your own ideas. maybe your taller friends are getting more attention because they have more confidence, loud, businessmen personalities.

That is sad that a 14 year old would kill himself because of this, he still had so much more time to grow, when I was a kid I always thought I would grow to be normal height, even tho I was always short growing up, becoming an adult just dissapointed me    You even demonstrate the idea that taller is better in the very comment in which you deny it.

This guy want to be tall, not taller, so that he can feel more powerful basically, these are two separate things and not the same logic. Wanting to be tall and wanting to be average height are two separate things, one you just want to be treated like a regular person, the other you want to be treated better and only want to feel superior to people."

One is a physical need and the other is just affected by stigma.  In order to fight the stigma, we must accept and embrace our height.  We have to reject the idea that taller is better than shorter.  You can't want to be taller and then say that it's okay to be short at the same time.  That's my point.  I think that you and OP are two heads of the same coin."
