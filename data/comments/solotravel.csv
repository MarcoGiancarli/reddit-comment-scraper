I have no experience of Peru but Ecuador is definitely okay.   Remember how many people travel South America, ""tourist murdered in ___"" is a headline that news organisations love and yet it's not one you hear really.

Just simply avoided the obviously lower soc-ec areas, and applied common sense. If something does happen and you've taken precautions, it's simply just poor luck. We did stupid things when we were over there (like go driving around Colca Canyon with two men we met the night before) and walked around dodgy areas at night with travelling South Americans from Chile etc. who made us feel comfortable going to more off-track areas.  You do stand out like a sore thumb, especially if you're like me who is 6'3"" and has almost anti-south american features. In Arequipa I spent a day wandering around by myself and ended up in a very, very local area and had lunch in this small cafe where it felt like everyone was just staring at me. So just try not to flash any sort of wealth or possession, stick to populated streets etc.   Peru also has a heavy police presence in most areas especially town plazas.

Texas Hill country is beautiful as well, especially in the spring and fall.  New Mexico has a mix of everything, from natural beauty to a mix of old fashioned and progressive. Carlsbad Caverns are a must see, as is the White Sands monument near Alamogordo. If you're into science at all, the Very Large Array is an astronomical observatory that's (mostly) open to the public, just off of US-60 outside of Socorro. Albuquerque is literally a mix of old and new, with Old Town (the original settlement), the Route 66 attractions, all wrapped into a modern city. Heading west to Arizona, the Petroglyph monument (on the far west side of ABQ) is worth stopping at, along with Gallup (another Route 66 town).  The first thing worth stopping at in Arizona will be the Petrified Forest National Park. Sedona is a really cool mountain oasis in northern Arizona, and the Grand Canyon is only an hour or so off the interstate. Kingman is another cute little Route 66 town before you get to....  Las Vegas! This one explains itself. Red Rock Canyon is close by if you want a break from partying/gambling/etc. I would say Area 51 as well, but you can't go there..."

Anyway, its filled with great and very, very nice people (I'm actually impressed) and if you would enjoy a ride to Montevideo its deff worth the stop.  -----If you are not interested in Colonia anymore, STOP reading here -----   You take a ferry from Puerto Madero. It takes an hour to get there. You can pretty much roam the whole town walking. Yes, it is that small. Or you could grab a bike, or a motor bike and do it way faster. I walked everything so I don't quite remember where you get rent the bikes (if there were any). ((My memory keeps playing games here)).  Anyhow, I really hope you have a great vacation.

It's a inisthmus off the Atlantic Rainforest. The weather is beautiful year round. It has some of the most virgen beaches as well. Amazingly picturesque beaches with some easy to arrive to along coastal views  and rainforest jungles with simple trails and bus arrival. There is also one huge lagoon and a smaller less huge one only a few meters deep where you can kite surf, paddle surf and plenty of other sports on super You can watch some of the best amateur sufring in the world as well. There is also a university in the city so there are plenty of young people to enjoy which birngs nightlife with great samba and night clubs with young and older crowds. Hostels aren't too expensive but you may be able to find a stuend room for a bit that would be really cheap for a month. The island offers day trips to cities where German settlers settled and see quite European German countryside styled architecture in rain forest like atmosphere. Florianopolis is one of the coolest cities in the Brasil without a doubt. It offers very little crime as well compared to places like Rio, Salvador, and Sao Paulo if your are looking to hit Brazil As a guy who hit South American three different times between the years of 19-23 years old, which was the last four years of my life, go here!

solotravel,3e3yc3,_______dd,5,Tue Jul 21 19:44:28 2015 UTC,"'do a deep clean of the house, cook for us every night at 7pm'   Woah, woah, WOAH.  Flag this guy down because that is not OK in the CS community.    Couchsurfing is about connecting with locals who share a love of travel and adventures.  It is not about getting free maid service.  Of course, there are common courtesy things, such as clean up after yourself - but you are not their fucking maid.    As for personal CSing experience - I was 22 when I moved to Taiwan by myself (I'm 28 now).  The first week I was there I couchsurfed.     My first host - the very first person I met in Taiwan - is still a very dear friend of mine. I consider her among my top closest relatioships. My second host was fifteen years older than me and made it very clear that I could ""share"" his bed instead of sleeping on the small couch.  At the time, it made me hugely uncomfortable.  If that happened today I'd just tell him that his behavior is making me uncomfortable and if he does it again, I will leave. My third host became my roommate - I lived with her for 8 months.   I found my next roommate through CS as well.  Also, the only time I've ever been in love was with someone I met through CS.    I've had some fantastic experiences with CS - but also some creepy ones.  It's just a tool, so you still have to use your judgement when deciding who do trust.    And whatever you do, as one solo female traveler to another, always trust your gut.  Even if rationally you shouldn't feel scared/uncomfortable, but you do - trust that.  We're socialized to rely on logic and rational - and they are important ways of thinking and have their places - but when you're traveling by yourself, with no one around to help you out - your gut is what you trust.    Also, have a backup plan.  Even if that means calling mom and dad in the middle of the night and asking them to book and pay for a hostel for you.  Don't get me wrong - couchsurfing is an amazing community.  And traveling by myself, all over the world for the past six years has helped me become someone I am very proud of - but it's quite easy for an ""uncomfortable"" situation to become a nightmare.  If you're curious, look up the woman who was raped in Leeds, England by her host.  It happened just a few months after I started traveling and the way her night began was almost exactly how my night with the 37 year old creep began.  The only difference was that my host respected my ""no"" while hers didn't.    Good luck!  And if you go through Taiwan on your travels, let me know and I'll put you in touch with some awesome folks!  EDIT:  Whoops.  Well that turned into a novel."

solotravel,3e3yc3,BearSauce,2,Wed Jul 22 02:50:45 2015 UTC,I have couchsurfed & hosted a few times. So far it has been a pretty fun experience. Kinda like arranging a friend to hangout & show you around when you get there.  Don't surf if they are going to take advantage of you like that. Thats some bullshit right there.   I usually have to spam a ton of people in advanced & that way I can narrow it down based on the type of vibe I get from messaging back & forth.

solotravel,3e3yc3,ChickenMcVincent,2,Wed Jul 22 02:51:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the cooking and cleaning thing is a red flag. As a host, I never expected anyone to do chores.  If they did, awesome, but openly requiring it is not cool and possibly against the TOS (though it's been awhile since I looked it up).  Besides that, I've hosted (in the US and Amsterdam) and surfed through Europe, Morocco and the US and loved it.  Still friends with a few of my surfers and hosts as well.  It's been a few years since I've been able to do either but still, I highly recommend the experience.  During the summer you are going to have to spam a mass amount of hosts to find someone, especially in Europe.  Have a quick message setup that you can copy paste but make sure to add at least one detail from their profile to show that you actually read it (and definitely read the profiles too, don't fake that).  Also, make sure your profile is filled out.  As a host, I would avoid any surfers with empty profiles.  Too risky for me and honestly, filling out the profile is not too hard.  I had the worst luck in Italy during August.  100+ messages sent out, only found 2 hosts in 2 of the 5 cities I went to so I had to supplement with campsites along the way. It was a bit of a bummer but I made it work.  I also recommend reaching out to the ambassadors in the cities you are going to if you have a lot of difficulties finding a host and check out the groups to see if they have an accommodation thread for travelers in that city. One of the 2 hosts in Italy was the ambassador who was willing to help out.  I hope that helps! good luck!"

Doctor couldn't have cared less and did no good. It was pretty cheap.  If you have a host, I highly encourage speaking with them about insurance/medical responsibilities and costs. Do research on your own first and bring printouts of what you found to the table. That way everyone has a clear understanding of legal obligations. I, of course, wasn’t that smart.  I got travel insurance that also covered emergency medical and dental care.  The set of rules I read for au pairs stated that the host family was responsible for medical bills but apparently it was a more generic thing then the Spanish version, which when I translated it (after the fact) said something like they had to get health insurance and pay half the premium. Due to them cutting corners (and me hating conflict and not confronting them) it was not discovered early that we weren’t on the same page. We were also apparently both not correct in what we thought the other party needed to provide when it came to my health.  As soon as I got sick and my host family told me that they would only go 50/50 with me, I started to panic. It hit me that I had no idea how much a visit to the doctor would cost. Panicking when you’re already not able to breath well because of inflamed tonsils and nasal passage is not a fun feeling. I agreed to 50/50 because I was terrified they wouldn’t take me if I didn’t. They seemed to think I should just ride it out and not go anyway, even though their kids had been sick three times since I got here and they immediately took them to the doctor each time. We were deep in the countryside on vacation and everywhere was too far to walk, not that we had internet for me to figure out where the nearest hospital was. They hadn’t paid me the day before, like they were supposed to, so I literally had no cash for the bus and no way to get to an ATM. I was at their mercy and they didn’t seem to realize how they were abusing that by passively refusing to take me to see the doctor.  When I asked how much doctors visits cost my host mother, in her thick Catalan accent, replied, “a lot.” This didn’t help at all because I had no idea what her version of a lot is. My mind went to 300, 500 then 1000+ euros. I didn’t have over 1000 euros for the doctor! Finally after trying to convince me to ride it out because they couldn’t afford even half (if you can’t afford the responsibilities of an au pair, don’t take one on), she said it would maybe be €70. That was such a relief to hear. It was my entire weekly pay but worth it to be able to breath. She still needed to confirm it but that made me think it might be helpful to document my trip to the doctor to give a bit of a information for those caught unexpected with an illness abroad in Spain.  It was Sant Joan, the major Summer holiday here, so the next task was finding a doctor who would see patients. It took another two hours before she’d called two places and found an urgent care clinic that was open the next major town over. The ride seemed to take forever as my host mother told me maybe to stay healthy I should cut back on meat (she has no idea how much meat I eat, since I rarely eat with them) and eggs (I ate eggs for the first time in a long time the day before) and that Europeans eat far healthier than Americans (whether or not she is right, she hasn’t been to America to know firsthand). Then I got to hear the socialized healthcare rant, only none of the points she made seemed to differ from the US. There obviously are things that differ, they just weren’t the things she highlighted as the most important. She wanted me to reply to everything she said but I couldn’t really speak in my condition. When we were near the hospital she said the town was lovely except there were a lot of Muslims. I just shut off my ears at that point. I couldn’t take the ethnocentricity anymore.  If you have ever been to a Walgreens or CVS clinic, imagine that but without the forms. I just had to show them my passport and stand at the counter a little while then wait to be called. It cost a total of €105 for the visit. I don’t know if this is normal or more because it was an urgent care clinic. Due to the holiday and time of day, there were two people in front of me. It still took 30-45 minutes to be seen because only two doctors were working. The doctor seemed disinterested. He said it was tonsil inflammation and pain was normal. I knew that already and was there to speed up recovery and/or dull the pain. I don’t know if he said it or my host mother translated incorrectly but the notion of just suffering through it came up. I had never had a doctor who didn’t seem to make me want to feel better before. I heard the doctor say “ibuprofen,” which had been doing nothing for me, and I started to tear up and asked if there was literally anything else he could give me. I tried to ask for a throat spray for temporary pain relief but my host mom didn’t understand so she couldn’t translate. Instead I got a shot in the butt, which did nothing but add pain, and some pills for pain that also do nothing. The only good thing is that I was able to also get antibiotics for my wisdom tooth that seemed to have gotten infected while growing in.  Then I realized I didn’t know how much the shot and my prescriptions would cost. I tried to ask my host mother and she didn’t understand. Back home my last antibiotics cost $16 but shots are normally closer to $90, in my experience. We apparently weren’t billed for the shot and the receipt from the pharmacy (which was closed but the hospital phoned to make sure someone would be there for us) showed both medicines cost under €8 each. Although I went to the doctor for different things, I thought it would be helpful to do a comparison of my last clinic visit in America with my clinic visit in Spain.  [List omitted because tables are hard]  Total at CVS Clinic was $126, total at the urgent care clinic was 121€."

solotravel,3e1nk8,snailtrailwhale,4,Tue Jul 21 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"First week in Europe and second day in Amsterdam I got a horrible throat infection. Couldn't talk/eat/could barely drink water. Was torture, finally saw a doctor who prescribed me some strong antibiotics with the risk of diahrrea since they were so strong. I had a train booked from Amsterdam to Paris 2 days later and didn't want to risk having diahrrea on the train so planned on not taking the medicine until I was in Paris.   Ended up feeling nauseous the whole train ride anyway, the only thing stopping me from throwing up was closing my eyes (didn't help that we were sitting backwards on the train).   Got to Paris train station, waited for everyone to get off as I knew I would be throwing up everywhere. As I am walking off the train with my 60ltr backpack, carry on bag on the front of me I vomit on the train, down myself/bag and then finally on the platform.   Not entirely sure how to get to the hostel I say fuck it, let's get a taxi (well, type it out to my friend on my phone as I can't talk). Knowing it was only about 10 minute walk away and that it'd be an even shorter car ride my friend asks how much it'll be to get there. Guy says €50. I say, fuck that (again, typed) and we try to make our own way there. After wrong directions from police and two locals we asked I decided I'll just pay the absurd amount of money. At this stage I can barely carry my backpack since I'm so weak from not eating/being sick. We get a taxi and it only ends up being €8 since we weren't near the train station anymore! Make it to the hostel, get upgrade to a 4 bed dorm and I finally started to get better.   Never been that sick in my life and hope I never get that sick again.   Sorry if formatting is bad I'm on my phone. Being sick and traveling is the worst."
solotravel,3e1nk8,mermaidkilla,3,Tue Jul 21 13:50:55 2015 UTC,Explosive diarrhoea and vomiting at 4am in Bolivia. Was on a flying out in 12 hours time and was about 30 hours from getting to NZ which I figured would be a safe bet for medical treatment if needed.   Ended up skypeing a doctor friend back home who told me what drugs to take (that she'd conveniently prescribed) and was able to go back to bed and felt fine upon waking up again.  No idea what it was but it was a horrendous hour.
solotravel,3e1nk8,cupp95,3,Tue Jul 21 08:54:25 2015 UTC,"Both happened on a solo cross country bike tour:  Knee gave out so I pedaled about 3 miles with one leg.  On two separate occasions.    Stayed with a host that had pets while still trying to figure out the severity of my allergies.  Came down with a fever, but had to leave (due to pets).  Luckily, I had a host at my next destination (so I didn't have to camp).  Rode 50+ miles with a fever.  Stopped for a little ""break"" on the side of the road - ended up falling asleep for a little while.  Got into Tallahassee with a fever so high I took a boiling hot shower (as hot as it would go) but was still shivering.  Slept through the night but I woke up fine.    Getting sick while traveling sucks, especially if you're by yourself."

solotravel,3e1nk8,thrownouttosea,2,Tue Jul 21 07:40:25 2015 UTC,"I got sick 3 times during 2 weeks in Uzbekistan (the street food is pretty dodgy).  The last time was the worst.  I spent the whole day hurling, crapping, sweating or doubled over in pain (sometimes the screams were so loud that the hotel owners would check on me and bring me some tea).  However, I'd picked a great place to be sick.  It was a $40/night hotel in an old madrassa.  My room was one of the old student pods and had aircon, satellite TV, wifi and a fridge (where I'd conveniently left some snacks, chocolate and coke the previous day).  The room connected to another pod that had the best bathroom I'd seen in 2 months, so the 20 or so visits I made that day weren't too bad.  I can't imagine what that day would have been like in a dorm."
solotravel,3e1nk8,HotChickenHero,2,Tue Jul 21 12:03:43 2015 UTC,"Three occasions of a dislocated shoulder in Ireland, Cambodia and Bolivia. The latter of which required a hospital visit.  Also food poisioning in Peru while on a 14 hour bus. Horrible for me as well as everyone on the bus.  And a bladder infection in Cambodia which produced an alarming amount of blood.  Those are what comes to mind. I'm sure there were other times too."
solotravel,3e1nk8,kayday0,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"Not technically a sick story but I did get pretty injured in Peru. We were too late to book the traditional Machu Picchu hike so we booked an alternative one that includes a lot if adventure activities on the way. The very first day they drive you up a mountain and you bike the 3 hours down. About 10 minutes from the bottom I was a little too confident and managed to flip my bike and fly/tumble/crash down part of the mountain. I was lucky as I almost solely landed on my hip but that was also the problem. I couldn't put weight on that leg or twist/turn any part of my core. It was miserable. I ended up having to get picked up by a van going down the mountain, meeting up with my crew at the bottom to say goodbye, and then having to take a 5 hour van ride back to the city. It was pretty bad because I speak very little Spanish and the ones in charge of taking me home spoke no English. Eventually through lots of hand signals and vague yes no questions I got to my hostel and then to the hospital where I had an English doctor and got some treatment. Nothing broke, which was my worst fear, but I was prescribed a lot of painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs and was on crutches for awhile. I still managed to take the train up to MP and hobble around although I am awaiting the time I can return to do the traditional hike and have a generally more enjoyable time at MP."

Felt super tired afterwards, but I thought it was the regular “jesus christ I’m such a potato” kind of tired. I guess the whole thing made my immunity super vulnerable tho, cause after that day everything went to the shitter. 40ºC fevers, general muscle pain, super sore throat, swollen thingies in my neck, I couldn’t eat or move for days. I was terrified it would ruin the rest of my trip (still had roughly a month ahead of me), so I went to a local clinic (get health insurance, guys), got examined in a really crappy superficial way (the nurse barely spoke any English) and got prescriptions for 6-7 medicines I’ve never heard about before. 3-4 days later I still felt like I was dying and just trying to breath had gotten so hard that I started googling ways to pierce my own throat with a pen just in case lol. Decided to head to a major hospital (once again, get health insurance, guys, seriously), this time I ended up getting admitted. Got hooked into a bunch of tubes, did a series of exams and finally this really nice doctor (this one was American) came back with the diagnosis. It was fucking mono. He made me read this huge document about it (the title was something like “Mononucleosis: the kissing disease” in bold letters) then I proceeded to feel stupid. I got better eventually and life went on."

Cue three or four days of me shivering in bed, curtains drawn (thank GOD for those!), unable to eat a thug and going through probably six or seven 1.5L bottles of water a day. Hostel switched off the aircon during the day and eventually one day a Bangladeshi dude offered to speak to reception about swapping me to a different bed because I would, after each bathroom break, sit in a chair opposite the ladder to my bed and just stare at it like it was my personal Everest. He was my hero.  Oh; and because I apparently wasn't suffering enough, I started rereading Game of Thrones. Cried at all the characters being together within fifty pages. If I was ever unsure I wasn't a masochist, that about sorted it."

I boarded the train, found a place to sit next to a window, with a plan to fall asleep before the migraine got worse. A few stops after boarding the train a guy politely shook me awake from my half slumber in order to take the seat he had reserved. I don't think many people bothered reserving seats, but my seat was reserved :( So with nowhere else to sit and the space in between the cars full of people I sat in the aisle and tried to fall asleep again. It was a totally idiotic place to try to take a nap, but I was hurting pretty good. It was a miserable day.

If it was me, I'd probably be prepared to be refused sometime (and have plans to hang round in a country for an extended period getting it replaced) but not actually do anything until it actually became a problem.

solotravel,3e1eiy,RemoveYourself,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:59 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same issue. The right side of my passport photo got water damaged and went a sort of greeny colour. I travelled throughout South East Asia and Australia without it ever being a problem though. I did get asked about it once or twice but it was never a serious issue. I actually took it to the British embassy in Brunei when I was there soon after it got damaged and they said that it should be okay even with the slight water damage. On the off chance that it's not okay for whatever country you're travelling to, and you get refused entry, you can get the British embassy in that country to issue an emergency travel document that lets you travel to up to three different countries on your way to your final destination, which I guess in your case would be the UK. You only need a visa ahead of time for India. I would only be worried if any of the countries you're heading to is overly pedantic about immigration. Japan 'might' be a problem so keep the number of the embassy somewhere just incase. Countries where you have to pay for the visa will be no problem as long as the money is flowing. I don't know exactly how damaged your photo is so I can't say what it'll be like for you for sure, but the guidelines I was given said that as long as they can identify you from the picture without too much difficulty you should be fine. I would say don't worry too much though be prepared for the occasional bit of questioning. I don't think you need to wait around and change your passport, you should be able to do that when you get back to the UK."

Most of counselors were from the UK with a good amount of Americans, and a few Germans, Dutch, and Jamaicans. Our camp was in Western Massachusetts with easy access to Boston and NYC on days off. Camp is lots of fun, you spend a lot of time outdoors and meet a lot of people. After camp ended many of the Europeans spent a few months travelling the US. I would recommend it.  My camp was http://www.campmkn.com/.  Actually, if you apply directly through the camp you probably will make more money. (You'd have to book your own flight but meals and a place to stay will always be included with a camp job. Many camps will offer some money towards your flight also.) The benefits of Camp America are that they do the legwork for you, and they can shop you around to many camps. But they take a nice fee in return."

There must be a place not far from where you are that you don't know and where you can have a good time.   I would search for a tourist place close to your area and that's not expensive and after that I'd look for a cheap and well rated accomodation at a hostel or similar. Also a park where you would have to pay for staying overnight but you'd have to bring all the food with you. What's good about cities is that attractions are usually within walking or public bus distance.   My dream trip would be to Barcelona-Rome-Athens and spending a month or two just walking around and talking with other people there. What I do when I want to travel and I don't have much money is picking some cities that I don't know well around my area and going there by bus.

Between Couchsurfing/hitchhiking/dumpsterdiving you don't to spend a ton of money to get to places. Especially if you're fine sleeping almost anywhere.  But ask yourself what you want out of the trip and whether that's attainable with hardly any money. For me, if I hardly have money to taste local cuisine, sightsee etc it takes a lot of fun out of it. And usually the places where it's possible to dumpsterdive and get free food are not the same places as where you'd really enjoy hiking or trekking.

solotravel,3e20fj,pillock69,3,Tue Jul 21 10:06:28 2015 UTC,"That routing is 2 one way tickets one leg with Delta, the other United. Each airline has the responsibility to get you from your origin to the destination. Delta is from Toronto to San Juan, United is San Juan to Vancouver.    If you miss a connection due to an issue the airline caused(mechanical problem, crew issues, etc) then the airline will pay for a hotel and meals as required. If it's for weather issues they will still get you there they just are not responsible for meals or hotels.    Honestly I wouldn't worry about it at all. Both Delta and United are good airlines and will get you where you want to be."

solotravel,3e2fm2,snolep7,6,Tue Jul 21 13:05:02 2015 UTC,"I met my now ex while traveling solo, and I can tell you that as soon as we got together, the people I met and (more importantly) connected with went down to almost zero.  However, we were in the honeymoon stage of our relationship, so I'd imagine that was a contributing factor.  If retaining some of the perks of solo travel - such as connecting with random strangers - is important to you, then you have to make sure the two of you are ok spending some time apart.  I don't mean taking full days away from each other (although that can work too, if you want) but... OK, here's an example:  My sister and I were in Laos.  We've both solo traveled extensively but it was our first trip together.  We're fairly extroverted and ended up striking up a conversation with a couple of folks in our hostel, and they joined us for some scootering around the countryside.  The next day, one of them ended up splitting off to do his own thing so the three of us went off to explore the next waterfall.  I got food poisoning the night before, so I was feeling like crap, but my sister doesn't know how to drive a scooter, so I went with the two of them.  When we got to the top of the waterfall, I just laid down for a quick nap while the two of them hiked down to the bottom.    This story, while longer than it needed to be, illustrates several differences about traveling with someone:   Had I been traveling solo, I could've just taken the day off instead of going out into the hot sun after puking all night.  Had I been traveling solo, my sleepless night of shaking, fever and throwing up would've been a lot worse without my sister there to comfort me.  By splitting up from my sister for a little while, she and our new friend had an opportunity to connect more deeply.   I think traveling with someone can work well, but the most important thing is communicating well.  Had I not told my sister I needed some time to myself, or had she insisted I just push through it - it probably would've been a much lousier afternoon for all three of us.   Traveling with a romantic partner, obviously, is different from traveling with a sibling, but the overarching themes are the same: communicate well and realize if you want to meet people, especially solo travelers, you're gonna have to be the more extroverted ones.  People are probably going to approach you a lot less than if you were by yourself.    Happy travels!"

You can't expect anyone to instantly share the same passion for something that you do.  Imagine she loves asparagus, and on your birthday made a cake entirely out of asparagus.  ""Look babe, isn't this great.  I put so much time and effort into it.  This totally shows how much I love you""  Does that make you love asparagus too?  Baby steps."

solotravel,3e2fm2,6YearsRoundTheWorld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:56 2015 UTC,I think she'd be interested in the experience as much as I am and I know the passion would grow on her. I'm less concerned with her loving what I love as I am about the new couples dynamic in general.  But does traveling with someone inherently make it more about the couple than about making friends and having diverse experiences?   I've seen it said in this subreddit repeatedly that traveling by yourself is the best way to have local experiences and be approached by curious people. I posted my question to verify this and hear some experiences and advice about how to avoid being 'that couple'
solotravel,3e2d1j,Kentucky_Bluegrass,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:30 2015 UTC,"I just spent 5 days in Iceland last week. Reykjavik is a cute little town but can easily be done in one maybe two days. I spent the first day just wandering around, going to the top of their huge church, and enjoying the walkways next to the water. Feeling bored of the town, and not being able to rent a car, I booked a tour to the southern coast, as well as the golden circle and finally a day adventure trip. The final night there I did some bar hopping and met some awesome locals, who we drank with some more at their place. Anyway, what I'm getting at, is I had an absolute blast and saw some amazing sights, basically had the time of my life in 4 complete days there. Honestly, had I not been returning from Europe, I would have loved to rent a car and tour the whole island for a solid 2 weeks, but you'll have to figure out what works best for your time and budget. I'd highly recommend a trip there though, most amazing place I've ever been to."

solotravel,3e2d1j,mmrk93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"I was alone the whole time in the group sense, buses just as a way of getting around (as opposed to renting a car). Had my backpacking stuff, so camped which keeps living costs down (hotels are brutal there for price). Really only bought food and it was marginally higher cost than here in Canada (and they don't have green peppers or ranch, which are my two favourite things).  For as beautiful as the photos of a lonely tent are looking at them in hindsight, it's actually a pretty awful place to camp. Almost zero trees + nearly 24 hour sun in the summer and the volcanic rock texture chews up everything placed atop it. Water to drink is scarce but everything on the south west side is still hot and humid. There's no bugs which is nice but you can walk 50km without feeling like you actually went anywhere + now you're sunburnt, haha.  I'd totally recommend it, it's just a bizarre alien landscape"

Now granted, I scoffed at the idea first because let's face it, traveling is incredible and I can't imagine not doing it.  However, I think it makes a great point.  If your daily life is at a 2 and you feel like a 9 or 10 when you travel, waiting for a trip can be excruciating.  However, if you make improvements and bump your daily life to a 7, it won't be so bad waiting.

solotravel,3e0gqf,calm_chowder,3,Tue Jul 21 05:27:27 2015 UTC,"I've traveled quite a lot, spending a year here, a year there, 6 months etc traveling. I often work to save up money, and I stand it by the fact I like what I do and choose a field (pro horse rider) that I like and has opportunities abroad. I just spent a year working in New Zealand, which was amazing. I don't think I could stomach it if I had to work retail for a year to spend a few weeks traveling. Even with my job, I may move states every 6 months to a year, it's normal in my industry.   So my advice is, find something you like that has a huge amount of flexibility. If you have skills, those jobs are out there... the trade off is close friends, stability, a living space that is your own and you invest in, and material goods. The reward is constant novelty, the opportunity to reinvent yourself as you grow, appreciating the little things, and freedom. Even if you make minimum wage, if you live simply enough and realize that everything you buy ties you down to a place, anyone with a job can save money. Just make sure you like what you're doing. Having an interesting job can be as good as traveling... hell, I worked in the carnival for a while, and with a traveling performance show, and that's as good as traveling abroad. You don't make much, but you also don't need to sate that hole with material goods, so you save money. The carnival is always hiring... check out carnival help wanted groups on fb.   It seems like a lot of people would like to travel, but they get so invested in one job and one place and one group of friends, it's just too much for them to ""give up"", because most jobs won't let you just take a year off and come back. So they choose the safe option and buy a nicer TV and a bigger cable package and settle into their careers. If traveling is what you want to do, you have to be willing to let that stuff go and roll the hard 6."

solotravel,3dzd2q,comfybear,6,Mon Jul 20 19:33:08 2015 UTC,"In no particular order - First, check out the location subreddits that you will be traveling to: r/thailand, cambodia, laos, vietnam, etc.  Do a lot of investigating using the search (upper right).  Next, if you are a photographer bring your best camera (not cameras) with a versatile lens.  You will be amazed at the opportunities for photographs.  I recommend you post your photos, and start a travel blog.    You will meet people if you are outgoing and willing to introduce yourself, sit and talk, and ask to join their groups.  You don't mention if you are into parties, or museums, or Buddhist Wats, meditation, etc. - so finding like-minded people will depend on what you like to do.  Lots of people recommend renting a motorcycle, just be aware that many tourists die from them because the 'road laws' there aren't enforced strictly.  The most important thing is to never drive at night.  But you can also get killed just crossing the street or walking on sidewalks (I've seen motorcycles drive on sidewalks).  Watch what the locals do (for example in Vietnam, it's letting the cars and motorcycles drive around you as you cross the street - a real adventure and not for the feint of heart).  Traveling will not solve your problems and issues.  It might intensify them instead.  Culture shock will happen and when it does you will find no safety net like you have at home with your relatives and long-time friends.  Local cops are not always your friends, but your country embassy is.  One piece of advice: it will cost more than you expect.  That said, you will adapt and find ways to travel like locals (busses, Bangkok Sky Train, and for longer distances take the night-trains).  Try to discover local holidays, they can be the most interesting events in your travel.  In January I'm flying into HCMC (Saigon) and returning from Phnom Penh.  I have no real plans except a general outline of interesting places between and around those two locations.  As /u/meitze says - check out the scams (and etiquette) in each country you are going to visit.  But I'll add, get trip insurance (if you just want medical insurance, claim 0 trip expense).  Get lots of foot massages, and don't miss getting a real thai massage (it's gonna hurt).  Of course learn a few words in the local language, at least please and thank you.  Visit Wats wherever you go.  Unless you are going to ship stuff back home, don't buy trinkets until just before you are ready to return home - but if you find the 'perfect thing' buy it, because once you go to a different city you'll never find that item again...  Absolutely do this trip, you will be mind-blown."

Maybe some people skip monsoon season, but still ... lots of people everywhere *2. I did not plan anything. It was more day-to-day planning about prices, locations, and what to avoid. I´ve found plenty of accommodation everywhere (travelled during rainy season) *3. I am usually completely disconnected from life at home. I simply update where I am and where I am planning on going via email, just in case something happens. I never share photos or other content on social media and thus I am also not doing it while travelling.  *4. check for typical scams before you go to another place, inform yourself about local culture and etiquette. Too many people forget about this. *5. in my opinion, any experience will change you or the way you look at things or change you as a person. Sometimes you might not realize it directly, especially when you get many new impressions.   Culture shock can be very exhausting. Prepare yourself for it. Read blogs, books or articles about it. Trust me, once you know what happens to you, it is not that devastating as if it hits you unprepared.   Have a nice trip!"

Sure it may be $500 for the permit, but that is nothing compared to the cost of taking a separate trip to see them.  You are gonna drop $500 in Europe over 10 days anyways.

I've been to various parts of China about a dozen times, and I speak almost no Chinese whatsoever.  The key is planning ahead.  Research what you want to do, see or go as far in advance as possible, figure out how to get there, how much it'll cost, etc.  If you don't plan ahead then you're going to be heavily dependent on finding people who can speak English, which is easy in some places, and difficult in others.  The railroad system is quite extensive, although the truly fast trains haven't made much penetration beyond eastern China at this point.  Hard sleeper trains will be your best bet.  You'll get a reasonably decent bed, you can travel long distances overnight, and you'll be surrounded by lots of friendly Chinese.  Back in 2013 I did a large loop through China on trains, going from Beijing to Xian to Chengdu, to Zhangjiajie to Shanghai, and then back up to Bejing.  I did spend a few nights here & there between different train trips.  I'd suggest you take a look at the (small) cities of Guiyang and Zhangjiajie.  Especially in Guiyang, you're going to be fairly far off the (western) tourist track, but there are a number of really nice places to explore.

The main sights of Kyoto are quite sprawled out all over the city too, so that's not helpful. I'd say even for a crazy whirlwind sightseeing trip I'd still budget two full days in Kyoto.   If you're intent on one day, I'd personally go and see Fushimi Inari and the Bamboo forest and skipping the golden/silver pavillions. But man, they are really really cool too. Tough. If affordable and goooood sushi is your thing, there's a great cheap conveyor belt place in the Kyoto main train station."

Ignoring the fact that the Bamboo Forest and Fushimi Inari are on complete opposite sides of the city (although I guess they're not an insane hassle to get between if you go by JR), I thought the bamboo forest was a real let down. It's just... bamboo, and it doesn't look anywhere near as exciting as it does in the photos. Felt like a tourist trap. Never went to the silver pavilion, but the golden pavilion was a lot more unique, in my opinion."
solotravel,3dyhfp,snolep7,4,Mon Jul 20 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with /u/LukeyTheKid, try staying in a single place longer.  I like to stay at least a month, because it's much cheaper and I can really get into the local culture that way.  Coming and going in 3-5 days will never allow you to experience the city the ways that locals do.  It's just not possible.  The best part about staying a bit longer is meeting lifelong friends.  Do you think someone you met for a night of drinking will call you when they are in your neck of the woods 10 years later?  Maybe...maybe not.  It's a lot more likely if you've met a few times and had a chance to bond."
solotravel,3dyhfp,ill_mango,4,Mon Jul 20 16:05:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comment and I also agree about sticking around for longer.   Regarding the last bit about lifelong friends I totally agree but you made me want to share the story of this exception:   I made a friend in Istanbul and had a drink and hung out one night. A couple months later he's in my town and we hang out when I find out he's trying to change jobs and move away from London I get him an interview with a friend and he moves to my town (as I move away for an unrelated reason) 6 years later we're still great friends and have traveled together multiple times and I was one of his groomsmen.
solotravel,3dyhfp,ill_mango,3,Mon Jul 20 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"Haha, you've won this round, ""insane chemistry""!  It's lucky to meet a friend in those circumstance =)"
solotravel,3dyhfp,LukeyTheKid,3,Mon Jul 20 18:25:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe spend less time ""traveling"" and more time in each place? Find out places where the locals spend their time, and go there. Not once, but lots of times. For example: if you hang out in a town where a bunch of old guys all go to this one cafe and hang out and shoot the shit every day, and you get in on this, then you'll find the sort of thing you're after.    As for Couchsurfing and AirBnB, you're spending some time with the people who let you stay with them. It's true that some people are using AirBnB purely for money, but many many others also want to meet travelers and share their home and their culture. They might show you around their city, go to the sights with you, and provide a deeper understanding of things you might have only experienced as a passing glance."
solotravel,3dyhfp,teaoh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! This is exactly what I want more of. I like the idea of going to a place repeatedly. In the past it's been a little awkward to make myself a regular in a place and I guess I don't believe I'll be invited to join in. But it must be one of those things where you have to make an effort and stay outside the comfort zone.
solotravel,3dyhfp,KingJulien,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"Be open to joining things and try posting on the local subreddits (ie. Anyone up for showing a tourist around x y z). If you're looking to meet people in the places you stay then you must read the reviews. If a host goes out of their way to be friendly/show you around, it's likely that others will note that in their reviews. For shared house airbnb's, I would look for reviews that talk about how the host showed them around town/was up for conversation etc. Don't have experience with couch surfing so I can't comment on that."
solotravel,3dyhfp,KingJulien,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:33 2015 UTC,Have you learned an additional language? It gives some additional purpose to your trip and allows you to interact with locals so much more.
solotravel,3dyhfp,KingJulien,2,Tue Jul 21 00:37:44 2015 UTC,"Good idea, I love language!   That would've been great when I was in school but these days I guess I imagine if I'm going to live somewhere just to learn the language I'd need to be working to support myself wherever I go and then visa status can get in the way. I've tried the English teaching thing in Thailand and it wasn't for me.   Do you have any suggestions for how to do this?  Languages  come pretty naturally for me because I was raised in a multilingual environment. My family is from Brazil and I grew up around a lot of Spanish. It really does get you closer when you can speak to local people. I have lived in two French speaking countries in Africa  when I worked there and picked up a little--just enough for conversation. I always try to learn the basics wherever I am so that I can at least say hello and thank you. Even a little helps."
solotravel,3e00ut,Percyda13,2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"Sleeping in your car can be illegal so if you plan on doing that, you'll need to do your research on local ordinances and find out where you can legally do so (safely is another issue entirely).   Google maps says that's a 17.5 hour drive. You could tackle it in two longer days and stop somewhere near Montgomery or shoot for 3 days and spend your first night somewhere around the Mississippi/Alabama border and the next just after Atlanta.   As for stopping, an alternative to sleeping in your car could be camping.  If you've got the gear already, a camping spot in a state park or the likes would only run you 20 bucks and give you access to bathrooms/showers/water/electricity."

There are some really cheap rooms in some places a little off the beaten path and as long as they have decent reviews, you might do pretty well for yourself.  The road between Mobile and Montgomery is a little lonesome, but much less so than say Wyoming. You may want to check ahead for construction. Nothing is worse on road trips than a two hour delay because they decided to turn a three lane highway into a one lane one. Also, just plan to stuck in traffic in Baton Rouge ...

It's a little faster to take 12, but not by a ton. Driving and parking in New Orleans is kind of a zoo, particularly around the Quarter, from my very limited experience there.  I think the first question in laying out your route is are you trying to get from A to B as quickly as possible, or do you want to linger and sightsee. Moving to Texas as I was crunched for time, so we basically just drove as much as we could. I'm moving back in a September and plan on taking it slower and stopping along the way. There is no right answer, it's just about your goals."

As a tourist, you tend to stop noticing other tourists pretty quickly.  As far as self indulgence goes, I do honestly think it's a shame at how much Facebook photo-tagging culture has taken over.  I walked a huge cathedral in awe of the intricacies of the facade's design, trying to place it in the context of the time of its creation.  Then I stopped and looked around, and no one was looking up at it.  No one was admiring it.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, had their backs against it with a camera pointed at them.  It just felt like they're checking off a box to say they'd been there, and all they cared about was getting a good angle to show it off.  But, that's just how it goes.  They can enjoy their vacation how they want, and if that's how some people (or a lot of people) want to do it, more power to them.  It'd be nice not to deal with so many crowds over something that personally seems so trivial, but hey, it helps keep these places around to enjoy anyhow.  If it doesn't directly affect others enjoyment, these complainers just need to get over themselves."

Personally, I don't use one because I don't like to out myself as a tourist.  It is a red flag to pickpockets and con artists.  It also seems inconvenient to carry around and is banned in some places.  However, I guess I get the appeal and I will try not to point and laugh openly when I see you with one.  For your Bluetooth question: Bluetooth is a form of wireless communication for very short range purposes.  It is mostly used for audio (headsets, speakers, etc) and for computer peripherals (mouse, keyboard, printer, etc).  However, it is NOT used to connect to the internet (at least not for your purposes).  The short range makes this impossible under most circumstances.  Bluetooth will work when you travel abroad; that is: your bluetooth headset, speakers, mouse and keyboard will still function.  But it will not help you connect to the internet.  If your phone has a SIM card (AT&T and T-Mobile, I think, or an international phone), you may be able to buy a SIM card locally that will allow you to access the internet in that region.  It will depend on your phone, your carrier, and the region you are in.  You will need to do some research or talk to your carrier about options.  Personally, I don't bother trying to get my phone working when I travel abroad.  If I am going to be there for a while, I may get a SIM card for my iPad.  Newer iPads and some older ones will allow you to plug in a foreign SIM and connect."

I came back from Hong Kong tagged in 147 pictures on Facebook and I was actually in about 3 of the pictures.

If you're in a crowded area with a lot of other people taking pictures, maybe forgo the selfie stick and find a friendly person to take your photo. If you're in a less crowded or vacant area, that's where the selfie stick may come in handy. And that's also why I'm looking into one with a tripod feature - it would be handy in less crowded places, and I wouldn't have the ""selfie stick arm"" in every picture.

Parts of the road are pretty rough still so you won't want to be doing it on a racing bike. I had a mountain bike with slick(ish)  tyres. There was time where I had to walk due to the road being gravelled, but for the most part the road is good.   I would recommend a bike trailer rather than a backpack, as unless you plan on doing 100+ miles a day, you will have to camp wild at points. Also handy to have a tent as hotels and accommodation are very expensive. I would recommend taking a whole days water supply with you unless you plan on drinking from the rivers.   The worst part was the wind. Expect it to slow you down a lot especially in the south and west parts of the road. At one point the wind was so strong it picked me up and blew me down a hill even though I was stationary and close to the ground. Don't let that put you off though as it was one of the most fantastic experiences of my life.   Let me know if you have any questions. Good luck"

It's legal to camp anywhere in Iceland that isn't posted (something like 70% of Iceland is 'wasteland'). Accommodation is extremely expensive even the hostels as is food so listen to the advice that everyone else says online and take biscuit bars or instant oatmeal etc.  Keep an eye out for the non-ring road roads as they're likely gravel (restricted to 4x4 vehicles).  We were there last month and saw a fair amount of people cycling it. Just be aware that as you get further north (and higher in altitude) it does get cold, windy and wet. It's also a single lane on either side and despite the speed limit there's plenty reckless drivers who get frustrated and stuck behind a caravan. The western section just past Reykjavik is fairly precarious.  That said gorgeous gorgeous country."

I wasn't super fit but could comfortably cycle 50 miles a day without weight before the trip. I would average 45 miles a day in Iceland, and did a 5 day cycling week. It allowed for plenty of sightseeing.   Including to and from the airport the ring road is about 900 miles, if you take the OXI route ( which i strongly recommend if the weather is good ). This is the route I took and you can see I stuck mostly to route 1 for the rest of the trip."

solotravel,3dwaeu,failuretomisfire,4,Mon Jul 20 05:03:26 2015 UTC,I travelled it by car 2 years ago and saw lots of cyclists.  It seems quite doable but with the frequent rains I think it would be rather unpleasant.
solotravel,3dwaeu,igorken,3,Mon Jul 20 03:06:29 2015 UTC,on the eastern side of the island it would be easier as there is not a lot of traffic.  the west side is far more populated.  shoulders are not wide anywhere.  i did see a few bikers when i drove around the ring road about a year ago tho so its possible
solotravel,3dwaeu,penisbacon,2,Mon Jul 20 03:52:03 2015 UTC,"The only time I felt unnerved with the traffic was around the outskirts of Reykjavik, and the first 10 miles leading out of the city on route 1.   The rest was absolutely fine aside from the odd nutter who would get too close passing."
solotravel,3dwaeu,UpTheShipBox,2,Mon Jul 20 12:24:28 2015 UTC,Did this last year but we chose not to ride the ring road. Since we were on mtbs this wasn't a problem. We saw only the southpart of Iceland. It was awesome. Go for it. The ring road has a lot of bikepackers. Let me know if u need to know more.

solotravel,3dyrpz,Xelaph,6,Mon Jul 20 17:03:32 2015 UTC,Ermm what? There are fast trains going to Interlaken all the time from major cities. And Grindelwald has trains going directly to it (and past it up to the top of the sodding mountain) every 30 minutes.  That area is probably the most accessible section of mountain landscape in the world.

solotravel,3dxuos,spicyindianfood,3,Mon Jul 20 12:45:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't bother going to Pai if you're only going to spend a day there. It's going to take at least 6 hours and up to 10 to get there and back from Chiang Mai. If you are set on going, make sure buses run at that time. The company I used, their last bus was at like 2pm.  Also check you can get from Koh Tao to Bangkok in time. We have a 6am ferry to Samui which should get you there between 7:30 and 8:30am. You'd need a flight at 10:30 or later most likely."

The 21st is the only day that I actually booked things for, and it works out well time wise. I will also definitely go diving at Big Blue during those dates. You get there a day before, then the diving itself takes place in the entirety of the next day plus the following morning, and it finishes by 1pm so i have a bunch of time to do something else in Koh Tao. Alternatively I can head to another island after diving (one that offers a flight to Bangkok on the 29th early morning) and spend one and a half days there. For the 22nd i can skip the first activity (atv/rafting) and head straight to Pai, i can also stay there a bit longer as well if I like it and sacrifice time down south in Krabi.  What would you recommend doing north or south and which one should i give priority to?"

solotravel,3dy8tf,dontbother442,3,Mon Jul 20 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"My biggest suggestion for anyone who wants to travel is to see your backyard first.  Take a day / weekend trip to your local major city.  See your local national / state parks.  Not only will your learn how to figure things out and go with the flow, but you'll appreciate the beauty you have locally!"
solotravel,3dy8tf,ofcrazed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:56:35 2015 UTC,Thank you! I did read about that on sologuides.com and have done a lot of that on my own. My family lives outside of Boston so i spend a fair amount of time taking the train into the city and exploring
solotravel,3dy8tf,jesren42,3,Mon Jul 20 15:46:12 2015 UTC,"If you are scared, I would recommend starting somewhere more or less friendly and English speaking (like the UK or Ireland) so you get a feel of traveling, and then go to more different places, particularly if you've never been outside of North America before.   This is a good time to try lots of different things! Go to museums, shows, historical places or nature places to see what you like best. Also, one perk of solo traveling is that you are the one who gets to set the itinerary, so learn to spend time where you like to spend time and ignore things you don't like, even if they are super popular.   Staying in hostels is a good way to meet people, or have a nice conversation every now and then.   Don't be afraid to do something just because you are alone (but do exercise common sense, especially after dark).   I'm a 24yr American woman who's  traveled and lived in Europe alone before, so if you have any specific questions PM me."
solotravel,3dy8tf,benny_mod,2,Tue Jul 21 01:05:11 2015 UTC,My Experience  I was in the same position as you. Last fall I decided to go solo to Europe. I made that video prior to going and have yet to make the follow up video but I am glad I went. There isn't a ton in that video but the key take away is that I didn't do months of formal planning. I just picked a place and I went.   The first few days were an emotional rollercoaster. You eat a meal alone and you are sad. Then you meet people and are happy but the next day those people leave so you are alone and sad again. By the 3rd day you figure out how to meet people and you stop worrying so much and enjoy yourself. Days 3 through 10 were simply the best days of my life. I was free to do anything I wanted on my own schedule.   Do it. You won't regret it.
solotravel,3dy8tf,benny_mod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:17 2015 UTC,Wow thanks! Watching your video right now. I agree that i feel this urge to have everything planned out in advance.
solotravel,3dy8tf,ill_mango,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah the point of the video was just to ""document"" how inexperienced I was and that I wasn't using rocket science to plan a trip. So there isn't really anything awesome about it - just shows how easy it is.   Also it is a personality thing - some people like to plan everything. I really don't. The only things I planned were my hostels. There are some things you might want to plan for because you could avoid waiting in a line - but I recommend the less planning the better. It let's you focus on the things you are curious about or that didn't think you were interested in but are. It also helps when meeting other people - if you have rigid plans you can't be like ""Oh sure I will shoot over to another country for a day with a fun group of people I just met"". I just like being flexible to do what I want when I want. It is hard to judge what I will want to do months in advance - especially in a place I have never been to before."
solotravel,3dy8tf,Qtips_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"Do you have any place that you've always wanted to see?  If so, just go there and stay for 2-4 weeks.  Take your time, enjoy the city, meet people and get used to being away from home.  Travelling can be a lot more stressful when you have to move every few days, so just some time to get used to it.  If you don't know where you want to go, write down a bunch of things that you want to get out of travelling.  Once you have brainstormed for awhile, prioritize your list and try to figure out how each item can be accomplished.  For instance, maybe at the end, you have ""culture myself"" at the top of your list.  In that case, you may want to choose places that have culture that interests you.  Maybe you like the laid back nature and amazing food of the french.  Maybe you like the colourful traditional clothing and the warm, welcoming nature of the spanish.  It doesn't matter - what matters is that you have a method of figuring out what you want to do.  Then the research becomes half the fun!"
solotravel,3dy8tf,Space_Pinguin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be too worried if you're travelling to Europe. Obviously still be careful but its not as dangerous as, for example, Venezuela. I would suggest you start from the North and make your way down South, using the train as your transportation method so you can see the beautiful landscape."
solotravel,3dy8tf,ms__marvel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"The way I see it : you have a decent amount of money, even for western standards, if you want to take it easy for your 1st solo travel, stick to western europe. There are no safety problems (you have to respect the same basic rules that you would follow in the US of course), the infrastructure is great, the tourism is well explained and it is filled with magic places. Someone advised to stick to english speaking countries, I wouldn't, it's a really important part of the traveling experience to struggle a little bit with the language, you won't feel ""at home"" and that's a plus. Its not like if you were going in the peruvian mountains, everyone understands a little bit of english (please, I can't tell you how important it is to respect this : TRY to engage a conversation in the local language, it's a HUGE mark of respect in every part of the word, and that's something that english speakers tend to ignore) and with google translate it's hard to fail to express a basic concept. One last advice : don't over plan : you'll regret it! you need to plan the big, expensive steps and give yourself a lot of flexibility (if you make some friends -you will- or if you find something that's wasn't well documented on the internet -you will -) Traveling alone is a formidable life experience that will change you, and you will make life long memories. Sorry for the english ;)  A french solo traveller that wishes you a very good trip!"

Great building, great location, great breakfast, great happy hour in the bar. I went there a few summers ago at the start of a Prague > Vienna > Budapest trip by myself and it was great. Met a group of about six or seven and we all hung out in Prague and then some of us carried on to Vienna and Budapest too. Check out the hostelworld/hostelbooker reviews, at the time I went it had great reviews and hopefully it still does."
solotravel,3dvb3d,Splendiferous_,5,Sun Jul 19 23:07:15 2015 UTC,+1 for Sir Toby's. Last summer met two different groups of people there that my friends and I traveled with for the next two weeks after leaving Prague. The bar downstairs is great.
solotravel,3dvb3d,LouisDTV,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:08 2015 UTC,Yes! Stayed there earlier this month and it was great. They have a cool pub in the basement and a nice little outdoor courtyard that's perfect spending the evening or morning in. And it was clean! It's not as close to the action as some other places but it's only a ~15 minute walk to old town.
solotravel,3dvb3d,heyheykitty,5,Mon Jul 20 21:09:22 2015 UTC,there is a party hostel everyone seems to rave about. I believe it is called the Madhouse.

It's just outside of the main part of town, definitely within walking distance, but it is a short 3 stops from the city center via the tram. The staff had some of the friendliest and most interesting people, the rooms were extremely comfortable and spacious, and the bar downstairs made socializing incredibly easy. 1 dollar/euro beers during happy hour were a major plus too. They have hostel activities practically every night, and the twice weekly walking tour is a great way to see the other side of the city. I've recommended it to everyone headed to that city. Enjoy Prague! Best city I visited as a solo traveler, it's got it all."

I found it skewed more towards female travellers (probably because it's somewhat artsy) with a good mix of people. Not a party hostel but I found everyone keen to join the pub crawls around Prague.

However if long term travel = more than a year then you'll have to figure out how to get all your winter stuff with you.  45L is a good size for a few months travel as long as you don't need to make space for anything out of the ordinary and don't buy too many bulky souvenirs."

There is a 5 block area that is totally designated to nothing but optical shops. They even have hawkers out on the streets to try and get you to come into their shop!  Amazing scene! After going into several, it became clear that the information I was given about designer frames being only $10-$20 was not quite true. Yes, there were frames for that price but I wouldn't waste my money on them as they were quite flimsy. However, I did prevail after many stops and found a pair of purple metal and a pair of black & white ones for about $50. Also, I found that not much stood out as being different from the ones I already have. I further prevailed in buying a pair of very inexpensive pink & white sunglasses for about $8.

What you can try to control is requesting rooms that are away from the common areas or not facing the street and by bringing earplugs (and extra pairs in case they fall off)."
solotravel,3dw6x0,felixworks,2,Mon Jul 20 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"I'll piggyback onto this useful comment. Even once you've been there for a night, don't be afraid to ask hostel staff to switch your room! If there are plenty of empty beds, it's a super simple switch. And if it's practically booked up, staff will still look into it for you. Managing the rooms can create complex situations, and having someone willing to switch rooms can actually help solve the puzzle for them. Of course, there might be nothing they can do, but no harm asking."
solotravel,3dw6x0,valeyard89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:09 2015 UTC,Good to know this is doable. It's in everybody's interests to put like with like.
solotravel,3dw6x0,mercival,2,Mon Jul 20 05:22:40 2015 UTC,"Sometimes hostels are located over bars/nightclubs so the noise\thudding bass continues to the early hours.  One hostel in France was full schoolkids who were yelling and running in the halls until until 2am.  If I'm at a hostel, it is to sleep only, not party or listen to noise all night"
solotravel,3dw6x0,yoinkmasta107,2,Mon Jul 20 02:42:10 2015 UTC,"I sometimes look at what the hostel's policy and environment is for making noise after 1am.  Some hostels try and enforce quiet areas in the sleeping floors after midnight etc.  Others have no issue with people running around screaming or having drunk conversations at 4am.  And some have a bar so close to the rooms, that it's loud until that closes."
solotravel,3dw6x0,Emnems,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:32 2015 UTC,"If I ever describe a hostel as being loud, I'm talking about qualities of the hostel that make it loud regardless of who is in the room with me.    The hostel I stayed at in Amsterdam was loud.  It was loud because the rooms were directly over a bar (that was a stop on a pub crawl) so you could hear the bass from the sound system until 3 am (even with earplugs).    The hostel I stayed at in Boston was not loud, even though some dicks were carrying on a full conversation at a normal volume until 2 am."
solotravel,3du755,vojaganto,14,Sun Jul 19 14:47:08 2015 UTC,"Focus on hostels that are bit nicer (and more expensive) with more amenities.  Also, avoid party hostels.   Those of us traveling in our late 20s tend to be able to afford a bit extra comfort and have (likely) outgrown the party hostels where you aren't going to sleep until 3am or later.   Also, checkout couchsurfing.  Many people there who are unable to host overnight choose to act as a tour guide.  Not really the same as meeting a solotraveler, but you get that one-on-one interaction and you'll get a better feeling for the city."

solotravel,3du755,_amnesiac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"As someone who traveled solo through Prague in the summer while 29 years old, I can relate to what you're experiencing.   There were hordes of 18-23 year olds sleeping all day and looking to get absolutely obliterated every night. And fair play to them, I may have done the same ten years ago  After two nights at a very cheap hostel, I moved to the Charles Bridge Hostel, met a couple other people my age who shared similar interests (seeing the city, finding good cheap food, having a few drinks in non-tourist spots), and had a great time  Your results may vary, but often times paying a couple extra bucks for accommodations will provide a much more enjoyable experience overall, at least in my experience ."

solotravel,3du755,Avavva,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:13 2015 UTC,"The further east you go, the more solo travellers and older people you'll meet. Moldova is great, as is the Ukrain (the western half is perfectly safe). I travelled for weeks with people i met in the nighttrain between bucharest and chisinau.

solotravel,3du755,creatinga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"If you managed with not speaking English in Moscow, then Kiev and Bucharest should be fine. Don't know about Chisinau, but since it's a small country, I guess they're used to people not speaking the language."
solotravel,3du755,Avavva,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:35:04 2015 UTC,"I've been through Chisinau recently- most of the larger stores and restaurants will have someone on staff that speaks English, excepting the groceries. If you know any Russian or Romanian, you should be able to find your way around easily enough. If you don't, the usual key phrases (“do you speak English” being major) should be enough. I've honestly seen more English speakers in Chisinau than in Ukraine."
solotravel,3du755,thethirdcoast,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:40:56 2015 UTC,"I spent a week in a small village in the hills near lviv and a couple of days on the countryside near chisinau. Both times the owner didn't speak english but simply called someone who did, and we met some more english speakers later on. Chisinau was a bit more complicated, it gave my 'handsigns across cultural barriers' skillset a workout, but it was a fun place. Some highschool french might come in handy as well. I also went to transnistria and communicating at the border and in the 'country' was really problematic. Going with someone a bit more skilled in russian would've made the visit more rewarding, i think. Most people in my hostel in chisinau also went to transnistria so going with someone else was definitely an option."
solotravel,3du755,humdrumoflife,2,Mon Jul 20 07:31:51 2015 UTC,"Late-20s is still pretty young.  Hostels are a bit tricky, so I would second the couchsurfing recommendation. You might also look for AirBnB hosts that want to be involved with their guests.  Other than that you might try quieter bars and cafes. Don't be afraid to start up a conversation with the bartenders and waitstaff either. Yes they are hired guns, but they can also be an excellent source of local color and info.  You will get a lot of ""where are your friends and family"" judgment, but that's normal. You just have to let it roll off your back, even though I know that is not easy. You just have to accept this is the situation you placed yourself in, so why not make the best of it?"
solotravel,3du755,Spartz,2,Sun Jul 19 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"I think it is difficult, you just have to find the right hostel. Book a day at a time, if the hostel is not right for you, you move on. In Budapest there is a hostel called Mandala, I recomend that place, it is very very small hostel, and I spent many a night up with the owners just shooting the breeze.  The palces where I saw the most solo travellers were places in the Balkans, and also eastern Europe towards Ukraine, etc."
solotravel,3du755,njedc87,2,Sun Jul 19 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"Try to avoid cities with a party reputation, eg. Prague, Amsterdam and many coastal cities. Perhaps it's a good idea to swing by Eastern European towns. I spent a few years living in Bulgaria and have met interesting travelers in Sofia, Plovdiv and Veliko Turnovo. Most of the Balkans should be good according to your criteria (except Croatia, Slovenia)."
solotravel,3du755,snolep7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:32:20 2015 UTC,very true..I'm traveling in the Balkans now and it def has a diff crowd then the bigger party cities of Europe. Both are appreciated non the less.
solotravel,3du755,nikobruchev,3,Mon Jul 20 14:57:18 2015 UTC,"I've travelled quite a bit when I was 19 all the way to my late 20's (I turn 30 next month :O ) I spent 6 years working overseas and that meant ALOT of solo travel. Something like 40 countries later I can happily report that I've never had a hard time meeting people. This came as a surprise because I'm introverted and slow to make friends at home. Here are some things that worked for me, hopefully they'll be of use:   In Europe I noticed that less popular tourism/party destinations draw more of an older, more introspective kind of traveler. This is a bit more pronounced in Asia. Try visiting places away from the major cities. Secondary cities can be like this and often have pearls to learn about and see. The people you meet in hostels like this may be more your crowd too.   You won't want to miss out on the larger important cities try smaller hostels (who would skip Berlin, Rome or Paris??). When you're at larger hostels in a party city you can find more laid back backpackers off to the side having a drink. And don't discount the kids who party, some of them have had awesome stories and would love to hear yours too and usually you can learn fascinating things from the most boring people simply by hearing stories about things that make them different from you. Even if you're not spending the whole night partying with them a few short conversations as they're getting warmed up can be enlightening and help you feel less lonely.  There's some things you can do in any hostel so that company finds you.   I have a little routine: I always settle in by buying a beer and sitting next to a small group or couple. They're usually happy to make small talk and share their experiences and you may even attract a few more people around the common room and it turns into a new group of friends who you can spend some time exploring with while you're all there the next few days.   If I'm staying a few days in a hostel I'll make a point in checking out the common area whenever I come 'home' for familiar faces from previous days and usually also run into a couple of people I met in previous destinations. One time in Turkey I kept meeting the same people from my stay in Istanbul who were doing loops around the country in opposite directions from me and it felt like running into old friends. I also spent a week in Guadalajara Mexico and became the unofficial welcome team.  Spend a little time eating in or near the hostel. Find out where the hostel staff sends people for a snack or get to know what's good in the area. Ask people who've been there a couple of days what's fun to do or good to eat. Offer new arrivals the same courtesy even if they don't ask. It sounds uncalled for but they'll be grateful 90% of the time (they're probably there to meet people) and when they're not interested in socializing (happens) you just withdraw politely. You wouldn't believe how many friendships I've made this way (some long lasting, others just while I'm there).  Hostel staff are a great resource but they can often be great friends too! Most people who work at hostels are doing it to enjoy conversations with travelers. I've been invited many times by hostel staff to do fun things in their off hours that I never would have had access to otherwise.  Hope that helps! If you want to post updates on your trip I'd be excited to hear about your experiences since I haven't been traveling in the past 2 years I love to live vicariously through people in this sub.

I paid a lot to participate and then to have shit hit the fan is disappointing. The rest of the trip is on my own, and if shit hits the fan because of my own poor planning, I can accept that. I really enjoyed the solo weekend trips I took - went to Bratislava, Piercha del Garda, and Florence on my own (although Florence could have gone better lol).  Trying to figure out what to do with all the stuff I've bought while travelling too, since RyanAir charges for checked luggage. Probably flying to Paris on Thursday because it's cheaper than the train to Fontainebleau which is my next destination. Not sure what the best option is for the leg between Fontainebleau and Oxford either but I'll figure it out lol.   Thanks for asking! :)"

solotravel,3du755,accountnamedaccount,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:03:41 2015 UTC,"I did have to get the visa in advance (I'm Canadian) which required sending my passport to an office for a couple of weeks. This is why I wanted to visit Russia early on as the entry and exit dates had to be set in advance.  In terms of itinerary, I just went to St-Petersburg and Moscow which was what I had written in my visa application (+a night in Suzdal). When you stay more than seven days in a city, the hotel/hostel will fill out paperwork to register you and give you a paper to keep with your passport. I don't know if it would be a problem if your actual itinerary doesn't match the visa application."

solotravel,3du755,middlemanmark,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:34:01 2015 UTC,"That's why all of my favorite Europe trips have been in Winter. The crowd that you meet in January tend to be more 'seasoned long-term solo travelers' versus this time of year. A vast majority of people you'll meet now are with friends/family/SOs and are not really looking for people to join them to go out to see the sights or get food, though they still may be up for drinks if that's your thing. I'd suggest looking for the people on their laptops in hostel common areas eating or drinking by themselves with their phone/laptop. You should be able to ascertain pretty quick if they're interested in conversation or just want to be left alone."

solotravel,3du755,zEmo23,2,Sun Jul 19 23:38:29 2015 UTC,"In Moscow I stayed at Vagabond Hostel. It's not super well organized, and the facilities are so-so, but it's cheap, close to the center and to a metro station, and the small size makes it easy to get to know everyone. If you want to get some good rest though, you should avoid the 12-bed dorm.  In St-Petersburg, I stayed at Soul Kitchen which was amazing. They have everything you could ever want in a hostel. Multiple common areas, large kitchen, large beds with curtains, large lockers with electrical plugs in them... and most importantly, super friendly staff.  I stayed quite a while in Moscow, more than two weeks! (Although I should have a gone a couple days to Kazan, which didn't work out due to last-minute planning) It's such a huge city, so there's something for everyone. To me the highlights were:  -The Kremlin and the sights around it (Lenin's Mausoleum, GUM, St Basil Cathedral)  -Hanging out in Gorky Park, if you meet some people and it's a sunny day  -Going to the Sanduny Banya and getting a vigorous birch-branches massage from a big Russian guy  -Visiting the ""Gallery of 19th and 20th Century European and American Art"" for modern art, and the ""Multimedia Art Museum"" for photography."

solotravel,3duava,DanOhDan,3,Sun Jul 19 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"Personally i favour longer ,in depth travel. i lover being able to stay long enough to get to know a place or rerun to the same location even during the same trip.   i feel you could have an in-depth experience with either of the options. so basically your choice will likely come down to budget and logistics. i.e.. are you willing to spend twice on airfare, insurance, etc. do you want an experiences in two different parts of the world or would you prefer one destination?   A very important question here is destination? where exactly are you interested in heading to? your post gives a vague indication of europe but with out knowing for sure or if you want one destination or more its hard to give advice."

I've also looked into Canada, America and SEA,  but I'm really open to anything."
solotravel,3duava,onwardtraveller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:23:46 2015 UTC,"ok cool , so the other big factor then would be the weather/season.  in your original post you mention that you have these holidays available this year, do you mean you have to take them within this calendar year?  because if so, and you want to visit europe or america / canada you should factor in that its going to be a very different experience (not better or worse just different) in winter vs summer. summer is well and truly underway in europe for this year and will be around for the next couple of months but after that it could start to get quite cold/rainy (not freezing but autumn type weather, depending on where you are ). as we get into second half of the year the monsoons will start to finish in asia (again depending on where you are) and by dec/jan/feb it will be high season there. a good time to visit SEA /india   if you plan to do a working holiday visa in western europe then i agree, save that destination for when you are living and working here and concentrate on eastern europe for now.  ultimately i don't think you can go wrong what ever you chose because you have a the winning combination to make travel possible, time, money, and motivation. 2x6 weeks would give you a really good amount of time in two totally different parts of the world. if you just want to concentrate on one destination and not have to double buy on flights etc then maybe one destination, eastern europe or SEA would be great options but don't forget to factor in the weather."

solotravel,3dvmyb,NewOrleansNinja,3,Sun Jul 19 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"I rode from one end of vietnam to the other in june of 2013. Back then at least, you could take a vietnamese bike into laos or cambodia but not into thailand. (My understanding at the time). I'd suggest giving yourself the full month in vietnam, sell the bike there and bus through cambodia to ankor wat, then bus to bangkok.   Or  Take the bike into cambodia and sell it there. a guy I traveled with had more time than I had did that and said it was great.   Budget wise, give yourself at least $10 per night for accomodation, should cost less, but its better to have extra. Very cheap and fun areas to see, I really enjoyed middle to southern vietnam. Hue and hoi an were great, especially hai van pass between the two. I spent about $300 on my bike, put a clutch in it for like, $10 or so, and sold the bike at the end for around half what I paid (it was vandalized outside my hostel and I needed to go soon so I let it go for very cheap.) It was still a cheap way to get around.   A word of caution: the roads, drivers, and conditions are not safe in the least. Id been riding motorbikes for a few years before then and still had a few moments that made me wonder if id make it home in one piece, if at all. I see lots of people with zero riding experience think its going to be an easy leisure ride, but long bike traveling can be rough even in perfect conditions. For me, the pros outweighed the cons in the end. Also, most travel insurance do not cover activities like that. It was a quasi-legal/grey area thing when I did it, and I came out lucky. Just be careful, be safe, and make your own decisions. Youcan also book the easyriders type tours that are covered since you aren't the operator. If you're arriving in hanoi, I stayed at the hanoi backpackers hostel and cannot reccomend them enough. I stayed in both of their hanoi locations as well as their hue location.

solotravel,3dvate,Spartz,10,Mon Jul 20 01:25:26 2015 UTC,"Hey, I can relate in a way. I spent 3 months traveling last winter and it's tough. I had tougher days, even weeks, and I've had great days. But everything you say I've felt or experienced at one point or another, sometimes constantly for weeks.  I met or heard about a lot of people who don't have a good time. In some cases with quite severe consequences. Solo travel is not a great idea if you want to 'find yourself' - especially when you're already feeling miserable. I'm not telling you anyone you don't know, but just to illustrate it for others who might be reading this: removing yourself completely from your daily context, from all the people you know, is tough. You will feel lost. And that's something you have to learn to deal with.  So, without knowing where you are or what you're doing in terms of travel, here's what I would suggest:   slow down your plans and decrease the amount of time you spend traveling find a place where you kind of like the vibe or energy find a host or hostel that's tolerable stay for a few days and focus on something else... eg. find an English book shop and do some reading, find a nice game to play on your laptop or phone and do that... Just 'hang out' look out for expat meetups or professional meetups... if the place where you are is not too touristy, they're likely to welcome travellers. for me this was a good way to meet interesting people, while avoiding all the ""YOOOHOOO let's get drunk"" party guys and girls which would get quite on my nerves (meetup.com is an ok place to find interesting local meetings). maybe get a meditation app like Stop, Breathe & Think, which can help you reflect a bit on your feelings... Now's a great time to check out those things, because you should have more than enough free time. As you can see from the comments and downvotes in this thread, perceived hostility is answered with hostility or similar. You probably want to break that cycle, not just for travel but for in general.   But whatever, focus on doing something that you enjoy. If you need more help on how to meet people in new cities, I've moved to cities in different countries a lot and have spent a lot of time traveling, so just reply.  Meanwhile, I would like to request everyone practices constraint and patience. OP is obviously in a bad mood and there's no need to make their time worse. <3"

In other words, don't try to define yourself whilst you're travelling. Just take it all in.

solotravel,3dvate,flame7926,7,Sun Jul 19 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, solotravel isn't something to use to find a purpose or meaning in life. It's a way to meet cool people and explore new countries and cultures and have once-in-a-lifetime adventures. Nothing more.   The biggest misconception about solotravel is that it is something that fixes the problems in your life. People try to solotravel to find themselves or their purpose or some other bullshit. That rarely happens.   In reality, it does nothing more than exacerbate the situation at home. If you are friendly, have a positive attitude and are outgoing and willing to put up with (or hopefully enjoy) the same 30-minute conversation over and over again, you will discover some of the most fun, interesting and engaging people that you have ever met. Granted, not everyone will be fun, interesting or engaging. In fact, it rarely happens to be the majority of people that you meet. However, when you do stumble upon someone cool and interesting, it makes all of the failed and boring conversations totally worth it.   However, if you are anxious or condescending and are unwilling to give others a chance, solotravel can be so much worse than staying home. Social and personal difficulties at home are not magically fixed by quitting your job and solotraveling. If you have trouble meeting people at home, you're going to have trouble when traveling. If you don't typically have a positive attitude at home, you probably won't when traveling (especially when you're staying in hostels and not luxury hotels). Additionally, those social problems are compounded because you aren't able to rely on your usual crutches (old friends who you like, video games, etc.) to help you through tough times.   I read some of the comments below and some people told you to have a positive attitude. You're right, it is not something that can be fixed by just flipping a switch, it takes months and years of practice to develop a positive attitude. However, it is critical to an enjoyable and positive life and absolutely necessary to a good solo trip. In general, people like hanging out with people who make them feel good about themselves. When someone meets someone with a negative attitude, it's often a key sign that that person (with the negative attitude) won't make them feel good about themself. Thus, people tend to avoid those with a negative attitude. I used to have a pretty negative attitude, but once I worked on having a positive attitude, most of my other problems in life (social anxiety, loneliness) eventually went away.  I'm sorry you're having a bad time. Solotrips aren't 100% enjoyable and memorable experiences. Often that's only about 20% of the typical trip. However, it's the 20% that makes the other 80% of the trip completely worth it.   I'm not done, but I have to go meet my friends for dinner. PM me if you want to talk. I sympathize with a lot of what you're going through and I'd love to help."

solotravel,3dvate,OneDay7a,4,Sun Jul 19 21:50:06 2015 UTC,"You should check out Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, or CBT for short. You clearly have a consistently negative visualization of your experiences, and accordingly, you will continue to do so. If you were seeing a therapist, they would begin putting you through thought exercises designed to break negative trains of thought.  One way to do this (and there are many) is to find something small that you enjoy, like say, scratching a spot behind your ear or wiping water on the back of your neck. When you're having a bad moment, do this action, but only if you can find one positive aspect of your situation. If you still can't find something, do it anyway, because one constant positive is that the action itself is a positive stimuli. It sounds stupid and tautological, but it works. Over the course of a few weeks you'll begin to notice that you won't need the action anymore to find something positive, and ultimately, you'll start seeing things in a more positive light. This takes time. You can forgo the action entirely if you want, and just constantly try to find something positive in your situation, but it's actually a little harder to do it that way. Physical stimuli is much more effective.  I would try to salvage the remainder of your trip by doing this. It sounds like an awful waste if you don't try."

Your experience has absolutely nothing to do with traveling, obviously. It has everything to do with your outlook-- which is very detached from reality and extremely negative.   The problem isn't other people.  It isn't your surroundings. It's not the place you decided to visit.  IT'S YOU.   You need to man the fuck up and accept that. I tell you that out of love.   You're scared.  You feel ""different"" from everyone else. You're realizing you're not quite as confident, interesting, etc as you thought you were...   ..and you're realizing you're fucking terrified-- and this is your defense mechanism.  I understand. I've experienced it.   Most people who have solo traveled have experienced the very low downs as well as the highs. The down times suck. Suck really, really bad. But you grow through them.  Forget how much you talked this shit up to your family and friends. Forget the partying at the hostels. Forget trying to be cool or impress anyone else.  Look for things you actually want to experience. And then go experience them.  I truly hope you use this time for some serious soul searching and that you turn this into a very valuable and positive experience-- because you absolutely can.  Godspeed."

Putting some distance between you and your problems is at best a temporary distraction, and at worst it will only isolate you with your thoughts and exacerbate the feelings.  Maybe I’m misreading your situation, and if so, I apologize and you should read no further.  From one internet stranger to another, you can’t let this ruin your trip.  If you’re going through a dark time in your life, admitting it to myself and others has always helped me.  Call a friend or family member up and vent.  I know this may be out of character for you, I'm an introvert and private person, so it really took someone twisting my arm before I opened up but it felt like a weight was lifted from my shoulders and I was finally able to focus on more positive/productive things. Also, some of the best advice I ever received from a depressed friend was to exercise.    On a side note, don’t get caught up in searching for meaningful experiences and conversations.  You can’t force them to occur, and in my experience I never realize how meaningful/enlightening an experience is until I’m looking back long after the fact.  Good luck and stay positive"

solotravel,3dummo,tangomama,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure what vaccines you're going for, so some of this may not apply. Brit, but I left things too late to get travel vaccines from the NHS so went to a UK travel clinic (MASTA), and there were no problems at all - when registering for an appointment they asked for your travel details, basic health details, and such.  After chatting with the person who seemed very knowledgeable, I got a Tetanus/Diptheria/Polio combination jab, a Hep A/Typhoid jab, and a Rabies jab. All in one arm, I was grumpy that day! Rabies requires three jabs spaced over about three weeks (roughly at 0, 7 and 21 days) to be effective. The others were fine for between 6 months and ten years. We also talked about Hep B but decided against it; it seems as easy to catch at home as abroad (assuming reasonably standard precautions) so there was no additional risk by travelling. They had stockpiles of all the standard vaccines there, so I got the jabs at the appointment.  Single injection of Hep A has a usefulness of 6-12 months, but if you get a booster at six months it jumps up to many years. At that point I got an appointment with a travel clinic in Australia (where I was), turned up with my vaccine record booklet (not an official document) and got the Hep A booster, plus some anti-malarial precautions for the next stages.  Both clinics seemed an equivalent standard, so I'd assume most of Europe would be too. Probably easier in a clinic where you speak the local language of course. Costs wise, I'm afraid I don't remember - both times there was a charge for the appointment, and then a charge for the vaccine(s) on top. US healthcare bills always seem insane compared to European ones, but I don't know if that is also true of travel clinics.  My MASTA vaccine record book has contact details for the International Society of Travel Medicine, so I'd expect they're a safe resource to use to find a foreign clinic."

solotravel,3dtecp,the_hardest_part,8,Sun Jul 19 08:08:49 2015 UTC,"For me, the choice would be clear.  Europe in November is a dreary experience.  Do you really want to freeze your ass off and walk through black slush of city snow?  Even the areas that are not so bad are still much better in the Summer.  I'm not talking about surviving it.  I'm talking about having fun and enjoying the scenery. Unless you're going to ski resorts or plan to drink your vacation away, I wouldn't recommend Europe in Winter.    Thailand is one of the most touristy places on Earth and while it is still a developing country, it's very easy for tourists.  So is rest of SEA.  In fact, I would say that it's easier in SEA than in Europe.  In Europe, you have to research and do things exactly right or you get completely screwed financially.  In SEA, you can just wonder around at will, going place to place as you see fit.  It's stress free.  It's cheap.  You don't have to research your day away to know that X place during Y time for Z people is good value if you do A, B, C to achieve savings.  In Europe, everything is expensive and it takes work to do things cheaper.  In SEA, you are surrounded by cheap options and it takes work to find upscale options.    In the end, it depends on where you are actually drawn to.  Some people have little interest in SEA, and some people have little interest in Europe.  Don't let people box you into a schedule.  Many millions of people live in both places year round and you will survive as well.    With your budget, you might also explore a more expensive but more interesting flight ticketing options.  Multi city tickets are sometimes only a bit more expensive. So, for example, go to London for 5 days, fly to SEA.  Then on your way back, go to Prague or Madrid for 5 days before flying back to US.  Or something like that.  To see reasonably priced options, first price out your tickets to SEA and see where your transfers are.  These will be the cities with cheapest stop over possibilities.  (usually.)"

I would love to fly into Melbourne or Sydney and then into SE Asia and travel from there, visiting Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia would all be ideal. Any suggestions on what order to do that? I'm looking at maps and whatnot but I don't know much about the area and would love input, I just like to have an idea of where I'm going to avoid doubling back.  Motorbiking is also very appealing to me, from what I have seen Malaysia is the best place to buy the bike, so ideally I would start there as I go through SE Asia."
solotravel,3dtecp,witoldc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:46:05 2015 UTC,"Thailand/Myanmar/Cambodia/Vietnam/Laos and even Malaysia - easy.  Buses and flights cover everything.    Indonesia is giant.  It's wider in size than the USA.    Motorcycles are a whole different story.  Buying is easy.  But registering in your name and insuring in your name on a tourist visa?  And having insurance papers for other countries?  Not east at all, even if technically possible in some country.  (I think it might be possible to do from Malaysia)  Most people rent and ride within a specific country, or take a small scooter that may be possible to sneak in and they keep their fingers crossed that nothing happens, because there is a very real chance that they will be on the hook for $X,XXX in bribes to get out of that mess.  Motorcycle accidents are - by far - the biggest reason for tourist fatalities and serious injuries in SEA.  Not recommended if you're not a decently experienced rider.  Adding Australia to any itinerary usually blows up the cost of your ticket.  Australia is pretty expensive as well, though it is possible to do it cheap if you really research."

And then keep moving South, cross into Malaysia and then it's wide open.  Most people who want to visit Myanmar as well, fly into it.    But it's worth stressing that pretty much the whole region is easy to travel.  If the bus stops there, there's something there, there's some hotels and guesthouses, there's good food, something interesting.  It is also all relatively safe and you can wonder pretty much everywhere (except for maybe some shady corners of Phnom Penh.)    Pick 2-3 good reasons why you want to go somewhere and do it.  You will come across other stuff along the way.  The biggest mistake you can do is cover a shitload of countries and cities, but sending time no where.  That is the easiest way to create a pretty travel map, but remember nothing from the trip.  Just pick a few ""Big"" things for you based on your personal interests and do it."
solotravel,3dtecp,ChungLing,3,Mon Jul 20 01:22:21 2015 UTC,"From the middle of France and further south, roughly, winter isn't that much of a big deal. From that point and up, winter isn't a problem because everywhere is used to it so transportation isn't normally too badly affected, and hostels have heaters rather than AC.  Except London. If a single snowflake falls, the Underground shuts down. (Partially /s)"

I haven't picked my dates yet, but flying out on a Tuesday from September to January is the cheapest time to go. I'm actually thinking late-October to November, and hope to be back by Thanksgiving. If you decide to check out SE Asia, and this trip works out on my end, PM me and maybe we can get coffee or a beer sometime."
solotravel,3dtecp,kawasutra,2,Sun Jul 19 08:25:01 2015 UTC,SEA is well traveled so has a good travel network. So it's definitely not to much for a first time traveler. Like you said your months are the best months to go. So if you value a lot of people and decent weather then on a rational level it's the better choice to do it now and do Europe in the summer sometimes.  That said they are very different destinations. Your budget is good enough for both destinations.  I guess it depends how much more you value Europe. And how big the chance is that you will be able to go there in the future if you skip on it now.

You will also spend much much less. Best time to be in Southeast Asia is November to March. Why not do a little bit of both? That's what I did. Go to southeast Asia for 2 months you'll spend maybe 2-3k and then take a flight to Europe for another 2 or 3 months. There will be tons or travelers in both places but for what it's worth southeast Asia is a blast.

solotravel,3dre0p,graceparr,6,Sat Jul 18 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"My advice in no particular order:  -Always have your bag in front of you when sitting.  -I didn't take my phone out with me at night. Just a cash and a card from the hostel with an address. Pickpockets prey on drunk people.   -Siestas are real, and things close in the afternoon till the late evening. Can make getting food challenging sometimes.   -An authentic tapas place will give you the tapas for free when you order a drink.   -Eat paella in Andalusia.  It'll be a bit pricey and take a while to make, but it'll be better than what you find near Madrid/barca.  -Also, look into a Renfe train pass. I travelled though Spain for about 18 days as well last month, and it might have saved me some money.  -I found the bull fighting to be a good taste of Spanish culture. A lot of locals go and a good fight is special to watch. Looks like dancing at points.  -Prepare to eat a lot of ham.  I'm jealous. I fly home tomorrow. Spain was a blast. Enjoy!"
solotravel,3dre0p,Back_door_bandit,2,Sat Jul 18 20:25:01 2015 UTC,"-Siestas are real, and things close in the afternoon till the late evening. Can make getting food challenging sometimes.   This. I knew going in what siestas were, but I figured it was only businesses and large restaurants. I learned that it's pretty much everything. My first day I was starving bc I woke up after siesta had already started due to jet lag.  One recommendation I can make if you go to Madrid is Restaurant Botin. They are known as the earliest founded restaurant in the world and they are famous for their roast suckling duck which was indeed very good.  Edit: Wanted to add that if you are a fan of international sports, there's also the olympic stadium in Barcelona."
solotravel,3dre0p,falange,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"AFAIK restaurant schedules do not have to do with ""siestas"" but with the fact that the kitchen workers are just hired during peak hours (maybe 12-3pm for lunch, and not sure for dinner, maybe 8pm-11pm?), and otherwise they just serve coffee, soft drinks, crisps and so. You can always resort to fast food establishments. Small older shops also use to close for lunch (for example 2-5pm), since people used to go back home, have a proper two-course lunch and coffee, and get back to work. Nowadays there are plenty of larger shops that open 10-8pm or so, non-stop, at least in cities. ""Siestas"" AFAIK were mainly a thing for traditional agriculture workers during hot summer days, since they get up early and no work could be done under midday sun."

I was paranoid about pickpockets before I went, but it's not that bad. Be aware of your belongings and you'll be fine. If you can, get a two day hop-on hop-off bus tour. You can do SO MUCH in a couple of days using that service, and buses come along to the stops all the time. It's a super way to get around. If you want awesome views, go to Montserrat for a day. I climbed to the top of Sant Jeroni (four hour round trip, climb isn't that hard) and was awestruck. Well worth a day trip. Barcelona Cathedral was my favourite church, even above the Sagrada Familia. And it's free to go inside at certain times of the day. For the Sagrada Familia, book a ticket in advance and go first thing in the morning. I did that and had ten minutes of minimal tourists inside when I entered. It gets packed very quickly!"

There is an Eco-hostel not far from Bacoa that is quite clean and well-organized. Bunks are $15 or $20 a night IIRC. The Germans that run it also have another hostel nearby, but it is not as quiet."

I worked hard to find a job that would let me travel.  Then I got hurt. I've been fighting to get back even a fraction of my health for many years now. It's been a roller-coaster. I've done a bit of travelling, but not what I really wanted to do - a week here or there as a 'working vacation' just doesn't cut it.   I'm now just recovering from a serious down turn in my health, where I was stuck in bed for months. I'm only 36.  That was the kick in the ass I needed. I'm getting my shit together and leaving in October for 6-8 weeks in Mexico. If I can do that, I'm taking off to travel the world for 6 months, a year, forever? I would go sooner, but I'm having to rearrange my life to make this work and my health still needs a bit of work.  Travel when you can, don't put it off like I did.

It's what you say.  But vast majority of people don't mean it.    People also have a lot of romanticized ideas about travel.  Vast majority of people who travel get sick of traveling and settle back down or abroad fairly quickly.  There are very few old people who have been wondering around since they were younger.  It's almost never a long term activity for people - and not because of financial constraints, either.  The people who have the best 'set-up' in my experience ALL own their houses.  This is HUGE.  After you come back from your 6-12 month trip, with no job, good luck getting an apartment with $0 verifiable income.  In contrast, if you own your house, you can rent it when you're gone.  Here in DC area, I know several people who could live a budget life just on their rental income.  They rent out their basements and get roommates and have a 2nd income.  And when they travel, they rent it all out and it's more than enough to finance their travel at a decent level.  (budget hotels instead of hostels.)  Saying that you don't want things ""tying you down"" is very short sighted."

solotravel,3dpuh6,ZoomZoomZoom1234,58,Sat Jul 18 07:36:23 2015 UTC,"I have lived in Phuket for a little over a year now. No worries, you're actually in a pretty decent location. Couple pointers:   1) It's low season, so there's fewer travelers around here this time of year. That's because...  2) It's rainy season! Trust me, it can (and will) start pouring at any minute. Head over to a FamilyMart/ 7-11 and buy one of those cheap plastic rain coats if you don't have a jacket already.   3) Taxis are your only option for getting around this island. Phuket has notoriously bad transportation options. Well, that and the bus (which is extremely slow and doesn't exactly have a strict timetable.) Walk around, look lost, and the taxi drivers will come to you. Or just ask a random thai person ""Taxi?"" and they will point you in the right direction. Like you said, your hotel staff should help too. If you have motorcycle experience and want to put your life on the line, you could rent a motorcycle. I advise against this, however.   4) It's the weekend! That means...the Weekend Market! Any taxi driver will know how to get there. It's actually not too far from your hostel. Saturday and Sunday nights only, starting around 5:30pm. Easily one of the best things to do here. It's a massive market full of food and random stuff. Go hungry.   5) Haggle, haggle, haggle. Most taxis aren't metered here. Negotiate a price before you get in! Your place to the weekend market should be under 180 baht.   6) Go to 7-11 / FamilyMart and get a prepaid sim card for your phone (if it's unlocked). If you're going to be in Thailand for a while (you mentioned about going to Bangkok and Chiang Mai), it's a good idea. You'll get call/text credit + 4G. Well worth it. It's cheap. The store staff will help you.   If, and only if, you want to get into some debauchery/do some heavy partying, go to Patong. Otherwise, stay away. It's overpriced and pretty far from you. Still, it's a fun place and it's full of tourists if you're looking for that sort of thing. My advice: head to Thalang Road in the center of Phuket Town. It's close to you and has some pretty cool nightlife. I like Ana's Pub near Thalang Road. Decent beer on draft. Edit: just checked Google Maps, it's a 30 min walk from your place to Thalang Road. That's a dirt cheap taxi ride, so go have a drink there tonight!   Relax, get some rest (go get a massage! Well worth the pennies you pay for one. Should be about 200 baht for an hour Thai massage), and head to the weekend market later today. Get your phone sorted out, explore, and send me a PM if you have ANY questions or want to meet up!   Edit again) I just read your comment history...we had the same journey! SFO to Korea to Singapore to Phuket! Hah, longest flight ever right? Shit, send me a PM."

Can't blame 'em for that though, most tourists there are utter dickheads.  Imo hop over to Koh Phi Phi for 2 days if weather permits, or maybe Koh Lanta. I can also recommend Koh Phangan and Koh Tao during off season. Less touristy but still very nice...and less seedy than Pukhet. The north coast on Koh Phangan is beautiful!   Go chill out at Bottle Beach on Koh Phangan or maybe ""secret beach"" which is only a 5min boat ride from Haad Rin."

If you know what it is, and what treatment you would normally have or want you can get lots without a prescription compared to the UK.   Just in a country where lots of people don't have good health care, if your just sick because of food or the water, and it's a self limiting illness, they may seem unsympathetic compared to the health care you receive at home.   Edit - got sick from the water, I'd been drinking the specific drinking tap water in our apartment (I was working for the first 6 months, came with the job.) was fine till I moved on backpacking. Threw up for water for 5 days, closest to death I have ever felt. But it's minor in the scheme of things. I had to just hug my toilet and wait.  Don't worry, it's bad luck for you to die in their hotel/hostel, they will get you to a doctor if you get worse. Hehe   Good luck,   Source - travelled India solo and have a chronic illness."

solotravel,3dmssa,fracta1,17,Fri Jul 17 15:23:08 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that this is not a cheap method of travel. Most airlines assume last minute travelers are desperate or business travelers and so since they are a ""captive"" audience the airlines will up the price significantly as it gets closer to the flight. Also, most airlines require checkin 45 minutes before the flight (and you have to account for security) so its not really ""right before the plane takes off"". One other thing, don't pay in cash. Paying with cash for a last minute one way flight is one of the triggers to get on the SSSS list. I got on it somehow, and now have to afford an extra half hour to an hour of going through security since I always get ""randomly"" selected for the extra security.   If it does work, let us know, but I expect large sticker shock."
solotravel,3dmssa,jadeoracle,4,Fri Jul 17 15:38:42 2015 UTC,"This is all true.  I'd just note that the SSSS thing is only a thing in the US (or on flights to the US from other countries).  There are low fares available to lots of destinations.  Sometimes you can book them surprisingly late (even the day before departure).  It takes luck, patience and flexibility.  (Don't expect to get cheap fares on weekend departures, e.g.)"

solotravel,3dmssa,shadowvendetta,3,Fri Jul 17 22:57:02 2015 UTC,"It means “Secondary Security Screening Selectee” or “Secondary Security Screening Selection.” It means either you are “randomly” selected or are on the permanent Automatic Selectee list and will be subjected to extra security. This can include thorough bag searches, full body scans, pat downs, and chemical analysis tests, which can then lead to additional “back room” screening if the TSA agent feels it is necessary. Its a USA ""random"" security program."

I put it in quotes as I know some of those in various airports are nearby the security area and are just glass rooms while others are more traditional questioning rooms like you'd see in a police station.   My sister got taken to the ""back room"" at DIA (Denver) when she was 16 because she was carrying one of my mom's bags (she had 1, mom had 3...so little sister got stuck carrying on the ""extra"" bag.) It triggered the alarms, my sister didn't know what was in them so she and her bags got taken away from general screening to the next level of screening at the back rooms because she seemed suspicious since she didn't know what was in the bag, so they wanted to question her further. Turns out it was my mom's food bag, and had a huge jar of peanut butter in it.  Which is considered a gel...and needed to be in much smaller quantities. If my sister had known and was like ""oh...yeah you can throw that away"" she would have been fine, but since she had no clue what was in the bag they were worried she was a mule taking drugs or bomb materials disguised in a peanut butter jar. She was held for about 25 minutes, nearly missed the flight."

You can remove a city for €5, or if you know what days Germanwings flies to a certain city you don't want to go to, go on a different day.

If you get there early enough and don't mind the cost, the Rijksmuseum is massive and can take hours to get through. I got there at 11 and didn't see it all before they closed at 5.  If you can bear the legwork, then hiring a bike is pretty worth it; I'd recommend black bike as the cheapest ones I could find (~€7/day). They are the ideal way to get across the city, everything is so flat. With a bike you can get across most of the canal districts a few times a day, and if you're moving around a lot it might add up to being cheaper than catching the trams or metro around."

Human skeletons are used as furniture, decor, etc., all throughout the interior architecture. It's very intriguing and hauntingly beautiful. It's about 84 km from Prague.   There's also Terezin, a town full of dark history about 63 km from Prague. There's a ghetto/concentration camp as well as a Gestapo prison, if you're interested in WWII history.   Karlštejn is also a fun little trip. It's a bit touristy, but the castle and surrounding landscapes are stunning. Only about 30 km from Prague, too.   If you like hiking, check out Bohemian Paradise/Český ráj. It's beyond gorgeous and provides endless exploration. There's castles there, too! It's about 97 km from Prague.  I definitely second the comment about Český Krumlov. I went rafting with my friends there and it's a blast. Beautiful, relaxing town. It's 170 km from Prague.   I lived in Prague for a short while, but since your sister lives there I'll spare my recommendations, unless you want them, haha.   Lastly, Bruges is great, if you find the time to go. If you haven't seen it already, watch In Bruges, a British-American crime-black comedy film - the cinematography alone will entice you to go! I only spent a day there, but any of the little towns of Belgium (Ghent, Antwerp, etc.) are very much so worth it.   Hope this helps, have an awesome trip!"

solotravel,3dneux,Kittyfiever,3,Sat Jul 18 16:06:56 2015 UTC,"Just finished traveling around Thailand for a few weeks. I'd say that while I agree with most of the comments here that SEA is a great place to travel cheaply and safely, it does kinda depend on what your definition of safety/comfort is.   You're not likely to get into any actually serious/dangerous situations in SEA if you use common sense, but that said, I do think there is something stressful about having to constantly be on your guard for scams, etc. That is certainly the case in Thailand and I'd guess a lot of SEA.   I stayed in Tokyo for a month last year and wouldn't hesitate to jump in a cab late at night or get lost and ask locals for help -- it felt very safe and I rarely felt that anyone was trying to take advantage of me. In contrast, in Thailand pretty much every taxi/tuk-tuk/minivan ride I took I felt like I had to at least make sure we were headed in the right direction and not to a souvenir shop, etc.   Again that's not to say that SEA is particularly unsafe or that many people are trying to really cause you harm. But just be aware that you will have to be on your guard and generally a little cautious of people trying to take advantage of you. In general I think if you want to feel very safe and comfortable all the time, you probably have to stick to mostly 1st world places which are usually much more expensive. But it's worth knowing what you're getting into especially if you've never travelled abroad much."

solotravel,3dneux,SmellsLikeDogBuns,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:23:36 2015 UTC,I was nervous being by myself and everything I had read about Amsterdam said to stay away from there if you were alone.

It's always full of English tourists, from stag dos and business men to family's with their kids (earlier in the night anyway). Honestly never felt in danger in Amsterdam (and I'm normally stoned as shit). Maybe if you were pissed out of your mind, but you'd be in the same position in any major city.

solotravel,3dmozh,icantsleepwithothers,15,Fri Jul 17 14:53:48 2015 UTC,Note that hostelworld prices private rooms usually by person (for two people).  If you're just one person then private rooms in hostels can actually end up being more expensive than some cheap hotels.
solotravel,3dmozh,valeyard89,2,Fri Jul 17 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"This is my experience as well. Sometimes you can get a really good deal still, or if you're really lucky pay for 1 bed and get 2 because nobody else booked the other.  You can always just clear up whether you are reserving the whole room or not before you book, but that's not always easy to do if you are online or in an app."
solotravel,3dmozh,drewmate,2,Fri Jul 17 15:16:13 2015 UTC,"It can be the best of both worlds. I think it's common for people to move towards them as they age. I'm 27 and a private room in a hostel is great for me when I'm starting to feel tired or need a working A/C unit. I use them ~30% of the time but I can tell soon it's going to break the 50% marker. Dorms can be a lot nicer to meet a group of people though. I've got some terrible small talk skills so dorms force me to socialize, which is nice a lot of the time."
solotravel,3dmozh,astro65,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:04:52 2015 UTC,"It can be the best of both worlds. I think it's common for people to move towards them as they age.    Early 30's here.  I haven't done private rooms in hostels yet but I can feel myself being pulled in that direction. It's nice to be able to wake up early/come back late without having to worry about waking anyone else up in the dorm room. Or vice versa with other people waking me up, e.g. drunk loud partiers stumbling in at 4:00 a.m. in the morning.  I just hate how hostelworld makes you pay for 2 people even if you're traveling by yourself, for many private rooms unless they're single rooms.    I still like the social aspect of meeting other travelers, so I'll probably stick with hostels for the near future. Make friends in the common area/living room, then retreat to my private room when I want peace and quiet."
solotravel,3dmozh,gotthelowdown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:19 2015 UTC,I did private rooms with the gf in most of central and south america. cheaper than a hotel and we got out privacy for you know unwinding. I recommend even if you are solo you get the great vibe of the hostel and privacy. they can just be harder to come by so be sure to make reservations a night or two before.

I did the same in Shanghai last week and am doing the same in Xi'an in a few days. I really appreciate the privacy factor, plus not sharing bathrooms with 50+ people. It's great! Sure, the rooms cost more, but it's a much better vibe staying in a hostel VS a hotel, and for a 19 day trip, I could afford to spend a little more. Still worked out to be less than a hotel would have, plus I've met so many great people along the way"
solotravel,3dmozh,themessyb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:55:56 2015 UTC,Sure they are viable.  But it's worth looking at hotel prices too.  Sometimes a private hostel room can be as much as or more expensive than a hotel room which typically will have better amenities.
solotravel,3dmozh,yoinkmasta107,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:23:12 2015 UTC,I got a private room in a hostel in Vienna. It was cramped but still a nice break from dorms. I later realized that an airbnb apartment would have been quite a bit cheaper... but then you're missing out on the opportunity to meet other travelers.
solotravel,3dmozh,vojaganto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:13:19 2015 UTC,"When I stay in hostels, I typically only stay in private rooms.    You need to check the country, though.  In some countries, a hotel room will actually run you less than a private room at a hostel.    Also, as other posters have noted, when booking them, many sites list prices by person, and say a private room is charged as two people, no matter how many people stay in it.    Anyway, they're definitely viable.  They're often just like hotel rooms except with less frills."

I personally have found that to be a load of dung.  I've been on the road for the last year and a half and haven't had any issue whatsoever with theft. I've stayed in numerous hostels and walked down many a shady alley and haven't felt threatened whatsoever that my things would be taken. I started my trip with my iPhone 5s (and have since upgraded to an iPhone 6+) and also brought my MacBook Pro along as well. As long as you're not an idiot about keeping your things close, you'll be fine. I bought a Kensington lock for my computer and if I absolutely feel uncomfortable, I can just lock my laptop to the table. You'll find while travelling that most people won't give a second thought to you and your gadgets. Just don't use them if your surroundings look fishy, and you'll be fine. As for a phone bill, just get a local SIM card and you've nothing to worry about.   If you're absolutely paranoid, you can buy a burner phone to use and leave your laptop behind. That's totally your call."

For my personal trips I usually take a good camera and a couple of lightweight prime lenses and love the ability to edit on the road. I always used to want my laptop around for this but didn't like the extra precautions for security (using it discretely, making sure you lock it, I just upgraded to a body with wifi and am totally happy pulling a few great shots, editing them on my iPhone 6+ (excellent screen-estate and great resolution) and posting them or sending to friends/fam. I make sure I have a way to back up the remaining images on longer trips. The nice thing about not having my laptop is it takes my mind off of actively working on images and so I spend more time socializing or enjoying my trip."

I use the hell out of mine, it saves me having a camera, almost every hostel I'm staying in has good WiFi so every night I upload my photos. If you're only in a certain country for a few days, it might be worth just using WiFi while you're there and otherwise being on plane mode, outside of emergencies.   If you do end up taking a smartphone, one app I've found indispensable has been maps.me: free offline apps. You have to download regions before you can use them, but they're pretty detailed, and can be better than google/apple maps in certain ways (it has hiking trails in Norway, while google maps doesn't, for example).  In Europe, you can do just about everything to save you time online from moving money around your cards/accounts, checking in to flights, booking train seats and accommodation, not sure how this holds up elsewhere though.  If you do end up in a single country for a while, prepaid sims are dirt cheap and pretty cost effective, but for calling home I'd recommend just Skype or Facebook messenger or whatever internet phone service is common where you're from."

You need to be more careful for sure. And once you're on the laptop it's a lot harder to start conversations and meet people in my experience. Or rather, people won't look to start conversations with you as much. And depending on yourself, you can get sucked into all sort of timesinks instead of living the now.  I'd advise against a laptop for most people."

I've standardized on Sony products because they are moving to all micro-USB connectors. That means I only have to bring one or two adapter cables tops. I also like how they make it easy to dump images from their cameras to your smartphone for sharing.  I have a OneSIM card for my cell phone, works in 200 countries. You add credit as needed through their website. I think you can call as well. I use the phone for emergency calls and some texting, I try to find a WiFi hotspot if I need data.   In some areas, Vodafone will let you buy a week long WiFi pass for 15 euro, which is a much cheaper solution.

The laptop is your choice, I don't know your personal situation but for me I travel to get away from things lile work and technology. For this reason I deliberately leave my laptop and tablet at home to force myself to find something different to do in the country if I get board.  I get worried about phone bills too but I always take mine because they're very handy in an emergency or to meet up with other travellers, and if you use it scarcely the bill should be small.  Most hostels have free WiFi if you want to talk to people back home, I wouldn't waste your mobile credit on that."
solotravel,3dmbi5,burkyeah,4,Fri Jul 17 12:52:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest, it can be hard to meet people on Koh Tao as we get a lot of people traveling in groups. It also doesn't help you can get a really nice private bungalow for the same price as a dorm bed.  If you are doing some diving it gives you pretty easy access to people, though it seems to be hit or miss whether they hang out afterwards. If you are going diving, I can PM you the name of a really good school that is extremely social, so at the worst you can hang out with the instructors/DMs.  I'd recommend staying in Sairee. If you want a private bungalow, ask the taxi driver for Prik Thai. The owner is really chilled out, and they have anything from 250 baht to who knows. 5-600 baht a night gets you a nice room, huge bed and hot shower.  For hostels, ask the taxi for the road Choppers is on. Walk down that road about 20m and on your left is a hostel that always seems busy, no idea what it's like or the prices. Only downside is it might be noisy until Choppers shuts around midnight, so it might be a pain if you are diving early.  Alternatively check out SpiceyTao. It's an absolute dive, easily the worst I've seen, down a road that isn't lit at all at night, but they have tonnes of social activities.   Edit: Also if you want to rent a bike, let me know and I can give you the place to get 1. They don't ask for a deposit or your passport and don't care if you scratch it up a bit. Anywhere else and theres a 50% chance you will get scammed."

To be fair, I did have a spill when I took it off road up by the reservoir, but they really had my nuts in a vise so to speak when using my passport for leverage. That sucked. Found out later that many other places are cooler, and don't have business models built around excess extorsionist fees. Live and learn, I guess."

solotravel,3dmlnj,LongandLanky,6,Fri Jul 17 14:59:25 2015 UTC,"This.  Venice is incredibly small and you can explore the main island easily in one day.

solotravel,3dmlnj,Teh_Apotheosis,4,Fri Jul 17 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"2 nights sounds about right to me.  Take what we're saying with a bit of a grain of salt too.  We may be very different travellers and you'll love how small Venice is and want to explore every nook and cranny, so it's not enough time.  I would say, just be prepared to alter your plans if you find what we say is also true for you.  Quick note regarding your budget.  I lived off 75€ per day while in Europe pretty easily.  A lot of hostels have free breakfast included, so look out for that.  If you haven't booked in Florence yet, I recommend Tasso.  Great place run by good people.  A little pricier than others but worth it."

solotravel,3dmlnj,internetsuperfan,3,Fri Jul 17 19:35:19 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of tips, so here goes.  I did most of this trip in June.  Venice: Do the free walking tour.  You have to register in advance.  Very worth it.  Don't forget to tip (5-7 euros) at the end.  Also take the boat to Burano.  3 days might be too much or might not.  I was there 1.5 and it felt too little.  Florence: Day trip to Siena, too.  Don't forget the Palazzo Vecchia.  Better view than the Duomo, and very cool interior.  Naples: There are two underground Naples tours.  They cost the same.  One is way cooler.  Be careful.  There is also a cable car that goes to the top of a hill which gives a nice city panorama.  Hostel of the Sun is great.  Stay there.  Rome: There's a place near the Borghese Gardens where you can see a great city view/sunset.  San Giovanni is also a very worthwhile church.  Capitoline Museum is also cool.    Finally, don't forget advance bookings! You can save tons of time by reserving the Vatican and Uffizi in advance.  Villa Borghese I believe is a mandatory early reservation.  And definitely reserve the trains in advance.  The Roma Pass can also save time (and sometimes money) by letting you skip the Colosseum line.  My costs were $1,200 including trains but not the plane.  It was a shorter trip than yours, though.  You have 19 days and I had 11. So adjust accordingly.  I spent $60 per day in Naples, $90 per day in Rome and Florence, and over $100 per day in Venice.  I wasn't splurging but I was eating out a decent amount."

solotravel,3djtuy,mllenathalie,37,Thu Jul 16 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"Well one way would be to start planning your next trip, get your head focused on that and start saving. And there's nothing wrong with doing that. People are often afraid that they will 'waste' their young life by not settling down. I've met few people in their 30s and 40s who openly wish they'd worked more and travelled less.   The other thing to consider is what you really miss. It sounds like it might be a bit lonely at home. A bit dull. I guarantee you wherever you live someone today is traveling nearby, having the time of their lives.   When you're back home it can seem harder to meet  interesting people, to find exciting adventures and experience new things. If you put in the effort you'll find a lot of those things can be found wherever you are if you're actively looking for them. And now that you've experienced them you know that's what you want your life to be like.   So my advice would be:   Start looking for ways to make your home life more like your away life.  Don't feel like you're missing out by putting energy into anything that makes you happy. That's what you're here for.  If you really can't be happy where you are consider moving permanently."

So I started to do that.  Then I made some new friends, found a new place to live, and things started to fall into place again. And some time later I went to travel again. And came back again.   The career will happen. You sound like you're still fairly young. I was 27 by the time I got my first 'real' job. And volunteering somewhere for a while actually looks good on a C.V. So for now I think you have the right idea: start to work for a few months, save up some cash, see what life does in the mean time. If you still feel like this then, just leave on another trip, go volunteering, have a blast. You don't need to decide everything today.  And some post-travel blues is normal. I still get it everytime I come back. Planning new trips tends to help :)"

I did not go on my first trip until I was 32 when all of my friends are climbing the latter in corporate, mortgage, and kids. I dropped everything and left for two years sorta. It was supposed to be a one year traveling which extended to 14 months. I came back home, Boston, ready to settle but couldn't do it. I was super depressed and felt really shitty all the time. I found an easy $12/hr customer service job, did that for 6 weeks and went back out for another 7 months. Instead of going back to Boston, I moved to SF.   It helps a little moving to a new city. Every weekend, I try to go away, see and do something new. So far so good, but I have no plans settling down.   Like everyone else said, save up and get the hell out."

I think in some ways I may still be reeling, but it's been so long that, if anything, it doesn't carry the same intensity. My first trip was to Hawaii for about a month. It wasn't an extravagant trip, but it was my first time traveling alone in a new locale. After 6 weeks, I returned home and things felt weird. I felt out of place. I didn't belong. Everything was the same as I'd left it and I felt like so many things had changed for me that I no longer vibed with my home.  It took me about a month to come up with the idea to go back the next summer and so I worked for about 8 months and developed a plan to live out there for about 6 months. In that time, I started a Wordpress blog that I still write in and that I'm currently transitioning into a full-fledged travel blog. It was my place to recollect and reflect on the experiences I had while traveling. When I finally got out there the second time, the trip ended up changing my life. I didn't end up spending the six months there that I had planned on, but it really helped with my longing for travel once more. When I got back from that trip, I wasn't as depressed. It seemed like the second trip just seemed to complete the experience of the first trip.  It's been four years this month since that trip. For the last two years, I've been itching to get out again. I've had Chile on my radar since that last trip. Not sure why, just a gut feeling that I should get down there. I'm hoping this trip is the beginning of a nomadic lifestyle."

The good thing is they're not part of Schengen Zone so I can do 90 days allover Ireland, and then go around the Schengen zone for up to 90 days as well. Doing HelpX should help keep my costs down and I feel like it will give me a more authentic cultural experience than sightseeing.

You are sad because you have not integrated your experience into your life, which will do two things: change how you view your life back home, and transition into your next adventure. If you are not actively seeking out the next adventure - either at home or abroad again, then you are travelling for the wrong reasons. Set up some goals and use your newfound perspective on life to spring board you to your next adventure.   Oh and that gap in employment? Perfect opportunity to bring it up in interviews. It makes you a kick ass candidate, because who DOES this kind of stuff, except really cool people, am I right?"
solotravel,3dlsdw,gooseachoo,4,Fri Jul 17 08:33:57 2015 UTC,"Native ATLien here; I lived in the Midtown area for years, and can recommend a few places to check out. MARTA (public transportation) will get you to a fair number of places within the city, but for things off the beaten path, I recommend Uber or Lyft. I'd also like to mention that although MARTA has dramatically improved in recent years, I'd still be skeptical of riding alone after 10 PM. Typical tourist spots include the World of Coke, Botanical Gardens, and Georgia Aquarium. The more adventurous tourists can check out the Clermont Lounge, and if you're outdoorsy, Stone Mountain has a great hiking trail and laser show after dark that's pretty cool. You can check out ATLtodo.com later in the day to see what shows and events are going on tonight, I think there's a Bastille Day parade/jazz event going on later.  As far as food/bars go, I strongly recommend The Vortex if you want true Americana food; their burgers are some of the best in the city in my opinion, including the vegetarian burger, if you're into that sort of thing. The Cypress Street Pint and Plate is a good casual bar for enjoying local beer and cheap-ish appetizers and meeting millennials. The Daiquiri factory on West Peachtree is known for strong drinks and very confident members of the black LGBT community. I haven't been myself, but have heard the people there are great to talk to and will give you a very positive and memorable experience. If you're interested in the LGBT community or a more metrosexual atmosphere, you can walk up and down 10th Street from Peachtree all the way to Piedmont park and hit any number of affluent bars; it's also a fairly safe part of the city to get drunk in, and there's a chance to meet local celebrities."

Not entirely sure, but it may be just about half-way between Edinburgh and London.   Plus it's not too far from Leeds, which is a big city. Not that much to visit in Leeds city itself; it's famous locally for its Victorian shopping arcades. Plus Leeds has the Royal Armouries Museum, which is pretty cool. Leeds is a fairly modern town, though there are some remnants of its industrial past, with some 19th century civic architecture, especially in the centre.  York itself is an old Roman town (if memory serves with some Viking influence). Quite historic and important in British history, and the minster there is stunning.

How do I get a job for post-grad if I won't start for 3 months after?   The same way you would any other job. If anything it will be easier because not everyone that just graduated will be applying at that time. Plus with as many people as have studied abroad not working and taking a trip like that is almost a plus. At the very least it shows you are resourceful and can think on your own. It is also good small talk for interviews.    How can I be sure I'm not throwing $400 at a ticket that I'll never use?   Only you can decide that. But what is worse: getting to that point and wishing you had bought it or losing $400? Do you know how much money you will make over the course of your life? $400 won't even be a drop in the bucket. Plus at the very least you can fly over there, see how it goes, and fly back in a day if you hate it.   I did a similar thing last year. I had never been to Europe and no one would ever go because they are busy or have kids or some other grown up bullshit. So I finally one night drank a bottle of wine and said screw it I am going solo. 30 minutes later I had airfare book to Belgium and it was literally the best decision I have made until this point in my life. Worst case scenario is you take the trip and you hate it.

solotravel,3dkux7,slowlymakinghaste,5,Fri Jul 17 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"First of all - Portland is a fantastic city for first solo trip, so have fun!  I think most people will tell you - to make the most of any trip, you have to be open to new experiences and willing to step out of your comfort zone. Whenever I'm traveling and I find myself wanting to revert back to things I'm familiar with vs things that make me feel a little uneasy (for example: ordering a coffee at starbucks in France vs ordering a coffee at a local cafe in France with broken French), I ask myself ""When am I ever going to have opportunity to do this again in my life?!""... And usually the local cafe wins.  I also like to remind myself to be mindful. Like stop for a minute and REALLY take in the sights, the sounds, the tastes, the smells, the feelings... Don't rely solely on your camera to make the memories for you! Also - keep a journal. Even just to joy down your favourite meal from a restaurant.  Are you ok with staying in hostels? In dorm rooms in hostels? In co-ed dorm rooms in hostels? I find they're a great way to meet people. Whether it's talking to your roommates or chatting up the table beside you at breakfast, you know that everyone is there for one common reason - travel!! - so it's easy to strike up a conversation. It might be as simple as saying something like ""Hey have you guys visited ______ yet? What did you think?"".   I hope that helps a bit! Once you get started, I think you'll find that solo travel is way easier than you imagined. Feel free to message me if you have any other questions!  Enjoy your new adventures!"

I am a writer, so I will be spending a good deal of my time writing.  I am staying in different places.

To get off the beaten track, a car is ideal. Other options are bus tours but not everyone would like this, some would love it of course.  I presonally always rent a car when I travel but I'm very used to switching sides. It really depends on your goals and confidence. Off the main roads, country roads can be narrow and poor quality and a little scary, but many people do it and get on fine."

WHAT TO DO: I'm interested in seeing castles/ruins, mountains, sea, remote areas/towns and neat pubs. I'm obsessed with history so anything historical peaks my interest, especially from the 1400s/1500s/1600s. Might do a tiny bit of poking around in the city after I arrive in Dublin, but it's not my main goal whatsoever so I'd like to limit my time in major cities/tourist attractions as much as possible. PEOPLE/ACTIVITY LEVEL: Prefer a good mix of isolation/people. I'm comfortable in pretty much all situations and though I would like to meet/talk with people occasionally, I naturally lean more towards isolation. Would like to do a lot of hiking/walking/investigating the ruins and sights. BUDGET: Decent, and since I got the flight for $760 and the car for ~$350, I'm pretty flexible. I'm thinking ~$3,000 not including flight + car. It's an 11 day trip arriving September 23 and departing October 3. This is the first time I've traveled on my own so let me know if my budget is insane as I do have some wiggle room. LOCATION GOALS: I would like to move around a good deal. Goal is to make it from Dublin across to the opposite coast, seeing places along the way, then drop down the coast before making my way back to Dublin. Just stumbled on a coastal town called Ennistymon which looks pretty perfect! ROOM/BOARD: Don't need nice hotels. Am more on the hostel/occasional B&B track to save $ and meet people.   I hope this helps! Thank you so much for your help!!"
solotravel,3djnza,ishboo22,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:24 2015 UTC,"That budget seems like plenty to me. Enistymon and the area around it (that is County Clare) is a fantastic place to visit with excellent scenery, quirky towns, good food, excellent pubs and plenty of isolation.  I suggest this: from Dublin go to Kilkenny then to Kinsale where one of the best marked routes in the world begins, it's called the Wild Atlantic Way. It goes from Kinsale in the very south all the way up the west coast to Donegal in the very North (including passing through Clare). I'm not sure if you could do all of it in 11 days, but you can certainly do most of it. Drive up alone this route until you need to head back to Dublin. Add in a night in Dublin if you wish.  http://www.wildatlanticway.com/home/  Kinsale is a beautiful town full of good restaurants.  Some other highlights: Beara Peninsula, Valentia Island, Killarney, Dingle, the Burren, Connemara, Galway City, Westport, Achill Island, Sligo and  Donegal. All these are along this route or just a little off it.  Don't think that because this is a sign-posted route that it will be excessively touristy. This is well after peak season and you will reach plenty of remote places, but they are well set up for visitors also so you won't seem out of place either.  That time is out of peak season, you will have no problem getting accommodation. If you like to have a solid plan ahead of time then book ahead, but you don't need to. You could easily find accommodation as you travel, or else ask in each B&B for a suggestion for the next town you're likely to reach and a quick phone call that morning will get you a booking for that night. Typical B&B price is 50-60 Euro per night.  Don't plan to do too much mileage. Take your time. Roads are small and mostly quiet. You can't rack up hundreds of miles every day and you shouldn't try. Stop the car, get out, walk the beaches, stop in pubs and cafes for lunch. Walk up hills and look at cliffs. Around Westport, walk up Croagh Patrick and see the best view in the country (wear proper clothes though!). Consider cycling from Westport to Achill on the Greenway if you have time (there are lots of services to bring you one way and take take your bike back for you, http://www.greenway.ie/)  Go see Loop Head south of Enistymon, that's well out of the way but easy to get to and spectacular.  If you want really wild see if the boats are running to the Skellig Islands. Info on pretty much everything I've mentioned is on the Wild Atlantic Way website or easily Googled."

I've looked most everything up that you've pointed out and it fits my goals for this trip perfectly. In all my searching around for cool sights I never saw anything about the Wild Atlantic Way, so grateful you made me aware of it!  I'm very glad it's off peak season as well as I do not want to have to make solid plans and rush myself if I like one area in particular and want to hang around longer. Thank you so much for all the wonderful info, this has really helped me wrap my head around the trip and figure out where to begin the journey! Thank you! :)"
solotravel,3djnza,Cilo59,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:56 2015 UTC,"Not a problem, happy to help. Ask more questions if you need.  Just to add, Kilkenny is a famous medieval city with great atmosphere and good nightlife. It's a popular visitor destination but don't let that put you off, it's popular for good reason. Remember cities and towns are small here by US standards, Kilkenny is a city but a very small and accessible one. You could always skip it and go straight to the coast but it's well worth a visit. It's an easy drive on a major road from Dublin airport and you should make sure your first drive here is short as you'll be jetlagged and a bit thrown by the different roads. The above route is what I would suggest to anyone who wants a  really classic intro to Ireland.  One possible diversion is to visit the Aran Islands off the Clare coast, you can grab a foot ferry from Doolin.  Achill Island has a bridge so you can drive on to it. Make sure you go to Keem beach at the very end of the island.  Just take your time, don't try to get everywhere, I suggest. The west coast will tend to be windy and often rainy, it's the Atlantic sea, bring good outdoor gear, but it won't be very cold.  In towns like Galway, Kilkenny, Dingle, Killarney, Kinsale and Westport just walking around in the evening and popping into pubs will be very enjoyable. Often the more old-fashioned and scruffy looking the pub, the better. They can be pretty quiet early in the evening and will warm up later on. Pubs here can be busier than American bars, a popular pub will have standing-room only. Pay at the bar when you order your drink, we don't have tabs unless you're having a meal. The majority of pubs these days serve food.  Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin will have lots of medieval history. Look for a walking tour or do a city bus tour, they're excellent for a quick visit.  Top tip for visitors: don't be overly loud and forward with Irish people. We're very friendly but being a little low-key and laidback probably works best. Don't tell people ""Hey, I'm Irish"" if you have Irish heritage, we hear this all the time and it doesn't impress people. Don't be afraid to start talking to people and show an interest in what they're doing, however!"

I've been to Tikal, Takalik Abaj, and some of the other ruins north of Flores. All were pretty awesome. Tikal is pretty touristed in the high season, but not too bad otherwise. Either way you really need several days to do it justice, I had no idea that the site was so massive until I got there. Bring comfortable shoes, water, and sun protection. I've also heard good things about the other Mayan ruins in Guatemala and Honduras, and about Zaculeu in particular."

You can stay in places fairly cheap in Cancun, Valladolid, and Merida and from those places go and visit sites. I recommend renting a car, though, because it is the easiest way to get around. If you mean spending $40-50 a day on food that is totally possible. It will be harder to do when you factor in hotel, gas, and site admission fees. But if you double your budget I promise you that it will be an amazing experience.  Recommended sites:  Coba  Uxmal  Chichen Itza - the busiest one, but well worth it. Try and get there super early in the morning  Ek' Balam - lost a hat there when I climbed to the top  Mayapan - the successor to Chichen Itza. It was abandoned in 1480. Some Maya still remembered living there when the Spanish showed up in the 1520s.  Izamal - huge platform pyramid nestled in the middle of town. Apparently the nunnery was built out a platform pyramid just as large as the surviving one  Acanceh - Amazing stucco masks. The ticket guy and I talked for an hour about Maya archaeology  Kabah) - tons of Chaac masks on the walls a huge reconstructed arch that marked the beginning/end of a sakbe  Sayil - Amazing Puuc-style architecture. There are a string of smaller sites past Sayil that are worth checking out  Dzibilchaltun  Cozumel - if you want an island vacation and don't want to visit many sites  Chacchoben - if you want to go further south into Quintana Roo  Smaller sites  Labna  Ake - it has a hall of columns like Tula and Chichen Itza. It's nestled in a small town  Oxkintok  Chunchucmil  Chacmultun  Kiuic  Xlapak  If you go to Merida you can check out their wonderful new museum Gran Museo del Mundo Maya"

Last time I was there, I think I spent about $200 over 3 days, which included transportation there and back. I recommend getting a 1 week unlimited subway pass, you can get pretty much anywhere worth going on the subway.  There are a lot of free ways to spend time in New York. Tons of parks and cool neighborhoods to walk around. As for neighborhoods, Astoria and Williamsburg. As for parks, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Socrates Sculpture Park, and the High Line. For a great view for cheap, walk across the Williamsburg Bridge at night. The Brooklyn Bridge is more popular, but IMO it's kind of a clusterfuck.  Food is probably going to be a little pricier than what you're used to, but it'll only get out of hand if you go to fancy restaurants or eat in Midtown Manhattan.  As for safety, I've been to NYC quite a few times, never feared for my safety. But I will say, in Penn Station, there are tons of people who will ask you for money. Just say ""sorry"" and walk away. And in Times Square, there are tons of people who try to scam tourists. One big one is guys who claim to be an aspiring musician, hand you a CD, then badger you for money."

I'd advise against trying to get into the city and risk missing your flight.  IST is a big airport and there are things you can do there to keep busy.    Istanbul is safe so you don't need to worry about that.  I typically wouldn't leave any airport for a layover under 10 hours  (unless its a smaller airport such as CGN)."

solotravel,3dicce,KAMFlamenco,5,Thu Jul 16 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, Balkan. Good for you. This is going to be the highlights of your trip! I am only going to give you a few tips, because once there you will pick up so much.  For Albania, I have been to those two destinations. Apart from the castle in Shkoder, not much to do there. Tirana, also not so much to do. I think in Albania you want to visit some small villages, for example Berat. That is a small valley village with mountains all around it and dotted with churches. There is a great hostel there, one of the best I have ever been to. It is very cozy and hospitable.  Why not go from Albania into Macedonia, before entering Bulgaria? You can visit Ohrid lake there. It is fairly straight forward to get from Berat to here, you take a bus that drops you off at the border and then negotiate a taxi at the Macedonian side. Around Ohrid lake is a beautiful historical town and not far away, there is Monastery of one of the great Orthodox saints, where all the pea cocks live. Is is a must to go there.  Skopje is an interesting city in many ways. It is reinventing its history which is clearly visible in the whole city centre. Buildings, statues, bridges etc, maybe a bit more extravagant than necessary all new built made to look old. But wait, theres more. They do have an actual old town which is great for day time as well as your night time food and drinks. Lots of commerce going on here. Here is also an old fortress and a big mosque. There are quite a few interesting museums in Skopje. There is a hostel just a tiny bit out of the centre which is great.  From Skopje, you can head into Bulgaria. Go to Sofia only to get out. This is a city of acquired taste and lots of patience to learn to love. If you dont want to be a part of that, buy a ticket to Plovdiv immediately. Plovdiv, Veliko Tarnovo, or Varna, are all towns I recommend higher than staying in Sofia longer than necessary. You can go to small villages too like Melnik close to the Greek border but I guess that would be out of the way. Anyway, Bulgaria is a stunning beauty and a very interesting place to be... once you get out of Sofia. Sofia is also cool but for a short visit its not worth it.  Seeing as how you are moving from Sofia to Istanbul, you could go to Plovdiv and then spend some time on the coast, before heading to Istanbul and depending the time of year.  I hope you consider my advise. The Balkans will prove to be the best time of your whole trip.  Edit: I see now Macedonia was already included in the itinerary."

solotravel,3difnj,MaybeUppsala,2,Thu Jul 16 19:05:02 2015 UTC,So did I. I booked my flight on Norwegian Air. When are you going?

solotravel,3difnj,ConvertsToMetric,2,Thu Jul 16 19:17:59 2015 UTC,That's the one! I can still go to work on Thursday and fly out at night. I'm going to aim to be at JFK around 9pm. Figure that gives me plenty of time to go through check-in and TSA.

I recommend gong paddle boarding there, it's just $12 for an hour."
solotravel,3ditj3,EndlessIntermission,3,Thu Jul 16 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"Well, using skyscanner and picking a random date, you could be in Edinburgh by 08:10 and fly back at 20:55, so even checking in a couple of hours before, you've still got pretty much a 09:00 to 18:00 day in Edinburgh.  That's not really Scotland, but with so little time, you'ld be pushing it to go much further afield.  You could hire a car and see a bit more.  But really, worth it? Opportunity cost of what you could do in London?  Up to you."

solotravel,3ditj3,SuperFunk3000,2,Thu Jul 16 20:05:03 2015 UTC,"The train might be the easiest, the journey is around five hours from London. Flying might be shorter but you have to get to the airport, wait in departures etc. Honestly, Scotland probably isn't worth going to just for the day, considering how long it takes to get there. There's plenty of places much closer to London worth seeing like Norfolk, Brighton, Cambridge or Oxford, that take relatively little time to get to and are really interesting to visit. Although if you really want to go I would suggest staying overnight, otherwise you'll just be rushed."
solotravel,3ditj3,moatilliatta22,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:44:42 2015 UTC,Thanks. What are the best ways to get to places like Oxford or Brighton? Are there direct trains from London?
solotravel,3ditj3,PhotoJim99,3,Thu Jul 16 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"Brighton's a worthwhile day trip (I went there in May that way).  There's a fair bit to do there and the train trip is about 45 minutes, and if you book it in advance, it's cheap.  You can add a bus pass to your train ticket for a couple of quid, or just walk around the city.  I'm not sure I'd have done it if it hadn't been out second London trip already, but it was nice to see other parts of England besides the part inside the M25."

solotravel,3ditj3,PhotoJim99,3,Thu Jul 16 23:20:36 2015 UTC,"Never been to York, but Brighton doesn't feel like any American city.  To be fair it does have the kitschy boardwalk, but it's English kitschy, not American kitschy.

solotravel,3ditj3,PhotoJim99,2,Fri Jul 17 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"You can get almost anywhere in England by train from London. Brighton is a direct train, you can get it from plenty of stations in London.

Most countries officially won't allow entry to anyone who doesn't have an onward ticket (Colombia is one of these countries, as are all of the others on your list). How strictly that is enforced will depend on the particular customs officer that you encounter.  This is also enforced by airlines too. They may not let you travel if you don't fit the requirements to enter the country where you're headed to. They enforce it because if you're denied entry then it's the airline that has to bear the cost of flying you back.  I definitely recommend buying a refundable flight back out of Colombia before you set off."

Try to learn some spanish before coming though because people from small towns are very unlikely to be fluent in any language other than spanish.

While the Amazon is just dense jungle where you won't really see much wildlife (although you'll definitely hear it!), the Pantanal is more of an open landscape where animals either are drawn to water holes or trapped on islands, depending on the season. Either way, you'll easily spot lots and lots of animals.  While the most convenient way to see the Pantanal is in Brazil (Cuiaba is the best airport to fly into), you can definitely see it in Bolivia as well. Just travel towards the eastern border against Brazil, and you'll find several options. Accommodation and food may be rather rustic, but it'll be a really good experience anyway."

You may want to spend a bit longer on Amsterdam and Paris, but Ghent and Brugge can be done in a day for both, if you rush things a bit. My travel estimates by train are:   Amsterdam - Ghent : 3h20 Ghent - Brugge: 1h10 Brugge -Paris: 4h   In 1) I am not sure if you have a direct train or if you'd need to change at Antwerp.

You start to see what makes travel stressful and what makes it not stressful and surprise NOT having someone else to worry about makes it a lot easier.     Why do you want to see japan?  That answer should be more than enough for you to buy a ticket... from there just get on the plane and go see that thing you want to see.

Try staying in a social hostel so you have some people to talk to about all the mindblowing craziness around you!   It's very easy in terms of being safe, getting great food and having cool experiences and at the same time a bit challenging since everything is in Japanese and quite different from what you're used to. That to me makes it the perfect place to start. Breathe in, breathe out, focus on the fact that you really, really, really want to see Japan (otherwise you wouldn't post here) and that you'll always regret it if you don't go just because you're a bit scared.

solotravel,3ddxbg,Nomad_88,5,Fri Jul 17 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"Went there last year, but was only there about 2 days before heading to Chiang Mai.  The main tip for Tuk Tuks (that we quickly discovered) was to make sure you ask for it with no stops, so don't always take the very cheapest option. Otherwise we got taken to shops we were meant to go into (and hopefully buy things) so that the driver got some fuel voucher. We didn't want that as we went in one, left straight away and the driver got annoyed - so would rather pay a little extra to go direct.   Also speaking English was fine everywhere, and pretty easy to get around - subway, overground train, taxi, boats, tuk tuks. Used them all without any problem. If you have a smartphone I'd also recommend the CityMaps2Go app and download the Bangkok/Thailand map (works offline, and with your phones GPS to show where you are). Since discovering that I've used it everywhere I've travelled. And travelling around Thailand (at least to Chiang Mai and Laos border from my experience) was easy.  Since I was only in Bangkok a short time I went to the main attractions: Khao San Road, Wat Arun, Reclining Buddha, Royal Palace. All good but quite busy (was there in mid-August). Also tried to get to The Golden Mount, but arrived too late. And didn't have time to get to the Floating Markets which also looked interesting. Maybe a day trip to Ayutthaya might also be cool.  And I was travelling with someone else who wanted to see the red light district from The Hangover 2, so went to Soi Cowboy and Patpong. Didn't actually go into any of the places or shows (not really my thing and felt a bit dodgy going into the shows having read some things about it - unless we weren't in a great area), but maybe worth a visit if you're into that."
solotravel,3ddxbg,Im_not_lonely,2,Wed Jul 15 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"Avoid the shows.   They are rip offs and honeslty kind of gross.   There will be dudes in the red light district that try and take you to a ""really cool bar"" or ""a place with cheap drinks""  AVOID these dudes as well.   They will take you to some hole in the wall place and be very pushy about you taking a girl home.   Fuck that noise.  If you walk around the red light areas (which cmon who wouldnt) only talk to other foreigners, although many of them are there with a mission, or girls with good english.  The men in these areas are pimps and criminals."

Spend a day on the river there is a river pass you can get from the MRT/BRT station there at the river where you can use the ferry for like 400 baht all day.    Get on or off at any stop.  Along the river is where you will find all the temples and cool stuff.  If you go to some of them you will be the only westerner around (wear a collared shirt if you go to temples)  There are two wakeboarding parks a little outside the city (about a 8/12 dollar cab ride) that are worth checking out if you are into wake boarding.    The night life is cool  I think RCA was the place I went and had a great time meeting REAL thai girls (not bar girls)   I met one who liked me so much she showed me around town for the rest of my trip and would not let me pay for anything.   She is still in my top ten for futures wives.   If you are there for a week stop by a tailor on your first day to get fitted for a custom suit (about 200 american) and some fitted dress shirts (about 20 american) that look AMAZING.  The should be ready in about 3 days for a second fitting/ alterations then you bring it home with you on the 5th day.  You can get a whole wardrobe custom made for less than half what you would pay in the states for off the rack shit.    Check Couchsurfing.com for events I met up with a group that did some bike riding in Bangkachoy (Spelling?) its this town outside the city that has these really cool raised sidewalks.

solotravel,3deisi,Drunk_Logicist,6,Wed Jul 15 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sitting in a hostel in my last stop of a 9 week trip and I felt that way all day of travel yesterday. Going back 7 time zones did not help either. Anyway, the first night I spent alone in a hostel back in May, I was with a guy on his last night heading home for the first time in 2.5 years. What he told me was whenever he left and moved on someplace he'd get a feeling in his stomach. I couldn't place the feeling at that point, but whenever I do leave a city or enter a new one, I have such a wide range of emotions. Butterflies, anxiety, excitement, heartbreak, sadness, extreme joy. Once I'm settled at a place, I shower and try and meet people or reflect on where I've been or how I felt. Give it a day max and you should be relaxed and all your worries will be an after thought. Until the cycle repeats. You've got the ""feeling"" as I like to call it now, and it's something I think many people will get, part of what makes it such a cool experience. It's cool to connect with another you, because it can feel exhilarating.  Of course, enjoy the hell out of your trip, you're going to have a blast. I've yet to meet people in hostels who weren't extremely friendly, just don't be afraid to reach out. Cheers!"

solotravel,3dc4i8,deanestyle,15,Wed Jul 15 02:56:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. In the summer of 2005 I was backpacking Europe. Started out with mum and sister, then just sister, then I was supposed to head to Poland and Hungary on my own.   However, the day after I arrived in London was the day of the bombings. My primary reason to go to Poland at that time was to visit Auschwitz. I was incredibly shaken up by the bombings, and decided I didn't need any more emotional challenges that trip. I ended up booking an earlier flight home.   Don't regret it. I needed home at that time. I've since finished the last leg of that trip and have actually been back to Poland again!"
solotravel,3dc4i8,the_hardest_part,13,Wed Jul 15 06:41:39 2015 UTC,"The first major trip I went on when I was 20 I cut short, but not for my own reasons. I went to NZ with my then girlfriend and we were WWOOFING throughout the two islands. We had planned to stay for 5-6 months. After 3 months everything is going well but my GF is running low on money, she never budgeted herself and just spent money left and right. She always wanted to eat out, take a taxi instead of walking a few miles, and stay in hotels from time to time instead of hostels when we were not WWOOFing. So after about 3 months she is almost out of money and we had not booked a return flight home yet, so I used mostly my money and what was left of hers, and bought two plane tickets back to the US. I really regret leaving early, there was alot of the South Island we did not get to see and I sometimes think back and wish I could have stayed longer. A funny side note: We were planning our trip during the summer beginning in the month of May, she figured that we would be there for summer so she should bring along 3 bathing suits to hit up the beaches. She did not realize that NZ coldest months are June July and August, so she had to buy new warmer clothes when we got there."

solotravel,3dc4i8,Vroonkle,7,Wed Jul 15 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"this is a complicated one, and often down to specific circumstances.   for example when talking to people about this subject I've noticed the following:  people who have returned home ahead of schedule due to a family emergency, dying relative etc ,don't regret it.   people who have returned home because they became ""overwhelmed"" or weren't having a good time because things weren't exactly as they imagined seem to have a bit of a grass is greener approach, its not so great as they through on their trip, all of a sudden home seems like the most place amazing. usually they are quite happy to return home.  there is a group of people who just decide they've had enough for this trip and want to go home, continue other stuff or regroup (if they've had a stressful time or long term travel just isn't for them) , these people are usually the least ""regretful"" of ending their trip early.  the people that seem to suffer the most regret are the people that have cut short their trip due to some person / OS / travel buddy (either with them on the trip or back home) wanting or guilting them into coming home / ending their trip early. people who have found themselves in this situation are almost always the most regretful. especially if the relationship breaks up not to long after the trip ends.   as for how its works out , pretty much, you get home, the initial buzz of being home wears off once you've met all your friend and family again, not much has changed, life goes on.  EDIT: clarification."
solotravel,3dc4i8,onwardtraveller,4,Wed Jul 15 04:23:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, this hits home. I'm in Malta right now. I got here yesterday, after 13 days in Denmark visiting my friend who I met when she exchanged to America during my junior year. My other best friend, from America, came with me since she was also very close to our Danish friend.   The first 4 days I was in Denmark consisted of me throwing up a lot and crying. At first I thought I was just sick, but I realized it was homesickness and anxiety.  I couldn't eat or really do anything. I booked an earlier flight home, totally skipping Malta. Once I had a flight home booked, I felt WAY better and I started to have the time of my life in Denmark.   Cut to the day before I was supposed to fly home. I felt a ton better and didn't want to leave. Somehow, my parents were encouraging me to stay. Sooooo, I cancelled my early flight home, stayed in Denmark the whole 2 weeks and eventually went to Malta.  Once I got here though, I just kinda broke down. I am very homesick and out of my element. I don't feel unsafe or anything, I just have a burning desire to go home. Actually, at this point, I'd rather go back to Denmark than home. I guess I am just not good at being alone.   The anxiety is so bad. I have college coming up weeks after I get home, and that big change scares me so I just want to enjoy my home life before I move across the country.  After a day on Malta I knew I couldn't stay the whole week. I booked a flight home for tomorrow morning, and honestly I don't regret it. I feel HORRIBLE that I'm not having as much fun as I know I should. I'm in one of the coolest places ever. I'm mad that I won't get to swim in the Med despite this being my like, 4th trip on the Mediterranean. But I'm happy to be going home. Totally a bitch move, but I did what I felt like I had to do. I got to see Valletta, tour the hypogeum, see the church...The novelty of being able to buy alcohol has totally worn off already anyway.   This is very jumbled but so am I right now. Just a lot of feelings. Guilt and sadnesses I guess.   Tl;DR: Went to Denmark, freaked, booked a super early flight home. Felt way better after booking flight home, cancelled it and decided to stay. Had SO MUCH FUN. Flew to Malta. Had breakdown. Booked early flight home. Sticking with it.   SUPER Tl;DR: I'm a bitch."

solotravel,3dc4i8,misskinky,3,Thu Jul 16 13:08:18 2015 UTC,Definitely. Most days I wish I never came back home.
solotravel,3dc4i8,atorr,2,Wed Jul 15 03:21:26 2015 UTC,On many of my trips I've consider going home early because I'm a very pessimistic person. If things aren't going my way I'm always tempted to throw in the towel and give in. I often find it hard to see past something bad...if I have a few bad days in a row I'll all of a sudden decide my whole trip will be shit.  My first trip away from home was to volunteer in America doing conservation work. I was struggling with things mentally at the time but was also really dehydrated on my first day. My supervisor took me to the side and basically said he thought I was lazy and not working hard enough. I just wanted to cry and go home. But eventually I decided to try and change his mind and stuck at it. In the end it was one of the best summers of my life. I made great friends and really challenged myself.  A few years later I went to Canada to meet some online friends and it was a disaster. I was suffering badly from anxiety at the time and essentially I had a breakdown abroad. My friends got sick of me (not surprising as I was having a breakdown) and basically said they wanted me to leave. I could have stuck around for 2 weeks in a hostel alone but I was completely lost and in no mind to travel so I took the next flight home. I was happy to go home early as I had totally lost the plot.  I don't regret it because that was the only thing I could have done at the time. I needed to go home to get myself together. If I ever want to go back I can do there's no regrets there. Obviously my case is quite unique so going home was the best thing to do for me mentally.

I was very disappointed and I still consider it somewhat of a personal failure for not budgeting better. I had to return due to money troubles (partially due to ridiculous bank fees, I lost over $200) but also some personal issues that made the trip extremely stressful and hard to enjoy. But I'm grateful that I was able to stay for the time I did, and I'm more prepared for next time. It's a learning experience."

solotravel,3ddx6w,Mwenkapab,2,Wed Jul 15 14:48:13 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on what to do in Thailand or Seychelles but as for layover exploring, 4 hours is not enough time. If your plane lands at say 12:00, by the time you get off the plane,clear customs and get your baggage, it's going to be closer to 1:00.   Now if your next flight is in a different country to where you are currently, you will have to go back through security/customs/check your bag and get to your gate. Depending on how busy the airport is, that could take at least another hour or 2 to be safe. I have stood in line for more than 3 hours on occasion. That pretty much leaves you with an hour max to do some exploring. If the airport is not right near anything you'd want to see in that hour, it's not really worth it. I would say you'd want to have a min 6-7hr+ layover to make it worth leaving the airport.   I recently booked a ticket from Toronto to Auckland. I noticed that some flights do a layover in Fiji, so i then looked into 2 flights, one from Toronto to Fiji and one from Fiji to Auckland 2 days later. The difference in price was ~$250. If you have the time/money, book your flight a day early and spend a night in SK if its something you really want to see. When else could you visit SK for a night for only a couple hundred dollars."

But it's a place very few people travel solo to, because the possibilities for hooking up with others aren't that great there. It's a couples destination, so you'd be surrounded by them most of the time. Some people find that sort of depressing.  Thailand, on the other hand, is a great place for solo traveling, and you'll get much better value for your money, both when it comes to accommodation, food and activities.

The islands around Phuket are gorgeous though- but of course if you're on a budget, it will be more expensive to get to them.

No problems taking taxis and ferries, and English was more than enough to get by in every situation. Phuket itself is a very established tourist destination in Thailand, which has its pros and cons. It may have its tacky moments and it may not be the most authentic in terms of Thai culture, but its extremely lively and really easy to meet other travelers. Phuket was my first destination in SEA and imo it was a great introduction to travel - still pretty wild and exciting, but well trodden enough that getting around was easy.  Some recommendations: Spend at least part of your time (we spent the majority) on Ko Phi Phi. The island is beautiful, and there's plenty of opportunities to hit up beaches, go kayaking and explore both the resort and residential sides of the island. Depending on your scene, there's really nice hostels right on the beach that throw wild parties at night (think fire dancers, drunk people jumping through flaming hoops kind of parties). In other places it can be quieter though.  On the larger island, there is a particular company that runs sea kayaking day-trips. I know it's expensive but I heard good things from friends. There's also another company that offers half-day boat trips to some pretty scenic islands, one of which which is known as ""James Bond Island"" (you can google it). There's more on the central island to see... I know there's a giant buddha that some friends went to see.  Patong is the tourist capital on the main island, and I definitely found that it leaned moreso toward the sleazy side of Thailand tourism (just my opinion). If you're looking for neon-lit streets, lots of drunk foreigners, lady-boys, the infamous ping-pong shows and an extremely blatant sex-trade, that's your place. Despite this less-than-favourable description, I would still say it's worth checking out for some amount of time. It has a certain ""so tacky I can't look away"" feel to it that is worth at least a day.  Hope that helps. Writing all this brings up lots of good memories from that trip. I was a pretty inexperienced traveler back then too. If you end up going, two pieces of advice: you WILL be bombarded by taxi drivers when you first arrive (do some homework but don't beat yourself up if you're scammed a little), and the cost of the relatively cheap drinks in Thailand does add up in the end!  Hope that helps, send me a message if you have any other questions."

But as long as you avoid places (ex, Phuket, Bali, Ha Long bay..etc) that are crowded by western tourists you should be ok.

solotravel,3dbt89,foggysf,5,Wed Jul 15 03:23:06 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine if you can book a few days ahead. If not, you'll just end up staying at slightly less popular places. Since it's the high season even the less popular places will have people to meet so I personally wouldn't sweat it.  Hostels at some of the REALLY popular destinations will fill up faster, particularly around Xmas and New years, so I usually plan on going to somewhere less popular around that time."

Anyone in the UK is eligible for a VISA waiver. http://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program  It should allow you to get entry to the US for up to 90 days unless you have violated any US visa laws which if you haven't been here before is unlikely.  90 days should be enough for you to do whatever you want.  Just remember if you leave the US and come back your 90 days won't reset.  It appears the fee is $14, which isn't much."

What i would recommend to you is to book yourself a bicycle tour in every city you visit, it's a great way to see a lot of the major sites in one day.   Also, look into buying a jrail pass, they're pretty heavily discounted to what you would pay if you buy your tickets individually. Mine cost just over $600cdn for a 3 week pass. For instance, the shinkansen from tokyo to kyoto is about $80cdn each way, so if you're taking the bullet trains between destinations and taking the LRT in the cities you visit, you can save a lot.   I think you can also buy multiple passes as well, as they have a set amount of time in which to be activated, but they only activate on your first use of said pass.

solotravel,3dd9fd,_ThisKid_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:27:44 2015 UTC,"How much would a bicycle your cost? One of the tours I seen cost around €80 which I though was pretty expensive!    That was about the price i paid for each bike tour. When i rented a bike it was 1000 yen per day. Next time i go i plan on buying a bike for most of my transportation needs. You can take your bike on the train as well, but you need to tear it down a bit and put it in a ""bike bag"". Check out this website, you can buy nice used bikes for 5000 to 15000 yen. Their website says they buy bikes so i'm curious if i can buy a bike from them, use it while i'm in Japan, and then have them buy it back from me for a portion of the purchase price.    http://www.rakuten.co.jp/hashimoto/   I was planning on staying in each city I go To for a week but started thinking that a rail pass may be good because I could really jut take the train when I wanted within the time frame. I was thinking of spending a week in say Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nara but think I may be better of with a railroads for that time to visit the other places near them?    I think the rail pass is a really good way to get around, if you can work your timing right (for instance iirc, you'll be in tokyo the first two weeks, and last two weeks so no pass needed). Look into the prices of the rail passes, you can see the cost of the individual train rides between cities, that way you can work out if buying the pass is cheaper than the tickets on their own. I will probably buy tickets instead of the rail pass next time i go because i'll be using my bike for most of my transport. You should have no problem just showing up at the station to get on a train, they run all the time, i'd say you might have to wait 30-45 mins at most.   What is hostel availability like in Japan? Would you need to book in advance or could you just walk in and get a bed/room?   When i went we didn't stay in hostels, it seemed that the average price for a hostel was around 2500-3000yen per night. I went with 2 other people so we ended up renting apartments for 5500-7000 yen per night, less than a hostel and you get your own place. I'm currently looking on airbnb for places to stay while there, you can get a room (sometimes just a bed) in someone's house for 1400-3000 yen per night. In my experience, security/safety of your possessions is not a problem, you can trust to leave your stuff somewhere and know it will be there when you get back. Go to a mall to see this in action hahaha.   Also if we are both in japan at the same time I would be open to meeting up, would be pretty cool!   Looks like i'm going to be there after you're gone, flying into NRT on Oct26th."
solotravel,3dd9fd,_ThisKid_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:24:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply!   How were the bike tours? I think that seems a little pricey considering it may only be 1-2 hours. Are they quick trips or do they last a while? Can you rent bikes in every big city like Kyoto, Tokyo and Osaka or would that be Tokyo only?   I was thinking of a rail pass, it would give me a bit more freedom to go where I want without having to stick to a certain route or time schedule. I'm going to be there 2 months alone so I'm going to try see as much as I can! Are the bullet trains included in the use of the railpass?   Looks like i'm going to be there after you're gone, flying into NRT on Oct26th.   That's unfortunate since I'll be flying home on the 6th! I hope you have a fantastic trip though!"
solotravel,3dd9fd,kitt-cat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:26:42 2015 UTC,"The bike tours are way longer than a couple hours, more like meet at 8am and bike around the city until around 4-5pm. You'll make a couple stops along the way to eat and take pictures too. As far as renting a bike, i can only really speak for tokyo, however i'm sure the are places to rent bikes in osaka, kyoto etc... You might even be able to rent a bike right from one of the tour operators.  Yes! The rail pass works for the bullet trains, if i remember right, there are 5 different types of bullet train, the pass lets you use 3 of the 5. I'm not sure what the difference is of the other 2, but they may be a direct train. The trains we went on between tokyo-osaka, had 2-3 stops in between."
solotravel,3dd9fd,_ThisKid_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:33:46 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend using [helpx](helpx.net) to find places to get free accommodation. You just work a few hours a day. I definitely recommend Yuta's language cafe, it's in the heart of Tokyo. I met a lot of friends there that I'm going to meet in Germany later this year :) You can easily get a paying job somewhere else if you can speak English also by the way. There's various other hosts from around Japan  and I definitely recommend you check the website out!  For transportation, try your hardest not to use taxis because they are ridiculously expensive. Trains and the subway are super cheap. There's one streetcar in Tokyo and it's more than a train but cheaper than a bus. Hitch hiking isn't a viable option in Japan. I definitely recommend looking into a JRail pass. You can only get then in your country of residence so you won't be able to get it once you've left.  There's a ton of crazy restaurants I would recommend. Definitely go to a cat cafe (or a variant like a goat cafe in Shibuya or a rabbit cafe or reptile or owl, they're super cool). They have various anime themed cafes.  For places to see, I can only speak for Tokyo, but I recommend seeing or going to: Tokyo Government Metropolitan building (save yourself the $40 from going up the Tokyo Sky Tree and get the same view that is literally just two feet shorter), Shimokitazawa (the grown up more tame version of Harajuku, there's a ton of thrift shops here), Meiji Shrine (huge and awesome), Kabukicho (entertainment and red light spot of Shinjuku. I saw quite a few celebrities here but I have no idea who they were haha), Golden Gai (Japanese people have a different name for it so if you're lost you can't ask for it under that name. It's a tiny bar district with six seater bars, it can get pretty cozy there. Fun fact: you can bargain at these bars but you have to be super polite and tactful about it to get rid of the table fee), Aoigahara (Also known as the Suicide Forest, you'll get a weird fever and feel really sleepy after you're in that area for a few hours, it's weird but definitely worth a look. Busses from here can be quite expensive. My friend and I went and it cost us $40 for transportation alone!), and Nakano Broadway (gatcha pon heaven, place of useless but crazy nicknacks, anime paradise, and an ice cream shop that sells crazy ice cream flavours and ice cream cones that are a foot and a half tall. Crazy good stuff here).   Things to watch out for: Bars and izakaya almost always have a table fee that can range from ¥300 to ¥1500 (but the average seems to be about ¥800) and it will almost never be posted!! I find this is the case especially in higher end izakaya so be super careful about it and ask your server or the people behind the counter. Especially ask if you're in Golden Gai."

I'm just wondering since I'll be on a temp visitor visa and technically not allowed work?   I'll check out all the cafés, the sound pretty interesting! Maybe not the cat style but reptile and the others sound like they would be worth a visit. What is the language cafe like? A place where a lot of travellers visit or just a general mix of people?   Trains seem to be the best way to get around from what I've seen and they seem to nearly cost as much as here in Ireland! A lot of people have been making parts of japan out to be more expensive than it seems to be. Taxis seem crazily expensive though €100+ for 30 minutes in a taxi just doesn't seem right!   I'll definitely add those districts/sites in Tokyo to my list! They sound like they would be worth a visit while I'm there, I only have a few specific places I want to visit so I'm open to try anywhere."
solotravel,3dd9fd,jceez,2,Thu Jul 16 07:42:22 2015 UTC,"Japan is nowhere near as expensive as people think it is, i think that's an old stereotype that's still hanging on. Don't get me wrong, you can spend a lot of money in Japan, but you can do that anywhere.  Quick run down:  Drinks in vending machines 100-120 yen Ramen or rice bowls with meat 450-900 yen I ate 14 plates of sushi at a sushi go round for like 1800 yen In fact the most expensive (and delicious) place i ate at in Japan was a all beef place where we had a 5 course meal and a beer for 8000 yen each.  Oh, and eat the fast food (McD's,BK ETC...) the difference in the food quality is mind blowing 100 yen shops are a godsend for little things (umbrellas, fabric bags for your laundry, sewing kits etc...) Get familiar with your local Don Quixote store, lots of stuff can be had for a decent price there (like large hardcase luggage for 6500yen) the locals call the place ""Don-Key""."

solotravel,3d85pf,middlemank,29,Tue Jul 14 06:53:13 2015 UTC,It's late so I'm not going to type a lot now but I can respond more tomorrow. I spent 6 months in Southeast Asia. Not as much as Europe. Southeast Asia is just purely awesome. Easiest place to backpack prob in the world. It's like backpacking in Europe except you're rich. Money can buy anything. Locals are amazing. Nightlife is phenomenal. Food is to die for. In Southeast Asia I was a king. In Europe I was a poor backpacker. For example. In Asia you can spend like $5 and get a decent dorm room in a hostel or you can pay maybe $10 and get your own private room upstairs with a king sized bed. In Europe I was paying like $40 for ok dorms. Beers are always a dollar. Foods always a few bucks. Transportation is simple. You see things you won't see anywhere else. Europe is a different awesome. Asia is like a dream. If you spend 20 bucks at a bar you're basically balling out.  Its just amazing.
solotravel,3d85pf,Vagablogged,12,Tue Jul 14 07:08:39 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention if you're white they will try rip you off no matter what, they are ruthless but you have to be ruthless back. It's just the way it is. As long as you go there with an idea of how much everything should cost you should be able to get it at a cheap price. Even while you're there you'll get an idea how much everything should cost for a tourist.   It's also safer than Europe, left $10k worth of camera gear in a backpackers waiting to check out for 12hrs and nothing happened, put that shit on buses and it didn't go missing. Spoke to some polish girl who was hitchhiking through Asia and said she wouldn't do this back in Europe, she was pretty ballsy, took free lifts for hours on end and she's still alive aha.  In some places you are going to get sick of the locals as they just pester you to buy shit and after a while it gets fucking annoying. But then again you'll meet locals who are friendly AF. Went hiking up a mountain in Vietnam and the domestic travellers were super friendly and wanted nothing in return.  It's awesome fun, take it as it comes and go with the flow. (I booked flights to Laos and departure from Cambodia, travelled three countries with no itinerary and nothing booked) I used booking.com to pick up $10 hotel rooms but you can also use it to get $5 or less backpacker rooms or there's another site or two for backpacking. Or just rock up and book when you arrive, with guest houses you can usually bargain and they are friendly."
solotravel,3d85pf,I_C_E_D,3,Tue Jul 14 08:28:39 2015 UTC,"No not everybody tries to rip you off. Be cautious when taking a taxi and buying fake brand clothes, merchandise, electronics and stuff. But apart from that, i was never ripped off at the usual daily stuff like public transportation, accommodation and food. Bargaining is something very usual also for locals. And if you are not trying to get like 50% off they are mostly very polite about it, too."
solotravel,3d85pf,DatTommel,4,Tue Jul 14 11:04:39 2015 UTC,Seriously if you can't figure out the people trying to rip you off after a week or 2 you might not be cut out for travelling. It's so obvious. If you meet the locals that aren't on the main street in the city that aren't selling stuff they're some of the nicest people in the world.
solotravel,3d85pf,Vagablogged,2,Tue Jul 14 12:58:03 2015 UTC,"Ah yea, only took a taxi in Vietnam twice and then rode everywhere as for the other countries tuk tuk is the best way aha.   Yea with bargaining I'd offer less than 10% what they asked and from there you can gauge what they're willing to part with, usually you can get 25% of what they want, sometimes they won't budge below 50%  Managed to pay 22500ea to get to the waterfall outside luangprabang mind you there was 9 of us, think the minimum going rate is about 200k kip."
solotravel,3d85pf,I_C_E_D,3,Tue Jul 14 11:19:16 2015 UTC,You were staying in the most expensive hostels and rooms in Europe then. I was paying £8-15 during summer.
solotravel,3d85pf,NihilisticToad,2,Tue Jul 14 10:40:37 2015 UTC,Where? And we're they nice? I know you can find cheap places that's not the point. I'm saying in general it's wayyyyyy cheaper at least compared to western Europe. $25 I would get a luxury hotel suite in Vietnam. $4 I would get a large room with 2 king sized beds in Laos. Italy I was paying $25 for shit.
solotravel,3d85pf,Vagablogged,2,Tue Jul 14 12:55:16 2015 UTC,"All across Europe (Amsterdam, Bruges, Nice, Florence, Rome, Dubrovnik, Split, Mostar, Sarajevo and Budapest and more). Yes they were all nice, I always booked through hostel bookers or hostel world and never stayed at a place with a rating below 75%. I'm not saying that SEA isnt cheaper (I flew to Bangkok after spending a month in Europe and spent 4 months in SEA) but in some places the prices were only 30% cheaper, however, I stayed in some very nice hostels. Thinking about it, I did pay around £17 a night a couple of times in Europe but it was literally a couple of nights at most.  Also, it's worth bearing in mind that at the time of my year and a bit away the dollar was around 1.75 to the pound."
solotravel,3d85pf,NihilisticToad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:28:40 2015 UTC,You're right. I think I only spent 40 in Paris. I also only went to a few countries. But southeast Asia is way cheaper. If you include everything else. Food drinks transportation activities etc. Need a 22 Oz beer at a bar. $1. Dinner $3-$5. Tuk Tuk or scooter for the day $1-$5. A round of drinks in Europe is easily the same cost as a full days spending in SEA.
solotravel,3d85pf,Vagablogged,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:29 2015 UTC,"Yea, for sure man. It's only the hostels that I didn't notice a huge change in, everything else is dirt cheap.

solotravel,3d85pf,NihilisticToad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:31:40 2015 UTC,It depends on the country and city too. In Bangkok I was paying $10 a night. In Vang Vieng I was paying $4 for a huge room with 2 king sized beds for myself.

I do remember Rome being slightly more expensive than some other places, however, it is the capital. Florence wasn't too bad though. I was there is the beginning of July 2013.  It's a pretty cool place, hey. I love the disparate architecture you see in the cities and it's so rich with history (I'm a massive roman history geek)."
solotravel,3d85pf,NihilisticToad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:31:58 2015 UTC,"No kidding, I'm from England. You're still wrong though, even the most expensive country in Europe (Norway) you can find hostels for well under $40. Either you've never traveled Europe or you weren't staying in dorm rooms."
solotravel,3d85pf,NihilisticToad,6,Tue Jul 14 17:05:05 2015 UTC,"I haven't read all the comments but yes I think the biggest difference is the cost is way cheaper in SEA.  Another big difference is public transportation.  Europe is so easy to get around on the trains and buses, especially going from country to country.  It takes much longer to get from country to country overland in SEA.  Of course the distances are different, but going through the borders takes a long time overland like at least a couple hours in my experience.  It usually takes longer than what is told also, it's not horrible it just takes longer but is super cheap.    One other difference I felt also was that Europe was more of a party crowd, I think some of that had to do with bars/clubs staying open way later in Europe.  I felt like SEA was more outdoorsy or active, like go ride an elephant, go kayaking, go to the waterfall.    Anyway I'm not saying one is better than the other, I loved both of my trips and wouldn't hesitate to do either of them again."
solotravel,3d85pf,jmoney425,6,Tue Jul 14 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with Vafablogged, SEA is backpacker Heaven. Most travelers are backpackers, drunk australians, or hippy types. You can spend less that $1000 USD a month without a problem.   You can literally do anything you want for ten bucks. Want to rock climb, go snorkeling, blow up a cow with a rocket launcher, or have an amazing meal? That will be $10.   The locals are usually very friendly. I thought the ones in the Philippines were the nicest.  Last the beaches are the best. Tons of them everywhere and always tons to do."
solotravel,3d85pf,that90sguys,4,Tue Jul 14 15:49:54 2015 UTC,Yup. I found it hard to spend a lot of money. On you want a 3 day cruise everything paid for. That's $40. Oh you want to buy you and 10 of your friends a round of shots. That's $10. 3 days in an elephant camp with camping hiking rafting etc. $30. Rent a scooter for 24 hours. $5.
solotravel,3d85pf,Vagablogged,5,Tue Jul 14 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what's already been mentioned here, but one thing that I'll add is that you shouldn't expect to jump around so quickly from country to country in SE Asia like backpackers tend to do in Europe. SE Asia is a lot more dense, and if you plan on doing all of it in a month or two you're just going to spend all of your time on buses and leave wanting more. Plan a couple weeks to a couple months per country."
solotravel,3d85pf,scott12087,4,Tue Jul 14 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"This is accurate. I read/hear about so many people who go to SEA for 10 days and spend 4 days in Thailand, 3 days in Cambodia and 3 days in Vietnam. It's such a waste of money and traveling time. You need at least 1 day to travel by train or bus to Chiang Mai or the hot spots down south (nearly a full 24 hours including ferry crossings) and Chiang Mai isn't even that far north! You get to see sod all of any of the countries and you're never going to get a feel for the place. You need 2 months minimum (and that's rushing things) to see 3 of the SEA nations. A month in each is the sweet spot, at least it was for me, I was sick of the place after 4 months and couldn't wait to get to oz. I'd still go back in a heartbeat though."
solotravel,3d85pf,NihilisticToad,3,Tue Jul 14 13:02:04 2015 UTC,Agreed. I did 5 countries in SEA in like 6 months. I did 5 countries in Europe in a month.
solotravel,3d85pf,Vagablogged,4,Tue Jul 14 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'm the best person to answer this, but I'm based in SEA and I have a different perspective to offer. Since I feel attached to this region, I generally don't view it as a tourist and I am not too focused on touristy stuff. Sightseeing is all right, but it's rarely been the highlight of my trips.  SEA is my neighborhood. That's been my approach to it, and that may be why I've encountered so much friendliness over the years. Although I do think Southeast Asians are generally friendly folk. I'll add that I'm active in Couchsurfing, and I've been hosted all over the region, or if not, I've been toured and accompanied by awesome CS members.  I've made many connections, and it's often quite easy to do it. I've done stuff like go to some avant-garde art space in a part of Bangkok I don't know, that few tourists venture into. I'd feel lost coz everybody there is Thai. But I bring myself to talk to someone. Soon, I'm being welcomed to a group's table. Conversation isn't easy, but there are laughs and giggles and drinks. It usually goes something like that.  Culture. Some people like temples. They're all right. Not really a huge draw for me. But I like cities. I like to explore them and walk around. It's not any one thing. It's the vibe, it's the bustle of life, it's a myriad chance encounters and discoveries. Art is my area of interest, so I always try to explore a city's art scene. That's why Singapore is so exciting to me, though many travelers don't care for it. SG has been in the middle of taking a stab at becoming the cultural capital of Asia. That would have seemed hubristic 10 years ago, but they've made great strides, and the EU slump has indirectly helped them. Their image hasn't really changed much, but there are things going on in the arts. Manila and Bangkok also have exciting art scenes.  Culture in SEA also takes the form of festivals. There are countless festivals, and they tend to offer grand spectacles and great fun. Quite a broad variety as well.  There's also great variety in nature and adventure attractions. Mountains, volcanoes, caves, waterfalls, lakes, river treks, rapids, cliff diving, rock climbing, surfing, reef dives, marine reserves, mangrove forests, rainforests, hot springs, underground rivers, etc. Islands are amazing.

I went on a trip to malaysia last month for 3 weeks, I was planning on spending all three weeks around the country but spent all my time in Sarawak instead.   Look up Bario if you haven't heard of it. Only accessible by twin otter from Miri airport, only airline that flys there is the MAS subsidiary MASwings. Right up in the Kelabit highlands, very cool temperature ideal for jungle trekking. If you're after getting off the beaten path this is it. The owner of the guesthouse told me they get about 10 tourists a week in the off season. Absolutely fantastic place. You can even to a trek to Kalimantan on the Indonesian side of Borneo, takes about 3 days. Hiring a guide there is easy too. I've actually got the name and number of the guy who took me on a trek and also took my dad on a trek when he went 32 years ago. He's currently the only one in the highlands who can do the trek to Batu Lawi (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukit_Batu_Lawi)"

solotravel,3d85pf,rjowns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"I said a max of 3 months. When you've traveled as long as I have, it blurs. It's a relevant observation. Entitled?

I know where things are. I know what they are selling. Leave me the fuck alone. Circumstances have nothing to do with that. I'm not suddenly going to take up smoking because I'm hassled am I?"
solotravel,3d8ei0,nedhed,34,Tue Jul 14 08:49:37 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice for short term management.  Go have a long nice shower. The rule is you can cry in the shower, but once you get out of the shower you have to stop. Start off with cold water, the cold water will make your sort out your breathing pretty quickly. Then you can have a hot one.  You've obviously got an phone/tablet/laptop with you. Get onto youtube - find a tv show that's familiar and makes you laugh. My go to ones are Big Bang Theory and Friends especially bloopers. Watch for 10/15/20 minutes - however long it takes to distract you from your thoughts and make you laugh.  Head down to the lobby. Most hostels offer walking tours or other organised activities. Sign up for something tomorrow. Have a chat with those people.  Go ask someone for a recommendation for a close restaurant/take away or have a google. Work out where you're going to go before you leave the hostel. Just have something small.  Make a plan for tomorrow. What time are you going to wake up. What are you going to do. Where are you going to go. You don't have the plan the entire day, but have something that goes ""wake up at 8am, shower, breaky and leave at 9:30am to go to such and such museum"" or whatever.   Is there a common room/tv room in your hostel? Grab a book and/or your phone/tablet/laptop and something to drink (your choice) and just go sit. Up to you if you want to chat with people or not. Put some headphones in and listen to some favourite music whilst planning tomorrow.   You will be fine."
solotravel,3d8ei0,cupp95,2,Tue Jul 14 11:43:41 2015 UTC,"This is great advice and exactly what I do in similar situations. To calm yourself down mid-attack try this: breath in and out, slow and deep, and imagine that with each breath you are drawing one side of a square. You had a rough landing but you tonight or tomorrow, you can get out there and do some exploring  One other thing- I hate meeting new people and putting pressure on myself to make friends in hostels makes me feel awkward and dampens my whole trip. Signing up for group stuff is a great idea if you want to meet people, but explore solo if you're more comfortable on your own."
solotravel,3d8ei0,-goodgodlemon-,-19,Tue Jul 14 23:41:47 2015 UTC,Disagree.  Don't travel halfway around the globe to watch Big Bang Theory.  Explore!
solotravel,3d8ei0,KillBosby,11,Tue Jul 14 15:23:33 2015 UTC,The idea is just to get yourself back on track by doing something that is familiar so that you are up to going out and exploring.  This is also one of the nice things about slow travel versus a short vacation - on a short vacation you are burning up precious time with anything other than exploring a new place.  When you are slow traveling you don't have to be totally focused only on making the most out of every precious minute - if you want to indulge yourself or need to get your strength back you have time to do so.
solotravel,3d8ei0,curiouscat,-6,Tue Jul 14 16:47:12 2015 UTC,"Being uncomfortable is good - it breeds growth. Being coddled and coddling yourself all the time isn't going to make you grow.  We just have different styles - you like to interact with other westerners and do things you could easily do at home. Pointless in my opinion, but I'm glad it works for you!  :-) :-) :-)"
solotravel,3d8ei0,KillBosby,9,Wed Jul 15 03:07:54 2015 UTC,"Disagree.  Exploring is important, but so is self care.  You have to take care of yourself first and foremost, especially when you're by yourself in the middle of nowhere.  If watching Big Bang Theory helps to get you into a better head space, then do that."
solotravel,3d8ei0,EmotionalRefuge,4,Tue Jul 14 17:58:26 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Long term travel requires those days a person needs to keep to their self.

I said watch 10-15 minutes of something that's familiar and funny - long enough to distract you from your thoughts and panicking.

solotravel,3d8ei0,PerchAU,10,Wed Jul 15 02:54:08 2015 UTC,"You're almost me a month ago. I'm Australian, quit my job, travelling for 6 or months around Asia, often shy initially. At first I was constantly worried about meeting people and thoroughly researched hostels to find places that sounded friendly and social. What I've now learned is that other than making sure you smile, say hello and hanging around communal areas, you can't really force these things. The worst thing you can do is stay cooped up in your room. Don't worry about meeting people, it'll happen. Sometimes you'll get lucky and hit it off with everybody in your dorm and sometimes they'll be a bunch dicks. It can be hit or miss and it took me some time to accept that. Don't let yourself or anyone else put pressure on you if you don't meet people everywhere straight away.  At first, of course you're going to feel overwhelmed. Give yourself some time to adjust and know that things only get better as you grow more comfortable. For now, go for a wander, buy some street food. Chiang Mai is a lovely place and the old city is easy to navigate on foot. A cooking class can be interesting and a good way to meet people. I met a bunch of people on the songthaew on the way up to Wat Doi Suthep.  Take a breather and get out there. You have so much to look forward to!"
solotravel,3d8ei0,EmotionalRefuge,5,Tue Jul 14 11:46:05 2015 UTC,"A cooking class can be interesting and a good way to meet people.   OP, definitely do this, if it's within your budget.  When I was up there, I figured ""eh, if I have money left over, I'll do it in Krabi.""  Turns out the cooking classes in Chiang Mai are the best in the country.  It's the only thing from my trip that I wish I had done, but didn't.  Also, everything is way cheaper north.    Oh, and if time/budget allows, check out Pai.  It was fantastic!"
solotravel,3d8ei0,mrandocalrissian,6,Tue Jul 14 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"If your hostel has a social area, go down to it.  Take a book, a guide book or a notepad.  Listen for people speaking English (I assume you only speak English) and ask them...anything.  Maybe about a good place to eat?    Don't ve afraid to tell them you've just arrived and you feel a little lost.  You don't really need to hide how you feel with most backpackers.  Everyone's taken that first step before and some of them probably handled it worse than you may feel you are handling it. :)"
solotravel,3d8ei0,EmotionalRefuge,3,Tue Jul 14 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.    Also OP, if you're looking for a good hostel recommendation, Diva's in the old town is fairly comfortable, affordable and really friendly.  I was in a similar situation to you - except I had traveled before many a times, but was still feeling very anxious - that's never really gone away over the years, I just have lots of experience pushing me to make that first move now.    Anyway, I'm at Diva's, getting a smoothie, trying to decide what to do and hoping against hope to meet someone interesting.  A girl a table away from me is sitting by herself, and smiled at me.  I smiled back, asked if she was by herself, and joined her.    Turned out to be her first time traveling by herself, so we had an insta-bond about being solo female travelers.  And if she hadn't smiled and I hadn't smiled back, we would've never met each other.    It's really scary right now - but remember that unlike back home - most westerners you'll meet in Thailand will be in a similar situation to you - and therefore much more welcoming and open.    Good luck!  And let me know if you want specific recommendations.  I was just there a month ago.    EDIT:  Also, I'm really sorry for the panic attack.  They're scary, especially with no one around.  But if you're willing to be a bit vulnerable with strangers and ask for help, it can actually bring you closer together.  A really great read (actually, I'd recommend a listen because she does such a damn good job bringing everything to life) is The Art of Asking by Amanda Palmer."
solotravel,3d8ei0,OralSexHandGestures,4,Tue Jul 14 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to talk about me a bit first. Then let's talk about you. I felt something similar when I quit my job and arrived at my first destination. I don't care what's normal and I'm not going to try to talk you out of what you're feeling. There are folks who worry or stress nothing when they travel but that's not me.  I'm terrified of all sorts of things but I'm pretty much ok with it. When I arrived some months ago I gave myself a day to completely panic, freak out, and doubt myself. An entire day. I don't think I needed the whole day. At some point naturally the panic stopped, but I never tried to suppress it. Eventually moods just shift on their own, it's a natural thing. Just feel whatever you're feeling.  How was the flight? What have you seen that you want to try? I loved Chang Mai. It's is one of my favorite places in the world, I really hope you like it. I know a variety of hostels in Chang Mai, maybe you'll get a recommendation online for a different one? Have you eaten?  I may have some suggestions about things to do while you're there. And I've met people all sorts of places. Lately I've met folks waiting in lines for things and on trains. I met a lovely man in the Milan train station who gave the best conversation I've had in weeks. It happens at the most random times, yet I've also spent entire days where I'm on my own. It's always a mix.  Anyway, I'm blathering.  Feel free to pm me for more blathering."
solotravel,3d8ei0,curiouscat,4,Tue Jul 14 10:03:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I've been waiting to feel better but it's really hard to breathe. The flight was good. I've just been in a haze because of how much stress i'm feeling. I don't really have much of an appetite, but I had a mango smoothie.  I'm generally an awkward person so it's not too easy for me to make friends. I think I give off a bad vibe because i'm nervous. I think  i'm just so used to being in my comfort zone that i'm freaking out being far from my friends and family. This is the reason I did this trip. To face my fears and be okay on my own, but I think I overestimated my own abilities. In my mind I pictured myself as a fearless and adventurous person. Yet i'm here and all I can do is try not to cry. Did you ever feel that way? What would you recommend doing? Sorry for ranting, thanks for putting in the time to talk to me."
solotravel,3d8ei0,OralSexHandGestures,3,Tue Jul 14 11:23:54 2015 UTC,"I never felt that way but you do really learn about yourself when you travel alone.  Being independent, willing to make your own decisions and accept the consequences within a community where you have built in support is one thing.  Doing that when you are flying solo is fairly different (in my experience).  I had a couple times where feeling I was all on my own and finding that a bit difficult but most of the time it was great.  The initial shock does get a fair number of people but usually they recover pretty quickly.  My main advice is to do what you can just to make yourself feel better for a bit now (calling home, eating ice cream, watching the 5th Element, go drinking with people from the hostel, go get some great food - Cooking Love is really nice... whatever things work for you).  Just get some comfort and allow yourself to re-stabilize a bit.  I think most of the time that is all it takes to get over the initial shock some people feel.  Of course, for some people, something different might do the trick..."
solotravel,3d8ei0,KCSunshine111,2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe some rice would be good, something sort of plain and substantive for you to eat. I think it's ok that you're awkward. Maybe it'll take a few days to feel comfortable. Maybe it'll take a week. That's all absolutely fine. i felt so similar at first. It sounded like a great idea and then I was there and thought about how nice it would be to be home. You've already accomplished so much by going. Also, it's fine to cry. Absolutely it is. It might be better not to fight it so much and just let yourself go through the emotions. My advice would be put your headphones in and go for a walk. Maybe a short walk. Listen to your favorite songs and just take a look at things. It'll give you the distance that's best for you and allow you to be in a comfortable headspace with sounds you know you love. If that's too much maybe listen to something at the hostel in the common areas. what do you think?"
solotravel,3d8ei0,EmotionalRefuge,2,Tue Jul 14 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where you're staying now, but try Hug Hostel. It's usually a pretty social crowd. Also, ask people if they want to share a red taxi to one of the night markets. You won't be obligated to shop with them, but it might help to start a conversation on way!   Definitely do a cooking class.   I'm not the type to meet people for the first time at bars, but there's a popular cluster of bars in the northeast corner of the old city, namely Zoe in Yellow.  Walk around the old city and see the all the temples. Sit in on a monk chat (I don't remember which temple, the second most important one, I believe).   Grab people to share a taxi and go watch the sunset on Doi Suthep.   See a ladyboy cabaret show! They are a blast!   Finally, head to Pai.   Edit: Solo travel is terrifying at first, I definitely understand. It will get easier! I'm not the type to typically start conversations, but there are a hundred other backpackers who are and will with you. You'll also learn very quickly the basic small talk for meeting a backpacker. ""When did you get here? How long are you traveling for? Where have you been so far? Where are you from?"" It get repetitive, but it's the easiest way to start a convo, and then you find some activity to do together and talking gets easier. You will be fine! You will have some days where you meet no one and you're lonely, you meet people and they suck, you don't meet people and you're glad because you need the day off, and you meet people and they are freaking awesome and you wish you could spent more time together. The most amazing thing about traveling solo is it is all up to you! Enjoy doing whatever the hell you want to do! It will be hard coming back and having to work on other people's schedules, haha."
solotravel,3d8ei0,TyrellMartell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:53:29 2015 UTC,"Piggy backing on this.    Just down the street from Zoe's is a fantastic Italian place.  I know you didn't come to Thailand to eat Italian, but it is some of the best gnocchi I've ever had (and I've been to Italy).  I had a day when my hostel fell through, I had no AC, shitting, long ride from Pai and when I went to get dinner, there were ants crawling all over it.  I really needed a bit of comfort so I went to this Italian place.    Fan-fucking-tastic."
solotravel,3d8ei0,coloradofishtapes,2,Tue Jul 14 18:00:56 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else, this was me. I'm super socially awkward, a solo female traveller, and my first three days in Croatia (Europe backpacking) were just really uneasy feelings and nightly panic attacks. Give yourself time to adjust :) In a few days you'll get into the groove of things and it'll start becoming fun. And remember no one is FORCING you to stay in SEA. So long as you realize you can leave at any point, it becomes a lot less scary."
solotravel,3d8ei0,grinch337,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:26 2015 UTC,"Try to find something that you are very familiar with, that is a part of who you are. If you like reading books, seek out a book store. If you like food, find a nice restaurant and splurge on a three or five course meal. If yeah dig fishing, go find a pond.  I think when you find a friend in ""yourself"", then you feel much more comfortable in unknown environments. I felt a lot like you did when I went to Hawaii; just didn't feel like I fit in around all the wealthy people. Once I started to socialize more with native people, as well as fish (didn't for the first two days) I felt like a million bucks, and that I fit there more."

Ask at the front desk if they have any brochures for tours/trips. This is pricy but it's similar to what I'm talking about!   Sitting in the lobby/social area at 4-6 pm is a great way to meet some people to have dinner with. Dinner turns into drinks, turns into late night, and then you've got some new buddies to hang out with.  Don't be afraid to enjoy spending time by yourself. Bring a map, guidebook, and camera and walk the blocks around your hostel!"

Honestly I thought I was stupid for wanting to go.  ...and then the next day, the sun came out, and my airbnb host showed me around, and everything was different.  New.  Exciting!  Don't panic, OP!  Stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong and start thinking about all the things that are going right.  YOU DID IT!  You're in SEA!  You have 5 months to do WHATEVER YOU WANT!  That's a ton of stuff to be pumped about.  Meeting people?  Don't worry about that, I got you covered.  Any other problems?  No worries, just ask on this community (or even PM me if you want), and you'll have a bunch of strategies to try.  Just make sure you try!  Trying is the most important thing.  That's why you're travelling, isn't it?  =) so just get over yourself, start trying and you'll start having fun.  You can do it OP.

solotravel,3d8ei0,nucleophilic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"I travel solo for business and pleasure on a regular basis and I always get the touchdown blues. Stressing about how you feel will only make it worse. What I've found works is to accept what is in essence a perfectly natural sense of dislocation and try to get comfortable with the idea of being elsewhere. You don't need to go outside to do this. Hole up in your hostel for a few hours--or even a full day, if you need it--watch a movie, read a book... Then take a shower, put on some fresh clothes, and head out to have a meal by yourself. Then come back and relax. Then go out again and walk around the city. It'll feel like home within 24 hours."

solotravel,3d8ei0,JustDoitX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:09:00 2015 UTC,"The ""fight or flight"" response is surprisingly common. That's your body/mind getting freaked out about the big change. It's a bit like a junkie having withdrawal symptoms - you need to ride it out for a few days until you acclimatise to your new surroundings. It's absolutely fine and it will pass.  Give yourself a few days to adjust and take it slow. Like someone said, watch a TV show you know, read a book in the common area or in a scenic place. Go onto Skype and chat with family/friends from home. Pick out one or two touristy things to do tomorrow, and read up on the history about them. Just try to calm yourself down by doing normal stuff.  Good luck, in a few days you'll be in full holiday mode and getting into the fun of things. :)"

When I first got there, I realized how alone and how far away from home I was, so I started to tear up right in the lobby of my hostel. But you know what? I wouldn't trade the experiences I had for anything. Your trip is what you make it, so like someone else said, book some day trips! You'll meet people on them and have people to hang out with for a bit.  I loved walking around Chiang Mai when I was there. There are a lot of markets and places to just wander to and from. It's also very easy to walk around the main part because it's basically a giant square. And definitely look into more social hostels if you feel that would benefit you. Good luck!"

Take a look at wikitravel for description of those areas. Regarding food, I made a food porn post here: https://medium.com/table-for-me/food-porn-san-francisco-1ff4215dafe2  And then I spent a week in Seattle: https://medium.com/table-for-me/food-porn-seattle-a9c5648da434 If you only have 1/2 day there, head to Pike Place Market and be sure to go inside to its 3-4 levels built over a cliff.  I was in Vancouver for a couple of weeks a few years back. Japanese food there are popular and authentic."

Fun city guides: http://ohhappyday.com/category/travel/san-francisco/ http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/3421-hidden-gems-of-san-francisco-  Obviously see the Golden Gate Bridge – walk across or rent a bike! Dolores Park, Ferry Building/Embarcadero, The Mission (most cool things are on Valencia St.), Presidio, Palace of Fine Arts, Exploratorium, The Marina, Fort Funston, Ocean Beach.  Take the retro cable car down Market St. I think it's like $3-5, I can't remember. Lyft and Uber are really great for getting around the city. I personally entrust Lyft over Uber."

solotravel,3d9acn,kgarv3,2,Tue Jul 14 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"I would go Cairns (Great Barrier Reef, Daintree Rainforest, Cape Tribulation), Uluru, Sydney and Melbourne."
solotravel,3d9acn,cupp95,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Cairns does seem like it has a lot to offer. Does 4 days in Sydney, 2 days in Uluru/Alice (fly into Ayers Rock Airport/out of Alice Springs Airport), 5 days in Cairns, and then 3 days in Melbourne sound like enough to you?"
solotravel,3d9acn,sataimir,2,Tue Jul 14 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"What do you plan to see/do in each place? For Uluru/Alice, would you see King's Canyon and Kata Tjuta as well? Have you taken in to account the approx 4-5 hours between Uluru and Alice (driving time)?  In Cairns, do you plan on doing more than the reef and the Daintree? How about Cape Tribulation, or Kuranda, or the tablelands just inland? If you want to scuba dive you'll need at least 24 hours either side of the dive where you're not flying, or the altitude/pressure changes could mess you up.  In Sydney, do you want to come visit the Blue Mountains, or see any other NSW landmark areas such as Port Stephens, Jervis Bay, or even just see more of Sydney than the CBD and Bondi? (Btw, there's better beaches in Sydney than Bondi.) Did you want to spend time doing things like the Bridge Climb or coastal walks?   In Melbourne, are you a foodie? A Neighbours fan? Do you plan on seeing Great Ocean Road, Philip Island, or Wilson's Promontory? Do you want time to wander and discover the street art?  Do you want time to wonder around and just explore in general?  You need a must-see and a hope-to-see highlights list before anybody can tell you whether your planned timing is realistic. It can be done, but if natural beauty is your number 1 goal, many of the most beautiful places are not necessarily on the quick and easily accessible tourist trail, so you may need to decide what's must-see so you can prioritise your time accordingly (and work out flights etc)."
solotravel,3d9acn,cupp95,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:57:29 2015 UTC,2 days in Uluru/Alice Springs is definitely not enough. It's a 6 hour drive from Uluru to Alice Springs as it is.  Why Alice Springs?
solotravel,3d9acn,goodintent,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:58:48 2015 UTC,"5 days in Cairns is a bit much I think.... I would personally spend more time in Sydney than Melbourne but this really comes down to what you're into. Sydney is more touristy - beaches, iconic buildings, more tourist stuff to see and do. Melbourne is more of a cultural capital and is better to go exploring, seeing shows, eating and drinking... That kinda stuff.  In any case 2 weeks is not a long time and don't forget that you'll be covering large distances if you're thinking of doing Uluru, Cairns, Sydney and Melbourne in one trip. You'll need to block out a couple of days for travel I'd say."
solotravel,3d9acn,divermick,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:27:06 2015 UTC,"For natural beauty in Sydney, try the royal national park. Train to cronulla and ferry across the bay, hike down to wedding cake rock for instance. Great day trip. Try around the blue mountains, the usuals, but also around blackheath. Try the glen or upper Shipley. Great valley views. South coast new is amazing as well. Camping spots down there kick ass."
solotravel,3d9acn,momomjr,0,Wed Jul 15 04:46:54 2015 UTC,"If you want to stay around the east coast, I would suggest more time in Melbourne than Sydney. It's far more interesting, and from there you can rent a car and drive the great ocean road (Melbourne to Port Campbell and back 2 days), maybe fly to Tasmania for some hiking and adventuring?  Sydney is a city. Spend a couple days there in Newtown and see the sights then bail and explore Melbourne, you'll have a better time.   I'm from Perth and have never been to Tasmania or Uluru/Alice but I've heard good things. It might be a nice time of year to see northern Queensland (great barrier reef) or Broome in the west. Personally I think the west coast wins, but I am fond of Melbourne."
solotravel,3d9acn,divermick,0,Tue Jul 14 15:10:03 2015 UTC,"This is really bad advice. Not to ignite a syd melb rivalry, but syd has a plethora of natural beauty, more easily accessible than Melbourne. I've lived in both cities. I hike."
solotravel,3d9acn,momomjr,0,Wed Jul 15 04:44:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get Blue Mountains and all that, but in 2 weeks I'd always suggest more time in Melbs. I've been a tourist in both (several times) and past the usual stuff, Sydney is a city like other cities are a city.   I'm from Perth, I wouldn't recommend being a tourist in Perth for more than like...a day?"
solotravel,3d9acn,divermick,0,Wed Jul 15 13:21:40 2015 UTC,"Eh. There is heaps to do in Perth. I've lived in all 3 cities. And Darwin.  Op wanted natural stuff, heaps of that in all 3. More easily accessible by public transport in Sydney than any other city in aus."
solotravel,3d4rqv,Wedacucumbas,19,Mon Jul 13 14:54:08 2015 UTC,"Hey I thought I'd try and write some words of encouragement as I'm in the same boat as you.  I am 27 as well and I put my notice in, and I'm flexible so I'm waiting for them to tell me when my last day is (7/31 up until 9/25) since I want to leave on good terms.  I have a great job that I've been at 4.5 years with benefits and 401k all that jazz.  I worked hard to get here, but I feel like I am not fulfilled and that I'm in a unique situation.  I worked hard to pay off my student loans ASAP, and right now I have zero bills (company pays for my phone and company car), zero debt, no relationship or dependents.  A few months ago I sat down and thought about what is really important to me, and what could I do right now that would give me the most out of my current situation.    I realized I am going to be able to buy a house, get a nice car, get dependents, etc all in the future all almost without doubt.  Traveling is something I've always loved, and being able to ""press pause"" on life and go out there and see the world for an uninterrupted extended period of time, that was something that I am not confident I always will be able to do.  So I'm doing it.   I've got tickets purchased and I my parents support.  My dad has offered to let me work for him when I return and says I can live with them while I get back on my feet.  I'll be making much less than I am now, but it will be enough for me to save and allow me to actively and successfully job hunt.  I'm also going to use that time to study and take some exams for certifications that will help me for career.  My roommate has graciously decided that he wants to watch after my dog and take over financial responsibility for her while I'm gone.  This is a huge relief to me as my parents offered to watch her, but I know she wouldn't get the active life with them that she does with me (I'm into camping, hiking, etc up here in Colorado, and my parents live in Houston and are approaching 60 and more relaxed).  My advice:  If you are actively thinking about it you are going to regret not doing it more than if you do it and hate it.  Don't let the prospect of not finding a job immediately when you return stop you from living life.  This is an experience that not many get to enjoy.  It sounds like you have set yourself up with enough experience for another job when you return and you will be fine.  Hit me up with what you decide... I really enjoy hearing others stories!"

That was in 2013. I have now been living on the road, taking working holiday visas and casual jobs for over 2 years now. Its a downgrade in pay, but I've built a lifestyle with which I'm sure that I'm infinitely more happy.  A rainy day on a beach is better than a sunny day in an office."
solotravel,3d4rqv,haloshade,2,Mon Jul 13 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"Is the new job style because you wanted to live on the road and live that lifestyle or because you couldn't find a permanent job?

It was meant to be 2.5 months in Europe, I found some work and wound up doing 4 months. When I came back to Canada I went back to the city where I had worked before to touch base with my old friends and business contacts but I lasted... 5 days I think? Wound up hopping on a bus to the rockies to be a ski bum instead. Havent really looked back since."

When I was in a similar position I went to my boss with a resignation letter in my pocket and asked for a 6-month unpaid leave, but made it clear that either way I was gone in a month."
solotravel,3d4rqv,nctaxthrowaway,5,Mon Jul 13 18:28:02 2015 UTC,I have been with this company for a year now. Our vacation system sucks...3 days after 1 year and you gain an additional 3 days per year you are with the company but it maxes out at 9 days. I was thinking of a leave of absence but I just don't think it's worth it. I feel if I go out and travel there is no way in hell I could walk back through my office doors and pick up right where I left off.
solotravel,3d4rqv,impy695,3,Mon Jul 13 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"One year might not be enough time on the job to ask, but it doesn't hurt (you're gone regardless right?). I was given the leave and did end up returning to work there after about 8 months or so. However, I'd been with the company for 8 years by then.  If I didn't make it clear before, I fully support this type of travel. I probably waited too long before I took the plunge, but have no regrets at all."
solotravel,3d4rqv,Media-n,4,Mon Jul 13 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"Wait. You get 3 days of vacation per year? I must be misunderstanding what you mean. If you only get 3 days of vacation per year, you definitely need to quit. Well, I was going to suggest you quit anyways, regardless of how tough it will be to find a new job when you return, because at the end of your life, do you want to remember having spent your 20s working and refraining from travel out of fear of not having a job, or would you prefer to have memories and stories about having seen the world. I personally wouldn't care how long it took to find a new job after the money runs out, I want to see the world while I'm still young enough to enjoy it."
solotravel,3d4rqv,queenofthenerds,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:34:27 2015 UTC,So after your first year you get 3 days. After two years with the company you get 6 days a year. After the third year you receive 9 days a year and that's the max. So whether I'm there for 3 years or 20 I get 9 days PTO.
solotravel,3d4rqv,EvilSnowWhite,3,Mon Jul 13 23:43:16 2015 UTC,"dude that's awful. I get 9 holidays a year, not even counting PTO and I'm here in the US, where we're known for not having decent time off. definitely quit and go man. no better time to do it. /u/nibot1 said it perfectly."
solotravel,3d4rqv,EvilSnowWhite,3,Tue Jul 14 00:24:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's tough. Obviously I get days off for holidays like the 4th, Mermorial Day, etc. but if I actually just want to go on a trip there really is zero chance."
solotravel,3d4rqv,drcross,3,Tue Jul 14 12:49:21 2015 UTC,"Three days vacation after a year is horrible! While a leave of absence is doable (I've done it and have a friend who has done it), I don't think it's worth it at this point.  My guess is you won't have much of a problem finding a job based on what you've said (though I don't know your industry). It's not like you won't have an unexplained gap in your resume. Any company that's worth working for will see your trip for what it is and it will look favorable. Hell, after my trip, people who have done that instantly go to the top of the pile as it shows they have the qualities that we want.  With that said, set aside money and have a plan for what you'll do when you get back in case it takes a little time to get hired."
solotravel,3d4rqv,irish-ygritte,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:12:32 2015 UTC,"I agree, it wouldn't be worth taking a leave of absence.

solotravel,3d4rqv,NSDelToro,3,Tue Jul 14 12:52:30 2015 UTC,"That vacation time is ridiculous, travel and maybe you will find a different city and country you would rather work in, perhaps in a place that gives you actual vacation time..... max 9 days? I couldn't live. Good luck, you will not regret your decision :)"

solotravel,3d4rqv,bears2013,9,Mon Jul 13 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation a few years ago.  Rather than quitting outright, I was able to take six months of personal leave.  So, no salary or health insurance during that time, but my position was held for me if I chose to return.  I was about 50/50 whether I would return at the end of six months or just quit, and I was upfront about that with my boss, who was pretty supportive of me.   While I was traveling, I thought a lot about my job versus other potential jobs.  Like, I'd look at people I came into contact with -- bus drivers, cops, chefs, whoever -- and considered whether I would be happier or not if I were doing a job like that.  In the end, I decided to stay at my job because I couldn't really find another one that I'd rather do.   I'm still at that same job and honestly, I'm still not very happy there.  I'm actively looking into other options, but finding a new job isn't too easy.    Anyway, I know that taking an unpaid personal leave may not be an option where you work, but maybe it is, and it might be worth looking into."

solotravel,3d4rqv,mbaran23,3,Mon Jul 13 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"If you take a leave and don't return, that works out exactly the same as if you had quit four months earlier, so you aren't losing anything.  Basically, you're giving yourself some insurance because if you change your mind and decide to return, you still have job security.   I'm not saying that you will change your mind.  It's just that it could happen.  I ended up going back, and it sounds like /u/Sternface had a similar experience.  It's absolutely okay if you do, and it's absolutely okay if you don't."

solotravel,3d4rqv,helloimbenlinus,7,Mon Jul 13 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"A job, yes. A career, no.   It was easy to quit my job in a restaurant after saving enough money to go travel. I'd have to think more seriously about it if I had a good job such as you have.  The sentiment of quitting a job to travel is romantic, and definitely doable. On the other hand, travel is expensive and there is something to be said for having a job that comfortably funds your life and could theoretically comfortably fund travel time and time again.   If this isn't a career or an industry you want to stay in, I say go for it. You may have a hard time finding a job upon your return, but you might've had a hard time finding a job you wanted even if you didn't leave."

And even then, things add up very quickly in my experience. When people tell me ""I don't have the money to travel"" i am the first to assure them that it can be done cheaper than they think. But I think ""Travel isn't that expensive"" isn't really a hard and fast truth. Because it is always an expense you wouldn't have had otherwise. And unless you're traveling for months at a time, working while traveling usually isn't feasible.   I don't know, maybe I'm doing it wrong. But I sleep on couches and make my own food more often than not while traveling and yeah, I'd say it is still expensive."

I miss my old job (I loved it) and living in the states, but it has been super worth it just for the experiences.

I’m 29 and started thinking about travel back around 26.  My words of advice:   Always leave your job on the best terms you can. Gratitude goes a long way in life, even when we don’t feel it in a moment.  If you want to find out how to travel CHEAP, start learning right now. My wife and I live off of 1/3 of the money we used to live off of. We have a roommate, I bike to work, 1 car, cook our own food, etc. We've seriously reduced our ""standard of living"" to both save and learn how to live cheaper. Even though we don't spend any money, I actually am happier and healthier now than I have ever been. Our grocery bill is much less than half of our original budget and we (now) only eat organic produce. Don't under estimate your ability to adapt and be creative! I consider myself a creative and very resourceful person, skills that I don't get to develop all that well working a desk job. I look forward to being challenged while traveling. Diving into the unknown will turn on a part of your brain that might have gone a little dormant while living in routine. There are people who are traveling with MUCH less than you or I have and for much longer.    The best opportunities in life will probably cost you more than you want to pay."

solotravel,3d4rqv,cheriot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:03:03 2015 UTC,That's the plan. Hoping to have enough of a nest egg to support myself until I can find something upon my return. Luckily my Mom said I can move back in with her until I get back on my feet.

solotravel,3d4rqv,andion82,3,Mon Jul 13 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"I spent 6 years studying finance and maths, in order to become a good financial analyst... then became the road tripper / researcher for the newly launched family travel business. I miss the hard intellectual stimulation of  technical fields, but I love the emotional stimulation of meeting new people, adapting to changing scenarios, dealing with the ups and downs of entrepreneurship, oh and obviously just seeing so many new things!  In the run-up to this decision, I spoke to a few mentors and the overwhelming consensus was ""The longer you get it, the harder it is to walk away from a steady paycheck""... and I figure life is short, if you want to do something else you'd better do it :-)"
solotravel,3d4rqv,notactuallyabus,2,Mon Jul 13 21:42:39 2015 UTC,newly launched family travel business   can you expand on this? do you have a website or travel company that turns a profit to fund your travels?
solotravel,3d4rqv,andion82,2,Mon Jul 13 15:16:27 2015 UTC,"Sure! In a nutshell, my family and I know the travel scene in S.A. very well after years and years of exploring in our free time, so we decided to turn all that knowledge into an online guide to the country. We brought in lots of activity experts to fill in the gaps in our knowledge, and also have a cool collaborative magazine. The monetization behind all this content is that we've cherry picked the 500 best accomm. venues in the country, so if you use our guide you would in theory book your accomm using the online booking buttons on our site, and we get a small commission.  This model relies on significant site traffic to generate real revenue, hence quality fresh content is important, and this is why I've spent so much time exploring and documenting SA over the past 3 years.  Given our media capabilities, we've also partnered with some very experienced guys in the safari industry to offer fully customised luxury safaris. This model is less about a good site (although, if I say so myself, we have a darn good safari site) and more about who you know. A luxury safari goes for USD 3000 to USD 20 000, so people tend to want to drop that kind of money on folks that they either know or have had recommended to them.  It's both nerve wracking and absolutely fascinating to be in both ends of the market (high volume, small earnings and low volume big earnings).  However, the key that makes our businesses work is years of research, and about 4 000 properly written up data points. If you work out how many minutes each one takes and do the math, thats quite scary - it has taken us 4 years of prep to get here! So, I wouldn't recommend this as a ""I want to spread my wings"" route for a would-be professional traveller. Far more popular for individuals is the 'earn for writing' route. I realllllly wish I could remember who it was, but a female travel blogger wrote a stunningly detailed piece about how she made it happen (I hope someone can find the link!) but the essence of what she said was that she started applying for copy writing jobs on 'find a writer' type websites, and just spent 4 hours a day on it for a year or two until she'd built up a good enough rep / portfolio to be able to generate a pretty reliable small income each month. Once this income got to the point where she could live off it on the road, she went!  I think her point translates well - there are numerous skill sets that are in demand as freelancers on the web. Writing, graphic design, voicing audio books, etc etc. Find something that's in your portfolio of talents, and commit to building it up according to a set schedule 5 days a week until you can leave.  Just as someone who does edit an online magazine, a note: despite the Massive volume of writing available on the internet, there is Very little truly good writing available, so if you can develop that as a skillset and are willing to network, you can survive on the road.  Another important thing is networks; especially from an African travel industry perspective. Someone who knows a potential luxury safari client is worth a bag of gold nuggets to me, and I would go a long way to work with said person in exchange for their contacts. Our safari division is too new to have the marketing budget for this yet, but that is exactly the premise on which numerous 'blogger trips' are done to safari destinations.  To sum it all up, the cool word for someone who earns while they travel is a digital nomad, and if you look that up you'll find millions of examples of how to become one. There are so many ways to do it that it can be a bit overwhelming, so focus on things that are close to what you currently do or can do, and start building it up before you leave!   :)"

solotravel,3d4rqv,notactuallyabus,3,Tue Jul 14 13:39:05 2015 UTC,Like bro I am scared as hell. I am rocket scientist. I booked my ticket for Thailand in February of 2016. I have no idea what's going to happen but I know my desk job is not for me. I can't live this way and I'm willing to take any consequences that comes my way. Everyone is so proud of me for making it this far at age 25. But I am not living my life for them. I am living this life for me. I can't live the rest of my life making others happy while deep down I thirst for adventure. And I also only booked a one way ticket YOLO.

solotravel,3d4rqv,Kalikoenig,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks. After a couple weeks catching up with family, I have a flight to Nairobi. The theme of the trip/year will be places that I can't get to on a two week vacation.  So far, I'm more overwhelmed with breaking away from my old life than I am worried about establishing something when I get back. Once that subsides, though, I'll be back to the sheer excitement that motivates the whole thing."
solotravel,3d4rqv,Kalikoenig,3,Mon Jul 13 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"I did, and I regret nothing.  It was 4 year ago and I was 28. I had the typical... ""one day"" I will travel the world thinking, but never really did a big trip aside holidays. After having a bladder tumor removed I quit a permanet job I really liked (in NW Spain) for an 1 year internship in Perú, travelled as much as I could on holidays that year in South America. Came back home, spent a month, and backpacked for one more year in South East Asia.  After coming back I spent 2 months home with the family, found a job in the same town I was living after searching only for 1 week (I am a web developer so it's not hard).  Now I'm back on my original company. I am very happy, and they now I want to leave again eventually to travel.   Do it, don't even hesitate, maybe it won't be as straight-forward to you when coming back, or as easy, you never know. But I'm sure you'll have the same feeling: when you know you'll do it again."
solotravel,3d4rqv,GetLostAndBeFound,2,Tue Jul 14 04:01:50 2015 UTC,How was backpacking around SE Asia around that age- do you think it was different for you at all vs. the 18-23 crowd that you hear from so often on here?  I'm planning on the same in a few months.
solotravel,3d4rqv,kellisamberlee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe they were partying more on average, but I always avoided very touristic places and/or party cities/hostels so I only found 18s and 20-something that were really experiencing their travels, mature, thoughtful and kind. In fact most of the time I felt embarrassed how I was at their age in comparison.   I think travel has that effect on people, and I love it."

You will never regret taking time in your life to travel.  Especially if you are young and don't have a mortgage or children to worry about.

I haven't actually gone travelling yet, but I was 3 years into a mechanic engineering career, been promoted a few times, was in a good position and was in it for the career.   Got fairly unhappy in the role, and decided to fuck it all and leave. I planned to save and resign, but a few months before that our office announced redundancies. So I took voluntary, got a pretty decent package, and walked out the door that day.   It was about to be super baller, but 3 weeks after I left I broke my arm :-/  So I'm currently waiting for it to heal before I actually begin my travels. I own a flat, which I have rented out, and am currently living back at home until my arm heals.   I figure I've got about a year from when I start travelling- off to Austin for 3 months or so to visit friends, and then Asia, then across Europe for a month.   I'm from the uk, fyi.   But 100% do what makes you happy. Depending on your beliefs, you only get one life, and wasting it doing something that doesn't bring you joy is a foolish waste.   Good luck man."

When I came back I ended up back with the same company and have been working there almost a year now.  I just recently gave them notice that I'll be leaving again as I'm taking a few months to travel around Japan and China.  I was the same way you're feeling.  The job I had was something I never wanted to make a career out of.  It didn't make me happy and I hadn't planned to stick around as long as I did.  I was making money and felt complacent.

I'm the same age and was able to save enough money the last 4 years right after college. Officially left my job back in October of last year and just got back to the states a few weeks ago.  Nearly all my friends in similar situations all say how much they want to do a similar trip like mine but I've noticed most people are scared to make that jump. The experiences you'll have even though you're not making money or advancing in your career are invaluable. A few older people I've talked to (40 plus) all said the same thing prior to me leaving and that was to travel as long as possible because once life is too serious, chances are you won't have the same opportunity.

Anything farther north I do not know. Kind of hard starting somewhere, as I am not sure what you want to see. Los Angeles is not for the faint of heart. You will certainly need a car to get around. Much of Los Angeles is very segregated both by race, as well as economic status. You will literally find all walks of life there. You may stick out like a sore thumb, so mind your surroundings. It is expensive, but if you are from NY it might actually seem kinda cheap by your rate of living. San Diego is similar to Los Angeles in some ways, but has a very healthy hespanic influence and culture. The areas that are nice are VERY nice, and the bad parts are well ...really bad. San Francisco is amazing! It has a very solid public transport system (BART). The people here are very progressive thinking, and smart. To me many folks came across as pretentious hipsters, so it didn't gel well with my personality (ie: drink beer in garage and work on cars). The scenery is breath taking, but prepare to spend money like it is nuthin', a very expensive place. If I had to list some (tourist) must see's I would say Mann's Chinnese, Griffith Observatory, Fisherman's Wharf, Santa Monica Pier, Venice, and The Golden Gate Bridge."

I have friends who travel with AirBnb every time they go anywhere and swear by it. At least one of them loved hostels when she was younger, but now that she's not really traveling to do any drinking/clubbing/partying, I think she appreciates being able to have more of an ""early to bed, early to rise"" travel strategy with AirBnb. I've never tried it myself, but I'd like to when I hit China next year. I'm thinking of renting rooms in shared apartments with hosts who are reviewed as being friendly/interactive. That way, I get plenty of introvert time but can also get a better sense of the local culture."

They stop the line and put you right on an elevator going up at your appointed time. We were on the top floor within minutes of arrival.

solotravel,3d7h88,SA_Avenger,2,Thu Jul 16 11:20:34 2015 UTC,"2 days is very short for what you plan to do.  I just did 2 days in Paris, tourist style (even looking like one eh) and if you want to enjoy anything you should reduce your list to something more manageable.  The Louvre is something you want to spend several hours in, even if you manage to skip lines (which I did but be aware that it could take you an hour alone if you don't), the Mesopotamiam area is wonderful, if you like statues the greco/roman area is un missable. Napoleon III salon is quite a view as well if you want to get a taste of how the rulers lived then, and of course you have the iconic works of art which you might want to see but should be aware that everybody gang up on them and some are quite...disapointing (I mean the Venus of milo isn't the most beautiful statue in the Louvre, and Mona Lisa is tiny, there is so much to see that you have never seen that well...it's skippable)  FYI I spent 5 hours in the Louvre and didn't have time to do it all, I am a fast walker and I don't read anything nor spend much time in front of anything (It's mostly a gut feeling type of vision I am looking for) but taking pictures take time (if only for the amount of people around which are always in the frame, it's a HUGE building and it's more crowded than you imagine during summer)  The Eiffel Tower and Pont Alexandre are easily seen from up close but going up the Eiffel Tower could take you another hour just for the line and visit. I didn't try as I don't like heights.  Notre Dame is a must see, Sacre Cœur is up north but you can stop at Arc De triomphe on the way but again visiting always takes more time. Beware for even if reaching Montmartre (you should enjoy the view) is quite fast by metro but it'll require you to walk up there as well, again it's crowded during the summer and I don't think it's worth visiting inside. It's also very touristic (wouldn't advise eating around there or spending too much time, it's as crowded as the mont St Michel) but might be more enjoyable in the evening.  Even considering your feet never tire, your program has enough content to keep you busy for 4 days (depending if you want to move around by cab) if you plan on visiting and not just passing in front."
solotravel,3d7h88,ill_mango,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:55:28 2015 UTC,"thanks for your response. i pretty much know i am going to making sacrifices to be able to do what i want while i'm there. main sacrifice is going to be completely rushed the whole time..i won't get to enjoy paris the way i should, sitting around drinking wine trying some cheese and just taking it all in. nope, im going to be doing my best to try to find my way around town by way of making my itinerary loop around the city. i will go up the eiffel tower, arc de triomphe and notre dame for those experiences and photographs. i might skip the inside of the sacre coeur since i can't photograph inside. mostly planning on taking the metro around...although so far looking at it seems pretty daunting and confusing for someone that doesn't speak any french. depending on the weather i think i'm going to get a few of the big things done on the first day so the second hopefully won't be as hectic. i went to the extent of booking a second hotel that's closer to where i want to be for the first night then will meet back up with my party the second night before we fly back out. as far as the louvre is concerned, i pretty much think im going to either skip the inside or maybe get there pretty late on the 2nd night in hopes that i beat the crowds."
solotravel,3d7h88,lovelleigh,4,Tue Jul 21 12:52:40 2015 UTC,"If you want a real french experience, follow these steps:   stop by a grocery store (carrefour or whatever) grab a baugette, some cheese and wine (and maybe some chocolate) sit on the grass of sacre coeur and have a picnic   Picnics are super french, even if Sacre Coeur isn't the destination of choice for many of them ;)  After that, check out the church, it is extremely photogenic.  If you want a great picture of the Eiffel Tower, get off at Metro stop Trocadero, and walk south towards the tower.  The view is much better here, and the Champ de Mars (parc connected to the tower) is undergoing some renovations at the moment.  Finally...please don't get lost in the catacombs.  Please?  Go with an experienced guide, we don't want you to end up like this person: https://youtu.be/-bmJuwqvV6M  Also: about Michelin star restaurants.  You can DEFINITELY still get reservations if you want.  Maybe not for 3-star places, but for 1-star?  No problem!"
solotravel,3d7h88,Gertiel,2,Tue Jul 14 18:08:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything except the need for a guide in the catacombs. Assuming you enter through the normal public entrance, the underground route is designed for tourists and you shouldn't be able to access side tunnels or get lost."
solotravel,3d7h88,blackraccoon23,2,Wed Jul 15 03:33:17 2015 UTC,"Grocery store? Heck no. No self respecting Frenchman gets their baguettes and cheese in a grocery. There are MUCH better sources in France.  If you want a real French experience, go to a neighborhood bakery. Not that fancy schmancy place catering to tourists with a bunch of tables serving tea and desserts. A neighborhood bakery will have fresh baked baguettes in racks on the back wall, maybe a small case with a few desserts mostly in family size, and probably a few pizzas or pocket sandwiches. They'll open at the butt crack of dawn so hungry regulars can stop in to grab a sandwich pocket for their lunch or a baguette for breakfast.   Just a helpful hint: Be sure you've got cash hopefully in small bills or a few coins because neighborhood regulars will be lining up at 6 am to grab a baguette and no one gives you the stink eye like the baker's wife and the customers behind you in a French bakery if you slow the line down. I'm pretty sure I shrank 3 sizes and will never recover.   We found a marvelous bakery of this type just around the corner from our hotel in Arcueil south of Paris last fall. It was like nothing you'll ever taste in the US. Even the French couple that came over from France to start a bakery about 40 minutes from me can't match the quality due to the much more stringent food quality rules in France."
solotravel,3d7h88,Gertiel,0,Wed Jul 15 12:00:08 2015 UTC,I would recommand not going to the Louvre. I don't think you'll fully appreciate it if you don't spend a whole day there. You should spend more time visiting the places you mentioned in your post!

solotravel,3d6d23,Xcumber,6,Mon Jul 13 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"You'll always find a Batista job in Mel, there are more cafe's than people. That said, you could easily run through your 1500 before you get there. Living costs are roughly $1000aud a month when your not travelling - so let's call it 13-1500.   You sound like you'll have $2-3k. My advice is arrive in NZ, work for a few months and plan a trip with people you meet in hostels (why get a working holiday there If your not going to use it). Travel NZ (6 weeks to 2 months) and if you don't want to stay longer fly to Aus.  This next bit is important - fly to an area where you know the farm work season is starting soon. Check out harvest trail (Aus gov website) for details. Do your farm work first, it could easily take as long as 5 months to get all the days if you jump between employers (which you almost certainly will) and there is downtime between crops starting etc. If you plan to arrive in Aus around December - February, Tasmania is a great place to get work.  Hope that helps."

solotravel,3d6d23,turvytopsy,4,Tue Jul 14 08:40:59 2015 UTC,"I would say why waste your NZ WHV on just one or two months? You're not going to be able to do much traveling, because you won't have much change left from £1000 after just one month. So you'll need to work pretty much straight away.    Also New Zealand really rewards you for staying longer - you pretty much need your own transport to get to all the good places. Public transport will take you to the towns and cities, but you go to NZ for what's outside them - the mountains, lakes etc.  Without a car you're going to find it very hard to get to them.   So that's my suggestion - stay in NZ for the full year, buy a car, do it properly. Or just go to Australia, earn some money, and take a 4-6 week holiday in NZ."
solotravel,3d6d23,turvytopsy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:09:50 2015 UTC,I wish I had spoken to you before I had booked it all. My flights are booked and my first stop is Auckland. I was planning on making my way down south to Christchurch over the two month ish period and then flying straight to Melbourne. Is this a really bad idea then?
solotravel,3d6d23,turvytopsy,2,Tue Jul 14 07:46:57 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily a bad idea, you just need to know how tight your budget is and work around that. I'm doing a similar thing - I spent a year in New Zealand and am now in Australia. A dorm bed in a hostel will cost you an average of around $25 NZD, which is around $750 a month. Let's say you eat cheap and spend $10 a day on food, that's another $300 per month. So you're looking at around $1100 NZD per month just to live - that doesn't even take into account money you spend on actually travelling around and enjoying yourself.  Can you change your flights? If not I think you're going to need to look for work when you arrive in Auckland, otherwise you're going to be running dry towards the end. Auckland has plenty of bars and cafes so you might find something there. Get a CV ready, when you get there go to an internet cafe and print out lots of copies. Walk the streets going into cafes handing copies of your CV out - make sure you give it to the manager and not just whoever is working there. I'm not sure how much farm work will be going as most harvesting happens late summer into autumn (Late Jan through to June in NZ).   Another option would be to skip down to Christchurch quickly. There's some labouring work there as there's a lot of rebuilding going on after the earthquake a few years ago.  There's also a hostel in Mount Maunganui, Tauranga called Pacific Coast Lodge, that helped me and others find work when I was there. It's a couple of hours East of Auckland. Might be worth giving them a call to see if there's much work going there. Just bear in mind they can't guarantee you a job, they'll just send jobs your way if anything comes in while you're staying there. There's other ""working hostels"" like that in other places in NZ, Google would probably point you in their direction.  Sorry to be the bringer of bad news. It's definitely doable, you just need to hit the ground running when you get there! Feel free to ask if you have any more questions."
solotravel,3d6d23,Catbeastatleast,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:56:11 2015 UTC,"Don't be sorry, I need to hear the truth! :)  I'll Google what a typical NZ CV looks like and sort one out prior to arriving. Hopefully I can get a job in a cafe pretty quickly, I'm pretty confident in my barista skills but obviously if there is no work then it won't matter how good I am.   I think I remember reading that a WHV for NZ allows me to leave the country and come back. As I'm from the UK, I think I also read I can get a 23 month visa? With your experience, do you think it's viable to go NZ for maybe a month if I can't get a job, head over to Australia for a year(?) and then once I've possibly saved up a bit maybe head back over to NZ to do it properly.   Sorry if this is difficult to read, I'm on my phone."
solotravel,3d6d23,Catbeastatleast,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:12:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would work. With the 23 month visa you can only work for 12 months of it, but since you'd be out of the country for half of it, that wouldn't really be an issue.  If you did go to Australia, Melbourne is definitely the place to go - the coffee culture is really big there, cafes everywhere"
solotravel,3d6d23,kahzee,2,Tue Jul 14 22:41:29 2015 UTC,"I'm from NZ so I can answer any questions you have. You'll be coming into summer when you arrive so any hospo/farm or orchard jobs should be easy enough to to find. You can also Work a few hours a day at most hostels to pay for your stay, which would make your money go farther. Unless you're eating/drinking out every night, I'd say you shouldn't have a problem with that amount of money, as well as anything you earn while you're here.  (don't expect high wages like Australia) It really depends on how you expect to travel/live while you're in NZ. I hope this helps!"
solotravel,3d4nmp,dser89,16,Mon Jul 13 14:20:53 2015 UTC,"Ok, if I understand you correctly, you need to survive 2 weeks in South Africa, have ±USD 1000 to spend and would like to see the big 5? Let's do this!  USD1000 is approx ZAR 12000 (Henceforth, ZAR = R).  First, some stats. Car Rental   ± R300 / day.  Decent B&B   ±R600 / day if you're staying solo. (Mebbe 400pp for 2).  Food   ± R150 / day if you can cook yourself  Restaurant meal   ± R 100 pp average (Typical range: R70 - R300)  Big Mac Meal   ± R50  Local brewery beer   ± R25 for a pint  Craft Beer / imported beer   ± R 35 for a pint  Soft drunks ± R15  Activities:  Unguided (e.g entrance to parks)   ± R100 - R200  Guided (e.g. zip lining)   ± R800  Luxury (e.g. catered hike)   ± R1500 - R2000  As you can see from these stats, your budget is possible for your time span - it falls into the middle of the ""Budget holiday"" class. So you'll have a good time. Thus, a large number of combinations are available, so for simplicity I'm just going to highlight one idea and then you can work on it from there :)  Arrive, spend 2 or 3 nights at a backpackers in Joburg and do a Soweto township tour. Joburg is huge so it's unlikely that you can find a place thats close to everything you want to see, so I would find a place in budget that has good tripadvisor comments, and then book tours that include a pickup /  dropoff option. In your budget, you will probably only find room for 1 Joburg tour anyway, so Soweto would be my call. Actually, consider staying at Curiocity in the Maboneng precinct (lots of culture, recent urban revival project) and doing the Soweto tour, then you cross of my two top recommendations for Jozi :)  Disclaimer: I've never been to Curiocity; I'm only aware of it because I'm going to a travel industry event there on the 29th! They're new, so I dunno if there are good reviews about. If you stay somewhere else, shout and I'll try to give you an idea of what to expect in that suburb.  Then, take a bus to Phalaborwa, Hoedspruit or Nelspruit (the biggest Kruger National Park border towns). Rent a car in one of those towns, and book the cheapest public accomm you can find inside the Kruger Park on the SANParks official site: http://www.sanparks.co.za/  The cheapest accomm can go down to about R400 a night if I remember correctly.  You've left it a little late so there won't be much available, thus you can only determine which town to bus to once you've figured out which camps you'll be staying at.   The alternative is staying at a hostel in one of the park border towns as well. These hostels will be able to put you onto decent budget game drive operators that take you into the park, and it might be fun to get some social time in.  Actually, I'd do a bit of both if I was you, seeing as you have time. It's great to go on organised game drives and walks (SANParks also runs these from the rest camps in the park) because the rangers are very knowledgeable and interesting, and know the best spots. But it's also really special to sleep in the park - you're in South Africa's wildest place, and you could very well listen to lions roaring as you cook your food on a campfire... a very special experience.  I would try to end in Nelspruit - I think your best odds of getting a bus straight back to Joburg Intn'tl airport are from there as its the biggest town near the park.  Here's my write-up of the same trip, but at a slightly more expensive budget (this was written for families doing road trips from Joburg so the route isn't relevant but the attractions might be). This will give you some idea of places you can go other than the park if you're in the area. http://www.nightjartravel.com/journeys/all/mpumalanga-escarpment-&-the-kruger  Also, I've been answering a few general Kruger questions lately so if you're looking for more general FAQ's, I've cross-linked all my posts here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nightjartravel/  Ok, hope this has helped - if you've got any followup questions, just shout!"

solotravel,3d4nmp,exptl,2,Mon Jul 13 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"Wow. This was the best travel reply I think I have ever seen.  Just a few questions. I don't have a credit card, just a debit. Will I have any major problems with car rental?  Also is there any specific bus company that can get me to the outer Kruger area cheaply? I am used to Greyhounds in USA and Megabus in England, but I can't find a similar service for South Africa. It seems as if all the busses are independent services.  Also, as a solo male, what is the safety of going on a safari. I've heard South Africa has a bit of a violent crime issue. Is that just something in Cape Town and Johanesburg or should I be wary around Kruger.  Thanks for all the help, and your website looks amazing."
solotravel,3d4nmp,exptl,2,Mon Jul 13 16:14:19 2015 UTC,":-D  First of all, I am delighted that you like our site! And thank you for the compliments, it is a pleasure to help.  The debit card thing might be tricky... Europcar claims on their site that they offer rentals to debit cards, I'm just getting a friend to confirm if this is legit. If the car rental thing does not work out, then I guess staying in hostels and hooking up with organised game drives is your best bet.  You might get lucky and find some other folks in a hostel who have access to a car and are keen to spend a night in the reserve – and you might also consider squeezing the budget a bit to spend one night with an operator that is inside the reserve fence - some of them might be willing to pick you up. E.g. these guys: http://www.sefapane.co.za/   If you're going to make it up to Phalaborwa drop me a P.M, I know some fun locals in the conservation industry, they'd be happy to grab a beer with you if the dates line up :-)  Hehe, bear in mind that the Kruger is our biggest tourist destination, so anyone with money in the game is doing their best to rank up on google searches. Here are 3 bus companies that do JHB to Nelspruit (aka Mbombela) for around R400. I think Greyhound might also do Phalaborwa.  http://www.intercape.co.za/  http://www.lowveldlink.com/  https://www.greyhound.co.za/  Translux does the Phalaborwa run but their site is pretty bad so you'll prob want to do that booking manually. http://www.translux.co.za/    Now, crime. South Africa has what the economists call a dual economy - there are such vast differences between the low income and medium-to-high income demographics that they operate largely without interaction. As a very rough guideline, most of our cities consist of economic centres, e.g. the Foreshore in Cape Town, Sandton in Johannesburg, with low income groups living on the outer fringes of this area, and then rings of of residential neighbourhoods, and then beyond that more low-income areas.  Now, given the current living conditions of our low-income population, there is a lot of violent crime, but this tends to be within the demographic - i.e. statistically, medium and high income citizens are far less likely to be victims. These incidents are also geographically concentrated to areas that are either low-income (i.e. relatively unpoliced) or close to low-income areas (think escape route).  Like I said, this is a very rough guideline, and there are plenty of exceptions, but I'm just hoping to substantiate the point that with a bit of street smarts, as a tourist you can be quite safe in South Africa. Best example: as a journo & researcher, being a tourist is my job and in 3 years & 30,000 km the worst thats happened is that I've had some stuff stolen out of my car. While on organised tours, you are very unlikely to have issues, and while driving around the Kruger yourself you are also going to be quite safe. Remember, access to the park is very well controlled.  Lastly, if you're keen for a beer or such, happy to meetup when you're in Joburg. I'm there 26th - 31st of July. And really do feel free to PM me so that I can put you in touch with some folks on the ground!"

I have a chance!"" So the best way to say no is by saying ""no thank you"" and then ignore them. Even if they keep talking. Ignore and don´t make eye contact again. It´s extremely rude but it works.

In more rural areas or off the beaten path it may be more challenging, but the majority of places will have people who speak enough English to help you get around. IMO the French were more annoyed at me trying to say anything in French (I speak English/Spanish so my French pronunciation is fucked) than they were impressed with my attempts. The Italians were much groovier about it.   Bit of advice for Rome - rent an apartment with a rooftop patio. Sunsets in that city are pretty wonderful. I had a flat near Campo di Fiori and it was a great base for the city for about the same cost as a hotel room."

I think it's something to do with the way the electricity flows. Just an interesting idiosyncracy I came across during my time there, might be helpful in case you need to ask a shop assistant for the right one :)  Italians are a lot of fun & it's a gorgeous country - you'll have a great time there I'm sure!

Oh and be aware that YHAs in Switzerland tend not to be staffed from 10am-5pm so trying to call in on the day to enquire may not be easy.

solotravel,3d1nam,Flying_Scot,2,Sun Jul 12 22:45:56 2015 UTC,Solo travelling is great because typically there's always one bed left in hostels. People don't book them because they can't stay with friends. Hostel reservations. Book as soon as you can but 3 days in advance has been sufficient for European cities during the summer for me.
solotravel,3d1nam,astro65,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:17:00 2015 UTC,What a relief. Thank you. I'll do some booking but I won't stress about booking all 5 weeks at once.

solotravel,3d1nam,stevethehomer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:10:33 2015 UTC,"I like to have a place to stay figured out before I get to a new place, because it really sucks walking around to different hostels only to find they're full up.  That being said, since you're all alone, I wouldn't expect that you'd have much trouble finding a bed if you wait until even the day before.  I rarely booked a hostel more than a week in advance on a four month trip and really didn't have much trouble.  On average, I booked about between 1-3 days in advance and rarely had problems finding a decent room.  However, since you'll be there in August and it will be busier, you may think of looking ahead a bit more."

solotravel,3d02gl,urban_myth,13,Sun Jul 12 10:02:18 2015 UTC,"I hardly drank throughout my time in Asia and met an absolute ton of people. It's really just a matter of being positive, saying hi to people and being curious. Tons of people travel solo and absolutely don't mind to strike up a conversation given a chance.   You don't need to come up with anything clever either. Just take a lot of the opportunities to strike up conversations. Enter your dorm -> ""Hi there, how's it going"". Other stuff that always works ""so hey, where are you from?"" ""How long are you travelling for?"" ""Where did you get in from/have you been so far?""   And the more you do it, the easier and more natural it becomes to meet people. Just do it :)"
solotravel,3d02gl,OneDay7a,2,Sun Jul 12 12:40:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks, where in Asia did you go?"
solotravel,3d02gl,OneDay7a,3,Sun Jul 12 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"Almost all over the place by now. Spent time in Japan, Korea, China and SEA/South of Asia.  One more piece of advice: Check your places out on hostelworld. There are definitely ""party hostels"" and they usually advertise themselves that way. Those are, obviously, not your best bet.  Likewise, a medium/small size hostel with a nice common area is worth a lot. People usually mention things like ""sociable"" or ""hard to get to know people here"" on hostelworld."
solotravel,3d02gl,foggysf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:38:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. OP, I think it really depends on what you are doing. If you go on one of the booze cruise to Ha Long Bay..it wouldn't be fun for you if you aren't a drinker and everyone is drunk. Stay out of places where drunk western tourists like to go to and you will be ok."
solotravel,3d02gl,burgandybibliophile,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"Seconding Asia. Some places are more intense (Koh Rong, Cambodia and Koh Phangnan in Thailand for example) but you can spend time in hostels in so many other places and get by without drinking. I got sick of drinking in that climate after a few months and never really had a problem abstaining."
solotravel,3d02gl,PiratePegLeg,38,Mon Jul 13 07:27:07 2015 UTC,"In my experience, if you don't want to have a ""night out"" it will be more difficult, though it also completely depends on the hostel.  I lived in a hostel in Sydney for a year, if you didn't go on the weekly pub crawl, you wouldn't meet anyone, not exaggerating. We'd get 150 people on the pub crawl, all getting drunk together, making good friends and then sticking with those friends afterwards.  I've also been in hostels that have had bars and met tonnes of people that way. You don't have to drink to sit at the bar, and no one is really going to care if you order a coke rather than a vodka and coke.  I now live in Thailand and the lifestyle here is work during the day, go to a bar on the beach at night. Half the people at the bar aren't really drinking because they have work at 6am in the morning but no one minds.  Drinking is a big part of traveling, especially for people under 30. You won't struggle to meet people but you might not feel part of the group if they all have stories from the night before and you kind of don't."
solotravel,3d02gl,PiratePegLeg,6,Sun Jul 12 12:28:09 2015 UTC,That sounds like my nightmare :( I'm hoping to meet others who are not too keen on the drinking culture on their travels.
solotravel,3d02gl,Flying_Scot,13,Sun Jul 12 15:46:10 2015 UTC,"Another reason why there is such a drinking culture is often because there isn't much else to do at night. You either watch tv or sit at a bar and have a few beers with people or have a night out.  It's especially true where I live in Thailand, there is literally nothing to do after dinner so everyone just meets up at a bar to chill out for a few hours. Half the time is has nothing to do with alcohol, bars are just ideal places to hang out."
solotravel,3d02gl,altiuscitiusfortius,10,Sun Jul 12 17:05:54 2015 UTC,Not drinking won't be a problem so long as you are still willing to go out with people. most of the time just be honest say you don't drink people will soon forget.
solotravel,3d02gl,SpontaneousDream,7,Sun Jul 12 22:44:25 2015 UTC,"I do like to drink, sometimes.  But on a four month backpacking trip, I got a little sick of it. I would still go to the hostel bar, and go on pubcrawls, I would just only drink coke, or have one beer.  Theres nothing wrong with being the sober guy, somebody has to give the cabby directions at 3am.  And I met a lot of cool people in the same situation, whose idea of hard partying was two martinis and then dancing for 6 hours."

They knew I used to run the pub crawl on a Thursday night at my hostel so Friday was basically a day off in the office. I'd nap on beanbags in the morning and Friday afternoons we'd go to the pub, all paid for by the company.  I also worked for Setanta Sports, just doing basic office work. Data entry, filing, answering calls, that kind of thing. I only got that job because back in the UK I worked for a Premiership football team and for a Super League team.  I also worked for a backpackers travel agents up in Cairns for a few months.  In Thailand I'm working as a dive instructor."

solotravel,3d02gl,GolfCartKiller,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:16:55 2015 UTC,"I love it. It's much harder work than most people think though. I work around 70 hours a week, and rarely get a real day off. There is also a massive amount of competition, so if you turn down work you stop getting asked to work, hence the hours. Also any complaint against you could potentially get your licence taken away, depending on the problem, you can also face legal action. As rare as that is.  Pay is pretty shit at the beginning because you are behind everyone else but it get's pretty decent, depending on the area of the world you are teaching.  In terms of the process, if you start at the very beginning, it looks something like:  Open Water (3 days) -> Advanced Open Water (2/3 days) -> Rescue Diver (2/3 days) -> Dive Master Training (6-12 weeks) -> Instructor training (2 weeks). All those cost around $6000 in the area I currently am, which is some of the cheapest diving in the world. Add another $1000 for your gear.  You basically never earn that money back, but in terms of a job it's amazing. I spend a few hours under water most days teaching something 90% of people absolutely love doing. It's very satisfying.  Edit: I forgot to mention how difficult it is. It's very very easy, mostly. You cannot fail any part of the process, except the Instructor part. The problem is to become an instructor has a large cost, around $2000, if you fail you have to do the course all over again, which includes paying for it all over again. Some places will ensure you don't fail by not allowing you to take the exam if they don't think you are ready, but my examiner has only failed 2 people in like 5 years. You just have to treat it like an important exam at school and really do your homework."
solotravel,3d02gl,GolfCartKiller,12,Tue Jul 14 01:00:23 2015 UTC,"I worried about the same thing last September and everything turned out to be just fine. I had a great time even though I'm also 21 and from the UK who doesn't drink. People are really friendly in hostels and are always looking to make friends.  I found some people in Amsterdam who I spent the day with. When it came to the night, they wanted to go clubbing. I'm not a fan so we just went our separate ways and met back at the hostel later on. It was no big deal, I checked out the eye film museum (which is open very late) and walked along the canals. In Brussels, I found someone to grab some food and check out the city with and in Paris, I found another football fan to go watch the PSG game.  As long as you take that first step to initiate a conversation, you'll have a good time. Some may even do that first step for you so I don't think you need to worry much and just focus on having fun."
solotravel,3d02gl,StopMakingScents,2,Sun Jul 12 14:01:39 2015 UTC,Ah I'm glad it worked out for you!! If you don't mind where abouts/how long did you go?
solotravel,3d02gl,Rummager,5,Sun Jul 12 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) and of course not! I originally planned to stay in Paris for 3 days and come back but I had such a good time, I decided to stay another 2 days there. Eventually I managed to extend my 3 day trip to over 3 weeks. So my trip went something like this.  France   Paris (5 days)   Belgium   Brussels (8 days) Ghent (1 day) Brugge (2 days) - including a short trip to the beach in Ostende. Antwerp (2 days)   Netherlands   Amsterdam  (5 days) - including 1 day each in Haarlem and Leiden.   Then I went back to London via Brussels. All in all, the trip costed me about a 1000 euros. The great thing about solo travelling is that you make your own schedule. If you love the vibes, stay. If you don't, go. You don't have to stick to a schedule. I left Ghent straight away because I didn't like it but I loved Brussels so I stayed longer. Also that city has the best kebabs I've ever had. I would have stopped in Rotterdam and The Hague just before Amsterdam but the new semester was starting soon.  Edit: Formatting."
solotravel,3d02gl,baeb66,17,Sun Jul 12 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"You know you don't have to 'drink' to go out at night, right? You can sit at the hostel's bar sipping juice or whatever you'd like."
solotravel,3d02gl,cycoboodah,14,Sun Jul 12 11:36:12 2015 UTC,"I know, but it's awkward when either people notice you're not drinking alcohol (which brings up questions, judgement etc.) or when people start getting tipsy/drunk and you're the only one sober."
solotravel,3d02gl,dirty-broke-free,17,Sun Jul 12 12:12:46 2015 UTC,I know some people who are allergic to alcohol. I suggest you use that as an excuse and absolutely nobody will blame you for not drinking when you go out.

solotravel,3d02gl,glitterlok,13,Sun Jul 12 15:43:09 2015 UTC,"Just tell them you don't drink.  If they press you, just tell them it's not your thing.  Anyone who presses you beyond that probably isn't worth your time.  I've been traveling since NYE and I stopped drinking in April because I was spending too much money and not doing anything the next day but nurse hangovers.  It is certainly easier to meet people over a few beers, but that's not always true, especially if you avoid the party hostels in favor of nicer places."
solotravel,3d02gl,glitterlok,4,Sun Jul 12 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"(which brings up questions, judgement etc.)   You must be talking about people of your age group. Older travelers (like myself - 38) don't give a fuck what you drink."
solotravel,3d02gl,BelievesItsNotButter,7,Sun Jul 12 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"Psh.  These people saying it's hard without drinking are wrong.  Let me go over my last few destinations.  Marrakech - rocked up on the first day, sat down and said hi to the person next to me.  Spent the next five days exploring with them and didn't drink once.  Rome - walked in to the hostel to find everyone at free pasta dinner.  Spent the next day exploring Rome with a guy I met at dinner and then in the following days more people joined us.  Florence - rocked up to the hostel same time as another guy, then a few hours later we were bonding over sleeping on the hardwood floor to avoid bed bugs.  Now we're at a new hostel together and just met another girl as she came into our room and we're all hanging out.  All without alcohol.    Seriously just say hi to people and start talking.  You'll find people that are travelling will have a lot of experiences to share and you will begin to have plenty too."
solotravel,3d02gl,SqueeStarcraft,5,Sun Jul 12 17:25:43 2015 UTC,"I'm allergic to alcohol, but I've not yet had a problem with trying to meet people! You could sit there with a Coca-Cola and just have the same conversations anyway. The other commenters are right, it will be a little more difficult being the only sober person in a group of drunk or tipsy people, but if you can deal with that and not feel embarrassed or shy there's absolutely no reason you can't make good friends the same way you would if everyone were drinking."

solotravel,3d02gl,zerostyle,15,Sun Jul 12 15:42:50 2015 UTC,"So I always ask this when this topic comes up...  Do you care? Is meeting people and hanging out with people part of what you want to do when traveling? There's a shitton of talk about that kind of stuff here, but there are a lot of us who have no desire to meet people - especially other travelers - when out in the world.  For some of us it's shyness. For some of us it's the lack of focus. For some of us it's not wanting to get stuck in a bubble of other foreigners and separated from the country we're visiting. For some of us it's just not something we have interest in. Whatever the reason, there are plenty of people who solotravel to be alone and have a fucking amazing time.  So what I'm ultimately saying is don't feel like your travel experience has to include hanging out with people or enjoying the nightlife. The best part of solotravel is that you get to do whatever you want, not what's in guidebooks or part of other people's agendas. This is your trip, not some poster or blogger's.  That being said, if you want to be more social, it's a great opportunity to stretch yourself and develop some of those skills without fear of long-term embarrassment if it doesn't go well. ;-)  Good luck!"
solotravel,3d02gl,funkinthetrunk,8,Sun Jul 12 13:39:45 2015 UTC,"Haha yep I do care. Although I enjoy a bit of alone time and am travelling solo I do want to meet other people and perhaps maybe hang out/join up on travels -- I will be alone but I don't want to be lonely. I also think it would be part of the fun, talking to others about their experiences and seeing people from all walks of life."
solotravel,3d02gl,Sgt_Floss,12,Sun Jul 12 15:28:06 2015 UTC,"In that case, get the fuck out there! I didn't drink for most of my life. I'm sure you're aware by now that if you don't make a big deal out of it, other people won't either. You're probably also aware that going out to bars and clubs doesn't require alcohol consumption! Meet some people, flex those social muscles, and above all be yourself!  Whatever you do, don't respond to ""let's go get some drinks"" with ""I don't drink!"" Just go...and order that ginger ale. ;-)"
solotravel,3d02gl,SuperFunk3000,4,Sun Jul 12 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"The last sentence there is key. Just say ""sure!"" and order something without alcohol."
solotravel,3d02gl,captainsmacks,2,Mon Jul 13 00:54:19 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on not really liking drinking culture. It feels like a waste of time to me and a boring concept. We're going to sit around and put liquid into our bodies? How boring.  Now that I've said that, I actually do drink now. I've realized that A) people use drinking as an excuse to hang out and talk and B) I can nurse the same drink all night, feel like I'm fitting in, and not get drunk.  I still think drinking as a concept is boring, but it is fun to hang out with and meet new people. :)"
solotravel,3d02gl,Sgt_Floss,2,Sun Jul 12 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"Not op, but I feel better about not particularly wanting to meet people.  If I happen to click with someone I'm open to that, but as an extremely shy person I find attempts at socializing to be stressful."
solotravel,3d02gl,ILostMyCdPlayer,6,Sun Jul 12 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"It definitely makes things harder, but here's some advice:   Most travel doesn't involve big clubs when you go out.  It's typically smaller dive bars, or beach bars.  Also, if you're among other travelers, it's VERY different, because everyone wants to chat each other up and is looking for conversation.  It's not like going out to a normal bar because people are so much more open. My best advice for making friends without drinking is to do a lot of activities.  Some of my closest friends on trips were those that got SCUBA certified with me, or tried rock climbing, went on bike tours, etc.  Anything that has a group of like 3-10 people where you spend a good amount of time together works."
solotravel,3d02gl,leontrotskitty,17,Sun Jul 12 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you are. European social culture is all about clubbing, partying and drinking. Don't expect to find too many people who don't want to get drunk every night. There are, but they are hard to find."

solotravel,3d02gl,leontrotskitty,11,Sun Jul 12 12:02:14 2015 UTC,You'll be fine. Many people just want to chill or explore the cities they are in. Plenty of things to do without any alcohol. And not everyone likes to go to bed at 4am.  The individuals that party all the time tend to not see the cities they are in since they wake up so late.

I've been in Thailand and Vietnam the last month and half and have had no problem meeting people. I also hate clubbing. You will meet all different types of people who like to party, just hang out, explore a lot...pretty much every type. The beauty of traveling solo is you can surround yourself with whoever you want. It's your life! If you have any other questions I'd be happy happy to answer them :)"
solotravel,3d02gl,LeBeauMonde,3,Sun Jul 12 10:37:56 2015 UTC,"May I ask the reason you don't drink? I mean, I respect that decision and I wouldn't ask you to go against it unless you reflect on this thread and decide that, weighing up the options, meeting people and socialising is more important to you. It's definitely possible to meet others and socialise without drinking when backpacking - I for one would not give a shit if you drank a coke next to me in a bar, as long as you were not disdainful of the fact that I was drinking alcohol - but it is also definitely easier to do so if you do drink. You're simply going to miss out on chances to bond and chat - bar buddies turn into temple exploration buddies the next morning.   So what I'm saying is, if the reason you don't drink is because you don't like getting drunk and the whole atmosphere of it, have you considered just getting one drink and sticking with that one drink the entire night (assuming you don't want to be the person who orders a coke)? I have to say, my experiences going out backpacking is split roughly 50/50 - half going hard and partying, half just having a beer or two with some guys on a hostel rooftop. In the latter situation, no one was even close to getting drunk, the beer was just an excuse to sit around and shoot the shit together for a while - beer was the equivalent of sitting down and getting a coffee with a friend during the day time."
solotravel,3d02gl,LeBeauMonde,6,Sun Jul 12 14:57:35 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid of being asked this question. I don't drink because of religious reasons. I'm never disdainful of other people drinking, I really don't give a shit if someone drinks and would never say anything to anyone but I've been put on the spot before by people asking why I'm not drinking and when I tell them I can tell they are not happy. If drinking happens the way you described (just sitting around talking etc) I don't mind, it's just the clubbing/getting drunk but I'm not into!"
solotravel,3d02gl,omtastic,6,Sun Jul 12 15:35:47 2015 UTC,I met a guy who didn't drink for the same reasons but he still hung out with everyone (also helped that he was very outgoing and was able to be sober among a crowd of tipsy travelers which can be tough) As far as I could tell no one cared at all/judged that he didn't drink and his reasons for it because he was just a good person to hang out and talk to. He even works at a crazy party hostel now while being sober.
solotravel,3d02gl,that90sguys,2,Sun Jul 12 18:27:46 2015 UTC,"No reason at all to be afraid of this question! Just say you'd rather not drink but you're glad they're enjoying it. It turns the conversation back on them. Also if you get a coke nobody will know it's not rum and coke, or if you get sprite or seltzer nobody will know its not a gin and tonic. They're not going to be tasting your cup."
solotravel,3d02gl,FunkyHairBalls,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, in that case just drink a coke and you'll be fine! No one is going to put you down for not drinking because of religious reasons and if they do they're a wanker you wouldn't want to hang out with anyway. If it's a big hostel you'll easily find a group that's not going out clubbing that night - some people aren't into it, and others might have something on early in the morning. They might head out to the porch or the hostel bar for a drink or two but they won't be going heavy and the fact that you're not drinking alcohol won't even be noticed. Don't fret, in the end you're still going to be in Europe surrounded by amazing things and sights - you'll have a blast"

solotravel,3d02gl,elperroborrachotoo,3,Sun Jul 12 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't drink at all till I was 33, but now I do. I used to go out to bars with my friends back then just to spend time with them, but the drunker they got, the less I could relate to them. In retrospect, I had two main problems:  (1) Drunks are uninhibited, and I was very inhibited.  (2) To a sober person, being drunk doesn't look very appealing.  Maybe there's a mindset that will let you sidestep both of those things: socializing with a purpose. Are you good at going with the flow if things take a silly or deep or crazy turn? If not, would you like to practice? Maybe this is an opportunity for you to put yourself out there with people who aren't likely to judge you and who you will probably never see again if you do embarrass yourself."
solotravel,3d02gl,joojy,3,Sun Jul 12 16:52:54 2015 UTC,You'll be fine. It may be a little harder cause there's not much else to do out at night but there's plenty of times I went out and didn't drink. By the time I got to Europe after traveling for almost a year and drinking all the time I just wanted a break. I barely partied in Italy or Paris and still met a ton of people. Just be comfortable when you meet people during the day. Don't be afraid to walk up to a table of strangers and ask if you can join them. That's the norm when traveling.

More at the hostels and guest houses where you're staying there's always people sitting together and chances are they just met that day or week. Most backpackers are very friendly. The first few times I did feel a bit awkward doing it but it's the norm. I would wake up, walk down to the common area, and politely be like hey guys mind if I join you? Most people are traveling solo. They're used to it."

solotravel,3d02gl,dbxp,2,Sun Jul 12 11:36:38 2015 UTC,I am also a solo traveler and do not drink - where are you traveling to?
solotravel,3d02gl,trabller,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:15:24 2015 UTC,Europe. Haven't decided on exact locations but I'm looking into Prague/Budapest/Italy/Turkey.   Edit: How long have you been travelling? Where to? Can you tell me your experiences of travelling and not drinking?
solotravel,3d02gl,Zweisoldner,2,Sun Jul 12 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"I did a couple of years in West Africa without problems, but that was a little different because I was occupied with a project/work much of the time. Still I made many friends.  But Europe - I am just starting my way through Europe now. About to wrap up my first stay near the city of Perugia in Italy. This is a city I would recommend. Each time I came to the actual downtown area it seemed there was something going on. I met a couple of people and stayed out very late a couple of nights. Despite many bars people generally were not consuming a lot of alcohol and no one commented on my lack of drink or got drunk in my presence.   Are you traveling through any program? I recommend Workaway.info as a great way to find places to say and groups/projects to involve yourself with. The places you stay, the interest you have in learning the language and the hours you keep all have a big influence of the sort of experience you encounter.  Personally, I enjoy a night or two to see the ""nightlife"" and how it operates, but I tend to enjoy seeing the city in the morning and adventuring/touring/working/photographing etc. during the day. As a rule the later you stay up the more people start drinking. I've embraced the role of observing and so I don't always feel compelled to jump into every activity I view - but haven't found a lack of rich experience thus far.   All of that said there was another post like this here the other day and a significant minority is in the same camp. Made me wonder if that would be a a valid subreddit to start -- something for meetups, activities etc. for those who do not want to marinate their journey in alcohol and still have a presence in the social scene.  Another thing - I used to worry about what people would think when I said I didn't drink, but I quickly decided to state it frankly. I have found that I am rarely met with anything nearing criticism. I keep a sense of humor about it and often it has led to interesting conversations. I even feel it causes people who don't drink (or don't drink much) to sort of gravitate toward me.   So far I've been in Europe almost 2 months and I've made several friends. I have no plans to return home for the next several months so I should have more to report on the matter when I've seen a few more countries and cultures."
solotravel,3d02gl,waffleisland,2,Sun Jul 12 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"Not at all! Yes, it will be harder to make friends, but you are not doomed to loneliness in your travels. Introduce yourself & make small talk with the people you come across. Decline to go out, but ask what they're doing the day after. You may not end up being friends with the people who go out all night, but it sounds like that wouldn't be a good fit anyway. You'll meet people like you, and lots who drink but don't mind if you don't. Good luck!"

As a result the type of people I meet and bond with during my travels are a different crowd, a crowd I am more in sync with, even.

Ask a group if you can sit with them in the common area, or just walk up and introduce yourself in the bar or wherever.   Don't let it rattle you...

Very easy to meet people. What do other travelers have to say about the hostel? If it gets lots of reviews saying ""my partner and I"" or ""we had a great school trip here"" you probably don't want to go there. Personally I always found it easier meeting people in smaller dorms and smaller hostels.  Don't sit on your bed with your laptop, phone, books, etc. Just ask people where they are from, how long they've been here, what the plan to do, etc. Basic stuff really.    But above all: SOMETIMES YOU WON'T MEET PEOPLE. IT IS OKAY TO BE ALONE. It is perfectly normal. Well at least for some people. Others then cry on reddit that they had to spend a day alone and that the world is a god awful place."

solotravel,3d14c9,Vagablogged,2,Sun Jul 12 18:26:11 2015 UTC,"I had the same worries the first time I traveled alone. Meeting people at hostels isn't too hard really. But it does take some effort. Make sure to ask people about their travels whenever you get a chance, because people love to talk about their travels.  My suggestions: Introduce yourself to your dorm mates every chance you get.  Talk to people at breakfast. Go on walking tours."
solotravel,3d14c9,GriLtCheeZ,2,Mon Jul 13 08:44:45 2015 UTC,"The hostel scene shouldn't be too tough if there is a decent common area.  If not, do you cook? It's easy meeting people in the kitchen.

Every hostel is different but some of them really do just encourage you to meet strangers. Also, extroverts are out there prowling the world, so often someone will simply come up and talk to you! The key thing is to motivate yourself to have fun by yourself - plan itineraries, and go and do stuff. People are less likely to be interested in your company if you're miserable. But if you're having fun, people tend to notice you :)"

TBH, sometimes I find myself anti-social, but I've come up with some strategies that help me meet people.  The best way I have found: find an airbnb with a ""private room"" where a local host is staying in the same place.  They often like travellers, and want to show them around.  I call it ""The Boasting Host"". Works a lot better if you're staying for more than a week."

solotravel,3d2ahi,beaverteeth92,3,Sun Jul 12 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"3 weeks 3k is enough.  Stockholm is amazing.  I loved it, one of my favorite cities.  Sweden was expensive, but nothing compared to Norway.  Prague was an expensive city, but I am sure outside that it might not be so bad.  If you do Poland, Krakow is a must.  It's affordable, and you can take a day trip to Auschwitz.  However, when anyone tells me they are going to Europe, the one country I say that you MUST go to is Hungary.  Budapest is unbelievable, and you can live like a king.  You could spend 7 days with food, activities, drinking all night, and lodging for 400 USD.  It's so beautiful and so much fun.  I've been to 29 countries so far, and that was by far my favorite."

solotravel,3d2ahi,Ekardz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:29:07 2015 UTC,"as long as you price the airfare carefully.  follow @theflightdeal on twitter, they also have a website.  Last week they showed round trip to europe for like 400-600.  Just book a cheap round trip starting point, and then if you have to, book a ryan air or easy jet to the country you really want to start in.  I always fly in cheapest spot and then book mine form there.   Budapest is no joke.  i am getting the itch to go right now.   Haha, when they go to Bratislava that shit cracks me up.  Miami Wise number 1 new show.  I am thinking about going there, I have heard good things about Slovakia, and it's unique appeal at that capitol.  It was never made to be a capital, so it's supposed to be interesting, and small, easy to do in a day or two.   If you stick to eastern europe you'd be good for a month...Some parts are seedy, and I don't want to label a whole country one way or another, but some can be rough.  I am headed to Slovenia for this first time in September and I've heard amazing things, and it's supposedly super cheap and safe.  There are unsafe places everywhere.  One of the worst encounters I've had anywhere was in Pigalle in France.  Auschwitz was incredible.  I am not Jewish, and I cannot forget it.  I think everyone needs to see it.  It's unbelievable what happened and how it was able to happen."

solotravel,3d2ahi,PhotoJim99,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:13:49 2015 UTC,In my research (and from experience) if you're going to Eastern Europe it'll probably be a lot cheaper to not get the pass just because the trains are already pretty cheap there. Can't speak for anywhere other than that though. You still have to pay reservation fees and certain countries are known for having notoriously high ones (like France) so watch out for that.
solotravel,3d2ahi,cunctatrix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:58:49 2015 UTC,"From where?  Figure $1,000 for airfare from North America (maybe a little less), but much less if you're nearer.  Australia, you'll probably need the full $3,000 just to get there."

solotravel,3d2ahi,kitt-cat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:31:34 2015 UTC,"Check the exchange rate with Stockholm. I went during spring break and it was actually quite reasonable because the SEK is so weak against the dollar. (I actually still have about 40 SEK leftover in my wallet that I never got around to using, which looks like is just under $5 now. Oh well, souvenirs I guess!)  I think $3000 might be doable for three weeks, but could be tight and probably depends entirely on what sort of flight deals you're looking at. Two weeks would definitely be doable. To give you an idea, I spent $1600 on my 8-day Scandinavia trip this spring (Denmark and Sweden), but we also rented a car (and we procrastinated on renting it, which cost us hundreds more than it needed to - let that be a lesson to choose your travel partners wisely! [edit - just realized I was in the solo travel subreddit... well, now you know why I'm thinking of just going myself!]) and I spent probably much more on souvenirs than the average person because my family's from Denmark and had some specific requests for things to bring back :) Without the extra expenses, it might have been $1200, with $700 of that being the flight.  Also re - round trip vs. buying tickets piecemeal - I'm looking at tickets to Europe for an August trip and even flying out of very different cities it looks like round trips are much cheaper. Guess that's probably price discrimination or something like that!"
solotravel,3d2ahi,kitt-cat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:19:50 2015 UTC,"The exchange rate is $1 to 8.49 krona right now.  I can fly to Stockholm for $1100, or to Prague for around $1200.  Leaning more towards two weeks because money right now.  I also don't drive so I'd be going by rail.  Should I buy a pass?  I also figure now is a good time because the whole Greece situation has made the dollar stronger in a lot of Europe.  And in two weeks, will I be able to fit Budapest in, or do you think it's too far out of the way?  I don't want to spend like my whole trip traveling."

The visa applications I've seen asking for this were asking for itineraries - not actual exit tickets - which some countries -do- ask for.  If it's just itinerary, make an itinerary.  Some countries even ask you for every damn hotel you plan to stay in.    To some extent, it depends how important it is for you to get in.  Personally, if was turned away from Zimbabwe, I would have just gone to Zambia and it would not be a big deal to me.  But for some people, depending on plans, it can be a big enough deal to make sure you follow rules 100%.  In some cases, when it was important to me, I did end up booking $60-100 cheapest tickets I could find.    The best advice is advice that is very recent and specific to Nicaragua.  Different countries operate different and rules and enforcement change.

Check out their website. I stayed 2 nights and it was amazing."

solotravel,3cyw0f,InvoluntaryEyeroll,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:06:45 2015 UTC,"Don't skip places.  There are usually tricks.  Wake up early, eat dinner late, and siesta mid-day, especially in small cities like Venice.  Get passes (like the Roma Pass) to skip lines.  Go to the things you want to see most.  Go at the right hour.  Right hour at a crowded top-tier place will be more enjoyable than less crowded crappier place.  Another strategy is see something interesting that isn't in the city center (island of Burano in Venice, afternoon at the beach in Rome, day trip to Siena from Florence, Montmartre in Paris, etc) between like 1 and 4.  See one interesting thing in the morning and one more in the afternoon.  For example, a day in Rome: AM Colosseum/Roman Forum, PM Go to Beach, Night Trevi Fountain/Spanish Steps.  I'd book hostels a week in advance if you don't want to be tied down.  Trains, on the other hand (the rides that are 1 hour plus), you'll need to book earlier if you don't want to pay a ton."

solotravel,3cyw0f,tethys89,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:47:36 2015 UTC,"Train passes are ok for some countries, but less useful for others - Switzerland I think is very easy with one (no reservations needed, no supplementary fees), France and Italy much less so (reservations needed for most long distance journeys, some supplementary fees, quotas on some French trains).  There's also the risk that a pass won't be cheaper than just buying a walk-up ticket for each journey you make.  The man in seat 61 is generally the best source of info for railways/tickets/passes, certainly for Europe."

You buy groceries at the store. You pay bills. Every so often, or when you're trying to fall asleep at night, you think ""damn, I could've been in Prague right now."" or ""why did I chicken out of travelling?"" or ""I wish I'd gone on that trip"" or ""life is passing so quickly and I'll never be able to really travel.""   Take a deep breath.  Imagine it's four months from now.  You're in your third European country, walking along in a bustling market, contemplating where to go next. You have no rent to pay, no job to wake up for in the morning, no set schedule. You can try foods you've never heard of, make friends for a weekend, get lost and lonely occasionally, get a tan, learn about a new culture, and go to sleep at night thinking ""I'm so glad I finally did this. Everybody else is missing out"" and probably even ""I can't believe I was so scared!""   Everybody has second thoughts before making a big decision. Everybody. I heard this awhile ago: ""If your dreams don't scare you a bit, they're not big enough."" And ""doubt kills more dreams than failure does.""  ""The encouraging thing is that every time you meet a situation, though you may think at the time it is an impossibility and you go through the tortures of the damned, once you have met it and lived through it you find that forever after you are freer than you ever were before. If you can live through that you can live through anything. You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, `I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' The danger lies in refusing to face the fear, in not daring to come to grips with it. If you fail anywhere along the line, it will take away your confidence. You must make yourself succeed every time. You must do the thing you think you cannot do."" — Eleanor Roosevelt  Which do you want to be you, when winter rolls around this year?

I often keep myself up at night worrying that I'm making the dumbest decision of my life by leaving an incredibly good career.  It's hard to put aside the career-focused mindset that I was raised with, and do something different, even though I think it's the right thing for me personally.  I started thinking about doing this sort of thing at your age, and I backed off of it a few times because of the career concerns.  What I've learned in the 4 years since is that the desire to do this never really goes away, and it's harder and harder to do it as you get older.  The pressure to settle down and focus on your career just gets greater from here on.  Traveling is great at any age, but it can be a little harder to connect with the core backpacking crowd and enjoy the whole lifestyle the older you get.  So if you can get away with it, go now.

solotravel,3cxukx,uspn,3,Sun Jul 12 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"I am a a good 7 years older than you and have been through the same thing you are going through now twice. In sept I will be quitting my job and am off on another adventure. I am off to eastern Europe too coincidentally in September.  I can't speak for everyone but the time spent travelling has been the best part of my life.   I am still nervous though, and still apprehensive about handing in my notice. The thing is I have a plan. It is a simple plan, it just involves working until Sept, quitting and going travelling. Anything large can be broken down into baby steps like walking, left foot right foot, the body will follow. If you have already decided you are off travelling then just concentrate on the small things, researching where you want to go, things do do and stay, food to eat.  Uncertainty is one of the biggest causes o0f fear, and being alone in a  different country sure causes a lot of uncertainty. For me though that is part of why I do it, my life here is easy, routine and I need a break from it.  My advice is to just accept that you are nervous and do it anyway. On my first trip I got dropped off at the airport my my mun#m and I was so nervous I couldn't talk to her, she thought I was mad at her or something. A few days in I realized not only that I can do it but then I am actually doing it, and that it is easy. The world is not as scary as you think and most people are nice."

solotravel,3cxukx,alexstepka,2,Sun Jul 12 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"Up until a few days before leaving home, I was looking forward to my first real trip into the world more than I had ever done to anything else. Then a sceptic suddenly showed up in my head. He told me that if I stayed at home, I would know exactly what next week would be like, and wouldn't that be nice? If I went travelling, on the other hand, absolutely nothing would be certain regarding my well-being by the end of the week. The only thing I knew was that in the country I was going to visit first, people spoke a language I didn't understand, and if I got in trouble, I would also be the only one who could get me out of it. And what about the food? Something I like to eat very much, cow, would be hard to come by on a plate, as they were considered sacred where I was going! How would I fare in such a place?  Relatives and friends didn't offer much comfort. They willingly told me all kinds of stories about horrible things that had happened to naive Norwegians abroad. I don't know why, but people seem to believe that everything is much more dangerous everywhere else than where they live themselves. When confronted with something we're not familiar with, we automatically perceive it as risky until the opposite has been proved. The burden of proof is unfortunately often placed on the news desks of our TV channels and newspapers. When that monster unwillingly lifts its head above what happens in its own backyard, it will usually only cover disturbing stories with significant elements of catastrophe, war, poverty and distress.  I'm not saying that it's safe to go everywhere. Some places you should stay away from, and common sense will go a long way in telling you which places those are. Norwegians think themselves tough and special for living in a cold country in the Arctic. In other countries other people similarly seem to pride themselves for their ability to survive in the surroundings they have been given. Most places are safe both to live in and to visit, as long as you know what you're doing.  If someone brags about how dangerous it is where they live, maybe you should go somewhere else. More likely, you will be fine going even to that city or that country. Just stay away from where the trouble is. Read up on it. Ask travellers and locals on the Internet what you should do. When you're ready, go out and explore!  Now, this is of course easy to say for someone who has travelled like this a few times. But during the last days and especially the nights before I left home alone for the first time, inside I was trembling with fear for my uncertain future on the road. I still told people that I looked forward to my trip, although I almost didn't sleep at night. All I could think about was how on earth I could go ahead and do something I knew so little about.  What settled it in the end was exactly the thought that if I didn't go, I really could predict what next week would be like. Although my life at home was good, I felt ready to go out and discover things I never had seen before. To do that, I would simply have to seek out strange places. So I left, although I was really nervous.  As soon as my trip began, all my fear was replaced by curiosity. New experiences hit me in a seemingly never-ending row, allowing me neither time nor reason to be anxious about travelling.  Just a few days after leaving Norway, I had dinner on the roof of a Buddhist monastery outside Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. On the street below me a scarred troupe of travelling knife throwers performed, and on the horizon to the north I could see the snowy peak of Mount Everest glowing in the light from a setting sun. The food I ate was rice and lentil soup served on fresh banana leaves. Everything was new to me, and I couldn't have cared less about what life would have been like if I had stayed at home. All I had to think about was to keep my eyes, ears and nostrils open, and to keep track of where I kept my money and my passport. If I did that well, the next six months would be a great experience. And it was a great experience, despite the food poisoning, cyclones, snake blood, insect bites and other small disasters that came as part of the package.  I cannot tell you what you should do. All I can say is that if you want to travel, do it while you still can take care of yourself and there is not too much else you have to care for. You can find opportunities to do this throughout most of your life, but that is not an excuse to delay the departure. The world is a big place with more to see than you can ever cover in your lifetime."

solotravel,3cxukx,beaconj015,2,Sun Jul 12 17:32:52 2015 UTC,Without trepidation..there is no growth.  3-4 months from now when you are talking to your friends and/or family about this experience; they will say they wish they could do what you do..and they will say there is something different about you.  It's nothing more than the confidence to do what you want for yourself that is totally out of their element..and it's liberating to test yourself and be on your own schedule.  As a 44/m that started traveling a year ago because of a forced business trip..I so so wish I did the solo traveling when I was in my 20's. I'm making up for it now.   It's lonely at times..but you learn that there are friendly people at the most unlikely of places. And if it doesn't feel right..ditch out to the nearest familiar sight..take as many deep breathes as you need..and get on with the journey.

solotravel,3czokb,captain_wiggles_,2,Sun Jul 12 08:26:42 2015 UTC,"As others said, check with your airline. But FYI, volcanic ash is very bad for jet engines, even the little bit of dust in the air can enter a jet engine, and essentially melt and turn to glass, damaging or causing the engine to stop working. As a precaution ALL flights will likely be cancelled or diverted away from any ash particles, and these delays can last for days.

I was there on my own for 4 days and I loved getting to know all the different neighbourhoods and hidden squares. If you're planning on staying in hostels I can't recommend La Banda Rooftop Hostel enough. Seriously one of the best Hostels in Europe with such great staff and accommodations! I booked hostels a couple weeks in advance generally, but if you're going somewhere during a busy tourist time - like in Barcelona with a big festival - I might look to do it earlier.  Barcelona was another great city to see, but you really don't need 2 whole weeks there. Seville is an entirely different feel, and really easy to get to from Madrid! Granada is a fun place to do a couple nights if you're looking for a beautiful stop. Just go see the caves and eat some good food."

If you do go, make sure to pre-book a ticket to go to the Alhambra. You can probably see the city in 1-2 days. As far as going out and experiencing the nightlife, you have a ton of options with the discos and tapas bars.  I was only in Cádiz for a day for Carnaval but the view of water from the wall around the coast is breathtaking. If you do go to Córdoba, make sure to go to La Mezquita! The layout of the building is amazing. If you're into Spanish art (specifically El Greco), I would recommend a day trip to Toledo. It's an hour outside of Madrid. They have the Museo del Greco and you can also go see The Burial of Count Orgaz in la Iglesia de Santo Tomé.   If you're traveling by bus, I highly recommend https://www.alsa.es. It was super convenient for day trips.   Spain is one of my favorite things to talk about so feel free to PM me! I'd rather not write a novel on here."

It is a shared sentiment among many and I even noticed it when I lived in the UK. I must say though that it just seems to be a matter of manners, French people are not rude per se, quite the opposite, they just seem to take longer to warm up to new people than in other countries.   For me the key was to sort of getting in a ""I'm taking none of your shit"" mode. If the French see you are bothered by their ways they will chew you up, if you act unfazed you will kinda earn their respect. This post reads a bit superficial and slightly racist but I guess it was the only way to make my point."

Wear a smile and act amused for finding yourself in such a predicament. In my experience this will make their own self-defensive mechanism ineffective.

There is a huge chance the people you talked to did not understand you and/or were unable to answer. We are invaded by tourists in summer, Paris has become a museum (and an unaffordable one). Most people live outside the city, might not know it well and tend to forget that not everyone is used to the subway (especially those who have to travel for another hour to go home), so please don't take it personally. Also waiters are rude, to everyone, that's a law. Young people will be happy(-ier) to help and show you the city, forget anyone over 40. We are arrogant and we believe we do things better.

solotravel,3cxm5p,mattdev,5,Sat Jul 11 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"Local here, I think she is wildly exaggerating, some parts of Paris are a museum, most are not, 99% of people living here know the city and have a normal daily life in Paris. Locals navigate socially just fine, just as you would yourself in your hometown, however I think the culture gap might be bigger with France than any other European country, and many foreigners interpret it as rudeness. To me people here are very open and friendly, and I do my best to be friendly to strangers.   It's also a very stressful city because of the hustle, a bit like New-York (no wonder New-Yorkers and Parisians usually love each other) which makes people more likely to dismiss foreigners or strangers in general because of the constant over solicitation.  Anyways, I think it is more contextual than a problem that lies within ourselves, we have idiots, we have nice people, it's very hard to generalize a whole city or population. I hope your experience will get better.   PS: the reason why you're getting hell in this thread is because you said ""I'm starting to hate the French"" instead of saying something like ""can anybody help me understanding the French"" - which makes people think your own attitude might have been a factor initially. I don't personally give a shit but yes that's a poor way to start your debate, and it somehow made me feel less inclined to help."
solotravel,3cxm5p,Bobtbob,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're expecting from your experience; what would you like to do or see in Paris?   Be aware that language will be a problem, because really we suck at foreign languages. There is nothing to do about that. Also, people do not have the time and will not take the time unfortunately. My advice is to get out of the touristic places, forget about them and try to go where Parisians are. It will be harder language-wise but a lot more interesting and rewarding for you. In the Louvre, you're a cash cow, nothing more. Don't bother about Champs-Elysées either.   Try and take the bus if you can (no one will speak a word of English, but it's less stressful and smelly than the metro).   What I do when someone is rude to me is smile like the biggest idiot on earth and get the hell out. It doesn't make them nicer but at least it stops the aggression."
solotravel,3cxm5p,bcs00002,6,Sat Jul 11 21:04:43 2015 UTC,"Let me give you a tip for handling the French. The so called ""rudeness"" or ""dismissive nature towards tourists"" will go away with this secret strategy.   Never, I repeat, NEVER EVER start an interaction, or respond to an initial interaction, in anything BUT French. Try and continue the conversation as long as you possibly can in French.   Eventually they will cave and start speaking English to you, but the longer you keep up the French speaking, the better. I don't speak shit for French, but I would learn a few phrases and try my best to convert English/Portuguese words into their French counterparts and I was treated with nothing but respect. Even in Paris. It was a bit more difficult to pull this off in the rural areas of France where English isn't as widely spoken, but I guarantee that you'll make progress if you at least make an effort.   I now do this in every country I travel to where I don't speak the language and have never had a single issue."

When I was in Costa Rica, I overheard an American girl ask this couple I was sitting behind something in English, and they responded that they didn’t speak English.  A few minutes later, the guy starts looking around like he needs something, we make eye contact so he asks me in perfect English if I knew how to say some basic phrase in Spanish.  I told him how to say it, and we had a conversation in English where he revealed they were from Quebec.  It's one thing to be annoyed with english speaking tourists in your own country, but he was the english speaking tourist and still behaved this way."

And I don't think having your city descended on by tourists is an excuse for rudeness, especially as Paris is hardly unique in that respect. I am a little biased because I got some nasty comments from Parisians when I was there, even though I worked very hard at being polite and traveled with several French speakers.  Getting on with does seem like good advice, though. If OP doesn't like Paris, maybe the itinerary can change. There's a lot to see and do in France and many welcoming communities."

We did have a great stay at a big hotel there - I wish I could remember the name for you.  Again, I really enjoyed most of France and if you ever think about going back the south of France is especially nice (but expensive). Honestly if I go again I wouldn't bother to include Paris unless I had to fly in or out there, and I would try hard to go with someone who had decent French skills."
solotravel,3cxm5p,mishimishi,3,Sun Jul 12 05:19:29 2015 UTC,"Parisians are known for being unfriendly, intolerant, and closed-minded, even among the French. Basically, deal with it, there are good people of all groups, creeds, races, etc.  Try learn a few basic stock phrases, and don't adopt the entitled attitude that your post seems to convey.   The reason those S.E Asian countries (and those 'ass-end of the Third World' countries) welcome English speaking people besides history and generally having a friendlier culture, a lot of their money comes from tourism and foreigners. This is why many will probably speak French as well.  You can learn something about the country and the people by detachment and observation  e.g.    The difference in the service-proprietor relationship (e.g. Waiters/Shop staff and customers are on an equal footing unlike many countries where the balance in power is more in favour of the customer) National sentiments and quirks - attitudes towards their fellow citizens, integration, topics of concern Diet / eating style - smaller portions, high quality, allegedly fattening foods (an aversion to low fat products, but notice the low number of fat people - usually tourists)   This will make your stay more enjoyable."

I do know that Parisiennes are formal, and that some of their respectful behaviors can come across to people from other places as rude or snobby, but that's the opposite of what is intended. My advice would be next time someone acts toward you in a way that you interpret as rude, see if you can re-interpret it as being ultra-polite. This will probably be most applicable to shop clerks and waitstaff. If nothing else, you might enjoy your trip more."

There's excellent museums in both cities; good food, lots of music and culture too. There's a ton of festivals, particularly in Edinburgh.  I would recommend getting up to the Highlands if you can (base out of Inverness maybe). I'd suggest renting a car and doing a drive - I did a loop from Edinburgh to Inverness to Aberdeen and back to Edinburgh going all along the coast. A TON of castles to stop at, some seriously beautiful nature.   There's some tours that take you up to the Orkney and Shetland Islands, which is the one thing I wish I had been able to do.  You could also go west of Glasgow and check out that area. Unfortunately I didn't get past Aryshire but there's lots to see.

I also spent a lot of that time getting gloriously plastered on buckets, you could do it a lot cheaper if you wanted to (but hey, your only 23 once).  That being said australia is expensive. if you have accommodation with your grandma then that's a good start, but your really gonna be spending a lot of cash quickly in aus. I'm talking $200+ a week easilly (especially if you don't have accommodation). Source: I'm Australian. it's easy to spend $500+ a week but if your tight you could do it a lot cheaper.   One other thing, you mentioned you have had some mental health problems recently. Make sure you are on top of it before you leave and have enough meds to last you throughout asia, it can be tricky to get antipsychotics there and stress/anxiety/poor sleep can exacerbate mental health problems.

solotravel,3cxu2j,TheJohnM96,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"To make the money last long: get out of Phuket. Their taxi mafia is intense (daylight robbery and also possibly actual robbery if you're unlucky), gross old men paying young Thai women for their company, expensive accommodation... not great. You can generally get 1000 AUD a month for Asia if you spend sensibly. Australia is substantially more costly but you'll have a great time if your accommodation is with free with family. 10k is a crazy large amount - you can stretch that insanely far if you don't drink hard and remember that a day of transit will always cost double than staying in one place.  Cambodia is great and your money seems to go further there than in Thailand, but maybe my perception was slightly biased because I was there for 6 weeks.  Cliffs notes of cool destinations:  Cambodia: recommend Kampot (gorgeous river and mellow pace of life) and Siem Reap (suspiciously cheap partying relative to everywhere else). Koh Rong is good too (crazy partying but expensive, no ATM on the island so make sure to get cash out before you get there. Also - ""whatever can Koh Rong will Koh Rong!"")  Thailand: Koh Tao for diving (not so cheap but so good. I was with Big Blue and they were awesome), Koh Lanta (mellowing out, cave exploring and mushrooms), Pai (stoner hippie town), Chiang Mai (like a better mini-city than Bangkok).  Myanmar's also amazing to check out for a cultural trip less so than partying, but accom is expensive if you're not bunking with someone else because hostels aren't so common outside of the capital. Highly recommend Bagan (ancient temples > any other temples in Southeast Asia), Hpa-An (slow river life, not so touristy), Inle Lake (awesome food, huge lake, lots of local culture to immerse but touristy enough to be comfortable). My favourite country for sure.  Vietnam: Ha Long Bay (overnight boat, party atmosphere, also super pretty and novel), Hanoi (barely-controlled chaos that's just awesome), Hoi An (master tailors - bring them a garment and they can replicate it effortlessly/can cheaply tailor ANYTHING), Ho Chi Minh (meant to be ace for partying but I didn't use it for that).

You might have to go through some motions to pretend you're interested in working out or joining."

solotravel,3cvpqb,yunomakerealaccount,2,Sat Jul 11 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"I spent over two months driving around the US and slept mostly in my car. In some bigger cities I found hostels (including one in Chicago, the Wrigleyville hostel) but otherwise I slept mostly in my car or camped. I used this app to find Walmart parking lots to sleep in. Most Walmarts allow it, but some have signs posted saying no overnight parking. The app gives reviews of the Walmarts and parking lots and gives tips, like calling ahead or where to park.   Rest stops are another good place to sleep although they are a bit more sketchy and depending where you are they have time limits, along the east coast most had security and 2-4 hour max limits."
solotravel,3cvpqb,TheCockPuncher,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:41:15 2015 UTC,"walmart will let you sleep in their parking lot. also, look for places that are open 24 hours (like a gym). they will likely expect a car or two in the parking lot at all hours so one more won't arouse any suspicion.   when i've done this i've just pulled into a neighborhood late at night and parked. likely no one will notice as long as you don't park on the same street repeatedly.  the issue you'll have is finding a bathroom to use. if you're on the outskirts of town you might be near a truck stop. or you could pay to join a gym for a few days."

Stay a few days in Mostar and take the tour through Hostel Majdas, it's incredible. I can say for transportation in the Balkans, it's not necessary to book ahead. Just show up and buy a bus ticket from Dubrovnik to Mostar. There are private transfers from Mostar to Kotor, you avoid a few border crossings and you save a few hours off the journey, and I believe it costs the same as a bus. Ask your hostel about it, they'll have more information."

solotravel,3culjm,Wedacucumbas,4,Fri Jul 10 22:17:44 2015 UTC,"$10,000 for 3 months is very generous and depending on your lifestyle can be stretched quite far.   If you plan to stay beyond 3 months, renew the British passport.   Unless you're traveling around every couple days with no plan, the eurail pass is usually not worth it. You will find cheaper flights/busses majority of the time. If you get a pass, it feels like you have to use it to get your money's worth.   No plan is always the best strategy for long term solo trips in my opinion. Things change so often and certain places may capture your attention for longer/shorter. An example in my case was that I didn't even plan to go to Spain/Portugal this trip, but plans change and I went there instead of France/Belgium. Funny enough, Spain(Barcelona specifically) ended up being my favorite country.   I finish 3 months here in about 2 weeks, so if you have any questions let me know."

solotravel,3culjm,MEL_GIBSONS_ASS,0,Fri Jul 10 23:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, renew the passport, better to do it now rather than later. You might just decide to stay somewhere. ;)   The three month pass I feel is worth it, it offers a lot of freedom and busses really suck, and I hate the hassle of budget airlines and airport security. I mean trains are slower, but much more relaxing and if you have three months, take your time to go places.   If you have an EU passport, which you do, you can get the youth global pass if youre in the age range but also the pricing for EU nationals is much less (or used to be) than for foreigners. Very much worth looking into.   Ive also personally used fake interrail global passes (this probably isnt allowed to be talked about here) with no issues. 100EUR  for one month travel is HUGE savings.   But, yeah I think interrail passes are cheaper for EU nationals. I dont know if youve done those budget airlines, but they are a fucking hassle. Yeah its 20EUR, but the flight is at 4am in an airport 150km from the actual city you are travelling to, and theres no public bus or trail service there so you have to sleep in an airport or pay more to take some shuttle bus for another 20EUR the ryanair 'Oslo' airport is like an hour and a half away and it costs like 40NEK which is not cheap. Those flights are doable if you want to skip a huge amount of space, but the train is much easier I feel.   Winging it is a good idea, especially over that time frame. People who plan out everything and need to see every supid church or tourist attraction miss out on a lot of cool parts of travel. Say you meet someone and they are going to prague and you were going to budapest, would you rather go alone or have a new adventure with a fellow traveller? Budapest can wait its not going anywhere.   oh and for sure leave money for when you get home."
solotravel,3cuaqc,acidus1,4,Fri Jul 10 20:56:53 2015 UTC,"You only have £2000. Spending £2500 would mean you come back with a debt you can not pay back for the foreseeable future. You might be fine, but everyone who has ever been in debt has tried that and failed.  I am not sure how UK cards issue fees but you might get dinged with significant foreign transaction fees. You would also want to let the issuer know you are using it abroad so they don't shut it down as stolen.  IMO it is much more financially healthy to understand you only have £2000 and use the card as if it was cash. Treating it is as a mystery fun fund from the future is a bad idea."
solotravel,3cuaqc,Robust_Robot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:40:57 2015 UTC,"1) You may want to consider yourself only having 1500 for those remote regions, in an account you can access with a debit card, taking out 250 from ATMs along the way. Carrying more cash than that anywhere is asking for trouble. 2) You could put the other 500 in a savings account along with whatever funds you intend to make the minimum CC payment. Then you can charge that 500 with no worries, and if you go slightly over it there's much less hanging over your head. 3) Going abroad with only one CC is a recipe for disaster.  You need at least two, preferably AmEx and Visa, in case one is randomly declined or stolen. 4) You don't specify what your CC limit is, but utilizing over 30% of your total revolving credit will impact your score. So if your limit is 2000, 500 is reasonable. 5) Have fun!"

After ramadan (since no one serves alcohol during that time), have a drink while watching the sunset at ""Le cabestan"", beautiful view. there are many things to do..  honestly, you have no reasons not to enjoy your stay, please let me know what you liked the most and what you didn't like after your trip! have fun and don't hesitate to message me if you need an advice or something else!!! :) peace."
solotravel,3ct8d4,princessstamtam,8,Fri Jul 10 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"Adding onto the taxi driver comment. After travelling in Morocco about two weeks I came to realize that it's customary to share the cab with other passengers (at least this seems to be the local way to do things). You can always ask the other passenger how much you think you should be paying. I'm pretty sure cabbies don't give specific charges, you pay what is fair, as long as you allow the cabbie to pick up and drop off people while you're in the cab."

solotravel,3ct8d4,princessstamtam,3,Fri Jul 10 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"I know you are Moroccan but from what I saw there wasn't a specific charge. It's impossible to keep an accurate meter running when there are several passengers getting picked up and dropped off at different times. Again, I know you're Moroccan, but I'm pretty sure everyone was paying based off an honor code of what they thought was fair. I definitely just paid whatever I wanted at least once."

solotravel,3ct8d4,thethirdcoast,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:50:50 2015 UTC,"Morocco is quite ambitious for a first trip, but their tourist infrastructure is decent so you should be fine.  Ramadan has a few days to run yet. Be sure to be extra patient and polite with local people. Also, do not eat or drink in public because you could get in trouble with the authorities.  French is handy, but try to pick up some of the local Arabic/Berber depending on who you're speaking to.  Only take official taxis from the stand at the airport and hotel. They should have a medallion on the door and an official rate card for typical journeys, wait times, etc. These are not that outrageous when you do the currency conversion.  Note the official rates are the tourist rates, and you will always get charged those unless you have the right complexion and are fluent in the language. Works the same around the world.  The only way to beat the taxi rate is to make a local friend, then have them hail/meet the cab so the driver sets the local rate. I've done this in neighboring Algeria, and the local rate is about 10% of the tourist rate."

A large percentage of my drivers have gotten lost, often first thing when starting out (can't get out of the city they picked up in) or when arriving (they can't find the drop off location). 2 hour delays before departure have been common and they're always outdoors. The bussed themselves are nice though.  Greyhound: Other passengers are crazy. Worst customer service you'll ever experience, probably in large part because of the level of crazy they deal with, but also they seem to be genuine assholes, the kind where you ask them a question (like ""what gate does this bus leave from"") and they ask you 8 in return then refuse to tell you.

Getting to Key Largo from Miami is a bit of a pain in the ass by bus (4 hours with a bunch of stops), but at about $6 it's much cheaper than the shuttle, which is a direct two hour ride for $90ish.   Marathon Key and Ramrod Key are great for snorkeling (take a party boat out to Sombrero Reef or Looe Key for $25) and Key West is just an all out shit show of a party town with live music, street performers, no public container laws, etc."

If you look online for hotel/motel accommodations, all you'll mostly find are $100 rooms. BUT as you make your way south on Route 1, you'll see a ton of hotels with rents at $50. It might be hard to spot them if you're traveling by bus, so keep your eyes peeled. There are also a handful of campgrounds where you might pay anywhere between $35 - $70. I recommend [https://www.floridastateparks.org/hours-and-fees/Bahia-Honda](Bahia Honda) because it's right on the edge of Marathon, it's one of the cheaper grounds, and it's beautiful. There's one on Long Key, too.  Key West tends to be more expensive but you need to go for at least one or two days. If you're going to splurge on a $100 room, this is the place. On the other hand, there's a hostel right off of Duval Street, which is the main strip. I've never stayed there but the rates are $45ish/night for a mixed dorm. If you're really adventurous, you could also just pass out on the beach, since  there are public shower/bath facilities there. Bars close at 4am and you only have about an hour to float around until sunrise, at which point you can just lay down in the sand until 12pm.  Edit: I don't know why I can't link correctly anymore but just copy that URL."

solotravel,3cs4zw,decavolt,2,Sun Jul 12 09:30:21 2015 UTC,"There are trains that go up to NYC from Miami, and of course, there is also the bus.    My days of hitch hiking in the UK are long long past, but I would say that here in the US I would NEVER want my son to hitch rides.  Not having a car can make it difficult to get around in cities that don't have a good transportation system, like Miami.  On the other hand, a bike will work very well here.  And, you want to leave plenty of time for NYC, and there a car is a hindrance anyway.  When you get to Miami, if you can find a way to get there, I recommend the Keys.  I like Bahia Honda State Park, where you can camp very near the beach and watch the sun set over the ocean.  As you head up north in Florida, especially if you like nature, there are natural springs that are very beautiful, my favorite is Blue Springs.  Florida state parks are very inexpensive and often have camping.  Wildlife in Florida is abundant.  All the beaches in FL are great, and if you like lonelier beaches rather than more populated ones, head up the coast a ways, away from the Miami-Ft Lauderdale areas.  Sounds like a great trip!  I hope you enjoy every minute of it."

People who are driving to certain destinations athemselves  offer up  their car for you anyone to come along for free or sometimes just to split gas.    I also wouldn't hitchhike here in the US but maybe some of that is due to the fear culture that is so prevalent here.     Also!  You can sometimes get lucky and find a car rental for $30 a day with unlimited mileage to put on it. It can double as sleeping quarters if needed and can take you to more remote national parks more easily if you decide to dip  more central into the country."
solotravel,3cs4zw,decavolt,2,Fri Jul 10 13:59:10 2015 UTC,"Between DC -> Baltimore -> Philly -> NYC I'd just uses buses or trains.  (Avoids parking, and buses are cheap.  For example, a 1-way bus between DC to NYC is around $30, but takes 5hrs vs a 3hr train ride at $80-$100).  Below that you'll probably want a car.

solotravel,3ctkd4,Zesprix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"Most likely you'll only need your passport. Flying to the U.K you will only need a passport to get a 6 month visa. Be prepared to show other travel documents as you go through border control though (hotel reservation confirmation, and a ticket showing transportation out of the country.) You can get away with not having a return ticket or a ticket to another country, but you will need to be very upfront about where you will be going and for how long. If the countries you are going to are part of the Schengen zone you will only need your passport when you enter the zone, and when you exit. I never went to a non-schengen country, so if you are, I would suggest going to the country's tourism site and reading what they require. Also try the U.S state department.   On another note, when going to Turkey you apply for a visa online, costs $20, and is ready instantly. I did mine the night before a flight from Brussels to Istanbul.  Be sure to also travel with another form of I.D. This is useful in many settings. U.S drivers license will do."

solotravel,3ct2ci,Craafty16,2,Fri Jul 10 21:36:30 2015 UTC,Asking the right questions.
solotravel,3ct2ci,votriminh,3,Fri Jul 10 21:44:26 2015 UTC,"I'm debating whether to stay in hostels or Airbnb. I'm not much of a party person, but I'm willing to be social. I primarily want to meet people who are traveling to experience the culture, see the sites, etc. All the hostels I can find are youth hostels. I'm 26 yo so I'll probably feel old in those environments.   Age won't be an issue. Plus you're never obligated to party or do anything you wouldn't be comfortable doing, you'll be fine.   Even though I want to see multiple cities, I heard it's really easy to get around the Netherlands since it's so small. Would it be possible to have Amsterdam as my ""home base"" and then travel by train or bike to the other cities? Does that sound feasible?   Basing yourself in one place then doing day trips is exactly what I'd do if I were you. Taking trains makes things a piece of cake so the next thing is to cut down your ideas for day trip cities to maybe 3 maximum. A day trip to Brussels is definitely doable.   How do cell phones work if you have a US-based carrier? I have T-mobile. I haven't been out of the US in almost a decade, so I'm at a loss. Can I buy a cheap pre-paid phone?   T-Mobile does work for light web browsing, emails or IM clients like whatsapp, but that's about it since data is capped to 2g speed when internationally roaming. Your international roaming is free with T-Mobile, but I would rather unlock a phone and pick up a sim at the airport to have higher speeds.   http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Netherlands   How much would the fare be to take the train from Amsterdam to Brussels? How long is the ride?   Easily answered by doing a little more research :) http://www.seat61.com/international-trains/trains-from-Amsterdam.htm   Do any of the cities I mentioned have cheap/free tours?

solotravel,3ct2ci,homophobicgalleta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:35:00 2015 UTC,"26 is not that old, there are so many ages in hostels you won't feel like the weird one out. Also this is a great way to get to know other people and maybe go on some trips together. It is indeed very easy to get around, check www.9292.nl/en for public transportation information. You could use Amsterdam as your home base, but that would mean that you have less time to explore the other cities if you want to make it back every day; Maastricht is about 3 hrs from Amsterdam so you might want to consider staying there or going really early - kind of depends on what you want to see and what you want to get from the trip.  I think so.. I had an American friend who used his T-Mobile in Milan, but I think he had some specific settings so it wouldn't cost him a bunch. T-Mobile is a big carrier here so you can always pop into one of their shops - but it might be cheaper to check with your American one first whether you can set it to worldwide coverage or smt.  The official traintickets are from what I can tell about 42 euros (depending on the time that you leave it can be more expensive) but then you have the fancy international train (for more info to got www.ns.nl/en this is the website from the Dutch Train Company). It might actually be cheaper to get the Dutch train from Amsterdam to Roosendaal, a city close to the Belgian border, which is 20.80 euros and then switch to the Belgian train network there to get to Brussels. I cant see how much that is because the Belgian website just keeps giving me errors, but I remember doing it like this a few years ago because this was the cheaper option. To be fair I had a special festival ticket at the time so you might want to double-check this.  Amsterdam definitely has tours, the rest are not that touristy. I am from Rotterdam so I know there are a few but couldn't recommend you anything as I don't take them haha. If you want a good hostel in Rotterdam go for King Kong Hotel, they were no 7 in the Hostelworld awards for 2014 :)"
solotravel,3csgfr,divermick,2,Fri Jul 10 12:08:41 2015 UTC,"60 euros per day will be enough.. stay in hostels, cook some meals, do free activities.. you will be fine :D"
solotravel,3csgfr,phyy23,2,Fri Jul 10 17:56:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say you're good for the Balkan countries, but I can't comment on the cost of private rooms as I don't book these unless there's an actual need. I have a feeling the cost of these alone could push you a lot closer to hitting/passing the 60 per day."
solotravel,3csgfr,CantLookUp,2,Fri Jul 10 18:29:38 2015 UTC,"I'll speak for the countries I've been to. Also, I did my eastern Europe travel from late November to January of 2014/15 so this lowers costs slightly in most places because it was the offseason. I've been to Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary (which isn't on your list but totally should be). I spent 30-40 USD a day. Sometimes less. I stayed in hostel dorm rooms, which is what I would suggest if you want to cut costs. If you must have a private room, I would still suggest hostels over hotels. They have everything you need and are infinitely better for meeting people. I used hostelworld (and sometimes hostelz) to compare costs and book places to stay. I have no idea when you're leaving, but when I was in Poland for example, my hostel was 9 USD per night. And guess what? It was super nice! 12 bed dorm though. Checking their website shows that a private would run you 20 USD per night (this is Krakow).  Also, Berlin is not an expensive city to travel to, and is very easy to get to so I wouldn't consider it part of the expensive class.  All in all, I think that 60 euro may be too little if you are staying in hotel private rooms. I could be just right, or even a little high in places if you're staying in hostel private rooms, and it is way too high if you decide to stay in hostel dorms. In my case, food was my most costly item because I was eating out for most meals. This can obviously be mitigated by cooking your own food sometimes. Remember that almost all hostels (check reviews and facilities) have kitchens, while hotels do not.  Enjoy!"
solotravel,3csgfr,JHK11,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:18:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the long post!

solotravel,3csgfr,JHK11,2,Sat Jul 11 00:36:44 2015 UTC,In e eu I noticed that going out and sitting down at a nice restaurant was a real bargain compared to western europe.

It depends, I averaged €65 a day without keeping to a particular budget, and that included accomodation, eating out for every meal, and transport most days as well as I was only staying in each place for a night or two due to time constraints. In addition to this I was paying for entrance fees to attractions/national parks, and a couple of day tours as well.  Even something as simple as travelling more slowly would drop me below the 60 a day average, so I'd say it's possible on that budget."

solotravel,3cs4oj,mmrk93,3,Fri Jul 10 09:30:47 2015 UTC,"Hey-o, Vancouverite here. I'll give my opinion, but I'm sure that there's plenty that I could possibly miss:  Depends on whether you're looking for mainly city life or strictly outdoors - with Whistler, there's some good hikes on the two mountains that you can access from the base/lifts very easily from wherever you'd be staying. If you have the budget, there's also the opportunity for some outdoor tours (ziplining, bungee jumping, 4x4 rides). Can't say for certain, but I do get the sense that the whole place is a little less busy and vibrant during the off season.  It's hard to think of a comprehensive list when you're not in the touristy mindset, but off the top of my head, some of the major things to check out in the city would probably be (in no particular order): Granville Island, Grouse Mountain (you'd probably want to hike the Grouse Grind), Stanley Park, the Museum of Anthropology (if you're interested in North American indigenous culture), any of the city beaches (Wreck Beach if you want a nude beach), Science World, Gastown, Granville/Robson's Street, local brewpubs (if you're interested in craft beer). I like the city, it's a nice place to walk around and wander in. You should absolutely rent a bike and ride along the Sea wall one day - it's a long trip but it's gorgeous. Depends on how old you are, but from my experience, the trendier and less club-y bars seem to be either on Main Street or on Broadway close to UBC.  Aside from Grouse Mountain and Lynn Valley, your hiking options are limited if you're looking to take public transit. If you're willing to rent a car for the day, you should absolutely check out Garibaldi Lake, which can be accessed on the highway leading to Whistler. It's a phenomenal day trip, and would give you a good taste of the mountains without spending your whole time in Whistler. Here's some random pics of it: http://imgur.com/a/DdUWH  Either way it should be a blast! Let me know if you have any questions."
solotravel,3cs4oj,MrMajorMajorMajor,2,Fri Jul 10 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"Having spent a summer in Whistler, I can say that the party still keeps going and the town doesn't sleep in the off-season.  It's really expensive though and the tours mentioned will run close to (or more than) $100 each.  You can take the lift up Whistler mountain and then take the Peak-to-Peak gondola across to Blackcomb to do some hiking on both mountains, but when I lived there 5 years ago, a lift ticket was $40.  It is absolutely incredible up there though; maybe it'll be worth it.  The only good free thing I can think of to do in Whistler is spending an afternoon at Lost Lake to hang out with the local (mostly) Aussies.  Getting out of Vancouver is easy without a car.  A greyhound bus ticket to Squamish (the town between Whistler and Van) is around $15.  You can try asking the driver to drop you off near the Chief campground, or you can hitch (very common) or cab the 4 km from the bus station to the Chief, where you'll find a beautiful forest with lots of boulderers, and a nice hike up the granite monolith to a beautiful view"

solotravel,3crbls,dankmanatee,2,Fri Jul 10 07:20:16 2015 UTC,"finally, the thing that actually worries me is the whole weather/altitude stuff. i suffer from a few respiratory problems, and also have allergies such as sinusitis and rhinitis (both chronic), so the thought of not having enough air to breathe makes me feel a bit scared. how do you deal with that? is it too hard?    A) Try not to fly direct to the high altitude (e.g. to La Paz). Get there by road. B) Chew coca leaves.  I don't think the allergies or sinusitis will be a problem but maybe it's best to check with a doctor."

If not, have you traveled to places where you didn't speak the language?  How about other developing countries?  You can better estimate how you will handle your problems than any on here.  I'm no doctor, so I can't give you any advice, and I doubt a real doctor could either.  Most traveler's fears are mental and manage to fade quickly once on the road.  I assume you felt your concerns were ones you could overcome, otherwise you would not have booked the trip.  The biggest piece of advice I can give for the trip is to try to get Bolivianos before you get to San Pedro de Atacama, and try to spend your Chilean Pesos.  It was some years ago when I was there, but I have never seen worse exchange rates anywhere else in my life."

solotravel,3crbls,jacalata,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"I just travelled through Chile and Peru along most of your itinerary as a sole female traveller (although I'm 30). I started by taking two weeks of Spanish classes in Santiago since I didn't speak Spanish - I think this really made my trip better, it was a gentle introduction to everything, as the school also offered excursions, English support and info about the city. Santiago is a very European city, as well, so an easy starting point.      For breathing - for me, the altitude wasn't a problem. What I did, which sounds pretty common these days, was head straight to Ollantaytambo when I landed in Cusco, since its down lower at the bottom of the Sacred Valley. I also took some altitude sickness meds I got from my doctor before leaving. I climbed all over Macchu Picchu and Cusco with no problems, although I did feel tired quite easily all week.      For itinerary - a lot of the people I met in Peru were also heading to Puerto Maldonaldo to see the Amazon, it sounded nice.      I have blogged about some of my trip already and totally plan to get the Peru sections up, PM me if you'd like to hear more :)"
solotravel,3cr57u,Whatyoname,2,Fri Jul 10 02:46:59 2015 UTC,"I just got back from Vietnam a couple of weeks ago and did pretty much the exact same thing you are planning. I stayed at the Vietnam Inn Saigon while in Ho Chi Minh. Great hostel, very social and a sweet roof top bar that you can get two free beers from every night. Nha Trang is nice with a sweet beach and there's plenty to do on the island of Vinpearl, which is right off the coast. Da Lat was nice mostly because it's a town up in the hills and turned out to be an amazing break from the heat and humidity. If you do anything in Vietnam, visit Hoi An. One of the most beautiful towns I have ever been to. If you go to Hoi An visit this bahn mi restaurant I was in Hoi An for four days and I probably eat there close to 15 times. Literally every time I left my hostel I stopped by. So cheap (~$1 per sandwich). Hoi An has beaches similar to those at Nha Trang and the old town at night was a sight I'll remember for the rest of my life. Enjoy your trip, I'm jealous, I would go back there tomorrow if I could. Also, eat Pho every morning you're there, because you know: ""When in Vietnam""..."

I'm not really sure how to get to the places I want to go to ! I'll definitely visit hoi an sounds amazing ! If you could since you did a similar trip, could you send me your itinerary. Just so I can get a feel of how much time I should spend in different places. Thanks again for the info!!"
solotravel,3cr57u,DubuqueResident,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:51:49 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I flew in to Ho Chi Minh and flew out of Hanoi. I didn't book any transportation tell I got there, and I strongly recommend doing the same thing. You'll never know how much you like or dislike any particular place. I traveled by sleeper bus with the company ""The Sinh Tourist"". I was a little nervous about transportation before I got there, but to be honest, but you have nothing to worry about. It's so easy to book travel to another city. From what I experienced, there are so many companies that can get you to a different city, it was really easy and stress free. The Sinh Tourist has offices in Ho Chi Minh, Nha Trang, Hoi An, Hanoi and a few other cities I think. I bought a 1 month unlimited pass for about 35 US dollars. The sleeper bus was fine, air conditioning was amazing but I heard from other travelers that the train may be a little more safe. I was told the trains have  similar air conditioning, I never rode one so I can't say for sure. (Vietnamese drivers, as you'll see, are a little crazy). The benefit of the sleeper bus (for me) was that they all travel through the night, so I would save money on a hostel for a night and wake up in a new city the next morning (train schedules can vary). I spent, on average, about 4 days and 3 nights in each city and unless you absolutely fall in love with the town, there really isn't any reason to spend any more time than that in any city. In order I went: 4 days in Ho Chi Minh, 3 days in Nha Trang, 3 days in Da Lat, one more day in Nha Trang before heading up to Hoi An. 4 days in Hoi An, 5 days in Hanoi which was separated by a 2 day 1 night cruise in Ha Long Bay. Most hostels are really great and can help you book your travel from city to city plus anything you would want to do in that current town. On a side note, I was talking to the owner of a restaurant in Hoi An, and he told me, with the current rate of development, that the town of Sapa will be changed (not as beautiful) in about 5-10 years. I never went to Sapa but I heard it was absolutely amazing. It's northwest of Hanoi, just south of the Chinese border. So if you can make it up there I guess I would suggest it, considering it may never be the same in about a decade. As far as hostels went, I would just book them the day before I left. I met people who didn't book anything tell they showed up and they always were able to easily find a place to stay. Also, any hostel with the name ""backpacker"" in it, i.e. backpacker hostel, central backpacker hostel etc., are ALWAYS very social and fun places to stay.   Sorry I kind of rambled. If anything doesn't make sense just ask me to clarify and if you have any more questions just let me know!"

solotravel,3cr57u,advantagecp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:55:18 2015 UTC,"There is already some good advice in the thread.  I will add:    Camellia Hotel, Dalat.  Great owners.  Thinh Vuong Hotel, Kon Tum.  Spacious $12 Single.  Bia Hoi and food at Vi Cafe, Hoi An.  Four Seasons Hue (obviously not a ""real"" Four Seasons)  Friendly, well managed.  Hanoi Family Homestay, Hanoi.  In Old Quarter.  $12 single includes breakfast, coffee/fruit/juice/snacks throughout day, and often you will be invited to dinner.  This is my favorite hotel in Vietnam.  I have visited Vietnam twice and spent over 3 weeks total in this place.  Perfume, the owner, is a genuinely nice and caring person.   General advice: 1.  Talk to people.  The vast majority of Vietnamese will be excited just to meet you and talk to you.  Don't assume that people who approach you are scammers.  They rarely are in Vietnam. 2.  Get off the beaten path and get up into the Central Highlands.  I volunteered to teach some English classes and had a lot of fun doing that. 3.  Allow several days for Hanoi.  The people there are friendly, the street food/small restaurants are adventures, and the Old Quarter is a wonderful area for walking."

solotravel,3cr57u,CantLookUp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:29:36 2015 UTC,"I always have the same two suggestions for Vietnam, both of them probably rank in my top 5 experiences in all of South East Asia - I say probably because I don't think I'll ever manage to decide on what these were. That said:  It's been mentioned once already, but definitely go to Sapa. The homestays are always recommended, but one of the things I loved most about it was just renting a scooter and taking off along the mountain roads. So many great views and places to stop off to enjoy them.  The second is Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park. The tours they offer here aren't the most budget friendly, but they're so worth the extra money. We did the Paradise Cave 7km trek - the first few minutes of this are in the entrance to the cave which is open for everyone, walkways, lights, etc. However, the best part of the cave is only accessible through this tour, and you soon leave the hordes of tourists behind and find yourself in complete darkness, the only light provided by your headlamps, and the only people around are those on your tour - a maximum of 8 per tour plus 2 guides. You'll be hiking around/over different kinds of rock formations, crossing an underground pool (possibly a river?), and so on - halfway through the tour you reach the highlight of the day (I'm not going to spoil what this is) where you'll stop and have lunch before returning through the caves. I can't recommend this enough."

I would also recommend the beach at Nha Trang as it is awesome, it has a good sunrise too. If you're into the history of the vietnam war then there's a museum in Ho Chi Minh. There is also the cu chi tunnels which you can arrange a trip to once in Ho Chi Minh; you can actually crawl through the tunnels and you'll learn a lot about the war as their perspective is a little different from the western perspective. It might be worth a ride on the mekong too. Of course you must try Pho, don't shy away from street food and they have their coffee quite different so it might be worth a try. Most of all have fun!

For someone from out of the area, it's nice to go somewhere new with a friendly face and a local perspective. You can read reviews on your hosts to find out if they are creepers. Just keep a few things in mind. 1) Your hosts are not a hotel. They host for the experience as much as you trying to visit. Be upfront with your plans because they might get offended if you plan to just crash and go. 2) You might need to break up who you stay with. The saying goes guests and fish tend to stink after about 3 days. This can vary with the host but it pays to make sure you aren't a burden. 3) If you stay with someone, try to do something nice. Offer to wash the dishes or cook a meal. It doesn't have to be huge but they are taking much more risk by letting a stranger stay in their home than you are taking by crashing on a the couch of someone who has multiple reviews and their faces/locations posted online. 4) As you stated, it's the peak of the tourist season. Don't be disheartened if the hosts are all responding that they already have guests or are out of town themselves."

solotravel,3cp0ng,jobchirps,3,Thu Jul 9 16:52:49 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I had the opportunity to travel to Prague, Munich, and Hawaii. Also, I speak conversational German too!  Munich is likely my favorite city in the world. There's so much to do and, if you want to get out of the city, there's plenty of transportation to other places in Bayern (I recommend Schloss Neuschwanstein). But, if you're going in late september, you're going in the height of Oktoberfest. Getting a hostel will be impossible. Here's a tip: stay in Nürnberg. The train ride to Munich is 45min-ish and staying there is  A LOT cheaper and more quiet that time of year.   Prague is also fantastic. If you go there and do nothing but walk around, you'll be glad you went. The city is beautiful and there is plenty to do. Note: Your German will not help you one bit there. Luckily, most people speak English.   I've never been to Vienna, so I can't tell you much, but I've heard plenty of good things.  When it comes to Waikiki, the entire island of Oahu is accessible by bus, which cannot be said about the other islands. If you go there, try to go to the Byodo In Temple. It's off the beaten path but we'll worth is. Honolulu is fantastic and Pearl Harbor is fascinating. Be cautious though, Hawaii in general is expensive. Everything is imported onto the island, causing everything you purchase to be 30% more expensive than it is on the mainland.  Anywhere you go, you're going to have fun. Let me know if you have any questions and herzlich Glückwunsch!"

I've done a lot of research today and think I'm going to land on Europe - and rather than getting busy with multiple countries I'm going to try and tour Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg. Munich obviously a must visit, outside of that I think I'll take your suggestion of Nuremberg.   Have you been to other cities in either of those states that you would suggest? (Freiburg, Konstanz, Berchtesgadaner are a few I've seen)"
solotravel,3cp0ng,mattg1129,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:33 2015 UTC,"When I was in Munich, I visited Fusse, which is the town that leads up to Schloss Neuschwanstein (a must see). I also visited Salzburg (Yeah, it's in Austria, but it's right on the border). If you like nature, check out Koenigsee, a beautiful Lake nestled in the alps. Take the ferry across and hike to the glacier. There's also Rose Island and the surrounding Lake (you can take take the S-Bahn right from the Hauptbahnhof in munich). Rose Island is the home of King Ludwig, who was deemed too mentally ill to serve after spending a ton of money building castles all around Bayern. On the first day of being isolated to Rose Island, he was found dead with his doctor on the coast of the lake. His cause of death is still speculated today.   I know the most about Munich. The have a world class science museum (Deutschesmuseum), the headquarters of BMW (and their museum), cathedrals everywhere, and battle scars from WWII.

Hostels will be more expensive than usual but still cheaper than a hotel (I paid about $60/night to stay about 10 minutes from the festival).  Everyone is friendly and it's a great time, so it would be a great intro to traveling on your own."
solotravel,3cp0ng,KingJulien,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"I did Hawaii for two weeks on about $1,500. Costa Rica is maybe a tiny bit cheaper, but not much, although there are parts that are quite a lot cheaper, but hard to access (I stayed in the Osa peninsula for $12/night, but spent a whole day on a bus getting there). If you do Europe, do one city, not three - one week isn't enough to see even one city, IMO.  I'd do Europe, only because I think one week is a tiny amount of time. You'd at least be able to get the feel for one city in a week, whereas you'd leave Costa Rica wishing you'd seen the other 99% of the country, and leave Hawaii wishing you had another week or two.  Lastly, I think September is the time of year where Costa Rica pours all day, every day. Look this up. Hawaii will be nice at that time."

About 5 minutes after I turned around I met a woman hiking up.  She also had inappropriate footwear for the conditions.  She turned around and walked down with me.  A year and a half ago we brought our 6 year old and 7 year old kids hiking in the Himalayas."
solotravel,3ckm5y,ignorantwanderer,64,Wed Jul 8 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, I'll bite. I've spent long enough lurking I guess I should submit something at some point.   I finished high school last August, and, being young and desperately wanting out of the small farm town I grew up in, I hit the road. So I flew as far away from home as I could. New Zealand.   The independence was fantastic. There's nothing like leaving one town simply because ""fuck it, I do what I want,"" and I made the most of it. By making the most of it, I mean I blew through my budget painfully quickly on more beer than I'd drank in my previous 18 years.   I ended up in Nelson, working at a bar. Nothing spectacular, just made a bit of cash to save and replenish the funds. That was where I first met her.   As some of you may know, Kiwi hostels often have more Germans occupying them than France in the early '40s. So sooner or later I was bound to meet one, right? Enter Kate (not a remotely German name, but an easy enough pseudonym.)   Kate and I met at a house party, hit it is quite well. Not to say we immediately squared off for a hand of tonsil hockey. Far from it. We talked loads, and got on really well.  But she needed time to commit, and was moving on to other places, while I was headed further south for other work, so our ways split, as friends.   Two month gap. I escape the tiny township that is Franz Josef glacier,  the prison I'd been working. Some how I ended up in a village smaller than where I was originally from. Go figure. Kate was on my mind. I hadn't been able to shake the feeling our story wasn't over.   Kate, as well as some other friends, moved to Wanaka. I was meant to be on the north island, but a brief tour of the town, and the idea of Kate cancelled that plan.   The third day I was in Wanaka, February 22, she kissed me. Under a firework show, next to the lake. It was a damn country song in the making. I fell hard after that. We were effectively living together, though in different rooms of the same hostel. I turned 19 there, and she arranged a surprise party for me. It was wonderful. I'd never had a surprise party before.   But traveling means nothing is permanent, and all must come to an end. She had a flight to Asia April fifth.   With three weeks left for her, we hit the road. Her, me and my car. We covered over half the country, camping or splashing out on hostel double beds. As a teenage boy, I never realized morning sex was even a thing until that trip. God damn, this is a whole new world!   April fifth was closing in way too damn sneaky. I think we both started to understand how much trouble we were in. We were meant to end the relationship when she left, we had discussed it and everything. Neither of us has planned on properly falling in love. But that's exactly what happened.   She's the first girl I can truly say I've loved. She's beautiful, funny, smart... But it's more than that. We're really good friends. We can talk for hours. Silence is not uncomfortable. We're a proper team. We motivate each other. Arguments aren't angry, conflict is treated as a problem and resolved. We would still be together now, but for something that is unbelievably unforgiving.   Distance. Optimism is easy the first week. Or at least less difficult. She left NZ. I applied for a UK working visa, because England is closer to Europe than NZ is. It took a month to get that, but it was granted.   Through a stroke of luck, we both landed in London within 15 minutes of each other. She had a two hour layover, so we spent that together. It had been one month apart. God damn, just a kiss feels so fucking good after a month. Those two hours flew by. That was the last time I saw her.   Three weeks ago, we broke up. Sobbing over the phone. The distance is too hard. There's nothing to be done. All the little things are missing, and those little things add up to the big thing.   I suppose we were both incredibly naive to believe it could have worked. We're both young, probably too young. And I'm looking forward, but it still hurts to look back. It was a really good run.   I can't help but look back and smile though. The two and a half months together were some of the best I've ever had. I wouldn't miss it for the world. It didn't end ugly. Simply put, circumstance and timing just aren't in our favor.   So here I am, working the summer in England, moving forward with life. I'm still living the dream, so I've gained way more than I've lost.   Side note: if you happen to be in a long distance relationship right now, you have my utmost respect, and I wish you the best of luck."

I checked into my hostel near Khao San road, and went looking for street food.  I passed many bars and street parties, but no food..  Then as I was passing another bar, a woman got up from her seat and walked up to me.  She was visibly intoxicated, but not a terrible amount, and said to me: ""Mister, buy me a drink!""  I tried to push her away, but she held on with the veracity of a velociraptor.  ""Come on, party with me, mister!"".  I looked her up and down - very attractive, probably a prostitute.   I pushed her away from me and followed my stomach, my nose, and my heart. Just around the corner was a pad thai streetfood stand!  I bought some pad thai and springrolls and brought it back to my room and enjoyed all the flavours.  Ahh..  Perfect.

solotravel,3ckm5y,x3nomik,30,Thu Jul 9 00:18:44 2015 UTC,"After trying out two different degrees at uni (a year on each degree), I got fed up and booked a flight to Europe. After two months of backpacking I met a Canadian girl in a small village in the south of France. She was the only other person in the hostel room when I opened the door and she was absolutely gorgeous. I was exhausted and planned to go straight to bed but she was pretty enthusiastic about going out and exploring the village. I said sure, and acted like I wasn't about to pass out from tiredness.  We walked around like you do when you're solo travelling, kind of just meandering. She was talking and I was holding on to every word. She was smart, really smart. After two hours of walking and talking I was feeling something in my chest that I hadn't felt in years. We got some food and sat down by a lake and talked until the village went to bed. We spoke about all the good stuff that late-night conversations are spun with, only it was amplified by the fact that we were solo travellers in the south of France with what felt like all the time that the universe had to offer. Music, movies, life, work, favorite smells and sounds, million-dollar-ideas, books, storytelling. We covered everything. I had never been so enthralled by a conversation.  We went quiet after a while and watched the small, glowing windows of the boats on the lake. I mentioned I was going to Scotland after France.  She sighed and she was all energy again, standing up and telling me to get my ass off the ground as well. We walked back to the hostel and she casually mentioned her boyfriend. The whole, sugary sweet evening had been cracked open and emptied with one sentence. It felt like a slap. We spoke for a while longer in the hostel room before going to bed. I chose the top bunk.  When I woke up I felt like my feelings had been brewing and growing all night while I slept. We spent three perfect days in the sunny village falling in love, but neither of us said or did anything. We both knew it was happening. On the third day, she had to leave for Paris and I had a ticket booked on a train to Dijon. We had three days of perfect conversation and needlessly close physical contact. The tension was palpable and my morals were becoming less black and white and more shades of grey.  Fuck it. I changed my ticket to one for Paris during the evening of the third day, and when we got to the station at the other side of the village, I got on her train. Her face lit up and I felt great. We were both on top of the world.  I reasoned to myself that it didn't have to go anywhere, she didn't have to cheat or do anything like that. I just wanted to spend as much time with her as possible before we had to part ways. I'd never met someone I felt such an incredibly deep connection with. Our brains hummed away on the same wavelengths.  Paris was beautiful. We fell further. We were both having the best time either of us had ever had in our lives. Delicious food, beautiful buildings, art, more books. I bought her a copy of Into the Wild (which I held on to) and another book called Under the Skin, set in the Highlands, where I was headed to. I had a plan with the copy of Into the Wild and kept it hidden in my backpack.  We spent a sunset at the Arc de Triomphe and another at the stunning Montmartre. We spiralled deeper and deeper. Long hugs at night before we went to our separate hostel rooms were the highlights of both our days.  On our last day in Paris, we went to the Eiffel Tower. Finally. We set up a picnic in the park at its base while the sun dipped out of sight. Mulled wine kept warm in a thermos, incredible bread and cheese, and some other snacks and fruit. It was beautiful. I had never felt so free of anxiety and negativity as I did in that moment. I felt pure.  We laughed and ate. The hours slipped away while we watched the Tower flashing and glinting before us. I felt like the universe itself was saying go ahead, this is a once in lifetime chance. I fished the copy of Into the Wild out of my day bag and she smiled and shook her head. I'd been hyping up this book for the whole week and now she had a copy to read. She opened the cover and saw it filled with handwriting. I looked away at the Tower while she read it. I think I still I have a copy of what I wrote somewhere.  She cried, quietly. We embraced and I shed a bit of a tear as well. She told me that she's never felt so conflicted in her life and in that moment I became a truly bad person. We sat curled up together, her breath warming my neck. We were finally speaking words of affection, my note in the book had opened us up, but there was no I love you or anything that held that much weight.  By the time we actually walked over to the Eiffel Tower, the top level had closed, so we went to the second level instead. We laughed about it and said it was time well spent anyway. At about two in the morning we got back to the hostel and stood outside my room.  We both wanted to sleep together. I don't mean sex. Just sleep in the same bed together. I felt rotten and we were both tired and brimming with emotion. We stood longer in the cold outside the room. We held each other and just stared at one another for a long time. She looped her scarf around my neck. We exchanged addresses and phone numbers and other details. We held each other again for what felt like forever. She kissed me on the cheek and said goodbye.  She didn't turn around and I slumped onto the pavement. Her scarf smelt like her perfume.  In keeping with the feeling that the universe was watching me, the next day was rainy. I left the hostel at 6:30 in the morning to catch the channel train across to the UK. I kept a desperate eye out for her as I ate breakfast. I was just going through the motions. I felt shattered. I was doing something that I really, really, genuinely did not want to do, and that felt strange, doing it by choice. I could have gone up to her room for another goodbye.  I'm going to cut the story short here because I have to go and do something, but I went to the West Highlands in Scotland after Paris. I stayed in a cottage on my own. After a week I called her and told that she had to join me, the landscape was too beautiful to be experiencing on my own. She said no. I asked again the next day. No. During my second week there she sent me a message saying that she had booked a flight to Edinburgh. She was going to come to the Highlands.  I danced around the fucking room. I couldn't believe it. The Highlands are an entire story on their own though, the landscape there is romantic in a spectacular and powerful way.  Continued in reply"
solotravel,3ckm5y,sandaig,16,Thu Jul 9 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"Continued  I gave her the address of the remote cottage I was staying in and the directions to it. I couldn't wait to share the awesome beauty of the area with her. The bay, the mountains, the wildlife, and the nearby village. I waited two days for her to arrive, and they were the longest two days of my life. I walked around the hills both days, thinking about how I could hold back my feelings and if I could bring myself to stop her doing anything she'd regret. I think I knew deep down that I couldn't.  On the day of her arrival the morning was cold and clear and the glen looked spectacular. I hitched a ride with someone from the village to go over the mountain road and pick her up from the bus stop at Shiel Bridge, a few miles away and too steep and long to walk. Everything looked stunning. The sun glinted off the dewy surfaces of the pine trees and rocks around the river at Shiel Bridge. The bare hills of the Highlands were purple and orange with heather and bracken. She honestly looked like an angel with the sun behind her.  I hopped out of the car to help her with her bag and we briefly hugged and said hello. The drive back to the glen was quiet. I could feel the air buzzing. We both got dropped off at the cottage and as soon as the car and driver were down the road, she leapt into my arms. It was incredible. I thought we would break each others' backs. I held her and she just whispered ""Hey"" into my ear. I didn't say anything back, just exhaled.  After showing her around the cottage and avoiding a conversation about sleeping arrangements, we set off for a walk. The glen I was staying in features in one of my favorite novels, Ring of Bright Water, and I felt I knew it intimately and that I had a spiritual connection to the place. Now I had someone to share it with. The sun, the water, the trees, the otters and the birds. I showed her everything. I told her the story of Ring of Bright Water.  The first night in the glen, we were getting ready for bed, and she had told she was going to sleep on the couch. I didn't argue. After brushing my teeth and changing, I walked into the bedroom and she was under the covers, sleeping. I climbed in next to her and put my face close to hers. She smiled that tired smile that I came to know so well in the evenings and the mornings.  We had a phenomenal week. Deep conversations under the stars where I felt the earth hum with the energy she conjured up in me. Hot drinks and good meals by the bay where she stared at me out the corner of her eye when she thought I wasn't looking. Bike riding up and along lonely roads through hills and mountains. Discovering private bays and beaches that we wondered along and made our own. Walking through forests silently, so we could listen to the birds. She amplified the beauty of everything. There's a line from Into the Wild that's stuck with me, and that's ""happiness is only real when shared."" It had never been more true than it was that week.  We struggled with the bedroom. She would fall asleep with tears in her eyes. She would shake with want or guilt, or maybe both, when we held each other in bed. Never kissing mouth to mouth or even discussing the possibility of getting too intimate in bed. I stopped myself from thinking about what I was doing to her and what she was doing to herself and her relationship. We were in our own world after a while. I could tell he was slipping from her mind and he was slipping from my mind too. The guilt subsided after a few perfect days. We truly loved each other.  We explored for the rest of our time in the glen. My shoes got wet while we crossed a river to get to a waterfall and we laughed. Walking barefoot through the Highlands in late autumn is interesting. We got caught in heavy rain while we were quietly exploring some ruins in another glen. We sat on the stone inside the ruins and watched the hills and pine trees drown in the downpour while we remained dry.  I showed her the tiny bay where the author of Ring of Bright Water had lived in the 50s and 60s and I cried. She understood why and didn't have to ask or say anything.  We decided to go from Glenelg, where we were staying, to Plockton, another small village. After a bus and a train we arrived in the gorgeous seaside community of Plockton as the sun was setting. We checked in to the Inn and they asked us if we wanted one or two beds. We asked for one and she smiled. I felt that guilt, that black crack in my guts surge up through me, but it died quickly.  We made a salad in the room that night. We made an absolute mess and laughed and laughed as we ate and cleaned it up. We watched Lost In Translation and fell asleep together. The next day we hiked through a forest and came across a clearing. As I was photographing some trees, she came up in front of me and just stared. I could see that tenderness in her eyes and I knew what it meant. She came closer and pulled my face against hers but I turned away by reflex at the last instant. She put her head against my chest and sort of sighed and sobbed and the same time. I told her we should keep walking. We ended up reaching the summit of a mountain after walking through the forest. At the top were ice pools and a stunning, mind-bending view of the West Highlands and the village below. We drank in the view and some mulled wine and she pulled out the copy of Into the Wild I'd given her.  She sat down in a gap in some rocks and asked me to read to her. I huddled in next to her, out of the wind, and began to read. I'm still not quite sure why, but this is one of the most profoundly intimate experiences I've had. I sat and read to her for over an hour. We shared the pages. We reacted to the words. We sighed and smiled and gasped. After a time it was too cold to sit still, so we went back down to the village. The tide had gone out and the bay was bare outside the Inn.  In the room, I sat on the edge of the bed with my legs over the edge and pulled off my shoes and socks and hiking pants, so that only my thermals were on. She sat on my lap, straddling me, and kissed me. We kissed and moved together and touched and breathed together for a long time.  It changed everything. Later that night she broke down and we walked along the empty main street of the village together, until we reached a quiet, dark spot of grass. We spoke about her boyfriend, her, me, the whole thing. The whole mess. The whole beautiful mess. We never argued though, and never had. We knew what was going on. And again, no one said I love you.  The next night, we walked to the edge of the village and out onto the dark pier that stretched out onto Loch Carron. The moon was heavy and orange and hung above us, turning the mountains into silhouettes and the loch into a glimmering, living thing. The small waves lapped at the sides of the pier. During the day I had told her that I loved her while we were sitting eating some oranges on some rocks after a walk. She told me that she wanted to say it and that she couldn't. On the pier she said it. She whispered it to me while we kissed. I love you. I love you. I love you so much I don't know what to do. We both got drunk that night.  We became intimate. It was the deepest relationship I've ever had. So many threads and grey areas and conflicts and so much sweetness. So much beauty it was overwhelming at times. Our romance and relationship grew and evolved over the weeks in Scotland. We shared things. I told her things that I had never told anyone else. Terrible things about me. She listened. I listened when she told me terrible things about her. We let each other know how much we loved one another.  We lived in a heady, perfect, honeyed dream.  Continued in reply"
solotravel,3ckm5y,sandaig,17,Thu Jul 9 16:24:11 2015 UTC,"Continued  Then we were in Edinburgh and she had to leave in three days. I gave her a necklace that I had bought her in Plockton. I gave it to her in an empty courtyard after we spent the evening walking around the Christmas festivities and markets. It felt like I was proposing to her. She thought it was beautiful. It was a silver circle with a simple celtic engraving on it. And not those tacky celtic engravings, it was gorgeous. The engraving was three knots intertwined, fitting, I guess.  Time slipped.  We walked up Arthur's Seat and viewed the city while the wind blew around us. Sadness came in huge waves and she often asked me what was wrong. She said I should enjoy my time. That hurt. I knew she must be feeling the same, just hiding it.  I love you, I love you too. We didn't know what we were doing. The hours were dissolving and we didn't know what to do. I felt panicky, anxious. One more day and night together and she would have to leave at 9:30 the next morning. We feverishly made the most of our time exploring the streets and the stores of Edinburgh.  Edinburgh is a beautiful city and it'll hold a sad but special space in my heart forever, but during those last days I had never been anywhere uglier. I wanted rolling hills and cottages and the ocean and mountains and forests and all the time in the world. Where had our weeks gone? Where had everything gone?  On the last night, I stayed up and wrote to her in my journal. I wrote as many pages as I could. No shitty, corny stuff. Deep, genuine words about what I felt we shared with no fluff attached and no lies. I stayed up all night. In the morning we acted normal. We got up at 6:00 and went downstairs to the hostel breakfast area. We ate. I took photos of us. We walked to the place where we would experience our last sliver of true beauty. A little secondhand bookstore.  While she perused the shelves I asked the shopkeeper if he had a copy of Ring of Bright Water. He did. It was a first edition with a newspaper clipping inside that held a story on Gavin Maxwell, the author. After looking around the shop a while longer, we went outside. We sat on a bench in the courtyard outside the shop and I wrote the most thought-out, intimate words I had ever written on the inside cover of Ring of Bright Water. I gave the book to her once I'd finished writing and watched her read the note. She handed me a copy of another Gavin Maxwell book and I read what she'd written to me inside.  I was trying as hard as I could not to shake once we got to the bus stop. Her airport bus was due to arrive in 10 minutes. It arrived and went. We hugged, we spoke. Another one arrived, it went. I cried and told her I loved her so much. She told me she loved me, she didn't cry.  She got on the bus. I got on my train. I was a shell. For months.  I went back to London, before flying back home, and I was just going through the motions. Nothing registered as interesting or emotionally engaging. She sent me a message saying she'd read the long letter I'd written her over the course of our last night together, she told me she bawled her eyes out on the bus and that people stared at her.  I flew back home. She stayed in Amsterdam with a friend. We Skyped every evening until she had to fly back to Canada. We sang favorite songs to each other over Skype, I usually hummed and sang to her until she fell asleep. We were intimate, emotionally, while we talked. Then she flew back home.  I was gutted, all over again. The first night she was back home she had booked a hotel with her boyfriend. They holidayed together once she got back. It really fucked me up and I realised how fucked up the whole thing was.  There were angry, tired, sad conversations. I sent her a massive gift of books and music to read and listen to. We video chatted every other week.  Then there was a gap. She stopped being her. She suddenly wasn't the woman I knew and communication dropped for a few months.  One day the copy of Ring of Bright Water that I gave to her showed up on my doorstep. She sent it back to me. It's sitting on my shelf now and her birthday is soon, and I'm wondering if I should get her anything or even send her a message at all."

solotravel,3ckm5y,coolflash8,4,Thu Jul 9 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"Dude, fuck you. As someone in this sub, you should know that on a solo you can't always know how you will feel nor can you control when people come into your life. Passing judgement on this girl for something she did during a solo trip, already an intense time with or without love, is wrong. Further, it takes two to tango.   As for her turning her back on the poster, maybe that was the easiest thing to do for her sanity. I know it isn't ideal, but chances are she was going out of her fucking mind thinking about him and decided the distance/circumstance was too much.  Personally, I know how she feels and that there is no way that was an easy choice."

I missed my flight because I'm almost deaf, and didn't hear the Southwest announcement over the speakers that the gate had changed.  Yep, I'm sitting there waiting for the people to show up... and eventually asked ""Where's my flight?"", and they said ""It took off ten minutes ago.""   Southwest is so cool.  They put me on a flight going to Chicago, then transfer to Miami on the same day - getting in just three hours later, which was no problem for me, because I was scheduled to meet people the next day.  They had me do a disabled pre-board, and as I was waiting to board a woman sat down next to me, and we started talking.  She was going to Chicago on business...  I pre-boarded and saved the seat next to me.  She sat next to me, and we talked some more and exchanged email addresses.  In Miami we sent emails back and forth.  Turns out she lived in a nearby town.  When I got home, she and I met for dinner.  We started a romance and we've been married now for 11 years.  I can still remember what she wore on our first date.  We're going to Morocco for a month next October.  I'm 70, she's 66 now."

For my part, in 2012 I met an incredible Australian girl. For the most part she's out of my league, but the road equalizes the playing field, eh? We met in Scotland and after a week had to part ways. Lost contact over Facebook, it was what it was. Entirely out of chance, with zero coordination on either of our parts, we ran into each other a month and a bit later at the Heineken brewery in Amsterdam. Became faster friends but still never sealed any deals. I think we were so connected that we were afraid it would be to hard to say goodbye. We traveled together to Berlin, Bratislava, then Vienna. Took about a month together. She had to leave and neither of us really wanted to talk about it. And she sort of just left, back to Australia. Little ceremony, just a ""not goodbye, but 'later'"" sort of thing. That much hurt but hey, ""later.""  In 2014 I happened to be in Ireland and she in Turkey. We arranged to meet in Greece. We spent a month-ish travelling the Peloponnese having the best time. Again, nothing happened, but we agreed why it didn't. This time the split was much harder. In 2016 I'm planning on leaving Canada for Aus, and we'll see what things are like on home turf.   It's probably not the story you're looking for, but I'm glad to know that she's there. Maybe it's not really love, but it could be in time.  I miss her and we skype often enough, but there's still an undercurrent there. One day.   And apart from travel, this is my advice regarding your last question. Never ever regret love. This is coming from a 31 year-old divorced man. People will tell you short-term love is lust. They'll tell you that road love is different and less important than home love. Those people have never fallen for someone truly and madly, and that's sad.   Relish love while you have it, remember it fondly when you don't, and always keep in mind how easy it was to fall into it, because it'll be that easy when it happens again. And it's the fucking best.   Edit: ""j"" /= ""l"""

She was beautiful, a little sassy, and a lot of fun to hang out with.  Her accent had me from the start.  In the beginning, I made several attempts to spark something, flirting with her only to get denied.  Eventually she started warming up to me, we started talking, and she started flirting back.  And then it was time for her to go home.  I wasn't going to let that happen though.    What was supposed to be her last night, we stayed up all night sipping whiskey on the porch, exchanging shoulder massages and deep, fulfilling conversations.  After breakfast, we were walking around in a park waiting for the time to come that she needed to head to the airport.  At the park, I convinced her to stay in the city for one more night with me.  She called in sick to work right there and we spent one last day together in New York City.  She slept with me in my tiny little hostel bed that night (she had to check out and there weren't any more beds left), we spooned, held hands, it was fucking awesome.  I don't even think I slept because I was so giddy with emotions and attraction.  We road to the airport together, got a couple drinks at the airport bar and reminisced about our time together.  I went in for the kiss (my first attempt was denied a few days prior) and got it... we hugged goodbye and made a pact to see each other again.  We made our way to our respective flights.  Turns out we were so wrapped into our conversation she didn't realize how long her security line had gotten and ultimately missed her flight (but got on another shortly thereafter).  That pact we made... it happened.  Several months later she flew across the pond to visit me in the states.  We had an awesome long weekend together in my city.  I took her ice skating, hung out with my friends, showed her the sights, ate, drank and gave each other massages, and had some amazing sex.  We made another pact to see each other again, this time I was to go to her.  And then things took a turn.  A few months later, she was visiting the states again with a guy ""friend"" and playfully suggested I meet them in the city they were staying.  The invite was quickly revoked and communication was wishy-washy.  She lied about not wanting me to come by giving me some excuse.  She ultimately fessed up and told me she ended up sleeping with the guy she was traveling here with - after she told me to come - and that it would be weird if I came now.  I told her I understood, and we haven't talked since.  I still think about her multiple times a week.  TLDR: I fell in love with a Swiss girl in NYC, she visited me, asked me to meet her again but then banged another guy and told me not to come."

She was living in Tibet, running a business during the tourist season and traveling the rest of the year. And she was just so exotic and interesting and fun to hang around with, including all sorts of cultural differences and so on.   So we traveled around Borneo together for about 2 weeks and it was a whirlwind of a time. Definitely falling for her more and more every day. She had a flight booked to India, I wanted to stay in Borneo and continue to Indonesia and we made very loose plans to possibly meet up in Sri Lanka.   All of that didn't really work out but we stayed in touch and eventually she goes ""why don't you come and stay with me and my mom for chinese new year and spring festival?"". As a traveler, I mean.. you kinda have to, right ^  So we spent an amazing month together in China, a country I never intended to visit before and it was marvelous. Took about an hour to be back in full relationship mode. Everywhere we went we were invited, got amazing food, it was one of the best experiences I've had. Luckily I had started to learn some chinese after she left, didn't really think I'd meet her again but it was good fun and suddenly I could communicate a little with all these chinese people!!   Eventually my visa ran out and I had to leave. Was quite sad, again a whirlwind of a time we spent together. Met up again in Nepal 2 months later, but somehow the feeling didn't really return for the first days. She was so busy with workrelated stuff, had been there a ton of times and so on.

I just came back from a solo month in Eastern Europe and while I have a few good stories, I'll tell you about one in Prague.   I was staying at the Madhouse hostel, a great party hostel but be warned, they mainly drink and play beer pong during the day. That night's event was going to a club called The Roxy as it was electro-swing night. The club was your stereotypical overcrowded, blazing hot venue with loud, bumping music and I loved it. I danced for hours, both alone and with groups. But there was one incredibly cute girl (and her friend) that I was around the most. After a while, I made a move and started dancing with her. Now I'm not the best dancer but I can sure as hell hold my own and brought some American moves to the Czech arena. She loved them, and I was having the time of my life.   Around 3 am she tells me she has to leave b/c she has a train to catch in the morning. Naturally, I leave with her to walk her home (we took a tram but dammit it's the thought that counts!). I could tell she wasn't keen on going too far but I made another move and we started making out outside her door. I made an excuse to go inside, and well, we ended up on her bed. Now here's the kicker, we didn't have sex. Nope. She made it clear that I'm going to be held at second base. But what did I care, sex isn't the end all and I've been pretty lucky so far on my trip. But what we did do was stay up all night, making out and enjoying each other's body. All night and part of the morning, from around 3:30 am to 9 am, that's what we did. It was interesting spending the entire night on just foreplay, but it really brought an intimate and romantic side that my previous encounters lacked. It was amazing. The morning after, she walked to me to the door, kissed good-bye, and never saw her again. We were both keen on meeting up again but we never really finalized anything (probably due to us both being sleep-deprived). I even waited near her building for a while the day after just so I could see her again, but no dice.   I actually didn't enjoy Prague too much overall but this night saved it. It was honestly one of the best nights of my life, a perfect night with a perfect girl. I left Prague a couple day later, but she was still on my mind. I still think about that night sometimes and about her, Gaby."
solotravel,3ckm5y,DavidAMIs,3,Wed Jul 8 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"I notice a lot of stories are ending with people never seeing each other again. That's really sad.  My story begins about 8 months before I met her. My ex and I had just come back from a 6 week trip to Hawaii. She had fallen for someone on the farm we worked on and so when we came back we broke up ending a 3 year old relationship. I was supposed to start school for the spring semester but decided to defer my enrollment for one more travel stint. I worked for about 8 months and packed my bag to do a solo jaunt to Hawaii. I wanted to recreate the memories of the place so I wasn't always thinking back to such a beautiful place in a negative light.  After a few weeks on the islands, I decided to fly out to Portland, OR. To this day that hostel stay was the best experience of my life. I met a guy named Pol who introduced me to a girl named Kristen. Kristen was on break from an SCA internship and was also using it to get over a messed up relationship. I found out that Kristen was currently attending the college I was to attend that coming spring. At the time, I wasn't completely certain if I would still go or move back to Portland. Nevertheless, we got to know each other, we walked around downtown, saw a movie, and drank smoothies.  I have a horrible internal sleep cycle, so on her last day at the hostel I overslept. I was pretty upset when I woke up but there wasn't much I could do. The rest of the trip went ahead and then I went home.  When I got home, I applied again to the school I deferred at, but I also applied to a few others to broaden my horizons. Six months later, I ended up at her school. It was a pretty small campus, only about 800 kids. After all those months I didn't think she'd remember me if we ran into each other again. One day I'm working in the cafeteria and she literally screams and jumps up and down pointing at me saying, ""It's you!"" over and over. As it turns out she was living next door to me for a few weeks in the same dorm and we hadn't known before she moved into a different building.  We started to hang out from that point on and it wasn't ever romantic. We reminisced and learned more about each other until one fateful night under a full moon we shared a kiss. The relationship was touching go for a few years because of college life, but when it all ended we moved in together.  We're coming up on four years from the day we met and she's still lying next to me. And in a few months we're going to start on our journey toward becoming expats in Peru. I couldn't have asked for a better sequence of events."
solotravel,3ckm5y,trebor04,3,Thu Jul 9 00:04:33 2015 UTC,"I met her in Myanmar, of all places. I was with a couple of other people I had met prior to landing in Yangon, and she was alone. She ended up speaking to another guy in my group at a bus station while we were waiting to hit up the beach, and over the next few days she started hanging out with all of us. All three guys in our group took a shining to her immediately. Over the course of ten days, she travelled with me and the rest of the group all the way up through Myanmar to Bagan, and then back down to Yangon again for a flight back to Thailand.  She was supposed to be heading off elsewhere, but kept delaying her flight. Then, I found out she liked me - while I was on a Tinder date with another girl. I left my date pretty promptly and within 48 hours with the girl I had been travelling with for the past two weeks, but had no idea she was into me.  At first it was just sex. I knew she was leaving within the next week/10 days, so tried to avoid getting emotionally attached. But I jus absolutely adored her. She was beautiful, intelligent, funny and like-minded. We got on like a house on fire, and spent 24 hours a day with each other. But she had to go back to Scandinavia for an urgent personal issue, and I knew that this would be the last I saw of her. We spent one last night on Koh Phangan, skipping the full moon party to just lie with each other one last time, reminiscing about the past couple of weeks, and how blind we both were to each other's affection while in Myanmar. Then the next morning, I got up, went with her to the pier, and she sailed away. Immediately I burst into tears and realised I was actually in love with this girl.  Within hours we were messaging each other saying we couldn't be without one another. I was 4 months in to a planned two-year trip, and I had told myself that I wouldn't let love get in the way. But when it's right, it's right... right?  She ended up using the last of her savings to come back out and see me in Vietnam, just three weeks after she had left me in Thailand. She only had two weeks in Vietnam before she had to go back home for work, but we picked up where we left off, and proceeded to enjoy each other's love and company again. I've honestly never felt so in love with anyone. People may say how can you know after only knowing each other for eight weeks, but for five of those eight weeks we were together literally 24 hours a day.  She left me again at Hanoi airport, again in tears. This time was more difficult - she had to start working, and I had no idea when I would see her again. She made me promise I wouldn't abandon my two year trip or my plans to work in China for a time jus for her sake. But I told her it wasn't 'goodbye'; it was 'see you soon'.  I couldn't bear to be without her and flew home myself a week later.  Two weeks after that she told me she couldn't do it, due to the distance and pressure of her job. Hanoi was the last time I saw her, crying into my shoulder while I was holding her tightly, fighting back my own tears. That was over two months ago now. I still feel empty when I think about it. I still love her, and deep down I think she knows she loves me.  I'm just thankful we had any time together, but I don't think I will ever completely get over her."

Randomly met some guys on the beach, and we ended up being friends. I went over to their apartment a week later, and there she was...with her boyfriend. She was visiting him from England for the weekend.  We talked all night and became great friends. She ended up breaking up with her boyfriend soon after for other reasons, but we still stayed friends. A few months later we traveled Europe together.  After that we visited each other every few weeks and fell in love. Now I'm back in the US, and she is coming to visit me this December.   Oh and no regrets. Not a single goddamn one."

I got involved with my coworker/roommate, he got involved with heroin. He fell in love with a drug, I fell into depression trying to cope. 3 months after our first hello's we said goodbye. He left me emotionally so I left him physically. I'm resuming my travels, he's still stuck in our tropical paradise purgatory. I'll more than likely never see him again. The odds are against us because the truth is that if he even gets out of there alive he's lucky.

Turned out to be 1 of the most pleasing connections I had while traveling, she was older than me for almost 10 years (I was 23), very smart and feminist, kinda used that in my favor with silly jokes and brutal honesty.

Then before the next time I was to be in Europe she told me she was tired of missing me and started seeing someone else.  She wanted a normal life and I didn't fit in it.  It had felt like a movie and I was pretty much all in but I still don't know what she felt.  I've been traveling for 2.5 years now so there isn't anything stable or constant in my life, but even with how much she hurt me, those are still some of the happiest memories I have.

On my 18th birthday, I was staying at St. Christopher's in Paris, and was pretty drunk by the time I got to their Halloween party. I continued drinking steadily throughout the night, and around midnight I met this pale-skinned, black-haired, tall American girl. We hit it off, and went and chain-smoked in the smoking area while continuing to imbibe.  Finally, she asked me if I wanted to go back to her place, and as we left, she produced a bottle of wine from out of thin air. This is where it gets fuzzy.  I remember superconfidently drunkenly navigating the metro system to Belleville. I remember us agreeing how much flying while being tall sucks, to which I said ""I think I'm in love.""  ""Don't be silly, it's just the wine.""  I agreed at the time, but in retrospect I don't think I was wrong.  I remember opening her apartment's door on the first try, because she could never get her key to work.  I remember getting back to her place, and her turning on her stereo. ""Rebel Rebel"", by Bowie. What an amazing song.  I don't remember much after that.  I don't go a day without thinking of her. Can't say why. She was a fundamentally interesting person, which are too rare nowadays.  I'm glad I met her. And I don't think I'm wrong to say that I'm absolutely in love with her."
solotravel,3cno82,BazookaZoooka,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:01:19 2015 UTC,"I hiked Mt Fuji about a year ago with my girlfriend overnight. Be sure you're thoroughly prepared, e.g enough snacks, water, warm clothing, waterproof shells, lights etc. Many of the supplies sold at the stations on the way up are a bit overpriced (bathroom use is 300 yen iirc). The hike is pretty intense even from the 5th station and even for an experienced hiker such as myself. The wind and weather can change on a dime at higher altitudes, and the temperature will drop significantly even in mid summer. Many people cut the hike into two legs and rest at predetermined stations generally hiking during the day (which I'd highly recommend), I was forced to hike it over night due to time constraints (I was only in Japan for a week, and Fuji-kawaguchiko for less than 24 hours).  Hiking Mt Fuji was really the only adventure I had near the Fuji five lakes and Fuji-kawaguchiko area, but there's certainly many other equally beautiful hiking trails in the same area. There are also a number of hot springs and lovely bathhouses in the area too.   I was actually in Tokyo for two days before Fuji and had a great time. Depending on your interests (and time constraints) and whether or not you have a JR Pass, and if you're limited on funding, I found I was able to do a greater number of things in Kyoto than in Tokyo. Both cities are incredible in their own way, both representing old Japan and modern respectively. I made two short videos of half my time spent in Japan so far, I haven't gotten around to finishing the rest, but if they can give you any ideas to shape your travels or interests by all means check them out!

solotravel,3cmxxu,jamille4real,5,Thu Jul 9 03:53:38 2015 UTC,"My advice to anyone in these situations is pretty simple:   talk to people in your hostel. You will find out so many interesting places to go. Some will be the normal places (but maybe they have a specific/unique tip!) but sometimes people recommend smaller places you've never heard of that are amazing! when you've found a few places, check out the Wikitravel articles! I'm not sure if anyone else loves Wikitravel as much as I do but I found it to be beyond helpful when I travel. It gives you a great overview of the place and generally has links down the bottom for most things that are mentioned!"

I did 5 months with a carry on sized backpack. If you're interested I'll link it here: http://www.minaal.com/products/minaal-carry-on-bag  Absolutely love the bag. Traveling light not only takes strain off your back, but saves you a ton of money. European budget airlines can hit you very hard (sometimes more than the cost of your ticket) with baggage check fees. Having a carry on sized bag, especially for 21 days, will save you a lot of money as well as time waiting at baggage claim.  Some useful apps include: GoEuro, CityMaps2Go, XE Currency, and Whatsapp. All proved incredibly valuable to me, especially so because I was traveling with phone service (and most importantly, without data).  Winging your trip is the best way to do it. The only thing I will say is that in the high travel season (typically the summer months), hostel availability is much less. I never had to combat this traveling in the fall/winter.   PM me if you have any specific questions."

solotravel,3cm8s0,GrowlerHalfEmpty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:28:45 2015 UTC,"Be aware that the prices for renting a car in Iceland are...painful. I think I paid the low, low price of $98 a day, for the equivalent of a Ford Fiesta. And that was before purchasing coverage against gravel (as not all the roads are made of paved asphalt). Even in the shoulder season (I was there last year in September too) it was crazy expensive. That being said, driving the Ring Road in Iceland is mind-blowingly beautiful. Also, since you should still be getting longish days, know that most parks (outside of winter) are open 24-7, so visiting a popular park like Thingvellir or Reynisfjara Beach at 4 AM is possible, and a great way of experiencing it without the hordes of bus tourists.  Food advice: The svid, or singed sheep head, at the BSI Bus depot near the Reykjavik domestic airport is quite good. I'd recommend eating it hot, though. Saegreifinn's lobster (langoustine?) soup is really good. I don't think it's possible to get a bad pylsur (hot dog) in the country. It's quite cheap and amazingly fast too.

Here is a funny little it's a small world type story:  In Kon Tum I crossed paths with a couple of guys who were also riding motorbikes from HCMC to Hanoi.  They were leaving on my first morning there and we had breakfast together.  We made plans to link up in Hoi An.  We did so and I caught them up on what I had done in Kon Tum, which was teach some English classes for a teacher there.  They thought that sounded like fun and asked me how I went about doing that.  Fast forward to Hanoi.  They told me that they had a great experience teaching in a small town near Vinh.  It was a highlight of the trip for them.  Then 6 months later, I get a facebook friend request from a middle school student in a small town near Vinh.  She tells me that she is excited to have a Western friend and that she has only met two Westerners before, a Canadian and a Dane who visited her school.  I thought, wait a minute, and asked her if she remembered their names.  Immediately she types ""Christian and Jimmy"".  Yep.  Those are my two buddies, and she immediately knows their names, 6 months after meeting them."

No scheduling conflicts, no waiting for someone else to be ready, no dealing with someone who doesn't want to do what you want to do.  If you go there and you meet someone who is doing what you are doing then you can do it together.  If you later choose to do something else, you can go your separate ways.    You sound like a person who knows what they want and how to get it.  Be strong.  Live your life how YOU choose to.  Have a fun trip!"

solotravel,3ck2e2,liliontheloose,2,Wed Jul 8 18:46:59 2015 UTC,travelling alone is not for everybody. Or maybe your sister just cares for you too much.

""Do you think something bad is going to happen to me?  Do you know that tens of thousands of people travel every DAY and nothing happens to them.  I'll have internet and telephone, so you can call me whenever you like,"" etc etc.    She never really got over it (12 years since then and she is always reminding me to call home in email and sending me articles about the bad stuff happening wherever I am), but she has gotten more chill about it.

solotravel,3cjepn,JohhnieDame1980,11,Wed Jul 8 11:16:13 2015 UTC,"Hey there, Canadian here!  (sorry)  The biggest cultural difference between young Canadians and Australians is the sheer volume of swear words.  You may want to tone down that down at first until you feel out your new friends.    Another thing about language - some Australians can be completely impossible to understand for people who aren't used to your accent.  Not only that, but many Canadians will pretend they understand you even if they don't because they don't want to be rude and say ""Pardon?"" 3 times in a row.  You may want to slow down and enunciate a little bit.  That being said - Canadians love Australians, so you should be able to make friends wherever you go.  As for places to see - if you're here in the summer, that's really the only time anyone ever wants to check out the East Coast maritime provinces and Newfoundland.  They are extremely beautiful, especially if you like outdoorsy stuff.  Montreal is amazing for food and parties, Toronto is great for culture and parties, Ottawa is great for sports and parties, Niagara Falls is great if you want to take a picture in front of the falls...  Calgary and Edmonton have some of the nicest people you'll meet, but you just missed the Calgary stampede (unless you can make it there in 4 days), which is the best time to go.  Vancouver is awesome except for all the Vancouverites ;) (just kidding guys, calm down!)  It's a lot more relaxed.  If you do go there, check out rec beach by the univerity - it's the best nude beach I've ever been to.  There are always vendors walking around selling anything you could want!    ""Ice Cold Beer!  Beer here!"" ""Jello!  Refreshing Jello!  There's always room for Jello!"" ""Cookies!  Brownies!  magic mushrooms!""  Anyways, if you know which city you're going to, lemme know and I will give you more recos"

Downtown is lovely, with 19th and early 20th century buildings lining government street. We have the stunning inner harbour, looked over by the legislature building, the Empress hotel and the CPR steamship terminal. It is bustling with artists and street performers, particularly in summer.   Craigdarroch Castle is up Fort Street, about a 30 minute walk or a short bus ride.   The James Bay neighbourhood is great for quiet walks. There is a seaside walking/running route along Dallas Road.   Oak Bay is where the 'old money' live, in rambling mansions throughout the Uplands. A nice place to drive or cycle through.   We have a great many places close by for hiking, from easy hikes up Mt Doug in Saanich to more challenging ones like Mt Finlayson.   There are lots of great restaurants and pubs where you can get ever so popular craft beers. We have a lot of great breakfast/brunch places.   Locals are fairly friendly (particularly when compared to people from big cities), and downtown is easy to get around.   Oh, and I can't leave out Butchart Gardens.

solotravel,3cjepn,ill_mango,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:17:53 2015 UTC,Monthly rent varies widely. I pay $825 for an old one bedroom apartment but you could easily pay $1200 for a new one bedroom condo rental.   Produce is good. Lots of local farms so you can get it locally.   Local foods? What do you mean?
solotravel,3cjepn,the_hardest_part,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:03:48 2015 UTC,Like what kinds of produce is grown locally?  Do you have local meat?  What about cheese and that kind of stuff?  Any Victoria speciality foods?

solotravel,3cjepn,speaks_in_redundancy,3,Wed Jul 8 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"We have a rather giant country, so you're going to have to figure out exactly what you want to see and focus on 1-2 parts of the country, from a logistical point of view.  The way I see it, these are the regions I recommend you focus on:   The Niagara Falls - Toronto - Ottawa - Montreal - Quebec city corridor   This is the most densely populated part of Canada, with quite a bit to see along the way.   The good news is that it sort of lines up for you so that you can figure out transportation logistic without too much bother.  There are also many other towns and sights to see along the way, aside from the ones mentioned.  Algonquin park is beautiful, the Bruce peninsula is out of the way a bit, but perhaps right up your alley - the Bruce trail is well worth it, if you're into hiking - My favourite part is near Lion's head.  This particular part of Canada has enough to keep you busy for months.  So it really depends on what kind of stuff you are into.  There are large metropolitan areas and beautiful parks..  and all sorts of other stuff.   2. The west coast / Vancouver / Rockies  I haven't been out there yet, but if you are into hiking, this is where you want to go.  The Berg Lake trail has been on my list for many years, but I haven't been able to do it yet.  Just look at this picture and tell me that you wouldn't want to  be there - http://i.imgur.com/TyuFRdf.jpg   There are a TON of other hiking opportunities out west, if that's what you're into.  If you're more into urban areas, there's Vancouver, which is pretty in its own right.   3. The east coast  I haven't been out there either, but if you're into smaller fishing towns, good seafood, and nature, then this might be up your alley.  Gros Morne National Park has been on my list for a while, but I haven't had a chance to head there.  Look it up if you're into the great outdoors.    I would go with 1 or 2 of these regions and fly from one to the other.  I don't think you'd really want to spend days on buses traversing the country.  Pick your areas of interest (out of the 3 above), pick a HQ for each one you're interested in, and use buses to get around..  or trains..  but be warned, our train system isn't really that great.  Compared to what the Europeans have, for example, it's..  kind of weak.  The city2city bus options aren't great either, but this will be usually a much cheaper option for you...  or should be anyway.  Hope some of this helps!"

As for patio drinking, I'm rather partial to the Old Triangle or the Split Crow. Always lots of good people around, and typically some live music.  A good place to see any events that might be going on in the city is at www.thecoast.ca. They've always got the latest cool restaurant or neat thing to do in the city.

Your time frame definitely sounds reasonable. The Maritimes aren't huge, so a couple of days in each province is more than enough to get a quick and dirty experience. When you're in Halifax, check out Murphy's boat tours, particularly the Harbour Hopper if you want to get a quick history lesson of the city and see some major landmarks. It's sort of cheesy, but it can be fun. And everyone who works there is super friendly and more than happy to give you a few tips on what to check out in the city (I used to work there, and I loved chatting with tourists and telling them my favourite spots to go)."

solotravel,3ck3hg,GuvnorRoosta,6,Wed Jul 8 15:08:13 2015 UTC,"FYI, that travel warning pertains to FARC and ELN activity, primarily in the Amazon.    The very first paragraph says   Tens of thousands of U.S. citizens safely visit Colombia each year for tourism, business, university studies, and volunteer work. Security in Colombia has improved significantly in recent years, including in tourist and business travel destinations such as Bogota, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Medellin, and Cali.   My girlfriend and I spent two weeks in Colombia back in February.  You have very little to worry about in the way of terrorism or kidnapping.  Stick to the major cities (Bogota, Cali, Medellin, Cartagena, Santa Marta, San Gil) and the smaller areas that are known safe zones for tourists, and you will be fine.  Use particular caution in Bogota, especially at night and especially if traveling outside of La Candelaria.  Don't get black out drunk, don't flash lots of cash or jewelry, be aware of your surroundings, especially at night.  Just use basic travel common sense and you will have no problems.  Colombia is freakin' awesome.  If you end up in Santa Marta, be sure to stay at the The Dreamer hostel.  If you like outdoor shit then don't miss San Gil!"

I also have a friend who was in Cartagena last year who said it was the best place she's traveled to and she's travelled extensively.  I talk to my friends in Colombia tomorrow and I'd be happy to ask them any questions you may have.  I am planning a trip there next year and definitely understand the anxiety you're feeling now."
solotravel,3ck3hg,ArghZombiesRun,3,Wed Jul 8 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"Hey man,  Nothing major so far. I've stumbled along and for the most part I've been with people I've met that were able to speak it to one degree or another. When that wasn't the case I've used Google translate. Definitely get that and download the offline language pack beforehand. Any phrases you can learn will help but as I said I went in cold and haven't been super stressed at all. Some Colombians I have met speak English but not a lot. Generally Colombians seem super friendly and that's definitely a common experience when I discuss it with other travellers.  Personally I think 2-3 days is perfect. I stayed in La Candelaria and liked it, its the old part of town. Heavy police presence but still worth caution at night if alone. Just common sense stuff like no dark alleys. I did the bike tour, took the cable car up Mount Monserratte, went to the gold museum and Botero gallery and took a day trip to the salt cathedral. Didn't see that much of the city itself and probably should have. Apparently the transmilenio bus is really good.   Ask your hostel to arrange a shuttle. Will go hostel to hostel in a small air conditioned minivan. Cost me 42000 cop I think.   I'd say grab Nokia's maps app called Here. You can download an offline map of all of Colombia and GPS still works in flightmode. Found that quite useful.  As I've said I was super nervous about coming here and nearly bailed. SO glad I didn't."

If you have common sense, you will be okay. If you're going to santa marta, then make it to taganga... Beautiful little town on the beach.. From there I'd recommend a hike the lost city (takes something like 4 days) or Parque tayrona."

I started my 4 months in South America in Colombia, specifically in Bogota. I should start by saying I've never once felt unsafe here. If you talk amongst other travellers the common theme is that people generally think it's a lot worse than it is. In Bogota I always left the hostel with very little cash and nothing else; no phone, no camera etc. Slowly but surely I relaxed and routinely bring those things in a day sack now.   Of course I still don't go out much at night alone and avoid certain areas etc. I Don't get too drunk and wander around and I exercise an above average level of caution and try to be as inconspicuous as possible but really, from Medellin onwards it has been wonderful here. Friendly, beautiful, interesting.  I was VERY nervous about Colombia and almost skipped it but I'm so glad I didn't. I'd wholeheartedly recommend you tough out the inevitable nerves and make the trip.   I stayed in Masaya in Bogota and El Viajero in Cartagena and would happily endorse both.

That said, everyone I've met that doesn't speak Spanish has said it's fine. You need to know the numbers, and you'll need to point at what you want, and you'll do ok, I think.

My biggest regret on my recent trip was the amount of clothes I brought. I found myself thinking often that I'd be able to do weeks in SEA with only 3-4 microfiber shirts and a couple pairs of shorts.   Also Thai pants = Best and only type of pants I'd wear in that climate."

However, everyone knows I'm a tourist in SEA and different clothes won't get me around that.   So I figured screw it, I'll just wear what's comfortable."
solotravel,3cieic,OBrambler,5,Wed Jul 8 19:21:47 2015 UTC,"I'd ditch the denim anyway for space reasons. Also thin materials>thick material. It's hot there. If you want something warm (I only needed at night in Pai) keep one pair of pants, but not denim. Also one of the best things I brought for laundry management was travel space-bags. They seal so you can put your wet clothes in them, and they will be wet, whether it's from rain or sweat or washing in the sink at your hostel.   And that bungee that people say you don't need? I used my travel clothesline all the time, to create a little private space in the bottom bunk at hostels and draped a sarong over the side. (as well as to dry stuff)   Have a blast!"

solotravel,3ci4bt,rambosis,2,Wed Jul 8 02:16:15 2015 UTC,What are you planning to see in Lima??  I would highly recommend visiting Arequipa or Cusco and the Sacred Valley if you were wanting to visit Peru.   I travelled from Lima to La Paz over 3 weeks using public buses and doing it all in one hit sounds like an absolute nightmare.   Ormeno and Rutas De America are two companies that do the full trip and they take 30-36 hours.
solotravel,3ci4bt,cupp95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:12:20 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! I'm coming to the idea that I might just stay in Peru and leave Bolivia for another time. Lima is just where I'm flying into as it's really cheap to fly into ($600 round-trip). Definitely want to do Machu Pichu (a must right?). Then the rest is up in the air for me but I think I can make a month out of just Peru. Especially since I'm working two weeks.  Cusco I've heard about and will definitely be doing. Sacred Valley sounds fun. Any path you would take if you were going to do a full circle and end back in Lima for a departure?
solotravel,3ci4bt,dat_buck,2,Wed Jul 8 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"Do you plan on hiking at all to Machu Picchu? Or taking the bus from Cusco route?  I only have two things to say:  Cusco is a BEAUTIFUL city (also hosts the highest-altitude Irish pub in the world - great for meeting other travelers). Do not skip out on it. Most of Lima is overcast half the time and the people are about what you would expect from a country's business hub. Imo, not totally interesting. Cusco holds much more culture.  I highly recommend finding a tour group to hike through some of the Andes to get to Machu Picchu. As beautiful as the site is, it's like a Disney world for a city of wonders. By the time it hits noon it's chalk-full of (sorry- ugly) tourists. Not to mention there isn't much to do after a few hours of walking around there. Hiking through the Andes is multitudes more beautiful. An added bonus is that you can encounter the truest culture Peru can offer - the people who still live and farm in the mountains. They make a killer (read: nasty) alcohol out of corn. They're generally quite friendly too.  TLDR; Cusco is better than Lima and hiking through the Andes to reach Machu Picchu is better than taking a bus to the site.  Just my .02 but I would guess that anyone who has been around those parts would agree with me whole heartedly.  Near the Machu Picchu site is a small town called Aquas Calientes. It's quaint and has a decent bit to offer - trains back to bigger cities (oh man, those trains have spectacular views), decent food (TRY ALPACA AND CUY WHILE YOU ARE IN PERU - Cuy is guinea pig), and some hot springs to relax in. The only downside is that the town gets more and more touristy every year, but what can you do?  I hope you enjoy your time :) don't just go for the classic sites, go for the natural beauty of the country and the spectacular culture it has to offer. Peruvians are quite friendly."
solotravel,3ci4bt,cupp95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:34:07 2015 UTC,I hiked through the Lares Valley before Machu Picchu and it was just amazing. Can't believe people live out there in the way they do.
solotravel,3ci4bt,cupp95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:54:09 2015 UTC,"So Machu Picchu you access via Cusco and Sacred Valley.  General recommendation is to stay 1 or 2 nights in Cusco to acclimatise then do a daytrip to Sacred Valley. From there either stay a night in Ollyantaytambo and start Inca Trek the following morning. Alternatively if you're not interested in the Inca Trek you could get the late afternoon train to Aguas Calientes, stay there overnight and be ready to go to Machu Picchu in the morning.   When I went to Peru we went Lima - Paracas - Nazca - Arequipa - Colca Canyon - Cusco - Sacred Valley - Machu Picchu - Cusco - Lake Titicaca - La Paz.  You could easily go Lima - Arequipa - Cusco (as this will also help with the acclimatising) and then either fly or take a direct bus from Cusco back to Lima at the end of your trip."

Great way to get your bearings.  Obviously safety rules apply (don't do this at night, if an area feels sketchy you should turn around, carry a map or be able to speak the language just in case, etc.)  Another thing I love to do but takes a bit more research is find one of the highest points in the city and climb up it for the view."

solotravel,3cflkk,curious_investor_,3,Tue Jul 7 22:35:08 2015 UTC,"My favorite, first thing to do is to set my watch to the correct time. My first trip abroad no one in my family had a watch, not even an alarm clock (this was pre smart phones). Due to jet lag we woke up at odd hours, we stayed up late. It made going to tourist attractions hard as they closed so ""early"" for us, and our meals were always at weird times.  So now, when I switch the time on my watch, I smile a bit and remember that, and I get excited for what lies ahead of the trip. I also am a huge planner, so my watch is a lifeline to me to know how much time is available to me."
solotravel,3cflkk,the_hardest_part,3,Wed Jul 8 03:21:36 2015 UTC,"I like to wonder around by bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, whatever I can get.  This is also a great way to scout the place out.    In fact, if I'm traveling by moto, I will often start by wondering all around town and seeing what looks good/lively/interesting.  A big part of my hotel picking decision is how well situated it is and whether it looks lively or dead.  If a hotel is on a street with restaurants, cafes, etc, it's a big bonus.  You can walk out, hang out, come back to your room easily.  On the other hand, if a hotel is in the middle of nowhere in some sketchy alley with no people and few guests, I skip it.    Edit: looking at other responses, I see that pretty much everyone is writing the same thing about scouting out their new environment and wondering around.  :)"

Not sure what your budget is but if you can afford it, rent a car. In hostels there are always flyers about people wanting to split the cost of rentals so that's an option too. If you're feeling super adventurous, hitchhiking is amazingly safe there and the people are very nice so you shouldn't have any issues finding a ride."

solotravel,3cghoi,k1llingt1m3,11,Tue Jul 7 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"I think you and your friend need to each make a list of the places you wish to go and then compare notes and see if there are overlapping cities. Are you looing for history, beaches, art, or just partying?  Use Skyscanner.com and play around with flights. There are some real deals on there. For example I just booked a flight for next week to Brussels from Miami for 160$ one way... In regards to money I would say you usually spend between 35 - 40 Euros a day, That includes Hostels, buses, trains, and light meals. Obviously there are days you spend more if you go out for a night of heavy drinking and a club. If there are two of you going I would check out Airbnb. You can find some good apartments in a few cities for 40 euros a night. So pretty much your splitting the same amount of money for a personal apartment compared to a bed in a hostel room with 4 other people. There are no absolute desitnations to go to.. everyone is different and enjoys different places...."
solotravel,3cghoi,LeftHandMonkeyWrench,2,Tue Jul 7 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"One of the easy ways to start is grab a decent travel book. The market for themed travel books is huge these days and usually pretty well done. Grab a Europe book from the library and have a flick through. You'll quickly start taking an interest in certain towns and activities and then you can use the internet to learn more. Spend a few mins a day flicking through, even if it's just looking at the pics, you'll soon find something you're interested in.   For an idea of money, check some hostel prices in the places you want to go and local prices and start estimating how much you would spend on an average day in a city. I traveled for 18mths and never kept a spreadsheet or budget app to keep track, I'm good with money and know when to splurge and when to save for destinations/activities ahead."

It's probably not what you're looking for right now but I suggest keeping both places in mind for a future trip maybe. Look into going to the Grand Canyon and doing a hike to the bottom (you will need a pass acquired in advance to stay down there though). I believe there's white water rafting on the river but I didn't do it.  I hate LA (I've been there twice) and hope to never go back. Death Valley is surprisingly beautiful.

I think the thing to keep in mind is ""when in Rome do as the Romans do."" Don't make yourself obvious (wear pride bracelets and such). I know that hiding who you are is not what everyone wants to do, but it's something we just have to do when visiting a hostile country.   The most gay friendly place in the world is probably the Netherlands. People there seriously do not give a damn if you're gay or straight. Now with that being said - there is some anti-gay violence to be aware of that mainly comes from immigrants.  On a side note - the strangest ""gay"" experience I had in another country was Lithuania. Although it is not illegal or anything - it's still not exactly culturally accepted to be gay. Grindr had a single person showing up within 400 miles (I had to say hello to this lonely individual).  I went to a gay club with a friend and it was the most sterile environment I ever seen. The dance floor reminded me of a 6th grade dance with the teacher keeping 6 inches of separation between everyone."

First, if you're OK with skipping expensive attractions and activities, living on $20/day is easy in Thailand if you limit the amount you move around.  As for making money, the most common ways are teaching English (a guy I was just talking to is moving to Hanoi and going to make $25/hr) and working in Australia/New Zealand. If you're from a North American or European country, you can get a 1-year working holiday visa to Australia or New Zealand. Basically you move there and get a regular job for up to a year. Pay is very good in these countries (~$20/hr), and you can save up money to continue traveling elsewhere."

I'm currently in Australia on a WHV now, and whilst Aus is expensive, the wages are really good. I worked in Melbourne for a few months and am now waiting to do some fruit picking. If you budget and are sensible with your money you could save quite a lot in Australia. Different countries have different rules when it comes to getting a WHV. It's much easier if you're from countries like the UK, Canada, or Germany. I think it's harder if you are from the States but it's still possible."

Just a day or only a couple hours.  Or do walking tours and pub crawls.  The downside is everyone is staying at different hostels/hotels/guesthouses. So if you meet anyone cool, it's good to plan where to meet later before you get dropped off separately.  ""Hey, want to grab a drink at 10 at that pub we walked past on the tour?"""

When I want to travel I can switch shifts around with coworkers and book days off. If I take one rotation off work (7 days) I technically get 21 days off. I've worked here for two and a half years so far, travelled a total of 73 days as well as had the time to explore my own backyard. Things like camping, skiing, hiking, or just hitting the gym are easy now too, and I can usually avoid crowds and traffic.  The job obviously has its downsides. My social life at home suffers, and I'm left with a lot of times during the day where everyone else is working.  Overall though it has been worth it, I have enough income to both spend and save, and the opportunity to take off fairly frequently."

I am an instrumentation technician, a branch of automation. It's a fantastic field with a diverse range of jobs. It varies from place to place, but here you can obtain a ticket by doing a four year apprenticeship, or by going to school and for a instrumentation engineering technology diploma followed by a two year apprenticeship. I did the second, since that diploma qualifies me to engineer in my field. Look up instrumentation at your local tech/trade schools or colleges, they'll show you what the prospects look like in your area.   Of course, if you want to skip the schooling and just get out there, rigs are always looking for hands for the hard work. Oil may need to pick up first though."

During the year I'm a casual working at a supermarket checkout - doesn't sound too glamorous but by the end of the year when summer break rolls around, I have enough to backpack overseas for 2-3 months depending on location. The supermarket I work at is a huge chain that employs a shit ton of casuals at each store so they have no problems just not rostering me for 2-3 months then letting me come back to work. I kind of love it, the 2-3 month travel break - makes me really not look forward to when I start full time work and only have 4 weeks of annual leave. Through uni I'm also going on a year exchange to France during which you can bet I'll travel through Europe."

I'm trying to get a gig like that myself so I can travel full time.  9-5 has its perks (dependable hours, benefits, cute coworkers, etc.). But after a number of years of it, I'm ready for a change.  Zion and Bryce are absolutely gorgeous, but very popular so they are crowded. My favorite place to visit was Goblin Valley, hands down. There is primitive camping (no running water or electricity), and the entire valley is completely open, there are no trails. I spent the whole day climbing to the top of a mountain, then have a (solo) dance party at the top. FYI, they also filmed Galaxy Quest there ""By Grapthar's hammer, you shall be avenged!""  Arches National Park is also amazing, but also very popular. Get to the park before 7am to beat the crowds.  If you search around, you can find free camping spots through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM Land). These sites go quickly, but it's FREE camping!"

Sitting inside a cubicle all day refreshing an excel spreadsheet while a libertarian boss gives out dark forebodings and all of your superiors intentionally create gridlock in order to maintain job security.  Never.Again.    I will skip my planning, execution etc. unless your really want to hear it, but I ended up moving to a tropical island to teach. I got established and started pulling in private courses at around (converted) $30/hr, and then got into university teaching.  A girl I was dating at the time offered me to start working for a company in Beijing that does online teaching.  I get direct deposit in my US account (I am sure this has something to do with where they signed the company in for tax reasons, but I don't really care as long as the money comes in) at about $10.50 per 25-min class.    It is both positive and negative.  You pick when you are available, so it is pretty legit and as long as you are not a complete ass head you should be able to acclimate pretty well. However, I am still working regular jobs and need a lot of money,so it gets kinda exhausting.  The company has so many new opportunities to engage the teachers and is very communicative.  They also put in a lot of competitions and extra work opportunities and have visible levels of growth, although I do not know how much of it I would prefer to capitalize on.   I make about 1500/month, but I work pretty hard at it. As I said before, I will be doing grad.studies in Northern Europe, so I need another supplement while I live there, because the loans don't stop for nobody. Overall, it is pretty sweet and has the potential to be a full-time career if I wanted.  I tested travelling and teaching and once you get used to it, it is pretty easy (if you don't mind retreating periodically to teach ABC's while on vacation). I prefer immersing myself in the countries I stay in,  so I usually just tailor my schedules to the busy work hours, anyway.   I would really hope to get some good freelance writing in soon or maybe some online teaching with Spanish students, but I haven't found a good one that matches the pay and I can trust yet.

There is no way I would have purchased it if I had more places to visit than 1 week in Tokyo.   Other trips, even though I have souvenirs, I can't remember all the things I know I did.

solotravel,3cel5p,crownsandclay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:24:10 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how long you'll be in Barcelona but I would check out the Fiesta de San Fermin which is going on right now: http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/  Finding a hostel now may be hard if not impossible but you may have some luck couch surfing or air bnb. I also met a few people who have taken a bus/train up in the morning and either partied all night or slept in a park (they have places to store your bags) and left the next day.
solotravel,3cel5p,impy695,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:33:13 2015 UTC,I'm in Barca till the 11th! Luckily I'm already staying at St. Christopher's. Thanks for the recommendation on the festival!

Once you head south from the east side of the river nightlife starts pooping up pretty quick. It's a pretty good place for meeting other tourists just sitting on the terrace sipping a beer, they're usually excited to meet people (even other tourists) too. Not to mention the Czechs I met were all preeeetty talkative"

solotravel,3ccpda,chilledmoscato,2,Tue Jul 7 00:01:41 2015 UTC,Newpraguetours.com I've done both the free tour and Kutna Hora tour and very highly recommend both of them. There's also a few groups offering pub crawls later at night.
solotravel,3ccpda,Aboot_Tree_Fiddy,3,Tue Jul 7 04:36:14 2015 UTC,"Find a hostel with a bar, you usually don't need to be a guest in order to sit and have some drinks. Then just chat up some other travellers."

solotravel,3ccpda,mightbemowgli,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:21:12 2015 UTC,"I second Courchsurfing, also meetup.com (unsure if its popular in Prague), or looking to see if there is a Prague subreddit and if they have any meetups. Even if they don't it cannot hurt to ask. I saw someone here post about wanting to meet people in Egypt, was suggested to post on /r/Egypt and sure enough because of that request they are now doing a subreddit meetup! Its great to see the community connect together.  Besides that, maybe look for parks, see if you can join in on a impromptu soccer game, or head to a cafe and offer to buy someone something if they share a story with you. Things like that. Alternatively google ex-pat bars in your city, or just head to a sports pub and watch a game."
solotravel,3ccpda,brittanymc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:46:19 2015 UTC,Just left Prague a few days ago. You can always do a pub crawl or one of the boat parties. Chapeau Rouge and Golden Tree also seemed to be two pretty popular bars with travelers. Lucerna is a really fun 80s and 90s themed club worth checking out.
solotravel,3cdc0c,FluxAnomaly,3,Tue Jul 7 00:55:21 2015 UTC,I would get rid of the zip of trousers and instead take one pair of nicer trousers (suitable for dinner in a nice restaurant but still casual enough for day wear if you get a cooler day) and maybe an extra pair of shorts instead. You'll never wear the zip off trousers with the legs zipped on and they look god awful.   If you have the room I'd take the dressy shirt. If you don't have the room get rid of the long sleeved tshirt and take the dressy shirt instead.
solotravel,3cdc0c,crownsandclay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:04:31 2015 UTC,"Cut down 1 pair of underwear. If you get some ExOfficio, you can wash them in the sink and dry them overnight.  Replace the hoodie with merino wool hoodie. Much more expensive, but better than regular cotton (warm when wet).  Keep the dressy shirt for when you go clubbing or get a date ;-)  You may want to get a shell (windbreaker) if you arrive during rainy season.  Remember you can always buy more clothes if you run low."
solotravel,3cdwg5,SOTravelHelp,3,Tue Jul 7 03:48:49 2015 UTC,"There was a thread on here ~6 months ago that offered lots of suggestions for exactly that - quiet, great beaches with a pretty good community.  I'll see if I can dig it up.  Edit: Here it is.  I'm curious - how old are you?  And are there other backpackers in Pai that seem more genuine and laid-back."
solotravel,3cdwg5,notactuallyabus,3,Tue Jul 7 05:42:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, it'll help assess islands and where to head to if I make my way south.  I'm mid-20s. There's definitely genuine people here. If you're ever here or plan to head here PM me and I'll send you the details of a local place where, seemingly, the best people congregate to. Establishment is run by a local family and they're beyond wonderful, so it's no surprise a lot of the retired foreigners congregate there. Beyond that they know everyone and everything.  However, there's essentially three packs of backpackers here:   Dreadlocks, tie-dye, always carrying a guitar. Why? Because they are quickly accepted into a community of others similar to themself, based on the superficial, instead of any personal merits. Heard that joke ""how can you tell if someone is vegan?"" I'm reminded of it a good dozen or two times a day. Scantily clad teens that overheard that this is a place backpackers go and try to treat it like one of the islands. Pretty easy to spot: lots of bros that have fallen off motorbikes and taken last night's one-night stand with them, both covered in bandages, because they were getting day drunk and didn't imagine the roads to be either dirt roads or mountainous. The Chinese. Nothing wrong with them personally, but from what I've seen/listened to from locals, they travel differently. China's nearby so it's more like a holiday for them, so they travel in BIG groups of friends and pack in stores or fill the tiny roads in town causing traffic. Then they all decide to get on bikes and whiz around the mountains causing a lot of accidents. Apparently one dropped into the canyon recently taking a selfie with a group of friends and dropped in (canyon paths are thin as fuck and NOT to be treated like happy-go-fun-time in a large group). A speaker for the Thai tourist board made a comment about Chinese tourists and how their behaviour needs to be checked if they wish to come visit here (as stated by a local, but I could believe it's true).   All in all. There's a lot to do. An awful lot. A big portion of the community that live here are great. A lot of visitors mis-represent what this place is and how they should be a little more self-aware in comparison to island living. I've had more fun exploring here than anywhere else. I've met some of the nicest people on my travels here. However, the HEAVY tourism here seems to have dissolved what this place looks to have originally tried to evolve into.  PS. Forgot to mention. Fuck the fucking Circus Resort. Selfish fucks. Beyond the bamboo bridges are little sections of bungalows made for swaying on hammocks, chilling, and listening to the wildlife. And all you can fucking hear is those cunts on the hill blaring trash remnants of the 90s and some of the worst DJing to have ever bled my ears."
solotravel,3cdwg5,notactuallyabus,2,Tue Jul 7 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"I guess this is the inevitable result of a place becoming known for being pretty awesome and hippie-like... everyone wants to experience it.  How have you found the backpacker community in general around SE Asia?  I'm headed there this winter, so I've wondered how much of it is really just the 18-22 year old party crowd and how much of it is people that I'd really enjoy hanging out with."
solotravel,3cdwg5,notactuallyabus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming winter being Oct - Feb time? It's going to be hell'a busy at that time and much more expensive, so account for both. Pai as an example: bungalow I'm staying at (10 min walk from town) is 200 baht a night now, 500 when you'll be here; the other four haven't been fully booked at any point, but later this year you'll need to book in advance and will be moving about a bit due to others pre-booking the room you're in.  I much prefer the crowd in Vietnam. Generally older, have mostly travelled already (especially SEA), and seem to have gotten the party over and done with, thus prefer nights sat by the road of Bui Vien enjoying the company.  Here it's like a twisted vision of The Beach. Generally much younger, with a good portion of very elderly travellers mixed in. Vast majority are looking to get drunk, get into some form of escapade which leads to an embarrassing story they can share, then repeat. They fill up the tours in the day so they can kill time before they get drunk again. If this isn't your kind of crowd and can afford private rooms, I'd suggest it. Those looking for the quieter side of exploring congregate away from dorms and such. Met a guy last week in the bungalow next door, late-30s, and he's been exploring on and off with and the SO while we'll share beers in hammocks as the sun goes down.  You'll learn to adapt to whatever suits your needs. Here it can be a bit harder to ignore what you don't like, however."
solotravel,3cdwg5,_candyman_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:21:55 2015 UTC,"That's very useful info, thanks.  I really don't want to pre-book everything.  I'm headed to SE Asia as part of a RTW trip and was planning on December for Thailand and moving on from there, but maybe I'll make it there in November instead.  I'm assuming that the rest of SE Asia won't be quite as crowded in December-February.  In that region I'm planning on going to Myanmar, Vietnam, and maybe Laos/Cambodia after Thailand.  I'm late 20's so getting shitfaced every day would get old pretty quick... so I was planning on staying away from the party hostels as long as I can still meet people easily elsewhere."
solotravel,3cdwg5,IsThatSickInFinnish,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:09:43 2015 UTC,"You can definitely find some quiet and beautiful beaches. Just because I've been there twice, I'd say to check out Koh Samui and just stay away from Chaweng and maybe even Lamai. Get a motorbike and explore the island, there are plenty of peaceful areas."

solotravel,3cdwg5,IsThatSickInFinnish,0,Tue Jul 7 14:41:44 2015 UTC,"This question gets asked about 3 times a day in this sub.

solotravel,3ccwhe,M3moogle,4,Mon Jul 6 22:50:41 2015 UTC,"Chip and signature works perfectly fine. PIN does make things a bit more convenient in some cases (like allowing you to use ticket machines) but even then Visa changed their rules such that it's not strictly necessary any more. Of course, there's no guarantees that the machine you're using got upgraded in time so a card with a kiosk/ticket machine PIN might still be good as a backup.  BTW, the Schwab card is also chip and signature except at ticket machines and the like, just like the Arrival+ and similar cards."
solotravel,3ccwhe,tmiw,2,Mon Jul 6 23:08:41 2015 UTC,"Whoa! First time reading this! Awesome information, thank you."
solotravel,3ccwhe,Rittersspare,2,Tue Jul 7 00:03:26 2015 UTC,"I was stoopid and didn't get the charles schwab card before hand   You can get the card within a week after you deposit $15.   Anyways, I have this chase freedom card and it has a chip, but it's chip and signature and after talking to two different people@chase they claim that my chip isn't designed to be used with a pin...    They're right. The pin they'll give you is for withdrawing money... which will charge you a cash advance fee or/and a foreign transaction fee.   I requested one anyways but they stated its only supposed to be used with cash withdrawls....   What?"
solotravel,3ccwhe,tmiw,2,Mon Jul 6 23:02:15 2015 UTC,"Some ticket machines have been known to not strictly follow how the card's configured and ask for a PIN anyway. The cash advance PIN may work at those and won't cause OP to get charged cash advance fees, but this isn't supported and he won't get any help from Chase if he runs into problems. More likely he won't get asked for the PIN at all since they're supposed to be able to handle signature-only cards now."

solotravel,3cav94,vivereloud,8,Mon Jul 6 16:02:30 2015 UTC,"They carry a backpack.   I've met people of all types while travelling, many were what you'd consider backpackers. They are pretty much all races, ages, genders, etc. Some really quite lovely, others not so much. Just like everywhere else in the world. Sure, it skews more towards Westerners/people from richer countries, and perhaps a younger crowd as well, but it's by no means restricted to those types of people. I've met people who are backpackers who could easily be my grandparents."
solotravel,3cav94,FluffyKittenSnuggles,8,Mon Jul 6 14:02:14 2015 UTC,"They insist they're not a tourist They regularly tell other backpackers that they want to meet the locals They want to stay with the locals and so refuse to stay at the Hilton that all the domestic tourists go to, instead choosing hostels and home stays frequented by backpackers.   All tropes aside I think the difference between backpackers and tourists is that it's often more about the act of travel than the destination; in theory it's cheaper and lasts longer but that is not always the case.  As for a list of characteristics most typical backpackers:   Speak 2 -3 languages (quite often more but not fluently) Typically 18 - 35 Adventurous See travel as an opportunity to do something rather just a way to de-stress"
solotravel,3cav94,dbxp,6,Mon Jul 6 18:13:47 2015 UTC,"The traditional definition - to me - is the people who pack a freakin' giant camping backpack and go place to place, looking for the cheapest everything. They're the ones who pitch a tent on a fairly busy city street in Chiang Mai to save on $6 dorm cost and if they stay in a hostel, they usually cook their food and stay in to drink cheap alcohol they bought in some market.   But things are changing.  A lot of younger people are ""flashpacking"".  Most would not consider themselves ""backpackers.""  More than anything, the term seems to refer to people who (1) are traveling decently long, (2) don't have exact schedules and go where they decide at short notice.  Many are backpacking from hotel to hotel, eating out at all sorts of non-cheap places, and don't mind paying a premium for something that looks interesting and memorable."
solotravel,3cav94,witoldc,4,Mon Jul 6 16:35:30 2015 UTC,"There are many ways to look at it, but the one that makes sense to me is looking at market tiers. You have your luxury travel types, your budget travelers -- and you have backpackers, who are often budget oriented as well, but make up their own distinct market. Backpackers actively pursue a traveler's lifestyle, and are willing to forego frills to achieve that. Do note, this is not necessarily due to budget -- some backpackers tote expensive gear -- but rather the mentality of preferring a stripped down approach to travel.  There's also a lot of overlap between backpackers (as a market) and adventure/camping enthusiasts."

National parks, forests, lakes (the upper peninsula comes to mind in particular) -- it's relatively close by and it has what you're looking for, and you pass through some interesting states to get to it.   I'm from Chicago so my trek to Michigan is much shorter, and I haven't traveled solo yet either (although I hope to soon!) Good luck!!"
solotravel,3cd0pe,endlesspostcards,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:07:18 2015 UTC,"This is an awesome idea but it's a little too far and I wouldn't want to cram it into a weekend bookended by a long drive.

Ryanair charges for bags up to 33lbs, and a carry on had to be like 10lbs, so there was no way I was gonna make that. I'm actually starting in NYC and fly out to Ireland on Friday.

Also /r/travel might have some general tips for where you want to go and I think there is a link about women's safety in their sidebar. I found that Europe is relatively safe as a woman and I didn't need to take any more precautions than I do walking around large American cities. If you really are that scared you might feel better doing a group tour, but in my opinion they can be too restrictive."

I haven't felt unsafe anywhere, even out at night, except for one incident in the Barcelona metro.  After that I started always having my stab cat keychain out, and that has helped with my peace of mind greatly. It also helps meeting locals (I met some in bars and some on language exchange websites) and they can help keep you away from more 'dangerous' neighborhoods."
solotravel,3cbcu5,MareadoMer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:05:13 2015 UTC,"Most people on this sub will advocate solo traveling instead of group tours, but if you are interested in that then I recommend G Adventures, or similar companies like Intrepid, Top Deck, or Contiki.  I've only ever used G Adventures, and have been pleased so far with their tours. They will pair you up with a roommate so you don't get hit with the dreaded ""single supplement"" fee. I've been eyeing them for a Spain/Portugal tour as it looks like a lot of fun and covers all the places I'd want to see."

I just got here last night so while my advice is limited right now, I'll fill you in on what I can: on the customs form, it says ""country/ address of residence; I put down my US address. At the counter, they had to jot down the actual Nica address on the form but he was very nice about my misunderstanding. Don't forget to change over at least a little bit of cash to the Córdoba. I ended up overpaying my taxi driver in dollars and will have to track down a place in town asap. Will update later today with more info  Took a microbus to Chinandega, and rented a nice private room for $9 with dinner at a nearby restaurant for $2. This morning, I took a chicken bus back to Leon, and spent the day exploring. So far so good! On the streets, lots of people honk and whistle. I've been getting hit on a lot, but it's not overly creepy so I just let it be. The only negative experience was after the microbus: two guys near my age come up to me asking if I need a taxi. I look up and say ""no, gracias"" since I already had a driver. So one of them yells, ""ay bitch!"" With a shit eating grin on his face. The driver I'd talked to before they showed up tapped me on the shoulder and we walked away.."

I brought snacks and breakfast food (granola and powdered milk) and then ate lunch and dinner at teahouses. No guide necessary, a friend might not be a bad idea but you would be fine on your own.

solotravel,3caovx,SASQUATCH55,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"-Nepal was my first solo trip! Loved it there. I also did some volunteering during my stay(2013). I waited until I got there to decide what trek I wanted to do. So pending any time limits and preference do it when you get there. I did the Poon hill trek part of the annapurna circuit. 5 days in total. I believe one day was a rest day because we fell sick(beware of altitude sickness). You can get a guide if you like. I met a fellow traveller(while volunteering) and we did the trek together once we got the map. You also need to pay for permits.  -I was 23 when I did my trek, female also so no worries about safety. Everyone I came across was very hospitable. The little teahouses aren't bad, small rooms with a common shared bathroom. Get good shoes, some slipping does happen especially when it rains. So mind your footing.    I do recommend when you get there to buy granola bars and electrolyte supplements. They come in powder form and can be mixed in water. I know it's TMI but I had diarrhoea amidst the trek. Anyway antidierrhea meds came in handy along with the supplements. It helps with altitude sickness. Also, may I suggest body wipes(wet ones?)   -Check out Chitwan national park if possible. Stay in Pokhara for some time as well. Such a beautiful place! Lot's of temples to see. As for where I stayed in Kathmandu, it was Kathmandu Peace Guest house. Great people :) Rooms were not so bad and right near the touristy area of Thamel.   -There are timed power outtages during the day where there is no electricity. I don't know how it is now post-earthquake amidst the recovery.   -I hope you love it. Nepal holds such a special place in my heart. Great experience, make the most of it! Things are pretty cheap. You can get a travel book now but they also have them there. Enjoy :) Edit: spacing."

Power strip -- great idea!  No fun to have a dead phone in a bus station or hostel where all of the outlets are taken.  I had a pocket charger for my phone but only 3200mAh, would recommend something more powerful for anyone considering one. Peshtemal -- also a great suggestion.  I used damp towels more times than I'd care to say.  Also in a pinch could be used as an extra layer of warmth on a bus or if sleeping in a cold room?

Even though it sucks carrying something heavy, it's still miles better than rolling your luggage on the super uneven cobblestone. I promise."
