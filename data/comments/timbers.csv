Manning was signed to T2 after being a SuperDraft pick this year (http://www.timbers.com/post/2015/03/29/portland-timbers-loan-five-players-t2)  re: Tshuma, he was on loan to OC Blues and AZ United last season, then loaned to T2.

On the other hand, as a captain he should be able to know when it's best to just keep his mouth closed and roll with it, or risk setting a bad example for the rest of the team to follow.   Like I said, I'm torn. Not the biggest desk in the world, but just a couple weeks ago our team chemistry was through the roof, and this is just a little worrying.   RCTID"

Most of it is pretty much true...;-)  ""Portland's pitch is not only below street level but sits above an actual running stream -- Tanner Creek, which empties into the Willamette River -- and exhaustive studies have shown that they can't have proper drainage in that specific site and also protect the creek. Field's been in place since the 19th Century (this is a true fact: first soccer match played on that spot was 1894; there are newspaper clippings), and it has had artificial turf on it since it became available in the late '60s."""

timbers,3dzb5r,mrgerbek,6,Tue Jul 21 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Here is a good article written by MLSsoccer in 2013. Merritt Paulson has said that he likes the idea of natural grass but there a few hurdles before converting over to natural grass. Also, important to note, the turf at Providence Park has received a 2/2 star rating ever year since joining MLS.     According to this article from the same time period (2013), MP states ""the chances of grass at Jeld-Wen within the next few years at 50-50.""     So what's the main issue? The reason MP isn't so eager to switch over to natural grass is because of the football games played in the stadium later in the season. When football season starts, natural grass growth slows down considerably which would cause a huge problem for the Timbers (and the Portland State University football team). It just wouldn't be possible because of the toll that the PSU football team would do to the grass.   IMO, MP will never transfer over to natural grass until PSU football finds a different home."
timbers,3dzb5r,Ragnar_Targaryen,3,Mon Jul 20 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"MP actually touches on this briefly in an interview the team site posted today (http://www.timbers.com/post/2015/07/20/interview-merritt-paulson-timbers540)  He mentions the creek, little light, and ""obligations to the city"" as obstacles, but they continue to ""take a hard look"" at a change of surface.

If the captain of the team thinks a ref's officiating is putting his team in danger (which it clearly was), he's got every right to tell him so. Maybe WJ's words were poorly chosen (I wonder if he said anything about that humungous belly Guzman is sporting these days), but the message was on point."

Nagbe needs to be aggressive (which sadly never changes). The crosses were not good and we never got enough men in the box to be too threatening.   Midfield: Sloppy, too many give aways for nothing. Bad passes, poor decision with the ball. Inability to see the open lane. The good, Chara was playing lights out.   Defense: Not organized but not bad per-say had to absorb a lot of pressure that the midfield should have picked up. Borchers save was damn good hustle. Formation when combined with the midfield had no shape.   Overall game plan. The subs came in too late in my opinion, never got to affect the game as it was already out of hand by that point.

timbers,3dwn9z,duganda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:25:42 2015 UTC,"Well, the other way to look at this is that Melano wasn't coming to Portland without DP status.  So the Timbers could go out and find a (a) proven goal scorer at the $5 million fee / $1 million salary level that would have little to no resale value because they are 30-31; (b) a proven goal scorer in a lower league at those dollar amounts at a younger age, so they may have resale value; or (c) a young player with a higher ceiling and far higher future sale value but less of a record.  They chose (c).  And frankly, I can't strongly disagree with their decision.  I was in the group that said they should have gone out and found a more proven scorer because they already had Adi and Urruti, but I also think the roster they have is competitive if the play well - meaning the roster is acceptable and it's on Porter and the players to produce.  Melano is an investment, which carries an inherent amount of risk - if he kills it in MLS they do well and can sell him on for twice their buying price.  If he doesn't they may be out the money.  But you can get a much higher possible ceiling for this money than you can a proven goal scorer.  And that's the choice they made."
timbers,3dwn9z,fletch420man,6,Tue Jul 21 23:41:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry OP but I disagree- WHile I may be newer to soccer in most all sport quality teams are built thru youth, not aged free agents. I am looking forward to seeing this young man on the pitch- he looks fast as all shit-"
timbers,3dwn9z,fletch420man,3,Mon Jul 20 05:22:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. Build with youth. But you still need guaranteed talent. Which I would prefer to use our dp spots for, not a player you have to develop. I'm not saying this guy won't be good or anything like that, he looks promising from highlight reels (as anyone else does). I'm just saying, using a dp spot for something that's needs development or isn't proven is a bit of a gamble."
timbers,3dwn9z,leo_eris,2,Mon Jul 20 05:31:49 2015 UTC,"Fair enough- But it seems to me (I'm still learning the ins and outs of soccer mechanics) that much higher level clubs/leagues get first pick of the talent, so MLS level clubs are left to grab prospects before they are proven and snapped up by premier leagues- But again I'm still not fully in understanding about how player movement is handles within all the leagues and such. Cheers"

timbers,3dwn9z,Animasta,-3,Mon Jul 20 04:13:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not on the Drogba bandwagon. But, he's been linked to talking with Chicago and montreal. If he's talking with them, why couldn't we be in talks with a big name like that. I would love to see timbers get someone like jack mcinerney. (Spelling?)"
timbers,3dwn9z,brocklese,6,Mon Jul 20 04:20:01 2015 UTC,"Drogba is ancient and ""someone like jack Mack"" LOL what? How about you bite your tongue until the guy plays."

timbers,3dwn9z,Animasta,3,Mon Jul 20 04:58:00 2015 UTC,"Why would we want Drogba? Beyond, like, teaching Adi how and when to shoot.  and Jack Mac, really? the guy with 11 goals in 40 apps for montreal?"
timbers,3dwn9z,Thumper13,-4,Mon Jul 20 04:28:08 2015 UTC,"Jack Mac is twice the player adi is. He gets goals playing on a team that creates one third the chances that timbers do. Can't score if you don't get the ball. Problem with adi is, he gets plenty of chances and wastes them. He's wasted more opportunities than anyone in the league. And I didn't say I want drogba, I clearly stated that. I said why can't timbers get someone of that caliber."
timbers,3dwn9z,peacefinder,6,Mon Jul 20 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"Adi and jack Mack are completely different players playing completely different roles as strikers. Adi is a primary hold up striker who's responsibility is as much to set up the wingers and CAM as it is to put the ball in the back of the net.   Jack Mack is a poacher and true attacking striker, he is not going to be posting off two CBs at the top of the box laying off to piatti.  If melano is as dangerous as a right wing as he is up top think about how hard it is going to be to defend adi posted up at the top of the box with Nagbe running up the left, DV8 in the middle and melano on the right."

timbers,3dwn9z,deville66,3,Mon Jul 20 19:27:48 2015 UTC,"I think your use of caliber is wrong; Drogba would've been someone of high caliber like 2 years ago, but now he shouldn't be seen in that high class.  Also, Montreal's got someone equally as good as Valeri in Piatti, chances aren't something they're lacking."

timbers,3dtbwn,elitron,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"I think you're writing T2 off too quick.  Newcastle did not have a very good EPL season. They only beat Sac Republic by 1-0.... and THAT was an own goal by Sac.  T2 has had a rough season as well, though. Plus they just played on Sunday.  We know there will probably be some senior squad members there though. I'm guessing Nanchoff plays. Not sure who else considering they just played on Sat."

timbers,3drjmm,diabloblanco,3,Sat Jul 18 20:58:11 2015 UTC,I'm posting it unfinished tomorrow and will just start slowly doing it in my spare time.
timbers,3drjmm,acquiesce,5,Sat Jul 18 21:04:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, /u/acquiesce, add this to the wiki:  Game Day Experience  How to get downtown:  Getting to Providence Park isn’t terribly hard.   Mass Transit: Any major bus line or MAX will take your downtown and from there you can walk West on Morrison from the Transit Mall. Bus lines 15 and 20 take you a block away while the Blue and Red lines drop off right in front of the stadium. Don’t be clever and think you can MAX it without paying your fare. This isn’t a Blazer game. There will be a check point.  Biking: While there is temporary bike parking set up in front of the stadium it is torn down rather quickly after the game so be sure to move it immediately after a game and relock at your victory spot of choice. Avoid locking up to the outside gate as I’ve heard stories of people getting citations. I usually lock up next to my bar of choice, though on a busy day it can be a walk to an available pole.  Driving: So, you decided to drive, huh? There are a ton of temporary lots that pop up around the stadium of varying prices but if you’re not in the mood to hunt and don’t mind walking a bit park at SW 10th and Yamhill. Always a spot and pretty cheap. If you’re paying with a card you don’t have to pay at the machines before you leave--those signs are lying. Just pay as you exit. The downside is it’s tough to get the post-game analysis on the radio as you slowly coast out of the building. My other favorite parking spots (other than the secret free one I won’t tell you about) is 16th and Alder and Madson and 18th.  Where to eat/drink:  You’re in downtown Portland, for crying out loud. If you can’t find good food you deserve to starve. Look for a sign that says “restaurant” and “open.”  The best time to get anywhere is EARLY. If you’re TA, that means 4+ hours before kickoff. If you’re not TA (or are old and jaded like me and get rowdy in the 200s) then that’s 2 hours before kickoff. Why? Because of the wristband system a thousand people will leave the bar and get in line two hours before kickoff. This creates a perfect little lull to sneak into an otherwise busy bar. If you plan to park and have a beer 30 minutes before kickoff, well, you’re fucked. It’s a party in the streets every Timbers match.  The Hot Lips right in front of the stadium is a great spot to grab a fast bite. The line is long but the staff is prepared so you’ll get in and out quickly. Seating might be sparse so be prepared to stand. If you get a table, don’t be a dick and hang out--bus you table and GTFO.  I’m loath to tell you my favorite spot but it’s the Goose Hollow Pub. Good food, good beer, good service. If you want something younger and more lively then head to the Cheerful Bullpen or Marathon Taverna. There’s whatever-the-old-Bitter-End-is-now, the Civic, Kingston, and Commodore are all local spots that I’ve been into on occasion but don’t frequent enough to say more than that. If you don’t mind a little walk head up NW 21st. If you like cocktails I recommend North 45, Pope House, and Muu-Muu’s. Kells, O’Brian’s, and McMenamins Blue Moon all serve as generic watering holes too.  Post-game go to any of those places but if it was a special victory and you’re up to a special time then you go to Tony’s. This is the last bastion of old Portland. Cash only, free jukebox, no bullshit. If you’re worried about a place being too divey then don’t bother but if you want your visit to Portland to be special then cap it off at Tony’s."

timbers,3dn28b,secret_aardvark,6,Fri Jul 17 23:23:47 2015 UTC,"So he's salaried at $1m, and on a $5m transfer fee for a 4-year contract.  This means the Timbers value him at $2.25m/yr. Good lord. Hope he can handle pressure."

timbers,3dn28b,yzerizef,3,Sun Jul 19 10:26:42 2015 UTC,"I wonder what is up with the recently announced player salaries and our use of targeted allocation money. Adi is apparently on $100k more than Valeri, so why would we buy down Adi?"
timbers,3dn28b,daballard,5,Fri Jul 17 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"From what I am seeing (and I really don't understand much of MLS financially, so be warned) I'm pretty sure I heard something where the teams had 100k to buy down dps, each year for 5 years.  If they didn't spend it the year they got it, they'd have to spend it the next year.  So I'm thinking that they bought down Adi because he would use up the allocation money given, so they wouldn't be forced to spend it later.  Also,  Adi now technically not being a DP might relieve some pressure, helping him find more goals.  I also think it's an odd move to buy down Adi instead of Valeri though.  (All I said above could be complete nonsense,  I'm just trying to find a possible explanation, haha)"
timbers,3dn28b,daballard,3,Fri Jul 17 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, we get $100k per year, but Valeri is on ""$550k"" and the DP charge is $436,250 this year, which we would need to buy him down to.  And besides, unspent money can be traded, so it is an asset. You can spend the money the year you get it or in the following year."
timbers,3dn28b,Proteus010,2,Fri Jul 17 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"Adi shouldn't really be a DP to begin with.  Looking towards the future, which one are you more likely to want to keep around? Adi or Valeri? With the current numbers, it might make more sense to pay down Valeri, but what happens when his contract is up and he wants more money? If he's not a full DP, you're limited in what you can give him without freeing a spot.  With Adi not being a DP, he's also (theoretically anyway) easier to trade."
timbers,3dn28b,mperham,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:17 2015 UTC,"Kind of surprising that we're paying $1m/yr for a young striker now.  If we paid ~$500k for Adi and Valeri in the past two years, that's some inflation rate..."
timbers,3dn28b,Bacontroph,5,Fri Jul 17 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"Nah, not so much inflation.  Melano has a higher ceiling, is younger than, and can play more positions than Adi.  That's worth a premium.  Melano may even have a higher ceiling than Valeri though Valeri is a better player now.  As for Valeri, he was no doubt skilled but appears to have been in a long rough patch.  His playing time for Lanus was inconsistent whereas with Portland we try to keep him on the field as much as possible.  He's had more goals in less playing time with Portland and he's on track to beat his assist numbers/minute stat too.  29 is usually around where soccer players peak meaning he could have been in line for an even larger raise but an injury like his ACL tear may have influenced that.  Valeri also strikes me as a very loyal player meaning he's less likely to demand a pay raise or to be sent to another club that will give him more money.  Valeri performance data"
timbers,3dn28b,stedfunk,2,Fri Jul 17 21:35:14 2015 UTC,Lucas Melano comes with more hype than Adi or Valeri. 2 Mexican teams and 2 La Liga teams put in bids on Melano as well which drives his price up

Timbers have scored the least amount of goals out of all the playoff teams, though recent form has helped improve that number. With a big signing like this, I would think the Timbers would want a proven goal scorer (easier said than done). Melano may just be that guy but he hasn't been exactly a big goal scorer in his young career. The potential is definitely there but will he produce this season or will it take him longer?"

I hardly know anything about how an MLS FO is run and I understand and respect that it's a business and therefore revenue driven. However I have heard horror stories of supporters butting heads with their FO concerning what type of expressions and events of support are permitted, even to the detriment of the revenue (which I assume works in their mind as a way to make more somehow- businessmen be crazy aka Donald Trump).  All this to say that I feel in many ways we are fortunate to have an FO that has a relatively decent ongoing relationship with its supporters and allows us to do pretty much what we want as far as expressions of support are concerned."

We've had those here as well:  a loooong time ago.  And we've worked through them.  The 107ist logo is a triangle because it represents TEAM/TOWN/TIMBERS ARMY.

timbers,3dmc2y,shawnlevy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:05:08 2015 UTC,"So if I'm following, you're saying that the success (measured in size, in-stadium privileges, public perception, etc.) of the TA was abetted, over the years, by a good relationship with the FO?  Because that's certainly true.  But if by ""the current state of the TA"" you mean something less than positive, I'm not sure what that could be.  Speaking only for me, on the basis of more than a decade dealing with the FO, the current management is absolutely a partner to the TA and is often willing to take cues from the TA in a number of areas.  Not in every single thing, of course, nor at every single moment.  But in the long run, and in fostering a model of American supportership:  without a doubt, 100% yes.    This has nothing to do, of course, with their ability to field a competitive MLS (or even USL) team.  But they have been exemplary partners in a league in which such are in short supply.

timbers,3dmc2y,timberrich,3,Fri Jul 17 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"I think it is all of those to an extent.  I think that if Paulson went to the league tomorrow and said he is ready to drop 30 million on 3 brand new DP's , the only issue they would have is that it would decrease the value of the other DP's in the league.  And since we are still one of the new kids, we have to play nice with the league until we are to the point where we can act as a pushy organization, like some of the older and more formed organizations.  While some of the orginial teams of MLS may not be the highest performing, I think they have more say behind closed doors then organizations like Portland, Vancouver, Montreal, even Seattle."
timbers,3dmc2y,deepteeth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:57 2015 UTC,Why do you think that is? Making sure the Cup gets passed around to as many paying teams/cities as possible?
timbers,3dmc2y,timberrich,2,Fri Jul 17 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"If I am following your direction, I think it has to do with the fact that the original owners still involved in the league (DC, New England, KC,etc.) feel obligated to get special treatment because their money helped lay ground work for the league and allowed teams to enter and then make money.  I imagine Paulson and other new owners are not viewed as equals in these types of talks.  Hence preferential treatment over the years for not having SSS or spending a lot of money.  I think the recent Union agreement with the league shows a bit of this, especially with the league's new allocation fund rules.  The idea of ""use it or lose it"" funds is something that teams like DC, New England, Chicago aren't used to and it is almost forcing them to better their rosters to keep up with the pace of the rest of the league."
timbers,3dmc2y,joechoj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"This sounds like your personal speculation, without much basis, if I may say so. There are other ways to interpret the issues you point to as support.  It seems to me that allowing teams to stay in older stadiums is just dealing with the reality of the situation. What else is the league going to do, kick them out? It doesn't seem preferential at all. They met the conditions at the time of their entry, just like everyone else.  And the league will always be happy to help teams spend money; it raises the profile of the league."

It could be; I don't know MLS politics well enough to know what they prioritize, but the league and its fans seem to generally adore our stadium and atmosphere.   What most holds us back from getting those players, realistically, is that your Steven Gerrards and Andrea Pirlos don't know about/care about going to a city like Portland when they can go get a bunch of sun in LA or have all the benefits that New York provides.

Fact of the matter is, if some TA members were such great managers of sports franchise, they would work in the industry themselves. But instead, they're a bunch of techbros, like myself.

This does seem to leave either Wallace/Asprilla a little position-less. It's also going to put a lot of pressure on Urutti. It'll be interesting to see how this all turns out."

timbers,3dkh8y,Bacontroph,5,Fri Jul 17 00:32:41 2015 UTC,I wonder if melano could play second striker in a two striker formation.. maybe a diomand with Valeri behind them?
timbers,3dkh8y,glorkvorn,4,Fri Jul 17 01:02:40 2015 UTC,"Probably, but I don't know how much experience he has a second striker.  Lanus primarily deploys with a 4-3-3 formation, similar to the Timbers but without a Valeri type character.  Anytime we've played in a 4-4-2 with two strikers we've looked like shit."
timbers,3dkh8y,Bacontroph,3,Fri Jul 17 01:11:51 2015 UTC,I agree it hasnt worked well for us.  But I think a big part of that is that Adi and Urruti both dont know how to play the second striker role.
timbers,3dkh8y,glorkvorn,2,Fri Jul 17 01:16:30 2015 UTC,The Maxi/Gata combination usually winds up as more of a 4-4-2 than a 4-3-3 when Gaston is playing centrally.  It's less the 4-4-2 that's an issue for us and more than Adi and Urruti have 0 synergy or chemistry.
timbers,3dkh8y,Suedars,2,Fri Jul 17 14:12:21 2015 UTC,I thought Nagbe likes the right side? am I wrong?

I'm just saying its not very black and white. We don't know what this coach promised Powell and if he delivered or not. Or maybe the coach has expressed no desire at all to play Powell. Or maybe Powell's being childish. Or maybe he feels he's the best right back the team has by a large margin and the coach still refuses to play him.

Specifically, does Powell has a financial incentive to skip the Gold Cup and play in Portland where he's guaranteed appearances?  On the one hand, I think the description of Powell's actions make him sound quite immature and unjustified. That said, he is only 20 years old. He's going to do immature things. That doesn't mean Powell gets a pass for his actions--however, I do think it means that the head coach's blunt refusal to take Powell back in the case of a hypothetical repentance is unwarranted."

While I don't think Porter would want it to go down like that, if he had been making comments about his lack of playing time nationally, those sentiments might how empowered him to make such a move.

I want to know if a dude is rumored to be fast and if he's clever on the ball or likely to take on defenders.  Gaston has 4* foot skills in FIFA so he can do clever little skill checks which he has been showing more of this season with his nutmegs etc.  That was about all I expected from him.  Not many MLS players in FIFA have great footskills so it's a nice addition to see that on a player, but it doesn't mean a whole lot.  Second though is that he is rumored to have pace.  I think Castillo shares the same pace rating so it would be nice to have a pacey winger down the right.  But all in all... it's an arbitrary number to get the mildest insight as to who this player is and what he may do.  Mostly from this I gather, Argentine with pace...

timbers,3df1zz,threelions4ever,7,Wed Jul 15 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"I assume your father is Tony Betts.  Building from that assumption, and sympathetic to your frustration/mild-anger, let me offer a couple of moderating thoughts: 1) Your father's relationship with soccer has given him a nice life of which he and his family members are proud.  2) His association with the Timbers and Portland had an everlasting effect on your family (in a good way, I presume) through both his various soccer-related careers and where he chose to raise his family.  3) He feels very strongly about the 1975 team, having said this year that ""It was the highlight of all our careers I think.""    The picture I'm trying to draw is that his 3 seasons with the Timbers gave him some of the most important things in his life ... the hometown he chose to settle in and raise his family, the career he pursued for the rest of his life, and the fond memories of one great season (I'm sympathetic because I have one of those seasons, too, and it was in 1974) that was magical.  As an organization, the Timbers are pretty good at honoring their past, and I think you (on behalf of your father) do have a legitimate gripe that they could do better by him.  That said, you can focus on that, or you can focus on those things that his coming to Portland meant for him in a positive way.  When looked at in the latter light, a small ""snub"" may be more swallowable.    Please let your father know that many of us remember the legends of Timbers past."
timbers,3df1zz,joshing_slocum,6,Wed Jul 15 22:04:41 2015 UTC,"It would be nice to have a 3rd frame of reference here, since AVFC and PTFC are very different clubs, as you say. For fellow readers, AVFC's stadium holds over 40,000, and they are in talks to sell one of their players for over BP 32 million. I don't know how other clubs treat former players, but it does not surprise me that AVFC treats them better.  From a different viewpoint: corporations will frequently keep friendly ties with ex-employees, especially if the ex-employee was higher ranking. This might include letting them into events, etc. But even if the ex-employee was very high ranking, you wouldn't find too many places that allow or invite them back after they have been gone for 40 some years.  I wish that PTFC would make every ex-player feel as welcomed as AVFC, but it doesn't really surprise me that they don't. I don't blame you for feeling jipped, though. I certainly would.

timbers,3df1zz,KotheTruculent,2,Wed Jul 15 20:06:56 2015 UTC,"PC, pedantic, intervention.

Pretty much nobody knows this or uses it in a way that anyone is likely to be offended by. I don't even know if Romani are offended by ""Gypsy"" and you aren't likely to encounter many. My hometown had quite a few but I don't know of any in Portland. It is kind of like saying ""kike,"" ""mong,"" or ""shylock."" Most people don't know the origins or intend to be offensive.

The limited number of substitutions, and no re-entry, makes the rosters too static within a game to get a meaningful measurement of these sorts of things.  In essence, the sample size of games with Borchers and without Borchers are too small to draw any meaningful conclusions about results there."
timbers,3d69d4,aperfectring,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, most hockey fans, analysts and statisticians take +/- with a huge grain of salt -- it's actually a pretty bogus stat."
timbers,3d69d4,lantzlayton,3,Mon Jul 13 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Paparatto is better than Borchers. Ridgewell and Borchers are both experienced leaders. I think they each feel comfortable directing Paparatto, but they don't want to direct each other.  Anyway, it's just something I've been thinking about lately, and I wanted to see if the numbers show anything.   Thanks for the discussion!"

timbers,3d69d4,croc_lobster,2,Tue Jul 14 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"I think this is more a Borchers problem than anything else. The sample size for Borchers/Paparatto is pretty small. To me, he's looked vulnerable for much of the season, prone to missing tackles and getting beaten by pace. He's still pretty wily, but I'm not so sure that was a great pickup for us at the salary we got him at."
timbers,3d69d4,mankindrc,2,Tue Jul 14 00:06:17 2015 UTC,"All this is really telling me is that Norberto has stepped up this year and is a reliable depth CB.  I always lumped him in with O'rourke, Makenzie and Futty but he genuinely seems to be worth keeping around."

timbers,3d69d4,Be_confident_stupid,6,Mon Jul 13 21:58:52 2015 UTC,"Hard to say with certainty. In 2014, he was an error-prone, own-goal-machine. He's stepped up his game in a big way in 2015, but 4 games is a small sample size, so I'm happy we have him and am totally willing to embrace him if he keeps playing the way he has recently"
timbers,3d69d4,RomaCafe,2,Mon Jul 13 22:32:16 2015 UTC,Oh how quickly you forget. Is he playing better this year in limited action? Yes. Does that mean he's worthy of being a starter? No thanks.
timbers,3d69d4,Animasta,2,Mon Jul 13 22:51:21 2015 UTC,He played poorly last year but that was with Kah/McKenzie. When Ridgewell came in whenever he did play he performed noticably better
timbers,3d69d4,RomaCafe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"I understand Kah / McKenzie are not preferable to anyone, but McKenzie was not even starting until the wheels literally fell off the wagon last year.   At that point it was Porter giving every and anyone the opportunity to shine. Paparatto and McKenzie played on the same field together 3 times all season.   After starting 4 of the first 5 games in 2014 for the Timbers, Paparatto played in 2 out of the next 17 games and was subbed off in the 60th and 78th minutes. Paparatto played poorly long before McKenzie saw action on for the Timbers.  He's obviously got some talent but for whatever reason hasn't been able to translate into game action. His struggles last year had nothing to do with McKenzie but more likely to adjusting to a new city / team."

You can still get decent seats without wristbands, but it can be hard to get more than 2 seats together in 106-107-108 after a while.

Japanese Gardens are uphill from the stadium. There's a bus that loops up there, the International Rose Test Gardens, Hoyt Arboretum, and the zoo.   The Lan Su Classical Chinese Garden is in Oldtown/Chinatown - also within walking distance of the stadium.   Eat at a food cart - or as many of them as you can. They are found in pods clustered around town or sometimes just on their own. http://www.foodcartsportland.com/ That site is probably not comprehensive and it is hard to go wrong. If it looks good - it's probably good. If it looks weird - it's probably good.  If you like alcohol, try to map out a beer/brewery, wine, and or/distillery tour. There are several brewpubs near the stadium, many of the distilleries are clustered in the inner east side and even offer a Distillery Row passport to assist in tastings, and there are urban wineries if you don't have a car to get out to McMinnville or Forest Grove. There's probably some kind of beer festival going on while you're here. There seems to be at least one a month.   Waterfalls - There are many within 45 minutes to an hour outside of town. Silver Falls and Multnomah Falls being the most well-known.   Rent a bike to ride around. There are lanes and trails everywhere. Probably a peddle tour too.   Hike. There are many hikes in and around town. If you swing by Powell's they'll have a guide for hiking in and around the city. The 4T (for 4 types of transportation) could start at the stadium. Take the MAX light rail to the Washington Park/Zoo stop. Follow the signs to hike along the west hills to OHSU, take the aerial tram down to the south waterfront, then catch a streetcar back into downtown. Forest Park and Hoyt Arboretum can be decent hikes too. Pittock Mansion in the west hills has good views of the city.  You might check out the Portland Saturday Market - more or less under the Burnside Bridge by the river. Despite the name, it is also happening on Sunday. It has good food, local artists and craftspeople, buskers, and people watching.  There are great comic book and record shops here. For comics, Floating World is close to downtown. Things From Another World is the storefront for Dark Horse Comics. Both have a variety of other geeky things. Billy Galaxy is close to Powell's and the stadium, as well as some other geeky things, if you like nerdy toys. Music Millennium is the major record shop, but Jackpot, Everyday Music, Vinyl Resting Place, and Beacon Sound spring to mind.  Strip clubs. We, allegedly, have more per capita than any other US city. Acropolis is known for their cheap and delicious steaks, if not much else. Mary's Club is known for being old....However, it is right next to the delicious Santeria, Bailey's Taproom, and Tug Boat Brewing. I've heard good things about Kit Kat Club, Lucky Devil, and Devil's Point. Casa Diablo is a vegan strip club, for whatever that's worth.  If you don't want to go that risque, there's probably a burlesque show happening while you're here. http://www.burlesquepdx.com/ The Lovecraft Bar has something at least once a week.   I'll update if I think of anything else. Hopefully other's will add some suggestions.   Enjoy your stay!"

We sit here day in and day out talking about how the West cannibalizes itself, and then these weeks where absolute shit Eastern teams embarrass the top of the West (LAG, SEA, VAN all in the same boat).  If we accept that the West is a constant dog-fight, then trips East should be free points.  We're leaving a lot of ""free points"" on the table this year."

timbers,3czk3m,Rhormus,7,Sun Jul 12 05:18:23 2015 UTC,I ain't even mad.   I think it was worth a gambling playing a B team when you're playing an Eastern team on the road mid season.  Remember our team is a little banged up and possibly tired from the Wednesday and Saturday games for almost a month.  It was a perfect time to rest the troops and get ready for the second half of the season.
timbers,3czk3m,cookiemikester,2,Sun Jul 12 05:37:19 2015 UTC,"Same here, the first half I was a little leery about what was going to happen but they started to perform better as they got closer to the half, especially peay Fernandez also put in some good effort, but it did take me till the half to realize who all was playing just because it was so low pressure, and I'm ok with that."
timbers,3cyjil,apocelipses,3,Sat Jul 11 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, it'd be great to see our usual studs in the lineup, but Porter is playing his healthy dudes. No sense running Chara or Nagbe out there and exacerbating an injury. Let those dudes rest up, we'll need them for the coming 3 games. Villafaña has played all but 19 minutes across all competitions (last I checked). Good to get him a game off.  Manning is a draft pick from this year. Good reports on Stumptown Footy about him in training.  Porter has also mentioned his willingness to take chances vs. the Eastern conference, as a loss doesn't give points to the teams with which we're competing for playoff spots."

That means that if he were to be signed as a young DP, his cap hit is $150,000 the first year, $200,000 the second year, and the Timbers have a season and a half to evaluate him with the small cap hit.  Edit: corrected cap hit numbers."

timbers,3cgfj2,joshing_slocum,4,Tue Jul 7 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"In summary, he says (in order of game timeline):   Should have been PK for SJ on Powell's goal-line handball. Should have been PK for PTFC on Jean-Baptiste Pierazzi handball. Should have been a red card on Jordan Stewart for elbow on Powell Asprilla. Should have been a red card on Mark Sherrod for elbow on Papa. Should have been PK for SJ on Ridgy's takedown of Tommy Thompson. Fernandez flopped on foul called that led to free kick that led to Jack's goal.   He also said/showed that both Timbers ""goals"" that were called back for offside were indeed correct calls.  That is a hell of a lot of bad calls (incidentally, I have consistently maintained that the infamous game at Starfire was actually a well-called game and I challenge anyone to find anything near this many major bad calls from that game).  As for this list, I think #s 1, 3, and 6 are definitely correct (though 6 was probably difficult for the ref to see ... though not the DisCo).  Probably 4 as well.  #2 would have been a weak PK, but according to the letter of the law, I think a PK is correct (Valeri might have had a tackle there if Pierazzi hadn't handballed since ball would have taken longer to get back to his feet, so it could have benefited SJ). Replays on #3 showed Thompson went down very easily, but if it had been called a PK, I'd have a hard time arguing.  All-in-all, a horribly reffed game, and one where Salazar got screwed by his AR in the East side."
timbers,3cgfj2,itsthewoo,3,Tue Jul 7 19:09:34 2015 UTC,"Not a clear penalty call (I have not seen an angle with a 100% handball), but Powell definitely should not have had his arm out. We got really lucky. More or less 50/50 in my opinion. It was a hasty clearance. Nowhere as close to a penalty as Powell's incident. I thought Stewart elbowed Asprilla? Either way, it was blatant, and right in front of the AR. At least a yellow, but probably a red in my opinion. Not sure if that's a red. Definitely leads with the elbow, but not sure I'd put it on the same level as Stewart's elbow. I'd say yellow was warranted. No penalty in my opinion, though I would understand (and probably be salty) if a ref called it. Thompson went down with very minimal contact. Definitely flopped. But it was also technically a foul. The defender very clearly puts his arm in front of Fernandez, and Fernandez takes advantage by going down after contact (though minimal). Two things distinguish this from Thompson's fall in the box: (1) It's not as big of a call as a penalty as set pieces are far less likely to convert into goals; and (2) it was not incidental contact as the defender intentionally sticks his arm out in front of Fernandez.**   ** I do not condone flopping. Flopping creates two sets of uncertainties, i.e. that the ref will make the call, and that your team can also convert the set piece. Not flopping removes the uncertainty of whether the ref makes the call."

timbers,3cgfj2,peacefinder,4,Tue Jul 7 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"It would have been nice if he took half as many calls and went in-depth with them.  For example, why the Valeri and Fernandez calls were ""controversial"". I was at the game, and both offside calls were correct, but the flags are super late or super brief.   On Valeri's, you see him pick up his head to look at the assistant - I think the entire TA also looked at him, saw the flag down, and get excited as Valeri finished it off.  There's no explanation for why the call was so late, but I think everyone expected the offside call, so no one set off the smoke or rising sun flags.   Fernandez's goal - I don't recall seeing the flag up either, and I remember seeing Porter mouthing ""what's the call?"" on the sideline a minute after play resumed. This one I don't think anyone in the TA saw the flag either, and the smoke went off.  It was really bizarre.  I don't know why this call was so hard to figure out at the time.  I feel like part of the performance of reffing the game should be communicating important calls clearly to everyone.  This crew made good offside calls but no one could figure it out at the time and the perception was incompetence.   The elbows though... some of those were pretty fucking blatant yellows and borderline reds."
timbers,3cgfj2,xenoguy1313,4,Tue Jul 7 20:07:23 2015 UTC,"There's no explanation for why the call was so late   A theory I read, that seems reasonable, is that the AR could not tell from his angle which team had headed on the ball. (If a Timbers header, it's offside. If a SJ header, Valeri is onside.)  If the flag goes up before he's sure, it potentially spoils the flow of the game if it turns out to have been onside. If the flag stays down until he gets clarification over the headset radio, the game is not interrupted until it has to be.   It's a bummer the call was late, but at least it was right."
timbers,3cgfj2,mrgstiffler,3,Wed Jul 8 03:23:22 2015 UTC,"The elbow on Asprilla was nearly identical to the Espindola red card this weekend. Sherrod's elbow, though possibly not a red, struck me as persistent infringement. That was definitely not the only dangerous play he made."

timbers,3cfcst,passthekwarasey,9,Tue Jul 7 16:17:55 2015 UTC,Pirlo would have been amazing. I don't care if him and Valeri have a very similar skill set... the guys free kicks are magic.  I'm excited to see him in MLS though.
timbers,3cfcst,Brawrsen,3,Tue Jul 7 14:36:18 2015 UTC,He would have allowed Valeri to roam a lot more. I feel Valeri is at his best when he isn't stuck to the middle. Pirlo could've posted up in the middle and dictated the pace of the game. Sucks he got snapped up.

timbers,3cfcst,Rainandsnow5,5,Thu Jul 9 12:38:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like Ridgewell is probably the level of DP we can reasonably expect, rather than the Pirlos, Gerrards, Lampards, Kakas of the world. A solid, known commodity in a top tier league that doesn't have the name recognition of a lot of stars coming to the league, but also probably doesn't have the advanced age either.   Honestly, MLS doesn't worry about Portland. The games are soldout basically forever, and always will be. The fanbase is there, and in many ways limited. So they won't really go out of their way to ensure high profile transfers land there either, at least as long as New York, Seattle, LA, and other larger markets are available.  So my prediction: someone nobody here has heard of."

timbers,3cfcst,tinyj316,2,Wed Jul 8 15:26:31 2015 UTC,I agree. But I don't think we'd need to bring in another high priced player at this point to play that position.
timbers,3cfcst,IronHayd3n,2,Wed Jul 8 22:00:03 2015 UTC,"I think the shelf life on CB is a bit longer than that of a forward, or an attacking mid, for that matter. Ridgewell still has more than a few years left in him, and I think Borchers is good for a couple more seasons, at least. It's rare enough to see teams drop DP money on CB, and I'd be surprised (and a little bit upset) if the Timbers pulled that move two seasons in a row."

For MLS games we don't tolerate traveling fans in the Timbers Army section, but for friendlies I've never seen any trouble of any sort.   The North End will offer the best views and atmosphere, I would recommend that personally, but I cant speak for all nor for official stadium policy.   Hope you enjoy the game in any case!"
timbers,3cdp9i,IRraymaker,2,Tue Jul 7 03:37:06 2015 UTC,"Preseason they would let a timbers fan wear a Fire lot in the north end. It was a Palmer kit. So even if it is a friendly, they may not allow opposing colors in the north end. We were all fine with it, but security was being ridiculous."

On match day, you'll be likelier to be given strop by someone in a Sunderland or Boro kit than a Timbers fan.  So sit anywhere.  223 is the corner, yeah, but it's an intimate enough ground that you'll feel close to the pitch.  You WON'T be close to the fun, though.  Get as near to the Timbers Army as you can, and bring the proper spirit for a full day of good-spirited banter interrupted by 90 minutes of (injury-free, god willing) footy.  You'll love it."

timbers,3chiy0,questionablycntrvers,11,Wed Jul 8 00:27:31 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion, but this is one of the few times I've ever been ok with a dive. If I recall correctly, Fernandez nutmegged a guy and was going toward goal, and the defender stuck his arm out to obstruct his passage. Even though he barely touched Fernandez, and Fernandez went down. But the fact remains that the arm was still out there.    If Fernandez had just battled through the arm, he would've been slightly slowed down, would've lost the ball, and the foul wouldn't have been called. So he had the option to lose the ball, or seize the opportunity to create a chance. I know it sounds like I'm describing all instances of diving, but the key here is that, in my opinion, Fernandez was actually fouled. Was it really so unjust of him to sell it on a foul he earned via nutmeg?"

This was clearly a foul, but in the MLS if you don't go down it isn't called."

timbers,3cbg4t,bhilde10,7,Mon Jul 6 17:32:28 2015 UTC,First things first. This is the MLS. We could improve in any area. If Porter and Wilkinson can find the right fit we should sign them. As long as the price is right that is. A smart young dp signing might be worth it or a 28-30 year old player who fits the bill.   What we don't want to do is sign a big money player who's getting a huge paycheck and is a gamble.

We sign him to a five contract with more money involved we can at least sell him at a higher price in a couple years than him becoming a free agent. If he decides to finish his contract then awesome but he'd be with us longer.
timbers,3cbg4t,thebarroomhero,3,Mon Jul 6 19:18:40 2015 UTC,Just because you're paying someone a higher salary doesn't mean you'll get a higher transfer fee
timbers,3cbg4t,cynicalvanilla,3,Mon Jul 6 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"THe point was to have him for longer period at a higher salary, so if someone wanted to buy him before he became a free agent again, we would be able to set the price more freely. Once he's a free agent, we get nothing."

Previously it's been shaky at the back, but this season it's been locked down apart from the Galaxy game. Ridgewell, Borchers, Villafana, and Powell have been great this year. Our offense finally seems to have everyone in the right place, with Adi today doing some great holdup play in after grabbing some great goals in the last few weeks, Fernandez still being effective, not to mention Nagbe still being great. Then Jack saving the day again, Johnson back and looking sharp, and Valeri looking better and better.

Do you mean you hope to make a memorial type tifo at the Civic Stadium property, honoring the stadium, kind of like the off season tifo at PP wishing Will Johnson a speedy recovery last year?  I just ask because Civic Stadium burned down last week, and you didn't specifically mention that.

Two, we want to generate some buzz for the team.

I wish we could do two up front, 4-4-2 diamond with la gata and Urruti on top with Valeri playing the ten."

We weren't playing good possession and were lumping the ball up most of the time which mean't that he was on an island most of the time, which is the same problem that Boyd had when he was here. In addition we don't even have a good winger that can get in early crosses.  He couldn't even play an effective big man hold the ball up  distributor because he didn't have an in form off striker to work with to pass the ball off to.   If I remember it the majority of service that he got were shitty through balls."

timbers,3byrt1,Bacontroph,3,Fri Jul 3 17:19:15 2015 UTC,"Another complaint I saw was that we spent too much on Adi.  Here is another table with salaries of each player and how much each goal has cost their respective teams.  This doesn't include transfer fees since that requires knowledge of Garbermagic to grok.    Player Salary Goals Salary/G    Kamara 210,000(2012)1 12 17,500.00   Wondo 650,000.00 9 72,222.22   Adi 593,300.00 8 74,162.50   Giovinco 7,000,000(est.)2 8 875,000.00   Kaka 7,167,500 8 895,937.50   Dempsey 6,695,188.75 7 956,455.54   Martins 1,753,333.33 7 250,476.19   Rivero 50,004.00 7 7,143.43   Nemeth 475,000(est.)3 7 67,857.14   Bruin 172,500.00 7 24,642.86   Davies 78,940.63 7 11,277.23    Conclusion - We are getting good value from Adi with most things considered.  Rivero and Davies need raises.  Kamara has been huge for Columbus.  Kaka and Gio may be getting paid a lot but they're also having big positive impacts on their respective teams in other areas.  Dempsey also has 5 assists but I don't think Seattle is extracting good value from him and Martins.  1 - Kamara played a season at Middlesbrough and later returned.  His current salary hasn't been released yet.  2 - 7 mil base with some marketing rights fuckery so I went with the base though he's estimated to make as much as 8 mil per year.  3 - Salary hasn't been released yet so this number is estimated from his stint at Roda JC."
timbers,3byrt1,realworldeditor,2,Fri Jul 3 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"Less minutes, less starts. If his usage was closer to the top 3, who's to say he wouldn't have that many more goals.  I'd say Adi is a scorer."
timbers,3byrt1,Proteus010,-2,Fri Jul 3 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"Who's to say Urruti doesn't have more than him if he played more minutes? You're speculating, and can't only look at the number of goals.  This is the same argument we all had with Nagbe last year. Goals is not the be all end all stat..."
timbers,3byrt1,realworldeditor,3,Sat Jul 4 03:47:01 2015 UTC,"It's not, but to say that he's not a scorer when he hasn't had the minutes or starts that the guys ahead of him have is pure speculation as well."
timbers,3byrt1,Proteus010,0,Sat Jul 4 06:30:25 2015 UTC,"I agree it's speculation. The problem is, he doesn't have the other skills to contribute when he isn't scoring. Which is really the main point"
timbers,3byrt1,IRraymaker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:47:51 2015 UTC,"Your analysis seems to be at odds with the analysis in this link, which suggests Wondo, Giovinco and co have scored more meaningful goals in terms of distribution across matches, and points earned. Basically the thesis is that his second goal usually doesn't impact the points earned, and in one case his brace did nothing (4-2 less to SSFC)  http://bit.ly/1H4vslM"
timbers,3byrt1,Nightbynight,2,Fri Jul 3 18:37:12 2015 UTC,"I get it, but without that second goal the game could have been different. Tough to predict how important a second goal is since it's mostly speculation."
timbers,3byrt1,Suedars,3,Sat Jul 4 04:08:41 2015 UTC,"It's fine that he's scoring. I'm happy he is. But other than the Seattle game, most games he plays in, he offers almost nothing other than the occasional goal scoring. Nothing. In fact, I would say, often, he negatively impacts our offense by his poor passing, poor hold up play, poor dribbling, and weak overall technical ability. Also, he has a weak core. He gets pushed over WAY too easily.  The one big caveat is that I thought he was pretty good against Seattle in all those area. If he plays like that, every game, I think he'd be one of the best forwards in the league.  The problem is though, he doesn't. Most games we see the poor passing, the poor hold up play, the poor dribbling, and no goals. We've gotten goals in 5 of the 18 games he's played. So 5 out of 18 games he's played in he's offered something at least partially positive. 13 out of 18 games he's offered little. You can't have a striker that only gives goals unless he's leading the league. You have to have a forward who is at least competent and some other area. Adi doesn't really show he is competent and other things that often.   Other forwards like Wondo for example, offer other things. Wondo gets criticized for being a poacher but he's really a pretty good player at other things. Good passer, he's strong, and can hold the ball up. All things Adi has been weak at most of the season.  BUT, he is young. He can improve. He keeps playing like he did against Seattle than I'm all for him starting. I think the most important thing is him and Urruti competing."
timbers,3byrt1,thersoiv,2,Fri Jul 3 09:11:33 2015 UTC,"I should have pointed out that this was strictly related to his goal scoring exclusively (mostly to the amount of matches he scores in) and was just a follow up to a comment/table from earlier.  I'd say that most fans know he has hist faults and isn't our ideal striker.  You ring up some great points, but you also fail to mention tha tmost of the matches he started were without DV and WJ, which seems to help him out a lot.  Thanks for the in-depth reply with reasons behind your opinion!"
timbers,3byrt1,raptor_rapture,4,Sat Jul 4 01:17:08 2015 UTC,"This is really my biggest issue with him. This year he's basically just been a pure poacher because he hasn't been making non-scoring contributions, and his strike rate hasn't been good enough to justify playing him as a pure poacher.  That sad, last year his hold up play was much better (and it was vs. Seattle too), and he was also much better at physically grappling with centerbacks and standing up to challenges (and Adi wearing CBs out almost certainly contributed to a lot of Urruti's success as a sub), so maybe he improves on that front as the year goes on."
timbers,3byrt1,elitron,2,Fri Jul 3 13:52:35 2015 UTC,He also played most of those games at the beginning of the season when everyone looked pretty poor and he in front on an island.   I'm not saying he looked good but a lot of his minutes came when the rest of the team had little invention.

He did a good job converting those two chances and really did a bang up job going toe to toe with Chad Marshall. However, his goal tally is based on players like Nagbe feeding him brilliant balls in the right spots. The shots he's taken generally aren't brilliant strikes, they're finishing well weighted passes (which, great, we need and love goals but they're products of brilliant assists and not entirely his own effort). He still goes down really easy for someone of his size, has been improving on being offside, and generally hasn't sprung the midfield entirely all too well.   If we're talking about overall player performance, Nagbe would have been a better choice for his overall contribution to that match. Our midfield in the match completing dicing the Flounders defense was what pushed us to such a walloping and I'm not sure the right player is getting that recognition in this respect."

timbers,3bn2z0,ButtRubbinz,5,Tue Jun 30 21:12:30 2015 UTC,I thought the true work of art was Fernandez's absurd pass rate and making the defense look like they were playing in high school again. He was filthy.

timbers,3bn2z0,duganda,2,Wed Jul 1 02:29:43 2015 UTC,"So the first shot was a one-touch with a pretty high degree of technical difficulty IMO.

timbers,3bn2z0,duganda,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:47:53 2015 UTC,"I actually think his strength upon arrival was his technical ability.  He's had to learn how to play as a target forward, and his touch has been epically bad sometimes, but I do think his ceiling when it comes to technical abilities is pretty high.  The problem is that it does not appear to include quickness, which means he's not a very good dribbler because he can't create space.  But he does have a good shot."

I do highly doubt you would enjoy beating a 100% Seattle with Dempsey/Martins/Ozzie/etc. exactly the same as you enjoy beating their B-/C team playing subs and scrubs who'd stepped on an MLS pitch maybe 1 or 2 times in their lives.  You say ""a win is a win,"" but surely you'd enjoy ""a win"" in the MLS Cup final more than you'd enjoy ""a win"" in a pre-season friendly. It's only natural to assign sentimental value to games and wins based on the circumstances, and to want to prove to the world that your team is better always, not just when the other team is missing half their squad and all of their superstars (kinda goes to your original point at the start of the thread.)"

Second goal he overlaps around Adi and causes the CB to delay pressing Adi, which also caught Frei flatfooted as he was expecting Adi to pass to Fernandez.  Really truly beautiful football."

A big part of it falls into the 'don't be a dick' arena. While tifo adds a ton to the army experience it also is super shitty to stand behind someone who does not ever put down the flag. The 'no pitty' flag is about 15x15 and it's used perfectly. I believe it's 107 supplied but has a 'keeper' during the game to make sure it does not walk off (I might be wrong).  If you make something awesome and waive it before the game, during half time or during a goal celebration you are good to go."

timbers,3bjj8r,LIV3N,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"The vast majority were purchased from the tifo fund, funded by supporting the No Pity van and 107IST membership dues. I think the checkered flags came from the Space Needle display while Portland flags came from a derby game against the Whitecaps.   The tifo crew comes in to each game early and distributes the flags across the North end and stays late to collect them. They sleep up above 205.   Every couple of years, usually when someone can't take it any more, a group comes together and cleans and mends them.  Many people bring in their own flags that are special to them for whatever reason."

If you have TA tickets you could actually sleep on the ground the night before before the game and get a wristband so you can be in the front section of the army.  That time of July it's going to be beautiful out. Spend the $100 that you'd spend on a hotel room on a blow up air mat and some cheep some sleeping bags from target (right down the road). Spend the night drinking and having a grand old time. In the morning they hand out the wristbands. Plan to donate your sleeping stuff to a local homeless person or just tell someone who's in line with you what your plan is, someone will point you in the right direction. You will be totally safe sleeping on the sidewalk and it will be an adventure you will never forget.  Once you have your wrist band go wander downtown. They let the people with the bands in 30 min before anyone else. Again just say ""I""m from out of town and want the TA expierece"" we will take care of you.  Also, fuck Seattle"

All of the best breweries are outside downtown, and there's a huge concentration of them in inner SE Portland that are walkable.  Green Dragon, Cascade Barrel Room (a must if you like sour beers), Commons, and Lucky Lab are all within 10 blocks of each other.  A bit further out is Baerlic Brewing, Base Camp Brewing, Burnside Brewing and Hair of the Dog Brewing (which I highly recommend).

July is Oregon Craft Beer Month, so I'm sure there will be some events going on around town.  There's actually a brewfest on Saturday, but it's out in Hillsboro and not really accessible from public transportation, so you'd have to Uber it out there.  What's your budget for food?  You planning on hitting up various restaurants if you can?  Downtown has some great places to eat like Tasty 'n' Alder (brunch spot, very busy, get there early and expect to wait), Gruner, Clyde Commons, and Higgins.

timbers,3bftxr,SegwayCop,7,Sun Jun 28 21:32:30 2015 UTC,HOUSTON.  That game made me really happy. I was willing them to win and staring at them really hard and yelling HOUSTON YOU HAVE  A PROBLEM and man it was awesome. I have been at two other matches and they lost so this one was ... yes. Magical. I used to play rugby and have been trying to understand all the nuances of soccer (I even studied to be a rugby ref)... they sure give you a lot of time to strategize heh

timbers,3bgo50,nefariouslothario,8,Mon Jun 29 01:43:06 2015 UTC,"Diego Valeri is by far the best player on the team. He's one of the best midfielders in the league.   Nagbe is terrific, but his worth doesn't show in his stats. He's brilliant with the ball, and our distribution wouldn't be the same without him.  Seattle is our biggest rival. Portland is a medium sized market about 4 hours south of Seattle. Seattle is a major market. That being said, Seattle gets more attention from the league (read: Seattle gets Dempsey. Toronto gets Altidore. Portland doesn't get big name DPs). In my opinion, Seattle plays with money, Portland plays with heart.  Portland finished first in the West in 2013, and missed the playoffs last season by a single point. This season, Portland started off slow, but we've climbed our way into third in the West. I'd be authorized surprised if the Timbers don't make the playoffs this season. I'd say the Timbers are better than average, but we have room to grow.  Chants to know: Green and Gold."
timbers,3bgo50,apocelipses,4,Mon Jun 29 02:13:53 2015 UTC,Thanks. How do you make the playoffs? Top 4 teams from each conference?   Also whats the general consensus on Will Johnson. Thought he looked pretty good tonight
timbers,3bgo50,apocelipses,5,Mon Jun 29 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"Last season, the top 5 teams made the playoffs, this season, the 6 teams will make it.  Will Johnson is recovering from a broken leg suffered last season, and the team is clearly better with him on the pitch. Last season, however, he was a mixed bag.   A year ago, he was a bit of a hot head, known to lose his cool, and many times the team suffered from it. Not an attitude becoming of a captain. This season, it seems that he's straightened up. I think he just wasn't used to losing last season.   Edit: top 6 teams from each conference."
timbers,3bgo50,duganda,3,Mon Jun 29 02:34:44 2015 UTC,Top 6 teams in each conference   The consensus on Will Johnson is that he is incredible and that the Timbers are weak without him. He has the tendency to be a hothead but almost any team would love to have him in their midfield
timbers,3bgo50,19O1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:30:43 2015 UTC,"You might also want to know that the whole 'top 6 make the playoffs' thing is not necessarily all that popular among fans.

timbers,3bgo50,PDXFA,2,Mon Jun 29 06:22:07 2015 UTC,"how good is the team compared to the rest of the mls/conference   The western conference is a bloodbath.  If you look at the standings right now, San Jose, outside of the playoffs in the west, would be in second place in the east.  Every team in a playoff position in the west would be second place in the east and down.  The Timbers are currently competitive, but like I said, it's a bloodbath.   also are there any considerable differences between the transfer market in the us and europe?   The European leagues are all about who can pay the most.  MLS is single-entity, so there isn't competition between clubs.  Big name players--the internationally known designated players--basically get to go where they want, which means New York, LA, Seattle, and eventually Miami when Beckham's team comes around."
timbers,3bgo50,Cascadianranger,2,Mon Jun 29 04:10:36 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend looking at the chants on YT. Best way to get familiar. BTW I'm a new Liverpool fan, so maybe we can help each other out. I need to know the same stuff about them.   I know Will Johnson lived in Liverpool for a while (I think he's our best player but I'm biased) and Gerrard was a big role model for him. And now they'll be playing against each other in October."
timbers,3bgo50,duganda,2,Mon Jun 29 05:15:07 2015 UTC,"Our second rival is Vancouver. The timbers, sounders and whitecaps all are rival and play in a rivalry called the Cascadia Cup. Basically, whoever ends with the most points in games between the 3 teams wins the cup. It's 100% independent of the MLS unlike other rivalries and all 3 teams stand united to keep it that way. It is by far the top rivalry in the league."

timbers,3b376d,Ragnar_Targaryen,8,Thu Jun 25 20:44:49 2015 UTC,"So I did a quick read about Wynalda and maybe it's a combination of two things?   Maybe Wynalda applied for the HC job along with Caleb Porter and of course the latter got the job. Then, in 2012, Wynalda was the head coach of Cal FC when CFC beat the Timbers in a USOC match.   Sounds like a man who is just bitter. There's no other connection to the Timbers or MP that I can find."
timbers,3b376d,Ragnar_Targaryen,4,Thu Jun 25 18:14:28 2015 UTC,Cal FC happened while Spenny was still the coach. The beef stemmed from Porter's hiring. It was obvious from a few delete tweets Wynalda wasn't considered. He's been pretty public that he wants an MLS job but seems to be blacklisted because no one gives him a shot and he has no role in the USMNT setup.
timbers,3b376d,RobotDeathSquad,4,Thu Jun 25 20:42:53 2015 UTC,"Oh I had no idea Spenny was the coach back then, I thought Porter replaced him by then. My mistake."
timbers,3b376d,Ragnar_Targaryen,2,Thu Jun 25 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"He also seems to believe that he's entitled to an MLS head coach position despite near zero coaching experience outside of the one-off of Cal FC, and Atlanta where he spent less than a season in a part time role and didn't exactly impress.  He's hugely entitled for having done relatively little."
timbers,3b376d,Suedars,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:06:53 2015 UTC,"Wynalda pointed out that Jay Heaps was an inferior player, had roughly the same background (player then commentator) and Heaps got the Revolution job. On the other hand Heaps isn't the kind of guy who tries to make everything about him all the time. If you want to be that guy you have to be nearly guaranteed to succeed (like Jose Mourinho). If Wynalda had won a string of titles in Atlanta he'd have an MLS job for sure."
timbers,3b376d,wessizzle,2,Sat Jun 27 14:21:01 2015 UTC,Maybe the fact that Wynalda is assuming playing skill=coaching skill illustrates why he isn't coaching.

What brought me here though was the great interactions I've had with timbers fans on the mls reddit, as well as a love for your colors and uniforms. For some reason I also feel a bond for your city despite never having been there. Lol! Probably because my favorite places have been the mountains of California and the forests of Massachusetts which combine to form Portland."

As soon as the team felt that they were at the opposite end of a bad break, they were playing like it simply wasn't meant to be. They were making bad passes, not intercepting balls that were easily within reach, and hesitating shots just like we were at the start of the season. They are playing like they have the confidence of a bunch of kids. When they're winning, they are more than a handful and playing beautifully. But as soon as something doesn't go their way, ""fuck this, I'm not playing this game anymore!"" (Perfect display of this was that last goal off the free kick.

timbers,3auq2n,_sohcahtoa_,-1,Wed Jun 24 06:31:02 2015 UTC,"Here's the piece. The relevant part, via Google Translate:   'What did you have to get used to the game over?  I'm struggling a bit with this topic because my arrival at the club, was intended to be the team's center forward. That told me the technical (Caleb Porter). But as time went on the coach was considering other options, because they understand that I am also a second striker and there are times when the team plays with 4-2-3-1 pattern. Where those players playing behind the striker does not always have to be front or hooks. They can be fliers not as offensive or mixed to aid in midfield. And the truth is I'm a little denying that situation. Usually I end up playing second striker. And not not want to play anywhere else, because when I first came to the club I had to play down the left, since the DT needed. But it is true that I lack the confidence of the coach and give me a definite place in the team. Because there is a definite identity that way. For what we seek? The player in this scheme of three players behind nine is a player who attack or to deal more to be near the middle of the pitch what we want for the team? I have my point of view and maybe someone can think differently. I think it has to be a second striker and be thinking offensively."

timbers,3aryc2,joechoj,9,Tue Jun 23 00:56:34 2015 UTC,"I have to say I think the roster construction of the Timbers' attack almost has it perfect.  Let's see:   Urruti: game based on movement off the ball, ability to participate in passing combinations. Adi: game based on strength - sort of.  Despite his size he isn't quite yet a target forward.  Valeri: #10 - not a second striker.  Can playmake from deeper positions Gaston: a second striker - not necessarily a #10.  Prefers to playmake and get into the box Nagbe: drifts centrally from wide positions to playmake, dribbles into space Wallace/Asprilla: true winger, stays wide, runs directly at players   In each of the three attacking positions (striker, attacking mid, winger) the Timbers have players with different styles of play and strengths without having a huge drop-off in quality.  When everyone is firing on all cylinders it's a very potent threat. I do think we need a third forward who is very, very fast, because neither Urruti or Adi is a true speedster with the ball.  As for weak links, I think it's (a) guarding against and dealing with a dip in form, and (b) figuring out how to make all of these players play together.  So far I think Gaston and Adi haven't figured that out, but Valeri and Adi have, which means we have two pairs to play #10 and #9, since Gaston and Urruti work well together.  Nagbe seems to work with everyone, as does Wallace.  I want to see more of Asprilla with the Gaston/Urruti combination, or maybe Wallace/Gaston/Asprilla/Urruti, to mix the more and less direct styles."
timbers,3aryc2,duganda,4,Tue Jun 23 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"Imo, one good thing is that because Adi and Urruti are two different strikers, on games where Urruti is being contained well and isn't able to do much, when we sub Adi in, the opposing defense often seem to have a hard time adjusting to the change in striker. That's part of why I think Adi was able to score in the New England match."
timbers,3aryc2,Rhormus,2,Tue Jun 23 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's been pretty true.  But imagine if we had the triple threat: one size, one speed, and one foot skills.

Also, as I read what I wrote above, I should clarify that I am not convinced Adi is the right person for that role. I am in the camp that says if we can upgrade there we should or lower his pay. But Porter has a role for him."
timbers,3aryc2,duganda,7,Tue Jun 23 19:19:53 2015 UTC,"We're seeing more consistency from more of the players.  Borchers and Ridgewell have figured out how to communicate.  Villafana was dumping blind crosses earlier but now they're hitting their mark.  Powell, while I budding star, would just have bad games. Or more like really bad moments. Hasn't had one in a while.  Johnson and Valeri being back means that Chara can focus on playing that D-mid role instead of playing box-to-box. As much as I love the sparkplug, the attack suffers when he needs to create more (his birthday weekend aside).  This means less is being ask of Jewsbury. Bless him, but at this stage in his career he's a super-sub, not a starter. He'll be critical in the US Open Cup game(s) but if he can rest he'll play better.  Wallace, who seemed lost out there for parts of the early season, is on his game. Competition with Asprilla seems to have motivated him a bit.  Porter has paired Urruti with Fernandez and Adi with Valeri to great success."
timbers,3aryc2,diabloblanco,2,Tue Jun 23 01:31:28 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Shit is working finally!  I kid a bit, but like Porter said at his latest presser, the lads played great in the first two games of the year against RSL and L.A. but only got two points, and he said they may have played their best game of the year against the Caps away and we fricking lost.  I agree with him that we looked great in all three games, but results weren't there.  I think the key thing that has happened is belief/effort has increased, both at the team-wide level but also for individuals.  If we can keep that level of effort and belief, we will be hard to beat.  Bring on Barcelona!"

Not saying that Valeri and Urruti wouldn't also have a terrific partnership, just that Adi is far less effective when he's not having perfect balls delivered to him.

We were ripped off on no PK call for Jorge, though not as aggregiously as Houston, but we got a PK call on Horst's foul of Papa that is often ignored. Jorge is apparently an automaton because that set-piece assist to Maxi was such a carbon copy of his one to Adi, and Maxi put it exactly where Adi did.  Strange, indeed. I was glad to see Gaston step up to the PK, and oh boy did he nail it.  What a nice take. That was a sick dummy that Lovejoy did in the 81st minute.   I think the win was deserved, but I can definitely understand Houston feeling hard done.  We've been there enough times ourselves.  I'm wondering whether the fact that we were the opponent when deuceface melted down will help us with the refs in some subconcious way ... kind of a refereee equivalent of ""Here, have an upvote!""."
timbers,3aoj8k,FlyHighDontFall,2,Mon Jun 22 16:26:52 2015 UTC,"Houston ripped off by Toledo on negated goal. This isn't even debatable.    I'll debate that. It is illegal to set a pick in soccer. If in the ref's opinion the two attackers coordinated to set a pick, then it's absolutely the correct call. Watching the replay from the angles provided, I think it was an outstanding call by Toledo. I think that's why you didn't see much of a complaint from Houston, other than the guy who got called saying 'he ran into me'. Technically he's correct in that he didn't move into the path of the defender, but they'd probably practiced it and use it every once in a while trying to get away with it."

timbers,3aoj8k,joshing_slocum,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"It is illegal to set a pick in soccer   Can you point me to a rules/interpretation on this?  I feel like I know the obstruction rule reasonably well, but obstruction can't occur from a stationary and normal (not arms extended, etc.) position.  Clark was clearly not obstructing, but I am clueless about the prohibition against a ""pick""  Any help would be appreciated."
timbers,3aoj8k,FlyHighDontFall,2,Mon Jun 22 23:28:11 2015 UTC,"To put in terms of the laws of the game, it falls under 'Impedes the progress of the opponent'. Basically, if your primary intent is to block the opponent while making no attempt to play the ball (or put yourself) in position to play the ball, you're guilty of obstruction. When you set a pick, your primary goal is to impede the progress of your opponent, and you no longer have a right to your space.  This is similarly applied if an attacking player deliberately places himself in the path of the keeper to prevent him from making a play on the ball, regardless of whether he was in that space first.  The laws are wonderfully simple (read: vague) so these nuances aren't as clear and well defined as they really ought to be."
timbers,3aoj8k,joshing_slocum,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"deliberately places himself in the path   Here is where we may be seeing things differently.  In my assessment of the play in question, Clark is stationary (tiny, inconsequential movement, but he doesn't change his position on the field to ""place himself in the path"").  Any/every player is entitled to his current position, and in my viewing of the play, Jorge runs into a stationary Clark.  I did a brief search, and this post was on topic and it says in part: ""USSF answer (July 21, 2008): Simple answer covering all eventualities: A player is allowed to occupy space but is not allowed to move into space that an opponent is actively using with the result that the opponent is forced to stop, swerve, or slow down to avoid contact. Under normal circumstances, “impeding” does not involve physical contact (which is why it is a “lesser” offense) — if contact occurs, the impeding player is now guilty of a direct rather than an indirect free kick offense."" http://www.askasoccerreferee.com/?p=358  At this point, I stand by my ""not debatable"" view."
timbers,3aoj8k,FlyHighDontFall,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:49:06 2015 UTC,"The USSF response on that page sidestepped the more direct question to give an essentially canned response for a more general scenario. Their statement is technically correct, but is not how a professional referee would be trained to judge the play we're discussing.  You cannot occupy space with primary intent to impede your opponent. Clark never even looked at the ball in play, and in fact he shuffled his feet and moved slightly to allow his player to pass close by, and to 'pick' the defender. You can either interpret the call as Clark did move into that space (by shuffling or setting up there to coordinate with his teammate) or that he had an affirmative obligation to not impede his opponent, because he was not playing the ball.  Similarly, if the ball is headed toward your hand/arm you have an affirmative obligation to attempt to move it out of the way (or not place it in a deliberately prone position.)  There are ways to disguise a pick such that a referee will not have cause to call a foul; had Clark looked at the ball and feigned an attempt to move to play it, he likely wouldn't have been called for the foul.  I'm quite certain everybody on the pitch knew it was the right call, even Clark."
timbers,3aoj8k,FlyHighDontFall,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"The response by Richard Dawson at http://www.asktheref.com/Soccer%20Rules/Question/20425/ is far more thoughtful and explanatory.  ""If one player is stationary the moving player is generally at fault unless the stationary player took a static position to impede as setting a pick. Then it is in effect a holding foul as the insertion of a body into the run was deliberate to impede the player not stand your ground or plays the ball.""  TL:DR :: You don't have a right to the space if you're not making a play, and your only intent is to impede your opponent."

The two players make identical kicking motions, the timing of the collision just gives the Houston player the short end of the stick.

timbers,3akvep,tottenhamhotsauce,5,Sun Jun 21 06:25:19 2015 UTC,I love how hard he goes. We were up 2-0 in the ~85th minute and he is still sprinting to save the ball from going out of bounds. True captain right there

timbers,3akrpo,serpentjaguar,-3,Mon Jun 22 17:20:39 2015 UTC,I wasn't too keen on his prima donna antics during the pk (unless someone can explain what he was trying to accomplish by continuously placing the ball off the circle there?) I jumped to an unfair conclusion there. If he's starting to buy into his role I'm on board with keeping him around! The argentine connection has been money lately!!
timbers,3akrpo,sleepandstatic,11,Sun Jun 21 05:38:41 2015 UTC,Could be his technique for messing with the keeper. It's probably pretty anxious being up there waiting for the kick. No idea that's the reason though.

timbers,3aktfr,acquiesce,2,Sun Jun 21 05:11:46 2015 UTC,I like Adi   Why?
timbers,3aktfr,Nightbynight,5,Sun Jun 21 11:38:25 2015 UTC,Because he scores a lot of goals and seems like a nice guy.
timbers,3aktfr,acquiesce,5,Sun Jun 21 11:40:09 2015 UTC,"a lot of goals   He may have 6 goals, but he's only scored in 4 matches out of 16. That's a really awful strike rate. I'm not trying to be critical of you or anything, but considering he adds almost nothing to the pitch other than scoring every 4 games, I just don't get why people like him."
timbers,3aktfr,Nightbynight,5,Sun Jun 21 11:45:20 2015 UTC,"I just don't get why people like him.   As I said, I (and I think some other people) like him because he scores a lot of goals and seems like a nice guy.  ~I know he doesn't score in a lot of matches~ Edit: after a little research, it turns out he is close to all the other leaders (if you exclude PKs) in matches with a goal with 4. All but one player has scored in either 5 or 6 matches). It's fun/nice having the 8th highest scorer in the league on your team (tied for 5th most goals if you get rid of PKs).  If you get rid of PKs for the other guys, his g/90min is higher than Wondo, Dempsey, Giovinco, Rivero, and Davies and it's higher than some of those guys even with PKs.  He has also had the disadvantage of playing without WJ and DV for most of his minutes, which has hindered his ability to score.  We're obviously a score-by-committee team and I like having someone like Adi on the team.  I didn't say I thought he was an amazing or even great player, I just said I liked him.  I wouldn't be upset to see him go, but enjoy having him while he's here.  Edit:  Sorry, didn't mean for this to turn into me defending Adi when I said I liked him, but just so you know, of the players tied with him or above him in goals scored this is how many games they've scored in compared to how many they've played:    Player # matches scored in total matches PKs Starts    Kamara 7 15 0 15   Wondo 7 (4 w/o PKs) 15 3 14   dempsey 5 12 1 12   Giovinco 5 13 0 13   Martins 6 11 0 10   Kaka 7 (3 w/o PKs) 16 4 16   Bruin 5 15 0 10   Villa 5 (3 w/o PKs) 13 2 12   Rivero 6 17 0 16   Nemeth 5 11 0 9   Adi 4 16 0 10   Davies 6 15 0 11   Barnes 5 14 0 14    So, if Adi had scored in just one extra match (which was tougher for him him without DV/WJ and only having 10 starts), he'd be right with everyone else.  Personally, I think you're expecting a little too much from him.  Looks like he's right where he should be, but it'd be nice for him to score in an extra match or two."

timbers,3afnwx,untouchedURL,3,Fri Jun 19 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"According to the Policy Manual, the charge of Referee Abuse carries a minimum three-game suspension, with the suspended individual precluded from participating in any soccer competition until the suspension has expired.  So, he got the minimum, and this allows him to be in Gold Cup.  Decent chance, I would guess, that Seattle asks Jurgen to leave him off since they are without Oba for 3-6 weeks and now deuceface for 3 games, and if he goes to Gold Cup it would be 2-3 more.  In any case, we won't see him in Portland at the end of this month (unless he wants to sit in the stands!)."

I saw the pre-season interview where Perkins talks about playing in Seattle and the ""shot"" at the Timbers supporters and it really wasn't a big deal. The guy was not happy to be traded to MTL and he's happy to be back in the PNW and have a chance to show his old club that he's in a better place - every single person here would feel the same way in that situation.  Perkins was the best keeper we've had as an MLS club and certainly the most technically sound. I was really sad to see him go and I want him to do well elsewhere (albeit not against the Timbers).  It just feels like there's a lot of scorned lovers in /r/timbers and it's not hidden very well."
timbers,3a7f9b,PatrickSFG,5,Thu Jun 18 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"Perkins was the best keeper we've had as an MLS club and certainly the most technically sound.   Not with his distribution skills. He was good in the box but do you remember how something like 1/4 of his clearances were to nobody or straight out of bounds?  I think anyone here is fine with ex-Timbers bitching about the FO or the Timbers organization in general, but when you talk shit about the fans (us) of course we will have something to say back. We were never anything but supportive of Perkins and it seems he did not appreciate that, so good riddance."
timbers,3a7f9b,sumthingcool,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:05:55 2015 UTC,Surely you're referring to Ricketts? His distribution was the worst I have ever seen in a keeper.

He was a solid defensive presence for us between the pipes. He did have distribution problems though"" ""To me Perkins has his distribution limitations"" ""His distribution is terrible.""

MLS rules, according to these guys on what seems an official MLS podcast, require either a minimum 3-game suspension for abuse, or minimum 6-game suspension for assault. This is the suspension that would carry over to international play such as Gold Cup.

However, according to section 305 parts c & d of the Policy Manual of the U.S. Open Cup of the Bylaws of United States Soccer Federation, Inc states the following:    (c) A suspension shall be served by the individual at the next Cup match or matches of the team of that individual. If the individual has no remaining Cup matches during the year, the suspension shall be served at the following year’s Open Cup competition’s matches first played. (d) The Open Cup Commissioner shall review the circumstances concerning all red and yellow cards issued. If the Commissioner believes that the actions of the individual receiving the card or cards should be further reviewed to determine if a greater penalty than the minimum penalty should be imposed, the Commissioner will refer the matter to the Adjudication and Discipline Panel for further consideration. The Panel shall review a card matter referred to it and may impose a longer suspension period or impose a fine, or both.   So it looks like there is a grey area as to what may happen based on what rules will be enforced and as to how the Open Cup Commissioner will determine if a greater penalty is necessary."

timbers,3a6eow,thebarroomhero,2,Wed Jun 17 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I actually broke down the play to a Sounder's fan because he thought that it was all justified.    I don't know why I was down voted so much, look at the replay. . . you posted the replay . . . I'll break down the play and tell me if you see differently:  @1:34:52: Villafana flops to the ground looking for a call  @1:34:52(at the same time Villafana flops): Brad Evans knees Villafana in the back accidentally, causing Villafana to fall forwards (if you notice, Villafana begins to flop backwards but get's kneed in the back to fall forward onto the ball)  @1:34:53: Brad Evans knees and kicks Villafana, again, in the back trying to get the ball (again, I don't think he did that on purpose)  While it's unfortunate that this all happened, it still happened which forces the referee to make a call. Just because Brad Evans didn't mean to cause the dangers, he still did which always results in a talking to or a card.  Also, Sigi claims that Villafana was playing the ball from all fours. It's quite clear in the video that you posted that he didn't make any attempt for the ball when he flopped.   That was my response to someone at this thread. The Sounders fanatics were getting to me because they were justifying almost EVERYTHING that the Sounders did (except Dempsey)."
timbers,3a6eow,Ragnar_Targaryen,5,Thu Jun 18 02:49:10 2015 UTC,Guy did a fine job. The Azira red seemed harsh but that's it.
timbers,3a6eow,cynicalvanilla,4,Wed Jun 17 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"I'd want to rewatch the match to be sure, but I've rewatched all the second half cards and all the goals, and I think the ref got everything right.  Sigi was complaining about offside on RodWall's goal, but it looked like he was on when Fochive struck it (bad angle, so not positive).  The only questionable one was Azira red, but that was mostly because everyone was looking at the elbow; the real reason he got called for a red was that he strafed Gaston's ankle with his cleats.  If you look at the video during the time Dempsey is ready to throw-down with the ref, you will see the ref talking to Neagle and indicating a foot-stomp by making that motion.  Frankly, his big mistake was pulling yellow initially on Dempsey; that should be straight red the instant that Dempsey grabbed anything from the ref."
timbers,3a6eow,joshing_slocum,3,Wed Jun 17 20:00:48 2015 UTC,I haven't seen the match yet. (I don't watch one freakin' match...) But I actually wonder if Shittle wasn't pissed off because they are so accustomed to the MLS refs being super lenient towards them.

timbers,3a6eow,onekrazykat,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:34:17 2015 UTC,I know - I found it odd that the normally heavy handed defenders weren't the ones who got any cards/cautions.
timbers,3a6eow,mrgerbek,2,Wed Jun 17 22:50:10 2015 UTC,"In the moment watching the game live on youtube, I thought the ref gave a lot of the little breaks our way. The bit with throw-ins being called back did seem to punish the Sounders more than the Timbers, for instance.   But looking at the cards, they all seem to hold up. Evans and Jewsbury both got yellows for similar late challenges.   On Evans' second yellow he definitely pulled down Villafaña and put in the boot; when the whistle was I can't tell, but there wasn't a lot Villafaña could do to get away.   For Azira, looking back the problem looks like his foot, not his elbow. [1] Look at this video starting at 7:04. Azira gets the ball, knocks over Urruti fair and square, then goes at Fernandez and the ball. Azira hits the ball away from Fernanzez with his left foot, and cuts back to his right. At this moment, watch Azira's left foot. He reaches out and rakes Fernandez's right foot, nowhere near the ball. It's not the planted foot of him accelerating away, it's a strike at a player away from the ball.   15 yards behind him, with no obstructions, stands the ref looking straight at this event. His whistle arm comes to his mouth before Gastón even hits the ground. Is it a straight red? I'm not confident enough in the rulebook to say for sure, but having watched it carefully, I'll now take his word for it.    [1: The announcer was fantastically entertaining, but he was wrong about a lot of his observations... including that this was about an elbow.]   [Edit: Oh, and for the RodWal goal, using the six yard line as a reference it looks to me like he was onside. Jewsbury may have been offside, but he didn't get a piece of the ball.]"
timbers,3a6eow,peacefinder,2,Thu Jun 18 00:13:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't think the ref had a great night, but he was no worse than most MLS refs. Cards were all justified, save maybe the Azira red. We don't have a good angle on that. Sometimes what looks heinous from one angle looks fine from another, and vice-versa. Every other card was clearly deserved. Honestly, after the argie-bargie, I think Rose should have seen a few yellows - dude was playing like a mad drunk.   What's so funny is the Sounders and their fans are so pissed off because, essentially, they had some bad luck with the Oba's injury and the timing of their third sub. Bad luck happens in soccer. You don't get to lose your shit every time it happens, though!"

One of them is murder.  Here's more for you. Ah those classy ""49er fans"" and their poor sportsmanship. Foot, meet mouth."

The other does, and is a prime example of how most people consider many hawks fans as poor-sports. And it was more than just one handful, thats just what you saw on tv, so quit trying to downplay your fanbases shittyness. But thats besides the point. The fact that you would try and compare one crazy dudes (who just happens to be a niner fan) murder, unrelated to refs or a game, with the poor sportsmanship of another fanbase, proves that your strawgrasping for your own team and fanbase.   Anyways ""dintclempsy"" i don't want to argue with you about this anymore, obviously were both stubborn in our views, so maybe go back to your teams sub? thanks"

Classy 49ers fans all around.  My overarching point is that people who judge entire fan bases on a handful of bad apples are complete idiots, and plainly don't understand basic statistics. I can guarantee 100% of the 40,000 people showing up at the stadium every weekend aren't model citizens. Same for the 49ers. Same for the Timbers.  You can be one of them if you're so inclined, and if that makes you feel better about getting defeated all the time, because those are usually the fans who resort to those types of moronic illogical arguments."

I personally just see it more with the hawks fans than any other team, maybe its because I live in Portland, idk. I regularly see hawks fans shit talk like they were the fucking steelers, but know nothing about there own team or the league, with the tag of their jersey still hanging on their back. Yes, you generally see bandwagons when a team is being succesful (especially for the first time), but it seems to me and alot of people I know that the Seattle fan base and teams are jerks. You obviously think otherwise, and thats cool, defend your team and fanbase, I'll do the same.

It was tough to tell from the camera angle if he spat near or on the ref, but my impression in the moment was he was aiming dead center of the ref's chest and was too close to miss. (The ref, to his credit, did not even flinch.)  Edit: The spit was at 2:32:07.

timbers,3a4oyh,duganda,11,Wed Jun 17 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"Setting aside all the crazy stuff there at the end for a second, what I saw was this:   Portland kept their team balance and composure for 120 minutes.  This is a really big deal. Seattle worked harder than the Timbers, especially once they were down to nine players. A front four of Wallace, Nagbe, Fernandez, and Adi on a small field looked disjointed and not sure how to play together. Nagbe looked absolutely lost for most of that game, his late shot on goal notwithstanding.   With regard to the crazy stuff, if the Timbers had scored in the last 5-7 minutes of the regular game we would have missed out on the shenanigans but had to play 30 fewer minutes.  I would have preferred the 2-1 win without extra time."

I'd expect Weber in goal, Papparatto, Fochive, etc.  We're on a win streak in the regular season, and beating Houston this weekend would be huge.

Also, his tone can be somewhat whine-y and pleading; doesn't seem to exude confidence. I hope his locker-room presence is very different.  Maybe he gave the interview before his morning coffee? :)  EDIT: Yech, listening to his 'dream XI' segment is just painful. ""Do you want me to start up top?"" Make the executive decision, Coach!!

timbers,38zr03,The_Real_Scoey,2,Mon Jun 8 13:58:15 2015 UTC,Cannot express how HUGE the upcoming games against Houston and LA are.  We are right above them on the table and this is a real chance to create some space.
timbers,38zr03,diabloblanco,2,Mon Jun 8 14:07:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit nervous about those games since we play Seattle in Open Cup on the 16th, then Houston on the 20th, and LA on the 25th, so 3 games in a little over 1 week.  Luckily the travel is light.  But, hey, we're all fixed now, so honestly, who could beat us, right?  Maybe Barcelona ... maybe."
timbers,38zr03,joshing_slocum,3,Mon Jun 8 18:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that Open Cup game is a bit worrying. I don't think either team is putting a huge emphasis on this game which can lead to a lot of bad feels if we end up on the wrong side of the result. If Porter does put out a team meant to win then it may hurt us in league play. If it were any team other than Seattle I wouldn't be thinking of it but that added tension makes for a crazy week."
timbers,38zr03,diabloblanco,6,Mon Jun 8 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like no matter which team CP fields, he's going to take flack.  Either he's sacrificing our USOC chances in a game against our biggest rivals, or he's risking the regular season progress. Not an enviable position.   Best to just win it all so people leave him alone."

timbers,38zr03,joshing_slocum,2,Mon Jun 8 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"I'm most sketched out about Houston, because they're one of the league's wilder wild cards. LA will likely get better with Robbie Keane inching back into the team, but they've got serious weaknesses in midfield (Mika Varynen may never find his feet and, when they play him there, or even wide, Baggio Husidic). Also, I like the way Portland's smaller players (e.g. most of them) match up against a big galoot like Omar Gonzalez. Pray for a terrible night for Jaime Penedo (for he has them) and you've done your bit."
timbers,38zr03,TheChairmanJeff,2,Tue Jun 9 06:29:50 2015 UTC,"All good points.  Penedo killed us last time, but LA is fairly weak.  My problem is they are our 3rd game in 8 days, so that is where I think we are vulnerable."

timbers,38vi6l,joshing_slocum,8,Sun Jun 7 04:57:25 2015 UTC,I don't think you can easily overestimate how important Johnson's presence is.  He seems able to focus the team in a way that just doesn't happen when he's not there.  The Timbers are a far more haphazard operation without him.

timbers,38vi6l,pawliejaan,6,Sun Jun 7 05:45:16 2015 UTC,Arguably the most complete match we have played ever. Defensively nothing got past us and any leaks we may have had where dealt with by Kwarsey. Offensively we where on a constant attack and held them back most of the game.
timbers,38vi6l,Tevis,5,Sun Jun 7 07:39:10 2015 UTC,First match for my AZ based family - excellent outcome. Still missing Valeri in that #10 playmaker / unlocked role. Nagbe is always better slicing in from the outside. Hope Asprilla is okay but he looked very upset - he's been a revelation. The Timbers right side is so fast and skilled with Asprilla and Powell.   I haven't been on reddit much for Timbers chatter but will have to come back around. Cheers Timbers fans!!

timbers,38vi6l,joechoj,5,Sun Jun 7 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"Adi 6th in the league in goals, 0.54/90m. Hard to fault that even if he hasn't been incredibly consistent. Others need to start scoring more as well."
timbers,38vi6l,joshing_slocum,6,Sun Jun 7 12:58:05 2015 UTC,To be honest I'm loving the Urruti starting and Adi sub (for either him or Fernandez).  He has seemed much more effective once 37 has tired out some defense with his hard runs for 70+ minutes.  Adi starting hasn't produced the results I like.  Even though it sucks to have a DP not play the full 90 it's been the better strategy.
timbers,38vi6l,paulcole710,2,Sun Jun 7 14:28:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thoughts. I love to see Adi do well. But I don't think it means he should be starting. His best games have been off the bench. Urruti's energy not only softens up the defense like you say, but sets a better tone w the rest of the team. His high press rushes passes out of the back, leading to better chances of turnovers at midfield or better. Adi doesn't have the bulk and/or fierceness to impose his style of hold-up play on a defense for a full 90. If he starts, balls sent to him often end in turnovers (being pushed off the ball, falling). The attack plods and we're put back on defense too quickly too often. If he subs in, he has the bulk/fierceness to dominate tired defenders.   Also, someone made a good point I can't shake: most of his goals don't come from hold-up play, but crosses & set pieces. He's best moving towards goal. We've been playing him wrong."

I can understand not hustling off the field, but maybe he was giving the rest of his team some time to get a breather as he was subbing off. Just giving him the benefit of the doubt. Either way, I don't see him as a part of this team longer than this season, but if we can get the shift he put in tonight out of him on a regular basis, then I am okay with that."

timbers,38vy2c,oregonianrager,5,Sun Jun 7 09:03:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah he looked bummed with his own personal performance. The tape is thr tape over his wedding ring, which i can understand why he leaves on the field. He was a man in fire for the past two games, yesterday he wasnt 100%"
timbers,38vy2c,joshing_slocum,3,Sun Jun 7 14:58:27 2015 UTC,"I think you are correct.  Like the others said, he had a fine game, though not in the top-6 players, and his last 2 games were very good, but the Timbers have a very, very strong spirit and locker-room, and La Gata is as close to poison-in-the-well as we've got.  I think we use his good run of form lately as trade bait."
timbers,38vy2c,SegwayCop,3,Sun Jun 7 15:10:15 2015 UTC,"When he got subbed off, he fucking meandered off the field, leaving some of his tape on the pitch. He couldn't even muster a jog off the field. (PICK YOUR GODDAMNED FEET UP.)   You could tell that he was pissed about being subbed. He was ripping that tape off and tossing it like a baby. Porter either has a beef or wasn't rewarding his childish behavior because no hands were smacked together between the two to congratulate La Gata on a good shift. I think that once we have another decent attacking midfielder Gaston will go."
timbers,38vy2c,GottaFindThatReptar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:11:17 2015 UTC,Really think too much is being made of him being pissed at being subbed. It's not uncommon to be angry when you're subbed after not getting things going. Long as he isn't a locker room cancer then who cares?  We need depth and has the ability to step in when Valeri's out (which has been a lot the last 2 seasons). Not on the get rid of La Gata train unless we bring someone else in for him. Suppose end of year would be fine though.  Think we place too much importance on wanting all our players to be a perfect happy family and on hustling at all times.

timbers,38vy2c,jv3456,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:40:28 2015 UTC,He was instrumental in 6 of the 9 points we picked up in the last three games. Last night he was part of the team that ended with three points. I think in the end we'll upgrade him. In the mean time I'll be grateful  for the depth.
timbers,38vy2c,acquiesce,2,Mon Jun 8 03:00:30 2015 UTC,"And I'm sure he is helpful at practice going against defenders.  Don't get the constant hate that remains when he's clearly playing better than he has in the past.  Not ideal, but I don't feel the need for an anti-Gaston post after every. single. win.  But... people do love complaining!"
timbers,38vy2c,acquiesce,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:27:16 2015 UTC,"Yay.  Another negative post immediately after a (huge) win.  And...surprise, it's about Fernandez!  This might be the third on in three matches.     leaving some of his tape on the pitch.   This is the norm for him.  He's done it the last three times he's been subbed off.  Doesn't make it right, but it's nothing new.  If CP really cared about it, he'd say something.  Also, Urruti does the same thing.  Many times a sub means a small break for the players and the time will get added to stoppage time (see USA match during WC when ref added additional minute when it took Wondo(?) 45 seconds to walk off).     Apparently, he didn't even stand for the two goals scored.   Where'd you hear this?  Not saying it didn't happen, but would like to see it since I have a hard time believing it."
timbers,38vy2c,acquiesce,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I knew you were going to yell at me for this post, /u/acquiesce. I'm sorry. :(   I know you hate the negative posts, and generally I agree with you.  I'm RCTID, rain or shine, yell my lungs out for 90+ mins, tend to defend the team which people are saying things like ""care like we do"", etc.  Even when I'm feeling down during our slumps, I'm generally trying to find the bright side. I try not to make too many negative posts...  all that said:   He was literally the only bad part of the evening for me. It frustrated me, and I vented.    This is the norm for him. He's done it the last three times he's been subbed off. Doesn't make it right, but it's nothing new. If CP really cared about it,    I care about it, but I don't have La Gata's ear in the locker room to tell him to act like a grownup/professional. The fact that the poor behavior isn't new only makes it worse.   As for the not standing, I saw it on twitter.  So, at this point it's hearsay because I didn't see it either.  I was too busy celebrating to look at the bench. I'm actually watching the replay right now, and maybe it will be visible and EDIT: totally forgot to look for it.  Anyways, I'm happy to drop it for now.  I'd love to discuss Adi having 40% of our goals for the season, or Nagbe's absolute kick-ass performance, or our defensive line who shut down some great attacks, Urruti getting carded for sarcasm (yes, I consider this a positive... totally worth it), or Johnson being Johnson and Chara being Chara."
timbers,38vy2c,artofscarf,2,Mon Jun 8 18:50:50 2015 UTC,"Haha, I know, I know.  I'm just tired of seeing it, but I get that people can complain all they want and I'm just the vocal minority speaking up against.  I don't really hate negative posts as much as it seems like I do, but I've seen these complaints multiple times in the last two weeks.  He may have been the ""only bad part"" but, personally, I can't relate to being so upset by a couple of things a player did (that weren't related to their playing) to take the time to make a post about it so soon after a huge win for the team, but that's just me.  As far as him walking off the field, in the last couple of weeks, I've made a point of watching others walk off the field and they're not that different than Gaston (other than leaving tape on the field).  I feel that he gets shit because of people's history of hating him.  Just a guess.  I just watched the reply and looked for it, but they didn't show it.  However, at the end of the match he went over to Adi and high fived him and CP gave Gaston a handshake, so there's that.  Definitely don't drop it (since you're not alone and it does contribute to additional discussion on the sub).  People love (and unite) over discussing negatives, so I get it.  I'm just trying to defend him and say that at least some of his antics are normal (for him and for others) and that he's not alone when it comes to the things he does.  Thanks for the reply."

timbers,38mci6,acquiesce,5,Fri Jun 5 03:38:08 2015 UTC,"Fans were grumbling, and a few anti-front office banners were unfurled in the crowed, even one draped over the entrance to the home locker room with the words “Same as it ever was” written under a red line, a not-so-subtle shot at the team’s struggles since winning the 2013 Western Conference regular-season title in Porter’s first year, leading to their only trip to the MLS Cup Playoffs since joining the league in 2011.   Say what you want about how ""ambiguous"" the banner was and how it was open to interpreation, but every comment/article I've seen written about the banner has brought up the fact that it refers to  PTFC always being below the red line, not that the supporters are the same as they ever were."
timbers,38mci6,funkopolis,5,Fri Jun 5 07:47:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not clear what your stance on the matter was/is, but I came away with the same interpretation of the sign as all the comments and articles. I was disappointed to see it at the park that day.   Even if the intention was to say that the support remained stalwart despite the team's shortcomings, a message is only as good as what it conveys to the recipients. In this case, the team and media (and myself) took it to be harsh criticism, and so, if it was ever there to begin with, the intended positivity was lost."
timbers,38mci6,notthinknboutdragons,2,Fri Jun 5 08:57:34 2015 UTC,"I interpreted how you did as well. I would have much rather seen a banner that encouraged the players or, if they wanted to attack the FO, was more blatant.  From the interview that I saw, WJ took it as a bash on the team."

Granted its the choices of the FO that get certain players on the field, but at the end of the day, those players are the reason we were below the red line.  I love this team, but to say there haven't been struggles all around and only blame one area and say the other isn't struggling and we didn't mean to point the finger at anyone but these guys is wrong. Porter playing Gaston out of position for so long put him in a situation where he didn't want to play to his fullest. The FO for pulling knee jerk reactions on players before really testing it out. The players seemingly giving up in some games. Everyone is at fault, but when you put a banner like that out for the players to see, who is really going to take offense to that? The FO gets your money regard less.   Sorry if this was a little long winded, the banner really bugged me and I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one.  Edit: I said we are below the red line. Not the case right now."
timbers,38juka,IRraymaker,11,Thu Jun 4 18:26:51 2015 UTC,While missing Jones and Agudelo is big. I would argue that they still have enough weapons to mess us up if we aren't careful. Did you check that Fagundez free kick last week? Him and Nyugen are probably going to be on the field at the same time so I can only expect they will bring their a game. Not sleeping at all on NE and a winless in last 5 only makes me worried this is where they are

Benteke ain't going anywhere as has been stated.  I don't know enough about who else is out there but we should think twice about picking up relics who want to finish their careers in the MLS.

If there is any truth to Mario Gomez interested in MLS, he would also be a viable option at ST if we could land him. Adi is not worth DP money, we either need to reconstruct his contract or dump him.   Bottom line is we need a ST and any other player we sign is just a bonus.

Yes, we need a DP that can score, but as people have pointed out already this season, Adi is scoring roughly the same as he did last year (maybe a couple of goals fewer).  PTFC scored the third most goals in the league last year and we didn't make any offensive changes, except for bringing in Asprilla.  I know this is speculation, but I feel like once WJ and DV are inserted back in the lineup and the team gets to play together as a full team for a short time, we'll start to click even more.  With that said, I wouldn't mind signing a DP that can score goals consistently, but I also liked how we scored by committee last year.  Maybe we need a DP that can play the DV role and have the two of them play at the same time?  Not sure how that'd work.  Would either have to put new DP out wide for Wallace or change the lineup up.  Do you see us getting rid of Nagbe in the near future?  Safe to say that Adi will be first to go when we need to sign someone.  (Kind of rambled there as I left my thoughts flow.  Sorry about that.)"
timbers,38br21,acquiesce,15,Wed Jun 3 09:49:20 2015 UTC,"Problem with Adi is when he's not scoring, he provides almost nothing for the team. He doesn't win enough aerial balls, his hold-up play is pathetic for a man of his size, he gets knocked to the ground far too easily. He's a good enough ST, for a 200k contract, but wasting a DP spot on him is one of Gavin's poorest choices."
timbers,38br21,CommonSensePDX,3,Wed Jun 3 15:24:27 2015 UTC,"Good points.  But if anyone was happy with his production last year and they're upset with him this year, they just need to look at his stats to understand we're getting almost exactly what we got from him last year.  Also, it's important to point out, again, that 2014 Adi had DV and WJ playing with him almost every single match (every match?)."
timbers,38br21,acquiesce,2,Wed Jun 3 15:30:21 2015 UTC,"I think the point would be that with that level of service, almost any capable striker would be finishing some chances. I thought Adi was very good, when he was earning his contract. After he got the DP money his output dropped, but more importantly, it seemed his intensity and effort level dropped considerably. Really, there's just no justification for panic buying with a DP slot on a player that couldn't hack it in the Danish 1st division. I think we're way too gunshy because of Boyd. MP said he's willing to spend 5 million on a DP, I want to see that."
timbers,38br21,CommonSensePDX,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:52:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly, we need to find a Obafemi Martins like player. Someone not too young not too old and can score a shitload but isn't in high demand."

timbers,38br21,Yazbremski,6,Wed Jun 3 14:27:08 2015 UTC,If we're going for a veteran goal scorer then I'd vote for Berbatov.  He was just released from Monaco and wants to return the the Prem but will probably only get sniffs from low table teams.  He'd be expensive but not Bradley or Dempsey expensive.  Let him score goals for a few years then he'll retire and peace out back to Europe.

It seems as though none of the Timbers fans that I've talked to want to think about signing Adi last year as a DP. Of course last year was slightly different in that we needed to shore up the backline and stop goals, not necessarily score them, but Adi was still brought on as a DP. We need to stop hoping to sign a DP striker, and find a DP that fits our system regardless of his salary level."

timbers,385izv,joshing_slocum,9,Tue Jun 2 05:08:06 2015 UTC,"The away supporters sit in section 223, at the very northwesternmost corner of the park.  Not the greatest sightlines.  But if you are wearing Quakes gear, you'll probably feel most comfortable there. (And if you ARE wearing opposing team colors, do not buy Timbers Army tickets, as you will be escorted out of the sections.)  Virtual map of the stadium, with good replications of the sightlines from every seat, is here.  As for July 4th, a lot of things that are normally open will be closed, of course, but one of the best events of the year will be going on a pleasant walk from your hotel:  the Waterfront Blues Festival.  Music of all kinds, good food & drink, and fireworks after dusk (10ish).  It's very Portland-Fourth-of-July.  And you can enjoy it quite a bit without forking out for the higher-end tickets for the main acts.  Just tons of fun."

He did well this game.  Speaking of his attitude, after Cap'n Jack scored, there was a clip of La Gata jumping around and hugging Nagbe ... might make for a good gif to illustrate that he may actually want to stay with the team."
timbers,37yss8,joshing_slocum,5,Sun May 31 15:55:14 2015 UTC,Maybe getting so heavily benched woke him up a bit and he's finally trying to prove himself.

timbers,37yss8,joshing_slocum,6,Sun May 31 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"On one hand, you gotta feel for him. We've been playing him out of his typical position and then blaming him when it doesn't go well. So his attitude is somewhat justified.  But then again, it's his damn job to play his best regardless of position. If the fry cook at McDonald's gets put on register duty (at the same pay level), he doesn't get the option to be all huffy and mess up. Both teams still have to function. That's the ultimate goal.  So kudos to him for stepping up and getting it done. But I'm gonna reserve my judgement on him until he's for sure dropped the huffy attitude."

timbers,37yss8,joshing_slocum,2,Sun May 31 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"Hater checking in. I wasn't able to watch much of the game. However, I will say that he and Urruti have a thing going. It seems to me that when Fernandez plays in his preferred position with Urruti up top, they make things happen.   But, it also seems that Fernandez only plays there when we are juggling our lineup. When Valeri and Nagbe are in, it's almost like... the system doesn't fit him and he underperforms as a result.  I still have a pet peeve that he does not have a lot of interest in playing defense. For instance, come back with the opponent's CDM when they are on the ball. Really, all he has to do sometimes is drift 10 yards to that player and take an option away, but he just doesn't. I think he is a completely (like, 100%) offensive minded player, which argues even more for him playing as a forward rather than a CAM."
timbers,37yss8,PDXMB,3,Sun May 31 23:17:24 2015 UTC,"he does not have a lot of interest in playing defense   There were multiple times last match where he went after a ball, played D, or tried to recover a lost ball (that either he or his teammates lost).  One of the times he pressured someone it almost lead to a goal.  Overall, great match by him, both on offense and defense.  If you get a chance, watch the replay."

It may have looked messy (not Messi) toward the end, but this was their 3rd game in a week, and at elevation. They won the three points, and I'm giving them a pass. And by the way, we leapfrogged other teams to land above the Red Line of Doom. Yes, we have a game in hand over the Quakes. But the fact is before this game we were ahead of 1 team; now it's 4; and even if we gave SJ 3 points (no guarantee there) we'd still be ahead of 3.  Here are some other bright spots:   We got to rest Valeri, Johnson, Chara, and sub Nagbe out early, so they should be fresh for next week. Gaston has gotten himself very involved. Goal and assist in two games. These weeks and months without Valeri and Johnson have given valuable minutes to developing players.  As a result, certain players have been exposed as not being effective contributors. Hopefully the FO has taken some lessons from these recent Dark Days, and applies them during the transfer window. I don't know when it will be (next week?!?), but we are one week closer to having a full-strength squad. And we're headed into that with some great confidence-building momentum.   Is this the start of our run?"

timbers,37x2i3,ricodued,2,Sun May 31 03:20:05 2015 UTC,To be fair that's basically the west. We are a point behind second in the east. And say we hadn't given up that late goal vs LA. We would be 4th or 3rd right now. The west of MLS is the west of the nba
timbers,37x2i3,Cascadianranger,2,Sun May 31 05:25:45 2015 UTC,"I guess the takeaway here is that we're not as bad as the standings say we are, or at the very least we aren't bad just because the standings say we are.  Yes, being second-to-bottom of the table is was humiliating, but in context it's not that bad. I'd rather be at the top but, as you say, the west is as cutthroat as it's been since the 19th century (ok so I took some liberty with what you said)"

timbers,37x2i3,chrispdx,9,Sun May 31 03:01:52 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Okay. Let me first just say I'm sorry for being a downer before submitting this.  I know everyone's probably going to be pumped about this. But we just beat the worst team in soccer on a quite literally last-second goal. By our fucking holding midfielder, who just had to put the ball on target to score because their keeper and defense were garbage all night. We could have had 8 goals if the rest of the team did what Jack Jewsbury had one chance to do.  I'm pissed at our attackers in particular. They are shit. Still. Rodney Wallace turned in a shift of pure shit, with the sole exception of the sliding block on defense. He can't cross the ball, and he can't shoot the ball anywhere except for directly at a keeper or defender. Adi can't put anything on target to save his life no matter how many dudes he has to run over. Urruti was looking nice except for his inexplicable and untimely selfish spots.  It's been a while since I've been more frustrated after a win, let alone an emotional one like this. I know this is negative stuff after a win, and I know I should be happy for the three points, and I'm happy for Jack, but this game should have been like 5-1. We looked like a youth squad. No one in our offense inspires confidence when they have the ball. We lucked the fuck out at the end, which is not the way I really want to be winning...  Anyway, go Timbers. Go out and get a striker and we won't have problems like these anymore!"

timbers,37x2i3,Shamayvid,6,Sun May 31 03:11:22 2015 UTC,"One of the big differences these last two games has been the trust that our players have shown on attack. A few months ago the description of our team was: ""we dribble through 3 or 4 defenders incredibly, and then shoot the ball right at the keeper."" This lead to very few goals. It was indicative of an offense that didn't trust each other. After all, if your comrades can't score, why wouldn't you take the chance at glory? Except it rarely worked. Looking at you, Nagbe, Wallace, Urruti, and Asprilla.  But now? Porter must have beat some trust into them. They actually pass the ball. Both Urruti and Wallace did so when the goal was close by! They didn't do that in past games!  You see the selfishness in losing teams where players don't feel like other players will score. Winning teams know that their fellow players can execute. Since we haven't started scoring a ton, SOMEBODY must have gotten them to act like winners. I'm guessing porter."

timbers,37xk3e,detroitdoesntsuckbad,3,Mon Jun 1 00:55:04 2015 UTC,"I posted this in another thread, but I think it applies here too.  Our forwards are finally playing with some chemistry. Sure, before you had Nagbe, Powell, and Villafana crossing to or through passing our attackers, but now you have something else. Namely: our forwards trust each other. Go back and watch our previous games. How many times do Wallace, Asprilla, Urruti, or Adi dribble through the defenders and then immediately take a shot, regardless of the angle or number of defenders? Most of the time, if not all of the time  But now you have players passing to each other. In all of our previous games, both Wallace and Urruti would've taken those shots as soon as they were in range. But instead they passed, and it worked.  I think this is due to trust. When nobody on the team has been scoring, why would a player choose to pass a ball instead of shooting it? Who has more confidence in someone else than in themselves? But now that's magically fixed for at least a few of our players. And those 3 instances have been the difference."

timbers,37z2b9,vietnamted,1 point,Sun May 31 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"The team is still a mess.   How so?  We've had a solid back line and our midfield has been morphing due to the staggered return of Valeri and Johnson.   Hodge-podge pieces thrown together with little offensive punch   wut.  Ridgewell was an emergency addition that worked out well.  Adi was an emergency addition who is pretty meh.  Other than that the team has been crafted with purpose.  Our biggest weakness was that our offense has been keyed through Valeri for the past season.  Finally we are getting an offensive solution that has been in front of Porter's face all along, play Gaston in his natural position.  This is troublesome because it's the same position Valeri plays but given Valeri's slow return from injury there will be plenty of substitutions when he comes back fully.   build on an admitted broken base?   U wot m8?  The only things broken were WillJo's and Valeri's legs and Porters confidence in Gaston.  When we are healthy we are dangerous.  When our key starters are injured the results are mixed, the same would happen to any other team.  There are some obvious changes that should be made(sorry Adi) and other changes that we'll probably be forced to make come end of the season(Powell) but our base is solid.    Keep the faith /u/chrispdx, our midfield shuffle will soon end when WillJo and Valeri return to full fitness.  Goals will come and when they do the Timbers Army shall tetris upon the tears of our enemies!"

timbers,37sz59,TomTodo,14,Sat May 30 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"This has been my experience and therefore my advice when in the TA section:   If you are anywhere in the 100's you will be expected to stand the entire match (except halftime), so wear comfortable shoes. If you are anywhere in the 100's you will be expected to chant the entire match, so have/get water. If you are anywhere in the 100's you will be expected to not use your phone constantly. Chant sheet is here but won't do you much good without the rhythm/tune, so I suggest using the titles of the chants and looking them up on YT. Be prepared to have beer spilled on you. Be prepared to have your view occasionally obscured by flags and two sticks. Be prepared to hear a lot of cursing. For this match in particular it's likely to be hot and you'll likely be in the direct sun with no airflow until kickoff. So bring sunglasses, bring hats, wear sunscreen. Have a scarf for you and a scarf for your wife. Prepare to see the Face of God (aka your life will be forever changed after this night)."

timbers,37sz59,sumthingcool,4,Sat May 30 12:24:42 2015 UTC,"First thing: set up your own traditions. We can give lots of advice on our favorite places to eat before, best place to stand, where to get beer, but honestly what matters is just making a schedule you enjoy.   Some tips though...    Arrive early. I'm sure you've heard this enough, but I still bring newbies who just don't get what ""early"" means. Get there 3-4 hours before the game. Get your wristband, then go get a slice of pizza or drink some questionable beverages.  Don't buy a front office scarf. Go to the No Pity Van kiddie corner from the stadium. You'll be able to see it from the line, but you can ask anyone and they'll point you in the right direction.  Shuffle in and stake a claim. You're let in two hours before kickoff. If you aren't standing in line when the line starts moving, it won't have mattered what your wristband says. Enjoy the nosebleeds and lament your poor decisions.  Once you're in and settled, scarf your seat (one scarf per seat) and explore. Walk around, get a craft beer, see what food cart is being hosted. This is a good time to get a song sheet from the information desk. Fold it up and keep it in your pocket so when a confusing song gets sung, you can flip it out and say ""ooohhh they're saying 'and when I go make sure I'm wearing' that makes more sense.""   Otherwise, just have a good time. There's nothing expected of you as a fan, other than to be respectful to the people around you and not mind when Jeff is being a drunk asshole and waving is flag too much. Just enjoy the experience.   Edit: Oops messed up some times."

Ideally I'd hope to find some seats that are near the top of the 100's a little off center of the goal. My hope is that we can arrive two hours early and get a decent spot. I'm not sure how feasible that is. Is the scarf the only accepted way to hold a seat? I've got a Timbers jersey but no scarves. I'm assuming we could drape a jacket or something..."
timbers,37sz59,signhimup,2,Sun May 31 05:29:52 2015 UTC,"Luckily the stadium is centrally located, and with the wristband system you can go and come back. A good bet is to take a MAX to W Burnside 4 hours or so beforehand, get the band, then walk to Powells, Voodoo and the Saturday Market. Games are only 2 hours, so although you are making a day of the event, only 4 hours of it is actually spent in the stadium.   Yeah scarves are placeholders. No Pity scarves are quintessential to the experience. They're sold at-cost at $10."
timbers,37sz59,GlasgowSpider,1 point,Sun May 31 06:04:49 2015 UTC,You can drape a jacket no prob but worth it to pick up a No Pity scarf for $10 at the van before the game.

timbers,37qzhe,MrBrojaySimpson,1 point,Fri May 29 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"""The Rising Sun flag plays off the Army’s tradition of singing “You Are My Sunshine” in the 80th minute—a tribute itself going back to Timber Jim Serrill’s late daughter Hannah and her favorite song. Traditionally green and yellow, the new flag is green and white, with a striped green and white orb representing the sun in the middle.""

Objectively, I think it was smart decision since it would have been tough for him to get to the ball. Subjectively, I wish he would have at least tried."
timbers,37p1dg,buckwheatie,6,Fri May 29 10:35:45 2015 UTC,"11'- Absolutely. Hope he gets the starting nod more often.  19'- Meh. Knee to knee, or knee to thigh. When it first happened I totally agree, but the replay makes it look pretty clear. Not much you can do after that...  Has any goalie put in a better 90 minutes than Hamid this year? Final score could have been at least 3-0. That save on Asprilla's shot in the 71st was bonkers."

timbers,37pq1z,erichazard,20,Fri May 29 12:48:27 2015 UTC,It's sad that our standards for DPs have fallen so low that Asprilla as a DP is being bandied about.  He's not even close to DP level.
timbers,37pq1z,Suedars,3,Fri May 29 12:55:20 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Asprilla has shown flashes but he hasn't even played well enough overall to stay in the starting XI consistently.
timbers,37pq1z,SNPDX,3,Fri May 29 13:53:21 2015 UTC,Put it this way: Asprilla probably earns about $50k-$80k in annual salary. Most DPs make at least $500k annually. (I don't know the exact figure off the top of my head).  Do you feel that he will become worth 10x more within the next year or so?
timbers,37pq1z,KotheTruculent,1 point,Fri May 29 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"I get your point and I totally agree. I really think that GW and Merrit should be looking to splash the cash on someone big but they have shown time and time again that they don't want to do that.   Keep in mind, I said if he continues to show this kind of play throughout the season, THEN he should be considered to be getting a DP contract.   If I were running the team, I wouldn't even consider Asprilla as a DP. However I'm not; GW and Merrit has shown they are looking for the needle in a haystack (remember Valeri is pretty much only here because of a carjacking). Therefore I think if Asprilla continues to show these flashes of excellence and they become more frequent, he deserves a DP contract next season in the GW+Merrit ownership."
timbers,37pq1z,Suedars,1 point,Fri May 29 14:39:00 2015 UTC,"Then that's a pretty damning indictment of the FO. There are plenty of excellent players across the league that aren't DPs, and even if Asprilla consistently plays at his current peak, he'd probably be short of what we should be looking for in a dp"
timbers,37pq1z,Suedars,1 point,Fri May 29 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what I said that would create a 'damning indictment'of the FO? Maybe elaborate on that?   Again, I'll reiterate what I said before, I'm not talking about him continuing to play at his current peak, I'm talking about Asprilla continuing to develop at the rate he's developing now. At just 22 years old, he's got plenty of potential to grow into a first class winger. If this is his peak, then in no way does he deserve a DP contract."
timbers,37pq1z,mankindrc,1 point,Fri May 29 16:58:28 2015 UTC,If the FO is eyeing Asprilla as a possible DP target than they have 0 ambition
timbers,37pq1z,mankindrc,1 point,Fri May 29 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I don't think they are. I think Asprilla can become that needle in a haystack which may cause the FO to want to keep him long-term. I'd hate to see him develop into a strong player and then depart to another club."
timbers,37pq1z,shawnlevy,5,Fri May 29 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"If he goes on a BWP like run and ends up being the brightest new player the league has seen, then I will be okay offering him a DP contract.   He is fantastic, but in my eyes he isn't as good as Valencia was when he played for us. Remember some of those amazing unselfish plays Valencia made for us that led to Valeri only having to tap it into an empty net? That's what Asprilla could have done the other night but failed to do. He played wonderfully, but a pass back to Ridgy instead of a point blank shot at Hamid would have made the score 2-0 at one point.  Asprilla is an amazing individual player. Once he integrates with the team and becomes a little less selfish he will be truly exciting.   I'm honestly just stoked on development because of what we have seen with Powell. Him and Asprilla were on fire down the right side and imagining them together developing at a similar pace turns my vision rose red."
timbers,37pq1z,mankindrc,2,Fri May 29 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"I think you pretty much summed up what I would like to say haha I just failed to do so.   One thing that requires him to become considered to a DP contract is the development. At the beginning of the season, I watched him and thought: ""What an awful signing for such hype.""   And then it seemed a few games later that he was showing some individual talent in small little bursts. At one point, the MLS media team highlighted his dribbling skills against Vancouver.   And then, after Wednesday's game, he showed a lot of individual skills PLUS skills working with other teammates (hence that right side like you said).   Therefore, if he continues this development individually and with his teammates, I think he can be a star.   However, when will he plateau?"
timbers,37pq1z,danhig,1 point,Fri May 29 14:45:58 2015 UTC,I think that will all depend on his mentality. I am convinced that Porter and his training staff are doing something right with development. I just think that some players don't want to change. All of our players are improving right now though. I am excited for this weekend with a full line up. I hope Asprilla starts again.

timbers,37pq1z,IanHogg,2,Fri May 29 15:34:43 2015 UTC,"Pet peeve of mine since we signed Perlaza and Chara in 2011, but it's Colombia.   I'm not against a player earning a DP contract, but Asprilla is so far removed from getting one, the thought never entered my mind until I read this thread."
timbers,37mf2w,PDXMB,13,Thu May 28 18:15:13 2015 UTC,"He's not a midfielder playing midfield.  He's pissed, we're pissed.  If we're not going to run him up top then we need to part ways."
timbers,37mf2w,diabloblanco,8,Thu May 28 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"Will Johnson had the most egregious giveaway of the game, tbh"
timbers,37mf2w,Animasta,4,Thu May 28 20:38:00 2015 UTC,Yes he did indeed and one that almost gave up a goal. Good thing Ridgy was there to clean up.
timbers,37mf2w,Shimshang,7,Fri May 29 02:24:54 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, one great play in one game doesn't really redeem all of the stuff from this season and most of last. Apart from the assist (which, full credit due, was a really nice chance created on his part altogether, and was perfectly placed for Maxi) I felt like his game was otherwise totally pedestrian. He tracked back more, but everyone was doing that. Even Adi.  His body language was weird last night. Before the game he looked energized and happy in the pre-game huddle, and his assist to Maxi seemed to buoy the entire team's spirits for the whole game. So for that he deserves praise, and I don't want to take that away from him. But his sassiness when he got subbed off was more what we're used to seeing from him. He's an inconsistent player, and he's not doing things in his replacement role for Valeri that, say, Darlington Nagbe can't do. I don't think he's on this team next year, and I'm not even sure if he'll be on this team for much longer this year. Last night was certainly the best game he's had here for a long time, but he was basically average with one great moment, not brilliant."
timbers,37mf2w,ewest,3,Thu May 28 19:27:28 2015 UTC,His situation reads more like a summer transfer window departure than anything longer term than that.
timbers,37mf2w,juanbobo808,3,Thu May 28 22:03:08 2015 UTC,Fernandez's passing was fantastic last night.
timbers,37mf2w,GottaFindThatReptar,6,Fri May 29 02:39:13 2015 UTC,Will Johnson saved his ass a couple of times.
timbers,37mf2w,leo_eris,3,Thu May 28 18:32:47 2015 UTC,"Johnson was also culpable of some bad mistakes that lead to chances.  Ridgewell's second half sliding block was a direct result of trying to hard to keep possession pass from WJ to Chara IIRC.  It should have been cleared.    That's the point of being on a team though and that is WJ's role, cover for mistakes.  He isn't supposed to play the final pass, he is supposed to win the ball, hustle his ass of, and do the defense work so our attacking minded players have more freedom and energy to attack."
timbers,37mf2w,Fittyakaferrari,3,Thu May 28 21:29:54 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that he should start more.  In fact he should have taken Valeri's place in the attack until Valeri was healthy.  Play him in the same position he was last night, his natural position, push Valeri out to the right, and Nagbe or RodWall on the left.  If Valeri is out put Asprilla or Nagbe on the right with RodWall on the left.  Urruti starts at striker.  Asprilla comes on as super sub.  He was playing well and having fun and was yanked unexpectedly.  Granted it was probably to save him for the next match but I don't blame him for being a little upset.  I believe his previous attitude ""problems"" is more of a reflection on Porter than Fernandez.  Dude cut his chops bossing around a bunch of college kids and now he's in charge of professionals from around the globe, that requires man management skills on a whole other level."
timbers,37mf2w,Bacontroph,2,Thu May 28 22:39:55 2015 UTC,"Good points. I thought he played much better pushed up higher last night, which of course is consistent with what he's said he's most comfortable playing. It was interesting though how dangerous Wallace was last night coming in for Gaston. I might actually prefer the Wallace for Gaston sub vs. the other way around."
timbers,37mf2w,GottaFindThatReptar,2,Thu May 28 22:56:54 2015 UTC,I don't think Wallace should start for at least the next week or two. Much prefer Nagbe on the left.
timbers,37mf2w,acquiesce,2,Fri May 29 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"Right now, Asprilla > Wallace.  I don't care where Nagbe plays."
timbers,37mf2w,GottaFindThatReptar,1 point,Sat May 30 13:33:33 2015 UTC,"Oh word, Nagbe on the left just opens up Asprilla on the right. And I agree Asprilla needs to be in the starting lineup. He bring so much danger with the speed and shot."
timbers,37mf2w,oregonred,10,Sun May 31 02:03:32 2015 UTC,"At this point, if a person is down on Fernandez and defends Nagbe I just stop listening because that person is obviously an idiot. For real, Fernandez was the 2nd best player on the pitch last night - everything good went through him. He gives it away a lot? So does Valeri. Valeri gives it away twice for every good pass he makes damn near. He should be pissed - he's continually made to play in a position that doesn't suit him, made a scapegoat of and dismissed. Meanwhile Nagbe cruises around doing sweet fuck all while people who think they know something crow on about 'transition play' because they read on stumptown footy that transition play is somehow more important than actually, you know, SCORING OR ASSISTING FUCKING GOALS. Fernandez and Asprilla were dynamite last night and he in no way deserved to be subbed out. He has every right to be pissed at so obviously being mismanaged while other players can turn in a year and a half worth of lackluster performances and still start and go 90 every match."
timbers,37mf2w,Fittyakaferrari,7,Thu May 28 21:04:35 2015 UTC,"Its all about the final product, something Fernandez supplies.  He looked terrific last night with his back to goal, he is clever with space and it let's players move in behind him.  Great performance and he earned another start this weekend IMO."
timbers,37mf2w,KotheTruculent,7,Thu May 28 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"Nagbe has at least one thing that Fernandez does not: hustle. You make a good point about how relatively effective both of them have been on paper. My theory is that Nagbe appears to work hard whereas Fernandez does not, and this influences people.  Put it this way: would you rather root for the hard working, humble father or the lazy-seeming guy with the styled hair who doesn't spend much time in interviews (because of the language barrier, most likely)? Most people choose to like Nagbe over him and other players."
timbers,37mf2w,oregonred,0,Fri May 29 00:48:17 2015 UTC,"i'd rather rate the guy who provides any form of end product on the pitch. I get what you're saying, and I think the thing you allude to is a big problem. I don't give a fuck what they're like, if they're not very good. Luis Suarez is my favorite player. Because he scores a SHIT LOAD of goals and makes your team a SHIT LOAD better."
timbers,37mf2w,KotheTruculent,4,Fri May 29 00:49:59 2015 UTC,"And I think the people who frequent this site would tend to agree with you. I certainly do. But as Suarez has discovered, most people do care about appearances.  And given that neither Nagbe or Fernandez are particularly effective, I'd rather that they both acted like they actually cared."
timbers,37mf2w,AlpineSummit,5,Fri May 29 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"I read all these things about how Nagbe should be called for USMNT camp once he has all the citizenship stuff together...and I just ask myself 'why?' sure, he's flashy. But he needs to be contributing more to goals if people think he'll get a call up!"
timbers,37mf2w,Shimshang,2,Thu May 28 22:46:05 2015 UTC,"And he made that play happen, he had a kinda shitty pass to Asprilla, who had a heavy touch and was in the process of losing the ball when Gaston followed up to get the ball back and set up Urruti with a great pass."
timbers,37mf2w,Proteus010,5,Fri May 29 02:42:26 2015 UTC,You guys crack me up. We were up 1-0 late into the game. Did you want him to sprint off or take his time and eat up the clock?
timbers,37mf2w,ButtRubbinz,2,Thu May 28 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"The issue is that he ALWAYS takes his time. Other than last night, he gets subbed in, lazily dribbles into the defence, and loses possession. Last night was a fluke for him this season in terms of his performance. This wasn't about eating the clock, it's about the fact that he consistently shows no drive to be here for the Rose City."
timbers,37mf2w,Proteus010,3,Thu May 28 18:56:57 2015 UTC,Last night was a fluke for him this season in terms of his performance.   Was it though? or was it more that he was playing his natural position?
timbers,37mf2w,Proteus010,1 point,Fri May 29 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"No, the time he sauntered off when we were down a goal was what upset me. I had no problem with his pace coming off the field last night. I watch him closely, and the thing is, he looks like he doesn't want to be here. And then for Porter not to acknowledge him as he came off the field, I think that the feeling quite possibly is mutual. If there is any validity to that, then I think we're probably watching the last of him."
timbers,37mf2w,GottaFindThatReptar,3,Thu May 28 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain he doesn't want to be here, and why should he? He was benched last season when he was leading the team and the only one scoring goals. He played limited minutes which cut into his pay since he would've received a bonus for scoring X goals.  He's being played out of position, and usually only 10 minutes/match. I'd be a little upset too.  I'm not saying that justifies his attitude at times, but certainly makes it understandable."
timbers,37mf2w,oregonred,1 point,Fri May 29 00:20:17 2015 UTC,"Seriously. We treat him like shit and then get pissed when it seems like ""oh no his heart just isn't in it!""  Gaston is solid at what he does, BUT HE ISN'T A HUSTLE PLAYER. I don't get why so many people (not calling you out just in case that wasn't clear) see that and think he's bad because of it. It just isn't his game and that doesn't make him bad, it just means it isn't the way he plays. I think it's a weird American bias to think that players who hustle are more influential on the game than those that aren't."
timbers,37mf2w,GottaFindThatReptar,2,Sun May 31 04:04:20 2015 UTC,"if Porter was half the man manager he claims to be, he would have been out assertively to tell Fernandez what a great performance he put in. That's good coaching."
timbers,37mf2w,acquiesce,4,Fri May 29 00:51:11 2015 UTC,"I found it really unsettling that he didn't at least try to give him some praise. My overall misgivings about Gaston aside, he deserved praise last night."
timbers,37mf2w,GottaFindThatReptar,2,Fri May 29 01:10:13 2015 UTC,"You're overanalyzing. He has been the ultimate scapegoat this year for little reason when other players are less dangerous. I would much rather Fernandez get in front of goal than Nagbe or Rodwal (who did have a great shot, want more of him as a sub).  Dropping tape on the field isn't new for him or for others, it's a (stupid imo) way to waste some seconds. Players don't always high five Porter either. Don't think that should lead to changing anything unless he's unable to keep up a good level of production. Edit: Or if there's actually a reason to believe he's a locker room cancer. Which we don't.  The giveaways that he had aren't atypical for him. I don't mean that from a laziness point of view, it's just how he gets muscled off the ball and the same reason I hate when we play him further back the field. He needs to push up.   Like BOG said: ""26/29 passing, a couple defensive tackles, and the game winning assist."""
timbers,37mf2w,acquiesce,3,Fri May 29 02:36:14 2015 UTC,"26/29 passing, a couple defensive tackles, and the game winning assist   Who gives a shit how someone walks off the field or if the coach gives them a high five if they have that line.  Also, on TV I couldn't see him walking by CP.  Did you see it in person?  Interesting that CP wouldn't even acknowledge him."

timbers,37mf2w,IanHogg,1 point,Sun May 31 04:06:09 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, all these comments are just from the DCU match:   He had a number of giveaways in the midfield   So did everyone on the team.  Wasn't a pretty match.  I rewatched it and didn't notice him giving it away more than anyone else.     hustle to correct mistakes, team chemistry, offensive production that outweighs the occasional turnover/defensive lapse   He might not hustle as much as others want him to, but he does look like he's trying his hardest.  Also, I saw nothing that set him apart as far as lack of team chemistry.     Discarding tape along the way, expressing his displeasure, head down.    I've seen players taking tape off before, nothing new.  Also, he discarded the tape a few feet from the sideline, not a big deal.  Head down = tired, maybe frustrated he's getting subbed off, but nothing serious.  Do you have footage of him not high fiving CP?  Other than Urruti clapping as he went off, Fernandez and Urruti looked almost identical.     Walks over to RodWall, halfhearted high-fives   I almost made  GIF of it, but there was nothing to show.  Urruti went out of his way to hug/congratulate him, Nagbe went out of his way to walk over and high five him, Wallace (who clapped the whole time) high fived him.    Personally, I don't think you're overanalyzing this, but it seems like you just don't like him that much, which carried over to this match.  I'm neutral on him and felt like he played much better this match and is just in a tricky situation with the team.  Hopefully he steps it up a bit v. COL.  PTFC!"

It disturbed me, in the middle of a winning effort, and with Gaston putting in a pretty decent shift, that there was no love on the sideline for him or from him.

However, sorry to pick nits, but there were two or three times where he had the ball near the goal and all he had to do was do a simple lay-off (one time in particular with Ridgewell right there standing in front of the goal for a sitter stands out) but instead chose to take a virtually 0% shot that got deflected away. Still needs to work on that part of his game."
timbers,37jzut,diabloblanco,20,Thu May 28 17:30:55 2015 UTC,Gaston played well but was clearly pissed at Porter for the sub.  He avoided shaking his hand and sat alone on the far side of the bench until Urutti was subbed off and joined him.  I get that he's been played out of position since he came to Portland but he's clearly letting it tilt him.  I doubt he's with us next year.

Did anyone else notice how flat we were coming out of the break? I thought we had an outstanding first half, and the last 15 minutes were decent - but quite a sag in the middle.   Urruti starts! And scores! Welcome back Maxi, the starting spot is now yours (please). His energy is awesome, including his high press. Love it, and it puts our DP striker to shame. Asprilla's a stud when he's turned on. And he was on tonight. Really like the energy on the right side with him & Powell. Will Johnson provided backbone that we've been lacking. He's always hungry, and it's great to have his energy back on the pitch.  Chara looked slightly better than recently - more creative, a little sharper. Benefited from Capt Will's presence. The Cat finally had a decent showing - good for him.  Paparrato was rotated in and we kept a clean sheet. Good to build some chemistry with Ridgewell. I hate to say it, but Nagbe's body language reminds me of Adi. Not sure if that means anything.   I've got to say, we have a good squad. I just don't worry about the back 5. There's Johnson & Chara in front of them; Nagbe & Asprilla out wide; Valeri & Maxi up top. Let's trade up on Adi, Wallace, and The Cat. We should start to click once all the pieces are back in place. Here's hoping we can manage a win in Denver; if so, we'll be heading into our first game with our full starting squad sitting on 19 points. I so badly want a game where we absolutely pour goals in."

Thank goodness they abandoned the more ""direct"" style of play, which has been a huge failure.

It was great to see GF actually doing something, although he did disappear at times. I love Max when his work rate is high. He isn't a sublime finisher, but I love the energy.   Mostly, I am hoping that Porter was really watching Adi's ham-footed play. He came in against a tired defense and still looked average at best.

So what if we suck?  We'll still support the same as we ever have.  Same as it ever was."

For the record: If we don't turn it around this season I think GW should resign or be relieved.  The plan, if I remember correctly, was a cup within 5 years.  This is the fifth ninth year.  Change it up if we don't meet the goal.  EDIT: by cup I mean MLS Cup. Also corrected how many years due to comment below."

If you don't count '07, '08, '09, & '10, when we took home a single regular season title (not a championship) and two Cascadia Cups (in which Seattle wasn't involved because they were in MLS already)....  Because the same management had a plan in place to win things back then as well.  EDIT: blurry syntax"
timbers,37kbmv,shawnlevy,3,Thu May 28 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"ha! fixed my comment.  Was there any time frame put on the plan back then? My Timbers pre-MLS knowledge isn't what it should be (started following in 2011, moved to PDX in 2012... purely coincidental).  I remember that's when I heard about the five year plan.  Also, any suggested reading for pre-MLS history?"
timbers,37kbmv,GCEmD,4,Thu May 28 19:12:03 2015 UTC,"We started with a three-year plan, and, I believe, a second three-year plan when MLS bloomed.  Even if we multiply those together, we've hit 9 years and I don't personally think we're threatening to become a dynasty quite yet.  The single place that has the most pre-MLS history is the Fans History of the Portland Timbers which was written and edited by the TA and published by the club as a premium to 2011 season ticket holders; copies are available at the Fanladen.  If it were still online, the SCUSA message board would be the place to go but 1) it had hundreds of thousands of posts which 2) were in the context of seemingly just as many real-life conversations and 3) would all probably read like ""Finnegans Wake"" at this point."

My criticism is the delivery of the overall message (GWOut, We need change). Criticism can be healthy.  The delivery comes across as a little whiny and that bums me out because the TA does amazing things for the community and provides friendship/support for many and this overshadows the good but, to quote Nick Lowe, ... and so it goes.  Disrespect comes down to perception of the intended message.  I would never pick a fight with my wife with guests over. It would say that I don't care our guests took time out of their schedules to be spend time with us and I don't care about my wife's feelings in front of others.  The TA Board has a direct line to the FO (right? hopefully?) and other avenues to carefully craft criticism and express their thoughts.  To me the sign said they were more concerned with picking a fight than appreciating the players.  We're likely not going to agree on this and I will still buy you a beer assuming you're old enough and in Portland.  Next home game?  I have so much work to do. Great chat. Go Timbers!"

timbers,37kbmv,acquiesce,1 point,Sat May 30 03:52:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, the TA was the same as it ever was, but just by looking at the sign, you can easily see how people make the connection.  There is a red line and ""same as it ever was"" automatically makes you think that ""we're below the red line, which is the same as it ever was.""  Remove the red line and have it say ""Same as we always are"" or not make it so damn ambiguous, then it turns into the supporters always cheering."

timbers,37kbmv,diabloblanco,9,Thu May 28 23:22:05 2015 UTC,"To those who worry about how the players react to a banner, Old Guy story coming up:  In 2005, the one section-plus-sized TA was under scrutiny for its language and management (not the current folks) decided to surround the North End with security and told people that they would be ejected for using profanity.  The TA responded by keeping 107 empty for the first 80 minutes of the match.  (It looked like this:  http://ow.ly/i/b292k -- note that the WHOLE TA, while leaving 107 empty, couldn't fill either 106  or 108.)  After the match, Timbers player (and current Western NY of the NWSL head coach) Aaran Lines came to the pub for a pint with the fans (as they did back then) and we asked him what he and the rest of the team made of the protest, which seemed to us a huge and impactful gesture.  He said no one had noticed.  That was a sorry lesson to learn, I'll tell you what...."

timbers,37kbmv,fulcrumpdx,9,Thu May 28 14:21:12 2015 UTC,"Honest question:  What do you mean by ""elitists"" in this context?    For me, that's a word that has come into our discourse in the last decade or so when the likes of Hannity and O'Reilly started using it to dismiss progressives.  When I see it in this context, I'm genuinely puzzled.    Have no agenda here other than understanding."
timbers,37kbmv,shawnlevy,12,Thu May 28 16:44:19 2015 UTC,"For me the elitists are the upper echelon of TA who would rather complain about management/ownership than support the guys on the pitch. I sat in 106 about 3 rows up last night, and about 10 seats in front of me were taped off and reserved for ""TA Game Day Ops"". A few of the folks that eventually filed in to that area put up the banner that is the subject of this thread, and one in particular had a small PAULSEN OUT cloth sign. These folks also barely cheered or sang all game. So to me it seems like a small priveliged minority is being allowed to make the TA as a whole look petty and negative."
timbers,37kbmv,thesleddog,11,Thu May 28 18:00:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   I find a lot to take in and unpack here.    The gameday ops folks would be the only ones able to hang something on the stage, yes.  They're 107ist volunteers and their 'privileged' status (by which I mean having seats taped off for them; you may mean something else) is, in effect, their only payment for dozens of hours per week of unpaid work.  (I'm not exaggerating; 107ist officially logs volunteer hours and there are a dozen or so people who regularly put in upwards of 500 and even 1000 hrs/yr.)  I also know that a number of them aren't chanters (there are some in the OG ranks who would actually like to do away with capos; I personally have tried to get them to see the light on that for, oh, a decade).  Some sing, some do not sing, some things can't be altered...:-)  I wouldn't be as quick to impute motive (""would rather complain about management/ownership than support the guys on the pitch""); I think that a number of OGs have been waiting since current ownership's arrival (May 2007) for certain changes in the way the team is run from the top, but they have, all the while, showed up, traveled, made tifo, liaised with the FO, volunteered in a thousand ways, etc. -- in short, supported the players (and, by extension, the entire organization).  I don't see how one mild sign of digruntlement changes that.  And I also -- speaking personally -- don't agree that the banner in question (NOT the ""Paulson out"" two-stick or cloth sign) makes ""the TA as a whole look petty and negative."" But, again, that's just how it looks from one chair....   But appreciate hearing your take; I try to walk a line in these things between knowing everything and knowing nothing, and I am open to learning.  Cheers!  PS:  still waiting for the fellow who first used 'elitist' to elaborate on it...."
timbers,37kbmv,shawnlevy,6,Thu May 28 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"He hit the nail on the head as far as my elitist comment. It is very much the ""upper echelon of TA who would rather complain about management/ownership than support the guys on the pitch.""   I commend the TA for all the hard work they do volunteering and raising money, and I agree with them 80% of the time. However, it's obvious that some of them take themselves far too seriously. They're not the FO and never will be. If you want to rank on the FO that's fine but yesterday's message was a hit on the players too, which is shitty because they're not quitting."

I can understand that some people aren't into chanting, but I guess I expected that some TA hardliners on the rails would be setting an example for everyone else.

I really like the dude as a person and I want him to do well, but lately he looks like Sunderland Jozy.  More to the point, Urruti looks more and more like the dynamic, energetic, free-flowing modern striker that this system needs. Everything moves around him better and he's looking for shots early. It's beautiful when it works like it did yesterday."

Adi does a bunch of great work off the ball that people don't see. He does a great job sucking defenders out of position and I think plays best as a post up type role. He is not a traditional finisher, he setups opportunities and assists.  That said, look at the impact of our other two DPs compared to Adi. Valeri is obvious, the whole team plays better when he is out there and that magic touch. I'm a Ridgewell fan but I think even his detractors would admit our defense as a unit is performing way better since his arrival. So two of our DPs are not only good players, they get the rest of the team playing better. Adi not so much. I'd love to keep him on the team but not in a DP spot, we can get someone better for that slot."

It would have ended 2-0 with Urutti, I sincerely believe, and if DC had equalized with Adi on the field and Urutti gone, we would have ended tied.  Urutti hustles. He tries his ass off.

When we get one of them back our attack is far better organized, can you imagine what it'll be like with both?    Adi was a skillful poacher last season but that requires other players to create the chances.  Everybody here sees it in his play, he can't create for himself and he's a shitty target man.  Last year Valeri averaged 3 key passes per game leaving him tied for 3rd in the league in that stat, he was averaging 3 shots per game leading the team.  For Adi to shine we need Valeri in there working his magic.    If we offloaded Adi I'd be fine with that so long as we replace him with a more creative forward.  It doesn't even have to be a DP caliber player, just somebody who is more willing to create and shoot.  If we don't make the playoffs I really hope Tshuma or Belmar get a turn at forward."

He has been an MLS-Top-10 in goals-per-90 both this year and last when excluding PK goals and those players just getting sub minutes.  As of a week ago (I haven't updated the figures) only 6 players in the league this year had more non-PK goals than Adi.  Last year he was 9th in the league in goals-per-90-minutes when you exclude PKs (and those with fewer than 1000 minutes), and was ahead of such players as Lee Nguyen, Wondo, Cubo Torres, Alvaro Saborio, and Jermaine Defoe; he was barely behind Dempsey in this category? Interestingly, it was one of his teammates, Maxi, in the group of 8 ahead of him.  Yet when I've posted similar info before, I get upvoted by some, but zero Adi-haters have even attempted to explain how he can be SO AWFUL and put up top-10 numbers.  Anybody?  /u/IanHogg, /u/pdxkristian, /u/curaneal, or anyone else?"
timbers,37lhfw,joshing_slocum,1 point,Fri May 29 23:25:24 2015 UTC,"I'll explain that when you can explain his six game draught, and the fact that he's only scored once in forever.  Players with opportunities are going to score. That doesn't mean they're good players, or showing hustle, tactics, ability, or even cooperation. Hell, Boyd looked good at first. Ryan Johnson had a hat trick, then couldn't produce (and I LIKED Ryan, and wanted him to have more chances).  Adi is simply lethargic on the field, he is taller than most players but falls over at a stiff wind, and he's not producing now.  I will, however, say that if he suddenly turns around and becomes a goal scoring machine, I'll concede your point. The last 10 games haven't made that seem likely. At all."

No one is willing to explain to me how all this bitching about him can square with the stats I've posted.  People say crap about Wondo, and it is ridiculous.  Does the freaking ball go into the net or doesn't it?  Through today, Adi's GP90 is .39.  Not great, but not awful (in a typical year, the MLS top-10 goal scorers will have a GP90 of .45 or better after subtracting PKs).  Robbie Keane (2014 MVP) is at .41 this year.  Fabian Castillo, on a Dallas team that has been scoring goals in bunches, .34.  Alvaro Saborio, who has averaged 12 per season over the last 5 years is at .27.  Gyasi Freaking Zardes who scored 16 last year has 2 goals this year in 100+ more minutes than Adi for a GP90 of .16 (do you think any GM in his right mind would make the argument that you just did that, hey, well, he hasn't scored much in his last 6 games so HE SUCKS and let's get rid of him?)  Oh, and Adi has 1 assist to Zardes ZERO, but that's none of my business.  Falls over at a stiff wind?  Are you insane?  He has 6'2"" to 6'5"" guys weighing 190-215 draped all over him every game ... oftentimes two of them when a goal kick of punt is made, and half the time he gets a decent trap and layoff to a mid.  You do understand that there are strong, high-quality defenders doing everything they can to stop him?  Meanwhile, how many times this season have we read complaints from our fans and analysts that our crosses have been poor, etc., but does anyone stop to think that maybe a forward needs some good service?  Gee, what happened when Valeri fed Adi the other day.  Oh, I remember, he scored while having Beasley grabbing him from behind sufficiently hard that in my book it would have been a PK had he not made it.  OK, rant over.  Still waiting for the person who will take my questions on."
timbers,37lhfw,joshing_slocum,1 point,Sat May 30 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"He dives. Period. If you're watching the game and not seeing it, there's not much I can do to help you with that argument. He appeals for calls, and he jogs, he doesn't run. He flops over, and he tries for penalties instead of getting his ass up and playing the game. I would scream at any player if they did that, and in point of fact, even Urruti did it last game, and I yelled in his direction to get up in play, but the difference is, he did it once, Adi does it on practically every play. In this last game he didn't, notably, but he does it almost constantly in every other game I've seen with him this season.  I did explain how it squares with the stats, it's just that we disagree. That's fine, but that doesn't mean I didn't address your concern.  Adi was strong out of the gate, but then, as Borchers proves with half the goals of Adi as a defender, stats can skew to luck or good circumstance. Adi has benefitted from that profoundly, along with luck. It doesn't come from his work on the field, it comes from waiting for good service and occasionally getting it, with the notable exception of the Johnson goal last year.  Urruti doesn't need good service to hustle or have the lowest minutes per goal on the team. He creates situations, and sometimes benefits from situations, as does Adi, and yet despite the raw numbers (4 goals in 14 games, which is miraculous by no means) Urruti is a much better striker and team player in almost every respect. His GP90 makes Adi look pathetic. He's the top GP90 on our team. This is the management going, well, shit, we paid the money, we have to play them, not making the wisest decision for what's working on the pitch.  Babe Ruth had more home runs than anyone. Numbers make him look brilliant. He struck out constantly. Ichiro Suzuki, in contrast, didn't have the home runs, but he was a much better practical asset for any team. Who gets the first glance fame and who does everyone love? Ruth, of course. Number of goals don't change our present series of losses for which Adi's lack of production has a large part. Urruti's attitude and performance this last Wednesday coupled with Asprilla, Will, and Nagbe finally starting to work like a team DOES, and the three points stand on that. When Adi came on, that dried up, and we almost gave up what we had.  Our crosses ARE poor. And yes, I agree, a forward needs good service. But the key difference, and the reason I am calling for Adi's head and not Urruti, is that Urruti keeps fighting, he gets his ass up, he puts pressure on the ball, he doesn't WAIT for service while offsides (Adi does, watch him) and he tries to create opportunities. That he is two goals behind Adi does not speak to much, any more than saying that because Valeri has fewer goals than Adi this season, Adi is the superior player. Context does matter with numbers.  Adi plays like he's waiting to be on the goal of the week reel. Urruti plays like a man on a team. I prefer one and losing to the other and winning, because that's LA Galaxy highlight reel shit, it's bad play and sportsmanship. And we're not LA, we're a blue collar team that scraps and fights and wins OR loses with courage. Adi doesn't represent that for me. He represents the same shit Boyd did, camp and try to look good. And it's not getting us results."

timbers,37lhfw,joshing_slocum,1 point,Sat May 30 02:29:05 2015 UTC,"He dives. Period. If you're watching the game and not seeing it, there's not much I can do to help you with that argument. He appeals for calls, and he jogs, he doesn't run.   I thought you two were talking about Adi, not Gaston..."
timbers,37lhfw,acquiesce,1 point,Sat May 30 03:13:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, football players' performances, more than the performances of players of any other sport, can be completely misrepresented by statistics. Adi is a great example.  Anecdote: My freshman year in college I scored three goals despite playing very few minutes. By the end of the year if we go by goals/minute I was way ahead of our All-American forward in that category. Was I better than him? Hell no! He was 10 times the player I was and anyone with eyes except maybe my dad would say that. As much as I would love to love Adi, the fact is if there was some sort of statistic that could balance out his goals per minute with his tap-ins missed per chance, I think statistics like these would be more relevant.   And let's be clear- I don't hate anyone, I just don't think he is the answer to our finishing woes.  Great win last night. I was only able to watch the first half. It is definitely nice to come into the sub Reddit with a smile on my face 😀"
timbers,37lhfw,pdxkristian,2,Sun May 31 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"And let me be clear: I am not saying that the jury is in on Adi and that he is our long-term solution.  I just don't think the jury is in that he will not be the solution, either.  As a math degree holder and somewhat of a numbers guy, I agree with the notion that stats can mislead.  But, in presenting my numbers in defense of Adi, I excluded players under 1000 minutes last year because it was clear that there were players like you in college who got high numbers based off a small divisor.  I wanted to compare Adi to others getting starters' minutes.  I also excluded PKs since that is basically a gift to the chosen taker (though, if I had the data, I would add back in PK goals scored and credit them to the player who drew the foul, but that data is not available).  Anyway, we need to win this next week and just all go drinking together!"
timbers,37lhfw,joshing_slocum,2,Sun May 31 19:49:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying your methodology. And I want to be clear I do not hate Adi nor do I think the jury is completely in, but he is starting to carve a trail of mediocrity that we can't tolerate for a DP.  He has all the physical gifts to do well. We have seen what he can do when he's good. So frankly those numbers don't really surprise me. What I think really sours the situation for me is all of the games that we could have used those one or two chances that he missed. Those aren't accounted for in stats, but are basically exclamation points in the minds of all of us trying to figure out what's wrong with our team.  Finishing easy chances is the low hanging fruit. Once we can eliminate that problem we can get an idea of what this team is going to be and how talented they really are together. I don't think anyone will argue here that there have been results that were not representative of the play on the pitch.  And I have to tell on myself a bit if you haven't noticed my posting tendencies on his sub: When we win everyone is awesome and when we lose everyone is terrible and needs to be cut! It's for this reason that I'm in the IT field and not coaching! Lol. It's hard to be a fan and be objective."
timbers,37lhfw,pdxkristian,2,Sun May 31 20:51:08 2015 UTC,"Well said. And regarding that last part, we all have a bit of mea culpa there."
timbers,37lhfw,joshing_slocum,3,Sun May 31 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"I just remember last year watching Adi for the first time thinking: ""Wow this guy is not a bad back-up!""  ... then I realized he's a DP ... ... then I thought ...  ""WTF have they done . . ."" I think the theory of his hold-up play with Nagbe is great, but IT DOESN'T WORK. So why keep trying..."
timbers,37lhfw,erichazard,3,Thu May 28 15:27:47 2015 UTC,"I think it speaks volumes that his most memorable play was an assist.  His honeymoon period was great, but pulling the DP bucks out seemed like a knee-jerk reaction at the time, and only feels worse as time goes on. He's fantastic when he's having a good day, but those don't come often."
timbers,37lhfw,pheriannath,4,Thu May 28 16:36:07 2015 UTC,The amount of times he's blown chances by simply tangling his legs up before the last touch is pretty unacceptable from a DP striker. The fact that it keeps happening is really what's putting the nail in the coffin on the future of his Timbers run for me.

timbers,37lhfw,acquiesce,2,Fri May 29 02:22:06 2015 UTC,"He struggled last night - He looked like he did not have his legs. I'm still a fan of his personality and he appears to be a positive teammate thru various interviews I've read/heard.  I'm not sure if he's the guy for the system that Porter wants to run. He fits ""MLS"" in terms of his body size but I think unfortunately, he's appeared awkward and slow in a fast paced, free flowing system."
timbers,37lhfw,DeepestTruthFC,1 point,Thu May 28 16:28:33 2015 UTC,"I for one am not an Adi fan, and haven't been since he got here   Care to give us any reasons?"

timbers,37lhfw,acquiesce,2,Sat May 30 00:49:26 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  While I think that he should be performing a little better, his g/90min are similar to last year and I'd like to see him with both WJ and DV in before I get too hard on him.  I put together a little spreadsheet about g/90min, shots/90min, and SoG/90min.  Was interesting that Adi's were down just a bit, but others players have dropped dramatically.  We're a score-by-committee team and that's not happening this year, so we're putting more pressure on Adi.  Just my opinion."

I believe Asprilla created a major threat starting from the beginning of the game that scared the United backline.   Therefore, Asprilla gets MoTM for me because while he didn't get the assist or goal, it was the right side that provided the gap and pressure for Gaston to send in the assist to Urruti and it was Asprilla who provided the biggest threat on the right side.

timbers,37ja0i,acquiesce,2,Fri May 29 01:55:22 2015 UTC,"TA tickets for this season were $400 apiece. Not sure what the wait is, though it would only be a rough projection based on how long the waiting list is and how many become available each season. This last year, they had something like 97% retention, so it will be a while. Even if you're only considering it, I'd put in for them and you'll have a few years to make up your mind. Also, ask any current season ticket holders you know to request an additional seat for you, as we get first crack at a percentage of each year's available tickets. It will be in their name but can be transferred to you the following year for a small fee."

timbers,37ja0i,bigdadytid,1 point,Thu May 28 09:21:10 2015 UTC,"Waiting list was 10,000 or so at last count. I got in April of 2011 when I moved here, got my tickets in 2013. Back then renewal rate was closer to 95% after the crap 2012 season, so it was about a thousand a year. Last year only ~140 seats weren't renewed.   Guessing that going forward it will be somewhere between 100 and 1,000 seats up for renewal each year, I'd guess the waiting list is 10+ years long.   Each seat requires a non-refundable $50 deposit. As a result, people are motivated financially to stay on the wait list once they are on it, so don't expect people to drop out.   Your best bet is to find someone who for some crazy reason doesn't want their tickets anymore, as they can be transferred once per year in July.   My advice, for what it's worth: get on the waiting if you can afford it, so that someday you can have your own tickets. Get tickets via Facebook. Don't feed the scalpers.

For what it's worth, three of our regular players are from Argentina: Diego Valeri is our beloved star player, and Maxi Urruti and Gaston Fernandez just combined for a goal in tonight's game.  The Timbers haven't been the best team recently, but they are generally fun to watch.  Edit - Offbeat reasons to support the Timbers: Our center backs compete with each other for World's Best Beard (this may be a slight exaggeration) and our mascot is a lumberjack who chainsaws a tree every time the Timbers score a goal or the keeper gets a clean sheet."

Don't get me wrong here, I love the Timbers and I am Rose City 'til I die, but I'm certainly not going to pressure someone into making a decision that they aren't sure they're willing to make.
